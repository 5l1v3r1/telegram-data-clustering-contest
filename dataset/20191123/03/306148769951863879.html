      <h1>Slack's Response to New Microsoft Teams Ad? 'Ok Boomer'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T03:34:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 03:34</time> by <a rel="author">EditorDavid</a></address>
      <p>An anonymous reader quotes Business Insider: <i>Slack <a href="https://twitter.com/SlackHQ/status/1197530383463698432">tweeted a video</a> on Thursday comparing a Slack ad and a Microsoft ad, showing the similarities between them and <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/slack-just-taunted-microsoft-with-ok-boomer-for-running-an-ad-campaign-that-looks-almost-exactly-like-one-of-slack-s/ar-BBX8sAD">implying the Microsoft ad copied Slack's concept</a>. The video was captioned "ok boomer," a phrase that has turned into a meme for millennials and Gen Z to voice their gripes with the baby boomer generation... Slack is leaning into its status as the young, hip startup by calling out its older, more established competition: Microsoft...<br/><br/>On Tuesday, Microsoft announced that Teams <a href="https://slashdot.org/story/19/11/19/1445219/microsoft-teams-hits-20m-daily-users-up-50-in-4-months">hit 20 million daily users</a>, while Slack most recently announced just 12 million users. Slack's stock took a dive after the announcement. Although it has fewer users, Slack points to its user engagement, saying that users enjoy using the app. Slack CEO Stewart Butterfield said that Microsoft sees the company as an "existential threat." </i><br/>The Verge notes that "a lot of businesses will opt for Teams simply because <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20975952/slack-microsoft-teams-competition-ads-video-ok-boomer">it's bundled as part of Office 365</a>." <br/><br/>And ZDNet <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/slack-microsoft-teams-not-only-copies-our-product-but-our-ads-too/">reports</a> that a partner at one of Slack's early investors even tweeted an image showing <a href="https://twitter.com/msquinn/status/1179874609899827200">Google Trends' top five rising queries for Microsoft Teams</a>. #1 is "how to stop Microsoft teams," and also include "how to turn off Microsoft teams," "how to get rid of Microsoft teams", and "Microsoft teams keeps reinstalling."</p>
