      <h1>World Cup envy spurs Chris Ashton's desire for England recall</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T03:28:44+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 03:28</time> by <a rel="author">By Online Editors</a></address>
      <p>Sale winger <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/sale/players/chris-ashton/">Chris Ashton</a> watched on with envy and a hint of regret as <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/england">England</a> went all the way to the final of the World Cup in <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/japan">Japan</a> and reveals he would love a recall to Eddie Jones’ team.</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/saracens">Saracens</a> and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/northampton">Northampton</a> man scored 20 tries in 44 appearances for England in two spells from 2010-19 but withdrew from Jones’ World Cup squad for family reasons.</p>
      <p>Now he says he would welcome the chance to make another comeback for the 2020 <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations">Six Nations</a> after admitting he still feels unfulfilled at international level.</p>

      <p>“When I first got in, I planned to be there for a while,” Ashton said. “I’ve got 44 caps and I hoped for a lot more.”</p>
      <p>Ashton had effectively called time on his international career in 2016 by moving to <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/toulon">Toulon</a> but, after ticking that box, he returned from <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/france">France</a> two years later and earned an England recall after scoring a hat-trick of tries against them for the Barbarians.</p>
      <p>Lifting the lid on his dramatic decision to snub the World Cup, Ashton says he was not prepared to act as back-up to wing regulars <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/leicester/players/jonny-may/">Jonny May</a> and Jack Nowell.</p>
      <p>“I did struggle being away from my family at the time but I didn’t mind because I wanted to play for England again,” he said.</p>

      <p>“The day before we were due to meet up. I couldn’t make my mind up. Then my wife got pregnant so that was it. She was due around the time of the World Cup final.</p>
      <p>“But if I had been <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/leicester/players/jonny-may/">Jonny May</a>, it would have been a very different scenario. My phone call with Eddie was, ‘Jack (Nowell) is injured, you’re in.’. If I’d been Jonny, I’d have to have gone.</p>
      <p>“The warm-up games were fine obviously but when the tournament kicked off, I thought I probably should have gone, although that’s easy in hindsight.</p>
      <p>“Sitting at home on the sofa, with the family watching it on TV, it’s easy to think like that.</p>
      <p>“If Eddie rang I would definitely love to play again. But I’ll be 33 in March so we will see.”</p>

      <p>Ashton claims he is still the fastest man at <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/sale">Sale</a> and he is hoping to add to his Heineken Champions Cup record haul of 39 tries when the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/sharks">Sharks</a> host <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/la-rochelle">La Rochelle</a> on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Beaten in their opening fixture at Glasgow, they are boosted by the return of World Cup finalists Faf De Klerk and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/sale/players/tom-curry/">Tom Curry</a> and Ashton says that has already given the team a lift.</p>
      <p>“Faf is so critical to any team that he is in, especially here because a lot of what is happening at Sale and how we are starting to roll along has been driven by him,” he said.</p>
      <p>“So for him to come back – and Tom developing the way he is – you could notice the complete difference in training the last couple of days.</p>
      <p>“There is so much energy from the pair of them and now a lot of experience in them both.</p>
      <p>“Teams I watched last weekend were lifted by their players coming back from the World Cup and I expect them to do the same this weekend.”</p>
