      <p>Question Time host Fiona Bruce has been praised for laying down the law to the audience, declaring 'I'm in charge!' during a heated debate.</p>
      <p>The 55-year-old presenter was forced to tell a Jeremy Corbyn supporter to be quiet after he yelled at prime minister <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> during a Question Time special in Sheffield, South Yorkshire.</p>
      <p>Viewers said she showed "more leadership than we've seen in the UK in the last three years" while some even wanted her to become the next prime minister.</p>
      <p>In fact one said "Fiona Bruce is my new spirit animal!" as she waded into the audience.</p>
      <p>She told one heckler: "This (programme) is not just for you this whole session. No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.</p>

      <p>"But you're going to have to stop there otherwise it is just not fair on everyone else who has got their hands up.</p>
      <p>"It just becomes an evening just for you and that's not right. I think you have got as much of an answer as you are going to get. Can we hear..."</p>
      <p>She then raised her voice and said: "Hang on a minute! Hang on a minute! I am in charge of this thing!"</p>
      <p>The response has won plaudits and applause from the audience - and even Boris Johnson.</p>

      <p>Boris Johnson was interrupted over 40 times by Ms Bruce and the audience - four times more of Jeremy Corbyn's 11.</p>
      <p>Another viewer said: "Fiona Bruce was great at pointing out the candidates' bulls**** and gaining control of the audience."</p>
      <p>But Ms Bruce was also criticised as siding <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> during the debate.</p>
      <p>"Fiona Bruce constantly interrupted Boris Johnson to discredit his answer but didn't do the same to Corbyn or any other leader... same for the audience Corbyn had supportive questions where as Boris was savaged," one said.</p>
      <p>The programme featured <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/snp">SNP</a> leader Nicola Sturgeon, Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson, Labour leader <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jeremy-corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a> and prime minister Johnson.</p>
      <p>The Lib Dem leader was hit with a tough question over why she claimed she'd become PM.</p>
      <p>But despite an audience member saying her claim was "ridiculous", she claimed she had no regrets.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> leader Jeremy Corbyn was challenged on anti-semitism in his party and struggled to explain why nationalising broadband was a good use of public money.</p>
