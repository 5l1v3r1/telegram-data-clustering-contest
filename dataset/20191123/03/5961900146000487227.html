      <h1>Prince Andrew Has Been Right Royally Removed From His Office At Buckingham Palace</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T03:00:48+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 03:00</time> by <a rel="author">By Alasdair Duncan</a></address>
      <p>In the latest of a series of humiliating episodes, <b>Prince Andrew </b>has been turfed out of his office at <b>Buckingham Palace</b>, with the authorisation of his mother <b>Queen Elizabeth</b>.</p>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/prince-andrew-forced-to-move-office-out-of-buckingham-palace-2vl7wns7q"><b>Times Of London</b></a>,  Andrew was told to clear his office and staff out of the palace on Friday, just days after announcing his decision to step back from official duties.</p>
      <p>His private secretary <b>Amanda Thirsk </b>was also fired, reportedly due to her part in encouraging the <b>Duke of York</b> to take part in his now-infamous BBC interview.</p>

      <p>The interview saw Prince Andrew discussing his friendship with convicted sex offender <b>Jeffrey Epstein</b>, and denying allegations that he had sex with a minor.</p>
      <p>He faced heavy criticism for his flippant responses and apparent lack of empathy for Epstein’s victims, and was mocked for a bizarre claim about how he does not sweat.</p>
      <p>As backlash from the interview, intensified, the 59-year-old prince announced he’d be stepping back from his public duties, with the permission of his mum. He said:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>“It has become clear to me over the last few days that the circumstances relating to my former association with Jeffrey Epstein has become a major disruption to my family’s work and the valuable work going on in the many organizations and charities that I am proud to support. Therefore, I have asked Her Majesty if I may step back from public duties for the foreseeable future, and she has given her permission.”</i>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The Times reports that a lawyer representing a number of Epstein’s alleged victims has accused the prince of “enabling” his crimes, and has urged him to cooperate with US authorities.</p>
      <p>The lawyer in question said that the prince may be served a subpoena if he does not testify willingly in a future legal action.</p>
