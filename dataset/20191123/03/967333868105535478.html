        <b>WASHINGTON (Sputnik) - President Donald Trump has proposed raising the minimum age for the purchase of e-cigarette products in the United States to 21 amid the health epidemic caused by the so-called vaping products.</b>
      </p>
      <p>"21 we are going to be doing," Trump was quoted as saying in a release that pooled press comments he made at a meeting with vaping industry executives, public health advocates, lawmakers and administration officials on Friday.</p>
      <blockquote>The number of vaping-related deaths in the United States <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201909131076792932-presidential-directive-us-first-couple-warn-son-barron-not-to-vape-amid-trumps-ban-on-e-cigarettes/">grew by five over the past</a> week to 47, and nearly 2,300 cases of lung injuries have been reported, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on Thursday.</blockquote>
      <p>Some lawmakers criticized Trump earlier this week for his apparent walk-back on a planned ban on flavored e-cigarettes, which has been <a href="https://sputniknews.com/society/201911191077344715-trump-backtracks-on-e-cigarette-ban-calls-for-meeting-with-vaping-officials/">identified as a new addiction</a> and particularly among young people.</p>
      <p>Trump defended his decision to propose an age limit on vaping products rather than an outright ban by comparing the effects of illegal liquor consumption during the 1920-1933 prohibition on alcohol in the United States.</p>
      <blockquote>"You watch prohibition... if you don't give it to them, it is going to come here illegally," Trump said referring to e-cigarettes. "They could be selling something on a street corner that could be horrible... they are<a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201910101077008420-melania-trump-teenagers-session-vaping/"> going to have a flavor</a> that is poison."</blockquote>
      <p>The minimum age to purchase any tobacco or vaping product is 18 under US federal law. But more than one-third of US states have already raised the sale age to 21. A federal law raising the purchase age would require congressional action.</p>
