      <p><b>KARACHI: </b>A report submitted by Sindh Chief Secretary Syed Mumtaz Ali Shah to the Sindh High Court sheds light on the deplorable condition of health facilities in the province, stating that hospitals located in rural Sindh’s urban centres lack the capacity to treat cancer.</p>
      <p>The report largely focuses on oral cancer cases, mainly caused as a consequence of gutka and mainpuri consumption, reported in Sindh in 2018.</p>
      <p>According to the report, of the 489 cancer patients brought to Chandka Medical College Hospital in Larkana, in 2018, five suffered from oral cancer.

The report states that 2,088 cancer cases were reported at Larkana’s Lines Hospital and none at Ghulam Muhammad Mahar Medical College Hospital in Sukkur.</p>
      <p>Referring to the lack of cancer treatment facilities at Civil Hospital, Khairpur, the report elaborates that all cancer patients brought to the hospital had to be referred elsewhere.</p>
