      <p>Rumor has it that Chris Brown is a father of two now that Ammika Harris has supposedly given birth to his son. That being said, one insider report claims to know that the performer is super excited to introduce his daughter, Royalty to her baby brother.</p>
      <p>Brown apparently wants to ‘get her involved in everything’ that means being a big sister and he is also certain she will be great at it!</p>
      <p>For the time being, however, the happy news that he’s welcomed a new addition to the family is yet to be announced officially.</p>
      <p>But while he is not yet ready to introduce his new son to the world, he is looking forward to introducing him to his older sister, Royalty, who he shares with ex, Nia Guzman.</p>
      <p>A source close to the celeb tells HollywoodLife that ‘Chris is happy with being a father again. He is really looking forward to getting Royalty involved in everything and expects her to be the most amazing big sister ever. He loves the fact that he has a daughter and a son and he now feels complete.’</p>
      <p>The pal went on to say that Chris has ‘dreams of their future’ already and that he is ‘really looking forward to seeing what both his kids grow up to be. [Fatherhood] has changed Chris for the better and now having a son it is really making the important things in life come to the front.’</p>
      <p>TMZ reports that Chris and Ammika welcomed a baby boy on November 21 and fans believe that she and Chris had been dropping some hints on social media that she’d indeed given birth.</p>
      <p>For instance, one pic shows the man smiling brightly with the caption: ‘11-20-2019.’</p>
      <p>Another pic features Chris in a hoodie that reads: ‘BORN.’</p>
      <p>Finally, the supposed new mom also wrote on her page: ‘I was in love when I first saw you ❤.’</p>
