      <p>Tuma Dandi, TPC Secretary General, said the withdrawal by Morocco is a big blow to Tanzania’s Para athletes who were preparing for the games which were to be held from January 26-30 in the city of Rabat.</p>
      <p>He said most of events at Morocco Games would have been used as qualification for Tokyo 2020 Paralympic Games.</p>
      <p>The TPC official named local Paralympic athletes, who were ready for the Morocco Games, as Paralympics swimmers, athletes, power lifting and wheelchair tennis players, while sitting volleyball and wheelchair basketball players are still taking part in training.</p>
      <p>Dandi issued the comments following a letter that the Africa Paralympics Committee (APC) sent to the National Paralympics Committee of various countries.</p>
      <p>The APC in the letter said the decision was made following unresolved issues between APC and Morocco authorities.</p>
      <p>“This is a big blow to Tanzania Paralympics athletes, we prepared them for the games, they were ready physiologically and the morale was very high, they were looking forward to qualifying for the Tokyo Paralympics,” Dandi noted.</p>
      <p>“You know we are tired of competing at the main events on wild card, the aim was to have a straight qualification.”</p>
      <p>In April this year, Morocco accepted to host the Africa Para Games after a protocol agreement was signed in the presence of International Paralympics Committee (IPC) president Andrew Parsons and APC president Leonel da Rocha Pinto.</p>
      <p>Dandi however said he is optimistic that APC will shift the host of the games to another country, but maintained that this will still affect his committee in many ways which include time of preparations and physiological effect.</p>
      <p>“I’m sure APC will look for another country to host the Africa Paralympic Games, but the main problem is preparations, and there is also a possibility that the games can be held in zones, there are unconfirmed reports that Uganda will host goal ball, Nigeria will host power lifting,” he said.</p>
      <p>The Africa Para Games were separated from main African Games and the new format would have placed the All Africa Paralympic Games into the same category as the main Paralympic Games, which are organized separately from Olympic Games.</p>
