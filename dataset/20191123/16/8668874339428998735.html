      <h1>Saracens' Rotimi Segun showcases his 11.03 second 100-metre pace in Ospreys rout</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T16:58:20+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 16:58</time> by <a rel="author">By Online Editors</a></address>
      <p>Saracens wing <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/saracens/players/rotimi-segun/">Rotimi Segun</a> showed off his remarkable pace with a well-taken brace as the North London club breezed by the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/ospreys">Ospreys</a> at Allianz Park.</p>
      <p>DoR Mark McCall believes the Champions Cup can be retained if they defy the crisis that has engulfed the club by reaching the quarter-finals.</p>
      <p>A 35-point deduction for breach of salary-cap regulations has left the double winners fighting a desperate battle for <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership">Gallagher Premiership</a> survival, forcing McCall to prioritise domestic action knowing his playing resources will be depleted by international call-ups during the Six Nations.</p>
      <p>But after the Ospreys were swept aside 44-3 in front of a subdued crowd of 7,531 at Allianz Park, McCall refused to rule out a successful defence of their European crown.</p>

      </p>
      <p>“We are still ambitious to do well in the competition and we still want to win the games,” he said.</p>
      <p>“We have just got some decisions to make along the way about when the internationals play and we will make some decisions along the way.</p>
      <p>“If we get through to the quarter-finals we’ve got a chance – a good chance – because in my experience this team in pretty good in knockout rugby.”</p>
      <p>Elliot Daly was named man of the match on his debut after setting up two tries for wing <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/saracens/players/rotimi-segun/">Rotimi Segun</a> in a comfortable bonus-point victory that restored <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/saracens">Saracens</a> to winning ways after their defeat at <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/racing-92">Racing 92</a> last weekend.</p>
      <p>Segun showed exceptional pace for his second try in the 46th minute.</p>

      <p>His first try followed a brilliant half volley from <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/saracens/players/tom-whiteley/">Tom Whiteley</a> and a subsequent offload from man of the match Elliot Daly.</p>

      <p>“Overall it was a good performance. We were a bit sloppy in the first half of the first half in particular,” McCall said.</p>
      <p>“We were a little bit sideways and not as confrontational as we wanted to be, but our performance improved as the game went on.”</p>
      <p>Ospreys head coach Allen Clarke admitted his injury-ravaged side, who were also missing their <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/wales">Wales</a> stars following the World Cup, were taught a lesson at Allianz Park.</p>
      <p>“We were chasing the game and you don’t want to be doing that against Saracens in their own back yard,” Clarke said.</p>
      <p>“There’s undoubtedly a bit of self-belief that’s missing amongst the group at the moment based on the run we’ve been on.</p>
      <p>“There’s no lack of desire or work ethic but when you’re chasing a confidence-boosting win this is a tough place to come.</p>
      <p>“We’re in the game to win so this is tough and as a club we have a lot of work to do.</p>
      <p>“Saracens were excellent and they do what they do very well.”</p>
      <p>The Ospreys have lost their opening two Champions Cup group games and Clarke revealed the likes of Alun <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/wales/players/wyn-jones/">Wyn Jones</a>, <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/wales/players/george-north/">George North</a> and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/wales/players/justin-tipuric/">Justin Tipuric</a> are at least two weeks away from returning to action.</p>
