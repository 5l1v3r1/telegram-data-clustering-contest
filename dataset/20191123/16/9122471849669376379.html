      <h1>Ohio State Announces Senior Captain Is Redshirting, Will Return In 2020</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T16:46:13+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 16:46</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>Just before Ohio State and Penn State took the field for their showdown on Saturday afternoon, the Buckeyes announced a major personnel decision.</p>
      <p>Senior captain Jonathon Cooper will redshirt this season and be back for the Buckeyes in 2020.</p>
      <p>Cooper has been battling a high ankle sprain for the better part of the season. He’s managed to see the field in three games so far this season. He’s eligible to play in one more game in 2019, which could be in today’s game against Penn State.</p>
      <p>Here’s the news from Ralph Russo.</p>

      <p>Ohio State welcomes Chase Young back into the fold for today’s game, which gives the Buckeyes a huge boost on their defensive line. Young missed the last two games while serving a suspension, but he’s hungry and motivated to go this afternoon.</p>
      <p>As for Cooper, he’ll likely either play this afternoon or next weekend against Michigan. It’s possible Ohio State holds him out for a more meaningful game later in the season as well. With the Buckeyes in position for a College Football Playoff berth, Ryan Day could decide to hold Cooper out for a while.</p>
      <p>Ohio State and Penn State kick off at 12:00 p.m. ET. The game will be broadcast on FOX.</p>
