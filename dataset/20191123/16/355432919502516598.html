      <p>Former Trump national security adviser <a href="https://thehill.com/people/john-bolton">John Bolton</a> on Saturday emphasized a renewed focus on “critical national-security issues” in his latest missive since returning to Twitter.</p>
      <p>“Let's get back to discussing critical national-security issues confronting America. The threats are grave and growing. The presidency and control of the House and the Senate will all be decided in less than one year. It's time to speak up again!” he tweeted Saturday morning.</p>

      <p>Bolton, a vocal national security hawk, <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/471662-bolton-claims-he-has-liberated-his-twitter-account-after-it-was">returned to Twitter this week</a> after a hiatus, claiming his account was “suppressed unfairly” after his September departure from the White House.</p>
      <p>"We have now liberated the Twitter account, previously suppressed unfairly in the aftermath of my resignation as National Security Advisor. More to come," Bolton tweeted.</p>
      <p>He later added that the White House "refused to return access to my personal Twitter account" and that he was "sorry to disappoint" anyone who thought he would not eventually speak out.</p>
      <p><a href="https://thehill.com/people/donald-trump">President Trump</a> on Friday denied that Bolton’s Twitter account was frozen after he left the administration.</p>
      <p>"No, of course not," he said on Fox News. "I actually had a good relationship with John. We disagreed on some things and some methods, but I actually had a good relationship."</p>
      <p>A senior administration official later <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/471662-bolton-claims-he-has-liberated-his-twitter-account-after-it-was">told The Hill</a> that the White House didn't prevent Bolton from accessing his personal account, saying it wouldn't have the technical means to do that.</p>
      <p>Bolton’s resurgence on social media comes amid the ongoing House impeachment investigation. Lawmakers had sought his testimony regarding Trump’s efforts to lobby Ukraine to launch a public investigation into former Vice President <a href="https://thehill.com/people/joe-biden">Joe Biden</a>, but Bolton and several other key figures did not testify during the past two weeks of public hearings.</p>
      <p>The former national security adviser has said he will continue to work with his Bolton PAC to support House and Senate candidates “committed to policies promoting a strong America.”</p>
