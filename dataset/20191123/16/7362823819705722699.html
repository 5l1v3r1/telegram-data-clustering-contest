      <p>Businessman and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/2020-presidential-election">2020 candidate</a> <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/andrew-yang">Andrew Yang</a> had a biting response to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media">MSNBC</a> after the network asked him to appear on air amid his campaign's complaints that the network treated him unfairly in its coverage of the Democratic field.</p>
      <p>"Was asked to appear on <a href="https://twitter.com/MSNBC">@msnbc</a> this weekend - and told them that I’d be happy to after they apologize on-air, discuss and include our campaign consistent with our polling, and allow surrogates from our campaign as they do other candidates’," he said. "They think we need them. We don’t."</p>

      <p>Yang and his followers previously attacked MSNBC, noting the relatively low amount of speaking time he had in comparison to other candidates at Wednesday's Democratic debate.</p>

      <p>"lt felt great ... but then it felt like, 'When the hell are they going to f-----g call on me?'" Yang reportedly said at a watch party. "The hypocrisy of MSNBC in a way just makes us stronger. I'm almost -- almost grateful."</p>
      <p>According to a New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/11/20/us/elections/debate-speaking-time.html">analysis</a>, Yang spoke for less time (6 minutes, 48 seconds) than any other candidate on the stage. By contrast, the majority of candidates spoke for more than 10 minutes. Only Yang, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/tulsi-gabbard">Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii,</a> and billionaire <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/tom-steyer">Tom Steyer</a> spoke for fewer than 10 minutes.</p>
      <p>By Thursday afternoon, a hashtag trended on Twitter: #MSNBCFearsYang.</p>

      <p>Prior to that debate, the network excluded Yang from a graphic on polling and one previewing the debate.</p>
      <p>The network attempted to apologize on Sunday but faced mockery from Yang's campaign manager. "Thank you @MSNBC, for making this apology for the 15th time. The #YangGang is very excited for #16," campaign manager Zach Graumann said.</p>
