        <b>Three people have suffered serious injuries after the car they were travelling in crashed into a house and caught fire.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The incident on the Isle of Lewis happened on the A857, after the junction with the A858, known as Barvas Corner, at about 01:30.</p>
      <p>Three men in the car, aged 22, 32 and 36, and a 61-year-old woman who was in the house were rescued by police.</p>
      <p>A 32-year-old man was arrested in connection with road traffic offences.</p>
      <p>The car ended up standing upright on its bonnet, leaning against the house.</p>
      <p>The driver and two passengers of the blue Vauxhall Zafira were taken to Western Isles Hospital for treatment to serious injuries.</p>
      <p>Sgt Donald Sinclair, of Police Scotland, said: "Our inquiries into the circumstances of the crash are ongoing and <a href="https://www.scotland.police.uk/contact-us/non-emergencies/">I am appealing for anyone who saw the crash</a> or who saw a blue Vauxhall Zafira being driven on the A857 before 1.30am to come forward.</p>
      <p>"I'm particularly keen to speak to anyone who may have dashcam footage which could help with our inquiries."</p>
