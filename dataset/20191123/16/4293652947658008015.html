      <p>QUEBEC — Fourth-year quarterback Adam Sinagra led the Calgary Dinos to a 27-13 win over the Montreal Carabins for the Vanier Cup on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Sinagra, a native Chateauguay, Que., completed 22-of-28 passes for 292 yards and two touchdowns in his final U Sports game to help Calgary win its first Canadian university football championship in 24 years.</p>
      <p>The victory marked the fifth Vanier Cup for the Dinos in school history. They had last won in 1995, when they beat the Western Mustangs in Toronto.</p>
      <p>Calgary took a 20-10 lead early in the fourth quarter Saturday when Hunter Karl caught a nine-yard pass from Sinagra, completing a 10-play, 87-yard drive.</p>
      <p>The Dinos added a late TD in the final minute of the game on a Robinson Rodrigues one-yard run.</p>
      <p>Calgary opened the scoring with a pair of field goals from Nick DiFonte — from 22 and 38 yards — to take a 6-0 lead in the second quarter.</p>
      <p>The Carabins briefly pulled ahead, scoring the game’s first touchdown on a one-yard run from Reda Maki late in the second quarter. The score was helped by a faked field goal during the drive.</p>
      <p>The Dinos responded quickly with a touchdown of their own when Sinagra reached Jalen Philpot in the end zone on a 13-yard pass, giving Calgary a 13-7 lead at half time.</p>
      <p>Karl extended Calgary’s lead to 20-7 with his TD in the fourth, before a pair of field goals by Montreal’s Louis-Philippe Simoneau from 27 and 16 yards cut the Carabins’ deficit to 20-13.</p>
      <p>The Dinos suffered a serious blow on defence when linebacker Charlie Moore was injured on the second offensive play of the game. Moore went down after he tackled running back Ryth-Jean Giraud. Moore got back up after a few minutes but did not returned to the game.</p>
      <p>Later, it was the Carabins defence that was hit hard when linebacker Jean-Philippe Levesque and defensive back Marc-Antoine Dequoy exited the game with injuries.</p>
      <p>It was the first ever game between the Dinos and the Carabins.</p>
      <p>The game was played in front of 8376 fans at Telus Stadium, on the campus of Laval University.</p>
      <p>Calgary last appearance in a Vanier Cup before Saturday was in 2016, when it lost to Laval on the same field.</p>
