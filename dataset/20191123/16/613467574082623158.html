      <h1>Tesla’s Elon Musk was offered a truck design by Nikola CEO right after Cybertruck unveiling</h1>

      <p>Nikola Motors CEO Trevor Milton has offered a more traditional truck design to Elon Musk immediately following his presentation of Tesla’s “Blade Runner” inspired Cybertruck.</p>
      <p>The unveiling of the all-electric Cybertruck brought on polarizing outlooks from across the automotive community. One such person was Nikola Motors CEO Trevor Milton. Taking to Twitter, Milton offered to “donate” a pickup truck design to Tesla that may “hit a broader market”, clearly suggesting that Cybertruck may be limited in its appeal.</p>
      <p>“Hey @elonmusk we don’t build cars or trucks, but I’m happy to donate this truck design if your team wants to hit a broader market. My team designed it just in case and I’m happy to let you build it since we won’t. Let me know and we can talk,” noted Milton.</p>

      <p>With a long-standing history between the two companies – <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-semi-rival-nikola-opens-new-headquarters/">Nikola Motors’ hydrogen-electric Semi</a> truck and the Tesla Semi compete in the same market – the offer by Milton, to Musk, for a pickup truck design can be seen more as a jab at Cybertruck’s polarizing design versus an untimely outreach to do business.</p>
      <p>Unlike any traditional truck on the market, the Cybertruck gave those in search of an environmentally-sustainable, all-electric truck a fresh and futuristic outlook on America’s largest automotive market, led by Ford F-150 and Dodge Ram pickup trucks.</p>

      <p>Tesla has never been known for creating things that fit the norms of the automotive industry. The company’s goal was to drive consumers away from petrol-based automobiles, something that had not been accomplished by any car manufacturer before them. The aesthetic design of their highly successful Model S and Model 3 sedans fit the overall look of traditional luxury cars. However, the interiors of Tesla vehicles do not match those of its competitors. Utilizing no buttons or dials to control things like the climate inside the car, Tesla has gone with a simpler design, using a large dash screen in both of these vehicles.</p>
      <p>Nikola Motors does not create sedans or trucks, but rather Semis and Utility Task Vehicles (UTVs). Nikola Motors will compete with Tesla’s all-electric Semi that has been purchased by many large companies, including Frito Lay. It will begin production in 2020. The Phoenix, Arizona-based Nikola Motors is not an all-electric manufacturer, but rather a hybrid truck company that utilizes battery-powered and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. They have received financial backing from the U.S. Department of Energy to research fuel cell technology.</p>
      <p>Tesla Cybertruck will be available in a single motor, dual-motor, and a tri-motor (<a href="https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-model-s-plaid-what-we-know-so-far/">Plaid powertrain</a>) configuration. Starting at $39,900, Cybertruck is <a href="https://www.tesla.com/cybertruck">available for pre-order</a> and has an anticipated production date of late 2021.</p>
