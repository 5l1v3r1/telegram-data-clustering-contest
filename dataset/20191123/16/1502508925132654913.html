      <p>An average household medical expenditure, excluding childbirth, during hospitalisation at <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/private-hospitals">private hospitals </a>was seven times more expensive than that of <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/government-hospitals">government hospitals </a>in India during July 2017-June 2018, showed a survey by <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/category/current-affairs-news-national-1150106.htm">National </a>Statistical Office (NSO) on Saturday.</p>
