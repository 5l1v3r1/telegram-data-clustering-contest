      <h1>Trump will ‘compel’ Adam Schiff to testify in impeachment trial</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T16:55:17+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 16:55</time> by <a rel="author">Mary Kay Linge</a></address>
      <p>President Trump predicted Saturday that Rep. Adam Schiff will be forced to testify in the Senate impeachment trial he is pushing Republicans to launch.</p>
      <p>“Adam Schiff will be compelled to testify should the Democrats decide, despite the fact that my presidential conversations were totally appropriate (perfect), to go forward with the Impeachment Hoax,” <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1198259181104586752">Trump tweeted Saturday</a>.</p>
      <p>He also pointed to several recent polls that, he said, “have now turned very strongly against Impeachment!”</p>
      <p>Trump <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/22/trump-predicts-a-historic-watchdog-report-about-origins-of-russian-probe/">said Friday that a trial</a> in the Senate will clear him of accusations that he tried to force Ukraine to investigate Joe and Hunter Biden for his own political benefit.</p>
      <p>“I want a trial,” he said on the Fox News Channel’s “Fox and Friends.”</p>
      <p>Republicans have accused Schiff (D-California), who chaired last week’s House impeachment hearings, of coordinating with the whistleblower who complained about Trump’s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.</p>
