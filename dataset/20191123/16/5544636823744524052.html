      <p>Aide-de-camp to Dim Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu during the civil war and head of Rock Family Church, Bishop Obi Udezue Onubogu has said that the Igbo “are absolutely not wrong” to think <a href="http://concisenews.global/biafra-news">Biafra</a> is the route to El Dorado for them, Concise News reports.</p>
      <p>Ojukwu’s erstwhile aide, however advised agitators to embrace dialogue.</p>
      <p>The cleric was speaking in a recent interview with Sun News Online.</p>
      <p>“Our people are very excited about freedom. You may call it any name you like but it’s a quest for freedom. The freedom to decide our own things, do our own things, develop our land the way we want and join the rest of the world in doing exploits.</p>
      <p>“So, there are so many radical things showing up. The thing is that things majorly at stake are not addressed. Get round a table and dialogue.</p>
      <p>“Put the cards on the table and discuss and know where you stand. It is only when you can’t be contained in the arrangement, maybe you are evicted, rejected, obstructed or not wanted; then, you begin to seek your own land and space.</p>
      <p>“They are absolutely not wrong in thinking like that. But from what I have said, let’s have dialogue first. The Igbo say that he that is rejected by others does not reject himself.”</p>
      <p>Asked to offer advice to South East governors on how to bring the Igbo together, <a href="https://www.concisenews.global/2019/11/23/ojukwus-adc-reveals-what-ndigbo-must-do-to-produce-next-nigeria-president-in-2023/">Onubogu posited</a>: “These men are doing their best. They are faced with very difficult work conditions. The church should be in prayers at every moment.</p>
      <p>“We should lift them up in prayer and support the various good projects they have. What we have is that those who are in every good position are under serious attack and criticism and so on.</p>
      <p>“But we elected them into that position so we should assist them to make their mark. That doesn’t mean that when they do wrong we will not speak out against it but if they do things that are against our interests and welfare, we should speak out against it.</p>
      <p>“We elected them into that position but we should be very careful not to take the position of opposition from the beginning.</p>
      <p>“You want to oppose their views, you want to oppose the projects they have, you want to oppose their suggestions, no, that’s not how to do it.</p>
      <p>“As long as they do not take the views of the people for granted or ignore the views of the people, we should come around and make suggestions and appreciate them when they do good.”</p>
