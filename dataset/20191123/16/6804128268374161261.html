      <h1>Manuel Pellegrini's silence on calamity keeper Roberto sums up West Ham's dire straits</h1>
      <h2>The Hammers stopper was at fault for goals yet again but his manager ignoring questions isn't helping</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T16:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 16:00</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Inkersole</a></address>
      <p>Let's cut to the chase, shall we?</p>
      <p>Roberto is not good enough, he shouldn't have played against Spurs thanks to his previous gaffes and the fact he made more again in the 3-2 London Derby should be the end of him in a West Ham shirt.</p>
      <p>Whether it is David Martin or U23 keeper Joseph Anang coming in for the Chelsea game next week, it is a change that Pellegrini has to make because this circus cannot go on.</p>
      <p>Seemingly for every save Roberto makes, he makes an error to cancel it out. He made two against Spurs, allowing Son Heung-min's shot to go past him from a tight angle and then Harry Kane's header went through his hands to make it 3-0 to the visitors.</p>
      <p>Add to that the calamity against Burnley when he punched the ball into his own net, being beaten at his near post by Bernard up at Everton, it all adds up to a keeper who is not at Premier League standard.</p>
      <p>He is not being made a scapegoat either. Yes, West Ham as a collective have been abysmal since the September international break and Manuel Pellegrini is under enormous pressure for his job, but it starts with the keeper.</p>

      <p>Two nervous clearances early on set the tone for Roberto, who later in the half punched Angelo Ogbonna in the head instead of the ball, and was ironically cheered every single time he touched the ball. It's an embarrassing predicament to be in.</p>
      <p>Pellegrini refused to answer any questions on the Spanish goalkeeper at his post-match press conference. The manager doesn't normally speak about single players so this is nothing new, especially if they have had a bad game, but the fact he wouldn't even defend the stopper this time around says a lot.</p>
      <p>Usually, the boss has said that Roberto has had a good career in Europe with big teams, has experience behind him etc etc - but it is exactly that, behind him.</p>

      <p>This week? Nothing. Not a word.</p>
      <p>"I don't want to talk about Roberto or individual performances" said the manager at his post-match press conference which lasted three minutes.</p>
      <p>That says an awful lot.</p>
      <p>Is Roberto the only problem? No he isn't. There are far too many players under-performing for the Hammers at the moment, as is the manager himself.</p>
      <p>Felipe Anderson is having a torrid season, Sebastien Haller doesn't look like a £45m striker, Issa Diop is well below his levels from last season, Andriy Yarmolenko has drastically gone off the boil, we could go on.</p>
      <p>But it does start at the back, where there is no confidence in the keeper in his defenders and that is translating everywhere up and down the pitch.</p>
      <p>West Ham are in relegation form, it is that simple. Two points taken from the last 21, no win in seven league games, three victories all season and a team looking devoid of inspiration in themselves and from their £8m-a-year manager.</p>

      <p>The manager will make a change to his defence next weekend as Issa Diop will be suspended for picking up five yellow cards but he should be making two with Roberto being replaced. This cannot go on.</p>
