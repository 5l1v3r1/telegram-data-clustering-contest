      <h1>Here's Why Kim Kardashian Cried 'the Whole Way Home' from the 2013 Met Gala</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T16:22:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 16:22</time> by <a rel="author">Hilary Weaver</a></address>
      <p>In recent years, Kim Kardashian has become a <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a27390309/kim-kardashian-blue-latex-dress-met-gala-after-party-2019/">Met Gala staple</a>. On the first Monday in May, she dresses to impress all the cameras waiting to flash at the best looks on the carpet. This year, her tight-fitting gold dress was no exception, even if it did create a<a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a29459369/kim-kardashian-kanye-west-met-gala-dress-fight/"> Met Gala eve rift </a>between Kardashian and her husband, Kanye West.</p>
      <p>But six years ago, Kardashian was not yet the belle of the Met Ball. In 2013, she was invited as West's guest. At the time, she was pregnant with the pair's first child, North, and wore a long floral print Givenchy by Riccardo Tisci dress. In a “Life In Looks” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Knj8-MKFn8&amp;feature=youtu.be">video for <i>Vogue</i></a>, Kardashian recounts the look—and why it ended up being infamous in her mind.</p>
      <p>“Kanye was performing so I wasn’t actually invited; I was just Kanye’s plus one. And that was okay with me because I never really dreamed I would be at the Met Ball,” she said. “I know no one really probably wanted me there at the time.”</p>
      <p>Despite feeling insecure, Kardashian said she gave into Tisci's suggestion for a stretchy floral print. But then the memes started rolling in.</p>

      <p>“I think Robin Williams even <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-best-tweet-about-kim-kardashians-met-gala-dress">tweeted it</a>, said I looked like Mrs. Doubtfire,” she said. “I was crying the whole way home because I just couldn’t believe it.”</p>
      <p>The media mogul seems to have gotten used to the kind of attention that comes with the Met Gala territory. She's open about all the unconventional adjustments she has to make to some of her looks. On <i>Keeping Up with the Kardashians </i>this year, she was open about her bathroom plan in her fitted dress.</p>
      <p>“If I have to pee, it’s a problem ... Honestly, if it’s an emergency, I think I pee my pants and then have my sister wipe my leg up,” Kardashian West said. “I’m not even joking. She can wipe my leg up.”</p>
