      <p>Taking place over two days in Arnold town centre, the market event began on Friday, November 22, coinciding with the annual Christmas light switch-on that evening.</p>
      <p>Visitors and stall-holders said it was "a great event for the community".</p>
      <p>Emma Farr, 28, of Arnold, took her daughter Millie Hall, two, to the event on Saturday, November 23.</p>
      <p>She said: "Every year this event just seems to get better and it's great for Arnold to have something like this because it saves you having to go into the centre of Nottingham to entertain the kids.</p>
      <p>"It definitely gets me in the festive mood and even though it's November we put up our Christmas tree yesterday - so it's never to early for an event like this."</p>

      <p>Collette said: "I've never seen it this busy in Arnold and especially at the light switch-on last night the crowd was absolutely massive - so there's definitely been more interest this year.</p>
      <p>"It's a great event because it brings the community here together and when you're looking after children it's certainly never too early to get into the Christmas spirit."</p>

      <p>Jane said: "I grew up in Arnold and it's not that long since we moved back here so it's lovely for it to have an event like this.</p>
      <p>"We did come to last year's event but this one is definitely a lot busier and Isla has really enjoyed going on all of the different rides today.</p>
      <p>"Because I grew up in Arnold it's great to see that it still has a great sense of community spirit with events like this."</p>

      <p>The enthusiasm of people visiting the event was matched by those who set up a stalls there.</p>
      <p>They included Kate Bagshaw, 41, who was selling dog accessories. said: "We've come all the way from Chesterfield today and I was actually invited to come here.</p>
      <p>"I think the council were keen on having a dog-themed stall because the market for dog products is booming.</p>
      <p>"I've only been set up for about a year and the demand has been unbelievable - but I've enjoyed actually coming to meet my customers because a lot of my sales are done online.</p>
      <p>"So it's been nice to properly interact with customers for a change and the people in Arnold are just so friendly."</p>

      <p>In keeping with the dog theme, another stall allowed visitors to have a sketch made from a picture of their pooch by a local artist.</p>
      <p>The artist in question, 57-year-old Mel Roberts, of <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/local-news/live-police-scene-after-reports-3502064">Kimberley,</a> said: "I've been to loads of events with my work including Chatsworth, Castle Howard and I've even been asked by BBC Countryfile to do Windsor next year - but Arnold is one of my favourite Christmas events.</p>
      <p>"Everyone is just so friendly and there's a great atmosphere here - I used to have my own studio but sat all day in there could often get quite insular so it's great to get out and about.</p>

      <p>"In terms of trade I've been really pleased with how its gone so far, and when I'm actually working on a sketch a bigger crowd gathers to watch me so I gradually get more interest as these events go on."</p>
      <p>Other stall-holders included Fiona Horner, 50, of <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/we-thought-nuisance-caller-boris-3545978">Mansfield,</a> who attended with her mum and niece, 10-year-old Teagan Waterfield, to show off their home-made crafts.</p>
      <p>Fiona said: "We've been really busy at this event and we haven't really stopped.</p>
      <p>"This is our third time here and it's always a really good atmosphere - you certainly get to meet some characters.</p>
