          <b>The term first appeared on <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Cuffing%20Season">Urban Dictionary</a> in 2011 and grew in popularity over time as it was used in songs, memes, and pop culture.   </b>

          <b>While the term 'cuffing season' is relatively new, the concept of people pairing up for the winter isn't, according to professional matchmaker Caitlin Bergstein.</b>

      <p>As the air gets colder and leaving the house becomes a bit less appealing, the pressure to hunker down with a mug of hot chocolate and get on Tinder, Grindr, or Hinge in time for "cuffing season" might start to feel more intense. </p>
      <p>But if you're an older millennial, Gen Xer, or baby boomer, you might be scratching your head and wondering what cuffing season is.  </p>
      <p>Cuffing season is internet slang that refers to the phenomenon of people looking for partners to date and commit to during fall and winter. While the cuffing season concept has become especially well-known in the past few years, with <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=cuffing%20season&amp;src=typd">plenty of memes</a> and <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/love-sex/cuffing-season-what-is-it-serious-relationship-tied-down-dating-single-autumn-winter-alone-a7922731.html">think pieces</a> dedicated to it, the term's origins go further back. </p>
      <h3>'Cuffing season' appears to have originated on Urban Dictionary in 2011</h3>
      <p>While it's true origins are unclear, <a href="https://www.esquire.com/lifestyle/sex/a25620571/cuffing-season-relationship-explainer/">Esquire traces</a> the term's beginnings to an <a href="https://www.esquire.com/lifestyle/sex/a25620571/cuffing-season-relationship-explainer/">Urban Dictionary</a> post made in 2011. However, it wasn't until 2013 that the term started picking up traction in songs and <a href="https://twitter.com/lexiwilkes/status/925760015008456714?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E925760015008456714&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.esquire.com%2Flifestyle%2Fsex%2Fa25620571%2Fcuffing-season-relationship-explainer%2F">social media</a>, with publications like <a href="https://hellogiggles.com/lifestyle/cuffing-season-is-a-thing-as-it-turns-out/">Hello Giggles</a> and the Huffington Post also beginning to cover the phenomenon.</p>
      <p>These days, it's not uncommon to spot a cuffing season meme on Twitter.</p>

      <p>While this urge to pair up and brave the lower temperatures might seem appealing in the moment, cuffing season romances aren't typically meant to last <a href="https://www.insider.com/how-to-survive-cuffing-season-according-to-dating-expert-2019-11">beyond early spring</a> (or even<a href="https://www.oprahmag.com/life/relationships-love/a28800645/cuffing-season/"> Valentine's Day).</a></p>
      <p>Though the term is somewhat tongue in cheek, the concept might be legitimate. Dr. Justin Lehmiller, a social psychologist and research fellow at the Kinsey Institute, wrote an<a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/a3pmpp/what-is-cuffing-season-winter-relationships-commitment"> article for Vice in 2018</a> in which he analyzed Facebook trends that show more people <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-data-team/the-right-time-for-love-tracking-the-seasonality-of-relationship-formation/10150643989093859">change their relationship status</a> to "coupled" during cuffing season than any other time of year.</p>
      <p>Kinsey connected these findings to research showing testosterone levels are <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12843149">higher for men in the winter</a> than other times of the year, and that serotonin levels are <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673602117375">lower</a> in the wintertime, potentially leading to a desire for physical contact and warmth. </p>
      <p>"What the data suggests is that the winter cuffing season does seem to be a thing, and whatever is driving it may be distinct from what propels mating at other times of year," Kinsey wrote.</p>
      <h3>Some researchers suggest 'cuffing season' is no more than an urban legend</h3>
      <p>Not everyone believes cuffing season has real roots in biology.</p>
      <p>"It's all good fun, and a nice new urban legend, but based on what I've seen, cuffing season isn't biological," Paul Bloom, a professor of psychology and cognitive science at Yale University, told <a href="https://splinternews.com/is-cuffing-season-an-actual-scientific-thing-1793844944">Splinter</a>. "There's no reason to believe that such a thing exists."</p>
      <p>But while biology may not be to blame, Frank Farley, an educational psychology professor at Temple University, told Splinter said that the social pressure surrounding the holidays might.</p>
      <p>"I don't believe 21st-century humans are programmed for a 'cuffing season,' Farley told <a href="https://splinternews.com/is-cuffing-season-an-actual-scientific-thing-1793844944">Splinter News</a>. "However, 'feeling the need' might be a factor due to loneliness, coupled with a fear of being alone during the holidays."  </p>
      <p>Caitlin Bergstein, a professional matchmaker for <a href="https://www.threedayrule.com/">Three Day Rule</a>, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/reason-for-cuffing-season-winter-relationships-2017-11">told  Brit + Co</a>. that having a consistent partner can be beneficial for the holiday functions and family events that oftentimes go hand in hand with cuffing season.</p>
      <p>"Whether it's holiday parties, your family asking why you're single, or the constant barrage of romantic movies on TV, the holidays can be a tough time to be single," Bergstein said.</p>
      <p>Whether it's because of biological instinct or social pressure, cuffing season has have grown quickly from Urban Dictionary entry to a full-blown annual tradition. </p>
