      <h1>Prince Andrew should come to US to face Jeffrey Epstein probe: lawyer</h1>

      <p>Prince Andrew should come to the United States on his own to answer questions in the Jeffrey Epstein investigation, a victim’s lawyer says.</p>
      <p>Lisa Bloom, a lawyer representing five alleged victims, called on Prince Andrew to voluntarily come to the US to participate in the federal probes.</p>
      <p>“I, as an attorney, have the right to subpoena witnesses to come and take depositions,” Bloom told a BBC program.  “It’s not going to be easy to subpoena someone like Prince Andrew. He’s obviously not walking down the street where a process server can just hand him a piece of paper, it’s a lot more complicated.”</p>
      <p>Following a disastrous<a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/18/prince-andrews-disastrous-epstein-interview-is-costing-his-charities/"> “car crash” interview</a> with the BBC last week in which the royal showed almost no sympathy for the plight of Epstein’s alleged victims, he was stripped of his royal duties and salary by his mother Queen Elizabeth II.</p>
      <p>In a statement issued by Buckingham Palace last week, the prince said that he would cooperate with “any appropriate law enforcement agency” with their investigations after what he accepted was his “ill-judged association” with Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
      <p>Bloom and other attorneys have <a href="https://twitter.com/LisaBloom/status/1197606317529030656">demanded that Andrew travel to the US</a> to appear for civil depositions and produce any documents that shed light on the prince’s association with Epstein, who died in a Manhattan federal lockup in August.</p>

      <p>Epstein accuser Virginia Roberts Giuffre, has said that Prince Andrew had sex with her three times when she was 17 in 2001 and 2002  in London, New York and on Epstein’s private island in the US Virgin Islands.</p>
      <p>The prince has denied the allegations.</p>
