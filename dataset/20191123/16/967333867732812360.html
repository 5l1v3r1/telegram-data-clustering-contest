      <p>WikiLeaks announced on 19 November that Sweden had discontinued its investigation into a rape allegation against Assange, which it began in 2010. However, the <a href="https://sputniknews.com/world/201911231077316879-investigation-reveals-further-conflicts-of-interest-for-chief-magistrate-overseeing-assanges-case/">whistleblower still faces criminal charges</a> from two other countries — the United Kingdom and the United States. Assange is currently serving a prison sentence in the United Kingdom for breaching his bail conditions, but the United States has requested that he be extradited.</p>
      <p>Assange and WikiLeaks leapt into the spotlight back in 2010 when they released a classified video of the killing of two Reuters staffers in a US airstrike in Iraq in 2007. The group has since published hundreds of thousands of other classified materials on the US operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>
