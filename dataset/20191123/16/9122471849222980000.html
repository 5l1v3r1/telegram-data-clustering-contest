      <h1>Penn State Fans Can Now Breathe Easy About Today’s Ref</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T16:15:11+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 16:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p><b>UPDATE: </b>The report about the official for today’s Ohio State-Penn State game being John O’Neill was incorrect, according to Greg Pickel.</p>
      <p>This is good news for Nittany Lions fans, who were originally outraged at the news of O’Neill being the ref.</p>

      <p><b>EARLIER: </b>The head official for today’s Ohio State-Penn State game at Ohio Stadium in Columbus has been announced. It’s John O’Neill.</p>
      <p>Penn State fans are not happy about this.</p>
      <p>O’Neill is a veteran Big Ten referee and he has some not-so-great history with the Nittany Lions. Most notably, he maade some questionable-at-best calls in this year’s Penn State-Iowa game.</p>
      <p>There <a href="https://www.collegian.psu.edu/football/article_33e26648-ee16-11e9-be13-4fae60be8e44.html">was actually a petition started</a> to get O’Neill fired after that game. Roughly 15,000 people signed it in early October.</p>
      <p>“John O’Neill and his team of officials have missed multiple calls that have led to Penn State losses as well as the losses of touchdowns. Whether through reviewed plays or lack of reviewing their calls have been both wrong and inconsistent,” the petition read. “At this level of play, such poor officiating should be unacceptable and these referees are not performing at the level they should be. They should be relieved of their duties.”</p>

      <p>O’Neill’s crew made several questionable calls in that game at Iowa. Penn State fans were furious when a Pat Freiermuth touchdown was overturned and the Nittany Lions had to settle for a field goal.</p>

      <p>Penn State head coach James Franklin took a not-so-subtle shot at the officiating following the win at Iowa.</p>
      <p>“We were one of the least penalized teams in the country coming in and tonight it didn’t play out that way,” Franklin said. “And I’ll leave it at that.”</p>
      <p>Hopefully we can avoid any officiating controversy in Columbus this afternoon.</p>
      <p>Ohio State and Penn State are set to kick off at noon E.T. on FOX.</p>
