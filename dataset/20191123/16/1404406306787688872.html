      <p>Tesla unveiled its new Cybertruck during a live demonstration in Los Angeles on Thursday (November 21), but things didn't go as planned while showing off the Cybertruck's armored glass windows. </p>
      <p>CEO Elon Musk claimed the car was bulletproof against a 9mm handgun, but an audible gasp was heard in the arena when Tesla's chief designer Franz Von Holzhausen shattered the windows by throwing a metal ball at them. Musk was visibly caught off guard, exclaiming, "Oh my f*cking God. Well, maybe that was a little too hard." Von Holzhausen threw the ball again, shattering the glass. </p>
      <p>Musk then added, "We threw wrenches, we threw everything even literally the kitchen sink at the glass and it didn’t break. For some weird reason, it broke now. I don’t know why. We will fix it in post." </p>
