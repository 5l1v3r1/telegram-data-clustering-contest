      <p><b>MADRID — </b>Canada reached its first Davis Cup final after beating Russia 2-1 on Saturday.</p>
      <p>In the decisive doubles, Vasek Pospisil and Denis Shapovalov beat Karen Khachanov and Andrey Rublev 6-3, 3-6, 7-6 (5).</p>
      <p>The Canadians, playing Davis Cup since 1913, will meet in the final Britain or host Spain, which played in the other semifinal later Saturday.</p>
      <p>Two-time champion Russia was trying to make it to the final for the first time in 12 years.</p>
      <p>Rublev put the Russians ahead defeating Pospisil 6-4, 6-4 in the first singles, and Shapovalov evened the tie by downing Khachanov 6-4, 4-6, 6-4.</p>
      <p>In the doubles, the Canadians trailed 3-0 in the third-set tiebreaker but rallied and converted their second match point.</p>
      <p>“Today was an incredible match,” Pospisil said. “I mean, the doubles, just with the buildup, obviously getting to this moment the last five days, I mean, it took a lot of emotions even just to get to this match.</p>
      <p>“It’s pretty incredible to make the finals, first time in history for Canada. To do it the way it happened was pretty special to be a part of.”</p>
      <p>Pospisil and Shapovalov have played all of the matches for Canada, which won Group F by defeating former champions Italy and the United States, then eliminated another former champ Australia in the quarterfinals. It had never beaten the U.S. or Australia in the Davis Cup.</p>
      <p>The Canadians impressed in Madrid without two of their top three players. Milos Raonic was out injured, and Felix Auger-Aliassime was with the team but also injured.</p>
      <p>The 150th-ranked Pospisil did not drop a set in singles this week until his loss to Rublev. The 20-year-old Shapovalov, No. 15 in the world, also won three of his four singles.</p>
      <p>Russia, which won its Davis Cup titles in 2002 and 2006, also used only Khachanov and Rublev.</p>
