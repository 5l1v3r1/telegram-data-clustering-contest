        <b><a href="https://mspoweruser.com/minecraft-earth-us/">Minecraft Earth Early Access</a> finally landed in the US on November 12th and Microsoft’s first mobile AR game has already racked up 1.4 million downloads in its first week alone.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/minecraft-earth-first-week-downloads">According to Sensor Tower</a>, the game has managed to generate almost 2.5 million downloads worldwide across both the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store.</p>
      <p>However, despite the US-based downloads making up the bulk of Minecraft Earth’s success, the game still lags behind other location-based AR games in regards to first week download numbers in the US.</p>
      <p>Pokémon GO dominates the first week download US charts, with Sensor Tower reporting that the game achieved 32.7 million downloads in its first week. Harry Potter: Wizards Unite comes in second with significantly fewer downloads during its first week, weighing in at just 3.1 million.</p>
      <p>Minecraft Earth Early Access comes in third, with 1.2 million downloads in its first week. It’s followed by Jurassic World Alive, which achieved 573,000 downloads, then The Walking Dead: Our World with 330,000 downloads, and finally Ghostbusters World, which managed to get just 126,000 downloads in its first week.</p>

      <p>Minecraft Earth’s Early Access mode launching in the US marks the 10th country to get access to the game, joining the UK, Canada, South Korea, the Philippines, Sweden, Mexico, Australia, New Zealand, and Iceland in enjoying building blocks in real life.</p>

      <p>If Minecraft Earth has yet to come to your country, don’t sweat it! Microsoft says that the game should be out globally by the end of 2019. The game will support all the same languages as regular vanilla Minecraft.</p>
      <p>To play Minecraft Earth, you’ll need a mobile device that runs at least Android 7 or iOS 10. You’ll also need a Microsoft or Xbox Live login account.</p>
