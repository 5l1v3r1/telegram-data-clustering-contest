      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T16:25:15+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 16:25</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/entertainment-desk/" target="_blank">Entertainment Desk</a></address>
      <p>Kangana Ranaut’s first look as the former Tamil Nadu Chief Minister <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/jayalalithaa">Jayalalithaa</a> from the upcoming biopic Thalaivi is out. Along with it, the makers have also announced the release date of the movie. It releases on June 26, 2020.</p>
      <p>The first look poster shared by the makers looks a little unbelievable and you wonder if it is a photoshopped image of Kangana on Jayalalithaa’s original photo. But things get a little better with the Thalaivi first look teaser. In it, we get to see a glimpse of the younger phase of Jayalalithaa’s life when she was an actor. Later, it moves ahead to show her life as a politician.</p>

      <p>Hollywood prosthetics expert Jason Collins of Captain Marvel-fame has worked on Kangana’s look in Thalaivi. Excited to play the legendary actor and politician on-screen, Kangana had said, “Jayalalithaa ji is one of the biggest female success stories of this century. She was a superstar and went on to become an iconic politician, it’s a great concept for a mainstream film. I am honoured to be a part of this mega project.”</p>

      <p>Thalaivi was granted the status of an official biopic, and the team has received a ‘No Objection Certificate’ from the late Chief Minister’s nephew Deepak Jayakumar.</p>
      <p>Producer Vishnu Vardhan Induri, who is also producing 83, said, “I am excited to show this story of an actor turn politician, which is based on one of India’s most loved and followed public figures. Thalaivi is a very dear project to all of us as it is a story that needs to be told. And the way, Kangana has slipped into the character, is simply amazing. Can’t wait to present this film to the audience.”</p>
