      <h1>Up to 1,500 attend rally over planned closure of holiday centre for disabled</h1>
      <h2>Cuisle centre in Roscommon due to close next Friday over lack of funds to upgrade it</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T16:28:41+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 16:28</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishtimes.com/profile/marese-mcdonagh-7.1837465" target="_blank">Marese McDonagh</a></address>
      <p>An estimated 1,500 people have attended a rally in Roscommon town to protest at a decision by the <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=Irish+Wheelchair+Association">Irish Wheelchair Association</a> to close a holiday centre for people with disabilities from next Friday.</p>
      <p>Several speakers urged the IWA to halt the closure of <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=Cuisle">Cuisle</a>, a national holiday and respite centre in <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Donamon">Donamon</a>, Co Roscommon, for at least 12 months to allow fund raising to take place.</p>
      <p>In a recent statement the IWA reiterated its intention to close the facility on November 29th, saying it did not have the €1.15m required to do necessary electrical and fire safety upgrades. It said it had a legal responsibility to ensure the safety of everyone who stayed and worked there.</p>
      <p>The association added that it had developed a new respite model using fully accessible hotels in the west of <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/news">Ireland</a> which would be available from next March.</p>
      <p>Service users, and their families said they were bewildered and upset at the sudden loss of the Cuisle centre where 48 people are currently working.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Samantha+Thomsen">Samantha Thomsen</a>, one of several wheelchair users attending the rally, said she had holidayed there six times and did not believe a hotel model was feasible, especially for people with profound disabilities.</p>
      <p>“Fifteen of us have booked there for next May,” she said. “I have stayed in hotels where they panic when they see a wheelchair .</p>
      <p>“The staff in Cuisle know us all. They remember us and all our individual needs when we return. You would never get that kind of service in a hotel”.</p>
      <p>Ms Thomsen said the IWA had now admitted that they knew of the funding problems since 2017.</p>
      <p>“Why did they not tell us and give us an opportunity to fund raise.”</p>
      <h3>‘Red herring’</h3>
      <p>Local resident <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Paula+Naughten">Paula Naughten</a> attended the rally with her nine year old twins George and Isaac who are both in wheelchairs.</p>
      <p>“We have three little boys with duchenne muscular dystrophy,” she explained. Ms Naughten said her family had attended many community events at Cuisle which also hosts weddings and christenings.</p>
      <p>“There is a sense of bewilderment and disbelief that this national centre is going to close,” she said. “The IWA is saying this is what service users want but as far as I know they never asked service users. This talk about getting away from a congregated setting is just a red herring”.</p>
      <p>Independent TD <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Michael+Fitzmaurice">Michael Fitzmaurice</a> told the crowd that pressure had to be “ramped up” in the coming days while Deputy <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Eugene+Murphy">Eugene Murphy</a> (FF) said the IWA was conducting a “phoney debate”.</p>
      <p>He said that while a funding shortfall had initially been the reason given for the decision “all of a sudden last Thursday there was an asbestos problem”.</p>
      <p>His party colleague Senator <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Terry+Leyden">Terry Leyden</a> said that if Cuisle closes, the €40m in exchequer funding which the IWA gets annually should be transferred to a new organisation.</p>
      <p>Service user Ita Donohoe pleaded with the IWA not to close Cuisle. “We love the staff, we love the food, we love the area. It is just beautiful,” she said.</p>
      <p>Councillor <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Pascal+Fitzmaurice">Pascal Fitzmaurice</a>, Cathaoirleach of Roscommon county council questioned the estimated €1.1m cost of electrical work. “That’s €25,000 to rewire each bedroom. Do they think we are stupid?,” he asked.</p>
      <p>In a statement read to the rally by <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Noel+Brennan">Noel Brennan</a> a staff member at Cuisle, <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Erica+Boucher">Erica Boucher</a>, one of the service users who is non verbal said: “We feel nobody understands how we feel.”</p>
      <p>Speaking about the staff in Cuisle she said: “If I get upset they comfort me. If I am sick they look after me”.</p>
