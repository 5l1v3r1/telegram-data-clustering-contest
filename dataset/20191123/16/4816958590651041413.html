      <p>MADRID — Canada reached the Davis Cup final for the first time as they won a thrilling semi-final against Russia on Saturday with Denis Shapovalov and Vasek Pospisil clinching victory in the deciding doubles rubber.</p>
      <p>Shapovalov and Pospisil, who have shouldered the burden through four ties in La Caja Magica this week, combined to beat Andrey Rublev and Karen Khachanov 6-3 3-6 7-6(5).</p>
      <p>“I have no words, it’s unbelievable,” the 20-year-old Shapovalov said on court as Canada’s fans celebrated.</p>
      <p>Things had looked bad for Canada when Pospisil’s incredible run of singles wins here came to an end in the opener against Rublev, the 29-year-old going down 6-4 6-4.</p>
      <p>But Shapovalov leveled things up when he beat Khachanov 6-4 4-6 6-4, sending the tie down to the wire.</p>
      <p>Canada will face either Spain or Britain in Sunday’s final. (Reporting by Martyn Herman, editing by Ed Osmond)</p>
