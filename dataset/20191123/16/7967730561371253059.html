      <h3>Charles: Fifty Years a Prince</h3>
      <p>
        <b>7TWO, 7.30pm</b>
      </p>
      <p>This celebratory documentary marks 50 years since Prince Charles was formally invested with the title of Prince of Wales. Which was 11 years after he actually became Prince of Wales, at the age of nine. Of course, he had been a prince since birth, being the son of the Queen, so "50 Years a Prince" is something of what some might call "a lie", but I guess any excuse for a party. And this doco is, essentially, a party: a deep investigation of the heir apparent to the English throne that ends up concluding – spoiler alert! – that this prince fellow is an absolutely super chap. Bombshell revelations include: the prince loves his country; the country loves the prince; his wife is rather fond of him; he lives in a castle. If you're a fan of Prince Charles, this will really satisfy your urge to revel in royalty. If you're not a fan of Prince Charles, it'll just raise your blood pressure to dangerous levels.</p>
