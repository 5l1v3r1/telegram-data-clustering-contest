      <p><b>(WVLT) --</b> Peyton Manning was in the stands as the Denver Nuggets took on the Boston Celtics Friday night.</p>
      <p>During a timeout in the fourth quarter, Nuggets' mascot, Rocky, threw a pass to Manning.</p>
      <p>In a tweet, ESPN said "Peyton's still got it," after Manning caught the pass and launched it across the court back at the mascot.</p>
      <p>The long throw was good, but Rocky was unable to catch the pass from a disappointed Manning.</p>
