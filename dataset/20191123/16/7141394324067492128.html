      <h1>Bitcoin (BTC) Venture Lolli Partners With Retail Giant Nike to Offer Crypto Rewards, Eyes Elon Musk and Tesla</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T16:10:19+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 16:10</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://dailyhodl.com/author/thedailyhodl/" target="_blank">Daily Hodl Staff</a></address>
      <p>Lolli, an online service that lets users pay for everyday items with Bitcoin (BTC) at more than 750 e-commerce stores, says it’s partnering with Nike. Lolli’s management says its crypto-paying customers will receive BTC rewards when they shop online for shoes, apparel and various other items at Nike.</p>
      <p>Users can earn “up to 3%” Bitcoin back when they purchase fitness apparel, Nike sneakers, and equipment through Lolli’s store page.</p>
      <p>Lolli says it’s rolling out a holiday deal in order to celebrate the launch of its newest partner.</p>
      <p>In addition, the company <a href="https://twitter.com/trylolli/status/1197636594368430081">says</a> it will be giving out <a href="https://satoshitobitcoin.co/">50,000 sats (satoshis)</a>, equivalent to 0.00050000 BTC or $3.67 “to everyone who stacks sats at Nike” and posts a screenshot of their confirmation email over the next 72 hours.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, CNBC <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/12/100-of-the-worlds-most-promising-start-ups-to-watch-in-2019.html">announced</a> that Lolli made its top 100 startups list.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.lolli.com/">Lolli</a>, which counts a number of big brands among its Bitcoin rewards network, including Walmart, Postmates, Old Navy and Lululemon, is also eyeing Tesla as a partner. The Lolli team gave a shout-out on Friday to Elon Musk who just announced the company’s new $39,900 Cybertruck pickup.</p>

      <p>Mixed martial artist Ben Askren retweeted Lolli’s request asking Musk if he’s down for the Bitcoin partnership.</p>
      <p>While the tech entrepreneur recovers from a bumpy product debut, Askren, a Bitcoin bull, <a href="https://twitter.com/Benaskren/status/1197932649156894730">says</a> he’s buying a Cybertruck.</p>
