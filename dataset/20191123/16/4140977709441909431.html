                      <p>Initially, Crystal Palace was given the goal but soon it was taken away from them as VAR came into the play. In the footage examined by VAR, it was seen that Jordan Ayew pushed Dejan Lovren, which made the Croatian fall on the ground.</p>
                      <p>This was found objectionable by the VAR and after a long delay, the goal was disallowed by the match officials. This certainly infuriated few fans, who thought that Lovren made the most out of the push and it was too soft to deny the goal.</p>

                            <p>Others also claimed that Liverpool is being <a href="https://thesportsrush.com/trent-alexander-arnold-handball-controversy-manchester-city-stunned-after-another-premier-league-var-controversy/">favoured through technology</a>, as it has come to its escape over a minor. Although, even <a href="https://thesportsrush.com/liverpool-var-controversy-roberto-firmino-denied-goal-vs-aston-villa-for-finest-of-margin/">Liverpool became a victim of it against Aston Villa</a>.</p>

                            <p>Nevertheless, with this decision, few fans are once again furious with the technology. On the other side, the first half of the match ended in 0-0, with the second half yet to be played.</p>
