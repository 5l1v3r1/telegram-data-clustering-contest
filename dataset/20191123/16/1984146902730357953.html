      <h2>How James Hunter rated the Sunderland players in their League One clash with Coventry City at the Stadium of Light</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T16:06:15+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 16:06</time> by <a rel="author">James Hunter</a></address>
      <p>Sunderland managed to grab a late equaliser to share the spoils with Coventry City on a turgid afternoon at the Stadium of Light.</p>
      <p>Dom Hyam's goal separated the two sides at the break, with Chris Maguire's sloppy pass leading to the corner which the Sky Blues scored from.</p>
      <p>The Black Cats looked to be heading for a disappointing loss on their own turf, only for substitute Benji Kimpioka to step up with minutes left to coolly slot home inside the box.</p>
      <p>Here's how James Hunter rated the players:</p>
      <p>LEE BURGE 6<br/>Made a couple of good saves to keep Sunderland in the game and could do nothing about the goal<br/><br/>LUKE O’NIEN 6<br/>Got forward down the right and at least looked to get Sunderland on the front foot<br/><br/>JORDAN WILLIS 6<br/>Might have done better for the goal, but made a couple of good blocks to stop Bakayoko killing the game<br/><br/>JOEL LYNCH 6<br/>Less than convincing in the first half, better in the second<br/><br/>DENVER HUME 6<br/>A couple of surging forward runs caused Coventry problems<br/><br/>GEORGE DOBSON 5<br/>Looked to be carrying an injury, struggled to get around the pitch, and gave the ball away numerous times<br/><br/>GRANT LEADBITTER 5<br/>Too many passes went astray, but he did tee up Kimpioka for the equaliser<br/><br/>MAX POWER 5<br/>A poor afternoon for him, and fluffed the one chance that came his way<br/><br/>CHRIS MAGUIRE 4<br/>Everything went wrong for him and his poor backpass led indirectly to the goal Sunderland conceded<br/><br/>WILL GRIGG 5<br/>Put the effort in but did not look like scoring<br/><br/>AIDEN McGEADY 6<br/>Always a threat, and tested the keeper a couple of times<br/><br/>SUBS</p>
      <p>DUNCAN WATMORE 7<br/>For Power 66mins. His pace and willingness to run at defenders changed the game</p>
      <p>TOM FLANAGAN 6<br/>For Willis 68mns. Did well after replacing Willis, who was struggling with an injury</p>
      <p>BENJI KIMPIOKA 7<br/>For Grigg 83mins. In the right place at the right time to score the equaliser – his first league goal<br/><br/><br/>NOT USED: J McLaughlin, Ozturk, McGeouch, De Bock</p>
