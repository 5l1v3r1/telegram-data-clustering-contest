      <h1>US military drone lost over Libyan capital Tripoli</h1>

      <p>The U.S. has said that it lost a military drone over the Libyan capital Tripoli, where months-long fighting is dragging on between warring rivals.</p>
      <p>The remotely piloted aircraft was lost on Thursday, the U.S. Africa Command said early Saturday.</p>
      <p>The incident is being investigated, the command said without details.</p>
      <p>“RPA operations are conducted in Libya to assess the ongoing security situation and monitor violent extremist activity.</p>
      <p>“These operations are critical to counter activity in Libya and are fully coordinated with appropriate government officials,” the command said.</p>
      <p>Libya slid into anarchy after a 2011 armed revolt which toppled long-time dictator Moamer Gaddafi, making the oil-rich country a magnet for militants including Islamic State.</p>
      <p>Libya has at least two rival administrations: a UN-backed government based in Tripoli, and the other based in the eastern city of Tobruk, which is allied with military strongman Khalifa Haftar.</p>
      <p>In April, Haftar ordered a military campaign to seize Tripoli.</p>
      <p>This week, Haftar’s forces said they had downed an Italian drone in western Libya.</p>
