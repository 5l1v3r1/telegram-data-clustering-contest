      <p><a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/warframe/2887"><i>Warframe</i></a><i> </i>players can start work on their flyable, fightable spaceships with the game’s Rising Tide update, <a href="https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1144842-rising-tide-update-261/">available now on PC</a>. They just can’t start, like, flying them until <a href="https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1144842-rising-tide-update-261/"><i>Warframe</i>’s Empyrean expansion arrives</a>, which is looking like early next year.</p>

      <p>First, players must construct a Dry Dock to build the mighty Railjack, the vessel <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/7/8/17545846/warframe-tennocon-2018-fortuna-codename-railjack-videos">revealed back at TennoCon 2018</a>. Working alone or co-operatively, they’ll go through two new missions to acquire the blueprints and six Railjack components needed to build the thing. Upon completion, players will find that they need additional components to start the engines and fly it; those will be provided later — i.e. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/7/6/20684253/warframe-empyrean-expansion-tennocon-2019-demo-details-trailer">when Empyrean launches</a>.</p>
      <p>The update also introduces four new resources to help with ship construction, and players may start collecting them now. Once Empyrean launches, players may use these resources to fit their Railjack with different weapons and upgrades.</p>

      <p>There are <a href="https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1144842-rising-tide-update-261/">more, non-Railjack related additions, changes and fixes</a> in title update 26.1. The Orbiter — the main hub that players may customize — is getting a visual overhaul for starters. Digital Extremes says this might throw off some decorations players hung in the earlier version, but players may reposition them individually, or with a new reset option coming in the update. The visual remake for the Orbiter adds new viewing ports and different lighting:</p>
