      <p>Rajon Rondo has always been a fiery player. That fire of his got him to an early shower on Friday night against the OKC Thunder.</p>
      <p>With about ten minutes late in the 4th quarter, the NBA veteran could be seen hitting Thunder guard Dennis Schroder in the groin and receiving a technical foul.</p>
      <p>He kept arguing with a ref to the point that you could see him call him a “fucking pussy.”</p>
      <p>That’s when he got ejected.</p>

      <p>Lakers still won the game without him.</p>
