      <p>Six teenagers have been arrested, including one under police guard in hospital, following a car chase with KwaZulu-Natal police that ended in a shootout.</p>
      <p>In a statement, theÂ Office of the Provincial Commissioner KwaZulu-Natal said Durban North police became suspicious of a vehicle they spotted on Friday night.</p>
      <p>The occupants were six teenagers, aged 15 and 16. When the officers attempted to pull them over, the driver allegedly sped off, leading to the car chase.</p>
      <p>At Dumisani Makhaye highway, the teenagers allegedly opened fire on the police officers. One of the teens was injured when the police returned fire.</p>
      <p>He was taken to hospital where he remains under police guard.</p>
      <p>The five other teenagers were arrested and taken to the Greenwood Park police station. They have been released into the custody of their parents and have been charged with attempted murder and the illegal possession of firearms and ammunition.</p>
      <p>Officers also confiscated two firearms, according to the statement.</p>
      <p>The teens are expected to appear in the Durban Magistrate's Court on Monday.</p>
