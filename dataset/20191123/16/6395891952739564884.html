      <p><b>HOLYOKE, Mass.Â (AP)</b> - A Massachusetts police department is getting dozens of new bulletproof vests for its officers thanks to a federal grant.</p>
      <p>The Holyoke City Council unanimously accepted the nearly $30,000 Bureau of Justice Assistance grant and approved spending about the same amount from the police department's reserve funds to cover half the cost of buying 47 new vests.</p>
      <p>The custom-fitted vests cost about $1,200 each.</p>
      <p>The department's current equipment is either nearing or has passed its effective lifespan.</p>
      <p>No councilors spoke against the purchase, but some questioned where in the budget the money was coming from. Councilor David Bartley called the vests a "noble cause" but said he was "mystified" that the money was being transferred from the department's reserve cash and not from an equipment line item.</p>
