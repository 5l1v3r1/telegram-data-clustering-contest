      <p>She also shared that she and Casey were unable to come to an agreement on a middle name for their tot.</p>
      <p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.ok.co.uk/celebrity-news/marnie-simpson-baby-name-rox-20927120">OK!</a> , Marnie divulged that she came up with the 'unusual name' but also liked other names like "Columbus, Diego, and Emmett."</p>
      <p>Casey, 24, also revealed to the publication that he put his foot down when Marnie came up with a middle name he thought their child would be mocked for at school.</p>
      <p>He said: "Marnie wanted his middle name to be Star but I had to put my foot down! I thought it was silly. He would have had the p**s taken out of him at school."</p>

      <p>The new parents welcomed the adorable baby on October 29 at 4:18pm weighing 8lbs 1oz.</p>
      <p>She called the process 'traumatic' and revealed she suffered a postpartum haemorrhage and lost two pints of blood.</p>

      <p>The delighted dad penned a touching post dedicated to Marnie and their baby with a photo of their son's tiny hand.</p>
      <p>He wrote alongside it: "Where do I start... after 28 hours of labour my strong amazing princess <a href="https://www.instagram.com/marns/">@marns</a> delivered our gorgeous little man on the 29th October at 4:20pm 8.1!!!</p>
      <p>"My beautiful baby boy was born, I can’t even describe my emotions right now, it’s been a long journey (10 months).</p>
      <p>Watching the person you adore in pain is not nice but the gift we both have right now just wipes away all the bad moments through labour.</p>
      <p>"I literally sit and stair at him non stop with Marnie, he’s the start of our family, he’s so cute!!!"</p>
