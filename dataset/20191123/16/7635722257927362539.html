        <b>Thousands of people braved the rain in County Roscommon today to protest at plans to shut down a local respite centre with the loss of 48 jobs.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The #SaveCuisle Support Group organised the rally to call on the Irish Wheelchair Association to reverse the decision.</p>
      <p>Eileen Finan was among those who turned out to support the rally in the rain.Â She said the whole community is passionately united against the closure.</p>
      <p>"As far as I could make out there were thousands of people there," she said.</p>
      <p>"There were family members of people with disabilities; people themselves with disabilities, business people; people who work in the centre.</p>
      <p>"People of all ages were there in a show of solidarity. Everybody united against this really backward step."</p>
