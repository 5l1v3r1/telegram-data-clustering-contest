      <p>Well, we’re going to make a few half-assed shaken martinis and watch those <i>Trip </i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUOimokeY7s">impressions</a> for a period of mourning. <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/knives-out-trailer-chris-evans-daniel-craig.html">Daniel Craig</a>, who’s portrayed a very handsome <a href="http://www.vulture.com/2019/11/phoebe-waller-bridge-teases-her-james-bond-script.html">James Bond</a> for well over a decade, confirmed on Friday’s <i>Late Show </i>that the upcoming <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/04/bonds-25-news-cast-rami-malek-billy-magnussen.html"><i>No Time to Die</i></a><i> </i>will be his last Bond film. “Yes,” he said. “It’s done.” His next move? Maybe letting himself go a bit: “I think Guinness. Just Guinness. Maybe some solids occasionally.” Craig’s late-night announcement comes hours after he also confirmed the news with German outlet <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/daniel-craig-james-bond-25-no-time-to-die-007-spectre-knives-out-release-date-trailer-a9213181.html"><i>Express</i></a><i>, </i>saying that, while he was “really happy” with the work he did in the franchise, “someone else needs to have a go” at the role. Before you start harassing Idris Elba’s agent with emails, remember, <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2017/09/your-crush-idris-elba-says-hell-never-play-james-bond.html">he’s not interested</a>.</p>
