      <h1>Report: NBA Is Considering “Drastic” Changes To Its Schedule</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T16:42:04+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 16:42</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/chrisrosvoglou" target="_blank">Chris Rosvoglou</a></address>
      <p>For the past year there have been rumors about the NBA making changes to its schedule. Commissioner Adam Silver seems intrigued by the idea of an in-season tournament that’s similar to European soccer.</p>
      <p>The NBA is struggling to produce strong ratings this season. With the league desperately trying to generate buzz around the world, Silver is considering a few changes to their calendar.</p>
      <p>According to ESPN insiders Adrian Wojnarowski and Zach Lowe, the NBA is in serious discussions with the National Basketball Players Association and broadcast partners about making “drastic” changes to its schedule.</p>
      <p>One major change would be reseeding the four conference finalists in the playoffs. Another potential change that’s being considering is the idea of a postseason play-in.</p>
      <p>If these changes actually happen, the NBA would shorten the season to a minimum of 78 games.</p>
      <p>Here are more details on the situation, via <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/28145944/sources-nba-considering-reseeding-conference-finalists-postseason-play-in">ESPN</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>Discussions are progressing with hopes of bringing a vote to the April meeting of the league’s Board of Governors that would introduce some — if not all of these proposals — into the NBA’s 75th anniversary season of 2021-2022, league sources said. The NBA still has work to do coordinating with constituents on the myriad of implications involving the proposed changes.<br/><br/>The reseeding of teams in the semifinal round — based upon regular season record — could give the NBA a championship series that includes its best two teams. The WNBA has been seeding teams in the playoffs without regard to conference for several seasons.</blockquote>
      <p>These changes would go into effect right in time for the 2021-22 season.</p>
      <p>Do you believe these potential changes to the NBA’s schedule would make the season more interesting?</p>
