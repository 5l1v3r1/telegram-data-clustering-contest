      <p>I had the pleasure of sitting down with WWE Hall of Famer <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/mick-foley">Mick Foley</a> this weekend. He was a guest on my <a href="https://www.iheart.com/podcast/1248-no-holds-barred-30550120">radio show</a> in Cincinnati, and we touched on as many topics as I could squeeze into my allotted time. Including his favorite Undertaker story and 'The Fiend' Bray Wyatt using the Mandible Claw. Expect those articles next week, but this is Survivor Series weekend and Foley is hoping for a big showing from one <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/nxt">NXT</a> Superstar.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/rhea-ripley">Rhea Ripley</a> is one of many NXT Superstars that has a very busy weekend ahead of her. First tonight she'll lead her own team into the first ever Women's WarGames Match against Team Baszler. Then Sunday night she'll captain team NXT in the 5 on 5 on 5 Women's Elimination Match at Survivor Series. Mick Foley has a comedy show in Dayton, OH Sunday night, but he can't wait to watch Ripley in action on the WWE Network.</p>
      <blockquote>"I'm really looking forward to see what kind of impression Rhea Ripley makes. She and I have gone back and worth on Twitter a little bit, but I wouldn't be spending time having a Twitter feud with someone who I didn't think very highly of.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>She made such an impression on me at Royal Rumble that I like the idea that this is like... you know the spotlight will be on her, and I hope she lives up to my expectations. I think it's going to be a big weekend for her."</blockquote>
      <p>Foley went on to say he hopes that the WWE Universe gets to see more of Ripley vs. Becky Lynch down the line after they met on NXT this past Wednesday.</p>
