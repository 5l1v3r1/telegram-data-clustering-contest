      <p>But she discovered pornographic images of children from a Russian website on his spare phone when he left it at home in July 2017.</p>
      <p>In a heartbreaking text to her best friend, Lydia said: “I’ve been living with a paedo”.</p>
      <p>She confronted Wells, 27, by text and reported him to police before feeling so “ashamed” that she hanged herself at their home hours later.</p>
      <p>Wells was slapped with a 12-month community order after admitting possessing 31 indecent photographs of children and was ordered to sign the Sex Offender Register for five years, complete 150 hours unpaid work and pay a £85 victim surcharge.</p>
      <p>In an interview with the <i>Mirror UK</i>, Lydia’s devastated mum, Michelle, says she holds “vile” Wells personally responsible for her daughter’s death.</p>

      <p>Wells had found Lydia dead at 3.30 in the morning when he returned home from a night out with friends and colleagues.</p>
      <p>He subsequently appeared at Manchester magistrates court in July 2018 were he admitted possessing 31 indecent photographs of children and was given a 12-month community order.</p>
      <p>He was also ordered to sign the Sex Offender Register for five years, complete 150 hours of unpaid work and pay a £85 victim surcharge.</p>
      <p>Lydia’s mother Michelle has since spoken out about how she holds Wells fully accountable for her daughter’s death.</p>
