      <h1>PSA: A 'Fixed' Android Threat Remains In Hundreds Of Apps</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T16:45:33+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 16:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.lifehacker.com.au/author/chris-jager" target="_blank">Chris Jager</a></address>
      <p>An investigation into Android security by Check Point Software Technologies has uncovered hundreds of apps on the Google Play Store that are vulnerable to attack. This includes high-profile apps like Facebook, Messenger, Yahoo, Wechat and Instagram.</p>
      <p>Researchers at Check Point Software Technologies scanned the Google Play Store for known patterns associated with vulnerable versions of open-source code. It discovered three vulnerabilities of 'critical severity' lurking in hundreds of popular apps.</p>
      <p>What's surprising is that these vulnerabilities are known to have been fixed. Yet they remain present in many Android apps due to the use of outdated code - and updating to the latest version doesn't help matters. As the report explains:</p>
      <blockquote>The common perception consumers have around vulnerabilities is that as soon as they are discovered, theyâ€™re immediately patched, so by updating their device with the latest software, they are keeping it secure. In reality, long-known vulnerabilities may persist even in apps recently published on Google Play.<br/><br/>[These] three vulnerabilities, all fixed over two years ago, make hundreds of apps potentially vulnerable to remote code execution.</blockquote>
      <p>Popular apps known to be affected include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>LiveXLive</li>
        <li>Moto Voice BETA</li>
        <li>Yahoo! Transit</li>
        <li>Yahoo! Browser</li>
        <li>Yahoo! MAP</li>
        <li>Yahoo! Car Navigation</li>
        <li>Facebook</li>
        <li>Messenger</li>
        <li>SHAREit</li>
        <li>Mobile Legends: Bang Bang</li>
        <li>Smule</li>
        <li>JOOX Music</li>
        <li>WeChat</li>
        <li>AliExpress</li>
        <li>Video MP3 Converter</li>
        <li>Lazada</li>
        <li>VivaVideo</li>
        <li>Retrica</li>
        <li>TuneIn</li>
      </ul>
      <p>According to Check Point Software Technologies, these vulnerabilities could allow hackers to steal and alter posts on Facebook or read messages in WeChat, to give just two examples.</p>
      <p>As mentioned above, the problem has to do with outdated, open-source code finding its way into commercial applications. These are typically reusable components written in a low-level language such as C.</p>
      <p>While these vulnerabilities are usually found and fixed in open-source projects, their maintainers have no control over apps using these native libraries. Subsequently, a commercial app may keep using the outdated version of the code even years after the vulnerability is discovered.</p>
      <p>According to Check Point Software Technologies, there's not much the end user can do about these vulnerabilities other than <a href="https://www.lifehacker.com.au/2019/03/how-to-protect-every-device-and-os-with-one-app">follow the usual security precautions</a> and hoping for the best.
