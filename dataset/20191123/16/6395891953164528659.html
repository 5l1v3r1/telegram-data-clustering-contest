      <p><b>HOUSTONÂ (AP)</b> - A Texas fugitive accused of starving his 2-month-old son to death 15 years ago has been extradited from Mexico to face charges.</p>
      <p>Television station KPRC reports that 36-year-old Adrian Castillo was extradited to Houston last week following his arrest in Mexico in May. Jail records show he has been in U.S. custody since Nov. 13.</p>
      <p>According to court documents, Castillo was charged in 2006 with causing injury to a child for the 2004 starvation death of his son, Saul Castillo. He's also charged with jumping bond. The documents note that Castillo isn't a U.S. citizen, but they don't list his native country.</p>
      <p>An attorney listed as Castillo's didn't immediately reply to a Saturday a voicemail seeking comment.</p>
      <p>Castillo is scheduled to appear in court Dec. 10.</p>
