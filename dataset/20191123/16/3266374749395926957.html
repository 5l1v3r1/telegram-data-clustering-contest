        <b>Cesar Azpilicueta returns to the starting lineup, with Jorginho replacing Mason Mount as Chelsea get set to take on Manchester City at the Etihad.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Frank Lampard has made two changes to the side that eased past Crystal Palace last time out as Chelsea prepare to lock horns with Premier League champions Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium.</p>
      <p>The first change comes in defence, with Cesar Azpilicueta replacing Reece James as the Blues’ right-back. Azpilicueta dons the armband for Chelsea, joining Kurt Zouma, Fikayo Tomori and Emerson Palmieri in the back four, with Kepa Arrizabalaga assuming his place in goal.</p>

      <p>The second and final change entails a shift in formation, with Lampard adopting to play the 4-3-3 against Manchester City. Jorginho, who was suspended for the Gameweek 12 clash, is back in the side, with Mason Mount making way. Jorginho is accompanied by N’Golo Kante and Mateo Kovacic in the three-man midfield.</p>
      <p>Mount’s exclusion means Christian Pulisic and Willian are the two wide men, with Tammy Abraham leading the line for Chelsea. Mount will provide the backup option from the bench, as will Michy Batshuayi, Pedro and Olivier Giroud, among others.</p>
      <p><b>Chelsea Starting XI:</b> Kepa; Azpilicueta, Zouma, Tomori, Emerson; Kante, Jorginho, Kovacic; Willian, Abraham, Pulisic</p>
