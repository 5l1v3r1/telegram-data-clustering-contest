      <h1>Deontay Wilder vs Luis Ortiz undercard bout off after Luis Nery failed to make weight</h1>
      <h2>Luis Nery was due to take on Emmanuel Rodriguez on the undercard of Deontay Wilder vs Luis Ortiz</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T16:28:20+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 16:28</time> by <a rel="author">Martin Domin, https://www.facebook.com/mirrorfighting</a></address>
      <p>Luis Nery's clash with Emmanuel Rodriguez has been scrapped after Nery weighed in heavy for the bantamweight bout.</p>
      <p>Nery weighed in just a pound over the 118lb limit on Friday and Rodriguez opted not to go ahead with the fight,</p>
      <p>As a result, the rematch between Leduan Barthelemy and Eduardo Ramirez will be the first fight on the pay-per-view portion of the card headlined by <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/deontay-wilder">Deontay Wilder</a> against Luis Ortiz.</p>
      <p>It is not Nery's first offence after he came in heavy for his rematch with Shinsuke Yamanaka and then requiring an extra hour after doing the same befoe taking on Juan Carlos Payano.</p>

      <p>Mirror Fighting has launched a new weekly boxing show in association with Betfair in which we analyse the latest big fights, play matchmaker, and preview forthcoming bouts.</p>

      <p>Wilder, meanwhile, weighed five pounds more than he did before his first fight with dangerous Cuban Ortiz 18 months ago.</p>
      <p>On that occasion, the world champion survived a huge scare before stopping Ortiz in the 10th round.</p>
      <p>The challenger scaled 236lb, five pounds fewer than the first fight.</p>
      <p>Wilder has said he plans to end the rivalry in a conclusive fashion.</p>
      <p>"I'm the best in the world and I say it with confidence," he said. "With that being said, I have to give the fans what they're hungry for. That's exciting fights. The heavyweight division was in a dark place, but now it's on fire and I must keep it going.</p>
      <p>"Luis Ortiz is one of the best in the world and one of the most dangerous men in boxing. No one in the top 10 has given him an opportunity. They say he's old, but if that's the truth, then one of them should get in there with him.</p>

      <p>"When I look at the landscape of the heavyweight division, this man still wasn't getting an opportunity. It was an amazing fight the first time and I'm going to make adjustments this time. That's what it's all about. I will be at my best Saturday night.</p>
      <p>"I'd rather go through difficulty in the ring than go through my whole career being perfect. What kind of legacy would I have? I want to give you something to remember me by.</p>
      <p>"Luis Ortiz looks good, but I don't think it's going to matter against a fighter like me. I'm in shape 365 days a year. I come to camp in shape. The first day of camp, we were sparring. It's always good to see my opponents in shape and prepared properly for a war. That's all I can ask. Because they know what they're in for when they go against me.</p>
      <p>"This is a great card with great champions and fighters up here. What more could you ask for? Nothing more needs to be said. Now it's time for action. I'm looking forward to giving everyone the best of me.</p>
      <p>"We train very hard to be prepared and go to war. You already know what to expect. The hard part is the waiting. This is what it's all about. I can't wait for Saturday night. My opponent has to be perfect for 12 rounds, and I only have to be perfect for one second."</p>
