      <p>MADRID: Luis Suárez and Arturo Vidal scored second-half goals to lead Barcelona’s recovery in a 2-1 win at last-place Leganés in the Spanish league on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Suárez headed in a pass from Lionel Messi in the 53rd minute to cancel out Youssef En-Nesyri’s opener.</p>
      <p>Substitute Vidal put Barcelona in front after a defensive error with 11 minutes left.</p>
      <p>Leganés was close to taking a point against the defending champions until midfielder Rubén Pérez knocked a corner toward his own net, allowing an unmarked Vidal to tap in the winner.</p>
      <p>The hard-fought victory left Barcelona three points ahead of second-place Real Madrid, which hosts Real Sociedad later. Third-place Atlético Madrid visits Granada.</p>
      <p>Barcelona hosts Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League on Wednesday.</p>
