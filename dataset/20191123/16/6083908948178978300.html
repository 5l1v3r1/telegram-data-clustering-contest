      <h1>Graham Called for State Dept to Release Ukraine Documents. Here's How Biden Responded.</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T16:45:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 16:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://townhall.com/author/bethbaumann" target="_blank">Beth Baumann</a></address>
      <p>Former Vice President Joe Biden (D) sat down with CNN's Don Lemon to discuss the 2020 race. One of the topics that, naturally, came up was impeachment and whether or not Biden should be investigated for corruption related to Ukraine.</p>
      <p>"Let me ask you, because Lindsey Graham now, who you’ve worked with, who was a friend. I know this, video of him saying, 'oh, you are the nicest person he’s ever met and the greatest man' and now he's asking the State Department for documents for you and your son," Lemon said. "What do you say to Lindsey Graham and folks like him?"</p>
      <p>According to Biden, Sen. Lindsey Graham, the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, is going to regret <a href="https://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2019/11/22/lindsey-sends-official-request-for-biden-and-burismarelated-documents-n2556936">asking the State Department</a> for documents on the former vice president and his son, Hunter. </p>
      <p>"They’re asking Lindsey Graham, they have him under their thumb right now. They know he knows if he comes out against Trump he’s got a real tough road for re-election, number one," Biden said.</p>
      <p>But, more than anything, the former vice president is "disappointed" and "angered" by Graham's probe because the two of them were friends.</p>
      <p>"I am disappointed, and quite frankly, I’m angered by the fact he knows me. He knows my son. He knows there’s nothing to this. Trump is now essentially holding power over him that even the Ukrainians wound yield to. The Ukrainians would not yield to 'Investigate Bidens,'" he explained. "There’s nothing to investigate about Biden or his son, and Lindsey is about to go down in a way that I think he’s going to regret his whole life."</p>
      <p>Graham sent his official request to the State Department on Friday. He wants all documents relating to contacts between Vice President Joe Biden, Hunter Biden, other Obama administration officials and Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko.</p>
