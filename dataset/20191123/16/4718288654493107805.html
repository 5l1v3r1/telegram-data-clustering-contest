      <p>Thalaivi is directed by Vinay and co-produced by Vishnu Vardhan Induri and Shaailesh R Singh. Actor Arvind Swamy plays film actor and Jayalalithaa’s political mentor MG Ramachandran in the film.</p>
      <p>“I am excited to show this story of an actor-turned-politician, which is based on one of India’s most loved and followed public figures,” Vishnu, who is also producing 83, said.</p>
      <p>“Thalaivi is a very dear project to all of us as it is a story that needs to be told. And the way, Kangana has slipped into the character, is simply amazing. Can't wait to present this film to the audience."</p>
      <p>Thalaivi is scheduled to release in Hindi, Tamil and Telugu on June 26, 2020. Kangana’s prosthetics for the film are created by Hollywood make-up artist Jason Collins. </p>
