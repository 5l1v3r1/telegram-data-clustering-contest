      </p>
      <p>The information was posted on the website of the United States department of justice (www.justice.gov).</p>
      <p><i>“Onyema allegedly leveraged his status as a prominent business leader and airline executive while using falsified documents to commit fraud,” </i>said U.S. Attorney Byung Pak.</p>
      <p><i>“We will diligently protect the integrity our banking system from being corrupted by criminals, even when they disguise themselves in a cloak of international business,” </i>he added.</p>
      <p><i>“Onyema setup various innocent sounding multi-million dollar asset purchases which were nothing more than alleged fronts for his scam,”</i> said acting special agent in charge Robert Hammer, who oversees HSI operations in Georgia and Alabama.</p>

      <p>The US authorities, however, stated that the indictment only contains charges.</p>
      <p>The defendants are presumed innocent of the charges and it will be the government’s burden to prove the defendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt at trial.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Onyema has denied all the allegations, stating that they are false and are in no way in line with his character as a person and as a business man.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“As the press statement clearly stated, these are indictment that only contains charges. I am innocent of all charges and the US government will find no dirt on me because I have never conducted business with any illegalities.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“Be rest assured that I also have my lawyers on this and these mere allegations will be refuted. I never laundered money in my life, neither have I committed bank fraud anywhere in the world. Every Kobo I transferred to the US for aircraft purchase went through the Central Bank of Nigeria LC regime and all were used for the same purpose.</i>
      </p>
      <p><i>“The American companies that received the funds are still in business. I never took a penny from any US bank or Nigerian bank. I am willing to defend my innocence in the US courts,” </i>he stated.</p>

      <p>Onyema recently became a hero in Nigeria when he volunteered Air Peace aircraft to evacuate some Nigerians in South Africa during the height of xenophobic attacks in the country.</p>
      <p>Nigerians in South Africa had under the auspices of the Nigerian Community Western Cape (NCWC) <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1261172-xenophobia-nigerians-south-africa-air-peace-ceo-allen-onyema-abike-dabiri-erewa.html">expressed their gratitude to Onyema </a>for evacuating Nigerians in that country free of charge.</p>
      <p>The House of Representatives also <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1260209-xenophobia-gbajabiamila-meets-air-peace-ceo-allen-onyema.html">hosted Onyema to a special session to honour him</a> during one of its sittings in Abuja.</p>
