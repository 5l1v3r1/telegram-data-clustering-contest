      <h1>Crystal Palace to make loan move for Liverpool forward Rhian Brewster?</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/crystal-palace/"><b>Crystal Palace</b></a> have reportedly identified <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/liverpool/"><b>Liverpool</b></a> striker <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/rhian-brewster/"><b>Rhian Brewster</b></a> as a potential January signing.</h2>

      <p>Despite penning a long-term deal with the Merseyside giants, Brewster has barely featured during the opening three-and-a-half months of the campaign.</p>
      <p>While the 19-year-old has been a part of the travelling group for away fixtures, the young Englishman has been limited to just two starts in the EFL Cup.</p>
      <p>According to <i>Football Insider</i>, Palace have made contact with Liverpool about handing Brewster more senior minutes during the second half of the season.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jordan-ayew/"><b>Jordan Ayew</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/christian-benteke/"><b>Christian Benteke</b></a> are currently competing for one role in attack, with the former contributing four goals from 11 outings in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>However, that is unlikely to stop <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/roy-hodgson/"><b>Roy Hodgson</b></a> from attempting to sign a new frontman at the beginning of 2020.</p>
