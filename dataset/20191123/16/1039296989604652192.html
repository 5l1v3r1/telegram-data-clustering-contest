      <h1>Automobili Pininfarina CEO labels Tesla Cybertruck design a 'PR stunt'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T16:44:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 16:44</time> by <a rel="author">Amaan Ahmed</a></address>
      <p>Michael Perschke, CEO of Automobili Pininfarina, says the polarising design of Tesla’s pick-up truck is only meant to get the world talking, and bets the production model will look nothing like it.</p>
      <p>It came as no surprise that the Tesla Cybertruck's unveil event yesterday attracted attention from all over the world – who can look away when the enigmatic Elon Musk is on stage? However, the unveil of the Cybertruck attracted even more attention than you’d expect for two reasons – the 'armoured' glass shattering in a failed demonstration and, of course, because of how the Cybertruck looks. Tesla’s pick-up was turned into a meme and trended worldwide on Twitter all day. Scores of people found the Cybertruck’s appearance unpalatable, and now, the pick-up's design has drawn sharp remarks from a prominent figure in the automotive industry.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>In a frank and elaborate post on his social media, Michael Perschke, CEO of Automobili Pininfarina, labelled the design of the Tesla Cybertruck unveiled on November 22 a 'PR stunt'. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“Here is my bet: the shown Tesla truck will not look like this – it is a PR stunt to maximise the viral effect and by polarising and thereby getting even more PR mileage”, said Perschke in his post.</p>
      <p>Looping EV manufacturer and Tesla rival Rivian (and its founder RJ Scaringe) into the conversation, Perschke said the team at Rivian has “better taste” for making beautiful pick-up trucks. For the uninitiated, Rivian has unveiled the R1T pick-up truck as well as the R1S SUV. Also worth noting is the fact that Pininfarina will use Rivian's skateboard platform for its upcoming SUV, the PF1.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>But Perschke didn’t stop there. He went on to promise a “free test drive” of the Pininfarina Battista electric hypercar if the production-spec Cybertruck looks like the one showcased at the unveil, though it’s unclear if Perschke is addressing Musk with this bet.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Concluding his post, Perschke suggested Tesla “ask Pininfarina to help” it design a more beautiful pick-up truck. Shots fired indeed, and we’ll wait and see if Perschke and Automobili Pininfarina decide to take on Musk's radical-looking Cybertruck with a luxury, electric 'hypertruck' of their own.</p>
