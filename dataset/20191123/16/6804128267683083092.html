      <h1>Crystal Palace player ratings: Errors cost Eagles after Wilfried Zaha torments Liverpool</h1>
      <h2>Liverpool came away 2-1 victors against Crystal Palace to continue their impressive start after some VAR controversey and some late goals.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T16:59:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 16:59</time> by <a rel="author">Scott Trotter</a></address>
      <h3>Vicente Guaita</h3>
      <p>Was quick of his line to sweep up some early danger and was as authoritative for the rest of the match. His hand wasn't strong enough to palm Sadio Mane's shot wide. 7.</p>
      <h3>Joel Ward</h3>
      <p>Put in a very solid display and was relatively untroubled for most of the time he spent on the pitch. Had to go off with an injury. 6.</p>
      <h3>James Tomkins</h3>
      <p>Great block 10 minutes in to deny Sadio Mane what looked a certain goal. Had a stellar first half display and would have deserved the goal had it not being ruled out by VAR. Perhaps had a chance to clear the ball before it reached Mane for Liverpool's first goal. 6.</p>
      <h3>Gary Cahill</h3>
      <p>Headed over a decent chance in the first half but was generally as solid as ever other than in Palace's awful attempts to clear the ball before Liverpool's winner. 5</p>
      <h3>Patrick van Aanholt</h3>
      <p>Put some good pressure on Trent Alexander-Arnold early doors to earn a corner and help to set a tone in the first period. Was found wanting in defence a couple of times and had an opportunity to clear the ball before Roberto Firmino's goal. 4.</p>
      <h3>Cheikhou Kouyate</h3>
      <p>Once again showed his ability when carrying the ball and had a really good battle in the centre of the park. Quieter after Virgil van Dijk stood on his foot as they both landed from a header. 6</p>
      <h3>Luka Milivojevic</h3>
      <p>Produced some good deliveries from the set piece and was composed when receiving the ball deep in the Palace half. 6.</p>
      <h3>James McArthur</h3>
      <p>Disciplined performance from the Eagles' workhorse. 6.</p>
      <h3>Andros Townsend</h3>
      <p>Determined and relentless effort from the winger who looked to take advantage of an Andrew Robertson just returning from injury. A few good efforts from range but perhaps looked once too often in the end. A very good performance though. 7.</p>
      <h3>Wilfried Zaha</h3>
      <p>Lively display and consistently caused Alexander-Arnold problems. The Eagles were regularly able to engage the Ivory Coast winger into the game and looked better for it. Took an advantage of a small pocket of space to score his first goal of the season at a crucial moment. 7</p>
      <h3>Jordan Ayew</h3>
      <p>Missed a perfect opportunity to give the Eagles the lead early on but it was promising to see the forward in the box much more often. His push perhaps cost Palace their goal but otherwise was generally solid. 5.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Substitutes</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Martin Kelly</b>: Got forward well in the time he was on the pitch. 6.</p>
      <p><b>Jeffrey Schlupp</b>: Produced a decent shot on goal barely a minute after coming on. 6.</p>
      <p><b>Christian Benteke</b>: His acrobatic bicycle kick went just wide and looked to cause problems in the Liverpool defence. The Belgian created the opportunity for Zaha's goal with some composed play in the Reds' box. 7.</p>
