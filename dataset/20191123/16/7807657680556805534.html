      <p><a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-launches-xbox-one">Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</a> is an Xbox One, PC, and PlayStation 4 game that features exploration and a lot of Dark Souls-like combat. There are a lot of challenging bosses in the game, but Taron Malicos on Dathomir is one of the worst. He's a former Jedi who's completely lost his mind.</p>
      <p>There's no easy way to say this, but Taron Malicos may be the hardest boss fight in Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order because he has a variety of moves. What did you expect though, because you're going against a former Jedi Master? He'll lunge at you, throw boulders, throw his lightsabers, and dodge your heavy blows. I'm probably forgetting a couple of other moves that are unblockable.</p>
      <p>It took me around 6 hours to beat this boss because I wasn't doing enough damage. Before you take on Taron Malicos, be sure to unlock the "Increase All Lightsaber Damage" skill for 3 points. You'll find it at the very top of the skill tree. This will help you deal double the damage and kill this boss in around 2 minutes. If you don't do this, this fight is impossible on Jedi Grandmaster difficulty because the longer Taron Malicos stays alive, the more deadly moves he employs. You may end up wasting hours and hours like me because your strikes barely scratch him.</p>

      <p>Taron Malicos has a number of attacks you need to be aware of. You can block almost all of them, except the ones where he turns red and jumps in the air. Instead of rolling back, try sidestepping these. Additionally, try to stay close to him because if you wander too far, he'll throw boulders at you. Lastly, use the double-bladed lightsaber because only striking him twice, quickly with a lightsaber disrupts his scissor-like attack. The video tells you exactly what you need to do. You have to drain his stamina first and then launch a powerful attack by pressing Left Bumper and X.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/xbox-one-x">Xbox One X</a> version features a 1440p 30 frames per second (FPS) mode and a 1080p 60 FPS mode. In order to tighten up the controls, you should engage the Performance option. Hopefully, this guide helped you if you were struggling to take down this fearsome beast.</p>

      <p>Hopefully, this guide helped you get through this challenging battle. Keep in mind that this boss was defeated on Jedi Grandmaster difficulty. If you chose another setting, the fight is much easier because Taron Malicos does less damage.</p>
