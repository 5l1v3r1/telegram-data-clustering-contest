      <h1>Urban Meyer Has Ominous Message For Penn State’s Players</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T16:06:05+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 16:06</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>Just a few hours before they were scheduled to kick off, Ohio State and Penn State players decided to get the party started a little early.</p>
      <p>Over an hour before kickoff, players from both teams met a mid-field to share their distaste for one another. Although nothing really came of the skirmish, it highlights how important today’s game is – especially for the Nittany Lions.</p>
      <p>During the pre-game festivities, FOX Sports’ Big Noon Kickoff broadcast from just outside the stadium. Former Ohio State head coach Urban Meyer watched as his former players jawed with Penn State’s players before the game.</p>
      <p>He had a simple message for the Nittany Lions: “Be careful what you wish for.”</p>

      <p>Ohio State is a heavy favorite in this afternoon’s game. In fact, the Buckeyes are the heaviest favorite (as a top-10 team) over a top-10 team since Alabama faced off against Texas A&amp;M in 2016.</p>
      <p>Can the Nittany Lions pull off the upset? Urban Meyer doesn’t think so.</p>
