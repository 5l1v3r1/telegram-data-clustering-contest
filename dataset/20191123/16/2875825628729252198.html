      <p>Andy Gray has stuck his neck on the line with his prediction that Jose Mourinho will lead <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> to the Champions League final this season.</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> and <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> boss took the reins at Spurs after the board sacked Mauricio Pochettino last Tuesday, and guided them to a 3-2 victory in his first match in charge against <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> .</p>
      <p>Son Heung-min, Lucas Moura and Harry Kane were all on the scoresheet for Spurs before the Hammers battled back in the second half through Michail Antonio and Angelo Ogbonna.</p>
      <p>Gray spoke out about the immediate impact Mourinho has had at Tottenham, with the north London club winning their first match on the road since January under the Portuguese.</p>
      <p>And the Scot has predicted that Mourinho will match Pochettino's achievement of last season, by taking Spurs all the way to to the Champions League final.</p>

      <p>Gray told <a href="https://twitter.com/beINSPORTS_EN/status/1198217921304002560">beIN SPORTS:</a> "I'm going to make a statement here, I wouldn't be surprised if he [Mourinho] takes them back to the Champions League final this year. I am telling you.</p>
      <p>"If they beat Olympiacos in midweek then they can forget it till February.</p>
      <p>"When February comes around he'll have been there for a while and this is pretty much the team that got to the final last year. With Mourinho, stranger things have happened.</p>
      <p>"We can revisit this in six months."</p>
      <p>Mourinho praised his side's performance after the match, telling the press: "It was very very important. 11 months without music in the away dressing room, without a smile or happiness.</p>

      <p>"They did it. I am very happy for them and with them. If someone only saw the result they'd have thought it was very difficult for us.</p>
      <p>"But it was probably closer to a 4-0 than 3-1. I think my players paid the price of a very difficult week. International break, change of manager, new guy, different training sessions."</p>
