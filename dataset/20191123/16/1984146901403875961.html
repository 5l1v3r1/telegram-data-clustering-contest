      <h1>How shoppers braved the winds and rain to visit Newcastle's shops and Christmas market</h1>
      <h2>Shoppers wrapped up warm as thousands did their Christmas shopping in the city centre despite the wind and rain</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T16:28:54+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 16:28</time> by <a rel="author">Lisa Hutchinson</a></address>
      <p>Thousand of Christmas shoppers braved the weather as winds and rain swept the region.</p>
      <p>The Met Office put out a <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/north-east-weather">yellow weather warning</a> covering the North East, which is in place until midnight on Saturday. But it didn't dampen shoppers' festive spirits.</p>
      <p>As maximum temperatures reached just 9°C, it didn’t stop consumers from wrapping up warm to head out.</p>
      <p>The rain began in the early hours of the morning with experts saying it could cause potential flooding to homes and businesses, power cuts and travel disruption.</p>
      <p>The warning affects areas in the region including  <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-city-centre">Newcastle</a> , Northumberland, Durham, Gateshead, North Tyneside and  <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/south-tyneside">South Tyneside.</a></p>

      <p>And our ChronicleLive photographer was out snapping those who had descended on the shops and <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/christmas">Christmas</a> market in Newcastle.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/traffic-travel">Drivers</a> were also stuck in long queues to get to the city centre car parks before heading out to stock up for the festive season.</p>
      <p>Although umbrellas were up, the wet <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-weather">weather</a> didn't stop cash from crossing the tills.</p>
      <p>The bleak weather is set to continue tonight with the Met Office saying: “Wet and somewhat breezy to start the night, but the rain will clear with winds easing. This will leave a cloudy and misty night with drizzle and fog on hills. Minimum temperature 5 °C.”</p>
      <p>While Sunday’s weather is “a misty and cloudy day with some outbreaks of drizzle, and fog mainly on hills. Isolated cloud breaks may give some limited brighter spells. Maximum temperature 10°C.”</p>
      <p>Next week looks a little better with brighter spells as showers and winds lighten.</p>
      <p>The Met Office says the outlook for Monday to Wednesday is “breezy Monday, with morning rain clearing to scattered showers. Tuesday probably brighter with some showers and light winds. Further wind and rain early Wednesday clearing to scattered showers once again.”</p>
