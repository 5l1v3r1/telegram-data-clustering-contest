      <h1>EXCLUSIVE: Doctor's Mistake Paralyzed Me - Jubilee MP</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T16:56:05+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 16:56</time> by <a rel="author">John Paul Simiyu</a></address>
      <p>
        <b>David Ole Sankok was nominated to the National Assembly by Jubilee Party to represent people with disabilities (PWDs).</b>
      </p>
      <p>Sankok told <a href="https://www.kenyans.co.ke/">Kenyans.co.ke</a> on Friday, November 22, that he endured intense suffering and hopelessness after he lost his leg due a doctor's negligence.</p>
      <p>"It happened in 1988 while in Class Six and twelve years old. I suffered pneumonia and was rushed to a local private hospital, where a doctor made a wrong diagnosis - examined me and injected the lower inner quarter of my gluteus maximus muscle, therefore, tempering my sciatic nerve, paralyzing my right leg, which l later lost," he stated.</p>

      <p>"I was in Kijabe and the doctor was a white man. He told me to learn how to use the crutches because I would be using them for the rest of my life. The news caught me flatfooted, because coming from a pastoralist community that depended on physical strength, I felt like my life had come to an end," he revealed.</p>
      <p>The torture did not end there for him, as things got worse when he returned to school, where he intimated he had been a consistently poor performer and a bully.</p>
      <p>His fellow students took advantage of his new situation to mock him and revenge on the suffering he had caused them.</p>
      <p>"One naughty student snatched my crutches one day and disappeared with them and it was late in the evening. I was not used to crawling yet, so I was forced to spend the night in class. I had to project urine through the window," he recounted.</p>
      <p>He narrated that not so long after, he had another terrible episode when his crutches broke as he was grazing his father's herd.</p>
      <p>"It was around noon when I took cows to the river. Nobody was around, because we used to graze on huge community lands and bushes spread out over a long distance," he remembered.</p>
      <p>The accident rendered him immobile but the cows, knowing their way home, went to the river, drank water and returned home to his angry parents who thought that he had wandered off and had left the animals on their own.</p>

      <p>He was forced to crawl all the way home, a distance of close to three kilometres, risking attack by marauding wild animals that would have taken advantage of his vulnerability.</p>
      <p>"My parents and other villagers were shocked when they found me. My trousers and shirts were soaked in blood from crawling through the rocky terrain," he revealed.</p>
      <p>While he has nothing much to complain about his state at the moment, he admitted that the past was <a href="https://www.kenyans.co.ke/news/32046-day-dp-ruto-shed-tears-over-mp-ole-sankoks-story">rough for him</a> before he came to terms with his situation.</p>
