        <b>Neither goal was particularly pretty, and nor was the performance, but Liverpool once again found a way to win, beating <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/crystal-palace">Crystal Palace</a> 2-1.</b>

      <h3>Crystal Palace 1-2 Liverpool</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/premier-league">Premier League</a> (13), Selhurst Park<br/>Saturday,</p>
      <h3>Goals</h3>
      <p><b>Mane</b> 49′ (assist: Robertson)<br/>Zaha 82′<br/><b>Firmino</b> 85′</p>
      <hr/>
      <p><a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/mohamed-salah/">Mo Salah</a> was deemed only fit for the bench due to his ongoing ankle issue, meaning a start for <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/alex-oxlade-chamberlain/">Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain</a>, with <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/sadio-mane/">Sadio Mane</a> starting on the right of the Reds’ attack.</p>
      <p>As you’d imagine from a side managed by Roy Hodgson, Palace sat deep and organised, meaning Liverpool had plenty of the ball early on but little to show for it.</p>
      <p>Indeed, it was Palace who had the best chance of a scrappy opening half-hour, with Jordan Ayew failing to hit the target after a poor ball from <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/trent-alexander-arnold/">Trent Alexander-Arnold</a> had given the hosts the opportunity.</p>
      <p>VAR came to Liverpool’s rescue just before half-time when James Tomkins headed in from close range after a free-kick that was conceded by Alexander-Arnold out wide, but it was ruled out for a push on <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/dejan-lovren/">Dejan Lovren</a> in the box.</p>
      <p>Half-time ended in a stalemate, with Liverpool yet to have managed a shot on target.</p>

      <hr/>
      <p>Mane had a superb chance early in the second half after being put through by <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/jordan-henderson/">Jordan Henderson</a>, but his placed shot was poor and off-target… a minute later, though, Mane’s scuffed shot stumbled over the line to open the scoring.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/roberto-firmino/">Roberto Firmino</a> had the best chance to make it two, but his poked effort was tipped around the post by Guita in the Palace goal.</p>
      <p>Palace offered little attacking threat, opting to bring on former Liverpool man Christian Benteke for the final 15 minutes in an attempt to change that – and he had an overhead kick as his first touch of the ball but thankfully his acrobatic effort went just wide.</p>
      <p>And it was Benteke who created the problems that led to Palace’s equaliser in the 83rd minute, ending with Wilfried Zaha finishing past <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/alisson/">Alisson</a>.</p>
      <p>It meant another game without a clean sheet, with just two in the opening 13 league games of this season.</p>
      <p>Once again, though, this Liverpool side found a way, <i>any</i> way, to win. Firmino hit home from close range off a messy corner in the 85th minute.</p>

      <p>It was a nervy finish, with five minutes added time, but Zaha blasted a brilliant chance high over the bar and Liverpool held on for another vital three points.</p>
