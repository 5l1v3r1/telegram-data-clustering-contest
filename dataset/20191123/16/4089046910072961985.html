      <p>"The bag, the jewelry, the makeup, that was probably anywhere between $700 and $800 in total," Shayna Bryan said.</p>
      <p>A Wag! walker was captured on Bryan's home surveillance, and is even seen trying to swipe a winter coat worth thousands.</p>
      <p>The dogs she was supposed to be walking stand by, but they weren’t the only ones watching.</p>
      <p>"I immediately sounded the alarm because I was watching it live on my video camera,” Bryan said.</p>
      <p>Bryan says she notified police and after trying to contact Wag! three times, she posted the video on social media.</p>
      <p>"It took five days and basically <a href="https://www.facebook.com/shayna.bryan/videos/10214767883645851">a Facebook post going viral</a> before they would respond, which was really disappointing and frustrating because I thought they would make something like this a top priority,” Bryan said.</p>
      <p>WCBS spoke to Wag! representatives who said they have a vetting process for their walkers that includes a criminal background check, Social Security number trace and a facial recognition check.</p>
      <p>"It's not going to show on your background check if you've never done it before,” Bryan said.</p>
      <p>Wag! said they're working directly with police on the investigation, refunded Bryan for the walk and deactivated the walker's account.</p>
      <p>Bryan may not be able to recover her losses.</p>
      <p>"They said I need to provide receipts for anything that was stolen, so If I don't have receipts, I may not get reimbursed,” she said.</p>
      <p>Bryan wants others to be cautious of apps like Wag!</p>
      <p>"I would say find a trustworthy person and find someone that you actually know and can get their full information because I don't even know this woman's full information,” Bryan said.</p>
