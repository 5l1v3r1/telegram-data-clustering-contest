      <h1>(Video) Sadio Mane’s perfect finish puts the Reds in front at Selhurst Park</h1>

      <p>Sadio Mane put the Reds in front at Selhurst Park with a superb finish having been found inside the box by Andy Robertson today.</p>
      <p>It was the first shot on target from Jurgen Klopp’s men in the game and it was a scruffy goal, which nicked both posts before trickling over the line, but it’s another assist for the left-back and another goal for the Senegalese winger.</p>
      <p>Watch it below courtesy of Premier Sport’s footage:</p>
      <blockquote>⚽| Sadio Mane goal. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/LFC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#LFC</a> <a href="https://t.co/r0djzdIZm7">pic.twitter.com/r0djzdIZm7<br/></a>— The Kopite (@TheKopiteOFF) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheKopiteOFF/status/1198272929101942785?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 23, 2019</a></blockquote>
      <p>Having survived a <a href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/2019/11/23/video-the-push-on-lovren-that-meant-var-disallowed-palace-goal/">goal for the hosts being disallowed by VAR in the first half</a>, the Reds got themselves in front in the game just minutes after the restart.</p>
