      <p>Etinosa however, wasted no time in checking her.</p>
      <p>She responded:<i> "@fungirljessica sweetheart, with my fatness I got a successful career, a Benz GL500 2015, a home in PHC another home in Abuja loading, a family who loves me unconditionally and a Man who loves and supports me unconditionally. Normally I won't even reply you cos I only reply positive comments these days but I had to write this here for any other woman who will feel ashamed of her body or lose confidence because of comments like this. Someone out there needs to read that fat people and slim people are perfect as long as we are healthy. Shame on you for this!"</i></p>
