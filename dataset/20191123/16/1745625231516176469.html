      <p>Pro golfer Paige Spiranac wowed her 2 million Instagram followers with yet another sizzling shot — this time while wearing a skintight gray athleisure top and a pair of joggers that showcased her killer curves.</p>
      <p>She posted the picture to plug her new YouTube channel, in which she said her new video would cover her favorite golf courses in the world. The athlete has played on courses from Hawaii to Dubai, and often posts pictures of the gorgeous locations for her fans to see.</p>
      <p>This time, however, Paige decided to keep the focus strictly on herself by posing in front of a hunter green building with only some trees and the blue sky in the background. The location was tagged as the Myrtle Beach Golf Course.</p>
      <p>For the occasion, the blond beauty wore a medium-gray skintight tank top that hugged her curves in all the right places. The top featured a halter-style neckline, giving her shoulders free motion for swinging her driver, as well as a sporty racerback accent. The tank top also appeared to be cropped right around Paige’s bellybutton.</p>
      <p>Meeting the tank top was a pair of light gray joggers. They were high-waisted to emphasize the stunner’s hourglass figure, and they expertly clung to the beauty’s perky posterior. Though they were joggers, they were nonetheless so tight that they looked like yoga pants at first glance.</p>
      <p>They tapered at the ankle to better show off Paige’s white, mint green and blue Nike sneakers.</p>
      <p>Paige posed at a sideways angle to the camera to showcase the curve of her bust and derriere. She bent one leg forward to add some sultriness to the shot and gently rested her left hand on her upper thigh.</p>
      <p>She wore her blond locks in a simple braid and kept her makeup in a neutral palette with a coat of mascara and a light brick lip.</p>
      <p>At the pro athlete’s feet was her trusty iron, along with a baseball cap. It was embroidered with a skull icon — but instead of crossed bones beneath, it featured clever crossed tees.</p>

      <p>The picture quickly racked up over 72,000 likes and close to 1,000 comments.</p>
      <p>“Can anyone concentrate with you on the course? Jeez,” one lovestruck fan teased, with the see-no-evil monkey and a heart-eye emoji.</p>
      <p>“Not sure if my golf game would improve or suffer playing with you,” joked a second, with a winking face and heart-eye emoji.</p>

      <p>“Amazing woman,” gushed a third, with three fire emoji.</p>
      <p>“Perfect girl,” echoed a fourth.</p>

      <p>Paige appears to be a fan of light gray athleisure wear. As covered by <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/5744853/paige-spiranac-snake/"><i>The Inquisitr</i></a>, the blond beauty almost wore identical gray bottoms in an update just a week ago — though this time, they were yoga pants.</p>
