      <p>The critical point where the excitement levels drop is looking at the motion poster. It is very well cut, highlighting the two contrasting sides of the life of Jayalalitha. The actor segment is done well, even though it might come across as hyper. But, it is the political look where tacky looking make up is raising concerns among the movie lovers. It looks alright in the poster where there is less Kangana resemblance, but when seen visually it doesn’t seem that enticing.</p>
      <p>The original image of <a href="https://www.mirchi9.com/bollywood/kangana-ranaut-gets-clean-chit-from-director-prakash-kovelamudi/">Kangana Ranaut</a> could be a factor here. The actress is lean, and that is the general perception we have in mind. When seen in that prosthetic, it looks unnatural. It is in this aspect Vidya Balan could have scored over her.</p>
      <p>Check out the motion poster below. Aravind Swamy plays the role of MG Ramachandran in the biopic. GV Prakash provides music. Thalaivi will hit screens worldwide on June 26th, 2020.</p>
