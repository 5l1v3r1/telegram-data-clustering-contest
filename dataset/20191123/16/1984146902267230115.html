        <figcaption>The story behind THAT banner at Villa Park - and the rivalry that followed</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Newcastle United travel to Aston Villa in excellent fettle as they find themselves in the top six of the Premier League's form table.</p>
      <p>It could be argued that the Magpies had the momentum going into the international break and they have also had to wait over the weekend as other teams get back into the swing of things.</p>
      <p>Will the break work in their favour or not?</p>
      <p>But <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Newcastle</a> will feel confident after two successive wins with Steve Bruce's return to Villa Park setting up an interesting clash.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Lee Ryder's prediction</b>
      </p>
      <p>United are 13/5 to get the victory at Villa Park and go in against a newly promoted outfit who have lost their last two games against Liverpool and Wolves.</p>
      <p>Newcastle have been relying on defenders to get the goals for them but Villa could be in trouble if this is the game when it clicks for Allan Saint-Maximin, Joelinton and Miguel Almiron.</p>
      <p>If the extra two days rest works in United's favour it could be a long night for Villa.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Referee</b>
      </p>
      <p>Lee Mason (Lancashire)</p>
      <p>First game for Mason in charge of a Newcastle game since the 3-2 win over Everton back in March.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Charity bet</b>
      </p>
      <p>United to get 2-3 corners in the second half at 5/4 with William Hill.</p>
