      <p>The Brazilians made two changes from their loss to Arrows before the FIFA break, with Gaston Sirino returning from injury while Hlompho Kekana was recalled back to the starting line-up.</p>
      <p>Sundowns were fighting to draw first blood in the early exchanges and they got their wish in the 11th minute after Kekana glanced home a header after getting on the end Lyle Lakay's set-piece.</p>
      <p>Steve Komphela's army were finding their rhythm around the half-hour mark with Knox Mutizwa guilty of missing a clear chance, but they were punished with nine minutes remaining of the first stanza as Sirino pounced on a goal-mouth scramble at the far post to give Masandawana a two-goal lead.</p>
      <p>The pace of the game slowed down in the closing minutes of the first stanza, but the Brazilians should have went to the break with a three-goal lead after Lakay went clear on goal inside the box but he scuffed his effort wide.</p>
      <p>After a slow start to the second half, Komphela made a double change after the hour-mark, with Nduzuzo Sibiya coming on for Seth Parusnath and Michael Gumede for Lindokuhle Mtshali to add numbers in attack.</p>
      <p>Gumede had a great chance to pull a goal back for the hosts with 14 minutes remaining after going through inside the box but goalkeeper Kennedy Mweene produced a crucial save.</p>
      <p>Sibiya was not to be denied five minutes later, after he slotted home on the far side from Mutizwa's cross to make a nervy finish to the game, although replays did suggest Mutizwa was offside in the build-up.</p>
      <p>There was further trouble for Sundowns in the last six minutes as they were reducd to ten men after Sirino was red-carded for a studs up challenge on Mathiane.</p>
      <p>Arrows came close to snatching a dramatic equaliser through Danny Phiri's strike but the visitors survived to book a spot in the final, where they will meet the winner of between Maritzburg United and Kaizer Chiefs.</p>
