      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/tottenham-hotspur-fc/">Tottenham</a> boss <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jose-mourinho/">Jose Mourinho</a> was full of praise for Dele Alli after the midfielder’s Man of the Match display in Spurs’ 3-2 win against <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/west-ham-united-fc/">West Ham</a> United.</p>
      <p>Goals from Heung-Min Son, Lucas Moura and Harry Kane ensured Spurs kicked off the Mourinho era with three points and their first victory on the road in the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/premier-league/">Premier League</a> since last January.</p>
      <p>While goals from Angelo Ogbonna and Michail Antonio meant it was a nervous finish, there were still plenty of positives for Spurs and none more so than the performance of Alli.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old has been out of form in the last 18 months but he was reinstated to an attacking midfield position at the London Stadium and he provided the assist for Son to score the opener.</p>
      <p>But Alli’s afternoon got even better when he produced a stunning piece of skill to keep the ball in play for Spurs’ second goal.</p>

      <p>Mourinho was stood just yards from Alli when he executed the skill and he said it was an ‘amazing’ piece of creativity that was only possible because of the midfielder’s desire.</p>

      <p>‘It was just in front of me,’ said Mourinho.</p>
      <p>‘The skill is amazing but for me what is more amazing is the mental thing in relation to that. You only do that if you’re focused, if you’re committed, if you’re ultra-confident.</p>
      <p>‘If not you give up, when you have bad feelings or sadness you don’t do that piece of skill. It’s amazing but it only comes when from the emotional point of view everything is positive so fantastic. I’m really, really happy.’</p>
      <p>Mourinho had just three training sessions with his new side before taking charge today but his effect was clear on Alli, who produced his best performance in almost 18 months in a Tottenham shirt.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, Serge Aurier and Son also impressed but Mourinho was most pleased with Alli, who he said performed like the ‘old Alli’.</p>

      <p>‘I think Dele was like the rest of the team. He was brilliant for 60-65 minutes and then he paid the price for the tiredness,’ said Mourinho.</p>
      <p>‘He went a little bit down but I think he was the old Dele Alli. The Dele Alli of a couple of years ago that impressed not just England but the world. He did exactly what I wanted him to do.</p>

      <p>‘In two days of world, important selection of information to make clear to him exactly the space we wanted him to play both offensively and defensively. Intelligent football player to understand what we wanted and very important for the team. Really pleased with his performance.’</p>
