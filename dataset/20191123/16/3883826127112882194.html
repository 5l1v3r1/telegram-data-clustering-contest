        <b>Sir Stephen Cleobury, who directed the choir at King's College Cambridge for nearly four decades, has died aged 70.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The British conductor, organist and composer presided over the world-famous <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b018xqcv">Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols</a> broadcast live on BBC radio on Christmas Eve.</p>
      <p>He also conducted a number of other ensembles including the BBC Singers.</p>
      <p>The Provost at King's College, Professor Michael Proctor, said it was a "truly sad day".</p>
      <p>"The college community, and indeed many around the world, are mourning his passing with a profound feeling of loss," he added.</p>
      <p>Sir Stephen died in his hometown, York, on Friday after a long illness, King's said.</p>
      <p>The college will host a memorial service for him later in the academic year.</p>
      <p>Sir Stephen retired as director of music at King's just two months ago after 37 years in the role.</p>

      <p>The musical director helped to build the world-renowned Christmas Eve carol service held in King's College Chapel, founding the tradition of an annual new commissioned carol.</p>
      <p>Since 1984, this has made an invaluable contribution to contemporary carol writing, according to the college.</p>
      <p>The service is broadcast live on Radio 4 and the World Service on 24 December. A separate pre-recorded service Carols from King's is broadcast at Christmas on BBC television.</p>
      <p>Sir Stephen also introduced the annual festival Easter at King's, and a series of performances throughout the year, Concerts at King's.</p>
      <p>He was influential in the musical world beyond the choir, conducting a number of ensembles including the Academy of Ancient Music and the BBC Singers, and through his association with the Cambridge University Musical Society.</p>
      <p>Prior to Sir Stephen's tenure at King's, he held key posts at Westminster Abbey and Westminster Cathedral.</p>
      <p>In 2019, he was knighted in the Queen's Birthday Honours for services to choral music.</p>
      <p>King's College choir was founded by King Henry VI in 1441 and is regarded as one of the world's finest choral groups.</p>
      <p>It comprises the conductor and 16 boy choristers, who are educated on scholarships at King's College School, as well as 14 choral scholars and two organ scholars, who study a variety of subjects in the college.</p>
      <p>The choir's Christmas Eve performance was introduced in 1918 and has been broadcast also every year since 1928.</p>
