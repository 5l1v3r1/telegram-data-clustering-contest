      <h1>Crystal Palace 1-2 Liverpool: 5 talking points as Reds edge another tight victory</h1>
      <h2>Liverpool maintained their lead at the top of the table with an eventful victory at Selhurst Park, where second half strikes from Sadio Mane and Roberto Firmino plus a VAR intervention won the day</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T16:53:18+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 16:53</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/mark-jones/</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool enjoyed another tight victory in their title challenge as two of their forwards plus VAR came to their rescue at Selhurst Park.</p>
      <p>The Reds enjoyed a let off when James Tomkins' first half header from a free-kick was disallowed after the VAR judged Jordan Ayew to have fouled Dejan Lovren.</p>
      <p>Sadio Mane's strike then put the visitors ahead early in the second half, before Wilfried Zaha looked to have earned Palace a point with a leveller.</p>
      <p>However, Roberto Firmino fired home after a corner wasn't cleared to win it with just five minutes remaining.</p>
      <p>Here are the game's talking points.</p>
      <h3>1. The real problem with VAR</h3>

      <p>In the age of VAR then Ayew should have known better than to raise his hands towards Lovren's back, but the real issue with the technology is just how much time it took to disallow Tomkins' goal.</p>
      <p>If you go looking for relatively minor fouls in packed penalty areas then there's a chance you'll find them, and so it proved as Palace were denied an opener that would have been perfectly acceptable in the Premier League last season.</p>
      <p>This was harsh on the hosts, and if anything the decision was probably given because Lovren exaggerated his fall, and that can't be right can it?</p>
      <h3>2. For the Mane not the few</h3>

      <p>You could say that Mane loves playing against Palace given his excellent record against them (he now has eight goals), but the reality is that the Senegalese loves playing against pretty much everyone right now.</p>
      <p>With Mohamed Salah on the sidelines and Firmino out of scoring form before this game, it was again left to Mane to be the man who made the difference with the opener, albeit with the help of a deflection, Vicente Guaita's hand and both posts.</p>
      <p>But such is life for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> right now.</p>
      <h3>3. Lovren proves his place in the pecking order</h3>

      <p>With the focus on Joe Gomez over the international break as well as Joel Matip getting closer to fitness, this game was a good chance to scrutinise the form of Lovren, who has struggled at Selhurst Park in the past.</p>
      <p>He was obviously heavily involved in the incident that led to the disallowed Palace goal, but before that he was probably his side's best player in the first half.</p>
      <p>The Croatian has proved his worth as Virgil van Dijk's first-choice partner in recent weeks, and will take some shifting from the side.</p>
      <h3>4. Ayew sums up Palace's struggles in front of goal</h3>

      <p>Ayew was the key Palace figure in the first half, and should have given his side the lead when he fired wide.</p>
      <p>You can - and probably will - debate about just how much of a push in the back he put in on Lovren for the disallowed goal, but the Ghanaian's display wasn't exactly one of a player who looks like he'll get you goals, and a new striker should be a priority for Palace in the summer.</p>
      <h3>5. Klopp will have to mix it up next week</h3>

      <p>Fabinho's second half booking was his fifth of the season, and that might be a blessing in disguise for Liverpool.</p>
      <p>After Klopp rested the Brazilian for the win at Villa in order to protect him for the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> game, his most important midfielder will sit out <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brighton-and-hove-albion-fc">Brighton</a> at home next week through suspension.</p>
      <p>You'd think the Reds would win that, giving Klopp a chance to experiment.</p>
