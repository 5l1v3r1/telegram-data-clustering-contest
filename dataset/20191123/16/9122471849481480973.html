      <h1>Urban Meyer Criticizes SEC Teams For Scheduling Cupcakes This Week</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T16:38:39+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 16:38</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matt-admin" target="_blank">Matt Lombardi</a></address>
      <p>While there are some solid matchups in college football on Saturday, most of them aren’t involving SEC teams. It’s the annual “cupcake” weekend for the Southeastern Conference ahead of rivalry games next week.</p>
      <p>Former Ohio State head coach Urban Meyer, now part of FOX’s Big Noon Kickoff, is not a fan. During multiple segments on the show, Meyer said the matchups are “not good for college football.”</p>
      <p>Some examples – Alabama vs. Western Carolina, Auburn vs. Samford, Kentucky vs. UT Martin, Mississippi State vs. Abilene Christian.</p>
      <p>Meyer also advocated for what he calls “uniform scheduling” – nine conference games and one other Power-5 matchup for every Power 5 team in the country.</p>

      <p>Of course, Meyer once coached Florida, and the Gators basically did the same thing during his tenure. Ahead of their matchup with Florida State, the Gators would play lower-level opponents.</p>
      <p>Meyer has clearly changed his tune on the idea.</p>
      <p>While it would be nice to have better matchups this Saturday, don’t expect SEC teams to change what they’re doing unless they’re forced to. The College Football Playoff committee has not punished the league’s teams for these kinds of late-season matchups so far.</p>
