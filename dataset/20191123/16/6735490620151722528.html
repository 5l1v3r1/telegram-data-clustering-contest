      <h1>James McAvoy Reveals He’s Been Told He’s ‘Too Short For A Role’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T16:08:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 16:08</time> by <a rel="author">Brent Furdyk</a></address>
      <p>James McAvoy is taking a break from the silver screen to return to the stage, currently starring in a new production of “Cyrano de Bergerac” in London’s West End.</p>
      <p>Discussing his latest project with <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/theatre/what-to-see/james-mcavoy-interviewi-think-always-ready-fight/"><i>The Telegraph</i></a>, the conversation turned to his many movie roles, with McAvoy getting candid about the importance of physical appearance when being cast in a movie.</p>
      <p>“Sometimes you’re made to feel like you’re not good-looking enough to get a role,” he admits. “I was told once by an actress that it was an interesting choice, my casting, because nobody would usually believe that I would be with somebody like her. That was a kick in the nuts! I was like, ‘All right, now I’ve got to pretend that I really like you for eight more weeks. This is going to be really tough, because you’re so far up yourself.’ It got really interesting, that relationship.”</p>

      <p>The same hold true when it comes to height. “And as a shorter man, I sometimes get told I’m too short for a role,” says McAvoy of his five-seven stature. “Or even when I get a role, I’m made to feel like, well, of course, we’re going to have to do something about that.”</p>
      <p>During the interview, McAvoy — who’s starred in four “X-Men” movies — weighs in about Martin Scorsese’s controversial declaration that movies based on comic books are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/04/opinion/martin-scorsese-marvel.html">“not cinema.”</a></p>

      <p>“I would hope he’s watched every single one of them to make that statement,” McAvoy fires back. “Some of them are s**t and some of them have really moved me. I think that you’ve got to take it on a film-by-film basis.”</p>
      <p>However, he adds, “I’m not offended by it. He’s Martin Scorsese — he can say what he likes. And he’s not going to break the machine by saying it.”</p>
