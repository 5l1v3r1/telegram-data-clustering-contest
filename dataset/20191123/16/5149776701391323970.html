      <h1>'Won't need telling' - Notts County player ratings from defeat to Aldershot</h1>
      <h2>Magpies suffered back to back defeats for the first time this season</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T16:54:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 16:54</time> by <a rel="author">Leigh Curtis</a></address>
      <p>Notts County suffered a 2-1 defeat away at Aldershot.</p>
      <p>Here Leigh Curtis gives his verdict on the players' performances at the EBB Stadium.</p>
      <p>Sam Slocombe: Had made a good save to deny Connor Shields, but beaten by a fine header and then was left pretty helpless for the second as he was left in a one v one situation after Michael Doyle was caught in possession. 5</p>
      <p>Richard Brindley: Got high up the pitch this time and made a couple of penetrating runs. Gave Notts some valuable width at times, but couldn't produce a decisive contribition. 6</p>
      <p>Connell Rawlinson: Looked a little edgy early on when he didn't know whether to pass to Slocombe or clear. In the end he did neither. But again Notts conceded another two goals although none were his fault. 5</p>
      <p>Ben Turner: Big and strong in aerial challenges, but in this system the centre-backs are asked to pass the ball and the defender's distribution was a mixed bag. 5</p>
      <p>Damian McCrory: Got forward more than he did the previous week and put in a fierce low cross which came as a result of his endeavour to support the attack. Other than that, average. 5</p>
      <p>Enzio Boldewijn: Showed flashes of quality, but that was undone when he gave possession away in the middle of the pitch which led to the counter attack that eventually resulted in Aldershot's first goal. 4</p>

      <p>Michael Doyle: Captain's shot led to Kyle Wootton's equaliser, but will not need telling that he needed to be much stronger when he was caught in possession for Aldershot's second goal. Much better second half. 5</p>
      <p>Mitch Rose: Caught the eye with some lovely long range passing and used his physical presence well. Won plenty of free-kicks too. But was sacrificed in the second half as Notts searched for an equaliser. 5</p>
      <p>Regan Booty: Delivery into the box was better from free-kicks and picked out Damian McCrory with a lovely pass in the first half. Always looked to engineer openings. 6</p>
      <p>Kyle Wootton: Scored his seventh goal of the season which came as a result of his striker's instinct. Foraged away alongside Wes Thomas and was quick to put himself about. 6</p>
      <p>Wes Thomas: Had a shot saved in the first half and looked lively whenever he gets the ball. Some of his link-up play under pressure was very good too. 6</p>
