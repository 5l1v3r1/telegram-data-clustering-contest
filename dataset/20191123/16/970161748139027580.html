      <p>A corrupt policeman who boasted ‘I can do what I want’ has been jailed for two years after blowing £23,000 in 14 months on a ‘lifestyle of depravity’.</p>
      <p>Jon Snaith, 42, bankrupted himself and ended his 20-year career in the police force by spending thousands on drugs and Eastern European prostitutes.</p>
      <p>In court, recorder John Aitken said Snaith had been living a ‘fantasy lifestyle’ and that such offences ‘destroy the trust of many in the police force’.</p>
      <p>Snaith made regular money transfers to Romanian sex worker Marcela Muntean, 31, and a man who can be identified only as ‘A’ who both supplied his illegal needs, Newcastle Crown Court heard.</p>
      <p>He transferred £7,000 in total to Muntean and ‘A’ and had cash withdrawals in the order of £16,720 which coincided with his ‘extensive’ contact with the pair, prosecutor Sharon Beattie told the court.</p>

      <p>During one exchange, between Snaith and ‘A’ he asked ‘Any English girls?’</p>
      <p>In other conversations, they discussed prices of ‘gear’ and exchanged pictures of women the officer could have sex with.</p>

      <p>After ‘A’ was arrested on suspicion of human trafficking in January last year and being a ‘big boss’ in the sex and drugs underworld, Snaith allegedly offered him advice.</p>
      <p>He told him ‘to say nothing’ and encouraged him to breach bail conditions by coming to his house for a line, Miss Beattie said.</p>
      <p>Two months before the former constable’s arrest, he was allegedly seen talking to a group of men who commented on his job as a police officer.</p>
      <p>Miss Beattie said: ‘He was heard to reply ‘I can do what I want’.’</p>
      <p>The former police officer was arrested in April last year after holding an all-night drugs and sex party at his house.</p>
      <p>The night before, he was seen taking £500 in cash out before going on Grindr to encourage strangers to attend.</p>
      <p>Miss Beattie said: ‘He referred to ‘line, white, coke’ being available to any participants.</p>

      <p>‘It was clearly the drugs Muntean and brought him and he clearly offered to supply.</p>
      <p>‘He posted eight messages to this effect.’</p>
      <p>A picture taken on his phone at 6.55am showed Muntean ‘naked, bending over a chopping board, appearing to take drugs’.</p>

      <p>Later that day, Snaith was about to drive to the supermarket but was approached by surveillance officers who had noticed that he was ‘sweating heavily with dilated pupils and clearly unfit to drive’.</p>
      <p>He confessed to them: ‘I’ve gone too far this time’.</p>
      <p>When police raided his house, they found Muntean with a large amount of cash and drugs and another woman present.</p>
      <p>She told the officers: ‘Jon is a policeman, he’s allowed to take drugs in his own house.</p>
      <p>‘All police take drugs. I like to take drugs, it makes me feel nice.’</p>
      <p>Prosecutors said Snaith ‘served his own ends by failing to fulfill his duties’.</p>
      <p>The former constable – who had completed a course on how to recognise sexual exploitation – pleaded guilty to police corruption and offering to supply class A drugs to others.</p>
      <p>Jonathan Pigford, defending, said that the sex and drugs were ‘escapism’ and helped mask the ‘pain and isolation’ Snaith was feeling.</p>
      <p>He had lost a long-term relationship due to his ‘infidelities’ and had become ‘more and more isolated’ in the build up to the offences, he said.</p>
      <p>The former policeman, who now works as a labourer, was sentenced to two years in prison.</p>
      <p>Mr Recorder John Aitken told Snaith: ‘You entered into a lifestyle of depravity, using your own money to fund it and in the process bankrupted yourself.</p>
      <p>‘There is simply no question that you knew that was an outrageous way for a police officer to behave.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘Indeed, you vocalised that at one point when you were overheard, while under surveillance, brazenly saying ‘I’m a police officer, I can do anything’.</p>
      <p>‘It was not simply a case of you indulging in your own fantasy lifestyle, there were serious risks for others.</p>
      <p>‘You knew these women were strangers to the UK and that increased the risk they might have been trafficked but, single mindedly, you ignored that simply for your own satisfaction.</p>
      <p>‘You were aware of the drugs in circulation and who might be supplying them.’</p>
      <p>Muntean admitted supplying cocaine and converting criminal property in relation to around £10,000 that passed through her bank account.</p>
      <p>Paul Reid, defending Muntean, said the sex worker’s life was a ‘sad story of exploitation and abuse’ and that she made no money or luxuries for herself.</p>
      <p>He added that she was prostituted by others who became violent when she wanted to stop.</p>
      <p>She was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment, suspended for 12 months, with rehabilitation requirements and 100 hours unpaid work.</p>
      <p>The judge said there was an overwhelming likelihood she had been exploited ‘in some way, shape or form’ while in the UK.</p>
