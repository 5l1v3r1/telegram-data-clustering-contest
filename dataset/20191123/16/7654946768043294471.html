      <p>What’s the difference between a sharp and a square? Huge if you’re looking at profit and loss over a lifetime … but surprisingly small on any given day.</p>
      <p>There’s a misperception that sharps have great information, enabling them to load up on virtual locks. That’s not how it works. They bet bigger because they have bigger bankrolls. But, sharps are still grinding out small edges.</p>
      <p>Because of the standard 11/10 vigorish on sports bets (risk $11 to win $10, or anything in that ratio), break-even is 52.4 percent. Those new to sports betting may be surprised to learn that sharps win only about 53 to 55 percent of their opinions over the long haul.</p>
      <p>It’s easy to visualize this way. Recreational bettors are basically coin flippers who will hit 50 percent of their picks. That’s a losing record against the vig. Sharps will achieve something more like 6-5 every 11 picks (54.5 percent) or 23-20 over several days (53.4 percent).</p>
      <p>That’s a minor difference in a small sample size. But, multiply that by months or years, and sharps grind out nice livings while squares dig holes they can’t climb out of. It’s sports-betting math in a nutshell.</p>
      <p>What really hurts squares is the urge to parlay their opinions. That’s what drops their bet record under 50/50. Parlays do offer larger payouts, but you have to sweep all the included teams to win the bet. It’s hard to turn a 5-5 sampling of opinions or individual game picks into parlays that are going to sweep.</p>
      <p>Some lessons from real-world betting math:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Don’t discredit the opinion of sharps because you see them losing individual bets. It may seem that sharps are “wrong” a lot of the time. But, sharps are going to lose about 46 or 47 out of every 100 bets over the long haul. Too many inexperienced bettors and media pundits are applying their own delusions of grandeur to the sharp process. Top poker players don’t win every hand. Sharps don’t win every game.</li>
        <li>Whenever you hear about a really huge bet (a topic that has become a popular staple in mainstream coverage), it’s usually from a rich square (or fan) rather than a sharp. These publicity-driven stories are easy to find because sports books want ill-informed rich squares to place big bets. You’ll find many of those super-large bets are placed at inflated point spreads or money lines. Sportsbooks only accept monster wagers when the math is on their side. Sharps grind within the parameters of sound bankroll management.</li>
        <li>The difference between you being a winner or a loser in this field is actually pretty small on a per-day basis. Stop chasing parlays. Don’t bet uninformed leans in TV games just because you want to have something to sweat. Don’t place big bets your strongest opinions until you have a track record that justifies that level of confidence (even then, bet responsibly).</li>
      </ul>
