      <p>Notts County were masters of their own downfall as they suffered back to back defeats for the first time this season as they lost 2-1 at Aldershot.</p>
      <p>After a cagey opening, Damon Searle's side took the lead when Enzio Boldewijn was caught in possession in midfield allowing them to counterattack.</p>
      <p>Sam Slocombe thought he had given Notts a reprieve when he saved from Connor Shields, but from the following cross out wide, Mohamed Bettamer thundered in a header.</p>
      <p>Neal Ardley's side fought their way back into the game however as Kyle Wootton's seventh goal of the season put them on level terms when he converted Michael Doyle's shot.</p>

      <p>But close to half-time, Michael Doyle was caught in possession by Alfy Whittingham who ran through to slide the ball past Slocombe.</p>
      <p>Notts had good periods of possession in the second half with Thomas firing a shot wide of the far post which led to a scramble that Notts could not convert.</p>
      <p>Regan Booty then saw a corner punched off the line as it seemed to be going straight in as Ardley ended the game with three forwards on the pitch having sent on Kristian Dennis.</p>
      <p>But they could not find an equaliser on what was a disappointing afternoon at the EBB Stadium.</p>
