      <p>“For the last 12 years I have had the privilege to travel the world and play music with my best friends and together make countless new friends along the way,” he wrote on his Instagram page.</p>
      <p>“I’ve loved every second of it and won’t be able to put into words what it has meant to me and my family.</p>
      <p>“However, such a long time living a touring schedule that has always been hard to predict, I have known in my heart for the last 6 months that I need to take a break and pursue other ambitions I have always had.</p>
      <p>“I am still best friends and brothers with all the Coronas family and I will always see myself as a Corona and I know that they will too. I’ve been lucky enough to play on the next album and as our fans always say we ‘get better and better with each album ‘ I can tell u on this occasion that is definitely the case.</p>

      <p>“My endless thanks and gratitude to the countless people who helped and inspired me throughout my Coronas career.</p>
