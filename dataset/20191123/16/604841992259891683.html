      <p>They had to withstand some sustained late pressure but for a spirited Clann na nGael side it was mission accomplished as they defeated Ballymore Eustace 2-8 to 1-10 in the Leinster Club JFC semi-final at Trim today. </p>
      <p>On a dank, November afternoon Clann na nGael produced spells of sunshine football to secure their place in the final with the team displaying the kind of gritty tenacity that has been a hallmark of their performances this year. </p>
      <p>Tom Hanley's side trailed 1-5 to 0-9 at the interval but they really pushed on in the second-half upping their performance to get the better of a well-organised Ballymore Eustace outfit. </p>
      <p>Clann na nGael's team conjured up the opening goal of the game after 15 minutes when Tom Hanley passed to Philip Garry who found the net with a powerful shot. Garry added a point soon after to give his team a 1-3 to 0-3 advantage but Ballymore Eustace hit back. Niall Murphy showed the way for the Kildare outfit with four points to help them lead at the break. </p>
      <p>Cian Swaine (three) and Ryan McNamee and were others to split the posts for Clann na nGael in that opening half.  </p>
      <p>The Meath side were struggling in the lead up to the break but they really upped their performance in the second-half although they shipped a blow when Stephen Dwyer converted a penalty for the Kildare outfit soon after the resumption. At that stage Ballymore Eustace led 1-9 to 1-6. </p>
      <p>However, undaunted Clann na nGael hit back with two booming points from Jack Doherty and one from Swaine. The Clanns really took a giant step towards victory when on 54 minutes they won a penalty that was superbly swept home by Darragh Griffin. </p>
      <p>The Clann na nGael defence had to withstand some late, sustainted pressure but they managed to do just that to record a famous victory. It says a lot about Clann na nGael that they could hold Ballymore Eustace to just 1-1 in the second-half. </p>
      <p>This was a super team display by Clann na nGael - something that was acknowledged by manager Tom Hanley afterwards. That this was all about a team effort, he emphasised.  </p>
