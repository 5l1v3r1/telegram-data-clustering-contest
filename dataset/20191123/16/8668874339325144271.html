      <h1>Departing CEO pens open letter to Harlequins fans</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T16:44:28+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 16:44</time> by <a rel="author">Ian Cameron</a></address>
      <p>Departing <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/harlequins">Harlequins</a> CEO David Ellis has penned an open letter to club fans upon his departure from the club.</p>
      <p>Harlequins announced the appointment of Laurie Dalrymple as Chief Executive as his successor last week.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The letter reads:</b>
      </p>
      <p>This evening is the final occasion on which I can welcome you to The Stoop as I leave Harlequins this weekend after over eight fantastic and memorable years as Chief Executive.</p>
      <p>It has been both an honour and a privilege to have been custodian of our great club. During my time I have witnessed and experienced great changes to our game and our club.</p>
      <p>As Harlequins we are always driven by our motto – Nunquam Dormio – restlessly challenging ourselves to keep improving and keep moving forward.</p>
      <p>The sense of constant evolution and innovation over the years is probably easier to quantify when there is time for reflection, at present however, I am very aware that the ongoing upgrades to The Stoop and to Surrey Sports Park have kept driving our match day atmosphere at the former and ensured we keep up with the demands of our changing game at the latter.</p>

      <p>The Harlequins Foundation is doing great work in the communities that it serves, the Richmond upon Thames School which we support is a reality, the Big Game series has established itself as an important part of many people’s Christmas schedule; Harlequins Women are a force in the Tyrrells Premier 15s and girls rugby is fast developing, and there is so much more.</p>
      <p>The constant in all the things we have achieved on and off the field is the brilliant, dedicated and talented people that make us a Club. From our owners and Board to our players, coaches and support staff; our commercial and administration staff; all those behind the scenes that ensure this stadium is ready for every match day and that you have an enjoyable and safe experience; there are the sponsors and partners without whom so much that we do would not be possible; and last but not least, there are our loyal supporters without whom this club would not be the exceptional place that it is. I would like to thank you all.</p>
      <p>Thank for your support of Harlequins and I hope that it will continue for seasons to come. After this evening I’m looking forward to returning to the stands and joining you as a supporter.</p>
      <p>More importantly, back to tonight’s fixture, if I can ask you one more time to get behind our team as you always do as we look to get an important win against our rivals from the West Country.</p>
