      <h1>(Video) Trent rakes a straight 60-yard cross-fielder that sums up jaw-dropping passing ability</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T16:39:33+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 16:39</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/mattaddison/" target="_blank">Matt Addison</a></address>
      <p>Trent Alexander-Arnold has made swinging long-range passes across the pitch to Andy Robertson his speciality this season – and he’s just produced another from the top drawer against Crystal Palace.</p>
      <p>He nonchalantly got hold of possession at full-back before he effortlessly fed his opposite full-back with a perfect pass.</p>
      <p>Watch a clip of the skill below, via SportCanli’s coverage.</p>
      <blockquote>Trent Alexander Arnold napıyorsun be çocuk? Yeter be sırılsıklam ettin bizi. <a href="https://t.co/Iv41f7SNX7">pic.twitter.com/Iv41f7SNX7<br/></a>— aras #Lfc (@araslfc) <a href="https://twitter.com/araslfc/status/1198276734837313536?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 23, 2019</a></blockquote>
      <p>Alexander-Arnold had a tough time in the first half coping with Wilfried Zaha but got through that, with Sadio Mane putting the Reds in front early in the second period (<a href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/2019/11/23/video-sadio-manes-perfect-finish-puts-the-reds-in-front-at-selhurst-park/">watch that goal by clicking here</a>).</p>
