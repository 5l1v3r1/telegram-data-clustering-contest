      <p>SEATTLE (AP/WSVN) — Health officials say a resident of King County has been diagnosed with an E. coli infection connected to Salinas, California romaine lettuce.</p>
      <p>Public Health Seattle and King County officials said Friday the person became ill from eating leafy greens believed to have been purchased in King County. The person was hospitalized and is now recovering.</p>
      <p>Officials say the lettuce was genetically linked to a <a href="https://wsvn.com/news/us-world/salad-product-recall-over-e-coli-bacteria-impacts-22-states-including-florida/">national outbreak involving romaine lettuce</a> from Salinas. The U.S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced the outbreak Friday. The CDC recommends avoiding romaine lettuce from the Salinas, California area.</p>
      <p>Public Health is investigating additional E. coli cases among King County residents that may eventually be linked to the national outbreak, but officials say complete information on these cases is pending.</p>
      <p>In a statement issued Saturday, the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services indicated that lettuce grown in Florida “is not implicated in the outbreak, and the [Food and Drug Administration] has indicated there are neither positive samples nor reported illnesses in Florida.”</p>
      <p>Symptoms of an E. coli infection include diarrhea, severe stomach cramps, and vomiting.</p>
