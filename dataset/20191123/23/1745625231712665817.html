      <p>'It’s like someone taped our arms to our side and punched us in the face,' one lawmaker said.</p>
      <p>The impeachment investigation into President <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/donald-trump/">Donald Trump</a> is almost guaranteed to reach its epilogue with the House of Representatives voting on articles of impeachment, but it remains uncertain how the whole process will play out politically.</p>
      <p>According to a new report from <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/22/democrats-house-impeachment-moderates-072972"><i>Politico</i></a>, some Democrats fear they could lose their seats.</p>
      <p>Vulnerable Democrats in swing districts reportedly feel abandoned by the party, amid an ongoing GOP campaign against impeachment.</p>
      <p>“Many of us have been expressing our concerns to leadership,” a Democratic lawmaker revealed to the publication.</p>
      <p>“You don’t want to have to play catch up,” the lawmaker continued.</p>
      <blockquote>“Everyone knows you don’t just take a shot and sit there. It’s like someone taped our arms to our side and punched us in the face.”</blockquote>
      <p>Analyses have suggested that Republican Party-affiliated groups are outspending their Democratic counterparts by large margins. GOP-aligned groups have spent around $8 million on television advertisements in swing districts, slamming Democrats over impeachment, but Democrats have reportedly received little to no financial support from their party’s backers.</p>
      <p>Democratic groups have spent around $2.7 million on television ads, $600,000 of which was spent on ads targeting Republican lawmakers, and not defending vulnerable Democrats against the GOP onslaught, according to an analysis by the ad tracking firm Advertising Analytics.</p>
      <p>Multiple GOP-aligned groups are set to spend even more money on advertisements targeting vulnerable Democrats. The Citizens United-backed Presidential Coalition, for instance, has announced that it will be spending more than $1 million on ads targeting Democrats Joe Cunningham, Elissa Slotkin, Xochitl Torres Small, and Ben McAdams.</p>
      <p>Similarly, a non-profit with ties to House Republicans will spend $5 million on anti-impeachment ads, taking aim at 18 Democratic districts. Signaling that Democratic Party-aligned groups have other priorities, the Protect Our Care coalition launched an ad campaign promoting Democrats’ drug pricing legislation.</p>

      <p>According to a Democratic strategist, the GOP ad campaigns are meant to put pressure on the lawmakers.</p>

      <p>“It’s not about changing voters’ minds. It’s about pressuring Democrats,” the strategist explained.</p>
      <p>According to GOP strategists, impeachment has helped with candidate recruitment, and voters in swing districts are “repelled” by the investigation.</p>
      <p>In a closed-door meeting with Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi this Wednesday, a number of swing district Democrats reportedly raised the issue, asking if party leadership plans on protecting vulnerable lawmakers by launching advertisement campaigns.</p>
      <p>Not all Democrats are waiting for the leadership to jump in, however. Rep. Elaine Luria of Virginia has already spent $5,000 on digital ads, promoting her own position on impeachment and protecting herself against GOP attacks.</p>
      <p>House Democrats are reportedly <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/5757518/democrats-four-articles-impeachment-trump/">drafting four articles of impeachment</a> against Trump, and they expect to hold a vote by Christmas.</p>
