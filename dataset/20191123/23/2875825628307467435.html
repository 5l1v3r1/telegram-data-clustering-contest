      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T23:12:31+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 23:12</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity's</a> Jacqueline Jossa was left sobbing into her hands during this evening's show after Ant &amp; Dec told her she'd be taking part in the next Bushtucker Trial - The Crevice of Cruelty.</p>
      <p>The EastEnders actress had tears streaking her cheeks when the Geordie duo delivered the news that it'd be her and former Arsenal footballer Ian Wright heading into the latest gruelling challenge.</p>
      <p>The 27 year old has had a rough time Down Under so far, with her telling Ant &amp; Dec that the public were "out of order" for picking her to take on the infamous Snake Hotel.</p>
      <p>Cliff Parisi was excluded from the trial on medical grounds.</p>
      <p>This evening's show saw her have a slightly easier time of things, with her being released from Jungle Jail and even being named James Haskell's Deputy Camp Leader.</p>
      <p>Camp even got their luxury item, Jacqueline's a fluffy pillow with family photos printed all over.</p>
      <p>Things were just starting to look up when Ant &amp; Dec delivered the news and brought her mood crashing down.</p>

      <p>"Ian and Jacqueline," Ant said to the pair, "The person the public have decided they want to see face The Crevice of Cruelty is..."</p>
      <p>"Both of you," finished Dec.</p>
      <p>While Ian stared into space, Jacqueline began weeping with Kate Garraway on hand to offer what comfort she could.</p>

      <p>"I don't wanna do it anymore!" Jacqueline wailed, as Camp Leader James put his arm around her.</p>
      <p>She wasn't the only one to get the weepies during the show - comedian Andrew Maxwell shed some tears and confided in Jacqueline that he'd considered packing it in.</p>
      <p>"I honestly thought that I was gonna walk out," he said, "But I haven't. When you're tired, you just say, 'Have I done the right thing?'"</p>

      <p>Jacqueline replied: "You'd never leave, I can tell you that. You're just tired."</p>
      <p>"Everyone has a bad day," she told him as he began to cry.</p>
      <p>James came over to support, telling Andrew: "You're an important part of the group and we need you."</p>
      <p>"You've spent over two weeks away from your family - it's a long time," Jacqueline added.</p>
      <p>Rugby legend James offered more kind words: "You're brilliant, you bring so much energy and laughter."</p>
      <p>Andrew and Jacqueline haven't always been such good pals - they nearly had a major clash earlier this week over who would go to Jungle Jailhouse.</p>
      <p>When Nadine Coyle and Jacqueline said they didn't want to put their names into the hat, Andrew wasn't best pleased.</p>
      <p>"Jacqueline and Nadine said they don't want to go," Andrew said in the Bush Telegraph, "And erm...that's the end of that."</p>
