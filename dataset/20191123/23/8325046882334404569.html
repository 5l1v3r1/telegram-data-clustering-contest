      <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted Saturday that the company has already received 146,000 orders for the new <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-cybertruck-pickup-truck-pictures-info-details-price-2019-11">Cybertruck</a> unveiled Thursday night.</p>
      <p>“146k Cybertruck orders so far, with 42% choosing dual, 41% tri &amp; 17% single motor,” Musk tweeted, referring to the three different configurations available: single-motor rear-wheel-drive, dual-motor all-wheel-drive, and tri-motor all-wheel drive.</p>
      <p>Musk added that the orders had come despite “no advertising &amp; no paid endorsement.”</p>
      <p>The bizarre-looking passenger pickup truck was <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/heres-everything-that-happened-when-elon-musk-unveiled-the-cybertruck-2019-11">debuted</a> at an event Thursday night that immediately sparked headlines, then went viral over a failed demonstration of the Cybertruck’s “armored glass,” which shattered upon contact with a small metal ball.</p>
      <p>“We threw wrenches, we threw everything even literally the kitchen sink at the glass and it didn’t break. For some weird reason, it broke now,” Musk said Thursday. “I don’t know why. We will fix it in post.”</p>
      <p>The Cybertruck, which is made of heavy-duty stainless steel and has a range of up to 500 miles on a single charge, starts at $39,990 and goes up to $76,900.</p>
      <p>The vehicle is set to being production in late 2021.</p>
