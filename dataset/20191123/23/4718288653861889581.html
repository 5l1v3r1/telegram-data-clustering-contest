      <p>MUMBAI: Industrialist Anand Mahindra on Saturday shared a Kabaddi video showing a `raider' falling prey to an audacious move executed by a `defender' to illustrate the ongoing political drama in Maharashtra.</p>
      <p>BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis was sworn in as chief minister and NCP's Ajit Pawar as deputy CM in a stunning turn of events in Maharashtra early Saturday morning.<br/><br/><b>ALSO READ: <a href="https://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2019/nov/23/sc-to-hear-congress-ncp-sena-plea-against-maharashtra-governors-decision-on-sunday-at-1130-am-2066114.html">SC to hear Congress-NCP-Sena plea against Maharashtra Governor's decision on Sunday at 11:30 am</a></b></p>
      <p>The development came when the NCP, Shiv Sena and Congress were in talks to stake claim for forming a non-BJP government.</p>

      <p>"Remember this video I had tweeted? Can you think of any more appropriate way to describe what just happened in Maharashtra?" Mahindra, who heads the city-headquartered USD 20 billion group, said on Twitter.</p>
      <p>Industrialist Harsh Goenka, who heads the RPG group, also tweeted about the day's happenings.</p>
      <p>"shared Pawar", he tweeted, perhaps suggesting that two members of the Pawar family -- NCP chief Sharad Pawar and his renegade nephew Ajit -- are now in different camps.<br/><br/><b>ALSO READ | <a href="https://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2019/nov/23/our-44-mlas-are-intact-maharashtra-governor-bypassed-all-norms-congress-leader-kc-venugopal-2066123.html">Our 44 MLAs are intact, Maharashtra Governor bypassed all norms: Congress leader KC Venugopal</a></b></p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Sajjan Jindal of JSW Group congratulated Fadnavis for coming back to power after a brief spell of President's rule.</p>
      <p>"Congratulations to @Dev_Fadnavis on taking oath as Chief Minister of #Maharashtra. Continuity in leadership is beneficial for the state and I wish him the very best for his second tenure," Jindal tweeted.</p>
