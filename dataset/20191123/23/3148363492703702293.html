      <h1>Report: Bloomberg Won't Accept Political Donations for Presidential Bid</h1>
      <h2>Billionaire Michael Bloomberg will not accept political donations if he chooses to officially jump into the presidential race, nor will he take a presidential salary should he win the Democrat nomination and defeat President Trump, according to reports.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T23:26:38+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 23:26</time> by <a rel="author">Hannah Bleau</a></address>
      <p>Bloomberg’s chief adviser, Howard Wolfson, confirmed this week that Bloomberg, who has a net worth over $50 billion, will not <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/bloomberg-vows-refuse-donations-presidential-salary-n1090151?cid=sm_npd_nn_tw_ma">accept</a> political donations, should he formally jump into the presidential race.</p>
      <p>“He has never taken a political contribution in his life. He is not about to start,” Wolfson <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/bloomberg-vows-refuse-donations-presidential-salary-n1090151?cid=sm_npd_nn_tw_ma">stated.</a> “He cannot be bought.”</p>
      <p>He added that Bloomberg “is wholly independent of special interests, will not take a dime in any contribution, and never has in any of his three races.”</p>
      <p>However, Bloomberg’s refusal to accept donations “would make it impossible for Bloomberg to participate in any sanctioned Democratic debates,” per the Democratic National Committee’s (DNC) requirements.</p>
      <p>Wolfson added that Bloomberg will not take a presidential salary, should he make it into the Oval Office.</p>
      <p>“Wolfson said Bloomberg would work for only $1 a year as president, just as he did when he was New York City mayor for more than a decade,” according to NBC News.</p>
      <p>While the billionaire has yet to formally announce a presidential bid, all signs are pointing to one. He <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/11/21/michael-bloomberg-officially-files-statement-of-candidacy/">filed</a> his statement of candidacy on Thursday and secured a multimillion-dollar ad buy, which is slated to air from November 23 to December 3, 2019 and span approximately 99 cities.</p>
      <p>Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) said he was “disgusted” following the news of Bloomberg’s $33 million ad buy, <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/11/23/bernie-sanders-disgusted-by-michael-bloombergs-33-million-ad-buy/">adding</a> that it is the “latest example of a rigged political system that we are going to change when we’re in the White House.”</p>
      <p>Bloomberg’s team said that the former New York City mayor will <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/11/08/michael-bloomberg-will-spend-whatever-it-takes-to-defeat-trump/">spend</a> “whatever it takes” to defeat Trump in 2020.</p>
