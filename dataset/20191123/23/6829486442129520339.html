      <h1>There Are Plans To Adapt Matt Okine’s Semi-Autobiographical First Novel Into A Movie</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T23:58:37+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 23:58</time> by <a rel="author">Hannah Story</a></address>
      <p>Comedian Matt Okine’s first novel, <i>Being Black ‘n Chicken, &amp; Chips</i>, is set to be adapted into a feature film, <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/culture/movies/dream-come-true-matt-okine-s-debut-novel-to-become-a-feature-film-20191122-p53d2q.html">as the Sydney Morning Herald reports</a>.</p>
      <p>Released in September this year, the semi-autobiographical novel follows Mike, a normal teenager in Brissie dealing with first crushes, the pressure and perils of high school – and his mother’s sudden diagnosis with advanced breast and brain cancer.</p>
      <p><i>Being Black ‘n Chicken, &amp; Chips</i> is based on the loss of his mother when he was 12, and his 2012 stand-up show, <i>Being Black N Chicken N Shit</i>, for which he won Best Newcomer at MICF.</p>
      <p>The rights to the novel have been picked up by Aquarius Films, the Sydney-based co-producers of 2016’s<i> Lion</i>, starring Dev Patel. They’ll be working with Wooden Horse, the pair having also worked together on Okine’s Stan series<i> The Other Guy</i>.</p>

      <p>Talking to the SMH, Okine said: “It’s something I’ve always wanted to do. From the second I started writing the book, I was writing the movie. I always had that in mind every step of the way.”</p>
      <p>Matt Okine will be on the project as an executive producer. He told the newspaper that he’s looking forward to finding a half-Ghanian teenager to play the role of Mike. “When I was 12 years old I didn’t see anyone like me being the lead character in an Australian feature film.</p>
      <p>“The sad thing is I wouldn’t have made this film if my mum was still alive – not just because the tragedy of her death wouldn’t have happened, but I would have been a different person. I would have been a safe person. In a cruel irony I’m proud of the person I’ve become because of what’s happened.”</p>
      <p>The announcement has been met with praise by Okine’s friends and peers, including former triple j co-workers Tom Tilley, Al Newstead and Sally Coleman, and people like Illy, Adam Liaw, Felicity Ward and Lincoln Lewis.</p>

      <p>The second season of <a href="https://junkee.com/the-other-guy-matt-okine-set-visit/118611">Matt Okine’s <i>The Other Guy</i></a>, which is very loosely inspired by his own relationship breakdown, and experience of infidelity, is set to premiere on Stan next month. It tracks down-and-out radio host, AJ, played by Okine, as he’s offered the opportunity to adapt his tumultuous personal life into a TV series… Sounds familiar…</p>
      <p><i>Being Black ‘n Chicken, &amp; Chips</i> is out now <a href="https://www.hachette.com.au/matt-okine/being-black-n-chicken-and-chips">through Hachette</a>.</p>
