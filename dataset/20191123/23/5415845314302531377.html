      <h2>Arsenal may be burning to pieces, but that doesn’t mean that every last thing has fallen to bits. Don’t lose track of the small niblets of joy here.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T23:59:28+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 23:59</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://paininthearsenal.com/author/joshsippie/" target="_blank">Josh Sippie</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://paininthearsenal.com/category/arsenal-news/">Arsenal</a> could not take home three points against the worst defense in the Premier League. Instead of dominating Southampton in front of a home crowd, they left the field to a cascade of boos following a 2-2 draw that was only scraped together at the last moment by <a href="https://fbref.com/en/players/9dbb75ca/Alexandre-Lacazette?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-">Alexandre Lacazette</a>.</p>
      <p>It’s bad. There’s no hiding from that. And it’s very easy to take this recent string of results and live in the negatives. It’s probably even natural. And while I will always clash with Arsenal fans not to be so overly sensational, it’s hard to avoid the truth here—things are bad.</p>
      <p>But the key here is that <i>some</i> things are bad. <i>Most</i> things, I guess you could say. But that doesn’t mean all things. And as is my calling here, I want to take a moment to get through to the crux of the positives here at the club, even though there aren’t that many.</p>

      <p>If nothing else, consider it an exercise in keeping hold of your own blood pressure because, spoiler alert, this club is not good for it.</p>
      <p>So come with me on this journey to positivity. I’ve got three for you right now.</p>
      <h3>3. Functional fullbacks</h3>
      <p>I have no clue what Unai Emery is doing with this defense. I don’t think he has any clue either. He doesn’t seem to understand how to put together what I find to be obvious pieces. But all that said, the fullback situation is incredibly positive, despite what we saw against Southampton.</p>
      <p><a href="https://fbref.com/en/players/fce2302c/Kieran-Tierney?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-">Kieran Tierney</a> gave up a penalty and <a href="https://fbref.com/en/players/f874dd44/Hector-Bellerin?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-">Hector Bellerin</a> looked sluggish at best, but the key takeaway that I found here was that we know Bellerin is better than he played here and Tierney was almost entirely positive and the penalty given was rather soft.</p>
      <p>These are two capable, they are deadly, and when they fully hit their stride, they will turn the tide in matches. It’s all just a matter of time.</p>
      <p>Onwards to No. 2.</p>
