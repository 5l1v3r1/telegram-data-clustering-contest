        <b>Vanderhoof RCMP arrested a 27-year old U.S. citizen on Nov. 23</b>
      </p>
      <p>A U.S. man believed to be in the country illegally has been arrested in connection to a string of thefts from the municipal airport, Vanderhoof RCMP say.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, Nov. 23, a local airplane owner identified a suspect to police after thefts last week, said Sgt. Rodney Guthrie in an emailed statement to the Omineca Express.</p>
      <p>Officers arrested the suspect, a 27-year-old U.S. citizen, shortly after and found him to be in possession of stolen property and several firearms, he said.</p>
      <p>Investigators believe the suspect entered the country illegally.</p>
      <p>The unnamed suspect remains in custody and will not be named by officials unless charges are laid.</p>
      <p>Police are considering recommending charges to Crown counsel including break and enter, theft, unauthorized possession of a firearm, as well as charges under the Customs Act.</p>
