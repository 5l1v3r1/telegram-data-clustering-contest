      <p>Including salary lost to suspensions, the incident’s price tag was worth more than $US2 million, according to NFL.com.</p>
      <p>The majority of the fines came out to $3,507, levied against players for entering the area where Garrett hit the Rudolph over the head with the quarterback’s helmet a part of a late-game fight.</p>
      <p>Garrett was fined $45,623 the incident and suspended indefinitely – at least through this postseason.</p>
      <p>Rudolph, who went after Garrett prior to being hit, was docked $50,000 for unsportsmanlike conduct.</p>
      <p>The Browns’ Larry Ogunjobi was suspended a game, while the Steelers’ Maurkice Pouncy was suspended two games for their roles.</p>
