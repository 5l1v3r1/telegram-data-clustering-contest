      <h1>Ohio State Defensive Coordinator Has Message For Heisman Voters</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T23:54:01+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 23:54</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/danlyons" target="_blank">Dan Lyons</a></address>
      <p>Chase Young really made his return from suspension count today. The Ohio State star had three sacks on the day, with nine total tackles and four tackles for loss.</p>
      <p>We are all aware that the Heisman Trophy goes to offensive players 99-percent of the time. At this point, it is largely a quarterback award, with the occasional cameo from a next-level running back if there are no great QBs available.</p>
      <p>Young deserves to head to New York though, even if it will be tough for him to edge out LSU (and former Buckeye) QB Joe Burrow. He may not even be alone from Ohio State, as quarterback Justin Fields is having a Heisman-caliber season of his own.</p>
      <p>This week sent his <a href="https://thespun.com/big-ten/ohio-state-buckeyes/chase-young-heisman-trophy-hype-increasing-vs-penn-state">Heisman hype</a> to a new level. He has the support of his former head coach, Urban Meyer, who <a href="https://thespun.com/big-ten/ohio-state-buckeyes/urban-meyer-ohio-state-penn-state-chase-young-heisman">stumped for him</a> after Ohio State’s 28-17 win over Penn State, which Young’s sacks played a large part in sealing after the Nittany Lions’ valiant comeback attempt.</p>
      <p>His defensive coordinator is doing the same. After the game, Jeff Hafley had a pretty clear message to Heisman voters: Chase Young is the best player in the country.</p>

      <p>There seem to be good odds that he’ll get invited to the ceremony. If anything, the suspension by the NCAA put the spotlight on how dynamic he is.</p>
      <p>Winning it may be too tall a task, though. The last defense-first player to take home the award was Michigan’s Charles Woodson, who also played on offense and was a dynamic kick and punt returner.</p>
      <p>Tyrann Mathieu, Jabrill Peppers, and Manti Te’o have all finished in the top five in recent seasons. There was a big push for Ndamukong Suh to win the award back in 2009, but the Nebraska defensive lineman finished fourth, with Alabama’s Mark Ingram winning the award.</p>
      <p>We’ll see how this year’s voting will shake out in a few weeks.</p>
