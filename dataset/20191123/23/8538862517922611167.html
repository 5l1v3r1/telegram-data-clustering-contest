      <h1>Rumour: PS Plus December 2019 PS4 Game Potentially Leaked Early</h1>
      <h2>Come here boy</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T23:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 23:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.pushsquare.com/users/LiamCroft" target="_blank">Liam Croft</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/playstation-plus">PlayStation Plus</a> line-up for December is always an important one as it will be the two PlayStation 4 games that purchasers of the console during the Christmas season will be able to download straight away. And if this potential leak is anything to go by, anyone subscribed to PS Plus should be rather happy with at least one of the title's they'll be able to play as part of the subscription.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/dzz50m/god_of_war_possible_ps_plus_contender_for/">Over on Reddit</a>, user BubaManUK has reported that they they are unable to purchase <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/god_of_war">God of War</a> on the PlayStation Store due to the fact that the listing for the standard edition is displaying as free for PS Plus subscribers. Proof of that can be found in the image below.</p>

      <p>Now, that's all well and good, but the picture in question has raised our suspicions. Why is the standard version initially listed at a price of $99.99, while the Digital Deluxe Edition is down at $29.99? Could this be a cleverly-done photoshop? We're not entirely convinced either way, but the PlayStation Store has given away the PS Plus line-up in the past through early listings.</p>
      <p>Adding weight to the rumour is that users are apparently able to replicate what is shown above on the US PSN Store. It isn't tied to the single account belonging to the Reddit poster. The PlayStation Plus line-up for the month of December will be announced on Wednesday 27th November, so we have less than a week to go until we find out whether this leak is true or not.</p>
      <p>Do you hope that God of War is part of the December line-up for PlayStation Plus? Or do you already own the game or already playing it through <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/tags/playstation-now">PlayStation Now</a>? Share your thoughts in the comments below.</p>
