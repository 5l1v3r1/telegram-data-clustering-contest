      <h2>Swiss company looks to restock pipeline with acquisition of The Medicines Company</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T23:14:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 23:14</time> by <a rel="author">Sarah Neville, Hannah Kuchler, James Fontanella-Khan, Arash Massoudi, Eric Platt</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/93e532ee-e3a5-11e9-b112-9624ec9edc59">Novartis </a>has agreed a $9.7bn cash deal to acquire The Medicines Company, betting that the US drugmaker will come good on a new drug designed to control cholesterol levels. </p>
      <p>The takeover marks the latest attempt by Novartis chief executive Vas Narasimhan to reshape the Swiss pharmaceutical company, which has a market value of $203bn, through a series of disposals and takeovers. </p>
      <p>Novartis will pay $85 per share, a sharp premium to the New Jersey company’s stock price just days ago when Bloomberg reported it was exploring a sale. The target’s shares closed on Friday at just below $70. The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of next year. </p>

      <p>Big pharma companies including Novartis are looking at acquisitions as the primary means of restocking their drug pipelines rather than relying on homegrown research and development. </p>
      <p>Mr Narasimhan said the Medicines Company’s drug Inclisiran is a “potentially transformational medicine”. Tens of millions of patients have increased risk of cardiovascular problems because of high cholesterol, he added. </p>
      <p>“We believe that Inclisiran could contribute significantly to improved patient outcomes and help healthcare systems address the leading global cause of death,” he said. </p>
      <p>The Medicines Company this month presented the results of successful late stage trials of its cholesterol-lowering drug. It reduced the so-called ‘bad cholesterol’, suffered by tens of millions of Americans, by up to 58 per cent. The drug is an injection, administered every few months, rather than the current treatment of a statin pill daily. Novartis said over 50m patients could not control their high cholesterol with the current standard of care.</p>
      <p>The drug, which has yet to be approved, works by silencing a gene and reducing a protein that controls the production of so-called ‘bad’ cholesterol. This method of gene silencing — known as RNA interference — has been explored for decades but has become more successful in recent years. </p>
      <p>The company has partnered on the drug with Boston-based Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, which has received approval for two drugs using a similar mechanism to silence genes. One treats porphyria, the rare disease which King George III suffered from, while the other treats the nerve damage associated with another rare disease. </p>
      <p>The Medicines Company is led by Mark Timney, who joined last year after being chief executive of Purdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin. Before that, he worked at Merck. </p>
      <p>Earlier this year Dr <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/313c6abe-5628-11e9-a3db-1fe89bedc16e">Narasimhan</a> said he was aiming to limit M&amp;A spending to about 5 per cent of Novartis’s market capitalisation, as he sought to boost total shareholder returns. </p>
      <p>Dr Narasimhan, who since taking the helm almost two years ago has sought to dispose of parts of the company unrelated to its core innovative medicines business, pointed to its acquisition of IFM Tre, a biopharma company focused on immunology, as an example of “a much more focused” acquisition strategy. </p>
      <p>Among its key acquisitions last year was the $3.9bn purchase of the French nuclear medicines business Advanced Accelerator Applications and, for $2.1bn, US-based Endocyte — both specialising in targeted radiopharmaceutical cancer treatments. Meanwhile, in cell and gene therapy, an area where the company is a leader, it bought AveXis for $8.7bn, acquiring a treatment for spinal muscular atrophy, a disease for which there is no cure. </p>
      <p>However, the company has faced controversy this year, following the disclosure that some data was manipulated from early testing of the spinal muscular atrophy drug Zolgensma. The episode, which the company had been investigating internally, was not publicly disclosed until after the drug had been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Two senior executives at AveXis were replaced. The FDA approval was unaffected. </p>
