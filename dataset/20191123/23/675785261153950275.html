      <h1>Simon Cowell's girlfriend appears to 'ask who Mark Wright is' live on X Factor</h1>
      <h2>Some X Factor viewers were convinced that Simon Cowell's girlfriend Lauren Silverman did not know who the former TOWIE star was while he spoke to Dermott O'Leary</h2>

      <p>X Factor viewers were surprised to see Mark Wright sat in the audience tonight - and it seemed to confuse Simon Cowell's girlfriend.</p>
      <p>Lauren Silverman was sat on the table next to the former The Only Way Is Essex star during the semi-final.</p>
      <p>Radio host Mark spoke to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/x-factor">X Factor</a> presenter Dermot O'Leary about his favourite performers, including his pal Thom Evans and fellow Essex resident Megan McKenna.</p>
      <p>However, some viewers tried to lip read Lauren as she spoke to her friend and were convinced she had no idea who mark was.</p>
      <p>One viewer asked: "Did Simons partner just ask who @MarkWright_ was live on tv directly in front on the camera?!?!? Love the lady answering clarified he was on Towie"</p>

      <p>Lauren started listening to Mark as he spoke to Dermot but had a baffled look on her face.</p>
      <p>Simon's girlfriend, who is mum to their son Eric, then leaned across the table to seemingly ask her friend a question.</p>
      <p>After getting a response, Lauren then sat back in her chair and clapped Mark while looking towards the camera.</p>

      <p>When Dermot asked who Mark was cheering for, he said: "It's a tough one. Thom Evans is my boy so I obviously want him to win.</p>
      <p>"Megan is an Essex girl who's repping the Essex.</p>
      <p>"And Vinnie is one of my all time heroes. It's tough."</p>

      <p>Dermot pointed out that he had chosen "pretty much the whole semi-final line-up" to support.</p>
      <p>Giggling Mark admitted he was a big fan of the show before finally choosing his favourite to win.</p>
      <p>He added: "I think with what just happened it's got to be Megan. She was phenomenal. [Louis] Walshy's got to win."</p>

      <p>X Factor viewers took to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> after spotting Mark in the audience.</p>
      <p>One viewer asked: "Was that Mark Wright cheering Meghan?"</p>
      <p>"Wtf is @MarkWright_ doing there?," added another.</p>
      <p>A third said: "Mark Wrightâ€™s teeth are keeping the whole audience lit up in the background"</p>
