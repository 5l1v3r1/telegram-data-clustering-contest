      <p>Multiple incidents of robbery using weapons, injuries to victims and threat of violence in Tuggeranong on Saturday night, all believed to involve the same perpetrators, are under active investigation by police.</p>
      <p>The four incidents occurred between 9.30am and 11.30pm and involved up to four men seen driving around the areas of Calwell, Chisholm, Erindale and Kambah in a red or maroon-coloured sedan without a rear bumper.</p>
      <p>The first incident happened outside the Calwell Tavern around 9.47pm when a man is reported to have produced a knife and demanded a woman hand over her handbag. She complied with his demands.</p>
      <p>Some time later at a car park near the Kambah Tavern, a man reportedly made demands of another man, however, nothing was taken.</p>
      <p>At the Domino's pizza outlet in Kambah, a male made demands of the staff, however, he fled the building without taking anything.</p>
      <p>At the Domino's pizza outlet in Erindale demands were allegedly made of staff, however, the perpetrator again fled without taking anything.</p>
      <p>Around 11.13pm at the car park outside the Vikings Chisholm club, a woman was threatened and her handbag stolen. The woman received minor injuries as a result of the incident.</p>
      <p>Police are appealing for anyone who may have dash cam footage or had seen the vehicle driving around Tuggeranong on Saturday night with the men inside, or may have witnessed any of the incidents, to contact Crime Stoppers either via the website or by calling 1800 333 000.</p>
