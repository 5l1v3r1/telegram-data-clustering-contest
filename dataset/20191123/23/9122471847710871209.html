      <h1>Kirk Herbstreit Addresses Oklahoma vs. Georgia Debate</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T23:28:47+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 23:28</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/danlyons" target="_blank">Dan Lyons</a></address>
      <p>Oklahoma football is no stranger to the College Football Playoff, but the Sooners don’t seem to have a real shot at the field this year, despite having just one-loss and a chance at the conference title. Oklahoma was just ninth in latest <a href="https://thespun.com/college-football/college-football-playoff-rankings-after-week-12">College Football Playoff ranking</a>, after a furious comeback to hand Baylor its first loss.</p>
      <p>Oklahoma’s comeback against Baylor was previewed a bit in that lone loss. The Sooners nearly did the same to Kansas State, but ultimately fell to the Wildcats 48-41.</p>
      <p>A fan asked Kirk Herbstreit why Oklahoma sits so far behind No. 4 Georgia at this point, despite a big different in the two teams’ losses.</p>
      <p>The Sooners fell to a decent bowl team on the road. Georgia, meanwhile, fell to a bad South Carolina team playing its third quarterback down the stretch.</p>
      <p>Herbstreit defended the ranking disparity, saying that while Georgia’s loss is much worse than Oklahoma’s, Georgia gets the big edge because of impressive wins over teams like Notre Dame, Florida, and Auburn. The Big 12 is quietly down this year, and OU hasn’t exactly run away from teams as of late.</p>

      <p>Georgia doesn’t always jump off the page, in part due to an old school offense that isn’t built to throttle teams. It is hard to deny what the Dawgs have done most of the year, even if that Gamecocks loss is glaring.</p>
      <p>OU has TCU at 8 p.m. tonight. The Sooners will need to really run things up against the Horned Frogs and Oklahoma State next weekend to try and impress the selection committee from here on out.</p>
