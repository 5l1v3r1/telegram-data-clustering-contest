      <p><b>Mumbai: </b>After he joined hands with the BJP in a bid to form the next government, NCP leader Ajit Pawar, termed a rebel MLA by the party, was sacked as the leader of NCP legislative party. State NCP chief Jayant Patil was elected the new legislative party leader in a meeting called by party chief Sharad Pawar. This happened after Ajit Pawar purportedly broke the party and supported BJP to clandestinely form the government overnight. “The decision to remove Ajit Pawar from the position of leader of legislative party was taken at the meeting of MLAs called by Sharad Pawar,” said a NCP source. As per the NCP’s statement, Pawar and Jayant Patil will take a final decision on Ajit Pawar’s future in the party. The BJP termed Ajit Pawar’s sacking from the post of NCP’s legislative party chief “illegal.”</p>
      <p>BJP leader Ashish Shelar said, “Ajit Pawar was elected as the legislative party leader on November 30 and such letter was submitted to the  Governor. Based on that letter, the Govenor took his decision to give oath to Devendra Fadnavis and Mr Pawar. After the governor has taken his decision, any decision to change the legislative party leader can only be taken after consulting the governor. Therefore, the decision announced by NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik on Saturday is illegal. Mr Pawar is still the legislative party leader of NCP.”</p>
