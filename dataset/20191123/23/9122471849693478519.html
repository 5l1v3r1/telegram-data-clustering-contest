      <p>The Buckeyes’ celebration after beating No. 8 Penn State on Saturday was short lived. Ryan Day and his players immediately had to shift their focus to the Michigan Wolverines. The massive rivalry will be played next Saturday.</p>
      <p>But make no mistake – Day and the Buckeyes have been thinking about this game for a long time. In fact, the Ohio State head coach revealed the Buckeyes talk about Michigan (The Team Up North to those within the program) every day.</p>
      <blockquote>“The Team Up North is something we talk about every day,” Day said following Ohio State’s win over Penn State on Saturday, via <a href="https://twitter.com/chasshill/status/1198347168425422848">Colin Hass-Hill</a>.</blockquote>
