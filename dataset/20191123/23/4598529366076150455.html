      <p>House Armed Services Committee Chair Adam Smith (D-WA) said on Saturday that Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA) faces an ethics investigation for allegedly working with Lev Parnas, one of Rudy Giuliani’s indicted associates.</p>
      <p>During an interview on “AM Joy,” MSNBC host Joy Ann Reid asked Smith about a potential ethics investigation into Nunes after Parnas’ attorney told the <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/lev-parnas-helped-rep-devin-nunes-investigations?via=twitter_page">Daily Beast</a> on Wednesday that his client had arranged contacts for Nunes in 2018 to help with his “investigations.”</p>
      <p>“Quite likely, without question,” Smith responded.</p>
      <p>In addition to the Daily Beast report, another one of Parnas’ lawyers told <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/22/politics/nunes-vienna-trip-ukrainian-prosecutor-biden/index.html">CNN</a> on Friday that former Ukrainian Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin told Parnas he had met with Nunes to dig up dirt on Joe Biden.</p>
      <p>Joseph Bondy, the attorney who spoke to CNN, said that his client is will to testify to Congress on Nunes’ alleged dealings in Ukraine.</p>
      <p>As ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, Nunes has used his position to rail constantly against the impeachment probe into President Donald Trump’s Ukraine scheme.</p>
