      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/manchester-united-fc/">Manchester United</a> boss <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/ole-gunnar-solskjaer/">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a> has suggested he could make loan signings in the January transfer window due to the unavailability of his long-term targets.</p>
      <p>The Norwegian has been given around £100m to spend in January following the club’s inability to replace <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/romelu-lukaku/">Romelu Lukaku</a> last summer after his £74m move to Inter Milan.</p>
      <p>United agreed a deal to sign <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/juventus/">Juventus</a> star Paulo Dybala but refused to meet the Argentine’s wage demands, while a move for team-mate Mario Mandzukic failed to get over the line.</p>
      <p>The Red Devils have a long-term interest in Dortmund star Jadon Sancho and Red Bull Salzburg ace Erling Haaland but neither player is likely to be available in January.</p>

      <p>That could revive the Mandzukic option and Solskjaer says it’s more likely he’ll seek loan deals in the winter market.</p>

      <p>‘It is not about ‘X’ amount of money we have to spend,’ said Solskjaer.</p>
      <p>‘It is about who do we think will be good for the club in the long-term, not just three or four months.</p>
      <p>‘The targets we have are probably not available in January.</p>
      <p>‘Not many clubs want to sell players that they would otherwise want to keep in January. Maybe one or two could be a loan deal but that is not a big money thing, it is just to help the team.’</p>
      <p>United take on Sheffield United at Bramall Lane on Sunday but will be without a number of key players.</p>
      <p>Scott McTominay will miss the fixture as he’s still a fortnight away from recovering from an ankle injury.</p>
      <p>Paul Pogba and Marcos Rojo are also set to miss out, while there are doubts over Axel Tuanzebe.</p>
