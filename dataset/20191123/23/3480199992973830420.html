      <p>Callum Smith survived a stringent examination against John Ryder to hold onto his WBA super-middleweight title at the M&amp;S Bank Arena in Liverpool.</p>
      <p>Smith, a 20-1 on favourite at the first bell, had some anxious moments and was cut badly around the right eye, but took the decision 117-111, 116-112, 116-112 on the judges’ scorecards.</p>
      <p>Ryder never took a backward step and the decision was met with some derision among the crowd.</p>

      <p>“I didn’t underestimate John in training,” Smith told Sky Sports Main Event.</p>
      <p>“I knew he was a tough fighter and it was going to be that type of fight, that he was going to get really close and stop me from what I’m good at.</p>
      <p>“It wasn’t the best performance but I thought I won.</p>
      <p>“He worked hard at the end, but I was due a bad one. It’s the first time I’ve been cut in a fight and I’ll be a better boxer because of it.”</p>
      <p>Ryder has been a notoriously slow starter during his career, but the 31-year-old Londoner began in confident fashion and possibly shaded the opening two rounds.</p>
      <p>Smith’s usual snap in his punching was lacking and he struggled to make his significant reach advantage count against the compact Ryder.</p>
      <p>But Smith launched a flurry of punches at the end of the fifth round, and noticeably had more success when he increased the distance between the two men.</p>

      <p>Ryder refused to be fazed, though, and landed a heavy left in the seventh that had the favourite covering up on the ropes.</p>
      <p>There was a nasty clash of heads in the eighth and Smith was clearly upset by another collision in the ninth as he protested to the referee.</p>
      <p>Ryder had Smith wobbling in the 11th round with a left hook as he sought to finish the fight.</p>
      <p>But Smith held on and was relieved to hear the final bell and to keep hold of his world belt.</p>
