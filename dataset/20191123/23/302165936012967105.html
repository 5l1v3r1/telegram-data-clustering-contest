      <p>LONDON, Nov 24 — Arsenal forward Alexandre Lacazette’s last-gasp strike rescued a point in a 2-2 draw versus Southampton in the Premier League at the Emirates yesterday, a result that extended the Gunners’ winless run to six games in all competitions.</p>
      <p>The visitors, who had picked up one point from their previous eight league games, twice led with goals from Danny Ings and James Ward-Prowse and looked on course for their first league win since mid-September.</p>
      <p>But Lacazette, who had also cancelled out Southampton’s early opener, pounced late, although the home fans remained unimpressed and boos echoed round the ground at the end.</p>
      <p>The draw left Arsenal in seventh place with 18 points from 13 games, while second-bottom Saints have nine.</p>
      <p>Ings opened the scoring with his seventh goal in eight games after Ryan Bertrand rolled a quick free-kick into his path after eight minutes. The goal stood even though Arsenal complained that the ball was still moving when the free-kick was taken.</p>
      <p>Lacazette equalised 10 minutes later but Southampton always looked dangerous and were awarded a spot kick when Ings was dragged back by Kieran Tierney.</p>
      <p>Although Bernd Leno saved Ward-Prowse’s shot, the midfielder followed up as Saints scented three points.</p>
      <p>It was not to be as Lacazette’s final strike salvaged a draw for the home side but that will hardly ease the pressure on manager Unai Emery, who chose not to celebrate the goal.</p>
      <p>It was another poor performance by Arsenal, with Spaniard Emery appearing to concede he made a mistake in fielding a three-man defence by bringing on forward Nicolas Pepe for defender Calum Chambers at halftime.</p>
      <p>Although the switch injected some life into Arsenal, they were lucky to escape with a point with Ward-Prowse admitting Saints’ were kicking themselves at not holding on for the win.</p>
      <p>“We dominated the game and put Arsenal under pressure,” he said. “But we were not clinical enough in the last 20 minutes to put the game to bed. We’re kicking ourselves.</p>
      <p>“On a positive note, it’s a building block for us and we have some winnable games coming up.” — Reuters</p>
