      <h3>Frank Lampard says he is hoping that Callum Hudson-Odoi’s hamstring injury is a “short-term” issue after the Chelsea FC attacker returned from England duty with a knock.</h3>
      <p>The 19-year-old played 59 minutes of Chelsea FC’s 4-0 win over Kosovo during the international break but picked up a minor issue while on duty with Gareth Southgate’s squad.</p>
      <p>Hudson-Odoi has only just returned to action for Chelsea FC after a lengthy lay-off with an Achilles injury.</p>
      <p>Lampard is hopeful that the teenager’s latest setback will not prove to be a serious one, with the hectic festive period in the Premier League fast approaching.</p>
      <p>Speaking in an interview with Chelsea FC’s <a href="https://www.chelseafc.com/en/news/2019/11/22/frank-lampard-updates-on-christian-pulisic-and-callum-hudson-odo">website</a> before Saturday’s trip to Manchester City, Lampard said: “Callum is probably the one who has a hamstring issue picked up in the England game so he will struggle to be in contention for this game [against Man City] but we’re hoping it’s more short-term.”</p>
      <p>Chelsea FC will return to Champions League action on Wednesday night with a trip to Valencia.</p>
      <p>The Blues will then switch their focus back to Premier League affairs and their home clash against West Ham United on Saturday 30 November.</p>
      <p>Chelsea FC are aiming to maintain their spot in the top four this season after they finished third under Maurizio Sarri and won the Europa League last season.</p>
