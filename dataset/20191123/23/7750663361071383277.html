      <p>The Magpies scored the only goal of the game in the 24th minute when <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/matt-challoner/"><b>Matt Challoner</b></a> intercepted a pass and played the ball to <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/mark-ross/"><b>Mark Ross</b></a>, whose cross was headed past the goalkeeper by <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/marcus-carver/"><b>Marcus Carver</b></a>.</p>
      <p>The hosts were given the chance to double their advantage from the penalty spot whenÂ Charles Vernam was brought down after 52 minutes.</p>
      <p>Vernam stepped up to take the spot-kick but Gulls goalkeeper <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/shaun-macdonald/"><b>Shaun MacDonald</b></a> saved.</p>
      <p>Torquay dominated possession as time ticked away at Victory Park, but they were unable to find an equaliser that would have prevented a second successive defeat.</p>
