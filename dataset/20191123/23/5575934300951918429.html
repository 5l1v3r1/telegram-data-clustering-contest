      <p>SSE ARENA, LONDON – Michael “Venom” Page just iced another overmatched opponent in the opening round of his Bellator 235 fight at the SSE Arena in London.</p>
      <p>With his ballerino-like stance, low guard, and unconventional strikes, Page opened numerous opportunities against Giovanni Melillo, who was just waiting to be hit.</p>
      <p>Perhaps inspired by the crowd chanting “f— him up, f— him up, f— him up,” Page closed the distance and launched a powerful, leg-buckling and body-stiffening overhand right, knocking Melillo to the floor in an instant.</p>
      <p>Sensing immediately that it was game over, Page celebrated. It was another quick-fire knockout win in the bank.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Watch the knockout right here:</b>

      <p>Melillo was never expected to prove tough opposition for Page, as the 13-4 fighter, a Bellator debutant, was brought in as a late replacement after the original opponent, the 16-3 welterweight Derek Anderson, withdrew because of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B43S8CSgDGU/?utm_source=ig_embed">a groin injury</a> earlier this month.</p>
      <p>But all “Venom” could do after suffering the sole blemish of his career two fights ago was continue to tally wins, highlight-reel knockouts, and capitalise on his microphone time as he campaigns for the one thing that currently drives him – a high-profile rematch against Douglas Lima.</p>
      <p>The Brazilian Muay Thai expert remains the only fighter to beat Page after hammering him with a brutal second round knockout at Bellator 221 in Illinois, May.</p>
      <p>Page has repeatedly challenged Lima to a second showdown which would now be on an even greater stage as Lima has gone on to win the Bellator welterweight championship, the Bellator Grand Prix, and a $US1 million paycheck.</p>
      <p>It is a ruckus Lima himself entertains, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/michael-venom-page-confident-he-would-upset-douglas-lima-2019-11">telling Business Insider recently that if Page keeps winning, they can throw down once more</a>. Well, Page now has two wins since losing to Lima. And he’s still campaigning for that do-over.</p>
      <p>Even before he mauled Melillo, Page told Business Insider that, yeah, Lima is “dangerous” but he is confident he can reverse that May loss, beat Lima, equalizing the scoreline.</p>
      <p>And, after his win on Saturday, November 23, Page said: “London, I love you guys. In the crowd, I see family, friends, my supporters. I’m the one and only MVP – it doesn’t matter who steps in the cage. Boom!”</p>
      <p>He added, to cheers: “Who wants to see me fight Douglas Lima again? He’s got the belt, I got a lot of respect for him, but I want to take something back that he stole from me.”</p>
      <p>In the co-main event earlier in the night, Fabian Edwards edged past Mike Shipman with a split decision that enraged a small group of observers so much they bundled over media members in press row and stopped short of invading the cage when they were confronted by bemused security.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The rivalry between Shipman and Edwards had been built as one of the most compelling in Bellator’s European Series this year.</p>
      <p>The two middleweights faced-off in front of the press for the first time at a hotel near Dublin airport two months ago, a media event which Business Insider attended, and the tension proved palpable.</p>
      <p>Finally within spitting distance of each other in September, fists looked like they could fly at a moment’s notice. The bad blood even threatened to spill over at the pre-fight weigh-in on Friday, but the athletes were quickly separated before they could do any real, lasting, damage.</p>
      <p>Yes, three rounds of unarmed combat on a blood-stained canvas within a Bellator-branded cage was always the only way this rivalry could be settled – but the bout itself took a while to get started, if it ever really did.</p>
      <p>What promised to be a Bellator masterpiece was little more than a damp squib with wild scoring – 29-28, 28-29, 30-27 to Edwards. A rematch may be needed, providing people would actually want to watch it.</p>
