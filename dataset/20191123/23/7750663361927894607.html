      <h1>Angelo Alessio: 'Kilmarnock deserved comfortable win over Hearts'</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/kilmarnock/"><b>Kilmarnock</b></a> manager <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/angelo-alessio/"><b>Angelo Alessio</b></a> praised his side's professionalism after they came firing out of the traps to stun struggling <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/hearts/"><b>Hearts</b></a> in the Ladbrokes Premiership.</h2>

      <p>The Rugby Park side struck three goals in a crazy opening 16-minute spell that was inspired by veteran winger <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/chris-burke/"><b>Chris Burke</b></a>.</p>
      <p>The 35-year-old contributed two goals and an assist as Kilmarnock moved within three points of third-placed Aberdeen with a 3-0 victory.</p>
      <p>"It's difficult to start like that every week but today is perfect because we scored three goals in 20 minutes," said Alessio.</p>
      <p>"Every game in this league is tough but I think the players entered the pitch very well, with a good approach and attitude.</p>
      <p>"We deserved to score three goals because we created a lot of chances in 30 minutes and we deserved to win.</p>
      <p>"Two months ago our difficulty was scoring goals and now we score three goals early on. We are happy but we need to continue to improve.</p>
      <p>"I'm pleased but I've asked the players to recover in the right way as we have lots of games coming up.</p>
      <p>"We have Rangers, Celtic and St Mirren away so it was important to win this game today and try and get as many points as possible from those games."</p>
      <p>Former Scotland international Burke fired the hosts ahead after nine minutes after he was released by an excellent pass by <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/mohamed-el-makrini/"><b>Mohamed El Makrini</b></a>.</p>
      <p>The outstanding Burke went from scorer to provider in the 13th minute when he produced a stunning cross for <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/eamonn-brophy/"><b>Eamonn Brophy</b></a> to power a header home.</p>
      <p>The experienced Burke then added his second after a devastating counter-attack.</p>
      <p>All three of Kilmarnock's goals came down Hearts' left-hand side, where Aaron Hickey endured a difficult afternoon and was substituted at the break.</p>
      <p>Hearts interim manager Austin MacPhee bemoaned his players' defending during a costly eight-minute spell.</p>
      <p>"It's three very preventable goals and the players are as angry as me. We reacted poorly to the first goal and lacked composure," he said.</p>
      <p>"For the second goal, Brophy drifts between our centre-backs who aren't picking up a player. We had seven players to their three in the box and we have to deal with men in those situations.</p>
      <p>"We don't confront Burke for 35 yards and he scores from eight yards for the third goal.</p>
      <p>"They're basic fundamental defensive errors and preventable goals. Kilmarnock are a team who play low, the first goal is so important here because we need to bring them out."</p>
