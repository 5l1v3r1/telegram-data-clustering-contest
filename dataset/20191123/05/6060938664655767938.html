      <p>Imagine not being able to fit into the clothes of your choice, owing to your rapidly growing waistline. While battling extra kilos in itself is a difficult task, it is even more difficult for new mothers who are trying hard to come to terms with the sea of changes in their body. When 35-year-old Pooja Pandit saw her weight after giving birth to her daughter, she realised it was time to take control of her life. With enormous support from her husband and sister, she managed to lose a whopping 30 kilos. Here is how she did it:</p>
      <p><b>Name</b>: Pooja Pandit</p>
      <p><b>Age:</b> 35 years</p>
      <p><b>Occupation:</b> Assistant Manager</p>
      <p><b>Height: 5</b> feet 5 inches</p>
      <p><b>Current Weight: </b>62 kgs</p>
      <p><b>Highest weight recorded:</b> 92 kgs</p>
      <p><b>Weight lost:</b> 30 kgs</p>
      <p><b>Duration it took me to lose weight: </b>Less than 5 months</p>
      <p><b>The turning point: </b>I weighed 92 kilos on the day I was going to deliver my baby girl. Post-delivery, I expected to lose at least 6 to 7 kilos, but the weighing scale still showed 89 kilos. I was really disappointed.</p>
      <p>As a result, I had to order a new pair of jeans and dresses as I was no longer able to fit into my old clothes. That was the point my husband, who is a fitness freak, gently nudged me to start disciplining my diet and do some basic work out. I did not want to touch 100 kilos, so I decided to follow his lead.</p>
      <p><b>My breakfast:</b> I keep switching between umpa, dosa chutney, oats porridge, rawa dosa, poha, paneer chunks (170 grams), and idli.</p>
      <p><b>My lunch:</b>1 chapati, 1 bowl of dal and a portion of vegetables</p>
      <p><b>My dinner:</b> 1 chapati, 1 bowl of dal and a portion of vegetables. I also switch between two pieces of fish and chicken, a bowl of rice and dal</p>
      <p><b>I indulge in:</b> I love exploring a variety of food options and do not believe in completely abandoning any food group. Hence, I make it a point to stay balanced when it comes to cheat days.</p>
      <p><b>My workout: </b>Since I am not someone who likes going to the gym, I make it a point to do brisk walking for 6 to 8 kilometres and swimming for an hour daily.</p>
      <p><b>Fitness secrets I unveiled: </b>Your diet plays a MAJOR role in your <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/weight-loss">weight loss</a>. You also need to be patient and understand that there is no shortcut to weight loss.</p>
      <p><b>I indulge in: </b>I reserve my cheat days only for certain occasions. I also make it a point to work out hard extra if I feel that I am deviating from my journey.</p>
      <p><b>What are the lifestyle changes you made?</b> I made it a point to keep a check on all the calorie intake. I stopped eating and drinking anything which had a lot of sugar in it. This included chocolates, fried food items and aerated drinks.</p>
      <p><b>How do you ensure you donâ€™t lose focus? </b>My husband Vinayak played a crucial role in my weight loss journey. He helped me stay focused and consistent.</p>
      <p><b>What was the lowest point for you? I</b> realised that I was rapidly gaining weight and as a result, I was not able to fit into any of the clothes of my choice. I was also worried about the comments that people would make once I joined my work again. I was not confident while clicking photographs and posed sideways to hide my fat. Last but not least, I had started looking older than my age.</p>
      <p><b>What shape do you see yourself 10 years down the line? </b>I want to stay fit and healthy and do not wish to become overweight ever again.</p>
      <p><b>How do I stay motivated? </b>I love myself and desperately wanted to get back in shape and feel good about myself. Moreover, my husband and my sister always motivated to lose weight and get healthy. They inspired me to stay focused.</p>
      <p><b>Lessons learnt from weight loss:</b> I have understood that fitness is not a destination, rather a journey. It is also important to understand that life is so much more than the numbers on the weighing scale.</p>
