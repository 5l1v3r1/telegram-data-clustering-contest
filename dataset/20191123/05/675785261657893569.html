      <h1>'Real reason' Mauricio Pochettino's relationship with Tottenham broke down</h1>
      <h2>Mauricio Pochettino was furious after Tottenham reportedly refused his request for cameras around the training ground - then allowed Amazon into his office</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T05:29:05+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 05:29</time> by <a rel="author">Gareth Bicknell</a></address>
      <p>Mauricio Pochettino was furious after Tottenham chiefs put Amazon documentary cameras in his office - having reportedly refused his request to have some installed around the training ground.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/mauricio-pochettino">Pochettino</a> was this week sacked with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> languishing in 14th place in the Premier League, and 12 hours later Jose Mourinho was announced as his replacement.</p>
      <p>Mourinho will now be the star of the Amazon Prime 'All or Nothing' documentary which has been following Tottenham through the season.</p>
      <p>But it was a row over the Amazon cameras which sparked a breakdown in the relationship between Pochettino and Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy - ultimately leading to the Argentine's sacking, according to the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7706989/How-Mauricio-Pochettino-lost-Tottenham-power-struggle-against-Daniel-Levy.html?ico=pushly-notifcation-small">Daily Mail</a> .</p>
      <p>The Mail reports that Pochettino asked to have £80,000 worth of cameras installed around Tottenham's training pitches, but Levy refused to sanction the purchase.</p>

      <p>It is reported that Pochettino even offered to pay for the cameras himself, but was refused permission.</p>
      <p>However, Levy agreed to a £10million offer from Amazon to film a fly-on-the-wall documentary series documenting the club's season.</p>
      <p>As part of the deal, cameras like the ones Pochettino had requested were installed in his office so that every second of his working day in charge of Tottenham could be recorded.</p>

      <p>By contrast, in his previous job as <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/southampton-fc">Southampton</a> boss, Pochettino had reportedly been allowed free rein over training methods and sport science.</p>
      <p>Pochettino's successor Mourinho, who has a history of abrasive dressing room relationships over the years, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/jose-mourinho-makes-feelings-clear-20935660">is believed to be open-minded to the Amazon documentary</a> , but has reportedly made it clear that he will determine when cameras are allowed into his office.</p>
      <p>After his sacking by Tottenham this week, Pochettino has been linked with the hotseats at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> , <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fc-barcelona">Barcelona</a> and Bayern Munich.</p>
