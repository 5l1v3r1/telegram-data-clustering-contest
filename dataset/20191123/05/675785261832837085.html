      <h2>One neighbour said the dog deserves a driving licence after the black Labrador only knocked down a mailbox and some bins in Florida - despite his hour's drive</h2>

      <p>Neighbours were left baffled when a seemingly 'driverless' car was seen reversing in circles for nearly an hour.</p>
      <p>They couldn't work out why silver saloon was going around and around, before eventually knocking off into a post box in a cul de sac on Monday morning.</p>
      <p>In truth, it was all down to dogged determination.</p>
      <p>Inside a black Labrador, left in the car, had moved behind the wheel in the driver's seat, kicking the car in reverse and was driving around in circles for an hour.</p>
      <p>He was going for so long he even left tread marks on the road.</p>

      <p>Neighbours watched in awe and struggled to comprehend out what they saw.</p>
      <p>Anne Sabol, who lives in the area, told WPBF: "At first I thought I saw somebody backing up, but then they kept going, and I'm like 'OK, what're they doing?'</p>
      <p>"Then I saw the dog in the car, a big black lab or something, and I'm like 'This is turning weird'."</p>
      <p>Port St Lucie police and the fire department were called to the scene as they were figuring how to stop the car.</p>
      <p>But soon after the car hit the mailbox and some rubbish bins, it slowed down.</p>
      <p>Then the police opened the door to see a large black Labrador hop out of the driver's seat</p>
      <p>Officers found the dog owner, who asked to remain anonymous, and he explained he had left the car running in the street and the dog somehow changed gears and knocked it into reverse.</p>
      <p>The driver said he will pay and replace the post box.</p>
      <p>Anne was impressed after all and said: "They should give that dog a licence."</p>
