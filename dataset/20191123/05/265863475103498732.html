      <h1>KUWK: Khloe Kardashian Seems To Declare She’s Completely Over Tristan Thompson In New Post – Has No ‘Feelings’ For Him Anymore?</h1>

      <p>Is Khloe Kardashian finally over Tristan Thompson for good? Amid his attempts to win her back, the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star may be telling the world that she has zero feelings for him left!</p>
      <p>The reality TV celeb took to her platform to share one of her signature cryptic messages and this one seems to suggest she no longer feels anything romantic for her ex and baby daddy.</p>
      <p>The quote that got her followers assuming she was sending a message to Tristan, reads: ‘My mother once told me: ‘Every time that you forgive him, he’ll love you a little more, but you’ll stop loving him, so the day he loves you the most you won’t feel anything for him anymore.’’</p>

      <p>That seems to definitely be about Tristan! After all, she’s forgiven him for cheating on her only days before giving birth to their baby daughter, True but he took that for granted.</p>
      <p>The basketball player ended up betraying his baby mama once more, with Kylie Jenner’s now-former BFF, Jordyn Woods, which led to their split.</p>
      <p>But now that Khloe is no longer willing to give him another chance, Tristan may be finally realizing he loves her more than any other woman as he’s been fighting hard to win her back.</p>
      <p>In other words, this is totally the point in which he seems to love and appreciate her the most while Khloe is the opposite, as she is moving on from their failed relationship for good.</p>
      <p>As far as their co-parenting relationship is concerned, one source previously shared with HollywoodLife: ‘Right now things are really peaceful and positive between Khloe and Tristan. It’s taken lots of personal growth and maturity on both sides to get to this point. She is proud of where they’re at.’</p>
