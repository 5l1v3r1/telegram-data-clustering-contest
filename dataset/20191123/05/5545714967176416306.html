      <p>We're at the end of another week. The nights are drawing in and the days are getting colder, (at least in my neck of the woods), and so now is the time to cuddle up with loved ones, be they human, pets, anime characters, or fresh out the oven cake (yeah, that last one is me). Whatever you have planned for the upcoming weekend, I hope its a happy and fun one.<br/><br/>I've really let the video game side down this week. Keeping busy with various on-site and IRL situations, I've unfortunately had little time to delve into digital worlds. I did wind up Teyon's <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../post.phtml?pk=572832&amp;preview=ddf9294b7fe5061519cf6c33c368a50d"><i>Terminator: Resistance</i></a>, and throw down a few times on <i>Mortal Kombat 11</i>, but overall my playtime was slim, (unlike my waist after the aforementioned cake.)<br/><br/>I'm sure all y'all have been far more successful with your gaming exploits, especially given the run of excellent titles that have hit the market this season. It'll be December soon, bringing with it the annual tradition of arguing about the best games of the year, so be sure to get all of 2019's greatest down, to make sure you have plenty of choice when the time comes.<br/><br/>Have a wonderful weekend, from all of us at Destructoid.</p>
