      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T05:54:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 05:54</time> by <a rel="author">Press Trust of India</a></address>
      <p>Delhi recorded a marginal improvement in the air quality on Saturday morning due to a slight increase in wind speed.</p>
      <p>The overall <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/about/what-is-air-quality-index">air quality index </a>in the city read 340 at 9 am, down from 360 at 4 pm on Friday.</p>
      <p>Most of the air quality monitoring stations in Delhi recorded AQI in the very poor category.</p>
      <p>Nehru Nagar was the most-polluted area with an AQI of 387, while Shadipur (268) was the least polluted.</p>
      <p>Neighbouring Ghaziabad (380), Greater Noida (364), Gurgaon (310), Faridabad (318) and Noida (349) also recorded a slight dip in pollution levels.</p>
      <p>Weather experts had earlier said an increase in wind speed would result in some improvement in air quality on Saturday and Sunday.</p>
      <p>However, pollution is expected to increase again from Monday due to a dip in wind speed under the influence of a fresh western disturbance.</p>
