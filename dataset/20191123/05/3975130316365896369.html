      <p><a href="https://science.slashdot.org/~PolygamousRanchKid+">PolygamousRanchKid </a>brings this news from CNN: <i>Physics centers essentially on four forces that control our known, visible universe, governing everything from the production of heat in the sun to the way your laptop works. They are gravity, electromagnetism, the weak nuclear force, and the strong force.<br/><br/>New research may be leading us closer to one more.<br/><br/>Scientists at the Institute for Nuclear Research at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences (Atomki) have posted findings <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/11/22/world/fifth-force-of-nature-scn-trnd/index.html">showing what could be an example of that fifth force at work</a>. The scientists were closely watching how an excited helium atom emitted light as it decayed. The particles <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10459">split at an unusual angle -- 115 degrees</a> -- which couldn't be explained by known physics. The study's lead scientist, Attila Krasznahorkay, told CNN that this was the second time his team had detected a new particle, which they call X17, because they calculated its mass at 17 megaelectronvolts. "X17 could be a particle, which connects our visible world with the dark matter," he said in an email.<br/><br/>Jonathan Feng, a professor of physics and astronomy at the University of California at Irvine told CNN he's been following the Hungarian team's work for years, and believes its research is shaping up to be a game changer. If these results can be replicated, "this would be a no-brainer Nobel Prize," he said... They're leading us closer to what's considered the Holy Grail in physics, which Albert Einstein had pursued but never achieved. Physicists hope to create a "unified field theory," which would coherently explain all cosmic forces from the formation of galaxies down to the quirks of quarks.</i></p>
