      <p>Some of the top male curlers in the world are currently in Penticton, part of the sold-out Ashley Homestore Curling Classic.</p>
      <p>Twenty-four teams from around the world have come to town, competing for $84,000 worth of cash prizes. Top teams from around Canada are here alongside teams from the United States and Scotland. </p>
      <p>"First place gets 20 grand," said chair of the event Cathy Jones, adding that $12,000 from the overall purse is kept for the Penticton curling community and the rest is shared between the top eight teams. </p>
      <p>The lineup of curlers this year is star-studded. </p>
      <p>"We have 12 gold medalists, we have 15 of the top 20 teams in Canada here," Jones said. "All the boys are here. They look forward to it, they wait for it, and this is their number one spot every time the tour comes up."</p>
      <p>And it's not just about the money. </p>
      <p>"Curlers get rankings throughout the year for cash earnings, and point earnings, so they want to get to these spiels where it's ranking them higher and higher and higher," Jones explained. </p>
      <p>Spectator tickets for the event are sold out, but the action is streamed live on the Penticton Curling Club's website <a href="https://pentictoncurlingclub.ca/">here</a>. Jones said they see fans from around the world. </p>
      <p>"To put in perspective, last year, I got a call saying 'Can you have the announcer turn their volume up just a bit?' I said 'Where are you calling from?' and they said 'Scotland,'" Jones said. </p>
      <p>"So it made it really real that around the world, people were watching Penticton. </p>
      <p>The event was originally formed to help local B.C. teams get to an international calibre.</p>
      <p>"Gain the experience, gain the recognition so that eventually they might become the next B.C. Brier, or next world champion," Jones said. </p>
      <p>The tournament runs until Sunday at the Penticton Curling Club.</p>
