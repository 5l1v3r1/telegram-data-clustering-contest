      <p>It's been more than three and a half years since B.C. declared a <a href="https://www.castanet.net/news/BC/163258/emergency-over-ods">public emergency</a> over the opioid crisis, but Kelowna is still “incredibly under-resourced" when it comes to delivering addiction recovery services.</p>
      <p>The Bridge Youth and Family Services has been providing a wide range of services in Kelowna for 50 years, and for the past six, they've offered recovery services like a week-long detox and a six-week intensive live-in treatment program.</p>
      <p>The Bridge is a publicly-funded non-profit organization, which means they can offer their services at no charge to marginalized members of the community. But executive director Celine Thompson says they don't have the resources to meet the high demand.</p>
      <p>“This community is incredibly under-resourced,” Thompson said. “Individuals that are identifying as willing, able and really wanting support and help have absolutely nowhere to turn.”</p>
      <p>There area 293 publicly-funded long-term residential addiction treatment beds in B.C., 20 of which are in Kelowna, offered through The Bridge. The government spent $73.65 million on treatment and recovery beds in the 2018/19 fiscal year, but Thompson says locally, it hasn't been enough.</p>
      <p>“If you can't respond to that moment of courage that they have when they're looking for another option, you've really lost them. And that's particularly true for young people,” Thompson said.</p>
      <p>Addiction and mental health issues have been a factor in the <a href="https://www.castanet.net/news/Kelowna/271051/tent-city-a-safety-concern">growing homeless problem</a> in downtown Kelowna, centred around Leon Avenue. Thompson says those on the street who are struggling with addiction have nowhere to turn.</p>
      <p>“When we're seeing spillover effects on Leon Avenue or elsewhere, it comes really as no surprise,” she said. “This notion that 'oh, if they just went to treatment,' is a fallacy, there's no treatment to go to. Doubly so for young people.</p>
      <p>“There are a number of people that we speak to all the time that are just dying to get in.”</p>
      <p>While there are several private facilities in Kelowna, prices can be <a href="http://www.optionsokanagan.com/feestructure.php">more than $12,000</a> for a month stay. A local seven-day detox program <a href="https://www.valiantrecovery.com/luxury-cost.html">costs $4,000</a>.</p>
      <p>A recent <a href="https://www.castanet.net/news/Kelowna/271060/A-new-report-suggests-Kelowna-RCMP-ranks-need-to-swell-by-84">RCMP resource review</a> prepared for the City of Kelowna identified the lack of residential treatment beds in the city as a key issue for policing, as officers are responding to more calls for at-risk and vulnerable people.</p>
      <p>"These increasing demands are due, in part, to downloading that has occurred as a consequence of the provincial government failing to provide adequate funding for mental health and social services, housing, treatment, and other services," the report states. "The police should not be the default service to respond to situations arising due the failure of the provincial government to provide resources and programs for these populations."</p>
      <p>Several BC Housing-funded supportive housing developments going up in Kelowna have been the <a href="https://www.castanet.net/news/Kelowna/261481/mccurdy-model-changed">centre of controversy</a> over the past year, with neighbours concerned about the impact the developments have on the surrounding areas. The developments are part of Kelowna's “housing first” strategy, which works to get people struggling with homelessness off the street first, before addressing other issues like addiction.</p>
      <p>In contrast, The Bridge offers supportive recovery housing beds for adults in Kelowna, where those in recovery typically live for up to six months.</p>
      <p>“Our services are staffed with people that are there to support the person in their recovery journey. They're there to continue on that recovery path,” said John Yarschenko, director of recovery and addiction services. “Ours is focused on recovery as the purpose for being there, where (with supportive housing) the housing is the focus.”</p>
      <p>Kelowna city councillor Ryan Donn says council is waiting to hear back from the city's Journey Home Society in the spring to learn what additional supports, like addiction recovery services, are required in the city.</p>
