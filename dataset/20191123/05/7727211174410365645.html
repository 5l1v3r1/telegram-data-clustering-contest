      <h1>Everton prepare to regenerate as David Unsworth names six teenagers in starting XI for Tottenham defeat</h1>
      <h2>Everton's winless Premier League run extended to a seventh game but it felt like the start of something new, says Sam Carroll</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T05:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 05:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/sam-carroll/" target="_blank">Sam Carroll</a></address>
      <p>It was a night that will leave <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/dave-unsworth">David Unsworth</a> disappointed but looking to the future. <br/><br/><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/everton-fc">Everton</a>, defending their Premier League 2 crown but winless in six games, ensured the streak continued to seven with a 3-1 defeat against Tottenham Hotspur at Southport.<br/><br/>First-half goals from Dilan Markanday and Armando Shashoua left the under-23s with an uphill challenge at the break but Shashoua's second with over half-an-hour remaining dashed any hopes of a comeback despite Dennis Adeniran's consolation and a flurry of late pressure. <br/><br/>Unsworth will, obviously, hope it heads in a different direction results-wise from here but it felt, in some ways, like the start of something new.<br/><br/>With Morgan Feeney and Lewis Gibson both missing from the heart of defence, the manager was forced to start a back five that has not started a competitive game together.</p>
      <p>Harry Tyrer, the goalkeeper, is just 17 while centre-back Ryan Astley is a year older. Kyle John, at left-back, is the same age, Alex Denny 19 and Matty Foulds, expected to move on at the end of the campaign when his contract expires, the eldest at 21.<br/><br/>All this while being screened by a 16-year-old midfielder in the form of Tyler Onyango. It is not to say it was a totally new side. Antony Evans, the skipper, is another who will be eyeing a move away from Goodison Park in the near future while Harry Charsley's short-team deal expires in January.<br/><br/>Nathangelo Markelo will have suitors if his first-team chances remain distant while Dennis Adeniran, who trains with Marco Silva's squad, could seek a temporary switch in January if Everton move for a senior midfielder.</p>

      <p>But with six teenagers starting - and another, in the form of Manasse Mampala, being introduced from the bench alongside 20-year-old Con Ouzounidis - the time seems right for Unsworth and his team to regenerate.<br/><br/>The manager has been here before after winning the title in 2017.<br/><br/>Jonjoe Kenny, Tom Davies, Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Ademola Lookman all made appearances that season as well as the likes of Liam Walsh, Matthew Pennington and David Henen.<br/><br/>Unsworth must now ensure the progression of Tyrer, Denny, Onyango and co. heads in the same direction as the stars plying their trade in Everton's first-team, the Football League and beyond.<br/><br/>The loss to Tottenham was by no means an audition and, in fairness, by no means did the new-look defence let anybody down. They will, without a doubt, have more chances to impress. <br/><br/>But lapses at this level will be punished more severely than what the young stars are used to and getting up to speed will take some time.</p>
      <p>Hopefully a cold Southport evening can be their first lesson on the way to the Premier League, to Goodison Park and senior football.</p>
      <p>For now, Unsworth has been given the initial tools for a new challenge.<br/><br/>He will hope they have the drive and character of former graduates that enables them not only to compete and gain results for his side, but to eventually make that next - and hardest - step to the professional game.</p>
