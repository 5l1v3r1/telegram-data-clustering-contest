      <p>The Lagos State Governor, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has asked the China Development Bank to increase its investment in Nigeria to $1bn.</p>
      <p>Sanwo-Olu, who made the request during a meeting with the bank’s President, Mr Quyang Weimin, said it would help the state’s infrastructural needs.</p>
      <p>The state government said in a statement on Friday that the governor was embarking on an investment drive to China.</p>
      <p>Sanwo-Olu was quoted to have said there were huge developmental projects in Lagos the bank could support the state in developing.</p>
      <p>He said, “We are determined to build a 21st century economy, and infrastructural development is one of the key deliverables for a modern economic system and society to run efficiently and effectively.</p>
      <p>“With functional infrastructure, businesses will thrive and the city will be more habitable. So, as a government, we are talking to you now about our needs and the areas of intervention where we require your support.</p>
      <p>“Even though I know that you have to consider a lot of factors as a bank, I can assure you that you cannot get it wrong with Lagos and Nigeria as a whole.</p>
      <p>“Lagos is Africa’s seventh largest economy and the most populous on the continent. The state has enjoyed political stability for 20 years and has consistently grown across key economic indices.”</p>
      <p>He said the bank should be involved in the Fourth Mainland Bridge construction, railway projects, road construction around the free trade zone and water projects.</p>
      <p>Weimin was also quoted to have said he had confidence in Lagos State and Nigeria.</p>
      <p>He said, “I am particularly happy that Lagos State has a vibrant and visionary leader who is ready to take the state forward.</p>
      <p>“We are different from commercial banks because we are focused on development and greater good of humanity. We give loans at the lowest cost and very long loan maturity period.”</p>
      <p>Weimin said he had deep interest in the ideas and looked forward to supporting the state.</p>
