      <h1>Lizzo Flaunts Her Bare Behind In New Mirror Selfie &amp; Tells Haters: ‘Kiss’ My Butt’</h1>

      <h4>Lizzo is feeling good has hell….about her bare behind! She took a mirror selfie and shared it with her Instagram followers and also managed to use it to create Homer Simpson’s face.</h4>
      <p>Ahhhh <b>Lizzo</b>. She knew just exactly what fans wanted on a Friday night so she shared a mirrored selfie of her bare backside and butt to her Instagram.  The singer was seated on the side of a bathtub as her long curly hair cascaded down her back. Somehow she managed to superimpose her butt cheeks over a picture of animated Homer Simpson’s mouth, and believe it or not they match exactly. She had a side swipe to the second pic, which is why she had in the caption “kiss my ass, doh! 😩” with the character’s famous catchphrase.</p>
      <p>It was a massive hit with fans. <b>Lil Nas X</b> even wrote in the comments”more please 🤲🏾🤤” which got over 15,000 likes.  BET’s instagram account cheered her on, writing “Go girl!!!” One fan iamcbtho wrote “This how looooooooooooooooooooong my day was. Booty crack for days,” while a user named misss kota called her “Yoooo! The realest ahaaa !! 😂👏🏽😘.”</p>
      <p>It’s not clear if Lizzo — real name <b>Melissa Viviane Jefferson</b> — was just having some Friday night fun with the  Nov. 22 post or if she was clapping back at someone. She <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2019/11/14/cardi-b-lizzo-mean-tweets-response-jimmy-kimmel-video/">spoke about haters</a> in a Sept. interview will Billboard, saying ” I’ve always had to turn haters into congratulators. That’s the thing with my songs and my live shows: I’ve never lost that mentality of ‘I have to win you over,’ and I’m never going to, because I didn’t learn that way. I have muscle memory in this.”</p>

      <p>Lizzo is going to be a very busy lady with awards season getting underway. On Sun. Nov. 24 she’s up for three American Music Awards, including Best New Artist, Best Soul/R&amp;B Song for “Juice” and Best Female R&amp;B/Soul Artist. But she’s got an even bigger night ahead on Jan. 26, 2020 <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2019/11/20/2020-grammy-nominations-full-list-nominees/">when the Grammy Awards</a> roll around. When the nominations were revealed on Nov. 20, Lizzo led the pack with a total of eight, including such big categories as Best New Artist, Best Album for “Cuz I Love You” and Best Song for “Truth Hurts.” That’s gotta leave her <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2019/10/25/lizzo-ariana-grande-good-as-hell-remix-collab-song/">feeling good as hell</a>.</p>
