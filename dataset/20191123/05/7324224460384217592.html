      <h2>Wolves are back in action at Bournemouth after a rewarding international break for several players.</h2>

      <p>Of course, a part of me would like to see as many as possible having a rest over these breaks, but those who have gone away seem to be coming back all the better for representing their countries.</p>
      <p>Diogo Jota, at long last, made his much-deserved Portugal debut and Raul Jimenez scored some more goals for Mexico.</p>
      <p>And I was delighted to see Patrick Cutrone get himself a couple while with Italy Under-21s.</p>
      <p>He got a brace in a Euro qualifier against Iceland, and his confidence will have been boosted by that.</p>
      <p>Confidence is a huge thing as a striker – so much of the game is about it – and, hopefully, he can use those goals to his advantage with Wolves now.</p>
      <p>While I do not expect him to be starting against the Cherries today, his chance will come.</p>
      <p>When it does too, he needs to work hard – but not get too worked up.</p>
      <p>I’ve liked what I’ve seen from the Italian so far, but he does seem to have been trying a little bit too hard at times.</p>
      <p>Jimenez has set the perfect example to follow. His attitude is impeccable and he really is flying at the moment.</p>
      <p>You don’t score goals without working hard, and Jimenez knows that. He puts in the effort – and he gets the results.</p>
      <p>He is massively talented, but he mainly gets the goals because of his hard graft.</p>
      <p>Crucially, though, you do not get the sense he is trying too hard.</p>
      <p>It would be lovely for him to get on the scoresheet against Bournemouth as well. These are the kind of matches you want to be winning as they are a hit-and-miss team.</p>
      <p>They’ll beat Manchester United the one week, and lose to Newcastle the next, so it would be great to go there and come away with another victory.</p>
      <p>The win against Villa was fantastic, so it’s about having that snowball effect and extending the unbeaten run in the league to eight games.</p>
      <p>Looking at the season so far, we are in the same position we were in this time last season – 16 points from 12 games.</p>
      <p>So, of course, there is the possibility we could end up finishing seventh again despite the extra games. But, first and foremost, let’s win today.</p>
