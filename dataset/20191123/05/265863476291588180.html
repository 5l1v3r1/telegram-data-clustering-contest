      <h1>XXXTentacion New Album Bad Vibes Forever Scheduled For December Release</h1>

      <p>According to a report from TMZ.com, fans of XXXTentacion are gearing up to hear the rapper on a new record. His fourth and final posthumous album will be released near the ending of the year on the 6th of December. Titled <i>Bad Vibes Forever</i>, Solomon Sobande, who was the rapper’s manager, stated that the record was a combination of his prior two projects: <i>?</i> and <i>17.</i></p>
      <p>Reportedly, it marks the second album to be released since XXXTentacion was shot to death in Florida. Cleopatra Bernard, the late artist’s mother, is the executive producer and there are a number of big-name artists on it, including Lil Nas X, Mavado, Tory Lanez, as well as Blink-182.</p>
      <p>Additionally, the album will include older songs including “Hearteater” and “Royalty,” the latter of which features the ex-girlfriend of the rapper who once accused him of physically abusing her while she was pregnant.</p>

      <p>As it was previously reported, XXX was shot and killed in June of 2018 when two men wearing sweatshirts rolled up to him at a motorcycle dealership in Florida. Moreover, the shooting was reportedly captured on security cameras as well.</p>
      <p>Currently, XXXTentacion’s titular track is streaming on all platforms, including Spotify, Apple Music, and iTunes. It was reported earlier this year that the rapper’s estate would be releasing several posthumous records under his name.</p>
      <p>As it was noted above, Page Six reported back in October of this year that his girlfriend whom he allegedly abused would appear in a music video. Tentacion, according to his mother, wanted her to appear in one of his music videos.</p>
      <p>Cleopatra uploaded an audio recording of the rapper stating that he wanted to see his girlfriend of the time included in one of his projects in a “weird way.” XXXTentacion explained that it would be “amazing” to bring her on to a project.</p>
      <p>At the time of his tragic passing last year, XXXTentacion was a controversial figure in hip-hop for his alleged indiscretions, including physical abuse.</p>
