      <h3>Jose Mourinho says his Tottenham Hotspur side will be able to challenge for the Premier League title next season.</h3>
      <p>The Portuguese coach is currently getting used to life at his new club after he was brought in to replace Mauricio Pochettino, who was sacked on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>Mourinho takes over at Tottenham with the Lilywhites languishing down in 14th place in the Premier League table and having only won three of their opening 12 games.</p>
      <p>Spurs, who have not won any of their last five games in the Premier League, will be focused on breaking back into the top four this season, with the Lilywhites currently 11 points behind fourth-placed Manchester City.</p>
      <p>Mourinho accepts that Spurs have no chance of winning the title next season, but the former Manchester United boss feels that his side will be able to challenge next term.</p>
      <p>Speaking in an interview quoted by <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/jose-mourinho-tottenham-title-challenge-change-style-11195969/">Metro</a>, Mourinho said: “We cannot win the Premier League this season. We can – I’m not saying we will do – we can win next season.”</p>
      <p>Mourinho was also quizzed about the style of play he plans to implement at the club.</p>
      <p>Asked about the style of play he plans to implement, he replied: “Very similar to before [under Pochettino]. That’s what I keep saying. Very similar to before.</p>
      <p>“Of course I’m going to try to add some details, and sometimes details can make the difference, and progressively we will arrive to a fingerprint.</p>
      <p>“But the style of play has to be always adapted, not just to the club culture but especially the players’ qualities. That’s the way it is.”</p>
      <p>Tottenham will kick off life under their new manager with a trip to West Ham United in the Premier League on Saturday lunchtime.</p>
      <p>Mourinho had been out of work since being sacked by Manchester United back in December of last year.</p>
