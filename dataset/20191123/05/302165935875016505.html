      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 23 — Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad saying ministers could directly award contracts related to their portfolio undermines Pakatan Harapan’s (PH) pledge to eradicate corruption, said Ramkarpal Singh.</p>
      <p>The Bukit Gelugor MP said that even if such awards were legal, they were morally wrong as they would create the perception of favouritism from ministers who indulged.</p>
      <p>Ramkarpal pointed out that the PH pledge to prioritise open tenders were possible was not only to encourage competitiveness, but also to weed out corruption by preventing any single person — even if he is a minister — from being authorised to solely award contracts.</p>
      <p>“The PM’s statement can lead to ministers thinking that they can award contracts as they like as long as it is in their area (whatever that means).</p>
      <p>“This is exactly what Harapan pledged to get rid of!” he said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Ramkarpal then urged the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission not to be swayed by Dr Mahathir’s views, and to investigate any minister suspected of abusing their position to award contracts directly.</p>
      <p>In September, Dr Mahathir announced that the federal government will impose new conditions <a href="https://www.malaymail.com/news/malaysia/2019/09/19/putrajaya-sets-new-curbs-to-direct-tenders-adds-safeguards-to-special-cases/1792097">restricting direct tenders to only exceptional cases</a> and with the express approval of the Finance Ministry.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, however, the prime minister said ministers were allowed to hand out contracts as long as they are within their respective jurisdictions.</p>
      <p>Dr Mahathir was responding to PKR president Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim’s remarks that he had raised concerns about this during a meeting with the prime minister.</p>
      <p>In Parliament this week, MCA president Datuk Seri Wee Ka Siong accused Agriculture and Agro-based Industries Minister Datuk Seri Salahuddin Ayub of <a href="https://www.malaymail.com/news/malaysia/2019/11/21/mca-chief-accuses-salehuddin-ayub-of-giving-out-rm1.4b-jobs-directly/1812019">seeking to directly award RM1.4 billion in contracts</a>.</p>
