        <b>Succession To Mutawalliship By Descendant Through Female Line Not Barred</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <i>Md. Abrar vs. Meghalaya Board of Wakf</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>The Supreme Court <a href="https://www.livelaw.in/news-updates/mutawalliship-by-descendant-through-female-line-148557">held that</a> there is no legal bar on cognatic heirs of the waqif from succeeding to mutawalliship. The bench comprising Justice NV Ramana, Justice Mohan M. Shantanagoudar and Justice Ajay Rastogi reiterated that in order to establish a claim of hereditary succession to mutawalli-ship, the intention of the waqif, as manifested either through the directions given in the waqf deed or the creation of a custom, is of paramount importance.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Female Descendant Cannot Be Mutawalli If Wakif Intended To Exclude Them</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>

      <p>The Supreme Court <a href="https://www.livelaw.in/top-stories/female-descendant-cannot-be-mutawalli-if-wakif-intended-to-exclude-them-148481">observed that</a>, though women can also hold the office of Mutawalli under Mohammedan law, but if the wakif intended to create the Mutawalliship only in favour of male descendants, a female descendant cannot stake any claim to the Mutawalliship of the wakf estate. The bench comprising Justice NV Ramana, Justice Mohan M. Shantanagoudar and Justice Ajay Rastogi observed thus while affirming the cancellation of the appointment of one Nazira Khatoon as the permanent Mutawalli of a wakf estate.</p>
