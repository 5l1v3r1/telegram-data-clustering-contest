      <h1>Healy takes responsibility as Sixers top order fails to fire</h1>

      <p>Sixers superstar Alyssa Healy has taken responsibility for Sydney's faulty top order after the Perth Scorchers skittled the visitors in the first of two WBBL clashes in as many days.</p>
      <p>With Australian all-rounder Ellyse Perry out of the side due to a shoulder injury, the Sixers needed Australian stars Healy, Ash Gardner and English recruit Hollie Armitage to fire in pursuit of Perth's 5-152.</p>
      <p>But the trio could only manage 35 runs between them as the Sixers lost their third straight match, putting their spot in the WBBL finals in doubt.</p>
      <p>Meg Lanning (28) failed to go on with a fine start with the bat but she made what was arguably the play of the match in taking a tough catch to dismiss the Sixers' primary threat with the bat – Healy.</p>

      <p>Healy threw her hands at a good length Natalie Sciver delivery outside off stump to open the Sixers' chase and immediately pinched two runs but that was where her innings started and finished.</p>
      <p>A similar delivery from Sciver two balls later produced a similar shot from Healy and this time, the ball towered above Lanning.</p>
      <p>The Australian skipper covered good ground and recomposed herself to take the prized wicket of Healy, putting Sydney on the back foot immediately.</p>
      <p>"Those balls were in my slot. They're balls I've been putting to the boundary for the last 18 months so for me, I just need to go back and reassess exactly what I want to get out of it," Healy said.</p>
      <p>"I don't think my intent should change – I will always go out there and look to put us in a good position early. It might just be that my decision or my plans are slightly off. I can fix that."</p>
      <p>Healy's dismissal left Ash Gardner and Hollie Armitage to begin the chase. They managed to scrap their way to 12 and 11, respectively, before Armitage was trapped in front by the spin of Nicole Bolton and Gardner was claimed by a screamer of a catch from Chloe Piparo at point.</p>
      <p>Gardner's dismissal left the Sixers in trouble at 3-29 with seven overs gone.</p>
      <p>When Erin Burns was caught by Piparo as well, it was pretty much all over. The wickets flowed and the Sixers finished with 9-100.</p>
      <p>The Scorchers have now leapfrogged the Sixers into third position on the WBBL ladder but Sydney have a chance to erase that deficit in the return fixture on Sunday.</p>
      <p>"We have world class players still sitting in the shed that are just underperforming," Healy said.</p>
      <p>"That's me included. That's where we need to find the spark. I think our international players and our players that have played for Australia for a long period of time need to lift and need to get us in the finals. That's the reality of it at the minute.</p>
      <p>"We will sit down and have a chat about that but at the minute, that's where we are letting ourselves down."</p>
