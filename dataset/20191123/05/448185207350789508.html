      <p>TINSUKIA: All Moran Students’ Union (AMSU), while opposing CAB vehemently, demanded inclusion of ST status in the forthcoming Winter Session of the Parliament. In a press meet at Tinsukia on Friday, AMSU president Arunjyoti Moran said that though the Union Cabinet had given nod to grant Scheduled Tribe status to six communities, the Bill was not in the List of Business. It also threatened to launch a severe form of agitation if not included this time.</p>
      <p>Referring to the controversial CAB, Moran pointed out that in a secular country like ours the conflict on the basis of religion leads to communal disharmony. The AMSU would continue to fight against such ill motives. On NRC, he viewed that the declaration of 1951 as base year was a deceitful strategy of Union Home Minister. If the new base year was made effective and executed in true spirit, the AMSU has no objection, Moran remarked.</p>
