      <h1>John Bolton Back on Twitter, Accuses White House of 'Unfairly' Suppressing His Account</h1>
      <h2>The former national security adviser cryptically teases that the “backstory” behind the ban is coming</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T05:16:15+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 05:16</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thewrap.com/author/lindsey-ellefson/" target="_blank">Lindsey Ellefson</a></address>
      <p>Former national security adviser and ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton tweeted Friday for the first time since leaving his position in September, promising his 783,000 followers “the backstory.”</p>
      <p>Using President Donald Trump’s preferred medium <i>and </i>his signature too-long ellipses at the end of a tweet, Bolton <a href="https://twitter.com/AmbJohnBolton/status/1197862304462901248">wrote</a>, “Glad to be back on Twitter after more than two months. For the backstory, stay tuned……..”</p>

      <p>He <a href="https://twitter.com/AmbJohnBolton/status/1197900337690107904">continued</a>, “We have now liberated the Twitter account, previously suppressed unfairly in the aftermath of my resignation as National Security Advisor. More to come…..”</p>
      <p>Finally, he followed up with this conclusion: “Re: speaking up — since resigning as National Security Advisor, the @WhiteHouse refused to return access to my personal Twitter account. Out of fear of what I may say? To those who speculated I went into hiding, I’m sorry to disappoint!”</p>

      <p>Bolton was called out this week during Congressional hearings in the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump and even by actor Jim Carrey, who accused Bolton of being “silent” was <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/jim-carrey-john-bolton-profile-cowardice-drawing/">“just another profile in cowardice.”</a></p>
      <p>Bolton isn’t exactly being silent about everything, of course. He stepped down from his position in the administration in September and by early November, the Associated Press was reporting he had signed a book deal with Simon &amp; Schuster worth approximately $2 million.</p>
      <p>The title, subject and release date of Bolton’s book are not known and no other details have been made public. With the deal, Bolton joins the growing list of people who have turned a Trump administration job into a lucrative book contract; Nikki Haley, Sean Spicer, and Omarosa Manigault Newman have all published tell-alls of their time working for Trump. Earlier this week, “A Warning,” penned by an anonymous Trump official detailing how Trump is unfit for office, <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/warning-anonymous-trump-official-highlights-takeaways/">was released</a>.</p>
      <p>The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Bolton’s accusation.</p>
