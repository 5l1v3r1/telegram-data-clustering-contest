      <p>Two rear cars on a packed Long Island Railroad train jumped off the track it headed into Jamaica Station on Friday night — but no one was injured in the derailment, authorities said.</p>
      <p>The derailment happened just before 9:30 p.m. on the Babylon line train that departed from Penn Station at about 8:55 p.m., the LIRR said in a statement.</p>
      <p>No one was injured in the mishap.</p>
      <p>The railroad dispatched a rescue train to unload the 600 passengers who were stranded by the derailment.</p>
      <p>Some of the passengers tweeted messages from the train as they waited for more than an hour to get off the stalled train.</p>
      <p>“Passengers getting antsy. Questioning crew, have no answers,” <a href="https://twitter.com/mtaustine/status/1198084424321114112">Twitter user Mike Taustine wrote</a>.</p>
      <p>“Evacuation time!!!! Where’s my rescue train????” <a href="https://twitter.com/stephanietatton/status/1198085735842226176">Stephanie Tatton added</a>.</p>
      <p>Crews from the MTA were also passing out water to stranded passengers. The derailment caused cancellations and delays on the Babylon track.</p>
