      <h1>Ny'ongo Heckled as Youth Forcefully Take Over Funeral</h1>

        <b>Youth in Kisumu disrupted the funeral service of six bouncers killed in Busia as <a href="https://www.kenyans.co.ke/news/46052-governor-nyngo-assumes-mayors-role-us-city-photos">Governor Anyang Nyong'o</a> and his Senator Fred Outa's political differences upsurged. </b>
      </p>
      <p>In a video seen by <i>Kenyans.co.ke</i>, the youths heckled the leaders at the service. They further painfully addressed the leaders on Friday, November 22, highlighting the plight the youth faced in the region.</p>
      <p><i>The Standard</i> was first to report that Outa started the fight when he claimed that Nyong'o was partly to be blamed for the <a href="https://www.kenyans.co.ke/news/46468-6-killed-city-tycoons-funeral-turns-chaotic">death of the six</a>. Outa alleged that the bouncers were fired from their work by Nyong'o in 2017.</p>

      <p>"One of them could not have died this way had he still been working in the county government. Nyong'o is shedding crocodile tears," Outa blasted as the youth turned against each other out of their political alignment. </p>
      <p>Nyong'o, however, played coy alleging that the leaders had misled the youth.</p>
      <p>"I am a father and grandfather to many. I know the challenges facing our people and I ask all of us to join hands so that we work together," the governor urged.</p>
      <p>In the video, the youth alleged that their leaders turned to them during desperate election moments only to dump them later.</p>
      <p>They further blasted them for taking advantage of the youth's needs to campaign and then failed to employ them. </p>
      <p>Kisumu Deputy Governor <b>Mathews Owili</b>, Former governor <b>Jack Ranguma</b>, Woman Representative <b>Rozaah Buyu </b>and MPs <b>Imran Okoth</b> (Kibra), <b>Jared Okello</b> (Nyando), <b>Aduma Owuor </b>(Nyakach) and <b>Onyango K’Oyoo</b> were also present at the funeral service. </p>
      <p>The bouncers were lynched at Masebula village in Busia County where they had been hired to provide security at the funeral of a slain businessman. </p>
      <p>"I call upon the police to conduct speedy investigations to bring to light what circumstances occasioned this heinous act and bring the perpetrators to book," the governor stated after his residents were slained. </p>
