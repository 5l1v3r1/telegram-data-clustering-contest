      <h1>Is Israel Heading Towards a 'Preventive War' Against Iran?</h1>

      <p>On October 10, 2019, during a memorial service in Jerusalem for the fallen soldiers of the 1973 Yom Kippur War, Israeli Prime Minister <a href="https://mfa.gov.il/MFA/PressRoom/2019/Pages/PM-and-DM-Netanyahu-attends-state-memorial-ceremony-for-the-fallen-of-the-1973-Yom-Kippur-War-10-October-2019.aspx">Benjamin Netanyahu spoke bluntly</a> about the conclusions to be drawn from that war: "Few hours before the outbreak of the war," Netanyahu stated, "when it was already clear that the confrontation was inevitable, Israel did not undertake the necessary measures to neutralize the imminent threat.

This is the tremendous spirit that was instilled in us by the generation of the Yom Kippur War."</p>
      <p>This is not the first time that the Israeli prime minister had mentioned the possibility of taking preemptive military action against Iran. The period between 2010–2011 was perhaps the closest Israel had ever been to launching a preemptive strike on Iranian nuclear facilities, with strong support for the initiative coming from both Prime Minister Netanyahu and then-Defense Minister Ehud Barak. What motivated Netanyahu and Barak to consider a preemptive strike on Iranian nuclear facilities? These were the following main premises:</p>
