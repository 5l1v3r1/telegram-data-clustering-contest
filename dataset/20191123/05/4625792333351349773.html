      <h1>VA blasts federal union for allowing 'a culture of sexual harassment' to thrive at highest levels</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T05:01:46+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 05:01</time> by <a rel="author">Russ Read</a></address>
      <p>The Department of Veterans Affairs on Thursday blasted the nation’s largest federal employees union for tolerating a “culture of sexual harassment” and demanded assurances that the union is doing its utmost to protect VA employees.</p>
      <p>“I was disturbed to read recent press accounts that stated leadership in the American Federation of Government Employees’ (AFGE) national headquarters allowed a culture of sexual harassment to develop and thrive at the highest levels of your organization,” VA Secretary Robert Wilkie wrote in a letter to AFGE National Secretary-Treasurer Everett Kelley. The letter, dated Nov. 21, was obtained by the <i>Washington Examiner</i>.</p>
      <p>Ten men and women have come forward claiming to have either experienced or witnessed AFGE President J. David Cox engage in inappropriate behavior ranging from comments about the physical appearance of subordinates to asking a secretary to shower with him.</p>
      <p>Former AFGE Communications Director Brett Copeland <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-28/afge-president-accused-of-sexual-harassment-in-metoo-scandal"><u>recounted</u></a> an incident in which Cox told him that he loved him and put his tongue in his ear while the two were on a business trip in Palm Springs.</p>
      <p>Bre Andrews, a former AFGE political organizer, said Cox’s harassment was “the worst-kept secret” at the union.</p>
      <p>Cox has since taken a leave of absence while the allegations are investigated.</p>
      <p>The AFGE did not respond to the <i>Washington Examiner’s</i> requests for comment.</p>
      <p>“In light of recent events at your organization and the lack of information about how deep this problem goes, I am writing to get your personal and public assurance that you will protect VA employees who are members of your union from any form of harassment by union officials, while thoroughly investigating all allegations of improper behavior,” Wilkie wrote.</p>
      <p>Approximately 260,000 VA employees are represented by the AFGE, according to Wilkie. The union <a href="https://www.afge.org/about-us/">has</a> a total membership of 700,000 federal workers.</p>
      <p>Wilkie’s letter comes days after the VA announced it will begin charging unions for their use of VA space across the country in 2020. Additionally, union representatives will be required to spend 75% of their time on VA business. The new regulations follow a trio of executive orders signed by President Trump in May 2018 aimed to streamline government bureaucracy.</p>
      <p>The AFGE was one of the unions that <a href="https://federalnewsnetwork.com/unions/2018/05/afge-sues-trump-administration-over-recent-executive-order/"><u>sued</u></a> the administration following the signing of the orders, which led to an injunction against them. That injunction has since been overturned on appeal, paving the way for the new VA regulations.</p>
