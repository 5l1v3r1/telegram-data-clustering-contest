      <p>While the Shiv Sena was trying to canvas support from the Congress and the NCP to keep BJP out of power in Maharashtra, a stunning move by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) wherein it roped in NCP's Ajit Pawar and gave him the deputy chief minister's post, has stirred the state's politics and triggered reactions from top leaders across the country.</p>

        <b>Thought was reading fake news: Congress's Singhvi</b>
      </p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Congress leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi called the latest power twist in Maharashtra "surreal".</p>
      <p>In a tweet, Singhvi said, "Surreal what I read about Maharashtra. Thought it was fake news. Candidly and personally speaking, our tripartite negotiations should not have gone on for more than three days...took too long. Window given was grabbed by fast movers. Pawarji tussi grt ho! Amazing if true, still not sure.</p>

        <b>Not behind Ajit Pawar's decision: NCP reacts</b>
      </p>
      <p>While speculations were made that NCP chief Sharad Pawar was behind the political masterstroke, the senior leader has said that he had no hand in his nephew Ajit's astounding decision to join a BJP-led government.</p>
      <p>

        <b>Shiv Sena calls Ajit Pawar traitor</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ajit Pawar has faced backlash from Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut.</p>
      <p>Sanjay Raut, a senior Shiv Sena leader, decried what he described as a "sin": the fact that Ajit Pawar switched allegiances even as his party worked with the Congress and the Sena to form governing coalition that would exclude the BJP.</p>
      <p>Raut said Ajit Pawar had betrayed his uncle, NCP chief Sharad Pawar. He even described Ajit's behaviour on Friday evening, which he appeared to think was suspicious: the NCP leader left suddenly; he "didn't look in our eyes" and was "trying not to face us".</p>
