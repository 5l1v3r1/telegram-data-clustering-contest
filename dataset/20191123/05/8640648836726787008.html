      <h1>LETTER: Water Authority pork and the Raiders</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T05:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 05:00</time> by <a rel="author">Jerry Fink Las Vegas</a></address>
      <p>The Review-Journal reported Wednesday that the board of the Southern Nevada Water Authority postponed a decision as whether or not to enter a 10-year marketing and advertising partnership with the soon-to-be Las Vegas Raiders. This has caused to me to wonder why a monopoly — in particular, a government monopoly — needs to advertise at all? What will potential customers do: dig wells, catch rainfall or sign up with a nonexistent competitor?</p>
      <p>This is pork, pure and simple. Being sensible and frugal with public expenditures must be an oxymoron with those who spend our money like its water.</p>
