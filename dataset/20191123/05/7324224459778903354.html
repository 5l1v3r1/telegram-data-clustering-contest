      <h1>Walsall boss Darrell Clarke: Liam Roberts has the tools to be a top goalkeeper</h1>
      <h2>Saddlers manager Darrell Clarke has heaped praise on goalkeeper Liam Roberts, backing him to become a 'top goalkeeper' for the club.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T05:50:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 05:50</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.expressandstar.com/news/authors/liam-keen/" target="_blank">Liam Keen</a></address>
      <p>The 24-year-old, who came through the youth ranks at the Banks's Stadium, signed a 'long-term' contract extension with Walsall this week.</p>
      <p>He started the season as the number one, but was pushed out of the team by Jack Rose in October.</p>
      <p>Now, after returning to the team and picking up two clean sheets in three games, Clarke has backed his shot stopper to continue his development at the club.</p>
      <p>"Liam Roberts has all the tools to be a top, top goalkeeper," he said.</p>
      <p>"We're looking for that consistency in his game.</p>
      <p>"I gave him a bit of a rest and a re-charge for a few games, because I think he needed that.</p>
      <p>"Sometimes players need that.</p>
      <p>"But he's responded fantastic, he's a great lad to work with.</p>
      <p>"There's a lot of managers up and down the country that would like Liam Roberts in their goal.</p>
      <p>"When a player like Liam has been at a club for so long, what you find is a lot of people just want to jump on the negatives.</p>
      <p>"Not the positives of what he actually brings.</p>
      <p>"There's managers that come into my office after their game and say 'I like your 'keeper.'</p>
      <p>"There's loads that have been saying that.</p>
      <p>"Sometimes you have to appreciate what we've got.</p>
      <p>"He wanted to commit his future to us and I think he's a very good asset for ourselves."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Clarke admitted his side had turned a 'little bit of a corner' with recent results.</p>
      <p>After six league losses in a row, and a painful 2-2 home draw with non-league Darlington in the FA Cup, Walsall have picked up some form.</p>
      <p>A 6-0 thrashing of Forest Green Rovers was followed up with a 2-1 league win over Cambridge.</p>
      <p>The Saddlers made it three on the spin against Darlington in the FA Cup replay, with a narrow 1-0 win, and Clarke says the mood in the camp has improved.</p>
      <p>"There's no better place to be than a training ground environment when you're winning football games," he added.</p>
      <p>"Also when you're not on runs, there's a siege mentality.</p>
      <p>"Obviously the boys gain a bit of confidence when they're on good runs but we had four wins on the spin in September and then all of a sudden we had the disastrousÂ October.</p>
      <p>"Some of the performances warranted more points but then you have to manage a different scenario where confidence is low.</p>
      <p>"We've managed to turn a little bit of a corner with the last three wins."</p>
