      <p>Ajit Pawar of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), took oath as the Deputy Chief Minister of Maharashtra.</p>
      <p>Earlier, Fadnavis had changed his Twitter bio to ‘<a href="https://www.india.com/news/india/soon-after-resignation-fadnavis-changes-twitter-bio-becomes-caretaker-cm-3835991/">Caretaker Chief Minister of Maharashtra</a>‘ on November 8 after submitting his resignation to Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari. On November 13, he had changed his profile to ‘<a href="https://www.india.com/news/from-caretaker-to-sevak-the-curious-case-of-devendra-fadnavis-twitter-handle-3841169/">Maharashtra’s Sevak</a>‘ (Servant) after <a href="https://www.india.com/news/india/hectic-politicking-continues-even-after-imposition-of-presidents-rule-in-maharashtra-top-developments-3840947/">President’ Rule was imposed</a> in the state on November 12.</p>

      <p>Earlier, speaking to news agency ANI after taking oath, he said, ” People had given us a clear mandate, but Shiv Sena tried to ally with other parties after results, as a result, President’s rule was imposed. Maharashtra needed a stable govt, not a ‘khichdi’ government.”</p>

      <p>“I would like to express my gratitude to NCP’s Ajit Pawar ji, he took this decision to give a stable government to Maharashtra &amp; come together with BJP. Some other leaders also came with us and we staked claim to form the government,” he added</p>

      <p>BJP-Shiv Sena had achieved a clear majority in the October 24 Assembly Election; however, <a href="https://www.india.com/news/india/unethical-ways-sena-accuses-bjp-of-horse-trading-claims-mahashiv-aghadi-giving-stomach-ache-to-fadnavis-3845400/">Sena walked out</a> of the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) after the saffron party snubbed its demand of sharing the Chief Minister’s post of 2.5 years each.</p>
      <p>Fadnavis became Chief Minister for the first time after the two parties, which contested the 2014 state polls independently, joined hands later to form a coalition government in the state.</p>
