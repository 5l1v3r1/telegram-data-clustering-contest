      <h1>The one forward-thinking constant through all of Swansea City's troubles that is paying off big style</h1>

      <p>Wales are once again off to a major championship and Swansea City has certainly played its part in the national team’s success.</p>
      <p>Four of the starting XI against Hungary in mid-week had come through the <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/swansea-city-fc">Swansea</a> youth system.</p>
      <p>Connor Roberts may not be getting regular starts for the Swans at the moment but his place in Ryan Giggs’s side is by now ironclad and he was once again a dynamic figure on the right side of defence on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>On the other wing, academy product Ben Davies was as composed, disciplined and authoritative as ever. He’s only 26 years old but his experience and maturity is clear for all to see. Big-game pressure doesn’t faze him in any way.</p>
      <p>Davies’s defensive solidity gave Daniel James the freedom to rampage down his wing, with his pace and direct running causing all sorts of problems for the Hungarians.</p>
      <p>In the centre of the pitch, controlling everything was Joe Allen. His club side Stoke may be struggling at the wrong end of the Championship but the Narberth native still looks a class act when he lines up for Wales and once again he put in an all-action display which begged the question, why on earth is he wasting his time outside the top flight?</p>
      <p>All four have played a big part in this qualification campaign and will be licking their lips at the prospect of playing in this summer’s tournament.</p>
      <p>He wasn’t available for this week’s matches but Joe Rodon too will be bursting with excitement after qualification was secured. His introduction to the side midway through the campaign helped solidify a ropey back four and when he returns from his injury the Llangyfelach-born centre-back will be confident of nailing down a spot in the Euro 2020 squad.</p>
      <p>This isn’t the first time Swansea stars have played a big part in national team success over recent years. Chris Coleman’s Euro 2016 squad contained six players who either played for the Swans at the time or had come through the club’s academy.</p>

      <p>Swansea players, past or present, have been a consistent presence in the national squad for a number of years, many of them becoming key regulars in the first team.</p>
      <p>As one of only a tiny handful of fully professional clubs in Wales, based in the country’s second largest city, this should arguably be the norm. It’s only right that Welsh professional clubs are expected to supply the national side with a steady stream of players.</p>
      <p>But it’s not always been the case. When I started supporting the club in the late 90s, the only Wales regulars who had played for the club were Andy Melville and Coleman, but Melville had left the Vetch in 1990 and Coleman followed suit in 1991.</p>
      <p>When Roger Freestone gained his one and only cap in a friendly against a star-studded Brazil side in 2000, the Jack Army lost its mind, such was the justified excitement of the occasion. This was the first time since 1996 a current Swansea player had represented Wales.</p>
      <p>It wouldn’t happen again until 2005 when Sam Ricketts made the first of his 52 appearances in the red shirt against Hungary.</p>
      <p>Ricketts’s selection seemed to change the record and over the coming years the likes of Owain Tudur Jones and Ashley Williams became regulars in the squad while playing for Swansea and in 2009 Allen became the first graduate of the Swansea youth system to make his Welsh international debut while contracted to the club since Christian Edwards a whole 13 years earlier.</p>

        <figcaption>Oli McBurnie and Daniel James came through at Fairwood</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Suddenly a club which had contributed precious little to the national side for many years began supplying it with new players on a regular basis.</p>
      <p>This productivity looks set to continue because Swansea’s youth sides are also very well represented at various age grades over the international break.</p>
      <p>Four of the starting XI for Wales’s under-21 side in the 1-0 win over Bosnia and Herzegovina this week, including goal-scorer Liam Cullen, are contracted to the Swans while full-back Aaron Lewis who now plays for Lincoln City also came through the Swansea academy.</p>
      <p>While in the Premier League the club invested heavily in the academy and despite the difficult financial adjustment to life outside the top flight, youth development has remained a top priority. It’s easy to see why. Not only have the Swans’ youth sides supplied the first team with numerous top-quality players, it’s also pocketed the club some considerable sums including more than £30million for the combined sales of James and Oli McBurnie this summer.</p>
      <p>The club’s been rewarded for its commitment to nurturing youngsters but it’s not the only beneficiary. Swansea’s gain is also Wales’s gain as exciting Welsh talent progresses to the international stage.</p>
      <p>Wales are enjoying a golden era and with so many talented youngsters in the squad it has the potential to continue long beyond this summer’s tournament. With the continued success of Swansea’s youth structure, hopefully club and country can thrive in tandem.</p>
