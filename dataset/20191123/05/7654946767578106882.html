      <h1>Anti-cop protesters flood Harlem streets in wake of subway crackdown</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T05:10:18+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 05:10</time> by <a rel="author">Ben Cohn and Ben Feuerherd</a></address>
      <p>Police arrested at least 58 anti-cop demonstrators who flooded the streets of Upper Manhattan to protest a fare-evasion crackdown and police in the subways Friday night.</p>
      <p>The crowd swelled to about two hundred people soon after the protest kicked off at about 5:30 p.m. in Harlem. The demonstration was called to protest Governor Cuomo’s <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/20/push-to-add-more-mta-cops-likely-to-balloon-agencys-ot-spending/">plan to add 500 police officers to patrol the subway</a> and several high-profile, caught-on-video arrests in the subway system in recent weeks, organizers said.</p>
      <p>As the group headed east on 125th Street near Malcolm X Boulevard, marchers chanted “f—k the police” and “fare free NYC.”</p>
      <p>The crowd, some carrying signs that read “NYPD Out Of The Subway,” then marched north toward The Bronx, shutting down traffic on the Third Avenue Bridge by taking over the roadway.</p>

      <p>Those arrested face charges of disorderly conduct and obstruction of governmental administration.</p>
      <p>The protest, billed as an “FTP Emergency Action” an abbreviation for “F— The Police,” was advertised on Twitter by a consortium of anti-cop groups calling itself “DecolonizeThisPlace.”</p>

      <p>“I was there in Brooklyn,” protester Stephanie Meyer said during the march, <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/01/anti-cop-protesters-in-brooklyn-blast-fare-evasion-crackdown/">referring to a similar protest in Brooklyn on Nov. 1</a>. ” We have to hold the NYPD and MTA accountable,” she added.</p>
      <p>“F—k cops and every racist fascist person out here. These are our neighborhoods,” Alicia, 22, of the Bronx, added.</p>
      <p>In the most recent high-profile arrest in the subway system, a number of Brooklyn cops <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/09/arrest-of-brooklyn-churro-vendor-sparks-outrage-on-twitter/">briefly cuffed a woman selling churros</a> in the Broadway Junction station on Nov. 9.</p>
      <p>The cops eventually gave the woman a summons and released her.</p>
