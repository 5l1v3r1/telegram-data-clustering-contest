      <p>Amazon has the Galaxy Watch Active 2 <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/best-cell-phone-deals">on sale</a> right now, ahead of Black Friday. It's just $229. That's $50 off of its regular price, and makes this a really great time to pick one up.</p>
      <p>The Galaxy Watch Active 2 is a really great smartwatch to pick up, especially for those that are more interested in fitness tracking. As the Galaxy Watch Active 2 is a fitness tracker first and a smartwatch second.</p>
      <p>The big feature of the Galaxy Watch Active 2 is definitely the fact that it works with Samsung Health. Allowing you to track your workouts, as well as steps taken, calories burned, and even your swimming activity. With Samsung Health, you're going to be able to compete with your friends to see who can get the most steps. Which is always a good way to get people walking more, and thus losing weight.</p>

      <p>On the smartwatch side, you can still get all of your notifications on your wrist. This is going to make it easier to stay in the know with what's going on. As you'll be able to get email notifications, text messages and so much more on your wrist. Thanks to Bixby being included, you'll be able to dictate replies to text messages, without having to pull out your phone. That is definitely a really cool feature.</p>
      <p>Perhaps the best part of the Galaxy Watch Active 2 is the battery. It can last you three to four days, and if you really push it, you can get five days out of this one. That's much better than most smartwatches. Not having to recharge your smartwatch every night is definitely a really great thing. Especially since this offers sleep tracking.</p>
      <p>You can pick up the Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 2 in this sale from Amazon <a href="https://geni.us/jsYS">by clicking here.</a> But you'd better hurry, as this won't be on sale for long.</p>
