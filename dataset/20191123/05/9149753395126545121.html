This machine keeps pace with some of the <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/best-gaming-laptop/">best gaming laptops</a> available and is as powerful as it is slim. Featuring hardware that would make some desktops blush, the GS65 packs an RTX 2060 and a Core i7-9750H into its slim frame. Pair these specs with a 512GB SSD and 32GB of DDR4 memory, and the GS65 is just about ideal for testing the limits of its 240Hz 1080p display.</p>
      <p>Weighing in at just over 4 Lbs and less than an inch thick, this 15-inch laptop is the epitome of portable power. The 8-hour battery life also means you aren't obligated to tote around a power adapter if you're gaming on the go, and the matte black frame with gold highlights, means this is a gaming laptop you won't mind showing off to your friends. The GS65 still has plenty of teeth though, providing excellent 1080p gaming performance backed up by a Steelseries branded per-key RGB keyboard. </p>
