      <p><a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/wwe-survivor-series">Survivor Series</a> is almost upon us, and boy, what an exciting show it's going to be! For the first time ever, Superstars from RAW, SmackDown and NXT will collide in the battle for brand supremacy.</p>
      <p>Three of WWE's biggest prizes will also be on the line, as Brock Lesnar will defend his <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/WWE">WWE</a> Championship against Rey Mysterio, The Fiend will defend his Universal Title against Daniel Bryan and Adam Cole will defend his NXT Championship against the winner of the triple threat match at NXT TakeOver: WarGames.</p>
      <p>This year's Survivor Series could turn out to be the best PPV of the year, as a lot of interesting matches are scheduled to take place at the event. However, WWE is notorious for their odd booking decisions that leave fans disappointed.</p>
      <p>In order for Survivor Series to be an interesting and memorable show, here are five big mistakes WWE must avoid making at the PPV.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h4>#5 Brock Lesnar vs Rey Mysterio headlining the show</h4>

      <p>This Sunday, <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/rey-mysterio">Rey Mysterio</a> and Brock Lesnar's feud could come to an end after their clash for the WWE Championship in a No Holds Barred match. The feud initially started when Lesnar attacked Mysterio and his son Dominik on the season premiere of RAW.</p>
      <p>The Beast successfully defended his title against Cain Velasquez at Crown Jewel, and if he loses to Mysterio, it will be very shocking. This will be a short match, as we have seen with Brock Lesnar's previous matches.</p>
      <p>Survivor Series is all about brand supremacy, so it'll make sense for a RAW vs SmackDown vs NXT match to close the show. According to Sportskeeda's own <a href="https://twitter.com/Colohue/status/1194967207140298752">Tom Colohue</a>, the women's triple threat match between Becky Lynch, Bayley and Shayna Baszler could be the main event.</p>
      <p>All three of these women are on the top of their respective brands, so it makes sense for them to close the show. Also, they are capable of putting on a decent match. Brock vs Rey, on the other hand, will be a squash match, so it's not the best option to headline Survivor Series.</p>
