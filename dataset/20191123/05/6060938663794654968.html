      <h1>‘Pati Patni Aur Woh’: Producers of the Kartik Aaryan, Anaya Panday starrer confirm dropping controversial line on marital rape</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T05:00:51+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 05:00</time> by <a rel="author">TIMESOFINDIA.COM</a></address>
      <p>Weeks before the release of ‘Pati Patni Aur Woh’, starring <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Kartik-Aaryan">Kartik Aaryan</a>, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Bhumi-Pednekar">Bhumi Pednekar</a> and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Ananya-Panday">Ananya Panday</a>, the makers have confirmed that they have edited out a controversial dialogue – an insensitive joke on <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/marital-rape">marital rape</a>, from the film.</p>
      <p>According to reports doing the rounds, Juno Chopra confirmed that he had gone ahead and removed the dialogue that hurt people’s sentiments. The dialogue did not go down too well with many who took to social media to slam the makers and the actors for “trivializing marital rape.”</p>
      <p>In an interview with <i/>Mumbai Mirror, producer Juno Chopra said, "Both my grandfather (BR Chopra) and my dad (<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Ravi-Chopra">Ravi Chopra</a>) made socially relevant films and while I haven’t made one yet, I believe in doing the right thing. Respecting people’s sentiments, we’ve edited out the lines.”</p>
      <p>In a scene from the trailer, Kartik complains to his friend that men are called rapists if they force their wives into having sex. “Biwi se sex maang lein toh hum bikhaari. Biwi ko sex na de toh hum atyachaari. Aur kisi tarah jugaad laga ke usse sex haasil kar lena toh balaatkari bhi hum hai.”</p>
      <p>Following the backlash, Bhumi Pednekar in an interview apologised saying that the team is sorry if they have hurt anybody’s sentiments and also explained that it wasn’t their intention.</p>
      <p>“If we have hurt anybody’s sentiments, we are sorry, because that wasn’t the intention. But everybody who is involved in '<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Pati-Patni-Aur-Woh">Pati Patni Aur Woh</a>', does not belong to that school, does not belong to that thought process,” she said.</p>
      <p>‘Pati Patni Aur Woh’ is slated to release on 6 December 2019.</p>
