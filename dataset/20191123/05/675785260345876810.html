      <p>Biebs shared a split photo on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> of the pair at the their second wedding ceremony on September 30.</p>
      <p>In one of the images, the pair are locked lips in a passionate kiss, while Hailey wears her spectacular wedding gown and Justin dons his white tux.</p>

      <p>"It’s also been really nice enjoying this next phase of their relationship and lives together. They have started settling into what it really feels like to be together as a married couple.</p>
      <p>"All the distractions of wedding planning, the early phases of dating, moving in together etc. have all been accomplished and it’s a more regular, day-to-day routine now which has been really nice."</p>
