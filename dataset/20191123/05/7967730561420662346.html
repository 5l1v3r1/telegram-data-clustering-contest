      <h1>Wage theft inquiry 'must probe union deals', retail workers warn</h1>

      <p>Retail and fast food workers are preparing a dossier detailing more than $1 billion worth of wages and entitlements traded away by the "shoppies" union, but fear a Senate inquiry into wage theft will gloss over the "cosy" employer deals.</p>
      <p>Terms of reference for the inquiry established last week say it will probe the "causes, extent and effects of unlawful non-payment or underpayment of employees’ remuneration by employers" and "measures that can be taken" to fix it.</p>

      <p>Retail and Fast Food Workers Union secretary Josh Cullinan said the use of the word "unlawful" appeared to exclude any examination of the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees' Association – known for <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/interactive/2016/shopped-out/">signing up workers to enterprise agreements that left them on as little as $8 an hour.</a></p>
      <p>"The largest wage theft that's ever occurred in Australia is the wage theft that's been committed by the SDA," Mr Cullinan, who formed the RFFWU as an alternative representative body, told the <i>Sydney Morning Herald</i> and <i>The Age</i>.</p>
      <p>While the terms of reference also include "any related matters", Mr Cullinan fears the Labor-led inquiry will be swayed by the SDA's powerful influence in the party.</p>
      <p>He appealed to senators on the Senate's economics committee to consider "all relevant material", including details of the SDA's substandard wage deals – some of which were continuing.</p>
      <p>Bernie Smith, NSW Secretary of the SDA, said the union welcomed the Senate inquiry and rejected "any suggestion that SDA-negotiated agreements have ever left workers worse off".</p>
      <p>"The SDA represents the highest paid retail workers in the world due to a long history of effectively, diligently and consistently working in the best interests of retail and warehouse workers," he said.</p>
      <p>An award-winning investigation by <i>The Age</i> revealed in 2016 that <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-gr4f68.html">a quarter of a million retail and fast-food workers were underpaid more than $300 million a year over five years</a> by employers including Woolworths, Hungry Jack's and KFC, on <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-gr4f68.html">enterprise agreements negotiated by the SDA.</a></p>
      <p>On the same day that Labor established the wage theft inquiry, its senators moved a motion to acknowledge the SDA for "representing its members in retail and fast food" and blocked a Greens amendment to also recognise the RFFWU.</p>
      <p>The SDA donated more than $1.6 million to the Labor Party over the past four financial years, according to disclosures lodged with the Australian Electoral Commission.</p>

      <p>Labor senator Alex Gallacher, who chairs the Senate committee behind the inquiry, said there was "no intention to rule anybody in or out" and that any submission that "makes sense" would be included, with its authors to be called as witnesses and their evidence tested.</p>
      <p>"The SDA won't have any sway over me," Senator Gallacher said.</p>
      <p>While technically legal, the exposure of the unfavourable SDA deals led to retailers having to renegotiate enterprise agreements, lifting wages by as much as 20 per cent or $150 a week.</p>
      <p>Under one such deal, Coles was found by the Fair Work Commission to have "significantly" underpaid 77,000 workers, including tens of thousands paid penalty rates lower than the workplace award – the basic wages safety net.</p>
      <p>Mr Cullinan said wages stripped away through the SDA's willingness to sign off on deals that left workers worse off far exceeded the <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p536lk.html">$500 million worth of underpayments disclosed by employers in recent months.</a></p>
