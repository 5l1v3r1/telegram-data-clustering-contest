      <p>The Oluwo of Iwo, Abdulrasheed Akanbi, has said that the administration of Osun State Governor, Gboyega Oyetola, would achieve the needed turnaround before the end of his first term in office.</p>
      <p>Speaking at the just concluded Osun State Economic Summit held in Osogbo, the state capital, Oluwo acknowledged the steps so far taken by Governor Oyetola describing them as appropriate step aimed at an improved economy.</p>
      <p>He reiterated that what the governor has done since he assumed office last year is a pointer to his understanding of economic need of the state.</p>
      <p>The traditional ruler, therefore, charged the indigenes and resident of the state to prepare for better days and also set to contribute their quotas in ensuring that government economic policies achieve desired results.</p>
      <p>He assured that the state is in safe hands, urging everyone,  most especially farmers to organize themselves to match the industrial template of the governor.</p>
      <p>Oba Akanbi admitted the opportunities and profits in farming but said industrialization is more profitable and  less land-consuming than  farming.</p>
      <p>Oluwo noted his vision is synonymous with the template of Oyetola, advising land owners to see lease as alternative to outright selling, adding that leasing is secured, futuristic and preferable to the advantage of the owners.</p>
      <p>“Although Osun is an agrarian state, agriculture is not the best for rapid growth. We need industries that with provide jobs and revenues for the state. I can see Oyetola preparing, we should prepare for better Osun under him.</p>

      <p>“Farming takes more land than mining. We need more industries in Osun. Osun will no more be farming land but an industrial hub of the nation. That is my dream for Osun,” he said.</p>
      <p>The Oluwo disclosed that his one-month trip to Canada was part of his efforts to actively complement the vision of Governor Oyetola whom he described as a silent achiever blessed with unassuming personage.</p>
      <p>He explained that by the time the results of his mission to the North America begin to manifest, it would be clear that the era of traditional rulers sitting in the palaces and expecting development to fall on their laps is gone forever.</p>
      <p>“My pact with the people of Iwoland is to drive the town to higher pedestal. This comes with sacrifice in form of misinterpretation of intention but I am ready because my life is all about making sacrifice,” he said.</p>
