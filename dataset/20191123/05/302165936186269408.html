      <h1>After Tanjung Piai, Rais Hussin says Pakatan can no longer treat GE14 manifesto as optional</h1>

      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, NOV 23 — Pakatan Harapan’s devastating loss in Tanjung Piai demonstrates that it cannot expect to ignore its election manifesto without being punished, said Bersatu strategist Rais Hussin.</p>
      <p>He said the ruling coalition must treat its so-called “Buku Harapan” as though it were a holy book, with failure to do so likely to lead to defeat in the next general election.</p>
      <p>Rais insisted the coalition’s humbling loss in last week’s by-election was “absolutely” due to protest votes against it.</p>
      <p>“Please don’t conclude that this is MCA, BN or Muafakat Nasional victory, many people did not know what the hell is Muafakat Nasional.</p>
      <p>“I hope after this the manifesto becomes the Quran. Why become the Quran? That is what we need to deliver,” he said during the Post Tanjung Piai by-election discussion organised by Cent-GPS and ZCG at the Putra World Trade Centre last night.</p>
      <p>Although not one of the panellists, he was invited to provide comments from the PH perspective at the end of the session.</p>
      <p>Rais also said Emir Research will publish its findings on current public sentiments on November 28.</p>
      <p>He declined to divulge details but hinted that the conclusions pointed to an urgent need to address the livelihoods of Malaysians.</p>
      <p>This meant paying urgent attention to portions of the manifesto concerning issues such as rising costs, affordable housing, jobs creation, and the likes.</p>
      <p>“We have to deliver the manifesto starting with the economy.</p>
      <p>“Because if you deliver the economy, then race-religion politics becomes insignificant.</p>
      <p>“Today we have a global phenomenon of the right wing. I pray to God that that thing doesn’t come to Malaysia,” he said.</p>
