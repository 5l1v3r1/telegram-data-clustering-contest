      <p>Goalpara: A high-level committee of judiciary and police department, recently formed by the Assam government, has visited on Thursday and Friday the Goalpara detention camp inside the district jail. The constituted Special Review Committee (SRC) took stock of the conditions prevailing inside the Goalpara detention centre where 202 declared foreigners are lodged. The SRC is headed by Deputy Inspector General (Border) Debojyoti Mukherjee and its other members are Inspector General of Prisons Barnali Sharma and retired district and session Judge Hardeep Singh and a representative nominated by the deputy commissioners concerned of the six districts where the detention centres are set.</p>
      <p>The committee has already visited Tezpur and Kokrajhar and is scheduled to visit the other three detention centres of Silchar, Dibrugarh, Jorhat and review the legal aid and health status of each detainee. It will also provide recommendation for improvement, if needed, and review the quality of food, hygiene and living conditions in the detention centres. The committee will also check the education system for the children staying in the centres and provide suggestions for improvements. The SRC will conduct the review urgently and submit its consolidated report within three months. Significantly, on two occasions, the family members of the detainees refused to receive the dead bodies of their relatives who had died inside the detention camps creating a nationwide attention.</p>
