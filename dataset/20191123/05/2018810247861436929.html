      <p>The weekend is for rock climbing, and going on a long run, and being a generally very sporty dude. It’s also for playing video games while nursing all the aches and pains getting into fitness at 37 is giving me.</p>
      <p>I’m totally charmed by this weekend’s <i>Fortnite</i> <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/fishingfrenzy">fishing competition</a>, even though my efforts to participate so far have just been other players sneaking up behind me and shotgunning me while I fish. It’s also getting to be the end of the year, which means I should probably finish <i>Control</i>, and <i>Outer Worlds</i>, and <i>Outer Wilds</i>, and <i>Baba Is You</i>, and the million other excellent games I’ve left half-completed.</p>
      <p>What about you? What are you playing?</p>
