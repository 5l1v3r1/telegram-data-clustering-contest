      <h1>A Hollywood film on Michael Jackson reported in the works</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T05:26:48+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 05:26</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/77/reuters/" target="_blank">Reuters</a></address>
      <p><i>Deadline, Variety</i> and the <i>Hollywood Reporter</i> said producer Graham King had secured the rights, including music, from Jackson’s estate to make a feature film about the life of the <i>Thriller</i> singer, whose legacy has been tarnished by allegations of child sex abuse.</p>
      <p>The movie is expected to span Jackson’s journey from child star to global icon that ended when he died in 2009 at age 50 of an overdose from a powerful sleeping aid just weeks before a planned comeback concert.</p>
      <p><i>Deadline</i>, citing unnamed sources, said the film “isn’t intended to be a sanitized rendering” of Jackson’s life. King’s production company and the Jackson estate did not immediately return calls for comment. Jackson was tried and acquitted in 2005 on charges of molesting a 13-year-old boy. In 1994, he settled a sexual abuse civil lawsuit concerning another 13 year-old boy.</p>
      <p>His reputation came under scrutiny again this year because of the Emmy-winning documentary <i>Leaving Neverland</i> in which two men gave emotional accounts of what they said was sexual abuse by the singer in the 1990s when they were boys.</p>

      <p>Jackson’s family attacked the documentary and his estate denounced it as a “rehash of dated and discredited allegations.”</p>
      <p>Despite the publicity, the Jackson estate is backing a new Broadway musical about the singer, due to open in July 2020. A Michael Jackson show <i>One</i> from Cirque du Soleil continues to play in Las Vegas, and stage musical <i>Thriller Live</i> has been playing in London since 2009.</p>
      <p><i>Bohemian Rhapsody</i>, a musical biopic about Queen front man Freddie Mercury who died of AIDS in 1991, won four Oscars this year, including for lead actor Rami Malek. It has taken more than $900 million at the global box office.</p>
      <p><i>Deadline</i> said the script for the Jackson movie will be written by John Logan, whose credits include <i>The Aviator</i>. No casting, expected release date or movie studio was announced.</p>
