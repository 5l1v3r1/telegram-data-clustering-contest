        <figcaption>Mr Corbyn's move risks alienating both sides of a deeply divided Labour Party, the Times adds. The Conservatives will use the Labour leader's stance to seek to win a swathe of Leave-voting constituencies, the paper says.</figcaption>

        <figcaption>As part of a summary of the key news lines from the BBC debate on Friday night, the Guardian says Mr Corbyn revealed his "neutral stance" after mounting pressure to pick a side - while Boris Johnson was challenged over his trustworthiness and accused of "fomenting racism".</figcaption>

        <figcaption>Meanwhile, family doctors have voted to scrap home visits at a British Medical Association meeting, the Daily Mail reports. It says GPs backing the move said travelling to and from patients' homes was too time-consuming - while critics said the "heart and soul" of the profession was at risk.</figcaption>

        <b>Most of the papers reflect on last night's special election edition of BBC Question Time.</b>
      </p>
      <p>And if you're looking for a winner, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/11/22/question-time-audience-gave-three-leaders-roasting-one-emerged/">the Telegraph declares</a> it was the punters in the studio.</p>
      <p><a href="https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/general-election-2019-bbc-question-time-analysis-1320458">The i says</a> the scrutiny to which the four party leaders were subjected was a breath of fresh air in this campaign, and it helped that the audience were switched on, and in some cases, pretty angry.</p>
      <p>Quentin Letts in the Times says it was a political version of the X Factor, although he acknowledges that BBC ratings managers must have been beating their heads in despair that the SNP's Nicola Sturgeon was second up in the two-hour show.</p>
      <p>The tempo dropped like a shot partridge, he says.</p>

      <p>A week on from the Duke of York's much-criticised television interview, the headlines surrounding Prince Andrew have not improved.</p>
      <p>The i newspaper labels him the <a href="https://inews.co.uk/news/uk/prince-andrew-duke-of-york-entrepreneur-role-pitch-palace-jeffrey-epstein-scandal-1320468">"Duke of nothing"</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/royal/1208203/Prince-Andrew-latest-BBC-interview-royal-news">The Daily Express claims</a> the last vestiges of his life as a working member of the Royal Family were collapsing around him after he reportedly parted company with his flagship business project, Pitch@Palace, because of the controversy surrounding his links to the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
      <p>Several papers carry pictures of the prince out horse-riding with the Queen in the grounds of Windsor Castle - a scene interpreted by the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7714587/Queen-Prince-Andrew-ride-solidarity-Majesty-sacked-him.html">Daily Mail</a> and the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/shamed-prince-andrew-forced-move-20940077">Mirror</a> as a defiant show of support by the monarch.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-7714657/NHS-doctors-vote-scrap-home-visits-modern-GPs-dont-time.html">"End of GP home visit"</a> is the Daily Mail's front-page headline after family doctors voted to scrap what has been a cornerstone of general practice for decades.</p>
      <p>They argue that going to see patients is too time-consuming.</p>
      <p>The paper says doctors will now lobby the NHS to abandon their contractual obligation to carry out home visits, leaving paramedics or other health professionals to do them instead.</p>

      <p>Finally, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/11/22/dog-years-myth-puppies-middle-aged-time-two-new-study-suggests/">the Times says</a> experts have debunked the idea that one dog year is equivalent to seven for a human.</p>
      <p>Instead, research suggests that Labradors, for example, hurtle into middle age before they reach their third birthday, but that a dog's rate of ageing slows over time.</p>
