      <p>An unbeaten century from BJ Watling helped push New Zealand into a lead in the first Test against England in Mount Maunganui on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Watling (119 not out) was the star at Bay Oval, making his eighth Test century as the Black Caps reached 394-6 in their first innings.</p>
      <p>England were lacklustre on day three – Watling was dropped by Ben Stokes on 31 – and were left trailing by 41 runs heading into Sunday.</p>
      <p>They took just two wickets, but only after handy contributions from Henry Nicholls (41) and Colin de Grandhomme (65) for New Zealand.</p>

      <p>The Black Caps had resumed at 144-4 in response to England's 353 and the hosts survived a couple of early scares.</p>
      <p>England wasted a review on an lbw shout against Nicholls, who was on 30, before the left-hander needed one of his own after being given out on 39.</p>
      <p>The big chance fell to Stokes off Joe Root (1-31), but the star all-rounder dropped Watling, then on 31, in what would prove a costly mistake.</p>
      <p>Just two balls later and Root got Nicholls lbw, but De Grandhomme entered and contributed strongly alongside Watling.</p>
      <p>De Grandhomme was dropped on 62 by Rory Burns, who also hurt his hand in the process, on his way to a 119-run partnership with Watling.</p>
      <p>Stokes struck with the first ball after tea thanks to a brilliant low catch by debutant Dom Sibley to remove De Grandhomme.</p>

      <p>Watling reached his century and was later given lbw to Jofra Archer (0-84), but a review showed an edge and he survived.</p>
      <p>That capped a frustrating day for England, with Mitchell Santner (31) unbeaten alongside Watling at stumps.</p>
