      <h1>After successive bombs, is the reboot era finally over?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T05:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 05:00</time> by <a rel="author">Robert Moran</a></address>
      <p>It's not often that a film's director publicly acknowledges their own box office bomb, especially while the film is still opening in cinemas, but Elizabeth Banks made a brave exception this week after her <i>Charlie's Angels</i> reboot humiliatingly crashed.</p>
      <p>"Well, if you're going to have a flop, make sure your name is on it at least 4x," the writer-director-producer-star tweeted to her 2.3 million followers. "I'm proud of <i>Charlie's Angels</i> and happy it's in the world."</p>

      <p>The film, made for an estimated $US75 million ($110 million), has claimed back under half of that since opening last week, including a dismal $US8 million ($12 million) opening weekend in the States. In Australia, the film was outpaced at the box office by <i>Ford v Ferrari</i>, a movie that's like <i>Cars 3</i> but for grandpas.</p>
      <p>Online discussions have furiously debated the possible reasons for the film's collapse. There's the lack of star power outside an oddly cast Kristen Stewart; Banks' awkward press tour in <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/stephenlaconte/elizabeth-banks-charlies-angels-sexism-debate-controversy">which she denigrated the pioneering female box office power</a> of DC's <i>Wonder Woman</i> and Marvel's <i>Captain Marvel</i>; and that the internet's usual misogynists have laid the blame at women doing women things on-screen and why can't all movies just be tough man-robots punching other tough man-robots before the man-robots hug each other, toughly?</p>

      <p>I don't know what the reason for the movie's bombing is, I'm not (arms waving, beep-boop) Dr SWOT Analysis Forecast at Columbia Pictures's Finance Division (beep-boop). But that doesn't mean I won't pretend I know what the reason is: it's reboots – they're officially dead.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, <i>Terminator: Dark Fate</i> – the sixth instalment in the franchise – similarly crashed at the box office despite almost three years of hype touting creator James Cameron's involvement in the reboot. According to <i>Variety</i>, Paramount and other studios backing the $US235 million ($346 million)-budgeted flick <a href="https://variety.com/2019/film/box-office/terminator-dark-fate-box-office-flop-1203391309/">stand to lose over $US100 million ($147 million) following its underwhelming release.</a> Really, that's what you deserve for not giving Edward Furlong a job.</p>

      <p>Personally, I think this is a promising development. If, as <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/charlies-angels-bombs-at-box-office-reasons-why-1202787938/"><i>Deadline</i> emphatically put it</a>, this is "primed to further spur a WTF reaction and anxiety among film development executives in town in regards to what the hell exactly works in this have-and-have not era of the theatrical marketplace", that's a good thing. God forbid, anxious "film development executives"! If your job load to date has entailed things such as, say, casually <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5637536/">signing off on <i>Avatar 5</i> for 2027</a>, maybe you could use some workplace anxiety.</p>
      <p>Of course, to borrow a line from my ninth-grade biology class, we need a bigger poop sample. Two reboot bombs in a row is delightfully hilarious, not to mention the images it conjures of film executives sweating in bed screaming, "Original idea!", but it's not enough. A quick glance at the coming release schedule still sees an abundance of recycled titles on their way, from <i>The Addams Family</i> to <i>Cats</i> to <i>Bad Boys for Life</i> and <i>Mulan</i>.</p>
      <p>Like any sane human, I'm keen to see Will Smith and Martin Lawrence wisecrack at each other's expense again, and recite the lyrics to an Inner Circle hit like it's 1993. But I'll abstain because there are bigger stakes at play. The reboot's reeling; a few more multimillion-dollar fiascos and Hollywood will finally be forced to try something different. Like 3D – they'll pick 3D again.</p>
