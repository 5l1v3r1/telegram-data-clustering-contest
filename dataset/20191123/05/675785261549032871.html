      <h1>New Zealand take control of the first Test as England wilt in the heat and take just TWO wickets all day</h1>
      <h2>Kiwi stumper BJ Watling takes England for the most patient of hundreds to leave bowlers frustrated</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T05:22:04+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 05:22</time> by <a rel="author">Dean Wilson, https://www.facebook.com/DeanWilsonCricketMirror/</a></address>
      <p>England were showed exactly what real patience looks like after spending a day in the dirt watching BJ Watling bat.</p>
      <p>The Kiwi stumper nudged his way steadily towards the honour of being the first Test centurion at the Bay Oval and by the time he walked back to the dressing room at the end of day three New Zealand had a lead of 41 with power to add.</p>
      <p>Just two wickets fell all day to the England bowling attack as they all had the life sucked out of them by the pitch, the heat and Watling's broad bat.</p>
      <p>And worst of all Ben Stokes had the chance to send him back when he had made just 31 and edged Joe Root's off spin at a catchable height to slip.</p>

      <p>For the third time out of his last four chances at slip to a spinner he put it down and it was to cost England heavily.</p>
      <p>At the time England were able to get over the drop pretty quickly when Henry Nicholls was trapped lbw later in the same over for 41.</p>
      <p>But a partnership of 119 between Colin de Grandhomme and Watling to the home side within sight of England's total before Mitchell Santner helped push them above and beyond to 394-6 at the close.</p>

      <p>Stokes wasn't the only man to drop a catch either with Rory Burns putting down a sharp, but difficult chance in the gully when de Grandhomme had made 62.</p>
      <p>Burns required some treatment because it split his thumb open and spent the rest of the day off the field.</p>
      <p>It also meant that Dom Sibley deputised in that position and from the first ball after tea de Grandhomme, on 65, tested out the new man and found him more than up to the challenge with a one handed beauty landing safely in his right hand.</p>
      <p>But with both reviews being burnt over two lbw shouts that were turned down and with Jofra Archer getting a wicket taken away from him with a Kiwi review, England didn't have much to celebrate after Sibley's grab.</p>

      <p>Santner was brave in making it to the close 31 not out with Stokes making him hop about and fend the ball just out of reach of two short legs to add to England's disappointment.</p>
      <p>Archer and Root spent plenty of time in conversation during the day too as the speedster went wicketless despite one hostile spell that saw him crank things up to 94.5 mph.</p>
      <p>He needed cajoling at times after some sloppy fielding as Root tried to get the best out of his prized asset, but nothing worked as Watling dug in and batted on and on just how England had hoped to do themselves.</p>
