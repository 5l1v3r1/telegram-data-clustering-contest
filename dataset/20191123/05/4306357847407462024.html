      <h1>‘Time for Emery to leave’: Ex-winger tells Arsenal to sack their manager</h1>
      <h2>Shaun Wright-Phillips has his say on Unai Emery's current situation at Arsenal</h2>

      <h3>Shaun Wright-Phillips believes that it’s time for Arsenal to sack Unai Emery following the Gunners’ stuttering start to the new campaign.</h3>
      <p>The Gunners currently find themselves down in sixth place in the Premier League table after having won just four of their opening 12 games in the top flight this term.</p>
      <p>Arsenal are aiming to break back into the top four and seal Champions League qualification this season, but the Gunners are eight points adrift of fourth-placed Manchester City as things stand.</p>
      <p>The north London side lost 2-0 to Leicester City last time out to leave Emery’s side with just one win from their last five outings in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>Arsenal will attempt to relieve some of the pressure on their manager on Saturday afternoon when they host Southampton at The Emirates.</p>
      <p>However, former Manchester City winger Wright-Phillips believes that Emery’s time should be up at The Emirates.</p>
      <p>Speaking in an interview quoted by <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/shaun-wright-phillips-explains-arsenal-must-sack-unai-emery-11196008/">Metro</a>, Wright-Phillips said: “I think that it’s time for Emery to leave Arsenal, they’ve had a poor start to the season and I think something needs to change.</p>
      <p>“My dad [Arsenal legend Ian Wright] is going to kill me for saying that, but he’s in the jungle so I should be safe!</p>
      <p>“Growing up, Arsenal were always such a big team, they were dominant and would always give you a tough game. They seem to have lost something of that steel and it makes me sad to see, if I’m being honest.</p>
      <p>“As well as the manager, there are deep issues that need to be addressed. Arsenal have been crying out for a defender for years, someone in the Tony Adams, Rio Ferdinand, John Terry, even Ledley King mould who can shore up their defence.</p>
      <p>“Their defensive signings haven’t addressed any of their issues but you wonder anyway if this type of defender would want to join Arsenal at the moment.</p>
      <p>“They’re not close to winning anything and are going to struggle to keep hold of their best players, like Aubameyang who will want Champions League football, let alone sign new quality players.”</p>
      <p>Arsenal are aiming to break back into the top four this season after they finished in fifth place and without a trophy last term.</p>
      <p>Emery was brought in as Arsene Wenger’s replacement in 2018 and he led the Gunners to the Europa League final last season, where they lost to Chelsea FC.</p>
