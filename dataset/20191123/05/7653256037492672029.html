      <p>HYDERABAD: The YS Jaganmohan Reddy government in <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Andhra-Pradesh">Andhra Pradesh</a> has decided to roll back a series of developmental and welfare schemes of the earlier Chandrababu Naidu regime, regardless of widespread criticism of vendetta politics.</p>
      <p>Political analysts said the rollbacks appear to be ill-conceived strategies that target the economic roots of his political opponent: Doing so was not just crippling the economy, development and welfare, but also adversely affecting the state’s investment climate.</p>
      <p>The Andhra Pradesh BJP president Kanna Lakshmi Narayana said the YSR Congress government was crippling the state economy on the pretext of fighting corruption in the previous regime but failed to prove a single irregularity in six months. He cited the decisions to reverse key contracts, such as Polavaram irrigation and <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/renewable-energy">renewable energy</a> PPAs, as example of steps he called regressive. He also alleged job losses at village secretariats of outsourced employees working for years. They were allegedly replaced by by YSR Congress party cadres.</p>
      <p>He also said several construction projects were stalled due to an artificial sand scarcity allegedly created by the Jagan government. Over 30 lakh construction workers lost their livelihood and at least six committed suicides as the civil construction works came to a standstill, he said.</p>
      <p>Opposing the YSR Congress government’s reported plans to shift the capital away from Amaravati, <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Jana-Sena-Party">Jana Sena Party</a> president <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Pawan-Kalyan">Pawan Kalyan</a> vowed to fight on behalf of thousands of farmers who had pooled over 35,000 acres of land for the construction of the capital city at Amaravati. He accused the Jaganmohan Reddy government of “thinking of what to destroy than what to construct.”</p>
      <p>Senior YSR Congress leader and Andhra finance minister Buggana Rajendranath Reddy justified the acts of his government. “Just because one government does a blunder, it is not binding on the successive governments to continue the blunder,” Reddy said.</p>
      <p>Making it clear that the new Andhra government cannot afford to take forward some large projects like the Amaravati Greenfield capital city, the Andhra finance minister said: “Our priority is not to build London or Paris. It is not our priority and not in our capacity also. It is not possible for us to build.”</p>
      <p>Chandrababu Naidu’s TDP accused the ruling YSR Congress of indulging in vendetta politics by reviewing and stalling vital contracts and policies of the earlier dispensation.</p>
      <p>“Lakhs of farmers and the poor in Andhra lost the benefits of welfare schemes introduced by Chandrababu Naidu government as the new Jaganmohan Reddy government has rolled back most of them,” said TDP spokesperson Gurajala Malyadri. “Large irrigation projects and Amaravati Greenfield capital city works were stalled, resulting in unwarranted delays in completion of these works and causing losses to the public.”</p>
      <p>Further, the TDP leader pointed out that successive governments should ensure continuity in developmental and welfare schemes instead of resorting to politics of discontinuity and rollbacks. He cited the example of Chandrababu Naidu completing 23 irrigation projects in last term that were conceived by Jaganmohan Reddy’s late father YS Rajasekhara Reddy, irrigating over 30 lakh acres.</p>
      <p>“Jagan’s decisions on reviewing, reversing and junking the developmental and welfare schemes of Chandrababu Naidu regime merely reflect his vendetta mind-set and short-sightedness to settle political scores and damage the financial roots and vote bank of TDP,” said political analyst Manchala Srinivasa Rao. “In his eagerness to revisit and cancel the large contracts awarded by Chandrababu Naidu to his alleged cronies, Jagan is adding heavy burden on the state exchequer and damaging the state’s larger interests and investment climate.”</p>
      <p>“Jagan could have renamed the developmental and welfare schemes conceived and introduced by Chandrababu Naidu and should have looked at streamlining them if irregularities were proved instead of rolling back the schemes of the previous regime,” said Rao.</p>
