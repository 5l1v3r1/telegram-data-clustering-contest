      <p>WWE has just announced the kickoff match for this year's NXT TakeOver: WarGames event. The 30-minute long kickoff show will now feature a singles action between <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/isaiah-scott">Isaiah "Swerve" Scott</a> and Angel Garza.</p>
      <p>This comes as a huge opportunity for both the rising Superstars as they aim to continue their momentum on the Black-and-Gold brand. Scott, who has been delivering impressive performances against the likes of Dominik Dijakovic, Bronson Reed, and Roderick Strong has another scope of showcasing his potential at the event. On the other hand, <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/angel-garza">Angel Garza</a> needs a win to bounce back after losing the NXT Cruiserweight Championship match to Lio Rush in a disputable fashion.</p>
      <p>With both of them aiming to leave their mark on the Survivor Series weekend, it will be interesting to find out who stands tall when these two talents collide inside the squared circle for the very first time.</p>
