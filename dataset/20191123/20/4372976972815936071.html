      <p><a href="https://www.autoblog.com/tesla/">Tesla</a> Chief Executive <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/tag/elon+musk/">Elon Musk</a> said on Saturday that there have been about 150,000 orders thus far for the electric carmaker's Cybertruck, which was unveiled late on Thursday.</p>
      <p>"146k Cybertruck orders so far, with 42% choosing dual, 41% tri &amp; 17% single motor", Musk said in a tweet, adding separately that the orders were achieved without any <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/tag/advertising/">advertising</a> or paid endorsements.</p>

      <p>The launch of the Cybertruck pickup suffered a setback when <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2019/11/22/tesla-cybertruck-shatterproof-windows-break/">its "armored glass" windows shattered</a> in a much-anticipated unveiling. The overall look of the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/electric/">electric vehicle</a> had <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2019/11/22/tesla-cybertruck-wall-street-skeptics/">worried Wall Street on Friday</a>.</p>
      <p>At the launch, Musk had taken aim at the design, power and durability of mainstream trucks, only to be shaken when the windows of Tesla's <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/research/">new vehicle</a> shattered while being tested.</p>
      <p>The blunder overshadowed the launch, which was live-streamed from Los Angeles and made #cybertruck a trending word on Twitter.</p>
      <p>Some Wall Street analysts praised the launch, but others doubted the futuristic design's mass appeal.</p>
      <p>With a starting price of $39,900, the Cybertruck's angular body in gun-metal grey resembles an armored vehicle. Its website shows that an immediate payment of $100 is required to reserve an order for the Cybertruck. That means Tesla has collected roughly $14.6 million in reservations so far.</p>
      <p>Tesla plans to start manufacturing the truck around late 2021.</p>
      <p>The U.S. pickup truck market is one of the world's most profitable vehicle segments and is dominated by <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/ford/">Ford</a>, <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/category/gm/">General Motors</a> and <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/fiat/">Fiat</a> Chrysler Automobiles.</p>
