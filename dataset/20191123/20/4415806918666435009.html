      <p>Canada will play in the Davis Cup final for the first time in the country’s history after Denis Shapovalov and Vasek Pospisil combined to defeat Russia in Madrid.</p>
      <p>After singles victories for Andrey Rublev and Denis Shapovalov, Shapovalov and Vasek Pospisil teamed up to beat  Rublev and Karen Khachanov 6-3 3-6 7-6 (5) in the deciding doubles.</p>
      <p>A nerve-shredding affair went the distance, as so many ties have in this new-look format, but a final backhand long from Rublev sent Shapovalov and Pospisil leaping into the air and into each other’s arms.</p>

      <p>Canada, who had reached the semi-final stage for only the third time, will play either Spain or Great Britain on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Shapovalov said: “In terms of what we’ve been doing this week, there’s really no words for it. I don’t think any of us expected that we could get this far.</p>
      <p>“Obviously, we knew we have a great team. But you have to have a little bit of luck on your side and just play some ridiculous tennis and play at a ridiculous level. And I think we just absolutely played ridiculous tennis.</p>
      <p>“I’m super-stoked to be in the final. It’s one of my dreams, to play in a Davis Cup final. And to be able to bring the country to this position, it’s just a dream come true.”</p>

      <p>Both Canada and Russia have only used two players during the competition, with Russia relying on Khachanov and Rublev after the withdrawal through fatigue of Daniil Medvedev.</p>
      <p>Canada have benched Shapovalov’s Junior Davis Cup-winning team-mate Felix Auger-Aliassime following an ankle problem and were without Milos Raonic completely because of injury.</p>
      <p>The first rubber pitted two of this week’s biggest stars against each other.</p>
      <p>Neither Rublev nor Pospisil had lost a singles match, the latter despite being ranked 150, but it was the Russian who kept his record intact with a 6-4 6-4 victory.</p>

      <p>That put the pressure on world number 15 Shapovalov against Khachanov and the Canadian number one did not falter, coming from 1-4 down to win the first set and then recovering from 0-40 to serve out the match 6-4 4-6 6-4.</p>
      <p>Khachanov and Rublev had defeated Novak Djokovic and Viktor Troicki in a dramatic doubles rubber on Friday, saving three match points, but Pospisil and Shapovalov are the more accomplished players in the format and it showed in the first set.</p>
      <p>Rublev and Khachanov hit back to level, though, with Pospisil beginning to look understandably weary.</p>
      <p>The 29-year-old, who has had a lot of injury troubles, had his shoulder vigorously massaged in between sets.</p>
      <p>Both teams survived hairy moments in the decider but it was Pospisil and Shapovalov who eventually triumphed, coming from 4-2 down in the tie-break and taking their second match point.</p>
