      <p>Neal Ardley denied his Notts County side have slipped into a comfort zone as he bemoaned two “rubbish” goals that handed victory to Aldershot.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/notts-county-fc">Magpies</a> were beaten 2-1 by the Shots at the EBB Stadium leaving Ardley’s side to suffer back to back defeats for the first time this season.</p>
      <p>Mohamed Bettamer headed in the first for the hosts, before Kyle Wootton’s seventh goal of the season levelled matters no long after.</p>
      <p>But Alfy Whittingham punished poor defending when he robbed Michael Doyle of possession and slipped the ball under Sam Slocombe.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/neal-ardley">Ardley</a> does not feel complacency has set in at Meadow Lane, but their performance stemmed from a lack of intensity.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think anybody turns up just thinking it’s going to be easy,” he said.</p>

      <p>“I think we turned up and we didn’t get going early enough in the game.</p>
      <p>“We shouldn’t be 2-0 down as they were two rubbish goals on the break.</p>
      <p>“We need to solve the issues in terms of the nitty gritty side of the game.</p>
      <p>“If we sort that regularly, whether are passing or decision making is perfect or not, we will still be highly competitive.”</p>
