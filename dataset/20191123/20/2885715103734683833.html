      <h1>BJP appoints vistaraks to bolster Delhi unit</h1>
      <h2>The concept has been taken from pracharaks in the RSS, whose job entails promoting the Sangh’s policies.</h2>

      <p>Gearing up for the upcoming Assembly polls, the Delhi <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/bjp/">BJP</a> unit has appointed vistaraks (expansionists) for all 70 constituencies, whose job will include promoting the party’s ideology and the Centre’s policies among residents.</p>
      <p>The announcement was made by BJP state general secretary Siddharthan at a Delhi BJP meet last week. According to senior leaders, vistaraks have been directed to stay away from 4 Ms — mic, mala, manch (stage) and money. Party leaders said the ‘4M message’ was drafted in view of spats between leaders in public.</p>
      <p>The concept has been taken from pracharaks in the RSS, whose job entails promoting the Sangh’s policies.</p>
      <p>The idea was tested in other states before the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. In Delhi, each vistarak has been given an Assembly constituency different from their home constituency to promote the party’s ideologies in a non-partisan way.</p>
      <p>Vistaraks have also been directed to reach out to prominent RSS functionaries in their area and seek suggestions on public outreach, said a senior leader.</p>
      <p>Addressing workers, BJP national general secretary B L Santosh said that vistaraks should target places where people gather.</p>
      <p>He added that they should reach out to people so that a positive attitude towards the party is created.</p>
      <p>Delhi BJP chief Tiwari said, “Vistaraks should help enroll non-voters and expose the AAP government.”</p>
