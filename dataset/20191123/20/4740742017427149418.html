      <h1>The cosy Bristol pub with a roaring fire which turns 15 this weekend</h1>
      <h2>And it's throwing a massive all-day party to celebrate</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T20:10:37+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 20:10</time> by <a rel="author">Robin Murray</a></address>
      <p>"It really comes into its own at this time of year," said Patrick 'Pato' Rudland, who took over the reins of the Pipe and Slippers in October.</p>
      <p>The 40-year-old has been a key figure at the cosy Cheltenham Road boozer since 2011, but became its landlord last month after owners Mike and Jamie offered him the gig.</p>
      <p>Previously he also looked after The Windmill and the Lazy Dog, which are in the same group, but his full focus is now on The Pipe which means it's likely to go from strength to strength as it celebrates its 15th anniversary.</p>
      <p>"The pub has had a few golden eras since opening in 2004 and I'm hopeful that we're entering another one now," said Pato.</p>
      <p>"There won't be any drastic changes but I'm really looking forward to giving The Pipe my undivided attention."</p>
      <p>The Pipe has become something of a Bristol institution since its launch thanks to a number of factors - and what better time is there to celebrate it than on its 15th birthday?</p>
      <h3>Possibly the cosiest pub in Bristol</h3>
      <p>Bristol is home to a wealth of cosy pubs, but the Pipe and Slippers could stake a claim for being the cosiest.</p>
      <p>Thanks to its roaring fire, abundance of dark wood, warm lighting and comfortable chairs, it has a timeless look and is perfect for autumn and winter nights.</p>
      <p>"We are of course an all-year round pub but when we've got the fire lit and mulled cider on the go it really is special," said Pato.</p>
      <p>Although the Pipe is a stone's throw from the main throng of Stokes Croft, home to the likes of The Love Inn and Crofters Rights, Pato said it feels like it's in its own mini community.</p>

      <p>"Of course, we're not far from the Love Inn, Crofters Rights and the rest, who we all get on really well with," he said.</p>
      <p>"But we have a separate community vibe going on the other side of the traffic lights with our neighbours and good friends Emmeline and The Social. It feels like our own distinct thing.</p>
      <p>"We support each other as much as possible and we're always borrowing various bits and bobs off each other. It's a really nice set-up."</p>
      <h3>Diverse clientele</h3>
      <p>Given its location on Cheltenham Road, near to Stokes Croft, naturally the Pipe and Slippers attracts an exuberant crowd on Fridays and Saturdays, when it hosts live DJs.</p>
      <p>But the boozer isn't exclusively visited by that particular demographic, Pato explained.</p>
      <p>"The ethos of the pub has stayed pretty much exactly the same since it opened," he said. "The key has always been having a diverse clientele.</p>
      <p>"In the week we get the old boys sipping their ales in the corner, lots of students and young people and people on dates, that sort of thing. Then at weekends it's obviously a livelier affair with live DJs.</p>

      <p>"Essentially all different kinds of people come to The Pipe and that's definitely one of the best things about it. That's what a good pub is all about."</p>
      <p>No matter when you visit the pub you're likely to come across plenty of smiling faces - including the staff, who always seem to be enjoying themselves as Pato places an emphasis on their happiness.</p>
      <h3>American-inspired soul food and roast dinners</h3>
      <p>Midweek food at The Pipe is served up by Smoke &amp; Glaze, a pop-up kitchen with serious pedigree.</p>
      <p>Having run successful pop-ups at the likes of The Old Bookshop, The Hillgrove and The Three Tuns, as well as at numerous food markets, The Pipe's bosses offered them a more permanent home.</p>
      <p>They are especially loved for their delicious range of burgers, hailed as some of the best in Bristol, and other decadent treats including their chicken wings.</p>
      <p>On Sundays, the food offering is kept in the family as it is rustled up by Tucha's Kitchen. As well as serving a seriously impressive roast dinner, Tucha is the mother of the man behind Smoke and Glaze.</p>
      <p>"Of course I'm slightly biased but I'd say it's one of the best roasts in Bristol," said Pato. "It's such a high quality plate of food and always a very satisfying feed.</p>
      <p>"On the surface The Pipe and Slippers is a traditional boozer but there's a very high quality offering in terms of both drinks and food, all served in an informal setting.</p>
      <p>"We're fortunate to have two fantastic pop-ups at The Pipe and the fact they've both been here for years means customers can rely on the food to be very decent."</p>
      <p>Pato added that the pub also has its best ever range of beers right now, with Lost and Grounded, Bristol Beer Factory and more on offer for discerning drinkers.</p>
