      <p>Country singer Sam Hunt has broken his silence following his DUI arrest on Thursday. He is taking full responsibility for his not so smart actions.</p>
      <p>Hunt has issued an apology to fans, as well as authorities for “selfish actions” that caused him to drive the wrong way on a Nashville street. He used social media to express his deep regret over what led to his arrest.</p>
      <p>“Wednesday night I decided to drive myself home after drinking at a friend’s show in downtown Nashville. It was a poor and selfish decision and I apologize to everyone who was unknowingly put at risk and let down by it. It won’t happen again,” Hunt shared via Twitter.</p>

      <p>The 34-year-old singer was taken into custody after Nashville police responded to a call of a car driving the wrong way down, Ellington Parkway. According to <i>People</i> magazine, when the cops arrived on the scene, Hunt was severing in and out of his lane.</p>
      <p>Officers pulled him over and immediately noticed he smelled like “an obvious odor consistent with an alcoholic beverage. The police also noticed two empty beer cans on the front seat.</p>
      <p>Cops reported Hunt struggled to give them his driver’s license, even though it was sitting on his lap. The singer reportedly kept giving the officers various credit cards instead of his license.</p>
      <p>The country crooner was the only person in the car and immediately admitted to drinking that night. At the request of the police officers, Hunt agreed to a field sobriety test, which he failed. Footage from the police car dashcam reportedly revealed Hunt “showed numerous signs of impairment.”</p>

      <p>A test to determine how inebriated Hunt was, proved his blood alcohol level was at .173. The Tennessee legal limit is .08. Hunt was immediately taken into custody and booked for driving under the influence. He was released the next day on a $2,500 bond, but Hunt will be back in court to face his consequences on January 17, 2020.</p>
