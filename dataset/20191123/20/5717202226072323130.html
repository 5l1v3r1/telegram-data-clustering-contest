        <b>A number of Tottenham Hotspur fans have taken to Twitter to laud Dele Alli’s display in their 3-2 win over West Ham, with many feeling that Jose Mourinho is ready to transform the 23-year-old.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Mourinho oversaw an impressive victory in his first game in charge of Spurs. Tottenham were 3-0 up inside the 50 minutes thanks to goals from Son Heung-min, Lucas Moura and Harry Kane.</p>

      <p>It was Alli who provided the assist for the opening goal. But it was his role in the second goal that will probably take more of the headlines.</p>
      <p>The England international produced an outrageous pass while on the floor in the build-up to Moura’s goal. It was a reminder of just how good the midfielder can be.</p>

      <p>Alli was superb throughout the game. He adopted the playmaker role around the three goalscorers. And it appears to be fair to say that it was one of his best displays for Tottenham for some time.</p>
      <h3>Alli becoming the Special One again?</h3>
      <p>Unsurprisingly, the fans were delighted with what they saw from the youngster. They are so excited about what Mourinho’s arrival could mean for his game.</p>
      <p>It would be unfair to criticise his form too strongly this season. There were definitely glimpses of his quality before Mauricio Pochettino’s departure. But Mourinho appears to have had an immediate impact.</p>
      <p>Here is what some of the Tottenham fans were saying about Alli’s display…</p>
