      <h1>Official ‘Wilder vs. Ortiz 2’ fight salaries: ‘Bronze Bomber’ guaranteed $20 million for title rematch</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T20:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 20:00</time> by <a rel="author">Dan Hiergesell</a></address>
      <p>Reigning WBC heavyweight king Deontay Wilder (41-0-1, 40 KO) is expected to make a huge payday later tonight (Sat., Nov. 23, 2019) live on FOX PPV from inside MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada, as he defends his title against familiar foe and perennial contender Luis Ortiz (31-1, 26 KO).</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://theathletic.com/1400416/2019/11/22/inside-the-making-of-wilder-fury-2-the-fight-that-brings-al-haymon-and-bob-arum-together-at-last/">The Athletic</a> and <a href="https://www.espn.com/espn/now?nowId=1-28137130">ESPN</a>, Wilder is guaranteed to bank $20 million for his rematch with Ortiz. Wilder’s official fight purse stands at $3 million, but “Bronze Bomber” is setup to earn nearly seven times that number after PPV buys, ticket and merchandise sales, and sponsorship deals are calculated.</p>
      <p>As for Ortiz, who is making his PPV debut tonight in Las Vegas, he is expected to earn a $1.5 million fight purse, but his guaranteed number is closer to $7 million. That would be a career high for the 40-year-old Cuban veteran, which is crazy considering Ortiz has been fighting professionally for nine years.</p>
      <p>Not too shabby for both heavyweights. And if their rematch is anything like their first encounter back in 2018, which ended with a 10th-round TKO by Wilder, these payouts will be well worth it.</p>
      <p>Check out the complete ‘Wilder vs. Ortiz 2’ main card salaries below (via <a href="https://www.espn.com/espn/now?nowId=1-28137130">ESPN</a>):</p>
      <blockquote>Deontay Wilder: $3 million (guaranteed $20 million)<br/>vs. Luis Ortiz: $1.5 million (guaranteed $7 million)<br/>Leo Santa Cruz: $750,000 (guaranteed $2 million)<br/>vs. Miguel Flores: $100,000<br/>Brandon Figueroa: $200,000<br/>vs. Julio Ceja: $50,000</blockquote>
