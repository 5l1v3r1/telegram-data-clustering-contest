      <p>Drama, dance, music, circus arts, gymnastics and cirque-like storytelling all come together for The Light Keeper.</p>
      <p>The original production created and directed by Vernon former Olympian and Okanagan Rhythmic Gymnastics Club operator Camille Martens, comes to life at the Vernon Performing Arts Centre Nov. 29-30.</p>
      <p>The impressive athletic and artistic endeavour stars Mishra Cameron as Glimmer, the curious girl leading everyone on a magical journey. </p>
      <p>The show also features Elle Dockendorff, a member of Canada’s high-performance national team, as a mystical messenger from beyond, Brie-Anne MacPherson as the mayor of ‘Followton’ and Edmonton’s musician and actor Lance Zein, as the Light Keeper.  </p>
      <p>"I first started dreaming about this show back in 2000,” said Martensw. “In 2006, I started drawing images for some of the scenes. It’s been a delightful collaboration with an amazing cast and crew working to bring my dream imagery and this fantastical story to our community. My hope is that the show carries viewers on a journey that will delight and entertain, and also allow them to truly feel, deeply.</p>
      <p>“The thought-provoking messages come wrapped in hilarious, chaotic, tender and beautiful packaging.  This show is our artistic offering to this incredible community, that has done so much for us."</p>
      <p>The show takes place at 7 p.m. Nov. 29 and at 2:30 and 7 p.m. Nov. 30.</p>
      <p>"Our shows are a community collaboration and this year along with a series of local actors, we are working closely with local theatre expert Dave Brotsky and Edmonton musician/actor to create a unique fusion of exciting combinations,” said Martens, the former Olympic rhythmic gymnast who now works with Gymnastics Canada</p>
      <p>Cirque Theatre Company is the performance-based portion of the club, which has been creating original productions since 1999.</p>
      <p>“Every year we use the proceeds of our shows to support local and international children. Last year’s production allowed us to sponsor local refugee children to do our summer camps and full year programs for free and to support a gymnastics team in Brazil who do social rescue programs in the favelas using sport and art,” said Martens.</p>
      <p>Tickets to The Light Keeper are $22.25-$35.25 available through the <a href="http://ticketseller.ca/">ticketseller.ca</a> or by calling 250-549-SHOW (7469).</p>
