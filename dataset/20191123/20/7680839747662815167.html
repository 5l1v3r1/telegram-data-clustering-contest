      <p>In 2019, scientists around the world pulled off some impressive feats: They <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/supermassive-black-hole-first-photo-2019-4">imaged a supermassive black hole</a> for the first time, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ebola-virus-timeline-possible-cure-2019-8">debuted two treatments for the Ebola virus</a>, and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/worlds-first-ever-solar-sail-unfurling-in-orbit-2019-7">launched a spacecraft</a> into orbit that’s powered by sunlight alone.</p>
      <p>Over the past year, researchers have also <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/hidden-continent-greater-adria-buried-under-europe-2019-9">discovered a hidden continent</a>, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/giant-squid-spotted-in-us-waters-for-first-time-2019-6">captured video of a giant squid</a> in its deep-sea habitat, and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/japan-lands-spacecraft-on-ryugu-asteroid-2019-7">sent a probe to an asteroid</a> 5.5 million miles from Earth.</p>
      <p>These and other accomplishments are improving scientists’ understanding of our planet and the surrounding cosmos.</p>
      <p>As a new year – and a new decade – approaches, here’s a look back at some of the most mind-boggling scientific discoveries from 2019.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>On New Year’s Day, NASA’s nuclear-powered New Horizons spacecraft flew past a mysterious, mountain-sized object 4 billion miles from Earth.</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://cdn.businessinsider.nl/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/bc9dca9bca2d0865d87279a1825ba4610fd311cc-800x600.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Foto: New Horizons took this detailed image of space object MU69 (or “Arrokoth”) at 12:26 a.m. EST on January 1, 2019.sourceNASA/JHUAPL/SwRI</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The object, called MU69, is nicknamed Arrokoth, which means “sky” in the Powhatan/Algonquian language (it was previously nicknamed Ultima Thule). It’s the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/nasa-new-horizons-first-images-ultima-thule-mu69-2019-1">most distant object</a> humanity has ever visited.</p>
      <p>The New Horizons probe took hundreds of photographs as it flew by the space rock at 32,200 miles per hour.</p>
      <p>Images revealed that Arrokoth is <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/scientists-puzzled-by-ultima-thule-pancake-shape-2019-2">flat like a pancake</a>, rather than spherical in shape. The unprecedented data will likely reveal new clues about the solar system’s evolution and how planets like Earth formed, though scientists are still receiving and processing the information from the distant probe.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Just days after New Horizons’ fly-by, China’s Chang’e-4 mission put a rover and lander on the far side of the moon — the part we can’t see from Earth.</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://cdn.businessinsider.nl/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/83bb9cd82ed9e801ce0e6932cb721fe89770f8f3-800x600.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Foto: The Yutu-2 rover rolled onto the lunar surface on January 3, 2019 as part of the Chang’e 4 mission to the far side of the moon.sourceCNSA / CLEP</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Before Chang’e-4’s success, no country or space agency had ever <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/china-moon-mission-lunar-landing-far-side-change4-2018-12">touched the far side of the moon</a>.</p>
      <p>The name “Chang’e” is that of a mythical lunar goddess, and the “4” indicates that this is the fourth robotic mission in China’s decade-long lunar exploration program.</p>
      <p>The rover landed in the moon’s South Pole-Aitken Basin, which is the site of a cataclysmic collision that occurred about 3.9 billion years ago. The celestial smash-up left a <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/LRO/multimedia/lro-20100709-basin.html">1,550-mile-wide impact site</a> that likely punched all the way through the moon’s crust. Landing the spacecraft in this crater could therefore enable scientists to study some of the moon’s most ancient rocks.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Elsewhere in the solar system, NASA scientists also learned about Mars quakes, the red planet’s version of earthquakes.</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://cdn.businessinsider.nl/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/be3795ef5f04d7715a874a774d638fbaf345327f-800x800.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Foto: A NASA photo shows the InSight lander’s dome-covered seismometer, known as SEIS, on the surface of Mars.sourceNASA/JPL-Caltech/AP</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>NASA’s InSight lander, which touched down on Mars <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/nasa-insight-mars-probe-landing-successful-science-mission-2018-11">in November 2018</a>, has given scientists the unprecedented ability to detect and monitor Mars quakes.</p>
      <p>The lander’s built-in seismometer detected its first Mars quake in April. Since then, researchers have recorded <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/mars-quakes-nasa-insight-not-like-earthquakes-2019-7">more than 100 seismic events</a>, about 21 of which were likely quakes. Reading the seismic waves on Mars, scientists hope, will reveal clues about what the planet’s inside looks like.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Over 5.5 million miles from Earth, a Japanese spacecraft landed on the surface of an asteroid called Ryugu in July.</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://cdn.businessinsider.nl/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/026ecc135d1325f0daecdffdad5000df3cfa16a6-800x600.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Foto: Hayabusa-2’s view from the asteroid Ryugu.sourceJAXA</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) launched its <a href="http://www.hayabusa2.jaxa.jp/en/">Hayabusa-2</a> probe in December 2014. Hayabusa-2 arrived at Ryugu in June 2018, but didn’t <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/japan-lands-spacecraft-on-ryugu-asteroid-2019-7">land on the asteroid’s surface until this year</a>.</p>
      <p>In order to collect samples from deep within the space rock, Hayabusa-2 <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/japans-hayabusa2-spacecraft-drops-bomb-on-ryugu-asteroid-2019-4">blasted a hole</a> in the asteroid before landing. The mission plan calls for it to bring those samples back to Earth. By studying Ryugu’s innermost rocks and debris – which have been sheltered from the wear and tear of space – scientists hope to learn how asteroids like this may have seeded Earth with key ingredients for life billions of years ago.</p>

      <h3>NASA’s Voyager 2 spacecraft left our solar system this year and entered the depths of interstellar space.</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://cdn.businessinsider.nl/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/b16dd93850407a751581dfbdc8d1f17caea0cc1b-800x600.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Foto: An illustration shows the position of NASA’s Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 probes outside the heliosphere, a protective bubble created by the sun that extends well past the orbit of Pluto.sourceNASA/JPL-Caltech</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The probe beamed back unprecedented data about previously unknown boundary layers at the far edge of our <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/best-solar-system-photos-decade-you-were-born-2019-10">solar system</a> – an area known as the heliopause.</p>
      <p>The discovery of these boundary layers suggests there are stages in the transition from our solar bubble to the interstellar space beyond that scientists did not know about until now.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Scientists also discovered a planet outside our solar system that could be our best bet for finding alien life.</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://cdn.businessinsider.nl/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/66ea2b9135d4d5714f536712cf7af99a17a71f30-800x600.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Foto: An artist’s impression shows the planet K2-18b, the only exoplanet known to host both water and temperatures that could support life. Its host star and an accompanying planet in the system are also shown.sourceESA/Hubble, M. Kornmesser</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>In September, scientists announced they’d <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/water-vapor-on-potentially-habitable-super-earth-exoplanet-2019-9">detected water vapor</a> on a potentially habitable planet for the first time. The planet, named K2-18b, is a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/nasa-tess-telescope-finds-nearby-super-earth-sub-neptunes-2019-7">super-Earth</a> that orbits a red dwarf star 110 light-years away.</p>
      <p>K2-18b is the only known planet <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/extrasolar-planet-nasa-discoveries-data-animated-map-2019-7">outside our solar system</a> with water, an atmosphere, and a temperature range that could support liquid water on its surface. That makes it our “best candidate for habitability,” one researcher said.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>This was also a watershed year for the study of black holes. In April, the Event Horizon Telescope team published the first-ever image of a black hole.</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://cdn.businessinsider.nl/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/010c5c607a6fd9a441b9e3d1746e715084283637.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Foto: Scientists obtained the first image of a black hole using Event Horizon Telescope observations of the center of the galaxy M87. The image shows a bright ring formed as light bends in the intense gravity around the black hole.sourceEvent Horizon Telescope Collaboration</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The unprecedented photo shows the supermassive black hole at the center of the Messier 87 galaxy, which is about <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/interstellar-anniversary-learned-about-black-holes-2019-11">54 million light-years away from Earth</a>. The black hole’s mass is equivalent to 6.5 billion suns.</p>
      <p>Though the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/black-hole-first-photo-event-horizon-telescope-picture-explained-2019-4">image is somewhat fuzzy</a>, it showed that, as predicted, black holes <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/supermassive-black-hole-first-photo-2019-4">look like dark spheres surrounded by a glowing ring of light</a>.</p>
      <p>Scientists struggled for decades to capture a black hole on camera, since black holes distort space-time, ensuring that nothing can break free of their gravitational pull – even light. That’s why the image shows a unique shadow in the form of a perfect circle at the center.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>That wasn’t the only black hole breakthrough this year: For the first time, scientists detected a black hole devouring a nearby neutron star.</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://cdn.businessinsider.nl/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/d71b801d6c190b9e1da0e30988cf270f1291e5db-800x600.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Foto: An artist’s depiction of a black hole about to swallow a neutron star.sourceCarl Knox, OzGrav ARC Centre of Excellence</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>In August, astrophysicists detected the aftermath of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/waves-from-black-hole-swallowing-neutron-star-2019-8">a collision between a black hole and a neutron star</a> (the super-dense remnant of a dead star).</p>
      <p>The catastrophic collision nearly a billion years ago created <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/what-are-gravitational-waves-and-why-are-they-important-2016-2">ripples in space-time</a>, also known as <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/gravitational-waves-detected-first-time-ligo-2016-2">gravitational waves</a>. They passed through Earth this year.</p>
      <p>This was the third event scientists observed using gravitational-wave detectors. In 2015, researchers detected waves from the collision of two black holes, and in 2017 they observed two neutron stars merging.</p>
      <p>Einstein predicted the existence of gravitational waves in 1915, but thought they’d be too weak to ever pick up on Earth. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ligo-virgo-detecting-gravitational-waves-more-sensitive-black-hole-collisions-2019-3">New tools have proved otherwise</a>.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>This year saw many innovations in space-travel technology, too. In March, SpaceX launched Crew Dragon, a commercial spaceship designed for NASA astronauts, into orbit for the first time.</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://cdn.businessinsider.nl/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/5aa82d2f93d8cdeb7d02895d8cf971f30b6b186d-800x463.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Foto: An illustration of SpaceX’s Crew Dragon spaceship orbiting Earth.sourceKennedy Space Center/SpaceX via Flickr</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The maiden flight of Crew Dragon marked the first time that <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/spacex-crew-dragon-launched-rocket-nasa-commercial-mission-2019-3">a commercial spaceship</a> designed for humans has left Earth.</p>
      <p>It was also the first time in eight years that any American spaceship made for people launched into orbit. Crew Dragon’s successful test flight was a critical milestone for the US. Since NASA retired its fleet of space shuttles in 2011, the US has relied on Russian rockets and ships to taxi astronauts to and from the ISS.</p>

      <h3>Scientists also successfully harnessed the power of sunlight to power a spacecraft.</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://cdn.businessinsider.nl/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/dcbe1c5ebec429a58662ca10697fd6a3abb9d887-800x450.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Foto: An artist’s concept of LightSail 2 above Earth.sourceJosh Spradling/The Planetary Society</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>This summer, the Planetary Society – led by science communicator Bill Nye – launched a satellite called <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/worlds-first-ever-solar-sail-unfurling-in-orbit-2019-7">LightSail 2 into orbit</a>, where it then unfurled a 344-square-foot solar sail.</p>
      <p>As light particles reflect off that sail, they transfers momentum to the spacecraft.</p>
      <p>A spacecraft that utilizes a solar sail in this way has an almost unlimited supply of energy. Advancing this type of propulsion technology could one day help spacecraft reach nearby star systems that aren’t currently accessible due to the finite amounts of fuel we can launch off the planet.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>On Earth, scientists have also made monumental — though often troubling — discoveries. Climate researchers found that the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets are melting at unprecedented rates.</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://cdn.businessinsider.nl/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/8d368e0ff2d3bbca1c333cea5e705f8f83bd4fb5-800x450.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Foto: A gigantic cavity nearly 1,000 feet tall is shown at the bottom of Thwaites Glacier in West Antarctica on January 30, 2019.sourceNASA/OIB/Jeremy Harbeck</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p><a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2019/04/16/1904242116">In April, a study</a> revealed that the Greenland ice sheet is sloughing off an average of 286 billion tons of ice per year. Two decades ago, the annual average was just 50 billion.</p>
      <p>In 2012, Greenland lost <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/greenland-approaching-threshold-of-irreversible-melting-2019-1">more than 400 billion tons of ice</a>.</p>
      <p>Antarctica, meanwhile, lost an average of 252 billion tons of ice per year in the last decade. In the 1980s, by comparison, Antarctica lost 40 billion tons of ice annually.</p>
      <p>What’s more, parts of Thwaites Glacier in western Antarctica are retreating by up to 2,625 feet per year, contributing to <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7322">4% of sea-level rise worldwide</a>. <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2019/07/02/1904822116">A study</a> published in July suggested that Thwaites’ melting is a time bomb that is likely approaching <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/antarctic-glacier-on-way-to-irreversible-melt-2019-7/">an irreversible point</a> after which the entire glacier could collapse into the ocean. If that happened, global sea levels would rise by more than 1.5 feet.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Researchers’ predictions about coming sea-level rise are getting more accurate — and scarier. Estimates suggest the world’s oceans could rise 3 feet by 2100.</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://cdn.businessinsider.nl/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/8b1ef6b94c03a5c3f1be02827ed3dbb95e83dda3.jpg"/>

      </figure>
      <p>A September report from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change projected that sea levels could <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/sea-level-rise-3-feet-in-80-years-un-report-2019-9">rise by more than 3 feet</a> by the end of the century. The rising water could affect hundreds of millions of people who live on small islands and in coastal regions.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-12808-z">Another study</a> suggested that the number of people displaced by sea-level rise could reach 630 million if greenhouse-gas emissions continue to rise through 2100.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Another landmark UN report revealed that between 500,000 and 1 million plant and animals species face extinction, many within decades.</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://cdn.businessinsider.nl/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/18a9f0e7d164a7dd5a0b7131e5f8913495eca2ed-800x600.jpg"/>

      </figure>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/1-million-species-could-go-extinct-un-report-2019-5">report, published in April, estimated</a> that 40% of amphibian species, more than 33% of all marine mammals and reef-forming corals, and at least 10% of insect species are threatened, largely as a result of human actions. Researchers also found that more than 500,000 land species already don’t have enough natural habitat left to ensure their long-term survival.</p>
      <p>This finding contributes to a rapidly growing body of evidence that suggests Earth is the midst of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/insects-dying-off-sign-of-6th-mass-extinction-2019-2">a sixth mass extinction</a> – the sixth time in the planet’s history that species are experiencing a major global collapse in numbers.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>One nearly long-lost species, however, emerged from the wilderness this year. In June, scientists spotted a giant squid in its deep-sea habitat in the Gulf of Mexico.</h3>
      <figure>

      <p>Hundreds of millions of years ago, Earth had one giant supercontinent named Pangea, which eventually broke up into our modern-day continents. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1342937X19302230#!">A recent study</a> showed that in that process, an eighth continent slid under what is now southern Europe about 120 million years ago.</p>
      <p>It’s still hidden deep within the Earth.</p>
      <p>The researchers named this continent <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/hidden-continent-greater-adria-buried-under-europe-2019-9">Greater Adria</a>. Its uppermost regions formed mountain ranges across Europe, like the Alps.</p>

      <p>The skull, which belonged to the species Australopithecus anamensis, is <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/first-Australopithecus-anamensis-skull-discovered-in-ethiopia-2019-8">3.8 million years old</a>. The fossil, nicknamed “MRD,” revealed that these ancient people had protruding faces with prominent foreheads and cheek bones, much like other australopithecus species in the fossil record.</p>
      <p>MRD’s age also suggested that these human ancestors coexisted with another species of human ancestor, Australopithecus afarensis, for at least 100,000 years. The nearly complete skeleton “Lucy” was a member of that latter group, which roamed Africa between 3.9 million and 3 million years ago.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1067-9">A study</a> described how this human ancestor shared traits with <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/difference-humans-neanderthals-homo-sapiens-2016-9">older human ancestors</a> like Australopithecus and Homo erectus, as well as with modern-day humans.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1714-1?utm_source=commission_junction&amp;amp;utm_medium=affiliate">An October study</a> suggested that every person alive today descended from a woman who lived <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/origin-of-modern-humans-botswana-africa-2019-10">in an area of modern-day Botswana</a> south of the Zambezi River about 200,000 years ago. Researchers narrowed in on that area using genetic analysis of DNA that gets passed down the female line.</p>
      <p>This finding supports the theory that modern human ancestors migrated out of Africa then populated the world, rather than evolving in different pockets around the globe simultaneously.</p>

      <p>At a site in Egypt’s Asasif necropolis, where the ancient city of Thebes once stood, diggers uncovered <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/photos-30-ancient-egyptian-sarcophagi-opened-preserved-mummies-2019-10">30 ancient wooden sarcophagi</a> with perfectly preserved mummies inside.</p>
      <p>The coffins are about 3,000 years old and were probably for priests and children.</p>

      <p>According to quantum mechanics, two particles can be paired and separated, yet remain intimately and instantly connected across vast distances. One particle will affect the other no matter how far apart they are.</p>
      <p>This is <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/quantum-entanglement-einstein-first-picture-2019-7">“quantum entanglement,”</a> and the strange phenomenon rattled Albert Einstein so much that he died disbelieving it could exist.</p>

      <p>In July 2019, the World Health Organization declared the Ebola outbreak in Africa a global health emergency. Fortunately, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ebola-virus-timeline-possible-cure-2019-8#in-february-2019-things-took-a-turn-for-the-worse-when-humanitarian-organization-doctors-without-borders-left-drc-its-workers-had-been-attacked-150-times-in-a-year-five-aid-workers-were-killed-and-50-were-injured-42">two experimental treatments</a> proved to dramatically boost survival rates.</p>
      <p>The two treatments, called REGN-EB3 and mAb-114, are cocktails of antibodies injected into people’s bloodstreams. These therapies saved about 90% of new infected patients in the Congo.</p>
      <p>“From now on, we will no longer say that Ebola is incurable,” Jean-Jacques Muyembe, director general of the Institut National de Recherche Biomedicale in Republic of Congo, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ebola-is-now-curable-heres-how-the-new-treatments-work/">told Wired</a>.</p>

      <p>Babies who are born with X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (XSCID) don’t have disease-fighting immune cells. For them, the outside world is an intensely dangerous place.</p>
      <p>XSCID was nicknamed “bubble-boy” disease because of a young boy named David Vetter, who famously lived his entire life in a protective plastic bubble. Vetter died more than 30 years ago at age 12 after a failed treatment.</p>
      <p>In April, St. Jude scientists announced that they had <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/mustang-bio-st-jude-new-gene-therapy-for-bubble-boy-disease-xscid-2019-4">successfully cured babies with XSCID</a> using a new experimental gene therapy.</p>
