      <p>A number of police officers have been assaulted after a large brawl broke out at a cinema in Birmingham.</p>
      <p>Officers were called to reports of people with machetes at Star City, in the Nechells area of the city, shortly after 5.30pm on Saturday.</p>
      <p>They found a group of more than 100 people there, and said "pockets of fighting" had broken out.</p>
      <p>West Midlands Police confirmed that several arrests had been made and said a dispersal order had been put in place, meaning officers can arrest anyone who refuses to leave when asked.</p>

      <p>One eyewitness said that "a young boy was crying on the floor with his mother" as a number of young people started fighting.</p>
      <p>Rachael Allison told the PA news agency: "The police told everyone to leave the cinema as they held Taser guns in their hands and started to bring in guard dogs.</p>
      <p>"I spoke to a policeman who told me it is unclear whether the kids had weapons and also stated when kids fight they bring their group of friends."</p>
      <p>Another eyewitness described it as "one of the scariest moments of [her] life", as she queued to watch the new Frozen film with her daughter.</p>
      <p>Choleigh McGuire said: "Armed police come, Tasers come, all of the people that were fighting ran off into the cinema, hiding. I am shaking."</p>
