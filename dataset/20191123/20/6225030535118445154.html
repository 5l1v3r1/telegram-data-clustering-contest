      <p>Undefeated two-year-old colt <a href="https://www.horseracingnation.com/horse/Halo_Again_1"><b>Halo Again</b></a> captured the 116th running of the $225,000 Coronation Futurity for Canadian-foaled two-year-olds Saturday at Woodbine Racetrack.</p>
      <p>The Coronation Futurity, contested over 1 1/8 miles on the Tapeta, is considered a stepping-stone to Canada’s most famous race, the Queen’s Plate. The first jewel of the Canadian Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing is set for June 27, 2020 at Woodbine.</p>
      <p>Trained by Steve Asmussen, Halo Again arrived at Woodbine after making a victorious seven-furlong debut at Churchill Downs on Oct. 27.</p>
      <p>With Rafael Hernandez aboard for the Coronation Futurity, Halo Again raced along the rail behind pacesetter Green Growth with Tomcat Black tracking most of the way through panels of :25.29, :50.15 and 1:14.76.</p>
      <p>Despite losing position in the final turn, Halo Again re-rallied down the stretch and shot through late to score the victory. He prevailed in 1:51.82 by a head over <a href="https://www.horseracingnation.com/horse/Malibu_Mambo_1"><b>Malibu Mambo</b></a>, who closed from last on the far outside into the win photo.</p>
      <p>Finishing in between the top pair, favorite <a href="https://www.horseracingnation.com/horse/Muskoka_Gold"><b>Muskoka Gold</b></a> closed within three-quarters of a length while pacesetter Green Growth was a close fourth. Tomcat Black finished fifth with Northern Thunder, Pleasecallmeback and Kunal completing the field.</p>

      <p>“The first time on the Tapeta and under the night lights, he gave me a hard time but he’s a nice horse,” said Hernandez, who recorded his fourth win of the day.</p>
      <p>Bred in Ontario by Anderson Farms, the Speightstown-Halo’s Verse colt was a $600,000 yearling purchase at the Keeneland sale by Winchell Thoroughbreds LLC and Willis Horton Racing LLC.</p>
      <p>He is a half-brother to multiple graded stakes placed mare Inflexibility, who won the 2017 Canadian Triple Tiara’s Wonder Where Stakes as well as the Carotene Stakes at Woodbine.</p>
