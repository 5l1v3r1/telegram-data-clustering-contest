        <b>A MUM whose son died in a horror road crash blasted the killer driver amid claims he compared his 90mph police chase to Grand Theft Auto.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Caroline Kelly, 45, said Ramsay Stevenson, 21, “bragged” the tree smash which left her lad Cameron Donaldson, 20, dead was like a real-life version of the popular computer game crime caper.</p>

      <p>She told of her agony after the learner driver, who was high on a cocktail of drugs, spoke on social media about the tragedy in Baillieston, Glasgow.</p>
      <p>Caroline, of nearby Easterhouse, said: “Stevenson got out of hospital and was on video chat boasting that it was like Grand Theft Auto getting chased all over the place.</p>
      <p>"A boy has been killed. How can he do that?</p>
      <p>"This is no game, we’re in a living hell. I can’t imagine the fear Cameron endured during that chase.”</p>

      <p>Cameron was in the back seat of the Vauxhall Meriva when Stevenson lost control and hit a tree last October.</p>
      <p>He suffered internal injuries and died eight days after the crash.</p>
      <p>Front seat passenger Pauline McDowell, 27, was seriously hurt.</p>
      <p>Stevenson — who had necked ecstasy, amphetamines and etizolam — fled the mangled motor and was found hiding from cops in a garden.</p>
      <p>He admitted causing death by dangerous driving at the High Court in Glasgow last week. Sentence was deferred and he was remanded in custody.</p>
      <p>Caroline said the loss of Cameron has devastated brothers Kieran and Calvin Donaldson, both 24, and Kayden Sutherland, six, who has never been told how his sibling died.</p>
      <p>She added: “It has shattered me. Cameron didn’t know he was under the influence of drugs and they weren’t friends.</p>
      <p>“Stevenson is a yob. He does not fear danger.</p>
      <p>“You expect your children to get a job and settle down with a wee family. We won’t get the chance.”</p>
