      <h1>J.J. Watt’s Tweet About Chase Young Is Going Viral</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T20:38:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 20:38</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>On Saturday afternoon, the Ohio State Buckeyes hosted the Penn State Nittany Lions in what was billed as a battle of two of the best programs in the Big Ten.</p>
      <p>Ohio State took a 14-0 lead into halftime after dominating the game on the ground for the opening 30 minutes. A comeback attempt from Penn State fell short as the Buckeyes escaped with a 28-17 win.</p>
      <p>The best player of the game was Ohio State defensive end Chase Young.</p>
      <p>The All-American took over in the final few minutes of the game, wreaking havoc on the Penn State offensive line. Fans watching from home are calling for Young to get an invite to New York for the Heisman Trophy ceremony.</p>
      <p>Even an NFL star has taken note.</p>
      <p>Former Wisconsin defensive end J.J. Watt took note of how “special” Chase Young is.</p>

      <p>Young is arguably the best player on the field – every time he takes the field. He’s the defensive player of the year, and should be in the conversation for the Heisman.</p>
      <p>No one disrupts a game quite like Young.</p>
      <p>Next up for Ohio State is the biggest rivalry game of the year as the Buckeyes travel to Ann Arbor for a battle with the Michigan Wolverines.</p>
