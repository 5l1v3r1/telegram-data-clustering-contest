      <p>Sir Jim Ratcliffe has revealed he considered buying Newcastle United but concluded the deal on offer was "not great".</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, would-be owner Joseph DaGrosa believes the financial might of the US will see them dominate football in years to come.</p>
      <p>Here are the top <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Newcastle United</a> stories for November 23.</p>
      <h3>Ratcliffe on considering NUFC</h3>
      <p>Britain’s richest man Sir Jim Ratcliffe has confirmed he looked at buying Newcastle United – among other English clubs – in a wide-ranging interview in which he speaks about valuations making investing in Premier League clubs prohibitive.</p>
      <p>The INEOS billionaire, who bankrolled the historic effort to break the 2 hour marathon and has taken over Nice in Ligue 1, <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/7ca88712-0d66-11ea-800a-ac7a27c0f5a9">spoke to the Times</a><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/newcastle-united-sir-jim-ratcliffe-16211689">about potential interest in Newcastle</a> , as well as Manchester United, Leeds and Chelsea.</p>

        <figcaption>Sir Jim Ratcliffe, founder of Ineos</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The article states that Sir Jim “looked into potential stadium growth” at Newcastle before concluding that it was “not great”. He has been put off investing in Premier League clubs because they do not represent a good return on investment.</p>
      <p>He said: “Ineos never wants to be the dumb money in town, never, never.”</p>
      <h3>DaGrosa on US financial might</h3>
      <p>Would-be Newcastle United owner Joseph DaGrosa told a room full of executives at the Soccerex conference this week that the financial might of the US will ensure the country comes to dominate football in the coming years.</p>
      <p>DaGrosa – whose interest in <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">the Magpies</a> , sources suggest, remains very much alive and kicking – set out his vision for the future of football in the US and said that the influence of players and executives from the States will continue to grow.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/article17227354.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_GettyImages-1059109436.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>DaGrosa, speaking at the Miami version of Soccerex that his GACP group co-own, said: “I believe that Europe wins (in football) in the short term, but the US will win in the long term, because the money is here, the economic power of the United States when it gets behind a project is virtually unstoppable."</p>
      <h3>Willems on Premier League links</h3>
      <p>Jetro Willems was once being eyed by the cream of European clubs after illuminating the big stage with PSV Eindhoven.</p>
      <p>After becoming the youngest player to play at the Euros in 2012 at 18 he was linked with <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> , <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> , AS Roma and AC Milan to name but a few.</p>
      <p>At one stage PSV were even forced to issue a public denial that he was on his way to Old Trafford, but he stayed with the Dutch giants up until 2017, winning two Eredivisie titles and one cup winners medal along the way.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>For all the hype, the move that <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/jetro-willems">Willems</a> eventually did land was a transfer to Eintracht Frankfurt in the Bundesliga and while he helped himself to another cup winners medal in the German DFB-Pokal with a shock win over Bayern Munich, he continued to strive to play on the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/barclays-premier-league">Premier League</a> stage.</p>
      <p>It may not be at the Etihad Stadium or Old Trafford, but Willems is content with life at the moment.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Newcastle</a> have an option to buy Willems at the end of the season and the left-sided player admits he is happy with the way things have worked out.</p>
      <h3>Longstaff 'devastated' to be dropped</h3>
      <p>Steve Bruce has revealed Matty Longstaff was 'devastated' to be dropped from <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Newcastle United's</a> first-team - and has laid out what the teenager must do to maintain his momentum.</p>
      <p>Longstaff enjoyed a Premier League debut to remember playing alongside brother Sean and scoring the winner against Manchester United at <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/st-james-park">St James' Park</a> .</p>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>Steve Bruce embraces Matty Longstaff<cite>(Image: Getty Images)</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The 19-year-old kept his place for the following two matches against Chelsea and Wolves, but the brothers were replaced in the starting XI by Isaac Hayden and Jonjo Shelvey for the victories against West Ham and Bournemouth.</p>
      <p>Longstaff's form with the Magpies was rewarded with two appearances for England's under-20s in the recent international break. Bruce recently stated the club remained "quietly confident" of extending the midfielder's deal - which is due to expire at the end of the season.</p>
      <p>Speaking to BBC Newcastle, United's head coach spoke about the teenager's reaction to being left out of the starting XI, and what he must now do following his rise to the first-teams squad.</p>
      <h3>Harper on learning curve</h3>
      <p>Steve Harper admits that his new role with <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Newcastle United's</a> back-room team is all part of the learning curve after rising from a role with the club's second string just last season.</p>
      <p>Harper assisted Ben Dawson in the Under-23s but stepped down from the role at the end of the campaign.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/article17302000.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_GettyImages-1189360877.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Now he believed he can learn from Steve Bruce and his coaching team at the club's first team base, although his new role will see him work at both ends of the training complex.</p>
      <h3>Nickson's challenge</h3>
      <p>Steve Nickson and his scouting team at <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Newcastle United </a>will eventually be tasked with finding a talented British youngster by <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/steve-bruce">Steve Bruce</a>.</p>
      <p>The Magpies made five first-team signings last summer - <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/joelinton">Joelinton</a>, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/allan-saint-maximin">Allan Saint-Maximin</a>, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/jetro-willems">Jetro Willems</a>, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/emil-krafth">Emil Krafth</a> and <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/andy-carroll">Andy Carroll</a> - and looked at a host of players aged 25 and under in Europe.</p>

      <p>At his previous clubs, Hull City and Aston Villa, Bruce was in charge when Andrew Robertson, Harry Maguire, Jarrod Bowen and John McGinn were all spotted and signed.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/steve-bruce-tips-one-best-17294484">Bruce rates McGinn as his best ever signing </a>and the Newcastle head coach hopes the Magpies can one day unearth a gem like the Scotland international.</p>
      <h3>Francillette's first NUFC goal</h3>
      <p>Newcastle United's big French defender Ludwig Francillette has spoken of his delight at grabbing his first goal in Toon colours - and hopes it can be the first of many.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.chroniclelive.co.uk/incoming/article17304188.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Newcastle-United-v-Benfica-Premier-League-International-Cup.jpg"/>

      <p>The 6ft 4in centre-back has impressed in the club's Under-23 side since making a summer move to St James' Park and is starting to look the part for the Magpies.</p>
      <p>Francillette's bullet header after 13 minutes against Benfica helped Newcastle earn a draw in their first Premier League International Cup clash of the season at Whitley Park.</p>
