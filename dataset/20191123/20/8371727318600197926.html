      <h1>Safaricom Acknowledges They are Experiencing Network Issues</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T20:30:30+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 20:30</time> by <a rel="author">Kiruti Itimu</a></address>
      <p>Safaricom has confirmed that they are experiencing issues with their network that is affecting their voice and data.</p>
      <p>They shared this communique on their social channels.</p>
      <blockquote>Please note that we are experiencing intermittent network challenges affecting a number of services in our network including voice and data for some customers. We are working to restore all services as soon as possible.<br/>We are sorry for any inconvenience and thank you for your patience.</blockquote>
      <p>The notice did not specify all of the services that were affected or the estimated time of restoration of services.</p>
      <p>Safaricom is the biggest telecommunications operator in the country with over 34 million users and if their services are disrupted, it affects a large portion of the population. Voice is still their biggest earning revenue stream and a lot of millenials depend on their data to connect to the Internet.</p>
      <p>This has not been a good weekend for Safaricom customers. They also sent a message to Safaricom Home customers where they said customers should expect slow speeds due to planned maintenance on their service.</p>
      <p>This is not the first time we have seen the telco have <a href="https://techweez.com/2019/08/22/safaricom-internet-down/">network issues this year.</a></p>
      <p>We will update you as soon as Safaricom is able to fix the issues they are facing this weekend.</p>
      <p><b>**UPDATE**<br/></b>Safaricom <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SafaricomPLC/photos/a.10154290882135084/10162520327270084/?type=3&amp;theater">announced</a> that they have successfully restored their services.</p>
