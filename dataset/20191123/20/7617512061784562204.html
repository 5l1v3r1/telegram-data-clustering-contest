      <p>A totem pole representing language revitalization originally slated for the University of Victoria will remain in Port Alberni when carving is complete.</p>
      <p>Master carver Tim Paul is transforming the 800-year-old cedar tree in Port Alberni, where it will remain due to requests from the community.</p>
      <p>Carving is nearly complete, and the pole will be raised in 2020.</p>
      <p>Commissioned by the First Nations Education Foundation -- a Vancouver-based non-profit that works with First Nation governments to develop Indigenous language revitalization programs —the pole was supposed to be raised this year to mark the UN International Year of Indigenous Languages, but a lack of funding stalled the project.</p>
