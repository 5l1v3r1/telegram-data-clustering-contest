      <p>While Kamal Haasan seems to be as busy as a bee with his political activities, his director Shankar is busy canning some important sequences for his upcoming movie ‘<a href="https://www.mirchi9.com/movienews/spoiler-indian-2-look-leaked/">Indian 2</a>‘ without the lead actor on the sets.</p>
      <p>So, Shankar is canning those sequences that do not need the Universal Star. A look at the official handle of his political party ‘Makkal Needhi Maiam’ clearly explains the scenario that the star is occupied with his political party.</p>
      <p>Besides his political activities, Kamal Haasan is said to be recovering from a surgery that he underwent for the removal of the implants that were there in his leg after he suffered a leg fracture in 2016.</p>
      <p>The fans must be happy that the shooting process is progressing steadily, and once Kamal Haasan is ready, he would have to go to the sets for canning the sequences that involve him.</p>
      <p>‘Indian 2’ will naturally carry good buzz because of the combination and also due to the credit of the prequel ‘Indian’.</p>
