      <h1>India's political culture has changed under Modi: Nadda</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T20:54:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 20:54</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/pti" target="_blank">PTI</a></address>
      <p>BJP working president J P Nadda on Saturday claimed the political culture of India had changed after Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power and the country was now corruption-free.</p>
      <p>Addressing 'youth parliament' in Karnavati University in Gandhinagar, Nadda said the earlier 'chalta hai' attitude of the country had changed.</p>
      <p>"The political culture of the country has changed (after Modi came to power). From bhrashtachar-yukt (corrupt), it has become bhrashtachar mukt (corruption-free) and vikas yukt (pro-development)," he said.</p>
      <p>"Earlier the attitude was 'chalta hai' (laid-back) and that 'nothing will change in this country. But now the attitude is that everything can be changed (for the better)," he claimed.</p>
      <p>He said abrogation of provisions of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir was a decisive decision of Modi government and its architect was Union Home Minister Amit Shah.</p>
      <p>"The issue was pending for 70 years, but we have done it. This will help people of Jammu and Kashmir who were deprived of fruits of development," Nadda said.</p>
      <p>Speaking on the law-making triple talaq illegal, Nadda said, "When we can abolish sati system and child marriage and introduce widow remarriage, why could we not end the system of triple talaq?"</p>
      <p>The Congress was against the government's move to ban triple talaq, but it should realise that the practice is not prevalent even in neighbouring Pakistan, Nadda said.</p>
      <p>He said a large number of bills were being passed in Parliament due to the good leadership provided by the Modi government.</p>
      <p>Nadda said he was citing these examples at a gathering of students as it is they who have to play an active role in the change that is taking shape nationwide.</p>
