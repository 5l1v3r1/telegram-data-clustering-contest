      <p>The <i>Daily Courier</i> <a href="http://web.thedailycourier.com/articles/2019/11/21/front_page_news/news001.html?i=59380">reported</a> Thursday that the majority of the food and treats would go towards the Rogue Valley Humane Society’s pet food bank, which fed 5,000 cats and dogs living in low-income areas in 2018.</p>
      <p>A portion of the donated food will also go to a program where homebound senior citizens who have pets get a weekly supply of pet food delivered to them.</p>
      <p>The truckload of donated food should cover the needs of both programs for the next six months, according to executive director Margaret Varner.</p>
      <p>“It’s wonderful,” Madeline Halter, a Humane Society volunteer who helped unload the truck, told the <i>Courier</i>. “It looks like there’s some bags small enough for me to handle.”</p>
      <p>The shelter <a href="https://apnews.com/8a6be2fd643943b58a146191a5b309f0">operates</a> as a no-kill shelter and houses 90 cats and 20 adult dogs. Occasionally, the shelter will receive a rabbit or other animal.</p>
      <p>The organization relies on donations, a staff of 17 people, and 250 to 300 volunteers each year to keep the shelter up and running.</p>
