      <p><b>BROOKVILLE, N.Y.Â (AP)</b> - Christian Carter threw two touchdown passes and Jamari Venter ran for one and Merrimack beat Long Island 24-10 on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Merrimack (6-5) built a 17-0 lead when Carter threw a 9-yard TD pass to Johnny Rosario to end a 12-play, 70-yard drive 91 seconds before halftime.</p>
      <p>Carter threw a 7-yard scoring pass to Anthony Dandini in the second quarter. The Warriors inherited a short field after a 26-yard punt by Briant DeFelice and took over at the Long Island's 22-yard line. Corey Resendes kicked a 36-yard field goal for a 10-0 lead with 1:42 before the end of the first quarter.</p>
      <p>After a scoreless third, early in the fourth, Camden Orth threw a 32-yard scoring pass to Jake Bofshever. DeFelice added a 38-yard field goal to reduce the margin to a touchdown. On the ensuing kickoff, Rodney Samson returned it 73 yards to Long Island's eight-yard line. Venter ran it in from there.</p>
