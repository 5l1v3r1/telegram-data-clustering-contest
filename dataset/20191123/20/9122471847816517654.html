      <p>The Texas Longhorns will attempt to play spoiler today, on the road at Baylor. The Bears are 6-1 in league play after last weekend’s devastating blown game against Oklahoma, but can still get revenge if they make the Big 12 Championship. Tom Herman’s team has a chance to take advantage of a Baylor squad that could be reeling from that game.</p>
      <p>Texas sits at 4-3 in league play and 6-4 overall, at third place in the Big 12. Under Herman, the Longhorns have a reputation for playing up and down to opponents, which would be good news today.</p>
      <p>Baylor is a six-point home favorite entering the game. Things <a href="https://thespun.com/big-12/texas-longhorns/texas-at-baylor-game-time-spread-channel-announcers">kicked off in Waco a few minutes ago</a>.</p>
      <p>Before the game, Herman had a unique way of getting his ‘Horns fired up. In a scrum of his players, he took one by the facemask and headbutt him pretty hard.</p>
      <p>There’s no way that felt good, but whatever works to get the team ready, I guess.</p>

      <p>Just over two minutes into the game, things remain scoreless. Baylor looked like explode out of the gate, after a 44-yard pass to Chris Platt on the second play from scrimmage, but he fumbled it away to the Longhorns.</p>
      <p>We should have a pretty fun quarterback matchup today. Sam Ehlinger entered the year with a bit of Heisman hype, and while that is no longer the case, he’s still having a very good season. Charlie Brewer built on a solid 2018, and has been very impressive for the No. 14 Bears this season.</p>
      <p>Texas caught some real heat from the analysts on <i>College GameDay </i>today, who <a href="https://thespun.com/big-12/texas-longhorns/espn-analysts-have-brutal-message-for-texas-fans">ripped into Tom Herman’s program</a> for how the season has played out, after the declaration that “Texas is back” after it beat Georgia during last bowl season.</p>
      <p>While beating Baylor won’t undo all of the issues from this season, it would certainly help.</p>
