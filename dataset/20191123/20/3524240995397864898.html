        <b>Success Nwogu, Abuja</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Peoples Democratic Party on Saturday urged President Muhammadu Buhari to address the issues of violence, killings and alteration of election results allegedly by the All Progressives Congress under his watch.</p>
      <p>The PDP National Publicity Secretary, Mr. Kola Ologbondiyan also said Buhari can not have a third term.</p>
      <p>He stated that if Buhari sought to uphold the constitution, he should have used the APC National Executive Committee meeting to directly and strongly condemn his party’s alleged resort to violence, killing, forceful invasion of polling units and alteration of results to seize votes in the November 16 Kogi and Bayelsa States governorship elections as well as the Kogi West Senatorial election.</p>
      <p>He said, “President Buhari by now ought to have summoned his service chiefs and ordered a presidential investigation into the violence and observed infractions in the elections, including the deployment of a Police helicopter to teargas voters.</p>
      <p>“It is important to state that such a failure however registers grave meanings to Nigerians.</p>
      <p>“It is also unfortunate that instead of taking concrete and decisive steps to bring the perpetrators of the heinous crimes in Kogi and Bayelsa to book and give assurances of electoral reforms, Mr. President is rather seeking to make discourse of an unattainable third term.”</p>
      <p>According to him, from Buhari’s speech, it is clear that he is more interested in the survival of the APC than the survival of democracy.</p>
