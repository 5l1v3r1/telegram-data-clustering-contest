      <h1>LeBron James Not Happy With The Scene Outside His Hotel In Memphis</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T20:42:19+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 20:42</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/chrisrosvoglou" target="_blank">Chris Rosvoglou</a></address>
      <p>Teams haven’t had much success this season trying to stop LeBron James, but it sounds like residents in Memphis have cracked the code.</p>
      <p>James is having an incredible start to the season with the Los Angeles Lakers. He’s averaging  24.9 points, 7.7 rebounds and 11.3 assists per contest.</p>
      <p>Los Angeles currently owns the best record in the NBA at 13-2. Next up on the schedule are the Memphis Grizzlies.</p>
      <p>The four-time MVP is trying to get some rest before tonight’s game, however, the scene outside of his hotel in Memphis is apparently disruptive.</p>
      <p>James went on social media to complain about the ruckus by his hotel.</p>
      <p>“Literally trying to sleep/rest up for the game this evening and there’s a full out concert going on outside our hotel since around 10am,” James wrote on Twitter. “OK I see what y’all trying to do.”</p>

      <p>Judging off James’ tweets earlier today, the Ohio native enjoyed watching the Buckeyes defeat the Nittany Lions in Columbus.</p>
      <p>We’ll see later tonight if all the commotion outside of James’ hotel will affect his production.</p>
      <p>Tipoff is set for 8 p.m. ET from FedExForum.</p>
