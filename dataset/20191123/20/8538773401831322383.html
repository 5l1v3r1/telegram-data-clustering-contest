      <p>Manchester City striker <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/44927/Sergio-Ag%C3%BCero">Sergio Aguero</a> is a doubt for the derby with United after limping off during the <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/football/report?gameId=541716">2-1 win over Chelsea</a> on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The Argentine, who has scored 13 goals this season, was forced off in the second half at the Etihad Stadium after a challenge from <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/189007/Reece-James">Reece James</a> and is set to undergo a scan on Sunday.</p>
      <p>City face Shakhtar Donetsk, Newcastle and Burnley before United's visit on Dec. 7.</p>
      <p>"We will see but it doesn't look good," said Guardiola. "I think it's muscular. He thought it was a kick but i think he stretched a little bit.</p>
      <p>"He is going to be out some days during the toughest part of our season."</p>
      <p>Guardiola has already lost <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/202641/Leroy-San%C3%A9">Leroy Sane</a> and <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/159317/Aymeric-Laporte">Aymeric Laporte</a> to long-term knee injury and saw midfielders <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/231828/Rodri">Rodri</a> and <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/43815/David-Silva">David Silva</a> also go off injured against Chelsea. Oleks Zinchenko remains sidelined.</p>
      <p>"With Rodri and David they were problems with cramp and tiredness," said Guardiola. "Rodri went a month and a half without playing many games.</p>
      <p>"This kind of game is so demanding because the physicality is incredible. That's why it happened."</p>
