      <h1>Green Party candidate with criminal conviction won't attend hustings - but refuses to say why</h1>
      <h2>Heather Mack was one of four prospective Bristol North West representatives invited to a hustings in Stoke Bishop</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T20:44:31+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 20:44</time> by <a rel="author">Andrew McQuarrie</a></address>
      <p>A convicted <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/extinction-rebellion">Extinction Rebellion</a> activist standing to become an MP in Bristol has rejected an invitation to take part in a hustings event.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/green-party">Green Party</a> member Heather Mack was <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/green-party-candidate-general-election-3551894">given a criminal record</a> earlier this week for a public order offence after participating in a climate protest in London.</p>
      <p>Now, Ms Mack has declined an invitation to attend a hustings in Stoke Bishop on Friday (November 29) for candidates competing to represent Bristol North West in Westminster.</p>
      <p>Ms Mack refused to give an explanation for her decision, but she told Bristol Live it is not related to the punishment for her behaviour on Waterloo Bridge in April.</p>
      <p>Ms Mack said: “It’s got nothing to do with the conviction and I’ll be attending other hustings.”</p>
      <p>She added that there are “plenty of occasions” when parliamentary candidates have declared they would not be able to attend hustings.</p>
      <p>One of the organisers of the Stoke Bishop event told Bristol Live that invitations were sent out to the candidates about two weeks ago.</p>
      <p>Retired businessman Peter Weeks, who will act as chairperson, said he was “obviously disappointed” that Ms Mack would not be appearing on Friday alongside the three other candidates hoping for votes from Bristol North West on December 12.</p>
      <p>Mr Weeks said: “It would be best to give all four candidates the opportunity to meet some of the voters in our area and to make their pitch and to be questioned.”</p>
      <p>The other Bristol North West candidates are Darren Jones (Labour), Mark Weston (Conservative) and Chris Coleman (Liberal Democrats).</p>
      <p>After Ms Mack’s court appearance this week, she made a statement on the result, as reported previously by Bristol Live.</p>
      <p>She said: "I argued that the small, localised disruption at Waterloo Bridge did not justify the impingement on my human right to protest.</p>
      <p>"The court ruled that was not justified. I argued that the impact of climate change justified my action as the danger is imminent.</p>
      <p>“The court ruled that the danger and loss of life was not imminent. I have now been found guilty and will now have a criminal record."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, in other Green Party news, Bristol West candidate Carla Denyer visited the Bristol Somali Resource Centre on Tuesday (November 19).</p>
      <p>Ms Denyer, currently a Bristol councillor, gave a speech at the centre’s AGM, but she said she mainly treated the event as a “listening exercise”.</p>
      <p>She said: “I learnt the enormous amount of work that they do. They support an awful lot of people of Somali origin across the whole city.</p>
      <p>“Usually it’s sorting out issues to do with getting benefits, helping them with housing issues, immigration issues, applying to get their kids in the local schools.”</p>
      <p>Asked why she attended, Ms Denyer said: “I went because I feel it’s important to be in touch with all communities in the constituency and not just the community you’re in.”</p>
