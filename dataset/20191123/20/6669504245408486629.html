      <p>CALGARY - After a blistering early season hit on quarterback Zach Collaros, Hamilton linebacker Simoni Lawrence says the two men have made up but he's warning football is a 'dangerous game' and he's not going to change his style of play.</p>
      <p>The six-foot-one, 231-pound Lawrence received a two-game suspension for a high hit on then Saskatchewan starting quarterback Zach Collaros in Hamilton's season-opening 23-17 win.</p>
      <p>Collaros, who was subsequently dealt to Toronto, was then shipped to Winnipeg at the trade deadline. He was the starter in the Bombers' final regular-season victory and remained in that position for playoff wins over the Calgary Stampeders and Saskatchewan.</p>
      <p>Lawrence sent out a tweet congratulating Collaros on the Bombers' win over the Saskatchewan Roughriders in the West final and said the two had already hashed things out in the aftermath of the incident.</p>
      <p>"I was just proud of him, you know. Whatever happened earlier in the season happened and I still like him. I still care for him. I was just proud of him," Lawrence said this week.</p>
      <p>"Everything's good. We wished each other our best and that's just what it is. At the end of the day, I know how Zach's built. He's a competitive dude. We're excited to play the Winnipeg Blue Bombers.''</p>
      <p>To Collaros the matter is over and done with.</p>
      <p>"We had a conversation there after Labour Day and it's behind us now. Obviously you want to talk through things any time there's a problem in a friendship or any kind of relationship, right? It's nice to get it behind us."</p>
      <p>Lawrence said he won't be engaging in any pleasantries with Collaros in Sunday's Grey Cup.</p>
      <p>"I'm not a polite person playing football. It's the only time I get to be mean. I'm nice to everybody but with football I get to be mean so I take advantage of it," Lawrence said.</p>
      <p>Collaros said he's expecting nothing less from his former Hamilton teammate in a big game.</p>
      <p>"A lot of effort. He's a really good football player and I expect him to do whatever (defensive co-ordinator) Mark (Washington) and (head coach) Orlondo (Steinhauer) ask him to do."</p>
      <p>Lawrence also said it shouldn't come as a surprise to the public and football fans what the game is all about.</p>
      <p>"Football's a dangerous game. I don't understand why people act like football's so nice and pat each other on the butt. It's not like that," he said.</p>
      <p>"I didn't grow up playing football like that so I get it, but it is what it is."</p>
