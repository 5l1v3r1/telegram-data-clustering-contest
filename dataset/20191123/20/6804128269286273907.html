      <h1>Man United legend Roy Keane highlights the mistake Jorginho made vs Man City</h1>
      <h2>Chelsea were beaten 2-1 by the Premier League champions at the Etihad Stadium</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T20:45:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 20:45</time> by <a rel="author">Elliott Jackson</a></address>
      <p>Former Manchester United captain Roy Keane has questioned whether Jorginho should have fouled Kevin de Bruyne before Manchester City's equaliser.</p>
      <p>Pep Guardiola's side went on to beat Chelsea 2-1 with Riyad Mahrez adding to de Bruyne's equaliser after N'Golo Kante had given the Blues the lead at the Etihad Stadium.</p>
      <p>The defeat ends Chelsea's six-game winning run in the Premier League, whilst also dropping them down to fourth in the table with Manchester City and Leicester City both collecting three points each.</p>
      <p>However, the gap to fifth-place Wolves remains seven points after 13 Premier League fixtures.</p>
      <p>Despite playing well in the match, two crucial moments cost Frank Lampard's side the win.</p>
      <p>Although de Bruyne's equaliser took a wicked deflection on its way past Kepa Arrizabalaga, Keane still felt the goal could have been defended better.</p>
      <p>Jorginho gave the ball away initially and after recovering to the edge of his own box, dived in on de Bruyne, who slipped the ball over to his left foot to fire in the shot.</p>
      <p>It was the Italian's decision to dive in that irked Keane, who believes Jorginho should have stayed on his feet or, at worst, bring him down for a free-kick.</p>
      <p>"Even when Jorginho gives the ball away, he ends up taking a gamble," Keane told Sky Sports after the full-time whistle.</p>
      <p>"Just drop back in and make sure the ball doesn't go the other side of you or the man, or you go and give the foul away.</p>
      <p>"You have to be clinical in these situations or be dirty."</p>
