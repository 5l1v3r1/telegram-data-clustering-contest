      <p>Bruno Tonioli told them: "Brilliant! What I loved is the change in the dynamics how you mixed the movements. It had that freedom of spirit that I loved."</p>
      <p>Motsi Mabuse added: "I stand tonight, as a dancer, I'm amazed at what you bring to the show.</p>
      <p>"Your technique is unbelievable. I love that you always give 100%. To watch you is a gift."</p>
