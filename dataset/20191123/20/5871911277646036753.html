      <p>The Cincinnati Reds are finally preparing to “go for it,” with their young guys having developed, and the trade with the Dodgers adding veteran talent to round out the roster.</p>
      <p>It’s been a few years of rebuilding, but the team is now looking to build around the talent it has, while adding a few key pieces in free agency to shore up their weaknesses.</p>
      <p>And it’s pretty easy to identify the team’s No. 1 weakness — starting pitching.</p>
      <p>As such, the Reds are expected to sign at least one top-flight pitcher over the next few weeks, with Mets hurler Zack Wheeler near the top of their list, as he gets set to hit the free-agent market, according to Ken Rosenthal of The Athletic.</p>
      <p>Rosenthal <a href="https://theathletic.com/1401490/2019/11/22/rosenthal-the-reds-are-interested-in-zack-wheeler-the-braves-big-bullpen-bet-more-notes/">reported</a> that the team is <a href="https://twitter.com/MLBNetwork/status/1197893299086004224">interested</a> in Wheeler, which comes on the heels of the news about the team being in on Marcell Ozuna as well.</p>
      <p>Wheeler had a rough 2019 campaign, posting a 11-8 record and 3.96 ERA for the Mets.</p>
