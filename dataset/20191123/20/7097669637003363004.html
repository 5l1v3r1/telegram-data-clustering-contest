      <p>Tel Aviv (AFP) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's centrist rival Benny Gantz Saturday urged leaders of the premier's Likud party to join him in forming a government after their chief's indictment on corruption charges.</p>
      <p>"In light of the circumstances, I call for the formation of the largest possible government under my leadership," Gantz told a news conference, addressing members of the right-wing Likud.</p>
      <p>"I would be the prime minister for the first two years," he said.</p>
      <p>And if Netanyahu "is cleared (of any wrongdoing) he could return and become prime minister", Gantz added.</p>
      <p>Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit announced Thursday he had charged Netanyahu with bribery, fraud and breach of trust, prompting speculation that the end of the premier's decade-long tenure was nigh.</p>
      <p>The indictment came as Israel edged closer to its third general election in a year, after two inconclusive polls in April and September.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday former army general Gantz, whose party gained one more seat than Likud in the September poll, said he was unable to form a government and secure a majority in the 120-seat Knesset, or parliament.</p>
      <p>Gantz, leader of the centrist Blue and White coalition, was asked to form a government by President Reuven Rivlin after Netanyahu also failed to do so.</p>
      <p>Netanyahu remains the country's interim premier, however.</p>
      <p>Parliament now has less than three weeks to find a candidate who can gain the support of more than half of the Knesset's 120 lawmakers, or a deeply unpopular third election will be called.</p>
      <p>Gantz, speaking in Tel Aviv, said his proposal was "the only alternative to holding new elections".</p>
      <p>Under Israeli law, while ministers cannot remain in place after being indicted, a prime minister is not legally required to resign unless convicted and with any appeals processes exhausted.</p>
      <p>In addition to the premiership, Netanyahu holds portfolios including agriculture and health, positions he may have to vacate in the coming days.</p>
      <p>Netanyahu, the first Israeli prime minister to be indicted in office on corruption charges, has denounced a "coup" against him, dismissed the charges as "false" and "politically motivated" and vowed to hold onto power.</p>
