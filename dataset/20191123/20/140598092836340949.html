      <h1>Vape products must not be sold as medicines, academics claim</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T20:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 20:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/steve-bird/" target="_blank">Steve Bird</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/e-cigarettes/">Vaping</a> products should be sold from behind the counter amid increasing<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/11/11/vape-peril-doctors-warn-reveal-teenage-boy-contracted-life-threatening/"> concern they pose a risk to health</a>, experts have claimed.</p>
      <p>Martin McKee, Professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said e-cigarettes and nicotine ‘juices’ should be placed in closed cabinets rather than sold as healthcare items in supermarkets.</p>
      <p>In 2015, Public Health England (PHE) advised smokers to switch to vaping because research suggests it is 95 percent safer than smoking tobacco.</p>
      <p>However, the move has led to some major stores placing e-cigarettes among healthcare products, with some supermarkets stacking juices next to sweets at the checkout.</p>

      <p>Professor McKee fears positioning them alongside medicines could mislead consumers.</p>
      <p>“Even if you accept Public Health England’s claim that e-cigarettes are 95 per cent safer than conventional ones - which hardly any health organisation outside England does - they are still hazardous,” he said. “For this reason it is bizarre to present them as a health product.”</p>
      <p>Professor Stanton Glantz, director of the Tobacco Control Research and Education at the University of California, backed calls to make over 18 vaping products less accessible.</p>
      <p>“Putting e-cigarettes next to medicines reinforces the misimpression that they are healthy,” he said. “They have no business next to medicines.  These products don’t belong next to sweets at the checkout either.”</p>
      <p>US health officials recently warned people to stop vaping after a number of deaths and more than 200 cases of respiratory deaths were linked to the devices. There has also been <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2019/11/15/non-smokers-should-never-take-vapingbut-heart-benefits-tobacco/">growing concern youngsters</a> take up the habit because is appears fashionable.</p>
      <p>John Dicey, boss of Allen Carr’s Easyway stop smoking programme, said while he supports the use of e-cigarettes to quit, his organisation has seen a rise in youngsters addicted to vaping.</p>
      <p>“We’ve had an increase in the number of vapers attending our centres seeking help to quit, some of whom started under the age of 16. It’s an alarming trend,” he said. </p>
      <p>“This year our USA website had more hits as a result of searches for ‘quit vaping’ than for ‘quit smoking’.”</p>
      <p>Professor John Newton, director for health improvement at PHE said: “PHE has always been clear that vaping is not without risks. If you don’t smoke don’t vape. </p>
      <p>“But if you smoke there is no situation where it would be better for your health to continue smoking rather than switching completely to vaping. The sooner you stop smoking completely the better.”</p>
      <p>“UK regulated e-cigarettes carry a fraction of the risk of smoked tobacco. This view is held by many across the world, including the Royal College of Physicians, Cancer Research UK, the British Medical Association and the National Academy of Sciences in the US.”</p>
      <p>Kruti Shrotri, Cancer Research UK’s tobacco control manager, said: “E-cigarettes are a relatively new product and we strongly discourage non-smokers from using them as they aren’t risk-free and we don’t yet know their long-term impact. But research so far shows that vaping is less harmful than smoking tobacco, and can help people to stop smoking. For the best chance of quitting, get support from a Stop Smoking Service, who can help you find the right tools for you.”</p>
      <p>Deborah Chief Executive of Action on Smoking and Health (ASH) said: “When it comes to buying e-cigarettes, the important thing is that they are not sold to children, not where the products are placed. </p>
      <p>“As with all products restricted to those 18 years and over, retailers should check for proof of age for purchasers who look under 25. </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/11/13/giving-moral-panic-vaping-would-risk-lives-smokers/">“E-cigarettes are legal for people 18 years old and over to purchase, and they are also the most popular aid to quitting smoking in the UK. </a>The latest evidence is that between 50,000 and 70,000 people quit smoking due to their use of e-cigarettes in 2017 alone. Nicotine Replacement Therapy is available on the shelves and over the counter, and e-cigarettes should be too.“  </p>
