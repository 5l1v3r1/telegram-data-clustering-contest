      <p>South Korean K-pop band Super Junior’s Shindong just recently updated the progress on his weight loss journey.</p>
      <p>At the end of last month, Shindong revealed that he would be focusing on losing weight for health reasons.</p>
      <p>He had lost 17 kilograms, going from a starting weight of 116 kilograms to 99 kilograms.</p>
      <p>The reason he decided to lose weight was to stay healthy and continue his career as a member of Super Junior.</p>

      <p>Shindong had been suffering from continued yo-yo weight fluctuations from trying out different diets.</p>
      <p>He also said that he has been finding it tough to dance on stage because of his overall level of physical activity had decreased.</p>
      <p>Inspired by Yoo Jae Hwan who recently lost 32 kilograms, Shindong followed the same program because he needed to find a healthier way to lose weight.</p>
      <p>The Super Junior member shared that he has been on a lot of diets, so many that he could say that he tried them all.</p>
      <p>Due to weight fluctuations, he was recently at his heaviest and he wasn’t sure if he could lose weight on his own so he sought professional help.</p>
      <p>Shindong said he has been eating a balanced diet with three meals a day and seeing the weight fall off even without exercise.</p>
      <p>That’s when he realised why he had been failing at his other diets. Through AI analysis, Shindong was able to understand the state of his body and get professional consulting.</p>
      <p>He added that it’s so interesting and fun to watch his health improve through data.</p>
      <p>Shindong also joked that his stylist is having a tough time finding new clothes for him as he’s gotten slimmer and his old clothes don’t.</p>
      <p>The singer also feels more energetic and is enjoying more when he’s dancing on stage.</p>
      <p>Sharing photos of his progress on his Instagram account, he wrote that it’s not over and he is not even halfway there.</p>
