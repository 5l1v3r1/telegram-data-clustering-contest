      <p>Denis Shapovalov described it as "ridiculous" and captain Frank Dancevic admitted he almost blacked out as Canada beat Russia to reach their first Davis Cup final on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The 20-year-old Shapovalov teamed up with Vasek Pospisil to win the deciding doubles rubber against Russian duo Andrey Rublev and Karen Khachanov and hand Canada a 2-1 victory.</p>
      <p>They will meet either Spain or Britain in the final.</p>
      <p>For Shapovalov it was an especially sweet moment as the Davis Cup has not always been kind to him. In 2017, in his second tie, he was defaulted from a World Group tie against Britain after accidentally striking the umpire with a ball.</p>

      <p>That was all forgotten though as he and the 29-year-old Pospisil, who is ranked 150 after missing six months this year because of back surgery, held their nerve after the tie boiled down to a third-set tiebreak.</p>
      <p>After winning 6-3, 3-6 7-6 (5) the two Canadians danced for joy as several hundred Canadian fans roared their approval.</p>
      <p>"I don't think any of us expected that we could get this far," Shapovalov said. "We knew we have a great team. But you have to have a little bit of luck on your side and just play some ridiculous tennis and play at a ridiculous level.</p>
      <p>"I think we just absolutely played ridiculous tennis. I'm super-stoked to be in the final. It's one of my dreams, you know, to play in the Davis Cup final."</p>
      <p>With Milos Raonic injured and another of Canada's young guns, Felix Auger-Aliassime, ranked 21, unable to play a match so far this week, Dancevic has had to rely on a two-man team.</p>

      <p>But how they have delivered. Pospisil won three successive singles matches against Italy, the US and Australia en route to the semi-finals and he and Shapovalov won the decisive doubles rubber against Australia.</p>
      <p>Pospisil lost 6-4, 6-4 to Rublev on Saturday but left-hander Shapovalov, whose parents are Russian, stepped up to level the tie, showing great tenacity to beat Khachanov 6-4, 4-6, 6-4.</p>

      <p>After the latest thrilling tie at the revamped Davis Cup, Dancevic said it had been hard to sit on the chair and watch.</p>

      <p>"When I was sitting there on match point, my heart was beating so fast, I was actually starting to black out," he said. "I was trying to control my breathing and just telling myself to breathe slowly, stay calm, we're close to this.</p>
      <p>"It's definitely an emotional rollercoaster, sitting on the chair. But at the day it's an amazing feeling having your guys perform like this and put 110 percent on the court."</p>
      <p>Pospisil, who moved fourth on his country's all-time list with 22 match wins in Davis Cup ties, said it was another special day for Canadian tennis in a year which saw teenager Bianca Andreescu become the country's first Grand Slam champion by beating Serena Williams at the US Open.</p>
      <p>"It's kind of like building, building, building, and every match feels that much more emotional," he said.</p>
      <p>"It's pretty incredible to make the final, first time in history for Canada. To do it the way it happened was pretty special to be a part of."</p>
