      <p>Alex Scott and Saffron Barker are both at risk of being eliminated from Strictly Come Dancing this week.</p>
      <p>Former footballer Scott and YouTube star Barker were both at the bottom of the leaderboard for their dances in Saturday night’s episode, the week before the quarter-finals.</p>
      <p>Scott and her dance partner Neil Jones scored 26 points from the judges – including a four from Craig Revel Horwood – for their Argentine tango to Bishop Briggs’s version of Never Tear Us Apart from the film Fifty Shades Freed.</p>

      <p>The judges were largely complimentary about their routine, although Revel Horwood was more critical, telling the former footballer that she looked like she was “churning butter”.</p>
      <p>Professional dancer Jones took the blame for any mistakes that were made during the dance, telling the panel: “It’s on me, I was leading her.”</p>
      <p>The couple also faced a wardrobe malfunction when their outfits became attached after their dance, leaving Jones having to carry Scott over to the judges.</p>
      <p>Host Tess Daly had to help the pair become unattached as she joked about a “microphone malfunction”, adding that it could also be a “sequin malfunction”.</p>

      <p>Barker and dancer AJ Pritchard received the same score of 26 for their samba to Walking On Sunshine by the Take Me To Rio Collective.</p>
      <p>The lower score for Barker comes a week after she was in the dance-off against Michelle Visage, who was booted from the competition.</p>
      <p>At the top end of the leaderboard were Kelvin Fletcher and Karim Zeroual, who both scored 38 points from the judges.</p>
      <p>Soap star Fletcher and his partner Oti Mabuse impressed the judges with a street/commercial routine to Frank Wilson’s Do I Love You (Indeed I Do), a song that the actor said meant a lot to him.</p>

      <p>Children’s TV presenter Zeroual’s emotional contemporary dance to With Confidence hit Drops Of Jupiter with partner Amy Dowden almost had the judges in tears, and they were full of praise.</p>
      <p>However, Revel Horwood did warn him that his performance lacked “emotional content” to boos from the audience.</p>
      <p>It was the second week in a row that Fletcher and Zeroual both came in joint first place.</p>

      <p>Comedian Chris Ramsey and his partner Karen Hauer came in third place with 31 points after he performed his most serious dance yet – a paso doble to Run Boy Run by Woodkid.</p>
      <p>EastEnders star Emma Barton tackled a quickstep to Sparkling Diamonds by Nicole Kidman from the film Moulin Rouge! with Anton du Beke, for which they scored 29 points, a drop of eight after their score of 37 last week.</p>
      <p>Judge Bruno Tonioli opened the show by singing a rendition of Can’t Take My Eyes Off Of You while the professional dancers performed a group routine.</p>
      <p>Strictly Come Dancing: The Results will air at 7.15pm on Sunday on BBC One.</p>
