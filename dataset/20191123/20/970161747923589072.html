      <p>When it comes to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m a Celebrity</a>, there are certain things that can be counted on.</p>
      <p>A ‘sexy’ shower scene? 2019 has that covered thanks to, er, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/22/im-a-celebritys-kate-garraway-in-stitches-as-she-showers-andrew-maxwell-dressed-in-budgie-smugglers-11204178/">Andrew Maxwell’s budgie smugglers</a>. Hilarious fails from well-meaning stars? <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/caitlyn-jenner/">Caitlyn</a> <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/22/im-celebrity-viewers-left-hysterics-caitlyn-jenner-falls-window-11204588/">taking a tumble</a> might do the trick.</p>
      <p>The great-and-gross Bushtucker trials are also integral to making the show so great – and that includes the annual tradition of force-feeding a famous face something known as vomit fruit.</p>
      <h3>What is vomit fruit?</h3>
      <p>The fruit’s proper name is Morinda citrifolia. Other names for the fruit include the Indian mulberry, noni, starvation fruit and the dog dumpling.</p>

      <p>Not exactly names to get the appetite whet.</p>
      <p>It’s part of the coffee family and is native across Australasia and Southeast Asia.</p>
      <h3>What does it taste like?</h3>
      <p>In what is surely a hollow victory for the celebs on I’m a Celebrity who have to face off against the fruit, it isn’t actually meant to taste like vomit.</p>

      <p>It just smells like it.</p>
      <p>Atlas Obscura has reported how the ‘vomit fruit’ tastes in various stages of ripeness.</p>

      <p>When unripe, the fruit is meant to have a spacy, grassy taste with hints of horseradish and parmesan – which frankly just sounds like a Heston Blumenthal dish.</p>
      <p>When it’s fully ripe, the fruit is thought to taste like a combination of sharp cheese and lemon with hints of vomit.</p>
      <h3>Why do people eat ‘vomit fruit’?</h3>
      <p>Like with most odd culinary habits, it all comes down to the suggested health benefits.</p>
      <p>The vomit fruit has long been used in traditional Polynesian ceremonies as it’s believed to help cure aches, cancer, anxiety, addiction and inflammation.</p>
      <p>Shamans are reported to use the fruit to ward off evil, since the smell is that bad.</p>
      <p>Forget the Ghostbusters, call your local vomit fruit vendor.</p>

      <h3>Who’s had to eat it on I’m a Celebrity?</h3>
      <p>This year – so far – <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/im-a-celebrity-star-adele-roberts-uses-the-spirit-of-jane-mcdonald-to-wolf-down-camel-anus-and-vomit-fruit-in-foul-bushtucker-trial-11190226/">Adele Roberts has had to chow down</a> on the questionable culinary dish – but it was worth it to win her <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/im-celebrity-star-adele-roberts-girlfriend-clears-jane-mcdonald-mystery-now-know-11183427/">framed Jane McDonald photo.</a></p>
      <p>She compared the unique flavour to when ‘your dog’s been sick and you have to eat it.’</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/mark-wright/">Mark Wright</a> and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/carol-vorderman/">Carol Vorderman</a> were both picked to eat the fruit in 2016. Mark had to eat a cricket dipped in the fruit, and Carol was treated to a ‘Sicktoria’ sponge.</p>
