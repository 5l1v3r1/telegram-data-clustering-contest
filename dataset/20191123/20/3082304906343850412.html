        <b>Pep Guardiola is concerned about an injury sustained by Sergio Aguero as Manchester City got back to winning ways in the Premier League</b>
      </p>
      <p>Sergio Aguero may have sustained a “bad” injury as Manchester City earned a comeback Premier League win at home to Chelsea, said manager Pep Guardiola.</p>
      <p>City only had 46.74 possession against the in-form Blues, the lowest recorded by a Guardiola side in his 381 top-flight matches as a manager, but they collected a crucial three points.</p>
      <p>N’Golo Kante had given Chelsea a deserved lead by squeezing a clever finish past returning goalkeeper Ederson, but Kevin De Bruyne’s deflected shot levelled the score before Riyad Mahrez curled in what proved the winner.</p>
      <p>City’s comeback, though, was marred by a trio of injuries to key players as Rodri, David Silva and Aguero all had to be substituted during the second half at Etihad Stadium.</p>
      <p>Aguero appeared to be in some discomfort as he hobbled off and Guardiola fears the striker could miss some time for the champions.</p>
      <p>“I think Sergio will be bad, I think so… this feeling, tomorrow [Sunday] we will know,” Guardiola told Sky Sports.</p>
      <p>“We will see tomorrow, the feeling is it is muscular. It is what it is, we have young players and we will try [to cope if Aguero is ruled out].”</p>
      <p>Guardiola later told a news conference: “For Rodri and Silva it’s more tiredness and cramps. Rodri was out for a month and games like today are so demanding.”</p>

      <p>Chelsea had won six Premier League games in a row before suffering defeat away to the champions and Guardiola was full of praise for Frank Lampard’s impressive young side.</p>
      <p>“After we conceded the goal, we suffered a little bit and in the best moment we had we scored from Kevin,” Guardiola added to Sky. “After, we missed a lot of chances and the position for the last pass.</p>
      <p>“Second half we controlled it. We lost some balls in a difficult position. They are masters to read the pass and to read the interception. [Chelsea] are a top side but we fought a lot.</p>
      <p>“We adjusted some things, we had some problems from them, and we controlled better [in the second half] apart from the last minutes. [We were] tired, [had] injuries and we suffered.</p>
      <p>“They are so good, they are an incredible team. It’s Chelsea. When you see in the last 20 years, Chelsea aren’t a bad side. The last six or seven years City won more titles but before that it was Manchester United and Chelsea – they were the best.</p>
      <p>“Before teams [were] just defending and use the counter-attack, now teams have the courage to use young managers, they have players with spirit, nothing to lose and they go forward, play football that is nice.</p>
      <p>“You can see the top teams are all playing incredibly well. Leicester, Liverpool, our team, Chelsea.”</p>
