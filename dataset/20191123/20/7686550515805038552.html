      <h1>The lovely way a little boy is being remembered by his family who are finally celebrating Christmas again</h1>
      <h2>Paul Adamson has now raised hundreds of thousands of pounds in memory of his son Jamie</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T20:24:54+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 20:24</time> by <a rel="author">Bronte Howard</a></address>
      <p>Jamie Adamson was born on December 25 but his death when he was just five-years-old meant his family stopped celebrating Christmas.</p>
      <p>Jamie was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) when he was three and died two years later on January 13, 2004.</p>
      <p>After Jamie died, his older brother Sam, who was 11 at the time, decided he didn't want to celebrate Christmas again.</p>
      <p>"Because Jamie's birthday was Christmas Day Sam decided he didn't want to celebrate it without Jamie," said dad Paul.</p>
      <p>"We tried a few times when he was older but it was never the same. He just didn't want to have Christmas. It was heartbreaking as a parent.</p>
      <p>"It wasn't until he got older and went on to have his own daughter that Christmas returned for him. He now has a reason to be happy because he has his daughter to celebrate with."</p>

      <p>Paul, from Barry, said that while Jamie was battling cancer and the family were spending their free time going between their home in Barry and the hospital, he feared that Sam felt neglected.</p>
      <p>“Sam was very understanding when Jamie was ill even though he was devastated," he said.</p>
      <p>“At the time our main priority was Jamie and you see that with a lot of families who have a poorly child. It’s hard to balance everything in your life and you can feel like you’re failing as a parent for putting all of your energy into making sure one child is ok.</p>
      <p>“I think a lot of siblings feel like that because, during that time, they aren’t a priority. It must be an awful feeling to have.</p>
      <p>“That’s why with the work I have done I have made sure that siblings are made to feel important. We do our best to try and help the children who are ill and I believe that’s where the money needs to go, but it's nice to put a smile on the faces of the brothers and sisters.”</p>

      <p>Since Jamie's death, Paul has gone on to raise hundreds of thousands of pounds for charities, children's hospitals and children with cancer.</p>
      <p>As Christmas Day - and what would have been Jamie's 21st birthday - approaches, Paul organised a Christmas party for ill children and their families.</p>
      <p>Paul, now a grandfather, said: "When Jamie was first diagnosed we had hope, but as things got worse, it was just unbearable. Watching him go through what he went through was heartbreaking and you feel completely hopeless.</p>
      <p>"As a parent, your instincts are to protect your child but all you can do is have faith in the doctors and the hospital staff.</p>
      <p>"He underwent treatment, he lost his hair and was very tired and in pain, but he put on a brave face and then he went into remission.</p>
      <p>"But then in December 2003 he relapsed. We knew something was wrong and they were doing all sorts of test and on December 23, they found it.</p>
      <p>“He started treatment again at Llandough Hospital on Christmas Eve 2003 and on Christmas Day, which was his fifth birthday, he was transferred to the high dependency ward at the Heath because his heart was failing.</p>
      <p>"He fought so hard and was so brave but on January 13, 2004, he slipped into a coma and we were told he had meningitis. His immune system had been weakened from the drugs and his body couldn't cope.</p>
      <p>"He was supposed to be transferred to Noah's Ark which at the time had just opened but he didn't make it. He died on January 20, 2004, shortly after his fifth birthday."</p>

      <p>Paul said that despite everything he went through, Jamie had a great sense of humour and was happy.</p>
      <p>"My favourite photo of him is him on his new bike on Christmas Day 2002, his fourth birthday.</p>
      <p>“He was going through a heavy bout of chemotherapy but he still managed to smile and that's something you see in a lot of children.</p>
      <p>“After eight hours of chemotherapy he would ask me to take him out on his bike when we got home.”</p>

      <p>As Jamie’s sixth birthday and the first anniversary of his death got closer, Paul decided to set up his charity Jam Fund, which stands for Jamie Adamson Memorial Fund.</p>
      <p>Initially, Paul set a target of £4,000 but to date, he has raised more than £430,000.</p>
      <p>“The first year I was just getting by. I don’t remember a great deal from the time and I know my family was suffering.</p>
      <p>"But it got closer to the year anniversary I knew I had to change.</p>
      <p>“I decided I had to start living again and I had to do something in Jamie’s memory so I set up the JAM Fund. I just needed something to focus on and I needed to do something to keep Jamie’s name going.</p>
      <p>“It started as something small. I never thought we would get where we would today.</p>
      <p>“It puts a smile on my face that Jamie’s death wasn’t for nothing and that so many children have benefited from the money raised.</p>
      <p>“I do all of it while working full-time and you should see the spare room that has become the office. I’m surprised my wife Denise puts up with it."</p>

      <p>Most of the money donated comes from fundraisers who take part in the <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/cardiff-half-marathon">Cardiff Half Marathon</a> and this year, the Jam Fund had its biggest team yet.</p>
      <p>So far, Paul has donated £15,000 to Latch Welsh Children’s Cancer Charity at the University <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/university-hospital-of-wales">Hospital of Wales</a> and a further £15,000 for medical equipment not in the hospital budget. He has also given £15,000 to Great Ormond Street in London, £28,000 to Martin House Hospice in Yorkshire and £17,000 to Leeds General Infirmary.</p>
      <p>Along with donations to hospitals, Paul’s fundraising has helped six children travel to the USA for treatment and almost £200,000 has been given to children throughout the UK for holidays, presents, medical expenses and treatments that aren’t available on the NHS.</p>
      <p>The party for ill children and their families was held at the Norwegian Church in <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/cardiff-bay">Cardiff Bay</a> on Saturday, November 23.</p>

      <p>“I know how difficult Christmas can be for families who have an ill child and I wanted to do something that will just put a smile on their faces.</p>
      <p>“We had Santa there giving out presents to the children and their siblings.</p>
      <p>“We raised £14,000 in this year’s Cardiff Half and that money was used for the Christmas party.</p>
      <p>“Some of the money from the race will also be going to the University Hospital of Wales. I’ll never be able to repay the staff there who helped Jamie, but I hope doing this in his legacy is a start.”</p>
