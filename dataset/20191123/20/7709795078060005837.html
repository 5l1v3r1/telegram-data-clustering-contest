      <p>Roberto Firmino grabs vital late winner! | Crystal Palace 1-2 Liverpool | Premier League Highlights</p>
      <p>Liverpool need more help from VAR to ensure another victory on the road, as they continued their incredible record of never losing when Sadio Mane gets on the scoresheet.</p>
      <p>Roberto Firmino struck five minutes from time to hand Premier League leaders Liverpool a 2-1 win at Crystal Palace.</p>
      <p>Wilfried Zaha had levelled in the 82nd minute for the hosts with his first goal of the season after Sadio Mane's opener, but Jurgen Klopp's men showed more resolve to extend their unbeaten run in the division to 30 games.</p>
      <p>Roy Hodgson thought his side had taken the lead when James Tomkins headed home at the end of the first half, but VAR ruled out the effort and despite a late rally they suffered a third straight defeat.</p>

      <p>Jose Mourinho wins his first game in charge | West Ham 2-3 Tottenham | Premier League Highlights</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <a href="https://www.sportinglife.com/football/news/mourinho-earns-first-spurs-win/174352">Full report here</a>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Jose Mourinho's return to football management got off to a dream start as his first game in charge of Tottenham saw them win 3-2 at West Ham.</p>
      <p>Mourinho's 11-month absence from the game ended this week when he replaced Mauricio Pochettino on Wednesday and he needed only three days to lift Spurs' misfiring stars.</p>
      <p>First-half goals from Son Heung-min and Lucas Moura - both incisive attacks - were added to by Harry Kane's header after the break as Tottenham won away in the Premier League for the first time in 308 days, even though late goals from Michail Antonio and Angelo Ogbonna skewed the scoreline.</p>
      <p>It extended the 56-year-old's incredible record of not losing a first game in charge of a club since his first job as Benfica's manager way back in 2000.</p>

      <p>Man City rally to beat Chelsea | Manchester City 2-1 Chelsea | Premier League Highlights</p>
      <p>Manchester City came from behind to keep themselves within nine points of Premier League leaders Liverpool with a hard-fought 2-1 win over Chelsea.</p>
      <p>All the goals in an open contest at the Etihad Stadium came in the first half as the champions responded to N'Golo Kante's early strike with goals from Kevin De Bruyne and Riyad Mahrez.</p>
      <p>Raheem Sterling thought he had added a late third for City but his injury-time strike was ruled out for offside in a very tight VAR call.</p>
      <p>Sergio Aguero hit the woodwork before the break but the game ended with concern for City's record goalscorer after he hobbled off 13 minutes from time.</p>
      <p>City spurned a number of chances to kill off the game in the second half but the Londoners could not get back into the game and were leapfrogged in the table by the hosts, who moved third.</p>
      <h3>Arsenal 2-2 Southampton</h3>

      <p>Arsenal scrape a draw at Southampton! | Arsenal 2-2 Southampton | Premier League Highlights</p>
      <p>Alexandre Lacazette rescued an injury-time point for Arsenal at home to struggling Southampton - but the result will do little to ease the pressure on head coach Unai Emery.</p>
      <p>The Gunners boss was given public backing by the club's hierarchy during the international break but he was reliant on a Lacazette brace to twice bring his side from behind to earn a 2-2 draw.</p>
      <p>The south-coast side have not won a league game at Arsenal since 1987 but looked on course to end that run as James Ward-Prowse tapped home after having a penalty saved by Leno, cancelling out Lacazette's first following Danny Ings' opener for the visitors.</p>
      <p>Arsenal are now winless in six games across all competitions and have celebrated victory in just two of their last 11 Premier League games.</p>
      <p>For Ralph Hasenhuttl's side, this would have been a much-needed morale boost but they have not won in the league since September 14.</p>
      <p>While bitter rivals Tottenham celebrated victory at West Ham earlier in the day having opted to sack Mauricio Pochettino and replace him with Jose Mourinho, Arsenal put in another mediocre display.</p>
      <p>The club may have stuck by Emery but the jeers which greeted the full-time whistle suggests the majority of supporters may soon be calling for a change.</p>

      <p>Vardy sets up Perez for Leicester win! | Brighton 0-2 Leicester | Premier League Highlights</p>
      <p>Leicester made it six straight wins in all competitions and seven wins from their last eight in the Premier League with a hard fought 2-0 victory at Brighton.</p>
      <p>Jamie Vardy continued his scoring streak as he bagged his 12th goal of the season at the second attempt from the penalty spot as Leicester moved three points clear of Chelsea, ahead of their clash with Manchester City.</p>
      <p>Vardy, the top-flight's leading goalscorer, also played a role in Ayoze Perez's 64th-minute opener, as the Foxes secured their sixth successive victory in all competitions.</p>
      <p>Leicester had dominated throughout the first half, with 11 shots to Brighton's one, but had been unable to make the most of their chances, before a quick counter-attack in the 64th minute following a Brighton corner, when Vardy played the ball through to Perez, who tapped home.</p>
      <p>The game was not without its moments of VAR controversy however, when referee Mike Dean awarded a Leicester penalty in the 80th minute, before the technology was used twice in quick succession.</p>
      <p>Vardy stepped up to take the penalty following the review, but his effort was saved and James Maddison nodded in the rebound.</p>
      <p>VAR then intervened for a second time, and the decision was taken to retake the penalty, and Vardy made no mistakes from his second attempt, firing the ball past Mathew Ryan to bring Brighton's streak of three successive home victories to an end.</p>

      <p>Wolves capitalise on superb Moutinho free-kick | Bournemouth 1-2 Wolves | Premier League Highlights</p>
      <p>Raul Jimenez continued his red-hot scoring streak as in-form Wolves made it eight Premier League games unbeaten with a 2-1 success at 10-man Bournemouth.</p>
      <p>Mexico striker Jimenez claimed his sixth goal in seven games to double Wanderers' lead after Joao Moutinho opened the scoring at the Vitality Stadium with a superb free-kick.</p>
      <p>Bournemouth, who played 53 minutes a man down after captain Simon Francis was sent off on his first top-flight start for 11 months, pulled one back in the second period through Steve Cook but were unable to salvage a point.</p>
      <p>Victory for Nuno Espirito Santo's visitors lifts them to fifth place in the table ahead of Thursday's Europa League game at Braga, while the hosts drop to 11th after just one win from seven league fixtures.</p>

      <h3>Everton 0-2 Norwich</h3>

      <p>Norwich get back to winning ways! | Everton 0-2 Norwich | Premier League Highlights</p>
      <p>Norwich hauled themselves off the bottom of the Premier League table with their first away win of the season to pile the pressure back on Everton manager Marco Silva.</p>
      <p>After a goalless 10 hours and 20 minutes on the road, Todd Cantwell's first strike since the Canaries' last league success - at home to Manchester City in September - and an added-time effort from Dennis Srbeny, secured a 2-0 victory.</p>
      <p>It lifted Daniel Farke's side to within a point of escaping the bottom three and left Everton just four points above the relegation zone after a sixth defeat in nine league games.</p>
      <p>So, while Norwich are looking up, Silva is looking over his shoulder as seven of their next nine matches are against tough opponents in second-placed Leicester (twice), Liverpool, Chelsea, Manchester United, Arsenal and Manchester City.</p>
      <p>It is the month from hell for Silva but Saturday afternoon was not much fun either as Everton's lack of ambition against a team who had taken one point from their last seven matches, cost them dearly.</p>

      <p>Burnley clinch their first away win of the season! | Watford 0-3 Burnley | Premier League Highlights</p>
      <p>Chris Wood, Ashley Barnes and James Tarkowski sent Watford bottom of the Premier League as Burnley bruised their way to a 3-0 victory at Vicarage Road.</p>
      <p>Wood's snap finish, Barnes' penalty and Tarkowski's late strike condemned struggling Watford to a club-record 11th straight home league match without a win.</p>
      <p>Barnes' penalty was awarded after a VAR check, with Jose Holebas judged to have brought the 30-year-old down in the area.</p>
      <p>The former Brighton forward then put away the spot-kick he had won, securing a win to send Burnley sixth in the table - and Watford bottom.</p>
      <p>Tarkowski's late goal twisted the knife on Watford's wounds, the Hornets' chief tormentor ending an error-strewn, aggressive afternoon with the last laugh.</p>
      <p>While Burnley were left to toast a fifth win for the term, Quique Sanchez Flores' stunned Watford could only limp away, as Norwich's win and Southampton's draw sent them bottom.</p>
      <p>Burnley's delirious fans chanted "anti-football" to their hearts' content as Sean Dyche's men pulled off another smash-and-grab victory, leaving Watford floored both on the pitch and in the table.</p>
