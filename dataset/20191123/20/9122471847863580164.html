      <h1>Update On The Student Protest At Harvard-Yale Game</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T20:06:56+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 20:06</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/danlyons" target="_blank">Dan Lyons</a></address>
      <p>Harvard and Yale share one of the most historic rivalries in college football, and the defining game of the Ivy League. Today, a group of students used that stage <a href="https://thespun.com/college-football/video-huge-protest-breaks-out-on-field-of-harvard-yale-game">to protest climate change</a>.</p>
      <p>A large group of students staged a sit-in at midfield in the middle of the game. The group had signs calling the two schools “complicit” in issues facing our environment.</p>
      <p>For a while, the breadth of the protest looked like it might threaten the end of the game. Now, things are back underway.</p>
      <p>ESPN’s Matt Barrie reports that protestors demanded to be arrested, and have been taken off of the field tied together in pairs.</p>

      <p>This isn’t the first strange delay we’ve seen during Harvard-Yale over the last few years. This one was probably for better reasons, though.</p>
      <p><a href="https://thespun.com/college-football/yale-students-strip-naked-delay-the-game-harvard-saybrook">In 2016</a>, the game was delayed after a group of Yale students in the front row of the game stripped naked and stood on the wall above the field.</p>
      <p>After that touchdown following the protest, Harvard has a 22-3 lead on the road. This would be a pretty big upset in the Ivy League this year.</p>
      <p>Harvard entered the game 4-5, and just 2-4 in League play, while Yale is 8-1 (5-1). Dartmouth has the same record, and is beating Brown 29-23 late in the fourth quarter, so they might win the conference outright today, after being upset by Cornell last week. Dartmouth blew out Yale earlier in the year 42-10.</p>
