      <p>Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Jayant Patil said the party's doors for Ajit Pawar, who was sworn in as the Maharashtra deputy chief minister on Saturday, are open. He also hoped that Ajit Pawar would come back to the party.</p>
      <p>In an exclusive interview to India Today TV, Jayant Patil, the NCP state president and the newly-appointed legislature party chief after Ajit Pawar was sacked, said all the five MLAs who attended the oath-taking ceremony of BJP's Devendra Fadnavis are also welcome in the party.</p>
      <p>Jayant Patil also said that Devendra Fadnavis would not be able to prove majority and his government would collapse.</p>
      <p>"The Devendra Fadnavis-led government would collapse during the floor test. All our MLAs are with us and the remaining five MLAs, who have not contacted us, are also welcome in the party," Jayant Patil said. He said he cannot comprehend why Ajit Pawar supported the BJP in forming the government.</p>
      <p>He said NCP chief Sharad Pawar sent two-three party leaders to speak with Ajit Pawar. "We will not reveal what happened during the talks with Ajit Pawar," Jayant Patil said.</p>
      <p>Asserting that the BJP government would collapse in a matter of a few days, the NCP leader said Shiv Sena-Congress-NCP would form the government in Maharashtra and Uddhav Thackeray would become the chief minister.</p>
