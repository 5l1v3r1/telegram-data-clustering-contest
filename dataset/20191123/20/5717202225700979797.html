      <h1>Everton fans are furious after Marco Silva’s post-game comments</h1>
      <h2>Everton fans were not happy about Marco Silva blaming a lack of pace for the 2-0 defeat to Norwich.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T20:15:22+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 20:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/mathewcoull/" target="_blank">Mathew Nash</a></address>
      <p>It is fair to say that Everton fans were not happy with manager Marco Silva after watching their side lose to Norwich City earlier today. </p>
      <p>The Toffees were poor throughout, losing 2-0 after goals from Todd Cantwell and Dennis Srebeny. It was the manner of the defeat that most frustrated Everton fans and the mood in Goodison Park after the game told the story. </p>
      <p>Everton lacked creativity, pace, mobility and that was not a surprise considering the starting XI. Cenk Tosun and Gylfi Sigurdsson are hardly going to be beating any opponents in a foot race. </p>

      <p>Indeed, Richarlison also looked leggy after his international antics whilst Morgan Schneiderlin has never exuded dynamo qualities in midfield. </p>
      <p>But remarkably, after the game, Marco Silva made a comment which incensed Everton fans on Twitter even more. </p>
      <p>The Portuguese commented on the lack of speed in the side, as shared by Phil Kirkbride of the Liverpool Echo. </p>

      <p>Considering the fact he had the likes of Dominic Calver-Lewin, Alex Iwobi and Moise Kean all on the bench, this comment incensed the Everton fanbase, Even the club’s star youngster Anthony Gordon would have added some spark in attack, but he was not included in the matchday squad. </p>
      <p>As angry as Everton fans were during the game, these comments from Silva appear to have incensed them even more. </p>
      <p>It is looking like a matter of time before Everton are on the hunt for a new manager…</p>
