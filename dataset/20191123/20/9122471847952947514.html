      <h1>Justin Fields Injured Late In Fourth Quarter vs. Penn State</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T20:28:39+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 20:28</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matt-admin" target="_blank">Matt Lombardi</a></address>
      <p>Ohio State quarterback Justin Fields suffered some kind of lower leg injury late in the fourth quarter against Penn State. Luckily, it looks like he was able to escape without anything serious.</p>
      <p>Fields, with his team leading 28-17, was forced to scramble on a 4th-and-5 with under three minutes to play. He fumbled the ball and landed awkwardly, staying on the ground for a minute or so before coming off of the field.</p>
      <p>Ohio State fans were concerned that Fields had suffered a serious injury, but he eventually walked off the field under his own power. Once he got to the sideline, it seemed like he had just been shaken up.</p>
      <p>Video shows Fields stumbling a few times as he falls to the ground. He lands awkwardly, but it doesn’t look like his knee or ankle buckles anywhere.</p>

      <p>Ohio State wound up winning the contest 28-17 and clinching the Big Ten East. The Buckeyes next get Michigan before the Big Ten title game – likely against either Minnesota or Wisconsin.</p>
      <p>Fields finished the game 16-of-22 for 188 yards with two touchdowns. He also added 68 yards on the ground.</p>
      <p><b>Update:</b> Head coach Ryan Day says he thinks Fields is “alright” – adding that he’s a “tough kid.” It seems like the Buckeyes dodged a bullet.</p>
      <p>We’ll keep you updated on Fields’ condition. Hopefully he’s good to go for the showdown with the Wolverines.</p>
