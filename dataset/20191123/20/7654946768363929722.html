      <p>Vice President Mike Pence and his wife, Karen, traveled to Iraq on Saturday for a surprise pre-Thanksgiving visit to US troops.</p>
      <p>The second lady, toting a container of candied yams, and the veep, balancing a platter of roasted turkey, <a href="https://twitter.com/thehill/status/1198262497352044544">served lunch to 150 service members</a> stationed at Al Asad Air Base in western Iraq.</p>
      <p>“It’s Thanksgiving week in America and Karen and I couldn’t be more honored and privileged to come here and give you a little bit of a taste of home,” Pence said.</p>
      <p>Pence had a private briefing with military officials and then made a phone call to Iraqi Prime Minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi.</p>

      <p>President Trump made a similar unannounced visit to troops at the base last Christmas, his first trip to Iraq.</p>
      <p>After his lunch with the troops, Pence stopped off in Erbil in northern Iraq for a meeting with Nechirvan Barzani, the president of its Kurdistan region.</p>
      <p>Praising the “enduring bond that exists between the Kurdish people and the people of the United States,” Pence said that he “welcomed the opportunity on behalf of President Donald Trump to reiterate the strong bonds forged in the fires of war.”</p>
      <p>Trump has come under fire for pulling troops out of Kurdish-held territory in northern Syria. The area was promptly invaded by Turkey, a NATO ally of the US.</p>
      <p>Barzani told Pence that he hopes the Kurds’ relationship with Trump “will continue to develop further,” Politico reported.</p>
