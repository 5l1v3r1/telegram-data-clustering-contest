      <p><b>ISLAMABAD: </b>JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman telephoned on Saturday PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and PML-N’s Ahsan Iqbal to discuss the opposition’s anti-government strategy, <i>The Express Tribune</i> has learnt.</p>
      <p>According to sources privy to the development, opposition leaders have decided to convene an All Parties Conference (APC) on November 26 to mull a future course of action against the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf-led government.</p>
      <p>The decision to call the APC was taken by the Rehbar Committee, a conglomerate of nine opposition parties, the sources said, adding that the JUI-F chief will also invite parties other than PPP and PML-N to attend the huddle.</p>
      <p>The JUI-F, earlier this month, wrapped up his 13-day-long sit-in dubbed as ‘Azadi March’ in Islamabad and announced to block the major thoroughfares across the country as part of his party ‘Plan-B.’</p>
      <p>Later, road blockades and sit-ins in various parts of the country were called off, saying the blockades were causing “inconvenience to the public”.</p>
