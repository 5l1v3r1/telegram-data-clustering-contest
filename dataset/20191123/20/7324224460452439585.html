      <p>Wolves midfielder Joao Moutinho has signed a new contact with the club until 2022.</p>
      <p>The Portuguese, who joined Wolves upon promotion to the Premier League in 2018, has made 66 appearances for the club and scored in the 2-1 win at Bournemouth on Saturday.</p>
      <p>“It was a very easy decision because I feel very good here,” Moutinho told the official Wolves website.</p>
      <p>“It’s a big club that wants to do something good and I want to do my best to help.</p>
      <p>“We did a great job last season and this season we’ll try to do better.</p>
      <p>“That’s what we’re going to do and I’m going to try 100 per cent to help the club to improve.</p>
      <p>“I feel very good. We won today, a very important win, and I signed a new contract.</p>
      <p>“I’m very happy to help the team today and I hope to help for the new two, three years.”</p>
      <p>Moutinho began his career at Sporting Lisbon before moving on to Porto and Monaco.</p>
      <p>The 33-year-old, who has won over 100 caps for his country and helped Portugal to Euro 2016 glory, has featured in every Premier League fixture since moving to Molineux.</p>
      <p>Wolves sporting director Kevin Thelwell said: “It’s terrific news. In the time he’s been here, everyone has been able to see he’s a top player.</p>
      <p>“Top performances on the pitch, top professionalism off the pitch. He has an amazing mentality and has made a really big impression on everyone at the football club.”</p>
