      <p><i>Servant</i> follows Dorothy (Lauren Ambrose) and Sean Turner (<a href="https://screenrant.com/toby-kebbell-fantastic-four-doctor-doom-real-actor/amp/">Toby Kebbell</a>) as they hire a nanny for their newborn. But because this is Shyamalan, it's no ordinary child. In fact, it's not a child at all. With their real child deceased, Dorothy takes in a life-like doll to help her deal with the trauma. What could go wrong?</p>
