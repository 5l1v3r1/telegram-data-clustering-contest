      <p>Raul Sanllehi and Edu reportedly looked furious following Arsenal's 2-2 draw with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/southampton-fc">Southampton.</a></p>
      <p>The Gunners were shocking against the relegation-threatened Saints, with Alexandre Lacazette rescuing them a point with one of the final kicks of the game, deep into stoppage time at the Emirates.</p>
      <p>Unai Emery is under intense pressure to turn things around, and admitted it is his sole responsibility to get the Gunners firing once more.</p>
      <p>"The club are supporting me every day and also I have a responsibility," said the Spaniard after the game. "I know I can do better, I can take more performances with the players and I'm going to try to do that. Now my job is to analyse, to try to move on with confidence with the players.</p>

      <p>"It's difficult but we need to move on in the next days. After analysing that match we are going to play at home again on Thursday, prepare as well as possible.</p>
      <p>"We know, and I know, that we need to connect with our supporters."</p>

      <p>Emery received backing from Sanllehi and managing director Vinai Venkatesham ahead of the international break, but stressed they are looking to see improvements.</p>
      <p>"We are as disappointed as everyone else with both our results and performances at this stage of the season," the statement read.</p>

      <p>"We share the frustration with our fans, Unai, players and all our staff as they are not at the level we want or expect.</p>
      <p>"Things need to improve to meet our objectives for the season and we firmly believe Unai is the right man for the job."</p>
