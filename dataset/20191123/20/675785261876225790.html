      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: Tom Jones is in regular contact with the 86-year-old Lucille star and, although a hip op has left him nearly bedridden, he's in fine spirits</h2>

      <p>When music legend Little Richard has a whole lotta achin’ going on he knows just what to do to ease it.</p>
      <p>The 86-year-old star loves chatting to one of his biggest fans – Sir Tom Jones – and singing to him down the phone.</p>
      <p>The Voice judge revealed Little Richard’s bizarre therapy was not so much Rip It Up as hip it up as he tries to take his mind off a broken joint.</p>
      <p>He said the godfather of rock ’n’ roll, who hasn’t performed for six years, is “not so well” physically but is still in fine voice.</p>
      <p>“He busted his hip and it hasn’t fixed properly so I went to see him in Tennessee,” says Sir Tom, 79.</p>

      <p>“I’ve called him up from time to time to ask how he is. He sang Strange Things Happening Every Day on the phone. It sounded great.</p>
      <p>"I told him I always finish my show with that song and he told whoever was in the room, ‘Oh my soul. Tom Jones does that song every night’.”</p>

      <p>Sir Tom is now working on an album to mark his 80th birthday next year. He says: “I am looking into meaningful songs.</p>
      <p>"They are covers, but interesting as I’ve got a big birthday coming up.</p>
      <p>“It’s about time that I got some good songs in that are good for my age now rather than trying to be something I was 50 years ago.”</p>
