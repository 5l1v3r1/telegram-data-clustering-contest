      <p>WEST BROM AND Leeds both left it late as they moved clear of the pack at the top of the Championship on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The Baggies were 2-1 winners over Sheffield Wednesday thanks to an 88th-minute penalty, while a last-minute own goal gave Leeds a 2-1 win at Luton.</p>
      <p>With Preston losing at Derby, West Brom are top on 36 points and Leeds second on 34 as Preston sit third on 31 points.</p>
      <p>Charlie Austin’s penalty was the clincher for the leaders after Hal Robson-Kanu’s opener for West Brom was cancelled out by Steven Fletcher’s penalty. Liam Palmer was sent off for Wednesday in time added on.</p>
      <p>At Luton, Patrick Bamford’s goal for Leeds was cancelled out by James Collins, with James Pearson then putting through his own goal to give Marcelo Bielsa’s men a win.</p>
      <p>Brentford’s rise up the table continued, with Ollie Watkins scoring the only goal as they beat Reading 1-0, while Martyn Waghorn’s strike was enough for Derby to see off Preston.</p>
      <p>Jed Wallace scored the only goal in a 1-0 Millwall win at Swansea, while Ryan Yates was sent off as Nottingham Forest drew 0-0 at Bristol City.</p>
      <p>Marc Roberts earned Birmingham a point as they drew 1-1 at Huddersfield, for whom Fraizer Campbell had opened the scoring.</p>
      <p>Michael O’Neill’s first home game in charge of Stoke ended in a second win thanks to Mame Biram Diouf’s stoppage-time goal in a 2-1 victory over Wigan.</p>
      <p>Bradley Dack scored a winner for Blackburn four minutes from time as Gerhard Struber’s first game in charge of Barnsley ended with a 3-2 defeat.</p>
