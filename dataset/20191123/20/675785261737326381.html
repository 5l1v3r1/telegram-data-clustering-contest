      <h1>'Smitten' Nicole Scherzinger wants to spend Christmas with X Factor's Thom Evans</h1>
      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: The Pussycat Dolls star has told friends that she is "smitten" with the 34-year-old sportsman - and a source says they have “hit it off” after several hook-ups</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T20:54:22+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 20:54</time> by <a rel="author">Halina Watts, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/halina-watts/</a></address>
      <p>X Factor judge Nicole Scherzinger tells pals she is “smitten” with hopeful Thom Evans – and could spend Christmas with him.</p>
      <p>I hear she has met Rugby player Thom, 34 – who is one third of band Try Star on the ITV contest – twice after rehearsals.</p>
      <p>And he previously told me he had the hots for 41-year-old Nicole.</p>
      <p>Initially I thought last week’s reported first date was a ruse to pull in more viewers.</p>
      <p>But my source reckons they have “hit it off” after further hook-ups.</p>
      <p>Now Nicole – who split from tennis ace Grigor Dimitrov this year – is weighing up whether or not to spend the festive period in England.</p>

      <p>A source tells me: “It’s really early days but they have spent a lot of time together this week. On two separate evenings they hung out and have been getting on well.</p>
      <p>“Nicole thinks Thom is gorgeous and a real gentleman, he obviously can’t believe his luck.”</p>
      <p>But they’ve told each other “long distance won’t work”.</p>
      <p>The source adds: “If Nicole returns to LA the romance is off, she’s done long distance before and she doesn’t want to do it again.</p>
      <p>“But there might be more work on the horizon in England next month, which means they get more time.”</p>
      <p>Nic was judging Thom on last night’s show with it being highly likely he would be booted off. How very awkward.</p>
