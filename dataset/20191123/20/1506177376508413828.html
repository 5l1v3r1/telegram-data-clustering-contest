      <p>Leading Cypriot airline Cyprus Airways has announced new flights connecting travellers from Larnaca to Greece for Summer 2020!</p>
      <p>“Cyprus Airways places particular emphasis on the Greek market,” Cyprus Airways’ sales manager for Eastern Europe, Cyprus, and Greece, Marilyn Constantinou, said while presenting the airline to Greek travel agents during an event in Athens.</p>
      <p>The airline’s summer 2020 flight schedule from Larnaca Airport will include flights to Rhodes, Skiathos, Preveza (new), Santorini (new), Corfu (new) and also to Zurich, Geneva, Verona, Cairo, Bratislava, and Kosice.</p>
      <p>“We are going beyond our point to point network from Larnaca and will expand from the Greek market to other European markets,” Constantinou said.</p>
      <p>In summer 2020, the airline will fly from Bratislava direct to Rhodes and Corfu. A weekly connection will also launch between Kosice and Corfu.</p>
      <p>“Our main aim is to connect Tel Aviv with the Greek market in the future,” she added.</p>
      <p>The new routes announced will be added to the existing network of Cyprus Airways. The company already operates from Larnaca, on a weekly basis, 10 weekly flights to Athens, two flights to Thessaloniki and Heraklion, Crete, as well as six flights to Tel Aviv and two flights to Beirut and Prague.</p>
      <p>As of December 21, Cyprus Airways will also connect Athens to the city of Paphos three times a week.</p>
