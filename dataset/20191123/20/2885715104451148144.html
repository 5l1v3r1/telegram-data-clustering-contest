      <p>Union Minister for Housing and Urban Affairs Hardeep Singh Puri Saturday said the process of regularising unauthorised colonies in the capital will be completed within three months, with the DDA set to launch a portal enabling people to file applications for ownership rights on December 16.</p>
      <p>The announcement comes days after Chief Minister <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/arvind-kejriwal">Arvind Kejriwal</a> said the AAP will launch a mass movement over continued uncertainty on regularisation of these colonies. On Wednesday, the Union Cabinet had cleared a bill on the same, which is likely to be tabled during the ongoing Winter Session of Parliament.</p>
      <p>“Within a three-month period, we will create the ecosystem required for conferment of rights to all 40 lakh citizens living in these 1,797 colonies. The process is being supervised at the highest level of government. This is a one-time exception for these 40 lakh citizens,” said Puri. He was speaking at the launch of a dedicated portal, which will allow the RWAs in such colonies to vet delineated maps. A second portal for people to apply will be launched on December 16.</p>
      <p>The RWAs will get a 15-day window to flag issues and share suggestions. “On December 16, the second portal for application of ownership grants would be launched. Using that portal, residents will first register, then file their application along with required documents,” said DDA vice-chairman Tarun Kapoor.</p>
      <p>The documents that will be accepted for this one-time registration process are General Power of Attorney, will transfers, sale agreement, and possession and payment receipts. Puri said: “As per the Suraj Lamp &amp; Industries Pvt Ltd vs State of Haryana judgment of the Supreme Court given on October 11, 2011, these documents were declared as void… But we are making an exception this time, and will accept two-three of five of these documents. If it is found that 10-15% of people do not have these documents, then we will deal with it structurally.”</p>
      <p>Around 25-30 help desks for residents will also be set up at DDA offices from December 1, for help with online registration. Puri added: “For the past two-and-a-half years, we received no cooperation from the Delhi government on this. At every stage they have put obstacles…”</p>
