      <p><b>YOUNGSTOWN, OhioÂ (AP)</b> - Joe Alessi ran for 103 yards and the Youngstown State defense shut down Illinois State for a 21-3 upset over the FCS sixth-ranked Redbirds on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Braxton Chapman and Joe Craycraft completed 12-play drives with short touchdown runs and Zaire Jones returned an interception for 30 yards and a score for the Penguins (6-6, 2-6), who snapped a three-game losing streak in their season finale and perhaps ensured that the Redbirds (8-4, 5-3) will not receive a first-round bye for the playoffs.</p>
      <p>Both teams committed three turnovers, but Illinois State managed only 142 yards total offense and were 0 for 12 on third-down conversions. Two Redbirds quarterbacks were 3-of-16 passing for 30 yards. The Penguins had only 83 yards passing but 187 on the ground.</p>
      <p>On the final play of the game, Youngstown senior quarterback Nate Mays, who was knocked out for the season against North Dakota State on Nov. 2 with a leg injury, was helped out onto the field to take the snap and take a knee.</p>
