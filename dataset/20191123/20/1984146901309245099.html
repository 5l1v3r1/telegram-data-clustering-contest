      <h1>One-punch victim takes three years to wake from a coma but will be home for Christmas</h1>
      <h2>Stephen Willey, of Washington, is still recovering after being punched by thug Nicholas Graham on December 23 2015</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T20:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 20:00</time> by <a rel="author">Lisa Hutchinson</a></address>
      <p>For three years Stephen Willey lay in a coma after a senseless unprovoked one-punch attack.</p>
      <p>It was on December 23 2015 when he was floored in the assault in Newcastle and his family waited by his bedside until January 2019 for him to wake up.</p>
      <p>It means he’s missed the past four <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/christmas">Christmases</a> as his loving family prayed and hoped.</p>
      <p>But this year will be extra special as he’ll be sitting at the festive table for the first time since the near fatal punch took place.</p>

      <p>And his parents Linda and David, doting wife Paula, brothers Neil and Chris, and his sister-in-laws Andrea and Kathryn are delighted that he is progressing slowly by surely.</p>
      <p>"We’ll be having Christmas dinner at Neil and Kathryn’s this year, if Kathryn can get the time off work, because they have more space than us. But if not we will be having it here at our house and Stephen will be at the table having Christmas dinner.</p>
      <p>"He’ll be having turkey and all the trimmings but it will be liquidised for him. It will be our first Christmas after he fully emerged from his coma and we are all looking forward to it," said dad David, 72, of Washington.</p>
      <p>Their nightmare happened after devoted Stephen went into <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-upon-tyne">Newcastle</a> two days before Christmas 2015 to meet his wife, childhood sweetheart Paula, after she had been out for a festive meal with work colleagues.</p>
      <p>The couple, from <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/washington">Washington</a>, were standing at a bus stop on New Bridge Street just after 8pm when they had the misfortune of crossing paths with thug Nicholas Graham, who was angry following a row with his ex.</p>

      <p>Graham, described by one witness as like a "raging bull", barged into Stephen for no reason, then swung a ferocious punch which knocked him to the ground, fracturing his skull and causing serious brain injuries.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/nissan">Nissan</a> worker Stephen, 49, lay in a coma for three years and is now working hard to learn how to talk and hopefully eventually walk again.</p>
      <p>Following the attack, Stephen was taken to hospital, where he had emergency surgery. He has since spent his time in <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/walkergate">Walkergate Park Centre</a> For Neurorehabilitation and Neuropsychiatry in Newcastle and Northview Lodge in Castletown, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/sunderland">Sunderland.</a></p>
      <p>Maintenance engineer Graham, 30, of Belsay Gardens, Red House Farm, Newcastle, pleaded guilty to causing grievous bodily harm and breaching the restraining order to stay away from the former girlfriend. He was also in breach of previously imposed community orders.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>He was jailed for three-and-a-half years.</p>
      <p>But it is the Willeys who received a much worse punishment.</p>
      <p>Dad David added: "He got three-and-a-half years and was out in 17 months, we got the real punishment. When you look at Stephen you can’t believe this happened to him.</p>
      <p>"Paula and Linda are at Northview six days a week seeing him. They get one day off a week and we all go but everyday there is someone there. Paula is so caring, he’s got a good one there in Paula.</p>
      <p>"This year will be the first Christmas he’s been awake from his coma. Paula will be buying him Christmas presents, she’s looking quite excited. She’s always buying him clothes as she likes him to look smart in his chair, she’s so kind.</p>

      <p>"But this will be quite a special year when we all sit around the table."</p>
      <p>Stephen is now eating three liquidised meals a day, along with a couple of mousses and a coffee with a thickening agent in it.</p>
      <p>"We keep saying we’ll be getting him a bottle of wine soon and he smiles," added David.</p>
      <p>Stephen, was a keen cyclist and would ride around five times a week, regularly doing 100 miles on a Sunday.</p>
      <p>He now needs 24-hour care and has a cycling machine that he uses as he tries to rebuild his strength.</p>

      <p>David added: "He can’t stand up and has to be hoisted from his chair and his bed every day. But he knows what we are saying and we can tell what he’s saying in his own way.</p>
      <p>"He can be funny as well. He knows his twin nieces, Lucy and Emily, who are nine months old. He’ll sit with one of them in his arms and he can say their names.</p>
      <p>"We hope he will be able to speak again and hopefully stand up. But not even the top neurosurgeons can tell us what is going to happen. We just hope he will."</p>
      <p>At <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-crown-court">Newcastle Crown Court</a> in May 2016, as Graham was jailed, Paula told of the devastating consequences of the attack in a statement read to the court.</p>
      <p>She said they were waiting for their bus when they became aware of Graham.</p>
      <p>Paula said: "The look on his face and what happened next will haunt me for the rest of my life.</p>
      <p>"He pushed me out of the way and the next thing I saw was Stephen falling flat to the ground, then I heard the horrific crack when his head hit the pavement."</p>

        <figcaption>Wedding day of Stephen and Paula Willey in New York</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Paula and Stephen were childhood sweethearts and have been together for 31 years.</p>
      <p>"I love him so much, I always have and I always will. He is such an amazing person with so much determination," said Paula.</p>
      <p>"After it happened he slowly, slowly moved up the conscious scale and it was on January 17 he was diagnosed that he’d emerged from his coma. It was incredible for us. It was then we could start a rehabilitation programme. It was just amazing.</p>
      <p>"We got him home for Christmas last year but this year it is the first time he will sit at the table and be able to eat a Christmas dinner - but he is on a pureed diet.</p>
      <p>"He’s always loved Christmas, just putting up the decorations and playing the Christmas tunes. I’ve started his Christmas present shopping and I’ve got him t-shirts, trainers, trousers and aftershave. It’s really exciting.</p>
      <p>"Although we’ve been together for 31 years we’ve only been married for six. We got married in New York on July 26 2013 and didn’t tell anyone. We didn’t want any fuss.</p>

      <p>"He’s such an amazing person. He’s having to learn how to do everything again. He’s not ready to walk yet as he hasn’t got the strength in his truck, but he’s getting stronger."</p>
      <p>She added: "The care he received from day one has been amazing, initially in the Royal Victoria Infirmary and Walkergate Park Neuro Rehab. </p>
      <p>"The staff at Northview Lodge care home, where he’s been for last three years, are phenomenal. They played a pivotal part in him emerging from the coma and in his ongoing recovery."</p>
      <p>Paula is wanting to raise awareness about the dangers a one punch attack can do.</p>
      <p>"A one punch attack can be disastrous," said Paula.</p>
      <p>"It's that time of year when people drink more and things can happen.</p>
      <p>"The One Punch North East campaign is raising awareness and people should know what one punch can do. The person that did this to Stephen only got three-and-a-half years and we feel the sentencing should be stronger and longer.</p>
      <p>"He's out now but Stephen still has a long way to go."</p>
