      <p>HACKENSACK, New Jersey -- Rapper and actor <a href="https://abc7ny.com/hip-hop-pioneer-eric-b-released-from-jail-in-new-jersey/5692678/">Eric B. has been sentenced to a year of probation</a> stemming from a 17-year-old criminal charge in New Jersey.</p>
      <p>Eric B., whose real name is Eric Barrier, spent two weeks in the Bergen County jail before his release last week.</p>
      <p>He had been jailed on a bench warrant dating back to 2002 for failure to appear in court.</p>
      <p>He had pleaded guilty earlier that year to assault and eluding police.</p>
      <p>Barrier supposedly contends his former attorney told him he didn't have to show up for sentencing because he'd qualified for a program that allowed him to avoid prison.</p>
      <p>He faced a year in jail back then.</p>
      <p>Eric B. and Rakim are known as one of the greatest hip-hop duos of all time.</p>
