      <p>Mi MIX 3 5G with 8GB RAM and 256GB Storage listed by TENAA<br/>4.4 (88.33%) 12 votes</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/Xiaomi">Xiaomi</a> Mi MIX 3 5G debuted this year as a more powerful 5G variant of the bezel-less smartphone released in 2018. Despite the obvious new 5G connectivity, the new variant came with a more powerful chipset and a bigger battery. According, to the <a href="http://shouji.tenaa.com.cn/mobile/MobileDetail.aspx?code=zDErPbEoeuAUCC2CA9dkLUFAOaQ%2f%2f3DALCCqnCnhqfI%3d">TENAA</a> database this isn’t the end of the line for the Mi MIX 3 5G since a new variant with 8GB of RAM and 256GB was spotted by the Chinese authority.</p>
      <p>When it was released back in February, the handset came in a single configuration with the only 6GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. We all know that this isn’t the standard anymore for flagships. Actually, this amount of RAM and Storage can be found on several midrange devices that got released in 2019. According to TENNA’s listing, there are two different configurations – a 6GB + 128GB version and an 8GB RAM +256GB version. Moreover, the listing also reveals that Android 10 is running these variants, with MIUI 11 probably running atop.</p>

      <p>The Mi MIX 3 5G features a sliding 6.39-inch OLED display with a 2340 x 1080 resolution. It is powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 855 processor and has a 3,800mAh battery with QuickCharge 4+ support. It also supports 10W wireless charging. Moreover, the device has a 24MP selfie snapper which is paired with a 2MP selfie camera. Around the back, there are two 12MP sensors. Those are compelling specs of course, but the new storage/RAM variants will definitely make the Mi MIX 3 5G more attractive.</p>
      <p>We have to wait for more details confirming the new variants. However, there’s a strong chance that they will be exclusive to Xiaomi’s homeland, China.</p>
