      <p>Trans Mountain has ramped up its promotion of the work being done at Burnaby’s Westridge Marine Terminal.</p>
      <p>Construction kick-started again in August and Trans Mountain has been sharing details through a variety of methods, including photos and a recent time-lapse video.</p>
      <p>Now, Trans Mountain is showing off a three-minute-30-second animated film about what’s involved in a project that could take up to three years to finish.</p>
      <p>The video can be seen below, but here are a few highlights from the video:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The video starts by saying that the terminal was built back in 1954 and has been “operating safely” ever since.</li>
        <li>The project will expand the terminal from one berth to three.</li>
        <li>A series of “cells” will be built using 1,900 sheet piles. A “turbidity curtain” will be used to protect marine life during construction.</li>
        <li>A “rockfish reef” will be built to protect rockfish and other marine life.</li>
        <li>160 piles will need to be added, with shrouds and curtains used to try and dampen the noise from the hammers driving the piles into the ground.</li>
        <li>Bubble curtains will be used to try and protect marine life from the underwater noise produced by the pile driving.</li>
        <li>Spotters in boats on the water are supposed to signal the pile driving to stop if marine life such as seals are spotted nearby.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The last part of the video is aimed at saying the project will bring economic prosperity through the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion.</p>
