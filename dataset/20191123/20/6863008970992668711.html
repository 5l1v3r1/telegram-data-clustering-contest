      <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said the Holodomor crime of 1932-1933 is such a great tragedy that mankind has not yet come up with words to describe the pain the Ukrainians experienced.</p>
      <p>"There are pages in our history that are very painful to remember, but impossible to forget. Crimes that prove that cruelty and cynicism have no limits. Griefs that a normal person does not wish even to his enemies. Tragedies that are so great that mankind has not yet come up with words to describe the pain the Ukrainians experienced," he said during mourning events dedicated to the memory of the victims of the Holodomor, according to an UNIAN correspondent.</p>
      <p>Zelensky said today the Ukrainians honor the memory of the victims of the Holodomor, a genocide crime committed by the totalitarian Stalinist regime against the people of Ukraine.</p>
