      <h1>Cardi B Shows Support To T.I. Following His Gyno Controversy With His Daughter: ‘Right Or Wrong, He’s My Brother’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T20:29:21+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 20:29</time> by <a rel="author">Ashley Mitchell</a></address>
      <p>While discussing the Netflix show Rhythm + Flow, Cardi B got candid about her close relationship with fellow rapper T.I. That being said, the female emcee also took this opportunity to show him some support following his latest scandal regarding his oldest daughter’s virginity checks!</p>
      <p>Cardi is well known for how outspoken she is on pretty much any given topic and she’s also a woman so this kind of situation involves her as well, to a certain extent.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, she and TIP are close friends to the point that they are more like family than anything else!</p>
      <p>All that being said, it makes complete sense that people are curious to know her opinion on the fact that T.I. goes with his 18 year old daughter to the gynecologist every year to check that her hymen is still intact!</p>
      <p>Despite the controversy, however, Cardi made it clear that she will always be by his side, no matter what!</p>
      <p>First, she talked about the competition show and how it was working with T.I. as well as Chance the Rapper, saying that: ‘it was such a good time to film with T.I. and Chance the Rapper. We had such a great connection and we had really good conversations and they were so funny. It was like when you go to school and sit with your classmates and y’all at the table and they crack jokes and stuff. That is how it felt. Every single time I see them on social media I be like, ‘That’s my brother, that’s my brother.’’</p>
      <p>That is when she seemed to make reference to T.I.’s controversy regarding his daughter’s virginity, adding: ‘If they wrong or right, that is [still] my brother and that’s that.’</p>
      <p>So there you have it, folks! It sounds like, what Cardi was saying was that, while she may not agree with his parenting methods, she still sees T.I. as her ‘brother.’</p>
