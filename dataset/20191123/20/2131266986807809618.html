      <p>The vegan parents of a boy who died in Florida from malnourishment have been arrested on charges of negligent manslaughter. </p>
      <p>The 18-month-old boy died on Friday, September 27, 2019, in the early hours of the morning.</p>
      <p>When police spoke with parents Ryan and Sheila O'Leary, the mother said her son hadn't eaten for a week and was only being breastfed. </p>
      <p>On the day of the boy's death, after nursing, he began to experience shallow breathing. O'Leary told police she should have called someone but instead the couple fell asleep, the <i>Florida Fort Myers News-Press </i>reported.</p>

      <p>The autopsy found the boy's death was caused by malnutrition, including dehydration and swollen hands and feet, local media reported.</p>
      <p>"The boy had been struggling with illness for the past six months, making it difficult for him to eat," said US Attorney John Musca, who is representing Sheila O'Leary. </p>
      <p>According to police reports the boy weighed 7.7kg when he died. The World Health Organization says an 18-month-old boy should weigh about 11kg.</p>
      <p>The parents also have two other children, aged three and five, whom the police were told are home-schooled and only eat fruits and vegetables.</p>
      <p>The <i>Florida Fort Myers News-Press</i> described the two children as extremely small, pale and yellowish in colour. </p>
      <p>The parents have a bond set for US$250,000 and are being held in Lee County jail. An indictment is scheduled for Monday, December 9, 2019. </p>
