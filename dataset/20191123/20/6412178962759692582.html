        <b>Pep Guardiola says that early signs are “not good” regarding the injury to Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Spanish manager oversaw his side move up to 3rd in the league with a narrow 2-1 victory over Chelsea, and he paid tribute to both his own side and the opposition.</p>
      <p>“It was a top game against a top side. Chelsea have been big quality for the past 20 years,” he told Sky Sports after the match.</p>
      <p>“When they went ahead in the best moments they had we scored through Kevin de Bruyne. then we missed a lot of chances.</p>
      <p>“Chelsea are the masters at reading the passes – we had problems with Willian and Tammy Abraham. We fought a lot and had a good victory.”</p>
      <p>“They [Chelsea] are so good, they are an incredible team.”</p>
      <p>One downside of City’s victory was the injury to star man Sergio Aguero, who had to be taken off in the 77th minute for Gabriel Jesus.</p>
      <p>When asked about the condition of the Argentine, Guardiola was pessimistic, despite pointing out that he had capable backup.</p>
      <p>“I think Sergio will be bad,” he added.</p>
      <p>“Hopefully we’ll know tomorrow, but the first indication is not good. It looks like a muscular injury.</p>
      <p>“We will see tomorrow. But it is what it is. We have young players who can come in.”</p>
