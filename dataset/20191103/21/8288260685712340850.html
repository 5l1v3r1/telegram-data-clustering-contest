      <p>Dua Lipa performed at the MTV Europe Music Awards on Sunday evening, and she had her boyfriend Anwar Hadid there to support her.</p>
      <p>But those watching at home were left flocking to social media to have their say - when they were seen sitting next to each other in the audience looking very awkward.</p>
      <p>Dua Lipa, 24, sat next to her boyfriend Anwar Hadid, 20, the younger brother of models Bella and Gigi.</p>
      <p>The pair have been together since Lipa's reported split from her former partner, chef Isaac Carew, earlier this year.</p>
      <p>One tweeted: "Anwar Hadid next to Dua Lipa was precisely the picture of happiness."</p>
      <p>"Anwar looks so done I'm dying," another posted.</p>
      <p>A third said: "Dua and Anwar with that f***ing face."</p>
