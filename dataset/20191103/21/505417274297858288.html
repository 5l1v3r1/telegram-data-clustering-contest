        <b><a href="https://punditarena.com/features/mcorry/pundit-arenas-top-five-irish-sporting-achievements-of-2018/">Ireland</a> have qualified for next year’s Olympic Games in Tokyo after defeating Canada 4-3 in a dramatic penalty shootout at Energia Park.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The pair met this evening in Dublin 4 after yesterday’s first-leg finished goalless at the Donnybrook venue meaning tonight’s encounter was a winner takes all clash.</p>
      <p>After 60 minutes of action, the tie remained scoreless meaning it was going to take a penalty shootout to decide who was going forward to compete at Tokyo 2020.</p>
      <p>Gill Pender, last year’s World Cup penalty shootout hero, missed Ireland’s first attempt as memories of the 2015 nightmare in Valencia began to flood the minds.</p>

      <p>As Canada moved into a 2-0 lead in the shootout Nicci Daly slotted home to pull a goal back but Canada soon regained their two-goal lead, leading 3-1 after Roisin Upton’s miss.</p>
      <p>Goalkeeper Ayeisha McFerran proved to be the hero once again, stepping up to save two penalties either side of Beth Barr’s goal. McFerran’s second save kept Ireland in the tie while Chloe Watkins forced sudden death.</p>
      <p>In sudden death, up stepped Upton to atone for her earlier miss by sending <a href="https://twitter.com/irishhockey">Ireland</a> through to next year’s games. The Donnybrook crowd went wild as this truly special team continue to make memories for all Irish sports fans.</p>
