      <h1>Android users urged to delete app which can 'secretly purchase premium content'</h1>
      <h2>Emoji app ai.type downloaded by millions of Android users has reportedly been secretly making premium content purchases without users' permission or knowledge</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T21:31:06+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 21:31</time> by <a rel="author">Mirror.co.uk</a></address>
      <p>An emoji keyboard application downloaded by tens of millions of Android users may have cost hoards of users in unwanted charges, by sneakily triggering the purchase of premium digital services.</p>
      <p>The app - ai.type - keyboard app is a customisable on-screen keyboard tool allowing users to customise the keyboard to their personal preferences.</p>
      <p>It was available for download on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/google">Google</a> Play until June 2019, when it was removed.</p>
      <p>It claims more than 40 million users.</p>
      <p>A report into the app by Upstream Systems said the app was behind millions of suspicious mobile transaction requests - many of which had been identified and blocked by the company's anti-fraud system, Secure-D.</p>
      <p>The transactions came from more than 110,000 devices.</p>

      <p>If they were not blocked, the total number of transactions could have cost users in 13 countries up to $18 million in unwanted charges.</p>
      <p>The report did not state how many users were actually stung by the fraudulent behaviour from the app.</p>
      <p>Secure-D launched an investigation into behaviour from the app following reports of strange transaction behaviour and the app's subsequent removal from Google Play.</p>
      <p>Security experts found subscription verification texts to premium digital services on two devices examined as part of the investigation.</p>
      <p>These confirmed unwanted subscription sign-ups that occurred without any user intervention.</p>
      <p>The investigation also found the app had been delivering invisible ads and non-human clicks to its users.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>A conclusion folllowing on from the investigation declared compromised mobile apps and mobile ad fraud was a "growing problem".</p>
      <p>While Google Play was typically a safe source of Android apps, they could still be compromised.</p>
      <p>"To avoid falling victim to data theft and unwanted purchases or subscriptions, Android users should immediately check their phones to see if they have any suspicious app installed," the report read.</p>
      <p>Just last month <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/android-users-should-delete-15-20579513">Android users were advised to delete a series of apps</a> that contained malicious software and could risk a major data breach.</p>
      <p>The fifteen programmes were available through the Google Play Store, security experts at Sophos said.</p>
      <p>Most act as an irritant, frequently blocking the phone screen with large and intrusive ads.</p>
      <p>While all 15 have been removed from Google's download centre, they had been installed on more than 1.3 million devices.</p>
      <p>One of the apps, Flash On Calls &amp; Messages - also known as Free Calls &amp; Messages - displays fake error messages when launched.</p>
      <p>It then redirects you to Google Maps on the Play Store, leading users to believe that is responsible for the programme crash.</p>
