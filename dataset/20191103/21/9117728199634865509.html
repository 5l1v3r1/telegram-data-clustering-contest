      <p>Starting third on the grid, the Dutchman ran in second for most of the race, but a good strategy from Mercedes allowed Hamilton to get in front and he defended from P2, with the help of yellow flags at turn 12.</p>

      <p>After the race, Verstappen told Sky Sports:Â <i>"We did the best we could, they were just a little bit faster today. It was a very good race and it was fun. I could still see the cars ahead of me and we had good pace today.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>"The yellow flag on the back straight meant I couldn't use the DRS otherwise I think we could have been second. Still good to be on the podium.</i>
