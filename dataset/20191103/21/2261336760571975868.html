      <p>Jorge Masvidal may have had an anticlimactic win against Nate Diaz, but it doesn’t take away from his dominance at UFC 244.</p>

      <p>“Gamebred” beat up Diaz on his way to an unpopular doctor’s stoppage win in Saturday’s main event for the “BMF” title. As the MMA world looks ahead to upcoming UFC pay-per-views, there has been discussion about which opponent Conor McGregor could face for his self-proclaimed January 18th return. At the post-fight press conference, Masvidal was asked about being a potential McGregor foe, and you just knew he wasn’t going to hold back.</p>
      <p>“(He’s going to) come back to what? Like fighting in the cage? I don’t know man,” Masvidal said (via <a href="https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/2019/11/ufc-244-jorge-masvidal-conor-mcgregor-fight-cruel-dana-white">MMA Junkie</a>). “That dude has been talking wild for a second. If he fights and gets a victory and he wants this – and some of you motherf—kers are mean because you know what the f—k I’ll do to that little dude, bro. I’ll f—k that little guy up man. He’s a f—king midget.”</p>
      <p>“You see he punches old people in the face because those are fights he could win,” Masvidal continued. “He don’t want this sh-t. I don’t think Dana is going to promote that fight because you can’t get that guy to sign the paper.”</p>
      <p>Of course, McGregor responded to Jorge’s remarks with a tweet that references Masvidal’s “three piece and a soda” line from earlier this year.</p>

      <p>“Hey Burger King, could I get a 3 piece with soda and a side chicken box please? Loads of salt and vinegar. Thanks,” McGregor wrote.</p>
      <p>There has been talk of McGregor facing Donald Cerrone, but Dana White insists nothing is signed at the moment.</p>
