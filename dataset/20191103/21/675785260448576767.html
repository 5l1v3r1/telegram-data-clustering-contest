      <h2>Tottenham's Son Heung-min was sent off by Martin Atkinson following advice from VAR after his tackle on Everton's Andre Gomes</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T21:42:35+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 21:42</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Smith</a></address>
      <p>Mauricio Pochettino has declared Martin Atkinson's decision to send Tottenham star Son Heung-min off as "unbelievable."</p>
      <p>Forward Son was shown a red card after his tackle left <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/everton-fc">Everton</a> midfielder Andre Gomes with a sickening leg injury.</p>
      <p>Gomes needed urgent medical treatment on the pitch before he was stretched to an ambulance and rushed to hospital.</p>
      <p>Son originally received a yellow card from referee Atkinson before it was upgraded to a red after the seriousness of the damage to Gomes was revealed.</p>
      <p>While there wasn't an official VAR check, he was given guidance in his ear from officials in Stockley Park to show a red card.</p>

      <p>The Premier League explained in a statement: "The red card for Son was for endangering the safety of a player which happened as a consequence of his initial challenge."</p>
      <p>But Pochettino was not impressed with the verdict to dismiss Son despite his thoughts being with Gomes.</p>
      <p>“It is unbelievable he received the red card. if it’s not up to the refs then we are in a big mess, it is going to change the spirit of football," said Pochettino.</p>
      <p>"VAR changed the game because it changed the yellow card to red. it is creating a big mess. It was very very tough, completely unfair for Son, complete unfair for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> very difficult to understand this type of situation.</p>

      <p>“It was clear it was never the intention of son to create the situation afterwards.</p>
      <p>“I don’t know if we will appeal the red card, i don’t know if it is possible, but will it change it, because what we can’t change all that happened after the red card.”</p>
      <p>The clash at Goodison Park was littered with VAR controversies, including a penalty decision for Son and a hand ball in the box from Dele Alli, which led to a lengthy check, at the other end.</p>
      <p>Marco Silva said: "Really tough for us to talk about what has happened on the pitch.</p>
      <p>"What I want to tell you, all of us love football and we play for our fans and I am 100% sure they didn’t like what they saw this afternoon.</p>
      <p>"In the second half, there are so many moments to stop the game.</p>
      <p>"The penalty from Dele Alli, it was three minutes to decide. They have to be more clear.</p>
      <p>"They saw their team last week lost the game one penalty coming from nowhere and this afternoon is completely the opposite. It was not just the Dele Alli situation. I saw all the moments and I have opinions on all of them. How it is possible three minutes to decide?</p>
      <p>"Me, the club, we respect the referees, tough job, and we respect the VAR as well. I know they want the best but it is up to them to decide." </p>
