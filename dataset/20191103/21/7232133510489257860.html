      <p>Ethereum (ETH) hasn’t done too hot over recent months. Ever since Bitcoin (BTC) started rallying earlier this year, altcoins across the board have suffered, falling against the market leader.</p>
      <p>However, ETH is purportedly in the thick of a buy zone. Simultaneously, a number of analysts have claimed that the second-largest cryptocurrency is <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/03/potential-ethereum-dip-provides-ideal-long-entry-claims-analyst/">ready to head higher</a> in the coming weeks and months. This confluence may present a solid buying opportunity.</p>

      <h3>Ethereum In Key Buy Zone</h3>
      <p>If you’ve followed financial markets at all, you know that the 200-day moving average is important. This level, according to analysts across industries and time, is indicative of an asset’s trend. And according to a new analyst, it may be a viable way to determine when it is time to buy a cryptocurrency.</p>
      <p>Bitcoin trader <a href="https://twitter.com/Bitdealer_/status/1191067564526448640">BitDealer recently noted</a> that ETH is likely in a medium-term to long-term buying zone when it is 10 points below its 200-day moving average. Right now, Ethereum is in that zone, trading at $181.2 — some $30 lower than the technical level, which currently sits at $213.0.</p>

      <h3>Upward Momentum Building</h3>
      <p>While ETH may be in a good buying zone, do the technicals or fundamentals support price appreciation?</p>
      <p>According to some analysts, decidedly so.</p>
      <p>Brave New Coin’s Josh Olszewicz recently noted that the cryptocurrency’s recent consolidation in the $180 price region has allowed ETH to print a bullish chart pattern, an ascending triangle — a signal that often implies bullish trend continuation for the asset in question. He notes that a measured move for this triangle would be a 15% rally to $215 over the coming weeks.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>This came shortly after Olszewicz argued that he expects ETH’s price to see an edge-to-edge Ichimoku Cloud move from $183 to $260 — a 40% move higher. While this seems crazy, the recent move has made the charts of many cryptocurrencies bullish once again.</p>
      <p>On the fundamental side of the cryptocurrency, Ethereum’s decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem has continued to swell, recently establishing a new all-time high in terms of how much ETH is locked up in DeFi applications.  Also, Ethereum’s next system-wide upgrade, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/09/26/can-the-istanbul-upgrade-revive-ethereums-battered-price/">Istanbul</a>, will be activating on the mainnet likely during the week of December 4th.</p>
