      <h1>Poll: Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden in dead heat in hypothetical matchup</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T21:42:12+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 21:42</time> by <a rel="author">John Gage</a></address>
      <p>A hypothetical matchup between Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden in the Democratic 2020 presidential primary race showed the two nearly tied for the nomination.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://harvardharrispoll.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/HHP_October19_Topline_RegisteredVoters.pdf">poll</a> done by Harvard Harris <a href="http://www.theamericanmirror.com/shock-poll-hillary-only-1-point-behind-biden-in-hypothetical-match-up/">found</a> that 19% of people would support Biden with 18% supporting Clinton.</p>
      <p>Without Clinton in the race, the poll found the former vice president pulling in 33% support from Democrats. However, nearly half of his supporters would jump ship to back Clinton if she were to enter the race.</p>
      <p>Clinton has <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/i-can-beat-him-again-hillary-clinton-teases-2020-run">helped fuel speculation</a> of a potential run and is currently doing a book tour for her latest book, <i>The Book of Gutsy Women</i>, which she coauthored with her daughter Chelsea Clinton.</p>
      <p>In an interview last month, the former secretary of state told a PBS reporter, "Maybe there does need to be a rematch" with President Trump.</p>
      <p>The former Democratic nominee lost to Trump in the 2016 election. It would be her third attempt at the presidency if she ran again.</p>
