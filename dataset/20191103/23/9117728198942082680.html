        <b>Aston Martin Red Bull Racing star <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/max-verstappen">Max Verstappen</a> is convinced he would have overtaken <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/lewis-hamilton">Lewis Hamilton</a> in the final laps if not for the double yellow flags in the second sector at COTA, as <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/kevin-magnussen">Kevin Magnussen</a>'s beached Haas saw Hamilton hang on to second place on his way to securing his sixth title.</b>

      <p>Verstappen was quickly closing in on Hamilton in the final few laps of the United States Grand Prix after the Brit was overtaken for the lead by <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/valtteri-bottas">Valtteri Bottas</a>, getting within DRS range with four laps to go.</p>

      <p>An overtake seemed imminent, until double yellow flags were waved at the end of the back straight as Magnussen's car was stranded there. For the final two laps, the 22-year-old wasn't allowed to overtake, meaning he had to make do with a third-placed finish.</p>
      <p>Verstappen will have learned not to try anything under a yellow flag after last week's incident in Mexico, as he accepted instances like at COTA on Sunday are simply part of racing.</p>
