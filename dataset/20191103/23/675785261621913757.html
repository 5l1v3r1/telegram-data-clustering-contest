      <h1>Emotional Lewis Hamilton dedicates sixth F1 world title to family and late Niki Lauda</h1>
      <h2>The Brit clinched another crown that moves him to within one title of Michael Schumacher’s record haul of seven</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T23:21:35+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 23:21</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Maltby, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matt-maltby/</a></address>
      <p>Lewis Hamilton had to fight back tears after clinching his sixth world title - and then dedicated the triumph to his family and the late Niki Lauda.</p>
      <p>Hamilton, 34, finished Sunday's US Grand Prix in second place to clinch another crown that moves him to within one title of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/formula-1/michael-schumacher-ski-accident-10360005">Michael Schumacher</a> ’s record haul of seven.</p>
      <p>The British hero was understandably emotional on his team radio moments after taking the chequered flag before celebrating by performing donuts in his all-conquering Mercedes.</p>
      <p>Hamilton parked up in the spot reserved to celebrate his world championship.</p>
      <p>He then lapped up the cheers of the American crowd and ran into the arms of his Mercedes mechanics to celebrate before retrieving a Union flag.</p>

      <p>Hamilton's family including father Anthony, the driving force behind Lewis' career, step-mother, Linda and paternal mother Carmen were there to watch his coronation in Austin.</p>
      <p>Hamilton said: "It's hard to understand what I'm feeling right now. Naturally, it's just pure happiness and I feel more humble than ever.</p>
      <p>"I just saw my parents as I came in and just looking at my dad's smile says it all.</p>
      <p>"He supported me from day one - as did Linda, as did my mum. They've worked so hard for me to be here so I really wanted them to come out together.</p>

      <p>"I think this the first race I can remember for a long, long time that they've been together and us being united as a family.</p>
      <p>"Cloud nine doesn't even get close to where I am. I'm somewhere far above that."</p>
      <p>The Brit also thanked F1 icon Lauda, who was a huge influence on Hamilton's career before he passed away earlier this year.</p>
      <p>"I miss Niki so much. I know today he will be taking his cap off. I wouldn't have been able to do this without Niki. He's here with us in spirit," he added.</p>
