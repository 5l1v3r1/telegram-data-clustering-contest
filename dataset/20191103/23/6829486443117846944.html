      <h1>This Hilarious SNL Sketch Will Make All Pop-Punk Obsessives Die A Little Inside</h1>

      <p>“Hey Dylan — take the lip-ring out, it’s against company policy.” And so begins the<i> SNL</i> sketch ‘Corporate Nightmare Song’, a very apt parody of all the pop-punk we listened to in the naughts.</p>
      <p>Kristen Stewart hosted the most recent episode of <i>Saturday Night Live</i>, and as part of her episode, indulged in one of the show’s most beloved staples: song parody. They don’t always work, but when they do, they’re a goddamn delight. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-QG-rFf4po">‘Twin Bed’?</a> Genuinely perfect.</p>
      <p>In this skit, Stewart plays a young punk in a corporate job, raging against the machine. It starts off pretty standard — in fact it’s almost shot for shot, word for word a Blink 182 or Sum 41 vehicle, with lines like:</p>
      <p>“But white-collar life don’t work, you see, ’cause I ain’t no corporate worker bee.”</p>
      <p>However, the twist, the conceit, the comedic game, is when Stewart’s character “Tina” begins to be beguiled by the joys of stable office work — something which a lot of people in their late twenties/ early thirties can possibly over-relate to.</p>
      <p>“Let’s dive right in, let’s work together — blue sky the whole thing, make the good ideas better!”</p>
      <p>Anyway! It’s funny. There’s a nice little note of physical comedy right at the end which just rounds it up.</p>
      <p>Watch it now!</p>
