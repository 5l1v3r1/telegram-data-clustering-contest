      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 4 — Malaysia failed in their mission to end a 20-year absence from the Olympics hockey competition when they lost to Great Britain in both matches of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics qualifier play-off in London.</p>
      <p>Great Britain have become the 11th team to qualify for Tokyo 2020 after beating Malaysia 5-2 in the second match play-off at Lee Valley Hockey &amp; Tennis Centre last night, to win 9-3 on aggregate.</p>
      <p>The three-time Olympic champions, who are ranked seventh in the world, displayed great determination and desire to win and book their Olympics slot.</p>
      <p>Great Britain, who beat Malaysia 4-1 in the first match play-off yesterday, were awarded a penalty stroke early in the game but it was disputed by Malaysia.</p>
      <p>The Malaysian squad handled by chief coach Roelant Oltmans asked for a video review but the decision favoured Great Britain.</p>
      <p>Alan Forsyth converted the penalty with a beautiful push which beat goalkeeper S. Kumar in the ninth minute.</p>
      <p>Two minutes later, Sam Ward scored to give Great Britain a 2-0 lead in the first quarter.</p>
      <p>In the second quarter, Malaysia obtained their first penalty corner, which allowed midfielder Mohd Fitri Saari to reduce the deficit to 1-2 in the 24th minute.</p>
      <p>Ward scored from a penalty corner in the 31st minute by pushing to the left of Kumar to put Great Britain 3-1 ahead.</p>
      <p>Malaysia got their second penalty corner when striker Faizal Saari was fouled by being brought down in the 32nd minute but they failed to make it count.</p>
      <p>Before the end of the third quarter, Muhammad Razie Abdul Rahim narrowed the gap by scoring in the 40th minute.</p>
      <p>In their desperation to score in the fourth quarter, the Malaysian Tigers were shocked when Forsyth netted two goals, a 56th minute field goal and a 57th minute penalty stroke, to achieve a hattrick and give Great Britain a 5-2 victory.</p>
      <p>Malaysia last qualified for the Olympics hockey competition in Sydney 2000. — Bernama</p>
