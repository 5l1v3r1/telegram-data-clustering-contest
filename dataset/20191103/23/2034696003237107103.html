      <p>Taking to the stage in Toronto last night (November 2), Berninger performed solo at Dream Serenade, an annual benefit concert that raises money for and celebrates “children with exceptionalities and their caregivers.”</p>
      <p>Choosing to perform a cover, The National frontman put his own spin on his 4AD label mates Big Thief’s ‘Not’, taken from their fourth studio album, ‘Two Hands’.</p>
      <p>Getting off to a false start, Berninger had to restart his rendition after admitting, “I fucked up their song.”</p>
      <p>Watch the performance below:</p>
