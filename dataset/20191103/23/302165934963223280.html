      <p>MONTREAL, Nov 4 — An iron boat stuck above Niagara Falls for more than a century has moved because of severe weather, a park official said.</p>
      <p>“We think it's about 50 metres down the river from its original location,” Jim Hill, senior manager of heritage for Niagara Parks, said in a video posted online, adding that the vessel “flipped on its side.”</p>
      <p>Rain and strong winds that hit the region on Thursday night were responsible for moving the boat, according to local media.</p>
      <p>Known as the "Iron Scow," the boat is an iconic feature of Niagara Falls and had been stuck in the rocks about 600 meters from the edge of the falls.</p>
      <p>The boat broke loose from a tug on August 6, 1918, leaving two men stranded aboard, but they were rescued the following day, according to Niagara Parks.</p>
      <p>“It looks secure at the moment, however, if there's severe weather that comes along, it may shift it some more,” Niagara Parks CEO David Adames told the CBC.</p>
      <p>Every year, millions of tourists visit Niagara Falls, which is made up of three waterfalls spread across the United States and Canada. — AFP</p>
