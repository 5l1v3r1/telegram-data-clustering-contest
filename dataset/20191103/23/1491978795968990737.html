        <i>Ashleigh Barty said it was a "bizarre" feeling to win the WTA Finals in Shenzhen and claim the biggest winner's cheque in tennis. Barty outclassed defending champion Elina Svitolina 6-4, 6-3 in the US$4.42m (A$6.4m) Shenzhen final to become the first world No 1 to win the tournament since Serena Williams five years ago and the first Australian since Evonne Goolagong Cawley in 1976</i>
