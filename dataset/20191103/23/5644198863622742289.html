      <p>REUTERS: Britain's women's team booked their place at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics after beating Chile in a qualifying playoff at Lee Valley in London on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Early goals from Tess Howard and Laura Unsworth ensured the defending Olympic champions won 2-1 in the second leg to claim the tie 5-1 on aggregate.</p>

      <p>Chile had a goal ruled out in the third quarter before Fernanda Villagran scored late on for the visitors.</p>
      <p>Since winning the Rio Olympic title in 2016, Britain's women's team have endured a difficult transition period.</p>
      <p>Helen Richardson-Walsh, Kate Richardson-Walsh, Sophie Bray and Crista Cullen have retired from the international game, while England and Britain's most capped female player Alex Danson continues to recover from a long-term head injury.</p>
      <p>They finished second bottom in the inaugural FIH Pro League earlier this year, winning only three of their 16 matches in the competition.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, however, Mark Hager's side looked in complete control as they powered past Chile 3-0 in the first leg with goals from Izzy Petter, Hannah Martin and Anna Toman.</p>
      <p>Britain's men are also looking to secure a Tokyo spot having come back from 1-0 down at halftime to defeat Malaysia 4-1 in their first leg.</p>
