      <h1>Russia is making more Soyuz spacecraft to help NASA's ISS missions</h1>
      <h2>NASA warned it might need help for the next year or two.</h2>

      <p>While the US wants to reduce its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015/08/06/nasa-renews-russia-contract-iss/">dependence on Russian rockets</a>, Russia itself is expecting to help for a while yet. Roscosmos chief Dmitry Rogozin recently <a href="https://tass.com/science/1086295">ordered</a> the construction of two more Soyuz MS spacecraft, one of which will help NASA deliver astronauts to the International Space Station. The decision follows a letter from NASA director Jim Bridenstine warning of a delay in starting American <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-10-spacex-crew-dragon.html">commercial spacecraft flights</a>. The US may need extra seats in 2020 and 2021, Rogozin said, and this extra spacecraft will help in a pinch.</p>
      <p>The other Soyuz vessel would be used for a space tourist flight due in late 2021, although this would help free resources for other missions.</p>
      <p>Not surprisingly, Russia used the order as a chance to criticize American planning. The country reportedly warned the US that it should have asked for more seats in advance in case its target of a spring 2020 commercial flight didn't pan out. It takes "at least" two years for Energia to make a Soyuz spacecraft, Rogozin said.</p>
      <p>This isn't necessarily a sign of serious trouble for the US. SpaceX is still hoping for a Crew Dragon trip in early 2020, and Boeing's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/03/watch-boeings-starliner-capsule-launch-abort-test-at-9am-et/">CST-100 Starliner</a> might not be far behind. However, the extra construction suggests there may not be a rapid transition toward all-American launches -- the two countries might have to cooperate for a while yet.</p>
