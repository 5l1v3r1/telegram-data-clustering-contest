      <h1>'Go Nawaz Go' chants reverberate at Azadi March</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T11:59:56+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 11:59</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/7761/news-2/" target="_blank">News Desk</a></address>
      <p>The general secretary of Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl’s (JUI-F) Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chapter, Ataul Haq Darvesh, mistakenly urged the Azadi March protesters to chant “Go Nawaz Go” instead of “Go Imran Go.”</p>
      <p>In the footage which has since gone viral, Darvesh can be seen addressing protesters from the main stage of the Azadi March under way in the federal capital.</p>
      <p>Darvesh, however, soon retracted his words as other leaders intervened to correct him.</p>

      <p>The chant against the former three-time premier Nawaz Sharif gained countrywide popularity during the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf’s (PTI) 2014 sit-in.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Imran Khan is now on the receiving end of a similar challenge as thousands of protesters have converged on the federal capital with their main demand being the PM’s resignation.</p>
      <p>Azadi marchers began their journey to Islamabad from Sindh and  reached Islamabad on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Fiery speeches have been given against the PTI-led government with the prime minister given a 48-hour ultimatum to step down after which protesters have threatened to march on the PM House to forcefully arrest him.</p>
