      <p>Controversial former Donald Trump strategist Steve Bannon is organising a bid for The Telegraph to turn it into a vehicle for his brand of economic nationalism.</p>
      <p>It was reported last week that the title’s owners – tycoon twins Sir David Barclay and Sir Frederick Barclay – were looking to sell the national newspaper.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The sale has now attracted interest from Bannon who believes the Telegraph can be an international voice for Trump-style populism.</p>
      <p>Bannon, who co-founded the populist right-wing news website Breitbart, is trying to organise a consortium to buy The Telegraph.</p>
      <p>“It’s one of the great untapped properties,” he told The Sunday Times.</p>
      <p>The 65-year-old was credited with masterminding Trump’s 2016 election victory by emphasising a populist economic nationalist agenda.</p>
      <p>He acted as chief White House strategist for Trump’s first eight months in office, before leaving due to an alleged power struggle between himself and Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner.</p>
      <p>Bannon claims that The Telegraph lurched further to the right over recent years out of fear of competition from Breitbart, which had more than 17 million unique users a month at its peak in 2017.</p>
      <p>He told The Sunday Times that the traditional British right-wing has been too reluctant to embrace Trumpian populism because of historical class divides.</p>
      <p>“It’s all that Oxford-Cambridge stuff,” he said.</p>
      <p>The Barclay brothers are reportedly looking for at least £100m for The Telegraph, which the pair bought for £665m in 2004.</p>
      <p>It comes shortly after The Telegraph revealed its pre-tax profit plummeted 94 per cent last year to just £900,000.</p>
      <p>The Barclay family is reportedly preparing to break-up the empire created by the twin brothers as they also look to sell the Ritz Hotel and other assets.</p>
      <p>Other rumoured suitors for The Telegraph include Daily Mail owner DMGT and the world’s richest man Jeff Bezos.</p>

      <p>Bannon said he was not even sure if the a sale would take place.</p>
      <p>“Not sure they really want to sell, so may be [a] total waste of time,” he said.</p>
