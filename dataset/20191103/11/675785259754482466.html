      <p>A celebrity hairdresser dubbed “Cristiano Ronaldo’s crimper” has been stabbed to death in a Swiss hotel room.</p>
      <p>Ricardo Marques Ferreira has been named as the murder victim whose body was found by a cleaner at a business hotel in Zurich’s Albisrieden neighbourhood on Friday.</p>
      <p>Portugal’s leading tabloid <a href="https://www.cmjornal.pt/portugal/detalhe/cabeleireiro-de-cristiano-ronaldo-assassinado-em-hotel-e-deixado-em-cenario-de-horror">Correio da Manha</a> today linked him to the former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> and Man United star, describing him as “ <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/cristiano-ronaldo">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> ’s hairdresser.”</p>
      <p>The hair stylist and make-up artist, from the island of Madeira like Cristiano, posted a photo on social media of him putting the final touches to the footballer’s look for a September 2015 photoshoot.</p>

      <p>The dead man, whose body was discovered around 2pm on Friday, was found in bed with multiple stab wounds. The murder weapon was not found at the scene.</p>
      <p>Police in Zurich are still thought to be hunting the killer.</p>
      <p>Local reports said several guests had phoned reception hours before the grim discovery to complain about noise coming from the victim’s room.</p>
      <p>The scene the cleaner came across has been described as “horrific”, with reports the room he was in smelt intensely of alcohol</p>
      <p>The dead man, nicknamed Caju, had been living in Zurich for the past two years and had been staying at the hotel where he was killed for around a week.</p>
      <p>Portuguese press reports say he also worked with models and Portuguese actresses as well as Cristiano, currently playing for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/juventus-fc">Juventus</a> .</p>
      <p>There has been no reaction so far from the footballer to the reports. His agency Gestifute has been approached for comment.</p>
      <p>Albisrieden is a neigbourhood in District Nine in Zurich. It used to be a municipality of its own before it was incorporated into Zurich in 1934.</p>
