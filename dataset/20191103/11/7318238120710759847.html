      <p>Teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg had made it half-way from Sweden to Chile by boat, train and electric car when next month's UN climate summit was unexpectedly scrapped.</p>
      <p>But as a new venue was announced Friday for the gathering called COP25 -- this time in Spain -- the 16-year-old asked for a lift back across the Atlantic.</p>
      <p>"As #COP25 has officially been moved from Santiago to Madrid I'll need some help," Thunberg tweeted.</p>
      <p>"It turns out I've traveled half around the world, the wrong way:)"</p>

      <p>"Now I need to find a way to cross the Atlantic in November... If anyone could help me find transport I would be so grateful," said the teenager, who refuses to fly because of the carbon emissions involved.</p>
      <p>The call for help drew mixed reaction on social media.</p>
      <p>Spain's Environment Minister Teresa Ribera said her country would help Thunberg make the transatlantic trip back, hailing her role in raising awareness of climate change.</p>

      <p>But others mocked the young activist's uncompromising stance on air travel and encouraged her to go back to school.</p>

      <p>Thunberg's highly publicized journey has so far involved crossing on a zero-emission sailboat from the coast of England to New York, travelling overland through North America by train and in an electric car borrowed from Arnold Schwarzenegger.</p>
      <p>She was one of around 25,000 delegates expected in Santiago for the United Nations climate summit, until Chile pulled out as host this week due to deadly anti-government protests.</p>
      <p>The Swedish teen activist Thunberg rose to prominence last year after she started spending her Fridays outside Sweden's parliament, holding a sign reading "School strike for climate."</p>
      <p>Students across the world began emulating her campaign, leading to organized school walkouts and the rise of the "Fridays for Future" movement which targets government action on climate change.</p>
