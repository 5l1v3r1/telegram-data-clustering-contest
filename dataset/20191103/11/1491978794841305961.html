      <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/nigel-farage">Nigel Farage</a> has announced he will not make an eighth attempt to become an MP in December’s general election.</p>
      <p>Farage announced on Friday at his Brexit party’s campaign launch that it was preparing to stand candidates in the vast majority of seats across Britain unless it could strike a pact with the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservatives">Conservatives</a>.</p>
      <p>On Sunday he said that while his party intended to field up to 600 candidates, he would not be one of them.</p>
      <p>“I have thought very hard about this: how do I serve the cause of Brexit best,” Farage told the BBC’s Andrew Marr. “Do I find a seat and try to get myself into parliament or do I serve the cause better traversing the length and breadth of the United Kingdom supporting 600 candidates, and I’ve decided the latter course is the right one.”</p>
      <p>At the launch on Friday, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/01/farage-to-johnson-join-forces-or-brexit-party-will-contest-every-seat">Farage urged Boris Johnson to drop his Brexit deal</a>, which he claimed was “not Brexit” and would hamper the UK’s opportunities to strike free-trade deals.</p>
      <p>He suggested his party was prepared to stand aside in some seats in exchange for the Conservatives giving the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/brexit-party">Brexit party</a> a shot at up to 150 Labour-held constituencies in the Midlands and north that it believes it can win.</p>
      <p>But Johnson is also targeting these kinds of seats and has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/01/farage-to-johnson-join-forces-or-brexit-party-will-contest-every-seat">brushed off suggestions</a> of a leave alliance, warning that a vote for any other party than his risks putting Jeremy Corbyn in Downing Street.</p>
      <p>Farage said: “I’ve wanted for months for there to be a leave alliance. It seems obvious to me that no one party can own Brexit voters – there are Tory Brexit voters, there are Brexit party Brexit voters and a lot of Labour Brexit voters.</p>
      <p>“I always thought that to win an election, get a big majority so we can get a proper Brexit, a coming-together would be the objective. I still hope and pray it happens, but it doesn’t look like it will.”</p>
      <p>In an interview with the <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/nigel-farage-the-tories-have-offered-to-make-me-a-peer-twice-i-wont-be-bought-off-with-baubles-gnnvj63g8">Sunday Times</a>, Farage suggested the Conservatives had offered him a peerage as a “bauble” in exchange for not targeting Tory seats at the election, and a senior party colleague had been offered the opportunity to stand in a safe Conservative seat.</p>
      <p>The Brexit party’s poll rating has been significantly squeezed since Johnson came to power touting his willingness to pursue a no-deal Brexit and then struck a last-minute deal in Brussels last month.</p>
      <p>Johnson will not welcome the prospect of Farage touring the country urging voters to reject his deal. In the Sunday Times, Farage compared Johnson’s deal to a piece of cheese. “When you get it out of the fridge it’s really appetising and delicious for a few days, but after a couple of weeks it stinks and is inedible,” he said.</p>
