      <h1>SNL mocks Warren's $52T 'Medicare-for-all': 'When the numbers are this big they’re just pretend!'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T11:08:10+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 11:08</time> by <a rel="author">Brie Stimson</a></address>
      <p>With the remarkably versatile Kate McKinnon at the helm, this weekend’s "<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/saturday-night-live">Saturday Night Live"</a> cold open took aim at Sen. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/elizabeth-warren">Elizabeth Warren’s</a> $52 trillion "Medicare-for-all" health care plan.</p>
      <p>“I am in my natural habitat – a public school on a weekend,” McKinnon's excitable Warren quipped at an <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/midwest/iowa">Iowa</a> town hall, complete with fist pumps, some "whoos" and the senator’s signature raspy voice.</p>
      <p>She also took a moment to give former Rep. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/beto-orourke">Beto O’Rourke</a> a sendoff after he dropped out of the race last week.</p>

      <p>“Let me know how my dust tastes,” she said.</p>
      <p>After mentioning that she pays taxes in every state “out of principle,” she took questions from cast members playing ambivalent voters.</p>
      <p>Asked why it took her so long to release her health care plan, McKinnon’s Warren answered, “When Bernie [Sanders] was talking 'Medicare-for-all', everybody was like, ‘Oh cool,’ and then they turned to me and said, ‘Fix it, Mom.’”</p>
      <p>She added that her plan “compares favorably” to former Vice President Joe Biden’s “in that it exists.”</p>

      <p>“No one asks how we’re going to pay for ‘Remember Obama,” she said, referring to Biden’s tendency to frequently cozy up to the former president.</p>
      <p>She then answered a question about estimates of how much her plan would cost.</p>
      <p>“We’re talking trillions,” she answered. “When the numbers are this big they’re just pretend.”</p>
