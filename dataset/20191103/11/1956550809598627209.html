      <p>Is there anything better than a pleasant surprise?<br/><br/>A nice gift from a loved one, finding a few dirhams in the pocket of some clothes you haven’t worn in a while, we love it.<br/><br/>Well Vox Cinemas is holding a mystery movie screening this week, offering cinema goers the chance to go along and watch a film without knowing what it is before it starts.<br/><br/>The only clues we can see on the website is that the <a href="https://www.timeoutabudhabi.com/films">film</a> has a running time of 130 minutes, is in English and is a PG15.<br/><br/>Could it be a modern classic like The Dark Knight, Pulp Fiction, Goodfella or, Forrest Gump?<br/><br/>Maybe it’s more of a classic like One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest, Taxi Driver, Jaws, The Godfather or Apocalypse Now?<br/><br/>No one knows, and that’s part of the fun.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.timeoutabudhabi.com/film-tv/418443-friends-episodes-will-be-screened-in-uae-cinemas-to-celebrate-the-shows-25th-anniversary">Vox Cinemas also recently screened six episodes of TV show Friend</a>s to celebrate the show’s 25th anniversary.<br/><br/>But this time it’s a movie that will be shown so there’s not much chance of seeing Ross, Rachel, Phoebe, Chandler, Joey or Monica this time.<br/><br/>Two screenings will take place this week, one in Abu Dhabi and another in Dubai, on Tuesday November 5.<br/><br/>The screenings will take place at <a href="https://www.timeoutabudhabi.com/things-to-do/414787-abu-dhabis-first-imax-cinema-is-opening-at-the-galleria-al-maryah-island">The Galleria Al Maryah Island</a> in Abu Dhabi at 8pm and Mall of the Emirates in Dubai at 9pm.<br/><br/>Standard tickets cost Dhs47.25, Premier tickets cost Dhs52.50 and they’re now on sale.<br/><br/>We can’t wait to see what will be shown.<br/><i>From Dhs47.25.
