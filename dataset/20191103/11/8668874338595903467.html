      <p>England’s loss to <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/south-africa">South Africa</a> in the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/rugby-world-cup">Rugby World Cup</a> final was the most-watched TV moment of the year in the United Kingdom, with a peak audience of 12.8million.</p>
      <p>Figures released by broadcaster ITV also reveal Saturday’s match from Yokohama, which kicked off at 9am GMT, commanded a 79 per cent share of the viewing audience at that peak.</p>
      <p>It was the biggest audience for a rugby match since the 2007 World Cup final between the same two sides and the most-watched sports programme, on any channel, since the 2018 football World Cup.</p>
      <p>The average audience throughout the match, which <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/england">England</a> lost 32-12, was 8.9million, representing a 67 per cent audience share.</p>
      <p>Japan’s journey to the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/rugby-world-cup">Rugby World Cup</a> 2019 quarter-finals also captured the imagination of a nation with the match against South Africa smashing all previous rugby television audience records and set another live audience record for sport in <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/japan">Japan</a> this year.</p>

      <p>Japan’s sensational victory over Scotland, which secured the Brave Blossoms’ first-ever quarter-final, attracted an enormous 53.7 per cent peak audience share on NTV, representing a 54.8 million audience. This is a record for any rugby match and also greater than the audience achieved for the FIFA World Cup final in Japan on NHK in 2002.</p>
      <p>Japan’s opening match against <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/russia">Russia</a> attracted a peak audience of 26 million, Japan’s ‘Sensation in Shizuoka’ delivered a 29.5 million audience, while a dramatic end to the match against <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/samoa">Samoa</a> attracted a peak of 47 million.</p>
      <p>With records tumbling at a remarkable Rugby World Cup, Japan’s matches now occupy the top four biggest domestic audiences ever achieved for a rugby match, demonstrating the huge potential and appetite for rugby in Japan.</p>
      <p>Japan 2019 also smashed records for fan engagement around the globe with an incredible 1.7 billion digital video views and an estimated worldwide broadcast audience of 400 million, including a domestic all-time record television audience of 54.8 million for the unforgettable Japan v <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/scotland">Scotland</a> pool phase match.</p>
