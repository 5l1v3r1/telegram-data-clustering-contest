      <p><b>BELGRADE, SerbiaÂ (AP)</b> - Serbian police say they have arrested two people for beating up a man because they thought he was gay.</p>
      <p>Police said Sunday the two are suspected of hitting the 39-year-old man on the head after calling him gay in a restaurant in central Belgrade.</p>
      <p>Ilija Vucevic says he was attacked Friday because he was carrying a pink dog transporter bag that the attackers viewed as proof he was homosexual. Vucevic says he lost three teeth in the attack and suffered cuts and bruises.</p>
      <p>He has written on Facebook that "despite not being a homosexual, tonight I am proud to 'be' one of them."</p>
      <p>Members of Serbia's LGBT community often face harassment and violence. The country has pledged to boost LGBT rights as it seeks membership in the European Union.</p>
