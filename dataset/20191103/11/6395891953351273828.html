      <p><a href="https://www.ajc.com/entertainment/sony-announces-sequel-for-spider-man-into-the-spider-verse/7RqXURFlOU47GRsl8LVYKL/">The original film</a> received critical acclaim for its groundbreaking animation style and diverse storytelling. It even won an Oscar for best animated feature film. </p>
      <p>The movie tells the tale of Miles Morales, a young teen who takes the torch after Peter Parker is killed. But it differs from other Spider-Man films because it doesn’t focus solely on an origin story. Instead the movie opens up multiple universes where various Spider-People exist. </p>
      <p>In December, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/spider-man-spider-verse-sequel-spinoff-works-sony-1164210">The Hollywood Reporter</a> wrote that in addition to the Spider-Verse sequel, Sony is developing a female-centric spinoff.</p>
