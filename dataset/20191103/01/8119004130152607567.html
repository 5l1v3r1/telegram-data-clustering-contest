        <b>In echoes of last season's epic Premier League title race, Liverpool and Manchester City matched each other stride for stride to eke out 2-1 victories on Saturday when both had looked set for shock defeats.</b>
      </p>
      <p>They both trailed 1-0 at halftime but Sergio Aguero's 70th-minute equaliser and Kyle Walker's late winner earned champions City a 2-1 home victory over a gritty Southampton side.</p>
      <p>Liverpool left it even later. When Walker's goal went in at the Etihad Stadium they were still trailing 1-0 at Aston Villa, for whom Trezeguet scored his first goal for the club.</p>
      <p>Juergen Klopp's side were staring at their first league defeat for 10 months and having their lead halved but Andy Robertson headed them level.</p>
      <p>In the fourth minute of stoppage time Sadio Mane then glanced Trent Alexander-Arnold's corner past Tom Heaton to send the visiting fans into delirium.</p>
      <p>When the dust settled on a pulsating afternoon, Liverpool's six-point lead remained intact ahead of next weekend's seismic clash with City at Anfield.</p>

      <p>Tammy Abraham scored early on and created a second goal for Christian Pulisic after the break as Chelsea beat bottom side Watford 2-1 at Vicarage Road, despite a superb display by Ben Foster between the posts for the home side.</p>
      <p>Manchester United's revival ground to a halt as they went down 1-0 at Bournemouth -- Joshua King's goal just before halftime sending the south coasters above United into seventh.</p>
      <p>Arsenal squandered a home lead for the second successive week. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang gave Arsenal a first-half lead but Raul Jimenez earned Wolverhampton Wanderers a 1-1 draw.</p>
      <p>
        <b>NERVOUS FINALE FOR NEWCASTLE</b>
      </p>
      <p>Sheffield United's impressive return to the top flight continued as they crushed Burnley 3-0, with John Lundstram's first-half double putting them in charge.</p>
      <p>Brighton &amp; Hove Albion won a third successive home league game, beating struggling Norwich City 2-0.</p>
      <p>Newcastle United held on for a 3-2 win at West Ham United. Goals from Ciaran Clark, Federico Fernandez and Jonjo Shelvey put Newcastle 3-0 up but they survived a nervous finale as Fabian Balbuena and Robert Snodgrass struck for the hosts who are now without a league win in five matches.</p>
      <p>For the third time in seven days, Liverpool displayed their mettle in the face of adversity.</p>
      <p>Last Sunday they came back from a halftime deficit to beat Tottenham Hotspur 2-1 at Anfield.</p>
      <p>They then overturned 3-1 and 4-2 deficits to draw 5-5 with Arsenal in the League Cup on Wednesday before winning on penalties. But their luck appeared to have run out at Villa.</p>
      <p>With City turning things around, it seemed Liverpool's grip on top spot would be weakened considerably as Villa played with confidence after Trezeguet's 21st-minute volley.</p>
      <p>Liverpool had a Roberto Firmino equaliser ruled out in the first half for offside -- VAR confirming the decision despite it appearing a dubious one. They also had penalty appeals waved away as they chased an equaliser.</p>
      <p>But Klopp's side would not be denied as Robertson and Mane sealed the points in dramatic fashion.</p>
      <p>"I don't believe always we can win but I never give up that something is possible," Klopp said. "On days like this, in a stadium like this, you just have to be ready to fight."</p>
      <p>Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola offered similar sentiments after his side's tight squeeze against a Southampton side who showed immense spirit after losing 9-0 at home to Leicester last week.</p>
      <p>"We did everything, it was so difficult to attack when they defend with 11 players," he said. "We made a good comeback."</p>
