      <p>"<i>Terminator: Dark Fate</i> once again failed to avoid Judgment Day because audiences just don't care about the Terminator as a brand, an IP or a franchise," writes a box office pundit at Forbes.<br/><br/>He points out the newly-released film earned just $10.6 million on its opening day: <i>The sci-fi sequel, directed by Tim Miller, produced by James Cameron, and starring franchise vets Linda Hamilton and Arnold Schwarzenegger alongside newbies Mackenzie Davis, Natalia Reyes and Gabriel Luna, was the third attempt to revive the Terminator series in a decade... Terminator has become a metaphor for itself, with filmmakers trying different things only to face the same outcome: Judgment Day is inevitable. <br/><br/>Hollywood may yet figure out that <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2019/11/02/box-office-james-cameron-and-tim-millers-terminator-dark-fate-starring-linda-hamilton-and-arnold-schwarzenegger-bombs-with-apocalyptic-11-million-friday/">audiences who aren't die-hard sci-fi geeks have little interest in additional Terminator movies</a>... The pitches change, the hooks differ, but the result is always the same. Just because folks liked <i>The Terminator</i> in 1984 and lost their minds over <i>Terminator 2: Judgment Day</i> in 1991 does not mean they have any interest in additional Terminator movies. Just because something was once popular doesn't mean audiences care for a new iteration. <br/><br/>The sheer hubris, to try to convince audiences three times in a row to want something that they clearly don't want, at great expense, is frankly appalling. The "this time folks will bite" attitude is what has left theatrical moviegoing in grave peril as streaming and television networks have filled the gap for something beyond cover records of yesterday's former glories. It is one thing to try a reboot, strike out and move on... It is another entirely to take the same dead franchise and presume that the same audiences who said "No, thank you" not once but twice will somehow magically embrace it on the third try.</i> <br/>The article harshly concludes that <i>Terminator: Dark Fate</i> is bombing in North America "because audiences didn't want to see it."</p>
