      <p>BERLIN, Nov 3 — Niko Kovac admitted his future as Bayern Munich coach hung in the balance yesterday after suffering a 5-1 thrashing at Eintracht Frankfurt — the club’s heaviest Bundesliga defeat in a decade.</p>
      <p>Bayern are now four points behind leaders Moenchengladbach after their biggest league loss since a humiliating drubbing at Wolfsburg by the same scoreline in April 2009.</p>
      <p>That defeat a decade ago eventually cost Jurgen Klinsmann his job as boss and Kovac could face a similar fate as Frankfurt shredded 10-man Bayern after defender Jerome Boateng was sent off in the ninth minute.</p>
      <p>Kovac has been in charge since June 2018, winning the league and cup double last season, but could only offer a glum “I don’t know” when asked about his gut feeling concerning the future.</p>
      <p>“I know how this business works — I am not naive,” he said, with club president Uli Hoeness and chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge sure to be discussing his future.</p>
      <p>“My feeling is not important, the ones who make the decisions are the ones you have to ask at the end of the day.</p>
      <p>“After the red card, everything went out the window. Nevertheless, that shouldn’t have happened to us and it’s not what we expect from ourselves. We made too many mistakes.”</p>
      <p>The 48-year-old said he would process “the solid defeat” on the journey home and would “get angry and disappointed on the bus to Munich”.</p>
      <p>However, he also weathered a difficult opening few months of last season to eventually win the league and cup double.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t give up then and I won’t give up now,” Kovac added defiantly.</p>
      <p>Goals by Filip Kostic, Djibril Sow, David Abraham and Martin Hinteregger put Frankfurt 4-1 up with an hour played.</p>
      <p>Robert Lewandowski scored for Bayern in the first half, extending his league record of scoring in the first 10 games this season.</p>
      <p>However, such was Frankfurt’s dominance that head coach Adi Huetter brought on a third striker in Andre Silva for defensive midfielder Gelson Fernandes with 10 minutes left.</p>
      <p>The bold move paid off as Goncalo Paciencia added their fifth goal five minutes from time.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Bayern captain Manuel Neuer expects the next few days to be “very restless” at Bayern, who host Olympiakos on Wednesday in the Champions League then second-placed Borussia Dortmund next Saturday at the Allianz Arena in a classic Bundesliga showdown.</p>
      <p>Gladbach are three points clear at the top of the table after French striker Marcus Thuram scored their winner in a 2-1 away victory at Leverkusen.</p>
      <p>Dortmund, who host Inter Milan in the Champions League on Tuesday, climbed to second as goals by Raphael Guerreiro, Thorgan Hazard and Mario Goetze sealed a 3-0 win at home to Wolfsburg, who dropped from fourth to seventh.</p>
      <p>RB Leipzig are a point behind in third after routing Mainz 8-0 with Germany striker Timo Werner scoring a hat-trick.</p>
      <p>Werner said Bayern’s heavy defeat proved there is plenty of drama in the German league this season despite the Bavarian giants winning seven straight league titles.</p>
      <p>“With Frankfurt brushing past Bayern 5-1 at home and Gladbach proving themselves at Leverkusen, it shows this season is fun,” said Werner.</p>
      <p>“It has been very boring (in the league) for years, but now four to five teams are doing well and I’m glad we’re part of it.”</p>
      <p>Freiburg drop to fifth despite Nils Petersen stealing a point in the last minute with his second of the game in their 2-2 draw at Werder Bremen.</p>
      <p>Union Berlin later earned bragging rights in the capital as striker Sebastian Polter converted a 90th-minute penalty to seal a tense 1-0 win in the derby against Hertha Berlin.</p>
      <p>After Union’s promotion last season, this was Berlin’s first Bundesliga derby in the top tier since German reunification in 1990.</p>
      <p>In an emotional tie at Union’s Alten Foersterei, the referee marched both teams off for six minutes at the start of the second-half after fireworks landed on the pitch. — AFP</p>
