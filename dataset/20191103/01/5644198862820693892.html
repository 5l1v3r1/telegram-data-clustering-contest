      <p>Two first-half goals from John Lundstram helped Sheffield United to an emphatic 3-0 victory over Burnley at Bramall Lane on Saturday as the hosts extended their unbeaten run to four matches in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>REUTERS: Two first-half goals from John Lundstram helped Sheffield United to an emphatic 3-0 victory over Burnley at Bramall Lane on Saturday as the hosts extended their unbeaten run to four matches in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>The Blades opened the scoring through a sweeping move in the 18th minute when David McGoldrick powered up the left wing to slide the ball across the goal to Lys Mousset, who teed up midfielder Lundstram for a cool finish at the far post.</p>

      <p>Burnley had a penalty shout that was waved off after a VAR check before the hosts doubled their lead with another breathtaking counter-attack.</p>
      <p>Wing back Enda Stevens charged down the left flank to thread a pass across for Mousset who missed it, but Lundstram popped up at the back post to poke home the ball from close range.</p>
      <p>The afternoon went from bad to worse for the visitors within 90 seconds when midfielder John Fleck raced past the Burnley defence to give United a 3-0 lead before halftime.</p>
      <p>Sean Dyche's Burnley responded after the interval with a string of early crosses into the box but United, currently holding the joint-best defensive record in the league, held firm to seal victory and move up to sixth in the league.</p>
