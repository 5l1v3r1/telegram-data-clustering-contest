      <p>While Saif has openly admitted of his son Ibrahim being more better looking than him and would like if he too becomes an actor in future after completing his graduation, Sara had once revealed an incident where her brother's monologue had left her speechless as he was able to communicate with his emotive eyes.</p>

      <p>Ibrahim, on the other hand, has been away from all the limelight and prefers to spend most of his time with his family and his group of friends. He even shares a good camaraderie with <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Akshay-Kumar">Akshay Kumar</a>'s son Aarav and the duo are spotted together on several occasions as well.</p>
