The Chiefs have ruled Mahomes out for Sunday night's showdown against the Green Bay Packers because of his dislocated right kneecap.

      <p>The Green Bay Packers are in a groove, and now Aaron Rodgers has his go-to wide receiver back, with Davante Adams returning.</p>
      <p>Adams is active for Green Bay's game at the Los Angeles Chargers, after missing the past four games because of turf toe. The fifth-year star was limited in practice all week, but he said he wasn't feeling much pain running routes.</p>
      <p>Los Angeles will be without three defensive starters because of injuries: defensive tackles Brandon Mebane (knee) and Justin Jones (shoulder) and safety Roderic Teamer (groin). First-round draft pick Jerry Tillery gets his second straight start in place of Jones.</p>
      <p>In other news, Oakland Raiders center Rodney Hudson is missing his first game since 2015 with a sprained ankle. Hudson had started 59 straight regular-season games before being sidelined against Detroit, but Andre James takes his place despite being listed as questionable on the injury report with a sprained ankle.</p>
      <p>Lions defensive tackle Mike Daniels misses his fifth straight game with a foot injury, and guard Graham Glasgow is out with a back injury. Cornerback Darius Slay is playing despite being listed as questionable with a hamstring injury.</p>
      <p>Cleveland Browns leading receiver Jarvis Landry is active at Denver after being limited in practice all week with a shoulder injury but starting tight end Pharaoh Brown is out with a concussion.</p>
      <p>Tampa Bay is without tight end O.J. Howard (hamstring) at Seattle, but the Buccaneers have two key offensive linemen active despite injuries that limited them in practice: guard Alex Cappa (forearm) and tackle Demar Dotson (hamstring). Tight end Cameron Brate (ribs) is also active after being listed as questionable. The Seahawks had three injury scratches: Qunadre Diggs (hamstring), Quinton Jefferson (oblique) and Lano Hill (elbow).</p>
