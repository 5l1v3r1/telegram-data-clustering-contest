      <p>Tonight's results show saw head judge Motsi Mabuse shimmy onto the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/strictly-come-dancing">Strictly Come Dancing</a> ballroom in an unusual dress.</p>
      <p>The judge, 38, baffled viewers as she stepped out in a blush-coloured frilly dress with sheer layered detailing and dramatic lace ruffles.</p>
      <p>The glamorous professional started the seventh results show with the eye-catching look, but viewers weren't so keen with the quirky number.</p>
