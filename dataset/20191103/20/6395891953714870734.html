      <p><b>CLEVELANDÂ (AP)</b> - Police say a man suspected in a shooting that killed three people in Cleveland has been arrested on a warrant charging him with aggravated murder.</p>
      <p>Cleveland Municipal Court records show 25-year-old Kielonte Harris, of Cleveland, was charged in the Saturday shooting that killed two women and a man. Court records don't list an attorney for Harris.</p>
      <p>Cleveland police say officers responding to reports of shots fired around 4 a.m. Saturday found a man and a 36-year-old woman dead at the scene. A 26-year-old woman who was also shot was taken to a hospital where she died.</p>
      <p>Police had originally reported two men were found dead at the scene.</p>
      <p>A police release says the three who died were attending a party and were shot in the head after a verbal altercation.</p>
