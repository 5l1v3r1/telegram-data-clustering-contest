      <p>Dr. Dre (real name Andre Young) is one of music’s most revered producers, engineers, and overall artists. Producing hits for everyone from <a href="http://nme.com/artists/snoop-dogg">Snoop Dogg</a>, <a href="http://nme.com/artists/eminem">Eminem</a> and <a href="http://nme.com/artists/kendrick-lamar">Kendrick Lamar</a> to <a href="http://nme.com/artists/gwen-stefani">Gwen Stefani</a>, <a href="http://nme.com/artists/alicia-keys">Alicia Keys</a> and <a href="http://nme.com/artists/mary-j-blige">Mary J. Blige</a>, he started his career in the early 1980s as a DJ for the World Class Wreckin’ Cru before becoming a member of legendary West Coast rap group <a href="http://nme.com/artists/nwa">N.W.A.</a></p>
      <p>Delivering two classic albums in the form of ‘The Chronic’ and ‘Chronic 2001’, the 2018 Grammy Hall of Fame inductee founded Beats Electronics with Jimmy Iovine in 2008 before <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/dr-dre-44-1242772">selling it to Apple for $3 billion in 2014.</a></p>
      <p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/eminem-turned-down-a-joint-tour-with-snoop-dogg-and-dr-dre-2549223">Eminem once nearly went on a huge tour with Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre, according to 50 Cent.</a></p>
      <p>Speaking to <i>Big Boy TV</i>, the rapper said the jaunt would have been worth “collectively, over $100 million (£80.2 million)” if it had gone ahead. But Eminem turned it down because he was concerned about not seeing his daughter Hailie for so such a long period on a lengthy tour.</p>
