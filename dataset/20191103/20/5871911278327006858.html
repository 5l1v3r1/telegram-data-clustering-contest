      <h1>Adrian Peterson throws Bills defender to ground with brutal stiff-arm (Video)</h1>

      <p>Redskins veteran running back Adrian Peterson may currently be 34 years old, but he still has some gas left in his tank, as he’s shown this season.</p>
      <p>Not only that, he’s still strong enough to impose his will physically on his opponents.</p>
      <p>Peterson showed that during Sunday’s game against the Bills, even going up against the stout Buffalo defense. He received a handoff on one particular play in the game, but was immediately met in the backfield by Bills cornerback Levi Wallace.</p>
      <p>No problem, though, as AP used a stiff-arm to throw the poor guy to the ground, then just kept running.</p>

      <p>AP is still one strong fellow.</p>
