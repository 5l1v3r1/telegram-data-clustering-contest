      <p>Ivonne Bennet, one of Walter’s four nieces, said her uncle died at about 9 p.m.Saturday of kidney failure, according to the <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/entertainment/celebrities/article236964743.html">Herald</a>.</p>
      <p>“It’s been awful,” Bennet told the newspaper. “We’ve been coming and going from the hospital for days.”</p>
      <p>Mercado gave his horoscope readings during the final segment of the Spanish news program "Primer Impacto," <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/03/world/americas/walter-mercado-dead.html">The New York Times</a> reported.</p>
      <p>Flamboyantly dressed and animated with flowing hand gestures, Mercado, a former dancer and actor, dramatically read horoscopes to more than <a href="https://www.historymiami.org/exhibition/walter-mercado/">120 million viewers</a> worldwide each day, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/03/world/americas/walter-mercado-dead.html">Times </a>reported, He read his horoscopes with an actor's flair, trilling his "r's" for effect.</p>
      <p>Mercado's career as an astrologer began in 1969, when a guest failed to appear on a scheduled Telemundo program, according to <a href="https://www.wipr.pr/fallece-el-astrologo-walter-mercado-a-los-87-anos/">WIPR</a>. His segments originally were broadcast from local stations in Puerto Rico but then expanded worldwide, the <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/entertainment/celebrities/article236964743.html">Herald</a> reported.</p>
      <p>Mercado was broadcast in the 1980s on several television networks across Latin America and the United States, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/03/entertainment/walter-mercado-dies-trnd/index.html">CNN</a> reported.</p>
      <p>Mercado, also known as Shanti Ananda, lost the rights to his name in 2010 during a legal dispute, the <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/entertainment/celebrities/article236964743.html">Herald</a> reported. He settled the complaint and regained the rights to his name, the newspaper reported.</p>
      <p>Mercado ended his segments the same way each day, according to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/03/world/americas/walter-mercado-dead.html">Times:</a> “God bless you all, today tomorrow and always, and I hope you receive from me peace, a lot of peace.”</p>
      <p>Mercado then would bring both of his hands to lips and blow a kiss to the audience, saying as he signed off, “Pero sobre todo, mucho, mucho, mucho amor.”</p>
