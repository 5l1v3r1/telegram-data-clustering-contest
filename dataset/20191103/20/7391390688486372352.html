      </p>
      <p>This <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07V2ZL49W/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=bustle-19253376-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B07V2ZL49W&amp;linkId=993ade118eda4767e3897b96509d878a">luxe throw blanket</a> has it all — it's double-sided, has two textures, and it's all bound together with knit trim. One side features sherpa-style fleece, and the other one is made from equally soft microfiber. Both sides offer a little weight to keep you even warmer, and the entire blanket has just a bit of stretch so it won't pill after you wash it. Plus, it's made from stain- and fade-resistant fabrics so this blanket lasts for the long haul. But, it's won over 5,000 Amazon fans, so I'll let them tell you.</p>
      <p><b>What fans say:</b> "Almost a year later, and I am [still] a blanket evangelist. I stand by everything I've said in this original review. It washes well, holds its softness and color and is just... THE MOST AMAZING BLANKET EVER."</p>
      <h3>2. A Microfiber Fleece Throw Blanket: Bedsure Fleece Blanket</h3>

      </p>
      <p>As a rule, 8,000 Amazon fans have never led me astray thus far. This wildly-popular <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0157T1W6Y/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=bustle-19253376-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B0157T1W6Y&amp;linkId=886f4260cd9b8a33ac44472663cac089">microfiber throw blanket</a> feels like a dream without weighing you down. While it's double-sided, both sides are made from soft, lightweight microfiber fleece that allows for airflow to keep you from overheating. This blanket also features slight elasticity to keep it from bunching up, and the neat stitches at the hems literally keep this blanket together over time. You can get it in one of 20 different colors to match any space.</p>
      <p><b>What fans say:</b> "It's a lightweight blanket that's still very fluffy, soft, and super cozy. It's light enough to be a summer blanket but it also keeps you warm enough during the chilly summer to fall nights. It also has two different kind of "textured" sides, one side is more "sleek" and the opposite side is more "fluffy". Has become one of my favorite bIankets, I would definitely order again!"</p>
      <h3>3. A Textured Throw With Fringe: BOURINA Textured Throw Blanket</h3>

The textured chevron pattern and fringe detailing on the end makes this throw blanket a chic addition to any home. Even better, it's made from high-density acrylic that's durable and cozy, yet won't cause you to overheat. It's also dyed with environmentally-friendly, non-toxic dyes that won't bleed or shed, so you can be sure this throw is safe to use around pets and kids. Reviewers who want a lighter-weight throw agree that this blanket is just about perfect. It also comes in 16 colors, and a larger size if you decide you want a full-size blanket to match.</p>
      <p><b>What fans say: </b>"Was looking for an inexpensive throw for my sofa back just to give it a little color and something to wrap around my feet if cold. It’s very lightweight, acrylic, soft, and the color is pretty true."</p>

For one, it's made with long-fur sherpa microfiber. This blanket is double-sided, very warm, and basically feels like being rolled up in a fuzzy cloud while you lounge on the couch. Thousands of Amazon reviewers agree this blanket is the best of the best, especially if you're looking to add a little more texture to your decor.</p>
      <p><b>What fans say:</b> "This item ranks high up there among my favorite Amazon purchases. The "underside" is a more traditional blanket weave while the outer is the fantastically soft and "hairy" shag job you see in the pictures. When I'm truly chilly, I tend to flip the traditional side down to cover me up all nice and snug-like. When I want to feel like I'm being draped in a decadent blanket of the Gods woven in wispy, (faux) newborn baby hair...I flip that soft sucker over."</p>
