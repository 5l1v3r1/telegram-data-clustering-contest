      <p>Dua Lipa turned heads with a daring outfit that showed off her suspenders at the MTV Europe Music Awards.</p>
      <p>The New Rules singer looked sensational in the form-fitting black dress, complete with a leather corset worn on the outside and a risque thigh split that gave a glimpse of her suspenders.</p>
      <p>The star wore her hair back in a tight bun.</p>

      <p>As Lipa, who is performing her new single Don’t Start Now at the event, walked the carpet, members of the crowd – some holding banners – chanted her name.</p>
      <p>She said: “I’m really, really excited. I feel like the nerves are really going to kick in the second I have done this and I get to the task of zoning in to my performance.</p>
      <p>“I’m really, really looking forward to it.”</p>
      <p>She said of her upcoming album: “It is quite nostalgic and has disco elements but I wanted to sound fresh and new.”</p>
      <p>She added that she was “experimenting”.</p>
      <p>Nicole Scherzinger was also among the stand-outs on the red carpet in Seville, Spain.</p>
      <p>The former Pussycat Doll showed off her figure in a short, tight, sparkly red dress.</p>
      <p>She wore her long dark hair loose over her shoulders and added simple heels to complete her look.</p>
