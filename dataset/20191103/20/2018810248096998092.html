      <p>Far and away the most impressive piece of cosplay I’ve seen at BlizzCon is this wildly elaborate take on <i>World of Warcraft</i> raid boss Ragnaros, aka “the big angry fire boy from Molten Core.” Cosplayer <a href="https://www.facebook.com/kaleidoscopecostumes/">Holly “Kaleidoscope Costumes” Cowie</a> has wanted to make it for a decade.</p>
      <p>Surrounded by a horde of gawking BlizzCon attendees with cameras in hand, Cowie showed off her cosplay on the show floor today. She told <i>Kotaku</i> that it took 400 hours over three months to make and involved multiple kinds of plastic and foam, an oversized shirt over a chicken wire frame as a base, and heaps of remote-controlled interior lights.</p>
      <p>“I have wanted to do this costume for about ten years, but I haven’t always had the talent to do it the right way,” said Cowie. “So I’ve been acquiring skills over the past few years until I felt like I was ready to take it on. I decided I was going to do it right after BlizzCon last year, and then they announced Classic, so it was perfect timing.”</p>
