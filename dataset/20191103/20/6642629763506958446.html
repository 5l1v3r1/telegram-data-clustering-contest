      <p>Tens of thousands of Lebanese protested on Sunday to keep up a nationwide street movement that has brought down the government, hours after a smaller rally of thousands was held to support the embattled president.</p>
      <p>Unprecedented cross-sectarian demonstrations have gripped <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/lebanon.html">Lebanon</a> since October 17, demanding a complete overhaul of a political system deemed inefficient and corrupt.</p>
      <p>On Sunday evening, thousands of protesters streamed into the main square carrying Lebanese flags and a flurry of inventive slogans on placards, an AFP correspondent said.</p>

      <p>"Revolution," they cried to the rhythm of electronic beats in Martyrs' Square.</p>
      <p>"All of them means all of them," they chanted, calling for political leaders from all sectarian stripes to step down.</p>
      <p>They also called for a general strike on Monday to pressure political leaders.</p>
      <p>The protest, the biggest since Tuesday when supporters of the powerful <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/hezbollah.html">Hezbollah</a> movement broke up the protest camp, followed a rally earlier in the day by supporters of Lebanon's president, held to counter anti-government protests that have paralysed the country for more than two weeks. </p>
      <p>President Michel Aoun has been among the main targets of mass protests that aim to sweep from power Lebanon's entire sectarian and political elite.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Saad Hariri <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/10/lebanon-pm-saad-hariri-offers-resignation-mass-protests-191029123235727.html">resigned</a> last week, meeting a key demand of the protesters, but will stay on in the role of caretaker prime minister until a new government is formed. </p>
      <p>However, Hezbollah and its allies, who dominate the government, have held their ground without offering any concrete proposals to meet the protesters' demands.</p>
      <h3>'Change is in hands of the people'</h3>
      <p>Abir Murad, 37, had come especially from the northern city of Tripoli to take part in Sunday's protests.</p>
      <p>"We are all united against the leaders … who haven't changed anything in this country," she said. "We came to say that change is now in the hands of the people."</p>
      <p>Draped in white sheets, three demonstrators staged a mock execution of the grievances that pushed them down into the street. Nooses around their limp necks, they bore signs referring to corruption, sectarianism, and the 1975-90 civil war.</p>

      <p>Protesters in the capital shouted in support of Shia-majority areas such as Tyre, the stronghold of the Hezbollah movement, which has urged its backers not to protest.</p>
      <p>"Tyre, Tyre, Tyre. We're rising up for you," they chanted.</p>
      <p>Despite Hezbollah's warnings, protests were also staged in the southern city itself, the National News Agency reported.</p>
      <p>People also took to the street in Sunni-majority Sidon and the northern city of Tripoli.</p>
      <p>Lebanon had come to a standstill for around two weeks until the cabinet resigned on Tuesday, after which protest roadblocks were lifted and banks re-opened.</p>
      <p>Protests temporarily petered out as rain hit the capital, but activists vowed to fight on until the rest of their demands were met.</p>
      <p>Protesters have called for an end to Aoun's tenure, as well as a drastic change to a political system dominated by the same figures and families since the end of the civil war.</p>
      <p>Earlier in Beirut, hundreds of men and women took part in a feminist march from the national museum towards the main square.</p>
      <p>"Our revolution is feminist," read a banner carried by marchers.</p>
      <p>"Speak up, end male chauvinism," protesters chanted to the rhythm of drums.</p>
      <p>Sarah Bukhari, 28, said she was there to demand equality.</p>
      <p>"It's so important there is real social justice and that women's demands be heard," she said.</p>
