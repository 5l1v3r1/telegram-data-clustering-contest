      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T20:12:46+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 20:12</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Kitching, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/chris-kitching/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/crime">Paedophiles</a> are born - not made - and nothing can be done to change them, a controversial study has found.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/neuroscience">Neuroscientist</a> Dr James Cantor arrived at that conclusion after studying the brains of convicted paedophiles.</p>
      <p>He said: "All the evidence suggests that paedophilia begins in the womb."</p>
      <p>Discussing his findings, Dr Cantor revealed that his research found that paedophiles are products of nature, not nurture, and a majority of them do not want to act on their urges.</p>
      <p>He told the Australian TV programme <a href="https://www.9news.com.au/national/60-minutes-paedophiles-genetic-study-doctor-james-cantor/42a85591-d1b8-4914-a766-10de5e279b62">60 Minutes:</a> "A person does not pick it. And despite every kind of treatment that has been attempted over a century, nothing has been shown to be able to change these people from paedophiles into non-paedophiles."</p>

      <p>Dr Cantor, director of the Toronto Sexuality Centre in Canada, said society needs to rethink the way it deals with paedophiles by making medical treatment and counselling more readily available to them.</p>
      <p>He studied MRI scans of adults convicted of sexually abusing children.</p>
      <p>The programme said he found a dramatic cross-wiring in the connective tissue of their brains.</p>
      <p>The network isn't connected properly, he said, adding: "It's accidentally identifying things in the environment that should evoke a parental nurturant instinct, but instead it's provoking a sexual and erotic instinct."</p>

      <p>Most paedophiles discover their urges when they are in their teens and they are attracted to children who are as young as eight, the study found.</p>
      <p>The expert said it is important to understand the mind of a paedophile, adding that he does not defend their behaviour.</p>
      <p>While reporting on the study, <a href="https://www.9news.com.au/national/inside-pervert-park-st-petersburg-florida-where-registered-sex-offenders-live">60 Minutes</a> visited a caravan park that was set up to house registered sex offenders.</p>
      <p>Dubbed Pervert Park, the site in St Petersburg, Florida, has been called a "village of the damned".</p>
      <p>The offenders who live there claim living together is their best chance to keep children safe.</p>

      <p>One of the men, Bobby, 79, was convicted of possessing child abuse images.</p>
      <p>He told the programme: "I enjoyed it. I don't see anything wrong with it."</p>
      <p>A number of studies have found that paedophiles are usually in their teens when they discover that their sexual preferences have not matured like everyone else’s, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/29/us/pedophiles-online-sex-abuse.html">New York Times</a> reported in September.</p>
      <p>There is growing consensus that the origin is largely biological, the report added.</p>
      <p>Dr Fred Berlin, director of the Johns Hopkins Sex and Gender Clinic in the US city of Baltimore, told the newspaper: “People don’t choose what arouses them - they discover it.</p>
      <p>"No-one grows up wanting to be a paedophile.”</p>
      <p>In 2016, a study found that the brains of paedophiles who have never attacked a child are different from those who have.</p>
      <p>The finding was based on MRI scans of 40 child abusers and 37 paedophiles never convicted of sexually assaulting a child.</p>
      <p>The brain of 40 “healthy non-offending” people were used as controls during the study led by Dr Christian Kaergel from the University of Duisburg-Essen in Germany.</p>
