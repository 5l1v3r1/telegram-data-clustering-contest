      <p>Gary Lineker appears to have confirmed Ian Wright is heading into the I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! jungle.</p>
      <p>The ITV1 reality show will return later this month as the series kicks off on Sunday, November 17.</p>
      <p>I'm A Celeb fans are eagerly-anticipating the show's return, with Holly Willoughby set to be replaced as presenter.</p>
      <p>Ant McPartlin is back, taking the reins from the This Morning presenter Holly, 38, with Declan Donnelly partnering him.</p>
      <p>Ant and Dec have been reunited on the show after the former's problem-plagued 2018, which saw him banned from driving and take time off TV commitments to deal with addiction issues in rehab.</p>

      <p>While the jungle line-up has yet to be announced, Gary Lineker appears to have dropped a major hint.</p>
      <p>Host Gary mercilessly teased his co-star Ian with a series of jungle related puns on Match of the Day last night.</p>
      <p>Gary asked the former Arsenal and Crystal Palace striker about 'passing all the trials'.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Former Everton, Leicester City and Tottenham Hotspur star Gary then said: "You all right Ian? I'm not bugging you?"</p>
      <p>Gary then remarked that Norwich City had 'come out of the jungle that is the Championship'.</p>
      <p>And it was this particular comment which led to Wrighty bursting into a fit of giggles.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Gary told viewers: "Wrighty's off to eat leaves."</p>
      <p>One football fan laughed on social media over the hilarious exchange.</p>
      <p>They wrote on Twitter: "Gary Lineker teasing Ian Wright by making low-key jungle references is absolutely hilarious. Wright almost burst out laughing at that last one."</p>
