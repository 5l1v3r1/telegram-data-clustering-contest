      <h1>10 of the worst free transfers - from outcast defender to 'George Weah's cousin'</h1>
      <h2>There have been plenty of costly mistakes over the years even when clubs have managed to avoid paying a transfer fee</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T09:00:00+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 09:00</time> by <a rel="author">Darren Wells, Kieron Day, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/darren-wells/</a></address>
      <p>With transfer fees continually on the rise, clubs are always on the lookout for a freebie.</p>
      <p>Despite all the analysis and scout reports that occur, the acquisition of a top class player for nothing can still prove risky.</p>
      <p>Potential employers are often happy to abandon their transfer strategy and roll the dice hoping for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/10-best-free-transfers-time-20715260">the next Andrea Pirlo or James Milner</a> .</p>
      <p>However that bargain deal can sometimes turn out to be anything but, and backfire catastrophically.</p>
      <p>Over the years we've seen many of them flop, from failed drug tests, to astronomical wages, fake footballers, and everything in between.</p>
      <p>Here are 10 of the worst free transfer of all time...</p>
      <h3>1. Nicolas Anelka - Shanghai Shenhua to West Brom, 2013</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Anelka had a decent reputation from his time in the Premier League with the likes of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> , <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> , Bolton and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> .</p>
      <p>But sadly for West Brom, the Hawthorns was where his run would end.</p>
      <p>The forward returned to England from playing in China (via a brief spell at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/juventus-fc">Juventus</a> ) but made just 12 appearances for the Baggies.</p>
      <p>He did grab two goals in that time, but celebrated the second of which against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> with a controversial salute that had links to anti-semitism.</p>
      <p>Banned and fined by the FA, he didn't play for West Brom again.</p>
      <h3>2. Marouane Chamakh - Bordeaux to Arsenal, 2010</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Chamakh's arrival at the Emirates was greeted with plenty of excitement among the club's fans.</p>
      <p>After losing Emmanuel Adebayor the season prior, expectations were on the Moroccan to help end the Gunners recent lack of trophies.</p>
      <p>And he made a promising start - with 10 goals in his first 21 outings.</p>
      <p>But it wasn't to last, as he scored just two in his next 43 appearances for the club.</p>
      <p>He remained in England, with a spell at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> his best stint, but retired last summer after two-and-a-half years out of the game.</p>
      <h3>3. Winston Bogarde - Barcelona to Chelsea, 2000</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>The benchmark for free transfers gone wrong.</p>
      <p>Bogarde had enjoyed an established career with European giants Ajax, Milan and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fc-barcelona">Barcelona</a> , when Chelsea snapped him up.</p>
      <p>Although then-Blues manager Gianluca Vialli claimed he knew nothing about it, before his successor Claudio Ranieri quickly decided he had no time for Bogarde.</p>
      <p>The defender soon became an infamous flop at Stamford Bridge, and a stain on the history of the club, as he made just nine appearances in four years, all whilst earning a reported £40k-a-week in wages.</p>
      <p>Bogarde said: "Why should I throw fifteen million euros away when it is already mine? At the moment I signed it was in fact my money, my contract."</p>
      <h3>4. Mark Bosnich - Manchester United to Chelsea, 2001</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Chelsea should have perhaps known better than to move for Bosnich after legendary Man Utd boss Sir Alex Ferguson labelled him a "terrible professional".</p>
      <p>Not to mention him landing in hot water with the FA for a Nazi salute at previous club Aston Villa.</p>
      <p>And after only 11 appearances for the west London club, the Australian goalkeeper was immediately sacked after testing positive for cocaine use.</p>
      <p>Bosnich failed the drugs test in 2002, and was subsequently banned from playing by the FA for nine months.</p>
      <h3>5. Andrew Voronin - Bayer Leverkusen to Liverpool, 2007</h3>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>Voronin flopped at Liverpool (Image: Getty Images)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Liverpool had made some particularly good signings on freebies in the past when Voronin rocked up from Germany.</p>
      <p>The Ukrainian scored his fair share of goals for three different clubs in the Bundesliga, as well as helping his country to the World Cup quarter-finals in 2006.</p>
      <p>But Voronin peaked at Anfield as soon as he came through the front doors with three goals in his first four games.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately for Liverpool and Voronin, that was as good it got, as he managed just three more goals that season before being loaned back to Germany.</p>
      <p>Arguably best remembered on Merseyside for his glorious ponytail, or for spurning two shots into Row Z against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fulham-fc">Fulham</a> .</p>
      <h3>6. Jose Bosingwa - Chelsea to QPR, 2012</h3>

        <figcaption>QPR cut short Bosingwa's stay (Image: Getty Images)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>A two-time Champions League winner with both Porto and Chelsea, Bosingwa was probably as confused as QPR fans when he arrived at Loftus Road.</p>
      <p>The Hoops were spending money left, right and centre when the Portuguese full-back landed a £65k-a-week deal.</p>
      <p>It proved to be money wasted.</p>
      <p>Just months later he refused to sit on the bench for a Premier League clash, and was fined two weeks wages.</p>
      <p>QPR were then consigned to relegation in his first season, and Bosingwa was seen laughing on TV.</p>
      <p>Needless to say he didn't last long after that.</p>
      <h3>7. Robert Pires - Villarreal to Aston Villa, 2010</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>It feels almost wrong to put a player of Pires's standing in this list after his time at Arsenal.</p>
      <p>A member of the Gunners Invincibles of 2004, the football writers player of the year in 2002, not to mention a World Cup winner.</p>
      <p>But after a switch to Spain, the Frenchman was soon tempted back to the bright lights of the Premier League with Aston Villa.</p>
      <p>At 37, he was past his peak, and made little impact in his nine league appearances.</p>
      <p>"My experience at Villa has been a failure" Pires admitted.</p>
      <h3>8 and 9. Joe Cole &amp; Milan Jovanovic - Liverpool, 2010</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Liverpool fans shudder at the thought of Roy Hodgson's reign as manager - and one photo encapsulates it.</p>
      <p>Hodgson made eight signings in his first transfer window as Reds boss, with big stars such as Joe Cole and Milan Jovanovic among them.</p>
      <p>Cole was considered a huge coup for the club, while Jovanovic's transfer had actually been arranged by ex-Liverpool boss Rafa Benitez.</p>
      <p>Fans expected great things, but unfortunately for them their expectations were not met by either player.</p>
      <p>Cole was sent off in Liverpool's opening game of the season, and started just 9 games before being loaned to Lille just 13 months after arriving.</p>
      <p>Jovanovic had previously turned down a move to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> , but only made 10 appearances for Liverpool before his depature.</p>
      <p>They both lasted longer than Hodgson, mind.</p>
      <h3>10. Ali Dia - to Southampton, 1996</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Possibly the greatest story in the history of football transfers.</p>
      <p>Graeme Souness couldn't believe his luck when he was contacted by a chap claiming to be PSG and Milan legend George Weah, who was touting for interest for his footballing 'cousin' by the name of Ali Dia.</p>
      <p>The then-Southampton boss quickly set about inviting Dia down for a trial, after hearing from the contact that he had only recently been at PSG himself, and was a Liberian international.</p>
      <p>None of which was true.</p>
      <p>After one training session with the first team, Dia was thrown into action just 20 minutes into the Saints' clash with Leeds after Matt Le Tissier went off injured.</p>
      <p>Dia's last club had actually been non-league Blyth Spartans, where he made just one appearance, and the contact on the phone turned out to be his friend from university.</p>
      <p>Le Tissier said: "It was unbelievable. He ran round the pitch like Bambi on ice, he was so embarrassing to watch Graeme Souness actually had to take him off again after half time: he was that bad.</p>
      <p>"It was a great wind up, I bet he was just chuffed to get out on the pitch."</p>
