      <h1>Why The Colts Will Score More Than The Other Guys - Steelers Edition</h1>

      <p><b>Who:</b> The Indianapolis Colts vs the Pittsburgh Steelers.</p>
      <p><b>What: </b>Week 9 of the 2019 NFL season.</p>
      <p><b>Where: </b>Ketchup Field, Pittsburgh, PA.</p>
      <p><b>When: </b>1 PM Eastern, Sunday, November 3rd. Daylight saving time goes into effect at 2 this morning, so everyone’s going to be griping about that. TV: CBS. Once again we get their #2 crew of Ian Eagle and Dan Fouts. Hopefully Rock Ya-Sin gives them something else to talk about this week. (He was penalized 4 times during that sentence).</p>
      <p>
        <b>Why the Colts will score more than the other guys:</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>1. Luck</b>
      </p>
      <p>No, no, no, not that guy. SMH. “To wait for luck is the same as waiting for death” – Japanese proverb. Kinda like reading this article.</p>
      <p>I had something nifty all planned out for this space, then things just went all astray, and upside down and back and forth and all of that stuff.</p>
      <p>At about 3 this morning (game day), I stopped off at the inconvenience store, my mind lost in thought over the events of the night. I parked on the side of the building, same as always, and as I rounded the corner I saw a disheveled looking man with a full beard, and wearing a disheveled looking Colts hoodie. I have no idea why he was sitting there, but as I passed him, we made eye contact and with a wink he held up a sign reading “I gave my heart to this team!” What a bizarre ending to a bizarre night.</p>
      <p>Marlon Mack is going to run over these fools. Terrible Towels are stupid. And so are the people who wave them.</p>
      <p>
        <b>2. Why do I even try</b>
      </p>
      <p>Jess is back this week and dropped a gem (?):</p>
      <p>“Because unlike the other famous Rudolph, Mason’s nose isn’t a beacon of light, leading teams to eternal holiday glory.”</p>
      <p>Alright, I have no clue what the hell she’s trying to say here, and neither do you. I’m just the messenger.</p>
      <p>
        <b>3. Throwback Sunday</b>
      </p>
      <p>A throwback to the days when life was different</p>
