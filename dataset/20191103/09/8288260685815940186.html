      <p>Jason Momoa has been criticised by animal welfare charity Peta after sharing a video of himself feeding a bear a biscuit out of his own mouth.</p>
      <p>The Game Of Thrones star posted the behind-the-scenes clip from his new Apple TV+ show See, in which he fights a kodiak bear, saying the animal needed to know his scent.</p>
      <p>The footage shows him in costume as he gets on his knees in front of the animal and puts the snack in his mouth.</p>
      <p>Brittany Peet, director of captive animal law enforcement at the charity, said in a statement: "Momoa apparently doesn't realise that there's no behind-the-scenes justice for this exploited bear.</p>
      <blockquote>

      </blockquote>
      <p>"Wild animals are often torn away from their mothers as infants and thrown into a life in which trainers frequently use cruel techniques such as food deprivation, beatings, electric shocks and chaining to force them to perform.</p>
      <p>"Momoa knows how convincing and lifelike computer-generated imagery, animatronics, and other cutting-edge technologies are, but subjecting a bear to the bright lights and bustle of a production set is stressful and totally outdated, so we hope he'll refuse to participate in stunts involving wild animals in the future."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Posting the video on Instagram, Momoa wrote: "The things we do for our ART.</p>
      <p>"SEE. Is out. Please watch on Apple TV+. The bear needs to know your scent. So here's my cookie kisses big guy.</p>
      <p>"Love you tag. Aloha Baba Voss."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Baba Voss is the name of Momoa's character in the futuristic show, which is penned by Peaky Blinders creator Steven Knight.</p>
      <p>It is set 600 years in the future in a decimated America where human beings have lost the power of sight and have retreated to a new Dark Ages.</p>
      <p>The series also stars Alfre Woodard and Sylvia Hoeks.</p>
