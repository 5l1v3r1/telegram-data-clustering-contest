      <h1>'Laundry List of Nothingness': Netizens Weigh in on Alyssa Milano's 'Nine Reasons to Impeach Trump'</h1>

        <b>The US House of Representatives adopted a resolution on 31 October outlining a set of ground rules for the Democrat-led impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, calling for public hearings and the release of transcripts from a series of closed-door hearings prior to Thursday’s vote.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Actress and <a href="https://sputniknews.com/viral/201810041068600975-alyssa-milano-loves-clinton-kavanaugh/">activist Alyssa Milano</a> on Friday listed nine reasons why she thought Donald Trump should be impeached, in response to the US President’s tweet on the same day that read:</p>
      <blockquote>“You can’t Impeach someone who hasn’t done anything wrong!”</blockquote>

      <p>​In response, the Charmed actress, who is a staunch political opponent of Trump, assembled a laundry list of his purported wrongdoings, that reads as follows:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Obstructing Justice</li>
        <li>Violation of the Emoluments Clause</li>
        <li>Collusion</li>
        <li>Advocating political violence</li>
        <li>Abuse of power</li>
        <li>Persecuting political opponents</li>
        <li>Attacking the free press</li>
        <li>Violating due process for immigrants</li>
        <li>Quid pro quo with Ukraine</li>
      </ol>

      </figure>
      <p>​Most alleged wrongdoings have been debunked, particularly her claim of “collusion”.</p>
      <p>In April 2019, US special counsel <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201911031077211075-newly-released-mueller-interview-notes-suggest-trumps-push-for-democratic-e-mails-in-2016-campaign/">Robert Mueller published a final report</a> on his two-year long inquiry, concluding that there was no evidence of collusion between US President Donald Trump and Russia during the 2016 presidential campaign, and he did not make a determination on “obstruction of justice”.</p>
      <p>As anticipated, Milano’s tweet sparked a backlash on social media as many promptly debunked her list of Donald Trump's alleged wrongdoings in their tweets:</p>

      <h3>House Adopts Resolution on Impeachment Procedures</h3>
      <p>Milano’s list of alleged Trump wrongdoings comes after the US House adopted on 31 October a set of rules which outline <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201910311077192375-us-house-adopts-resolution-on-impeachment-procedures-what-to-expect-next/">how the impeachment procedures launched by the Democrats</a> targeting President Donald Trump will be carried out going forward.</p>
      <p>The adoption of the resolution was the Democrats' response to accusations of a lack of transparency in their probe.</p>
      <p>Should the House successfully vote to eventually impeach the president, it would trigger a trial in the Republican-led Senate that would require votes from at least 20 Republicans and all Democrats to remove Trump from office.</p>
      <p>President Donald Trump has repeatedly insisted <a href="https://sputniknews.com/analysis/201911011077193825-impeachment-inquiry-charade-aims-to-convince-senate-republicans-to-convict-trump/">he has not committed any impeachable crimes,</a> denouncing the procedure as "a witch hunt".</p>
