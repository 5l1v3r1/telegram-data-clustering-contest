        <b>NAIROBI, Kenya, Nov 3 – Kibera constituency will Sunday host the country’s political heavyweights, in the glare of Monday’s campaign deadline, that comes some three days to the by-election.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Deputy President William Ruto is set to lead the ruling Jubilee party in drumming support for their contender, McDonald Mariga, in a crowded race, that has attracted 24 candidates.</b>
      </p>
      <p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
      <p>“The bedroom man has sought for reinforcement, yet he claims it is his bedroom, just know things are thick,” the Deputy President said.</p>
      <p>Kibra is a perceived stronghold of Odinga and according to legislator Junet Mohammed, his ‘bedroom.”</p>
      <p>Orange Democratic Movement leader Raila Odinga will be campaigning for Imran Okoth, in a rally dubbed “Kibra Locked” set to be joined by political players from other factions, among them Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua.</p>
      <p>At Linda grounds, Ford Kenya party leader Moses Wetangula will pitch camp to woe voters for Eng. Butichi Khamisi.</p>
      <p>Others seeking a piece of Kibra include Musalia Mudavadi led party Amani National Congress, whose flag was handed to Eliud Owalo, a once political advisor of Odinga.</p>
      <p>Okoth seeks to carry on with his brother’s legacy, who is hailed for investing heavily in the education sector.</p>
      <p>“Ruto is a Deputy President, what difference will he do for Kibra, if Mariga is voted in?” Odinga posed when he received Governor Mutua, who has since declared support for Okoth.</p>
      <p>As the clock tickles, development politics have been put on the periphery, with a shift to tribal factions.</p>
      <p>For example, Mutua met the ODM leader in the company of members of his community – and even addressed them in the Kamba dialect, urging them to vote for Okoth.</p>
      <p>DP Ruto has also hosted various tribal delegations at his Karen official home.</p>
