      <h1>Beijing says ‘ready to work’ with ASEAN on South China Sea rules</h1>

      <p>Beijing said Sunday it is “ready to work” with Southeast Asian nations on a code of conduct in the flashpoint South China Sea, where it is accused of bullying fellow claimants and building up military installations.</p>
      <p>China claims most of the resource-rich waterway, a major global shipping route and long a source of tension among claimants in Southeast Asia.</p>
      <p>The 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) has been locked in talks for a code of conduct for the sea, where China is accused of deploying warships, arming outposts and ramming fishing vessels.</p>
      <p>The agreement, set to be finished in 2021, will set out conduct guidelines for the sea along with conflict resolution parameters.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, China’s premier Li Keqiang said the first reading of the document — a chance for all members to comment on the draft terms — was “a very important landmark”.</p>
      <p>“We stand ready to work with ASEAN countries building on the existing foundation and the basis to strive for new progress” on the guidelines, he said.</p>
      <p>He added that China wanted to “maintain and uphold long-term peace and stability in the South China Sea”.</p>
      <p>Tensions have flared in recent weeks between China and Vietnam, one of Beijing’s most vocal critics in the sea.</p>
      <p>Hanoi hit back at China after it sent a survey ship into waters inside its Exclusive Economic Zone and around islands claimed by both Hanoi and Beijing.</p>
      <p>The ship left after several weeks in the area.</p>
      <p>The Philippines, Taiwan, Malaysia and Brunei also have overlapping claims with China in the sea.</p>
      <p>The US has accused China of bullying behaviour in the sea, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said last week America has been too easy on China.</p>
      <p>“We hesitated and did far less than we should have,” he said, referring to China’s disputes with Vietnam and the Philippines in the sea.</p>
