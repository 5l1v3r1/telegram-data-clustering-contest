      <p>Nigel Farage says he will not stand to be an MP at the general election.</p>
      <p>The Brexit Party leader launched the party's campaign on Friday but has now confirmed he won't stand himself.</p>
      <p>He confirmed he wouldn't make an eight bid to become an MP while speaking to Andrew Marr.</p>
      <p>When asked if he was going to stand in the upcoming election, the Brexit Party leader told Marr: "I've thought very hard about this, how do I serve the cause of Brexit best, because that's what I'm doing this for.</p>
      <p>"Not for a career, I don't want to be in politics for the rest of my life.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"Do I find a seat to try get myself into parliament or do I serve the cause better traversing the length and breadth of the United Kingdom supporting 600 candidates, and I've decided the latter course is the right one."</p>
      <p>He added: "It's very difficult to do both. It's very difficult to be in a constituency every day and at the same time be out across the United Kingdom."</p>

      <p>On Friday Mr Farage begged Boris Johnson for a "leave alliance" which could see the Tories and the Brexit Party join forces to try and sink Jeremy Corbyn's bid to become PM.</p>
      <p>That, he claimed, could involve up to 150 Tory candidates stepping aside in Labour seats that have never voted Tory - in exchange for the Brexit Party not contesting other Tory seats.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Boris Johnson has ruled out any alliance between the two right-wing parties.</p>
      <p>Speaking about Mr Johnson's Brexit deal, Mr Farage told the Sunday Times it was like a piece of cheese.</p>
      <p>"When you get it out of the fridge, it's really appetising and delicious for a few days, but after a couple of weeks it stinks and is inedible."</p>
