      <h1>Nigel Farage says he will not stand to be Brexit Party MP at the general election</h1>
      <h2>The Brexit Party leader launched the party's campaign on Friday but has now confirmed he won't stand himself</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T09:23:03+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 09:23</time> by <a rel="author">Oliver Milne, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/oliver-milne/</a></address>
      <p>Nigel Farage has said he will not stand at the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/general-election">general election</a>.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brexit">Brexit</a> Party leader confirmed he wouldn't make an eight bid to become an MP while speaking to Andrew Marr.</p>
      <p>On Friday Mr Farage begged <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> for a "leave alliance" which could see the Tories and the Brexit Party join forces to try and sink Jeremy Corbyn's bid to become PM. <br/>That, he claimed, could involve up to 150 Tory candidates stepping aside in <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> seats that have never voted Tory - in exchange for the Brexit Party not contesting other Tory seats.</p>

      <p>Boris Johnson has ruled out any alliance between the two right-wing parties.</p>
      <p>But despite the bid, Mr Farage has confirmed he will not stand himself.</p>
      <p>"I have thought very hard about this: How do I serve the cause of Brexit best?" hesaid.</p>
      <p>"Do I find a seat and try to get myself into parliament or do I serve the cause better traversing the length and breadth of the United Kingdom supporting 600 candidates, and I've decided the latter course is the right one."</p>
      <p>It would have marked his eight attempt to become an MP.</p>

      <p>Mr Farage has stood twice in South Thanet, alongside Buckingham, Salisbury and Bexhill and Battle.</p>
      <p>He also lost by-elections in Eastleigh in 1994 and Bromley and Chislehurst in 2006.<br/><br/>Mr Farage's ploy  to play the Brexit Kingmaker could ironically delay Britain leaving the EU again, after he said Mr Johnson could have until July 1 to meet the terms of the offer.</p>
      <p>It comes after the former UKIP leader said he was twice offered a peerage as one of a number of "baubles" put forward by the Conservative party.</p>
      <p>Speaking about Mr Johnson's Brexit deal, Mr Farage told the Sunday Times it was like a piece of cheese.</p>
      <p>"When you get it out of the fridge, it's really appetising and delicious for a few days, but after a couple of weeks it stinks and is inedible."<br/> </p>
