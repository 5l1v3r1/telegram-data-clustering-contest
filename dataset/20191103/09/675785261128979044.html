      <p>Lewis Capaldi's ex-girlfriend, who inspired his love song Someone You Loved, has been unveiled as 22-year-old Paige Turley - who appeared on Britain's Got Talent at the age if 14.</p>
      <p>The musician, 23, and pretty blonde are said to have met at college in Motherwell, around five years ago, and went on to date on and off for around a year.</p>
      <p>Lewis fell "head-over-heels" for the music student and was left "gutted" when their relationship ended, according <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz">The Sun,</a> and went on to use the heartbreak to pen his UK and US number one hit Someone You Loved.</p>
      <p>A source shared: "She’s the girl. The song and his album is clearly inspired by love and he loved her — he really did.</p>

      <p>“Paige dated Lewis while they were both at college from around 2014 to 2016. They were on and off and together just over a year. It’s funny that his songs now mean so much to so many. But the real story behind it is boy meets girl."</p>
      <p>They also added that Paige, who wowed judges on BGT in 2012, "must be thrilled" to have been Lewis' muse.</p>
      <p>Another told the publication how the "unlikely pair" bonded over their "passion for singing" and shared mutual respect for one another musically.</p>

      <p>"A real indication of that is I brought my pal from school here, who works in recruitment. So there's no relationship."</p>
