      <p>The items went under the hammer at Julien’s Auctions, with a poster signed by Grease stars Newton-John, John Travolta and other cast members going for $64,000 and a Pink Ladies jacket given to the British-born singer fetched $50,000, 25 times its estimate.</p>
      <p>Both buyers of the trousers and jacket wish to remain anonymous, though the buyer of the jacket told Darren Julien: “I’m proud to be the owner of this incredible piece of pop culture history.”</p>
