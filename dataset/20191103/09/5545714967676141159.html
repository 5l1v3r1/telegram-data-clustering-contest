      <p><i><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../review-the-haunted-island-a-frog-detective-game-532205.phtml">The Haunted Island, a Frog Detective Game</a></i> is goofy and delightful in all the right ways. It’s a short experience, at just about an hour long, but the length is perfect for the story it’s trying to tell. I loved it at release, but I’ve found myself growing more and more fond of it over time. I miss its wholesome jokes and references to the ever-impressive Lobster Cop, who I am one-hundred percent down to see receive his own spinoff series. He’s so dang mysterious, and I hear he’s got mad skills.</p>
      <p>While we may never get the chance to dive deeper into the Lobster Cop lore we all crave and deserve, the sequel to the first game, <i><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1047220/Frog_Detective_2_The_Case_of_the_Invisible_Wizard/">Frog Detective 2: The Case of the Invisible Wizard</a></i>, is gearing up to release sometime in the next couple of months, and I couldn't be more excited!</p>

      <p>If you’re a total dork who never played the original, it’s too late. You’re already dead to me. You had your chance. We can still be friends, but I’m duty-bound to slip you a judging side-eye when you’re not looking for the foreseeable future. My hands are tied. I don't make the rules.</p>
      <p>Luckily, thanks to this <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/games/day-devs-2019?hmb_source=navbar&amp;hmb_medium=product_tile&amp;hmb_campaign=tile_index_8">super neat Humble Day of the Devs 2019 Bundle</a>, you’ve been given the opportunity to dive in and redeem yourself for the low price of one dollar. That same dollar will get you a copy of the surreal painting adventure known as <i>ART SQOOL</i>. The “pay more than the average” tier offers up both <i>Battle Chef Brigade</i> and <i><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../review-flipping-death-516037.phtml">Flipping Death</a></i>. I still haven’t yet gotten around to the former, but the latter is the spiritual successor to the extremely excellent <i>Stick it to The Man</i>. It never quite reaches the heights of its predecessor, but it’s definitely worth it for existing fans.</p>
      <p>Lastly, with the final tier, coughing up nine dollars will get you copies of <i>Minit</i> (which <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../i-have-but-one-humble-request-play-minit-because-it-s-free-568665.phtml">Brett insists is awesome</a> and I need to finally get around to playing) as well as <i>Toejam &amp; Earl: Back in the Groove</i>, a game that CJ gave a whopping 9.5/10 score <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../review-toejam-earl-back-in-the-groove-544364.phtml">in his review</a>.</p>
      <p>All in all, this is a damn solid bundle and a great opportunity for me to pester all of you to finally play <i>Frog Detective</i>. That sounds like a win to me.</p>
