      <p>Terminator: Dark Fate has opened well below expectations at the US box office.</p>
      <p>Studios estimate the action sequel earned only 29 million US dollars (£22.4 million) from over 4,000 North American locations.</p>
      <p>The film from Paramount Pictures cost a reported 185 million dollars (£143 million) to produce.</p>

      <p>The movie’s below expectations performance comes despite generally favourable reviews and the return of Terminator 2: Judgment Day stars Linda Hamilton and Arnold Schwarzenegger and producer James Cameron.</p>
      <p>But it was enough to win the top spot at the box office. Second place went to Joker, with 13.9 million dollars (£12 million), and third place to Maleficent: Mistress Of Evil which added 12.1 million dollars (£10.45 million).</p>
      <p>Focus Features’ Harriet Tubman biopic Harriet performed better than expected, earning 12 million dollars (£10.36 million) from just over 2,000 theatres to take fourth place.</p>
      <p>And Edward Norton’s Motherless Brooklyn opened in ninth to 3.7 million dollars (£3.19 million).</p>
