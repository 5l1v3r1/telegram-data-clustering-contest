      <h2>Jorge Masvidal beat Nate Diaz at UFC 244 in controversial style and Conor McGregor has weighed in and issued a challenge</h2>

      <p>Conor McGregor has posted his reaction to rival Nate Diaz's defeat to Jorge Masvidal - and issued his challenge to the Americans.</p>
      <p>Masvidal won a bloody fight at UFC 244 after Diaz was stopped in the third round having suffered a deep cut above his eye.</p>
      <p>A cageside doctor ruled that the fight could not continue as the wound, which was inflicted onto Diaz in the opening minutes of the fight, continued to pour with blood.</p>
      <p>Both fighters were disappointed with the result, with Masvidal immediate offering a rematch.</p>
      <p>But McGregor, who appeared to be impressed with the duo while watching at home, wants to get involved in a fight with one of the pair.</p>

      <p>The Notorious has often hinted at turning his competition with Diaz into a trilogy but also mentioned wanting to fight the winner on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>"Robbed of a classic there we were," McGregor wrote on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> . "Cutmen in the corner must be more assertive when a fighter must stay still. Between rounds 1 and 2 a crucial moment of repair was missed due to movement.</p>
      <p>"Either way, solid fighting and onto the next... Me."</p>
      <p>Masvidal was asked about fighting McGregor in his post-fight press conference and suggested that the Irishman didn't really want to fight him.</p>
      <p>”Come back to what? What do you mean, like fighting in the cage? I dunno man,” Masvidal said.</p>

      <p>“That dude has been talking wild for what, a second? If he fights and gets a victory and wants this? And some of you motherf**kers are mean because you know what the f**k I’ll do to that little dude, bro. I’ll f**k that little guy up, man. He’s a f**king midget.”</p>
      <p>Diaz appeared to be leaning towards a rematch with Masvidal rather than colliding with McGregor again.</p>
      <p>"If you’re the baddest motherf***** you're going to take that as a win?" Diaz said.</p>
      <p>"It’s just like when I fought Conor [McGregor]. It was a win, and it was fair game, but I wasn’t finished. He knows I wasn’t finished. I was ready to rock.</p>
      <p>"That’s my plan, that’s my next move; I would love to run it back, that’s the only thing I want to do. And that’s my full intention for now.</p>
      <p>“But I can already see the f***ery coming. I know how this game works. I gave all the rematches and made names for all these people."</p>
