      <p><a href="http://nme.com/artists/josh-homme">Josh Homme</a> has spoken on whether or not rock supergroup <a href="http://nme.com/artists/them-crooked-vultures">Them Crooked Vultures</a> will ever release any new music.</p>

      <p>Formed in 2009, the group consisted of the <a href="http://nme.com/artists/queens-of-the-stone-age">Queens of The Stone Age</a> frontman, <a href="http://nme.com/artists/foo-fighters">Foo Fighters</a>‘ <a href="http://nme.com/artists/dave-grohl">Dave Grohl</a> and <a href="http://nme.com/artists/led-zeppelin">Led Zeppelin</a>’s <a href="http://nme.com/artists/john-paul-jones">John Paul Jones</a>.</p>
      <p>While they haven’t performed together in over a decade, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/dave-grohl-them-crooked-vultures-reunion-2539241">Grohl recently said that fans shouldn’t rule out the possibility of the group joining forces once more.</a></p>
      <p>“Technically we’re still a band,” he explained. “We practise once every decade, and we’re coming up on another decade, aren’t we? I don’t have any official news but there’s always something cooking.”</p>
      <p>Homme has now weighed in, saying he’s always ready to get things going again with the band.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/josh-homme-desert-sessions-interview-902444/"><i>Rolling Stone</i></a>, he said: “The ironic thing is that we all want to do another Vultures record and I think everyone has certain roles they play in the Vultures, and in all honesty, I feel like [that’s] part of Dave’s role — since he got it together the first time by saying, ‘Hey, do you wanna try this?’ — I feel like that’s part of in his job description in Vultures. I have my various things that I’m supposed to do I think, but that isn’t one of them.”</p>
      <p>Going on to say that he is open to doing more Them Crooked Vultures music, he said: “I’m always ready to be in Them Crooked Vultures again. I don’t chase, you know.”</p>
      <p>“I think, ultimately, these things happen when they’re supposed to, and I don’t have much experience in forcing things to happen like that,” he added. “When you’re playing music, people come together because they want to and not from a sense of need or desperation. I think that’s the best reason to come together.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/josh-homme-says-queens-of-the-stone-age-could-be-scaling-back-on-future-tours-2561023">Josh Homme has said that Queens Of The Stone Age are likely to scale back on massive world tours in future.</a></p>
      <p>After concluding touring for 2017’s ‘Villains’, Homme says he was left feeling burnt out by the globe-trotting jaunt.</p>
