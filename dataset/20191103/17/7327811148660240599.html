      <p>STUART, Florida (WABC) -- Officials say the pilot killed in a plane crash ahead of a Florida air show was a doctor from New Jersey.</p>
      <p>Dr. Joseph Masessa, a dermatologist, worked at five locations across northern New Jersey, as well as an office in Florida.</p>
      <p>Masessa was scheduled to take part in the Stuart Air Show this weekend.</p>
      <p>Martin County Fire Rescue Bureau Chief Chris Kammel says the pilot was running a practice routine at Witham Field when the plane went nose down into the runway.</p>
      <p>Witnesses reported seeing a large plume of black smoke at the crash site. The fire was quickly extinguished.</p>
      <p>The NTSB is investigating the cause of the crash.</p>
      <p>Organizers of the air show described Masessa as a beloved performer, and Sunday's show was being dedicated to him and another aviator.</p>
      <p>But the show was canceled Sunday out of safety concerns due to continuing rain.</p>
