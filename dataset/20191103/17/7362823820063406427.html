      <h1>Olivia Newton-John’s iconic ‘Grease’ outfit sells for $405G at auction</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T17:16:42+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 17:16</time> by <a rel="author">Ebony Bowden</a></address>
      <p>The skin-tight pants and black leather jacket <a href="https://pagesix.com/tag/olivia-newton-john/">Olivia Newton-John</a> wore in 1978’s “Grease” have sold for $405,000 at auction — nearly twice what they <a href="https://pagesix.com/2019/10/30/olivia-newton-johns-iconic-grease-outfit-up-for-auction/">were expected to fetch</a>.</p>
      <p>An unnamed buyer on Saturday shelled out $243,200 for the jacket and $162,500 for the pants made famous by the four-time Grammy Award-winning actress in the hit film’s “You’re the One that I Want,” finale.</p>
      <p>Martin Nolan, executive director of Julien’s Auctions, which hosted the event, told The Post last week he expected the items to sell for $260,000 — just over what the buyer paid for Newton-John’s leather jacket alone.</p>

      <p>“If you ask Olivia, she thinks it’ll go for a million dollars,” Nolan said Wednesday of the outfit. “It’s so iconic, I wouldn’t be surprised.”</p>
      <p>“She wore them a couple weeks ago — they still fit,” he added.</p>

      <p>The slinky pants actually predate the film by nearly two decades. In an interview with Reuters last week, Newton-John said the zipper on the pants, made in the 1950s, was broken and she had to be sewn into them for the film.</p>
      <p>The sexy outfit was among 500 items the Australia-born actress, now 71, auctioned to raise funds for her breast cancer charity. Newton-John is currently in her third battle with the disease.</p>
      <p>Also up for auction was Newton-John’s custom Pink Ladies jacket embroidered with “Sandy,” the name of her character in the movie, a signed “Grease” script, and her white cowboy boots from the 1980 flick “Xanadu.”</p>

      <p>“I’ve realized over the years, especially when you go through stuff, that stuff isn’t what’s important,” she told Reuters of her decision to auction off the items.</p>
