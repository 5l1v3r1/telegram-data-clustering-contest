      <p>Baghdad (AFP) - Iran has worked to turn sweeping anti-government protests in Iraq from a threat to its hard-earned influence over its neighbour into an opportunity for political gains, analysts say.</p>
      <p>In Lebanon too, where similar rallies against corruption and government inefficiency have broken out, Iran's main ally Hezbollah has managed to maintain its influence.</p>
      <p>"Very clearly, Iran in both Lebanon and Iraq wants to protect the system and not allow it to fall apart," said Renad Mansour, researcher at London-based Chatham House.</p>
      <p>In both countries "it considers the demands of protesters potentially destabilising," he told AFP.</p>
      <p>In Iraq, many demonstrators calling for an overhaul to the political system over the past month have pointed at Tehran as its primary sponsor -- a worrying accusation for Iranian officials.</p>
      <p>The leaders in Iran "are probably at peak influence and don't want anything to change, because it's exactly where they want to be," said Michael Knights, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute.</p>
      <p>For decades, Iran has carefully crafted ties to a vast range of Iraq political and military actors, from Shiite opponents of ex-dictator Saddam Hussein to Kurdish factions in the north and even Sunni tribes in the west.</p>
      <p>It therefore can play a crucial mediating role in Iraq's political crises, and Qasem Soleimani, who heads the Iranian Revolutionary Guards' elite Quds Force, often visits Baghdad during such times.</p>
      <p>Tehran also backs many of the factions in Iraq's Hashed al-Shaabi paramilitary force, which was formed in 2014 to fight the Islamic State group.</p>
      <p>And it sells crucial electricity and natural gas to supplement Iraq's gutted power sector and is Baghdad's second-biggest source of other imports, from fruit to carpets and cars.</p>
      <p>- 'Palm of Iran's hand' -</p>
      <p>The political and economic sway is perhaps more valuable than ever amid Washington's efforts to isolate and economically handicap Iran.</p>
      <p>The leaders in Tehran "have absolutely everything to lose and will do anything to defend it," said Knights.</p>
      <p>"In the course of that, they are exposing their hand and their allies, and building even greater anger towards them."</p>
      <p>Since protests erupted on October 1 in Iraq, many demonstrators have accused Iran of propping up the corrupt, inefficient system they want to overthrow.</p>
      <p>One in five Iraqis live below the poverty line and youth unemployment stands at 25 percent, despite the vast oil wealth of OPEC's second-largest crude producer.</p>
      <p>"All our leaders are in the palm of Iran's hand," said Azhar, a 21-year-old protester in Baghdad's Tahrir Square.</p>
      <p>In unprecedented displays of anti-Iran sentiment, demonstrators chanted "Out, out, Iran! Baghdad will stay free!"</p>
      <p>Online footage showed Iraqis hitting pictures of Soleimani with their shoes, a severe insult in the region.</p>
      <p>The criticism caught Iran's attention, and Soleimani has visited Iraq multiple times over the past five weeks to "advise" factions on how to respond, sources told AFP.</p>
      <p>"He's running the show," said a government official.</p>
      <p>"They agreed on a way to deal with protesters that allows the current political leadership to stay," another source with knowledge of Soleimani's visits said.</p>
      <p>One such meeting blocked a potential deal between paramilitary chief Hadi al-Ameri and populist cleric Moqtada Sadr to oust Prime Minister Adel Abdel Mahdi, sources said.</p>
      <p>But parties appear to have closed rank around the embattled premier again, maintaining the status quo.</p>
      <p>And amid the chaos of protests, several military commanders seen as close to the United States have been sidelined.</p>
      <p>"Iran has tightened its grip considerably and become much more bold," said Knights.</p>
      <p>- Lebanon erupts -</p>
      <p>A week before the resumption of Iraq's anti-government rallies on October 24, another Middle Eastern country erupted in anger at systemic corruption: Lebanon.</p>
      <p>Lebanon's government is dominated by the allies of Shiite armed movement Hezbollah, through which Iran exerts significant influence.</p>
      <p>"Hezbollah has never had it this good," said Amal Saad, a Hezbollah expert and professor at the Lebanese University.</p>
      <p>But after rallies unexpectedly erupted across Lebanon, including in the party's strongholds, Hezbollah now has to deal with forming a new government after the previous one resigned.</p>
      <p>"Hezbollah and Iran are in a precarious situation", Saad said, "because of the government's resignation and efforts to boot them out."</p>
      <p>Criticism of the movement's chief Hassan Nasrallah even aired on the Hezbollah-run Al-Manar TV, which was previously unimaginable for its propaganda arm.</p>
      <p>After initially backing the protests, Nasrallah said his party would not back the government's resignation, which he said would lead to a dangerous political vacuum.</p>
      <p>Party loyalists have also launched counter-demonstrations, sparking scuffles with protesters and journalists.</p>
      <p>Despite the initial threat, said analyst Qassem Qassir, the party is as strong as ever.</p>
      <p>"It may have lost some morale or taken a hit in the media, but its strength remains," Qassir told AFP.</p>
