      <p>MIAMI (AP) — Duncan Robinson scored 23 points, Meyers Leonard added 21 and the Miami Heat led by as many as 41 points on the way to an easy 129-100 win over the Houston Rockets on Sunday night.</p>
      <p>Jimmy Butler scored 18 points and had nine assists for the Heat, and James Johnson scored 17 in his season debut. Miami is 5-1, matching the best six-game start in franchise history.</p>
      <p>James Harden scored 29 for Houston, while Russell Westbrook was held to only 10. The Heat had 38 assists to Houston’s 19, in a game that was decided very early.</p>
      <p>It was a record-setting opening quarter for the Heat — resulting in the third-biggest lead after 12 minutes in the NBA’s shot-clock era, starting with the 1954-55 season.</p>
      <p>Miami led 46-14 after that first quarter. The only bigger leads after one quarter since the shot clock was put into play came when the Los Angeles Lakers led the Sacramento Kings 40-4 after one quarter on Feb. 4, 1987, and the Baltimore Bullets leading the Kansas City-Omaha Kings 45-12 after one quarter on Dec. 9, 1972.</p>
      <p>It was the biggest margin by which the Heat had outscored an opponent in any quarter — and the biggest margin by which the Rockets had ever been outscored in a period. Miami outscored New York by 28 in the first quarter on Jan. 22, 2007; the then-San Diego Rockets were outscored by 28 against Atlanta in the third quarter on Feb. 11, 1970.</p>
      <p>Advertising</p>
      <p>The lead was 59-18 four minutes into the second quarter. Houston got within 25 points by halftime, but no closer from there.</p>
      <p>Goran Dragic scored 15 points and Tyler Herro had 12 for Miami. Chris Clemons had 16 and Ben McLemore scored 14 for Houston.</p>
      <p>TIP-INS</p>
      <p>Rockets: Westbrook started 1 for 9 from the field, 0 for 5 from 3-point range — with his first make from beyond the arc coming on a 45-footer that beat the third-quarter buzzer. That got Houston within 99-71. … The Rockets have faced deficits of at least 13 points in four consecutive games — the other three falling well shy of the 41-point hole Houston quickly dug Sunday. … Houston has now lost 13 of its last 17 games in Miami, and trails the all-time series with the Heat 33-32.</p>
      <p>Heat: Miami had a 48-point quarter at New York in 1989 and a 47-point quarter at Boston in 1990. The 46-point quarter was a Heat home record. … Chris Bosh and Ray Allen — who teamed up for one of the biggest plays in NBA Finals history, the rebound and 3-pointer late in Game 6 of the 2013 series against San Antonio — were in attendance. So was Dorell Wright, part of the 2006 Heat NBA championship team. … Justise Winslow (lower back stiffness) missed his second consecutive game. Derrick Jones Jr. (left groin) and KZ Okpala (left Achilles) were inactive.</p>
      <p>HARDEN’S SHOOTING</p>
      <p>Harden was 6 for 14 from the field and 3 for 9 from 3-point range — not great numbers for an elite scorer like him, but his percentages for the season actually rose. He’s up to 37% from the field now through six games, 22% from 3-point range. All-time in Miami, Harden is shooting 39% from the field, 33% from beyond the arc.</p>
      <p>CLEMONS DEBUTS</p>
      <p>Clemons, the third-leading scorer in NCAA Division I men’s history and someone who averaged 30.1 per game as a senior at Campbell last season, made his NBA debut. Clemons scored 3,225 points in 130 college games, and was 5 for 18 from the floor Sunday.</p>
      <p>UP NEXT</p>
      <p>Rockets: At Memphis on Monday, ending a four-game road trip.</p>
      <p>Heat: At Denver on Tuesday, opening a three-game West swing.</p>
