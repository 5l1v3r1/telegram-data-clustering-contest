      <p>Hellas Verona fans had targeted the 29-year-old striker throughout the match, singing racist chants from the stands at the Stadio Marcantonio Bentegodi.</p>
      <p>By the 50th minute, Balotelli could stand it no more. He booted the ball into the area where the racist chanting could be heard, and attempted to storm off the pitch.</p>

      <p>Balotelli had to be calmed by both teammates and opponents, who persuaded him to remain on the pitch, <i><a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11854/11853280/mario-balotelli-kicks-ball-towards-fans-after-racist-abuse">Sky Sports</a></i> reported.</p>
      <p>Referee Maurizio Mariani stopped play in the 54th minute, with a message read out over the PA system ordering the racists to stop their offensive chants. Mariani initially issued Balotelli with a yellow card, however this was later rescinded.</p>
      <p>Balotelli bravely returned to the pitch and continued with the match. Not only this, but he excelled, scoring a goal in the 84th minute despite having undergone the cruel taunts.</p>

      <p>According to a tweet from <i><a href="https://twitter.com/GFFN/status/1082337617201504258">Get French Football News</a></i>, Balotelli opened up earlier this year about his personal experiences of racist abuse.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Speaking about his childhood in Brescia, Balotelli said:</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>When you are young, you don’t understand why other kids are being mean. How do you tell a 5-year old what racism is? If you do that, you ruin their childhood in my opinion.<br/><br/>I remember at school, a kid asked me laughing if I had a white or black heart. I remember saying to him, I don’t know. I asked my mum and dad and they explained to me that my birth parents were from Africa &amp; that all Africans were black, but not different.</blockquote>
      <p>
        <b>He continued:</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>Where I grew up, in Brescia, there were maybe 4 or 5 black kids in the whole town. In football, I would always be left out, even at school. Then I had a different character to others also. If anything ever went wrong, it was my fault. Little things like that.<br/><br/>When I was 13 or 14, I heard my first racist insults. I was arguing with someone on the pitch &amp; then it started: ‘Oh look it is the n***** . Go back to your country’.</blockquote>

      <p>The match ended with Brescia losing 2-1 to Hellas Verona. The post-match discussion, however, centred around Balotelli’s reaction as well as the wider issue of racism in football.</p>

      <p>According to statistics from anti-racism charity <a href="https://www.kickitout.org/pages/faqs/category/reporting-statistics">Kick It Out</a>, racism is on the rise in football, with a 43% rise in reported incidents from 2017/18 to 2018/19.</p>
