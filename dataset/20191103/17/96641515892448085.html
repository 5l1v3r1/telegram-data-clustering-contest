      <h1>Tesla Autopilot now recognizes traffic cones</h1>
      <h2>Your car shouldn't plow into pylons -- if the feature works as promised.</h2>

      <p>Tesla's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/06/21/iihs-driver-assistance-study/">Autopilot</a> has been adept at recognizing other cars on the road, but those aren't the only things you have to worry about on the road -- what about the traffic cones that wall you off from roadwork? You can relax after today... well, for the most part. Tesla is quietly <a href="https://electrek.co/2019/11/03/tesla-driving-visualization-detect-traffic-cones/">rolling out</a> an Autopilot update that lets its electric cars detect and display pylons on the road. If you're using <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/01/16/tesla-navigate-on-autopilot-model-3-road-trip/">Navigate on Autopilot</a>, your EV will even plan lane changes to avoid cones so that you don't have to take control around construction work.</p>
      <p>You may not want to put all your trust in the feature just yet. Some early users have <a href="https://twitter.com/rpingar/status/1188910654935183361">warned</a> that Autopilot doesn't always recognize the cones, potentially leading to dangerous lane changes -- say, steering you into oncoming traffic or construction. Tesla did remind drivers that they're "required to pay attention at all times," though, so it knows this isn't a substitute for keeping your eyes open.</p>
      <p>This is still an important step for Tesla. It still intends to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/10/01/tesla-buys-deepscale/">enable full self-driving</a> in the future, and that will require cars that can recognize and deal with virtually any road object. A seemingly small update like this could go a long way toward true hands-free driving.</p>
