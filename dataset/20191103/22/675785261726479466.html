      <h1>OAPs praise Labour's pledge to fight for free TV licences for over-75s</h1>
      <h2>The Mirror took to the streets of Leeds to hear from the people most affected by the Conservative ploy to remove free TV licences from those over 75</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T22:25:22+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 22:25</time> by <a rel="author">Ben Glaze, https://www.facebook.com/MirrorPolitics, Nathan Sandhu</a></address>
      <p>The Mirror visited Leeds to find out what OAPs thought of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> ’s <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/free-tv-licences-over-75s-20803772">election pledge</a> to re-instate free TV licences for the over-75s if Jeremy Corbyn wins the election.</p>
      <p>Retired weaver William Lowery, 76, of Leeds, said: “I have just got to the age where I’m eligible to get a free TV licence so to take that away now would be a huge shame.</p>
      <p>“It’s one of the benefits of getting old and is often a lifeline for people my age.</p>
      <p>"The TV is a great way of keeping in touch with the outside world and my house would be a lonely place without one.</p>

      <p>“To have to pay for a TV licence – when at least 60% of what is on offer is of no relevance – is outrageous.</p>
      <p>“I’m happy that Labour have decided to stick up for pensioners so fingers crossed. I’m quietly optimistic anyway.”</p>
      <p>Retired assurance manager Alex Deans, 85, from Norfolk, said: “I watch the TV most evenings with my wife and it’s a way of staying up to date with social affairs.</p>
      <p>“A free TV licence is one of the only good things about getting old, taking that away is just yet another sign of disrespect to old age pensioners.</p>
      <p>“All parties go back on their word so it didn’t come as a surprise that the Conservatives broke their promise but that doesn’t make it any more less disappointing.</p>
      <p>“There is nothing between the parties and Labour pledging to save free TV licences doesn’t go far enough and isn’t a game-changer for me.”</p>

      <p>Property business owner Michael Rollins, 75, of Leeds, said: “I don’t mind paying for a TV licence but there are so many vulnerable pensioners who aren’t in the same position.</p>
      <p>“You are cheating them out of a huge part of their retirement, especially if they are on their own.</p>
      <p>“Pledging to protect the free TV licence is not enough for me to vote Labour but it’s a step in the right direction.</p>
      <p>“The only way I would vote Labour is if <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jeremy-corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a> was no longer leader.</p>
      <p>“A TV constitutes a societal and emotional outlet for pensioners. You are not just introducing charges, you are potentially taking away a lifeline for those that can’t afford it.”</p>

      <p>Retired teacher Geoffrey Hinds, 75, of Bradford, said: “I think free licences are so important for the over-75s and represent a bridge between them and society.</p>
      <p>“It’s about caring for those of a certain age who could be isolated and lonely.</p>
      <p>"It’s about giving something back to recompense those who have worked all of their lives and contributed.</p>
      <p>“It’s not the first time the Conservatives have broken a manifesto promise and it won’t be the last.</p>
      <p>“Labour’s pledge for a lot of people struggling will be a great thing but it’s not enough for me to vote in their favour.</p>
      <p>“There are even more pressing issues which the party needs to be on the right side of first.”</p>

      <p>Retired design manager Martin Cowburn, 75, and his wife Ruth Cowburn, 75, a retired interior designer, who live in Leeds, said: “Those of us who have saved for our retirement are again being made to lose out.</p>
      <p>“I’m disgusted, to say the least, as the BBC programming is largely made up of repeats that I rarely watch the channels anyway, but I will still have to pay for a licence.</p>
      <p>“A TV is, however, the main way of staying connected and up to date with current affairs.</p>
      <p>“It’s great that Labour is promising to save free TV licences but I would need to see it to believe it because I don’t really trust any party at the minute.”</p>
      <p>Brian Radcliffe, 77, a retired office manager, and his wife Arlene Radcliffe, 80, a retired officer worker, from Leeds, said: “We don’t watch an awful lot of TV but that’s another reason we shouldn’t have to pay for it.</p>
      <p>“The money quoted for a TV licence per year doesn’t sound a lot but it all adds up and we will have to make cut backs in other spending to compensate for it.</p>
      <p>“Labour’s pledge won’t swing my vote because it’s not a strong enough policy, I will make my mind up nearer the election.</p>
      <p>“However, I assume every over-75 will vote against the Conservatives because of its stance on licences.</p>
      <p>“Fortunately me and my wife try to get out as much as we can but a TV is often the only contact the over-75s have with the outside world. Taking away free licences is criminal.”</p>
