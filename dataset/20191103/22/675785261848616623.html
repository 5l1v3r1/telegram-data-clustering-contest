      <p>She’s practically perfect in every way, having taught a workaholic father to spend more time with his kids and two naughty children to tidy their room.</p>
      <p>So it’s no surprise, Dame Julie Andrews thinks Mary Poppins is just the woman to sort out  <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a> .</p>
      <p>Speaking at the Southbank Centre in London, when asked how differently he would have turned out if he had had a nanny like the no-nonsense Disney character.</p>
      <p>There’s no doubt she finds the President the opposite of supercalifragilisticexpialidocious, she said: “Oh Mary Poppins would have shaped him up.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"God knows, if only we had the chance to try. “</p>
      <p>The 84-year-old Oscar-winning actress previously blasted Trump for cutting funding to the arts describing it as “mind-boggling” and said she was “deeply disturbed” by him pulling America out of the Paris Climate Agreement.</p>
      <p>The veteran star’s career has spanned 70 years including Mary Poppins, The Sound of Music and The Princess Diaries</p>
      <p>She went on to work with her second husband, Blake Edward who she was with for 41 years before his death in 2010.</p>
      <p>They worked together on numerous films including Victor/Victoria and Darli Lili.</p>

      <p>Julie revealed her film maker husband often gave her advice on set – even on her love scenes.</p>
      <p>She explained: “I was doing a love scene with Rock Hudson. The first time Blake really said it. We were passionately kissing and carrying on and he said: ‘That’s lovely, darling, but I know that you can do it better.”</p>
      <p>Hope he delivered that news with a spoonful of sugar.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Dame Julie <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/dame-julie-andrews-admits-needed-20793850">recently revealed</a> she needed therapy following the success of Mary Poppins.</p>
      <p>The British star scooped a best actress Academy Award for her role as the magical nanny in her first Hollywood film aged 29.</p>
      <p>Looking back she said: “l kept the Oscar in the attic for a very long time because I thought I’d been given it as a ‘Welcome to Hollywood’ and I didn’t feel worthy of it.</p>
      <p>"So much early success sent me into therapy and analysis. I learnt you have to do it right and honour the films you are making. It’s a huge gift, but a lot of obligation.”</p>
