      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: Labour reveals election pledge to save free TV licences for the over 75s</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T22:13:35+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 22:13</time> by <a rel="author">Ben Glaze, https://www.facebook.com/MirrorPolitics</a></address>
      <p>Free TV licences for over-75s will be saved if Labour wins the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/general-election">general election</a>.</p>
      <p>Deputy Leader Tom Watson pledged to protect the benefit if <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> returns to power when voter go to the polls on December 12.</p>
      <p>Millions of pensioners face being stripped of the vital lifeline from June after the Conservatives axed a 2017 manifesto commitment.</p>
      <p>But Shadow Culture Secretary Mr Watson told the Mirror: “The Tory decision to scrap free TV licences for over-75s is utterly callous.</p>
      <p>“Four in 10 older people say the TV is their main source of company, but from next year 3.7 million older people will lose their free TV licence.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>“It’s disgraceful. Our message is clear - vote Labour to save free TV licences.”</p>
      <p>The Conservatives promised at the 2017 election to protect the benefit for the rest of the Parliament, which had been due to run until 2022.</p>
      <p>But the BBC had already been handed responsibility for funding the lifeline from June 2020, under a deal stitched up in 2015.</p>
      <p>It says that continuing to fund free licences would have cost £745million - a fifth of its budget - by 2021-22.</p>
      <p>That is equivalent to what it spends in total on BBC2, BBC3, BBC4, the BBC News Channel, and children’s stations CBBC and CBeebies.</p>
      <p>The corporation plans to curb the benefit, meaning just 1.5 million OAPs are likely to continue receiving free licences when restrictions take effect next Spring.</p>
      <p>From June, only over-75s receiving Pension Credit will be eligible - meaning 80% of over-75s, some 3.7 million OAPs, will have to stump up to watch their favourite shows.</p>
      <p>The Mirror is campaigning to save the lifeline, with more than 18,000 readers backing the fight by completing coupons in the paper.</p>
      <p>More than 600,000 have signed Age UK’s Switched Off petition calling for free licences to be preserved and the Government to take back responsibility for funding.</p>

      <p>Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown and Royle Family actor Ricky Tomlinson have supported the battle.</p>
      <p>Ricky, 80, said: “I absolutely agree with what Tom Watson’s saying.</p>
      <p>“It’s an absolute disgrace to try and withdraw the TV licences.</p>
      <p>“It’s all they have got, some of them depend on their television for their news, for finding out what’s going on.</p>
      <p>“Some people are lonely, they are locked away in these little places on their own.</p>
      <p>“It is common sense what Labour is announcing - we are supposed to look after the old aged pensioners.</p>
      <p>“Why do we take away from the people that have got nothing in the first place?”</p>
      <p>Mr Brown, as Chancellor, introduced free TV licences for over-75s in 1999 - meaning that for two decades the age group has been spared having to dig deep to switch on their sets.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>Rattled PM Mr Johnson tried to head off criticism of his party’s betrayal, admitting: “This needs sorting out urgently and I’ll be talking to the BBC about how to sort that out.”</p>
      <p>He has repeatedly tried to dodge blame for the row - and previously claimed he would “put the screws” on the BBC over free TV licences.</p>
      <p>Speaking in August, he told the Mirror: “The BBC received a settlement that was conditional upon their paying for TV licences for the over-75s.</p>
      <p>“They should cough up.”</p>
      <p>Piling pressure on parties to commit to saving the benefit - currently worth £154.50 a year - Age UK Charity Director Caroline Abrahams said: “The general election is a perfect opportunity to ensure that whoever forms the next Government, they take steps to keep TV licences free for all over-75s.</p>
      <p>“The current Government’s decision to abandon this highly-valued universal entitlement - that’s been in place for a generation - has caused real dismay, prompting approaching a million people of all ages to sign petitions.</p>
      <p>“Many older people are especially worried and angry about this issue.</p>
      <p>“TV is the main form of companionship for two in five over-75s and much more than a box in the corner of the room – it is a precious window on the world and often their main source of news, entertainment and company.</p>
      <p>“We call on all the parties to include the funding of free TV licences in their pledges at this election.</p>
      <p>“There’s no doubt that vast numbers of older people care deeply about this and are waiting eagerly to see if our politicians will stand by them in this way.”</p>

      <p>Bectu broadcasting union boss Philippa Childs said: “An imminent general election provides the opportunity for all parties to commit to funding the over-75s TV licence as it is a welfare benefit.</p>
      <p>“The current Government pledged to do so in 2017 yet has failed to deliver this by passing the buck.</p>
      <p>“It is not the role of the BBC to determine who should and shouldn’t get a free licence.”</p>
      <p>A BBC spokesman said previously: “It was the Government who decided to stop funding free TV licences for the over-75s and Parliament gave responsibility to the BBC to make a decision on the future of the scheme.</p>
      <p>“There was no guarantee that the BBC would continue to fund free licences for the over-75s, as the Culture Secretary at the time has confirmed.</p>
      <p>“We’ve reached the fairest decision we can in funding free TV licences for the poorest pensioners, while protecting BBC services.”</p>
