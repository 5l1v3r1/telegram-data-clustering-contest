      <p>A camera has captured one of the world's rarest cats 'playing like a kitten' on a hillside in the Russian Far East.</p>
      <p>The wild Amur leopard was filmed by a camera trap in Land of the Leopard National Park in Primorsky Krai in rare footage released on Friday.</p>
      <p>According to the press service of the National park, "despite his old age, the male leopard showed excellent health and a playful Friday mood. In front of the camera, the predator played like a domestic kitten."</p>
      <p>The Land of the Leopard National Park has 400 such camera traps, which help experts monitor the animals’ health and behaviour.</p>
      <p>The park was set up in 2012 to save the Amur leopard, which was on the verge of extinction. There only 120 Amur 'Siberian' leopards living in eastern.</p>

      <p>Earlier this month, an Amur leopard was captured on camera as it demonstrated its extreme</p>
      <p>The Siberian leopards often owe their survival to their ability to hide so well among the trees.</p>
      <p>But tragically there are only 120 living in the wild in their natural habitat in eastern Russia after decades of poaching.</p>

      <p>The rare animal was snapped at the Land of the Leopard Nature Reserve, a national park set up by the Kremlin to save this species, <a href="https://siberiantimes.com/other/others/news/spot-the-rare-amur-leopard-the-worlds-most-endangered-big-cat-hiding-in-this-picture">reported The Siberian Times</a> .</p>
      <p>At the last count, there are only 86 adults and 21 adolescents known to be living in the wild.</p>
      <p>A century ago, this big cat roamed the Korean peninsula, several provinces of China, as well as regions in eastern Russia.</p>

      <p>But by 2007 only 30 Amur leopards were counted in the wild in the Russian Far East and extinction seemed all but inevitable.</p>
      <p>But the species had an unexpected population boom in 2016 after 16 cubs were spotted in a nature reserve set up by <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/vladimir-putin">Vladimir Putin</a> .</p>
      <p>Camera traps in the 1,000 square mile Land of the Leopard National Park counted the new arrivals, including three born to a leopardess named Queen Borte - after the famously fertile first wife of Genghis Khan - by Hollywood action hero Steven Seagal.</p>

      <p>The flurry of births and also tougher penalties on poachers have helped the population grow.</p>
      <p>Penalties were imposed against poachers seeking the skins of leopards and also Siberian tigers, also an endangered species.</p>
