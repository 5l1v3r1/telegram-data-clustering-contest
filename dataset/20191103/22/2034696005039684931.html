      <p>The second annual Dia De Los <a href="http://nme.com/artists/deftones">Deftones</a> festival took place last night (November 2) and Chino Moreno and the gang gave fans something special to remember.</p>

      <p>Taking to the stage at San Diego’s Petco Park, the band added the rare ‘Eros’ track ‘Smile’ to their set list, giving the song its live debut.</p>
      <p>‘Eros’ is the album that Deftones were recording at the time their late bassist Chi Cheng was involved in a car crash in 2008. He remained in a semi-comatose state for several years, and so the group decided to shelve the album and start fresh with fill-in bassist Sergio Vega, eventually returning with ‘Diamond Eyes’ in 2010.</p>
      <p>Cheng passed away in 2013 and ‘Eros’ has remained unreleased to this day. In 2014, on the one-year anniversary of Cheng’s death, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/deftones-25-1233014">Moreno shared a studio version of ‘Smile’</a>, the only track to ever be liberated from the album.</p>
      <p>Performing it live for the first time last night, Moreno told the crowd before playing it: “This one’s for my man, Cheng.”</p>
      <p>Watch a clip of the performance below:</p>

      <p>Elsewhere on the setlist, the band played a lot of fan favourites and performed ‘Romantic Dreams’ for the first time since their 2013 touring of ‘Koi No Yokan’.</p>
