      <p>The couple were offered a bus back to the UK but decided to make their own way home after their ordeal.</p>
      <p>His dad told the BBC: "I feel a bit more could have been done for them.</p>
      <p>"They'll learn a lot from all of this but I'm expecting an emotional response when they get home and it all hits them."</p>
      <p>The incident happened on the A1 motorway, near Saint-Quentin, Somme, just before 12pm local time on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Five patients - three of them British - suffered serious injuries, while the others suffered lighter injuries.</p>
      <p>Fire crews had to cut open part of the coach to free trapped passengers.</p>
      <p>A Foreign Office spokesman said: "We are in contact with the French authorities following a road traffic accident in France and we will do all we can to assist any British people who need our help."</p>
