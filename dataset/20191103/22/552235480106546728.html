      <h2>The long-running sitcom ended this year more than two decades after Jack and Victor first hit our screens.</h2>

      <p>Ford Kiernan says he is “chuffed to bits” after he and his <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/still-game">Still Game</a> co-creator Greg Hemphill were awarded the Outstanding Contribution to Television award at the Scottish Baftas on Sunday night.</p>
      <p>The long-running sitcom ended this year with a run of live shows at Glasgow’s Hydro more than two decades after curmudgeonly pensioner pals Jack and Victor, played by <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/ford-kiernan">Ford</a> and Greg, first hit our screens.</p>

      <p>Ford said: “It’s been 21 years, it’s been ages – it just means a lot to finally get that sort of recognition at the end.</p>
      <p>“We’ve had a couple of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/the-baftas">Baftas</a> before – oh yes – but we’re chuffed to bits to be picking this up tonight. It’s obviously the work of a whole lot of people.”</p>
      <p>Gavin Mitchell, who played Boaby the Barman in the comedy, said: “We’re very chuffed – it’s the icing on our cake after filming the final series and after the Hydro – 51 shows all in all. It feels like the perfect conclusion.</p>
