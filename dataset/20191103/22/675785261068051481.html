      <p>Viewers lavished the BBC's adaptation of His Dark Materials with praise as the series began tonight.</p>
      <p>The epic fantasy, based on the trilogy by author Phillip Pullman, is the most expensive series the BBC has ever screened at £50million.</p>
      <p>And while the complex plot, which is shrouded in religious controversy, left some confused, those who had read the books branded it "wonderful".</p>
      <p>The fantasy adventure is set in a parallel universe where everyone's souls are manifested in daemons, which are in the form of animals and follow them wherever they go.</p>
