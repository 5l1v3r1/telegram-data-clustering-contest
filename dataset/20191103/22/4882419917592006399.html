      <p>Riqui Puig spoke on Sunday after Barcelona B's draw with Andorra at the Johan Cruyff stadium and said he wants more protagonism at the club.</p>
      <p>"I'd like to have more minutes (up a level) and if I see I won't get them I'll have to take a decision," he said in the mixed zone.</p>
      <p>"In theory I didn't plan to leave on loan in the winter window, but we'll see."</p>
      <p>The player also thinks that opponents use excessive force when trying to stop him. "This year there have been a lot of cases when the have come for me, I don't know if it's at club level or federation (RFEF) but they have to do something, because one day I'll end up injured."</p>
