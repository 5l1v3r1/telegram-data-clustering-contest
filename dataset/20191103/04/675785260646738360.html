      <p>She has been a fan of the colourful creatures since the age of four and now has more than 2,000 of them, reports the <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/latest-news/woman-8k-plastic-pony-selection-20794143">Daily Star</a> .</p>

      <p>She said: “I know a 36-year-old woman collecting toys might seem a bit crazy, but I don’t care. I go silly for those fillies."</p>
      <p>While her partner Ian Langston, 58, supports her unusual hobby, he had a long face when Miranda told him they needed to move house so she could have space for her extensive collection.</p>
      <p>Designer Miranda said: "Ian doesn’t really get it, but he does his best and has driven me miles to pick up ponies.</p>
      <p>"When I told him we needed to move house I could tell he thought I was horsing around. I loved our three bedroom semi. We’d been there for three years and had no plans to move. But then the boxes started piling up.</p>
      <p>"I was desperate for somewhere with space for a whole room dedicated to my My Little Ponies, so they could all be displayed and not packed away.</p>

      <p>"It was tough convincing Ian to sell up but he agreed for a quiet life."</p>
      <p>Miranda went on: "Now I’m so happy with my display room.</p>
      <p>"It’s where I show off all my ponies – from my most expensive, Mimic, which set me back £120, to a mint-in-box pony which I picked up for only £5."</p>
      <p>Miranda says her 'pony room' is the mane attraction at her new pad in Lowestoft, Suffolk.</p>
      <p>She added: "Some people must have thought I was mad."</p>
      <p>"But all my family and friends are really supportive, especially Ian.</p>
