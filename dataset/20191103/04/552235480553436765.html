      <h1>Falkirk FC linked US mogul has property empire registered next to chip shop in Sidcup</h1>
      <h2>Manhattan-based businessman Mark Campbell looked set to take over Falkirk before the deal fell through.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T04:30:00+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">Norman Silvester, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/norman-silvester/</a></address>
      <p>The business empire of a US-based property mogul who failed in his effort to take control of Falkirk FC is registered to an <br/>accountant’s office in the tiny Kent town of Sidcup.</p>
      <p>Mark Campbell’s Markell Real Estate Group occupies one of the world’s glitziest addresses in Manhattan’s Madison Avenue.</p>
      <p>He has also claimed to have lived near New York’s famous Central Park for four years.</p>
      <p>But we can reveal his firms – Markell Real Estate Group, Markell Group, and Markell Land and Property Developments – are all registered at a small firm of financial experts below a block of flats in the English commuter town.</p>
      <p>MKS Accountants’ neighbours include a barber’s, fish and chip shop, Costa Coffee and a Co-Op.</p>
      <p>The list is a far cry from the glamorous designer boutiques and landmarks surrounding Campbell’s base in the Big Apple.</p>

      <p>It was announced on Friday that negotiations between <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/falkirk-fc">Falkirk</a> and Campbell had ended.</p>
      <p>They had been locked in talks since August.</p>
      <p>Campbell had been the preferred bidder by Falkirk’s current owners in July and said he was in pole position to take over the running of the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scotland-football-team">Scottish League One </a>club.</p>
      <p>He promised to invest up to £10million to develop the stadium and pay the £350,000 needed to take a controlling 62 per cent share in the club.</p>
      <p>Fans’ group Back The Bairns had concerns over his business past. But he vowed to live in Scotland if he got ownership. He was made bankrupt in 2010 after running a pub. At the time he was described as unemployed and living in Bexley, Kent.</p>
      <p>Campbell failed in a bid to buy <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/sunderland-afc">Sunderland AFC</a> earlier this year.</p>

      <p>Last month we revealed he has been ordered to appear in a New York court over claims he <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/sexual-harrassment">sexually harassed</a> a female employee.</p>
      <p>The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, alleged he made repeated unwanted advances towards her when he was her boss at Markell Real Estate Group.</p>
      <p>The summons for him to appear was served at his firm’s offices in Manhattan last month.</p>
      <p>She alleges when she rejected his sexual advances, he accused her of stealing and sacked her.</p>
      <p>She also claims he asked to buy lingerie for her and made inappropriate remarks about her appearance.</p>
      <p>Campbell has denied the claims against him.</p>

      <p>After talks collapsed, Falkirk FC said: “Unfortunately, we have not been able to reach agreement on all matters. We will continue to seek investment.”</p>
      <p>When contacted Campbell said: “The building we use in Madison Avenue is not in a pristine area. We’re not in the best part. There are in excess of 500 companies in the building and we pay a monthly rent.</p>
      <p>“I have an apartment near Central Park but I am not ­resident in the USA.</p>
      <p>“I know Sidcup very well. I was raised there. The firm of accountants we use moved there from London about four years ago and is very respected.”</p>
      <p>He claimed his 2010 ­bankruptcy was related to the break-up of his marriage.</p>
      <p>He said he’d not been ­personally served with court papers in the ­harassment action.</p>
      <p>He added: “That’s now being contested.”</p>
