      <h2>Australian firm Macquarie – which leads the PFI-style private consortium that built the 'ghost' hospital – was involved in Aaron Wan-Bissaka move to Old Trafford from Crystal Palace.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T04:30:00+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">John Ferguson, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/john-ferguson/</a></address>
      <p>The bank behind the scandal-hit Royal Hospital for Children in Edinburgh helped to finance the £50million transfer of a Premier League footballer.</p>
      <p>Manchester United bought defender Aaron Wan-Bissaka from Crystal Palace in the summer – but it has emerged Australian firm Macquarie was involved in the deal.</p>
      <p>It lent Palace £22.5million to cover an instalment not due from United until next year.</p>
      <p>The transaction would have been brokered about the same time it was revealed that NHS Lothian’s new sick kids facility <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/scandal-edinburgh-sick-kids-ghost-20064715">would not be able to open</a> because of safety concerns.</p>
      <p>The hospital was built by a PFI-style private consortium led by Macquarie.</p>
      <p>Labour’s health spokeswoman Monica Lennon said: “It’s ridiculous that bankers and private shareholders are making millions from the Sick Kids fiasco.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“This has been a very bad deal for the public who are stuck with a ghost hospital while one of the companies involved has quickly moved on to profit from ever more creative finance deals.</p>
      <p>“This is yet more evidence why the SNP’s version of PFI must be shown the red card.”</p>
      <p>A public inquiry was ordered last month after patients were unable to move into the Royal Hospital for Children in July over safety <br/>concerns.</p>
      <p>The hospital is not expected to be fully operational until next autumn.</p>
      <p>Despite the hold-up, £1.4million of taxpayers’ money is being paid to Intergrated Health Solutions Lothian (IHSL) every month in contract repayments.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Minutes of an NHS Lothian board meeting revealed last week show there were 2000 snagging issues with the hospital.</p>
      <p>Documents also showed that a planned legal challenge was dropped in favour of paying IHSL <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/anger-nhs-pays-out-31million-20712835">£11.6million</a> to settle the outstanding issues – a move approved by the Scottish Government.</p>
      <p>Last month, the Sunday Mail revealed how Macquarie used another major private finance project to generate £392million. Macquarie was criticised over the figure it made on the back of the building of the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/bank-behind-edinburgh-sick-kids-20566220">M6 toll road in the Midlands in 2006.</a></p>
      <p>The Australian finance group, which was the project’s owner at the time, rearranged debt facilities “releasing” the money, prompting claims of a PFI rip-off.</p>
      <p>It emerged last week more problems with electrical and fire systems at Edinburgh’s hospital have been found.</p>
      <p>A report into safety issues has identified “major” issues in critical care areas.</p>
      <p>It has been reported a lack of qualified staff for electrical installation was identified by the NHS review.</p>
      <p>The National Services Scotland report found problems including a need for mitigation to avoid the failure of the single electrical supply to equipment such as life support systems.</p>
      <p>The Sunday Mail has revealed how lobbying and communications agency <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/secret-lobbying-firm-run-snp-20470255">Charlotte Street Partners</a> – which has strong links to the SNP – is representing IHSL.</p>
      <p>Macquarie said: “Each day we support our different customers in many different ways. These activities have no connection whatsoever.”</p>
