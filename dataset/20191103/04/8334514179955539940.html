      <p>LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Olivia Newton-John’s tight black pants and leather jacket from the movie “Grease” sold for $405,700 at a Beverly Hills auction on Saturday, more than double the expected price, Julien’s Auctions said.</p>
      <p>The outfit that marked the transition of Newton-John’s character in the 1978 musical from demure high schooler to sexy Sandy was among 500 items for sale to help raise money for the performer’s cancer treatment center in Australia.</p>
      <p>The infamous pants worn by Newton-John for the “You’re the One That I Want” duet with John Travolta were so tight that she had to be sewn into them to film the scene, and were sold with a broken zipper. The buyers for the pants and jacket were not revealed.</p>
      <p>The auction raised $2.4 million in total, with many items related to the movie going for many times over estimates, Julien’s said.</p>
      <p>A “Grease” poster signed by Newton-John, Travolta and other cast members sold for $64,000, compared to an estimate of $1,000. The pink lace gown the actress wore to the movie premiere in Los Angeles went for $18,750. A custom Pink Ladies jacket given to the actress by the cast and crew fetched $50,000, 25 times its original estimate.</p>
      <p>The British-born, Australian-raised 71-year-old singer and actress said earlier this year that she was battling breast cancer for a third time since first being diagnosed in 1992.</p>
      <p>After her first bout with cancer, she helped set up the Olivia Newton-John Cancer and Wellness Centre in Melbourne, which aims to support the mind as well as the body.</p>
      <p>All of the proceeds from the “Grease” jacket and pants will benefit the center, as well as a portion of all the other items sold on Saturday.</p>
