      <p>Nazi-obsessed Moors ­murderer Ian Brady became so good at speaking German behind bars that he was tipped to land a job as a translator if he was released.</p>
      <p>Newly declassified files have revealed the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/glasgow">Glasgow</a>-born serial killer received language lessons from a senior university professor while in jail.</p>
      <p>He was also visited <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/prisons">behind bars</a> by future prime minister James ­Callaghan, then the Home ­Secretary.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/brady">Brady</a>, who died in 2017, aged 79, was given German tuition after expressing admiration for ­Hitler and praising the Nazis’ “efficiency”.</p>
      <p>The new records show how prison governors praised his intelligence and hoped the classes would end with him leading a “healthy normal life in society”.</p>
      <p>After he was jailed in 1966 for torturing and killing five children with partner Myra Hindley, Brady told a prison ­chaplain that his crimes were no different to massacres being carried out by US troops in Vietnam.</p>

      <p>A welfare officer noted: “He spoke of his interest in the German language, then on Hitler’s use of oratory and referred to his recordings of these, giving a bleak, cracked grin.”</p>
      <p>Governors believed they could harness his obsession to allow him to lead a new life should he ever be released.</p>
      <p>Two years later, the chief education officer at ­Durham prison said he was excelling in his <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/education">German classes</a>.</p>
      <p>He wrote: “If Brady continues to come along well in his German I see no reason why he should not make a living one day as an interpreter or translator.</p>
      <p>“The tuition given to Brady has given a new interest to him in life, begun to pull him out of himself and started him on the long, hard road to a healthy normal life in society.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Some prisoners complained Brady was getting “special treatment” but authorities ­continued the classes as they had “toned up his general ­personality and assisted the prison staff considerably in ­trying to socialise him”.</p>
      <p>Brady also passed courses in English literature, maths and psychology and was encouraged to pursue a university degree.</p>
      <p>The papers reveal the killer, who ­strangled his victims with string and buried them on Saddleworth Moor, was given lessons in knot-tying while in jail by a young female therapist who became infatuated with him.</p>
      <p>They had to be separated because of fears their bond was becoming ­“unprofessional”.</p>
      <p>Brady lived out the rest of his life behind bars.</p>
