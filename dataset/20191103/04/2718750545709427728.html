      <p><a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/snl-elizabeth-warren-kate-mckinnon-bdsm-sketch-watch.html">Kate McKinnon’s Elizabeth Warren</a> brought her folksy charm to <i>SNL</i>’s cold open on November 2, and gave audience members everywhere the pep talk they needed to finally dump their, uh, toxic insurance plans. New cast member <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/09/snl-cast-bowen-yang-chloe-fineman-shane-gillis.html">Chloe Fineman</a> starred as an inquiring town-hall attendee who asked if she could keep her insurance plan under Warren’s policies. “Let me help you understand,” Warren replied, “Your insurance plan is like a bad boyfriend. Girl, listen to me. He is draining you. You deserve better! Dump his ass!” Considering the real Elizabeth Warren already has a <a href="https://twitter.com/ewarren/status/1130155498936913920">proven track record</a> with helping out women with their love lives, this sketch may not stray too far from the truth.</p>
