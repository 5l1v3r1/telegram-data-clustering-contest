      <p>GUNTUR (Andhra Pradesh): In keeping with its no-needle policy, the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Athletics-Federation-of-India">Athletics Federation of India</a> on Saturday barred two athletes from taking part in the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/National-Junior-Championships">National Junior Championships</a> here for possessing syringes.</p>
      <p>Chandigarh's Parkash Singh and Rajasthan's <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Dhananjay">Dhananjay</a> were found to have syringes and vials in their bags in the Call Room, the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/AFI">AFI</a> said in a release.</p>
      <p>On the first day of the competitions, Haryana's Gurpreet and Himachal Pradesh's Seema clocked personal best times to win the boys under-20 10000m and girls under-20 5000m crowns at the Acharya Nagarjuna University grounds here.</p>
      <p>In the field events, Kerala long jumper Sandra Babu caught the eye with a personal best of 6.16m.</p>
      <p>Delhi's Arvind Sharma, silver medallist last year, won the boys under-16 discus throw with a 50.16m effort.</p>
      <p>AFI also became the first National Sports Federation to issue biometrics card to athletes so that they do not have to undergo long age-verification process at each meet.</p>
      <p>AFI President Adille J Sumariwalla said, “With this competition, AFI has implemented biometric unique identification process that will prove to be a game changer in tackling age fraud and cheating. We want to promote fair play and keep the sport clean.</p>
      <p>"We want to save the genuine athletes who suffer at the hands of age frauds. Same is with doping, we are keeping a close eye during meets and follow no needle policy. Anyone caught with syringes will be suspended with immediate effect.”</p>
