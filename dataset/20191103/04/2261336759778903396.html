      <p>In his move up to 185-pounds, Darren Till just took a split decision over the #4 ranked middleweight Kelvin Gastelum in an underwhelming affair at UFC 244. It wasn’t the fight that everyone was expecting, but it got Till a much needed win and a likely new ranking in a new division. As for Gastelum, well he has now dropped two-straight.</p>

      <p>They tied up right away and worked for position against the fence. Neither man really had the advantage there. Not a lot of time was spent in open space, but when the fight was taking place there it was Till landing the better strikes. It was kind of a pedestrian opening round.</p>
      <p>Kelvin came out aggressive in the second round, but that was quickly extinguished by the footwork of Till. The leg kicks were there for Till. Just after Gastelum landed a slick elbow in the clinch, he accidentally poked Till in the eye. The fight was paused but it quickly resumed. Gastelum cliched up and tried to bring the bout down to the floor, but Till’s takedown defense was there. Gastelum started to land heavy leg kicks deep in the round, but there weren’t many significant head strikes scored by either man.</p>
      <p>Gastelum started attacking the legs of Till to open the final phase. Till used his footwork to stay elusive, and would crack off with straight punches. The crowd started to get restless due to the lack of action. Gastelum pressed forward, but struggled to connect on his longer opposition. He was able to score a takedown within the last minute of the fight, but Till sprung right back to his feet. He blasted another takedown, but again Till was right back up.</p>
