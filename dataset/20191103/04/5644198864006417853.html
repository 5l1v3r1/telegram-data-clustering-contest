      <p>AUSTIN, Texas: Former McLaren and Ferrari engineer Pat Fry will join Renault next year, the Formula One team announced at the U.S. Grand Prix on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The Briton started out with Benetton before joining McLaren in 1993, winning world championships with Mika Hakkinen and Lewis Hamilton, before joining Ferrari as deputy technical director in 2010.</p>

      <p>He returned to Woking as engineering director last September.</p>
      <p>"His arrival is yet another step as we build and improve our team structure," said Renault's executive director Marcin Budkowski, who worked previously with Fry at McLaren.</p>
      <p>"Patâ€™s experience, talent and determination will be additional assets as we continue our progress."</p>
      <p>Renault announced on Friday that Dirk De Beer was returning to the team as head of aerodynamics with a deputy to join next year from another team.</p>
      <p>Renault, with Australian driver Daniel Ricciardo and German Nico Hulkenberg, are fifth in the constructors' championship with three races to go, after finishing fourth last year.</p>
