      <p>A woman's heart stopped beating after a scratch from her Siamese cat became infected.</p>
      <p>Shirley Hair, 65, was left fighting for her life after she contracted a flesh-eating bug when her pet cat, Chan, scratched her hand.</p>
      <p>The wound on her knuckle became inflamed and turned bright red, the <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/">Daily Star</a> reports.</p>
      <p>Other symptoms included feeling dizzy, confusion, having no appetite and aching muscles.</p>
      <p>However, Shirley realised something was seriously wrong when her arm swelled up and the skin turned black.</p>

      <p>She was rushed to hospital and diagnosed with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/lifestyle/health/what-sepsis-signs-symptoms-treatment-7246541">sepsis</a> , septic shock, organ failure, pneumonia and the flesh-eating bug necrotising fasciitis.</p>
      <p>Shirley underwent surgery to remove the infected tissue and was put in an induced coma for five days.</p>
      <p>She spent two months in the ICU and had further surgeries and skin grafts.</p>
      <p>Eventually, she was well enough to return home and decided to give up her £400 pet who she had bought from a breeder when he was 10-weeks old.</p>
      <p>Shirley, who lives with her husband Bob, 69, in Winterbourne, Bristol, said: “That cat had always been spiteful. He was very expensive though.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>“He was never nice to me and would lash out whenever possible.</p>
      <p>“But as Chan got older he got more aggressive, often leaving us with bites and scratches. The day he scratched me I’d been gardening. I tried to pick him up for a cuddle but he wasn’t having it.</p>
      <p>“I felt like I was going to die. I couldn’t believe this could all happen from a simple scratch.’’</p>
      <p>During her extensive treatment, Shirley's health had declined and her family had been told to "expect the worst".</p>
      <p>She even suffered two heart attacks following another operation to remove the infection.</p>
      <p>Shirley said: “After coming out of the coma I was severely paranoid due to the combination of infection and medication.” Her children Zoe, 46, Jessica, 40, James, 38, and Rosie, 34, spent hours by her bedside.</p>

      <p>After spending a month in the ICU, Shirley started to get better and doctors were able to take a skin graft from the top of her leg to cover her arm.</p>
      <p>Shirley said: ‘’I can’t thank my family and the NHS enough for getting me back to almost full health. It’s been quite an ordeal, but they have all supported me 100%. I’m here and that’s all that matters.”</p>
      <p>She added: “After all that happened I decided I really couldn’t face Chan the cat any more so my daughter Zoe volunteered to have him."</p>
