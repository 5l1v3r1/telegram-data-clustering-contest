      <h1>England's World Cup may have ended in disappointment, but it's not been the worst - or best - part of Eddie Jones' coaching reign</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T04:38:21+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 04:38</time> by <a rel="author">By Online Editors</a></address>
      <p>Eddie Jones suffered the agony of World Cup final defeat again as a rampant <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/south-africa">South Africa</a> ran out 32-12 winners in the World Cup final in Yokohama.</p>
      <p>Jones was also on the losing side in the 2003 final when <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/england">England</a> beat Australia.</p>
      <p>He took up his role as England head coach in November 2015 and has enjoyed a colourful time at the helm.</p>
      <p>Jones’ plans for beyond 2019 remain unknown.</p>
      <p>Jones’ home nation, Australia, <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/news/australia-who-have-to-break-bank-for-eddie-jones">are in need of a new coach</a> with Michael Cheika choosing not to seek reappointment after a disappointing 2019 campaign. Perhaps Jones would like another crack at winning the World Cup with Australia?</p>

      <p>Remaining with England is always an option – and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/news/why-would-eddie-jones-return-to-australia-when-he-can-build-a-dynasty-with-england/">Jones could build a dynasty with the young squad he has at his disposal.</a></p>
      <p>Although the World Cup cycle hasn’t ended the way Jones would have liked, he’s still built a strong side out of the ashes of England’s disastrous 2015 campaign.</p>
      <p>What have been the highs and lows of his tenure to date?</p>
      <h3>HIGHS</h3>
      <p>March 2016: Jones enjoyed the perfect start to his reign by presiding over England’s first Grand Slam since 2003.</p>
      <p>June 2016: The Midas touch was carried into the summer tour to <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/australia">Australia</a> where the Wallabies were swept aside 3-0 in a thrilling Test series.</p>

      <p>March 2017: Scotland were routed 61-21 to see England equal New Zealand’s record of 18 successive Test wins. Defeat by <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/ireland">Ireland</a> in the next match ended the run.</p>
      <p>January 2018: Having overseen a remarkable streak of 23 wins from 24 Tests, Jones is awarded a two-year contract extension.</p>
      <p>October 2019: England claim an impressive 40-16 win over Australia in the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/rugby-world-cup">Rugby World Cup</a> quarter-final in Oita, and follow that up with a 19-7 semi-final victory over New Zealand.</p>
      <h3>LOWS</h3>
      <p>January 2017: Attends the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations">Six Nations</a> launch in London with heavy bruising and wounding around his left eye after slipping in the shower earlier that morning.</p>
      <p>February 2018: Abused by <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/scotland">Scotland</a> fans and then football supporters while using public transport to travel from <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/edinburgh">Edinburgh</a> to London via Manchester.</p>

      <p>March 2018: England left one defeat away from enduring their worst <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations">Six Nations</a> performance since 2006 following dismal losses to Scotland and France.</p>
      <p>March 2018: Footage from a business talk in 2017 shows Jones refer to Ireland as the “scummy Irish” and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/wales">Wales</a> as a “little s*** country”.</p>
      <p>November 2019: England swept into the final by beating holders <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/new-zealand">New Zealand</a> but they could not deliver again in the final as South Africa dominated throughout to run out comfortable 32-12 winners.</p>
