      <h1>Barra distillery's customers left in lurch as limited edition gin fails to arrive</h1>
      <h2>Even a local bobby couldn’t get hold of the £37 bottle of Barra Atlantic Gin she ordered despite paying up front.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T04:30:00+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">Jane Barrie, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/jane-barrie/</a></address>
      <p>Customers of an island distillery threatened to call in police after orders for limited edition gin failed to arrive.</p>
      <p>But even a local bobby couldn’t get hold of the £37 bottle of Barra Atlantic Gin she ordered despite paying up front.</p>
      <p>Sandra Grant, a <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/police">police constable</a> on nearby Benbecula, said: “I’m fed up chasing Isle of Barra Distillers and the humour is not lost on me.</p>
      <p>“It’s ironic that even I can’t get my delivery given what I do for a living.</p>
      <p>“But it seems I’m not alone. There are other people complaining online.</p>
      <p>“They all appear, like me, to have placed orders and had trouble receiving them.”</p>

      <p>The firm, based in Castlebay, on the island’s south coast, advertised pre-sale bottles of the spirit made with 17 botanicals, including local carrageen seaweed, for £37 plus £4 postage in May.</p>
      <p>It had just been granted official approval, making it the first fully licensed gin distiller on Barra.</p>
      <p>Sandra, 46, added: “This was the first time the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/alcohol">gin</a> was to be distilled, bottled and labelled on the island.</p>
      <p>“I thought it would make a nice gift for someone while supporting a local business at the same time.” Sandra, of Balivanich, Benbecula, received confirmation of her order after she placed it on July 11.</p>
      <p>But it failed to arrive and she spent weeks phoning and emailing.</p>
      <p>She said: “My mum ordered too and hers turned up, so I thought it was a glitch at first.</p>
      <p>“But I only ever received one response – an email on September 26. The firm apologised, said it was busy and short-staffed but would get the order to me within a few days.</p>
      <p>“The phone rings out, they don’t respond to emails and it’s a four-hour round trip to get there. I’d have to spend 40 minutes on the ferry each way. I just want what I ordered or my money back.”</p>
      <p>Other customers on consumer website Trust Pilot branded the firm’s customer service “terrible” and rated it with zero stars, although some are now reporting deliveries have arrived after waiting months.</p>
      <p>One female customer said: “If I could give no stars, I would and I’m seriously thinking of involving Highlands and Islands police.</p>
      <p>“Now a bit of honesty from the company would be nice.”</p>
      <p>She later notes that her gin turned up: “A bottle has arrived so maybe now two stars, which hopefully will get up to a four or five-star review in the future as the gin is very good.”</p>

      <p>The company, run by islander Michael Morrison, was a finalist in the Scottish Gin Awards 2019, shortlisted in the best London dry gin of the year category.</p>
      <p>After being contacted by the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/sunday-mail">Sunday Mail</a>, the distillery offered Sandra a full refund.</p>
      <p>In an email to her, Morrison said: “I’m sorry for the late reply.</p>
      <p>"We would like to discuss what we are willing to do to make up for the poor service.”</p>
      <p>He told us there was a “slight issue” with Sandra’s order and said, with regard to other complaints: “There were issues but we have gone a long way to putting things right.”</p>
