      <h1>Rugby World Cup Final: Eddie Jones lost for answers after England are blown away</h1>
      <h2>“I don't know why we didn't play well. We are going to be kicking stones for four years. We are massively disappointed”</h2>

      <p>Eddie Jones was driven to drink after his England side were left battered and bloodied by a World Cup final hammering.</p>
      <p>Jones, the coach with an answer for everything, had no explanation for the way his side were mauled by underdogs South Africa.</p>
      <p>“I don't know why we didn't play well,” said the Australian, who admitted they would feel the pain for the next four years. “The only thing I am worried about now is having a few beers, and that's the only thing we will worry about.</p>
      <p>"And then after we have a few beers today, we will probably have a few more beers tomorrow and maybe Monday, and then maybe we will have to pull up stumps.”</p>

      <p>In a brutal contest Kyle Sinckler was knocked out in the third minute and Billy Vunipola left blood splattered by a nasty head wound.</p>
      <p>But the real wounds were to English morale after Jones endured the heaviest defeat of his 50-Test England career in the biggest game.</p>
      <p>“It's not a good day for it to happen,” he admitted, as Siya Kolisi was congratulated by <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/prince-harry">Prince Harry</a> on becoming the first black World Cup-winning captain.</p>

      <p>“We couldn’t get on the front foot, we were dominated in the scrum, they were too good for us at the breakdown.</p>
      <p>"You can have the most investigative debrief of your game and you still don't know what was wrong,</p>
      <p>“We are going to be kicking stones for four years, and it is hard to kick stones for four years, so we are massively disappointed.”</p>

      <p>A week after taking the All Blacks to the cleaners England were blown away by the ferocity of the Springboks.</p>
      <p>They never recovered from the loss of Sinckler, conceding six scrum penalties in a contest which they never led.</p>
      <p>“Words can’t do justice to how I’m feeling,” the prop later admitted on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> . “Biggest moment in my life and not even being able to get a chance to shoot my shot.</p>
      <p>“Sport is cruel but we can never let adversity get the better of us. We as a team will come back stronger.”</p>
