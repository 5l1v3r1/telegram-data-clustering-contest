      <p>LOS ANGELES, Nov 3 —  Olivia Newton-John’s tight black pants and leather jacket from the movie <i>Grease </i>sold for USD405,700  (RM1.7 million) at a Beverly Hills auction today, more than double the expected price, Julien’s Auctions said.</p>
      <p>The outfit that marked the transition of Newton-John’s character in the 1978 musical from demure high schooler to sexy Sandy was among 500 items for sale to help raise money for the performer’s cancer treatment centre in Australia.</p>
      <p>The infamous pants worn by Newton-John for the <i>You’re the One That I Want </i>duet with John Travolta were so tight that she had to be sewn into them to film the scene, and were sold with a broken zipper. The buyers for the pants and jacket were not revealed.</p>
      <p>The auction raised USD64,000, compared to an estimate of USD1,000. The pink lace gown the actress wore to the movie premiere in Los Angeles went for USD18,750. A custom Pink Ladies jacket given to the actress by the cast and crew fetched USD50,000, 25 times its original estimate.</p>
      <p>The British-born, Australian-raised 71-year-old singer and actress said earlier this year that she was battling breast cancer for a third time since first being diagnosed in 1992.</p>
      <p>After her first bout with cancer, she helped set up the Olivia Newton-John Cancer and Wellness Centre in Melbourne, which aims to support the mind as well as the body.</p>
      <p>All of the proceeds from the <i>Grease</i> jacket and pants will benefit the centre, as well as a portion of all the other items sold today. — Reuters</p>
