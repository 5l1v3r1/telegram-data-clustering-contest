      <p>On the same day the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/mlb/washington-nationals">Washington Nationals</a> celebrated their World Series triumph with a victory parade <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/travel/vacation-destinations/washington-dc">in D.C.</a>, their fans learned that Series MVP pitcher Stephen Strasburg may be heading out of town.</p>
      <p>According to reports, Strasburg – who went 5-0 in the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/mlb-postseason">MLB Postseason</a> as the Nationals won the first world championship in franchise history – has opted out of the final four years of his contract, making him a free agent.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The decision means 31-year-old Strasburg leaves $100 million on the table – with the prospect of earning more, either from the Nationals or another team.</p>
      <p>Strasburg becomes the second member of the world champs to seek free agency: On Thursday, third baseman Anthony Rendon became a free agent, according to the Associated Press.</p>
