      <p>Last year, <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/stalley/profile">Stalley</a> brought his <i>Tell The Truth: Shame The Devil</i> EP series to completion and now the Ohio-bred emcee has returned to follow up with his latest full-length output, sharing <i>Reflection Of Self: Head Trip</i>. This time around he delivers on nine total tracks, all produced by Jansport J.</p>
      <p>“I’ve been getting closer to my fans lately,” Stalley says in a press release. “So, I really wanted to let them in and have them be a part of my growth and transition into independence. By being independent and having total control of my career, I now have the freedom to create freely and bare my whole self to my true supporters.”</p>
