      <p>Eight new species of mussels are spotted in the rivers of Myanmar, according to Fauna &amp; Flora International(FFI) Myanmar Programme.</p>
      <p>Zaw Lun, Manager of Fresh Water and Salt Water Conservation Program said, “Eight new species of mussels are undocumented ones in the globe. Under the permission of Myanmar Fishery Department, a research was conducted in the rivers in cooperation with scientists from other countries. These new species were found in four major rivers—Ayeyawady, Sittoung, Houngthayaw and Dawei Rivers.”</p>
      <p>They are new species for the Science. We conducted the research on the DNA. Four major species and four subspecies are spotted. Since 2013, our FFI has conducted researches in the rivers in cooperation with Russian, American, Portuguese and Thai scientists and staff from the Fishery Department, he added.</p>
      <p>Mussels are said to be water indicator. They don’t move from one place to another. It is generally said that the water quality is not good if mussels are not present there any longer. The presence of mussels can purify water. Water quality and health is said to be good if mussels are abundant.</p>
      <p>Plan is under way to conduct a research on mussels and other aquatic animals.</p>
