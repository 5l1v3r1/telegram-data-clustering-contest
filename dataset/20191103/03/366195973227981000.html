      <p>Before <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/LupeFiasco/profile">Lupe Fiasco</a> ever delivered on his quintessential <i>Food &amp; Liquor</i> album in 2006, he recorded "Hey Lupe." The track remained in whatever crevice he could find until it quietly resurfaced on the 2010 <i>Vintage Fiasco</i> tape. Still, there was no sign of life from "Hey Lupe" until this week when Charles "Chill" Patton, co-founder of Lupe's 1st &amp; 15th label decided to package together a three-track playlist. On it, you'll find the previously-released "Gametime" and "Run Game" singles with the official "Hey Lupe" recording leading the pack.</p>
      <p>"I vividly remember the day Lupe recorded this song," Chill tells <i>The FADER</i>. "I got the beat from the producer and played it twice for Lu while we were riding in a white Suburban, 20 minutes later we made it to the studio and he immediately went in and knocked out the whole song — verses, hook, adlibs, etc. It was natural for him, but not so natural for me to see this, and I had been around some of the greats. This is when I knew he was a Monster!! It’s been in the vaults for many years, and now we are excited to share it with his fans."</p>

        </u>
      </p>
      <p>They should break in the company and take him in custody<br/>For takin sumthin so basic and makin it uppity<br/>So publicly so what if he hold something so stubbornly<br/>So grudgingly up in here for something that he does so lovingly</p>
