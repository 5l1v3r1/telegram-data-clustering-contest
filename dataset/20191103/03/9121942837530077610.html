      <p>TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — Iran’s supreme leader says his country has outmaneuvered the United States in the four decades since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.</p>
      <p>Ayatollah Ali Khamenei says Iran has “trapped the other party in the corner of the ring in many cases.”</p>
      <p>He says U.S. aggression toward Iran has only grown “wilder and more flagrant” over the years.</p>
      <p>Khamenei’s official website published his remarks to thousands of students Sunday, a day before the 40th anniversary of the U.S. Embassy takeover in Tehran.</p>
      <p>Tensions have been high between Washington and Tehran after President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew the U.S. from Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal.</p>
      <p>The U.S. has sought to roll back Iran’s influence across the region by imposing sanctions and providing military and other aid to its adversaries.</p>
