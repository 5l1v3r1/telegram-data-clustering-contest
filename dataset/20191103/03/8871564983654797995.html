      <p>The UN chief on Saturday warned Asia to quit its “addiction” to coal, as climate change threatens hundreds of millions of people vulnerable to rising sea levels across the region.</p>
      <p>The warning follows fresh research this week predicting that several Asian megacities, including <a href="https://coconuts.co/bangkok/">Bangkok</a>, Ho Chi Minh City and Mumbai, are at risk of extreme flooding linked to global warming.</p>
      <p>Antonio Guterres said Asian countries need to cut reliance on coal to tackle the climate crisis, which he called the “defining issue of our time”.</p>
      <p>“There is an addiction to coal that we need to overcome because it remains a major threat in relation to climate change,” he told reporters ahead of a meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in Bangkok on Saturday.</p>
      <p>He said countries in the region need to be on “the front line” of the fight by introducing carbon pricing and reforming energy policies.</p>
      <p>“We are lagging behind,” he said, adding that the rollback of coal could help curb rising global temperatures.</p>
      <p>Coal remains a major source of power across Southeast Asia, where breakneck economic development has spurred soaring energy demands — but at a cost to the environment.</p>
      <p>About one-third of Vietnam’s energy comes from coal power with a slew of new plants set to come online by 2050, while Thailand is investing in fossil fuels.</p>
      <p>Coastal areas across Southeast Asia have already seen major floods and seawater incursion linked to climate change.</p>
      <p>New research this week showed that at least 300 million people worldwide are living in places at risk of inundation by 2050, a much bleaker picture than previous data predicted.</p>
      <p>Destructive storm surges fuelled by increasingly powerful cyclones and rising seas will hit Asia hardest, according to the study in the journal Nature Communications.</p>
      <p>The UN chief also spoke on Myanmar’s persecuted Rohingya Muslims, nearly three-quarters of a million of whom were driven into Bangladesh in 2017.</p>
      <p>He urged Myanmar’s government to “address the root causes of displacement and allowing of the return, voluntary and in safety and dignity” to Myanmar.</p>
      <p>“Some steps have been done but they are too small. We need to do much more,” he said.</p>
      <p>Myanmar’s de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi is also in Bangkok for the summit and is likely to face pressure over her country’s treatment of the Rohingya, particularly from Muslim-majority Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>
      <p>Myanmar has rebuffed all international pressure so far while only hundreds of Rohingya have returned to Myanmar, due to fear of further repression.</p>
