      <h1>Frankfurt demolish 10-man Bayern Munich 5-1 in Bundesliga</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T03:58:12+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 03:58</time> by <a rel="author">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>BERLIN: <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Eintracht-Frankfurt">Eintracht Frankfurt</a> crushed 10-man <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Bayern-Munich">Bayern Munich</a> 5-1 on Saturday to send them tumbling to fourth in the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a>, four points behind leaders Borussia Moenchengladbach who won 2-1 at Bayer Leverkusen.</p>
      <p>The Bavarians, who have clinched the last seven league titles, have now won just one of their last four Bundesliga matches.</p>
      <p>Saturday's heavy defeat on Thomas Mueller's 500th game in all competitions for Bayern leaves the future of embattled coach Niko Kovac in doubt.</p>
      <p>"I cannot say. You have to ask other people," Kovac said when asked whether he still enjoyed the backing of the Bayern bosses.</p>
      <p>"I cannot blame the team. With the red card all our plans went out the window. We were then 2-0 behind and had phases where we dominated possession. But after we went down 3-1, we deserved to lose."</p>
      <p>"You could see again today that we make simple mistakes that are instantly punished," said Kovac, a former Frankfurt coach, who had infuriated Bayern fans this week by praising his former club's fans as the best in the league.</p>
      <p>First-half goals from Filip Kostic and Djibril Sow put the hosts in the driving seat with Bayern down to 10 after the ninth minute dismissal of Jerome Boateng with a red card for a foul.</p>
      <p>The Bavarians briefly cut the deficit in the 37th minute through Bundesliga top scorer Robert Lewandowski, who has now netted at least once in each of their 10 league games.</p>
      <p>The Poland striker took his league tally to 14 goals but David Abraham restored Frankfurt's two-goal cushion in the 49th.</p>
      <p>Martin Hinteregger's header on the hour made sure of the three points and Goncalo Paciencia completed a horrible afternoon for Bayern, piling more pressure on the champions ahead of next week's big clash with Borussia Dortmund.</p>
      <p>Gladbach, on 22 points, increased their lead at the top to three over Dortmund, who beat Vfl Wolfsburg 3-0 to snap their unbeaten run in the league and move into second place.</p>
      <p>Marcus Thuram got the winner for clinical Gladbach after Kevin Volland cancelled out Oscar Wendt's lead for the Foals with all the goals coming in the first half.</p>
      <p>RB Leipzig demolished Mainz 05 8-0 to go third on 18, ahead of Bayern on goal difference.</p>
      <p>The first ever Bundesliga derby between promoted Union and Hertha Berlin never lived up to the hype but offered a dramatic finale with the Bundesliga newcomers snatching victory and bragging rights in the capital with a 90th minute Sebastian Polter penalty.</p>
      <p>The game was interrupted for several minutes in the second half after flares were thrown onto the pitch of Union's Alte Foersterei Stadium.</p>
      <p>The last time two Berlin clubs met in the Bundesliga was back in the 1976/77 season when Hertha played Tennis Borussia Berlin.</p>
