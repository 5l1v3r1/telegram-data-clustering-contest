      <p>Martin Bashir has survived the axe from X Factor: Celebrity, despite forgetting the words to his song.</p>
      <p>Instead soap stars Victoria Ekanoye and Jonny Labey got the boot after losing out in the public vote.</p>
      <p>Bashir stumbled while performing the Commodores song Easy during the live show and said: "I've forgotten my words, I do apologise."</p>
      <p>Afterwards, he said: "I'm not trying to make excuses but my song had to be changed very late so I learned this song this morning.</p>
      <p>"I had been working on something else and rights issues meant we couldn't do that."</p>

      <p>Simon Cowell told him: "I knew the story so I knew things were likely to go wrong.</p>
      <p>"I hope the audience gives you a second chance."</p>
      <p>After learning he had survived to sing another week, Bashir said: "There is some kind of psychotic breakdown happening in this country."</p>

      <p>While Ekanoye said she expected to be given the chop, Labey said he felt he had much more to give as he was dumped from the show.</p>
      <p>Earlier in the episode, Try Star paid tribute to the England rugby team after their defeat in the World Cup final at the hands of South Africa, with a performance of Swing Low, Sweet Chariot.</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>The performance prompted Nicole Scherzinger to give the group, mentored by Cowell, her safe seat.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile Cowell gave his safe seat to Love Island group No Love Lost.</p>
      <p>The X Factor: Celebrity continues next Saturday on ITV at 8.10pm.</p>
