      <p>Trinity College Dublin is the top college in the country.</p>
      <p>The Sunday Times Good University Guide 2020 released today shows that Trinity has come ahead of University College Dublin and University College Cork, who are in joint second place.</p>
      <p>Athlone Institute of Technology is up two places to seventh and is the highest ranked institute of technology.</p>
      <p>The Sunday Times Good University Guide's Dr Colm Murphy said that Trinity leads the field for the 18th successive year - but that other contenders are closing in.</p>
      <p>He said: "Trinity's gap on the other colleges is closing - both University College Cork and University College Dublin are within a whisker now of Trinity College.</p>
      <p>"That's because both those other universities score better for student satisfaction than Trinity."</p>
      <p>Student satisfaction was introduced into the rankings last year as one of eight key performance measures, and given the heaviest weighting.</p>
      <p>Other categories include effective teaching practices, higher order learning, reflective and integrative learning, learning strategies, student-faculty interaction, overall quality of interactions, a supportive academic environment, collaborative learning and quantitative reasoning.</p>
      <p>The 16-page Sunday Times Good University Guide 2020 is given free with today's issue.</p>
