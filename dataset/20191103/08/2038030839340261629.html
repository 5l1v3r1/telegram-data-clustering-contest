      <p>Cape Town - We all have our favourite pop stars from the 2000s. Whether it was Vanessa Carlton who famously sang, <i>A Thousand Miles</i> or the poptastic tunes of Jesse McCartney, it was easy to become a little bit obsessed with several faces from the decade. But now that times have moved on, where are they now? </p>
      <p>That's why the folks over at Ms Mojo put together this list of pop stars with a little more information about where they are now! For this list, they caught up with the big musical celebrities from the aughts that we no longer see much of. They based their choices on a mix of career changes, surprising life developments and unique stories in the years since the singers in question drifted from the spotlight. </p>
