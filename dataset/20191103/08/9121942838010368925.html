      <p>CHICAGO (AP) — A teenage boy charged in the shooting of two people on Halloween, including a 7-year-old girl who was out trick-or-treating, is expected to remain in custody at least until Monday.</p>
      <p>The Chicago Sun-Times reports that the boy appeared in Cook County juvenile court Saturday. The judge ordered the boy held in custody at least through the weekend. A Monday hearing is scheduled.</p>
      <p>The teen is charged with attempted first-degree murder and aggravated battery with a firearm in the attack Thursday evening. He isn’t being named because he’s a juvenile.</p>
      <p>Police say they believe it was a gang-related shooting and that a 30-year-old man was the target.</p>
      <p>The girl in a bumblebee costume was hospitalized in critical but stable condition.</p>
      <p>The shooting occurred in Chicago’s Little Village neighborhood.</p>
