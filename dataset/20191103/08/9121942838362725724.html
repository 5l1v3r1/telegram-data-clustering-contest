      <p>LONDON (AP) — Jamie Vardy scored late to take Leicester third in the Premier League by sealing a 2-0 win at Crystal Palace on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Turkish defender Caglar Söyüncü opened the scoring with his first goal in the league in the 57th minute, when he was left free to head in after a deflected corner.</p>
      <p>Vardy sealed the result in the 88th after a fine combination with Demarai Gray.</p>
      <p>Palace failed to register an effort on target in the first half, and only marginaly improved in the second.</p>
      <p>Leicester moved ahead of Chelsea on goal difference, two points behind Manchester City and eight behind league leader Liverpool after 11 games.</p>
      <p>Palace dropped to ninth.</p>
      <p>Everton was hosting Tottenham in the late game.</p>
