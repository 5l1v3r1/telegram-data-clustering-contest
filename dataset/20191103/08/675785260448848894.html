      <h1>Top 10 one-club scorers in Premier League history as Thierry Henry heads list</h1>
      <h2>The Premier League has had some legendary strikers down the years but some of them have only scored for one club</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T08:30:00+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 08:30</time> by <a rel="author">Liam Prenderville, http://www.facebook.com/mirrorfootball</a></address>
      <p>The race for the 2019/20 Premier League Golden Boot looks set to be another special one with plenty of names in the mix.</p>
      <p>Among them are goalscoring machines Sergio Aguero and Harry Kane, who continue to find the net for Manchester City and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> respectively.</p>
      <p>Unlike Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mane and Raheem Sterling, the strikers have only found the net for their current clubs.</p>
      <p>With that in mind, Mirror Football has trawled through the Premier League archives and taken a look at the top 10 players whose goals have all come for one team.</p>
      <p>So, that means there is no place for the top four scorers in Premier League history - including all-time leader Alan Shearer and second-placed Wayne Rooney.</p>

      <h3>10 - Ole Gunnar Solskjaer (Manchester United) - 91</h3>
      <p>The now Manchester United boss delivered a fine total during his playing days at Old Trafford.</p>
      <p>Solskjaer joined United in 1996 and spent over a decade with the Red Devils.</p>
      <p>The Norwegian's best tally came in his debut campaign, with 17.</p>
      <p>His seven goals in his final season see him edge out prolific <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> marskman Jamie Vardy to make the cut.</p>

      <h3>9 - Ruud van Nistelrooy (Manchester United) - 95</h3>
      <p>Van Nistelrooy remains one of the greatest finishers the Premier League has seen.</p>
      <p>The Dutchman managed to score all 95 of his Premier League goals in just five seasons at Old Trafford.</p>
      <p>He scored 25 in the 2002/03 season, which saw him claim the Golden Boot.</p>

      <h3>8 - Matt Le Tissier (Southampton) - 100</h3>
      <p>A true one-club man, Le Tissier played his entire professional career on the south coast.</p>
      <p>He did manage 161 league goals for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/southampton-fc">Southampton</a> , but a chunk of those came in the First Division.</p>
      <p>Le Tissier scored a stunning 25 times in the 1993/94 season and famously bagged the last goal at The Dell in 2001.</p>

      <h3>7 - Didier Drogba (Chelsea) - 104</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> legend Drogba enjoyed two spells at Stamford Bridge.</p>
      <p>He initially moved to London from Marseille for Â£24m in 2004 and the goals followed.</p>
      <p>Drogba scored 29 times as Chelsea won the title in 2010, securing his ton in his first spell.</p>
      <p>The Ivorian would return under Jose Mourinho in 2014, managing another four goals.</p>

      <h3>6 - Paul Scholes (Manchester United) - 107</h3>
      <p>Scholes played out his entire career at Old Trafford and makes the list from midfield.</p>
      <p>The United legend scored in every season he played in the Premier League - 19 in total.</p>
      <p>He was lured out of retirement by Sir Alex Ferguson in 2012 and still had time to add another few foals to his excellent tally.</p>

      <h3>5 - Ryan Giggs (Manchester United) - 109</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> legend Giggs scored in 21 consecutive Premier League seasons for the club.</p>
      <p>His best tally came in the 1993/94 season as the winger bagged 13 times.</p>
      <p>Giggs didn't find the net in his final season for the club under David Moyes before finally calling it a day.</p>

      <h3>4 - Steven Gerrard (Liverpool) - 120</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> legend Gerrard enjoyed an incredible career at Anfield and delivered a fantastic goal record in the process.</p>
      <p>All of his Premier League goals came in the red of his boyhood club, his first coming against Sheffield Wednesday in 1999.</p>
      <p>Gerrard's final goal for Liverpool came in his last appearance, a 6-1 drubbing at Stoke at the end of the 2014/15 campaign.</p>

      <h3>3 - Harry Kane (Tottenham) - 131</h3>
      <p>England skipper Kane is over half way to Alan Shearer's overall record, and is only 26.</p>
      <p>The striker didn't make his league debut until 2012, meaning he has racked up a stunning total in just over seven years.</p>
      <p>Kane's best tally came in 2018 when he scored 30 times, but he has scored more than 20 in three other seasons.</p>
      <p>He did of course have a brief spell on loan with Norwich, but didn't find the net.</p>

      <h3>2 - Sergio Aguero (Man City) - 172</h3>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> striker will hope to top the 200 goal mark before his time at the Etihad is over.</p>
      <p>Aguero, 31, joined City in 2011 and scored one of the most famous Premier League goals ever on the final day of that season.</p>
      <p>He managed 23 in his maiden campaign but has since beat that twice for City.</p>

      <h3>1 - Thierry Henry (Arsenal) - 175</h3>
      <p>The Frenchman remains arguably the best ever foreign player to grace the Premier League.</p>
      <p>Henry had a slow start to life in north London but scored 17 or more in all but one of his eight seasons at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> .</p>
      <p>He racked up 30 in the Invincibles' campaign, taking his total to 174 before leaving for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fc-barcelona">Barcelona</a> .</p>
      <p>Henry returned in January 2012, scoring once in the Premier League in a win at Sunderland.</p>
