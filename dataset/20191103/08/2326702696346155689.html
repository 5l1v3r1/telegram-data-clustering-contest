      <p>With <a href="https://www.eteknix.com/category/linux">Linux</a> releasing its latest <a href="https://www.eteknix.com/category/operating-system">operating system</a> drivers, some users can’t help but delve into them to see if there’s anything interesting lurking within. It might sound a bit weird, but these <a href="https://www.eteknix.com/category/driver">driver</a> updates have proven (very consistently) to be solid indicators of upcoming tech releases.</p>
      <p>So, with the latest version out, what has been discovered this time? Well, in a report <a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/82601-linux-drivers-confirm-high-end-radeon-navi-gpus.html">via TechSpot</a>, the new Linux drivers confirm at least 4 new upcoming <a href="https://www.eteknix.com/category/amd">AMD</a> graphics cards as well as hints towards their reported high-end release/s.</p>

      <h3>AMD Graphics Card Releases</h3>
      <p>In the list, at least 4 upcoming <a href="https://www.eteknix.com/category/graphics-card">graphics cards</a> have been confirmed from the entry to lower-mid Radeon 5XXX range. Namely, the 5300, 5500 and what will presumably be their laptop counterparts. That is, at least, what an ‘M’ usually denotes in the GPU world.</p>
      <p>Admittedly, with this information essentially being ‘extracted’ from the code, some of it is open to interpretation. Particularly the clock speeds as numbers could refer to anything.</p>
      <p>What doesn’t help either is that in terms of ‘model names’ and the Navi platform as a whole, AMD doesn’t have a particularly consistent naming scheme. Based on all the information we have seen to date, however, a 5300 and 5500 release seems all but confirmed. We’ll admit though, a mobile version of both is a little (albeit pleasantly) surprising.</p>

      <h3>What about their High-End Releases?</h3>
      <p>AMD has been hinting since August that a ‘high-end’ model forming the top-tier of the 5XXX range was on the way. While there is some reference to a Navi 22 and 23 within the code (which people are speculating may refer to the RDNA 2.0 being reported used in them), there isn’t much else to go on here.</p>
      <p>AMD will, undoubtedly, release a top of the line model for the 5XXX series. For the moment, however, it seems that the lower-tier designs are likely to hit the market first.</p>
      <p>What do you think? How well do you think this Radeon 5300/5500 will perform? – Let us know in the comments!</p>
