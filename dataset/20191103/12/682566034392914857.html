      <p>Shanghai - World number two <b>Rory McIlroy </b>said his recent return to top form was motivated by the realisation that at 30 he faces a ticking career clock, after he won his fourth event of the year at the <b>WGC-HSBC Champions </b>on Sunday.</p>
      <p>McIlroy was the class of the field throughout the tournament in Shanghai, which ended when he defeated defending champion Xander Schauffele in a sudden-death play-off.</p>
      <p>It was the Northern Irishman's first win in east Asia's premier event and keeps him on course in a personal quest to retake the world's top golf ranking that he last held in 2015.</p>
      <p>McIlroy went a rock-solid 67-67-67-68 for the tournament and said his resurgence was fuelled by the fact that "I don't have as much time left as I used to when I was 20."</p>
      <p>"Even if I'm having a bad day, I'm trying over every single shot. My concentration is better and my mental capacity on the golf course is much better than it ever has been," he said.</p>
      <p>"I think that's a big key to why I'm able to play consistently week-in, week-out."</p>
      <p>He had a one-stroke lead stepping to the 18th tee of regulation play but nearly put his drive into the imposing lake that hugs the long par-5 hole at Sheshan International Golf Club.</p>
      <p>He could only salvage a par, leaving him tied with Schauffele after the American carded a birdie.</p>
      <p>But the Northern Irishman shrugged off the mistake to split the fairway in the play-off replay on 18 as Schauffele's tee shot missed left.</p>
      <p>McIlroy went on to win the hole and the $1.745 million winner's purse.</p>
      <p>He is coming off a strong 2019 that saw him secure the FedEx Cup, win PGA Tour Player of the Year honours, and climb the world golf rankings.</p>
      <p>McIlroy burst onto the stage a decade ago as a shaggy-haired youngster widely predicted to dominate golf for years but was overtaken by a succession of other young stars.</p>
      <p>He said this week that next on his list was recapturing the world's top rank, currently held by American golfer Brooks Koepka.</p>
      <p>As the sport buzzes with the return of Tiger Woods -- who achieved a record-tying 82nd PGA Tour win this past week in Japan -- McIlroy showed that he also remains a potent force.</p>
      <p>He did not drop a shot over his final 38 regulation holes and finished at 19 under par.</p>
      <p>"I'm excited for the future. I feel like this year compares to 2014, 2015, but I don't see any reason why I can't go ahead and have an even better year next year," he said.</p>
      <p>The gutsiest performance of the week was put in by world number nine Schauffele.</p>
      <p>The American won in a similar 18th-hole playoff last year against Tony Finau and was gunning to become the first back-to-back victor.</p>
      <p>But he arrived in Shanghai battling a bad case of flu that had him nipping on a nasal inhaler on the course, and occasionally backing off shots to let out a hoarse cough.</p>
      <p>Schauffele stayed on McIlroy's heels, however, and pounced on the Northern Irishman's bad final drive in regulation to catch him, posting a six-under-par 66 for the round.</p>
      <p>But with McIlroy playing the way he is, Schauffele didn't like his chances in the playoff on the long par-5.</p>
      <p>"He's (McIlroy) the best driver in our game. So if I was a betting man, I probably would have bet on him if we had to play the hole over and over again."</p>
      <p>"When he's on, I'd say he's arguably the best player in the world."</p>
