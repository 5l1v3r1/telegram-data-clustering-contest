      <p>Horrific details have emerged about how a Clanwilliam teacher in the Western Cape was allegedly murdered by her boyfriend, who has reportedly confessed to the crime.</p>
      <p>Allison Plaatjies, 26, was found on the floor in her apartment in Katjiepiering Street last Sunday night.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.netwerk24.com/Nuus/Misdaad/onnie-het-tot-einde-baklei-20191102#loggedin">Rapport</a>, she had allegedly been strangled by her boyfriend, 24-year-old education student Phillip April, before he tried to behead her using three different knives. One of the knives apparently broke in her neck, the newspaper reported.</p>
      <p>According to the publication, the accused is said to have made a confession to police.</p>
      <p>Plaatjies reportedly ended her relationship earlier in October and on the day of her disappearance, she was going to a party.</p>
      <p>Plaatjies' aunt Lizel had to identify her niece's body and detailed the wounds that she suffered, which included bite marks to her face and a cut on her chin.</p>
      <p>She said she believed Plaatjies had fought to the end, despite being small in stature.</p>
      <p>April has been charged with murder, car theft and defeating the ends of justice. He is expected to apply for bail in the local magistrate's court on November 13.</p>
