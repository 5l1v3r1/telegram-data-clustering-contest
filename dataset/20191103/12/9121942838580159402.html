      <p>GLENDORA, Miss. (AP) — Men carrying a white nationalist flag were caught on security cameras trying to film in front of a new memorial to lynching victim Emmett Till in Mississippi.</p>
      <p>Patrick Weems, executive director of the Emmett Till Memorial Commission, says cameras captured the incident Saturday.</p>
      <p>Security footage from the commission shows the men, one carrying a neo-Confederate group flag, filming at the site. They are seeing running away when a security alarm sounds.</p>
      <p>Weems says he believes they were filming a propaganda video.</p>
      <p>Till was 14 when he was beaten and killed in 1955 after he whistled at a white woman. The memorial is at the site where Till’s body was pulled from a river.</p>
      <p>A new bullet-proof memorial to Till was dedicated Oct. 19 after the first three markers were vandalized.</p>
