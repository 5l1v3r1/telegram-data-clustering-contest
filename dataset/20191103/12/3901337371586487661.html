      <p>With Suarez turning 33 next year, the club have reportedly begun planning for life after the Uruguayan who has been key to the club's success in recent years.</p>
      <p>Spanish publication Mundo Deportivo claim that the Catalan giants have identified Inter Milan striker Lautaro Martinez as Suarez's long-term replacement.</p>
      <p>The publication claims Martinez fits the ball for the Catalan giants, while he has no problem linking up with Lionel Messi which has been evident in the Argentine national side.</p>
      <p>Inter manager Antonio Conte feels the 22-year-old still needs to work hard, despite the reported interest from the Spanish giants.</p>
      <p>"He has to continue to work hard. Much of the transfer talk comes from that and it cannot be seen as a problem at this moment - there are bigger concerns," Conte was quoted as saying by Express.</p>
      <p>"He must try to be more selfish when he has a chance to score. It's all part of his growth process. I want to improve all of my players."</p>
