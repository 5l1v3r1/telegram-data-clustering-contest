      <p>BORDEAUX, Nov 3 — Storm winds blasted southwest France today, whipping up giant ocean waves, uprooting trees and leaving some 140,000 people without electricity, authorities said.</p>
      <p>Fourteen of the country’s 100-odd departments were placed on high alert as storm Amelie brought heavy rains to the Atlantic coast, with winds exceeding 160 kilometres per hour in places.</p>
      <p>Emergency services attended to hundreds of callouts as gusts dropped trees on roads and railway tracks and tore loose live electrical cables.</p>
      <p>No deaths or injuries have been reported.</p>
      <p>Weather service Meteo France said winds as strong as 163 km/h were recorded in the coastal departments of Gironde and Landes, and 121 km/h in Bordeaux.</p>
      <p>Electricity supplier Enedis said it was working round the clock to restore electricity to some 140,000 customers left without power by the storm.</p>
      <p>In the Landes department, 47 people had to be evacuated from a camp site, and a casino roof collapsed.</p>
      <p>Several trains in the area were cancelled or delayed, according to the SNCF railway operator.</p>
      <p>The southeast of France was not spared, with heavy rainfall forcing the evacuation of a gypsy camp. More than two dozen motorists had to be rescued as their cars got stuck in the deluge.</p>
      <p>Several shops and homes in the southeast had their basements flooded. — AFP</p>
