        <b>What’s your band called, mate?</b>
      </p>
      <p>“To finally end all this confusion we are called Sweat.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>We are…</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Dentist, The Gambler, The Mathematician, The Nobleman, and The Wildcard</p>
      <p>Bass, Vocals, Drums, Synth and Guitar – not in that order, it should be obvious which is which!</p>
      <p>
        <b>What do you sound like?</b>
      </p>
      <p>“Microwaved microchips.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>Are you any good (honestly)?</b>
      </p>
      <p>“Good Good double good!”</p>
      <p>
        <b>What’s your best song?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Nobleman: Director</p>
      <p>The Gambler: Director</p>
      <p>The Mathematician: Director</p>
      <p>The Wildcard: Director</p>
      <p>The Dentist: What Men Want</p>

        <b>What’s been your most memorable gig?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Dentist: “Last year I was living in an abandoned asylum, and the day before it was due to be demolished we threw a big party with our friends WOOZE, who also lived in there. The audience took “demolition” to heart, and inhibitions were lost in a spectacular way.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>Tell us something really interesting about you, that isn’t to do with music.</b>
      </p>
      <p>“There is nothing beyond music.</p>
      <p>
        <b>We said really interesting…</b>
      </p>
      <p>“Really!”</p>
      <p>
        <b>What is your karaoke song?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Gambler: ‘Two Can Play That Game’ – Bobby Brown.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Scenario: We’ve given you a shit load of money to make a big budget video – what do you do </b>
      </p>
      <p>Gambler: “Firstly thank you very much. We’d probably put the money into length rather than quality, so probably a trilogy of pretty ropey feature length intergalactic rock operas.”</p>
      <p>Dentist: “A feature length animé.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>What do you want to achieve with your music?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Gambler: “I want to achieve the unachievable.”</p>
      <p>Dentist: “I believe the greatest musical achievement is to have your work in the Karaoke songbook.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>If your tour bus was hanging over the edge of a cliff and you needed to throw out one band member as ballast, which member would it be and why?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Dentist: “I would throw myself off because I am a selfless individual.”</p>
      <p>The Mathematician: “Ballast. No Ballast. All go down.”</p>
      <p>The Nobleman: “The Dentist”</p>
      <p>The Wildcard: “The Nobleman”</p>
      <p><b>Fill in the blanks: </b>When you listen to our music, it feels like <b>everything</b> is <b>going</b> your <b>way</b>.</p>
      <p>
        <b>If your band had ‘stans’ (superfans, like Katy Perry’s Kitty Cats or Lady Gaga’s Little Monsters), what would the name for them be?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Dentist: Droplets or maybe mist. Condensation.</p>
      <p>Maths: Probably Sweatz. Up to them!</p>
      <p>
        <b>Where can we see you next?</b>
      </p>
      <p>“20th of Nov we’re throwing a single launch party with our friends Deep Tan (who are also celebrating their recent double A side), and our friends Waterbaby who shot the garage scene of our video! It’s at Peckham Audio, a brand new club on rye lane, finally south London is getting somewhere new to replace all the places that keep closing :(“</p>
      <p>
        <b>What do you want to happen at your last ever show?</b>
      </p>
      <p>“This will never end.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>Any final words?</b>
      </p>
      <p>“It’s not over yet! This is meant to be a comeback!”</p>
