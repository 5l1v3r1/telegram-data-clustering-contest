      <h1>Dr M: No problem with India, China wants peace in South China Sea</h1>

      <p>BANGKOK, Nov 3 — Malaysia remains friendly with India and is keen for both countries to enjoy better business relations, Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad said today after fears of a trade backlash over his remarks about its restive Kashmir region previously.</p>
      <p>The prime minister had earlier participated in the 16th Asean-India Summit, which was among several related meetings held in conjunction with the 35th Asean Summit hosted by Thailand this year.</p>
      <p>“With India, we have no problem. Basically, we want to increase trade and investment.</p>
      <p>“We find India to be very positive on these issues and hope it will be translated into action by India and Asean countries,” he told Malaysian media this afternoon.</p>
      <p>Some Indian trade organisations have been pushing its government to boycott importing Malaysian palm oil products after Dr Mahathir criticised the republic’s military action in the Muslim-majority Kashmir region.</p>
      <p>But the Indian government has not officially made a stand on the boycott call.</p>
      <p>Malaysia, together with Indonesia, are the world’s biggest producer of palm oil products. Both South-east Asian nations have come under pressure from the west for its vast oil palm plantations, with campaigners claiming the large-scale farming was causing deforestation and loss of precious flora and fauna.</p>
      <p>Dr Mahathir also said China, which is also attending a separate summit with Asean member states, has been positive to the geo-political and economic concerns raised during talks.</p>
      <p>“China also subscribes to a peaceful South China Sea,” he said, without elaborating.</p>
      <p>The Asian powerhouse and the US, which are facing off against each other economically, have been increasing their military presence in the South China Sea in recent months.</p>
      <p>The resource rich sea lies within the territorial waters of several countries in South-east Asia.</p>
