        <b>The 2019 F1 season is almost over and that means most qualifying battles between teammates have been decided. Just <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/carlos-sainz">Carlos Sainz</a> and <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/lando-norris">Lando Norris</a> remain in battle as the two <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/mclaren">McLaren</a> drivers can't be separated. </b>
      </p>
      <p>Sainz leads the way going into the final two Grands Prix of the season meaning he needs to qualify ahead of Norris just once in either Brazil or Abu Dhabi to come out on top. The teammate duels are important in deciding which driver is best within a team. Check the list below! </p>

      <p>With<a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/george-russell"> George Russell</a> finishing ahead of <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/robert-kubica">Robert Kubica</a> again ahead of the United States Grand Prix, it's still possible that the British driver can complete a 100% win record over his Williams teammate. </p>
      <p>Bottas' pole position for the race in Austin means he has recorded one more pole position than <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/lewis-hamilton">Lewis Hamilton</a> across the course of the season, but Hamilton remains on top in terms out of out-qualifying Bottas. </p>
