      <p>Want to purchase either a Hyundai Venue or a Hyundai Verna in petrol-manual form, which of these is a better buy?</p>
      <p>I want to buy a new petrol-manual car in the range of Rs 11-14 lakh. Which one would be better in between the Hyundai Venue and Verna?</p>
      <p>

      <p><b>AAA -</b> If you are keen on a Hyundai and will be mainly driving yourself, then we suggest the Venue over the Verna, because this new compact SUV is a nicer car to drive. Whilst the Verna has a better interior and good features, the Venue has the latest technology, especially the suite of connected features that add a wide range of functions. Also, the Venue has a wonderful 1.0 turbo-petrol that is smooth and punchy and heightens driving pleasure, especially when mated to the 6-speed manual gearbox. This engine comes with a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission as well, which is more convenient in the city but not as involving to drive as the manual.</p>
