      <p>MUNICH (AP) — Bayern Munich has fired coach Niko Kovac one day after the German champion slumped to its heaviest Bundesliga defeat in more than 10 years.</p>
      <p>Bayern lost 5-1 at Kovac’s former team Eintracht Frankfurt on Saturday, the team’s second league loss and the fifth game from 10 in which it has dropped points this season.</p>
      <p>Bayern says Kovac’s assistant, Hansi Flick, will take over “for the time being” and will be in charge for Wednesday’s Champions League game at home against Olympiakos.</p>
      <p>Bayern is four points behind leader Borussia Mönchengladbach in the Bundesliga.</p>
      <p>The 48-year-old Kovac had been in charge since the beginning of last season, when he led Bayern to a German cup and league double.</p>
