      <h1>Donald Cerrone texts Dana White about potential Conor McGregor fight</h1>
      <h2>McGregor revealed his plans for a return to the Octagon last month - with Cerrone in the frame to face him</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T12:13:58+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 12:13</time> by <a rel="author">James Whaling, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/james-whaling/</a></address>
      <p>Donald Cerrone had a very simple message for UFC supremo Dana White regarding a potential bout with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/conor-mcgregor">Conor McGregor</a> .</p>
      <p>The Irishman confirmed last month he is set to return to the Octagon in the new year, pencilling in a January 18 date in Las Vegas.</p>
      <p>Speculation has been rife over the identity of his opponent - with Cerrone the favourite to face him in Sin City.</p>
      <p>And 'Cowboy' text White over the bout - saying: "I hope this is true."</p>
      <p>McGregor has been inactive since being choked out by Khabib Nermagomedov last October.</p>
      <p>He plans on fighting three times next year - against Cerrone, Jorge Masvidal - who beat Nate Diaz on Saturday night - and a rematch with Nurmagomedovin Moscow.</p>

      <p>Coach John Kavanagh told ESPN: "Like (UFC president) Dana [White] said nothing is 100 per cent until all contracts are signed. I do, as far as I am aware all parties have agreed more or less in principle.</p>
      <p>"There may be a few kinks to be ironed out. But, as far as I am aware, hopefully, an announcement is imminent.</p>
      <p>“I’m just happy to see him back competing and is in a great mindset. We are training away, chipping away.</p>
      <p>It is 11 weeks tomorrow and ticking all the boxes. I can’t wait for the announcement so we can be full steam ahead.</p>

      <p>"But, I am sure it is, I actually had in my head maybe during this event they are going to do an ad or something, I don’t know, maybe that is coming.</p>
      <p>"I hope so, I hope so. Actions not words so let’s just do it in 2020. I feel I’ve been talking about it for two years or something.</p>
      <p>"He is very pumped up, I like how is talking about it being a season and has three fights in mind. First on January 18, then April, then September.</p>
      <p>"I haven’t heard that type of very structured talk for him in a long time. But, let’s do actions not words."</p>
