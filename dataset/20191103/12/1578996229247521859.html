      <h1>Princess Charlotte Looks Exactly Like Her Cousin Lady Kitty Spencer as a Kid</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T12:51:00+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 12:51</time> by <a rel="author">Alyssa Bailey</a></address>
      <p>Princess Charlotte has <a href="https://www.hellomagazine.com/royalty/2019010166077/princess-charlotte-identical-to-prince-william-new-photo-revealed/">her dad Prince William's eyes</a>, her uncle <a href="https://www.elle.com/uk/life-and-culture/a28654947/princess-charlotte-stick-out-tongue-prince-harry/">Prince Harry's childhood sass</a>, and pretty astounding resemblance overall to her cousin Lady Kitty Spencer. Those Spencer genes are strong.</p>
      <p>Kitty, a 28-year-old model and the late Princess Diana's niece, shared a new childhood photo on her Instagram this weekend where it's hard not to see William and Kate Middleton's four-year-old daughter Charlotte in kid Kitty's face:</p>

      <p>This is not the first time Kitty has been called for looking like Charlotte as a kid, as <i><a href="https://www.hellomagazine.com/royalty/2019110380046/princess-charlotte-identical-lady-kitty-spencer-new-photo/">Hello!</a> </i>pointed out. The model shared another childhood shot where several commenters marveled over the Princess Charlotte resemblance:</p>

      <p><i>Us Weekly </i><a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a29640237/prince-george-princess-charlotte-louis-home-life-details/">ran a report</a> earlier this week about Charlotte and what her life at home with her two brothers Prince George and Prince Louis is like. Personality-wise, "Charlotte’s extremely confident and loves attention," a source told the outlet.</p>
      <p>She sometimes will bicker with her older, six-year-old brother George, like most siblings do. “[It’s] usually over silly things like toys or what TV shows they want to watch,” Us' source said. “But most of the time they get on.”</p>
      <p>The kids are pretty crafty and create a lot of things with their parents Kate and William: "They love playing together and being creative," the source said. "Painting, baking and building things are all activities they enjoy, and now that Louis’ a bit older [Louis is one now], he gets involved too."</p>
