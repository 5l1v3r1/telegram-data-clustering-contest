      <h2>Mirror Motoring's Colin Goodwin says you’re getting a 180mph hell of a cool car for bang on £45,000 with the Chevrolet Camaro</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T12:28:51+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 12:28</time> by <a rel="author">Colin Goodwin, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/colin-goodwin/</a></address>
      <p>The last time I drove a Chevrolet Camaro was in Skegness.</p>
      <p>The car was yellow with two fat black stripes across its bonnet and attracted a lot of attention.</p>
      <p>Particularly from small boys pulling on parents’ arms and pointing furiously at the car.</p>
      <p>Eventually a youngster came up and explained I was driving Bumblebee, a character from the Transformers movie.</p>
      <p>Well there you go – out of touch as usual.</p>
      <p>The Camaro we’re testing today is a 6th generation model and has moved on a long way from that Bumblebee replica six years ago.</p>
      <p>There is only one official UK dealer that can sell you a new Chevrolet Camaro (or Corvette) and that’s Ian Allan Motors in Surrey.</p>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>Its looks stand out a mile</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The firm has bought up the last type-approved Camaros available and – since it’s possible Chevrolet will not build the car after this generation – it could be the last new one I ever drive.</p>
      <p>In America, the Camaro goes head to head with the Ford Mustang and has been doing so since 1967.</p>
      <p>General Motors has never thought to build the car in right-hand drive and has probably lost out on a lot of sales. Ford has sold 8,500 Mustangs in the UK since it started importing RHD cars.</p>
      <p>It’s a great shame because the Camaro is a hell of a cool car and, like the Mustang, it’s a relative bargain.</p>
      <p>Also it’s available with a four-cylinder turbocharged engine just like the Ford.</p>
      <p>Yet although it provides adequate performance, it doesn’t make the right noise – and that’s half the point of an American muscle car.</p>
      <p>Our white Camaro has the essential 6.2-litre V8 engine.</p>
      <p>It’s virtually the same as the one fitted to the Corvette but has 453bhp to the Vette’s 466bhp.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p> </p>
      <p>A more substantial difference is that the Corvette is lighter which is why it is 0.5sec faster to 60mph than the 2+2 seats Camaro.</p>
      <p>Not that the latter’s 4.6secs is anything to be embarrassed about.</p>
      <p>Our car has an eight-speed automatic gearbox.</p>
      <p>I’ve driven a manual and the automatic is easier to live with.</p>
      <p>Better still, you can only get the system that shuts down four of the engine’s eight cylinders on part throttle with the automatic gearbox.</p>
      <p>It’s good to have because it substantially improves fuel consumption.</p>
      <p>A big car with a very big V8 engine is never going to be frugal, but you’ll easily get 25mpg out of the Camaro.</p>
      <p>I love its looks.</p>

        <figcaption>There's not much wrong with it (Image: Lisa Linke)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The grey of our test car is a bit boring and I’d either choose another colour or would jazz it up with stripes.</p>
      <p>You could have a lot of fun messing around and modifying it because the after-market industry in the US is huge.</p>
      <p>Louder exhaust, trick suspension, go-faster parts for the engine; it’s all available.</p>
      <p>Not that there’s much wrong with the car as it is.</p>
      <p>You’re getting a 180mph car for bang on £45,000.</p>
      <p>What’s more, the Camaro is better finished than it used to be with essentials like satnav and Apple CarPlay.</p>
      <p>There are different driving modes to play with – from Normal through Sport to Track.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>Sport is perfect for everyday driving as it doesn’t firm up the suspension too much.</p>
      <p>I’d even take this car on a few track days.</p>
      <p>Brembo brakes are standard and would be well up to the task of stopping it on a circuit.</p>
      <p>In America the Camaro is about the same price as a Ford Focus which is why so many college kids have them.</p>
      <p>Many US car rental companies have Camaros on their fleets – so if you’re over there on holiday have a go in one.</p>
      <p>Be careful though, the bug might bite.</p>

      <p>Looks great but hasn’t the Camaro’s character and raw grunt.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Ford Mustang</b>
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20757894.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Ford-Mustang.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>The Ford Mustang will set you back £45,050</figcaption>
      </figure>

        <figcaption>BMW's M4 is a whopping £62,300</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Lots more money and everyone’s got one. And it has fewer cylinders.</p>
