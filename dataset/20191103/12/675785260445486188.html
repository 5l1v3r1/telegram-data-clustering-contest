      <p>Stacey Solomon was determined that the last night of her luxurious Maldives family holiday would be celebrated in style.</p>
      <p>The Loose women star - and very proud mum - dressed herself, her three sons and boyfriend Joe Swash in matching blue outfits for their final evening in paradise.</p>
      <p>Stacey, 30, shared a snap of the five of them posing in their finery in front of a stunning beach backdrop as they headed off to dinner.</p>
      <p>The former I'm A Celebrity winner donned a deep blue mini-dress that perfectly co-ordinated with the shade of boyfriend Joe's shirt and shorts.</p>

      <p>Little baby Rex even got in on the action in a waistcoat, trousers and adorable blue bow tie.</p>
      <p>Stacey then told her <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> followers how they'd spent their last night watching the sunset, playing on the beach, eating some of the five star cuisine and dancing to their favourite songs.</p>
      <p>"Boys I love you more than you could ever know," she told them via social media.</p>
      <p>The reality star also let fans know she would be turning her phone off for a few hours as she was determined to enjoy some quality family time.</p>

      <p>The next morning, she was back to reveal how she and son Leighton went snorkelling in the crystal clear waters while the others were fast asleep.</p>
      <p>Stacey landed in the Maldives with her three sons last week - leaving Joe Swash at home.</p>
      <p>After much pining from Stacey, Joe finally joined them in the idyllic island of Raa Atoll after days apart.</p>
