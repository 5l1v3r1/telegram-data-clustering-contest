      <p>Donald Trump is in attendance at UFC 244, with the US President walking to his seat prior to the start of the pay-per-view portion of the event. Trump got notoriously booed attending a World Series game, but he did get mixed reactions from the crowd during this MMA event.</p>
      <p>As he was slowly walking to his seat, Trump was heavily booed by the crowd.</p>

      <p>It wasn’t all boos though, there were also some noticeable cheers as he got to his seat, specifically when he started waving to some people.</p>

      <p>Dana White has been very vocal about his support of the President, even being part of his campaign a few years back. The show’s headliner fighting for a “BMF” belt, Jorge Masvidal has also voiced support for Trump this week, saying he’s a “cool” and “bad motherf—ker.”</p>
      <p>“I think real recognize real,” Masvidal said. “No matter what your views are on Trump as a president, the guy’s a bad (expletive), man. The money that he’s made, the obstacles that he’s conquered. He’s a bad (expletive) in his own way. No matter what your political views are.”</p>
      <p>“Trump’s a cool (expletive). I don’t want to get too much into politics though, you know, a lot of my Latin community might be upset at me so I’m not going to dabble into politics right now.”</p>
