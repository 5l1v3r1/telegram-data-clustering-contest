      <p>Airbnb Inc. says it's banning "party houses'' in the wake of a deadly shooting at an Airbnb rental in California.</p>
      <p>Airbnb co-founder and CEO Brian Chesky said in a series of tweets Saturday that the San Francisco-based company is stepping up efforts to "combat unauthorized parties and get rid of abusive host and guest conduct.''</p>
      <p>Chesky says Airbnb is expanding manual screening of "high risk'' reservations and forming a rapid response team dedicated to house parties.</p>

      <p>Chesky said the company will remove guests who fail to comply.</p>
      <p>Five people were killed in a Halloween party shooting Thursday night in the San Francisco suburb of Orinda.</p>
      <p>People with knowledge of the transaction say the woman who rented the home lied to her Airbnb host, saying she was renting it for family members.</p>
