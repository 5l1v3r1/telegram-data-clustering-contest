      <p>Joseph McDonald, 22, allegedly murdered seven-week-old Lucas McDonald at Clayton, in south-east Melbourne, on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The father, from Benalla in Victoria’s north-east, appeared in the Melbourne magistrates court on Sunday charged with murder.</p>

      <p>The lawyer also noted the accused was vulnerable in custody due to his age and appearance.</p>
      <p>McDonald handed himself in to a Melbourne police station on Saturday.</p>
      <p>He has been remanded to reappear in court on Monday for a filing hearing.</p>
