      <p>Posting a photo of a baby, Deepika wrote, “post Diwali celebrations.” The <i>Padmaavat</i> actress concluded her post with a ‘sleeping’ emoji and #diwali.</p>
      <p>Deepika’s husband Ranveer Singh was the first to respond to her post with a series of heart-eyes emojis. While others responded with questions on who the baby was in the photo. Then there were those, who asked if Deepika was trying to send a hidden message here.</p>

      <p>One fan wrote, “Good news coming soon?” Another commented, “<i>Ab baby planning chal rhi hai </i>(Now baby planning is taking place).” “Are you thinking what I am thinking?” asked another fan.</p>
      <p>What fuelled speculations on Deepika’s pregnancy was another post with a baby’s photo by the actress.</p>

      <p>Many felt that photos shared by Deepika were her own from her childhood and she was simply trying to highlight her priority after Diwali celebrations. The photos of a sleeping baby, according to many fans, was to suggest that she preferred to spend her time sleeping after Diwali.</p>
      <p>Deepika and Ranveer had tied the knot in Italy last year with the who’s who of the Indian entertainment industry attending their reception parties in Mumbai.</p>
