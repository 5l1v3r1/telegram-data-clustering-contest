Speak English,'" said Michell. "'We don't want you here, if you're going to be here talk in English.'"<br/><br/>Then it escalated.<br/><br/>Michell says the girl started something with her friend, who was speaking Spanish.<br/><br/>"I told her, 'What is your problem? You don't have to be rude just because we're Latino. We have the same rights as you,'" she said. "That's when she started hitting me."<br/><br/>Michell says she was left with bruises and bumps on her head but, it's the emotional wounds that are still healing.<br/><br/>"When I go to bed, I go crying.

Katy ISD campus administration and police immediately investigated and administered disciplinary consequences pertaining to that report. While FERPA protects the privacy of students involved in both open and closed investigations, campus and District staff take great care in ensuring families are well-informed about policy and procedures.
