      <p>LOS ANGELES (AP) â€” The Latest on California wildfires (all times local):</p>
      <p>7:40 p.m.</p>
      <p>Ventura County officials say firefighters contained 30% of the Maria Fire, which has burned nearly 15 square miles (39 sq. kilometers) and continues to threaten more than 2,500 homes and other buildings.</p>
      <p>The officials add that the humidity is expected to stay low and winds will be more favorable to firefighting in Southern California.</p>
      <p>The fire began Thursday during what had been expected to be the tail end of Santa Ana winds that fanned destructively across Southern California.</p>
      <p>While the cause of the fire hasn't been determined, Southern California Edison reported Friday that it had re-energized a high-voltage power line minutes before a nearby hilltop exploded into a blaze.</p>
      <p>Edison had earlier turned off the line due to heavy winds.</p>

      <p>Authorities have lifted evacuation orders for a farm community as firefighters make progress on a large wildfire in Southern California.</p>
      <p>Ventura County officials allowed residents of Somis to return home Saturday morning after firefighters contained 20% of the Maria Fire, which has burned nearly 15 square miles (39 sq. kilometers) and continues to threaten more than 2,500 homes and other buildings.</p>

      <p>Crews fought a pitched battle against the last remaining large wildfire in Southern California as the stubborn flames threatened nearly 2,000 homes and other buildings.</p>
      <p>The fire that erupted on a hilltop northwest of Los Angeles headed for what would be its third day Saturday and firefighters were finding it hard work as shifting winds made the front line a moving target.</p>
      <p>The Maria Fire had burned some 15 square miles (38 square kilometers) and prompted evacuation orders for nearly 11,000 people since it began Thursday evening.</p>
      <p>Eastern Ventura, Camarillo, Somis and Santa Paula were at risk, Ventura County fire officials said.</p>
      <p>On Friday, a tug of war developed between onshore and offshore winds.</p>
      <p>Winds and skin-cracking low humidity were expected to make Saturday another difficult day for firefighters.</p>
