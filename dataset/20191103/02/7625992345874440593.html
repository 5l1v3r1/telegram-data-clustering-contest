      <h1>Trump booed at UFC event in New York City</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T02:52:28+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 02:52</time> by <a rel="author">Caroline Linton</a></address>
      <p>President Trump was greeted with boos — along with some cheers too —  at an Ultimate Fighting Championship match Saturday night at Madison Square Garden. Mr. Trump was seated with House Minority leader <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-is-impeachment-what-is-the-step-by-step-process-and-what-happens-next-if-president-trump-is-impeached-after-inquiry/">Kevin McCarthy</a> of California, Congressman Mark Meadows of North Carolina, Congressman Peter King of New York and his sons Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump.</p>
      <p>Trump Jr. disputed they were booed at the event. <a href="https://twitter.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/1190833738676129792">In a tweet</a> that was later retweeted by Mr. Trump, Trump Jr. wrote "when we walked into the arena it was overwhelmingly positive."</p>
      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/EricTrump/status/1190833489609940994">Eric Trump tweeted</a> the crowd was cheering "Donald Trump, Donald Trump ... USA, USA." </p>
      <p>Pro MMA fighter Tara LaRosa — who has #MAGA written in her Twitter bio — <a href="https://twitter.com/TaraLaRosa/status/1190837453696856065">tweeted a video she said</a> showed Mr. Trump received a "positive reaction" from the crowd when he arrived. </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-booed-world-series-lock-him-up-chant-break-out-during-game-5-washington-nationals-stadium-pa/">Mr. Trump was booed earlier this week</a> at the World Series in Washington, D.C. </p>
      <p>Madison Square Garden appeared to be packed, according to pool reports. The venue has a capacity of 20,000.</p>
      <p>There were reports of some protests outside the venue as well. Mr. Trump is very unpopular in New York City.</p>
      <p>UFC 244 is headlined by a bout for the "BMF" championship between Nate Diaz and Jorge Masvidal, according to <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/mma/news/president-donald-trump-planning-to-be-in-attendance-for-ufc-244-in-new-york/">CBS Sports</a>. Masvidal has recently verbally battled with former teammate Colby Covington, an outspoken supporter of Mr. Trump and who is rarely seen outside the cage without a "Make America Great Again" hat.  </p>

      <p>Earlier this week, Masvidal called Mr. Trump a "cool motherf******."</p>
      <p>"I don't want to get too much into politics though, you know, a lot of my Latin community might be upset at me so I'm not going to dabble into politics right now, my brother," Masvidal said.</p>
      <p>Mr. Trump has a long relationship with UFC. In 2001, Mr. Trump provided the league with a home at his Taj Mahal hotel in Atlantic City. UFC president Dana White enthusiastically endorsed Mr. Trump at the 2016 Republican National Convention.</p>
      <p>"Arenas around the world refused to host our events," White had said in his speech at the convention. "Nobody took us seriously; nobody except Donald Trump. Donald was the first guy that recognized the potential that we saw in the UFC and encouraged us to build our business."</p>
      <p>Mr. Trump arrived in New York City earlier Saturday. He will spend the night at <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-tower-new-york-city-fire-today-manhattan-firefighters-injured-2018-04-07/">Trump Tower</a>, his longtime home on 5th Avenue. Mr. Trump, a lifelong New Yorker, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-primary-residence-trump-moving-primary-residence-from-new-york-city-to-florida/">announced earlier this week</a> that he changed his primary residence to Mar-a-Lago. </p>
