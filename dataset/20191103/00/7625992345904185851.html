      <p>Rudy Boesch, a retired tough-as-nails Navy SEAL and fan favorite on the inaugural season of "Survivor," has died after a long battle with Alzheimer's disease. He was 91.</p>
      <p>He died peacefully Friday night in hospice care in Virginia Beach, Virginia, surrounded by loved ones, said Steve Gonzalez, director of operations for the Seal Veterans Foundation. "Survivor" executive producer <a href="https://twitter.com/jeffprobst/status/1190786085464358912?s=21">Jeff Probst confirmed the news on Twitter</a>, calling Boesch "a true American hero."</p>

      <p>Boesch joined the Navy in 1944 and became one of the first SEALs in 1962. He served two combat tours during the Vietnam War, earning a Bronze Star for heroism, and retired from the Navy in 1990 as a master chief petty officer.</p>
      <p>Before his retirement, Boesch was honored as "Chief SEAL," or "Bullfrog." The title marks his time as the longest-serving SEAL still on active duty. He remained involved after he left the Navy, serving on the board of directors of the UDT Seal Association.</p>
      <p>"He was a legend in the Seal teams long before 'Survivor,'" Gonzalez said. "Rudy was beloved by all and will be deeply missed."</p>

      <p>At 72, Boesch was the oldest contestant ever on the CBS show, taking third place the first year, 2000, on "Survivor: Borneo." He proved so popular as a no-nonsense but loveable character that he was invited back for the eighth season, "Survivor: All Stars."</p>
      <p>During the first season, Boesch was a close ally of the winner, Richard Hatch.</p>
      <p>Boesch's wife of 53 years, Marjorie Thomas, died in 2008. They have three daughters.</p>
      <p>Funeral arrangements were not immediately announced Saturday.</p>
