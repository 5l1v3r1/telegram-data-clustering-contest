      <p>PLAINS, Ga. (AP) - Former President <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jimmy-carter/">Jimmy Carter</a> is back at church teaching Sunday school less than two weeks after breaking his pelvis in a fall.</p>
      <p>The 95-year-old Democrat used a walker to slowly enter the crowded sanctuary at Maranatha Baptist Church in the southwest Georgia town of Plains on Sunday.</p>
      <p>He sat on a motorized lift chair at the front of the room to teach a 45-minute lesson on life after death. More than 400 people were on hand.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jimmy-carter/">Carter</a> was briefly hospitalized and has since been recovering at home since fracturing his pelvis on Oct. 21. He also fell a few days before that and needed stitches above his left eye.</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jimmy-carter/">Carter</a> is the oldest U.S. ex-President ever and has been teaching Bible lessons since he was in his teens.</p>
