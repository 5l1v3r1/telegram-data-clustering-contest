      <p>LONDON (AP) - Former champion <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/leicester/">Leicester</a> continued its strong showing in the Premier League this season with a 2-0 win at <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/crystal-palace/">Crystal Palace</a> on Sunday.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/leicester/">Leicester</a> moved third after Turkey defender Caglar Söyüncü opened the scoring with his first goal for the club in the 57th minute, when he was left free to head in after a deflected corner.</p>
      <p>Jamie Vardy sealed the result in the 88th after a fine combination with Demarai Gray.</p>
      <p>Palace failed to register an effort on target in the first half. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/leicester/">Leicester</a> goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel tipped away former teammate Jeffrey Schlupp’s deflected effort before Jonny Evans blocked Luka Milivojevic’s low effort in the second.</p>
      <p>Schmeichel was forced to kick away several objects thrown onto the field from fans in the first half.</p>
