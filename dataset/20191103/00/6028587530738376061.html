      <p>Italy does winter in great style, with plenty of things to see beyond the usual visitor bucket-list stops. Here are 16 ideas for cold-weather months, ranging from World Cup downhill ski races and holiday markets in the Italian Alps to a Milan show devoted to Federico Fellini, along with ideas for ringing in the New Year in Venice, Rome and Genoa. (A few not-to-miss items were included even if they occur before the official start of winter on December 21.)<b>ITALIAN ALPS</b></p>

      <p><b>1. Head to the mountains for all the Christmas markets</b>. While you’ll find great holiday markets throughout Italy, they come with a rich Alpine vibe in the country’s northern regions. Among the best known are those in the South Tyrol cities of Bolzano and Merano, where traditions, food, and crafts reflect the area’s hybrid Austro-Italian heritage. For a holiday market in a smaller setting, consider the one held in Italy’s northernmost town, Vipiteno (also known as Sterzing in this bi-lingual area). The markets, which are especially beautiful at night with all the lighted decorations, open November 28 or 29 and run to January 6.</p>
      <p><b>2.Visit Cortina D’Ampezzo for Fashion Weekend.</b> This historic resort, which hosted the 1956 Winter Olympics (and with Milan will be the site of them again in 2026), has long been a jet-set magnet, known for its style, great skiing and apres-ski pizzazz. In early December (this year the 6th to 8th), Cortina stages a <a href="https://www.cortinaforus.it/cortina-fashion-weekend/">Fashion Weekend</a>, jump-starting holiday activities with a major dose of chic. There are cocktail gatherings, parties, a sporting “village” on Mount Faloria, where you can have a look at the latest ski gear, along with late-night shopping, a light show, and charity ski race.</p>

      <p><b>3.Watch the best downhillers in the world compete for the FIS Alpine Ski World Cup on some of Italy’s best-known racing courses. </b>Head to Val Gardena/Gröden in the Dolomites on December 21 for the men’s downhill race on the <a href="https://www.saslong.org/en/">Saslong</a> course, famed for its difficult “camel hump” stretch. The race ends at the pretty Alpine town of Santa Cristina. Other World Cup men’s downhill races take place in Italy in Bormio on December 28 on the <a href="https://www.bormioski.eu/en/skiing/ski-area/stelvio-slope/">Stelvio course</a>, among the most challenging on the international racing circuit, and in Cortina D’Ampezzo on <a href="https://skiworldcupfinalscortina2020.com/en/">March 18, 2020</a> (Vertigine course), when a women’s downhill race will also be held (Olympia delle Tofane course).</p>

      <p><b>4</b>.With its <i>calli,</i> or streets, and arcades dripping with lights and the Christmas tree glittering in the Piazza San Marco, Venice becomes an even more mystically beautiful city during the holiday season. <b>Ring in the New Year at one of La Serenissima’s newest properties, the</b><a href="https://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/vcexr-the-st-regis-venice/"><b> St. Regis Venice, </b></a>a stylish and sleek addition to the iconic hotel brand’s luxury holdings. Involving an extensive renovation of five palazzi, the hotel, located in what once was the Grand Hotel Britannia, where notable guests included the painters Monet and John Singer Sargent, lies opposite Santa Maria della Salute on the Grand Canal, and is a short hop to the Piazza San Marco and Harry’s Bar. Appropriately, considering the past roster of guests, the hotel is inviting select artists to stay at the property to create works inspired by it and the locale. Pieces by the first in-residence artist, noted French painter Olivier Masmonteil, are now part of the art-filled hotel’s collection.</p>

      <p><b>5.Take in the New Year’s fireworks which dazzle over the waters of the Venetian lagoon</b>. A great way to start the evening (and say goodbye to 2019) is with dinner at a sumptuous restaurant along the Grand Canal, like the Gritti Palace’s<b> </b><a href="https://www.clubdeldoge.com/">Club del Doge</a>, which is planning a very festive December 31st dinner. The menu will include a range of luxe tastes like a lobster and caviar starter and pumpkin risotto with truffles, among other scrumptious offerings. To kick off the evening there’s a Champagne and oyster tasting in the hotel’s Longhi Bar and at midnight a lentil dish will be served–according to Italian tradition the legumes are thought to bring good fortune in the New Year.

      <p><b>7.See the lighting of the Vatican Christmas Tree. </b>Rome’s answer to New York’s Rockefeller Center stunner sparkles in St. Peter’s Square. This is a fairly recent tradition, started by Pope John Paul II, who was from Poland and introduced the Northern European custom to the Vatican in 1982. The tree lighting is on Saturday, December 7.</p>

      <p><b>8.Go to Christmas Eve mass at St. Peter’s Basilica.</b> It’s the season’s hottest ticket and hard to get even though the basilica can hold up to 15,000 people, but you can try faxing requests to the <a href="http://www.papalaudience.org/papal-mass">Prefecture of the Papal Household</a> (which recommends doing so from two to six months in advance). The fewer tickets you ask for, the higher your chance of getting them. The mass, conducted by Pope Francis, is sometimes referred to as midnight mass, but it starts at 9:30 PM. No ticket required to see the mass televised to the large-screens set up in St Peter’s Square, which thousands turn up for. </p>

      <p><b>9.Attend a concert in a Roman setting you’ll never forget.</b> The Palazzo Doria Pamphilj is one of the Eternal City’s most magnificent palaces and an art-filled landmark—masterpieces in the collection include works by Titian and Raphael. Concerts are held in the palazzo at different times of the year, but one with a special holiday appeal is the <a href="https://www.classictic.com/en/new_year_s_eve_baroque_concert/24026/719045/">New Year’s Eve Baroque Concert.</a> (It is scheduled for 3 PM in the Throne Hall, so there’s plenty of time for evening revelry to welcome in 2020).</p>

      <p><b>10.Greet the New Year overlooking Rome</b>. If you’re one to muse about how fast the year or years have gone by on December 31, it’s hard to beat doing so with champagne flute in hand taking in nighttime views of the Eternal City with its centuries-spanning sites. The <a href="https://www.hotelhasslerroma.com/">Hassler Roma,</a> that spectacularly well-located five-star hotel perched above the Spanish Steps, has some great options for welcoming the New Year with those incomparable vistas: Guests at the hotel can toast 2020 in the Terrazza Panoramica on the seventh floor starting 11 PM; both guests and non-guests can book a lavish New Year’s Eve dinner at the Michelin-starred Imàgo, which also provides a striking vantage point from which to take in the night skyline of Rome. And if you want to start 2020 in grand style, the hotel is offering a special three-day <a href="https://www.hotelhasslerroma.com/en/promotions/a-sparkling-new-year-in-rome/51-28/">New Year’s package</a>—in addition to the luxe dinner at Imàgo or in the hotel’s Salone Eva on December 31 (followed by dancing at midnight), there’s afternoon tea, in-room Champagne, and a chaffeur to whisk you to and from the airport.</p>

Now it is Raphael’s turn (the great Renaissance painter died a year after Leonardo in 1520) with quincentennial shows planned or underway in different cities in Italy and abroad. “Raffaello 2020” at the Museo della Permanente in Milan presents the artists’s work and story with hi-tech dazzle in an immersive multi-media show (through February 2, 2020). “Raphael and His Friends of Urbino” at the Galleria Nazionale delle Marche in Urbino, his home town, runs through January 19, 2020.
