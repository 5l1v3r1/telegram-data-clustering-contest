      <h1>Leaked Strictly exit enrages fans as surprise couple is booted out</h1>
      <h2>Strictly Come Dancing fans have once again been left devastated as the result of Sunday's show have been leaked on Twitter</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T00:25:34+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 00:25</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Elliott, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/sam-elliott/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/strictly-come-dancing">Strictly</a> viewers have been left reeling again after after the results of Sunday's show were leaked online.</p>
      <p>The show is now filmed over one evening - and often spoilers get out on social media.</p>
      <p>With fans searching for gossip using the Strictly hashtag on twitter, many have stumbled across the result by accident.</p>
      <p>Mirror Online knows who has left the show but won't spoil the result for viewers keen to watch it unfold tomorrow.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>However some furious fans who have discovered the result have flocked to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> in fury. After a number of controversial exits in recent weeks, it doesn't seem like this Sunday's departure will please everyone either.</p>
      <p>The competition is heating up and week even produced many big moments.</p>
      <p>Karim Zeroual and Amy Dowden soared to the top of the leaderboard after their Quickstep performance - everyone loved it as they rose to the occasion.</p>
      <p>At the other end of the table are Emma Barton and Anton du Beke, who finished last on the leaderboard with 22.</p>
      <p>But who is leaving? Although of course we will keep tight-lipped, it has already been revealed online.</p>
      <p>Those who couldn't resist looking are not happy.</p>

      <p>"Absolute dog s**t" put another after discovering the dancers who get the boot.</p>

      <p>"Just seen the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/StrictlySpoiler?src=hashtag_click">#StrictlySpoiler</a> - what a f*cking joke. Absolutely livid," another posted on twitter.</p>
      <p>" <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/strictlyspoiler?src=hashtag_click">#strictlyspoiler</a> sad to see but I think fair enough" accepted another viewer.</p>
