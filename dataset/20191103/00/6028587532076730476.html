      <p>The notion of a Harriet Tubman biopic has been a measuring stick of sorts for years and years, with the absence thereof used as a prime example of Hollywood not valuing historically interesting or heroic black stories. That’s probably true, but now we have a Harriet Tubman biopic, from a black female filmmaker (Kasi Lemmons) no less. Yes, it’s a bit formulaic, borrowing the struture of  <i>Captain America: The First Avenger, </i>but it’s a solid biopic/superhero origin story hybrid. Cynthia Erivo is terrific and the film just works exactly as intended. Sometimes a good movie is a good movie. Anyway, I’m happy to note that audiences seem to be showing up, with the film netting a solid $12 million opening weekend. That’s a promising 3.07x multiplier from an A+ Cinemascore grade. That’s not a barn burner but Focus Features will likely call it a measured win.</p>
      <p>Warner Bros. released writer/director/producer/star Edward Norton’s <i>Motherless Brooklyn</i>, a long-gestating passion project, into 1,342 theaters. The $26 million adaptation of Jonathan Lethem’s novel stars Norton as a private investigator with Tourette’s trying to solve his mentor’s murder in the 1950s. Even with okay (but not superlative) reviews and a cast including Bruce Willis, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Alec Baldwin and Willem Dafoe, this is just the latest Warner Bros. drama to essentially call the bluff of moviegoers who claim to want sophisticated, star-driven, adult-skewing studio programmers.</p>
      <p>As sadly expected, the film earned $3.65 million, joining the honored dead (<i>Blinded by the Light, The Kitchen, The Sun is Also A Star </i>and <i>The Goldfinch</i>) as all parties hope for more robust results for <i>Doctor Sleep </i>next weekend. In that sense, <i>Joker </i>(which is over $900 million on a $60 million budget) is indeed a most conventional of tentpoles.</p>
      <p>Finally, we have Entertainment Studios’ animated flick <i>Artic Dogs</i>. The Jeremy Renner toon debuted yesterday with little in the way of hype or buzz, so it’s no shock that the $50 million (!) animated feature will gross just $3.1 million this weekend. I’ve got nothing more to say about this.</p>
      <p>The other newbie is the theatrical release, in eight theaters in New York and LA, of Martin Scorsese’s <i>The Irishman</i>. The 3.5-hour mob drama, starring Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci has earned rave reviews and strong buzz heading into the weekend. That said, it’s a Netflix film, due to debut on the streaming service on November 27, so even if it sets a record for per-theater averages for movies opening in more than six theaters (<i>Precious </i>earned $1.8 million in 18 theaters on this very weekend in 2009), we may never know.</p>
