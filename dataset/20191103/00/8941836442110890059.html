      <p>JOPLIN, Mo. (AP) - Less than five months after announcing plans for a dental school in Joplin, the Kansas City University of Medicine and Biosciences has raised 75% percent of its $40 million fundraising goal.</p>
      <p>The $40 million will make up half of the project’s $80 million cost, with the KCU pledging the other $40 million.</p>
      <p>The Joplin Globe reports supporters say the College of Dental Medicine will address a critical need for oral health care in underserved areas. Nearly all counties within a 125-mile radius of Joplin have a shortage of dental health providers.</p>
      <p>Current plans call for the first class of 80 students to start in 2022. A groundbreaking is scheduled for next year and a nationwide search for a dean is currently underway.</p>
