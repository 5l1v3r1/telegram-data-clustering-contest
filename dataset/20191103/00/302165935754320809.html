      <p>LONDON, Nov 3 — Ole Gunnar Solskjaer lamented a ‘lack of quality’ from his Manchester United side after their recent revival ended in a 1-0 Premier League defeat at Bournemouth yesterday.</p>
      <p>Joshua King’s volley close to halftime brought United down to earth after three successive away wins in all competitions and means they have still not won back-to-back Premier League games since Solskjaer was made permanent manager in March.</p>
      <p>Solskjaer had started with an attacking lineup featuring a front four of Marcus Rashford, Anthony Martial, Daniel James and Andreas Pereira but they made little impact after a bright start.</p>
      <p>The closest they came to equalising was through teenaged substitute Mason Greenwood late on as they huffed and puffed in windy conditions on the south coast.</p>
      <p>“The front four looked promising but flattered to deceive a little bit today,” said Solskjaer, whose side have 13 points from 11 games and sit in mid-table.</p>
      <p>“It looked like we could create chances but just didn’t have the last pass or last finish and that’s something we need to improve. We had a lack of quality at times in front of goal.</p>
      <p>“It was not a fantastic game of football. To win games you have to score goals.”</p>
      <p>Defeat left United seven points behind fourth-placed Chelsea who were in action at bottom club Watford later.</p>
      <p>“It’s one of those things that if you want to be challenging for top four, you need to be winning games like this,” Solskjaer said.</p>
      <p>“We’re disappointed. You have got to react, you have got to recover. We have two more games before the international break, we’ve got a chance on Thursday to qualify in Europe and then Brighton at home — so we need a response.” — Reuters</p>
