      <p>CAPE GIRARDEAU, Mo. (AP) - A program that helps young men reach their full potential is earning accolades from southeast Missouri leaders and members of the Missouri Legislature’s Black Caucus.</p>
      <p>The Southeast Missourian reports that the Honorable Young Men Club provides mentoring for students in the Cape Girardeau School District, but its organizers hope to expand elsewhere.</p>
      <p>The program was begun in 2016 by four former Southeast Missouri State University football players, including one now with the Baltimore Ravens, Aaron Adeoye. The others - Wyky Jean, Kweku Arkorful and Cantrell Andrews - recently hosted a gathering to show the benefits of the program. The event was organized by former Republican Lt. Gov. Peter Kinder.</p>
      <p>Co-founders of the nonprofit offer data showing that students who participate in the program have better grades, higher attendance and fewer suspensions than their peers.</p>
      <p>“Before I got into the program, I was fighting and being disrespectful and now I’m not doing that,” club member Glen Nesby said.</p>

      <p>Another, Demarius Mathies, cited the self-control he has learned, saying the program teaches “a different mindset of how you react to things.”</p>
      <p>Cape Girardeau Schools Superintendent Neil Glass urged lawmakers to find ways to replicate the program elsewhere.</p>
      <p>“I can’t say enough about these guys,” Glass said. “They have totally transformed so many students’ lives that I know of in particular.”</p>
      <p>The program began as a volunteer effort. Organizers initially provided 45 minutes of mentoring, one day a week, for each participant. The success was so quick that the program became wildly popular, rising from 35 participants in the first year to 185 the second.</p>

        <p>In fact, the founders said, the growth was perhaps too fast. Results dipped in that second year. The founders realized they needed to get back to the one-on-one relationships that made the HYMC successful.</p>
        <p>Today, the program caps the number of participants. There is a waiting list.</p>
        <p>Black Caucus lawmakers who attended the gathering hosted by Kinder saw potential.</p>
        <p>State Rep. Wiley Price, D-St. Louis, lauded the program’s one-on-one method of mentoring. State Rep. Kevin Windham, a St. Louis County Democrat and a former classmate of the founders at SEMO, was impressed by the way the participants carried themselves.</p>
        <p>That’s no accident, Jean said.</p>
        <p>“Soft skills,” Jean said. “We work on those a lot, and they’re doing great. Proud of them.”</p>
