      <p>MARICOPA, Ariz. (AP) - Authorities say a woman has been arrested for disorderly conduct after creating a messy situation in the courthouse parking lot in the town of Maricopa.</p>
      <p>Police say Tally Leto allegedly poured alcohol into the vehicle of a court client, let the air out of the man’s tires and spat on the windows before wiping them off.</p>
      <p>The owner of the vehicle didn’t want to prosecute Leto.</p>
      <p>But the court chose to press charges because Leto was on court property in the parking lot.</p>
      <p>As a result of being arrested last Monday, Leto failed to appear for her two criminal cases scheduled for later that day at Western Pinal Justice Court.</p>

      <p>The Maricopa Monitor reports that the two charges Leto was attending court for were criminal trespassing and disorderly conduct.</p>
