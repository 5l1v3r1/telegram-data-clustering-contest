      <p>Earlier today Microsoft <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/new-chromium-based-edge-logo/">released</a> a new icon for the upcoming Microsoft Edge web browser. Along with it, Microsoft also released a new Easter Egg for Edge Canary. Called SURF game, it allows users to surf and complete objectives to win.</p>
      <p>If you were having trouble finding how to enable the Easter Egg then here’s a handy guide that should help you enable the game. Do note that the game works only on the latest Canary build of Chromium-based Edge.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>To enable it, open Edge Canary and head to any website. Once there, click on the collection icon and create a new collection named “Microsoft Edge”. If you don’t see the Collections icon, then type “edge://flags#edge-collections” into the address bar and enable the collections flag.</li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li>Once done, click on add current page to add a new website to collections and right-click on it and select edit. Now remove the website text and replace it with “S.” (without quotes). Do this four times to make it spell S.U.R.F.</li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li>Now move the F. up to the R. and drag it back below to trigger the Easter Egg. You should now see another page added to your collection named “edge://surf”. Click on it to launch the game.</li>
      </ul>
