      <p>Russell T Davies has said if he had a Tardis he would travel back to the moment he first met his late partner.</p>
      <p>The Doctor Who writer cared for his husband Andrew Smith in the final years before his death.</p>
      <p>Davies said those eight years of care were the best of their relationship, and treasures the kindness of his late love.</p>

      <p>The writer said that if he had the power to time travel he would journey back to the moment in a Manchester club when they first met.</p>
      <p>He spoke on BBC Radio 4’s Desert Island Discs about his time with Smith, who was diagnosed with a brain tumour in 2011.</p>
      <p>Davies said: “People always say ‘where would you go if you had Tardis?’ I would go back to that club and be a bystander. We caught eyes. What a magic moment.”</p>
      <p>He added: “I became his carer. I was lucky enough to be able to do that.</p>
      <p>“Those eight years that I cared for him are our happiest years.</p>
      <p>“They were so intimate and so honest. Everything else just falls away. There’s no nonsense. He was properly cherished.</p>
      <p>“He will be in every good man I ever write now.”</p>
      <p>Smith died at home by the side of Davies, who praised the kindness of his long-term partner.</p>
      <p>The writer said there are many stories of love and emotion from the LGBT community still to tell, as that section of society has been silenced for so long.</p>
      <p>Davies says he has no issue in being called a “gay writer”, because there is such rich material to use from the community.</p>
      <p>He said: “Any sense of queernesss, any sense of otherness, is still very, very new.</p>
      <p>“We’ve always been there, behind the scenes, making the sensible decisions, for thousands of years.</p>
      <p>“As an ‘out’ society, we’re less than 50 years old really, and that’s nothing.</p>
      <p>“There are things that we said, things that we felt, emotions in our hearts that have not been put on screen yet, or on the page, or into fiction.</p>
      <p>“It’s all there to be celebrated, it’s wonderful, it’s rich, open territory.”</p>
      <p>The full interview with Davies can be heard on BBC Radio 4 at 11.15am.</p>
