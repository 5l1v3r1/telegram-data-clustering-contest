      <h1>German city declares "Nazi emergency"</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T00:39:26+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 00:39</time> by <a rel="author">CBS News</a></address>
      <p>A city in eastern Germany has declared a "Nazi emergency" to tackle the rise of the far-right. Dresden is the capital of Saxony, which is considered a stronghold of the far-right movement.</p>
      <p>"'Nazinotstand' means - similar to the climate emergency - that we have a serious problem. The open democratic society is threatened," local councilor Max Aschenbach, who tabled the motion, told <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-50266955">BBC News</a>.  </p>
      <p>Dresden's city council approved a resolution Wednesday night to 39 votes to 29 to pass the motion that declared "anti-democratic, anti-pluralist, misanthropic and right-wing-extremist attitudes and actions, including violence in Dresden, are occurring with increasing frequency."</p>
      <p>The motion was opposed by Germany's governing Christian Democrats (CDU), who said it was "primarily an intended provocation."</p>
      <p>"'State of emergency' means the collapse or a serious threat to public order," Jan Donhauser, chairman of the CDU City Council Group, told BBC News. "That is not given rudimentarily. Furthermore, the focus on 'right-wing extremism' does not do justice to what we need. We are the guardians of the liberal-democratic basic order and no violence, no matter from which extremist side it comes, is compatible with it."</p>

      <p>Aschenbach, who is a member of the left-leaning satirical political party Die Partei, said the city was not obliged to take any action following the adoption of his resolution, but that "theoretically, existing measures should be given a higher priority and future decisions should follow this."</p>
      <p>The anti-Islam and xenophobic movement PEGIDA, which stands for German for Patriotic Europeans against the Islamization of the West, began in Dresden in 2014, according to <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/germany-dresden-declares-nazi-emergency/a-51085539">Deutsche Walle</a>. The group regularly holds rallies in the city. </p>
      <p>According to Deutsche Walle, Saxony is a stronghold for the far-right party Alternative for Germany (AfD), which came in second in state elections in September.</p>
