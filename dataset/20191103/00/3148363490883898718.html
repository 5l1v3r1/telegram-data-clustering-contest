      <h1>Combat Veterans Call for Hero Dog 'Conan' to Receive Purple Heart</h1>
      <h2>Conan, the military K-​9 injured while chasing down now-deceased ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, should be awarded a Purple Heart for her heroic act despite being ineligible for the highly prized military decoration, say military combat veterans.</h2>

      <p>“Do I believe Conan should receive a Purple Heart for actions on target? Absolutely,” former Army Ranger Michael Bollinger <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/02/hero-dog-conan-injured-during-baghdadi-raid-deserves-purple-heart-vets/?utm_source=NYPTwitter&amp;utm_medium=SocialFlow&amp;utm_campaign=SocialFlow">told</a> the <i>New York Post</i>. “They’re out there with us every step of the way.”</p>
      <p>James Knuppenburg, who was awarded a Purple Heart after a sniper shot him in Kandahar, Afghanistan, concurs with Bollinger, also telling the <i>Post</i> that Conan deserves the medal.</p>

      <blockquote>I would love to see Conan presented a Purple Heart with a live ceremony. I think that the K9 is the most valuable asset on the ground. I don’t think that you can replicate through technology or any sort of weaponry what the K9 is capable of … Without a doubt I think that any award — including the medal of honor — should be able to be received by a K9.</blockquote>
      <p>Earlier this week, President Donald Trump announced Conan would visit the White House and shared a meme of himself awarding the heroic dog a Medal of Honor, prompting the establishment media to whip itself up into a fury.</p>

      <p>Following the successful raid on al-Baghdadi, Conan has returned to duty in the Middle East, per Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley.</p>
