      <p>The Nifty, for the most part of the session on November 1, traded in a narrow range of 70 points. It formed a Doji Candle on the daily chart but formed a Bullish Candle on a weekly scale which indicates that the major trend is positive while dips are being bought on an immediate basis.</p>
      <p>The index has been forming higher highs – higher lows on weekly scale and supports are gradually shifting higher. Now it has to continue to hold above 11,820 levels to witness an up move towards 11,950 then 12,000-12,103 zones while on the downside major support is seen at 11,780 then 11,700 zones.</p>

It formed a Bullish candle on daily and weekly scale which suggests Bulls are holding tight grip.

The index has positive set up but multiple hurdles are seen at 12k and lifetime high of 12,103 so better to go with Bull Call Spread to continue to be with positive momentum by paying fewer premiums.</p>
