      <p>HALIFAX -- Power crews in New Brunswick gradually made headway Saturday as they worked to restore electricity to thousands of customers after high winds blew down power lines.</p>
      <p>Downed trees on lines saw about 52,000 customers affected at the peak of the outage during Friday's storm.</p>
      <p>Crown-owned NB Power dispatched 145 crews and, as of 6 p.m. Saturday, just over 4,000 customers were still without power.</p>
      <p>According to estimates on the utility's website, electricity was expected to be restored in most areas by late Saturday evening.</p>
      <p>Most outages were in the Kennebecasis Valley in the southern part of the province, along with Kings and Queens Counties.</p>
      <p>Power has been largely restored across Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island where outage numbers were much lower than in New Brunswick.</p>
