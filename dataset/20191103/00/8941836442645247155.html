      <h1>Buffalo Bills outrun Washington in 24-9 victory, move to 6-2</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T00:00:00+00:00">03 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">JOHN WAWROW</a></address>
      <p>ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) - Rookie Devin Singletary had 95 yards rushing, including a 2-yard touchdown, and the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/buffalo-bills/">Buffalo Bills</a> are off to their best start since 1993 following a 24-9 win over the Washington Redskins on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Josh Allen had a touchdown pass and scored on a 1-yard plunge for the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/buffalo-bills/">Bills</a>, who improved to 6-2 - a record built on victories over some of the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/national-football-league/">NFL</a>’s worst teams.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/buffalo-bills/">Bills</a>‘ wins have come against teams that entered this weekend with a combined record of 7-31. And their latest came against a team that’s already fired its coach and was down to its third quarterback, with rookie first-round pick Dwayne Haskins making his first career start. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/washington/">Washington</a> (1-8) matched its worst start since 1998.</p>
      <p>Singletary took advantage of his most playing time this season, appearing to displace Frank Gore as <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/buffalo/">Buffalo</a>’s featured running back.</p>
      <p>With three catches for 45 yards, Singletary had a team-leading 140 yards from scrimmage. Allen went 14 of 20 for 160 yards, including a 6-yard touchdown pass to Cole Beasley.</p>

      <p>With its two losses coming against AFC-leading New England and Philadelphia, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/buffalo/">Buffalo</a> is enjoying its best first half of the season since a 7-1 start in 1993.</p>
      <p>Haskins finished 15 of 22 for 144 yards passing and no turnovers while starting in place of Case Keenum, who is in the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/national-football-league/">NFL</a>’s concussion protocol. That’s an improvement for the player selected 15th out of Ohio State. Haskins entered the game having gone 12 of 22 for 140 yards and four interceptions.</p>
      <p>Where Haskins was no different than Keenum was overseeing an offense that settled for field goals over touchdowns.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/washington/">Washington</a>’s touchdown-less streak surpassed 13 quarters, dating to Keenum’s 33-yard TD to Terry McLaurin in a 17-16 win at Miami.</p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p>Dustin Hopkins accounted for all of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/washington/">Washington</a>’s scoring by hitting field goals from 29, 33 and 39 yards, with two drives stalling inside <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/buffalo/">Buffalo</a>’s 20.</p>
        <p>Adrian Peterson had 101 of his 108 yards rushing in the first half, topping 100 yards for the second time this season and 56th of his career.</p>
        <p>Up 17-9, the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/buffalo-bills/">Bills</a> finally put the game away in the final six minutes, starting with cornerback Tre’Davious White sacking Haskins for a 9-yard loss. That forced <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/washington/">Washington</a> to punt from its own 4.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/buffalo/">Buffalo</a>’s offense responded with an eight-play, 46-yard drive capped by Singletary’s touchdown with 2:21 remaining.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/buffalo/">Buffalo</a> led from the beginning after building a 17-3 lead on its first three possessions.</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/buffalo-bills/">Bills</a>‘ run defense was suspect in the first half, when Peterson had 101 yards on 10 carries.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/buffalo/">Buffalo</a> was coming off a 31-13 loss to Philadelphia in a game it allowed a season-worst 218 yards and three touchdowns rushing.</p>
        <p>STUFFED</p>
        <p>Gore was stopped for no gain on three consecutive snaps from <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/washington/">Washington</a>’s 1 before Allen scored on fourth down in the second quarter. Gore was stopped once again on fourth-and-1 at <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/washington/">Washington</a>’s 24 to end <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/buffalo/">Buffalo</a>’s first drive of the third quarter.</p>
        <p>It didn’t get much better for Gore in the fourth quarter, when he was dropped for a 3-yard loss on third-and-1 from <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/buffalo/">Buffalo</a>’s 31.</p>
        <p>ROSTER MOVES</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/washington/">Washington</a> announced before kicked it signed safety and special teams captain Deshazor Everett to a three-year contract extension. He’s in his fifth season with <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/washington/">Washington</a> after being promoted from the practice squad.</p>
        <p>Everett was inactive with an ankle injury, missing his fourth straight game.</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/buffalo-bills/">Bills</a> on Saturday shuffled their defensive line by promoting Vincent Taylor off their practice squad and cutting Kyle Peko.</p>
