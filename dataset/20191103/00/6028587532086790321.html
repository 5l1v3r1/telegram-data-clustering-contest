      <p><b>WELCOME TO THE LIVE BLOG</b>Thank you for joining me tonight for a special live blog at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas for the Canelo Alvarez vs. Sergey Kovalev fight. As always I'll do my best to be your eyes and ears for this WBO light heavyweight championship bout as Canelo will be attempting to win a world title in a fourth weight class when he challenges Kovalev.</p>
      <p>The Undercard is already underway live on <a href="https://prf.hn/click/camref:1011l87iS">DAZN</a>. While I won't be providing my unofficial scorecard for the undercard bouts, I will provide updates and round by round scoring for the main event.</p>
      <p>Follow me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/peterkahn">@peterkahn</a>. I'll be here all night happy to read your comments and answer any questions. I'd love to know who you're picking to win. Canelo or Kovalev?</p>
      <p>
        <b>PROGRAMMING NOTE:</b>
      </p>
      <p>DAZN has chosen to wait until the conclusion of the UFC 244 broadcast featuring Jorge Masvidal vs. Nate Diaz for the “BMF” belt. A DAZN executive informed me a short while ago that we can expect the ring walk for Canelo vs. Kovalev to take place between 12:20 a.m. to 12:50 a.m. ET.</p>
      <p>A lot of people are complaining about this, but I feel it was a smart move by DAZN and benefits the entire combat sports fanbase as there are many crossover fans that want to enjoy both main events this evening. Present company included!</p>
      <p>While you’re at it, this isn’t a bad time to <a href="https://prf.hn/click/camref:1011l87iS">sign up for DAZN</a> if you still don’t have a subscription.</p>
      <p>
        <b>CHA CHING!</b>
      </p>
      <p>Not bad for a night’s work.</p>

        <b>THE ODDS</b>
      </p>
      <p>Earlier in the week I published by <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterkahn/2019/10/31/how-to-cash-in-betting-canelo-alvarez-vs-sergey-kovalev-4-bets-where-oddsmakers-provide-value/#77cd8642287a">best bets</a> for this fight. Currently, according to the <a href="https://www.betonline.ag/sportsbook/boxing/bouts">boxing odds</a> at BetOnline Canelo is a -400 favorite to dethrone the current champion Kovalev who is a +330 underdog. This is the biggest line for Canelo since the fight was announced. While there isn’t value betting Canelo the moneyline, if you read my best bets, you’ll find many prop bets that provide sports bettors with the ability to cash in.</p>

        <b>KEYS TO VICTORY:</b>
      </p>
      <p>A couple of days ago I published my <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterkahn/2019/10/31/3-keys-to-victory-for-canelo-alvarez-to-beat-sergey-kovalev/#4dd3dab242d2">keys to victory for Canelo</a> and my <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterkahn/2019/10/31/3-keys-to-victory-for-sergey-kovalev-to-beat-canelo-alvarez/">keys to victory for Kovalev</a> for this fight. Who do you think is going to win and how? Let me know on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/peterkahn">@peterkahn</a>.</p>
      <p>I caught up with Kovalev’s hall of fame trainer James Buddy McGirt right before camp and asked him how Kovalev is going to be able to beat Canelo.</p>
      <p>While we’re waiting, let’s take a closer look at tonight’s main event matchup.</p>
      <p>
        <b>DON'T FORGET TO SCROLL DOWN FOR THE LATEST UPDATES</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>THE OFFICIALS FOR CANELO VS. KOVALEV</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Referee </b>Russell Mora </p>
      <p><b>Judges:</b> Julie Lederman, Dave Moretti, Don Trella</p>
      <p>We still have two more fights before the main event. According to DAZN, the ring walks won’t start until between 12:20 a.m. to 12:50 a.m. ET.</p>
      <p>DAZN broadcast in serious time kill mode right now...</p>

      </p>
      <p>
        <b>THE KRUSHER IS IN THE BUILDING!</b>
      </p>
      <p>Just one more fight to go before Canelo and Kovalev go head to head. Ryan Garcia up next. DAZN doing a lot of time killing right now. Ryan Garcia makes quick work of Romero Duno in the first round by knockout.</p>
      <p>We’re getting close though. Stick with me here and I’ll be providing my unofficial scorecard for Canelo vs. Kovalev. Follow me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/peterkahn">@peterkahn</a> and let me know your prediction.</p>
      <p>
        <b>MAIN EVENT UP NEXT!</b>
      </p>
      <p>The DAZN broadcast is at the mercy of the Jorge Masvidal vs. Nate Diaz fight as DAZN expressed they won’t start the Canelo vs. Kovalev fight until the UFC 244 main event it over.</p>
      <p>
        <b>DON'T FORGET TO SCROLL DOWN FOR THE LATEST</b>
      </p>
      <p>We’re just moments away. DAZN in serious time kill mode right until UFC 244 is over, but we’re getting close. Stick with me as I’ll be your eyes and ears from the main event.</p>
      <p>
        <b>CURRENT SITUATION</b>
      </p>
      <p>DAZN should win an Emmy this year in the time fill category... We’re going on 1:00 a.m. ET. Thank goodness for daylight saving time at 2:00 a.m. this morning.</p>
      <p>So now both Canelo and Kovalev are laying down in their dressing rooms watching UFC 244. Professionally speaking, this is too much time for these guys to be in the dressing room wrapped and gloved. They’re being treated like a swing bout.</p>
      <p>We’re just a few minutes away.</p>
      <p>National Anthems have begun. Ring walks to follow. To say I am underwhelmed at the moment is an understatement. Unacceptable to make fans wait until after 1:00 a.m. to watch this fight. I will probably limit my scorecard to who I felt won the round without too much commentary. This fight needs to get started.</p>
      <p>
        <b>ROUND ONE</b>
      </p>
      <p>Kovalev wins round one behind the jab and lack of activity by Canelo</p>
