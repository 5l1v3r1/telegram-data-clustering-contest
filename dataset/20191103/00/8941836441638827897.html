      <p>GERMANTOWN, Md. (AP) - A decision by a county executive in Maryland to ban a police station from displaying a “thin blue line” flag is drawing criticism from <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/larry-hogan/">Gov. Larry Hogan</a>.</p>
      <p>The wooden flag was a gift from a local resident in recognition of National First Responders Day. It was to be displayed in the 5th District Station.</p>
      <p>News outlets report that Democratic Montgomery County Executive Marc Elrich said the flag provides a symbol of “support” to some, but is a symbol of “dismissiveness” to others.</p>
      <p>The “thin blue line” flag has been labeled by some as a response to the Black Lives Matter movement.</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/larry-hogan/">Hogan</a>, a Republican, said in a series of tweets Sunday that he was “offended and disgusted” that Elrich had prohibited officers from displaying the flag.</p>
