      <p>MILWAUKEE (AP) - Prosecutors allege a <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/milwaukee/">Milwaukee</a> man painted his car after a hit-and-run crash that killed two young sisters.</p>
      <p>Nineteen-year-old Daetwan Robinson was charged Friday in the Oct. 24 crash that killed the girls and seriously injured their 10-year-old cousin.</p>
      <p>According to the complaint, surveillance video shows Robinson’s car fishtailing and on only two wheels just before the crash.</p>
      <p>Authorities say Robinson pulled around several other cars stopped at a red light and struck the children in the crosswalk. Six-year-old Lisa Gee died at the scene. Her 4-year-old sister, Amea Gee, later died at a hospital.</p>
      <p>Police arrested Robinson the next day at his home. Investigators found the car in the garage along with cans of black spray paint.</p>
