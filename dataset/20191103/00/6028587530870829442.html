      <p>Meditating can be very easy and quite hard.</p>
      <p>As Ellie Burrows, cofounder and CEO of MNDFL Meditation, explains, “You don't need much to build an at-home practice other than a comfortable place to sit like a chair or couch, your breath and access to quality meditation content.” But Mark Krassner, founder of Expectful meditation app, believes it can also be helpful to create a space for a great meditation practice.</p>
      <p>So how do you make a zen nook in your home? Try some of these products:</p>
