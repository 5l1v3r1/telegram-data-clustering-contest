      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T00:00:00+00:00">03 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">TIM REYNOLDS</a></address>
      <p>MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. (AP) - <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/miami/">Miami</a> coach Brian Flores got drenched with the orange contents of a Gatorade bucket when time expired. Kool and the Gang’s “Celebration” blared through the stadium’s speakers. Players leaped in the air on their way to a joyous locker room.</p>
      <p>The Dolphins are 1-7.</p>
      <p>And - for one day, anyway - they can be thrilled about that.</p>
      <p>Ryan Fitzpatrick threw three touchdown passes, two of them to rookie <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/preston-williams/">Preston Williams</a>, and the Dolphins got their first win of the season by beating former coach Adam Gase and the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-york-jets/">New York Jets</a> 26-18 on Sunday.</p>
      <p>“Hopefully, a lot more to come,” Dolphins owner Stephen Ross said in the locker room before presenting Flores with the game ball after his first victory.</p>
      <hr/>

      <p>Flores gave his team Monday off. In the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/national-football-league/">NFL</a>, they call that “Victory Monday.” For this team, it was a long time coming.</p>
      <p>“Any time you win, it feels good,” said Flores, the Dolphins’ first-year coach. “That’s why we put in all the work.”</p>
      <p>The Dolphins avoided what would have been the second 0-8 start in franchise history, joining 2007. The win leaves Cincinnati (0-8) as the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/national-football-league/">NFL</a>’s lone winless team this season, and for now the frontrunners to win the No. 1 pick in the 2020 <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/national-football-league/">NFL</a> draft.</p>
      <p>Fitzpatrick completed 24 of 36 passes for 288 yards, and led the Dolphins to their highest point total of the season. It was also <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/miami/">Miami</a>’s fourth straight win over the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-york-jets/">Jets</a> - the first three of those coming with Gase being the coach on the winning side.</p>

        <p>“I had a lot of pressure on me today because my two boys were here and when we win, I bring my boys into the locker room,” Fitzpatrick said. “So I was tired of the puppy-dog eyes when I was walking off the field for them not being able to come in the locker room. We were going to get them in the dang locker room today.”</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-york-jets/">Jets</a> went 11 plays on the first drive of the game for a touchdown and a 7-0 lead, and their highlights were few and far between the rest of the day.</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-york-jets/">Jets</a> (1-7) actually fell below <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/miami/">Miami</a> in the AFC East standings based on the head-to-head tiebreaker. It was the Dolphins’ first win since the “Miami Miracle” over New England last season - which was followed by three straight losses to end 2018, making this a 10-game losing streak in all.</p>
        <p>No miracle was required this time.</p>
        <p>New York’s fate was largely sealed with 6:29 left, when a shotgun snap sailed right of quarterback Sam Darnold and wound up bouncing out of the back of the end zone for a safety and a 26-15 <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/miami/">Miami</a> lead. The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-york-jets/">Jets</a> got a field goal with 15 seconds left to close within eight, but <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/miami/">Miami</a> recovered the ensuing onside kick and could finally start to celebrate.</p>
        <p>“We’re 1-7,” Gase said. “Everybody feels like crap. You don’t put in this much time and effort to come out here and lose.”</p>
        <p>Darnold was 27 of 39 for 260 yards and a touchdown to Jamison Crowder. Fitzpatrick’s TD throws to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/preston-williams/">Williams</a> went for 12 and 5 yards, and DeVante Parker caught a 17-yard scoring pass. All three came in the second quarter, as <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/miami/">Miami</a> turned the 7-0 deficit into a 21-7 lead.</p>
        <p>As would be expected between teams with a combined 1-13 record entering the day, there were moments of ineptitude - the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-york-jets/">Jets</a> had a 3rd-and-27 in the first half, a couple of plays before the Dolphins faced a 1st-and-18.</p>
        <p>But the last minute of the half, which wound up taking nearly 20 minutes in real time, was filled with wackiness.</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-york-jets/">Jets</a> appeared to cut <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/miami/">Miami</a>’s lead to 21-13 with a PAT pending when Darnold connected with Ryan Griffin for a 2-yard touchdown, one that was overturned after a long review because officials ruled that the tight end didn’t have full control of the ball when he skidded to a stop out of the back of the end zone.</p>
        <p>“Better ball would have been a for-sure touchdown,” Darnold said.</p>
        <p>Darnold was intercepted by <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/miami/">Miami</a>’s Jomal Wiltz on the next play, giving the Dolphins the ball on their own 1. Fitzpatrick appeared to bobble the first-down snap, the play - after another review - became a safety for the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-york-jets/">Jets</a>, and New York made it 21-12 at the half by turning the ensuing possession into a career-best 52-yard field goal by Sam Ficken.</p>
        <p>But the lead stayed <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/miami/">Miami</a>‘s, the rest of the way. A day off is their reward.</p>
        <p>“I don’t know what to do with it,” rookie defensive lineman Christian Wilkins said.</p>
        <p>INJURIES</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-york-jets/">Jets</a>: Ty Montgomery was shaken up in the first quarter as he ran into Dolphins punter Matt Haack. Defensive lineman Steve McLendon injured a shoulder during the second half, and safety Jamal Adams was being evaluated late for a possible head injury.</p>
        <p>Dolphins: <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/preston-williams/">Williams</a>, the Dolphins’ breakthrough rookie this season, got hurt twice - first his right wrist in the third quarter, and then a knee in the fourth quarter. He returned from the wrist injury quickly, but was taken off the sideline on a cart after the knee injury.</p>
        <p>BIG DAY</p>
        <p>Dolphins tight end Mike Gesicki was targeted six times and made six catches for 95 yards - both of those being career highs.</p>
        <p>HOME LEADS</p>
        <p>The Dolphins led for the final 36 minutes, 14 seconds. Entering Sunday, they had led for a total of 3 minutes, 46 seconds in their first four home games of 2019 combined.</p>
        <p>GROUNDED</p>
        <p>At 1-7, the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-york-jets/">Jets</a> have matched their second-worst start in franchise history. They were 0-8 in 1996 and have been 1-7 on five other occasions, most recently 2014.</p>
