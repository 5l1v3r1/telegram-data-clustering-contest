      <p>THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. (AP) - <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/colin-montgomerie/">Colin Montgomerie</a> won the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/invesco/">Invesco</a> QQQ Championship on Sunday with a par on the first hole of a playoff after fellow Hall of Famer <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/bernhard-langer/">Bernhard Langer</a> took four strokes to get out of a greenside bunker.</p>
      <p>With <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/bernhard-langer/">Langer</a> finally on the par-4 18th green in six shots, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/colin-montgomerie/">Montgomerie</a> two-putted for the victory, with the 56-year-old Scot tapping in from 2 feet to end the second of three events in the PGA Tour Champions’ <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/charles-schwab-corp/">Charles Schwab</a> Cup playoffs.</p>
      <p>“How often does that happen with <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/bernhard-langer/">Bernhard</a>?” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/colin-montgomerie/">Montgomerie</a> said. “I felt for him in that bunker there. It was on the upslope there. The downslope was awful. Look how deep that is. It’s big hole. Unfortunate for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/bernhard-langer/">Bernhard</a>.”</p>
      <p>Playing five groups ahead of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/bernhard-langer/">Langer</a>, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/colin-montgomerie/">Montgomerie</a> made a 40-foot birdie putt in regulation on 18 for a tournament-record 9-under 63.</p>
      <p>“The one at the last was a massive bonus,” said <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/colin-montgomerie/">Montgomerie</a>, five strokes back at the start of the day.</p>
      <hr/>
      <hr/>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/bernhard-langer/">Langer</a> parred the final four holes for a 67, leaving a 15-foot birdie try short on 18. They finished at 15-under 202.</p>
      <p>Both players found the narrow fairway in the playoff, with <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/bernhard-langer/">Langer</a> leaving himself 191 yards to the hole - about 35 more than he had in regulation. His approach caught the left greenside bunker, leaving an awkward stance with the back lip of the bunker hindering his swing.</p>
      <p>“It was a downhill lie with a big lip in front,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/bernhard-langer/">Langer</a> said. “It’s hell down there. You just can’t go down there. That bunker’s built very poorly. …. Just faded to the right. I was overaggressive. I was trying to make birdie and just pushed it about 5 yards.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/colin-montgomerie/">Montgomerie</a> then hit his 174-yard approach to the middle of the green, leaving about 20 feet.</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/colin-montgomerie/">Montgomerie</a> won for the seventh time on the 50-and-over tour.</p>
        <p>The 62-year-old <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/bernhard-langer/">Langer</a> has 40 senior victories, winning a playoff at Sherwood in 2017.</p>
        <p>“It’s been a good week, played some good golf, played good at Richmond, played good here, so that’s encouraging,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/bernhard-langer/">Langer</a> said. “Finished fourth and second last two tournaments, so looking forward to next week. That’s all you can do. Playoff, I made one bad shot and paid the price. That was the worst place you could hit it. Anywhere left I have a shot down there.”</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/colin-montgomerie/">Montgomerie</a> birdied four of the first five holes, chipped in for birdie on No. 10 and eagle on No. 11 and also birdied the 16th.</p>
        <p>“Eleven was key,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/colin-montgomerie/">Montgomerie</a> said. “Ten, when I chipped in at 10 was a very good chip, but kept me going. Eleven, hang on, I’m suddenly leading. From third, fourth, suddenly boom, I’m leading now. So, there’s a whole different feeling.”</p>
        <p>Retief Goosen and Tommy Tolles were a stroke back.</p>
        <p>Goosen, the second-round leader, shot a 69. He missed a 12-foot birdie try on 18.</p>
        <p>“I didn’t play that well today,” Goosen said. “Putter was a bit cold, made a few bad mistakes.”</p>
        <p>Tolles closed with a 66.</p>
        <p>The top 36 in the season standings advanced to the season-ending <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/charles-schwab-corp/">Charles Schwab</a> Cup Championship next week in Phoenix. Points leader Scott McCarron closed with a 77 to tie for 43rd at even par. Second-place Jerry Kelly shot 66 to tie for 10th at 8 under.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/colin-montgomerie/">Montgomerie</a> jumped from 12th to fourth, and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/bernhard-langer/">Langer</a> from fourth to third.</p>
        <p>Miguel Angel Jiménez, the winner two weeks ago in the playoff opener in Virginia, closed with a 69 to tie for fifth at 11 under with Billy Andrade (64) and Ken Tanigawa (65).</p>
        <p>Fred Couples, a stroke behind Goosen entering the round, had a 72 to tie for eighth at 9 under. The 60-year-old Couples won the last of his 13 Champions titles in 2017.</p>
