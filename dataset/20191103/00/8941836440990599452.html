      <p>SHENZHEN, China (AP) - <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ashleigh-barty/">Ashleigh Barty</a> added to a career year by winning her first WTA Finals title in her first appearance at the season-ending event with a 6-4, 6-3 victory over defending champion <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/elina-svitolina/">Elina Svitolina</a> of Ukraine on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The title adds to the 23-year-old Australian’s lengthy list of achievements in 2019 including her first Grand Slam title at the French Open. She also rose to the No. 1 ranking in the game and is now enjoying her 15th week in the top spot, becoming the first Australian to hold the year-end top spot.</p>
      <p>“It feels like it’s been a year that just hasn’t stopped,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ashleigh-barty/">Barty</a> said. “It’s been a year of incredible ups and downs, I think more ups than downs. To cap it off with a very, very special night tonight in Shenzhen is really cool.</p>
      <p>“To come through a week like this, you have to beat the best of the best.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ashleigh-barty/">Barty</a>, who came through the round-robin standings with a 2-1 record this week, was unable to find a breakthrough against <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/elina-svitolina/">Svitolina</a> until the 10th game when she created three break point opportunities, finally taking advantage of the third with a forehand return winner to score the opening set.</p>

      <p>There were five service breaks in the first eight games of the second set, leaving <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ashleigh-barty/">Barty</a> leading 5-3 and serving for the match.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/elina-svitolina/">Svitolina</a> smacked a backhand crosscourt way wide on a second break point in that eighth game to seal her fate with <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ashleigh-barty/">Barty</a> then serving out the match at love for her first career victory over the Ukrainian player in six matches.</p>
      <p>“I think she was playing great match today,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/elina-svitolina/">Svitolina</a> said. “She was on it 100 percent. Then it was very, very tough.</p>
      <p>“I missed just little bit of my chances and that’s what made the difference. But she’s No. 1 in the world for a reason, so.”</p>

        <p>The season isn’t over for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ashleigh-barty/">Barty</a> yet as she heads to Perth to lead the Australian Fed Cup team in the final against France next weekend.</p>
        <p>“There’s one more very important week to cap off what would be the most perfect year,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ashleigh-barty/">Barty</a> said. “This Fed Cup final is something I’ve been looking forward to for a long time.</p>
        <p>“Playing for your country, for myself to play in front of my friends and family, representing Australia, wearing the green and gold. There’s absolutely nothing better.”</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ashleigh-barty/">Barty</a> takes home a record $4.42 million paycheck for the WTA Finals title, the richest winner’s prize ever in the sport.</p>
