      <p>CHESTERFIELD, Va. (AP) - An 11-year-old boy from Virginia has been chosen to compete on the Food Network show “Chopped Junior.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jake-nelson/">Jake Nelson</a>, of Chesterfield, will appear on the season premiere on Nov. 12.</p>
      <p>The sixth-grader at Robious Middle School has been cooking for years. Mid-Atlantic dishes are his specialty, combining local ingredients like fresh seafood with chicken, turkey or pork loin.</p>
      <p>During his audition for “Chopped Junior,” he prepared soft shell crabs.</p>
      <p>In July, his family traveled to New York to tape the show. He can’t reveal what happened until the episode airs, but told the Richmond Times-Dispatch it was an “amazing” experience.</p>
