      <p><b>CNBLUE</b>'s <b><a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/yonghwa">Yonghwa</a></b> is now discharged from the army.</p>
      <p>He was discharged from his army branch, where he greeted both fans and press. When asked which girl group gave him a lot of strength, he first said he got to know a lot of singers, but when asked to pick one, he chose <b>TWICE</b>.</p>
      <p>Hopefully he'll come back to active promotions soon!</p>
