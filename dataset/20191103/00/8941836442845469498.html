      <p>WILSON, N.C. (AP) - Police say a North Carolina man has been arrested for impersonating a law enforcement officer after he stopped a police chase.</p>
      <p>News outlets report that the incident happened on Oct. 5 after Wilson police stopped a car at a grocery store in search of a possible murder suspect. As they approached the car, it sped off.</p>
      <p>Police had chased the car for about two miles when a black Ford Taurus with blue lights sped past the officers.</p>
      <p>Police said the driver of the Taurus, 30-year-old David Adams Jr., forced five men out of the suspect car at gunpoint. Adams was later arrested for impersonating an officer.</p>
