      <p>BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) - Louisiana’s health department is holding one-day flu vaccination clinics around the state where people can get free flu shots.</p>
      <p>The free flu shot events began in October and are continuing this month. A full list of locations, dates and times is available online. Events are open to the public, without appointments needed.</p>
      <p>Those who don’t have private insurance, Medicare or Medicaid to cover the cost of the flu shot won’t have to pay for the vaccination.</p>
      <p>The Department of Health says more than 1,400 people in Louisiana died last year from the flu and more than 14,000 people were hospitalized.</p>
