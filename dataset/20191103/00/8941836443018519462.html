      <p>MISSOULA, Mont. (AP) - The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/environmental-protection-agency/">Environmental Protection Agency</a> has released the first of two plans intended to transfer oversight of Superfund units to Montana.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/montana-public-radio/">Montana Public Radio</a> reported the Institutional Control Implementation and Assurance Plan outlines how the state should mitigate the spread of remaining contamination in Libby and Troy.</p>
      <p>The areas account for two of eight units in the Libby Asbestos Superfund Site.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/environmental-protection-agency/">EPA</a> has removed asbestos and vermiculite from more than 2,600 private and industrial properties in Libby and Troy since 1999.</p>
      <p>The plan aimed at preventing further contamination spread precedes the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/environmental-protection-agency/">EPA</a> giving site control to the Montana Department of Environmental Quality.</p>
