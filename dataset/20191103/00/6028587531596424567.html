      <p>Plenty of big names will be available in free agency this off-season, with Gerrit Cole and Anthony Rendon heading up the list.The next tier of free agents is nearly as impressive, though, and quite deep: Madison Bumgarner, Josh Donaldson, Didi Gregorius, Yasmani Grandal, Marcell Ozuna and Zack Wheeler. Stephen Strasburg adds to the star power now that he has reportedly opted out of his contract, and J.D. Martinez may join him.</p>
      <p>The last couple of off-seasons have had slow free agency markets, but perhaps this class is just the thing to stoke the bidding. Here, Forbes.com’s SportsMoney contributors highlight the players each team will be keeping an eye on this winter.</p>

      </h3>
      <p><b>Top Target:</b> Needing a catcher who can hit, the Braves will bid for Yasmani Grandal, with World Series hero Robinson Chirinos a cheaper option. Failing there, Atlanta might trade for Buster Posey—especially if batterymate Madison Bumgarner also arrives from San Francisco. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/danschlossberg/2019/10/31/atlanta-braves-mlb-free-agency-john-donaldson/"><i>Read more on the Braves’ off-season outlook from Forbes contributor Dan Schlossberg</i></a><i>.</i></p>

      <p><b>Top Target:</b> The Marlins can’t afford to be choosy; they’ll take anyone affordable who can bolster the offense or the bullpen until their minor leaguers are ready. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/waynemcdonnell/2019/10/31/miami-marlins-mlb-free-agency-starlin-castro/"><i>Read more on the Marlins’ off-season outlook from Forbes contributor Wayne G.

      </h3>
      <p><b>Top Target:</b> If the Mets don’t re-sign Zack Wheeler, they could jump in the market for Gerrit Cole, who would make for a formidable duo with Jacob deGrom. More realistically, however, the Mets could look at Jake Odorizzi. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jerrybeach/2019/10/31/new-york-mets-mlb-free-agency-zack-wheeler/"><i>Read more on the Mets’ off-season outlook from Forbes contributor Jerry Beach</i></a><i>.</i></p>

      <p><b>Top Target:</b> The Phillies will aim higher, but the realistic target is Mike Moustakas, who can play third base until prospect Alec Bohm is ready and then move to second, where he played for much of 2019. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tonyblengino/2019/10/31/philadelphia-phillies-mlb-free-agency-joe-girardi/"><i>Read more on the Phillies’ off-season outlook from Forbes contributor Tony Blengino</i></a><i>.</i></p>

      <p><b>Top Target:</b> The Nationals, despite their World Series victory, really need help in the bullpen and could turn to Will Smith, who had a 2.76 ERA with 34 saves for the Giants. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/arikaplan/2019/10/31/washington-nationals-mlb-free-agency-anthony-rendon/"><i>Read more on the Nationals’ off-season outlook from Forbes contributor Ari Kaplan</i></a><i>.</i></p>

      </h3>
      <p><b>Top Target:</b> Re-signing Nicholas Castellanos seems imperative given how well he fit at Wrigley Field after being added at the trade deadline. But bringing him back could mean that other core players must be moved for prospect-heavy packages. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/philrogers/2019/10/31/chicago-cubs-mlb-free-agency-kris-bryant-javier-baez/"><i>Read more on the Cubs’ off-season outlook from Forbes contributor Phil Rogers</i></a><i>.</i></p>

      <p><b>Top Target:</b> The Reds need a shortstop, and despite a sub-par season with the Yankees, Didi Gregorius seemingly still has a lot left in the tank. He would be reuniting with the organization that signed him as an amateur free agent from Curaçao. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnperrotto/2019/10/31/cincinnati-reds-mlb-free-agency-didi-gregorius/"><i>Read more on the Reds’ off-season outlook from Forbes contributor John Perrotto</i></a><i>.</i></p>

      <p><b>Top Target:</b> Mike Moustakas has been a perfect fit since coming over in a somewhat surprising deadline deal in 2018. He’s spent two consecutive winters waiting for a multi-year deal that never developed; perhaps he’ll finally work out a deal to stay in Milwaukee long term. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewwagner/2019/10/31/milwaukee-brewers-mlb-free-agency-mike-moustakas/"><i>Read more on the Brewers’ off-season outlook from Forbes contributor Andrew Wagner</i></a><i>.</i></p>

      <p><b>Top Target:</b> Kyle Gibson is 32 and on the downside of his career, but he could be a solid innings eater for the rotation.

      </h3>
      <p><b>Top Target:</b> The Cardinals have coveted Josh Donaldson for years, but he’ll be 34 years old next season. Mike Moustakas would bring a left-handed bat, 30-plus-home-run power and quality defense at third base. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ryandavis/2019/10/31/st-louis-cardinals-mlb-free-agency-marcell-ozuna/"><i>Read more on the Cardinals’ off-season outlook from Forbes contributor Ryan Davis</i></a><i>.</i></p>

      <p><b>Top Target:</b> The Rockies could use a right-handed-hitting slugger in the outfield, so Marcell Ozuna could be a fit despite a second half derailed by injuries. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jacketkin/2019/10/31/colorado-rockies-mlb-free-agency-trevor-story/"><i>Read more on the Rockies’ off-season outlook from Forbes contributor Jack Etkin</i></a><i>.</i></p>

      <p><b>Top Target:</b> The Padres will have plenty of competition, but Stephen Strasburg is a San Diego native and a San Diego State alum.

      <p><b>Top Target:</b> Affordable starting pitching is always a target, and the young staff did not markedly improve in 2019.

      <p><b>Top Target:</b> The Athletics would like to balance their outfield with a left-handed hitter, and even though he hit just .230 in 2019, the speedy Jarrod Dyson could be a good fit; he stole 30 bases for the Diamondbacks. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnperrotto/2019/10/31/oakland-athletics-mlb-free-agency-blake-treinen/"><i>Read more on the Athletics’ off-season outlook from Forbes contributor John Perrotto</i></a><i>.</i></p>
