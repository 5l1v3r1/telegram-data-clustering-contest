      <p>Shah Rukh Khan turned 54 on Nov. 2, and naturally, the Bollywood star’s social media was flooded with well-wishes from friends and fans. However, one of the most touching came from the world’s tallest building. In celebration of the actor’s birthday on Saturday night, the Burj Khalifa lit up with a special tribute to Khan. The spectacular projection included a thoughtful message that read “Happy birthday to the King of Bollywood” as hundreds gathered for the Dubai Fountain show. The sweet gesture was not lost on the “Om Shanti Om” actor, who took to his Twitter to thank Mohamed Alabbar, founder of Emaar Properties, and the iconic landmark. “Your love and kindness is unsurpassable. Wow! This is really the tallest I have ever been. Love you Dubai,” he wrote alongside a clip of the light show. </p>
