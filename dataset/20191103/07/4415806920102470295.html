      <p>Real Madrid head coach Zinedine Zidane admitted an opportunity had been missed to move clear at the top of LaLiga – but remained positive after a frustrating goalless draw against Real Betis at the Bernabeu.</p>
      <p>Barcelona’s surprise defeat at Levante earlier on Saturday had given Los Blancos the chance to leapfrog their rivals.</p>
      <p>However, after Eden Hazard’s early effort had been ruled out for offside, the home side were unable to make the most of their superior possession as Betis battled to a hard-earned point.</p>

      <p>Madrid are level on 22 points with Barca, but remain second, a point in front of Sevilla and Atletico Madrid, who drew 1-1.</p>
      <p>“We lost two points, it was an opportunity to add more, but I stay with the positive,” Zidane said.</p>
      <p>“There is also a rival and they have also put us in difficulties, which is normal.”</p>
      <p>The Real Madrid head coach told a press conference: “It is true that we have all lost points, but this is the best League in the world and there is is no easy game, it does not exist.</p>
      <p>“Every team can get you into difficulties and that is why it is the best league in the world. It is not easy.”</p>

      <p>Real Madrid had swept past Leganes on Wednesday night, but Zidane stressed: “We are not going to always score five goals.</p>
      <p>“We know that when we create chances, that is the most important thing.</p>
      <p>“Our rhythm, intensity and overall game were all perfect, we just have to put the ball in the net.”</p>
      <p>Zidane added: “We will continue and it will be a very difficult league until the end and that is what that there is.</p>
      <p>“All teams have lost points, but as I said there are no rivals against which you win easily and you have to accept it.</p>
      <p>“We must do more to earn more victories, but we are not doing so badly.”</p>

      <p>Zidane, though, felt his side should have been awarded a penalty during the second half.</p>
      <p>A low cross looked to have hit Zouhair Feddal on the hand as he made a sliding challenge – but the appeals were turned down following a VAR review.</p>
      <p>“I saw a hand, but it is the interpretation of the referee, but we must not look much to that,” Zidane said.</p>
      <p>“It is not going to change anything, we know what happened, because I saw the hand and you also have to respect what the referee says.</p>
      <p>“We have had a good attitude, we have made a good game, but we missed the goal so we have to keep going.”</p>

      <p>For Real Betis, it was an unexpected bonus point which edges them away from the bottom three.</p>
      <p>Head coach Rubi said at a press conference: “The feeling I have is sensational.</p>
      <p>“I think the players have made an enormous effort of concentration, tactical work and intensity.</p>
      <p>“We drew the match and also had some chances to score a goal, so we leave very happy and very satisfied.”</p>
