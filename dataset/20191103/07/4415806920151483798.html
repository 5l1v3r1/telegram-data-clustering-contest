      <p>Irish passengers have criticised Ryanair after the airline cancelled flights from Krakow to Dublin and Shannon due to fog.</p>
      <p>The delays began at 3pm on Friday. Flights to Dublin and Shannon were among 15 cancelled because of fog at Krakow Airport.</p>
      <p>Ryanair says it offered passengers refunds or a switch to the next available flight, but some passengers say they were told the next availability would be as late as next Thursday.</p>
      <p>Such passengers then had to choose whether to pay for an earlier flight home, or accommodation until their rescheduled flight.</p>
      <p>Dublin-based teacher Róisín Ní Dhonnabhain said the flight cancellation has cost her a significant amount of money.</p>
      <p>"We paid over €1,000 out of our own pockerts for flights alone, and then about €200 on the hotel for two nights," she said.</p>
      <p>"It's a huge amount of money - nearly a half a month's wages - trying to get home."</p>
      <p>Ryanair said: "Affected customers were notified by email and SMS text message and advised of their options of a refund or free move to the next available flight. Ryanair sincerely apologised for this weather cancellation which was entirely beyond our control."</p>
