      <h1>'Rampant' - how the Birmingham City players rated in controversial Cardiff City defeat</h1>
      <h2>Cardiff City 4-2 Birmingham City ratings | Kristian Pedersen and Ivan Sunjic scored and Harlee Dean was sent off on a stormy afternoon for the Blues in the Championship</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T07:46:00+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 07:46</time> by <a rel="author">Brian Dick, https://www.facebook.com/blueswriterbriandick/?fref=ts</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/birmingham-city-fc">Birmingham City</a> paid for their wastefulness as they lost to a Joe Ralls hat-trick and a deeply controversial refereeing performance from Andrew Madley.</p>
      <p>Kristian  Pedersen and <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/ivan-sunjic">Ivan Sunjic</a> scored on a stormy afternoon - but Ralls hit three, including two penalties, and Curtis Nelson one.</p>
      <p>Here’s how Pep Clotet’s players rated. <br/><br/><b>STARTING FORMATION <br/>4-4-2 <br/>CAMP 5 </b><br/>Went the wrong way on the penalty, pushed Flint’s point-blank header back into traffic for the second, tipped over from Hoilett shortly after. Easily beaten for Ralls’ second and his third, from the spot. <br/><b>COLIN 7</b> <br/>Absolutely rampant in the opening half hour as he and Crowley terrorised Joe Bennett. Tried to inspire something as Blues ended up chasing the game too. Not his day. <br/><b>DEAN 5.5</b> <br/>Looked on the stretch a couple of times in the first half, playing on a greasy surface. Coped well enough though. Beaten by Nelson for a disallowed goal, which looked a marginal call. <br/>Sent off late on having tried to engineer something going forward too. His blood must have been boiling.</p>
      <p><b>ROBERTS 6</b> <br/>Like all the defenders there were times when he looked a little unsteady on a difficult playing surface - but did reasonably well. <br/>One rash foray forward and mis-placed pass nearly left Blues horribly-exposed early in the second half.</p>

      <p><b>PEDERSEN 6.5</b> <br/>Second goal  in as many games - and third of the season. Looked very inventive going forward and kept things nailed down at the back in the opening period. <br/>Had a penalty shout in the second half and seemed to be struggling with his footing as the rain fell - and Mendez-Laing scooted round him for the third. <br/><b>CROWLEY 7</b> <br/>Unplayable in the opening exchanges, pulling the strings like a master puppeteer. Should have scored from Colin’s pull-back, though. <br/>Tried so hard in the second half to invent something but couldn’t find the right delivery.</p>

      <p><b>SUNJIC 7.5</b> <br/>Picked up a booking for a cynical pull back but flew around midfield trying to drag  his team back  into proceedings. <br/>Vital last-man tackle as the game broke up and Mendez-Laing threatened to go clear and a clinical finish for his second of the season.</p>
      <p><b>BELLINGHAM 6</b> <br/>Started in the engineroom for the fifth game in succession and this was a hot game that will prove a valuable learning experience. <br/>Sometimes caught in possession,  other times he linked play together well. Rightly subbed with a quarter of an hour to go.</p>

      <p><b>VILLALBA 6.5</b> <br/>Beautiful cross for the Pedersen goal and for half an hour linked up with Mrabti and Crowley in mesmerising fashion. <br/>Subsequent dead ball delivery not as high standard and started snatching at shots as Blues needed something. Worked his tiny socks off though. <br/><b>MRABTI 7</b> <br/>His best game of the season, the Swede linked up well with the ‘false wingers’ in a mesmeric first half. <br/>Should have ended with an assist for setting up Crowley and arguably a goal for a super turn just after the hour. Subbed in the 65th minute. <br/><b>JUTKIEWICZ 5.5</b> <br/>Involved in yet another running battle with a Championship defence. Clearly frustrated at the way the game was refereed. Forced one good save from Etheridge but Blues just couldn’t find him often enough.</p>
