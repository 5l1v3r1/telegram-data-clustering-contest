        <i>Jeff Mermelstein captures an off-kilter encounter at a New York amusement park</i>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.icp.org/browse/archive/constituents/jeff-mermelstein?all/all/all/all/0">Jeff Mermelstein</a>’s fascination with street photography dates back to 1978, when he moved from New Jersey to New York and became interested in the work of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2015/oct/14/lee-friedlander-human-clay-intimate-portraits-in-pictures">Lee Friedlander</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2016/jul/12/diane-arbus-rare-unpublished-photos-met-breuer-in-pictures">Diane Arbus</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2014/oct/15/garry-winogrands-classic-street-photography-flying-men-monkey-babies">Garry Winogrand</a>, by whom he was briefly taught. Now based in Brooklyn, his images have appeared in publications such as <i>L</i><i>ife</i>, the<i> New Yorker</i> and the<i> New York Times</i> magazine. Since 2015, he has been capturing his surroundings with various models of iPhone – “not necessarily the newest one” – and posting them on Instagram.</p>
      <p>“I have used Leicas and Canon SLR cameras for many decades,” he says. “The transition from more conventional, very, very good cameras to smartphone cameras is a departure. It affects how you take pictures, how the camera is held, how you edit work, the immediacy of it. It’s a tool that has enabled me to think differently and, at times, make a picture I didn’t anticipate.”</p>
      <p>This photograph, of a goldfish won as a prize at the amusement park on Coney Island, captures a busy summer evening in 2016. Along with 304 other images, it makes up <a href="https://morelbooks.com/products/jeff-mermelstein"><i>Hardened</i></a>, a new book edited by writer <a href="https://davidcampany.com/">David Campany</a> collecting Mermelstein’s smartphone photography: grainy, slightly off-kilter images of strange encounters with the city’s inhabitants.</p>
      <p>In the four decades he has been in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york">New York</a>, Mermelstein has returned time and time again to Coney Island to take photos. “I like the quite extraordinary mixture of types of people: appearance-wise, clothing-wise or lack of clothing-wise. It’s just a hodgepodge of characters, from the conventional to the bizarre.”</p>
