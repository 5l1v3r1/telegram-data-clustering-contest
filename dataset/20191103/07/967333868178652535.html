      <p>The JetBlue employee posted a photo showing her dressed as a homeless person wearing tattered and soiled clothing, with a homemade cardboard sign around her neck that read “Homeless. Need help trying to get back home to Puerto Rico or Cuba.”</p>
      <blockquote>“This was the costume of a JetBlue employee at the airport in Fort Lauderdale, FL,” Twitter user @nats2548 captioned a shot of the worker standing in the JetBlue terminal in the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport. “I want to read your opinions.”</blockquote>

      <p>Netizens were enraged with such an act, and demanded that JetBlue fire the employee – or issue a public apology.</p>

      <p>Several people said the costume was tone-deaf to survivors of Hurricane Maria, the worst natural disaster in Puerto Rican history which left over 3,000 people dead and thousands more homeless.</p>

      <p>JetBlue, the largest airline carrier in Puerto Rico, apologized in a statement to the network and said “the situation was immediately addressed.”</p>
      <p>“In the spirit of Halloween, our crew members are welcome to celebrate in costume, but one crewmember chose a costume that was clearly insensitive and not in line with our costume policy,” said Derek Dombrowski, manager of corporate communications at JetBlue.</p>
