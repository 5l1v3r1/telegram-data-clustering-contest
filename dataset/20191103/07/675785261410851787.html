      <h1>Woman plotted husband's death over Snapchat assuming evidence would be deleted</h1>
      <h2>When Kemia Hassel decided that she wanted to be with another man Jeremy Cuellar - and not her US Army Sgthusband Tyrone - walking away from her marriage wasn’t an option</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T07:00:00+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 07:00</time> by <a rel="author">Gail Shortland</a></address>
      <p>They’d pledged their loyalty and devotion to the US Army, and to each other as man and wife.</p>
      <p>Kemia and Tyrone Hassel were both soldiers and so understood what it took to put others first.</p>
      <p>When they became parents to their two-year-old son, they vowed to protect him, too.</p>
      <p>US Army Sgt Tyrone Hassel III had been destined for the military.</p>
      <p>He was high-achieving, athletic and had a strong sense of right and wrong.</p>
      <p>Tyrone, 23, had joined the Army in 2015 and showed such promise that he was quickly promoted.</p>
      <p>His job and family meant everything to him.</p>
      <p>Tyrone was married to Kemia, an Army Specialist and mother to their son.</p>

      <h3>Planning for murder</h3>
      <p>In 2017, Tyrone and Kemia, 22, were posted to South Korea.</p>
      <p>While Tyrone worked hard for his country and was planning his family’s future, Kemia was making different plans.</p>
      <p>She was coming up with a strategy that would get her exactly what she wanted.</p>
      <p>Kemia was having an affair with another soldier, Jeremy Cuellar, 24, also based in South Korea.</p>
      <p>They were sneaking around behind Tyrone’s back and plotting to be together.</p>
      <p>But instead of just telling Tyrone, Kemia didn’t want to walk away from everything he had to offer.</p>
      <p>They would need money for their new life.</p>
      <p>Tyrone had an Army life insurance policy that totalled more than $400,000 that she wouldn’t be entitled to if they separated.</p>
      <p>But what if Tyrone died before then?</p>
      <p>Kemia and Jeremy were conspiring to kill Tyrone.</p>
      <p>In order to avoid being traced, they started to communicate through Snapchat, because they wrongly believed the app’s temporary messages would be undetectable by police.</p>
      <p>For months they sent messages to each other about how they were going to murder unsuspecting Tyrone.</p>
      <p>When they were posted back to the US, they were all stationed at Fort Stewart in Georgia, and the mission stepped up a gear.</p>
      <p>Kemia would make sure Tyrone was in the right place at the right time – and Jeremy would pull the trigger.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>It was New Year’s Eve 2018, and Kemia and Tyrone were staying with Tyrone’s dad in St Joseph Township, Michigan.</p>
      <p>They were on military leave for the festive season.</p>
      <p>In the evening, Tyrone went to a family party, leaving Kemia at his dad’s house.</p>
      <p>Before 11pm, he messaged Kemia to say he was coming back with a plate of food for her.</p>
      <p>Kemia then messaged Jeremy and told him there was an opportunity for an ambush.</p>
      <p>Tyrone left the party before the New Year rang in, and had almost reached the house when Jeremy shot him in the head and neck before disappearing.</p>
      <p>Paramedics rushed to the scene, but Tyrone was pronounced dead at hospital.</p>
      <p>Kemia played the grieving widow – she even allowed Tyrone’s family to comfort her.</p>
      <p>But once investigators found out about her affair, they started to look closer.</p>
      <p>It was discovered Kemia had made a number of internet searches after the killing.</p>
      <p>One was ‘how to delete Snapchat’.</p>
      <p>Another was ‘active duty soldier killed on New Year’s Eve’.</p>
      <p>Kemia also looked up ‘what do I do after my house is paid off’.</p>
      <p>Jeremy’s mobile placed him in the area.</p>
      <p>He had no reason to be in Michigan.</p>
      <h3>Caught out in a lie</h3>
      <p>Kemia was brought in for questioning and after a long time denying any involvement in her husband’s murder, she confessed.</p>
      <p>She talked calmly about how she’d been unhappy in her marriage, but didn’t want to divorce him because she wouldn’t be eligible for his life insurance policy.</p>
      <p>She said she wanted to be with Jeremy and Tyrone stood in the way.</p>
      <p>Jeremy was arrested and held on a $2.5 million bail.</p>
      <p>His lawyer said it would be hard to pin the shooting on him with no witnesses.</p>
      <p>And by the time the case came to trial, Kemia said she’d been coerced into confessing.</p>
      <p>At the trial this year, Kemia’s defence continued to insist she’d been interrogated for so long she’d ‘broken down’ and been ‘manipulated’ into confessing.</p>
      <p>They said Jeremy was the one responsible and had driven the killing.</p>

      <p>‘She had an affair with Jeremy Cuellar,’ her lawyer said.</p>
      <p>‘That does not prove that she was part of a plot to murder her husband.'</p>
      <p>'Does it make her a bad wife?'</p>
      <p>'Sure.'</p>
      <p>'Does it make her a person who lacks honour?'</p>
      <p>'Sure.'</p>
      <p>'But that doesn’t prove a plot – that doesn’t prove intent.’</p>
      <p>He said Kemia knew what Jeremy wanted to do, but didn’t believe he’d go through with it.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately for Kemia, she had been recorded speaking to her mum from prison, saying she wasn’t forced to confess – she’d planned it.</p>
      <p>The prosecution said Kemia was the ‘mastermind’.</p>
      <p>That she’d given Jeremy constant updates to make sure he knew where Tyrone was so he could pull that trigger.</p>
      <p>‘Kemia Hassel wasn’t happy with her life or with her husband,’ they said.</p>
      <p>‘She devised a plan with her lover, Jeremy Cuellar, to have him murdered.'</p>
      <p>'And in the end, you’ll see from the evidence it was all about her and what she wanted.’</p>
      <p>The prosecution showed the videos of Kemia confessing to helping her lover find her husband.</p>
      <p>She even shamelessly stayed with Tyrone’s father for two weeks after the murder.</p>
      <p>Kemia did not take the stand.</p>
      <h3>The ultimate betrayal</h3>
      <p>After the three-day trial, the jury deliberated for just over an hour and found Kemia guilty of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder.</p>
      <p>Afterwards, Tyrone’s dad, also called Tyrone, said listening to recordings of Kemia’s confession were ‘difficult’ because he didn’t hear any sympathy in her voice.</p>
      <p>‘She’s the devil,’ he said.</p>
      <p>He called his son a hero.</p>
      <p>‘You want your kid to be better than you, and he accomplished that,’ he said.</p>
      <p>In August this year, Kemia was sentenced to life in prison without the chance of parole.</p>
      <p>She was given the opportunity to say something to her husband’s family, but chose not to.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Tyrone’s mum, Lashanda Jones, said she wanted Kemia to spend the rest of her days thinking about what she’d done.</p>
      <p>‘How could you take the life of a man that gave you his last name?’ she asked her former daughter-in-law.</p>
      <p>‘A last name that you didn’t deserve to have.'</p>
      <p>'I hope every time you close your eyes, my son taps you on your shoulder and smiles.'</p>
      <p>'Just to remind you that his life is not over, because he is still living in God, and you will be livingin hell until the day you die.’</p>
      <p>Tyrone’s father called the killing the ‘ultimate betrayal’, and promised his grandson will know what an amazing father he had.</p>
      <p>The judge was just as damning about Kemia’s future.</p>
      <p>‘Ms Hassel, the road to redemption is long and arduous and you will spend the rest of your life walking it,’ she said.</p>
      <p>In July this year, Jeremy pleaded guilty to second-degree murder, as part of a deal to avoid a first-degree murder charge.</p>
      <p>In exchange, he received a minimum of 65 years in prison.</p>
      <p>The judge told him, ‘You chose money over another human being.’</p>
      <p>‘I want to apologise to the family.'</p>
      <p>'I was a fool for just taking her words and not really looking to see who he was,’ Jeremy told the court.</p>
      <p>‘I also want to apologise to the Army.'</p>
      <p>'It was the best thing that happened to me.'</p>
      <p>'It was stupid, and that’s not me at all.'</p>
      <p>'I was raised right, I just had issues within, my own demons, I know we all do.'</p>
      <p>'But what she was telling me, I opened up to her and she played on it.'</p>
      <p>'I shouldn’t have opened up to her.'</p>
      <p>'I was a fool for trusting her.’</p>
      <p>Kemia and Jeremy thought they’d found something special in each other, but they were both willing to settle down with a partner they knew would kill to get what they wanted.</p>
