      <p>A human chain in the upmarket Hong Kong island mall of Cityplaza, in Taikoo Shing, turned into a bloody face-to-face conflict with police.</p>
      <p>Police said protesters had vandalised a restaurant after a peaceful chanting of slogans.</p>
      <p>Several people were wounded, one man in a white tee-shirt being beaten with sticks by protesters.</p>
      <p>Another man lay in a pool of blood on the pavement.</p>
      <p>Broadcaster RTHK said district councillor Andrew Chiu was among the wounded and that part of his ear had been bitten off.</p>

      <p>A kitchen knife lay on the ground outside the mall.</p>
      <p>"These police are not what they used to be," said Julie, 24, giving police the middle finger.</p>
      <p>"They come in here and push us around. It is not right."</p>
      <p>Police made several arrests.</p>
      <p>There were scuffles, confrontations and vandalism in malls in the New Territories towns of Tai Po, Tuen Mun and Sha Tin, where police fired pepper spray as protesters hurled abuse.</p>

      <p>Pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong, which was returned to Chinese rule by Britain in 1997, battled police across the territory's main island on Saturday.</p>
      <p>They are furious at Communist Party leaders in Beijing and perceived Chinese meddling with Hong Kong's freedoms, which China denies.</p>
      <p>They have vandalised Hong Kong businesses seen as being pro-China and in July daubed China's Liaison Office, the key symbol of Chinese sovereignty, with graffiti.</p>
      <p>Police fired tear gas, rubber bullets and a water cannon at protesters on Saturday and early Sunday as the violence spilled from Hong Kong island across the harbour to Kowloon.</p>
      <p>One of the protesters' key demands is an independent probe into perceived police brutality.</p>
      <p>There have been several injuries, including a protester shot in the chest and a policeman slashed in the neck, but no deaths since the protests began in June.</p>
      <p>Hong Kong returned to China under a "one country, two systems" formula which guarantees its freedoms for 50 years.</p>
      <p>China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) has a garrison in Hong Kong but troops have remained in barracks since the protests began.</p>
