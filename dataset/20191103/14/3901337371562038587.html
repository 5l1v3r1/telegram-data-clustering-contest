      <p>The Gunners' struggles continued on Saturday afternoon after being held to a 1-1 draw by Wolverhampton Wanderers, although the Gunners only sit three points adrift of the top four.</p>
      <p>Mourinho's name has been thrown into the hat as a possible replacement for Emery, with the Portuguese having been out of work since December after his departure at Old Trafford.</p>
      <p>According to the Times, Mourinho had dinner with Arsenal chief Raul Sanllehi this week as the club consider replacing Emery following a string of poor results.</p>

      </p>
      <p>It is believed that the Portugese tactician impressed Sanllehi with his plans for the Gunners squad.</p>
      <p>The report goes on to claim that the Spaniard has a couple games left to save his status, but the draw with Wolves on Saturday certainly upped the pressure, with supporters expressing their unhapiness at the full-time whistle.</p>
      <p>The Gunners manager was asked if he felt under pressure recently, to which he replied,"I am very demanding myself and I feel my responsibility to work every time to come back with a better result in the next matches."</p>
