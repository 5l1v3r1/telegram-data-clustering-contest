      <p>NEW YORK (WABC) -- Three years after NYPD Sgt. Paul Tuozzolo died in the line of duty, his wife is running the TCS New York City marathon in his honor.</p>
      <p>With days to go before the marathon, Lisa Tuozzolo is preparing for the race and obsessing about the course she will soon face - but she has already conquered so much more.</p>
      <p>"This is a little bit of a physical metaphor of my life," she said. "26.2 miles of keeping going and not stopping and forging ahead."</p>
      <p>It was three years ago when her husband said goodbye to Lisa and their two boys, Austin and Joseph, and left for work at the 43 precinct in the Bronx.</p>
      <p>But he never came home.</p>
      <p>He was killed in the line of duty when a man pull a gun and shot him in the chest.</p>

      <p>Last year, two years to the day since Lisa's loss, <a href="https://abc7ny.com/society/mural-unveiled-marathon-run-in-memory-of-fallen-nypd-sergeant/4625235/">a friend of hers ran the marathon in her husband's honor</a> and wore his shield number on his bib.</p>
      <p>And now it is her turn. Tuozzolo has been training hard for months, and during the race, she'll be joined at each mile by a different member of Paul's precinct - all while she raises money to support other families of fallen heroes.</p>
      <p>"I'm doing this for Paul. I know he's looking down and one side of his mouth he's saying am I nuts am I out of my mind, and on the other side he's saying how proud he is of me for proving that nothing's gonna knock me down," Lisa said.</p>
      <p>Tuozzolo has already raised several thousand dollars for the <a href="https://www.crowdrise.com/o/en/campaign/team-ssf/lisatuozzolo">Silver Shield foundation</a>, which provides educational assistance to the kids of fallen first responders.</p>
