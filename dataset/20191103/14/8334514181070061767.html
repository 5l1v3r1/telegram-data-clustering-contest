      <p>ABU DHABI (Reuters) - The United Arab Emirates’ central bank said on Sunday it is studying projects for Lebanon that had been proposed an at investment forum in the capital Abu Dhabi last month.</p>
      <p>“We decided to study and recommend to the leadership in light of developments recently,” Mubarak Rashid al-Mansouri told reporters when asked whether the UAE had given any aid to Lebanon since that country’s prime minister visited last month.</p>
      <p>The central bank subsequently said in a statement sent to Reuters that the governor was referring to “the proposed projects during the UAE - Lebanon Investment Conference” that took place in October.</p>
      <p>Mansouri added he hoped the situation would improve in Lebanon, which is grappling with nationwide protests and its worst economic crisis since the 1975-90 civil war.</p>
      <p>Last month then Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri said the UAE had promised investments and financial aid to Lebanon but nothing materialized.</p>
      <p>Hariri, who has been traditionally backed by the West and Sunni Gulf Arab allies, resigned last week declaring he had hit a “dead end” in trying to resolve Lebanon’s crisis.</p>
