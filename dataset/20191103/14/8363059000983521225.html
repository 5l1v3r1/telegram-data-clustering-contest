      <p><a href="http://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/08/rosa-salazar-wants-to-play-alita-for-literally-the-rest-of-her-life/"><i>Alita: Battle Angel</i></a> didn’t do as well as it could or maybe, in this humble writer’s opinion, <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/robert-rodriguez-breaks-down-how-much-the-manga-inspire-1835612494">should have</a>, but that’s not going to stop <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/robert-rodriguez-is-making-a-kids-superhero-movie-starr-1837447415">Robert Rodriguez</a> from getting into the big-budget science fiction game.</p>
      <p>As <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/robert-rodriguez-hyptnotic-movie-solstice-studios-studio-8-1202769757/">Deadline</a> reports, Rodriguez’s project <i>Hypnotic </i>is getting off the ground, with Solstice Studios and Studio 8 collaborating to produce and distribute the film. Written by Rodriguez and Max Borenstein, the scribe behind <i>Kong: Skull Island</i>, the film is a story, called a “sci-fi thriller” last year by the <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/robert-rodriguez-kong-skull-island-writer-team-sci-fi-thriller-hypnotic-1086623%5C">Hollywood Reporter</a>, about a detective, a mysterious government organisation, and a series of “impossible high-end heists.”</p>
      <p>Set to shoot next year, it sounds like an exciting time. Rodriguez is attached to produce, though it’s unclear if he’ll step up to the director’s chair.</p>
