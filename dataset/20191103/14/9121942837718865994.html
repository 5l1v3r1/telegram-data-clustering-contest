      <p>NAPERVILLE, Ill. (AP) — A group of mostly African-American people celebrating a birthday party at a Buffalo Wild Wings in suburban Chicago allege they were asked to change tables because of their skin color.</p>
      <p>Justin Vahl says he was at a Naperville restaurant last month with children and adults when a host asked him about his ethnicity. Later, a manager asked the group to move because a regular customer didn’t want to sit near black people.</p>
      <p>Vahl, of nearby Montgomery, says he’s multiracial. His wife, Mary, first shared the story on social media. After several managers tried to move the group, they left for another restaurant.</p>
      <p>Buffalo Wild Wings spokeswoman Claire Kudlata says a “thorough internal investigation” is being conducted and apologized for “any unacceptable behavior.”</p>
      <p>The DuPage County NAACP says it’ll look into the matter.</p>
