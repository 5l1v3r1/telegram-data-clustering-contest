      <h1>Abalone fishing in Oman between these dates in December</h1>

      <p><b>Muscat:</b> The Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries (MoAF) has decided to only allow the fishing of abalone between December 7 to 16 every year.<br/><br/>The decision came after Dr. Hamad bin Saeed Al-Awfi, Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, issued Ministerial Decree No. 346/2019 amending some provisions of the executive regulation of the law for fishing and protection of living aquatic resources.<br/><br/>Article (15) of the amended law bans the fishing of Abalone throughout the whole year, except between these dates in December. Abalone fishing is one of the most important fishing activities in Dhofar Governorate.<br/><br/>It is available only at the coastline between the Wilayat of Mirbat and the Niyabat of Sharbathat in the Wilayat of Shaleem and Al Halaniyat Islands, besides small catching areas in the Niyabat of Souqrah in Al Wusta Governorate.</p>

      <p>The Sultanate is the only Arab country that has Abalone in its waters. Other types of abalone are available in countries such as China, Japan, South Africa, Canada, the USA and Australia.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In a attempt to prevent the abalone from becoming extinct, the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries banned its fishing for three years (2008, 2009 and 2010), in addition to a ban on fishing, collecting and trading in Abalones that are less than 90 millimetres in size.</p>
