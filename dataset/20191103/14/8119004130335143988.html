        <b>The Anti-Corruption Commission has begun grilling controversial contractor SM Golam Kibria Shamim, better known as GK Shamim, over the accumulation of illegal wealth.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Director Iqbal Hossain led the interrogation after Shamim was brought to the ACC headquarters in Segun Bagicha from the Dhaka Central Jail in Keraniganj around 2:15 pm on Sunday, said the anti-graft watchdog's spokesperson Pranab Kumar Bhattacharya.</p>
      <p>Dhaka's Senior Special Judge Court placed Shamim on a 7-day remand in custody of the ACC on Oct 27 after rejecting his bail plea in the case.</p>
      <p>Shamim, who made a fortune as a contractor and identifies himself as a Jubo League leader, is accused of amassing Tk 2.97 billion illegally.</p>
      <p>RAB seized about Tk 20 million in cash, Tk 1.75 billion worth of fixed-deposit receipt or FDR savings, alcohol and firearms during a raid on his business in Dhaka's Niketon amid the crackdown on the illegal casino business.</p>
