      <p>Universal Studios Hollywood received an impromptu concert from a Grammy-winning musician over the weekend. On social media, <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1088986/john-legend-gets-drunk-and-performs-all-of-me-in-public-watch-chrissy-teigen-s-video">Chrissy Teigen shared footage of a John Legend performance</a> after he got wine drunk. Donned in a red onesie, Legend took to a CityWalk stage in Los Angeles on Friday, Nov. 1 to perform a drunken rendition of his 2013 ballad “All of Me.” In the clip, which appears to have <a href="https://twitter.com/yashar/status/1190693503702949889">originally been captured by journalist Yashar Ali</a>, Teigen simply cannot contain her laughter as her husband performs a live version of the love ballad written specifically for her in front of a small crowd.</p>
      <p>“John got wine drunk and sang a song at universal studios last night," Teigen captioned the Twitter clip on Saturday, Nov. 2. <a href="https://twitter.com/chrissyteigen/status/1190693999587127297">She later added in a follow-up tweet</a>, “the whole joke was supposed to be that literally no one was watching or at the stage but then he got on stage and was like ITS ME JOHN LEGEND.”</p>
      <p>In the impromptu performance, Legend changed up the lyrics with a self-love twist. He sings in the clip, “I give my all to me, I give my all to me. I’m my end and my beginning. Even when I lose I’m winning. ‘Cause I give me all of me.”</p>

      <p>Teigen and Legend have long been the embodiment of #RelationshipGoals. The two, who met on the set of <a href="https://www.marthastewartweddings.com/358304/chrissy-teigen-and-john-legends-formal-destination-wedding-lake-como-italy">Legend's music video for "Stereo" in 2006, tied the knot</a> in September 2013. The couple share two children, Luna, 3, and Miles, 1, together.</p>
      <p>Legend’s impromptu concert comes on the heels of the family’s <i>Vanity Fair</i> photoshoot. In the cover interview published on Oct. 28, <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/10/john-legend-and-chrissy-teigen-cover-story">Teigen and Legend opened up about all things marriage</a> and their childhoods. On the early stages of his relationship with Teigen, Legend told <i>Vanity Fair</i>, “It got serious pretty quickly. She just entertained the hell out of me, texting me. What people respond to in her tweets today was the same energy in those texts. I didn’t know that I wanted someone funny until I was actually with someone funny.”</p>
      <p>Teigen added of their seemingly idyllic marriage, “There are some famous couples I look at and I’m like, ‘Ugh, we get it. Stop trying so hard, you’re so lame.’ I think people definitely think that about us but… that’s because I think of everything.”</p>
