      <p>A man in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/midwest/wisconsin">Milwaukee</a> allegedly threw battery acid on another man's face Friday night, police said, adding that it stemmed from an argument over a parking spot.</p>
      <p>Mahud Villalaz, 42, suffered second-degree burns on his face, <a href="https://fox6now.com/2019/11/02/police-man-attacked-with-supposed-battery-acid-near-13th-and-harrison-suspect-on-the-run/">Fox 6 reported</a>. Police did not respond to Fox News' request for comment, but the Journal Sentinel <a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/local/2019/11/02/milwaukee-battery-acid-attack-man-burned-police-looking-suspect/4140669002/">reported</a> officers were investigating the incident as a racially motivated <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/hate-crime">hate crime</a>.</p>
      <p>Speaking before reporters Saturday, Villalaz said he no longer felt safe to go outside.</p>

      <p>"I feel scared being an American citizen," said Villalaz, adding that he's a native of Peru who immigrated to the U.S. when he was young. "I feel scared that I cannot feel protected in my own country with my neighbors."</p>
      <p>Villalaz told reporters he'd parked near a Mexican restaurant for dinner around 8:30 p.m. Friday when a man from a nearby bus stop approached him and spoke to him in an anti-immigrant tone, the Journal Sentinel reported.</p>
      <p>"He approached me with those hate words," Villalaz said. "Go back to your country. You don’t belong here. This is my country."</p>

      <p>Villalaz said the suspect had a "little bag he carried on the side." The suspect pulled out a bottle, uncapped it and threw a substance on his face, Villalaz said.</p>
      <p>The substance was so strong that it burned through his jacket and sweatshirt, Villalaz said. Police were searching for the attacker who has been described as a white man, approximately six feet tall with a medium build.</p>
