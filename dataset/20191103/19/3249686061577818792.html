      <p><a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/mamamoo">MAMAMOO </a>has revealed a new cinematic teaser poster for their comeback.</p>
      <p>For their upcoming 2nd full album, MAMAMOO has came up with a Halloween-like concept where the girls dress up as potential characters in a movie. Interestingly enough, the album is called '<b>reality in BLACK</b>'. <a href="https://www.allkpop.com/article/2019/11/mamamoo-drops-a-teaser-image-for-its-2nd-full-album">As seen previously</a>, the acronym '<i>BLACK</i>' stands for "<i>Bless Life and Carry Knowledge</i>", signaling a rather philosophical concept!</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the teaser post was juxtaposed with the question: "<i>What if.... MMM is not MMM?</i>". Is MAMAMOO now making fans question the whole reality of MAMAMOO itself?</p>
      <p>Stay tuned for more updates! MAMAMOO's comeback album has been set for release on November 14.</p>
