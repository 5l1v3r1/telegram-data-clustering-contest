      <p>From sprays and gels to candles and even charcoal bags, there are countless ways to keep your home smelling fresh. The <a href="http://reviewedchoice.com/best-home-air-fresheners/">best air fresheners for home</a> will largely depend on your lifestyle and preferences.</p>
      <p>For those who like to control how much air freshener is applied, a spray would be your best option. Conveniently portable, they can be used in any room of the house and some can even be sprayed directly on fabrics. However, if you're someone with allergies or sensitivities to strong odors, you’ll want to make sure that the option you choose avoids any harsh chemicals and ingredients (like my overall best pick, below). Candles are another option that you can use as needed, though you'll need to be sure not to leave them unattended. Meanwhile, gel fresheners and activated charcoal bags are two low-maintenance options that offer continuous odor control, though the former may need to be replaced every couple of months, while the latter can work for years to eliminate odors.</p>
      <p>A final consideration is whether or not you have pets. Even if an air freshener is free of chemicals, it may use essential oils, which can be <a href="https://www.foundanimals.org/essential-oils-toxic-pets/">toxic for dogs, cats, and other animals</a>. When in doubt, it's best to get the OK from your veterinarian before introducing a new air freshener into your home.</p>
      <p>After researching many products and scouring through reviews, I’ve put together a list of various fresheners to ensure your home stays fresh. Read on for my list of the <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/the-12-best-air-fresheners-for-bathroom-smells-78451">best air fresheners</a> for your home.</p>

      </p>
      <p><b>What's great about it: </b>Available as a set of two, this <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I9QJ5S?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=bustle-18177909-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;creativeASIN=B000I9QJ5S">Fresh Wave odor removing gel freshener</a> lasts for up to 60 days, so you won't have to worry about frequent reapplying like you would with a spray.

Nontoxic and non-GMO, the gel gradually evaporates over time until it's ready to be replaced.</p>
      <p><b>What fans say: </b>"Finally a solution to the stale "ick" in the air. I'm an unsuccessful failure of a clean freak, but I draw the line at a smelly house, whether from laundry that needs catching up, 3 young kids and their messes or the dog. I've never seen anything like this product. It's like it sucks in the staleness without pushing out a strong scent like a candle or Glade plug in would do. You don't smell the product, you just don't smell the staleness anymore. Yes, if you stick your face right into the jar, you get the pine, woodsy scent, but it's a clean smell, not overpowering."</p>
