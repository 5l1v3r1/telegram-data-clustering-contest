      <p>There is a special account on Instagram dedicated to otters. We know little about these animals. They can be as cute and soft as kittens. And this beautiful white cat seems to know it: just look how happy it is playing and cuddling with its new friend. Truly, animals can teach us what unconditional love and friendship is.  </p>
