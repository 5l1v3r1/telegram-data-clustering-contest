      <h1>Minkah Fitzpatrick proves his worth with insane 96-yard INT return for TD (Video)</h1>

      <p>It’s really starting to look as if the Steelers got the better of the Dolphins in the Minkah Fitzpatrick trade.</p>
      <p>Pittsburgh may have given up a first-round draft pick to acquire Fitzpatrick, but it received one of the league’s most talented young defensive backs in return. Fitzpatrick is a rangy, intelligent player who is capable of making game-changing plays, and the Steelers would be wise to build their secondary around him.</p>
      <p>The Steelers were in bad shape in the first half of Sunday’s game against the Colts, trailing 10-3, with Indianapolis in the red zone. Fitzpatrick completely swung the momentum back in his team’s favor by picking off a Ryan Tannehill pass and returning it 96 yards for the touchdown.</p>
