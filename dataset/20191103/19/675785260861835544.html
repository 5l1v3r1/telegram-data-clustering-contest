      <h1>Chilling 'Doomsday map' shows how UK will be left underwater in 80 years' time</h1>
      <h2>Millions of homes across the UK are at risk of being completely submerged if carbon emissions go unchecked</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T19:52:28+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 19:52</time> by <a rel="author">Neil Murphy</a></address>
      <p>A chilling new map has revealed how parts of the UK will be left underwater in a matter of decades as climate change causes sea levels to rise.</p>
      <p>Major areas such as Liverpool, London and Humberside could be left completely submerged as early as 2100, according to research from Climate Central.</p>
      <p>Most scientists agree that climate change is melting polar ice sheets, adding significant amounts of water to the world's oceans.</p>
      <p>A detailed new study has revealed how low-lying coastal areas across the world are now at risk of being completely flooded.</p>

      <p>Vast swathes of Britain could be wiped out by the encroaching waters which are represented by a terrifying red block.</p>
      <p>Cardiff, Swansea and north Wales, east Yorkshire and Hull, Peterborough and Norfolk, and the coast from Lancaster to Liverpool could be submerged in just 80 years time - unless urgent action is taken immediately.</p>
      <p>Some 3.6 million people in Britain would face annual flooding and up to 5.4 million by 2100 if carbon emissions continue unchecked.</p>
      <p>Coastal defences would need developing at great cost to protect householders from floods.</p>

      <p>Climate Central found that if temperatures went up 4°C from pre-industrial levels the seas could rise by as much as 10.8 metres.</p>
      <p>World leaders are currently trying to keep temperatures within 2°C which would keep the amount of people losing their homes to 130 million.</p>
      <p>They believe that at least 500 million people globally would have their homes submerged if there is just a rise of 9 metres in the most likely scenario.</p>
      <p>Amsterdam - the Dutch capital - would be almost completely consumed by the rising waters.</p>
      <p>Dr Scott Kulp, a senior scientist at Climate Central and lead author of the study, says it is not too late to take action to prevent this 'doomsday' scenario.</p>

        <figcaption>Scientists say it is not too late to cut carbon emissions</figcaption>

      <p>Rapid emission cuts would save 50 million people worldwide from annual coastal flooding by 2100, the report suggests</p>
      <p>Dr Kulp said: "These assessments show the potential of climate change to reshape cities, economies, coastlines, and entire global regions within our lifetimes.</p>
      <p>“As the tideline rises higher than the ground people call home, nations will increasingly confront questions about whether, how much, and how long coastal defences can protect them.”</p>
