      <h1>Mum with PTSD after premature birth told mental health issues 'not serious enough'</h1>
      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: Virginia Field-Bennett, 35, from Canada, was living in London when she gave birth to her son Finlay prematurely</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T19:13:55+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 19:13</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Kitching, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/chris-kitching/</a></address>
      <p>A first-time mum with a history of depression was told her mental health problems "weren't serious enough" before she <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/giving-birth">gave birth prematurely</a> and developed PTSD.</p>
      <p>Virginia Field-Bennett had begged for help from a mental health team before the delivery and traumatic aftermath, but says her pleas were ignored.</p>
      <p>Aside from PTSD, it's likely she also had postpartum depression after her son Finlay arrived early - and says she continued to ask for help but eventually gave up.</p>
      <p>With her newborn in an incubator she was brought to tears by her "crippling guilt" and it felt like her body was constantly shouting "where is your baby?"</p>
      <p>Virginia, who also had a history of anxiety before her pregnancy, has since suffered flashbacks and her husband Laurie, also 35, has experienced similar trauma following their experience in neonatal intensive care.</p>

      <p>As she spent five weeks on an antenatal ward, one consultant suggested her problems were not serious enough when she asked to see someone from a mental health support team.</p>
      <p>Virginia, now 35, told Mirror Online: "Near the end of my stay a senior female consultant coldly suggested the reason I may not have been seen was because 'that department usually only deals with people with serious mental health issues'.</p>
      <p>"I'm not usually caught speechless but I was shocked. I just accepted it and began to question my ability to deal with stress."</p>
      <p>The former Londoner's pregnancy was going well until a routine 25 week scan revealed a problem with her cervix in 2017.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>She was shocked when she was admitted to the antenatal ward and put on strict bed rest despite feeling "completely fine".</p>
      <p>Virginia, a former social media consultant, said: "My diagnosis was cervical incompetence - my cervix was open and funnelling.</p>
      <p>"An absolute nightmare for anyone and an awful introduction to parenthood."</p>
      <p>She "struggled" in hospital and suffered a panic attack on her first night as she spoke to a consultant about being forced to stay in the induction room for the first three nights due to a lack of beds.</p>

      <p>Once she was moved out of the room she adjusted to life on the ward, but she was filled with anxiety and fear.</p>
      <p>She said: "I've dealt with mental health issues long enough to know when to ask for help, so I did, as soon as I felt emotions getting out of control.</p>
      <p>"I requested help every day for the first three weeks I was on bed rest in the antenatal ward and roughly every other day after that until Finlay arrived.</p>
      <p>"I explained to each doctor that visited on ward rounds that I have a history of generalised anxiety disorder and depression and that I was not coping.</p>

      <p>"I needed help and was not scared to ask for it. The whole experience really added to my trauma.</p>
      <p>"My requests were consistently met with blank faces and I was told every day that they would look into it, that they would speak to someone who may know who I could talk to.</p>
      <p>"No-one ever came. I felt as if they didn't believe I was really struggling."</p>
      <p>She had a history of anxiety and depression, and had been doing well and was off medication for eight years.</p>
      <p>Even though her requests went ignored, Virginia said medics on the antenatal ward were "truly wonderful" and offered "compassion".</p>
      <p>She added that the NICU nurses and doctors who cared for Finlay were "incredible".</p>
      <p>At almost 30 weeks, the mum-to-be went into spontaneous labour. By then she had been on the antenatal ward for almost five weeks.</p>

      <p>Virginia gave birth to her son, who weighed 2lbs 11oz, and he was whisked into the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), where he would spend the next six weeks.</p>
      <p>She said: "He was in pretty great shape considering his prematurity.</p>
      <p>"It was just awful having to leave him there every day.</p>
      <p>"We had trouble sleeping, my husband reduced his workload by half.</p>
      <p>"We were coping, but I was in tears daily - it was like my body was shouting 'where is your baby' constantly.</p>
      <p>"I was scared to go in to see him out of guilt and for fear of bad news, and I was torn apart every second I didn't have him near me."</p>

      <p>She added: "I felt incredibly guilty for feeling a sense of relief when I went into labour, knowing the anxiety and uncertainty of the last five weeks was about to be over.</p>
      <p>"I felt I'd failed him - my body being unable to keep him in was the reason he was born so early.</p>
      <p>"And I felt guilty for feeling anxious and depressed when, really, I had a healthy baby who's biggest issue was that he was very small.</p>
      <p>"We were meeting families who were dealing with the loss of one twin, whose babies were having life-threatening surgeries, who had been in the neonatal ward for six months or more.</p>
      <p>"The heaviest guilt came when I'd go home and leave Finlay in hospital."</p>
      <p>In some happy news, Finlay was discharged a month earlier than expected.</p>

      <h3>What are the risks of premature birth?</h3>
      <p>About 60,000 babies, or one in every 13, are born prematurely (before the 37th week of pregnancy) in the UK every year, according to the charity <a href="https://www.bliss.org.uk/prematurity-statistics-in-the-uk">Bliss.</a></p>
      <p>The earlier they are born, the more vulnerable they are because they haven't fully developed in the womb</p>
      <p>Some may suffer from conditions such as behavioural difficulties, long term health problems or cerebral palsy as they develop into children and adults.</p>
      <p>Some research has found that the earlier a baby is born the higher their risk of having special educational needs at school, the charity said.</p>
      <p>It added: "It is important to remember that every baby is different and will develop differently. If you are worried about your baby’s development please speak to a health professional."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>His parents later realised they hadn't processed everything they had been through and it was having a negative effect on them.</p>
      <p>Virginia sought help from her GP after Finlay turned one and later saw a psychologist who diagnosed her with PTSD and said she likely had postpartum depression.</p>
      <p>She said: "I had really struggled with flashbacks, crippling anxiety and depression for a year, and roughly three months later was contacted by my borough's perinatal team.</p>
      <p>"They were so kind, they listened, and they referred me to a psychologist who I eventually had 11 weekly sessions with.</p>
      <p>"She was wonderful and I'm so grateful to have been able to work through things with her.</p>
      <p>"She suggested I had more work to do for my trauma, but wasn't able to see me any longer.</p>
      <p>"I could see she wanted to, but they are only allowed 10 sessions.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>"I couldn't believe that either - as if 10 sessions is enough time to work through a great deal of trauma and difficulty. Such a disappointing policy."</p>
      <p>She added: "In hindsight, it strikes me as shocking that NICU parents aren't just automatically issued a meeting with a psychologist to talk through everything that has happened.</p>
      <p>"You're caught in a whirlwind of information and emotion, living on autopilot, then when your baby is finally discharged, you're relieved but it's not like it's over.</p>
      <p>"People don't always ask for help or realise they need help."</p>
      <p>Virginia and Laurie have since moved to Vancouver in her native Canada.</p>
      <p>Laurie, a business coach, suffered similar trauma and was left struggling to come to terms with everything.</p>
      <p>He said: "The whole period was emotionally challenging for me, but the impact of that really only surfaced many months after Finlay's birth.</p>

      <p>"I think the reason for that was that seeing that both [Finlay] and Virginia were safe and well allowed me engage with all my own fears, which I'd set aside to 'be strong' and help Virginia stay positive before, during and after.</p>
      <p>"All that has affected my work - both through balancing working with daily visits to the hospital over 11 weeks, and through the difficulty of finding focus with everything else going on.</p>
      <p>"I'm seeing a therapist to work through it, and it's helping a lot."</p>
      <p>Finlay is now aged two-and-a-half and his parents are grateful that he is "thriving" after being born early and small.</p>
      <p>Virginia, who is training to be a meditation guide and MBSR (mindfulness-based stress reduction) facilitator, said: "His speech has been assessed as advanced in all his development assessments, he is stubborn and challenging and loving and everything a boy his age should be.</p>
      <p>"He's still catching up size-wise, but he likely would have been small even if he wasn't born prematurely. Both Laurie and I were tiny kids."</p>
      <h3>Virginia's advice for NICU parents</h3>
      <p>Having a child in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) is a traumatic experience for mums and dads.</p>
      <p>Virginia offers the following advice for parents:</p>
      <p>- Be kind and considerate of the people around you - staff and fellow patients. Everyone is in a difficult situation and they're likely doing the best they can.</p>
      <p>- Don't play the comparison game - everyone's struggle is real and valid. Comparing your situation to others' will only make the situation worse.</p>
      <p>- Adhere to the hand-washing rules - I know this one seems silly, but I saw so many parents/family members get lazy about it, sometimes not even washing. That laziness could kill a baby.</p>
      <p>- Open up to the nurses - one nurse named Marta saw I was in a bad way, and so she hugged me and suggested we worked through some logistical difficulties I was having.</p>
      <p>"In that moment I felt like she saved me. I felt heard and supported. Another senior nurse patiently taught me to breastfeed my son, as I was having a lot of difficulty and feeling awful about it. I'll never forget either of them.</p>
      <p>- Seek professional help to work through your emotions if you're struggling.</p>
      <p>- Talk to your partner - this is hard for both of you and you need to support one another more than ever.</p>
      <p>- NICU life is like a roller-coaster - there will be good days and bad days throughout your stay.</p>
