      <p>Presidential candidate Donald Trump on October 3, 2015: “We’re going to build a wall, and it’s going to be impenetrable, it will be a real wall.”*</p>
      <p>*”But you can cut through any wall.” – President Donald Trump on November 2, 2019.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/smugglers-are-sawing-through-new-sections-of-trumps-border-wall/2019/11/01/25bf8ce0-fa72-11e9-ac8c-8eced29ca6ef_story.html">Washington Post</a> published a report on Saturday revealing how smugglers in Mexico have been getting past Trump’s billion-dollar border wall through comically simple means, such as makeshift ladders and electric saws anyone can buy at their local Home Depot.</p>
      <p>But when confronted with the failure of his prized project, Trump merely shrugged it off.</p>
      <p>“We have a very powerful wall,” Trump told reporters on Saturday. “But no matter how powerful, you can cut through anything, in all fairness.”</p>
      <p>He claimed the breaches could be “easily fixed.”</p>
      <p>“One of the reasons we did it the way we did it, it’s very easily fixed,” Trump said. “You put the chunk back in. But we have a very powerful wall.”</p>
      <p>“But you can cut through any wall,” he added.</p>
      <p>The remarkably casual response comes after Trump has used the wall as a rallying cry repeatedly on the campaign trail, shut down the government for <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/dc/trump-backs-down-for-now-agrees-to-reopen-government-for-three-weeks">35 days</a> to pressure Congress into funding it, and extracted <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/trump-admin-military-projects-border-wall-billions">$8 billion</a> from military funds to pay for the wall when Congress refused to give in.</p>
