      <h2>'Replica gun" triggered an alarm</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T19:14:46+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 19:14</time> by <a rel="author">Alaa Elassar, CNN</a></address>
      <p>(CNN) - TSA agents at New Jersey's Newark Liberty International Airport were prepared to give a traveler crap when they spotted a revolver in his carry-on bag.</p>
      <p>But upon closer inspection, what they thought was a gun was really a gun-shaped toilet paper holder.</p>
      <p>"Yes, this most unusual revolver was not designed to spin bullets," TSA joked in a <a href="https://www.tsa.gov/news/releases/2019/10/31/how-not-roll-through-checkpoint">press release</a> on Thursday. "It was designed to spin toilet paper."</p>
      <p>The "realistic replica gun" triggered an alarm when the bag it was in went through an X-ray machine.</p>
      <p>"TSA does not permit travelers to bring real or replica firearms through a checkpoint," the agency said. "However, it would have been ideal to pack this pistol in a checked bag."</p>
      <p>According to TSA, passengers are not permitted to bring real or fake firearms through security checkpoints.</p>
      <p>The man was given a few choices: return the item to his vehicle, put it in a checked bag, give it to a friend who wasn't traveling, or surrender it to TSA. He chose to surrender it, TSA spokesperson Lisa Farbstein told CNN.</p>
      <p>Travelers who follow the rules will have an easier time rolling through security.</p>
