      <p>We’ve earlier <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/samsung-may-be-working-on-cheaper-galaxy-s-and-galaxy-note-series/">reported</a> that Samsung is considering bringing a “Lite” version of its Note and S series to the market. While we didn’t get to know much about the specs, according to previous rumors, the cheaper Galaxy S10 smartphone with model number <b>SM-G770F</b> and the upcoming Galaxy A91 are going to share a lot of similarities in terms of specifications.</p>
      <p>Now the good news is we now know what the upcoming cheaper Galaxy S could like, thanks to the latest patent that’s filed Samsung and published by USPTO. The Samsung patent is of a device that looks very similar to the design aesthetic of the current Galaxy S10 smartphone and hence, it’s easier to draw a conclusion that the patent is for the cheaper Galaxy S10 Lite smartphone. That said, whether Samsung will officially call it Galaxy S10 Lite or something else is unknown.</p>

      <p>Aside from the look of the smartphone, we also know about what’s inside the smartphone. The cheaper Galaxy S10 model could feature a 6.7-inch FHD + Infinity-O display and the Snapdragon 855 is what the smartphone is going to depend on for its processing power. The smartphone is also rumored to be coming with a huge 8GB of RAM and powering the smartphone will be a 45oomAh battery.</p>
