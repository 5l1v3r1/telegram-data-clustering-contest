      <p>Yung Baby Tate's time is fast approaching. After gaining considerable traction with her Megatron Challenge entry, bookended by an outstanding <i>GIRLS</i> project and a hefty set of strategic visuals and placements, the Atlanta-bred multihyphenate has carved out an interesting subset in budding pop stardom, effortlessly vacillating between the roles of singer, rapper, producer, and Platinum-recording songwriter.</p>
      <p>Now, she is capitalizing off of the momentum with her forthcoming <i>CAMP</i> album, set to be premiered with a companion show during Red Bull Music Festival's appearance in her hometown this month. But just ahead of <i>CAMP's</i> arrival, YBT has touched down with the album's title track, setting the outline for the genre-hopping know-how of Yung Baby Tate.</p>
      <p>Get into "CAMP" below.</p>

      <p>So we go to C-A-M-P<br/>Donâ€™t you wanna get away with me<br/>We can go to a place so free where<br/>You can be who you wanna be</p>
