      <p>President Donald Trump has threatened to cut US funding to California for aid during wildfires that have burned across the state.</p>
      <p>Neither of the two major fires burning in California are on forest land.</p>
      <p>Mr Trump tweeted saying California governor Gavin Newsom has done a “terrible job of forest management”. He said the governor comes to the federal government for help every year when fires rage.</p>

      <p>He added: “No more.”</p>
      <p>Mr Newsom replied with a tweet of his own: “You don’t believe in climate change. You are excused from this conversation.”</p>
      <p>The state controls a small percentage of forest land. The federal government manages most of it.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, authorities lifted all evacuation orders as progress was being made on a large wildfire north west of Los Angeles.</p>
      <p>Firefighters contained 50% of that fire, which has burned nearly 15 square miles and forced nearly 11,000 people to evacuate.</p>
      <p>Crews working in steep areas were battling hotspots amid lingering winds, county fire captain Steve Kaufmann said.</p>

      <p>Last year Mr Trump made a similar threat as wildfires devastated Malibu and Paradise, California – accusing the state of “gross mismanagement” of forests.</p>
      <p>At the time Mr Newsom defended California’s wildfire prevention efforts while criticising the federal government for not doing enough to help protect the state.</p>
      <p>In Northern California, more people were allowed to return to areas evacuated due to a huge fire that was burning for days in the Sonoma County wine country.</p>
      <p>The 121-square-mile fire was 76% contained, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said.</p>
