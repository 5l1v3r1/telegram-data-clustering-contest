      <h1>Pixel 4 has USB video output disabled in software</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T19:00:16+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 19:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/author/corbin-davenport/" target="_blank">Corbin Davenport</a></address>
      <p>The Nexus 5 was the last of Google's phones to support video output over a wired connection (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhLsemE2Thk">remember SlimPort?</a>), but some have continued to hold out hope for the feature. While it doesn't come as much of a surprise that the Pixel 4 <i>still</i> doesn't support wired video output, one interesting fact about it has been discovered: it seems to be disabled in software.</p>
      <p>A commit has been found in the Android source code that disables DisplayPort over the USB Type-C port in the Pixel 4. The commit message simply reads, "Disable DP function."</p>

      <p>Now before you rush to the comments to make a "Google just wants people to buy Chromecasts instead of cheap 3rd-party cables!" remark, there's no telling why the feature is actually turned off. It's possible video output was never working properly in the first place when the Pixel 4 was being developed, or Qualcomm could charge an additional licensing fee for DisplayPort support which Google was unwilling to pay.</p>
      <p>Some were hoping the Pixel 4 would support video output now that Android 10 supports <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/05/27/android-q-desktop-mode-up-and-running-through-experimental-third-party-launcher/">a basic form of a desktop UI</a>, but there was never any evidence that Google would build its own DeX-style feature for the Pixels. A similar instance happened in 2015, when <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2015/05/28/android-m-feature-spotlight-external-storage-can-be-adopted-as-true-internal-storage-or-accessed-normally-with-no-additional-apps/">Google drastically improved microSD support in Android</a>, and some believed that the next Nexus phone would have a microSD card slot (spoiler: it didn't).</p>
      <p>We've reached out to Google to ask for more information, and we'll update this post if we get a response.</p>
