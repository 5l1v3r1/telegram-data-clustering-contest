      <h1>Roberto Firmino's "offside armpit" stirs VAR debate</h1>

      <p>BIRMINGHAM: The passionate debate over <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Video-Assistant-Referee">Video Assistant Referee</a> (<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/VAR">VAR</a>) reviews in the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/premier-league">Premier League</a> took a surreal turn on Saturday when Liverpool striker <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Roberto-Firmino">Roberto Firmino</a>'s armpit was ruled offside.</p>
      <p>Firmino's 28th minute shot would have been an equaliser for Liverpool, who were trailing 1-0 to Aston Villa at the time, but a linesman ruled him offside and VAR confirmed that.</p>
      <p>"The red line signifies Firmino was aligned to his armpit, which was marginally ahead of the last Villa defender," the Premier League tweeted by way of explanation above a photo with a line perpendicular to the ground going into the Brazilian's armpit.</p>
      <p>Liverpool might have been furious at the ruling - had they not scored two late goals to snatch victory.</p>
      <p>"We won 2-1, it’s now not that serious," Liverpool manager Juergen Klopp said, adding that his analyst had shown him the incident after the game and he did not see an infraction.</p>
      <p>"Sometimes it’s in your favour, and sometimes it’s against you. That's how it is. We have to make sure the new system helps the game and not confuses, that's all."</p>
      <p>Villa manager Dean Smith said he thought Firmino was hard done by. "They’ve had the disallowed goal in the first half which I thought was a goal ... We’ve had gnat’s hair goals ruled against us ourselves (in past games)."</p>
