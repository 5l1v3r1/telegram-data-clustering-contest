      <h1>India need to work on finishing and deep defence, says hockey team coach Graham Reid</h1>

      <p>BHUBANESWAR: Endeavouring to accomplish an "unfinished" task at the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Tokyo-Olympics">Tokyo Olympics</a>, Indian men's <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/hockey">hockey</a> team coach <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Graham-Reid">Graham Reid</a> wants strikers with incredible finishing skills and a strongly fortified defence.</p>
      <p>The Australian oversaw India's entry into next year's quadrennial extravaganza with victories over Russia in FIH's Qualifiers.</p>
      <p>Reid was part of the team that won silver at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics but, as a coach, he had a disastrous campaign at the 2016 Rio Games, as the Kookaburras crashed out in the quarterfinals.</p>
      <p>"Obviously, I have an unfinished business. You always dream of an Olympics podium finish. I was lucky to win one as a player and those memories are things you hold on to," said Reid after India confirmed their place at the Tokyo Games on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Eight-time champions India qualified after thrashing Russia 7-1 in the second game to win the double-leg FIH Olympic Qualifiers 11-3 on aggregate at the Kalinga Stadium here.</p>
      <p>"That's what we need to bring to this team and give it a big shot (in Tokyo)," the 55-year-old coach said.</p>
      <p>"I told the players just now that we have nine months (before Olympics). Just get better and better, that's our plan. Focus on the process, result will take care of itself."</p>
      <p>Reid said his players will look to polish their game in the coming months.</p>
      <p>"I think for me what we need to get better in is finishing. We are creating a lot of opportunities, which is great. But we need to get more returns.</p>
      <p>"Also in deep defence, we have to get tighter. We are still giving away too many opportunities (to opponents)," he said.</p>
      <p>After opting out of the inaugural edition last year, India will make their debut in the FIH Pro League against the Netherlands in January next year.</p>
      <p>After Netherlands, India will host Belgium and Australia in February before embarking on overseas tours.</p>
      <p>Reid believed playing against top teams will be handy for his side in its preparation for the Games.</p>
      <p>"That's one of the things that Pro League does, that it sets up competition schedule between now and Olympics," he said.</p>
      <p>"It's great that we have a squad of 33, which may have to become 32. Pro League is a big opportunity, to work out for the Olympics and there are a lot of games during that period.</p>
      <p>"If all of them play all those games, they will be in their best shape to play at the Olympics," Reid added.</p>
      <p>India captain Manpreet Singh congratulated their female counterparts, who too have sealed an Olympic berth by beating USA 6-5 on aggregate.</p>
      <p>"It's quite good that the women too have qualified. They did a lot of hard work and got the goal in the final minutes after being down 0-4. They deserve it," he said.</p>
