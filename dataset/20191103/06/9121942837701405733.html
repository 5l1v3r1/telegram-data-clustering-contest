      <p>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) — El Salvador has ordered the expulsion of Venezuelan government diplomats, joining the U.S. and more than 50 other countries that have said opposition leader Juan Guaidó is Venezuela’s rightful leader.</p>
      <p>El Salvador said Saturday that the diplomats, who are loyal to Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, had 48 hours to leave the country.</p>
      <p>The office of Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele is also calling for free elections in Venezuela as a way out of its long-running political and humanitarian crisis.</p>
      <p>Guaidó, who leads Venezuela’s opposition-controlled congress, declared himself interim president in January, saying Maduro’s re-election last year was fraudulent. Maduro says Guaidó is collaborating with the United States in an attempt to stage a coup.</p>
      <p>Ronald Johnson, the U.S. ambassador in El Salvador, welcomed the country’s decision to expel pro-Maduro diplomats.</p>
