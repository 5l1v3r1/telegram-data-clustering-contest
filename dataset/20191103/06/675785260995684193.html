      <p>Canelo Alvarez was ahead on two of the three scorecards when he produced a stunning KO to beat Sergey Kovalev.</p>
      <p>The Mexican threw a devastating right hook in the penultimate round to send the light-heavyweight champion through the ropes.</p>
      <p>And the three judges' scorecards revealed Canelo was heading for victory on points until he rendered the scores irrelevant.</p>
      <p>Two judges had the challenger leading 96-94 while the third had the fight a draw at 95-95.</p>

      <p>After he was crowned champion, Alvarez said: "This is just a step in my career, in my history.</p>
      <p>"All I ask for is patience, because Canelo will make history, I guarantee.</p>
      <p>"We knew there were going to be five or six rounds and it was going to take some time for me to get him.</p>
      <p>"Much credit to him, heâ€™s a great fighter, but we stuck to our gameplan.</p>
      <p>"It was delayed a little bit, but overall it was successful."</p>
