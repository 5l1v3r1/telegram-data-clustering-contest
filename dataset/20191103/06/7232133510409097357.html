      <h3>Ethereum Price Weekly Analysis</h3>
      <p>This past week, Ethereum started a downside correction below the $188 and $185 supports against the US Dollar. Moreover, ETH traded below the $182 and $180 support levels.</p>
      <p>However, the $178 support area (the previous resistance) acted as a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/01/ethereum-eth-stuck-in-range-bitcoin-struggling-near-9k/">strong support</a>. Besides, the price managed to stay above the $175 pivot and the 100 simple moving average (4-hours).</p>
      <p>As a result, the price started a slow rise above the $180 resistance. There was a break above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $194 swing high to $178 swing low. The price even climbed above the $184 level, but it seems like it is facing hurdles near $185-$186.</p>
      <p>Additionally, the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $194 swing high to $178 swing low is currently acting as a resistance. Therefore, an upside break above the $185 and $186 resistance levels could set the pace for more gains.</p>
      <p>The next key resistance is near the $190 area, above which Ethereum will most likely surge towards the $200 and $205 resistance levels. On the downside, there is a major bullish trend line forming with support near $182 on the 4-hours chart of ETH/USD.</p>
      <p>If there is a fresh decline below the trend line, the price could find support near the $180 level and the 100 simple moving average (4-hours). The main support is near the $178 level, below which there is a risk of an extended decline in the coming days.</p>

      <p>The above <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/ETHUSD/">chart</a> indicates that Ethereum price likely to break the $185 and $186 resistance levels. In the mentioned bullish case, the price is likely to continue higher towards the $190 and $200 levels. Conversely, the $180 and $178 support levels holds the key. If there is a bearish break below $178, the price may perhaps test $175 and $166.</p>
