      <p>WELLINGTON: Chris Jordan's all-around brilliance could not prevent New Zealand from securing a series-levelling 21-run victory against England in the second Twenty20 International of the five-match series on Sunday.</p>

      <p>Jordan claimed 3-23 to help restrict the hosts to a modest 176-8 at the Wellington Regional Stadium after England captain <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Eoin-Morgan">Eoin Morgan</a> won the toss and elected to field.</p>
      <p>Jordan then returned to blast 36 off 19 balls, but England could not recover from a top order collapse and were all out for 155 with one ball remaining in their innings.</p>
      <p>Put in to bat, New Zealand lost <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/colin-munro">Colin Munro</a> in the third over but opener Martin Guptill made 41 and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Colin-de-Grandhomme">Colin de Grandhomme</a> and Ross Taylor contributed 28 each to steady the innings.</p>
      <p>It was Jimmy Neesham's 42 off 22 balls, however, that helped New Zealand past the 175-mark.</p>
      <p>Home captain <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/tim-southee">Tim Southee</a> rocked England early, dismissing Jonny Bairstow with the first ball of the innings.</p>
      <p>Dawid Malan made 39 and Morgan chipped in with 32 but England struggled to keep their chase on track.</p>
      <p>Jordan clobbered leg-spinner <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Ish-Sodhi">Ish Sodhi</a> for three sixes, injecting fresh life into the contest, but <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Mitchell-Santner">Mitchell Santner</a> stopped the carnage by dismissing the batsman and effectively ending the contest.</p>
      <p>"When the fielders are backing the bowlers up, it makes it that much easier," Santner said of their improved fielding after being adjudged man-of-the-match for his superb spell of 3-25.</p>
      <p>"We just needed to improve a little bit in all three aspects (from Christchurch)," he added. "We needed to adapt our plans a little bit but we managed that."</p>
      <p>The teams now move to Nelson for the third match on Tuesday.</p>
