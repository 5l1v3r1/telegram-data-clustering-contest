      <h1>Wall Street closing at a record-high prompts warnings that it could be another false dawn</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T06:10:07+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 06:10</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/stephen-letts/5639296" target="_blank">Stephen Letts</a></address>
      <p>US-China trade talks progressing well? Tick. Another strong set of US jobs data? Tick. Corporates beating earnings forecasts? Tick. <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-10-31/us-federal-reserve-cuts-interest-rates-for-third-time-this-year/11656712">The Fed's "insurance" rate cut</a>? Tick.</p>
      <p>With all the boxes ticked, it was little surprise Wall Street closed the week at a record high. It was the third record in five days for the benchmark S&amp;P500.</p>
      <p>Green shoots were popping up everywhere.</p>
      <p>The US jobs numbers could not have been much better; unemployment still near a 50-year low, wages growth a solid 3 per cent and employment growing by 128,000 — a very solid effort given the 42,000 striking General Motors workers were deemed to be unemployed and those jobs lost.</p>
      <p>It was certainly taken as a signal US consumers would continue to do their bit to keep the economy from grinding to a halt.</p>
      <p>US manufacturers seem to be in a happier place too. The latest IHS survey showed a modest expansion in activity, having stalled for a couple of months mid-year.</p>
      <p>"Tentative signs of renewed vigour are appearing in the US manufacturing sector, with the survey's production gauge having now risen for three successive months to suggest that the soft patch bottomed out in July," IHS Markit chief business economist Chris Williamson said.</p>
      <blockquote>"Growth of new orders hit a six-month high, fuelled in part by a renewed increase in exports, prompting producers to take on more staff, with payroll numbers rising at the quickest pace since May."</blockquote>
      <p>In China, there was similarly positive news in manufacturing; although oddly enough the official PMI survey (focusing on large state-owned enterprises) had a more sour view on things that the private Caixin-Markit PMI survey (focusing on small to medium enterprises).</p>
      <h3>Trade progress</h3>
      <p>But perhaps the best news came on the trade front.</p>
      <p>Both the US and Chinese camps were in hearty agreement that things were on track to sign the "phase 1" deal later this month.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The state-owned Xinhua News Agency said the world's two largest economies had reached "consensus on principles" during a serious and constructive telephone call on Friday between their main trade negotiators.</p>
      <p>White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow was even more effusive saying while the deal wasn't 100 per cent complete, "enormous progress" has been made, particularly on the vexed issue of intellectual property rights.</p>
      <p>"You're going to get a strong reaction from what seems like a deal for now," Again Capital Management's John Kilduff told Reuters in New York.</p>
      <blockquote>"This markedly improves the outlook for the global economy — particularly in Asia where it has suffered the most from the fallout from the trade war."</blockquote>
      <p>Shifting the dials on trade and global manufacturing sentiment saw "buy" orders flooding back into the oil market, driving Brent futures up more than 3 per cent.</p>
      <h3>Haven't we seen this before?</h3>
      <p>But is this conclusive evidence things have bottomed out? Don't be so sure, argues Bank of America global economist Ethan Harris.</p>
      <p>"This would not be the first time green shoots have come and gone. By our count, there have already been at least six false dawns in the trade war," Mr Harris said.</p>
      <p>So why the optimism again given the green shoots have been burnt off many times before? Mr Harris says there are a few things at play.</p>
      <p>"First, some of the 'improvement' reflects expectations coming down to meet reality," he said.</p>
      <blockquote>"Second, as usual, the equity market is sniffing out a potential turn in the economy well before it happens — sometimes it sniffs out a true recovery and sometimes it doesn't.</blockquote>
      <p>"The market bounce in October probably reflects not just optimism about future growth, but also signs of a skinny deal on trade and faith in the Fed to provide a floor under growth.</p>
      <p>"Third, mini-cycle in inventories may be helping some companies, even as sales remain weak."</p>
      <p>That doesn't mean things won't get better, just maybe a bit later than the market is betting, argues Mr Harris.</p>
      <p>"We still don't expect growth to start to pick up until early next year, with another rate cut from the Fed and further easing in China along the way," he said.</p>
      <h3>RBA on hold</h3>
      <p>While the Fed paid for its insurance with another 0.25 per cent cut last week, there's little likelihood the Reserve Bank will do the same at its rate-setting meeting on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The odds of a November cut have blown out 50/50 a few weeks ago to less than 10 per cent now.</p>
      <p>The RBA was given a bit of breathing space with unemployment ticking down a notch to 5.2 per cent and slightly stronger than expected (but still weak) <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-10-30/inflation-edges-up-taking-some-heat-off-rba-to-raise-rates/11652388">September quarter inflation</a>.</p>
      <p>Just how much breathing space may be evident when the RBA publishes its latest quarterly forecasts in Friday's Statement on Monetary Policy.</p>
      <p>Citi's Josh Williamson said he expects very little revision in the outlook, after a spate of downgrades in previous updates.</p>
      <p>"This reflects the likelihood of the year-end CPI [inflation] and unemployment rate forecasts being achieved and for the long-run outlook to remain consistent with Governor Lowe's comments that previous rate cuts 'are helping the Australian economy and supporting the gentle turning point in economic growth'," Mr Williamson said.</p>
      <p>The only change Citi is forecasting is the RBA cutting its year-end GDP growth forecast from 2.5 per cent to 2.25.</p>
      <p>Given it's already November, if the RBA forecasting department can't nail it from here they may need to invest in some new software, or calculators at the very least.</p>
      <h3>Retail reality check</h3>
      <p>Leaving aside the RBA and its musings, retail data may be just about as significant with both quarterly and monthly sales figures out on Monday.</p>
      <p>Given domestic consumption accounts for almost two-thirds of the economy, they are important pieces of the puzzle.</p>
      <p>Backtracking a bit, June quarter retail sales were, in the words of Westpac chief economist Bill Evans, "dismal".</p>
      <p>They rose just 0.2 per cent, taking annual growth to, yup, 0.2 per cent, which is a fair indication how the three quarters before that went.</p>
      <p>In short, weaker than the GFC and the slowest growth in retail sales since Australia's last official recession in the early 1990s.</p>
      <p>Mr Evans said despite the rate cuts and tax refunds, the September quarter numbers will not show a significant improvement.</p>
      <p>"While slightly positive, the gains are lacklustre given the scale of the policy boost to disposable incomes — the combined effect of rate cuts in June and July and the tax relief from July 1 adding around $3 billion a month through Q3," he said.</p>
      <blockquote>"As it stands, the 'cash splash' is barely a trickle for sales so far."</blockquote>
      <p>The external side of the ledger will be the focus of Thursday's trade figures.</p>
      <p>Exports are still booming — the trade surplus will still be large, forecast to be around $5 billion in September, but well down from the record of almost $8 billion in June.</p>
      <p>Of course, iron ore prices dropping back was always inevitable, falling from around $120 to $90 a tonne as Brazilian exports resumed.</p>
      <p>But with commodity prices looking challenged across the board, the June record may not be threatened for some time.</p>
      <p>On the housing front, Friday sees the release of September loan approvals.</p>
      <p>While some of the <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-10-31/home-lending-flat-approvals-up-in-mixed-housing-data/11658506">housing data has been mixed</a>, the general vibe is things are ticking up again with turnover and <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-11-01/house-price-rebound-accelerates-in-october/11661400">prices rising</a> since the June trough.</p>
