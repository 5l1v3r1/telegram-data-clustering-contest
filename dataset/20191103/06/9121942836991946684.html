      <p>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) — The Royals have declined their half of Alex Gordon’s $23 million mutual option for 2020, allowing the outfielder to become a free agent.</p>
      <p>Gordon had exercised his part of the option but was allowed to go free Saturday. He will receive a $4 million buyout, completing a $72 million, four-year contract he agreed to in January 2016.</p>
      <p>A three-time All-Star and six-time Gold Glove winner, Gordon helped the Royals win the 2015 World Series for their first title since 1985.</p>
      <p>He batted .266 this year with 13 homers and 76 RBIs for the rebuilding Royals, who topped 100 losses for the second straight season. Gordon is a career .258 hitter with 186 homers and 738 RBIs.</p>
