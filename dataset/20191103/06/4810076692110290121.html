      <h1>70% of Americans Dislike Daylight Savings Time</h1>

      <p>An anonymous reader quotes a <i>Yahoo News 360</i> report on Americans who hate Daylight Savings Time: <i>A push to end the semiannual clock shift, which has been shown to correlate with negative health and productivity outcomes, <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/should-daylight-saving-time-be-eliminated-152706486.html">is gaining steam throughout the country</a>. Most of the momentum is behind a movement to make daylight saving time permanent so the "spring forward" lasts all year long. A number of states including California, Florida, Washington and Oregon have taken legislative steps to do just that, but an act of Congress would be needed for any of those changes to go into effect.</i> <br/>Meanwhile, CBS News reports: <i>Most people across the country will see their clocks roll back an hour this weekend as nearly eight months of daylight saving time come to an end. It is part of a twice-a-year ritual that most want to stop. <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/time-changes-large-majority-americans-dislike-twice-year-time-changes-ap-norc-poll-shows/">Seven in 10 Americans prefer not to switch back and forth</a> to mark daylight saving time, a new poll shows.</i> <br/>The poll also shows that 33% of Americans younger than 45 prefer the current system of switching clocks twice a year -- compared to just 24% of Americans 45 or older.</p>
