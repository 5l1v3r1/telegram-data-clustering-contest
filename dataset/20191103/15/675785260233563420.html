      <h1>Peter Crouch provides unique response to Roberto Firmino's 'armpit' VAR call</h1>
      <h2>The former Liverpool forward seems to be happy that he retired shortly before VAR came into the Premier League</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T15:00:10+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 15:00</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/mark-jones/</a></address>
      <p>Former Liverpool forward Peter Crouch has given his unique take on Roberto Firmino's controversial disallowed goal at Aston Villa.</p>
      <p>Reds forward Firmino saw what would have been an equalising goal ruled out on Saturday when the assistant referee deemed him to be offside.</p>
      <p>However, a VAR review showed that the Brazilian was as good as level with Villa defender Tyrone Mings, before ultimately deciding that he should be given offside.</p>
      <p>The Premier League put out a tweet clarifying why the decision was made at half-time of the game, which <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> went on to win 2-1 to preserve their six-point lead at the top of the table.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>It read: "Liverpool's Roberto Firmino was flagged offside before putting the ball in the net against Aston Villa and the decision was confirmed by VAR.</p>
      <p>"The red line signifies Firmino and was aligned to his armpit, which was marginally ahead of the last Villa defender."</p>
      <p>Pundits including <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/chris-kamara-claims-var-official-20801816">Sky Sports' Chris Kamara</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/new-footage-proves-roberto-firmino-20801307">beIN Sports' Andy Gray</a> have found fault with the decision-making process though, citing that prior to the offside decision being made two other lines were drawn that showed Firmino behind Mings and therefore onside.</p>

      <p>Many fans also found the fact that Firmino's armpit was mentioned in the decision to be somewhat laughable.</p>
      <p>Crouch, who also played for Villa during a long career in the top-flight which ended this summer, seems to agree, and says that he'd have faced issues with VAR had it have been in action when he played.</p>

      <p>Tweeting to his 732,000 followers, the 6ft 7ins former forward wrote: "If I’d have been playing in the VAR era my long arms would have been offside for about 50 goals."</p>
      <p>Luckily for him it wasn't though, with Crouch managing 108 Premier League strikes in his career, including six for Aston Villa and 22 for Liverpool.</p>
