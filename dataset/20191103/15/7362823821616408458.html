      <p>An autopsy determined Garcia’s death was caused by "compression injuries to her neck," officials said.</p>
      <p>An investigation determined Gaffney had been with Garcia in the backseat of her car when she died, Musella said.</p>
      <p>Gaffney and Garcia had been together at a party in a high-rise apartment that night, the <a href="https://dailyvoice.com/new-jersey/cresskill/police-fire/maywood-man-21-charged-in-death-of-bloomingdale-woman-19-in-car-outside-hackensack-party/778625/">Hackensack Daily Voice</a> reported.</p>
