        <b>Scottish Conservative MP Ross Thomson is to stand down after being accused of sexually assaulting a Labour MP in a Commons bar.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Mr Thomson said he had made the "hardest decision of my life" not to contest the seat for Aberdeen South at the general election.</p>
      <p>Labour MP Paul Sweeney had said he reported Mr Thomson to Westminster's standards watchdog following the alleged incident last October.</p>
      <p>Mr Thomson denies any wrongdoing.</p>
      <p>But he said a number of "anonymous and malicious allegations" this year had made his life "a living hell".</p>
      <h3>'Political smear'</h3>
      <p>Mr Thomson, 32, said: "This is a political smear and I will continue to fight to clear my name. I will see this investigatory process through to a conclusion.</p>
      <p>"I have suffered a level of personal abuse that has affected my health, my mental wellbeing and my staff. It has been a level of abuse that I never imagined possible."</p>

      <p>He added: "I have therefore made the most difficult decision that I could ever make. I have decided that I will stand down as the Scottish Conservative and Unionist candidate for Aberdeen South."</p>
      <p>Mr Sweeney, who is the MP for Glasgow North East, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7644115/Tory-MP-tried-stick-hand-trousers-says-male-Labour-MP.html">told the Scottish Mail on Sunday</a> he was left feeling "mortified" by the alleged attack in the Strangers' Bar at Westminster.</p>

      <p>According to the paper, Mr Sweeney said he was "paralysed" with shock after Mr Thomson "groped" him in the bar.</p>
      <p>He said the alleged incident took place in October 2018 after he had invited a group of his old Glasgow University friends for a tour of the Commons.</p>
      <p>They later went to the Strangers' Bar for a drink where he claims they were interrupted by Mr Thomson, who was "drunk to the point where he was barely able to stand up".</p>
      <p>Mr Thomson then allegedly grabbed at Mr Sweeney through his clothes.</p>
      <h3>'Absolute confidentiality'</h3>
      <p>Mr Sweeney said he repeatedly told Mr Thomson to stop touching him and asked him to leave.</p>
      <p>The Labour MP said that he later asked for advice from the Women's Aid charity before approaching the Standards watchdog.</p>
      <p>A House of Commons spokeswoman said: "Parliament's Independent Complaints and Grievances Scheme (ICGS) operates on the basis of absolute confidentiality.</p>
      <p>"Therefore we cannot provide answers about any complaint that may or may not have been made."</p>

        <figcaption>Mr Thomson said dealing with the allegations had been "nothing short of traumatic"</figcaption>

      <p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-47172889">In February, Mr Thomson was publicly accused of groping</a> a man in the same Commons bar. The Tory MP also strongly denies any wrongdoing relating to that alleged incident.</p>
      <p>Mr Sweeney said he was finally speaking out in public more than a year after the alleged assault because the investigations had "barely progressed".</p>
      <h3>'Baseless claims'</h3>
      <p>A spokesman for the MP said: "This assault, which took place last October, was reported to the appropriate authorities after similar but entirely separate allegations were made by other men against Ross Thomson in February.</p>
      <p>"Thomson's denials today fly in the face of what was witnessed by other MPs and visitors and show him to be utterly unrepentant."</p>
      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/RossThomson_MP/status/1190901442598621184">Mr Thomson had issued a statement on Twitter</a> on Sunday morning in which he strenuously denied Mr Sweeney's allegations, but insisted he would be a Tory candidate in the 12 December general election.</p>
      <p>However, he later confirmed he was standing down from the job he "loved more than any other".</p>
      <p>Mr Thomson, who has been an MP since 2017, said: "I always believed politics was about noble pursuits and doing what you believed to be best for your country.</p>
      <p>"My experience is that our politics is now so poisonous that we will never attract good, honest and decent people in the first place.</p>
      <p>"This has been without doubt the hardest decision of my life. I remain confident that the ongoing parliamentary standards process will find in my favour, and that these baseless claims will be shown up for what they are.</p>
      <p>"As I have already said I will continue to explore all options available to me in response to the defamatory and damaging allegations made by Mr Sweeney."</p>
