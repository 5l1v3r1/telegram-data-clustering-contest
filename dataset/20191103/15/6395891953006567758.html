      <p><b>GROVE CITY, OhioÂ (AP)</b> - An Ohio baker who swam from Cuba to Florida at age 65 in 1978 will receive another posthumous honor.</p>
      <p>Walter Poenisch (PAYN'-ish) has been selected for induction into the International Marathon Swimming Hall of Fame. The ceremony for the class of 2020 will be next May 2 at Fordham University in New York.</p>
