      <p>“It’s mad,” Scarratt said. “At the start of the season, I was still playing sevens, so I have come back to 15s and got my teeth back into it.</p>
      <p>“There are some massively exciting times ahead, a big two years.</p>
      <p>“There is lots of rugby to play, and we want to use the next two years as best we can.</p>

      <p>“We want to go to New Zealand (for the World Cup) in 2021 and come away with a gold medal.”</p>

      <p>England, Wales, Japan and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/new-zealand">New Zealand</a> also received nominations in the team category, but the Springboks’ latest triumph was recognised as captain <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/stormers/players/siya-kolisi/">Siya Kolisi</a> received the award from World Rugby vice-chairman Agustin Pichot.</p>
      <p>England wing <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/bath/players/joe-cokanasiga/">Joe Cokanasiga</a> missed out on the breakthrough player title.</p>
