      <p>Boris Johnson is preparing to give a tax cut of up to £460 to the country’s lowest earners if victorious at next month’s general election.</p>
      <p>The Conservative party is reportedly planning on doing this by raising the wage threshold at which people start to pay National Insurance as a part of the Tories’ election manifesto.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The current threshold is £8,632, however it has been suggested this could rise to £12,500, according to The Sunday Telegraph.</p>
      <p>This would be in line with the minimum threshold to pay income tax and provide a tax cut of £460 to the average worker.</p>
      <p>It would exempt 2.4m people from paying any National Insurance contributions, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies.</p>
      <p>Business secretary Andrea Leadsom told The Sunday Telegraph today that the party is committed to cutting taxes in its manifesto.</p>
      <p>“A Conservative government will always be a tax-cutting government,” she said.</p>
      <p>Johnson initially indicated a willingness to increase the National Insurance threshold during the summer’s Conservative leadership campaign.</p>
      <p>He said: “I think we should be looking at lifting people on low incomes out of tax, lifting the thresholds for national insurance and I would remind you that that’s where my priority is.</p>
      <p>“When I was mayor of London we led the way, for instance with the London living wage and I think lifting National Insurance contribution thresholds would be another good thing to do.”</p>
      <p>National Insurance is taken from workers’ salaries and used to fund the NHS, benefits and the state pension.</p>

      <p>Each £1,000 increase of the wage threshold will take away £3bn in tax revenues, according to a study by the Institute for Fiscal Studies.</p>
      <p>The institute also said that increasing the National Insurance threshold was “probably the best thing one can do” to give tax relief to low earners.</p>
