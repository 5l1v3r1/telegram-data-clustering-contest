      <p>Police were called three times Thursday night in reference to the situation at the restaurant in Jackson, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation said in a news release. The first call was made over an angry customer, the second was over a fight and the last call reported shots had been fired. </p>
      <p>Authorities said the shooting was initiated when Nicholas Phinazee Bryan, 27, of Milner, used racial slurs in a confrontation with two men, the <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/crime--law/middle-georgia-man-fatally-shot-waffle-house-after-allegedly-using-racial-slurs/R4ctsac4DBdU5b5U82JtQP/">Atlanta Journal-Constitution</a> reported.</p>
      <p>Bryan was asked to leave the Waffle House by staff, but instead, a physical altercation ensued between Bryan and one of the two men, according to the GBI. Bryan was then allegedly shot by the second man. </p>
      <p>The GBI was called by the Butts County Sheriff’s Office just past midnight to investigate the incident.</p>

      <p>Bryan was taken to Monroe County Hospital where he later died at about 3 a.m., the GBI said. An autopsy will be performed, officials said.</p>
