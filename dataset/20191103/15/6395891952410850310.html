      <p><b>CRANSTON, R.I.Â (AP)</b> - U.S. Sen. Jack Reed is encouraging Rhode Island residents to participate in the Veterans History Project, an initiative to collect and preserve wartime experiences.</p>
      <p>The Rhode Island Democrat and Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden are hosting a celebration for the project's 20th anniversary at 10:30 a.m. Monday at the Cranston Public Library's main branch.</p>
      <p>The American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress says it collects, preserves and makes the personal accounts of American war veterans accessible, so future generations can understand the realities of war.</p>
      <p>Reed and Hayden will explain how people can collect and preserve veterans' oral histories. Several local veterans will be paired with volunteer interviewers during the event.</p>
      <p>Reed, an Army veteran, says more than 110,000 veterans have shared their stories with the Library of Congress.</p>
