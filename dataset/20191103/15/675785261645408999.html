      <p>Eleven British tourists were among 33 people injured in a horror <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/coach-crashes">coach crash</a> on a motorway in northern France.</p>
      <p>Three of the Britons were seriously injured when the FlixBus coach reportedly skidded in the wind and rain, smashed into a guardrail as it took an exit and rolled over on to its side on the A1, east of Amiens.</p>
      <p>It was travelling from Paris to London with passengers from eight nations - the UK, France, the US, Spain, Australia, the Netherlands, Romania and Russia.</p>
      <p>Firefighters cut a hole in the back of the bus to free some of the injured passengers who were trapped inside the overturned vehicle.</p>

      <p>"According to the latest findings, there were 32 passengers and one bus driver on board.</p>
      <p>"Injured passengers were taken to local hospitals; those not requiring medical attention are being taken care of by local authorities.</p>
      <p>"FlixBus is in close contact with the relevant authorities in order to determine the exact cause of the accident and to ensure all passengers receive appropriate support.</p>
      <p>"An emergency phone number is available for the passengers and their relatives."</p>
      <p>A Foreign Office spokesman said: “We are in contact with the French authorities following a road traffic accident in France and we will do all we can to assist any British people who need our help.”</p>
      <p>FlixBus is a German company that runs intercity bus service in Europe and the United States, working with regional bus companies.</p>
      <p>It is extremely popular with young people on a tight budget, especially students.</p>
