        <b>The High Court has upheld the central bank's amnesty to loan defaulters, allowing them to reschedule classified loans with 2 percent down payment and 9 percent interest over 10 years.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The court issued the order on Sunday after hearing a writ petition challenging the legality of Bangladesh Bank's circular offering the privilege.</p>
      <p>It also ordered the formation of a committee to make recommendations on the matter in view of the purported shortcomings of banks in approving and recovering loans.</p>
      <p>The High Court on May 21 had put a freeze on the circular responding to an appeal from the Human Rights and Peace for Bangladesh, a human rights organisation.</p>
      <p>The top court subsequently halted the stay order for two months but barred those availing the privilege from borrowing funds from any other bank during that time.</p>
