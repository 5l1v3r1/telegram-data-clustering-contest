      <h2>The injured Ukraine international was watching from the sidelines as the defending champions left it late to beat Southampton</h2>

      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/kyle-walker">Kyle Walker's</a> late winner for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/southampton-fc">Southampton</a> sent the Etihad Stadium crowd into raptures - including team-mate <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/oleksandr-zinchenko">Oleksandr Zinchenko</a> .</p>
      <p>The defending <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/premier-league">Premier League</a> champions had to come from behind to defeat the Saints after James Ward-Prowse had put the visitors ahead early in the first half.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/sergio-aguero">Sergio Aguero</a> drew <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/pep-guardiola">Pep Guardiola's</a> men level in the 70th minute, before Walker struck four minutes from time as City claimed an eighth league triumph of the season.</p>
      <p>The winning goal sparked wild celebrations in the stands at the Etihad, with Walker's fellow defender Zinchenko also getting in on the action.</p>

      <p>The Ukraine international is currently sidelined until December after having surgery on a knee problem, but looked surprisingly sprightly after Walker scored late on against Southampton.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old uploaded a clip to his <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> account where he could be seen cheering after watching his fellow full-back net a crucial goal for the top flight giants.</p>
      <p>It's not the first time Zinchenko has been seen celebrating wildly in recent weeks having gone viral after helping his country qualify for Euro 2020.</p>
      <p>Footage emerged of the City star hugging and kissing his girlfriend, Ukrainian TV presenter Vlada Sedan.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old also ambushed the set where pundits were giving their take on a 2-1 win over Portugal and also loudly screamed down a camera.</p>

      <p>Zinchenko's latest brilliant celebration could be justified given the potential significance of the goal, with Walker himself aware how tight the title race with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> could be.</p>
      <p>The defending champions are already six points adrift of the leaders, but knows there is still a long way to go until this year's crown is won.</p>
      <p>'There are still so many games to play in the Premier League. Obviously, a lot of people talk about the title race, but anything can happen in football as you have just seen," said the ex-Tottenham man.</p>
      <p>'We just need to keep doing our job, keep getting the three points and that's all we can do really.'</p>
