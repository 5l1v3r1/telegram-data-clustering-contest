      <p>The New York City Marathon is like the city itself.</p>
      <p>Sprawling across five boroughs, this race takes all kinds of people. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/03/sports/nyc-marathon.html?module=inline">Some of the fastest in the world</a> are here, as are plenty of folks who will take six, seven or 10 hours to complete the 26.2-mile race. They will cross the finish line after sundown.</p>
      <p>There are racers with two legs and racers with no legs. There are runners who can see and others who can’t. There are people who run the course nearly nude, and others who run it in a three-piece suit.</p>
      <p>It is loud almost the entire way, from the moment runners step off the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, until they take those final steps near Tavern on the Green in Central Park.</p>
      <p>It is chaotic. The starting village at Fort Wadsworth is something of a pop-up shelter. The turns through Brooklyn, the bridges into each borough, the sea of discarded paper cups that cover the ground after the fluid stations are all an adventure to navigate.</p>
      <p>But to experience all this is to fall in love with it, especially on a day when the air is crisp, the sky is blue and the sun and all those hundreds of thousands of people cheering for 50,000-plus runners feel as warm as a loving embrace from an old friend.</p>
      <p>It’s entirely possible that every big city is at its best on marathon day. These races, this mass of humanity lining up and traversing 26.2 miles just for the fun of it as another mass of humanity cheers them on, is unique to this period in human history. This sort of thing didn’t happen 200 or 500 or 1,000 or 10,000 years ago.</p>
      <p>Their loss.</p>
