      <p>A <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/salmonella-outbreak-ground-beef">Colorado</a> woman was arrested after cops said she tried to shoot her neighbor with a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/texas-deputy-crossbow-struck-head-with-crossbow-investigators">crossbow</a>.</p>
      <p>Court papers say that when the neighbor opened the door to her <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/lea-michele-haunted-apartment-new-york-city-supernatural">apartment</a> in Longmont, Colo., at 3 a.m. Friday, her downstairs neighbor Katherine Cherry “stuck a black crossbow through the door and fired an arrow at her.” KUSA-TV reports.</p>
      <p>The document says the arrow flew down the hallway after grazing the neighbor, according to the station.</p>
