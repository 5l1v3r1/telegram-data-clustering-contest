      <h1>FIA take action against those cutting corners on COTA</h1>

        <b>In qualifying, drivers were able to take some wide lines around the Circuit of the Americas. Especially at turn eight where a number of drivers ran wide and might have gained an advantage. One of those yellow sausage kerbs has now been added to the wider line. </b>
      </p>
      <p>Drivers can still attack the apex, but can't go fully off the track unless they fancy taking a ride over the sausage kerb. The placement of the curb in turn eight is tactically done. </p>

      <p>Times were deleted for wide running at turn 19. If a driver does this three times during the United States Grand Prix, they will be given a black and white flag. </p>
      <p>What is important here is that if a driver leaves the track, he must return in a way that is considered safe. Also, no obvious benefit may be gained. </p>
