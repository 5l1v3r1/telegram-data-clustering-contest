      <p>If you take a 10-minute shower once a day, that means you are spending about 60 hours per year in the shower — after about 10 years, that adds up to 25 days of standing in your shower. That seems like as good of a reason as any to invest a little money into <a href="https://www.bustle.com/articles/188855-12-best-shower-gadgets-bathroom-accessories-that-are-actually-useful">shower gadget and accessories</a> that make the space as high-tech, efficient, and fun as possible.</p>
      <p>No matter what size shower you have, there are tons of brilliant products that you can use to upgrade your bathroom without a full-blown reno. Most of them are simple solutions (often coated with suction cups) that solve everyday issues. They also transform your shower into the relaxing, stress-free environment that it should be, because no one wants to unwind under a stream of hot water only to get wound up again by hair tumbleweeds and chlorine-agitated skin.</p>
      <p>Then, once all the basic conveniences are taken care of, there are a few products thrown in there just for fun, because why <i>not </i>end<i> </i>your day blasting your favorite playlist while you enjoy a glass of wine thanks to your shower wine caddy?</p>
