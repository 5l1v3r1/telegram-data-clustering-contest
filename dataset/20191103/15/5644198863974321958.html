      <p>SEPANG:Â Spain's Alex Marquez was crowned world champion in the Moto2 class as he finished second in the Malaysian Grand Prix Sunday (Nov 3) following a tough race against winner Brad Binder.</p>
      <p>The Kalex rider, who is the younger brother of MotoGP world title holder Marc Marquez, completed the race at the Sepang circuit in 38min 8.601 sec.</p>

      <p>He was 0.758 behind Binder, but a second-placed finish was enough for him to take an unbeatable lead in the standings with 262 points, and just one race remaining this season.</p>
      <p>"It's a dream come true," said an emotional Marquez, as his brother Marc jumped and cheered at the side of the track, pumping his fists in the air.</p>
      <p>The 18-lap race was a hard-fought duel between Binder and Marquez. The South African, riding a KTM, initially took the lead only for Marquez to push past him near the start of the race.</p>
      <p>But a few laps later, Binder managed to swing inside the Spaniard as they rounded Turn 1, with the rivals' bikes wobbling as they briefly made contact, and get back in front.</p>
      <p>The South African held on to the lead for the rest of the race, with Marquez never really looking like a threat, but coming second was enough to hand the 23-year-old the world title.</p>
      <p>Binder said that he gave "my absolute all today".</p>
      <p>"The track was insane, the grip was absolutely nothing compared to what we had all weekend," he added.</p>
