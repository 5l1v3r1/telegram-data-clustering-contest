      <p>NEW DELHI: Stand-in skipper <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Rohit-Sharma">Rohit Sharma</a> is on the verge of achieving another feat on Sunday when he leads the Men in Blue in the first contest of the three-match T20I rubber at the Arun Jaitley Stadium as the star opener will become the most-capped Indian T20I player after <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/mahendra-singh-dhoni">MS Dhoni</a>.</p>
      <p>Rohit has played 98 T20Is since making his debut at the World T20 in 2007 and will go past Dhoni's tally of 98 T20Is for India.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the Mumbai batsman will move to the third place on the list of players with most T20I appearances after Pakistan's Shoaib Malik (111) and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Shahid-Afridi">Shahid Afridi</a> (99).</p>

      <p>Meanwhile on Sunday, Rohit could also break <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Virat-Kohli">Virat Kohli</a>'s record for most runs scored in T20I cricket. Rohit is currently seven runs behind Kohli's tally. While the stand-in captain averages just above 30 in T20Is, Kohli is well ahead 2,450 runs.</p>
      <p>Rohit had earlier captained India to the Asia Cup victory last year when Kohli was rested.</p>
      <p>Speaking on the eve of the match on Saturday, Rohit told reporters: "My job as a captain is very simple -- I just want to take the team forward from where Virat has left the team.</p>
      <p>"What I have done at the limited opportunities that I have got is to maintain what Virat has done previously with the team. I am just trying to carry that forward."</p>
