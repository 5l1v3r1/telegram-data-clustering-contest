      <p>Two yellow warnings for rain have been issued in Scotland and are in place until midday.</p>
      <p>Persistent and heavy rains from yesterday and overnight are likely to cause disruption.</p>

      <p>The woman, in her 60s, was killed after a tree fell on her car in Dorset on Saturday, amid gusts of more than 80mph which buffeted parts of the South West.</p>
      <p>The Met Office issued a number of rain and wind warnings across the south of England and Wales on Saturday, while a band of rain moved across northern Scotland.</p>
      <p>A forecaster said the high winds, which saw trains and ferries disrupted, would calm down overnight and into Sunday morning.</p>
      <p>Northern Ireland and western Scotland will be the clearest and driest spots overnight and some areas could see frost on Sunday morning, with temperatures in Belfast falling to five degrees.</p>
      <p>Forecaster Craig Snell said there will "still be areas of rain around" during the day on Sunday, but added: "Winds will not be as strong as today."</p>

      <p>However, any Sunday morning sunshine will give way to showers in the afternoon.</p>
      <p>The Met Office’s Greg Dewhurst said:  “Continuation of heavy rain throughout the day.</p>
      <p>“With the exception of Shetland, here we will see some sunshine through the day.”</p>
      <p>Temperatures will remain average for this time of year with the mercury hitting between 12C and 14C.</p>
      <p>The Met Office said gusts of 83mph were recorded in Plymouth and 82mph in Culdrose, Cornwall, on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The strongest gust of wind recorded was 109mph at the Needles on the Isle of Wight.</p>
