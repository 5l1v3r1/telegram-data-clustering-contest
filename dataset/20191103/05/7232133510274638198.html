      <h3>Bitcoin Price Weekly Analysis (BTC)</h3>
      <p>This past week, there was a slow and steady decline in bitcoin below the $8,400 support against the US Dollar. Moreover, BTC price also traded below the $8,200 support area. Finally, it spiked below the $8,000 support, but remained well above the 100 simple moving average (4-hours).</p>
      <p>A swing low was formed near $8,960 and the price recently started an <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/01/bitcoin-btc-price-trading-near-make-or-break-levels-2/">upward move</a>. There was a break above the $8,100 and $8,200 resistance levels to start a decent increase.</p>
      <p>More importantly, there was a break above a key contracting triangle with resistance near $9,240 on the 4-hours chart of the BTC/USD pair. At the moment, the price is trading near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $10,584 high to $8,960 low.</p>
      <p>If there are more gains, the price could continue to rise towards the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/10/31/bitcoin-btc-price-likely-positioned-for-next-rally/">$9,500 and $9,600 resistance levels</a>. Besides, the main resistance is near the $9,770 level. It represents the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $10,584 high to $8,960 low.</p>
      <p>On the downside, there are many supports between $9,200 and $8,960. If there is a bearish break below the $8,960 swing low, there are chances of a sharp decline. The next key support is near $8,600 and the 100 simple moving average (4-hours).</p>
      <p>Therefore, the $8,500 and $8,600 support levels are likely to play an important role. As long as the price is above the $8,500 support, there are chances of a fresh increase above the $9,500 level.</p>
