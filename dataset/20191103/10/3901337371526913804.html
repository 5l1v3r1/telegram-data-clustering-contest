      <p>The 23-year-old Frenchman has handed Ole Gunnar Solskjaer a much-needed boost with his return from injury, after missing seven matches this season already due to a hamstring strain.</p>
      <p>Starting in the Red Devils’ recent Premier League win over Norwich City, Martial scored a magical goal after linking up smartly with Marcus Rashford, and will now be looking to continue in a similar fashion.</p>
      <p>In a recent interview, the Frenchman discussed his idols, saying that FC Barcelona legend Ronaldinho was a player who made him dream.</p>

      <p>"I would say my favourite players were the Brazilians, Ronaldo and Ronaldinho," he told United’s official website.</p>
      <p>"They were both fantastic players with beautiful movement and grace. They made their matches great to watch.</p>
      <p>"I mostly loved Ronaldinho, because he was a player who could make you dream, with his great big smile on the pitch, with his great technical skills.</p>
      <p>“I think that combination of great technical skills and the terrific goals he could score, it’s that which inspires people."</p>
