      <p>LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) — Bolivian President Evo Morales is rejecting opposition calls for him to resign and says the country should wait for an international audit of Bolivia’s disputed election.</p>
      <p>Morales said on Bolivian radio on Sunday that his opponents want to stage a coup and that he is a target of racism as Bolivia’s first indigenous president.</p>
      <p>Results from the Oct. 20 election show Morales winning a new term, but the opposition alleges fraud. Opposition leaders say they distrust an election audit being carried out by the Organization of American States and they want a new election.</p>
      <p>Tens of thousands of Bolivians rallied Saturday in the city of Santa Cruz, demanding Morales resign by Monday.</p>
      <p>Morales has held the presidency for 14 years and critics say his reelection run violated constitutional term limits.</p>
