      <h1>Trial Back on After Craig Wright Breaks Bitcoin Settlement Agreement</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T10:15:42+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 10:15</time> by <a rel="author">Daniel Kuhn</a></address>
      <p>Australian-born technologist Craig Wright has attested that he cannot finance his court settlement negotiated with the Kleiman estate.</p>
      <p>According to a <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.flsd.521536/gov.uscourts.flsd.521536.290.0.pdf">court document</a> filed in the Southern District of Florida Oct. 30, Wright pulled out of the <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/craig-wright-in-discussions-to-settle-multi-billion-dollar-court-case">settlement agreement</a> in which he would forfeit half his intellectual property and bitcoin mined prior to 2014. With the agreement broken, trial motions are now back on.</p>
      <p>The document was filed by Kleiman’s counsel to set a date to depose an out-of-state witness.</p>
      <p>Ira Kleiman brought the charges against Wright in 2018 on behalf of his deceased brother’s estate. Kleiman alleges Wright manipulated business documents, emails and other correspondence to defraud the estate.</p>
      <p>Wright was sanctioned in late August, after being found in <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/judge-confirms-ruling-craig-wright-to-forfeit-50-of-bitcoin-holdings">contempt of court</a> by Magistrate Judge Bruce E. Reinhart for failing to disclose a complete list of his bitcoin addresses, reportedly amounting to 1.1 million bitcoin.</p>
      <p>During the hearing, Wright claimed his bitcoin was inaccessible due to his former business partner David Kleiman’s death as well as a complicated encryption scheme. The arguments were found to be <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/judge-blasts-craig-wrights-inconsistent-testimony-extremely-speculative-evidence-in-kleiman-trial">inconsistent</a> and in bad faith.</p>
      <p>“These discussions began at Craig’s request and due to the fact that Craig represented he had the means to finance a settlement,” Velvel Freedman, member of the prosecution and partner at Roche Freedman, said in the filing.</p>
      <p>Wright allegedly reneged on the non-binding agreement “without notice.”</p>
      <p>Earlier, just days after the sanction was levied, Wright requested additional time to challenge the judge’s court order due to the approach of <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/craig-wright-aims-to-challenge-court-decision-that-cost-half-his-bitcoins">Hurricane Dorian</a>.</p>
      <p>Kleiman is represented by Kyle Roche and Velvel Freedman of Roche Freedman LLP, while Wright is represented by Rivero Mestre LLP.</p>
      <p>The trial date is set for March 30, 2020.</p>
      <p><b>UPDATE (Nov. 3, 19:00 UTC):</b> The headline of this article has been updated to clarify that a final settlement had not been reached; the parties had simply reached a non-binding agreement that could have led to one.</p>
