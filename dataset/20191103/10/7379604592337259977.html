A Cabinet source said: “If it’s the wrong result we will just kick them out after the election. “A lot of Labour MPs won’t be there on Monday because they’ll be busy campaigning so it gives us a chance to get the right person in.” John Bercow stood down as Speaker last week, and a new one is set to be elected tomorrow. But after the election Tories could force a fresh vote. <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10268177/tories-topple-new-commons-speaker/?utm_term=Autofeed&amp;utm_campaign=sunpoliticstwitter&amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_source=Twitter">https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10268177/tories-topple-new-commons-speaker/?utm_term=Autofeed&amp;utm_campaign=sunpoliticstwitter&amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_source=Twitter</a>echobox=1572749731</li>

He said: “I hope very much she’ll play some supporting role. I don’t know quite what it’ll be just yet — but we have a few ideas in mind.”</li>

That's not ruling it in, not exactly ruling it out either. Britain has already eaten into seven months of the transition period by extending Article 50 repeatedly. That means there's less time to sort out a free trade deal before the end of the transition. The PM said: “We already have tariffs and zero quotas. So the negotiations, in principle, should be extremely simple.”</li>
