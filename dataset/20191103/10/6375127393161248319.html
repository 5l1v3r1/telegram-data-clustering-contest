      <h1>Over 9K Filipinos in take US NCLEX</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T10:10:51+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 10:10</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://journal.com.ph/authors/ryan-ponce-pacpaco" target="_blank">Ryan Ponce Pacpaco</a></address>
      <h3>SOME 9,195 Filipino nurses hoping to practice their profession in America took the United States (US) licensure examination for the first time from January to September this year, the ACTS-OFW Coalition of Organizations said yesterday.</h3>
      <p>“The number is up 30 percent versus the 7,119 Philippine-educated nurses who took America’s eligibility test, or the NCLEX, for the first time in same nine-month period in 2018, without counting repeaters,” said ACTS-OFW chairman Aniceto Bertiz III, a former congressman.</p>
      <p>Citing U.S. National Council of State Boards of Nursing Inc. (NCSBN) figures released on Oct. 30, Bertiz said a total of 1,064 Indians, 805 Puerto Ricans, 638 South Koreans and 623 Nigerians also took the NCLEX for the first time from January to September.</p>
      <p>The U.S. NCSBN administers the NCLEX for registered nurse (RN). The exam, which costs $200 (P10,200), is the final step in the U.S. nurse licensure process.</p>
      <p>The number of foreign-educated nurses taking the NCLEX for the first time is considered a reliable indicator as to how many of them are trying to enter the profession in America.</p>
      <p>Jamaicans, Canadians and Cubans also compete with Filipinos in America’s nursing labor market, according to Bertiz.</p>
      <p>Bertiz welcomed the recent Supreme Court ruling which upheld the validity of a 2002 law that pegged at P30,531 (Salary Grade 15) the monthly base pay of nurses employed by the Philippine government – 48 percent higher than the P20,754 (Salary Grade 11) they are currently receiving.</p>
      <p>However, Bertiz  said the considerably improved starting pay is not expected to hold back Filipino nurses from seeking “vastly superior standards of living overseas, especially in North America.”</p>
      <p>“We have many young, upwardly-mobile nurses and other health professionals who really want to live and work overseas, mainly in America and Canada,” Bertiz, a former member of Congress, said.</p>
      <p>Bertiz also pointed out that the P30,531 monthly base pay, when annualized, amounts to only P396,903, to include the 13th month pay.</p>
      <p>“The P396,903 is roughly equal to just 10 percent of the P3.65 million (or $71,730) annual median pay of nurses in America,” Bertiz said.</p>
