      <p>The Ant’s corner will remain in the realm of Peyton Reed, from Marvel’s Cinematic Universe. The director helmed 2015’s <i>Ant-Man </i>and 2018’s <i>Ant-Man and the Wasp. </i>He has now signed on to helm a third <i>Ant-Man</i> movie,<i> </i>according to an exclusive by the<i> Hollywood Reporter.</i></p>
      <p>Paul Rudd shall return as Scott Lang, to reenact the heist-hearting hero with the power of petiteness in the new installment. The role will official mark his fifth time as the character, aside any other surprise appearances.</p>
      <p>As off now, the plot details are being  hidden with the release details also remaining under the carpet.</p>
      <p>However, sources have confirmed the shooting plans, addressing the end of 2020 or the beginning of 2021 for the initiation of the film, while the release is expected by 2022.</p>
      <p>According to <i>Hollywood Reporter</i>, the sequels of <i>Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness </i>and<i> Thor: Love and Thunder </i>will shoot before <i>Ant-Man 3.  </i></p>

      <p>He was brought into the Marvel universe when, late in the movie’s development process, he replaced Edgar Wright to helm <i>Ant-Man</i>. The movie grossed $519.3 million. The sequel, which Reed was more involved with, grew to a $622.6 million gross.</p>
