      <p>High winds and heavy rains from an extremely strong <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/categories/weather.html">weather</a> system that moved in from the Atlantic has battered much of the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/United-Kingdom.html">United Kingdom</a> and Ireland.</p>
      <p>This <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/subjects/storms-141021132021792.html">storm</a>, that got some of its energy from the remnants of Hurricane Pablo, brought destructive winds to much of southwestern England on Saturday morning.</p>
      <p>The port city of Plymouth, located on the southwestern coast of England, received a peak gust of 133 kilometres (83 miles) per hour, while just down the coast the winds at Royal Naval Air Station at Culdrose hit 132km/h (82 miles/h).</p>
      <p>The winds and rain also caused problems for travellers - at London Heathrow Airport on Saturday, 265 flights were delayed.</p>
      <p>Thousands of people in parts of Cornwall and North Devon were also left without electricity after trees fell on power lines.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, train services were discontinued between Newquay and Par when the ground below the tracks became unstable due to the heavy rain.</p>
      <p>The UK met office had issued yellow warnings for wind and rain through Saturday evening for parts of Wales and England.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, the storm's fury began pounding <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/France.html">France</a> with even stronger winds. In Cap Ferret, just off the coast of Bordeaux, a wind gust topped out at 162km/h (101 miles/h), equivalent to a category 2 hurricane.</p>
      <p>The strong winds will continue moving east into the Mediterranean Sea and then across parts of Italy early on Monday morning.</p>
      <p>Heavy rain will also accompany these winds on Monday with accumulations well over 100mm. The risk for localised flash flooding will be a high concern between Rome and Naples.</p>
      <p>The flood threat will then shift across the Adriatic Sea into Montenegro on Tuesday.</p>
