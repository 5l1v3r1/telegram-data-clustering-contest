Not to mention the new lyrics. Altogether now, “ba ba booo… ee… around.” Until next week…</li>

Here's what went down: Coronation Street's Victoria Ekanoye was voted off the show, despite earning praise for her big Beyoncé number. Ex-EastEnders star Jonny Labey was first to perform, but left the show tonight. Martin Bashir forgot his words, but was saved. Simon Cowell refused to cast his vote as the decision reached deadlock, deferring to the public vote instead. Try Star's tribute to the England rugby team earned them a free pass. Louis gave Kevin McHale his safe seat. Simon was so impressed by No Love Lost that he saved them from the public vote. Dermot had a great night, baiting the judges and generally going rogue with the Love Island supporters. Nine acts remain and with the competition wide open they'll be singing for survival next week.</li>

And that word is: GUTTED.</li>

Simon gave his free pass to No Love Lost, after their Charles &amp; Eddie-fuelled performance. Louis made sure Kevin McHale was safe from the public vote after he sang Dance Monkey, flanked by a load of legs. And after Try Star brought the house down in a very different way to last week, Nicole kept them safe because they sang Swing Low, Sweet Chariot as a tribute to the England rugby team. But that left her acts at risk. Although Nicole heaped praise on Victoria Ekanoye for her gutsy performance of Beyoncé's Why Don't You Love Me? it wasn't enough to save the soap star.</li>

Stripped down in styling and song, she performed the emotional ballad that she wrote about her <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10265117/x-factor-celebrity-megan-mckenna-emotional-song-grandad/">late grandad</a>. Stronger was a hit with the judges as she once again proved she's a force to be reckoned with.</li>
