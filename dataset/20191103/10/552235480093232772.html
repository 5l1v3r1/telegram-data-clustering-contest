      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steven-naismith">Steven Naismith</a> could feature for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hearts-fc">Hearts</a> off the bench as they take on Rangers in the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/betfred-league-cup">Betfred Cup</a> semi-final.</p>
      <p>The striker is working to return from the hamstring problem which has sidelined him for most of the season.</p>
      <p>Jamie Walker and Glenn Whelan returned from the bench in midweek and have come through their comebacks without problems, while Peter Haring has also done some training as he fights his way back from a groin issue.</p>
      <p>Loic Damour is suspended while Jake Mulraney (ankle), Craig Halkett (knee), John Souttar (ankle), Ben Garuccio (knee) and Conor Washington (hamstring) remain on the sidelines.</p>
      <p>Austin MacPhee has taken interim charge of the Jambos after Craig Levein was relieved of his duties on Thursday night.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> , meanwhile, are expected to welcome back keeper Allan McGregor from injury.</p>
