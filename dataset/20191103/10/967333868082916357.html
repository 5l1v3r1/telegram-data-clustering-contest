      <h1>Trump 'Needs to Tweet Like We Need to Eat': Kellyanne Conway Defends POTUS’s Twitter Habits</h1>
      <h2>US President Donald Trump has used social media like no other American president, wielding it as a springboard to launch policy moves and a cudgel against critics.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T10:56:23+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 10:56</time> by <a rel="author">by Svetlana Ekimenko</a></address>
      <blockquote>White House counsellor Kellyanne Conway has defended President Donald Trump’s Twitter habits in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/11/02/us/politics/trump-twitter-presidency.html">an interview</a> with <i>The New York Times.</i><br/>“He needs to tweet like we need to eat,” said Conway.</blockquote>
      <p><i>The New York Times</i> embarked on a study of more than 11,000 tweets by Donald Trump - a President who has used social media like no other - scrutinising the accounts he follows and interviewing administration officials, lawmakers, Twitter executives and ordinary Americans “caught up” in his tweets.</p>
      <p>According to the paper’s story, published on 2 November, in more than half of them, <a href="https://sputniknews.com/viral/201910311077184960-photos-twitter-explodes-after-trump-posts-doctored-image-of-dog-wounded-in-baghdadi-raid/">Trump used the platform</a> to lambaste someone or something.</p>
      <p>Trump has “attacked” at least 630 people and things in 5,889 tweets since taking office, according to the Times.</p>
      <p>Other tweets, claims the outlet, referred to “conspiracy theories”, including 40 tweets about voter fraud and a “rigged” electoral system.</p>
      <p>Early in Trump’s presidency, top aides discussed asking Twitter to impose a 15-minute delay on his account, similar to the five-second naughty-word system used by television networks, according to the publication.</p>
      <p>However, a former White House official is cited as saying they abandoned the idea since the president worried it would make his tweets irrelevant.</p>
      <p>Kellyanne Conway’s defence of Donald Trump’s Twitter habits sparked a prompt response from social media users, with some applauding his use of the platform:</p>

      <p>​Other twitter users took a different stance, pointing out that Trump’s tweeting was a form of “addiction”:</p>

      <p>​US President Donald Trump has consistently touted his Twitter account’s influence on mainstream media.</p>
      <p>Speaking to conservative social media personalities at a White House conference, he said:</p>
      <blockquote>“Boom. I press it, and, within two seconds, 'We have breaking news,”' the Times noted.</blockquote>
      <p>However, the president’s Twitter habits have also <a href="https://sputniknews.com/analysis/201911011077200578-twitters-political-ad-ban-will-pour-political-money-into-the-pockets-of-media-pundits---journo-/">brought attention to the social media platform’s policies</a>, with some accusing Trump of having violated the platform’s rules.</p>
      <p>Twitter announced it took “newsworthiness” into account when deciding whether to remove a post that violated its policies.</p>
      <p>In September 2017, Trump tweeted that North Korea “won’t be around much longer!” as tensions escalated, sparking fears of a possible military conflict between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.</p>
      <p>North Korea’s foreign minister responded at the time by saying Trump’s post was a “clear declaration of war”.</p>
      <p>Twitter at the time stated it had to hold all accounts, including Trump’s, to the “same rules,” but that “among the considerations is 'newsworthiness' and '<a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/enforcement-philosophy">whether a Tweet is of public interest.'</a>”</p>
