      <p>The British Labour Party's John McDonnell has said the Heathrow Airport expansion could be scrapped under Labour's plans to tackle the climate crisis.</p>
      <p>The shadow chancellor said the controversial plans for a third runway may be blocked if the party wins the UK's General Election as part of its efforts to make the nation carbon-neutral by 2030.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, he told the BBC’s The Andrew Marr Show: “We set ourselves criteria, one of which was environmental impact, the other was also economic impact and social impact.</p>
      <p>“On the current criteria, we’ve said very clearly, Heathrow expansion doesn’t qualify.”</p>
      <blockquote>Everything I said we would do we are doing in terms of the Labour Party in terms of eradicating anti-Semitism from the party</blockquote>
      <p>Pressed if Labour would cancel the extension, he said: “At the moment it does not qualify based on the criteria we set out.”</p>
      <p>Other expansions across the country including in Manchester would also be considered under the criteria, he said.</p>
      <p>Parliament gave the go-ahead last year for the expansion of the London airport, which published its “masterplan” in June to build a third runway by 2026.</p>
      <p>Mr McDonnell also sought to reassure the Jewish community that Labour was trying to eradicate anti-Semitism after being shown three Jewish newspapers with highly-critical headlines.</p>
      <p>“I’m so saddened by this. I just want to reassure them that we’re doing everything we can,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Everything I said we would do we are doing in terms of the Labour Party in terms of eradicating anti-Semitism from the party.”</p>
      <p>Mr McDonnell also expressed optimism over Labour’s chances in the December 12 election despite polls putting them far behind the Tories.</p>
      <p>Asked if it feels like a winning campaign, he said: “It does actually. I think the polls are coming our way.</p>
      <p>“I think they are beginning to move in our direction. We know how far we are behind in the polls, not as far as in 2017.”</p>
