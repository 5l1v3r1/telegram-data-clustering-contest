      <h1>Nate Diaz shows off two gruesome cuts after UFC 244 fight with Jorge Masvidal was stopped</h1>
      <h2>Diaz was behind on all three scorecards when the doctor stepped in to bring a halt to the fight</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T13:59:54+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 13:59</time> by <a rel="author">Martin Domin, https://www.facebook.com/mirrorfighting</a></address>
      <p>Nate Diaz shrugged off two gruesome cuts around his eye to demand a rematch with Jorge Masvidal.</p>
      <p>Diaz was well behind on the judges scorecards when the cageside doctor brought a halt to his fight with Masvidal after three rounds at UFC 244.</p>
      <p>That saw Masvidal crowned the Baddest Motherf***** by Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson while Diaz had stitches to both injuries.</p>
      <p>And the Stockton native called on the UFC to order an immediate rematch.</p>
      <p>He said: "If you’re the baddest motherf***** you're going to take that as a win?</p>
      <p>"It’s just like when I fought Conor [McGregor]. It was a win, and it was fair game, but I wasn’t finished. He knows I wasn’t finished. I was ready to rock.</p>

      <p>"That’s my plan, that’s my next move; I would love to run it back, that’s the only thing I want to do. And that’s my full intention for now.</p>
      <p>“But I can already see the f***ery coming. I know how this game works. I gave all the rematches and made names for all these people."</p>
      <p>But Diaz's hopes of a second shot at Masvidal were dashed by UFC president Dana White who performed a U-turn in admitting the doctor was right to stop the fight.</p>
      <p>Initially he said the five-round clash should have been allowed to continue but later admitted: "Cuts that big are always a problem.</p>
      <p>"When it first got stopped, I was like, 'You guys didn’t stop the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tyson-fury">Tyson Fury</a> fight (against Otto Walin)'.</p>

      <p>"But then as I went back and talked with Nate Diaz and looked at Nate Diaz’s face... the fight probably should have been stopped.</p>
      <p>"Could Nate Diaz keep going? Yes, that’s why we love Nate Diaz. But it probably should have been stopped."</p>
      <p>White added: “No, [the rematch] doesn’t interest me right away.</p>
      <p>"I think that I got asked a couple of questions tonight: ‘Diaz comes on in the later rounds. If this fight had gone later, would they have stopped it?’</p>
      <p>"But it didn’t. It got stopped with cuts and Masvidal looked very dominant. And he looked good."</p>
