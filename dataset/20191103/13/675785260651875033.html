      <h1>Couple think they've rescued missing pet - turns out they stole stranger's cat</h1>
      <h2>A rescue operation to find Lentil the cat went downhill after a couple identified the wrong pet and put it in their car</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T13:47:54+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 13:47</time> by <a rel="author">Luke Matthews, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/luke-matthews/</a></address>
      <p>A well-meaning couple who sprang into action to help find their friend's missing cat returned home a little red faced after an embarrassing case of mistaken identity.</p>
      <p>Owner Sophie Johnson posted on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> urging people in Prestonpans, Scotland, to keep an eye out for her missing mog Lentil, along with a lovely picture of her adorable 'wee scone'.</p>
      <p>After word got back to Sophie that little Lentil had been spotted at a new housing development looking 'really muddy', she appealed for her friends to head over and have a look as she was unable to get there herself.</p>
      <p>Enter <a href="https://twitter.com/lauzyfaulks/status/1190332858604367872?s=20">Lauren Faulkner</a> and Charlie Allan.</p>

      <p>The couple went out to track down the feline and it didn't take long for them to message Sophie with the news she was desperate to hear.</p>
      <p>"MATE WE'VE F***ING GOT HIM" - alongside a picture of what they <i>thought</i> to be Lentil, sitting contently in the passenger seat of the car, ready to be reunited with his owner.</p>
      <p>A relieved Sophie replied to say she was 'shaking' and 'couldn't believe it'.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately for everyone involved, the cat Lauren and Charlie had buckled up in their car wasn't Lentil at all.</p>
      <p>Before they could drive away and place the animal into the arms of a human it had never laid eyes on before, a neighbour ran out to tell the couple the cat had been living at the development for a year.</p>

      <p>Charlie broke the bad news to Sophie to say they were 'embarrassed' having 'stole the wrong cat' and would continue the search.</p>
      <p>But the bizarre story doesn't end there.</p>
      <p>A post then appeared on a local Facebook group, saying: "Someone just tried to steal our Railey ragdoll cat. Luckily to our wonderful neighbours it was prevented.</p>
      <p>"We are aware of a missing cat who looks a little like ours and we are sorry for the owner's loss but turning up to someone's home and trying to steal an animal is an appalling and cowardly act."</p>
      <p>When the post got back to Lauren, she wrote on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> : "A mean we didny run about in f***ing balaclavas nor get wrestled to ground whilst trying to abduct the cat, some **** went thats no the right cat btw and I let it oot n we aw laughed.</p>
      <p>"Everyone lock your cats up we are clearly very dangerous."</p>
      <p>After all that drama, Lentil is still missing so please keep a look out for him if you're in Prestonpans.</p>
