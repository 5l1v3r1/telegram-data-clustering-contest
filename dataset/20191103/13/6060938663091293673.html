      <p>SHENZHEN (China): <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Ashleigh-Barty">Ashleigh Barty</a> finished the season in style by beating defending champion <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Elina-Svitolina">Elina Svitolina</a> 6-4, 6-3 to add the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/WTA-Finals">WTA Finals</a> title to her end-of-year world number one ranking on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Barty, who became the first Australian to top the WTA rankings at the end of the year since they were introduced in 1975, capped a stellar season in Shenzhen having also won the French Open at Roland Garros in June.</p>
      <p>Barty became the first Australian to win the WTA Finals since Evonne Goolagong Cawley claimed her second title in 1976.</p>
      <p>"It's been the most incredible year for me," said Barty, who pocketed a record $4.42 million for her victory in Shenzhen, where the tournament was being held for the first time as part of a 10-year residency.</p>
      <p>"It's been an incredible new era in women's <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/tennis">tennis</a> and to play in front of this spectacular crowd has been amazing."</p>
      <p>There was little between the pair until the penultimate game of the first set when Barty fended off a break point before putting Svitolina's serve under pressure in the following game.</p>
      <p>The Australian took the opener when she converted a break point at the third time of asking, punishing Svitolina's second serve with a firm forehand.</p>
      <p>The tension increased in the second set as neither player was able to hold serve consistently.</p>
      <p>Svitolina broke early to give herself a lifeline, only for Barty to win the next three games -- including two breaks of serve. Yet another slip-up on her own serve allowed Svitolina back into the set.</p>
      <p>Barty broke yet again, however, claiming the eighth game of the set when she converted her third break point as Svitolina pulled a shot wide and secured her fourth title of the season with a hold to love in the next game.</p>
      <p>Hungary's Timea Babos won the doubles title for the third year in a row, partnering with Kristina Mladenovic from France to see off Barbora Strycova and Hsieh Su-wei 6-1, 6-3 in the final.</p>
      <p>"We played some great tennis," said Babos. "There was no-one out there on this tournament who could beat us. That's really amazing.</p>
      <p>"Of course, to share it with Kiki, to play on the biggest stage with her, to get the title together, it's an incredible story.</p>
      <p>"I'm just really, really happy to lift that trophy again."</p>
