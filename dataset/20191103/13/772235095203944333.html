      <p>It's official, the next-generation <b>BMW 2 Series coupe</b> will stick with the rear-wheel drive layout.</p>
      <p>The much-rumoured decision was confirmed by Gernot Stuhl, product manager of the <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/bmw/2-series/">2 Series</a> range, in an interview with <i><a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/next-bmw-m2-will-stay-rear-wheel-drive">Autocar</a></i>.</p>
      <p>With the launch of its third generation, the <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/bmw/1-series/">1 Series</a> hatch shifted from a rear-wheel drive setup to the UKL front- and all-wheel drive platform used by the <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/bmw/x1/">X1</a>, <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/bmw/x2/">X2</a> and the entire <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/mini/">Mini</a> range.</p>
      <p>According to Stuhl, market research has shown 1 Series buyers didn't base their purchase on the drivetrain layout, but this was an important consideration for two-door 2 Series owners.</p>
      <p>It won't be the first time the 2 Series name has been used on models using vastly different architectures.</p>
      <p>Practically since its inception, the 2 Series range has been split across two vastly different platforms, with the front-wheel drive <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/tag/bmw-2-series-active-tourer/">2 Series Active Tourer</a> and <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/tag/bmw-2-series-gran-tourer/">Gran Tourer</a> placing a premium on space efficiency and passenger comfort, while the rear-wheel drive two-door 2 Series coupe and convertible had a much greater focus on driver enjoyment.</p>
      <p>The company recently added the front- and all-wheel drive four-door <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/tag/bmw-2-series-gran-coupe/">2 Series Gran Coupe</a> to the company's lineup.</p>
      <p>As <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/803744/bmw-m-front-wheel-drive/">we reported</a> last week, BMW won't produce full-blown M variants for models based on a front-wheel drive architecture.</p>
