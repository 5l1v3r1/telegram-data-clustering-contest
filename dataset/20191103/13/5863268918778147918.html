      <p>He said Pakistan’s efforts for regional peace and security, arms reduction, and climate change would continue.</p>
      <p>Mr Akram, yesterday, took charge of Pakistan’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations in New York, replacing Maleeha Lodhi, who completed her tenure.</p>
      <p>Mr Akram, being a well-known figure in diplomatic circles, has served as Pakistan’s ambassador to the UN previously as well, holding the office for six years between 2002 and 2008.</p>
