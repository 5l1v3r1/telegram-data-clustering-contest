      <p>"At first there was two other girls that live down the road and they were helping, trying to get the passenger out of the car.</p>
      <p>"There was one woman in the passenger seat they got her out of the car and sat her down on the pavement by the shop and they got her a glass of water - she was in a panic."</p>
      <p>He added: "There was a resident saying her room was shaking.</p>
      <p>"There were about 60/70 people last night. All crowding.</p>

      <p>"I didn’t want to look to be honest, it was horrible.</p>
