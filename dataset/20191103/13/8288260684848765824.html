      <h1>Chris Kamara accidentally lets slip Strictly result spoiler in Alex Scott interview</h1>
      <h2>Strictly Come Dancing airs each Saturday evening, and also tapes its results show the same night</h2>

      <p>Chris Kamara has left Strictly viewers with raised eyebrows today - after he appeared to "leak" the results of the show.</p>
      <p>The Sky Sports pundit, who is routinely seen on Soccer Saturday and Goals on Sunday, appeared to reveal the results of Sunday's show.</p>
      <p>Strictly Come Dancing airs each Saturday evening, and also tapes its results show the same night.</p>
      <p>The results are then aired on Sunday nights on BBC One meaning, occasionally, things leak and accidentally slip out from audience members and those in the "know".</p>
      <p>Today, Kammy welcomed current Strictly contestant Alex Scott, the former Arsenal star, onto Goals on Sunday.</p>

      <p>The Sky Sports star was interviewing Alex, who is currently partnered with Neil Jones on Strictly.</p>
      <p>Alex was discussing her stint on the show, which has seen her partner with Kevin Clifton for two weeks running, after Neil suffered a horror injury during training and rehearsals.</p>
      <p>Alex was forced to dodge a series of tricky questions from Kammy on Goals on Sunday.</p>
      <p>He asked: "What's the dance next weekend?".</p>
      <p>"Well... it's the results show tonight so, I don't know yet," Alex laughed.</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>Kamara responded: "Right."</p>
      <p>"From here, I go there [to the studio]," Alex giggled, and Kammy burst out laughing.</p>
