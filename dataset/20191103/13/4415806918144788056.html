      <h1>West Ham in need of a reality check after Newcastle defeat – Robert Snodgrass</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T13:57:00+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 13:57</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/press-association/" target="_blank">By Press Association</a></address>
      <p>Robert Snodgrass hopes West Ham’s 3-2 home defeat by Newcastle is the “reality check” the team need.</p>
      <p>The Hammers found themselves 3-0 down inside an hour thanks to goals from Ciaran Clark, Federico Fernandez and Jonjo Shelvey.</p>
      <p>They staged a belated comeback through Fabian Balbuena and Snodgrass, but the scoreline could not mask a desperately poor display from Manuel Pellegrini’s side, who have now gone six games without a win.</p>
      <p>“It was a bad result and a performance that wasn’t West Ham-like,” said midfielder Snodgrass.</p>
      <p>“I think we need to have a reality check and realise that we need to start getting points on the board if we want to climb up the table.</p>
      <p>“We need to be solid and resolute. In the first half we could have been four or five down. It’s very disappointing.</p>
      <p>“We can’t give teams three goals to start before we come into it. I just think we need to sit back, watch it and we need to be better. It’s as simple as that.”</p>
      <p>Newcastle’s front three of Miguel Almiron, Allan Saint-Maximin and Joelinton failed to find the net again, but their pace and power worried West Ham throughout.</p>
      <p>Manager Steve Bruce said: “I’ve said before it takes time, for the lads who’ve come into the team it’s not easy to adapt to it.</p>
      <p>“It was only Allan’s fourth game and he, Almiron and Joe were terrific in their work.</p>
      <p>“If they can play like that and we get the other side right we’ll be OK. We were a threat and we caused them all sorts of problems.</p>
      <p>“If I’m being critical we missed too many opportunities. They don’t come around that often. Almiron was terrific. When he scores, which he will do, we’ll see an even better player.”</p>
