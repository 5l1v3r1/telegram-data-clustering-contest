      <h1>James Tavernier in Rangers memory lapse as captain cracks up over Alfredo Morelos gaffe</h1>
      <h2>The defender was full of praise for his team-mate but couldn't quite recall his performance against Hearts.</h2>

      <p>Rangers captain James Tavernier hailed the contribution of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/alfredo-morelos">Alfredo Morelos</a> after reaching the Betfred Cup Final - but forgot about his second goal.</p>
      <p>Filip Helander opened the scoring for Steven Gerrard's side just before the break against Hearts, with the Colombian striker hitting a double to set up a final against <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> .</p>
      <p>Speaking after the match <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/james-tavernier">Tavernier</a> was full of praise for Morelos, but the fact his team-mate had scored twice seemed to slip his mind.</p>
      <p>The captain told <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> TV: "You go into the second half leading and it's a matter of controlling the game and breaking them down.</p>
      <p>"We know we're going to create opportunities and we did second half.</p>
      <p>"Alfredo and... Fil? No, he was first half... Oh yeah, he (Morelos) got two. Alfredo got two second half!</p>
      <p>"He came up with the goods and put us over the line.</p>
      <p>"He's been terrific for us from the start of the season.</p>
      <p>"He's really put his head down and he's been terrific. He had some problems last season with his discipline but he's shown already how he's matured and he's a real big asset for us."</p>
