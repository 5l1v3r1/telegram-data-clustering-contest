      <p>Police said two were killed in a crash between a car and a pickup truck that closed 1st Avenue between Seymour Street and Nicola Street.</p>
      <p>“Due to the severity of this collision, our investigation could take most of the day,” says RCMP Cpl. Jodi Shelkie. “We thank motorists for avoiding this area and taking alternate routes.”</p>
