      <p>The Popeyes chicken sandwich is all the rage this weekend, as it was announced that the hot item was finally back in retail locations on Sunday.</p>
      <p>And the viral sensation is so hot, that apparently it’s even making an impact on the NFL world.</p>
      <p>Texans quarterback Deshaun Watson put together a great performance in Sunday’s 26-3 win over the Jaguars, having completed 22 of 28 passes, with two touchdowns, and no turnovers.</p>
      <p>What fueled him in the big performance? It was the Popeyes chicken sandwich, apparently, according to Watson himself.</p>

      <p>Vikings receiver Stefon Diggs gave it some love as well, with his cleats.</p>

      <p>It’s a magical sandwich, apparently, and Popeyes had to be happy that Watson gave it some shine on live TV.</p>
