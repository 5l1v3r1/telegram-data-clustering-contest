      <p>Dog owners could be forced to pay a new tax in a bid to stop people dumping unwanted animals and to encourage responsible ownership.</p>
      <p>The tax would be similar to the old-style dog licences which were scrapped in 1987.</p>
      <p>Academics from Middlesex University have been drafted in to find ways to help prevent dog dumping and other forms of animal abandonment.</p>
      <p>Thousands of puppies which are bought as Christmas gifts are abandoned on the streets every year.</p>
      <p>The study, due to be completed by the end of the year, was introduced by Junior Environment Minister, Zac Goldsmith.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Costing just 37p, the dog license was scrapped because it proved impossible to enforce.</p>
      <p>The RSPCA backed proposals to reintroduce the licence in 2010. </p>
      <p>Dr Samantha Gaines, the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/sspca">animal charity’s</a> dog welfare expert, said: “The RSPCA has long held the view that the reintroduction of a dog licensing scheme would be beneficial to managing the social and animal problems associated with dog ownership. </p>
      <p>“A licensing scheme has the potential to generate money that could be used to help improve dog welfare and tackle the issues around dog ownership, including anti-social behaviour involving dogs, dog bite incidents, stray dogs, population issues, as well as dog health and welfare.” </p>
      <p>In the Netherlands, many dog owners have to pay as much as £100 per pet dog as part of their license scheme. </p>
      <p>In Canada, money made from the Responsible <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/pets">Pet</a> Ownership Bylaw in Calgary is used to deliver education, public awareness and dog safety services.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Ed Hayes, public affairs and policy manager at The Kennel Club, said: “Certainly, more needs to be done to tackle irresponsible dog owners in this country, but it’s misguided to believe that dog licensing or a similar annual ‘dog tax’ would be a solution. </p>
      <p>“Dog licensing is a flawed model. It has been tried and consequently scrapped by Defra in the past as it was neither enforceable nor effective. </p>
      <p>“Any annual tax would only impact on and penalise the responsible <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/dogs">dog</a> owner, whilst the irresponsible would continue to flout the law."</p>
