      <p>Police are investigating after a 97-year-old woman was found dead in her Fife home.</p>
      <p>Detectives have refused to rule out foul play as they continue with forensic examinations at her house in the village of Kinglassie.</p>
      <p>The pensioner, who lived alone, was discovered after a relative raised concerns with <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/police">Police</a> Scotland when the woman failed to make any contact for several days.</p>
      <p>Officers forced their way into the house on the edge of the village on Friday, October 25, and found her body.</p>
      <p>It's understood an initial post mortem has already been carried out and police are carrying out further examinations.</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>The case has not yet been passed to the Major Investigation Team, which probes murders and other suspicious deaths.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/police-scotland">Police</a> officers have remained stationed outside the bungalow since the grim find.</p>
      <p>Neighbours have also been spoken to as part of the investigation.</p>
      <p>A police spokeswoman said: "Following a report of concern for a person, we attended an address on West End, Kinglassie, around 11.10am on Friday, 25th October.</p>
      <p>"A 97-year-old woman was found dead within the property and her death is currently being treated as unexplained pending further enquiries."</p>
