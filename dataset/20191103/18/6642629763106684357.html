      <p><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/bangladesh.html">Bangladesh</a> government has called for a migrant worker's repatriation from <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/saudi-arabia.html">Saudi Arabia</a> after her video alleging sexual abuse highlighted the exploitation faced by Asians working abroad.</p>
      <p>In a Facebook <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuawVYtXjYQ">video</a> which has been shared thousands of times and prompted protests in Dhaka against workers' conditions, Sumi Akter alleged "merciless sexual assaults" by her Saudi employers.</p>
      <p>"I perhaps won't live longer. Please save me. They locked me up for 15 days and barely gave me any food. They burned my hands with hot oil," the 25-year-old said.</p>

      <p>On Sunday, the government called on the state-run manpower exporting agency to bring Akter back home "as soon as possible".</p>
      <p>Her husband Sirajul Islam told AFP news agency he had been "trying to get her back but couldn't".</p>
      <p>Since 1991, some 300,000 Bangladeshi women have travelled to the Gulf nation for work, according to the ministry of expatriates' welfare.</p>
      <p>Those workers account for the largest amount of remittance sent back to Bangladesh.</p>
      <p>Government spokesman Atiqur Rahman said Dhaka would crack down on rogue recruitment firms amid allegations that they abused female workers and sold them to other brokers.</p>
      <p>Foreign Minister AK Abdul Momen had said on Thursday the government would not ban women from going to Saudi Arabia for work.</p>
      <p>"Saudi Arabia admitted some people are being victimised. But that is happening for a few handfuls of people. The Saudi government isn't making them victims," he told reporters.</p>
      <p>Akter's video comes after the body of migrant worker Nazma Begum was repatriated in late October.</p>
      <p>The 42-year-old Begum had called her son Rajib Hossain repeatedly before her death, alleging torture and asking to be rescued, Hossain told AFP, adding that she died of an untreated illness.</p>
      <p>Both women said they were promised hospital janitor jobs but were tricked into being household maids.</p>
      <p>Millions of Asians travel to the Gulf to work, according to Bangladesh's government, and human rights groups say many suffer exploitation and abuses with no channels for redress.</p>
      <p>Last month, Bangladeshi migrant rights group Ovibashi Karmi Unnayan Program said 61 percent of 110 women they interviewed who returned home, many from Saudi Arabia, claimed they were physically abused.</p>
      <p>Some 14 percent said they were sexually abused, the group added.</p>
      <p>Dhaka-based BRAC, one of the world's largest charities, said this year alone, the bodies of 48 female workers were brought back from Saudi Arabia.</p>
