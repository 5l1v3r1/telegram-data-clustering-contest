      <h3>Top two-wheeler manufacturers including KTM, BMW Motorrad, Triumph and Suzuki will showcase their latest motorcycle at the 2019 EICMA Motorcycle show</h3>

      <p>
        <b>Here is the list of seven bikes that will be showcased at the upcoming EICMA Motorcycle show.</b>
      </p>
      <h4>1. KTM 390 Adventure</h4>
      <p>The excitement levels were quite high surrounding the unveiling of the KTM 390 Adventure at the EICMA Motorcycle show last year. Unfortunately, things did not go according to plan. However, KTM will not disappoint us this year and will finally take the covers off their much-awaited 390 Adventure at the EICMA Motorcycle show.</p>
      <p>The KTM 390 Adventure uses 390 Duke platform. It will feature a higher ground clearance and an adjustable upside-down telescopic suspension setup at the front and a preload-adjustable monoshock setup at the rear with longer wheel travel.</p>

      <p>The 390 Adventure will also feature an offroad spec tyres that will add some offroading capability to the motorcycle. Few reports state that the motorcycle will be offered in two variants. The higher-spec variant will be fitted with larger spoke wheels and few additional goodies while the lower-spec motorcycle will feature standard alloy wheels.</p>
      <p>The upcoming 390 Adventure will likely be powered by the same 373cc, single-cylinder, liquid-cooled, fuel-injected engine that will be available in a different state of tune.The motorcycle will depend on a disc brakes on both ends to bring it to a halt. A dual-channel ABS will also be offered as standard for the safety of the rider.</p>
      <h4>2. KTM 1290 Super Duke R</h4>

      <p>Expect the KTM 1290 Super Duke R to feature an orange trellis frame and single-sided swingarm. It will likely also be powered by a larger capacity V-twin engine that will produce more power and torque than the current unit. The motorcycle will likely also use a WP upside-down suspension setup at the front and a mono-shock setup at the rear.</p>
      <p>There is a fair chance that the upcoming Streetfighter will also feature lighter carbon fibre panels that will help reduce the kerb weight of the motorcycle. Once launched the KTM 1290 Super Duke R will rival directly against the recently unveiled Ducati Streetfighter V4 and the Kawasaki Z H2.</p>
      <h4>3. 2020 KTM RC 390</h4>
      <p>The test mule of the next generation RC 390 was spotted a couple of times while testing.
