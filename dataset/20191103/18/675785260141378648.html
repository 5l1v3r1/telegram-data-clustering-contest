      <h1>Brescia coach praises Mario Balotelli for reaction after racist abuse by Verona fans</h1>
      <h2>Balotelli kicked the ball into the crowd during the second half of the Serie A clash, with the game being temporarily halted</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T18:09:12+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 18:09</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Richards, https://www.facebook.com/AARichards/</a></address>
      <p>Brescia boss Eugenio Corini praised <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/mario-balotelli">Mario Balotelli</a> after the striker's reaction to suffering racist abuse on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Balotelli, the ex-Liverpool and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> forward, was left angered by chants and kicked the ball into the crowd.</p>
      <p>Balotelli threatened to walk off the field, but was convinced to remain by his teammates and opponents, who consoled him on the field.</p>
      <p>Several Brescia players told the referee Maurizio Mariani, that they had heard the abuse, and Mariani halted the game as part of the anti-racism protocol.</p>
      <p>A message was read out to fans over the stadium PA and Balotelli completed the game, scoring late on as Brescia fell to a 2-1 defeat.</p>

      <p>But Balotelli departed the field at full-time visibly upset, covering his face.</p>
      <p>Speaking at his post-match press conference, Corini said: “Mario is a good lad. He heard something from the stands and his teammates did well to reassure him.</p>
      <p>"Then the game continued and he was good and although he was hit emotionally, he continued to play.</p>
      <p>"The referee also read the situation well by temporarily suspending the game.</p>
      <p>"From there on, the match became more difficult and it was played in a strange atmosphere, but we thought we’d done enough to balance it out."</p>

      <p>Verona boss Ivan Juric claimed not to have heard any abuse, and labelled anyone it "a lie" that there had been racism at the Bentegodi.</p>
      <p>"I don't know what set Balotelli off, you have to ask him.</p>
      <p>“I am not afraid to say there were no racist chants today. They might’ve jeered and mocked the great player, but there was nothing there. Nothing.</p>
      <p>“I’ve been called ‘s***** gypsy’ many times and Italy is moving towards this general idea of blaming foreigners for everything, but this was not the case today.</p>
      <p>“You can ask him, there was nothing there. I am disgusted by racist abuse and I will be the first to condemn it when it happens, but this was not it.</p>
      <p>“They provoked him with jeers and sarcastic chants, but they were not racist. Anything else is a lie."</p>
