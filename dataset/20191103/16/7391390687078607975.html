      <p>If you're dealing with premature hair loss, you may be surprised to hear that chemicals in your home's water source could be a contributing factor. Thankfully, however, the <a href="https://thesafehealthyhome.com/best-shower-head-filter-review/">best shower filters for hair loss</a> exist to extract those unwanted chemicals and make showering a better experience for your strands.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.healthguidance.org/entry/15186/1/Hard-Water-Hair-Damage.html">main culprit is "hard" water</a> (aka water with high levels of magnesium and calcium). And should you live in an area that has it, you may be at a higher risk of having thinning, dry hair, or hair loss. For a bit more info on filters and how they can help, I reached out to Debra Jaliman, MD, a board-certified dermatologist based in New York City.</p>
      <p>"Filters help reduce the amount of chlorine in the water," Dr. Jaliman tells Bustle, adding that they also filter out calcium, magnesium, and other minerals that contribute to frizz and an overall dull appearance. Bacteria can also be a culprit, she notes. It builds up inside your shower head over time and can contaminate the water that comes out, causing even more damage. The good news? A <a href="https://www.bustle.com/articles/105764-why-a-shower-filter-is-something-your-hair-skin-desperately-need">shower filter</a> takes care of this as well.</p>
      <h3>Finding A Shower Filter: Where To Start</h3>
      <p>According to Dr. Jaliman, these are the major action items to keep in mind when searching for a filter that's right for you.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Look for one that removes chlorine and has a cartridge with a decent lifespan so you only have to replace it every six months.</li>
        <li>Find out if your town treats the water with chloramine, as some areas use this chemical instead of chlorine. It can still be harmful to your hair and skin, so if this is the case for you, Dr. Jaliman recommends choosing a filter that specifically removes chloramine.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Keeping Dr. Jaliman's advice in mind, I found four of the best filters out there. Whether you're looking for the <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/the-6-best-shower-heads-for-hard-water-58990">best shower head for hard water</a> or a two-in-one shower head and filter, there's something for you here. But don't forget to rule out other potential causes of premature balding. Underlying medical issues like protein deficiencies should always be ruled out by your doctor, and of course, excessive bleaching, dying, and heat styling can cause similar thinning.</p>
