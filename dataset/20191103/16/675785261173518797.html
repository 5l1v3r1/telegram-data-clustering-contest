      <h1>Paul Pogba sets date for Man Utd comeback and opens up on injury problem</h1>
      <h2>Paul Pogba has missed 10 Man Utd fixtures this season with an ankle injury including Saturday's defeat to Bournemouth</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T16:31:31+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 16:31</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Smith</a></address>
      <p>Paul Pogba has revealed he is still at least two weeks away from returning to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> training.</p>
      <p>Midfield superstar Pogba has missed the Red Devils' last seven fixtures as he attempts to recover from an ankle injury - which also kept him out for three matches earlier this season.</p>
      <p>The France international is still in plaster, which he showed off on French TV, with manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer admitting that he was unlikely to return to action until December.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think we’ll see him before December. He’ll be out for a while,” the United manager said. “He needs time to fully recover so I don’t think he will be back before maybe Sheffield United after the international break but probably December before you can see him.</p>

      <p>“I’m not a doctor but there is an injury there that needs healing. There’s no use talking about who’s not going to be here for a long time because he’s not going to come on the pitch and help us."</p>
      <p>Pogba added more detail to <a href="https://rmcsport.bfmtv.com/mediaplayer/video/paul-pogba-dans-pl-live-1198598.html">RMC Sport</a> : "I will still be under plaster for ten days. After, I still have two weeks of rehabilitation.</p>
      <p>"It's not easy to see my teammates go to training or on the field, but I have to take the time to come back."</p>

      <p>United suffered a fourth Premier League defeat of the season on Saturday as Joshua King's strike handed <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/afc-bournemouth">Bournemouth</a> a 1-0 victory at the Vitality Stadium.</p>
      <p>Pogba didn't travel to the south coast but appeared to follow the game at home - after the match he Facetimed his brother Matias live on France TV.</p>
      <p>"I’m gutted," Pogba said.</p>
      <p>"To see the team lose without being able to play is the worst. I would like to be back to help them but the most important thing is to heal."</p>
