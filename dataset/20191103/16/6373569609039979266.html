      <p>For a second successive year, Plymouth will not be getting a visit from the Coca Cola Christmas truck.</p>
      <p>Every year people all over the country eagerly anticipate the ringing bells from the popular advert for the first time.</p>
      <p>It is a sign that <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/all-about/christmas">Christmas</a> is on the way and gives people that warm festive feeling.</p>
      <p>Such was the popularity, a decision was made to take the truck out on the road to visit cities all over the country.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/">Plymouth</a> has been a destination for the truck before, including on one occasion where the event had to be shut down as crowds were so big that they were spilling into Royal Parade traffic.</p>

      <p>It last came to the city in 2017 with people queueing from 9.30am to get a glimpse of the festive vehicle at 11am.</p>
      <p>Christmas carols blurted out on big speakers and snow was also projected.</p>
      <p>Such was the cheer it brought, some of those waiting in the queues took to dancing.</p>
      <p>But there will be no such frivolities in 2019, as was confirmed by chief executive of <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/all-about/plymouth-city-centre">Plymouth City Centre</a> Company Steve Hughes.</p>

      <p>Asked by <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/all-about/chaz-singh">Chaz Singh</a> via Twitter whether it had been booked, he simply replied: "No, not this year."</p>
      <p>The official tour locations have not yet been released by Coca Cola but last year the closest the truck came to Plymouth was Exeter, where it visited Princesshay shopping centre.</p>
      <p>It also visited Looe where it was parked at the seafront.</p>
