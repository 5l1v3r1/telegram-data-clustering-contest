      <p>WILLIAMSBURG, Brooklyn (WABC) -- A vibrant new mural honoring the spirit of the TCS New York City Marathon adorns a concrete canvas in Brooklyn.</p>
      <p>Artist Adam J. Koon created the complex design.</p>
      <p>"I looked at different neighborhoods, different artwork that's been done, and just tried to show, bring my weirdness and bring the whimsical into it," said Koon.</p>
      <p>A group of talented mural painters took Koon's design and painstakingly brought it to life.</p>
      <p>The mural is at the corner of North 10th Street and Wythe Avenue in Williamsburg, the artist's neighborhood.</p>
      <p>"I can't believe it's painted on a wall here in Brooklyn where I live," said Koon. "It was really awesome to see it all come together."</p>
