        <b><a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/daniel-ricciardo">Daniel Ricciardo</a> fought hard to get into the final qualifying session at COTA. The Australian will be starting from P9, behind both McLaren cars. The <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/renault-f1-team">Renault</a> driver insists he'll get the horns out during the race and push for higher places. </b>
      </p>
      <p>This time last year, Renault were pushing Haas for the best of the rest position. 12 months on and they've been outperformed by McLaren. Ricciardo understands the situation and even though the battle is almost over, Ricciardo is keen to challenge those in front. </p>

      <p><i>“We’ve had a difficult few weeks in qualifying where I haven’t been too happy with myself, but today was much better and I extracted more or less everything from the car. We’ll give it a go tomorrow, I’ll get the horns out and look to advance,"</i> Ricciardo said. </p>
      <p>
        <i>"We’re starting on the Soft, maybe it’s not the best tyre to begin the race, but it is what it is. We’re on the clean side of the grid too, so we’ll be looking to make some places there and get our heads down.”</i>
