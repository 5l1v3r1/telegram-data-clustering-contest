      <h1>Logan Paul plans to produce Conor McGregor-style performance against KSI</h1>
      <h2>Paul and YouTube rival KSI clash in their rematch in Los Angeles on Saturday</h2>

      <p>Logan Paul wants to emulate Conor McGregor and replicate the UFC star's win over Jose Aldo.</p>
      <p>Paul takes on YouTube rival KSI in Los Angeles on Saturday in a rematch of their draw in Manchester last year.</p>
      <p>The feuding pair have turned professional for the sequel and will ditch the headguards and pull on 10oz gloves.</p>
      <p>And Paul believes a performance similar to McGregor's 13-second KO of Aldo in 2015 will send his stock through the roof.</p>
      <p>"There’s so much on the line between me and KSI," he said. "There is so much on the line. Egos, subscribers, the crown of 'The YouTube King'.</p>

      <p>"The last match was a draw. If the W is secured in a monumental way, something similar to when <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/conor-mcgregor">Conor McGregor</a> knocked out Jose Aldo, if something like that happens, it is going to be long-lasting form of stardom.</p>
      <p>"There is a stigma that comes along with being an internet star – a YouTuber, an influencer. The narrative of the first fight was that there’s these two YouTubers boxing and now it’s two YouTubers slash professional boxers fighting.</p>
      <p>"But I think that boxing helps get rid of that stigma. People look at you in a different way when you get inside these ropes and put it all on the line.”</p>
      <p>Paul and KSI have both recruited star-studded teams for their rematch with Paul being trained by former heavyweight world champion Shannon Briggs.</p>

      <p>And he added: “The only problem is that the fight isn’t tonight. I’ve been locked in camp for two and a half months. I haven’t taken a day off for the last year and a half since our last fight.</p>
      <p>"That draw left a nasty taste in my mouth. There is a lot of regimented hard work you have to put in to become a fighter and few people are willing to do it.</p>
      <p>"This is such a hard grueling sport. This is a big fight and it’s the biggest event of my life so there’s no reason that I won’t go as hard as I possibly can every day.</p>
      <p>"Boxing has changed my life and I haven’t even been doing it that long. We call training camp ‘The No Fun Club.’ We aren’t allowed to have fun. We are locked down and it is intense. We have a very routine-based camp.”</p>
