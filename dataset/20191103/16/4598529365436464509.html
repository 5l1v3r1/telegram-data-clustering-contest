      <p>On Sunday morning, White House senior adviser Kellyanne Conway struggled to respond to the shocking revelations of President Donald Trump’s Ukraine scheme that have emerged in the impeachment investigation.</p>
      <p>Marking the first time a White House official has shown up to a State of the Union interview <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/jake-tapper-white-house-gop-leaders-avoid-interviews">in over a month</a>, Conway dodged CNN anchor Dana Bash’s questions about top diplomat Bill Taylor’s <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/bil-taylor-three-reveals-trump-ukraine-quid-pro-quo">explosive deposition</a> confirming that President Donald Trump was withholding military aide to Ukraine in exchange for an investigation into Joe Biden and his son Hunter.</p>
      <p>“Was the administration holding up military aid in exchange for this investigation?” Bash asked after reading an excerpt of Taylor’s opening statement.</p>
      <p>“They have the aid. They’re using the aid,” Conway said, a refrain she invoked multiple times as the CNN anchor pressed her for a direct response.</p>
      <p>After Bash asked the question for the fourth time, the White House adviser finally gave something of an answer.</p>
      <p>“I don’t know,” she said before going back to emphasizing that Ukraine ultimately did receive the aid.</p>
      <p>“Can you say definitively no quid pro quo for this military aid?” Bash asked.</p>
      <p>Conway dodged again, claiming that there was “no quid pro quo in this call” and “Ukraine has that aid and is using it right now.”</p>
      <p>“Kellyanne, you very notably won’t say yes or no,” Bash told her after trying to get her to confirm whether there was quid pro quo for the umpteenth time.</p>
