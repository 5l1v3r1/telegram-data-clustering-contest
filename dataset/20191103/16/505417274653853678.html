        <b>The AIB club championship campaign is officially in full swing as sides from all four provinces took to the field over the weekend.</b>
      </p>
      <p>In Ulster, Clontibret finally had their day in the sun while Ballintubber got the job done out west.</p>
      <p>In hurling, Ballygunner did what they do best while the big shock of the day came in Leinster.</p>
      <p>
        <i>Here is your comprehensive AIB club championship round-up.</i>

      <h3>Ulster club SFC quarter-finals</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Athletic Grounds</b>
        <br/>
        <i>Crossmaglen (Armagh) 0-9 Clontibret (Monaghan) 0-10</i>
      </p>
      <p>Three times these sides have met in the Ulster club championship with each of those games coming down to a single point. The only difference this time being that Clontibret were on the right side of the result.</p>
      <p>Led by Crossmaglen’s own John McEntee, the Monaghan outfit were on the front foot from the get-go in Armagh leading by 0-7 to 0-3 at half-time thanks to two booming efforts from Farney star Conor McManus.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>In typical Crossmaglen fashion, they pushed back in the second half but ably led by McManus, Clontibret were able to see out the win and in the process, blow the Ulster club wide open.</p>

      </p>
      <p>After three gruelling games with reigning Ulster champions Gaoth Dobhair, Naomh Conaill Glenties are now in the Ulster semi-final where they face Clontibret after defeating Cavan champions Castlerahan thanks to an inspired performance from captain Ciaran Thompson who scored the all-important goal.</p>

        <i>Kilcoo (Down) 1-11 Magherafelt (Derry) 0-9</i>
      </p>
      <p>The Rossa dream run comes to an end as an experience Kilcoo side qualified for another Ulster semi-final with Jerome Johnston netting for the Down kingpins.</p>

        <i>Derrygonnelly (Fermanagh) v Trillick (Tyrone) 2.30pm</i>
      </p>
      <p>The Fermanagh men took an early lead with a fisted goal through Eamon McHugh. After two missed goal opportunities Trillick finally got one of their own when the Donnelly brothers combined to set-up Ryan Gray after 15 minutes.</p>
      <p>James Garrity bagged a second for Trillick but still, there was nothing to separate the sides as the game finished level 1-13 to 2-10. Extra-time was needed.</p>
      <p>Trillick scored their third goal in extra-time but again Derrygonnelly came back and amazingly Conall Jones landed an equaliser to send the game to penalties.</p>
      <p>After all that it was Derrygonnelly who progressed to the semi-finals after a 6-5 win on penalties after Lee Brennan missed in sudden death.</p>

      <h3>Connacht club SFC quarter-finals</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Markievicz Park </b>
        <br/>
        <i>Tourlestrane (Sligo) 0-6 Padraig Pearses (Roscommon) 3-7</i>
      </p>
      <p>Fresh off their first county title at the eighth time of asking, Padraig Pearses have gone another step with a maiden Connacht club championship victory after defeating Tourlestrane at Markievicz Park.</p>
      <p>The Sligo kingpins started brightly and led by two points after ten minutes until Niall Carty’s goal put the Roscommon men in front. Pearses were then awarded a dubious penalty six minutes into the second half. County man Hubert Darcy converted to put them into a five-point lead that they never relinquished.</p>

      <p>Paul Carey rounded off the win with his side’s third goal in injury time.</p>

        <i>Ballintubber (Mayo) 1-11 Glencar-Manorhamilton (Leitrim) 0-9</i>
      </p>
      <p>Last year’s beaten finalists are there to the final four but they were pushed all the way by the Leitrim champions. The two sides were nip and tuck throughout a tentative opening half that saw the Mayo men hold a slender one-point lead at the break.</p>
      <p>Shortly after the break, Alan Plunkett hit the net for Ballintubber to give them a cushion that Glencar-Manorhamilton just couldn’t reduce.</p>

      <h3>Munster club SHC quarter-final</h3>

        <b>Sixmilebridge<br/></b>
        <i>Sixmilebridge (Clare) 0-12 Ballygunner (Waterford) 1-21</i>
      </p>
      <p>Last year’s beaten Munster finalists are through to the final four where they will face Patrickswell after a commanding victory over Clare champions Sixmilebridge.</p>
      <p>Dessie Hutchinson proved to be the star for Ballygunner finishing the day with 1-2.</p>

      <h3>Leinster club SHC quarter-finals</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Netwatch Cullen Park</b>
        <br/>
        <i>St Mullins (Carlow) 2-13 Cuala (Dublin) 0-18</i>
      </p>
      <p>The shock of the day came in Netwatch Cullen Park as two-time All-Ireland winning champions Cuala were dumped out of the Leinster club championship by St. Mullins.</p>
      <p>The game was tense and tight throughout with Cuala leading by one at the break, however, St. Mullins grabbed their first goal of the day shortly after half-time. The <a href="https://twitter.com/DubGAAOfficial">Dublin</a> champions never wilted though and indeed led by one again with five minutes remaining.</p>

        <img src="https://media.punditarena.com/uploads/2019/11/o-Copy.png"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Cuala, who started without recently crowned football All-Star Con O’Callaghan, relied on David Treacy for scores while Carlow star Marty Kavanagh kept the scoreboard ticking over for St. Mullins.</p>
      <p>With the sides level heading into injury time, the Carlow men struck for their second goal to edge them over the line in a thrilling giant-killing encounter.</p>

        <b>TEG Cusack Park<br/></b>
        <i>Clonkill (Westmeath) 2-15 Ballyhale Shamrocks (Kilkenny) 3-21</i>
      </p>
      <p>Despite the best efforts of Brendan Murtagh who scored 2-9 for Clonkill it will be the All-Ireland champions who will contest the Leinster semi-final. It was Ballyhale who led by seven at the break thank in part to Eoin Cody’s double.</p>
      <p>The youngster then completed his hat-trick shortly after the break as the Kilkenny side claimed a nine-point win.</p>

        <i>Rathdowney-Errill (Laois) v St. Rynaghs (Offaly)</i>
      </p>
      <p>The Laois amalgamated club rolls on in the Leinster club series following a comfortable win over Offaly champions St. Rynaghs who had a man sent-off in the second half.</p>
