      <p>"Viewers are in for a special treat this summer break as their favourite villians, heroes and matriachs from the past will be brought back to their screens to turn this years’ festive break into a nostalgic, unforgettable television experience.  The broadcasts will be packaged for a thrilling combination of the most-hated, most-loved and most-memorable moments in the history of the popular soapie since its debut on national television 28 years ago."</p>
      <p>"Each week the soapie will play episodes remembering our heroes:  the Archie Morokas, Kenneth Mashabas, Julia Motenes, Glen Majosis.

      <p>According to an article by <a href="https://www.sundayworld.co.za/"><b>Sunday World</b></a>, the break is as a result of an ongoing dispute between the show’s producer Mfundi Vundla and the SABC. This is in relation to a contractual issue between the parties.</p>
      <p>Various attempts to get comment from the SABC were unsuccessful at the time of publishing.</p>
