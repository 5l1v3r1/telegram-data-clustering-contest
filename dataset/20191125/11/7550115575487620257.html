        <b>Liverpool are prepared to give the green light for both <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/rhian-brewster/">Rhian Brewster</a> and <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/tag/caoimhin-kelleher/">Caoimhin Kelleher</a> to head out on loan in January.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The two youngsters are highly-rated within the club and have featured in both thrilling <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/league-cup">League Cup</a> victories, which has set the Reds up for a quarter-final clash with Aston Villa in December.</p>
      <p>Their involvement beyond the domestic cup action has been limited, however, and the Reds and now weighing up temporary departures for the pair in the January transfer window.</p>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/liverpools-plan-rhian-brewster-revealed-17310894"><i>Liverpool Echo</i></a>, <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/jurgen-klopp/">Jurgen Klopp</a> is content to see Brewster, who has three times been named on the bench in the <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/premier-league">Premier League</a> this season, gain senior first team experience elsewhere.</p>
      <p>As ever, Liverpool will first seek assurances over playing time before sanctioning a move for the 19-year-old who is yet to make his <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/premier-league">Premier League</a> bow.</p>
      <p>While he has been provided with few opportunities at senior level thus far at Anfield, he has talent in abundance and is said to have attracted interest from Aston Villa, <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/crystal-palace">Crystal Palace</a> and Championship side Swansea â€“ who are pushing for promotion this season.</p>

      <p>A similar stance is being taken for Kelleher who has only seen senior action this season in the <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/league-cup">League Cup</a> as he remains behind <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/alisson/">Alisson</a> and <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/tag/adrian/">Adrian</a> in the pecking order.</p>
      <p>But with the Reds holding high hopes for the Irishman, who was the hero in the penalty shootout win against <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/arsenal">Arsenal</a>, they are prepared to sanction a move to see him gain experience instead of solely acting as a travelling member of the senior side.</p>
      <p>Liverpool are well stocked in the goalkeeper department should anything untoward happen with <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/alisson/">Alisson</a> once more, with <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/tag/adrian/">Adrian</a> and Andy Lonergan both waiting in the wings.</p>
      <p>Preston North End are reported suitors for Kelleher, but it remains to be seen whether the Championship outfit would be a good fit as former Norwich stopper Declan Rudd is currently the undisputed first choice.</p>
