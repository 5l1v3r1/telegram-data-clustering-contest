      <p>Experts from the fire service were at the scene this morning, using a specially-trained dog to sniff for any potential accelerants like petrol.</p>
      <p>Six fire engines from across the Fylde coast were called to the three-storey hotel and arrived to find the ground floor "well alight", a spokesman for the Lancashire Fire and Rescue Service (LFRS) said.</p>
      <p>Firefighters wearing breathing masks and carrying water jets put out the flames, he added, with the fire out by 3.25am.</p>

      <p>One person clambered to safety down a ladder at the back of the hotel, while another - who got to safety on their own - was checked over by paramedics, the spokesman said.</p>
      <p>One ambulance and two rapid response cars were called out at 2.39am, a spokeswoman for the North West Ambulance Service (NWAS) said.</p>
      <p>She said one person was taken to hospital after breathing in smoke.</p>
      <p>"It was somebody inside the hotel", she said, but could not give their gender or age.</p>

      <p>Lancashire Police said a "number of people" were evacuated.</p>
      <p>A 35-year-old man from Blackpool was arrested on suspicion of arson with the intention of endangering life.</p>
      <p>He was still in custody this morning, a force spokeswoman said.</p>
      <p>The Almar was open for business at the time of the fire, it was understood, with the last review on website Booking.com being left last Tuesday.</p>
