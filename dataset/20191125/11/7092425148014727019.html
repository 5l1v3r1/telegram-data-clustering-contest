        <b>Taylor Swift broke records with six gongs at this year's American Music Awards as she was named both artist of the year and artist of the decade.</b>
      </p>
      <p>She won six awards at the AMAs, taking her all-time total to 29, organisers confirmed this brings her above Michael Jackson's record of 24.</p>
      <p>Swift was already named artist of the decade before Sunday's ceremony, but she also won the biggest prize of the night with the artist of the year gong.</p>
      <p>Swift beat Drake, Ariana Grande, Halsey and Post Malone to the award.</p>
      <p>An emotional Swift told the crowd at the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles that the last year had given her "some of the most amazing times" along with "the hardest things I've gone through in my life".</p>

      <p>Swift, 29, has been in a feud with prominent talent manager Scooter Braun and her former record label over the rights to her back catalogue of six albums.</p>
      <p>The dispute had briefly put her AMAs performance in doubt.</p>
      <p>The artist accused Braun of refusing permission for her to sing songs from her back catalogue at the awards show, asking her 122 million Instagram followers to let Braun "know how you feel about this".</p>

      <p>Braun subsequently claimed his family had received "numerous death threats" and that he "would like to find a resolution".</p>
      <p>Swift did not directly reference the dispute at the AMAs but she did say that "this industry is really weird" before thanking her fans, adding: "This year for me has been a lot. It's been a lot of good, it's been a lot of really complicated."</p>
      <p>Swift performed a medley of some of her biggest hits including Speak Now, Red and Fearless.</p>

      <p>In her acceptance speech, Swift said the honour celebrated ten years of "hard work and of art and of fun and memories".</p>
      <p>She added: “All that matters to me is the memories I have had with you guys, with you the fans, over the years.”</p>
