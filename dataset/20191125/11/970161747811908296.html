      <p>The UK’s largest ever coin has been released and it is big enough to serve your dinner on.</p>
      <p>Royal Mint has today unveiled its 5 kilo record-breaking coin, weighing an incredible 5 kilos and is worth £5,000.</p>
      <p>Made from alloy 999 Au Fine Gold, the impressive coin weighs 5010.00g with a diameter of 175mm, and one of them has already been bought for an undisclosed amount.</p>
      <p>It is part of a new ‘Great Engravers’ series, that celebrates artists who have worked on British coinage and begins with Royal Academician William Wyon’s Una And The Lion design.</p>
      <p>Wyon was the chief engraver at the Royal Mint from 1828 until his death in 1851 and was most famous for his coin and medal portraits of Queen Victoria.</p>
      <p>He is also well-known for his design of Una And The Lion, considered by collectors as one of the world’s most beautiful coins.</p>

      <p>The collection also includes a smaller, 2 kilo coin, which will have a mintage of just four, while the smaller coins will be sold for £119,950.</p>
      <p>To create the new giant coin, a combination of traditional engraving methods and modern techniques were applied, such as lasers being used to carefully cut the design before it was hand-polished.</p>
      <p>The original die used almost 200 years ago had to be digitally scanned and chief engraver Gordon Summers ensured the relief was accurately reproduced.</p>
      <p>Nicola Howell, director of the consumer division at The Royal Mint said: ‘The Great Engravers series celebrates some of the finest artists that have worked on British coinage and we are thrilled to start the series with William Wyon’s Una And The Lion design.</p>
      <p>‘This is arguably one of the most admired designs amongst coin collectors across the globe, and remastering it onto five and two-kilo coins allows you to truly appreciate the detail of the design.’</p>
