      <p>Cape Town - In 1972, Queen Elizabeth banned a documentary that showed an intimate moment between her and her youngest son, Prince Edward.</p>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/royal/1208836/Queen-Elizabeth-news-royal-family-latest-updates-prince-edward-BBC-documentary"><b>Daily Express</b></a>, the queen banned the film which documented the royal family’s daily lives.</p>
      <p>The documentary, which was originally released in 1969 and screened on the BBC and ITV, detailed the life of the now 93-year-old as a ruling monarch.</p>
      <p>In one of the scenes, the queen and her then four-year-old son Prince Edward can be seen entering a candy store where she purchased ice cream for him using money from her purse.</p>
      <p>Later little Edward can be seen tucking into his treat, while his mother is concerned he’ll "mess on the car seat".  </p>
      <p>Despite letting the camera’s into her life then, Queen Elizabeth soon banned the 110-minute doccie because it "lets the magic out" about the royal family, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/10403864/queen-banned-documentary-royal-family-buying-ice-cream-prince-edward/"><b>The Sun</b></a> reported.</p>
      <p>In addition to this, the film dispelled the notion that the queen never carries money in her purse which, according to the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-5005283/Why-Queen-carries-money-Sundays.html"><b>Daily Mail</b></a>, she reportedly does do once a week on a Sunday.</p>
