      <p>Morrisons is to offer boxes of unsold food in all its stores to combat food waste and help customers save money.</p>
      <p>The supermarket will become the first the UK to sell food past its ‘best before’ date through a ground-breaking app.</p>
      <p>Shoppers will be able to use the Too Good To Go app to purchase boxes of unsold fruit and veg, bakery and deli items worth at least £10 for £3.09.</p>
      <p>You won't know what's inside the box until you pick it up from your local supermarket.</p>
      <p>The service has been trialled in a handful of stores and will now be available in all 494 Morrisons supermarkets nationwide from Tuesday, November 26.</p>

      <p>The move aims to help customers on a budget and to provide another channel for food that might otherwise be wasted.</p>
      <p><b>Jayne Wall, Market Street Director at Morrisons, said</b> : “We are using technology to help us reduce food waste and to help more people afford to eat well. <br/><br/>"It will also mean we waste less food this Christmas as it will find a home for products that can’t be sold after the festive period.”</p>
      <p>Morrisons expects to distribute 350,000 boxes of unsold food in 2020. This will reduce CO2 emissions by 882 tonnes: the equivalent of driving from London to Edinburgh 5,351 times. Morrisons says it is committed to reducing operational food waste by 50 per cent by 2030.</p>
      <p><b>Hayley Conick, UK Country Manager at Too Good To Go, said: </b>“Every single day perfectly edible food goes to waste simply because it isn’t sold, and this is having detrimental effects on our planet.</p>

      <p>"We need greater awareness of the issue of food waste, so we are delighted to welcome Morrisons as our first UK supermarket partner. <br/><br/>"Together we can fight food waste and ensure that quality surplus produce doesn’t end up in the bin.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>Here's how it works</b>
      </p>
      <p>All people need to do is download the free app and browse local stores with food available. They select a local store from which to purchase unsold food at a great price. They pay through the app and then collect their food from the store during the given collection window.</p>
