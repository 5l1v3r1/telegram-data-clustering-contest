      <h3>Motorola Razr 2 could have an in-screen scanner and eight side sensors</h3>
      <p>And no chin</p>

      <p>You can’t even buy the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/motorola-razr-2019">Motorola Razr 2019</a> yet – and at $1,500 (around £1,350 / AU$2,000) you quite possibly shouldn’t – but Motorola might already be planning a second, better model with at least two new features, which have been shown off in a patent.</p>
      <p>Approved on November 21 and spotted by LetsGoDigital, the Motorola patent shows a device that looks a lot like the current foldable Razr, but with a couple of key differences.</p>
      <p>First, there’s a fingerprint icon on the screen, suggesting the fingerprint scanner would be built into the display. That would make sense – and it would be a more elegant solution than the scanner below the screen on the Motorola Razr 2019 – although the patent doesn’t make any mention of this beyond the image.</p>

      <p>What the patent is instead focused on is eight sensors at the edges of the screen – four on each side. These can be used as customizable buttons that can be accessed whether the screen is folded or unfolded.</p>
      <p>As well as presses, these sensors can also respond to gestures, such as a swipe, and can be configured to do different things depending on whether the screen is open or folded shut – so basically they would allow for plenty of shortcuts and quick settings toggles.</p>
      <p>It’s worth noting too that the phone shown in these images lacks the chin of the Motorola Razr 2019, with the in-screen fingerprint scanner sitting where that would be. That could mean the Motorola Razr 2 won’t have a chin, but again we wouldn’t read too much into this, as the images are just there to illustrate the side sensors.</p>
      <p>There’s also no guarantee that the Motorola Razr 2 will have these sensors, since while Motorola is clearly exploring the idea, features mentioned in patents don’t always make it into finished products.</p>
      <p>It's likely to be a while before we find out for sure, so stay tuned for updates, as TechRadar will bring you all the reputable Motorola Razr 2 rumors as and when they surface.</p>
