      <p>On Sunday evening, November 24, six houses burned down to the ground as a result of shelling by Russian-led forces near the village of Berezove, Donetsk region.</p>
      <p>"At about 18:00 on November 24, Russian occupiers opened heavy-maching-gun fire at the positions of the Joint Forces near the village of Berezove in Donetsk region, with the use of tracer and armor-piercing incendiary ammunition," the press center of Ukraine's Joint Forces Operation wrote on Facebook.</p>
      <p>Dry grass caught fire amid shelling.</p>
      <p>"Strong winds led to the rapid spread of fire, including toward the nearby cabins. Six cabins almost completely burned down," the headquarters said.</p>
      <p>The military of the Armed Forces of Ukraine quickly evacuated the civilians. There were no casualties.</p>
      <p>The fire was put out at about 23:00.</p>
