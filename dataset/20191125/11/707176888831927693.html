      <h2>A vicious price war over trading fees leads to takeover of rival TD Ameritrade</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T11:41:06+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 11:41</time> by <a rel="author">Myles McCormick, Eric Platt</a></address>
      <p>Charles Schwab chief executive Walt Bettinger downplayed concerns that US antitrust regulators will attempt to block his company’s $26bn takeover of TD Ameritrade after analysts said the deal risked scrutiny in Washington.</p>
      <p>Schwab has already been in contact with the Federal Reserve and other regulators, the group said on Monday, and Mr Bettinger signalled that the group would remain competitive with its rivals on commissions.</p>
      <p>US brokers have been hit by a savage price war in which Schwab itself has led the way. The <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c1832f20-0c50-11ea-bb52-34c8d9dc6d84">takeover of TD Ameritrade</a> would raise Schwab’s client assets above $5tn and its number of clients to 24m.</p>
      <p>“We have numerous competitors, many of which are far larger than us today and far larger than a combined organisation,” Mr Bettinger told analysts, nodding specifically to Fidelity, Vanguard and ETrade, as well as the large wealth managers Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and UBS. </p>
      <p>“They’re going to continue to come right after us, as they are now in all aspects of the business,” he added.</p>
      <p>In an attempt to allay fears of a potential regulatory threat, Mr Bettinger pointed to the fact that the combined group would have roughly 11 per cent of the assets in the US retail wealth management industry and only account for 6 per cent of the sector’s revenues.</p>
      <p>However, Kyle Voigt, an analyst at KBW, said that “we think this deal may face somewhat significant antitrust hurdles, depending on how the competitive market is viewed by relevant authorities.”</p>
      <p>The ambitious combination comes at a critical moment for Schwab and Ameritrade, which have been caught up in a <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/fac8a498-0ca7-11ea-bb52-34c8d9dc6d84">blistering price war</a> that has seen the companies give up trading fees in the battle for customers who can then be sold other services. In recent weeks, the cuts have wiped billions of dollars from the pair’s market valuations. </p>

      <p>Shareholders in Ameritrade, whose origins date back to 1975 when US regulators outlawed fixed brokerage commissions, will receive 1.0837 of Schwab shares for each Ameritrade share they own. That amounted to about $52.23 a share based on Schwab’s closing stock price on Friday.</p>
      <p>“One of Chuck Schwab’s ambitions has always been to build a strong and independent Schwab that would be around to serve clients for many years in the future,” Mr Bettinger said. “The combination of our two great companies positions us to be competing and winning in the investment services business for the long run, the very long run.”</p>
      <p>TD Bank, which holds a 43 per cent stake in Ameritrade, will own 13 per cent of Schwab after the deal is completed. The Canadian bank agreed to have its voting interest in Schwab capped at 9.9 per cent, with the remainder of its stake held in new, non-voting shares.</p>

      <p>Schwab said it would cut staff as part of the deal and re-evaluate its real estate portfolio, moves that it expected would save the combined group as much as $2bn. The takeover is expected to be finalised next year, after a stockholder vote. </p>
      <p>The two groups reported revenues of $16.8bn and profits of $6bn in the 12 months to the end of September.</p>
      <p>Schwab shares gained sharply on Thursday and Friday after news of the deal first emerged. The two stocks were little changed on Monday.</p>
