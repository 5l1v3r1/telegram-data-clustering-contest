      <p>Japanese tech giant Toshiba has announced it has developed a blood test that detects various cancer types in a few hours with 99% accuracy.</p>
      <p>The test, jointly developed with Tokyo Medical University and the National Cancer Center, is claimed to be able to detect a total of 13 different cancer types, including pancreas, stomach and breast cancers.<br/><br/>Toshiba scientists say the test measures the concentration of microRNA molecules released by cancer cells. The blood test is conducted with a small device and the results come back in only two hours.</p>
      <p>The project team said this innovation can reduce the cost of cancer diagnoses. Toshiba is currently working on introducing this device for commercial use and may roll it out in a few years.</p>
