      <h2>All five candidates have explained why they should get your support</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T11:57:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 11:57</time> by <a rel="author">Kit Sandeman</a></address>
      <p>The General Election candidates standing in Mansfield have set out why people should vote for them, and what they would like to achieve if elected.</p>
      <p>Conservative Ben Bradley pulled off a major upset here last time round, gaining a seat which in living memory had only ever been held by Labour.</p>
      <p>This time, there are five candidates, two of whom are standing as independents in a heavily Leave-leaning area.</p>
      <p>We’ve asked all the candidates standing why people should vote for them.</p>
      <h3>Ben Bradley, Conservative</h3>
      <p>I’ve been the Member of Parliament for Mansfield since the 2017 election, when I won an historic victory as the first ever Conservative to win the seat, ending nearly 100 years of Labour representation.</p>
      <p>Since entering Parliament I’ve been a vocal campaigner for Brexit and have always voted to leave the EU at the earliest opportunity, backing my constituents who voted 71 percent to leave.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>My key local priorities have been town centre regeneration, transport links and education, and I’ve made major progress in all three areas.</p>
      <p>I secured an <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/local-news/arnold-town-centre-funding-bid-3338014">[up to] £25m ‘Town Deal’</a> to boost Mansfield’s local economy along with a commitment to hundreds of new police officers to keep the town safe, over £20m of Government cash for the A38, A617 and A614 as well as big improvement plans on the Robin Hood Rail line, and a £14bn increase in funding for schools while serving on the Education Select Committee in Parliament.</p>
      <h3>Sarah Brown, Liberal Democrat</h3>
      <p>I am an HR Professional who joined the Liberal Democrats in 2013.</p>
      <p>I’ve been campaigning for several years to <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/politics">remain in the European Union</a> and am strongly behind the Liberal Democrats policy to revoke Article 50 and stop Brexit.</p>

      <p>People who voted remain in Mansfield and across the UK are being ignored by both Labour and the Conservatives who are determined to delivery Brexit at any cost.</p>
      <p>Brexit has proved itself to be far from what was promised by Boris Johnson and the leave campaign and will cause chaos up and down our country.</p>
      <h3>Stephen Harvey, Independent</h3>
      <p>In common with many previous Mansfield MPs I was a local coal miner, then a Mansfield District Councillor before I became Chairman of Mansfield District Council.</p>
      <p>I’m also one of only two candidates that actually live in Mansfield.</p>
      <p>I’ve consistently campaigned for the delivery of Brexit and am ashamed of our current Parliamentarians.</p>
      <p>I have a strong record of defending Mansfield and district taxpayers’ money.</p>

      <p>I have directly changed major government policies that have positively affected multi-million pound investments locally.</p>
      <p>As the two main parties push more towards the extremities the vast majority of Mansfield and District residents tell me they desperately need a centre ground politician.</p>
      <p>This election is not just about Brexit, but also about the NHS, social care, crime, the environment and education all require a huge amount of work.</p>
      <p>A vote for an independent means that I can put Mansfield before any political party interests.</p>
      <h3>Sid Pepper, Independent</h3>
      <p>Like it or not, the reality is that this election is about Brexit.</p>
      <p>All because dishonourable MPs across parliament decided not to honour our democratic vote.</p>
      <p>I have stood twice before on a Brexit platform, to see my core voters ‘lend’ their votes in 2017 to the Conservatives, who promised to deliver Brexit.</p>
      <p>So I have to stand again, if only to remind voters of the promises made and not delivered by the Tory government.</p>

      <p>Again their main pitch is to deliver Brexit. But Johnson’s treaty is not Brexit, so for a second time they are promising something they won’t deliver.</p>
      <p>Nationally, I pledge to support the Brexit you voted for and make the Conservatives deliver on this promise.</p>
      <p>Locally, I would work to stop the decline of Mansfield, making our market future proof, by moving the stalls undercover – the Old Town Hall, then using the Square for free central parking.</p>
      <h3>Sonya Ward, Labour</h3>
      <p>I have lived in Mansfield for more than three decades, and worked across Mansfield, Woodhouse and Warsop as a youth worker, for the NHS and for the Open University.</p>
      <p>Mansfield is a great place to live in so many ways, we’ve got wonderful people and great community spirit.</p>
      <p>But, I’m concerned nothing has replaced what was lost with the decline of industry.</p>
      <p>Wages here are £6,400 below the national average.</p>
      <p>Low pay means less disposable income in people’s pockets, and that impacts on our town centres and marketplaces.</p>

      <p>It’s hard for young people to find good quality employment here, but under a Labour government, with a new focus on manufacturing in Britain, there will be new opportunities.</p>
      <p>We need to be able to look forward with hope, and we can only do that with a government and an MP who will fight for investment not further cuts.</p>
      <p>Mansfield was once a thriving district, and it can be again. Back me to back Mansfield.</p>
