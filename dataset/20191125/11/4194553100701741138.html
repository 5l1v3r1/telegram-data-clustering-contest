      <h1>(Video) Klopp gives opinion on van Dijk/Messi Ballon d‚ÄôOr debate</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T11:49:49+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 11:49</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/jordanchamberlain/" target="_blank">Jordan Chamberlain</a></address>
      <p>Jurgen Klopp has explained that Virgil van Dijk deserves the Ballon d‚ÄôOr, as it is an award for the best player over a calendar year ‚Äì and not simply for the best player on the planet.</p>
      <p>Rightly, Liverpool‚Äôs manager explained how Lionel Messi is the greatest footballer of his generation, but that van Dijk enjoyed the better season on a purely individual basis.</p>
      <p>The Dutchman helped Liverpool win the Champions League and was practically flawless throughout the entirety of 2018/19.</p>

      <blockquote>"If you give the Ballon d'Or to the best player of this generation then you should give it always to Lionel Messi.<br/>"But if you give it to the best player of last season, then it was Virgil van Dijk.'' üëè<a href="https://t.co/4LDgWroiiI">pic.twitter.com/4LDgWroiiI<br/></a>‚Äî The Anfield Wrap (@TheAnfieldWrap) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheAnfieldWrap/status/1198923187741962240?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 25, 2019</a></blockquote>
