      <h2>Fans have hit out at trolls who accused Molly-Mae of 'blackfishing' for wearing a shade darker than her natural skintone</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T11:11:52+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 11:11</time> by <a rel="author">Louise Randell, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/louise-randell/</a></address>
      <p>Molly-Mae Hague has been defended by fans after she was targeted by vicious trolls who mocked her "orange" foundation.</p>
      <p>The Love Island star posted a video online showing her doing her make-up, and she was seen using a base darker than her natural skin tone.</p>
      <p>Molly-Mae explained she uses a darker shade to stop her looking so pale in winter, but was bombarded with abuse from trolls.</p>
      <p>She said: "I’ve really been enjoying Giorgio Armani Luminous Silk but this is too dark for me so I’m going to be mixing it with my studio fix fluid from MAC which is a holy grail of mine.</p>
      <p>"I use it all the time and this is in the shade NC42 which is still very dark.</p>

      <p>"I often get lots of comments on how my face is too dark.</p>
      <p>"I go very pale in the winter time and obviously now it’s getting colder, it’s getting wintery.</p>
      <p>"So I’ve gotten quite pale. ‘Once my foundation is on, and the whole world has hated me for how orange my face is…"</p>
      <p>One troll wrote: "Is this satire? There’s no way she actually believes it’s a match… It’s like 10 shades too dark."</p>

      <p>Another added: "he uses nc42 which is the LIGHTER bottle she’s holding… I’m punjabi and i’m NC30.</p>
      <p>"I know black women and asian women who are NC42. lol.</p>
      <p>"You can defend this all you want but it’s actual madness &amp; FYI it doesn’t look believable for one second. you are all orange blud."</p>
      <p>However, Molly-Mae has been defended by fans who have called the trolling "madness".</p>
      <p>One tweeted: "Can’t lie Molly-mae’s Nc42 foundation isn’t really that dark. I wear NC44 and I’m light skinned.</p>

      <p>"It has a tanned/orange undertone so it goes well with fake tan."</p>
      <p>Another wrote: "I wish people would actually watch the video of molly-mae doing her makeup because they’d realise after concealer, powder etc her foundation matches her tan perfectly and doesn’t look “too dark”</p>
      <p>A third added: "Poor molly-mae Hague never gets a break, first for a photo where she looks like she’s got a hairy arse, now Cos she’s wearing shade NC42 foundation she’s accused of black fishing...</p>
      <p>"Hold the door, I wear the same shades - someone lock me up and through away the key."</p>
