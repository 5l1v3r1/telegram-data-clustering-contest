      <h1>WWW Creator Tim Berners-Lee Shapes Web Rescue Strategy</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T11:55:40+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 11:55</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pymnts.com/author/pymnts/" target="_blank">PYMNTS</a></address>
      <p>British scientist and World Wide Web (WWW) creator Tim Berners-Lee has designed a strategy to save the internet from corruption and falsehoods,  <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/24/tim-berners-lee-unveils-global-plan-to-save-the-internet">The Guardian</a> reported on Sunday (Nov. 24).</p>
      <p>Berners-Lee worked for <a href="https://home.cern/science/computing/birth-web">CERN</a> when he was credited with inventing the web in 1989. His proposed <a href="https://contractfortheweb.org/">Contract for the Web</a> asks the public, governments and corporations worldwide to make a “commitment to protect the web from abuse and ensure it benefits humanity.”</p>
      <p>He told the Guardian that not taking action will trigger “a very large number of things” to go awry. “We could end up with a digital dystopia if we don’t turn … the web around now.”</p>
      <p>The plan was devised by 80 organizations and took over a year to create. It outlines nine core fundamentals — three each for the public, governments, and corporations — to protect the web. Over 150 organizations — including Microsoft, Google and Facebook — have endorsed the project. Amazon and Twitter didn’t sign on yet.</p>
      <p>“The forces taking the web in the wrong direction have always been very strong,” Berners-Lee told the Guardian. “Whether you’re a company or a government, controlling the web is a way to make huge profits or a way of ensuring you remain in power.”</p>
      <p>The founding director of the <a href="https://webfoundation.org/">Web Foundation</a>, he launched the non-profit in 2009 “to advance the open web as a public good and a basic right,” according to its website. </p>
      <p>“I had hoped that 30 years from its creation, we would be using the web foremost for the purpose of serving humanity. Projects like Wikipedia, OpenStreetMap and the world of open-source software are the kinds of constructive tools that I hoped would flow from the web,” he said in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/24/opinion/world-wide-web.html">New York Times</a> (NYT) opinion piece on Sunday (Nov. 24).</p>
      <p>He also went so far as to say that governments “should impose an immediate ban on targeted political advertising.” </p>
      <p>In <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/internet-of-things/2019/berners-lee-web-misused/">March</a> he said, “If we give up on building a better web now, then the web will not have failed us — we will have failed the web.”</p>
