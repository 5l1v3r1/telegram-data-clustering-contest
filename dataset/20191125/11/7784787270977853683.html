      <h1>LaMelo Ball just treated the NBL like his play toy in a performance the world will be talking about</h1>

      <h3>LaMelo Ball is as advertised, ladies and gentlemen.</h3>
      <p>If you didn’t already know, Monday evening’s (AEDT) performance was all the evidence one needed to see why the 18-year-old has a real chance at being the No. 1 overall pick in the 2020 NBA Draft.</p>
      <p>Ball finished with a triple-double - 32 points, 11 rebounds, and 13 assists - including a clutch three-pointer in the dying seconds of regulation to send the game to overtime, to lead the Illawarra Hawks to a thrilling 114-106 win over the Cairns Taipans.</p>

      <p>In what was arguably the best individual performance of any player during the 2019-20 NBL season, Ball shot 11-of-20 from the field, including 4-of-7 from downtown, to lift the Hawks to just their third win of their campaign.</p>
      <p>And, he did it in style.</p>
      <p>Ball was seemingly unstoppable as a ball-handler in the pick-and-roll, had his jump-shot working better than we’ve seen all season, and used his impressive hesitation dribble a number of times to get to the rim for some crafty finishes.</p>
      <p>Then, down three with 14 seconds to play, Ball dribbled down the court and pulled up from 28-feet, splashing home his fourth three-pointer to give the fans in WIN Stadium free basketball.</p>

      <p>The Hawks managed to carry that momentum into the overtime period, earning the victory, with Ball notching his first triple-double as a professional.</p>
      <p>“I think everyone saw tonight what he’s capable of,” Hawks head coach, Matt Flinn, said after the win.</p>
      <p>“We see it pretty regularly in practice when the doors are closed. It was really nice for him to get into a flow. He just impacts the game in so many different ways. It’s exciting to be a part of.</p>
      <p>“It’s also the way he brings his teammates into the game as well. There’s so many good players in the league, but the really great ones make everyone around them better, and I think we saw, tonight, how he can bring other people into the game.”</p>

      <p>Tim Coenraad came off the bench for 27 points for the Hawks - including 6-of-8 from downtown - while Sunday Dech had 15 points of his own for the home team.</p>
      <p>For the Taipans, who are now 4-7 on the season, Scott Machado led the way with 22 points and 13 assists.</p>
      <p>Ball is a member of the Hawks as part of the NBL’s Next Stars program, and his growth over the course of the season has been demonstrable. After starting the season shooting poorly from beyond the arc, the point guard has connected on just under 40 percent of his three-pointers over the Hawks’ past five games.</p>
      <p>An unfortunate Achilles injury to Aaron Brooks meant Ball has been forced to carry more of the Hawks’ load for the past few weeks, and he’s answered the call with some impressive all-round performances.</p>
