      <p>Police have shared a picture of loose horses who were found wandering around a country lane in Barrow-on-Trent.</p>
      <p>Officers from Derbyshire Police had just started a night shift last night, November 24, when they came across the three horses.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/burton/lorry-driver-blocks-road-after-3557556">Swadlincote Response Unit</a> wrote on Twitter: "Group two's night shift started off with a mare of a job!"</p>
      <p>All the horses were returned to where they had come from and are safe and well, police confirmed.</p>
      <p>Police have been asked in which road, and what time, the horses were found, but said they could not find that information.</p>
