      <p>Who says you need to wait til <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/best-cell-phone-deals">Black Friday</a> to get a good deal on this 55-inch Hisense 4K Android TV? You don't. Best Buy has already put it on sale for its Black Friday price. Allowing you to save big, without having to deal with lines or a glitchy website on Friday.</p>
      <p>The Hisense H6500F series Android TV is a really good one to get ahead of Black Friday. It is a whooping $160 off of its regular price right now, coming in at just $219.</p>
      <p>Keep in mind, that this is for the 55-inch model. If you're looking for something bigger, the same TV comes in a 65-inch model and it will be $299 on Black Friday â€“ it's currently still listed at $499, so it didn't get the early Black Friday treatment.</p>

      <p>This TV from Hisense is a pretty good one. It's a mid-tier TV, so don't expect it to be the best of the best for Hisense, and especially not at this price.</p>
      <p>It's a ULED TV, like all of Hisense's TVs. It's a 4K HDR TV and it does also support Dolby Vision. This is great for those that watch a lot of Dolby content. And Netflix has plenty of Dolby Vision content available for streaming too.</p>
      <p>With Dolby Vision, you're going to be getting some really good picture quality and some incredible colors on this TV. The colors are going to be more vibrant and crisp than without Dolby Vision. Think of HDR but on steroids.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>This TV does have Android TV built-in. And there's all of the big name apps that you come to love. Including Netflix, Hulu, Google Play Movies &amp; TV, YouTube, Amazon Prime Video, Disney+ and so much more.</p>
