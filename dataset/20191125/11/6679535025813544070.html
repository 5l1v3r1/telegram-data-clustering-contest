      <h1>Sriramulu’s meeting with GT Deve Gowda sparks speculation</h1>

      <p>Minister for Health B Sriramulu on Monday met former Minister and senior JD-S leader G T Deve Gowda at his residence here, fuelling political speculation. Mr. Gowda has remained “neutral” in the run up to the bypolls in Hunsur constituency, which he has represented in the past.</p>
      <p>However, Mr Sriramulu, who has been campaigning in Hunsur, claimed that they did not discuss politics.</p>
      <p>After felicitating Mr Gowda, Mr Sriramulu told reporters that he came to meet the JD-S leader since it was his birthday. “I wished him on his birthday and prayed the almighty to give him enough strength to protect the interests of the people. Leaving aside politics, we have remained like a family and kept good relations,” he claimed.</p>
      <p>Mr Gowda, an MLA from Chamundeshwari constituency, turned 70 on Monday. The Vokkaliga leader has distanced himself from the JD-S and stayed away from campaigning in Hunsur. He has not yet announced his support in the by-election and leaders from both the Congress and the BJP have been approaching him for his support.</p>
      <p>Speaking to reporters here, Mr Gowda said Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa and former CM Siddaramaiah have sought his support. Likewise, the candidates from all three parties have sought his support in Hunsur. “I have decided to remain neutral,” he replied.</p>
      <p>He said the JD-S never gave him leadership in his political career but he emerged as a leader and developed the party.</p>
      <p>“I wanted to see Mr H D Kumaraswamy as the CM again. But the JD-S did not see me as a leader,” he said, expressing his displeasure with the JD-S.</p>
