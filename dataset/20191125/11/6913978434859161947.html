      <p><b>VENICE -</b> Torrential rains across northern Italy and southern France killed three people at the weekend, sweeping away part of a motorway viaduct in northern Italy and causing fresh flooding in Venice on Sunday.<br/><br/>The rains, which left at least three people dead and two missing across the two countries, were the latest in a two-week wave of extreme weather in the region.<br/><br/>Part of a viaduct serving Italy's A6 motorway near Savona in the northern region of Liguria running between Turin and France was washed away by what appeared to be a mudslide, leaving a 30-meter gap in the road.<br/><br/>The emergency services did not immediately find any victims at the site, but sniffer dogs and helicopters were checking the area.<br/><br/>Pictures of the damage revived memories of the 2018 collapse of the Morandi bridge at Genoa, only 50 kilometers away, which claimed 43 lives.<br/><br/>In the Piedmont region, a 52-year-old woman who was missing after her car was swept away when a river burst its banks was found dead Sunday. Local media reported that two other people in the car had managed to escape in time.<br/><br/>The worst hit region in Italy was Alessandria, south of Turin, where 200 people were evacuated and 600 left stranded. One woman was reported missing, Italian media said.<br/><br/>Another 500 people were evacuated further north in the Aosta Valley, where roads were closed because of the risk of avalanches.<br/><br/>On the east coast, Venice was again hit by the floods that have paralyzed the city in recent days, though the levels were well off the historic peak reached on November 12.<br/><br/>The floodwaters in St Mark's Square in the city center were at knee-height, and were beginning to recede by the afternoon.<br/><br/>Venice's mayor has said the damage of the flooding earlier in the month could amount to one million euros, blaming the near-record water level rise on climate change.<br/><br/>The recent flooding of the city, a UNESCO World Heritage site, damaged dozens of churches.<br/><br/>The latest floods came as environmental activists staged a demonstration protesting the city's inadequate flood protection program and calling for a ban on the massive cruise ships that visit the Renaissance city.<br/><br/>Ecologists argue that the development of the large industrial port of Marghera, opposite Venice, was also taking a cost. -AFP</p>
