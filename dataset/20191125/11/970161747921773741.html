      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/25/uber-banned-london-midnight-losing-licence-battle-11213996/">Uber has been stripped of its licence to operate in London</a> after a number of safety breaches were identified by Transport for London.</p>
      <p>TFL said that they had identified ‘several breaches that placed passengers and their safety at risk’, and that it ‘does not have confidence that similar issues will not reoccur in the future, which has led it to conclude that the company is not fit and proper at this time.</p>
      <p>The company’s existing licence expires at 11.59pm tonight – but what does this mean for Uber customers?</p>
      <p>Here’s what you need to know about the future of Uber…</p>
      <h3>Why has Uber been stripped of its licence in London?</h3>
      <p>Uber lost its licence after TflL said it was not ‘fit and proper’ to be a licence holder – despite having made changes to the way it is run.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>Transport for London said it had <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/25/tfl-found-14000-uber-trips-driver-wasnt-registered-car-drove-11214268/">found that in at least 14,000 Uber trips,</a> drivers had uploaded photos of themselves to the app linked to cars which they were not registered to drive, meaning passengers were being picked up by drivers who were not named or authorised by the company.</p>

      <p>‘A key issue identified was that a change to Uber’s systems allowed unauthorised drivers to upload their photos to other Uber driver accounts,’ Tfl explained.</p>
      <p>‘This allowed them to pick up passengers as though they were the booked driver, which occurred in at least 14,000 trips – putting passenger safety and security at risk.’</p>
      <p>They added: ‘This means all the journeys were uninsured and some passenger journeys took place with unlicensed drivers, one of which had previously had their licence revoked by Tfl.’</p>
      <p>Helen Chapman, director of licensing, regulation and charging at TfL, said: Safety is our absolute top priority. While we recognise Uber has made improvements, it is unacceptable that Uber has allowed passengers to get into minicabs with drivers who are potentially unlicensed and uninsured.</p>
      <p>‘It is clearly concerning that these issues arose, but it is also concerning that we cannot be confident that similar issues won’t happen again in future.</p>
      <h3>What does Uber losing its licence in London mean for customers?</h3>
      <p>As it stands, Uber’s licence is set to expire just before midnight tonight.</p>
      <p>However the company has said <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/25/uber-vows-fight-tfl-licence-scrapped-london-11214418/">it plans to appeal the decision</a>, and they will be allowed to continue to operate during this process.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>During this time they will have the opportunity to demonstrate whether they have put new safety measures in place to eliminate potential safety risks to passengers.</p>
      <p>If the appeal goes ahead it means customers are unlikely to be affected for the time being since the company will continue to operate.</p>
      <p>The company previously lost its licence due to safety concerns in 2017 but was granted a 15-month extension on appeal.</p>
      <h3>Can you still order taxis on Uber?</h3>

      <p>As the company will continue to be operational during the appeal process, you’ll still be able to book cabs for the time being.</p>
      <p>Obviously if the appeal succeeds and Uber gets a new licence it will be business as usual, but that could change if they lose their appeal.</p>
      <p>Uber’s regional general manager for northern and eastern Europe, Jamie Heywood, said they would be operating as normal during the appeal process.</p>
      <p>‘We have fundamentally changed our business over the last two years and are setting the standard on safety. TfL found us to be a fit and proper operator just two months ago, and we continue to go above and beyond,’ he said.</p>
      <p>‘On behalf of the 3.5 million riders and 45,000 licensed drivers who depend on Uber in London, we will continue to operate as normal and will do everything we can to work with TfL to resolve this situation.’</p>
      <p>While Uber remains hugely popular there are a number of other cab apps now available in London, including Bolt (formerly known as Taxify), and Kapten, both of which launched in the capital earlier this year, as well as shared ride service Via Van.</p>

      <p>Another ride-hailing company, Ola, has launched elsewhere in the country and is making plans to debut after being given a licence by Transport for London.</p>
