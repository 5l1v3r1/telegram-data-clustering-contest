      <p>• Ensure mass mobilisation of all communities to promote collective responsibility in the fight to eradicate violence against women and children.<br/>• Encourage society to acknowledge that violence against women and children is not a government or criminal justice system problem, but a societal problem, and that failure to view it as such results in all efforts failing to eradicate this scourge in our communities.<br/>• Emphasise the fact that the solution lies with all of us.</p>
