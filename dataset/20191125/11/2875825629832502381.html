      <p>Love Island's Joanna Chimonides has hinted that she has rekindled her romance with ex Michael Griffiths.</p>
      <p>The brunette beauty, 23, was unable to resist gushing over the former firefighter after he posted a shirtless snap onto <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> over the weekend.</p>
      <p>The Love Island hunk, 28, posed up a storm in the saucy photo that showed his heavily tattooed body oiled up under a black waistcoat emblazoned with SWAT on the chest.</p>
      <p>He completed his fancy dress ensemble with black jeans that were unzipped to expose his black underpants and his belt loops were decorated with a pair of silver handcuffs.</p>

      <p>Explaining what the temperature spiking snap was for, he captioned the post: "So that’s it the wait is over, heading into 2020 I’ll be joining the @dreamboys on tour to put my stripping skills to the test.</p>
      <p>"I will also be taking a seat on the judging panel at the dreamboys live auditions on DEC 14th in London, so if you want to help me decide who should join the dreamboys, head over to their page for tickets #dreamboysuk #dreamboystour #loveisland #ladsontour."</p>
      <p>Proving the snap got her hot under the collar, Joanna who was coupled-up with Michael on Love Island after he fell for her in Casa Amor, commented: "Oh Christ almighty."</p>

      <p>Some fans replied to the reality TV bombshell after spotting her message.</p>
      <p>One urged her to back off, as they penned: " <a href="https://www.instagram.com/joannachimonides/">@joannachimonides</a> move on huni you had your chance!"</p>
      <p>Another encouraged her to reconnect with her ex, as they added: "Listen huni if u want him go for it ye dont listen to them just jealous coz u can get someone who fit as f**k."</p>
      <p>It is not the first time the pair have reignited romance rumours as they were spotted kissing at Kisstory on The Common Festival in July - which Joanna denied despite snaps emerging of them locking lips.</p>

      <p>Over the summer, Michael was branded a 'snake' by Joanna after he decided to stay in the villa instead of walking out with her, after she was voted out by viewers and then her fellow islanders.</p>
      <p>Joanna, had previously said that she had no plans of 'going back there' when it comes to Michael.</p>
      <p>She challenged Michael to explain what had happened when he effectively brought an end to their relationship by deciding to stay.</p>

      <p>Joanna said: "I just want to hear him out and respect his wishes by allowing him to do that. And I would like to hear him out because I’d like to know exactly what went on there.</p>
      <p>"I’m not sure there is a future but for now we need to get on with it and if it’s meant to be it will be."</p>
