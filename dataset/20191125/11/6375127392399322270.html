      <h3>NORTHPORT won and lived to fight another day with a 115-90 victory over top-ranked NLEX in a heated PBA Governors’ Cup quarterfinals duel at the Smart Araneta Coliseum last night.</h3>
      <p>Michael Qualls came through with 39 points, 16 rebounds and five assists while Christian Standhardinger also produced a double-double effort of 24 points and 13 boards for the Batang Pier.</p>
      <p>Things went chippy in the final 4:54, as Road Warriors slotman Poy Erram was ejected with a flagrant foul penalty 2.</p>
      <p>Following a wild drive, Qualls stepped on NLEX’s Paul Varilla as they were falling to the floor. That apparently didn’t sit well for Erram, who charged at the NorthPort import, hitting him with an elbow to the back of his head.</p>
      <p>Varilla was also tossed out for a flagrant foul penalty 2 on Standhardinger during the incident.</p>
      <p>In another play, Philip Paniamogan was slapped with an flagrant foul penalty 1 on an elbow to the gut of Standhardinger.</p>
      <p>After a promising 8-1 start, the Road Warriors dropp their last three contests, including two against the surging Batang Pier.</p>
      <p>NorthPort led by as much as 26 points at one point.</p>
      <p>The do-or-die match for a spot in the semifinals is set tomorrow at the Big Dome.</p>
      <p>JR Quiñahan led NLEX with 20 points while Kiefer Ravena added 16 in his return to the PBA playoffs.</p>
      <p>The Road Warriors entered the playoffs as the top seed, but have yet to recover after a wobbly end to their elims stint. They have now lost three straight games, twice to the rejuvenated Batang Pier.</p>
      <p>The status of the two is now in the hands of Commissioner Willie Marcial.</p>
      <p>The scores: </p>
      <p>NorthPort (115) - Qualls 39, Standhardinger 24, Anthony 12, Ferrer 9, King 8, Escoto 5, Taha 5, Elorde 5, Lanete 3, Cruz 3, Mercado 2.</p>
      <p>NLEX (90) - Quiñahan 20, Ravena 16, Harris 12, Cruz 11, Erram 6, Soyud 6, Alas 5, Paniamogan 4, Varilla 3, Galanza 3, Ighalo 2, Miranda 2, Fonacier 0.</p>
      <p>Quarterscores: 34-24, 61-40, 83-64, 115-90</p>
