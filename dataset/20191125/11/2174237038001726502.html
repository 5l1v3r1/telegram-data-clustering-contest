      <p><a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/10-best-korn-songs-of-all-time">Korn</a> have released a live video showcasing their track <i>Cold</i>.</p>
      <p>The Sebastien Paquet-directed promo was captured at Korn’s launch event for latest studio album <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/reviews/korns-the-nothing-recaptures-the-genuine-darkness-of-their-earlier-works"><i>The Nothing</i></a>, which arrived in September and was filmed by Paquet, Dayne Malan, Edwin Daboub, Melissa Castro and Luke Schlink.</p>
      <p>In <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/korns-the-nothing-your-ultimate-track-by-track-guide"><i>Metal Hammer</i>’s track-by-track guide to <i>The Nothing</i></a>, we described <i>Cold</i> as “undeniably old school from the get-go," adding: "The track showcases each member's talents, digging into the band's earlier sound yet still managing to stay vital and fresh. </p>
      <p>“<a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/inside-korn-singer-jonathan-davis-house-of-taxidermy">Jonathan Davis</a> really goes for it on the vocals with this one displaying some of the most diverse singing in his career thus far – his classic melodies and distinctive scatting juxtaposed against some seriously seething growls and wailing that's so spot on it could be mistaken for a synth.</p>
      <p>“It's the perfect balance of Korn-shaped funky chugs, crushing, frenzied breakdowns and powerful, stadium-ready choruses.”</p>
      <p>In October, <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/news/korn-and-breaking-benjamin-announce-joint-2020-tour">Korn announced a joint North American tour</a> with <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/breaking-benjamin-first-uk-show-interview-and-review">Breaking Benjamin</a> which will kick off at Allentown’s PPL Center on January 23 and wrap up at Fresno’s Save Mart Center on March 1.</p>
