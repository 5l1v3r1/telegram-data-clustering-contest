      <h1>Everton's next manager odds: David Moyes favourite to replace Marco Silva at Goodison Park</h1>

        <b>David Moyes is favourite to become Everton's next permanent manager amid suggestions Marco Silva is on his way out of Goodison Park.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Toffees' <b><a href="https://www.sportinglife.com/football/news/watch-premier-league-highlights/174370">2-0 home defeat to Norwich</a></b> was their seventh in 13 Premier League games this season and the Portuguese boss is under increased scrutiny after boos were ringing around home sections of the stadium and fans joined in with chants of 'you're getting sacked in the morning'.</p>
      <p>The Everton board now have a big decision to make and Silva is <b><a href="https://m.skybet.com/football/manager-specials/event/24312956?aff=688&amp;dcmp=SL_ED_FOOTBALL_Moyes">odds-on favourite with Sky Bet</a></b> to be the next top flight manager to leave his job, with the Blues reportedly considering bringing back Moyes.</p>
      <p>The Scot knows the club inside out having spent 11 years on Merseyside as manager before leaving for an ill-fated spell at Manchester United.</p>
      <p>After disappointment in Spain with Real Sociedad, his most recent post was a seven-month stint as West Ham boss in 2017/18, where he guided the Hammers to survival and he could be seen as the man to now steer Everton clear of the bottom three - which they are currently just four points clear of.</p>
      <p>Moyes is <b><a href="https://m.skybet.com/football/manager-specials/event/24741431?aff=688&amp;dcmp=SL_ED_FOOTBALL_Moyes">11/8 with Sky Bet to be Everton's next permanent manager</a></b>, with David Unsworth 6/1, Bournemouth's Eddie Howe at 7/2 and former midfielder Mikel Arteta at 7/1.</p>

      <p>Sam Allardyce, the man who Silva replaced at the helm, admitted on talkSPORT that players are not playing for their boss.</p>
      <p>“I wanted to go and build Everton the right way," he said. "The long term future was about getting the recruitment right and building the club through a period of a team going into the new stadium.</p>
      <p>“I was brought in to stabilise the club and sadly no more than that. From where I was, I thought I could take the club forward.</p>
      <p>“There was a lot to be done in recruitment terms and making sure mistakes that were made before I got there weren’t repeated. It doesn’t look like that has been the case.</p>
      <p>“Even though a lot of money has been spent again, there are some good players in some areas but some areas that are still weak.</p>
      <p>"They have already lost four games at home and Everton’s home record has always been the strength of the team.</p>
      <p>“It needs some stability again and they need to get themselves in a reasonable position this season and see where they go from there.”</p>
