      <h2>Barcelona’s attacking trio of Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Antoine Griezmann have fired the Catalans to the top of La Liga despite the latter struggling for form</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T11:15:31+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 11:15</time> by <a rel="author">Dan Gibbs</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fc-barcelona">Barcelona</a> star Antoine Griezmann has quashed rumours of any rifts between himself and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/lionel-messi">Lionel Messi</a> and Luis Suarez, insisting the trio go for dinner together.</p>
      <p>The France World Cup winner made the switch from Atletico Madrid to Barcelona last summer in a £107m transfer.</p>
      <p>Life at the Nou Camp has not been easy in his early days though having bagged just four La Liga goals and reports of a rift with Messi often talked about in the Spanish press.</p>
      <p>But Griezmann has downplayed the rumours, claiming he is a ’shy’ person who is still getting to know his new team-mates.</p>
      <p>“I am really shy and I have trouble going to talk to others,” Griezmann told the UEFA website.</p>

      <p>“I am not the type of person who will start the conversation, I am too shy.</p>
      <p>“Luis, Leo and I know each other, we have dinner together and our relationship can only progress over time.</p>
      <p>“It is obvious that what can happen on the pitch can only help us feel comfortable when we play. ”</p>
      <p>Despite helping fire Barca to the top of La Liga, two points clear of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> , Griezmann has failed to replicate the form he displayed at Atletico that saw him regularly attract interest from <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> .</p>

      <p>The forward puts his early struggles down to a ‘lack of confidence’ as he continues to try and sing from the same hymn sheet on the pitch as his team-mates.</p>
      <p>"I'm in the process of learning and understanding how my team-mates play as everything is new to me,” Griezmann said.</p>
      <p>“I’m still trying to read the runs and off the ball movement from the likes of Luis Suárez, Leo Messi and Ousmane Dembélé along with the midfielders.</p>
      <p>“It's my intention to get to grips with this as soon as possible so I can offer my all to the team but at times it's tricky.</p>
      <p>“At present when I get the ball I have a certain lack of confidence in when to pass or when to shoot on goal, this I'm sure is something that will change with the passing of time.”</p>
      <p>Barcelona’s feared trio will be in action again against Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League on Wednesday night.</p>
