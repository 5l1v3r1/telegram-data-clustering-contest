      <p>King Tommen is the latest addition to the growing list of people who want to see the alternate ending to <i><a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/game-of-thrones/">Game of Thrones.</a></i></p>
      <p>Tommen Baratheon actor Dean Charles Chapman has been out doing press for his latest film, the war drama <i>1917</i>, but that hasn't stopped the conversation from shifting back to his <i>Game of Thrones</i> roots.</p>

      <p><a href="https://comicbook.com/tv-shows/2019/11/24/titans-nightwing-promo-photos-reveal-our-best-look-yet/">TMZ</a> flagged Chapman down as the actor signed autographs for fans and asked him his thoughts about the supposed alternate <i>Game of Thrones</i> cut. He supported the release of a new ending, saying, "Yeah, why not? Yeah, exactly. I know that there are spinoffs as well, so it might be good."</p>

      <p>Earlier this month, Kristofer Hivju -- the actor who played Tormund Giantsbane -- turned heads when he spoke about an alternate ending that was shot for <i>Game of Thrones</i>. "Well, we shot an alternative ending. That was mostly for fun but I don't know if I'm allowed to tell you about that. I won't tell you, but it was fun!" Hivju told <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/game-thrones-cast-filmed-alternative-ending-season-8-well-never-see-reveals-tormund-star-kristofer-hivju-11179830/">Metro</a>. It is unclear how serious Hivju was being when he mentioned the alternate cut.</p>

      <p>With the massive secrecy surrounding the final season of the <i>Game of Thrones</i>, what Hivju may be talking about is a fake ending to stop the spread of spoilers and misinformation. However, until HBO or the show's creators step in to clear things up, fans will continue to wonder if there was a different ending for some of their favorite characters.</p>
      <p><i>Game of Thrones</i> stars Peter Dinklage as Tyrion Lannister, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau as Jaime Lannister, Lena Headey as Cersei Lannister, Emilia Clarke as Daenerys Targaryen, Sophie Turner as Sansa Stark, Maisie Williams as Arya Stark and Kit Harington as Jon Snow.</p>
