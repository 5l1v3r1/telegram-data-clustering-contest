      <p>ISLAMABAD (Dunya News) – A two-member bench of Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Monday will hear petition against sentence of ex-prime minister Nawaz Sharif in Al-Azizia reference.</p>
      <p>According to details, a plea seeking exemption of Nawaz Sharif from the hearing has also been submitted in the court.  </p>
      <p>Earlier on October 30, IHC had granted bail to former premier for eight weeks to obtain medical treatment.</p>
      <p>“In case the indisposition of petitioner No.2 (Nawaz Sharif) continues, he before the expiry of period of eight weeks may approach the Government of Punjab under Section 401 (2) Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 and until the decision of the Provincial Government on the application, he shall continue to remain on bail. However, if petitioner No. 2 does not approach the Provincial Government within the period mentioned hereinabove this order shall cease to have effect on lapse of period of eight weeks and the bail granted shall stand revoked/cancelled,” the IHC announced.</p>
      <p>The decision came after 69-year-old was taken to Services Hospital when his blood platelet count dropped to dangerous levels. <br/><br/>MS Dr Saleem informed that the former PM had suffered heart attack when injections and steroids were given to him to raise the count of platelets.<br/><br/>Sharif was sentenced to seven years in prison in the Al-Azizia Steel Mills corruption reference on 24 December 2018. Rs1.5 billion and US $25 million fine, a disqualification of 10 years from holding any public office was part of the sentences awarded to the former premier.</p>
