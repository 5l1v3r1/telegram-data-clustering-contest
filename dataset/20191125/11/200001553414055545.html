      <h1>‘No exaggeration’ – Suggestion Leeds United could tussle with PSG for signing</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T11:45:59+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 11:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/author/annie/" target="_blank">Sport Witness Team</a></address>
      <p>In March of this year it was reported in Italy that <a href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/leeds-united-eyeing-uruguay-international-competition-serie/">Leeds United were keen on Nahitan Nandez</a>, who at the time played for Boca Juniors.</p>
      <p>The Championship club were said to be ‘studying’ the midfielder, along with Cagliari, Fiorentina and Sampdoria. Cagliari had already initiated contact for a potential summer signing, and it was they who got the player several months later.</p>
      <p>He’s been doing well in Italy and that’s leading to further claims of a transfer. <a href="https://www.calciomercatonews.com/2019/11/23/calciomercato-inter-milan-napoli-che-asta-per-nandez/">CalcioMercatoWeb</a> report there’s growing interest and it’s stated that from England it’s Leeds United and Hull City who are keen.</p>
      <p>That’s when the claims go up a gear with it being stated attention needs to be given to a possible PSG swoop, and that there’s interest from big clubs in Spain.</p>
      <p>That sounds like a big jump, but the Italian website is insistent, saying it’s ‘no exaggeration’ to make such claims, and that Nandez’s form in Italy is winning him more fans.</p>
      <p>Inter Milan, AC Milan and Napoli are also credited with an interest, and for Leeds to stand any chance they’d surely have to secure promotion to the Premier League.</p>
