      <p>Jose Mourinho has been credited with opening the door for Portuguese coaches all over Europe by the manager of Tottenham Hotspur’s Champions League opponents Olympiacos.</p>
      <p>Pedro Martins is one of a number of Portuguese coaches working in Europe and brings his Olympiacos team to London to face Mourinho and Spurs on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>Martins, who first faced a Mourinho team as a player when the former Chelsea manager was in charge of Uniao Leiria and he was a midfielder at Alverca, eventually wants to follow Mourinho to the Premier League.</p>
      <p>But, for now, the 49-year-old is just thankful for the opportunities he believes Mourinho helped to create for the likes of himself, Marco Silva, Nuno Espirito Santo, Leonardo Jardim and Paulo Fonseca.</p>
      <p>“Mourinho is important because he changed our minds and our methodology when he was in Porto,” said Martins. “He came from Barcelona and showed us a different game, how he watched the game.</p>

      <p>“Before, our methodology was about training and football, but he taught us to put everything into the football. So even when the team is training, the players are thinking about how they can use it to be better footballers. He changed this.”</p>
      <p>Other than Mourinho and, before him, Carlos Queiroz, Martins puts the success of Portuguese coaches down to the financial crisis that hit his country 10 years ago.</p>
      <p>“In Portugal, 10 years ago we had big problems, financial problems,” said Martins. “Our school was good with Quieroz and then Mourinho, we learned a lot from them, and the big financial crisis brought a big opportunity for Portuguese coaches.</p>
      <p>“The big clubs opened the doors for Portuguese coaches and without money we have the creativity, we have the passion to do our best with what we have. We also learned a lot and shared a lot of ideas between us in times of crisis, so it was very important for us.”</p>
      <p>Martins is the first coach in the last decade to take Olympiacos into the group stages of the Champions League, having also become the first coach to start a second successive season at the club since 2006.</p>
      <p>Olympiacos are top of the Greek Super League, still undefeated, but are bottom of Champions League B, despite drawing 2-2 with Tottenham in September.</p>
      <p>Martins, though, insists his team still want to try to qualify for the Europa League by finishing third, which would also boost his hopes of one day following Mourinho to England.</p>
      <p>“England is the mother of the football, so everybody who has a passion for the sport wants to achieve that,” said Martins. “Now, I feel very good in Olympiacos, but in the future, yes, I would like to work in England because the atmosphere is different in the Premier League.”</p>
      <p>On his short-term goal, Martins added: “All the time we knew it would be very difficult for us in the Champions League this season, because we are in one of the toughest groups. But we still want to fight and try to get into the Europa League.</p>
      <p>“It’s important also to show good football and put across a good image of ourselves. We know it will be tough to finish third, but it is still possible and we will fight for that. We will come to London to fight for our position.”</p>
