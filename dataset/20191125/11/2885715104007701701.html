      <p>British actor Henry Cavill has said that he is not out as Superman yet in DC films. The actor played the role last time in 2017’s Justice League.</p>
      <p>The superhero team-up movie was not received well and also bombed at the box office. After that Warner Bros restructured the leadership at DC Films and prioritised independent superhero films rather than a cinematic universe.</p>
      <p>Cavill told Mens’ Health, “It’s still mine. I’m not going to sit quietly in the dark as all the stuff is going on. I’ve not given up the role. There’s a lot I have to give for Superman yet. A lot of storytelling to do. A lot of real, true depths to the honest of the character I wasn’t to get into.”</p>
      <p>He added, “I want to reflect the comic books. That’s important to me. There’s a lot of justice to be done for Superman. The status is: You’ll see.”</p>
      <p>There has been no confirmation or denial from Warner Bros regarding the fate of Cavill’s Superman. The actor appeared in the role for the first time in 2013’s Man of Steel and reprised the role in Batman v Superman in 2016.</p>
      <p>After Ben Affleck quit the role of Batman in the wake of Justice League’s disaster, it was expected that Cavill would follow suit. But despite taking up another time-intensive role like Geralt of Rivia in Netflix’s The Witcher series, the actor has clearly not admitted defeat and still hopes he will don Superman’s cape again.</p>
