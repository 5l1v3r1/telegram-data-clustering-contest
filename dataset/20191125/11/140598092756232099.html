      <h1>The official top 12 toys of Christmas 2019</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T11:33:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 11:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/precious-adesina/" target="_blank">Precious Adesina</a></address>
      <blockquote>
        <b>Still deciding what to get the kids for <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/christmas/">Christmas</a>? Call off the search, as the official list of this year’s must-have toys has landed.</b>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Every year, the Toy Retailers Association predicts which 12 toys will be festive sell-outs with their <a href="https://www.toyretailersassociation.co.uk/dream-toys">DreamToys</a> list. Chosen by an independent panel of small and large retailers including Argos, <a href="http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=3539&amp;awinaffid=73846&amp;clickref=customid&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.selfridges.com%2FGB%2Fen%2F">Selfridges</a> and Hamleys, the list has a proven track record of anticipating the year's biggest hitters. "I’d say we normally get 9 out of 12 of them right," says Gary Grant, who chairs the DreamToys committee.</p>
      <p>The hunt for the year’s best toys starts with an original list of more than 300, from which 70 are then put forward to a panel of toy retail experts, who analyse them, test them and come up with the final twelve. To avoid bias, any toy deemed too obscure, or only recommended by one retailer is ruled out. </p>
      <p>So what have these toys got in common? For DreamToys, the biggest indicators of success are ones associated with movies, collectibles and big brand names such as <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-gb">LEGO</a> and <a href="https://barbie.mattel.com/en-us/about/60th-anniversary.html">Barbie</a>, which both have products on the list. According to global toys industry analyst Frédérique Tutt, while a toy needs to be original to catch people’s attention, its chance of success skyrockets if it’s from a well-known brand.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Barbie, whose Dreamplane Playset appears on the list, has been a top seller for over 40 years and this year, sales are up 30 per cent. But it’s LEGO that continues to fly off the shelves, and the panel believe the Harry Potter Knight Bus will be 2019’s best-seller from the LEGO range. With film-licensed toys comprising 10 per cent of all toy sales in 2019, they’re predicting success for our favourite Toy Story 4 characters, too. </p>
      <p>So if you want to make sure the kids' faces light up on Christmas morning, don't hang around, as these toys sell out — fast.</p>
      <h3>Best kids toys for Christmas 2019</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Barbie has consistently been a top seller this year. Tutt says: “Mattel has been focusing on women’s empowerment, reinventing the message around Barbie. With Barbie, you can be anything.” To reflect this, the dolls have been remodelled in all shapes, colours and sizes. The Dreamplane Playset includes a transforming plane, a puppy and snack cart among other accessories.</p>

        <figcaption>Blume Dolls (Skyrocket)  Credit: Argos</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The Blume doll is by far the cheapest item on this year’s list. Add water and a new fashion-forward friend “blumes” in front of you. It comes in 22 different, over-the-top characters with clothes you can mix and match.“For me, I love the Blume doll and at a £10 price point, I think it’s really great value,” Ward says. Six-year-old Trilyna, who was given a chance to try out all 12 top toys, picked the Blume Doll as the one she would most love to take home.</p>

      <p>Elsa’s singing doll from the original Frozen movie was the most successful doll in the Frozen Disney range. DreamToys believe history will repeat itself with the new movie, which hits the big screen later this month. “Frozen was the second most successful movie of all time in the UK in terms of toy sales so people's expectations are high,” Tutt says. </p>

      <p>“A Christmas Day that didn’t involve tripping over bits of lego while I go and get the turkey out of the oven would not be Christmas,” Ward says. And, as LEGO is such a dominant force in the toy industry, this is probably true for families across the UK. Head of Marketing UK/Ireland Marius Lang believes kids will love the chance to keep building on what they’ve already imagined from the Harry Potter books: “You can take LEGO bricks from 60 years ago and  just click them together and let your creativity run wild.” </p>

It’s already looking as if there’s not going to be enough,” Grant adds. </p>
