      <h1>Hotel collapse: ICE says no deportation Monday</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T11:46:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 11:46</time> by <a rel="author">KNOE</a></address>

      <p>A federal immigration spokesman says a construction worker hurt in the partial collapse of a New Orleans hotel won’t be deported Monday. An attorney for Delmer Joel Ramirez Palma of Honduras tells The Associated Press that an investigator with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s whistleblower and retaliation division had plans to interview him.</p>
      <p>Attorney Mary Yanik says someone from OSHA had told her Ramirez Palma would be deported Monday afternoon.</p>
      <p>But regional immigration spokesman Bryan Cox tells The AP in an email Monday that “rumors of his removal today are not accurate.”</p>
      <p>Yanik says if that’s true, it’s a relief.</p>
      <p>She says Ramirez Palma was arrested two days after the Oct. 12 collapse that killed three people and injured dozens more. His initial deportation order was issued in 2016.</p>

      <p>A construction worker hurt in the collapse of a New Orleans hotel may be deported to his home country of Honduras.</p>
      <p>The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate reports Delmer Joel Ramirez Palma was arrested by immigration authorities days after the Oct. 12 collapse that killed three people and injured dozens more. His initial deportation order was issued in 2016.</p>
      <p>Ramirez Palma had spoken out about unsafe conditions at the construction site. Advocates and attorneys say deporting him would complicate the probe into the collapse and silence other witnesses who are in the country without proper documentation.</p>
      <p>A New Orleans Workers’ Center for Racial Justice attorney and Ramirez Palma’s wife say they believe he may be deported Monday.</p>
      <p>Federal authorities say they won’t comment on deportation plans for security reasons.</p>
