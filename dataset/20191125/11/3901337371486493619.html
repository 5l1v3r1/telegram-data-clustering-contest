      <p>The Spaniard guided the Citizens to back-to-back league trophies, and could make it three in a row this season, but the defending champions have already lost three matches in this campaign.</p>
      <p>Guardiola has now insisted that winning the title is not the most important thing for him this season, but wants his players to continue fighting until the end of the campaign.</p>
      <p>"I think it's not a good message for society, for our kids, for our teenagers, showing them that just the winner is perfect," he said, as quoted by <i>ESPN</i>.</p>
      <p>"We are creating depressed people, loser people.</p>
      <p>"It is not. Important is the effort, the commitment, the situation. In football, I know we want to win but just win once and the other is disaster? It's not, it doesn't work in that way.</p>

      <p>"That's why I said to the players relax, do your job, we will see in December, January, February, March and we will see what position we are in.</p>
      <p>"If the position is far away, OK, it's far away. We are going to try again next season. If we lose, we lose.</p>
      <p>"But I promise you, when I see my team don't fight with no spirit or lack of intensity and desire, I'll say I don't like my team, I don't like the way they play.</p>
      <p>"In these three years and half, people can say we play good or bad, but give up? That is not going to happen. My teams, always we try, but I accept that the others can better."</p>
