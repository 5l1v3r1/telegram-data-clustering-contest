      <h1>Microsoft denies fudging Microsoft Teams Daily Active User numbers</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T11:30:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 11:30</time> by <a rel="author">Surur</a></address>
      <p>Microsoft recently announced<a href="https://mspoweruser.com/microsoft-teams-has-hit-20-million-daily-active-users-nearly-8-million-more-than-slack/"> that their Microsoft Teams app has 20 million daily active users</a> (DAU), significantly more than Slack.  Much doubt is being cast on how Microsoft Teams DAU are counted, however, with accusations that simply automatically launching the app at start-up is being counted as an active user.</p>

      <p>This view is also held by industry analysts.</p>
      <p>“We continue to view the MSFT threat as overblown and debate the meaning of ‘active,’ especially with auto-install and auto-startup,” said DA Davidson analysts Rishi Jaluria and Hannah Rudoff.</p>
      <p>Microsoft for its part has denied the accusations, with Jared Spataro, a corporate vice president at Microsoft,<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/24/microsoft-says-it-isnt-goosing-the-numbers-in-its-fight-with-slack.html"> telling CNBC</a> there are several activities that can cause a customer to be counted as a user, but that automatically launching the app was not one of them.</p>
      <p>Like Slack, these included making a call through Teams or starting a chat in the app. Slack said  to count as a DAU on their service a user needed to create or consume content in the app during a 24-hour period. This suggest Slack may even more liberal in counting DAU than Microsoft.</p>
      <p>Microsoft said they made sure “there’s no double-counting”, with Spataro saying “We feel really great about the way we define daily active users.”</p>
