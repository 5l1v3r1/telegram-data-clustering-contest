      <p>World Wide Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee on Monday unveiled a “Contract for the Web” to halt “misuse” by governments, companies and individuals, bringing several capitals and tech titans like Google aboard.</p>
      <p>“If we don’t act now — and act together — to prevent the web being misused by those who want to exploit, divide and undermine, we are at risk of squandering” its potential for good, Berners-Lee said in a statement from his World Wide Web Foundation.</p>
      <p>Credited with laying the groundwork for the web — the universe of multimedia webpages accessible via the internet — in 1989, the computer scientist has since last year been developing the so-called Contract for the Web.</p>
      <p>His unveiling of the final document Monday comes as government, business and civil society leaders gather in Berlin for the four-day UN Internet Governance Forum.</p>
      <p>Berners-Lee said his contract, developed in cooperation with dozens of experts and members of the public, is “a roadmap to build a better web”.</p>
      <p>He called on governments to “strengthen laws and regulations” and companies “to ensure the pursuit of profit is not at the expense of human rights and democracy”.</p>
      <p>“Citizens must hold those in power accountable, demand their digital rights be respected and help foster healthy conversation online,” Berners-Lee added.</p>
      <p>More than 150 organisations including companies like Google, Microsoft, Facebook and Reddit and interest groups like Reporters Without Borders and the Electronic Frontier Foundation have backed the plan.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the governments of France, Germany and Ghana are on board, as are thousands of individuals.</p>
      <p>“I will stand up for the preservation of the free internet that we have grown to know and love in recent decades,” German economy minister Peter Altmaier said in a statement ahead of the UN gathering.</p>
      <p>Berners-Lee originally conceived the web while working at European particle physics lab CERN, as a way for scientists around the world to share information about their research.</p>
      <p>But in recent years he has grown alarmed by abuse of the technology in society, business and politics.</p>
      <p>The WWW Foundation highlighted rising cyber-bullying, growing use of the web by politicians to manipulate news media and widespread online scams.</p>
      <p>It also noted that rates of web access in emerging economies lag far behind those in industrialised nations, with 46 percent of people worldwide not online.</p>
      <p>“We need real and durable involvement of emerging and developing countries,” Germany’s Altmaier said. “Free access to the internet must be a fundamental, human right, valid for people around the world.”</p>
      <p>As well as his “Contract for the Web”, Berners-Lee has looked to tackle the web’s issues from a technical angle, in 2018 launching a development platform called “Solid” aimed at giving users control of their data.</p>
