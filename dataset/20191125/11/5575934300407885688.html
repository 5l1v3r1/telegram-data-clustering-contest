      <p>Elon Musk has attempted to save face on Twitter after a demonstration meant to show off the toughness of Tesla’s new Cybertruck pickup went awry.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, he <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1198090787520598016">posted a short video to Twitter</a> meant to show the Cybertruck’s armoured glass windows to be stronger than the average car window.</p>
      <p>Here’s the new video, showing Tesla’s lead designer, Franz von Holzhausen, throwing what appeared to be a metal ball at the Cybertruck’s windows:</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Musk captioned the video: “Franz throws steel ball at Cybertruck window right before launch. Guess we have some improvements to make before production haha.”</p>
      <p>The result in the video was different from Thursday’s live Cybertruck unveiling, where the truck’s armoured glass dramatically <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/elon-musk-reaction-to-tesla-cybertruck-window-cracking-video-2019-11">cracked twice in a row after being hit by a metal ball</a>. During that demo, multiple hard objects were used to hit the truck, including a large sledgehammer.</p>
      <p>Though Musk laughed off the mishap onstage, exclaiming, “Oh my f—ing god” and “room for improvement,” the video went viral <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/tesla-stock-price-falls-electric-cybertruck-windows-break-live-demo-2019-11-1028711470">and Tesla’s stock price sank</a>.</p>
      <p>On Monday, Musk tried to explain why the windows had broken during the live demo but not in earlier tests.</p>
      <p>“Sledgehammer impact on door cracked base of glass, which is why steel ball didn’t bounce off,” he said. “Should have done steel ball on window, *then* sledgehammer the door. Next time …”</p>

      <p>The Cybertruck is Tesla’s bold, brash first foray into the pickup-truck market – a market it has gradually primed itself to enter as its battery technology has become more powerful. It is made from various tough-sounding materials, including stainless steel and ultra-strong “Armour” glass.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.tesla.com/cybertruck/design#battery">According to Tesla’s website</a>, Tesla plans to begin production of the Cybertruck, which starts at $US39,900, in late 2021. The vehicle’s most expensive version starts at $US69,900, and the company says it will have a maximum range of over 500 miles, a maximum towing capacity of over 14,000 pounds, and the ability to accelerate from zero to 60 mph in under 2.9 seconds.</p>
      <p>Musk wrote over the weekend that Tesla <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/cybertruck-orders-tesla-elon-musk-2019-11">had received 200,000 preorders</a> so far.</p>
