      <p>Zavvi has its own range of Mario Kart clothing, memorabilia, and metal number plates – but only for seven days and counting.</p>
      <p>Did you know Zavvi has an exclusive deal with Nintendo to make limited edition apparel based on its most famous games? We know we didn’t, but they’ve actually got a really nice range of T-shirts and tops based on <a href="https://www.zavvi.com/capsules/nintendo.list">Super Mario</a>, <a href="https://www.zavvi.com/legend-collection.list">The Legend Of Zelda</a>, and <a href="https://www.zavvi.com/elysium.search?search=luigi%27s+mansion+3">Luigi’s Mansion 3</a>.</p>
      <p>The Super Mario ones all seem to be sold out and the <a href="https://www.zavvi.com/capsules/mario-kart-racing.list">Mario Kart Racing</a> ones are guaranteed to be joining them soon… because they’re only going to be on sale for seven days.</p>
      <p>The range launched on Sunday, 24 November and will end this weekend, presumably never to be seen again – there’s even a countdown timer on the website.</p>

      <p>Why they’d want to limit something like that we don’t know but then Nintendo themselves can be very funny about their merchandise and things like the pop-up <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/22/pokemon-center-london-store-reopen-11201826/">Pokémon Center in London</a> that disappeared the moment Pokémon Sword and Shield was released.</p>

      <p>There are 25 items in the Mario Kart range, which includes T-Shirts, sweatshirts, and hoodies, but also caps, mugs, and extra limited edition (with only 100 of each design) metal number plates.</p>
      <p>Whether these items are being made available anywhere else in the world we’re not sure, but you’d have to assume so given a fair amount of effort seems to have been expended here, even just counting the Mario Kart Racing branding.</p>
      <p>It all seems to be part of Nintendo’s ongoing attempt to make use of its characters outside of just video games, including a <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/13/super-nintendo-world-theme-park-opens-next-spring-time-tokyo-olympics-10735646/">theme park</a> and new <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/get-load-exclusive-merch-new-nintendo-tokyo-store-11183658/">dedicated store</a> in Japan.</p>
