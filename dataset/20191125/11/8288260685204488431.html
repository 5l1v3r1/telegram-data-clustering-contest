      <p>Winter’s cold weather combined with stifling office heating is a heady cocktail that quickly takes its toll on the complexion and lips.</p>
      <p>But skincare expert Stu Logan from Dermoperfection clinic, in Pinfold Street, Birmingham city centre, is offering insider tips to help men and women maintain a natural healthy glow during the cold snap.</p>
      <p>Specialising in rejuvenating skin techniques along with treatments for conditions, such as pigmentation, scarring, skintags or acne, Stu has done over 7,500 non-surgical procedures during nearly nine years in the business and is an expert in the treatment of lines and wrinkles.</p>

      <p>We went behind the scenes at the aesthetics, skin and cosmetics specialist clinic to find out Stu’s top tips for having great looking natural skin over winter.</p>
      <p>Whether it is skin analysis, facial volumisation, advice with a reparative skin care regime, micro-needling or peeling, Dermoperfection puts clients at ease and gives them the advice and after care to make the best of their skin.</p>
      <p>“Much of what we do at Dermoperfection relates to the emotions that people get at looking at themselves and making them feel more positive about ageing,” explained Stu, who also owns MetroSpa in Harborne.</p>
      <p>“The treatments we offer enable people to take control to look as natural as they can. With winter approaching, it’s a great time to review your skincare and skin health regime and follow these top tips.”</p>

      <h3>Hydrate and protect</h3>
      <p>A key part of having healthy skin over winter is to hydrate the skin and protect it from everyday pollutants. Stu's advice is to use a high concentration Vitamin C serum, which will protect the skin, keep your complexion bright and helps the skin to repair along underneath a hydrating moisturiser.</p>

      <p>Keeping the body healthy with plenty of water, nutrients and vitamins is essential for skin metabolism, complexion and general wellbeing. The skin needs some support in defending itself from the chill and there's a selection of vitamin drips now available at the clinic.</p>
      <p>Stu has developed the Dermoperfection skincare range with seven steps to fight the first signs of ageing, which includes an endurance moisturiser and C20 maximum strength Vitamin C serum.</p>
      <p>Jelly masks are also a new treatment, which completely encase the face while soothing it and are full of active ingredients that directly nourish the skin and are a great add on to any treatment.</p>

      <h3>Don’t forget the sun</h3>
      <p>It may be cold but the sun still shines so it is important to use sun protection, warned Stu.</p>
      <p>"The number one factor in skin ageing is from the sun," added Stu. "So using protection against damaging rays of the sun, in the same way you would during the summer, is essential and will make a real difference."</p>

      <h3>Peels</h3>
      <p>The start of the cold weather is an ideal time of year to renew skin with a peel - whether it's a gentle one for a mild exfoliation or a higher graded peel to hit those deeper layers for an anti ageing result. There's a wide variety available to suit all skin types.</p>
      <p>Stu explained that a peel removes the top layers of dead skin cells in a controlled way, prompting the skins own repairing and renewing cells to reveal new younger skin cells and radiant skin.</p>
      <p>"A skin peel gets deeper down below the top level of the skin and promotes new skin growth," he added. “It can give you a boost of confidence having radiant, glowing and energised skin, so you feel more confident about how the skin can look.”</p>
      <h3>Discover Profhilo</h3>
      <p>One of the most popular anti-ageing treatments across Europe right now is Profhilo, explained Stu, adding: “It stimulates the skin and makes it behave how it did years ago, it’s like adrenaline for the skin!"</p>
      <figure>

      <p>The multi award-winning injectable anti-ageing treatment is made in Italy from ultra pure hyaluronic acid and is aimed at skin that is losing its elasticity and firmness with age.</p>
      <p>Over four weeks, the Profhilo starts to diffuse into the skin’s tissue to stimulate collagen and elastin and makes dramatic changes that transform the look of the skin.</p>
      <p>Dermoperfection is the leading provider in the West Midlands of Profhilo, which is a versatile product that can be used in the face and body that include areas traditionally difficult to treat, such as neck, hands and arms.</p>
      <p>"This kind of treatment creates younger, smoother looking skin that is firmer, brighter, tighter and more energised, in a completely natural looking way" added Stu.</p>

      <h3>Microneedling</h3>
      <p>The great advantage of this, according to Stu, is that it boosts the production of new collagen with regular use and particularly helps with pigmentation issues and crepey skin.</p>
      <p>“A lot of women suffer with pigment issues due to hormones,” added Stu. “We can give them the confidence so they don’t have to cover up with make-up.”</p>
      <p>Microneedling is a minimally-invasive treatment that uses fine needles to create thousands of tiny micro channels in the skin that allow for active ingredients to be added, like vitamins, to pass through the skin directly to the cells where they have the greatest impact.</p>
      <p>It also prompts the production of new collagen to be created through the body's natural healing process.</p>
      <p>In the clinic, pharmaceutical grade vitamin cocktails are available to be added to the microneedling treatment for all skin concerns to give a tailored result - be that pigmentation, general skin ageing, stretch marks or scarring.</p>

      <h3>Find out about fillers</h3>
      <p>Stu is an expert in Juvederm fillers and has trained by the company who produces Juvederm in applying them.</p>
      <p>These high quality facial fillers can shape and contour specific facial features with results that can last as long as nine months to two years. That could be enhancing the curve of cheekbones or giving natural definition to lips.</p>
      <p>"Fillers can be used to sculpt the face, whether it is to give a more feminine or masculine look or put more structure in areas like the chin,  jawline or midface," added Stu. "It can change an appearance from looking sad and drab and correct sunken areas, like under the eyes, so people feel more confident, rejuvenated and maintain a fresh look."</p>
      <h3>Use good quality products</h3>
      <p>Think about what you are putting on and under your skin, is the final piece of advice from Stu.</p>
      <p>"We only use reputable branded products and treatments at Dermoperfection, that have clinical data supporting its use and effectiveness. For that reason we understand how the treatments will work and how to plan great natural treatments, my team and I are medically qualified registered healthcare professionals," he said.</p>
      <p>Dermoperfection is also a specialist clinic for Obagi Medical, advance skin care and skin transformation systems.</p>
      <h3>Keep it natural</h3>
      <p>The main piece of advice from Stu is to always do your research and not go overboard with treatments, but keep it natural.</p>
      <p>"My advice is to make the most of a free consultation, so we can see what is best for you to achieve natural looking results," added Stu. "Take advantage of having a tailored individual service because we know that everyone is different."</p>
