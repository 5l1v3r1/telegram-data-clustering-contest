      <p>An early morning heist in Dresden's Green Vault museum has resulted in the loss of jewellery of "inestimable cultural and historical value", the director of the museum Marion Ackermann told AFP on Monday.</p>
      <p>Earlier, Dresden police confirmed that a burglary had taken place at the Green Vault, a historic museum in Dresden, Germany that contains the largest collection of treasures in Europe.</p>
      <p>According to the police, a surveillance camera has recorded a video of two culprits who broke into the building through a shattered window.</p>
      <p>The criminals, who remain at large, stole three 18th-century jewellery sets, among other items of antique jewellery.</p>
      <p>Bild newspaper previously reported that the burglars stole treasures with a combined value estimated at nearly a billion euros.</p>
      <p>Reports indicated that the burglars <a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201907221076323960-france-prince-of-venice-robbed-in-paris/">shut off the power supply to the museum before breaking in</a>. A fire has also been reported on a bridge near the museum that is believed to have been caused by the power failure.</p>
      <p>The Green Vault is a historic museum in Dresden dating back to 1723. It exhibits a vast collection of precious stones from the Baroque to the Classical eras.</p>
