      <p>Occult symbols have been painted on a killed sheep and on the door of a church in a spate of attacks in the New Forest which are believed to be linked.</p>
      <p>A sheep and two cows have been attacked as well as well as Satanic symbols painted on the door of St Peter’s Church in Bramshaw, Hampshire.</p>
      <p>In the first incident, a dead ewe which had suffered a puncture wound to its side was found in Penn Common Road, Bramshaw, on November 19.</p>
      <p>A local resident, who does not wish to be named, found the sheep with a pentagram painted on its side, a star on its face as well as an inverted cross and the number 666 which is linked to the devil.</p>

      <p>“Why would somebody do this to a sheep, the poor thing. There are some strange people around.”</p>
      <p>A Hampshire Police spokesman said that a heifer and two calves have also been found with wounds in the Bramshaw and Linwood areas.</p>
      <p>And on November 20 the graffiti of an inverted cross and the number 666 was found on the church door.</p>
      <p>Rev David Bacon, vicar of Bramshaw, said: “The church door has been cleaned and needed redecorating but that’s just a pain.</p>
      <p>“The attacks on the animals have left people quite disturbed and scared, particularly people who have animals in the forest.</p>
      <p>“We have had very very minor incidents in the past, little bits of graffiti, it doesn’t happen very often, nothing like this.”</p>

      <p>“We are looking at the circumstances of each one to see if they are linked, and to see how these animals came to be injured.”</p>
      <p>Tony Hockley, chairman of the Commoners Defence Association (CDA) which represents those who keep animals in the New Forest, said: “Any harm to Commoners’ animals is a huge concern.</p>
      <p>“Commoning in the New Forest is a voluntary activity and many do it around our day jobs so any attack on any animal is a huge deterrent to continuing allowing animals to graze in the New Forest so anything like this is extremely worrying for the future of the New Forest.”</p>
      <p>Mr Hockley said he was not aware of a history of occult incidents in the area but added: “The New Forest, like many rural areas, has a historical association with witchcraft so that draws some people and some of the local shops trade on that but it’s normally more about fairies.”</p>
