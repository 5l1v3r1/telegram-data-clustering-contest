      <h1>US honours the first African American FBI special agent after 100 years</h1>

      <p>James Wormley Jones, born 1884 to a former slave at Fort Monroe, was a World War I conqueror and the first African American Agent to be hired at the FBI in November 1919.</p>
      <p>One hundred years ago, Jones was sworn in as the first African American FBI Special Agent.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/early-african-american-agents">Jones’ experience as a World War I vet</a>eran and former detective for the Washington D.C. Metropolitan Police Department, who also worked as an instructor in explosives and bomb-making during his time in the Army earned his candidacy for undercover work.</p>
      <p>Due to terrorist bombings at the time, the General Intelligence Division (GID) was created and Jones’ capability and undercover work were invaluable in fighting domestic terrorism.</p>

      <p>He began working at the GID of the Federal Bureau of Investigation under first FBI director <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Edgar_Hoover">J. Edgar Hoover</a>.</p>
      <p>Before joining the FBI, Jones left the force to serve in the U.S. Army during World War I where he received training as an officer and assigned as the captain of Company F of the 368th Infantry, 92nd Division in 1917.</p>
      <p>Reportedly, his brother served under him as a lieutenant and being segregated African-American forces in the Army, they were sent to Europe to fight in France, close to the Belgium and German borders.</p>

      <p>Jones soon returned to D.C. after the war and was promoted as an FBI special agent.</p>
      <p>“Among Jones’ prominent cases were the investigation of black nationalist Marcus Garvey, who was convicted of mail fraud in 1923, and the probe of the African Blood Brotherhood, a Harlem-based radical group that promoted a separate black state,” officials <a href="https://wydaily.com/local-news/2019/11/12/this-hampton-man-was-the-first-african-american-to-join-the-fbi-100-years-ago/">said</a>.</p>
      <p>Jones retired from the Bureau in April 1923 and joined the Pittsburgh Police Department as a detective. He died in December 1958 at the age of 74 but just like the efforts of many black folks that go unnoticed and acknowledged, Jone was only honoured after his death.</p>
      <p>He paved the way for the many African-American special agents to follow in his footsteps. This December the Bureau celebrates the 100th anniversary of Jones’ appointment to the special agent and honours his position as a trailblazing pioneer who aided the agency to widen its mission’s scope.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/the-fbi-celebrates-100-years-of-african-american-special-agents">FBI honored James Wormley Jones</a> and others as part of its 100-year history of African-American special agents’ service to the FBI and the United States through a coordinated campaign titled ‘Our History, Our Service’.</p>
      <p>It is a year-long initiative to commemorate the 100-year history of African-American special agents’ service to the FBI.</p>
      <p>According to the FBI, there is no known photo of Jones.</p>
