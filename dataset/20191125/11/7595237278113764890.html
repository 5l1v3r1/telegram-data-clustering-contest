      <p>The discovery was made at around 10.50am at Balbutcher Lane in Ballymun.</p>
      <p>The man in his 40s was pronounced dead at the scene and his body has since been removed to the Dublin City Morgue where a post-mortem examination will be carried out tomorrow </p>
      <p>All the circumstances surrounding the discovery of the body are being investigated but, pending the outcome of the post-mortem, gardaí are treating the case as a personal tragedy.</p>
