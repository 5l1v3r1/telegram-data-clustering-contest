      <p>Police in West Lothian are appealing for witnesses after a woman was attacked in an unprovoked assault in Livingston.</p>
      <p>The Incident happened around 7.15am on Friday, November 22 in Firth Road, Craigswood near to the Houston Industrial Estate.</p>
      <p>A 37-year-old woman was walking to work along a path next to the east Craigswood sports centre, north of playing fields and at the rear of the Mitsubushi factory, when a man jumped out at her. He assaulted her and when she tried to fight him off he ran away in the direction of Craigswood.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The suspect is described as around five feet eight inches tall and had a strong body odour.</p>
      <p>Detective Inspector Nick Brookfield said: “This was an unprovoked attack, and although the woman received only minor injuries, she is badly shaken. These kinds of attacks will not be tolerated and we are conducting extensive enquiries to find who is responsible.</p>
      <p>“The area near to where this attack took place would have been busy early in the morning and I would appeal to anyone who may have been driving around the time of the assault to look and see if they have any dash-cam footage.</p>
      <p>
        <b> </b>
      </p>
      <p>“We would also like to speak to anyone else in the area before and after the attack to get in touch if they saw something suspicious on the road, along the path and near the playing fields and sports centre.</p>
      <p>“Anyone with information should call Police Scotland on 101, quoting incident 0556 of Friday, 22 November. Or make a call anonymously to the charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.</p>
