      <p>The National Ginger Association of Nigeria (NGAN) has urged members to guard against sharp practices that can affect the commercial value of their produce negatively in the local and international markets.</p>
      <p>Mr. Haruna Azeez, Chairman, Board of Trustees of NGAN, made the appeal shortly after the election of the association’s Executive Committee in Kafanchan, Jema’a Local Government Area of Kaduna State on Monday.</p>
      <p>He decried certain practices, such as lack of proper cleaning and treatment, stuffing sand and mud in sacks of ginger by some farmers to increase the weight.</p>
      <p>He explained that these were among unwholesome practices which led to low income for the farmers.</p>

      <p>“If we must maximise the potential value in ginger farming, there is need to observe best practices, void of cutting corners,’’ Azeez said.</p>
      <p>He also expressed concerned about the low membership of the association.</p>
      <p>Earlier in his remark, the Chairman-elect of NGAN, Mr. Nyam Yusuf, appreciated members of the association for the confidence reposed in him and gave an assurance of running an all-inclusive administration.</p>
      <p>Yusuf acknowledged the role of middlemen in ginger farming.</p>
      <p>He said that the middlemen must key into the ginger growers and value chain addition by properly disseminating information to farmers about prices so as not to be cheated.</p>

      <p>He said that the middlemen must be organised and should have genuine information about prices.</p>
      <p>Yusuf noted that his administration would compile a register of all ginger associations to enable him to interact with them and identify ways to improve their output.</p>
      <p>The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the executive committee, which was unanimously elected for a four-year term, has Dr. Nyam Yusuf as President and Adeniji Moses as the Vice President.</p>
      <p>Other members include Isaac Ikenyirimba, Secretary; Kenneth Suwa, Financial Secretary; and Adams Nathan, Legal Adviser.</p>
