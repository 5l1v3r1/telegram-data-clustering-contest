        <b>Workers at 12 Scottish universities have begun the first of eight days of strike action amid rows over pensions plus pay and working conditions.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Members of the University and College Union (UCU) at 60 institutes across the UK are taking to the picket lines from Monday to Wednesday December 4.</p>

      <p>The disputes centre on changes to the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS) and issues including a failure to improve pay, equality, casualisation and workloads.</p>
      <p>A rally is also planned to take place on Monday afternoon at Bristo Square in Edinburgh.</p>
      <p>UCU Scotland official Mary Senior said: "Strike action is always the last resort, but universities' refusal to deal with the key issues of increased pension costs, pay and working conditions leave no alternative.</p>
      <p>"It is unbelievable that universities have not done more to work with us to try and find a way to resolve these disputes.</p>
      <p>"We're asking students to call on university principals to get their representatives back to the negotiating table for serious talks."</p>
      <p>Eight universities in Scotland are involved in both disputes: Heriot-Watt, Aberdeen, Dundee, Stirling, Edinburgh, Glasgow, St Andrews and Strathclyde.</p>
      <p>Three institutes - Glasgow Caledonian, Glasgow School of Art and Edinburgh's Queen Margaret University - are only part of the pay and conditions dispute.</p>
      <p>The Scottish Association of Marine Science is also only in the USS pensions dispute.</p>
      <p>Last month, members backed the action in ballots over both pensions and pay and working conditions, with turnouts in Scotland of 56.9% and 56.5% on the respective issues.</p>
      <p>More than three-quarters (78%) backed the industrial action over USS changes, while 73% were in favour of strikes in the other dispute.</p>
      <p>No agreement was reached with academic institution representatives ahead of the nationwide walkout.</p>

      <p>Members will also begin "action short of a strike" on Monday, continuing when they return to work.</p>
