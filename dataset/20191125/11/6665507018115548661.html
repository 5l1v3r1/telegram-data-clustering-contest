      <p>NEW DELHI — The <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/news/Supreme-Court/">Supreme Court</a> on Monday slammed the Punjab and Haryana governments for increase in stubble burning despite its order prohibiting it and said people in <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/news/Delhi/">Delhi</a> can’t be left to die due to air pollution.</p>
      <p>Expressing displeasure over the failure of states in preventing stubble burning, the apex court said: “Should this be tolerated? Is this not worse than internal war? You better finish them all with explosives.”</p>

      <p>A bench of justices Arun Mishra and Deepak Gupta said the life span of millions of citizens has shortened and people are “suffocating” due to pollution in Delhi-NCR.</p>
      <p>“Can you treat people like this and permit them to die due to pollution,” asked the bench.</p>
      <p>“Why are people in this gas chamber? You better finish them all. This wrong is going on for long,” it said.</p>
      <p>The apex court slammed the Centre and states for “blame game” on the issue of water and air pollution in Delhi.</p>
      <p>Taking serious note of water pollution in Delhi, it said people have right to get pure drinking water.</p>
      <p>“We are ‘literally shocked’ that water is polluted in Delhi and blame game is going on. What is this happening,” the bench said.</p>
