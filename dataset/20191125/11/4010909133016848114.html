      <p>If you’ve not noticed, this is the age of foldable smartphones. Many tech manufacturers are coming strong with screens that can be folded in different creative ways. During the recent First World Conference on Display Industry in China, <b>Visionox</b> <a href="https://www.gizmochina.com/2019/11/23/visionox-shows-off-a-foldable-clamshell-phone-a-rollable-amoled-display/">showcased</a> two innovative AMOLED displays which both can be <b>folded clamshell-style</b> and <b>rolled</b> respectively.</p>
      <p>First, let’s talk about the rollable display. It is said that the display design will greatly reduce the area taken by the display, even less than foldable smartphones. The Visionox rollable display can also be rolled up to a dynamic curl radius of 7mm. It features an on-cell touch display integration technology and self-lamination as well. However, the display shown at the conference was just a raw display instead of being installed on a smartphone. The technology might still need some time to be fully developed.</p>

      <p>Viosionox's foldable clamshell smartphone</p>
      <p>For the foldable clamshell screen, it is worth mentioning as it looks different from the one on <a href="https://technave.com/gadget/Motorola-Razr-2019-Price-in-Malaysia-Specs-13916.html">Motorola Razr 2019</a>. The foldable smartphone showcased at the event features a 6.47-inch flexible AMOLED display with on-cell technology. The screen has been installed on a regular looking Android smartphone which its design doesn’t need to be tweaked to be adapted to the screen. Visionox has also mentioned that there won’t be a crease at the center when the final product comes out.</p>
      <p>If you guys didn’t know, Visionox is also the company that supplies the screen panel to Xiaomi for their <a href="https://technave.com/gadget/Xiaomi-Mi-Mix-Alpha-Price-in-Malaysia-Specs-15534.html">Mi Mix Alpha</a> device. The display manufacturer has been taking on challenges to manufacture screen panels that look futuristic.</p>
