      <p>The Niners had experienced close calls in their three previous matches and never looked back after forcing an Aaron Rodgers fumble deep in Packers territory early on to produce a turnover that turned into seven points one play later.</p>
      <p>Jimmy Garoppolo clocked up 176 yards and claimed two touchdowns, both of which went right down the middle of the field to open receivers.</p>

      <p>A season-low return of eight points wiped out Green Bay's lead in the NFC North and they are now level with the Minnesota Vikings with five games left.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/american-football/new-england-patriots/"><b>New England Patriots</b></a> demonstrated why they have the best defence in the NFL with a 13-9 victory over the Dallas Cowboys, who were restricted to just three field goals.</p>
      <p>A New England blocked punt in the first quarter set up the game's only touchdown as the Patriots stay top of the AFC.</p>
      <p>Will Lutz nailed a 33-yard field goal with time running out to help the New Orleans Saints fend off a comeback from the Carolina Panthers and secure a 34-31 win.</p>

      <p>Lutz pounced after Carolina kicker Joey Slye crucially missed two extra points and a potential go-ahead 28-yard field goal with two minutes left.</p>
      <p>The win could prove huge in New Orleans' quest for home advantage in the play-offs. Sean Payton's squad now hold a massive lead in the NFC South.</p>
      <p>Baker Mayfield completed 24 of 34 passes for 327 yards and three touchdowns to help the <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/american-football/cleveland-browns/"><b>Cleveland Browns</b></a> to a 41-24 win over the Miami Dolphins, while the <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/american-football/buffalo-bills/"><b>Buffalo Bills</b></a> maintained their play-off push as they saw off the Denver Broncos 20-3.</p>

      <p>Sam Darnold produced an impressive return of 315 yards, three touchdowns and zero turnovers in the <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/american-football/new-york-jets/"><b>New York Jets</b></a>' 34-3 triumph over the Oakland Raiders.</p>
      <p>According to NFL Research, New York's three-game streak of scoring 34 or more points is their third such streak in franchise history and their first since 2008.</p>
      <p>Rashaad Penny enjoyed the best game of his career to carry the Seattle Seahawks to a 17-9 win over the Philadelphia Eagles.</p>

      <p>Showing power and balance throughout, the former first-round pick ripped off three runs of 20-plus yards and finished with 129 yards on only 14 carries.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, the Pittsburgh Steelers were 16-10 winners over the Cincinnati Bengals, the Chicago Bears held off a late rally to beat the New York Giants 19-14, while the Tampa Bay Buccaneers won 35-22 against the Atlanta Falcons.</p>
      <p>The Washington Redskins gained a 19-16 triumph over the Detroit Lions and the Tennessee Titans defeated the Jacksonville Jaguars 42-20.</p>
