      <p>The Walking Dead spin off World Beyond is set to expand the zombie-ravaged universe we’ve come to know and love.</p>
      <p>The first trailer, which aired revealed that it will delve into CRM, the mysterious group that whisked away <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/rick-grimes-walking-dead/">Rick Grimes</a> (Andrew Lincoln) to an unknown destination in season nine.</p>
      <p>Briefly we can see the three circle symbol on the side of a black helicopter, and the coat of the powerful woman who looks like she means business right at the end.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>Through the clip we can hear the woman saying: ‘Once upon a time the end of the world was our beginning. We are the last light of the world. We are the last hope.’</p>
      <p>We can also see a group of young characters wandering around their desolated town</p>
      <p>World Beyond is set roughly 10 years after the start of the zombie outbreak that introduced us to Rick, Michonne, Daryl and the rest of the survivors.</p>
      <p>Recently CRM featured in Walking Dead prequel Fear The Walking Dead when Althea (Maggie Grace) was introduced to member Isabelle (Sydney Lemmon).</p>

      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/06/27/rick-grimes-disappearance-connect-fear-walking-dead-10079678/">In the show’s fourth episode from season five</a>, Skidmark, the survivors are seen search for Althea who was abducted after a crash near a nuclear power plant. Before she was abducted, Althea was seen investigating the corpse of a heavily armoured soldier and found a map with the same symbol previously seen on the helicopter carrying Rick.</p>
      <p>This helicopter was later sighted by survivor Max (Ethan Suess) as it flew away from the site, taking an abducted Althea along with it.</p>
      <p>Fear The Walking Dead’s fifth season takes place roughly eight months before Rick’s capture, so it’s possible to pull off the timeline.</p>
