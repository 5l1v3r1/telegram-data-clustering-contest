      <h2>The Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage and local candidate Ann Widdecombe will be pounding pavements to win over voters</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T11:36:44+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 11:36</time> by <a rel="author">Carl Eve</a></address>
      <p>Nigel Farage is on the campaign trail in Plymouth today, where he will be speaking to Brexit Party supporters at a special event.</p>
      <p>Opponents say they will be protesting outside Mr Farage's appearance at the Duke of Cornwall Hotel this evening.</p>
      <p>The Brexit Party leader is in the city campaigning alongside candidate Ann Widdecombe.</p>
      <p>For the princely sum of £2.50 you can hear him talk about his plans to get his remaining Brexit Party candidates elected.</p>
      <p>Mr Farage, the former leader of UKIP - who quit that party after the appointment of Tommy Robinson as an advisor on 'rape gangs and prison reform' - will be joined by Ann Widdecombe who is standing as a Brexit Party candidate for Plymouth Sutton and Devonport at the General Election.</p>
      <p>Veteran politician Ms Widdecombe - who served as a Conservative MP under John Major, rising to the position as Minister of State for Prisons - is currently a Brexit Party MEP for the South West region.</p>
      <p>The 71-year-old, who has a home on Dartmoor, near Haytor, had been a committed Tory for 55 years and has previously served as Shadow Health and Home Secretary. In 2010 she took part in series 8 of Strictly Come Dancing and in 2018 she joined Celebrity Big Brother.</p>

      <p>The pair are said to be out hitting the campaign trail in parts of Plymouth today, knocking on doors and speaking to residents about the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/brexit-party-manifesto-policies-2019-20938147">Brexit Party's manifesto</a>.</p>
      <p>Known for her controversial and divisive opinions, she joined Nigel Farage's party in April on a mission to speed up the process of Britain leaving the EU.</p>
      <p>Mrs Widdecombe said in a statement when she was confirmed as Brexit Party candidate: "I am honoured to be the prospective candidate in such a wonderful seat.</p>
      <p>"Plymouth voted Leave with 60 per cent in the referendum and the constituency itself by 54 percent to 46 percent, which was a bigger margin than the national result.</p>
      <p>"Yet the MP has voted to keep the supremacy of EU law after Brexit and for Brexit to be conditional upon continued membership of the Single Market, which means inability to control our own borders. He is resolutely opposed to a clean break.</p>

      <p>"The Brexit Party believes parliament must do the will of the people."</p>
      <p>Earlier this month <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-06-25/brexit-big-short-how-pollsters-helped-hedge-funds-beat-the-crash">Mr Farage</a> - who has his own LBC radio show and spent a number of years as a broker with a number of firms in the City of London - faced criticism for announcing he would drop Brexit Party candidates who were challenging 317 seats which were won by the <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/all-about/conservative-party">Conservatives</a>  in the  last election in 2017.</p>
      <p>It meant there would be no Brexit Party candidate for Central Devon, East Devon, Newton Abbot, North Devon,  <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/news/plymouth-news/how-plymouth-predicted-vote-general-3478824">Plymouth Moor View</a> , South West Devon, Tiverton and Honiton, Torridge and West Devon and Totnes.</p>
      <p>In Cornwall, the Conservatives hold every single seat.</p>
      <p>One candidate, Paul Bullen, said he would take Mr Farage to court over around £600 of unpaid expenses which he said he had spent preparing for the General Election, <a href="https://www.huntspost.co.uk/news/former-brexit-party-candidate-paul-bullen-to-take-legal-action-over-unpaid-expenses-1-6388612">according to the Hunts Post newspaper</a>.</p>

      <p>Another would-be candidate, who called into a LBC radio show, said they were frustrated at being stood down without any prior notice, especially as they had already paid £100 to the Brexit Party to be considered a candidate. It has been estimated that around 3,000 people paid £100 to become candidates of the Brexit Party.</p>
      <p>Mr Farage, who has admitted he would not be standing as a candidate in the General Election and has tried - and failed - on seven occasions to become an MP, will be at The Duke of Cornwall Hotel on Millbay Road tonight as part of the Brexit Party tour.</p>
      <p>He will be joined by key speakers in Plymouth on Monday, although it is not clear if Ann Widdecombe will also be in attendance.</p>
      <p>Tickets cost £2.50 and doors open at 5.30pm. More details can be found on the Brexit Party website.</p>
