        <li><a href="https://www.insider.com/category/lizzo">Lizzo</a> wore the world’s tiniest handbag on the <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/american-music-awards-2019">American Music Awards 2019</a> red carpet on Sunday night.</li>
        <li>The white <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/valentino">Valentino</a> micro-bag proved to be more of a distraction on the red carpet than her bright ruffled mini-dress.</li>
        <li>The “Truth Hurts” singer, who was nominated for three awards, posed with the micro-bag just between her fingers.</li>
        <li>She later posted a photo of her outfit on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5RIJ9hhSPN/">Instagram</a> with the caption: “@maison valentino bag big enough for my fucks to give. Big body bitch in a Valentin-HO custom for @amas.”</li>
        <li>While she got the tick of approval from fashion influencers <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/marc-jacobs">Marc Jacobs</a> and <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/ariana-grande">Ariana Grande,</a> others questioned the contents of the bag with <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/chelsea-handler">Chelsea Handler</a> asking: “What’s in that purse?”</li>
        <li>Lizzo jokingly <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/25/lizzo-carries-smallest-little-bag-american-music-awards-seriously-can-fit-11212707/">revealed on the red carpet</a>: “I got tampons in here, a flask of tequila, condoms.”</li>

      <p><a href="https://www.insider.com/category/lizzo">Lizzo</a> rocked up to the <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/american-music-awards-2019">American Music Awards 2019</a> red carpet on Sunday night carrying what can only be desribed as the world’s tiniest handbag.</p>
      <p>The “Truth Hurts” singer, who was nominated for three prizes, wore a fllamboyant ruffled <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/valentino">Valentino</a> peach mini dress, but she certainly kept her accessories to a minimum.</p>
      <p>The tiny white Valentino bag, which is one of three in the world, proved to be more of a distraction on the red carpet than her bright ensemble as she highlighted its micro size by holding it up just between her fingers.</p>

      <p>Acknowledging the tiny bag could barely fit a lipstick, Lizzo <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5RIJ9hhSPN/">Instagrammed</a> her look with the caption: “@maison valentino bag big enough for my fucks to give. Big body bitch in a Valentin-HO custom for @amas.”</p>

      <p>The singer got the tick of approval from a number of fashion’s greatest influencers with <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/marc-jacobs">Marc Jacobs</a> commenting on her Instagram with the heart emoji and <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/ariana-grande">Ariana Grande</a> writing: “cutest.”</p>
      <p>But some others did wonder what the bag could actually hold.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.insider.com/category/chelsea-handler">Chelsea Handler</a> asked: “What’s in that purse?” while another follower said: “I’m dying to know if there’s anything in it. A mint? An almond?”</p>
      <p>However, the singer did reveal the question on everyone’s mind <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/25/lizzo-carries-smallest-little-bag-american-music-awards-seriously-can-fit-11212707/">during a red carpet interview.”</a></p>
      <p>“I got tampons in here, a flask of tequila, condoms,” the 31-year-old joked.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.insider.com/models-wear-micro-handbags-paris-fashion-week-2019-2">The micro-bag trend took off earlier this year</a> when models walked down the runway at <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/paris-fashion-week">Paris Fashion Week</a> in February holding miniature handbags designed by Jacquemus.</p>
      <p>The tiny <a href="https://www.insider.com/models-wear-micro-handbags-paris-fashion-week-2019-2">Jacquemus bags retail between $240 to $504</a> and since then, other fashion houses have been shrinking their bags down too.</p>
