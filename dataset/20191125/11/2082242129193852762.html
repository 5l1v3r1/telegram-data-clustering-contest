      <p>Good morning <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nhl/teams/toronto-maple-leafs">Toronto Maple Leafs</a> fans!</p>
      <p>I have been a very busy person over the weekend and have had no time for nonsense or silliness, now do I have anything that qualifies as a topical and good lead in for today’s morning links.</p>
      <p>Here’s my challenge to you:</p>
      <p>Find me something nonsensical or silly about this Maple Leafs team, or a team you’ve played on yourself, and put it in the comments. There’s no winner, aside from all of us who get to read such stories.</p>
      <p>Go forth and entertain me minions.</p>
      <p>Here’s the news:</p>
      <p>Back to Excited had a very special guest this weekend. No, it wasn’t me, so keep demanding some seldo content.</p>

      <p>Remember folks, the only good gossip is the gossip that’s old and about someone who was fired so it doesn’t hurt your access to players or risk your company’s media passes. So sit on it as long as you can, keep it bottled up inside, then unleash it before the dirt on the grave has had time to settle.</p>
