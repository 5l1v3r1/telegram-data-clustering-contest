      <p>Look. Here, is an adorable pic of Vijay Deverakonda with ‘Mahanati’ director Nag Ashwin’s son Rishi. The boy is anyway cute and it’s pleasantly surprising to see Vijay sporting traditional silk dhoti with an uttareeyam (silk towel on the shoulders).</p>
      <p>It’s a known thing that Vijay Deverakonda and Nag Ashwin don’t only share a professional equation as a director and an actor but also their friendship is quite evident off-the-screen as well. They bond well with each other as friends.</p>
      <p>Vijayanthi Movies has a three-film deal with <a href="https://www.mirchi9.com/movienews/all-is-well-between-vishwaksen-vijay-deverakonda/">Vijay Deverakonda</a>. He has completed two films already, namely Nani’s ‘Yevade Subrahmanyam’ and Keerthy Suresh’s ‘Mahanati’.</p>
      <p>Very soon the director-actor duo is going to collaborate for their third outing. This time around, Vijay would be the lead, obviously.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Vijay is busy with his upcoming movie ‘World Famous Lover’ with director Kranthi Madhav, and ‘Fighter’ with Puri Jagannaadh. Obviously, Nag Ashwin’s project would be later.</p>
