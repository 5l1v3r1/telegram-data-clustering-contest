      <p>World football is changing. Top European clubs, who were hesitant to play youth stars just a couple of years back, are now fielding more than 3 academy graduates in their starting eleven this season.</p>
      <p>For teams like <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/team/chelsea">Chelsea</a>, the transfer ban has come as a blessing in disguise which has resulted in the Blues recalling an army of loaned players to join the ranks of the senior team and fight for a spot in the starting eleven.</p>
      <p>For teams like <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/team/manchester-united">Manchester United</a> and Arsenal, it has been more of a situation where senior players have failed to perform, leading to managers relying on the youth.</p>
      <p>Not only have the Premier League youth adapted to the high standards, but many have also even become fan favourites and are one of the first names on the team-sheet every weekend.</p>
      <p>This has led to managers being in a constant headache about team selection as they strive to master the man-management skills which the yesteryear managerial legends like Sir Alex Ferguson were known for.</p>
      <p>Today we take a look at the top 3 academy graduates who have risen for their clubs in the Premier League.</p>

      <p>18-year-old winger Bukayo Saka is one of the young stars who has levelled up big time for Arsenal this season.</p>
      <p>As the gaffer, Unai Emery dropped German international Mesut Ozil earlier this season over creative differences, and many of the offensive players were facing injuries, the Spanish manager had no option but to put his faith in Saka.</p>
      <p>The young Englishman not only repaid his faith but also earned a lot of praises from the pundits and fans alike.</p>
      <p>He has started four games for Arsenal in the Premier League and has an excellent successful passing rate of 76%. His on-field statistics in the Premier League do not justify the impact that Saka has had on the left-wing for the Londoners.</p>
      <p>The midfielder has been influential in the Europa League this season where he has 1 goal and 1 assist in 2 games.</p>
      <p>Saka definitely has a long career at Arsenal if he performs consistently over the course of the upcoming seasons.</p>
