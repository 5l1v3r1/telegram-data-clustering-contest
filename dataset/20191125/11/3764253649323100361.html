      <p>Stephen Johnson and his fiancée Tori Austin had been on a dream trip in Mexico when things went horribly wrong while on a cruise ship.</p>
      <p>Johnson went into diabetic shock and was rushed off to a hospital in Progresso, where he fought for his life in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for three days.</p>
      <p>The young man had been diagnosed with a kidney infection, pancreatitis, and diabetes during what was meant to be a blissful holiday with his lover, Daily Mail reported.</p>

      <p>Things were about to get worse, with the hospital reportedly refusing to allow the US citizens to leave its premises until a hefty N4.9 million bill was settled in full.</p>

      <p>Panicked and far from home, the pair set up a crowdfunding campaign, but only a small fraction of the bill had been donated.</p>
      <p>That is where Tyler Perry stepped in and reached out to the hospital in an attempt to clear the outstanding bill.</p>

      <p>After a little push and pull, Tyler managed to pay the absurd amount.</p>
      <p>Tyler was then satisfied to hear that finally, the couple was allowed to go home.</p>
      <p>The celebrity was even willing to cover the costs of having Johnson airlifted back home in a medevac plane but luckily, he had recovered enough from the ordeal to use a commercial airline.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, legendary basketballer, Michael Jordan, <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1267787-basketball-legend-michael-jordan-opens-medical-clinic-poor-north-carolina.html">commissioned one of the two clinics he built for the community he grew up in, Charlotte, North Carolina.</a></p>
      <p>Jordan was in tears as he declared the clinic open for use by the insured and uninsured in the community.</p>
