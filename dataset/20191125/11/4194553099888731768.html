      <h1>Guardiola proposes trophy ‘swap’ arrangement with Liverpool</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T11:03:55+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 11:03</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/jordanchamberlain/" target="_blank">Jordan Chamberlain</a></address>
      <p>Pep Guardiola was in a light-hearted mood on Sunday evening, when he attended the Football Writers’ Association northern branch managers’ awards alongside Jurgen Klopp.</p>
      <p>Taking the stage, the Spaniard joked that perhaps he and Klopp can organise an arrangement this season where we let them have the Champions League so we can secure the Premier League!</p>
      <p>
        <b>“We really want this one and he (Klopp) really wants this one, maybe we can swap?” he joked, cited in the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/liverpools-jurgen-klopp-receives-request-17310676">Echo</a>.</b>
      </p>
      <p>If you offered us that possibility right now, we’d probably take it – although ideally – we’d win both!</p>
      <p>We have an eight point lead at the top of the Premier League and can guarantee finishing top of our Champions League group with a win over Napoli midweek.</p>
      <p>Klopp will surely play our strongest possible XI, which will then enable us to deploy the kids against Rb Salzburg mid-December – which will be very beneficial considering our run of games.</p>
      <p>After Napoli, we play Brighton and Everton at home – two games where six points will be the clear target.</p>
