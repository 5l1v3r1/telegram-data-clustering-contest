      <p>While it may be the general belief that policemen are tough and have a brusque attitude, they have a sensitive side too, as evident from this video that has gone viral. A constable from Punjab has won hearts online after a video emerged of him consoling an elderly lady.</p>
      <p>According to a post by the Indian Police Foundation (IPF), the constable showed a “deep sense of sensitivity and empathy” towards the emotional lady who was crying after her son was arrested by the Malaysian police authorities.</p>
      <p>“This Police Constable should be the ultimate role model for the police. Look at the deep sense of sensitivity and empathy with which he listens to and wipes the tears of this elderly citizen,” read the caption of the viral video.</p>
