        <b>England all-rounder Ben Stokes and athlete Dina Asher-Smith were the first two nominees announced for the 2019 BBC Sports Personality of the Year award.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Stokes was announced as the first contender by the BBC, as an obvious nomination after starring in England's Cricket World Cup triumph.</p>
      <p>In the final against New Zealand, he hit 84 not out - including two sixes in the final over - to tie the game, and then batted in the super over with Jos Buttler to help England to a dramatic victory.</p>

      <p>Stokes was equally heroic in the Ashes, in which he hit an unbeaten 135 to help England win the third Test at Headingley, giving them the opportunity to draw the series.</p>
      <p>Ed Sheeran announced Stokes' nomination and Stormzy made the case for the second contender, athlete Dina Asher-Smith, who this year became the first British woman to win a global gold medal in a sprint event, triumphing in the 200 metres at the World Championships.</p>
      <p>She set a national record with a time of 21.88 seconds and also claimed silver in the women's 100m and the women's 4x100m relay.</p>
