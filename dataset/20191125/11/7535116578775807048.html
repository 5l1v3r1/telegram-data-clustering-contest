      <p>Having a pet has always been a long term responsibility, especially when the pet is acquired when it’s a cute little baby.</p>
      <p>But what happens when it grows up and is more difficult to handle? What happens if it ends up having little kids of its own?</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.facebook.com/animalmalaysia/?eid=ARCXn5vYOswqKXDdvyHQptxQbTCaNqqkuC7IdhcshynSg2kPq3CySB90khVogobhPf1yCzMWIfMI-e15">Persatuan Haiwan Malaysia – Malaysia Animal Association</a> took to their Facebook page to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/animalmalaysia/videos/535556206999444/">showcase</a> a couple that could be seen dumping a litter of kittens out of a cat crate out onto the street, next to an adult cat. Right after they dumped the kittens, the man then turned around and slammed the empty cat crate in the direction of the adult cat, sending all the cats running in different directions.</p>

      <p>The Malaysia Animal Association wrote, “Caring for them when they’re small is cute, but when they’re grown you don’t neuter them because apparently neutering is forbidden and it prevents the cat from enjoying having a family. There are also others who give excuses saying they have no money to neuter their cats and vet costs are expensive, government veterinarians are useless, various bureaucratic procedures.”</p>
      <p>“When it’s too late, neutered or not, cats in heat would mate and have litters 3 times a year. One litter would have at least 4 kittens, hence that’s 12 kittens a year. But owners are not willing to bear the rising costs to feed them. Neighbours would complain about the smell of poop, which in turn changes the owner’s mind about keeping them,” they added.</p>

      <p>If you are unable to care for your pets any longer but truly still care for them, there are ethical ways to ensure that the cat is properly cared for.</p>
      <p>“If you love them, think of looking for us (Malaysia Animal Association), look for a shelter, look for an adopter. Don’t choose to take them home because you feel bad for them. Most people also don’t contribute money when they hand over their pets. Apparently, they don’t have money. They also didn’t have money when they only had one cat to neuter,” they continued.</p>

      <p>In the hands of such owners, cats then may end up being abused – just like the man who decided to smack the cat with the crate in the video. Cats may end up having better lives while living at markets and restaurants as those working at such places may end up feeding them instead of beating, kicking, throwing boiling water at them and <a href="https://www.worldofbuzz.com/cruel-owner-tied-threw-cat-into-longkang-allegedly-because-it-simply-pooped/">tying them up and drowning them</a>.</p>
      <p>Hopefully, the couple is identified and that they are punished for treating the cats so badly.</p>
      <p>The Malaysia Animals Association’s posting has since garnered over 249 shares.</p>
