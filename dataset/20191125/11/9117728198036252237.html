      <h1>Valtteri Bottas claims Red Bull "are better than us" in a straight line!</h1>

        <b>Valtteri Bottas believes that Aston Martin Red Bull Racing now have stronger straight line speed than his Mercedes team following the impressive showing at the Brazilian Grand Prix by the Honda powered team. Max Verstappen won the race and Alex Albon was set for his first podium in F1 before contact with Lewis Hamilton.</b>
      </p>
      <p>However, it was still a Honda 1-2 as Pierre Gasly came home second for Toro Rosso, and the straight line speed of the Honda powered cars was a talking point all weekend.</p>
      <p>Since their return to F1, Honda have been known as the underpowered engine, but they showed their strength at Interlagos, and Bottas now believes that Red Bull Racing are faster on the straights than his Mercedes team.</p>
      <p>According to RaceFans.net, Bottas said:<i> “We knew they would be strong, but I think they were even stronger than we expected.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“They have a good car in the corners now but in a straight line they are better than us now. It used to be pretty similar to us.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“If you look at the beginning of the season to the end of the season, I think Red Bull has made some solid progress."</i>
