      <p><b>San Francisco - </b>The hacker, a minor who hacked Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey's account by the 'SIM swapping' technique in August and sent out numerous anti-semitic and Nazi-related tweets has been arrested.</p>
      <p>Authorities arrested the individual who is part of The Chuckling Squad, a hacker group behind Dorsey's hack that has also claimed responsibility for hacks of other celebrities, including actress Chloe Grace Moretz, Motherboard reported on Sunday.</p>
      <p>"He was a member of Chuckling Squad but not anymore. He was an active member for us by providing celebs/public figure [phone] numbers and helped us hack them," a leader in the hacking group known as "Debug" was quoted as saying.</p>
      <p>Debug said the group kicked out the member behind Dorsey hacking in October.</p>
      <p>In that hack, the individual obtained Dorsey's phone number.</p>
      <p>"The rest of the hack was completed by themselves and other Chuckling Squad leaders known as Aqua and NuBLoM," informed 'Debug'.</p>
      <p>"We applaud the efforts of all the law enforcement agencies involved in this arrest," said Santa Clara County District Attorney's Office, which manages the Regional Enforcement Allied Computer Team (REACT).</p>
      <p>Hackers in August broke into Twitter CEO's account and posted a flurry of rogue tweets, including racial slurs.</p>
      <p>The micro-blogging platform later said that it secured Dorsey's account which became a victim of 'SIM swapping' or 'SIM jacking' where a mobile number is transferred to a new SIM card.</p>
      <p>"The phone number associated with the account was compromised due to a security oversight by the mobile provider," Twitter has said in a statement.</p>
      <p>"This allowed an unauthorised person to compose and send tweets via text messages from the phone number," the company added</p>
