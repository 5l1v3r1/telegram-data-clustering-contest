      <h1>The reported Cardiff City and Sheffield United target who has suddenly become available</h1>
      <h2>The Bluebirds were linked with a move for the Frenchman in the summer</h2>

      <p>Former alleged Cardiff City target Younousse Sankhare has suddenly become available for free following a bizarre fallout with his club Bordeaux.</p>
      <p>The Bluebirds were linked with a move for the central midfielder, who can also play on the left, during the summer, but a move never came to fruition after sources at Cardiff <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/cardiff-citys-transfer-stance-midfielder-16720256">played down the level of any potential interest</a> .</p>
      <p>However, those close to the player in France have always been adamant that <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/latest-cardiff-city-transfer-twist-16878463">Cardiff's interest was real.</a></p>
      <p>Sankhare was embroiled in a bitter dispute with Bordeaux after he missed a section of last season owing to complications with his beard implants.</p>
      <p>It prompted reports that Sankhare, who boasts Paris Saint-Germain among the clubs for which he has played, was seeking pastures new and City, as well as Sheffield United, were credited with having an interest.</p>
      <p>And now the player and the club have finally appear to have parted ways, meaning he is now a free agent.</p>
      <p>The Bluebirds, of course, are now under a new manager in Neil Harris and whether the summer interest from Neil Warnock was concrete is still unconfirmed.</p>
      <p>But if the club's hierarchy do maintain an interest they could now sign him for nothing after he parted ways with the Ligue 1 club.</p>
      <p>It all became messy at Bordeaux for Sankhare, 30, with lawyers becoming involved in negotiations to thrash out an exit deal.</p>
      <p>French outlet <a href="https://www.20minutes.fr/sport/football/2597955-20190905-girondins-bordeaux-younousse-sankhare-mis-pied-direction-club">20 Minutes</a> claimed the player was suspended by the club "as a precaution", adding he was not able to access the club's training ground, car park or dressing room.</p>
      <p>Sankhare was then called to the club offices, where he reportedly met with deputy chairman Frédéric Longuépée, a bailiff and a member of human resources, before being told that he was being suspended for a week.</p>
      <p>It eventually rumbled on before a deal was struck for the player to be released and, given his wealth of experience at the top level in Ligue 1, he is likely to have many potential suitors.</p>
      <p>The same French newspaper, 20 minutes, now report that a number of sides around Europe are interested in acquiring his services.</p>
