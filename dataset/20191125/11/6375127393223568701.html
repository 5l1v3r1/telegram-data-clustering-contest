      <h1>McCoy happy for Elisse and Jameson: ‘Kung totoo'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T11:05:13+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 11:05</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://journal.com.ph/authors/mario-bautista" target="_blank">Mario Bautista</a></address>
      <h3>MCCOY De Leon considers it a big blessing to be part of the horror flick “The Heiress” that opens in theaters this Wednesday. “Sobrang nagpapasalamat ako sa Regal dahil kinuha nila ako for this movie at first time kong makapareha si Janella Salvador,” he says. “First time ko ring makatrabaho si Inay Maricel Soriano and it’s a great experience I will never forget. Naging napakabait niya sa amin ni Janella and we learned so much from her.”</h3>
      <p>So how is it working with Janella? “We’ve known each other for quite sometime kasi pareho kami ng handler kaya wala na kaming ilangan sa shooting. Naging masaya at madali ang pagtatrabaho namin. I play her boyfriend at tutol sa akin si Inay Maria dahil gusto niyang makontrol totally si Janella para maging tagapagmana niya sa pagiging mambabarang niya, so she will do everything para paglayuin kami sa isa’t isa.”</p>
      <p>McCoy’s full name is Mark Carlos de Leon. He’s 24 years old and he initially gained fame as a member of the all-male dance group called Hashtags. He then joined PBB Season 7 and he formed a love team with Elisse Joson. They were launched in the movie “Sakaling Maging Tayo” but, sadly, it didn’t do well at the tills as it was shown after their McLisse love team has broken up.</p>
      <p>Doesn’t he have any regrets about what happened to him and Elisse? “Hindi naman ako nanghinayang kasi hindi ko naman na-feel na nag-suffer 'yung career ko. I’m just happy now na nabigyan ako chance na makapagtrabaho sa Regal. Aside from ‘The Heiress’, may isa pa raw akong gagawing movie sa kanila and sa Star Cinema naman, tapos ko na 'yung ‘Block Z’ na about zombies at may sisimulan rin akong bagong movie with them, ‘The Mirror’, so tuluy-tuloy lang ang trabaho ko.”</p>
      <p>He just wants to keep on working with different companies. “I’m eager to learn more about my craft by working with other people. Marami akong natututuhan sa kanila at mas lumalawak 'yung kaalaman ko pagdating sa acting. Okay na yung wala akong ka-love team kasi kapag isa lang ang kapareha mo, nakatutok ka na lang doon. Hindi naman ako nagsisisi sa naging love team namin but I think, it’s time na rin to move on and expand our world, our horizons. Masaya rin ako sa nangyaeri and I think may reason naman si God kung bakit nangyari yon.”</p>
      <p>How does he feel now that Elisse is being linked to Jameson Blake? “Honestly, I’m happy for them, kung totoo. Friend ko rin naman si Jameson dahil kagrupo ko siya sa Hashtags. I’m wishing them all the best at sana maging successful sila pareho.”</p>
