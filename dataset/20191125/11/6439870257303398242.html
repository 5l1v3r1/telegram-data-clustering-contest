      <p>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (KMAX/KOVR/CNN) - Two California sisters say they received a lot of support from other women at the yard sale they held after their divorces as an effort to move on.</p>
      <p>From instruments to formal dining sets, sisters Anna Sierra and Theresa Plyler declared everything must go in a Craigslist ad for their Saturday yard sale, which the two deemed the “Two Sisters Divorcing Yard Sale.”</p>
      <p>“You gotta laugh about things,” Plyler said. “It helps you move on, and it gives you some perspective.”</p>
      <p>In their ad, the sisters offered a range of items, including “debatable art that we tolerated but might be worth some money,” “appliances that – who are we kidding? – we never actually used” and “costume jewelry to mask the desperation of our shallow existences.”</p>

      <p>“It was kind of cathartic, actually, just writing the ad and taking a more humorous twist on it,” Sierra said. “It’s kind of traumatic going through a divorce, but there are also a lot of positive things happening in my life.”</p>
      <p>Sierra says this is her way of getting through a rough time, and the support the two received from other women was inspiring.</p>
      <p>“They came, literally, because of the ad. They weren’t really even interested in shopping. They just wanted to meet us,” she said.</p>
      <p>With that support and some cash in their pockets, the sisters say they can now move on.</p>
      <p>“It’s just kind of nice to be able to start over in not just an emotional capacity but also just in a very physical sense,” she said.</p>
      <p>Sierra says this was also a way to get to know her new neighbors as she moves into a one-bedroom apartment to start fresh.</p>
