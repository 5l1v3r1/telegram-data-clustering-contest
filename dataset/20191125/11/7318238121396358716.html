      <p>A 25-year-old lorry driver charged with manslaughter over the discovery of 39 bodies in the back of his vehicle container has pleaded guilty to assisting illegal immigration and acquiring criminal property.</p>
      <p>Maurice "Mo" Robinson, from Northern Ireland, did not enter a plea for his other 41 charges, which include 39 of manslaughter.</p>
      <p>He appeared for the court hearing on Monday via a video link from Belmarsh Prison in London, where he has been detained.</p>
      <p>There is currently no date for a trial scheduled; however, Robinson is next due to appear in court in mid-December.</p>
      <p>The 39 victims, all Vietnamese nationals, were found in the back of a refrigerated lorry container in an industrial park in Essex in October.</p>
      <p>Robinson is among three people who have been arrested in Ireland and the UK, and several other arrests have been made in Vietnam.</p>
      <p>Three others have been released on bail pending further investigation in the case.</p>
      <p>It is a case that has since brought a spotlight to human trafficking cases across Europe, with several reported since the grisly discovery.</p>
      <p>Last week, more than a dozen migrants were found in the back of a lorry aboard a ferry travelling from France to Ireland.</p>
      <p>The migrants were all described by authorities to be in "good health", and undertook medical assessments upon arrival in Ireland.</p>
