      <h1>New mom Shawn Johnson breaks down after video shows husband's collapse, ER visit</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T11:00:55+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 11:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.usatoday.com/life/" target="_blank">Sonja Haller, USA TODAY</a></address>
      <p>New parents Shawn Johnson and Andrew East had a scare only three weeks after they <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/parenting/2019/11/08/shawn-johnson-baby-andrew-east-22-hour-labor-c-section/2527829001/">brought home new daughter Drew</a>.</p>
      <p>The couple, who have shared the <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/parenting/2019/07/21/shawn-johnson-andrew-east-share-hopeful-pregnancy-update-after-complications/1790447001/">highs and lows of their pregnancy</a> and now family life on their video blog, "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ15Zl-v8-ghTgEOTpxHdGw">The East Fam</a>," said Sunday that East was in his Nashville, Tennessee, home gym when he collapsed.</p>
      <p>Mixed with video of Johnson holding the baby and East explaining he was tidying the gym in anticipation of his friends' arrival, is dramatic footage of East lifting a 185-pound weight and falling backwards. </p>
      <p>"As soon as I put the bar on the rack I went from being fully conscious to … (snaps his fingers and the screen goes black to the sound of heartbeats). Nothing," he said with the video showing him prone on the floor. "And that began this one-hour period where I literally … I don't remember anything."</p>

      <p>The former Washington Redskins player said he's never blacked out or lost memory. He said he was unconscious for "several minutes." His friends arrived, "saw a puddle of blood" and took him to the emergency room</p>
      <p>"I was asleep upstairs and unaware of any of this," Johnson said.</p>
      <p>East called her from the hospital at 6 a.m.</p>
      <p>She called her parents to watch the baby and headed to the ER. </p>
      <h3>From bad to worse?</h3>
      <p>East, 28, got nine staples in his head from hitting the gym floor. But a nurse said a doctor would be in later to speak with him.</p>
      <p>"I didn't like how she said it," Johnson said. "She told us it had something to do with the EKG. So, his heart; how his EKGs look irregular. They think it's his heart that caused him to pass out."</p>
      <p>Doctors decided to keep him overnight for observation. </p>
      <p>They eventually cleared East to come home after deciding what they saw in the EKG "was not as concerning as they initially thought," East said. </p>
      <h3>'I got little Drew'</h3>
      <p>"So I called Shawn and let her know I would be coming home," East recalled, saying he heard his wife "cry and really sob like I hadn't heard you sob before."</p>
      <p>"I was terrified," said the 27-year-old former Olympic gymnast.  </p>
      <p>While still in the hospital, East said he wrestled with what it meant to be a father. </p>
      <blockquote>"It was the first time I had to realize that my life is not just my own now," he said. "I got little Drew I need to be selfless for."</blockquote>
      <p>At home, East said that hearing his wife cry and watching the gym footage helped him to recognize that control is an illusion and that life can change fast.</p>
      <p>"I realize that we have a daughter now who we are fully responsible for, who depends on us literally for her life," he said. "I have a wife now who would be fine with out me."</p>
      <p>"Shut up," Johnson chimed in.  </p>
      <p>"I think it has given me this perspective of gratitude and submission and what are my priorities and how can I honor those priorities?"</p>
