      <p>The 18-year-old starlet can operate as a centre-back but his versatility can also see him deployed as a midfielder.</p>
      <p>With the German side Schalke intensifying efforts to bring the defender to Bundesliga in the next summer, Arsenal are reported to be leading race for the signing of the wonderkid in England.</p>

      <p>Unai Emery's porous backline has seen the North London side slip down on the table but the Spaniard manager is eyeing a move for Otasowie whose contract expires this summer with Molineux.</p>

      <p>Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool are also said to be monitoring the performance of the defender and should he fail to extend his contract with Wolves, he may end up playing for the Premier League top side.</p>
      <p>Otasowie is reportedly limited to bench appearances, having managed just 86 minutes across four games in the Premier League 2 and this may force him to switch side to one of the suitors.</p>
