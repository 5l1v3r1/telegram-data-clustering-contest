      <p><a href="http://inquisitr.com/tag/halsey">Halsey</a> was one of many high profile names that turned up to the American Music Awards last night in Los Angeles, California, at the Microsoft Theater. The “New Americana” songstress showed up in a floral Marc Jacobs garment, and it didn’t go unnoticed.</p>
      <p>On Instagram, Halsey shared numerous photos to her Instagram account from the night. In the first shot, she is walking down the stairs in her eye-catching dress. She is looking up at the person who is taking a photo of her while people are holding onto the train behind her. The “Nightmare” hitmaker is smiling and placing her hands onto the rails. The low-cut outfit is short, multicolored and has long sleeves. Halsey displays her tattoos on her leg and shoulder and leaves her chest bare with no accessories. She is sporting a bold eye shadow while owning her hair up.</p>
      <p>In the second photo, Halsey appears backstage while getting ready for the red carpet. She is looking down as her glam squad is helping her out.</p>
      <p>In the third and final shot, she is posing on the carpet with her hands on her hip. She is rocking a big circular earring while fiercely looking into the photographers’ camera lens.</p>
      <p>For her caption, she credits Marc Jacobs for the dress and her “glam team” Zoe Costello and Martin-Christopher Harper for helping her out.</p>
