      <p>Bharatiya Janata Party’s West Bengal Vice President Joy Prakash Majumdar was allegedly assaulted by the workers of the Trinamool Congress Party during the Karimpur bye-poll on Monday.</p>
      <p>In the video of the incident, a group of men can be seen beating up Majumdar and pushing him into the bushes. The incident occurred in the Phipulkhola area of Nadia district when he was entering a polling booth, news agency PTI reported. Majumdar is the BJP candidate in the Karimpur bye-poll.</p>
      <p>The BJP leader reportedly called this incident the “clear sign of <a href="https://www.firstpost.com/politics/west-bengal-bypolls-2019-bjp-candidate-jay-prakash-majumdar-beaten-up-by-tmc-workers-while-entering-polling-booth-ec-seeks-reports-about-incident-7696991.html">end of democracy</a> in West Bengal”.</p>
      <p>Other BJP leaders from the state posted updates on social media in support of Majumdar.</p>
