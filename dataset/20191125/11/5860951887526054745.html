      <p>Nine confirmed cases of mumps have been reported on campus this fall, and other possible cases are being investigated, <a href="https://health.uark.edu/_resources/documents/adh-public-directive-mumps-11-22-19.pdf">according to an email to students and faculty Friday</a>.</p>
      <p>The ADH is asking that all children and adults get up-to-date with their MMR vaccine<b>. </b>The best way to protect against mumps is to get the MMR vaccine. The MMR vaccine also protects against measles and rubella. It is also called the MMR shot. Unvaccinated people are 9 times more likely to get mumps than are people with 2 doses of MMR vaccine.</p>

      <p>Students that have never received an MMR vaccine will need to be excluded from class and university activities for at least 26 days. However, they can return to class immediately once they have received a dose of MMR vaccine. They will need to receive a second dose of MMR vaccine 28 days after the first dose.</p>
