      <h1>‘Always so nervous’ – Leicester player criticised on loan, manager expects more</h1>

      <p>It’s fair to say Islam Slimani didn’t have his best match for AS Monaco on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The Leicester City owned striker has been enjoying a great period for the French principality club since moving on loan from the Foxes, yet he managed to get himself in the bad books against Bordeaux.</p>
      <p>Having opened the scoring on fifteen minutes, <a href="http://lequipe.fr/">L’Equipe</a> report that’s when things started going wrong for the striker. He managed to annoy the opposition and the home crowd with his celebration, and that saw him become targeted.</p>
      <p>The French newspaper say Slimani was ‘always so nervous’, and was booked for a challenge in the 54th minute, he then got a second yellow for a handball in the 67th, which also led to a penalty for Bordeaux. That was converted and sealed a 2-1 win for the home side.</p>
      <p>After the match, manager Leonardo Jardim said he expects more from the player, both in scoring goals and his behaviour.</p>

      <p>Monaco are currently 14th in Ligue 1, and there’s every chance Jardim is taking out his frustrations in the wrong direction.</p>
      <p>Slimani has six goals and eight assists in ten league matches this season, and without him the club would be in a much worse situation.</p>
