      <h1>Target will give you a $200 gift card if you buy any iPhone 11 on Black Friday</h1>
      <h2>The offer is available Friday through Sunday.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T11:33:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 11:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.engadget.com/editors/christine-fisher" target="_blank">Christine Fisher</a></address>
      <p>Buy an <a href="https://www.target.com/p/apple-iphone-11/-/A-78052843?preselect=76695894#lnk=sametab">iPhone 11</a> at Target this Black Friday (thru Sunday), and the retailer will throw in a $200 gift card. The deal also applies to the <a href="https://www.target.com/p/apple-iphone-11-pro/-/A-78052805?preselect=76695870#lnk=sametab">iPhone 11 Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.target.com/p/apple-iphone-11-pro-max/-/A-78052840?preselect=76695878#lnk=sametab">11 Pro Max</a>, <a href="https://www.target.com/p/apple-iphone-xs/-/A-54018170?preselect=53657286#lnk=sametab">XS</a> and <a href="https://www.target.com/p/apple-iphone-xs-max/-/A-54018173?preselect=53962866#lnk=sametab">XS Max</a>, activated on Verizon (Engadget's parent company) or AT&amp;T. That's a solid deal on the newest iPhones, as well as last year's XS and XS Max models. Plus, the $200 could give the rest of your holiday shopping a nice boost.</p>
      <p>All of the models mentioned -- the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/17/apple-iphone-11-review/">iPhone 11</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/17/apple-iphone-11-pro-and-pro-max-review/">11 Pro, 11 Pro Max</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/09/21/apple-iphone-xs-and-xs-max-review/">XS and XS Max</a> -- received high scores and praise when we reviewed them. From the beginning, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/10/iphone-11-hands-on-still-cheap-and-cheerful/">iPhone 11</a> has offered more power for less money, and with this discount, it's even more power for your buck.</p>
      <p>Even though the XS and XS Max are a year old, as we've said before, they are future proof, so you probably won't need to upgrade for a while. Those models represent Apple at the top of its hardware game and are still great devices.</p>
      <p>Target previewed this discount earlier this year, when it offered the same <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/07/iphone-11-galaxy-s10-pixel-4-target/">$200 gift card deal</a> on November 8th and 9th. If you missed it then, you'll have another chance this weekend. Of course, there will be plenty of other hardware <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/25/target-black-friday-airpods-beats-studio-3-wireless/">on sale at Target this Black Friday</a>.</p>
