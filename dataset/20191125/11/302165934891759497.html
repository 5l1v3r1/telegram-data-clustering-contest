      <h1>MACC admits error in informing PKR about now-sacked duo's suspected graft</h1>

      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 25 — The Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) admitted today that it erred in notifying PKR about suspicions of corruption involving two of its members, which the political party has now sacked.</p>
      <p>MACC deputy chief Datuk Seri Azam Baki clarified that the MACC is only required to notify government bodies and not political parties.</p>
      <p>“MACC admits that there has been an error made by the MACC Report Division chief through a letter to that party that suggested disciplinary action for breaching the party’s code of ethics,” Azam said in a brief statement to <i>Malay Mail</i>.</p>
      <p>He was responding to queries over whether MACC could propose to political parties to take disciplinary action against their members over suspected wrongdoing, following PKR’s sacking of two members yesterday.</p>
      <p>“According to the disciplinary guidelines (that MACC has to follow), the report of a wrongdoing is only sent to a federal or state government’s ministry and agency.</p>
      <p>“It is not subject to any political parties. It is not MACC’s policy to make such reports to any political parties about their members’ wrongdoing,” he added.</p>
      <p>He said MACC will be sending a letter to the PKR disciplinary board chairman to explain the error and to avoid misunderstandings in the future.</p>
      <p>PKR yesterday sacked former Bera PKR division chief Zakaria Abdul Hamid and fellow party member Ismail Dul Hadi, after the party received a letter from the MACC on allegations of corruption and bribery against the duo in relation to last year’s party elections.</p>
