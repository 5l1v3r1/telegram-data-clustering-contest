      <p>LONDON — There is “no chance” of the U.K. and the EU concluding a trade deal by the end of 2020 that does not include membership of the single market, according to Tony Blair.</p>
      <p>The former U.K. prime minister also said agreeing a trade deal with the United States “is going to be very difficult” for Britain.</p>
      <p>He made the comments after current PM Boris Johnson vowed to secure a trade deal with the EU by the end of the Brexit transition period and <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/johnson-rejects-case-for-brexit-extension/">without an extension</a>, meaning a December 2020 deadline.</p>
      <p>Speaking at <a href="https://twitter.com/Reuters/status/1198889654281359362">a Reuters event</a> in London on Monday, Blair argued: “What has become apparent in the last weeks is that this negotiation has no chance of being concluded in that transition period. None.</p>
      <p>“Except in circumstances where, as Boris Johnson effectively did in respect of Northern Ireland, we concede that Britain stays in the trading system of Europe, the single market.”</p>
      <aside>The former U.K. prime minister said agreeing a trade deal with the United States “is going to be very difficult” for Britain.</aside>
      <p>Blair argued the EU would not allow a neighboring country to diverge from its rules and become a competitor while maintaining continued access to its markets and potentially undermining them.</p>
      <p>Johnson and U.S. President Donald Trump have also insisted a transatlantic trade deal can be negotiated quickly, and striking a pact with America has become a central drive of the British government.</p>
      <p>But Blair said U.S. politics was “deeply divided” and a trade agreement might struggle to pass Congress. “I wouldn’t hold your breath on a United States-U.K. trade deal. I think it’s going to be very difficult.”</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, Blair said either a Labour majority or a Conservative majority would be a bad outcome for Britain in the ongoing general election, and advocated tactical voting — although he insisted he would vote Labour.</p>
      <p>“The truth is: the public aren't convinced either main party deserve to win this election outright,” he said. “They're peddling two sets of fantasies; and both, as majority governments, pose a risk it would be unwise for the country to take.”</p>
