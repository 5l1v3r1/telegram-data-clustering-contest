      <p><b>GOMA, DR CONGO -</b> At least 29 people were killed Sunday when a small plane crashed after takeoff into a densely populated area of the city of Goma in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo.<br/><br/>A survivor among the 19 people -- 17 passengers and two crew members -- who were aboard the plane was taken to hospital along with 16 others injured on the ground, the North Kivu regional government said.<br/><br/>"At this stage, 29 bodies have been found in the rubble," the statement said.<br/><br/>The Busy Bee Dornier-228 smashed into two houses near the airport, the deputy transport minister Jacques Yuma Kipuya said earlier.<br/><br/>The first images from the scene showed smoke billowing above the neighborhood and the aircraft in flames with local people throwing buckets of water on it.<br/><br/>A video seen by AFP showed the cabin of the plane still smouldering embedded in the wall of the house.<br/><br/>The aircraft had been headed for the city of Beni, 350 kilometers north of Goma, when it went down after takeoff in the residential area.<br/><br/>Busy Bee airline staff member Heritier Said Mamadou had earlier confirmed that 19 were on board the flight scheduled from Goma around 9:00 am (0700 GMT).<br/><br/>Busy Bee, a recently established company, has three planes serving routes in the North Kivu province.<br/><br/>The pilot "failed in his takeoff," Nord Kivu governor Carly Nzanzu Kasivita said in a statement.<br/><br/>One of the airline's maintenance workers at the site blamed a "technical problem".<br/><br/>Among the victims of the Goma crash was a woman who was the coordinator of an association for the defense of women's rights, Mambo Zawadi, her NGO said.<br/><br/>There were also three civil servants in the housing sector "who were returning to their posts in Butembo and Beni after work sessions that I had organized," their supervisor Molendo Sakombi said in a statement.<br/><br/>The UN mission deployed in DR Congo, MONUSCO, sent two fire engines to support local rescue services.<br/><br/>Aircraft accidents are common in the vast, conflict-wracked central African country.<br/><br/>Last month an Antonov-72 cargo plane that was providing logistical assistance for a trip by Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi and carrying eight crew and passengers went missing after taking off from Goma. -AFP</p>
