        <i>I want to make it clear that all our trading terminals, all our branches, <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Karvy">Karvy</a> online, everything, everywhere is open for trading which has been going on since morning. There is absolutely no disruption at all, says<b> <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/C-Parthasarathy">C Parthasarathy</a></b>, Chairman, <b>Karvy</b>.</i>
      </p>
      <p><b>Help us understand what exactly does the Securities &amp; Exchange Board of India (<a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Sebi">Sebi</a>) note mean?<br/></b>The Sebi order is an ex-parte-ad-interim order, which means that an opportunity has not been given to us to explain the position and this is an interim order pending our submissions and pending furnishing other details. What does this order contain? I want to make it clear that all our trading terminals, all our branches, Karvy online, everything, everywhere is open for trading which has been going on since morning. There is absolutely no disruption at all. If you go through the order, it only states that till we make our submission, we are not allowed to take new customers. The activity pertaining to the existing customers will continue unabated. There are no restrictions at all.</p>
      <p>Since morning all our customers, all our clients as also the entire branch network of Karvy including the online part, including the call and trade part where we have equity advisors have been busy talking to various clients and trades are being executed seamlessly. Let me again reiterate that the Sebi order stipulates that no new customer account shall be opened till the matter is disposed off.</p>
      <p>So calling this a ban is inappropriate and this causes a little bit of confusion and creates a little bit of panic as far as the investing community is concerned. Given the fact that we are essentially a retail broking company and close to about 25,000 to 30,000 individual customers buy and sell securities through us, this is exactly what the order states.</p>
      <p><b>What clarification is the Sebi seeking? Is there a particular case? <br/></b>The various issues that have been raised in the order are that client securities that have been pledged, should have been unpledged after the circular was issued. The second point is some of the clients’ securities have not been credited to the respective customers automatically. The third point was about some buying and selling and I am sure that we will clarify all these matters very clearly to Sebi. We have got 21 days’ notice. We are in the process of getting all the details and I am sure we will be able to answer them because one of the few things that I want to make very clear is that there is absolutely no problem as far as clients securities are concerned. All of them are available. This has been verified by the NSE and also partially by Sebi and everything is fine.</p>
      <blockquote>We have already unwound pledged shares to the extent of Rs 550 crore and we will need a month or two to unwind the balance. There is no question of not being in a position to credit or anything of that kind.<br/>-C Parthasarathy</blockquote>
      <p>The second issue is that of pledging of shares. Pledging of shares as long as money was due to the firm by the individual investors was a practice that was adopted by every broker. Sebi came out with the directive stating that this pledging of shares should be unwound and there should not be any pledging of shares from the 1st of September. By virtue of the retail nature of our business, the unwinding of securities is taking us a little longer and we have already made it clear to Sebi that we will require a couple of months more to unwind the entire securities that have been pledged.</p>
      <p><b>Sebi alleges that you did pull out shares from your clients’ demat account and transferred those shares to demat accounts controlled by you, pledged those shares, took the money and transferred the money to your real estate arm -- Karvy. Are you completely denying these allegations?<br/></b>Yes, I think I am. Let me answer this in a more comprehensive manner. Karvy Realty Ltd is a real estate broking company which is a subsidiary of Karvy <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/monarch-networth-capital-ltd/stocks/companyid-8850.cms">Stock Broking</a>. Karvy Realty has been in existence for almost 12 to 15 years. Karvy Realty is also the arm which invests in various other subsidiary companies.</p>
      <p>We invest through Karvy Realty only because we have to protect the net worth of Karvy Stock Broking as required. These investments have been made over a decade for the last 12 years in various subsidiary companies and we have full details.</p>
      <p>I do not know how that numbers have been arrived at but we will probably seek clarifications and give explanations because this is just a subsidiary company and from this subsidiary company, we have invested in various other companies.</p>
      <p>The other issue which was important was that Karvy Stock Broking, apart from being a broker of the exchanges, also was the holding company of a number of other subsidiary companies. There was a confusion that these securities that have been taken have been pledged for this, whereas a majority of the investments through Karvy Realty have been made a long time ago. I am sure we can explain this in clear detail to Sebi and NSE whenever we present ourselves to them.</p>
      <p><b>They say that net Rs 1,096 crore was transferred by Karvy Stock Broking to Karvy Realty between 1st April 2016 and 19th October 2019. Can you clarify if this amount is correct that and has it been as per the relevant provisions and directives of the regulator?<br/></b>I have already stated that Karvy made the subsidiary companies and Karvy Realty have been in existence for 12 to 15 years. These investments have been made through Karvy Realty over a period of time. There is no linkage between pledging of shares and the entire amount of investments that have been made, subject to of course, the number of whatever is mentioned in the order has to be reconciled. I would not know. But I want to make it very clear that a number of these investments in subsidiary companies have been made much earlier, not in the last three years. This is a clarity that we will provide to Sebi when we submit our explanations to them.</p>
      <p><b>I am sure they have given you a timeline within which you have to submit your clarification? So, how many days?<br/></b>Yes, they have given us 21 days. Ever since the order has come, we have been grappling with various other operational issues and trying to explain to various investors and other constituents. We have 21 days and I am very confident that within that time, we will give an effective explanation to SEBI.</p>
      <p><b>Earlier you were mentioning that you were unable to credit shares into a couple of demat accounts. Help us understand why the delay?<br/></b>I do not know whether I have stated anything like that. I have only said that un-pledging of shares was taking time because of the retail nature of the clients that we have. After selling. they were immediately buying again and that was taking time. So, this unwinding of pledged shares was taking time. We have already unwound pledged shares to the extent of Rs 550 crore and we will need a month or two to unwind the balance. There is no question of not being in a position to credit or anything of that kind.</p>
      <p><b>Is Karvy Realty sufficiently funded?<br/></b>Karvy Realty is a subsidiary company of Karvy Stock Broking and it has been funded over a period of time and the investments have been made in other subsidiary companies through Karvy Realty. It is not a large effective operating company except it does real estate brokerage where it is the arm which has been used to invest in the other subsidiary companies of the group.</p>
      <p><b>Has there been any sort of a ban on getting new customers of any sort for 21-day period?<br/></b>That is what I said, the order clearly only mentions that no further customer account should be opened till they are satisfied with the explanations. They are not saying that after 21 days we can open customer accounts. The order says that till further orders, no new customer accounts can be opened. In other words, everything else is fine with us. All my existing customers can buy and sell securities through us, which is what they have been doing since morning today. All our terminals are open and running.</p>
      <p>We have about 12,000-15,000 customers who trade online. All of them have been trading online. The only thing that has come by virtue of this media reaction has been the number of queries has increased and that is something that we have been trying to manage.</p>
