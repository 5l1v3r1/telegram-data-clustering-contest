      <p>NEW DELHI: Mining, printing of books, film production and software development will not be eligible for the new lower corporate tax rate of 15%.</p>
      <p>Finance minister <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/nirmala-sitharaman">Nirmala Sitharaman</a> in Lok Sabha on Monday introduced the Taxation Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2019 that seeks to replace the ordinance, issued on September 20, to slash corporate tax rate to 22% without incentives and 15% for new manufacturing entities.</p>
      <p>The bill empowers the government to notify activities that may not qualify as manufacturing to be eligible for 15% tax rate. Besides, conversion of marble slabs and bottling of gas will not be eligible as per the bill.</p>
      <p>It also puts safeguards such as disallowing reduced rate of 22% if the prescribed conditions have been violated and disallowing losses or unabsorbed depreciation due to a merger under the provision.</p>
      <p>Sitharaman introduced the bill just before the proceedings in the Lok Sabha were adjourned for the day following uproar from opposition over political developments in Maharashtra.</p>
      <p>Amid the din, the government also introduced the International Financial Services Centres (IFSCs) Authority Bill, 2019, that provides for creation of a unified financial regulator for IFSCs.</p>
      <p>Sitharaman had announced on September 20 the lowering of the base corporate tax rate to 22% from 30% for companies that do not seek exemptions, and reduced the rate for some new manufacturing companies to 15% from 25% The corporate tax cut followed other measures by the government to prop up slowing GDP growth that fell to six-year low of 5% in first quarter of this financial year.</p>
      <p>These changes were effected through an ordinance as Parliament was not in session then. As per the constitutional process, an ordinance promulgated has to be laid before both the houses of Parliament and shall cease to operate at the expiration of six weeks from reassembly of Parliament or if before expiration of the above period, resolutions disapproving the ordinance are passed by both the Houses, on the date on which resolutions are passed.</p>
      <p>Besides reduction in corporate tax rates for existing and new domestic companies, the ordinance provided for withdrawal of higher surcharge for non-corporates on certain capital market transactions and relief from tax on listed companies on buybacks which were publicly announced prior to the presentation of the budget for 2019-20 on July 5.</p>
      <p>
        <b>IFSC BILL</b>
      </p>
      <p>The International Financial Services Centres Authority Bill, 2019 provides for the establishment of the International Financial Services Centres Authority.</p>
      <p>The authority will consist of nine members, appointed by the central government. Its members will include four members to be nominated from the Reserve Bank of India, the Securities and Exchange Board of India, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India, and the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority, besides the chairperson. It will regulate financial products, financial services and financial institutions in an IFSC which has been approved by any regulator.</p>
