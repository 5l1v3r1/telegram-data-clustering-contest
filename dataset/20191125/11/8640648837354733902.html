      <h1>Mountain snow, wet Las Vegas Valley forecast for Thanksgiving week</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T11:45:19+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 11:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/staff/marvin-clemons/" target="_blank">Marvin Clemons</a></address>
      <p>Wet in the valley, white in the mountains with windy conditions and cold temperatures for everyone sums up the Thanksgiving week weather forecast for the Las Vegas region.</p>
      <p>A winter storm advisory is in place for the Spring Mountains and Sheep Range from 4 a.m. Wednesday through 4 a.m. Saturday with 8 to 24 inches of snow possible above 4,000 feet. The higher the elevation, the more snow likely, said meteorologist Jen Varian with the National Weather Service.</p>
      <p>Winds may gust to 40 mph.</p>
      <p>While the forecast calls for a chance of snow in Las Vegas this week, Varian doesn’t think that is likely.</p>
      <p>“Rain is much more likely,” she said.</p>
      <p>Monday will see sunny skies in the valley with a high near 64. Light and variable winds early will become northwest at 11 to 16 mph with gusts as high as 24 mph.</p>
      <p>Monday night will be clear with a low around 38 and northwest winds at 14 to 18 mph, with gusts up to 28 mph.</p>
      <p>Tuesday will remain sunny with a high near 52. Winds will be northerly 5 to 10 mph.</p>
      <p>The chance of rain or snow increases to 60% Wednesday through Thursday. Highs will be in the low 50s.</p>
      <p>A chance of snow enters the Las Vegas forecast after 5 a.m. Wednesday, but the odds are at 30% with little or no snow accumulation.</p>
      <p>The Thanksgiving Day forecast calls for a chance of rain, mostly cloudy and a high near 52.</p>
      <p>The storm could have major impacts on Thanksgiving travel in Lincoln County and the Spring Mountains. The weather service advises considering alternate routes or adjusting your planned travel time.</p>
