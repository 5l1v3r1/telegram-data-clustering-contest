      <p>The increasing selling pressure around the Japanese safe haven is propping up the daily upside in <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/eurjpy"><b>EUR/JPY</b></a> despite the sour mood surrounding the European currency.</p>
      <h3>EUR/JPY looks to trade, risk trends</h3>
      <p>The cross is seen some respite after two consecutive daily pullbacks on the back of the improved <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/sentiment">sentiment</a> in the risk-associated complex at the beginning of the week, which in turn transpired into further weakness in the yen.</p>
      <p>In fact, the cross has managed to regain the 120.00 neighbourhood earlier in the session - area coincident with the 10-day SMA - although the return of EUR-bears has undermined the continuation of the recovery to levels beyond the 120.10 area so far on Monday.</p>
      <p>Data wise in Germany, the IFO survey noted the Business Climate improved a tad to 95.0 in November, while Current Assessment came in at 97.9 and Business Expectations at 92.1, all prints ticking above Octoberâ€™s readings.</p>
      <p>In japan, <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/economic-calendar">Retail Sales</a>, inflation figures and Industrial Production should keep the attention on the yen in the next days.</p>
      <h4>EUR/JPY relevant levels</h4>
      <p>At the moment the cross is gaining 0.16% at 119.88 and faces the next up barrier at 120.68 (high Nov.18) seconded by 121.47 (monthly high Oct.31) and then 121.71 (200-day SMA). On the other hand, a breach of 119.39 (100-day SMA) would expose 119.24 (monthly low Nov.14) and finally 117.07 (monthly low Oct.7).</p>
