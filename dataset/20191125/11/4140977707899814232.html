                      <h3>What do Chelsea have to do in order to ensure Champions League knockout qualification?</h3>
                      <p>In the Champions League, the goal difference is not the first tiebreaker applied to separate the sides in case two or more sides share equal points. It is the head to head result that is first taken into consideration.</p>

                          <p>Should Chelsea lose to Valencia on Wednesday and Ajax beat Lille, the Blues will have a hard time qualifying for the Knock Outs. That is because, if Ajax beat Valencia in their last match and Chelsea beat Lille, both Valencia and Chelsea will be tied on 10 points each.</p>

                            </table>
                            <p>With Valencia having beaten Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, a hypothetical victory over Chelsea this week will mean that they will carry an indomitable lead over the West London side. However, if both Ajax and Chelsea lose their matches, and then win their final encounters, all 3 sides will still be level on 10 points.</p>
                            <h3>Three way deadlock</h3>
                            <p>This would lead to the most interesting of scenarios, because not only will they all have the same points but like Rock Paper Scissors, they would all cancel each other in the head to head scenario. Chelsea beat Ajax at Amsterdam and drew at the bridge. While Ajax would have beaten Valencia both home and away just as Valencia will have beaten Chelsea home and away.</p>
                            <p>The criteria would then revert to goal difference, goals scored, away goals, wins, away wins and disciplinary points in all group matches. And if that fails to help differentiate the trio then the UEFA Club coefficient will come into play.</p>
                            <p>Unless, Ajax suffer a heavy defeat at the hands of Lille, the Dutch side should make it to the last 16 as they currently boast of a very healthy +5 goal difference. Both Chelsea and Valencia have a goal difference of +1. Which means that even if they lose, Chelsea should hope to keep the score line as close as possible and hope to make as huge a margin as possible in their win.</p>
                            <h3>If Valencia win both their matches</h3>
                            <p>However, in the unlikely scenario that Valencia go on to win both their matches against Ajax and Chelsea and both Ajax and Chelsea beat Lille, then Chelsea will advance due to their superior head to head record against Ajax.</p>

                            <p>Of course, if Chelsea simply win both their matches. At 13 points and a superior head to head record over Ajax, they will top the group with the match between Ajax and Valencia deciding the second place; rendering all these calculations obsolete. This is all we have about what Chelsea have to do in order to ensure Champions League knockout qualification.</p>
