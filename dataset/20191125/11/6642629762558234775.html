      <p>World wide web inventor Tim Berners-Lee has released an ambitious plan for online governance designed to counteract the growing prevalence of misinformation, data surveillance and <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/issues/censorship.html">censorship</a>.</p>
      <p>The Contract for the Web, created by Berners-Lee's World Wide Web Foundation, seeks commitments from governments and the industry to make and keep knowledge freely available.</p>
      <p>"If we don't act now - and act together - to prevent the web being misused by those who want to exploit, divide and undermine, we are at risk of squandering" its potential for good, Berners-Lee said in a statement from his foundation on Monday.</p>

      <p>Partners in the non-binding endeavour include <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/google.html">Google</a> and <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/facebook.html">Facebook</a>, whose data-collecting business models and sensation-rewarding algorithms have been blamed for exacerbating online toxicity.</p>
      <p>The British engineer said the contract, developed in cooperation with dozens of experts and members of the public, is "a roadmap to build a better web".</p>
      <p>He called on governments to "strengthen laws and regulations" and companies "to ensure pursuit of profit is not at the expense of <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/categories/human_rights.html">human rights</a> and <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/issues/democracy.html">democracy</a>".</p>
      <p>"Citizens must hold those in power accountable, demand their digital rights be respected and help foster healthy conversation online," Berners-Lee added.</p>

      <p>More than 150 organisations including Microsoft and Reddit and interest groups like Reporters Without Borders and the Electronic Frontier Foundation have backed the plan.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the governments of <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/france.html">France</a>, Germany and <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/ghana.html">Ghana</a> are on board, as are thousands of individuals.</p>
      <p>The unveiling of Berners-Lee's contract comes as leaders from government, business and civil society gather in Berlin, <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/germany.html">Germany</a> for the four-day <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/un.html">United Nations</a> Internet Governance Forum.</p>
      <p>"I will stand up for the preservation of the free internet that we have grown to know and love in recent decades," German economy minister Peter Altmaier said in a statement ahead of the UN gathering.</p>
      <p>Among the concerns that prompted the creation of the contract, Berners-Lee mentioned cyberbullying, uneven access to the internet worldwide and increased governmental control of domestic networks in countries including <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/china.html">China</a>, Iran and <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/russia.html">Russia</a>.</p>
      <p>"The trend for Balkanisation is really worrying and it's extreme at the moment in <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/iran.html">Iran</a>," said Berners-Lee. "A strong government exhibits tolerance, the computer scientist added, for other voices, opposition voices, foreign voices to be heard by its citizens."</p>
