      <h1>Hong Kong part of China 'no matter what happens' in elections: FM</h1>

      <p>Hong Kong is a part of China "no matter what happens", Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Monday, with the crisis-hit city's pro-democracy looking set for a crushing victory in community-level elections at the weekend.</p>
      <p>The results of Sunday's elections in the semi-autonomous city have sent the Beijing-backed government a clear message of public support for the demands of a protest movement that has gripped the territory for months.</p>
      <p>Counting was still under way following record turnout, but partial results indicated that candidates favoring greater democracy were on course to seize a shock majority of the normally establishment-dominated 18 district councils.</p>
      <p>"It's not the final result yet. Let's wait for the final result, OK? However, it is clear that no matter what happens, Hong Kong is a part of China and a special administrative region of China," Wang told reporters after he met with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in Tokyo.</p>
      <p>"Any attempt to mess up Hong Kong, or even damage its prosperity and stability, will not succeed."</p>
      <p>Hong Kong has been rocked by months of pro-democracy protests over concerns that Beijing is chipping away at the financial hub's special rights, which are unheard of in the mainland, including freedom of speech and an independent judiciary.</p>
