      <h1>The signs your neighbour could be a victim of domestic abuse</h1>
      <h2>Avon and Somerset police are asking people living in rural locations to be particularly vigilant</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T11:25:18+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 11:25</time> by <a rel="author">Briana Millett</a></address>
      <p>Rural and isolated locations are being used as a weapon by domestic abusers, according to a new report.</p>
      <p>Avon and Somerset Constabulary are encouraging people to look out for the signs of domestic abuse, particularly those who live in rural communities.</p>
      <p>A recent report reveals survivors living in more isolated rural areas are less likely to report it or ask for help.</p>
      <p>According to the report, which was published by the National Rural Crime Network (NRCN), abuse lasts an average of 25 per cent longer in rural locations, with victims half as likely to report abuse.</p>
      <p>Between 2016 and 2018, police in Avon and Somerset logged an 8.3 per cent increase in domestic abuse cases.</p>
      <p>But the force says those living in rural areas are still at high risk of under-reporting, due to a lack of access to available services due to location, fear of reprisals from tight-knit communities, as well as the stigma and shame associated with domestic abuse. </p>
      <p>The force's lead for domestic abuse, Superintendent Deryck Rees, said: “It’s not always easy to immediately recognise the signs that someone being abused.</p>
      <p>"But, if you notice something isn’t quite right with a friend, neighbour, or someone from your community, we urge you to look, listen, ask and ask again.</p>
      <p>"Some of the things to look out for could be your friend being texted an inappropriate number of times by their partner when they aren’t together, sudden lack of contact from someone, or over-hearing abusive language from neighbours during an argument."</p>
      <h3>Signs someone you know may be in an abusive relationship</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>They withdraw from their circle of friends and do less with other people</li>
        <li>They receive lots of phone calls or texts from their partner when they are not with them</li>
        <li>They become anxious when they might be home late or plans change</li>
        <li>They have unexplained bruises or physical injuries</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Signs you are in an abusive relationship</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Your partner is violent or threatening towards you</li>
        <li>Your partner criticises you and puts you down</li>
        <li>Your partner is controlling about what you do, where you go, who you see or what you spend</li>
        <li>You feel afraid of your partner</li>
        <li>You think you are to blame for the way your partner treats you</li>
        <li>You feel embarrassed when your friends and family see how partner treats you</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Chair of the NRCN Julia Mulligan said: "Our research shows clearly that domestic abuse is hidden under our noses, hidden by abusers who like to keep it that way and on a scale of abuse hitherto unseen.</p>
      <p>“All parties with a duty to help victims; the police, support services, charities, Police and Crime Commissioners, health services, and many others, need to understand that we have missed this. We have let victims and survivors down. We have collectively failed. We need to put that right.</p>
      <p>“We need to better protect the women, children and men in rural communities who suffer daily at the hands of calculating, manipulating, controlling and violent abusers. I hope this campaign helps achieve that across Avon and Somerset.”</p>
