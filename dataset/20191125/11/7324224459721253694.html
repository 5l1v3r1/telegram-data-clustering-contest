      <p>Scottish independence is “back on the table again” because of Brexit, Tony Blair has said.</p>
      <p>The former Labour prime minister gave a speech in London on Brexit and the General Election and said Boris Johnson’s deal – where Northern Ireland remains more closely aligned to the European Union than the rest of the EU – added “an additional dimension” to the nationalists’ argument.</p>
      <p>Speaking to a Reuters Newsmakers event on Monday morning, Mr Blair said: “I don’t think campaigning for an independent Scotland is extreme. I just don’t agree with it.</p>

      <p>“I think the United Kingdom is stronger if we’re all together, I think Scotland is better off inside the UK.</p>
      <p>“But, you know, Brexit has put it back on the table again. This part of the other problem, I’m afraid, is that you’ve got a situation with Northern Ireland which is very tricky if the Johnson deal goes forward.</p>
      <p>“You’ve got a situation where obviously the Scottish nationalists now have an additional dimension to their argument.</p>
      <p>“I still don’t agree with it, but, you know, they’re going to be saying: ‘You’ve allowed Northern Ireland to stay inside the single market, why aren’t we allowed to, we also voted heavily against Brexit?'”</p>
