      <h1>Intel gets green light for new $4bn facility in Leixlip</h1>
      <h2>Appeals board gives the chip giant the go-ahead for the proposed FAB project</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T11:30:09+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 11:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishtimes.com/profile/gordon-deegan-7.1837475" target="_blank">Gordon Deegan</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=An+Bord+Plean%C3%A1la">An Bord Pleanála</a> has given the green light to plans by <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Intel">Intel</a> for its proposed new $4 billion (€3.63bn) manufacturing fabrication (FAB) facility at its <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=Leixlip">Leixlip</a> plant.</p>
      <p>The appeals board has given the chip giant the go-ahead for the project after finding that the plan would constitute a reasonable and orderly expansion of the existing manufacturing use at the location.</p>
      <p>The proposal was opposed by local farmer, <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Thomas+Reid">Thomas Reid</a> who last June appealed the <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=Kildare+County+Council">Kildare County Council</a> decision to grant to An Bord Pleanala.</p>
      <p>The planning permission follows three years on after Intel secured planning permission for the first phase of the ‘fab’ facility valued at $4 billion.</p>

      <p>In total, the two planning permissions represent a $8 billion (€7.26 billion) investment which will employ 6,000 construction workers at peak and 1,600 full time jobs on completion.</p>
      <p>The projects represent the largest single private investment in the history of the State on one project if given the go-ahead by Intel globally.</p>
      <p>Consultants for Intel told <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=Kildare+Co+Council">Kildare Co Council</a> that the firm has already invested $12.5 billion on its site at Leixlip.</p>
      <p>The appeals board gave the plan the go-ahead after concluding that the proposal accords with national, regional and local planning policy and would not be injurious to amenities of the area or property in the vicinity.</p>
      <p>The board order upheld the recommendation to grant by Senior Planning inspector, <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Paul+Caprani">Paul Caprani</a> at the end of his 83 page report.</p>
      <p>The application is the eighth Intel Leixlip application Mr Reid has objected to since 2012 with six previous applications brought before An Bord Pleanála by Mr Reid.</p>
      <p>Mr Reid unsuccessfully opposed the $4 billion first phase of the ‘fab’ plan in 2017 when lodging an objection against the application and then appealing the Council decision to An Bord Pleanála.</p>
