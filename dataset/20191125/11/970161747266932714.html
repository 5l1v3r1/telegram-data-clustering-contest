      <p>Only Fools and Horses star John Challis claims that <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/prince-andrew-duke-of-york/">Prince Andrew</a> should be ‘given a break’ amidst allegations about his 10-year friendship with Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
      <p>The Duke of York has faced a barrage of criticism following <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/prince-andrew-defends-car-crash-interview-saying-spoke-honesty-humility-11173141/">his BBC Newsnight interview</a>, with the royal accused of a lack of empathy with convicted sex offender Epstein’s victims.</p>
      <p>Following the interview and the resulting backlash, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/25/prince-andrew-step-back-patronages-car-crash-interview-11213216/">Andrew has stepped back from all 230 of his patronages</a>, resigned from his Pitch@Palace project and s<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/queen-gives-prince-andrew-permission-step-back-public-duties-epstein-links-11190989/">tepped down from royal duties for the ‘foreseeable future’.</a></p>

      <p>However, Challis does not think Andrew should be stripped of his royal title.</p>

      <p>Speaking on today’s edition of Jeremy Vine on Channel 5, the 77-year-old – best known for playing Boycie on Only Fools and Horses – said: ‘I think that the poor man’s made an awful lot of mistakes which he now regrets, obviously. What he’s done, retiring and so on from the public gaze, I think is exactly what should happen.</p>
      <p>‘But I think he should be given a break, because after all, nothing’s been proved, has it? There’s no proof.’</p>
      <p>The Benidorm star continued: ‘He’s made mistakes, as I said, he’s a good time lad and he’s a playboy, whatever that means. He also flew a helicopter in the Falklands. So that was a good thing and he was very good at it and he did well out there.</p>
      <p>‘He’s fragile, like we all are. I think he should be given a chance to actually make things better.’</p>

      <p>However, panellist Salma El-Wardany questioned whether ‘hanging out’ with Epstein could be referred to as a mistake.</p>
      <p>During his Newsnight interview, Andrew, questioned by Emily Maitlis, twice stated his relationship with Epstein, who died in jail while facing sex trafficking charges, had some ‘seriously beneficial outcomes’, giving him the opportunity to meet people and prepare for a future role as a trade envoy.</p>

      <p>The Duke denied he slept with Virginia Giuffre, one of Epstein’s victims, on three separate occasions, twice while she was underage, saying one encounter in 2001 did not happen as he spent the day with his daughter Princess Beatrice, taking her to Pizza Express in Woking for a party.</p>

      <p>The same alleged sexual liaison, which the American said began with the royal sweating heavily as they danced at London nightclub Tramp, was ‘factually wrong’ as the Duke claimed he had a medical condition at the time which meant he did not sweat.</p>
      <p>He cast doubt on the authenticity of a picture that appears to show Andrew with his arm around the waist of Mrs Giuffre, when a teenager.</p>
      <p>The royal said: ‘… from the investigations that we’ve done, you can’t prove whether or not that photograph is faked or not because it is a photograph of a photograph of a photograph. So it’s very difficult to be able to prove it but I don’t remember that photograph ever being taken.’</p>
