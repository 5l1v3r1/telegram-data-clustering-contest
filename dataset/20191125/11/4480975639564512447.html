      <h1>UK: Retailers' sales broadly unchanged in November after falling for six months</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T11:20:22+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 11:20</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fxstreet.com/author/eren-%C5%9Fengezer" target="_blank">Eren Sengezer</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/economic-calendar">Retail sales</a> in the United Kingdom in November were broadly unchanged on a yearly basis, the latest data published by the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) showed on Monday.</p>
      <p>"38% of respondents reported that sales volumes were up on a year ago in November, while 41% said they were down, giving a balance of -3% - the highest balance in 7 months," the CBI noted in its publication.</p>
      <p>Commenting on the data, "Retailers are entering the festive season with a bit of hope that sales will head up, with the strongest expectations in half a year," said Anna Leach, CBI Deputy Chief Economist. "Actual sales have also stabilised and have nudged above average for the time of year."</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/currencies/gbpusd">British pound</a> largely ignored the data and the GBP/USD pair was last seen trading at 1.2880, adding 0.3% on a daily basis.</p>
