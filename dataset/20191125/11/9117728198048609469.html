        <b>Former F1 driver Felipe Massa says that F1 drivers on the fringe of the grid see Formula E as a back up plan if they fail to secure a seat in F1. The all-electric series features a number of recent F1 drivers, such as Stoffel Vandoorne, Jean-Eric Vergne and Brendon Hartley. </b>
      </p>
      <p>Even Alex Albon was set to race last season before Toro Rosso called him up to the F1 team, so Formula E really is a growing series and the former Sauber, Ferrari and Williams star says that more F1 drivers will make the move across.</p>

      <p>He told The Mirror: <i>“Formula E is doing exactly what needs to be done. It is growing.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“When a championship is growing and getting bigger and bigger, all the big names are interested. It was the only championship I was looking to come and race after Formula 1.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“I concentrate on Formula E, because I believe in the future of Formula E more than I believe in the future of the other championship.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“I am sure that any driver that does not have the possibility to stay in Formula 1, they will try and come to Formula E. I am 100 per cent sure.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“Every driver here can race in Formula 1 and everyone here can be successful in Formula 1 in the end."</i>
