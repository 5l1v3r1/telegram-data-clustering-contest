      <h1>Simon Cowell planning Christmas charity single featuring X Factor: Celebrity stars</h1>
      <h2>He's doing it for the kids</h2>

      <p>The <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/x-factor/">X Factor</a>'s winner's song is as much a part of Christmas as Santa, turkey and tinsel.</p>
      <p>However, this year, show supremo Simon Cowell has decided to do things a little differently with news that the winner's single has been dropped.</p>
      <p>Instead of the winner of The X Factor: Celebrity releasing a single to vie for the coveted Christmas number one spot, all the hopefuls will instead release a charity single.</p>

      <p>A source explained why Simon had decided to ditch the winner's single and reinstate the show's charity single – which last hit the charts back in 2011.</p>

      <p>They said: "Since streaming influenced the charts, it’s become incredibly difficult for X Factor acts to top the charts on the back of the show, so everyone is being realistic."</p>
      <p>They added: "The winner’s song is just being rested, because a group charity track just seemed a better fit this time round."</p>
