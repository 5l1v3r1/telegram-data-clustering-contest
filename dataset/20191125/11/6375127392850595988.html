      <h1>Reopening of historic bridge lures thousands</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T11:14:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 11:14</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://journal.com.ph/authors/itchie-g-cabayan" target="_blank">Itchie G. Cabayan</a></address>
      <h3>AN estimated crowd of  5,000 to 7,000 flocked to Jones Bridge in Binondo, Manila the other night to witness the inauguration of the newly-refurbished historic bridge that connects P. Burgos, Intramuros to the areas of Chinatown and Escolta Avenue and the continuing journey of Manila toward being known as ‘the city of lights.’</h3>
      <p>In his speech, Mayor Isko Moreno called on the citizens to keep an eye on lawless elements who may cause any damage to the bridge and to effect citizens’ arrest if possible.</p>
      <p>‘Be vigilant. ‘Yung mga magdudumi dito, arestuhin ninyo, taumbayan.</p>
      <p>Hindi lang amin ito. Bilang pamahalaan, sa ating lahat ito... bilang Pilipino, bilang Manilenyo. You own it. ‘Wag ninyong hayaan ang isang tolongges na babuyin ang mga bagay na pag-aari natin. May kaakibat na responsibilidad sa kalayaang ating tinatanggap,’ Moreno stressed, eliciting cheers from the approving crowd.</p>
      <p>The event, led by Moreno and Vice Mayor Honey Lacuna, as well as city officials headed by secretary to the mayor Bernie Ang who was also a full-termer third district City Councilor,  third district Congressman Yul Servo and private donors, was highlighted by the lighting up of the entire bridge, fireworks and the return of the La Madre Filipina statue to the foot of the bridge where it originally stood in 1938.  </p>
      <p>Moreno cited the efforts of city engineer Armand Andres,department of public services chief Kenneth Amurao and tourism chief Charlie Dungo to make the affair an eventful one, said that architect Jerry Acuzar, whose help he also acknowledged, expressed surprise that the Jones Bridge rehabilitation project that would have taken two years to finish was done in just a two months.</p>
      <p>The mayor explained that while there are a number of bridges in Manila, Jones Bridge became the focus of such a major rehabilitation as it marked its 100th year and owing to the role it played to connect the Spanish and Chinese communities from Intramuros and Binondo, respectively, during the Spanish occupation.</p>
      <p>At this point, Moreno called on the youth to look back at and give importance to the country’s history and patrimony.</p>
      <p>‘Sa mga kabataan na busy kakapanood ng Youtube, maganda din mag- google kayo dahil ang hindi marunong lumingon sa nakaraan ay di makararating sa paroroonan,’ he said.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile,  the return to its original site of the La Madre Filipina statue created by Juan Arellano, is significant in that it stood as ‘silent witness’ to the so-called ‘Battle for Manila’ during World War II, when the country was  liberated  from  the Japanese occupation by allied forces. Reportedly, there were four such  sculptures that used to sit atop posts on both ends of the pre-war Jones Bridge.  One was destroyed during the war, one was relocated to the Rizal Park while the remaining two were relocated to the Court of Appeals building in Manila.</p>
