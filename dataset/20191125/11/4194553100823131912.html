      <h1>Liverpool Target Jadon Sancho Feels “Humiliated, Scapegoated And Unprotected” By Borussia Dortmun</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T11:11:46+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 11:11</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/tomsimmons/" target="_blank">Tom Simmons</a></address>
      <p>Borussia Dortmund and England starlet Jadon Sancho is very unhappy with the current state of affairs over in Germany, according to a report from <a href="https://theathletic.com/1403402/2019/11/24/exclusive-jadon-sancho-feels-humiliated-and-scapegoated-by-dortmund-amid-interest-from-barcelona-liverpool-united-and-real/">The Athletic</a>.</p>
      <p>The 19-year-old, a subject of <a href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/category/transfer-rumours/">transfer interest</a> for Premier League leaders Liverpool, has lodged five goals and nine assists in BVB colours this season but his production has been overshadowed by two incidents which leave him feeling like he is being picked on by the club.</p>
      <p>Sancho was fined £86,000 and dropped for a match after returning late from international duty with the Three Lions in October, and an early substitution during a 4-0 loss to Bayern Munich on November 9 was particularly embarrassing.</p>
      <p>Manager Lucien Favre took the winger off just 36 minutes into the game and would publicly humiliate him by telling reporters he did not come off because of an injury, adding that his performance was just not good enough.</p>
      <p>“It is a sequence of events – in particular the substitution in Munich – that The Athletic understands has left Sancho feeling humiliated, scapegoated and unprotected by his employers,” David Ornstein writes.</p>
      <p>“Although the club have not communicated a desire to sell Sancho in the upcoming window, their enquiries and handling of the various issues are claimed to have upset and confused the player.”</p>
      <p>Sancho’s representatives feel the young England international is being treated unfairly and is being made to shoulder most of the blame for Dortmund’s poor performances this season. They also consider Favre’s actions to be “disgraceful,” considering he was well aware of the player’s ability to turn games around yet did not wait until halftime to take him off, before admonishing him in the press.</p>
      <p>According to the report, Sancho expects to leave Dortmund next summer. Liverpool are among current suitors, the list of which has narrowed down to Barcelona, Manchester United and Real Madrid. His former club, Manchester City, have asked to be kept informed of the situation while Chelsea, the club he grew up supporting, have yet to make contact.</p>
      <p>While Chelsea hold a bit of an advantage due to Sancho’s support, the Reds seem the most likely option if he’s to return to England, absent the Stamford Bridge side making him an offer. Working under a manager like Jurgen Klopp would only serve his development but his arrival could present the German coach with a bit of a headache given how good Liverpool have been over the last few years.</p>
      <p>The Champions League holders kept their run of wins going with a late victory over Crystal Palace on Saturday and have maintained an eight-point gap over second place in the league standings. They’re the obvious favourites to lift the Premier League title at the end of the campaign and you could take Bet365 up on their 2/5 offer as it relates to their credentials. You could also <a href="https://www.freebets.co.uk/betting-tips/football">check out these football betting tips at freebets.co.uk</a>, where you could find information on the best odds, offers and free bets.</p>
      <p>City remain in the hunt for a third straight first-place finish but have a lot of ground to make up as they’re nine points adrift of the Reds. William Hill have 9/4 running on their chances while Leicester City are 28/1 with Skybet and Chelsea are at 90/1 with Betfair.</p>
      <p>Klopp’s side will host Brighton &amp; Hove Albion at Anfield in their next fixture and are 1/5 to win with Ladbrokes. The bookmakers are also offering 11/2 on a draw and 14/1 on a Brighton win.</p>
