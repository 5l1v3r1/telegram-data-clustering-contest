      <p>These Black Friday Surface Pro deals offer the brand new Surface Pro 7 for as little as £699, with configurations potentially saving you an amazing £375 on some of the higher-end models all before <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/black-friday/black-friday-deals-2019">Black Friday</a>. There's a range of specifications on offer here, with low prices on everything from cheaper everyday machines to high-end creative powerhouses, so be sure to check out the full spectrum of deals.</p>
      <p>The Surface Pro 7 is the latest in Microsoft's lineup of 2-in-1 computers - boasting incredible processing speeds thanks to Intel's new 10-nanometer processors installed in even the cheapest specs you'll find on sale here. Even if the physical build and general set of features haven't changed much since the Pro 6 mode, you're getting a huge boost in raw power with this 2019 version. While the battery life can't compete with (far) less powerful machines, the handy fast-charge will keep you topped up on the go. Ultra-thin and amazingly portable, the Surface Pro range is ready for anything thanks to the Surface Pen and an incredibly light footprint. </p>
      <p>What's more, you're also getting the Type Cover included in these Black Friday Surface Pro deals. Many retailers neglect to include this crucial aspect of the experience, so knowing you've got everything covered in one bundle is a nice bonus. You're getting a far cheaper price on the computer itself, and an otherwise pricey accessory included in the tag - the perfect recipe for a fantastic bundle deal. We've built the bundles below using the standard £124.99 Surface Pro Type Cover, but you can also upgrade to the Signature or Special Editions for an extra premium. </p>
      <p>If you're looking for something with even more power, you'll want to take a look at this <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/black-friday/this-surface-book-2-deal-cuts-an-incredible-pound630-off-the-asking-price">Surface Book 2 deal</a>. For just <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/store/config/Surface-Book-2/8MCPZJJCC98C?">£919</a> you can pick up a 13.5-inch Surface Book 2 with 8GB of RAM, a 7th gen i5 processor and a 128GB SSD - saving you £500! You can play with the exact specifications you're after and build your own perfect device, with that £500 saving transferring across each build. </p>
