      <h1>We're going to move to Mars and it will change life on Earth forever</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T11:26:10+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 11:26</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://metro.co.uk/author/jasper-hamill/" target="_blank">Jasper Hamill</a></address>
      <p>Humanity took its first giant leap into space less than a century ago – but now we’re seriously considering a move to Mars.</p>
      <p>The second space race is already underway, with Nasa planning to land astronauts on the Red Planet in the 2030s and China hoping its taikonauts will follow soon after.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Elon Musk is plotting his own expedition, meaning the first-ever successful manned mission to another planet could be achieved by a private company, rather than a nation.</p>
      <p>And once we’ve touched down on Mars, the real hard work will begin on building a settlement or ‘habitat’ to sustain long-term human populations.</p>
      <p>But what many people don’t realise is the profound effect a Martian development will have on people left behind on Earth.</p>
      <p>The technology developed to achieve the monumental feat of landing and settling on Mars will also be used to improve life back on our own planet – and there’s a precedent for this because Nasa’s Apollo missions led to the creation of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/07/20/nasa-reveals-apollo-11-moon-landings-changed-life-earth-10431916/">several major technologies which are still in general use today</a>.</p>

      <p>To get a sense of how travelling to the Red Planet will change life on Earth, we spoke to Eleanor Watson, curator of a new exhibition at London’s Design Museum called ‘Moving to Mars’ which opens on October 18.</p>

      <p>She said: ‘One of the most exciting things about working on this project was realising how much of the technology developed for a mission to Mars will have very relevant Earth applications.</p>
      <p>‘The Martian habitats will have to generate zero waste and use low energy, high yield farming systems, for instance.</p>
      <p>‘This feels very pressing given our own situation on Earth.’</p>
      <p>Watson spoke to many top designers who are working with Nasa and other organisations to develop technology for Mars missions.</p>
      <p>One of her favourite creations came from a designer called Anna Talvi, who designed clothes to help astronauts keep healthy whilst travelling through space.</p>
      <p>‘In space, due to lack of gravity, your muscles degenerate and you lose bone mass because you’re not getting the exercise you get on Earth by just pushing against gravity,’ Watson added.</p>
      <p>‘Her clothes have built-in restraints which force the wearer to use their muscles in an everyday way.</p>
      <p>‘They are medical tools which can be worn without making the wearer feel they are being constricted by medical clothing.’</p>

      <p>Before astronauts even get to Mars, they will have to face an epic odyssey through the void.</p>
      <p>Making this trip bearable will be a huge feat of innovation and require expert design.</p>
      <p>‘A trip to Mars will take three days – whilst a journey to Mars and back will take three years,’ Watson said.</p>
      <p>‘What is acceptable and feasible for a human to endure for three days is not the same as what is feasible for a human to endure over the course of three years.</p>
      <p>‘You suddenly have to put humans at the centre of design rather than tech and machines in order to make the mission physically and psychologically possible</p>
      <p>‘It would be absolutely horrible. Imagine being stuck with a few other people with no way out? I think that’s incredibly stressful and needs careful consideration.’</p>
      <p>At the moment, Mars is red, dead, airless and inhospitable to life – so why would anyone want to travel there, let alone settle in an artificial habitat they cannot leave without wearing a spacesuit?</p>
      <p>Watson added: ‘There are many types of people who want to go to Mars.</p>
      <p>‘There is definitely a doomsday gang who think of the planet as a lifeboat for humanity.</p>
      <p>‘If Earth is hit by what Elon Musk calls an “extinction-level event”, then Mars is the perfect Plan B because we could send a few humans there to ensure the entire species doesn’t get wiped out.</p>
      <p>‘But there are other views too. We’re working with a Mars geologist called Professor Sanjeev Gupta who is interested in visiting Mars because there are no tectonic plates moving around, meaning the rocks are very old.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘If we dig down into Mars we could find rocks which helps us to find out the origins of the universe – which seems pretty exciting.’</p>

      <p>It’s also worth thinking about the politics of a Martian settlement, because a settlement would have to be built along entirely new lines, rather like what happened when the Founding Fathers laid the groundwork for the United States of America.</p>
      <p>‘There is a degree of utopian thinking in all of this,’ Watson continued.</p>
      <p>‘Maybe you wouldn’t have countries, because it would be a global endeavour.</p>
      <p>‘Perhaps resources will be shared equally. All of this is up for grabs.</p>
      <p>‘However, there is always a need for control. It costs a huge amount of money to get to Mars, so whether it’s public enterprise or private corporations who are going there, it will only be a select few who make that journey – so that’s ultimately tied up with power.’</p>
      <p>We asked the curator whether she’d consider moving to Mars herself after hearing all the great ideas about how it could be done.</p>
      <p>‘No way – not a chance,’ she replied.</p>
      <p>‘The thing that gets me is there is no water there and it never rains.</p>
      <p>‘The thought of being on a planet where you will never again hear the sound of rain or be able to swim or have any experience with water other than a frugal shower every now and then does not appeal to me.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘Also, people going there would suffer from severe sensory deprivation.</p>
      <p>‘There is no flora or fauna at all – which means there is just rocks and dust.</p>
      <p>‘The whole planet is one colour with no great variation in smell or sound.</p>
      <p>‘It is really very monotonous and makes you appreciate the huge richness and variety of our planet.’</p>

      <p>The quality of life on Mars will depend heavily on the quality of the settlements which are built on its barren surface.</p>
      <p>To sustain long-term communities, these buildings will have to be comfortable enough for humans to live inside yet also capable of hosting life support systems, generating clean water and sustaining agriculture.</p>
      <p>We’re a long way off building a Martian habitat, but Nasa has already launched a bid to work out how to construct basic buildings on the Red Planet.</p>
      <p>It recently named the winner of a competition called the 3D-Printed Habitat Challenge, which asked companies to devise a robotic system capable of building structures without human intervention.</p>
      <p>The $500,000 top prize went to New York-based AI SpaceFactory, which devised a way of using the Martian ‘regolith’ to print structures.</p>
      <p>Regolith is the material covering a planet and, on Mars, contains the volcanic rock basalt.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screenshot-2019-10-14-at-12.26.36-80bd.png?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;zoom=1&amp;resize=526%2C584&amp;ssl=1"/>

      </figure>
      <p>AI SpaceFactory combined basalt with a biopolymer called PLA that’s made from a plant extract found in corn or sugar cane.</p>
      <p>This allowed them to produce a material that is stronger than concrete and does not require vast quantities of water – a substance in short supply on Mars.</p>
      <p>It’s already demonstrated the technique of printing out structures using Martian regolith during the Nasa competition and is working on its first buildings on Earth – with a small structure in upstate New York expected to be be opened to visitors by March next year.</p>
      <p>Best of all, its innovative basalt fibre material is recyclable, meaning old buildings can be pulled down and the materials used again.</p>

      <p>‘The premise of the Nasa challenge was to build structures autonomously on Mars before humans get there,’ said CEO David Malott.</p>
      <p>‘Our technology will allow us to make the first footprint on Mars.’</p>
      <p>He’s also excited about the first Earth development built using the technique, which will be called Tera.</p>
      <p>‘It’s the literal transformation of space technology for Earth applications,’ Malott added.</p>
      <p>‘We were printing in the woods recently and it was so quiet you could hear the crickets.</p>
      <p>‘It was unlike any other construction site on Earth – and I’ve been to a lot.</p>
      <p>‘I think we’re on to something here which could potentially transform how we see construction.</p>
      <p>‘It could be used in situations like a hurricane or natural disaster, because we could send out a small task force of 3D printing robots to build habitats using a technique that’s a close analogue to what we have to do to build on the moon and Mars.’ It remains to be seen which nation or company will be the first to land on Mars – let alone who will undertake this brave mission. But the technology developed during the journey to Mars is certainly likely to help us live a better life here on Earth. So even if you’re not brave enough to travel to the Red Planet, it could soon have a profound effect on your earthly existence.</p>
