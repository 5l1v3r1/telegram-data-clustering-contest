      <p>To date, more than 2190 suspected cases have been reported since the epidemic started last month. In addition, the death toll has risen to 25, of which 24 were children.</p>
      <p>According to Director General of Health Leausa Take Naseri, 20 children are currently in intensive care in critical condition for treatment.</p>
      <p>Less than 30 percent of the Samoan population is fully vaccinated against measles.</p>
      <p>Samoa declared a state of emergency nine days ago, closing all its schools, banning children from public gatherings and mandating that everybody get vaccinated. Teams of people have been traveling the country administering thousands of vaccines.</p>
      <p>Since the Mass Vaccination Campaign on 20 Nov 2019, the Ministry has successfully vaccinated 17,088 individuals.</p>
