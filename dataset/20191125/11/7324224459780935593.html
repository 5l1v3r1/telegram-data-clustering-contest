      <h1>The Summerhouse pub pays homage to Hollywood with new Christmas lights display</h1>
      <h2>A pub well known for its Christmas lights has launched a new theme for 2019 which should be a hit with movie fans.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T11:24:33+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 11:24</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.expressandstar.com/news/authors/jamie-brassington/" target="_blank">Jamie Brassington</a></address>
      <p>The Summerhouse Pub, in Gospel End Road, near Sedgley, has been intricately decorated with props hinting to iconic films.</p>
      <p>The roof features figures of ET and Elliot, from the 1982-movie E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere in the pub grounds, there is a 10ft figure of Olaf, from the 2013-hit film Frozen, characters from the film series Toy Story, Indiana Jones and Mary Poppins.</p>
      <p>Past themes have included Disney movie.</p>
      <p>The pub is well known for its extravagant display of Christmas decorations each year, with the owners going the extra mile to put on a show.</p>
      <p>Karen Kennedy, 44, who runs the pub alongside her husband Philip, said: "Putting on these decorations just promotes a good sense of community spirit.</p>
      <p>"This place is a bit of a Christmas pub. I think everyone around here expects us to put on the decorations.</p>
      <p>"We also raise money for a good cause - for the Heartlink Children's Charity that saved our daughters life, Zoe (13), when she was born."</p>
      <p>A lot of effort goes into decorating The Summerhouse each year, and preparations began back in September.</p>
      <p>More than 20,00 bulbs are used to light up the decorations, however the cost is relatively cheap, as the owners used LED lights.</p>
      <p>Karen has asked customers to donate money when they visit the pub, with a wishing well located outside and charity buckets inside.</p>
      <p>Writing on the pub's Facebook page, she said: "We would be immensely grateful if you would throw a coin or two in the wishing well outside or in any of the charity buckets around the building. Thank you and Merry Christmas!"</p>
