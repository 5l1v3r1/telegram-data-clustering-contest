      <h1>Good Juju is a Borderlands 3 gun that’s basically Bad Juju from Destiny</h1>

      <p>It seems someone at Borderlands 3 dev Gearbox is an avid Destiny fan, because they’ve created a very earnest reference to Bungie’s shooter.</p>
      <p><b>Borderlands 3</b> players came across a new Legendary assault rifle in the game called Good Juju. If the name doesn’t immediatly ring a bell; it is an Easter egg referencing the Destiny (<a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/07/10/destiny-2-bad-juju-exotic-quest-guide/">and Destiny 2</a>) pulse rifle Bad Juju.</p>
      <p>Just in case the name and weapon design weren’t obvious enough, Gearbox also made sure the rest of the weapon’s make-up stands out. Good Juju is a burst-fire assault rifle that reloads on kill, has a similar look to Bad Juju. Further proving the lineage, Good Juju’s flavour text reads, “Kinda sorta wants to end all existence”, a refrence to Bad Juju’s own “If you believe your weapon wants to end all existence, so it will.”</p>
      <p>YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQWLfD-5sexEbVY335J8PMg">Joltzdude139</a> made a video showing off Good Juju, which you can watch below:</p>

      <p>As others pointed out on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/e09vuw/easter_egg_new_borderlands_3_weapon_good_juju/">Reddit</a>, this isn’t the first time Borderlands 3 made a nod to Destiny. There’s a rare enemy called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ep9gINFLqyk">Dinklebot</a> that drops a Loot-O-Gram, which can be turned in for a weapon.</p>
      <p>Dinklebot being, of course, the nickname the community gave the original Ghost, which used to be voiced by Peter Dinklage.</p>
