      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 25): Plantation player TSH Resources Bhd announced today a 25.7% decline in net profit to RM6.03 million for its third quarter ended Sept 30, 2019, from RM8.12 million a year ago.</p>
      <p>This was as quarterly revenue contracted 9.7% to RM203.81 million from RM225.76 million in the year-ago quarter, mainly due to lower average crude palm oil (CPO) and palm kernel selling prices, its exchange filing today showed.</p>
      <p>For the nine-month period, TSH's net profit is down 14.7% at RM25.63 million, compared with RM30.05 million in the preceding year's corresponding quarter, while revenue fell 12.8% to RM597.46 million from RM684.81 million previously.</p>
      <p>TSH anticipates the performance for its remaining quarter to be satisfactory if the recent CPO price recovery continues.</p>
      <p>The management will continue its focus on productivity and efficiency improvement to reduce the unit cost of production.</p>
      <p>"The board remains optimistic on the long term prospects of the palm oil industry due to the higher per capita income, many health qualities of palm oil and population growth, which will drive greater demand.</p>
      <p>"Palm products segment, which accounts for approximately 85% of the revenue for the group, will remain the core contributor to the group's profit," TSH said.</p>
      <p>Shares in TSH closed three sen up at RM1.16 today for a market capitalisation of RM1.6 billion.</p>
