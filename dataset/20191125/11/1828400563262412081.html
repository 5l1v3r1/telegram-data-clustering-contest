      <p>It comes after the National League South outfit drew 2-2 with Dartford in the FA Trophy on Saturday, sending the game to a replay on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>After concluding that tie, Maidstone will then make the long journey up to Bloomfield Road on Sunday to take on the Seasiders in their FA Cup second round clash.</p>
      <p>Still was disappointed with his side's lacklustre display against Dartford, going on to say they were fortunate to avoid defeat.</p>
      <p>Asked if the players had one eye on Blackpool, Still told <i>Kent Online</i>: “Yes, I do think that but as we said before the game, if we feel people aren’t actually putting it in, we’re not going to play you next week.</p>
      <p>“People have to understand that at this level we’re never, ever in a million years going to win the FA Cup but you could win the FA Trophy, which is an unbelievable day out, and I think people should die to do that.</p>
      <p>“There’s no bigger game next week because we haven’t picked a team for it. The bigger game was today.</p>
      <p>“It was lacklustre, there was no real energy, no real up and at ‘em, the game was slower, we didn’t speed it up.</p>
      <p>“All the things we normally do and the way we normally play wasn’t evident - it was really disappointing.</p>
      <p>“If you get beat, get beat, there’s nothing wrong in being beat, but don’t get beat when you think we could have done a lot more.</p>
      <p>“We’ve had a result because I think we deserved to get beat.”</p>
      <p>Maidstone could perhaps have done without a replay in the FA Trophy, but Still says he has no intention of fielding a weakened side on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>He added: “I don’t think there’s any fear of us not being strong, strong. I’d sooner be strong, strong there and not strong at Blackpool to be honest.</p>
      <p>“That’s more important to us, that’s a chance for this club to go to Wembley. Who’s going to pass that by?"</p>
      <p>The game between Blackpool and Maidstone will take place on Sunday, December 1.</p>
      <p>The fixture, which will be one of several ties to feature on BBC's Final Score 'live goals' programme, will kick off at the earlier time of 2pm.</p>
      <p>The Seasiders will pocket an extra £12,500 fee for appearing on the show, which will be added to their £54,000 in prize money should they win.</p>
