        <b>John Higgins heads to York this week looking for a fifth UK Championship title, but is also looking to end a dreadful run in the event by his lofty standards.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 44-year-old last won the UK Championship in 2010, the last year it was held in Telford, but since it moved to York in 2011 he has not been beyond the quarter-finals.</p>
      <p>A second round defeat to fellow Scot Alan McManus in 2018 made it eight visits to the Barbican Centre without a semi-final appearance, which is a serious barren spell for a man who has won four world titles.</p>
      <p>Higgins has a plan to turn his fortunes around and that is a new cue, which he hopes will see him end his already sensational career in fine style.</p>
      <p>‘I’ve changed cue a few times and managed to come back and compete – but who knows if I can do it this time?’ Higgins told the Scottish Sun.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘The process was basically to give me one last cue for the rest of my career. I don’t know how long that will be – two years, three years, who knows?</p>

      <p>‘I felt as if my old cue had lost a bit of life. I had too many little repair jobs done to it, so I decided to go for a new one.</p>
      <p>‘Now and again it is good to have a little change and I think it has given me a bit more power in my game. Once I get used to it, it will help the results I’m sure. I know I’m hitting the ball better.</p>
      <p>‘I’m really looking forward to the rest of the season. I’m quite positive about things.</p>
      <p>‘Normally I go out early at the UK Championship and then do okay at the Scottish [Open]. I’ve never really done great at York, so I would love to do well there.</p>
      <p>‘I’ve got to the semi-finals of the last two rankings events, so I can’t be too disappointed with my game.’</p>
      <p>Higgins has indeed been in decent form, making it to the last four at the World Open and Northern Ireland Open, losing to world champion Judd Trump on both occasions.</p>

      <p>While he might be in the latter stages of his career, the Wizard of Wishaw has reached the last three World Championship finals and still has plenty of ambition in the game for titles and records.</p>
      <p>The Scot is currently on 771 centuries in his career and can go ahead of Stephen Hendry who is second on the all-time list with 775, while another 147 break is also in his cross hairs.</p>
      <p>‘It would mean a lot to catch Stephen up with the centuries,’ said Higgins. He is one of the greatest break builders the world has ever seen. There is a chance it could happen in Scotland and that would be a special event to do it at.</p>
      <p>‘I would love to get another maximum to get to double figures in 147 breaks and I would love to win another big event, so those are really the main aims that I have.’</p>
      <p>Higgins takes on Peter Lines in the first round of the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/2019-uk-championship-snooker-draw-schedule-odds-tv-channel-prize-money-11182471/">UK Championship</a> in the evening session on Tuesday 26 November.</p>
      <p>The draw has also been made for the S<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/ronnie-osullivan-judd-trump-mark-allen-john-higgins-mark-selby-high-quality-scottish-open-draw-11181922/">cottish Open</a>, starting on 9 December, where Higgins will play Jamie O’Neill in round one.</p>
