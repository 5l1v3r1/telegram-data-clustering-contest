      <p>The Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN) has called for a two-day “prayer of warfare” against the conference on witchcraft being organised by the University of Nigeria, Nsukka (UNN).</p>
      <p>Godwin Madu, chairman of PFN in a statement on Sunday in Enugu, also demanded the cancellation of the conference which he described as “sponsoring evil”.</p>
      <p>Concise News <a href="https://www.concisenews.global/2019/11/21/what-can-said-about-witchcraft-conference-planned-to-hold-at-unn/">reported</a> that the event being organised by the B.I.C Ijomah Centre for Policy and Research in UNN, will take place between November 26 and November 27.</p>
      <p>However, Madu said it does not “give God glory,” urging Christians to pray against it.</p>
      <p>“We cannot fold our arms and watch our future dragged into what will not give God glory,” he said in the statement.</p>
      <p>“To this end, the Church in Enugu has declared a two-day prayer of warfare. We must not allow this at a time like this, as we have had enough of ungodly activities in the country already. The Church should pray against those sponsoring evil in the state.”</p>
      <p>He said Enugu state is “in the hands of God,” adding: “We will not hand it over to witches.”</p>
      <p>“So, all Christians should, without further delay, call on the God of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and the awesome God of David to fight for his name,” he said.</p>
