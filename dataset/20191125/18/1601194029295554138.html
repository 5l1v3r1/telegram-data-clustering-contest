      <p>West Indies cricketer <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/chris-gayle">Chris Gayle</a> has expressed his frustration at not receiving any respect from the fans and franchises after a few failures in the <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/mzansi-super-league">Mzansi Super League</a>. The 40-year-old Jamaican has bid goodbye to <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/team/jozi-stars">Jozi Stars</a> mid-season, on a bitter and disappointed note.</p>
      <p>The MSL defending champions have had a forgettable season, having gone winless in six games played thus far. Even the presence of quality players like Kagiso Rabada and Temba Bavuma hasn't helped, as the team have repeatedly floundered at the final hurdle.</p>

      <p>Gayle himself amassed 101 runs in six innings, and he <a href="https://www.news18.com/cricketnext/news/no-one-respects-what-ive-done-chris-gayle-after-another-t20-stint-2400157.html">vented his anger</a> in a press conference after the Stars failed to win a close encounter against Tshwane Spartans.</p>
      <blockquote>"As soon as I don't perform for two or three games, then Chris Gayle is the burden for the team," he said.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>"I am not talking for this team only. This is something I have analysed over the years playing franchise cricket. Chris Gayle is always a burden if I don't score runs, two, three, four times.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>"It seems like that one particular individual is the burden for the team. And then you will hear bickering. I am not going to get respect. People don't remember what you have done for them. I don't get respect.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>"Players, management, head of management, board members; Chris Gayle never get no respect. Once Chris Gayle fails, it's the end of his career, he is no good, he is the worst player and all these other things. I've generally overcome these things and I expect these things and I have lived with these things."</blockquote>
      <p>Gayle also went on to add that there are some deep-rooted problems in the Stars squad. He mentioned how there's been a lot of uncertainty among the players, and hinted that there could be some off-field issues at work.</p>
      <blockquote>"This is not how defending champions should play to defend the title. Most of the times it's been a lot of uncertainty from guys and I don't know if it's an off the field problem, I don't know what's happening. I think individuals, the franchise itself, needs to look at themselves and dig deep with what is happening. Something is wrong."</blockquote>

      <p>Gayle also revealed how the current atmosphere is in stark contrast to what it was last year, where everything had a positive air to it.</p>
      <blockquote>"I had so much fun last year. I didn't plan to come to play this year but because of the spirit last year, the dressing room environment was so fantastic, I just wanted to come and play," he said.</blockquote>
      <p>Known as 'The Universe Boss,' Gayle is the leading run-scorer in T20 cricket, and the only batsman to have scored more than 10,000 runs in the format. The big-hitting batsman has 21 T20 centuries to his name as well.</p>
