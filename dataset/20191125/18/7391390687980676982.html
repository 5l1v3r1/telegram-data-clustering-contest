      <p>After you've properly stuffed yourself silly on the Thursday of Thanksgiving, it's time to get out there the next day and officially start the holiday <a href="https://bestblackfriday.com/cyber-monday">shopping for Black Friday and Cyber Monday.</a> And now, the internet makes holiday shopping even easier. Because, seriously, who wants to fight those crowds on Friday?</p>
      <p>But while some may race to get the biggest and cheapest TV on Black Friday and do the same via the Internet on Cyber Monday, for others, their priorities may be elsewhere and that elsewhere could be sex toys. Because, honestly, the <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/9-things-that-happen-to-your-body-when-you-have-orgasm-that-you-never-realized-8487239">gift of orgasms</a>, whether for yourself, your partner, or all the other people in your life, is probably one of the best gifts that can be given. Sex toys will also never evoke that look of "what were you thinking?" when being unwrapped, unlike another pair of socks or a boring gift card.</p>
      <p>This year so many brands and online sex toy retailers are joining in on the Black Friday and Cyber Monday fun. From buy one get one, to as much as 50% off, there are a bunch deals for <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/its-national-sex-toy-day-here-are-my-13-favorite-toys-of-2019-19275902">all your sex toy needs</a>. Here are 29 brands and sites that want to make your holiday season, well, pretty damn orgasmic.</p>

      <p>According to Emily Sauer, <a href="https://ohnut.co/">Ohnut</a>'s CEO and founder, "75% of <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/9-sex-toys-that-can-help-with-painful-sex-17022068">women will have painful sex</a> in their lifetime," and sadly, many of those women don't speak up about it — that's why Ohnut was created. Whether used on a penis or dildo, Ohnut makes penetration enjoyable by limiting just how deep that penetration is.</p>
      <p>For those who need to put a limit on penetration and love a deal, from November 27 to December 2, Ohnut will be offering $10 off, free shipping in the US, and a free pin, while supplies last.</p>

But because we all deserve a deal, Lovehoney will be offering up to 40% off quite a selection of goodies. Discounted lingerie, sex toys, and lube makes for one hell of a great sexy weekend.</p>

      <p>When it comes to <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/10-brilliant-couples-sex-toys-that-pleasure-you-both-at-the-same-time-32287">couples sex toys</a>, especially those that can be used via an app making long distance relationships far more easier (and exciting) than they used to be, we can thank We-Vibe. Although their toys, like Sync, can be used when you and your partner are physically together, the fact that they can be used when you're apart, like a world apart, is truly a game changer.</p>
      <p>From November 28 to December 6, We-Vibe will be offering 20% off all products — no promo code necessary!</p>
      <h3>6. Le Wand</h3>

      </p>
      <p>First Alicia Sinclair, founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.cotrinc.com/">COTR,inc</a> gave us b-Vibe. Then, because she takes pleasure <i>that</i> seriously, she gave us Le Wand and all was right with the world.</p>
      <p>In honor of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, Le Wand is offering 35% off on Friday, November 29 and Saturday, November 30. Then 30% off on Sunday, December 1 and Monday, December 2, as well as a free holiday gift card set with each purchase. The latter being while supplies last, so don't stall.

      <p>Starting midnight on Black Friday, through the end of Cyber Monday, Dame is offering 20% off site-wide. You don't need a code to get the discount; it automatically applies at checkout.</p>

      </p>
      <p>When it came to new sex toy launches this year, Unbound killed it. Because who out there doesn't need a <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/unbounds-palma-ring-is-both-a-fashion-forward-accessory-a-secret-vibrator-17025764">ring that doubles as a vibrator</a> in their life?</p>

The big sale starts the Sunday before Thanksgiving, November 24 at 5 p.m. EST and ends Tuesday, December 3.

      <h3>12. Foria</h3>

        <img src="https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2019/11/13/ed0f720a-c9bd-4d50-84e4-7b9cbaabc4fb-screen-shot-2019-11-13-at-132410.png?w=450&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=faces&amp;auto=format&amp;q=70"/>

      </p>
      <p>Foria has really made a name for itself in the last few years when it comes to CBD products, especially with their Awaken CBD Arousal Oil. I can say, based on personal experience, it really does enhance sensation during intercourse and makes my vulva relax, washing away any tension.</p>
      <p>From 12 a.m. EST Friday, November 29 to 12 a.m. EST Saturday, November 30, Foria will be offering 30% off site-wide. So, if you've yet to <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/does-cbd-improve-your-sex-life-we-asked-experts-heres-what-they-said-13020539">incorporate CBD into your sex life</a>, or you life in general, this is a great chance to do so.</p>

      <p>Doc Johnson is home to a large collection of <i>everything, </i>no matter your kink or pleasure. Since that's the case, the fact that they're offering 30% off their entire site (excluding Foria products) from November 25 to Dec 2 is a big deal. So. Many. Options.</p>

      </p>
      <p>When Lovability first launched a few years ago, they had one thing in mind: to <a href="https://www.bustle.com/articles/59964-lovability-condoms-are-made-for-women-by-women-and-theyre-de-stigmatizing-carrying-contraceptives">destigmatize the carrying of condoms</a> — especially for women. Since then, the company has branched out from just making condoms to making kits and apparel too.</p>
      <p>So whether it's a bunch of condoms or their Bangover Kit, from November 29 to December 3, you can get 25% off everything at Lovability. Just make sure to use the code <b>POWERBABE</b> at check out.</p>
      <h3>15. Womanizer</h3>

      </p>
      <p>It should be noted that Womanizer very, <i>very</i> rarely has sales or discounts, because the brand, with its <a href="https://www.bustle.com/articles/192881-women-try-to-orgasm-in-3-minutes-and-sht-gets-real">Pleasure Air technology</a>, literally sells itself. But Womanizer has a lot to celebrate this year with the Liberty 5th Anniversary Edition (above) and their Premium is now being released in two new colors. For some of us, colors are everything when it comes to our sex toys.</p>
      <p>From November 28 to December 6, you can get 20% off <i>every </i>Womanizer product. I repeat: <i>every</i> Womanizer product. All you need is the code <b>BLACK20</b>.</p>
