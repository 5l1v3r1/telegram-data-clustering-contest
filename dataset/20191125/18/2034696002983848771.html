      <p>The rapper took to Twitter earlier today (November 25) to urge people to vote and said: “Unlike last time, I’m not gonna tell you who to vote for, or even who I’m voting for. But I will tell you that it’s very important to register to vote and have your say.” He then posted a link to register to vote.</p>
      <p>He immediately received comments claiming he was Tory with one follower writing: “aj tory” while another wrote: “AJ T and the T is for Tory”.</p>
      <p>This prompted the rapper to follow up his plea by addressing the comments.</p>

      <p>“I’m gonna shut this Tory nonsense down immediately. Yuck,” he wrote. “But just because I hate the Conservatives doesn’t mean I’m gonna tell people to vote for the party I want. Inform yourself on what the parties stand for and make your own decision. That’s the last I’ll say on this topic.”</p>

      <p>Tracey previously confirmed that he will not be voting for Labour in December.</p>
      <p>It came after <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/skepta">Skepta</a><a href="https://www.nme.com/politics/skepta-slams-current-state-politics-grime4corbyn-movement-2185457"> criticised the Grime4Corbyn campaign in December 2017</a>, and said that politicians “used people” during the election.</p>
      <p>Despite that the campaign is to relaunch <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/grime4corbyn-to-relaunch-in-new-campaign-to-support-labour-2571386">with a new collective of artists who are encouraging fans to back Labour in the election</a>.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/skepta">Skepta</a> and AJ Tracey recently released <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/skepta-aj-tracey-video-kiss-and-tell-collaboration-2563351">the video</a> for their anticipated collaboration ‘Kiss And Tell’.</p>
