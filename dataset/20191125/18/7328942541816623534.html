      <h1>Tesla's Elon Musk Blames Sledgehammer Blows For Shattered Cybertruck Window</h1>
      <h2>The Cybertruck window never would have shattered had the ball been thrown first.</h2>

      <p>Never one to let things go, Tesla head Elon Musk finally explained what happened with the shattered window during the Cybertruck unveiling last week. </p>
      <p>During a late-night event (at least for those in certain time zones) Tesla <a href="https://interestingengineering.com/teslas-stainless-steel-futuristic-cybertruck-has-arrived">unveiled</a> its much-awaited and seemingly forever teased all-electric pickup truck the Cybertruck.</p>

      <h3>The order not the tool is to blame </h3>
      <p>The stainless steel monster, which more than 200,000 people have put a $100 deposit on, can withstand pretty much everything that is thrown at it.  </p>
      <p>Everything but a steel ball. </p>
      <p>During the show, Musk boasted about the strength of the <a href="https://interestingengineering.com/7-ways-the-internet-commented-on-tesla-cybertruck">Cybertruck</a> having the team throw different items at it. The body of the all-electric truck withstood several blows from a sledgehammer, but when a steel ball was lodged at it, the so-called "armor glass" of the window shattered. An embarrassing display. One Musk eventually took to Twitter to explain. </p>
      <p>Responding to a user who blamed the sledgehammer for the window debacle, Musk wrote:  "Sledgehammer impact on door cracked base of glass, which is why steel ball didn't bounce off."</p>

      <h3>It didn't shatter in practice </h3>
      <p>Musk also wanted the world to know the glass could withstand a steel ball being thrown at it, posting a video of designer Franz von Holzhuasen practicing the steel ball throw but that time the glass didn't break. </p>

      <p>Despite the mishap, Tesla fans appear to have fallen in love with the Cybertruck. Over the weekend Tesla brought in around 200,000, with people putting down $100 to get their hands on the electric truck sometime next year. </p>
