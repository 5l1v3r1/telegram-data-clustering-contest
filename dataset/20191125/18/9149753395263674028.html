      <h1>SkyTech's gaming PC with an RTX 2070 Super is discounted to $1,000 right now</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T18:09:37+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 18:09</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/author/corbin-davenport/" target="_blank">Corbin Davenport</a></address>
      <p>One of the best deals in recent history on gaming PCs was the SkyTech Blaze II desktop with an RTX 2070 Super graphics card <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/this-gaming-pc-with-an-rtx-2070-super-is-on-sale-for-dollar1000-right-now/">for just $1,000</a>. For those of you who missed out on it the first time, the sale has returned, and the PC is still cheaper than <a href="https://www.newegg.com/p/pl?N=100897449%20601342245%204814&amp;Order=PRICE">every other gaming PC with the same graphics card</a> (at least on Newegg).</p>
      <p>The full list of hardware in this PC includes an AMD Ryzen 5 3600 6-core/12-thread CPU, an Nvidia GeForce RTX 2070 Super graphics card with 8GB of GDDR6 memory, an AMD B450 motherboard, 16GB of 3000MHz DDR4 RAM, a 500GB SSD, a 550W 80+ Bronze power supply, and 802.11ac Wi-Fi. Windows 10 Home 64-bit is pre-installed.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.newegg.com/p/pl?N=100897449&amp;LeftPriceRange=900%201100&amp;Order=BESTMATCH">Most PCs around the $1,000 mark</a> use a GTX 1660 graphics card, making this desktop with a more-powerful RTX 2070 Super an excellent deal. For comparison, the next-cheapest PC on Newegg right now with an RTX 2070 Super <a href="https://www.newegg.com/abs-computer-technologies-rogue-h-ali349/p/N82E16883102848?Item=N82E16883102848">costs $1,290</a>. The SkyTech PC also has an average of 5 stars on Newegg, though there are only five customer reviews at the moment.</p>
