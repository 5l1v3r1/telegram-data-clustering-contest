        <b>This Is Us star Justin Hartley stepped out for lunch with his daughter without his wedding ring after filing for divorce from wife of two years Chrishell Stause.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The actor made his first public appearance since filing for divorce to hang out with his daughter Isabella whom he shares with first wife and Passions actress Lindsay Korman.</p>
      <p>Justin was dressed in an all-black ensemble but gave his outfit a little colour with white trainers.</p>
      <p>Isabella, 15, kept to the theme of black with a leather jacket and black jeans but we’re shook at how fast she’s growing up.</p>
      <p>His daughter is the spitting image of her mother and All My Children’s star Lindsay.</p>
      <p>Justin filed the paperwork to divorce his wife Chrishell on 22 November.</p>
      <p>The 42-year-old stated the reason for divorce was ‘irreconcilable differences’ and ‘dissolution without minor children’, according to Us Weekly.</p>

      <p>Although Justin has listed their split as 8 July, the two have been seen together on a number of occasions, and more recently at a pre-Golden Globes party just last week.</p>

      <p>The actor also took the time out to wish his now ex-wife well on her birthday at the end of July.</p>
      <p>‘Let’s all wish this young gem of a human a very happy birthday!’ he wrote on Instagram. ‘To many more years of love and laughs!!! HAPPY BIRTHDAY @chrishellhartley!!!!!!!!’</p>
      <p>Justin and Chrishell had begun dating in January 2014, with Justin proposing to his future wife in July 2016, before the two wed the following year in October 2017.</p>
      <p>‘People close to Justin and Chrishell are completely shocked by Justin filing for divorce. The couple has always been incredible with no signs of things being on the rocks,’ a source told <a href="https://www.etonline.com/justin-hartley-files-for-divorce-from-wife-chrishell-stause-after-2-years-of-marriage-136929">ET</a>.</p>
      <p>‘Friends are speculating this was an impulse on Justin’s side due to something that happened, and are hopeful the couple can work things out.’</p>
