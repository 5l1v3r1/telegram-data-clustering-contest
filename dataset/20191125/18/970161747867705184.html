      <p>Emily Eavis has dropped major hints about who the remaining <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/glastonbury/">Glastonbury</a> Festival headliners will be, and we can’t deal.</p>
      <p>The festival organiser has teased it’ll be the pair’s ‘first time’ at Glasto, which actually narrows things down quite a lot.</p>
      <p>Virtually every big name in music has played at one time or another.</p>
      <p>‘Interestingly, for the other two headliners [in addition to Paul McCartney] it’s their first time at Glastonbury,’ Eavis recently told <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2">BBC Radio 2</a>.</p>
      <p>‘And we’ve got one male and one female,’ she went on. ‘So there are a couple of clues there.’</p>
      <p>‘I’m sure people will guess,’ she then added. ‘So don’t put them to me!’</p>

      <p>The bookies favourites to join Beatles icon Paul McCartney as the second and third headliners are Taylor Swift and Kendrick Lamar, according to reports.</p>

      <p>We at least know Taylor will be in Europe around the time of the music extravaganza in Somerset.</p>
      <p>Glastonbury 2020 takes place from Wednesday 24 to Sunday 28 June.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Taylor will be in Berlin, Germany on 24 June and Oslo, Norway on 26 June for her hotly-anticipated Lover Fest tour.</p>
      <p>Some 14 shows have been scheduled so far across Europe, the US and Brazil.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile Kendrick hasn’t hit the road for a world tour since last year, with the Damn Tour culminating in July last year.</p>
      <p>In her interview, Eavis also expressed her excitement about Sir Paul’s appearance for the 50th anniversary of the music extravaganza – his first since 2004.</p>
      <p>‘It’s amazing having him back,’ she said. ‘It’s the ultimate way to celebrate.’</p>
      <p>We literally can’t wait.</p>
