      <h1>When It’s Over, That’s the Time You Hire Mark McGrath</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T18:25:45+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 18:25</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.spin.com/author/maggie-serota/" target="_blank">Maggie Serota</a></address>
      <p>If you’ve got <a href="https://www.cameo.com/markmcgrath">an extra $100 burning a hole in your pocket</a>, you can hire <a href="https://www.spin.com/tag/sugar-ray/">Sugar Ray </a>frontman <a href="https://www.spin.com/tag/mark-mcgrath/">Mark McGrath</a> to record a video for a loved one via <a href="https://www.cameo.com/markmcgrath">Cameo</a>. We’re not sure if it costs extra to have the relentlessly upbeat rock star break up with your significant other by proxy, but that’s what’s happening in this video circulating on Twitter.</p>
      <p>In the video clip in question, McGrath is tasked with letting someone named Bradyn know that someone named Cheyenne isn’t emotionally invested in their relationship anymore and just wants to be friends. Ouch. Being the absurdly positive guy that he is, McGrath is determined to take some of the sting out of his second hand dumping by reminding Bradyn of his bright future. After all, Bradyn is working on a thesis. Who needs companionship and affection from another living person when you have homework!</p>
      <p>According to his Cameo page, McGrath kicks each message off with the same spirited greeting: “Mark McGrath from the band Sugar Ray, off the charts but always in your hearts.” Given the energy and intensity of McGrath’s intro, you’d think that something like a birthday greeting or graduation well wishes would follow. Not for Bradyn!</p>

      <p>“You’re a fan of the band Sugar Ray, which I am honored. I wish I was delivering you good news! Hopefully I can see you backstage, give you a high five someday, dude!” McGrath said with chipper game show host demeanor. “We can maybe laugh about this sometimes. Hopefully we all can! Cheyenne, Bradyn, all of us, we all could hang out! But, uh, she wants to be friends right now, bro.”</p>
      <p>SPIN reached out to McGrath for comment on the video and we’ll update if we hear back. Although <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/sugar-rays-mark-mcgrath-breakup-cameo-918432/">Cameo did confirm to <i>Rolling Stone</i></a> that McGrath did record the video on its platform, this quote tweet by McGrath claiming that he’s “also doing real ones for the holidays” makes us wonder if he was just doing a bit.</p>

      <p><b>UPDATE 7:11 PM EST:</b> When asked if McGrath was sincerely delivering a breakup message, a rep for Cameo sent the following statement:</p>
      <blockquote>Cameo talent receive sincere requests like these more than you would think. Last year Simon Rex, Bam Margera and Matt Iseman received Cameo requests to break up with their significant other and quit their job for them. While a majority of Cameo requests are used to wish people happy birthday or congratulate a life event, there have been several unique use cases like these as well.</blockquote>
      <p>The rep also noted that the request was filled on November 13. Hey Bradyn, at least Cheyenne didn’t send Bam Margera to dump you.</p>
