      <p>BRASILIA (Reuters) - The U.S. government will launch a “global entry” program for Brazilians traveling to the United States to allow expedited clearance for pre-approved, low-risk travelers upon arrival, the Brazilian government said on Monday.</p>
      <p>Brazilian business people who travel frequently to the United States have been waiting since 2012 - when the two sides were close to brokering a deal on it - for implementation of the trusted traveler Global Entry Program (GEP) to make their entry easier at U.S. airports.</p>
      <p>The office of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro’s chief of staff said a global entry pilot program will start soon, with some 20 Brazilian executives initially to test the system’s functionality.</p>
      <p>Global Entry is administered by U.S. Customs and Border Protection and allows visitors to stop at a kiosk on arrival in the United States to have their fingerprints scanned and fill out a customs declaration form to enter the country.</p>
      <p>Currently trusted travelers from Argentina, India, Colombia, Britain, Germany, Panama, Singapore, South Korea, Switzerland, Taiwan, and Mexico are eligible for the rapid entry program.</p>
      <p>U.S. President Donald Trump announced his administration would take steps to enable Brazil to participate in the Global Entry Program when Bolsonaro visited the White House in March.</p>
      <p>The U.S. Travel Association said Brazil’s inclusion in the Global Entry Program was a good deal for both nations and would increase the number of Brazilians flying to the United States for shopping and vacation.</p>
      <p>Since 2017, close to 2 million Brazilians have traveled to the United States annually, spending more than $7 billion per year, the association noted.</p>
      <p>This year, Brazil eliminated the requirement of tourist visas for visitors from the United States, Canada, Australia and Japan, but Brazilians still need visas to enter the United States.</p>
