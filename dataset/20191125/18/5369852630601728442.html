      <p>BALLYBODEN’S PROGRESSION TO the Leinster club SFC final was tinged with sadness as star man Michael Darragh Macauley reflected on a difficult 10 days for the club.</p>
      <p>The Dublin champions saw off Garrycastle by 11 points in TEG Cusack Park on Sunday afternoon, but following the final whistle, Macauley’s thoughts immediately turned to his former team-mate Dermot ‘Digger’ Manley who passed away recently. </p>
      <p>“What was on my mind more than anything today was the loss of Dermot Manley,” the Dublin midfielder <a href="https://www.rte.ie/sport/gaa/2019/1124/1094880-one-of-the-best-humans-macauley-salutes-late-friend/">told RTE Radio 1.</a></p>
      <p>“We lost ‘Digger’ last week and nothing is going to be the same again. We’re looking at everything differently.</p>
      <p>“You just don’t know, in life and in sport, what’s going to happen next.</p>
      <p>“Dermot was an unbelievable human. He played with this team, was on championship-winning teams with this club.</p>
      <p>“He was one of the best humans I ever met and if we had a few more like him, the world would be a better place.”</p>

      <p>The last time the south side club progressed from Dublin they went on to lift provincial and All-Ireland titles. Macauley believes the current squad are as strong as the all-conquering outfit of 2015/16. </p>
      <p>“Ballyboden will probably always put out a strong 15 and has done so for the last 10 years,” he said.</p>
      <p>“What we haven’t had is a strong 20 or 25 to push lads in training. This is the probably the strongest we’ve had it, even since 2015-16. There’s a serious group of lads there.”</p>

      <p>Excitement levels will ramp up ahead of Sunday week’s Leinster final against Carlow champions Éire Óg.</p>
      <p>“Momentum builds, people get behind it, flags start going up in Rathfarnham, Knocklyon and people in the shops start talking about it.</p>
      <p>“It gets that lovely buzz about the place,” Macauley added.</p>
