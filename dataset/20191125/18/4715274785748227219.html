      <p>Bambang, Nueva Vizcaya—She studied music and came back to save, improve and preserve songs of the Isinay tribe which she belonged.</p>
      <p>For Emely Jane Gonzalez Namit-Mahipus, an Isinay of barangay Banggot and now a music professor of Sta. Isabel College in Metro Manila, gathering the manuscripts and compilations of Isinay songs is worth the effort and initiative.</p>
      <p>After all, it is a cultural treasure that needs to be preserved.</p>
      <p>The book containing a compilation of Isinay tribe songs was already launched at the Nueva Vizcaya State University in this town.</p>
      <p>The launching was attended by Isinay tribe elders and leaders of Bambang headed by former board member Jose Tubayan and former Schools Division Superintendent Albert Bangunan and his wife Reynalda Bangunan.</p>
      <p>The book dubbed “TAWID: Isinay Songs of Isabela Leal Gonzalez“ was published by the National Commission on Culture and the Arts.</p>
      <p>The songs are usually performed by the Isinay tribe during wakes, weddings, fiestas and other cultural events and activities.</p>
      <p>The songs which express courtship, love, joy merriment and grief are titled Ar Sipan Uar, Dattut Ituam, Nganngawon Tau, O Rosita, Sabong Panggayjayan and Tayana Di Longkosar.</p>
      <p>“TAWID, an Iluko term which means legacy or inheritance had a long journey which started in 2011 and was realized in 2015. It led me to gather the compositions of Isabelo Leal Gonzalez, an Isinay neo-romantic composer,” she said.</p>
      <p>Namit-Mahipus also attributed the realization of the book on the challenge, inspiration and assistance from Professor Mauricia Borromeo, past dean of UP College of Music and her past professor.</p>
      <p>“My mother Virginia could only recall a folk song, a lullaby which she learned from an uncle,” she added.</p>
      <p>The crude manuscript of the Isinay songs were later on transcribed and transposed to lower keys which was then submitted to the NCCA on July 30 last year.</p>
      <p>Namit-Mahipus was then granted the call for research proposal in music and recommendation for publication this year.</p>
      <p>With the book containing the cultural songs, she cited cited the following purposes why the book was made and published : they are considered as pioneering work which will now be sang melodically and rhythmically correct with the production of musical scores, change the path of studies and researches and reveal that the Isinay dialect is not vanishing and endangered and preserve the legacy of Bambang community through their Isinay songs.</p>
      <p>“To disregard Isinay songs, or keep as personal property would be killing a legacy,” Namit-Mahipus said.</p>
      <p>The TAWID Isinay songs of Isabelo Leal Gonzalez seeks to preserve not only for the next generation to learn and enjoy but as testaments of the rich cultural heritage of Philippine Music, she added.</p>
