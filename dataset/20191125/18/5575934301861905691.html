      <p>Tiffany &amp; Co. CEO Alessandro Bogliolo <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/dont-call-tiffany-luxury-brand-ceo-alessandro-bogliolo-2019-11">spoke about the future of the iconic jewellery retailer</a> at Bloomberg’s annual <a href="https://www.bloomberglive.com/year-ahead-luxury-2019/">The Year Ahead: Luxury</a> summit in New York City on Thursday, just days before LVMH, the largest luxury goods company in the world, agreed to buy Tiffany for a record-breaking $US16.2 billion.</p>
      <p>At the summit, Bogliolo declined to speak in detail about the then-pending acquisition, but he did offer a few insights into how he thinks the deal might impact consumer interests – which is to say, virtually not at all.</p>
      <p>“Customers, they don’t care about your shareholders,” the Tiffany CEO said, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-21/tiffany-ceo-says-customers-don-t-care-who-owns-the-brand?srnd=pursuits-vp">Bloomberg</a>. “Customers care about your product – about your brand, about sustainability, about the beauty of your products. This is what really makes success.”</p>
      <p>Bogliolo also spoke about the changing habits of American consumers – specifically millennials who, he says, “regard brands differently than previous generations did at their age.”</p>
      <p>“When I was young, it was important to buy a famous brand and a beautiful product,” he continued. “Millennials have much more questions. They want to know why Tiffany is famous, what do they stand for, and why should I go to them.”</p>
      <p>Garrett Leight, CEO and founder of luxury eyewear brand Garrett Leight California Optical (GLCO), shared similar sentiments in <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/luxury-eyewear-designer-garrett-leight-glco-on-barneys-closing-2019-11">an interview with Business Insider</a>, suggesting that one of the reasons behind <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/barneys-liquidation-sale-discounts-shopper-complaints-2019-11">Barneys New York’s shutdown</a> was the luxe department store’s failure to establish an “identity” with younger consumers.</p>
      <p>“I’m not really sure who the voice was or what the voice was [of Barneys]. I don’t really know what they stand for. Even in leaving, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4VTDWzDIM3/">they just made an Instagram post</a>, and it just had a hashtag on it,” Leight said. “Today, millennials and Gen-Z – we want to connect with something. We want to know who we’re supporting, and I just don’t know what [Barneys’] identity was.”</p>
      <h3>LVMH agrees to buy Tiffany in a record-breaking deal</h3>
      <p>In October, news broke that LVMH had <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/lvmh-offers-to-buy-tiffany-2010-10">offered to buy the jewellery retailer</a> for $US14.5 billion; Tiffany declined that initial bid. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tiffany-m-a-lvmh-exclusive-idUSKBN1XU2PV">LVMH then raised their offer</a>, Reuters reported on Wednesday. On Sunday, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c7a7b230-0ec2-11ea-a7e6-62bf4f9e548a">the Financial Times reported</a> that the deal between the two companies was imminent and expected to close for $US16.7 billion. The deal officially closed on Monday, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/lvmh-finalizes-deal-to-buy-tiffany-for-162-billion-2019-11">with LVMH agreeing to purchase Tiffany and Co. for $US16.2 billion</a> – the luxury giant’s most expensive acquisition to date.</p>
      <p>It’s also set to be the priciest deal in the history of the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/kering-ceo-francois-henri-pinault-talks-gender-equality-womens-forum-2019-11">luxury</a> sector, Amie Tsang and Vanessa Friedman of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/25/business/lvmh-tiffany-deal.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;amp;pgtype=Homepage">the New York Times report.</a></p>
      <p>“This transaction, which occurs at a time of internal transformation for our legendary brand, will provide further support, resources and momentum for those priorities as we evolve towards becoming The Next Generation Luxury Jeweller,” <a href="http://press.tiffany.com/News/NewsItem.aspx?id=372">Bogliolo said in a press statement announcing the deal</a>.</p>
      <p>The LVMH deal still needs to be approved by Tiffany’s existing shareholders, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/25/business/lvmh-tiffany-deal.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;amp;pgtype=Homepage">according to the New York Times</a>, and is set to close in the middle of next year.</p>
      <p>This isn’t the only restructuring happening behind the scenes at Tiffany. Last week, <a href="https://pagesix.com/2019/11/20/former-barneys-ceo-headed-to-tiffany-co/">Page Six also reported that</a> Daniella Vitale, the former CEO of bankrupt Barneys, is set to become the company’s executive vice president and chief brand officer.</p>
