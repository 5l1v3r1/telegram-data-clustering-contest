      <h1>No Red Alert Siren, But Rocket Fired By Gaza Terrorists</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T18:44:59+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 18:44</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.jewishpress.com/author/hlj/" target="_blank">Hana Levi Julian</a></address>
      <p>Although no Red Alert incoming rocket alert siren was triggered, Gaza terrorists fired a rocket at southern Israel shortly before 6:30 pm Monday evening, according to a report by Israel’s <i>Channel 12</i> news.</p>
      <p>The rocket reportedly landed in an open area in southern Israel. There’s been no report of property damage or injuries.</p>
      <p>The Red Alert incoming rocket alert siren may not have activated because the projectile’s trajectory was not headed towards a populated area.</p>
