      <p>Diminutive Kumawood actor Joseph Pamfo, popularly known as Joe Shortingo has revealed that his height has helped him secure a lot of big roles in the movie industry and also attracted more ladies to himself.</p>
      <p>“My size has helped me a lot in the movie industry. I always get movie roles without struggling because most movie producers see me as a funny character so they easily give me roles.” Joe Shortingo said while cooking on Mcbrown’s Kitchen cooking show.</p>

      <p>Joe Shortingo further revealed he has been bullied several times because of his height. He recounted how a soldier who mistook him for a naughty boy gave him a hefty knock on the head.</p>
      <p>” My height has not been favourable to me in some ways. During one of our shoots, we encountered a soldier man who was running after some naughty boys… upon seeing me he thought I was one of the boys and before I could explain myself he gave me a heavy knock on the head which almost rendered me blind….The timely intervention of the producer saved my life.” Joe recounted.</p>
      <p>Speaking on women and marriage, Joe Shortingo who disclosed his age to be 33 years stated that, before he become popular, women were running away from him because of his height but with his current status, he finds it easy proposing to women and they easily accept it.</p>
      <p>He however plans on getting married to the right woman at the right time.</p>
