      <p>A week after their olive green, military-style uniforms created a controversy, Rajya Sabha marshals on Monday were back in their traditional Indian attire but without the long turban.</p>
      <p>The two marshals, who flank the Chair, came to the House wearing Indian <i>bandhgalas</i>.</p>
      <p>The new uniforms of the marshals, complete with peak caps and lanyards, had come under criticism from Opposition parties and Army veterans. Officials said Mondayâ€™s change was made as demanded by the marshals themselves.</p>
