      <h1>European police launch a cyber attack on Islamic State</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T18:45:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 18:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/afp" target="_blank">AFP</a></address>
      <p>Police have carried out a cyberattack on a global scale against online propaganda outlets of the Islamic State extremist group, Belgian prosecutors said Monday.</p>
      <p>The operation began as part of a Belgian judicial probe of Amaq, the media agency of the banned jihadist group, and involved international officers from Europol.</p>
      <p>Federal prosecution spokesman Eric van der Sypt confirmed the operation to AFP but he could not give a detailed breakdown of sites and accounts targeted.</p>
      <p>"We've knocked them down for the moment," he said. "But we're not naive. The first cyberattack in 2018 didn't stop them from bouncing back."</p>
      <p>Officers plan to reveal more about the operation at a news conference later in the day at Europol's HQ in the neighbouring Netherlands, he said.</p>
      <p>Belgian agents were involved in a wave of cyberattacks against Amaq last year, but the spokesman admitted they had been surprised by how quick the sources returned.</p>
      <p>In March 2016 the Belgian capital Brussels was hit in a double suicide attack claimed by the Islamic State that left 32 people dead.Â </p>
