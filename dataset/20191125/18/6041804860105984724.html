      <p>TSRTC JAC had finally decided to end the 52-day old strike. The JAC has requested all employees to report to work from tomorrow. The 52-day strike ended up with the Government not agreeing to a single demand of the workers. Interestingly, they have called it a moral victory of the employees.</p>
      <p>They further said that the government should not see this as a defeat of the employees nor a victory of the government. This decision of the RTC workers may create new problems since the Government is unlikely to allow the workers to report to work as the Chief Minister is yet to take a decision.</p>
      <p>Over 48,600 Workers who participated in the strike, have unconditionally decided to call off their strike. Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao had previously said that employees were ‘self-dismissed’ because they did not adhere to his deadline to return to work.</p>
      <p>They are hoping that the Government will take them back to work and also drop the idea of Privatization.</p>
