      <p>Nov. 25 (UPI) -- T.I. says his remarks about his daughter Deyjah Harris' virginity were "misconstrued."</p>
      <p>The 39-year-old rapper and television personality appeared with his wife, Tameka "Tiny" Harris, on Monday's<a href="https://www.facebook.com/redtabletalk/videos/1803664559768440/"> episode</a> of <i>Red Table Talk</i>, where they addressed T.I.'s comments about his daughter Deyjah Harris' virginity.</p>
      <p>T.I. faced heavy backlash this month after saying on the <i>Ladies Like Us</i> <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/life-hacks-with-t-i/id1468347586?i=1000455974705">podcast</a> that he takes Deyjah to the gynecologist to "check her hymen." He told <i>Red Table Talk </i>host <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Jada_Pinkett_Smith/?tps=1">Jada Pinkett Smith</a> that his comments were misconstrued.</p>
      <p>"Firstly, I came to clear up any misconceptions that have been surrounding how we interact and parent, and what is appropriate and inappropriate," T.I. said. "I think all this surrounds a conversation I was having in a very joking manner, when asked do how I deal with parenting in this day and age."</p>
      <p>"From a place of truth, I began to embellish and exaggerate," he added of his remarks. "I think that a lot of people took it extremely literal."</p>
      <p>T.I. and Harris said they both accompanied Deyjah to the gynecologist on two occasions, when Deyjah was 15 and 16 years old. Deyjah is now 18.</p>
      <p>"My intentions, I think have been terribly misconstrued and misconceived," T.I. said. "Let me set this record straight -- I never said I was in any exam room, that is an assumption. That is a falsity. I never said that it was being done present day, as an 18-year-old. I never said that her mother wasn't present."</p>
      <p>"This false narrative has just been sensationalized," he added.</p>
      <p>T.I. said he's sorry for embarrassing Deyjah with his remarks.</p>
      <p>"I am incredibly apologetic to her for that," he said. "Not to any of these other strangers, or any of these weirdos, who just kind of toss lies around."</p>
      <p><i>Ladies Like Us </i>hosts Nazanin Mandi and Nadia Moham apologized for their reactions to T.I.'s comments in an Instagram <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4kcro1lFv7/">post</a> last week.</p>
      <p>"To everyone confused, angry and hurt by the recent episode of <i>Ladies Like Us</i>, we want to start off by saying that we sincerely apologize for our knee jerk reaction to the uncomfortable topic. We were completely caught off guard/shocked and looking back, we should have reacted much differently in the moment," the pair wrote.</p>
      <p>"We support and love Women and feel that their bodies are theirs to do as they wish," they added.</p>
      <p>T.I. is parent to Deyjah with singer Ms. Niko. He also has three children with Harris and two sons with Lashon Dixon.</p>
