      <h3>Best Overall — Fitbit Versa 2</h3>

      <h4>Fitbit Versa Features</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Heart rate monitor</li>
        <li>Altimeter</li>
        <li>5-day battery life</li>
        <li>Sleep tracking</li>
        <li>Music player</li>
        <li>Amazon Alexa built-in</li>
        <li>Water resistance to 50 meters</li>
        <li>AMOLED screen</li>
        <li>Fitbit Pay</li>
        <li>Replaceable band</li>
        <li>Compatibility with Android, iOS, and Windows</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Once again, swapping out the Versa 2 band isn't as easy as some other Fitbit models we've seen. Trying to attach a new band is a bit of a challenge. Not only is the pin finicky, but it's also tricky to get it precisely in the hole. It's next to impossible if you don't have long fingernails.</p>
      <p>Aside from the band-swapping issue, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07TWFVDWT/?tag=androidcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU71485YYw">Versa 2</a> is the perfect blend of fitness tracker and smartwatch. You can check texts, calls, and notifications while eyeing the heart rate monitor as you jog down the sidewalk. Fitbit Pay is now standard, which means you no longer have to pay more to get a model with this feature.</p>
      <p>There's not much you can't do with the Fitbit Versa 2. You'll be able to track the basics, including steps, distance, calories, and floors climbed. Some other perks include menstrual cycle tracking, sleep tracking, guided breathing sessions, on-screen workouts, and 24/7 heart rate monitoring. It also provides you with 15 exercise modes to choose from, like biking, running, swimming, and even yoga.</p>
      <h4>Pros:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Compact and lightweight</li>
        <li>Highly customizable</li>
        <li>Affordable price tag</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Cons:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>No onboard GPS</li>
        <li>Difficult to swap bands</li>
        <li>Bulky charging cable</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Best Overall</h4>

      </h4>
      <p>A well-rounded smartwatch</p>
      <p>The Versa 2 boasts a slim design, AMOLED display, improved battery life, and tons of fitness features at an affordable price.</p>

      <h3>Best Value Tracker — Fitbit Charge 3</h3>

      <h4>Fitbit Charge 3 features</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Heart rate monitor</li>
        <li>Altimeter</li>
        <li>Up to 7-day battery life</li>
        <li>Sleep tracking</li>
        <li>Water resistance to 50 meters</li>
        <li>Grayscale screen</li>
        <li>Replaceable band</li>
        <li>Compatibility with Android, iOS, and Windows</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Straight out of the box, the first thing you'll notice about the Charge 3 is the band. It comes with a watch-style buckle, which is a nice upgrade from the simpler snap clasps on other Fitbit models.</p>
      <p>The Charge 3's touchscreen is pretty responsive; you'll need to swipe up or down to check various stats. There are also two buttons on either side of the screen you can press. It's a little awkward pressing these to access the apps and settings, but it's not something we couldn't get over.</p>
      <p>The band on the Charge 3 is replaceable and secures with a buckle, which is a nice upgrade from the Flex 2's snap-style band. So if your dog decides the band is the next best thing to chew on, you're not stuck sporting a fitness tracker decorated with your pup's dental impressions.</p>
      <p>One gap in Charge 3's features is a lack of GPS. Of course, you can bring your phone along to track your trail running routes, but that's an extra thing to carry and isn't ideal. Still, the features the Charge 3 does have are impressive—a heart rate monitor, step, distance, and calorie tracking, plus Fitbit's sleep tracking technology. All that said, it does offer a more stylish design and a larger screen than the similarly priced Garmin Vivosmart 4.</p>
      <h4>Pros:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Crisp, responsive screen</li>
        <li>Thin, comfortable design</li>
        <li>Improved notifications</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Cons:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>No onboard GPS</li>
        <li>Finicky side buttons</li>
        <li>No music controls</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Best Value Tracker</h4>

      </h4>
      <p>An all-around great wearable on a budget</p>

      </ul>
      <p>When you want to be able to cover your bases with your fitness tracker without breaking the bank in the process, you'll love the Xiaomi Mi Band 4. A definite improvement from the Mi Band 3, this new version sports a clear color screen that's easy to read and navigate. More importantly, it offers a satisfying list of tracking abilities and other features that are hard to find at this price point.</p>
      <p>You'll be able to choose from up to six workout modes, which include running, treadmill running, cycling, walking, pool swimming, and a general "exercise" workout mode. The swim tracking is on point, with the ability to recognize swim styles such as freestyle, butterfly, and backstroke. It also records other data sets, like swimming pace and stroke count.</p>
      <p>Other than that, you'll have an extended 20-day battery life, sleep tracking, and all-day heart rate monitoring. It might not be a smartwatch, but at this price point, it's difficult to complain about this powerful little tracker.</p>
      <h4>Pros:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Budget-friendly tracker</li>
        <li>20 days of battery life</li>

      <p>The Garmin Vivosmart 4 does everything you would expect it to as a fitness tracker. It keeps track of your steps, sleep, calories burned, floors climbed, various exercises, and heart rate. However, where this tracker shines is its health-tracking features.</p>
      <p>For starters, you'll have advanced sleep tracking with REM sleep. It can also gauge blood oxygen saturation levels during the night with its wrist-based Pulse Ox sensor. A relaxation breathing timer complements the all-day stress tracking feature. Lastly, the "Body Battery" monitor helps optimize your daily activities based on your energy levels.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>The Fitbit Inspire HR is so compact and lightweight, you're likely to forget you're wearing it. This tracker also offers a more traditional buckle band as opposed to the peg-and-loop style. The bands are stylish and easy to switch when you feel like changing it up.</p>
      <p>You'll need to swipe up to see additional stats and use the single button on the device to return to the home screen. Swipe down when you're ready to start exercising. With all that said, there are some restrictions to having such a small screen. You'll need to go to the app to set alarms and bring your phone with you to utilize GPS.</p>

        <li>Wearable while swimming</li>

        <li>Compatibility with Android and iOS</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Want to keep things casual and affordable when it comes to your fitness tracking habits? That's exactly what the Fitbit Inspire was made for. This casual tracker successfully monitors your daily activity, like steps, distance, active minutes, and calories burned. It's also able to automatically recognize and record specific workouts, including walks, runs, swims, and bike rides.</p>
      <p>You'll have to sacrifice connected GPS, the heart rate monitor, and having more detailed sleep data if you choose this monitor. But if you aren't too concerned with diving that deep into the details, those may not be deal-breakers. The Inspire was designed for those who are only interested in the basics without the extra bells and whistles.</p>
      <h4>Pros:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Automatic exercise recognition</li>
        <li>Reminders to move</li>
        <li>Compact, comfortable design</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Cons:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>No heart rate monitoring</li>
        <li>Less detailed sleep data</li>
        <li>No GPS</li>

      <h3>Bottom line</h3>
      <p>When it comes right down to it, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07TWFVDWT?tag=androidcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU71485YYw">Fitbit Versa 2</a> takes the top spot on our list for a variety of reasons. For starters, the number of features you get for the price is simply unmatched. You'll have battery life for days, on-screen workouts with Fitbit Coach, heart-rate monitoring, convenient music storage, Fitbit Pay, sleep tracking, and much more.</p>
      <p>While there might be some drawbacks to the lack of onboard GPS and experiencing difficulties when swapping out the band, these concerns don't hold a candle to the slew of features it offers at such an affordable price. You can track every step taken, floor climbed, and lap swam. And you can do all this while you listen to music, check notifications, and monitor your heart rate.</p>
      <h3>How to find the best Black Friday deals on a fitness tracker</h3>
      <p>The most important thing to keep in mind when buying a fitness tracker is that cheap isn't always better: it's always easy to find a cheap fitness tracker on Amazon throughout the year. But when you're buying a fitness tracker, you want something that's reliable, has long battery life, and most importantly, treats your private health data with respect. All of these companies do that.</p>
      <p>Fitbit is the main contender here, with many options on this list. We love the Versa 2 for its, well, versatility, but the Inspire HR is also a great option if you want something a bit cheaper and more easily hidden on a wrist. Fitbits also don't go on sale very often, so it's worth waiting until Black Friday to buy one at a massive discount. Of course, more expensive products like Garmin's Forerunner 245 are for more dedicated athletes so it's really special when they go on sale. You should look out for deals on Garmin products over the next few weeks.</p>
      <p>Whatever fitness tracker you end up buying, though, this list should give you a decent understanding of what to look out for.</p>
      <h4>How to pick the best fitness tracker</h4>
      <p>If you're looking for the best fitness tracker for your needs, you may find yourself stuck in one of those infamous internet black holes. How do you know which activity tracker has the features you want at a price you can afford—and won't feel like you've strapped a brick to your wrist?</p>
      <p>If you're starting your search, here are a few tips to help you decide which fitness tracker is best for you.</p>
      <p>
        <b>1. Start with price</b>
      </p>
      <p>Depending on which features you want, your new fitness tracker could be surprisingly affordable, or it could end up setting you back quite a bit. (Yeah, we eyed a smartwatch that was nearing the quadruple digits for a good 30 seconds before our conscience brought us back to reality.)</p>
      <p>Of course, you should still be cautious about buying anything that's dirt cheap. Most cheap fitness trackers are just that: cheap. Even less costly models by well-known brands like Fitbit won't come with a full display, so you'll need to swap to the app to get all the details on your latest workout.</p>
      <p>
        <b>2. Decide on features</b>
      </p>
      <p>Narrow down your search by deciding which features you need. If your primary goal is to track your steps as you stroll around the neighborhood, you probably won't need a heart rate monitor or GPS.</p>
      <p>But if you're using your tracker to keep tabs on calories burned, heart rate, and miles traveled while you hit the trail on your mountain bike, you'll want both a heart rate monitor and GPS.</p>
      <p>And if you plan on wearing your tracker while you swim laps in the pool, you'll want to pay attention to the waterproof rating. And make sure the model you pick out tracks swimming.</p>
      <p>
        <b>3. Look at the wristband</b>
      </p>
      <p>If you're blessed with average-sized wrists, wristband fit likely isn't an issue for you. But if your wrists are on the slimmer or thicker side, you'll want to pay attention to the bands that come with fitness trackers.</p>
      <p>Brands like Fitbit typically offer fitness trackers in different sizes ranging from small/medium to large. Others offer adjustable bands that provide a snug fit for wrists of all sizes.</p>
      <p>Another thing to note about the wristbands is the strap style. Is it a traditional watch-style strap with a buckle? Or does it simply "button" together? The button style sometimes feels less secure, especially if we're at the gym tackling three-point rows and deadlifts.</p>
      <p>Luckily, most fitness trackers come with band replacements. This lets you upgrade the material, color, and fit if you like. We're all about having choices.</p>
      <p>
        <b>4. Consider style</b>
      </p>
      <p>Are you OK with a fitness tracker that looks like a fitness tracker? Or do you prefer something that looks like a traditional watch?</p>
      <p>Activity trackers come in all shapes and sizes, so you can go as simple or fancy, modern or traditional, as you like.</p>
      <p>If you're looking for a smartwatch that could fool a coworker into thinking it's an actual watch, we're impressed by the design of the Samsung Galaxy Watch Active. If you're looking for something simple, the Fitbit Inspire and Fitbit Inspire HR are slim and uncomplicated.</p>
      <p>
        <b>5. Don't forget about the apps</b>
      </p>
      <p>Our favorite fitness tracker app is Fitbit, hands down. It's user-friendly and offers a full range of features. It even has menstrual cycle tracking, which we've never seen on any other fitness tracker apps.</p>
      <p>The Fitbit app also integrates well with many popular third-party apps for a more robust tracking system that meets your needs. Here are some of our favorites:</p>
      <p>Top 5 health and wellness apps</p>
      <ol>
        <li>MyFitnessPal</li>
        <li>Calm</li>
        <li>C25K</li>
        <li>Headspace</li>
        <li>Strava</li>
      </ol>
      <h4>How do fitness trackers work?</h4>
      <p>Each fitness tracker works slightly differently, but some sensors and technology are relatively common across them all, like altimeters, accelerometers, and optical sensors. Here's some of the technology you may stumble upon if you break into your fitness watch.</p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>3-axis accelerometer</b> — This measures your movements in every direction and helps track those steps.</li>
        <li><b>Gyroscope</b> — This gets a read on your orientation and rotation as you move. Now it's time for some split squats!</li>
        <li><b>Altimeter</b> — Whether you're tracking your hike up the mountain or climbing stairs on your work break, this keeps track of your altitude.</li>
        <li><b>Optical sensors</b> — These shine light into your capillaries to measure how quickly or slowly your blood is pumping to give you an idea of your current heart rate.</li>
        <li><b>Actigraphy</b> — Ever wondered how activity trackers monitor your sleep? Actigraphy identifies your sleep patterns by tracking your activity and rest cycles, then gives you an idea of how much you tossed and turned last night.</li>
        <li><b>GPS</b> — The GPS receiver collects data from different satellites to calculate your position as a set of coordinates. This lets you track your terrain and distance after a trail run or day on the slopes.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Of course, not all fitness trackers are created equal when it comes to the accuracy of their sensors. For the most part, actigraphy isn't as accurate as measuring your sleep cycle in a lab, and optical sensors aren't as precise as bioimpedance sensors when it comes to monitoring your heart rate.</p>
      <h4>What are the best fitness watches for large wrists?</h4>
      <p>When you're shopping for a fitness tracker, it's important to keep size in mind. Luckily, most bands can be adjusted to fit your wrist without an issue. If you have a particularly large wrist circumference, you'll want to keep an eye out for options that'll work for you.</p>
      <p>Out of our list of 10 top fitness trackers, here's what we recommend for large wrists:</p>
