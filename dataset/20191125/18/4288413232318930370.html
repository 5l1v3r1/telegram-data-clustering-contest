      <p>Photographer Tajreen Hedayet of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHSCZ_0eYHCPdDNP4RWarLw">Tajreen&amp;Co</a> has released a simple, straight-to-the-point tutorial that will show you how to capture soft, colorful, ‘dreamy’ looking portraits even if you don’t have much budget to work with.</p>
      <p>The photo shoot in the video was captured in Hedayet’s living room using a fairly minimal setup. All she had on hand was a colorful paper backdrop, a couple of light stands, two speedlights, a gel pack, some Yongnuo wireless triggers, a cheap star filter, and ultra-sheer tights. For some additional light, she used a cheap LED panel she had lying around, in order to help separate her model from the very colorful background.</p>

      <p>The colorful in “dreamy, colorful portraits” obviously came from gelling the flashes, while the dreamy look came from a combination of the tights and adding the star filter. “It might sound crazy, but stretching sheer tights over a camera lens adds a soft, hazy finish to whatever you shoot,” explains Hedayet. “We used ultra-sheer 8 denier tights for this effect.”</p>
      <p>Combine that with some controlled flares caused by pointing the fill light towards the camera and using a star filter, and she was able to capture the portraits you see above.</p>
      <p>Check out the full video, two-and-a-half minute video up top to see how you can create this effect for yourself, and for more quick-hit portrait photography and editing tutorials like this, definitely give <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHSCZ_0eYHCPdDNP4RWarLw">Hedayet’s channel</a> a look. This isn’t the first time (and it probably won’t be the last) that we’ve <a href="https://petapixel.com/?s=Tajreen%26Co">featured her work</a>.</p>
