      <h1>Frozen 2 breaks record after raking in a cool $350m at the box office</h1>

        <i>Disney film’s opening weekend beats earnings for animated movie set by Toy Story 4</i>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/may/13/frozen-mania-elsa-anna-olaf-disney-emo-princess-let-it-go?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other">Frozen 2</a> has made box office history after achieving the biggest opening weekend in earnings of all time for an animated movie.</p>
      <p>The Disney film made $358 (£277m) in its first three days of cinema release in 37 countries including the US, China and the UK.</p>
      <p>The second chapter of the film, centred on sisters Elsa and Anna, beat the box office record set in June by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/23/toy-story-4-review-franchise-still-very-much-alive">Toy Story 4,</a> which opened to $240.9m worldwide and was made by Disney-owned studio Pixar.</p>
      <p>The film also surpassed <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/dec/05/frozen-review">the first Frozen film</a>, which made $110.6m on its opening weekend in 2013. Frozen, which spawned musical hits such as Let it Go, went on to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/may/13/frozen-mania-elsa-anna-olaf-disney-emo-princess-let-it-go?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other">gross $1.27bn making it the biggest animated film of all time.</a></p>
      <p>“We are definitely thrilled,” said Cathleen Taff, Disney’s president of theatrical distribution. “It is not easy to follow up the original <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/frozen">Frozen</a>. We are cautiously optimistic the film [will] continue to have legs. I think we are going to have a good run.”</p>
      <p>Frozen 2’s box office haul benefited from its simultaneous release. Generally, animated films have a more staggered roll out worldwide, which reduces the opportunity for a mammoth opening weekend.</p>
      <p>In the US, the film made $130m – making it the biggest animated film opening for November, beating The Incredibles, The Grinch and the first Frozen.</p>
      <p>In the UK, Frozen 2 took £15m , a record in the country for an animated film. It is the third-highest opening of the year behind The Lion King (£16.7m) and Avengers: Endgame (£43.4m).</p>
      <p>Frozen 2 is the highest-grossing debut ever for Walt Disney Animation Studios, which has been making films since 1937.</p>
      <p>Hasbro and other officially licensed toy makers are flooding the market with merchandise – from Anna and Elsa dolls to castle play sets – in anticipation of a worldwide merchandise stampede alongside the success of the film in the run-up to Christmas.</p>
      <p>Disney has partnered with more companies than it did for the original Frozen, which lacked the merchandise to cope with the demand from cinema-goers. Partners include fashion accessory chain Claire’s, according to the Wall Street Journal.</p>
      <p>Disney has so far made about $3.5bn at the box office this year thanks to a string of hits including <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/aug/05/disney-king-of-the-box-office-now-primed-to-do-battle-with-netflix">Avengers: Endgame, which overtook Titanic</a> to be the top-grossing film of all time, The Lion King and Aladdin. The entertainment giant is set for a bumper festive season with the release of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, expected to be another billion-dollar global hit. Five Disney films have so far made more than $1bn at the box office this year, including Captain Marvel and Toy Story 4.</p>
