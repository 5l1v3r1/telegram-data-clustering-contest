      <p>Last month, Microsoft announced two new dual-screen devices, Surface Neo and Surface Duo. While the <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/microsoft-announces-revolutionary-dual-screen-surface-neo-device/">Surface Neo</a> is powered by Windows 10X, the <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/surface-android-phone-is-here-and-it-is-called-surface-duo/">Surface Duo</a> is powered by Google’s Android platform. Microsoft today provided information on how to develop apps for these dual-screen devices. First of all, Microsoft made is clear that Surface Duo will be able to run all the Android apps available from Play Store and the Surface Neo will be able to run UWP and Win32 apps.</p>

      <p>Even though the existing apps just work on these new dual-screen devices, Microsoft is recommending developers to embrace these new class of devices by taking advantage of key postures and layouts across dual-screen and foldable PCs. For native app developers, Microsoft is currently developing a common model layered onto existing platform-specific tools and frameworks for Windows and Android. For web developers, Microsoft will depend on standards-based model. Microsoft will develop web standards and APIs to allow developers to take advantage of cross-platform dual-screen capabilities. If you are interested in developing for dual-screen devices, send a mail to dualscreendev@microsoft.com to get more info.</p>
      <p>Microsoft also mentioned that it will share more details for developers in early 2020.</p>
