      <p>While <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/man-utd/"><b>Manchester United</b></a> have allowed the defender to spend the season on loan at Stadio Olimpico, there is no option for a full-time move to become a formality in the summer.</p>
      <p>However, after impressing during the early stages of his stint in Italy, Smalling is keen to commit his future to the Serie A club.</p>
      <p>According to <i>Il Tempo</i>, the Englishman's representative has flown to the capital to speak with I Giallorossi about what it will take to confirm a move at the end of the campaign.</p>
      <p>United are allegedly ready to demand in the region of Â£18m due to the 30-year-old effectively having over three-and-a-half years left on his contract.</p>
      <p>Smalling has contributed two goals from his 11 appearances in all competitions.</p>
