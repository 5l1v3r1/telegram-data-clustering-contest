      <p>Despite being in their nineties, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and his wife Siti Hasmah were photographed on a loving date in Kuala Lumpur on Saturday (Nov 23).</p>
      <p>The photos, which Mahathir posted on Twitter with the caption “Once in a while, (I) take Hasmah on a date to KL”, attracted 47,000 likes and 16,000 retweets in just two days.</p>

      <p>They were also photographed smiling lovingly at each other in a restaurant over a meal comprising coffee and garlic bread.</p>
      <p>The PM’s wife was dressed in a purple top and even wore a heart-shaped sliver necklace on the date.</p>
      <p>In the comments, many said the couple were “cute”, “sweet” and “relationship goals”, with one even calling them “old but gold”.</p>
      <p>Some gleefully pointed out that the PM was driving a Proton X70 and used a SmartTAG – which ceased production in 2018 – to pay toll fees. Others cheekily asked if the PM’s bodyguard had taken the pictures, or felt like a third wheel.</p>
      <p>One even apologised for interrupting the couple’s date.</p>

      <p>Netizens also stepped in to defend the PM from comments on the post targeted at recent political developments and Mahathir’s handover.</p>
      <p>“Netizens shouldn’t connect this post to politics,” wrote @mizzshakillerz. “Honestly, I feel so touched by how sweet it is.”</p>
      <p>Another user, @Shahrulazam1968, said: “I don’t see anything wrong with these photos. They wanted to have some time off. Let them be. I can see a lot of positive things from these shots.”</p>
