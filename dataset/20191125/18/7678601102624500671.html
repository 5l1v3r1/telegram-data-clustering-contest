      <p>The Energy and Mineral Resources Ministry appointed on Monday a new director for coal business development and a new head of the Aceh Upstream Oil and Gas Management Agency (BPMA).</p>
      <p>“My instructions to them are to manage Aceh’s oil and gas fields as optimally as possible and to optimize coal production to meet domestic needs,” said Energy and Mineral Resources Minister Arifin Tasrif at the inauguration ceremony in Jakarta.</p>
      <p>Sujatmoko, the ministry’s former head of renewable energy research and development, was appointed as the new director of coal business development, a position that had been vacant since November last year, when his predecessor changed positions within the ministry.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Teuku Mohamad Faisal, a former deputy head of operations at the BPMA, was officially appointed as the agency’s new head after having served as acting head since 2017, when his predecessor retired.</p>
      <p>“We are finding out what we need to implement to push production, including enhanced oil recovery (EOR) techniques. Production in Aceh is indeed declining,” he said.</p>
      <p>The two latest developments in Aceh are oil and gas company Zaratex’s commitment to invest US$134 million to develop the offshore Peusangan B field and Spanish company Repsol’s two year extension to develop the Andaman III Block.</p>
