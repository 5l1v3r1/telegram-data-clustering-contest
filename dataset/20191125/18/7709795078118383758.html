        <b>Ben Coley and Richard Mann are joined by Eurosport’s Neal Foulds ahead of the first Triple Crown event of the snooker season, the UK Championship in York.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Neal Foulds reflects on some of his fondest UK Championship memories before looking ahead to this year’s renewal, one which sees Judd Trump head the betting following an irresistible run of form over the last 12 months.</p>
      <p>As ever, Ronnie O’Sullivan gets plenty of attention but Neal fancies another from the famous Class of 92 to enjoy a big run in York while Richard has a couple of big-priced bets picked out of his own.</p>
