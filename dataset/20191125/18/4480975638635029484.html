      <h1>ECB speakers (Lane): Need to be be careful when reading yield curve - full speech</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T18:03:25+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 18:03</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fxstreet.com/author/ross-j-burland" target="_blank">Ross J Burland</a></address>
      <p>European Central Bank's chief economist, Philip Lane's speech has been published on the ECB's website – <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2019/html/ecb.sp191125~b0ecc8e6f0.en.html">full speech</a>.</p>
      <h3>Key notes</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Need to be careful when reading the yield curve.</li>
        <li>Yield curve plays a key role in the transmission of monetary policy, under both standard and non-standard policy measures.</li>
        <li>Currently, staff estimate euro area sovereign 10-year rate to be more than 100bps lower than in a counterfactual where app never happened, and the curve to be distinctly flatter.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>FX implications</h4>
      <p>There is nothing relating to <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/economic-calendar">monetary policy</a> or the economy directly hence there has been no market reaction to the press release so far. </p>
      <h3>Update during presser</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>ECB will be in the bond market for a long time. </li>
        <li>ECB will be in QE far into the future. </li>
        <li>Can change instruments if situation worsens. </li>
        <li>Asked what ECB would do if inflation outlook worsens - "Best guide might be what we did in September, a little bit of everything".</li>
        <li>Recent rise in yields suggests to us that investors are a little less pessimistic about economy.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>FX implications to presser</h4>
      <p>This is euro negative but there is no market reaction considering how much of that is already priced in. </p>
