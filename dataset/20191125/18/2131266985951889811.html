      <p>LaMelo Ball became the youngest player in Australian NBL history to record a 'triple-double' and underlined his claims to the No.1 overall NBA draft spot in 2020.</p>
      <p>Ball's game-high 32 points, 11 rebounds and 13 assists helped Illawarra beat Cairns 114-106 in overtime at the WIN Entertainment Centre.</p>
      <p>The 18-year-old's game-tying three-pointer with six seconds remaining on Monday night sent the contest to overtime, with scores locked at 99-99.</p>
      <p>He then played his part in overtime to get the Hawks home.</p>
      <p>"Pretty much I just believe in myself and my confidence levels are just really high," Ball said of his performance. "So, every shot I take, I feel like it's going in.</p>
      <p>"I try to improve every day, pretty much, and just work my hardest."</p>
      <p>Californian Ball is on a two-year deal with Illawarra, as part of the NBL's Next Stars programme, which was launched in March 2018.</p>
      <p>Under the programme, the NBL contracts young overseas players - like Ball and NZ Breakers' RJ Hampton - and fast-tracks their development to give them the best chance of being drafted into the NBA, which does not accept players straight out of high school.</p>
      <p>Ball originally intended playing college basketball at UCLA, but concerns over NCAA eligibility rules prompted his Australian move, though an NBA clause in his contract is expected to see him depart after one season.</p>
      <p>Illawarra coach Matt Flinn heaped further praise on Ball, after a record night for the rookie.</p>
      <p>"I think everyone saw tonight what he's capable of," Flinn said. "We see it pretty regularly in practice, when the doors are closed, but it was really nice for him to get into a flow.</p>
      <p>"He just impacts the game in so many different ways. It's exciting to be a part of and it's also the way he brings his teammates into the game as well.</p>
      <p>"There's so many good players in this league, but the really great ones make everyone around them better and I think we saw tonight he can bring other people into the game."</p>
      <p>The win propelled the Hawks above the Breakers, who are now dead last on the ANBL ladder. </p>
