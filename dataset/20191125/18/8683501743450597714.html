        <b>Spoilers for the latest Netflix holiday movie can definitely be found below. If you haven’t watched it yet, what’s stopping you?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Vanessa Hudgens has become a bit of <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2468774/vanessa-hudgens-is-doing-another-netflix-christmas-movie-and-this-one-has-time-travel">a Christmas staple over at Netflix</a>, and her latest movie <i>The Knight Before Christmas</i>, recently dropped on the subscription streaming service. Thanks to the way the plot of the movie wraps, it leaves room for a potential sequel, but what does Director Monika Mitchell think about <i>The Knight Before Christmas 2</i>?</p>
      <p>Well, as it turns out, she’s most certainly in on the idea of making another movie for Netflix, giving her thoughts on how that next movie would kick off. She recently confirmed a sequel could be a possibility, noting,</p>
      <blockquote>Of course, I can see a sequel. I think Harry Jarvis is definitely involved because the [witch] is there to present him with yet another medallion.</blockquote>
      <p>In <i>The Knight Before Christmas</i>, the aforementioned Harry Jarvis plays Sir Geoffrey, another knight from the 1300s who has a quest ahead of him. In the add-on to <i>The Knight Before Christmas</i>, the end-credits scene brings in the old crone and the young sir. During the scene, the character is once again distracted by the old crone who asks him for help, to which he responds,</p>
      <blockquote>Sir Geoffrey Alexander Edward Lyons, at your service.</blockquote>
      <p>So, we know now Sir Geoffrey has interacted with the old crone and that leaves potential for him to come to the future and find his own partner as well, which is what Monika Mitchell mentions in her interview with <a href="https://www.glamour.com/story/netflix-the-knight-before-christmas-could-get-a-sequel">Glamour</a>.</p>
      <p>To be honest, at first I thought a potential sequel might be a fish-out-of-water story in the other way, this time involving Vanessa Hudgens’ character, Brooke, heading back into the past to meet the people in Cole’s timeline. However, the movie wrapped up in a way that sort of made it seem like Cole was adapting to the new timeline rather admirably (he might even join the police force!), and plus I’m not sure how Brooke would take it if she got called a “wench” or something in Cole’s timeline.</p>

        </a>
      </p>
      <p>This Sir Geoffrey thing indicates how a sequel could happen without heading into the past, which is good because I still have some questions about traveling to the future, like how Cole is able to get a social security card. However, it's worth noting that Monika Mitchell says the details have not officially been ironed out for a sequel yet.</p>
      <blockquote>We don't know who's coming back through time. We don't know if he's gonna go visit his brother. We don't know if Josh and Vanessa would come back and help him out. Maybe some other young lady comes back through time. We'll have to see what the audience responds to.</blockquote>
      <p>It will likely be a little while before we officially get <i>The Knight Before Christmas 2</i>, as Netflix <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2485529/why-netflixs-mindhunter-season-3-is-on-hold">has not officially even greenlighted</a> this sort of project yet.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, Vanessa Hudgens is quickly becoming the queen <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483798/where-did-netflixs-holiday-in-the-wild-film-the-elephants">of holiday movies</a> at Netflix. Her first outing <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2438619/first-look-at-vanessa-hudgens-in-new-royal-netflix-rom-com">was last year’s <i>The Princess Switch</i></a>, which is getting a sequel in 2020 called <i>The Princess Switch: Switched Again</i>.
