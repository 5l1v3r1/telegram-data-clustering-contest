      <h1>'Dangerously overworked' paramedics taking more overtime and sick leave</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T18:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 18:00</time> by <a rel="author">Rachel Clun</a></address>
      <p>Overstretched paramedics are earning in excesss of $100,000 in overtime payments - more than their regular wage - raising serious concerns for their health and safety.</p>
      <p>An Auditor-General's report has also revealed that NSW Ambulance staff had the highest rates of overtime, sick leave and excessive annual leave of any NSW Health service in 2018-2019.</p>
      <p>"Overtime is paid at premium rates and, if not effectively managed, can result in higher costs and work, health and safety issues, particularly when fatigued employees perform high-risk tasks," <a href="https://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/tp/files/76910/Health%202019%20Report.pdf">the report said.</a></p>

      <p>The amount of overtime being paid to paramedics is increasing: 27 employees were each paid more than $100,000 in overtime last financial year, compared to just eight in 2017-2018.</p>
      <p>More broadly, the vast majority (85 per cent) of NSW Ambulance staff received overtime payments, which is a drop from the previous year's 97.8 per cent. However, average overtime payments per employee ballooned to $19,400 in 2018-2019, up from $14,500 the year before.</p>
      <p>Paramedics earn from $70,624 up to $86,151 for specialist intensive care paramedics.</p>
      <p>As well, 13 per cent of NSW Ambulance staff had an annual leave balance of 30 days or more.</p>
      <p>Health Services Union (HSU) secretary Gerard Hayes said the numbers proved the increase in paramedic numbers had not kept up with the growing and ageing population.</p>
      <p>“This is a symptom of a paramedic workforce that is extremely stretched,” he said. “Every day, the demand on paramedics increases.</p>
      <p>“Paramedics work under extreme stress and it’s no surprise that many are suffering burnout.”</p>
      <p>NSW Ambulance was contacted for comment.</p>
      <p>Overtime payments grew to $83.1 million in the 2018-2019 financial year, an increase from $74.8 million in 2017-2018.</p>
      <p>The main overtime expense at $42.7 million was for ''call out'' overtime, which is planned overtime used to maintain services in parts of regional and rural NSW without 24-hour rosters. Overtime to cover staff absences cost NSW Ambulance $20.6 million, while extended shifts cost $16.7 million.</p>
      <p>Paramedic and HSU delegate Tess Oxley said there were not enough crews to cover the work.</p>
      <p>"They’re dangerously overworked, and it’s every crew, every day in my region," she said.</p>
      <p>Ms Oxley, who works in south-western Sydney, said this meant no breaks in a 12-hour shift and being required to do end-of-shift overtime, which essentially means working close to 14 hours without a break.</p>
      <p>"I think the public are very lucky that paramedics are highly skilled and are able to still perform their duties [on shift]," she said.</p>
      <p>"However, it's when we get home or we’re driving home that the repercussions are really noticeable that we’ve done such long, tiring shifts, it definitely takes it toll on family and friends."</p>
      <p>Ms Oxley said the rate of sick leave was not surprising as there was a higher risk of paramedics being run down if they were excessively fatigued.</p>

      <p>"That’s going to be resulting in them being more susceptible to getting illness, and obviously in our industry you can’t come to work when you’re not well," she said.</p>
      <p>Ms Oxley said the state needed more paramedics and ambulances, which would allow staff to take much-needed breaks during shifts and make a "massive difference" to their welfare.</p>
      <p>"When you get those small amounts of time [to] sit down and clear your head ... you’re able to do your job and able to go home and feel just that little bit less fatigued," she said.</p>
