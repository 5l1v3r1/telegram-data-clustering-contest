      <h1>Ryan Reynolds purchases ownership stake in Mint Mobile</h1>
      <h2>Actor calls product 'a bit unconventional'</h2>

      <p>(CNN) - Actor Ryan Reynolds is diversifying his portfolio with the purchase of an ownership stake in mobile wireless provider Mint Mobile.</p>
      <p>The company was created in 2016 with the idea of delivering an "affordable, premium wireless" service direct to consumers, <a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/about-mint-mobile/">according to its website</a>.</p>
      <p>"It's a bit unconventional which is why I like it," Reynolds said in a statement. "Celebrities generally invest in high-end products like skincare brands or delicious gin companies. Yet Mint is making wireless way more affordable at a time when the average American is paying 65 dollars a month. I'm excited to champion a more practical approach to the most essential technology."</p>
      <p>Mint Mobile says Reynolds will be a part of the company's "strategic decision-making" along with helping communications and marketing efforts.</p>
      <p>Reynolds purchased an ownership stake in liquor company Aviation Gin last year, and he has openly promoted the spirit through his social media channels. He also helped create a unique ad that promoted his upcoming Netflix film, "6 Underground," in an ad for Aviation Gin, which was in an ad for a Samsung QLED TV.</p>
      <p>We can only hope Reynolds extends his schtick to promote Mint Mobile.</p>
      <h3>Celebrity investors</h3>
      <p>Reynolds may be trying to follow in the footsteps of other actors who have struck gold with their investments.</p>
