      <p>A suspect is in custody following a manhunt that sent three schools into lockdown Monday afternoon.</p>
      <p>Port McNeill RCMP said the incident started while officers were investigating a motor vehicle incident and found a firearm.</p>
      <p>The suspect, who had been taken to hospital, fled before police arrived, sparking a manhunt.</p>
      <p>Police asked residents to secure their homes and vehicles and report any suspicious activity.</p>
      <p>The Vancouver Island North School District issued a notice about 3:15 p.m. Monday saying that the RCMP had directed all public schools in Port McNeill to go into lockdown “due to an incident that was occurring in the community.”</p>
      <p>At about 3:50 p.m., RCMP allowed a controlled release of students into their parents’ care or onto buses or ferries.</p>
      <p>“All students and staff were safe and followed procedures as expected,” the district said.</p>
      <p>At about 6:20 p.m., police said the man had been taken into custody.</p>
