      <p>He said he still needs to hire technology, accounting, marketing, finance, human resources and data analytics positions to help Zovio's higher education institution and employer clients deliver an enhanced learning experience.</p>
      <p>It was a no-brainer for Clark when he decided to <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/news/2019/04/02/metro-phoenix-gets-new-public-company-with-edtech.html">move Zovio's headquarters from San Diego to Chandler in April</a> .
