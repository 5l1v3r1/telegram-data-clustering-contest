      </p>
      <p>The development caused heated arguments among Nigerians on social media regarding the real nature of the fraud the prominent Nigerian business mogul was accused of committing, especially when the charge did not indicate an individual was duped or defrauded.</p>

      <p>1. Two Nigerians are indicted in the alleged fraud: Allen Onyema and Ejiroghene Eghagha</p>
      <p>Allen Onyema is the CEO and founder of Air Peace while Ejiroghene Eghagha is Air Peace's Chief of Administration and Finance</p>
      <p>2. Onyema was charged with bank fraud and money laundering for allegedly moving more than $20 million from Nigeria through United States bank accounts in a scheme involving false documents based on the purchase of airplanes</p>

      <p>9. Onyema was singularly charged with 27 counts of money laundering while Eghagha was individually charged with one count of aggravated identity theft</p>
      <p>Note that both Onyeama and Eghagha are presumed innocent until the US government is able to prove that they are guilty beyond a reasonable doubt at trial.</p>
      <p>Below are some reactions of Nigerians regarding the indictment:</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, a <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1278355-allen-onyema-us-issues-warrant-arrest-air-peace-boss.html">warrant of arrest has been issued against Onyema</a>. The warrant was signed by Justin Anand, an American magistrate of the US District Court of the Northern District of Georgia.</p>
      <p>The Air Peace boss might be extradited to face the charges against him as the US and Nigeria have a mutual legal assistance policy that allows both countries to extradite suspects facing criminal charges.</p>

      <p>A statement from the law firm of A.O. Alegeh &amp; Co said that Onyema is ready to defend himself over the allegations made against him by the US Attorney.</p>
      <p><b>Legit.ng</b> gathered that the law firm also noted that he has a track record built on honesty and integrity, adding that he would take all necessary steps to clear his good name and hard-earned reputation.</p>
      <p>Recall that Onyema's heroic act was recently commended by Nigerians when he volunteered to airlift Nigerians who were victims of xenophobic attacks in South Africa back to the country.</p>
