      <p><b>The fund is made available</b> to participating banks to finance commercial agricultural enterprises at a maximum interest rate of 9%.</p>
      <p><b>In addition</b>, each State Government could borrow up to N1.0 Billion for on-lending to farmers’ cooperative societies and other areas of agricultural development provided such initiatives/interventions are in line with the objectives of CACS.</p>
      <h3>Highlights of the scheme</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>It has empowered over 1 million people across rural communities as over N600 billion for 593 projects has been disbursed since inception in 2009</li>
        <li>At end-September 2019, the total amount repaid since inception stood at N368.0 billion at end-June 2019</li>
        <li>In the third quarter of 2019, agricultural activities intensified, due, largely, to increased rainfall experienced in most parts of the country.</li>
        <li>Farming activities were centred majorly on the harvest of agricultural produce during the quarter.</li>
        <li>In a bid to curb the farmers/herders clash and ensure a well-integrated meat/dairy industry, a pilot phase of the Livestock Transformation Plan was flagged off in Adamawa, Benue, Kaduna, Plateau, Nasarawa, Taraba and Zamfara states.</li>
        <li>The Plan was targeted at supporting the development of the country’s livestock sub-sector.</li>
