      <p>Liverpool defender <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/virgil-van-dijk/"><b>Virgil van Dijk</b></a> is considered to be a top contender for the award alongside usual suspects <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/lionel-messi/"><b>Lionel Messi</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/cristiano-ronaldo/"><b>Cristiano Ronaldo</b></a>.</p>
      <p>However, with the Merseyside giants having won the Champions League, Hazard feels that <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/sadio-mane/"><b>Sadio Mane</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/mohamed-salah/"><b>Mohamed Salah</b></a> have staked their claim to win the accolade.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <i>Le Parisien</i>, the Belgian said: "I'll give it to a Liverpool player. Mane, Salah or Van Dijk deserve it. If Sadio had won the African Cup of Nations with Senegal, there would have been no debate.</p>
      <p>"It would be nice if he had it. Or Momo, who is a friend of mine. It would be good for African football and for English football."</p>
      <p>The winner will be announced on December 2.</p>
