      <h1>Ex-Barcelona striker Alcacer practically ruled out of Camp Nou return</h1>
      <h2>The forward got injured on Friday and is expected to be sidelined</h2>

      <p>Paco Alcacer is practically ruled out of Borussia Dortmund's game on Wednesday against his former side Barcelona at Camp Nou.</p>
      <p>The striker injured his knee in the Bundesliga over the weekend and had to have six stitches, leaving him unable to run normally.</p>
      <p>Alcacer picked up the injured when the studs of a Paderborn caught his knee on Friday. He had to be taken off and it's highly unlikely that he will recover in time for this week's Champions League game.</p>
      <p>The Spain international had been looking forward to facing his former teammates. He joined the club from Valencia in 2016 but was unable to earn a regular spot in the side.</p>
      <p>Dortmund took him on loan in 2018 and earlier this year made the move permanent following his goalscoring exploits in Germany.</p>
