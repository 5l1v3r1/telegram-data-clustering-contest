      <h3>What you need to know</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The Smart Display 7 is exclusive to B&amp;H through 2019.</li>
        <li>The speakers are mounted under the display rather than beside like on the 8 and 10-inch models</li>
        <li>B&amp;H is offering a $30 discount on the Smart Display 7 and throwing in a Wi-Fi smart plug with purchase.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Lenovo has been selling its <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/lenovo-smart-display">8 and 10-inch Smart Displays</a> for a while now, and earlier this year came out with a smaller beside version with the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/lenovo-smart-clock-review">Lenovo Smart Clock.</a> Now, the company is releasing a new Smart Display 7 that will, you guessed it, have a 7-inch display and have all of the Google Assistant features you'd expect.</p>
      <p>Different from its larger siblings, this 7-inch version has the dual-speakers mounted below the display — rather than on the side of the display — to give better stereo sound. Lenovo also included the same physical camera cover that we had from the previous Smart Displays.</p>
