      <p>Eric Ebron has seen his 2019 season come to an end after he was placed on injured reserve by the Indianapolis Colts.</p>
      <p>The Colts (6-5) are still in the NFL playoff hunt but will have to negotiate the last five games of the season without tight end Ebron after confirming the roster move on Monday.</p>
      <p>The 26-year-old is poised to undergo surgery on both ankles, having first featured on his side's injury report with the problems around four weeks ago.</p>
      <p>He played and tallied four catches for 44 yards in Thursday's 20-17 divisional defeat against the Houston Texans but will play no further part in the campaign.</p>
      <p>Ebron has 31 catches for 375 yards and three touchdowns this season, falling short of his 66 catches for 750 yards and 13 touchdowns which saw him make a first career Pro Bowl in 2018.</p>
      <p>The Colts, who are just behind Houston (7-4) in the AFC South, have brought back Ross Travis to fill the roster spot vacated by Ebron.</p>
      <p>Starter Jack Doyle and Mo Alie-Cox likely in line for additional snaps when the team returns to action at home to the Tennessee Titans on Sunday.</p>
