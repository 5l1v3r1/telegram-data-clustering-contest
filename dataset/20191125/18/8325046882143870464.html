      <h3>How to get verified on <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/instagram">Instagram</a></h3>
      <p>Applying for verification itself is a pretty painless process. Here’s how to do it:</p>
      <p><b>1.</b> Pull up your Instagram app and navigate to the menu (the three bars in the top right corner) on your account homepage.</p>
      <p><b>2.</b> Look for the Settings option at the bottom of the menu and click it.</p>

        <figcaption>Open the Settings page.<cite>Sarah Wells/Business Insider</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p><b>3.</b> Click the word “Account” on the next page.</p>
      <p><b>4.</b> On your Account Settings page, you should see “Request Verification” at the bottom of the page. Click it.</p>

        <figcaption>Tap “Request Verification.”<cite>Sarah Wells/Business Insider</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p><b>5.</b> From there you’ll be prompted to provide your full name, a photo of an official document to verify it (like a driver’s license, passport, or business tax filing), and a category that best describes your account (such as blogger/influencer, business/brand/organization, or news/media).</p>

        <figcaption>Fill in the verification prompts, including your identity and page category.<cite>Sarah Wells/Business Insider</cite></figcaption>

      <p>And voila! The fate of your Insta-cred is now in the hands of Instagram.</p>
      <h3>Here’s the criteria Instagram uses to verify an account</h3>
      <p>Once you’ve submitted your verification request to Instagram, it’s a waiting game to see whether or not you’ll be approved. But, in the meantime, you can take a look at its criteria to see how you stack up against Instagram’s standards.</p>
      <p>According to Instagram’s <a href="https://help.instagram.com/854227311295302">help site</a> there a few key attributes it looks for when designating a verified account.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Is your account authentic?</b> This one’s easy. As long as you’re being yourself and not purposefully impersonating another person or brand, you should be all set.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Is your account unique?</b> This might sound a little like the first rule, but instead of focusing on impersonating accounts, this caveat focuses on how many Instagram accounts you’re operating. For example, an influencer or brand would need to have just one central account that represented them (instead of several different ones) in order to be verified.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Is your account complete?</b> Instagram stipulates that a “complete” profile must have a bio, profile picture and at least one post. Easy enough. But the trickier part might be that Instagram also specifies that your account can’t have “add me” links to other social channels, like a promotion to follow your Twitter account.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Is your account notable?</b> This is both the most open-ended standard and (arguably) the most important. Instagram defines notable as a brand or entity that is “well-known” or “highly-searched” and in part uses media coverage to determine this status – excluding paid promotional content.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Apart from those criteria, and adhering to Instagram’s <a href="https://help.instagram.com/477434105621119?helpref=faq_content">community guidelines</a> and <a href="http://help.instagram.com/581066165581870?helpref=faq_content">terms of service</a>, determining <i>exactly</i> what makes or breaks a verification request is still a bit of a mystery.</p>
      <p>And hey, if Instagram denies your campaign for verification this time around, you can always apply again in 30 days.</p>
