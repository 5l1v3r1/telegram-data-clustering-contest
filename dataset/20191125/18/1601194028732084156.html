      <p>There was a time when a report regarding CM Punk's WWE return popped up every week. Now that he is back, well...kind of...the narrative has changed. When will CM Punk wrestle again inside a WWE ring? That's the question on everyone's mind.</p>
      <p>That may not happen anytime soon but <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/wwe">WWE</a> could still use the former World Champion in other interesting situations that are miles away from the ring.</p>
      <p>As reported by <a href="https://www.pwinsider.com/">PWInsider</a>, WWE is considering getting CM Punk as a guest on <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/stone-cold-steve-austin">Stone Cold Steve Austin</a>'s 'The Broken Skull Sessions' podcast.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/wwe/18-things-we-learned-from-the-undertaker-s-out-of-character-interview-with-steve-austin">WWE Network special's recent edition had Undertaker on as a guest</a>, and the future WWE Hall of Famer shared many previously unknown stories about his legendary career.</p>
      <p>WWE now wants <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/cm-punk">CM Punk</a> to appear on the show and open up on a variety of topics.</p>
      <p>Here's what PWInsider's report stated:</p>
      <blockquote>The Steve Austin-Undertaker WWE Network broadcast is now streaming and is a great discussion between the two, well worth going out of your way to watch. There was a lot of talk over the weekend internally that WWE wanted CM Punk for a future Austin episode.</blockquote>
      <p>Punk currently works as an analyst and special contributor on the FS1 show WWE Backstage and as reiterated a few times already, the 5-time WWE Champion is contracted by FOX and not WWE.</p>
      <p>Triple H opened up about the possibility of seeing Punk get back into the ring again during a recent interview. The Game brought up the adage, 'never say never', before stating that he has not talked to Punk about a potential in-ring return.</p>
      <p>For now, we should all be glad that he is involved in pro wrestling in some capacity rather than trying to push him towards lacing up his wrestling boots again.</p>
      <p>Punk may have no intention of wrestling right now, but he may be up for an insightful chat with Steve Austin on the WWE Network show. Punk has always drawn comparisons with Austin and it would be great to see the two sit down for an in-depth conversation.</p>
      <p>In case you haven't watched The Undertaker edition yet, we highly recommend that you do it immediately.</p>
