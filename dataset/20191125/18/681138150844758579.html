        <b>Two teenagers were robbed at knifepoint in Wickham Market after their car was chased along country lanes by four men in another car, a court has heard.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The teenagers, aged 16 and 17, and a friend were driving from Framlingham towards Martlesham in a SEAT Ibiza at around 11pm when a Vauxhall Corsa came up behind them in Hacheston with its lights on full beam, Ipswich Crown Court was told.</p>
      <p>The driver of the SEAT allowed the Corsa to overtake but shortly afterwards the Corsa pulled on to a garage forecourt and when the SEAT went past it began to follow it again, said David Wilson, prosecuting.</p>
      <p>"The driver of the SEAT was concerned about what was happening. It didn't feel right," said Mr Wilson.</p>
      <p>The SEAT driver drove along unlit country roads to Wickham Market pursued by the Corsa and turned into Dallinghoo Road and a housing estate where he stopped the car and turned off the lights.</p>
      <p>"Unfortunately that move failed and they were seen by their pursuers who drove up to the SEAT," said Mr Wilson.</p>
      <p>One of the four men in the Corsa approached the driver's door of the SEAT and after unlocking the door through the window allegedly punched the driver in the face.</p>
      <p>One of the men who approached the SEAT was holding a machete and another had a modelling knife, and the occupants of the SEAT were ordered to "hand over everything" they had, said Mr Wilson.</p>
      <p>The driver of the SEAT had the machete held to his throat and was allegedly robbed of a car stereo in a box, badminton rackets and his wallet while one of his passengers had his mobile phone taken.</p>
      <p>Before the court are Abbas Uddin, 26, of no fixed address, Tawfiq O'Connor, 18, of no fixed address and Liam Roberts, 19, of Margate Road, Ipswich.</p>
      <p>They have all denied two offences of robbery on April 24 last year.</p>
      <p>The jury has been told that a fourth man, Lamar Dagnon, 21, of Nansen Road, Ipswich has admitted the two robberies.</p>
      <p>The trial continues.</p>
