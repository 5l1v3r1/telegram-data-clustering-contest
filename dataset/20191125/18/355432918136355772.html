      <p>The chances of a recession in the coming 12 months have dropped, according to S&amp;P Global, which tracks the issue.<br/><br/>"Our recession model, which is based on key financial market indicators up to mid-November, indicates that the probability of a U.S. recession starting in the coming 12 months has moved down to 30%. The probability of recession risk based on this model was 35% in August," said Beth Ann Bovino, the companyâ€™s chief economist for the U.S.<br/><br/>Over the summer, bond markets flashed one of the best-known indicators of a coming recession, sending jitters through the markets. But as bond markets calmed and companies continued to post strong earnings in light of strong consumer demand, anxiety over a downturn eased.<br/><br/>Rate cuts from the Federal Reserve and some signs that the manufacturing sector may be recovering boosted the outlook as well.<br/><br/>Economic growth is still expected to slow in 2020, but the prospect of a recession in a presidential election year would spell trouble for <a href="https://thehill.com/people/donald-trump">President Trump</a>, who has made economic growth central to his reelection campaign.</p>
