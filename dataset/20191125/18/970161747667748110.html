      <p>Emmerdale is set to see the return of a familiar character very soon as Ellis Chapman returns to the Dales.</p>
      <p>Viewers were told that he was leaving to stay with mum Jessie (Sandra Marvin) in Dubai following her split from Marlon Dingle – with fans assuming that he wouldn’t be seen again.</p>
      <p>However Ellis comes back into focus on Monday night’s episode <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/25/emmerdale-spoilers-sttacked-al-ellis-return-11212214/">as tensions rise between his dad Al (Michael Wildman)</a> and Billy (Jay Kontzle)</p>
      <p>Does this mean he’s heading back to the soap – and why did he leave in the first place?</p>
      <p>Here’s what you need to know…</p>
      <h3>Why did Ellis leave Emmerdale?</h3>
      <p>Ellis made his exit from Emmerdale after Asan N’Jie, the actor who played him, was sacked from the soap.</p>

      <p>He was sacked following a fight<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/11/emmerdale-star-asan-njie-sacked-threatening-knife-hollyoaks-star-jamie-lomas-10722752/"> with Hollyoaks actor Jamie Lomas at the TV Choice Awards in September which was caught on video.</a></p>

      <p>Asan later said in a statement: ‘My behaviour at the TV Choice Awards was completely unacceptable and very much out of character.</p>
      <p>‘I sincerely apologise to everybody who has been affected especially Jamie Lomas, the whole Emmerdale team, our audience, ITV, my family, and the organisers of the TV Choice Awards.</p>
      <p>‘I am devastated, accept full responsibility for my actions and I am determined to learn from this.’</p>

      <p>While Asan left the soap immediately, Ellis continued to appear on screen for a while after scenes which had already been filmed were aired.</p>
      <p>Those showed him getting to work on his new business and growing close to Belle Dingle (Eden Taylor-Draper) but his exit to Dubai was then explained <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/17/emmerdale-airs-exit-sacked-star-asan-njie-ellis-leaves-10938702/">in a series of scenes between other characters discussing where he had gone.</a></p>
      <h3>Is Ellis returning with a new actor?</h3>

      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/08/new-ellis-aaron-anthony-emmerdale-takes-sacked-asan-njie-11065787/">Aaron is </a>best known for the Sky One series Delicious, in which he played Adam Hesketh, although he’s also been in episodes of Hidden, Doctors and Holby City.</p>
      <p>‘Emmerdale is a cracking show with a brilliant cast that I’m over the moon to now be a part of,’ Aaron said of his casting.</p>
      <p>‘I know Ellis is a well loved character and I’m looking forward to continuing his journey and all that’s in store for him.’</p>
      <p>He’s set to make his screen debut in December as the character returns to the Dales.</p>
