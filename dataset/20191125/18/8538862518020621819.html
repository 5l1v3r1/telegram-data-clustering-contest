      <p>The PlayStation Awards 2019 will be livestreamed on PlayStation's official YouTube channel, it seems. We've had no word on this, by the way -- the scheduled stream has only just popped up on the website.</p>
      <p>In years past, the PlayStation Awards have been Japanese events where developers and their games are celebrated. This year, however, it looks like Sony wants to make the ceremony a global event, which ties in with the company's recent focus on uniting PlayStation's three key fronts (Japan, North America, and Europe) under singular leadership.</p>
      <p>There are whispers and rumours going around that the PlayStation Awards 2019 could host a number of game reveals and updates on titles that are currently in development -- but we wouldn't get your hopes up until Sony makes a statement.</p>
      <p>The livestream is set for the 3rd December at 08:00am PST. We'll be sure to update this article as soon as we know more.</p>
