      <h1>Tottenham fans react as Ben Davies joins four-man injury list</h1>
      <h2>Ben Davies stared in Jose Mourinho’s first game.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T18:45:15+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 18:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/jay-williams/" target="_blank">Jay Williams</a></address>
      <p>Tottenham Hotspur defender Ben Davies has joined the injury list.</p>
      <p>Ahead of the midweek clash with Olympiakos, Davies has picked up an ankle injury (<a href="https://twitter.com/SpursOfficial/status/1198956772477820928">via @SpursOfficial</a>). The Wales international limped off against West Ham and he will definitely miss tomorrow night’s game.</p>
      <p>Davies was named in the starting line-up as Jose Mourinho picked his first Spurs XI. But he could not complete the full 90 minutes. Now, he will undergo further scans to work out how serious this injury is.</p>

      <p>There are four players definitely ruled out of the midweek Champions League match. Two of them are goalkeepers. Hugo Lloris is still out with his elbow injury while Michel Vorm – signed to cover Lloris – has a calf concern.</p>
      <p>Erik Lamela remains sidelined with a hamstring problem and fans are getting concerned about him. The Argentine midfielder has missed a lot of action during his Tottenham career.</p>
      <p>Aside from that, Mourinho should have a fully fit squad. Tanguy Ndombele and Jan Vertonghen are back to boost his options. But Davies’ absence will be a blow.</p>
      <p>Here are some tweets about Tottenham’s injury list after Davies joined three others on the sidelines.</p>
