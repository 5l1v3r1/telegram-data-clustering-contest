      <p>Nizwa was named the capital of Islamic culture in the Arab region for 2015. But that was one of two iconic incidents to take place in the city that year. This award by the Islamic Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (ISESCO) aside, 2015 was also the year in which the Sultan Qaboos Grand Mosque in Nizwa was opened.<br/><br/>Opened in September 2015, and named after His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said, the mosque is now a hard-to-miss structure as you enter Nizwa. Already a renowned centre of learning, arts and culture of the ancient world, the addition of the Sultan Qaboos Grand Mosque in Nizwa only adds a modern touch to the city, while respecting its past and its traditions. “Nizwa has, through the ages, been one of Oman’s most important centres of knowledge and learning,” said ISESCO. “Its famous mosques used to be schools which produced cohorts of scholars, thinkers, writers and experts. The educational and religious facilities have also played a vital role in the promotion of learning and education.”<br/><br/>Originally called the Grand Mosque of Nizwa, the structure was built between 720 and 815 AD, before a series of renovations took place to expand the mosque into one that would easily fit worshippers from the surrounding areas. The mosque is capable of accommodating up to 10,500 worshippers, and its stunning yet humble exterior has been built following the practices of Omani architecture. “Nizwa is a fitting location for a major mosque, second only to the Grand Mosque in Muscat,” said the Ministry of Information. “Simplicity of form and selective use of decoration are characteristics that distinguish the new mosque from those in other regions. The four minarets give the building a unique quality, reinforcing its position as a major landmark for the community it serves. “The colour of the building and materials reflect what is traditionally used in the area,” added the Ministry. “The mosque, built on 80,000 square metres, is adjacent to the Nizwa wadi which gives an excellent view of the building. The area available for external prayer allows for an additional 5,300 worshippers.”</p>
