      <h2>Magpies are back in action against Boreham Wood on Tuesday</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T18:29:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 18:29</time> by <a rel="author">Leigh Curtis</a></address>
      <p>Neal Ardley has launched a spirited defence of his Notts County players as he urged them to rediscover their swagger.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/notts-county-fc">Magpies</a> entertain Boreham Wood at <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/meadow-lane">Meadow Lane</a> on Tuesday night from their defeat to Aldershot at the weekend as the club suffered back to back defeats for the first time this season.</p>
      <p>With four points separating them from the top seven, Notts fans are eager for the club to get back to winning ways in an incredibly congested National League table.</p>
      <p>And Ardley is eager for his players not to throw the baby out with the bath water as a result of their last defeats.</p>
      <p>“We had a bit of a swagger about us until a certain point and it’s important we don’t let doubt creep in,” said the boss.</p>
      <p>“My message to the players is ‘don’t stop believing, let’s not become a team that scraps for points in a way that evens the playing field’.</p>
      <p>“We were on a run of three defeats in 19 games – that shows we were doing something right and we can’t come away from that just because we’ve lost a couple.</p>

      <p>“We’ve done well and can’t press the panic button because we’ve had a couple of indifferent results.</p>
      <p>“We’re not on the verge of a crisis. We’ve had a bad week but, by the end of this one, we can turn it into a good one.”</p>
      <p>Notts have fitness doubts over winger Sean Shields who has an ankle problem, while Damian McCrory has fractured his knuckles.</p>
      <p>Alex Lacey also has a tight hamstring. Mitch Rose is not suspended despite claims he would miss tomorrow night after picking up a fifth booking against Aldershot.</p>
      <p>One of those yellows came in the FA Cup and does not count towards the National League.</p>
