        <li>A Texas man says he found out he had a potentially fatal heart problem after his <a href="https://businessinsider.com/category/apple-watch">Apple Watch</a> notified him that his heartbeat was irregular.</li>
        <li>The 79-year-old told <a href="https://cbsaustin.com/news/local/smartwatch-detects-heart-problem-before-central-texas-man-notices-symptoms">CBS Austin</a> that doctors confirmed his <a href="https://businessinsider.com/category/apple-watch">Apple Watch</a>‘s diagnosis, and he underwent surgery to correct his heart rhythm.</li>
        <li><a href="https://businessinsider.com/category/apple">Apple</a> has touted the health benefits of the Apple Watch, and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/apple-watch-saves-man-life-heart-condition">others have testified</a> that their devices detected heart problems in the past.</li>

      <p>A Texas man says he found out he had a potentially fatal heart problem thanks to his Apple Watch.</p>
      <p>“The watch dinged me … I looked down and it said you are in atrial fibrillation,” Ray Emerson, a 79-year-old veterinarian from Waco, Texas, told <a href="https://cbsaustin.com/news/local/smartwatch-detects-heart-problem-before-central-texas-man-notices-symptoms">CBS Austin</a>. “It told me I wasn’t feeling as good as I thought I was.”</p>
      <p>Emerson visited a doctor, who confirmed that he was experiencing <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/atrial-fibrillation/symptoms-causes/syc-20350624">atrial fibrillation</a>, a condition characterized by irregular heartbeat that can increase the risk of strokes, blood clots, and heart failure.</p>
      <p>He underwent surgery to correct the issue, and said he thinks he wouldn’t have detected the problem without the notification from his Apple Watch.</p>
      <p>Emerson is one of many Apple Watch users who say their device alerted them to potentially life-threatening problems. Last year, a <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/apple-watch-told-46-year-man-irregular-heartbeat/story?id=59726093">46-year-old in Virginia</a> was similarly warned of heart irregularities, and last month a New Jersey hiker’s Apple Watch <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/hiker-apple-watch-dials-911-cliff-fall-saves-life-report-2019-10">automatically called 911 after he fell off a cliff</a>.</p>
      <p>Apple Watches with watchOS 5 or later are equipped with a <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/watch/apda88aefe4c/5.0/watchos/5.0">Heart Rate</a> app, which lets users check their heart rate and receive notifications when their heart rate exceeds a certain threshold.</p>
      <p>Apple has touted the wearable device as a <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-watch-series-5/health/">medical asset</a>. During its annual launch event in September, Apple showed video testimony from users who said the Apple Watch helped notify them of health issues and alleviate medical conditions.</p>
      <p>Jason Zagrodzky, a cardiac surgeon at St. David’s Medical Center in Austin, told CBS Austin that he regularly treats patients who were alerted to heart problems by their Apple Watches.</p>
      <p>“I would say probably at least once or twice a week someone comes to me solely because their watch said, hey, you’ve got a serious problem,” said Zagrodzky <a href="https://cbsaustin.com/news/local/smartwatch-detects-heart-problem-before-central-texas-man-notices-symptoms">told the outlet</a>.</p>
