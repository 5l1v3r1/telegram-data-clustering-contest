      <p>CINCINNATI, Ohio — First responders transported at least three people and are searching for more victims after a <a href="https://www.wcpo.com/news/local-news/hamilton-county/cincinnati/downtown/police-responding-to-partial-building-collapse-downtown">development partially collapsed</a> in downtown Cincinnati Monday afternoon, according to Cincinnati police and fire.</p>
      <p>Three contractors working on the fifth floor of the 4th and Race Street development were injured after crews on the floor above them poured three feet of concrete, which caused part of the building to collapse, according to Chief Roy Winston.</p>
      <p>4th Street is closed between Vine Street and Central Avenue, and Elm Street is closed from 3rd to 5th Streets. The roads will be closed through rush hour and could possibly be closed through the weekend, police said.</p>
      <p>The collapse occurred at about 1:15 p.m. As of 2:30 p.m., crews were still chipping at concrete, searching for potential victims.</p>

      <p>First responders transported two of the contractors to the University of Cincinnati Medical Center; they transported the other worker to Christ Hospital.</p>
      <p>Their injuries range from minor to serious, Winston said, but all three workers were stable as of 2 p.m. Monday.</p>
      <p>The building, which is under construction, is a <a href="https://www.3cdc.org/project/4th-race/">3CDC project, </a>according to Vice President of Marketing &amp; Communications at 3CDC Joe Rudemiller. Turner Construction is the contractor.</p>
      <p>Baker Concrete is the sub-contractor working Turner Construction, according to corporate counsel and company spokesman Rich Farr.</p>
      <p>Farr said it’s too early to tell what contributed to the collapse, and the company’s primary concern “is the well-being of any injured co-workers."</p>
      <p>In a statement, Turner Construction said recovery efforts are still ongoing.</p>
      <p>"Earlier today at the Fourth and Race Street project, a section of temporary concrete form work collapsed during a concrete pour on the sixth floor," the company said. "We are aware of injuries to three workers. First responders were called and all construction activity was halted. First responders provided immediate care and the injured workers were transported to nearby hospitals. Recovery efforts are ongoing. Counseling services will be made available to all workers on site. We work extremely hard to prevent days like this and our thoughts are with the injured workers and their families."</p>
      <p>When completed, the $44 million mixed-use development will consist of a 584-space parking garage, 22,000 square feet of commercial space and 264 apartment units.</p>
      <p>All Metro bus stops on 4th Street between Vine Street and Central Avenue are closed.</p>
      <p>Structural engineers were on scene Monday afternoon; crew said the cranes above the street are stable, Winston said.</p>
