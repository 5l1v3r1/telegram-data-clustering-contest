      <p>Lebanese-born Swiss businessman and philanthropist Abdallah Chatila has donated a hat owned by Nazi Germany's leader Adolf Hitler to an Israeli foundation <a href="https://sputniknews.com/society/201911221077375312-sacha-baron-cohen-if-facebook-existed-in-1930s-hitler-wouldve-been-allowed-to-post-anti-jew-ads-/">after purchasing it at an auction in Bavaria</a> to prevent the item from ending up in the hands of neo-Nazis, the Deutsche Welle newspaper reported.</p>
      <p>The magnate wanted to purchase more of items but failed to win other bids.</p>

      <p>"It is extremely important to me that items from this painful historical era do not land in the wrong hands," Chatila told the newspaper in an email.</p>
      <p>He expressed hope that the donated hat would be exhibited at a Holocaust museum.</p>
      <p>The auction in question has meanwhile triggered a backlash from the Jewish community. Among other items that went under the hammer were a unique copy of  Hitler’s Mein Kampf and Eva Braun's silk dress.</p>
      <p>The Jewish community has expressed concerns that the items would be bought by those glorifying Nazism. The auction house, however, maintains that it ensures a strict control of its sales.</p>
