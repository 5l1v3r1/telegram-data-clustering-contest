      <h1>AMD’s 64-core Ryzen Threadripper 3990X processor coming in 2020</h1>

      <p>This month AMD <a href="https://liliputing.com/2019/11/amds-3rd-gen-ryzen-threadripper-cpus-go-up-to-32-cores.html">introduced</a> a new set of Ryzen multi-core desktop processors ranging from the 16-core <b><a href="https://www.amd.com/en/products/cpu/amd-ryzen-9-3950x">Ryzen 9 3950X</a></b> to the 32-core <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/products/cpu/amd-ryzen-threadripper-3970x"><b>Ryzen Threadripper 3970x</b></a>. They’re available for purchase starting today… and AMD is also confirming a new high-end chip coming next year.</p>
      <p>The upcoming <b>AMD Ryzen Threadripper 3990X </b>processor features 64 CPU cores and 128 threads.</p>

      <p>AMD hasn’t mentioned the price or exact release date yet. But odds are that it won’t be cheap. The only target market the chip maker calls out in its <a href="https://community.amd.com/community/gaming/blog/2019/11/25/something-for-everyone-this-november-with-amd-ryzen-9-3950x-3rd-gen-threadripper-and-athlon-3000g-processors">press release</a> is “Hollywood creators” looking for a chip designed to handle “highly scalable workloads of a VFX pro.”</p>
      <p>According to a leaked <a href="https://twitter.com/brolyx5/status/1198892437298507776">product slide shared to Chinese social media</a>, the Ryzen Threadripper 3990X is expected to be a 280 watt processor with 288MB of total cache. Interestingly, that’s the same TDP as AMD’s 24-core and 32-core Threadripper chips, despite having twice the core count.</p>
      <p>That probably means the individual CPU cores will run at lower clock speeds. But the sheer number of cores could help… VFX pros, I guess. Most users would probably be hard-pressed to find tasks that require more than 32-cores… but I’m sure it’s just a matter of time before developers come up with applications that can leverage all the resources of AMD’s new high-end processors.</p>
