      <p>A $9 million lottery winner sued for another $10 million after discovering the draw the week before his win was rigged.</p>
      <p>Larry Dawson, of Iowa City, filed the lawsuit against The Multi-State Lottery Association after security boss Eddie Tipton installed cheating software.</p>
      <p>That allowed Tipton to find out certain winning number combinations ahead of time – including the $16.5 million up for grabs the week before Dawson won in December 2010.</p>
      <p>Tipton worked with his brother and others to buy <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/tickets/">tickets</a> and scoop the sums, with the fraudster jailed for up to 25 years in 2017.</p>
      <p>Dawson, 66, argued that that cash could have rolled over into his week had Tipton not stolen it, meaning he was deprived of a far bigger win.</p>

      <p>He sued for the lump sum he could have gotten after tax had the $16.5 million been added to his prize pot.</p>

      <p>Dawson took home $6 million after tax on the $9 million lump sum.</p>
      <p>He has now settled for an undisclosed sum, with all details of the settlement withheld.</p>
      <p>Iowa Lottery’s previous CEO Terry Rich tried defending the lawsuit by claiming Dawson wanted to ‘rewrite history.’</p>
      <p>He said there was no way of knowing whether someone else could have theoretically chosen to pick the winning numbers the week of Tipton’s fraud</p>
      <p>Tipton’s fraud unraveled thanks to his own stupidity, after he bought the $16.5 million winning ticket at a gas station close to lottery headquarters.</p>
      <p>He passed the ticket to associates, but the Iowa Lottery failed to pay out after lawyers representing a trust refused to identify the purchase.</p>
      <p>Surveillance footage of the winning ticket being bought was then released, with Tipton’s colleagues stunned to realize that he was the buyer.</p>
      <p>The cash fraudulently won by Tipton was later returned to the 16 states that participate in the multi-state contest.</p>
