      <h1>Falcon &amp; Winter Soldier Set Photos May Spoil Another Marvel Hero's MCU Debut</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T18:11:38+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 18:11</time> by <a rel="author">Berek Bigos</a></address>
      <p>With production in full-swing for Marvel Studios' first Disney+ series, <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/falcon-and-winter-soldier/"><i>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</i></a>, some recently leaked set photos may have spoiled the series' introduction of Battlestar (aka Lemar Hoskins).</p>
      <p>Originally released by <a href="https://www.murphysmultiverse.com/exclusive-the-falcon-and-the-winter-solider-will-introduce-lemar-hoskins-battlestar-to-the-marvel-cinematic-universe/">Murphy's Multiverse</a>, the most notable inclusion from the alleged set photos is the name "Hoskin's Family Flowers" shown plastered on the outside of a store window and on the side of a car. Aside from these two examples, the remaining images don't seem to contain any other direct relation to Battlestar or Lemar Hoskins.</p>

      <p>Battlestar made his debut in <i>Captain America </i>#323 in November 1986. He got his powers from the same experiments as John Walker, aka U.S. Agent, who will be played by <a href="https://www.cbr.com/falcon-winter-soldier-us-agent-sharon-carter/">Wyatt Russell</a> in the series. In the comics, while Walker wore the mantle of Captain America, Hoskins took over the title of Bucky. However, he eventually changed it to Battlestar. He has fought alongside Steve Rogers and Falcon.</p>
      <p>Battlestar's debut has not been confirmed or teased, and the inclusion of Battlestar's last name could just be a simple easter egg for Captain America fans. In the past, Marvel Studios has shown a tendency to subtly reference characters from the comics without the audience actually seeing them on-screen (such as Adam Warlock in <i>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2</i>).</p>
      <p>Directed by Kari Skogland, <i><a href="https://screenrant.com/falcon-winter-soldier-tv-series-release-date-cast-story/">The Falcon and The Winter Soldier</a></i> stars Anthony Mackie, Sebastian Stan, Emily VanCamp, Wyatt Russell and Daniel Brühl and will be available on Disney+ in fall 2020.</p>
