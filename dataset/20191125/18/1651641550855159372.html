        <b>The second chapter of Square Enix’s Final Fantasy 7 redux, which we’re calling Final Fantasy 7 Remake: Part 2, is currently in active development.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://square-enix-games.com/en_GB/news/final-fantasy-vii-remake-developers">Announced alongside a host of new screenshots</a> for the upcoming first chapter of the long-awaited remake, director Tetsuya Nomura announced that the next part is already being worked on.</p>
      <p>Nomura explained that the developer isn’t going to create a shorter experience by splitting the game into parts. Instead, Nomura claims that the games are “growing considerably”.</p>
      <p>“Opportunities for discussing our true intentions are few, but with regard to the size of the game that many are asking about – there’s no reason at all to worry,” Nomura said. “Even in this Midgar portion alone, the density and volume are so great that I had to give directions to lighten them.</p>
      <p>With regard to new characters, of whom I said during past interviews that there would be ‘none’ – though they aren’t main characters, their numbers ended up growing considerably in the process of creating a rich depiction of Midgar. When you think of Midgar’s final boss, you probably think of the M.O.T.O.R., but in this game new bosses will appear and add to the excitement of the story even more.</p>

      <p>We’ve already begun working on the next one as well, but I’m confident that playing through this title will expand your expectations just like the world that extends beyond Midgar.”</p>
      <p>In the same blog post, story and scenario screenwriter Kazushige Nojima worries that some fans may be upset about the changes to character designs.</p>

      <p>“The original game used cartoon-like, stylised art, and the story was completed by players using their imagination to supplement portions that couldn’t be depicted as a result. Even if they were seeing the same scene, the information they took away from it and how they interpreted it differed depending on the viewer. Perhaps it’s what might be considered a narrative form of storytelling nowadays.</p>
      <p>“In Final Fantasy VII Remake, there will be much less room for player imagination. This fact will probably change the feel of the story considerably. People who know the original might not know quite how to take it. Such is the fear that I have. But I also have conviction. It should be possible to feel a much deeper connection to Cloud as you join alongside him.”</p>
      <p>While Square Enix is working on Final Fantasy, <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/new-kingdom-hearts-game-is-currently-in-the-hiring-process/">the Japanese developer is also working on the next Kingdom Hearts title</a>. With <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/every-kingdom-hearts-game-is-coming-to-xbox-one/">every Kingdom Hearts game</a> (and <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/heres-everything-that-was-announced-at-x019/">Final Fantasy game</a>) coming to Xbox One, hopefully Square Enix will also bring Final Fantasy 7 Remake to the system.</p>
