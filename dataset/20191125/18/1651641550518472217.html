      <h1>Facebook Gaming snaps up streamer Disguised Toast</h1>

        <b>In the latest instalment of gamers leaving Twitch to stream elsewhere, popular streamer Jeremy “Disguised Toast” Wang has announced that he will now stream exclusively with <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/a-facebook-gaming-tab-is-coming-to-the-official-app/">Facebook Gaming</a>.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Wang announced the news on Twitter with a short video, not dissimilar to how <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/faze-ewok-has-joined-mixer/">FaZe Ewok announced her move to Mixer</a>.</p>
      <p>Along with announcing his move to Facebook’s gaming platform, Wang also says that he donated the $20,000 production budget cheque to the Children’s Hospital of Los Angeles.</p>
      <p>Wang says that he’s moved to Facebook Gaming in order to “reach more people around the world, continue to give back, and lose bets to [Facebook] chat.”</p>

      <p>One of the biggest pros of Facebook Gaming is that viewers have no alias to hide behind, unlike on platforms such as Twitch, YouTube, and Mixer where people sign up with nicknames.</p>
      <p>Facebook Gaming requires people to use their Facebook accounts, which show their full names, in order to follow and comment in chat, meaning people might hopefully think twice about what they comment.</p>
      <p>While Facebook’s platform definitely isn’t as large or well known as Twitch, YouTube, or even Mixer, it’s still a growing platform and Disguised Toast has a decent audience, with over 243,000+ followers on Twitter alone.</p>
      <p>The company’s acquisition of the streamer should see the platform getting more time in the limelight in the future. Whether Facebook Gaming will manage to grow into a platform that’s capable of competing with the likes of the more popular streaming platforms is another question entirely.</p>
