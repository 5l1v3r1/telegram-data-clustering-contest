      <p>Aoibhin Garrihy and her husband John Burke have welcomed their second child.</p>
      <p>The former Fair City star gave birth to a baby girl at the University Hospital in Galway, after going into labour early.</p>
      <p>Posting a photo of tiny baby shoes on Instagram, the new mum-of-two wrote: “What a crazy 24 hours it’s been…one minute you’re painting your nails with notions of an awards night, the next you’re on the labour ward at 2am…”</p>
      <p>”The result? The ULTIMATE reward, a perfect little sister for Hanorah, another beautiful Burke baby girl arrived today at 12:36pm and we are simply in love ❤️.”</p>
