      <p>Smartphones are such an important part of our lives nowadays, but spending so much time with our faces glued to the small display can impact our health in the long run. If your hands are aching from holding your smartphone for far too long, perhaps the new CLCKR Universal Grip is what you need. Providing a firm but comfy handle to hold as well as bringing hands-free viewing without the need for a bulky flip case, the CLCKR fits on most smartphones and folds down flat when not in use.</p>

      <p>Capable of holding the phone in landscape or portrait in hands-free mode, the CLCKR grip also takes the strain off holding the phone in your hand. The 3M adhesive ensures that the CLCKR grip can be removed from the device without leaving any residue and is said to be compatible with wireless charging. The CLCKR is available in two sizes so it should fit almost any smartphone you might think of and it can be had in Black, Silver, Neon Yellow, Neon Pink, Gold AOP, Rose Gold, and Holographic colors among others.</p>
      <p>The CLCKR Universal Grip is available directly from CLCKR and Amazon for $14.99.</p>
