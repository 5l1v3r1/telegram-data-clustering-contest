      <h1>Directors of Diablo IV are talking about a darker open-world Diablo</h1>

      <p><i>Diablo IV</i> Game Director Luis Barriga and Art Director John Mueller have recently given an interview to Game Informer. They spoke about making a darker <i>Diablo</i>, which sounds like it was a unanimous decision within the studio.</p>
      <p>They were trying to push the darker tones since <i>Reaper of Souls</i> and now with their new engine they get the chance to reset the canvas a little bit, giving us a dark graphic and evil <i>Diablo</i>.</p>
      <p>They are trying to take all the individual strengths of each <i>Diablo</i> and craft a game that is embracing of what was good in previous installments. They are trying to make the world look handcrafted, like a painting, but darker.</p>
      <p><i>Reaper of Souls</i> and adventure mode were the catalyst for the studio to go open-world. Opening the game from the start and giving the players the option to do whatever they want, is something they are really excited about.</p>
      <p>You can watch the full interview below.</p>
