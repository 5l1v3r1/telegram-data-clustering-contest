      <h1>CNN's John King responds to Nunes 'corrupt' media remark: 'Horseshit'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T18:24:51+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 18:24</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thehill.com/author/rebecca-klar" target="_blank">Rebecca Klar</a></address>
      <p>CNN’s <a href="https://thehill.com/person/john-king">John King</a> on Monday dismissed Rep. <a href="https://thehill.com/people/devin-nunes">Devin Nunes</a>’s (R-Calif.) remark that he can’t answer questions over his alleged meeting with a former Ukrainian prosecutor because the media is “corrupt.”</p>
      <p>“Forgive me, but horseshit,” King said, after playing a clip of Nunes speaking to <a href="https://thehill.com/people/maria-bartiromo">Maria Bartiromo</a> on Fox News’s “Sunday Morning Futures.” </p>
      <p>A spokesperson for Nunes was not immediately available to comment on King's remarks. </p>
      <p>Nunes told Bartiromo that he “really want[s]” to answer questions over the allegations, and promised to “come back on the show and answer.”</p>
      <p>But, he added, he “can’t compete by trying to debate this out with the public media when 90 percent of the media are totally corrupt.”</p>
      <p>During the same interview, Nunes also <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/house/471838-nunes-threatens-to-take-cnn-daily-beast-to-court">threatened</a> to take CNN and The Daily Beast to court over reports about Nunes’s alleged meeting with a Ukrainian prosecutor in Vienna. </p>
      <p>The outlets reported that an attorney for indicted <a href="https://thehill.com/people/rudy-giuliani">Rudy Giuliani</a> associate Lev Parnas said Parnas had knowledge about a meeting between Nunes and ousted Ukrainian Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin last year. </p>
      <p>The reports indicate that Nunes, the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, may have been involved with efforts to investigate former Vice President <a href="https://thehill.com/people/joe-biden">Joe Biden</a>. </p>
      <p>A request by <a href="https://thehill.com/people/donald-trump">President Trump</a> for Ukraine to investigate Biden is at the center of the House impeachment inquiry.  </p>
      <p>Nunes has vehemently defended Trump’s actions during the impeachment hearings.</p>
