      <p>Aoibhin and hotelier husband John Burke, are already parents to adorable daughter, Hanorah, the popular couple are looking forward to expanding their family.</p>
      <p>She admitted it will be a busy household when they become a family of four, and feels lucky to have help at home.</p>
      <p>"I feel blessed and very lucky [to be expecting again], but a little bit petrified as well and that is where nana's come in. And we are very lucky to have them as well," the former <a href="https://www.rsvplive.ie/all-about/fair-city">Fair City</a> actress previously told us.</p>

      <p>"Hanorah is a pure rogue; she is just like Doireann [Aoibhin's sister] which I am very worried about. She is full of craic and she makes us laugh every single day."</p>
      <p>Speaking about getting the discipline right with a toddler, Aoibhin joked: "Where do you get tips on that because she is ruling the roost.</p>
      <p>"Hanorah is not taking me seriously and it is becoming a real stress because she just laughs when I reprimand her, it is a disaster.</p>
      <p>"She is all fun and games at the moment but we will get there."</p>
