      <p><b>DAYTON, Ohio (AP)</b> - An Ohio nonprofit has approved the disbursement of $3.8 million to victims of the August mass shooting in Dayton.</p>
      <p>The Community Oversight Committee chose 47 applicants to receive a charitable gift from the Dayton Oregon District Tragedy Fund. </p>
      <p>Seventy percent of the money raised is being distributed to families of deceased victims, with the remaining funds divided among hospitalized victims based on severity of injury.  </p>
      <p>Dayton Daily News reports that the family of the shooter, Connor Betts, will be among those receiving a charitable gift, because their daughter Megan was among the nine people killed in the Aug. 4 mass shooting in the city's Oregon District. </p>
