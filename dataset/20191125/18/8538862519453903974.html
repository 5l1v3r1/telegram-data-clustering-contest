      <p>Santa Monica Studio, the developer behind PlayStation 4's excellent <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/god_of_war">God of War</a>, is opening up even more about how the game was made. After creating a <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/news/2019/05/raising_kratos_the_god_of_war_ps4_documentary_is_available_to_watch_now_on_youtube">two-hour behind the scenes documentary</a> earlier this year (which is well worth watching), members of the team have gathered to talk shop in a new podcast mini series. It's called Worlds Collide, and the first episode is available on iTunes, Spotify, and Google Play. Conveniently, it's also been uploaded to YouTube, and you can check it out above.</p>
      <p>Anyway, the first episode focuses on crafting the game's side quests, and you can listen to three key staff members discussing how they made it so these optional activities could be tackled in any order and at any time. If you've any interest in how big budget games are made, this is worth a listen.</p>
      <p>It seems there will be at least a couple more of these releasing weekly, so there's plenty to look forward to as well. What do you think of this new podcast from Santa Monica Studio? Do you want to see more developers open up about how they make their games? Tune into the comments below.</p>
