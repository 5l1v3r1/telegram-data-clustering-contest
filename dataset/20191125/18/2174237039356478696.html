      <p>"That’s because, while Bose has done a tremendous job working out its  noise cancelation algorithm over the years, Sony has spent that time perfecting audio playback while simultaneously creating an adaptability algorithm that doesn’t just create a single sterile sound barrier, but multiple kinds that can adapt to whatever situation you’re in."</p>
      <p>As well as industry-leading noise-cancellation and Bluetooth and NFC pairing, these over the ear headphones come equipped with built-in Amazon Alexa, smart listening (allowing you to customise your noise cancelling experience), voice assistant, hi-res audio capability and 30 hours of play time.</p>
