      <p><b>KNOXVILLE, Tenn (WVLT) --</b> Three UT faculty members will work with a group of Knoxville homeowners to install rain gardens in an effort to enhance local conservation efforts.</p>
      <p>The rain gardens will be installed in the Edgewood Park neighborhood and help residents who live in flood-prone areas of the city.</p>
      <p>Lisa Reyes Mason, associate professor and Ph.D. program director in the College of Social Work; Jon Hathaway, associate professor of civil and environmental engineering; and Andrea Ludwig, associate professor of ecological engineering, are overseeing the rain garden project.</p>
      <p>To fund the project the group received a $7,000 grant from the Alliance of Women Philanthropists and $1,000 from UT's Office of Community Engagement and Outreach.</p>
      <p>Mason said funding will pay for 10 gardens and residents will be responsible for their garden's upkeep once it's installed.</p>
      <p>“Rain gardens are a form of green infrastructure increasingly used to sustainably manage urban stormwater,” Mason said. “In residential areas, rain gardens fed by a home’s downspout can reduce water damage on the homeowner’s property, enhance the quality of life through improved green space, and contribute to overall watershed health through reduced stormwater runoff.”</p>
      <p>Rain gardens have become increasingly popular, but are often not readily available in urban areas.</p>
      <p>The Hydrolunteers, a group of graduate students mentored by Hathaway and Ludwig who volunteer on water-related projects, created the concept for the garden and pitched it to Knox County and Knox County water officials.</p>
      <p>After the project was approved Faculty, student volunteers, neighborhood residents and county employees began working on a demonstration garden at the North Knoxville Branch of the Knox County Library in the heart of the Edgewood Park neighborhood.</p>
      <p>Interested homeowners can apply to have a rain garden built on their property. To be eligible, applicants must be homeowners in Edgewood Park, at least 18-years-old and their property must be suitable for a garden.</p>
      <p>Construction of the gardens is likely to begin this fall and continue through next spring.</p>
