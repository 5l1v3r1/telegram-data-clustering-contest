      <p>The Portuguese tactician got his Tottenham Hotspur career off to a winning start after <a href="https://www.soccerladuma.co.za/news/articles/international/categories/english-premier-league/english-premier-league-report-west-ham-united-v-tottenham-hotspur-23-november-2019/668040">beating West Ham United 3-2</a> on Saturday.</p>
      <p>He <a href="https://www.soccerladuma.co.za/news/articles/international/categories/english-premier-league/breaking-tottenham-hotspur-appoint-jose-mourinho/667797">had taken over the London club's hot seat from Mauricio Pochettino</a>, who was sacked last week Tuesday after Spurs fell to 14th on the Premier League log.</p>

      <p>During the Lilywhites' win on Saturday, though, they concede two late goals, proving some of the shortcomings in Mourinho's new squad.</p>
      <p>As a consequence, the 56-year-old wants to invest in the upcoming two transfer windows, and has reportedly handed chairman Levy a transfer wish list, according to the<i> Daily Mirror</i>.</p>
      <p>Benfica centre-back Ruben Dias is said to be one of Mourinho's priority targets, while attacking midfielder Bruno Fernandes is also reportedly on the list.</p>
      <p>In addition, Nemanja Matic's name has been mentioned, with the Manchester United midfielder falling down the pecking order under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.</p>
