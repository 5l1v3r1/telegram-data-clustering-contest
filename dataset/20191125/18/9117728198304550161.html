        <b>Six-time F1 champion <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/lewis-hamilton">Lewis Hamilton</a> has opened up about how he wants to use his platform as a superstar athlete to have a <i>"positive impact" </i>on the people who look up to him, as the Brit's idol Ayrton Senna did back in his day.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Hamilton has become one of the world's most well-known household names because of his domination in the world of Formula 1, as well as his ventures outside of the sport.</p>

      <p>He has been a strong advocate for causes like veganism and reducing use of plastic, as he explains he's trying to be like legendary F1 driver Ayrton Senna, a devoted Catholic who gave a lot of money away to charities, particularly in his home country Brazil.</p>
      <p><i>"I am trying to have a positive impact," </i>the 34-year-old told <i>PA Media</i>.</p>

        <i>"I looked at Ayrton Senna. He was a star in the sky and I want to somehow get up there. </i>
        <i>It is important to find people like that and that is what I am trying to be."</i>
      </p>
      <p>In 2019, Hamilton became the second driver in F1 history after Michael Schumacher to win six titles, with the German alone at the top with seven. While Hamilton could be well on his way to beat <i>der Rekordmeister</i>'s record, he is just as concerned about using his platform the right way rather than just focussing on driving.</p>
      <p>
        <i>"It is always really important to stay true to your core values, and I am really fortunate that I have this amazing platform, that I never thought I would have. I am trying to be the best person I can."</i>
