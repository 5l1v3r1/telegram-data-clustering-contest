      <p><b>TBILISI, GeorgiaÂ (AP)</b> - Thousands of people are demonstrating in front of parliament in the country of Georgia, demanding that the government steps down and early elections be held.</p>
      <p>Monday's demonstration in the capital, Tbilisi, was the latest in a series of protests set off by the parliament's failure to pass an elections-reform measure promised by the governing party.</p>
      <p>That measure would have changed the country's parliamentary elections so that all seats would be allocated according to the proportion of votes received by a party.</p>
      <p>Opponents of the governing Georgian Dream party say the current system in which about half the seats are single constituencies gives the party disproportionately strong representation.</p>
      <p>Demonstrators plan to try to block the entrances to parliament on Tuesday, when it is to hold a session.</p>
