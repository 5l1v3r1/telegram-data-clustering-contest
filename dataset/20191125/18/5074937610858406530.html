      <p>Accra, Nov. 25, GNA - Ghanaian boxer Razak Nettey (22-2, 16 KO's) is confident of a knockout when takes on Scottish boxer Nathan Beattie (13-4, 9Ko’s) in his first international bout.</p>
      <p>Nettey, would be looking to make an impressive debut on the international stage when he makes a ring appearance at a Championship Boxing Night dubbed ''Knockout Christmas Cracker'' slated for December 14, at the Northern Hotel in Aberdeen, United Kingdom.</p>
      <p>Ahead of the Super Lightweight contest, Nettey has vowed to knockdown the 29-year-old Scottish counterpart and hoped it would pave way for him to compete for world titles in the near future.</p>
      <p>I'm ready for the bout, I would not let this opportunity slip and I assure Ghanaian boxing fans of victory. My opponent is a good boxer but the bout would not travel the entire distance and I would surely knock him down,'' he said in an interview,</p>
      <p>Nettey was optimistic about winning world and commonwealth titles for Ghana in the future and believes the bout offers him the opportunity to prove his worth not to only Ghanaians but the entire boxing world fraternity.</p>
