      <h1>Paul Finebaum Has Brutally Honest Assessment Of Tom Herman</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T18:35:10+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 18:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/alekarend" target="_blank">Alek Arend</a></address>
      <p>There’s no question Texas has been one of the most disappointing teams of this college football season. The Longhorns fell to 6-5 on Saturday after a 24-10 loss to the Baylor Bears.</p>
      <p>When Tom Herman was hired, excitement finally made its way back to Austin. National championship aspirations seemed to become realistic. But here Texas stands, just six wins with a staggering five losses through 11 games.</p>
      <p>As a result, Herman has been a hot topic this week as plenty of national analysts are dishing out some harsh criticism.</p>
      <p>ESPN’s Paul Finebaum is the latest to weigh in on the Texas head coach.</p>
      <blockquote>“There’s no sugarcoating it,” Finebaum said on WJOX today, via <a href="https://247sports.com/Article/Tom-Herman-failure-at-Texas-says-Paul-Finebaum-Longhorns-Big-12-139195133/">247Sports</a>. “Tom Herman has been an abject failure at Texas. That surprises me and many other people because I believed in this guy. I knew him when he was Urban’s offensive coordinator. I thought he was one of the smartest coaches around. Either he has failed doing the things you have to do or Texas is beyond salvage.”</blockquote>
      <p>Yikes. Is Herman really an “abject failure” just three years into the job? That may be too soon to make that sort of declaration. So far, though, it’s tough to argue against it.</p>
      <p>But Herman has to get things going or he could be on the hot seat next season. Texas needs to regain some momentum this Saturday against Texas Tech or else it could be an ugly finish to the season.</p>
