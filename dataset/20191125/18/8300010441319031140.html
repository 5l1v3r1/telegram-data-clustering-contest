      <p>SOUTH AFRICA -- A dog and a baby giraffe became unlikely friends at The Rhino Orphanage in Limpopo Province, South Africa.<br/><br/>The baby giraffe was found in a comatose state after being abandoned by his mother<br/><br/>Jazz, who was just 2 days old when he arrived at orphanage, was rescued after being discovered by a farmer.<br/><br/>"They brought in this little giraffe, he was about 2 days old when he came in. He was very weak, his mother had left him alone, so we had to put him onto IV fluids and yes he is doing a lot better now," said orphanage caretaker, Janie Van Heerden. "Hunter's 'human' rescued Jazz and has been nursing him back to health all under Hunter's watchful eye."<br/><br/>Van Heerdan says Jazz was put on IV fluids to build up his strength and is now recovering under the watchful eye of his friend and protector, Hunter the dog.<br/><br/>Jazz is doing much better and will likely be released back into the wild very soon.</p>
