      <p>Felicity Huffman brought treats in the form of cupcakes as she arrived for community service yesterday.</p>
      <p>The Desperate Housewives star is working with The Teen Project in LA, after the fallout from the college admissions bribery scandal.</p>
      <p>The actress has already served 11 days of a 14-day prison sentence for her part in the conspiracy.</p>
      <p>She now has to complete 250 days of community service.</p>
      <p>The Teen Project is a treatment centre helping to rehabilitate young women at risk of sex trafficking and homelessness.</p>
      <p>Felicity pleaded guilty to conspiracy and fraud during a court appearance in May.</p>
      <p>After her sentencing in September, Felicity said in a statement that she accepted the verdict ‘without reservation’.</p>

      <p>She added: ‘There no excuses or justifications for my actions. Period.’</p>
      <p>The star is reported to have paid $15,000 (£11,600) to have her daughter’s college entrance exams doctored.</p>

      <p>As well as the long-running smash hit show Desperate Housewives, which costarred Teri Hatcher, Eva Longoria and Marcia Cross, Felicity is known for appearances in Get Shorty and Frasier.</p>
      <p>She even received a nomination for a best actress Oscar in 2006 for Transamerica.</p>

      <p>Along with husband William H. Macy, she is a parent to two daughters: Sophia Grace, 19, and 17-year-old Georgia.</p>
      <p>William, who is also a famous actor, has starred in films like Fargo, Boogie Nights and Jurassic Park 3.</p>
      <p>Two more famous names caught up in the scandal – Fuller House star Lori Loughlin and her husband, fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli – have pleaded not guilty to every charge given to them, and were last month given an additional bribery charge.</p>
      <p>If found guilty, Lori could serve up to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/23/lori-loughlin-break-faces-additional-charge-college-admissions-scandal-10967462/">50 years in jail</a>, with her trial expected to play out in the coming months.</p>
