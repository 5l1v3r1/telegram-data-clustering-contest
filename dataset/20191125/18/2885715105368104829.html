      <p>Pakistan plans to test a Hydrogen bomb device by next April in spite of the American leaders’ appeal to General Ziaul Haq not to do so, according to the Sunday Times. The Times said that the claim that Pakistan may be just a few months away from the test was made to it by a high-level military source from Islamabad. The paper said evidence about a secret operation by Pakistan in three countries to acquire the necessary nuclear material and know-how has been uncovered. The Americans had estimated that Pakistan was two to three years away from possessing a bomb. Now they say Pakistanis may explode it in the next three or four months.</p>

      <p>Congress President Devraj Urs wrote to Union Industries Minister Brahmananda Reddy, requesting him to clarify if the reports about him joining the Congress-I had any basis. According to a Congress source, Urs said in his letter that he would not like to “give credence” to the rumours and would be grateful if Reddy let him know his position.
