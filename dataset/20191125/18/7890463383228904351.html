      <h1>Zombies are coming to Red Dead Redemption 2 courtesy of this Undead Nightmare 2 mod</h1>

        <b>If navigating the old west in Red Dead Redemption 2 has become a tad humdrum for you, this new zombie mod should spice things up. Inspired by Undead Nightmare, the mod throws waves of the undead at Arthur Morgan, turning western adventure into an unending bad dream.</b>
      </p>
      <p>A 12-minute teaser of the content, viewable below, has been uploaded by Youtuber jedijosh920, showing the chaos the mod brings. Described as a “zombies minigame”, the living dead randomly spawn in various locations, and the player must fight for survival for as long as possible. Bedlam ensues quick wherever the shambling corpses emerge, horrifying screams filling the air as you try and blast your way through the rotting flesh to find safety.</p>
      <p>As a work in progress, it’s a bit rough around the edges, but there’s some enticing prospects in the video. Having to blast your way out of a small town that quickly becomes infest is in itself an alluring prospect, and anything that ends with making a mad dash to escape an oncoming horde will certainly make great fodder for streaming.</p>
      <p>Although Red Dead Redemption: Undead Nightmare was a success for Rockstar back in 2010, selling two million copies as a stand-alone disc, we’re unlikely to see an official follow-up. The company has moved away from substantial single-player DLC towards regularly updating Grand Theft Auto Online and, now, Red Dead Online. Thankfully, the modding community is here to pick up the slack.</p>
