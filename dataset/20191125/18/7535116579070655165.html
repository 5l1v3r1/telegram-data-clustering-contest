      <p>At minute 3:30, the guy walked into what looked like an apartment block and found a body laying on a bed outside. Before he approached the body, he was briefly consoled by the people there. As he quickly walked towards the corpse, he started wailing as he realised his dad, whom he wanted to surprise for Father’s Day, was lying lifeless on a bed. <i>Oh dear…</i></p>

        <i>We extend our condolences to the man in the video for losing his father; the only consolation we can give is that, perhaps, his father is in a better place now.</i>
