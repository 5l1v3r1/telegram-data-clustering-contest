      <p>Buhari rejoiced with the erudite scholar and diplomat for many years of service to the nation and strong representation at various multilateral institutions.</p>
      <p>He noted that Gambari had consistently taken up responsibilities to bridge relations, and bring peace and succour to nations and their citizens.</p>
