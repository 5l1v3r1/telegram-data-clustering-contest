      <p>Two Point Hospital was initially supposed to be released for console at the end of this year but was delayed until the first half of 2020 with Two Point Studios saying, "We have to take the game apart and figure out how to fit it into what is essentially a smaller box. That takes a fair amount of time and engineering work, and it turns out we need to take a little more to iron out the remaining creases."</p>
      <p>No solid release date was given only that the game would be coming to consoles in the first half of 2020. Now it looks like <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/two-point-hospital/9pkm0hk8hkfl?ocid=AID2000142_aff_7794_1246483&amp;tduid=(ir__zxwjwxlnqokfrlt1kk0sohz30m2xgcs9mamrxbuc00)(7794)(1246483)((027fc8854cc7532bceea28d4bfa71506)(266696)(1503186)(106992X1564213X81a8390f944beebbe175367289d51755)())(027fc8854cc7532bceea28d4bfa71506)&amp;irgwc=1&amp;irclickid=_zxwjwxlnqokfrlt1kk0sohz30m2xgcs9mamrxbuc00&amp;rtc=1&amp;activetab=pivot:overviewtab">we have a firm date</a> of February 25, next year.</p>

      <p>Two Point Hospital has been out on PC for some time now and has been described as the spiritual successor to Bullfrog's 1997 hit Theme Hospital. Players build and run their own hospitals, curing bizarre and unusual illnesses all while trying to improve their hospital's facilities and keeping it from going bankrupt. Currently sitting with a Metascore of 83, Two Point Hospital has been well received, with critics calling it darkly humorous, challenging, rewarding to play and a game deemed worthy of being called a spiritual successor to Theme Hospital.</p>
      <p>Included in the console release are the two expansions, "Bigfoot" and "Pebberley Island". Bigfoot has players dealing with a colder climate in three new hospitals and 34 new region-specific illnesses, while Pebberley Island sends players off on an adventure to the tropics where there are another three new hospitals and some exotic diseases to deal with.</p>
      <p>According to the developers, the game's controls have been completely re-worked for consoles. However, there has been no word on whether <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/keyboard-and-mouse-support/games">keyboard and mouse</a> will be supported. We also don't have any word on how much Two Point Hospital will cost.</p>
