      <h1>Antonio Valencia clears up Jose Mourinho Instagram bust-up at Man Utd</h1>
      <h2>Former Manchester United skipper Antonio Valencia liked a post calling for Jose Mourinho to be sacked at Old Trafford last season</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T18:02:32+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 18:02</time> by <a rel="author">Liam Prenderville, http://www.facebook.com/mirrorfootball</a></address>
      <p>Antonio Valencia has denied he clashed with Jose Mourinho in his final season at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> .</p>
      <p>Valencia, 34, left Old Trafford at the end of last season to secure a return to his native Ecuador with LDU Quito.</p>
      <p>The former Wigan man found opportunities limited in his final campaign due to injury problems, despite being named captain by Mourinho.</p>
      <p>Before the new <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> boss was sacked, Valencia liked an <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> post calling for his head.</p>
      <p>That led to suggestions he had been dropped over the social media antics but Valencia insists that wasn't the case.</p>

      <p>“OK, let’s clear it up. I made a mistake. I was on Instagram and I pressed the ‘like’ button on a comment by a fan. I never realised what it said," <a href="https://theathletic.com/1407997/2019/11/25/at-home-with-antonio-valencia-why-its-painful-to-watch-united-and-how-old-trafford-lost-fear-and-respect/?redirected=1">Valencia told the Athletic.</a></p>
      <p>Jose is a smart guy. It was nothing. I sought the manager out, I said sorry and end of story. He said, ‘No problem’. I didn’t play in the last few games for Jose but it was nothing to do with that. I had a series of calf injuries and it was affecting my performances. That’s why I was missing.”</p>
      <p>Valencia also paid tribute to Mourinho for handing him the armband during his time at Old Trafford.</p>

      <p>The Ecuadorian added: "He made me captain. I could not believe I was being given the chance to be captain of a club like Manchester United. I was incredibly happy to take that responsibility.</p>
      <p>"He’d ask me how I saw the group, how the players were feeling, if there was anything I felt the players needed. I answered honestly and we had a fantastic relationship.”</p>
      <p>Valencia admits he struggles to watch his former club but believes they 'will be back' under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.</p>
