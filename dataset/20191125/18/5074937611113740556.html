      <p>Accra, Nov. 25, GNA - The 18 Premier League clubs have been authorized to nominate five Premier League Management Committee Members for one year for the Ghana Football Association (GFA).</p>
      <p>As done previously by the GFA, the current administration has discarded the system where all Premier League clubs were represented on the Premier League Management Committee, formerly known as the Premier League Board.</p>
      <p>Under the new system, the GFA Executive Council would nominate two representatives, who would be the Chairman and the Vice Chairman, whilst the other five are nominated by the Premier League clubs. </p>
      <p>Meanwhile, former GFA Chairman, Mohamed Nuruuden D. Jawula and Jesse Agyapong have been appointed as the Chairman and Vice Chairman respectively to head the seven-member committee.</p>
