      <p>Photographer Pat Healy is recovering at home after suffering only minor injuries in a nasty incident at Navan on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Thatsy and Entoucas fought out a thrilling finish to the opening www.navanracecourse.ie Maiden Hurdle, with the pair coming close together on the run to the line after negotiating the final hurdle.</p>
      <p>While Thatsy just edged in front to win, Entoucas crashed through the inside railing just after the post – colliding with the photographer, who was stationed nearby.</p>

      <p>Healy was taken to Blanchardstown Hospital by ambulance for further examination, but was discharged on Sunday evening.</p>
      <p>His sister, Cathy, said: “He was back home in his own bed for 9pm last night – he wouldn’t stay in hospital any longer!</p>
      <p>“He’s not broken anything. He’s obviously bruised and sore, but it’s the best possible outcome from what was a bad situation.</p>
      <p>“It’s a miracle really and he’s already saying he’ll be back racing in Fairyhouse this weekend, but we’ll see.</p>
      <p>“There’s nothing wrong with his camera finger, thank God!”</p>
