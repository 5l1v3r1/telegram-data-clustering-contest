      <h3>Something to get us through to the New Year.</h3>
      <p>Ricky Gervais has confirmed when season 2 of After Life will drop on Netflix.</p>
      <p>If you haven't seen it, the show revolves around Tony (Gervais) and his seemingly perfect life. However, after his wife suddenly dies, Tony changes.</p>
      <p>After considering taking his own life, he decides instead to live long enough to punish the world by saying and doing whatever he likes from now on.</p>
      <p>He thinks it's like a super power - not caring about himself or anyone else - but it turns out to be tricky when everyone is trying to save the nice guy they used to know...</p>

      <p>On the Graham Norton Show, Gervais said;</p>
      <blockquote>"I've never had a reaction like it and with social media now, you hear about it. It has been overwhelming and it's the type of reaction as well. People have been coming up to me on the street and saying 'Oh, I lost my mum, or I lost my buddy'. I'm there thinking 'Oh my God, everyone is grieving',"</blockquote>
      <p>With filming now complete on the new episodes, Gervais said that he plans on releasing Season 2 of After Life in spring 2020.</p>
      <p>He continued;</p>
      <p>"That will be next spring. I'm editing now and I'll finish that after Christmas. Then it takes two months to put it into, like, 120 languages. That's why it takes so long."</p>
