      <p>New Zealand wrapped up an impressive innings and 65-run victory over England shortly after tea on the fifth day of the first test at Bay Oval on Monday with Neil Wagner running through the lower order.</p>
      <p>Wagner took three wickets in 17 balls for just one run as England collapsed from 132-5 to 138-8 before tea, then broke a 59-run ninth-wicket partnership between Jofra Archer and Sam Curran after they had threatened to thwart the hosts.</p>

      <p>The left armer then trapped Stuart Broad in front for a first ball duck to end England's resistance at 197 and end with figures of 5-44 from 19.2 overs.</p>
      <p>England had resumed on Monday on 55-3 and needing to bat the entire final day to stop New Zealand from taking a 1-0 lead into the second match of the two-test series that starts on Friday in Hamilton.</p>

      <p>England had looked well set to bat out the final two sessions having resumed after lunch on 98-4 with Joe Denly on 21 and Ben Stokes on 13.</p>
      <p>The pair safely negotiated the first 30 minutes but Stokes then played on for 28, letting out a loud yell of exasperation after chasing a wide, shortish ball from Tim Southee that he did not need to play at. His dismissal at 121-5 sparked a collapse, with Wagner at the heart of it.</p>
      <p>Denly fell for 35 when he was caught by wicketkeeper BJ Watling following a lifting delivery from the left armer.</p>
      <p>Ollie Pope also fell to Wagner, needlessly throwing his hands at a wide full toss only to watch the ball fly to a diving Mitchell Santner at short cover.</p>
      <p>With Trent Boult off the field with sore ribs, Wagner took the second new ball and bowled Jos Buttler for an 18-ball duck with a yorker with the first delivery.</p>
      <p>Joe Root was the only wicket to fall in the first session as his side dug in, with the England captain steering a lifting Colin de Grandhomme delivery to Tom Latham in the gully for 11.</p>
      <p>Santner had reduced England to 55-3 at the close of play on Sunday after taking three quick wickets in the final 30 minutes of play.</p>
