      <ul>
        <li>Selena Gomez performed “Lose You to Love Me” at the 2019 <a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/amas/">AMAs</a> last night, and it was not received well by some viewers.</li>
        <li>A source now says Selena had a panic attack before the show, which impacted her performance.</li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>The AMAs may have ended last night, but people are (unfortunately) still critiquing <a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a29932908/selena-gomez-off-key-amas/">Selena Gomez’s performance of “Lose You to Love Me.”</a> Why? Well, because some people online thought Selena was really off-key, and some went a step too far by joking about how the song’s lyrics literally say “sang off-key in my chorus.” The internet can be so mean!</p>
      <p>Selena’s fans chalked it all up to nerves, and as it turns out, they were pretty spot on. An <i><a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1096759/selena-gomez-had-a-panic-attack-before-her-2019-amas-performance">E! News</a></i> source came forward today and said Selena’s performance struggles last night happened because she had a bit of a breakdown before going onstage—poor Selena. 😓</p>
      <p>“Selena definitely had anxiety and a panic attack before she went out and was putting a lot of pressure on herself,” the source said.</p>

      <p>Sadly, this makes sense—the last time Selena performed at the American Music Awards was back in 2017, and this performance was her <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/selena-gomez-gives-first-live-tv-performance-in-2-years-at-amas-2019/">first televised appearance in two years</a>...so it’s not all that hard to understand why Selena would be a lil overwhelmed!</p>
      <p>After the performance, Selena hopped on Instagram to share <a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a29932552/selena-gomez-green-dress-amas/">pictures of her stunning Versace red-carpet look</a>, and she used it as an opportunity to share how she’s feeling at the moment. “Feels good to be back. Thank you to my entire team and to my fans that stand by me,” she captioned the post. “All of this is for you and because of you. excited for this chapter #sg2 @amas.”</p>
