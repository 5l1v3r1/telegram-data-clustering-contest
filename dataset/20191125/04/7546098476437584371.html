      <h1>Goldman Sachs tips ResMed share price as a buy</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T04:00:31+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 04:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fool.com.au/author/tmfdelboy/" target="_blank">Tom Richardson</a></address>
      <p><b>ResMed Inc.</b> <a href="https://www.fool.com.au/company/ResMed+Inc./?ticker=ASX-RMD">(ASX: RMD)</a> shares are marginally lower at $21.48 today, despite the research desk at investment bank Goldman Sachs tipping them as a buy.</p>
      <p>The analysts updated their numbers on the sleep therapy giant and reckon the shares have upside of around 11 per cent over the next 12 months. Goldman’s is forecasting three-year compound sales and earnings per share growth of 9% and 12% respectively.</p>
      <p>If delivered this would be reasonable performance for a business that has long-term growth potential thanks to its market-leading products and large unmet global addressable markets.</p>
      <p>Goldman’s cites the large markets, favourable pricing dynamics, and new product launches as among the factors influencing its favourable view.</p>
      <p>The analysts’ $24 price target is reached largely by using a multiple of 24.3x EBITDA to enterprise value over the next 12 months.</p>
      <p>The analysts have also slapped a buy rating on <b>CSL Limited</b> <a href="https://www.fool.com.au/company/CSL+Limited/?ticker=ASX-CSL">(ASX: CSL)</a>, but are a ‘sell’ rating on <b>Ramsay Healthcare Limited</b> <a href="https://www.fool.com.au/company/Ramsay+Healthcare+Limited/?ticker=ASX-RHC">(ASX: RHC)</a>.</p>
