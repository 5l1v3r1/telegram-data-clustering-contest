      <p><b>AOMORI — </b>Police in Hachinohe City, Aomori Prefecture, said Monday they have arrested a 59-year-old woman on suspicion of killing an 81-year-old woman last month.</p>
      <p>Police said the suspect, identified as Ryoko Kubota, is accused of strangling Shigeko Ohinata with a necktie, Sankei Shimbun. The body of Ohinata, who lived alone, was found by a friend at around 4 p.m. on Nov 2. She was lying inside by the entrance to the front door which was not locked.</p>
      <p>Police said an autopsy revealed Ohinata was choked to death and that she had been dead for several days. Investigators said there were no signs of a struggle. However, there was no money in Ohinata’s purse or handbag, leading police to believe robbery may have been a motive.</p>
      <p>Police did not say if Kubota, who also lives in Hachinohe, has admitted to the allegation or not. Police said she surfaced as a suspect after an analysis of street surveillance camera footage showed her outside the victim’s home.</p>
