      <p>Beaming <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/taylor-swift">Taylor Swift</a> is now the most decorated artist in American Music Awards history on a night where she claimed victory over her former record label.</p>
      <p>The megastar now has 29 awards to her name after collecting six gongs - overtaking legend Michael Jackson.</p>
      <p>She beat Billie Eilish and <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/ariana-grande">Ariana Grande</a> for Favorite Album: Pop/Rock for 'Lover' early on into the ceremony.</p>
      <p>That levelled things up with MJ but there was more to come.</p>
      <p>In the final moments of the show, she was also named Artist of the Year.</p>

      <p>It came as she belted out her hits amid a feud with her former management who she claimed tried to stop her performing the classics.</p>
      <p>The star did a medley of some of her biggest songs, including Love Story, I Knew You Were Trouble and Blank Space.</p>
      <p>Her fans screamed in support as she drew a line under the row with former manager Scooter Braun.</p>
      <p>Taylor and her ex-bosses have been at war over rights to her hits.</p>
      <p>The megastar accused her former label manager and a prominent music industry figure of "exercising tyrannical control" over her music.</p>

      <p>The 29-year-old Shake It Off singer had taken aim at Scooter and Scott Borchetta in a social media rant as her feud with them reached new heights - before they said there was no performance restrictions.</p>
      <p>Taylor toasted her fans as she was named artist of the decade, saying the honour celebrated ten years of "hard work and of art and of fun and memories".</p>
      <p>She added: "All that matters to me is the memories I have had with you guys, with you the fans, over the years.</p>

      <p>"We've had fun, incredible, exhilarating, extraordinary times together and may it continue. I am so lucky to get to do this."</p>
      <p>There had been fears she would be barred from playing tracks from her first six albums amid the row.</p>
      <p>Taylor was introduced by singer-songwriter Carole King, who said "her lyrics resonate across the generations, her songs touch everyone and her impact around the world is extraordinary".</p>
      <p>Last year, she broke the record for the most-awarded female artist with a grand total of 23 wins.</p>

      <p>Mark Bracco, Executive Vice Pesident of programming &amp; development at Dick Clark productions said: “Taylor’s impact on music this decade is undeniable and her performances on the American Music Awards have been truly spectacular.</p>
      <p>“We’re thrilled to honour her as our Artist of the Decade and can’t wait for her to blow everyone away with an epic, career-spanning performance unlike any other!”</p>
