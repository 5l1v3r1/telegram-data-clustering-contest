      <p>It's Monday, Nov., 25, 2019. Let's start here.</p>
      <p>
        <b>1. SEAL fight</b>
      </p>
      <p>Secretary of Defense Mark Esper <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/pentagon-chief-mark-esper-asks-navy-secretary-richard/story?id=67276450">forced out Navy Secretary Richard Spencer</a> Sunday for his handling of a case involving Chief Petty Officer Edward Gallagher, a Navy SEAL accused of war crimes in Iraq who was granted clemency by President Donald Trump.</p>
      <p>Esper was not aware Spencer had privately told White House officials that Gallagher would be allowed to keep his SEAL status if they did not intervene to stop a disciplinary proceeding, according to a statement from Chief Pentagon Spokesman Jonathan Hoffman.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>In a letter acknowledging his termination, Spencer said, "I have strived to ensure our proceedings are fair, transparent and consistent, from the newest recruit to the Flag and General Officer level," adding that he "cannot in good conscience obey an order I believe violates the sacred oath I took."</p>
      <p>On "Start Here" today, ABC News' Elizabeth McLaughlin breaks down the firestorm over the case and why Esper decided to let Gallagher retire as a Navy SEAL and keep his Trident pin.</p>
      <p>
        <b>2. Bloomberg on TV</b>
      </p>
      <p>Former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/nyc-mayor-michael-bloomberg-files-fec-run-president/story?id=67121273">has launched his bid</a> for the Democratic presidential nomination by spending $37 million on television advertising over the next two weeks, more than the entire field has spent on TV ads so far.</p>
      <p>"Think about the pace that that sets and what it says," ABC News Political Director Rick Klein tells the podcast. "Almost anywhere you're living in the United States, you'll have a good chance of seeing Michael Bloomberg on your TV set."</p>

        <b>3. K-pop concerns</b>
      </p>
      <p>The <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/pop-star-goo-hara-found-dead-seoul-home-67267782">death of a young K-pop star</a> over the weekend is raising questions about the pressures the artists face from South Korea's music industry and fans.</p>
      <p>"I do think it sort of speaks to a larger reflection of South Korean society," Billboard's Jeff Benjamin says. "Experts continue to point out that there's [a] lack of resources for people, not only celebrities, but just any people who are struggling with mental health, because it is still a taboo topic and something not really discussed larger in society in that way."</p>
