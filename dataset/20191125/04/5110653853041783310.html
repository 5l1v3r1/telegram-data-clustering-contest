      <h1>Week 13 Fantasy Rankings: Kicker</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T04:55:31+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 04:55</time> by <a rel="author">Billy Heyen</a></address>
      <p>The byes are officially over, and for the rest of the season, fantasy football owners will have a pool of 32 guys to choose fromevery week. Before we get any further, I must point your attention to Michael Badgley, Harrison Butker, Dan Bailey, and Zane Gonzalez. All four are coming off byes, so they were potentially dropped, and all four are in the top-10 in our Week 13 fantasy kicker rankings. It's worth checking to see if you can pick them up as free agents. Badgley, in Denver this week and an absolute stud, is even<i>nearly</i>worth a waiver claim.</p>
      <p>More on Gonzalez here, too. We ranked him near the bottom of this list all season, figuring that his past struggles would eventually show up. But they haven't. He's made 26-of-29 field-goal attempts this season, along with all but one of his extra points. That includes making both of his kicks from beyond 50 yards. Gonzalez made us buy in.</p>

      <p>Barring weather concerns, it's not really worth constantly streaming kickersbecause it's so random anyway. You might as well settle in with one for the rest of the season. Outside of the top 10, Ka'imi Fairbairn, Matt Gay and Younghoe Koo all have solid leg talent that will play in any stadium and at least manageable weather (although Fairbairn's struggles this season have been greater than expected, we still believe in the overall ability).</p>
      <p>I'm not sure what to make of Joey Slye's rough Week 12, but I'm sticking with my belief in him for another week.</p>

      <p>Other than that, enjoy the Thanksgiving football! Hopefully your kicker doesn't ruin the day by missing four field goals or anything terrible like that. The good news is all six kickers will be playing indoors, so if there are any weather worries for the weekend, you can always grab someone for Thursday. Four kickers in our top 12 play on turkey day, so they should be solid choices.</p>
