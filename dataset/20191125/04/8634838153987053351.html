      <p>"Let me finish the programme by paying tribute to a fallen colleague... On <i>Punchline</i> this week, we are deeply mourning the tragic death of a colleague and friend Daniel Chemjor.</p>
      <p>"Incidentally, on that same day that he was involved in that deadly accident, I was reminded of how I started from the very bottom of this industry and guess who started down there, down in the trenches of this business with me, it was Chemjor," stated Kiguta.</p>
      <p>"I remember the very day we met in the corridors of The Standard Group (pauses), his first day there about 30 years ago when we both began our television careers... Excuse me," continued the anchor.</p>
      <p>She further praised him of rising far above the fold and becoming one of the best news directors in the country.</p>
      <p>"Together we worked our way up to the top of this industry and he became one of the finest news directors in the business. We recollected here at Mediamax and Chemjor was part of the team that started this very programme," she added.</p>
      <p>She. however, expressed regret in showing the fallen news personality that he had achieved quite a feat.</p>
      <p>"My only regret is that we never really celebrated that after all the years of hardship that we faced together in this business, how hard we worked all these years, that we never got the chance to pat each other in the back and say to each other 'well done,'" she expressed.</p>
      <p>Various other <a href="https://www.kenyans.co.ke/news/46661-mediamax-mourns-departed-journalist">workers at the station also paid their touching tributes</a> to their fallen colleague.</p>
      <p>"I've lost a friend. Rest well Chemjor. Thank you for believing in me since I was an intern in 2010 and doing your job impeccably. An amazing news director you were," <b>Betty Kyalo</b> tweeted. </p>
      <p>"I have known Chemjor since way back in 2004 when we worked together at <i>KTN</i>. By then he used to produce a business show. I have watched him grow and progress over the years to his latest role where he was the head of news directors at Mediamax, and specifically <i>K24</i>.</p>
      <p>"He was such a humble, affable and dedicated team member whose contribution shall be sorely missed. My thoughts and prayers go out to his young family, especially his widow who gave birth to their last-born child just a few weeks ago," mourned <b>Peter Opondo</b>, Group Head of TV and Digital at the firm.</p>
