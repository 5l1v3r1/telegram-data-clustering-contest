      <p>Hometown boy Andrew Harris scored a pair of touchdowns and Justin Medlock booted six field goals to help give Winnipeg their first Grey Cup since 1990, ending the second-longest barren run in CFL history.</p>
      <p>Only the Toronto Argonauts, who went 30 years without a championship, had gone longer without winning the Cup.</p>
      <p>While the Blue Bombers celebrated, the dejected Tiger-Cats, who had top regular season record of 15-3, head home with their 20-year Grey Cup winless streak extending another season.</p>
      <p>Harris, who served a two-game suspension during the season for a positive drug test, walked away with both the most valuable player and outstanding Canadian awards after running for 134 yards on 18 carries.</p>
      <p>The 32-year-old running back took a moment during the celebrations to hit back at his critics, pointing to all the silverware that will soon be in his trophy case.</p>
      <p>“These two trophies and the one behind me (Grey Cup), that’s for all the haters who put me down, kicked me when I was down,” said Harris, who was three-years-old the last time Winnipeg won the Grey Cup.</p>
      <p>“I put a lot of pressure on myself in this game and I wanted to do something great, be part of something great and we did it.”</p>
      <p>The Tiger-Cats turned the ball over three times in the opening quarter and the Blue Bombers made them pay.</p>
      <p>After Hamilton quarterback Dane Evans fumbled deep in his own end Harris, the CFL’s rushing leader, rumbled the final 15-yards for the touchdown.</p>
      <p>Harris also hauled in an 18-yard pass for another touchdown while Medlock contributed a pair of field goals and another point off a missed attempt.</p>
      <p>The Tiger-Cats, the regular season’s highest scoring team, were held to just two Lirim Hajrullahu field goals as the Bombers went into the break with a 21-6 lead.</p>
      <p>Medlock added four second-half field goals while the Winnipeg Blue Bombers defense did the rest, neutralizing Hamilton’s high powered attack.</p>
      <p>Hamilton managed just a single touchdown, Evans connecting with Bralon Addison on a four-yard strike in the third quarter.</p>
