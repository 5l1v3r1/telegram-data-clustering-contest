      <p>A documentary on the life of Scots tennis star <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/elena-baltacha">Elena Baltacha</a> is set to be screened five years after her death aged 30.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/bbc">BBC Alba</a> film tells how Elena overcame illness to become one of the top 50 players in the world before dying of liver cancer.</p>
      <p>She had only been married to her tennis coach and partner, Niño Severino, for five months.</p>
      <p>After she died, Niño said his wife never complained, adding: “She said ‘please’ and ‘thank you’ to everybody, and treated everyone with respect. She always put my feelings before hers, never wanted me to be upset.</p>
      <p>“I loved her more than anything and she felt the same. We were just utterly devoted to each other.”</p>
      <p>Elena, who was born in the Ukraine but raised in Scotland, had sport in her blood. Her mum Olga represented the USSR as an athlete and her dad Sergei was a USSR international footballer.</p>
      <p>Elena realised a dream when she was selected for the GB team for the Olympic Games in London in 2012.</p>
      <p>The documentary contains photos of Elena as a girl on the court and emotional interviews with family and friends including her husband, dad, brother Sergei who was a Scotland U21 football international, her sister-in-law Rosie and coach<a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/judy-murray"> Judy Murray</a>.</p>
      <p>Writer, producer and director Margot McCuaig said: “Elena Baltacha didn’t just pursue her dreams she embodied them.</p>
      <p>“Her strength and resilience was manifested in the empowering manner in which she led both on and off the court.”</p>
