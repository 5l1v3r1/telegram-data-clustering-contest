      <p>I used to take a very long time to get ready. It wasn’t because it took me a long time to put my makeup on (I can do a fire cat eye in, like, 6.5 seconds, tyvm), it’s because I could never find the products I needed when I wanted to use them. I would spend literally forever searching for that perfect <a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/beauty/g25336112/best-lip-stain/">lip stain</a> or that one <a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/beauty/g8655202/best-highlighter-makeup-for-face/">highlighter</a> in my unorganized mess of products. It was a waste of time and low-key stressful. Then I discovered makeup organizers and my life was legit changed. <b>They help keep my collection organized, make sure that everything is in the right place, and look really good on my vanity too. </b>So instead of shoving all your makeup into Diptyque glasses like every other human on Instagram does, try out one of these makeup organizers below. You’ll never waste time looking for a product again.</p>
