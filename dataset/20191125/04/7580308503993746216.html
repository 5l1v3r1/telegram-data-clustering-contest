      <p>Following its plans to ban the single-use of plastic materials, the Federal Government has advised that a moratorium of 2024 be given to formulating policy guidelines on its implementation and management.</p>
      <p>In addition, there is the need to ensure that states adopt and implement provisions of the National Health Care Waste Management Policy and its guidelines so as to prevent healthcare waste challenges.</p>
      <p>These were contained in a communiqué of the 13th National Council on Environment (NCE), which also noted that the release of excess water in dams across the country causes excessive flood disasters for coastal communities in Nigeria.</p>
      <p>It, therefore, urged all relevant agencies to effectively manage and monitor the release of water to curb the adverse effects, adding that Warning Systems (FEWS) has been providing predictions in no fewer than 3,023 locations.</p>
      <p>The communiqué further stressed the need to promote de-silting and dredging of rivers to improve on their flood carrying capacity and ameliorate perennial flooding along the riverine communities.</p>
      <p>“The Ecological Funds Office (EFO) should support the Ministry of Environment to fund some major ecological remediation projects to collaborate with states on modalities towards the establishment of Renewable Energy Facilities,” it said.</p>
      <p>On 2019 National Forest Policy Documents, it said the document would be forwarded to the Federal Executive Council (FEC) for approval to provide a guide for Sustainable Forest Management in the country.</p>
