      <p>Before accepting the award, Swift performed a medley of some of her biggest songs, including Love Story, I Knew You Were Trouble and Blank Space.</p>
      <p>There had been fears she would be barred from playing tracks from her first six albums amid a row with her former record label.</p>
      <p>Swift was introduced by singer-songwriter Carole King, who said “her lyrics resonate across the generations, her songs touch everyone and her impact around the world is extraordinary”.</p>
      <p>After praising Swift’s influence over the last decade of popular music, King added: “The best is yet to come.”</p>
