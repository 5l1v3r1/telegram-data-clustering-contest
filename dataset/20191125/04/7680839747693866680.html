      <h1>From Amazon to GM, here are all the major tech and transportation companies who paid $0 in federal income taxes last year</h1>

        <li>These massive companies made millions – in some cases, billions – in profits in 2018, but didn’t pay a dime in federal income taxes.</li>
        <li>Tax cuts passed by the Trump administration in 2017 have made it much easier for the big corporations like <a href="https://businessinsider.com/category/amazon">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://businessinsider.com/category/ibm">IBM</a>, and <a href="https://businessinsider.com/category/netflix">Netflix</a> avoid paying income taxes.</li>
        <li>Most of the companies on this list earned tax rebates larger than their income tax, effectively seeing a negative tax rate.</li>

      <p>In theory, the US <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/how-does-corporate-income-tax-work">imposes</a> a 21% tax rate on corporations. In reality, the amount major corporations are paying is far lower.</p>
      <p><a href="https://businessinsider.com/category/amazon">Amazon</a>, for example, earned over $10 billion in income in 2018. But by taking advantage of tax credits, the company zeroed out its income taxes and earned a rebate of $129 million, according to <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000101872419000004/amzn-20181231x10k.htm#s3E4C8013ABC95E46A37AC9AF28873055">tax filings</a> published by the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
      <p>It has become much easier for massive corporations to avoid paying federal income tax in recent years. The <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tax-day-2019-trump-gop-tax-cut-law-still-not-popular-2019-4">2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act</a>, one of the most significant legislative achievements by Republicans and President Donald Trump since his election, opens new windows for tax rebates for major corporations.</p>
      <p>The Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a nonprofit think tank, analyzed SEC filings of Fortune 500 companies and <a href="https://itep.org/notadime/">identified 60 major corporations</a> that didn’t pay any federal income taxes in 2018. Of those, 11 do business in the tech or transportation industries.</p>
      <p>“These tax loopholes allow many profitable corporations to avoid paying a single dime in taxes, but it should also be noted that many other profitable corporations are also using these special breaks to pay far less than the 21 percent statutory federal income tax rate,” Matthew Gardner, a lead author of the ITEP report, wrote.</p>
      <p>Here are 11 massive tech and transportation companies that didn’t pay any federal income taxes last year – negative tax rates indicate that companies got more money back in rebates than they had to pay in taxes.</p>

      <p>In a statement to Business Insider, a spokesperson for Activision Blizzard emphasized that the company paid other taxes beyond the federal income tax, including state taxes.</p>
      <p>“We did not receive a tax refund in the U.S. for 2018. In fact, we paid approximately $100 million in U.S. federal and state income taxes based on our 2018 U.S. income,” the spokesperson said.</p>

      <p>An Amazon spokesperson noted that Amazon paid billions in taxes other than the federal income taxes, including state and local taxes, and added that Amazon has brought its total US workforce to more than 250,000.</p>
      <p>“Amazon pays all the taxes we are required to pay in the US and every country where we operate, including paying $2.6 billion in corporate tax and reporting $3.4 billion in tax expense over the last three years,” the spokesperson said. “Corporate tax is based on profits, not revenues, and our profits remain modest given retail is a highly competitive, low-margin business and our continued heavy investment.”</p>

      <p>*In its <a href="https://itep.org/notadime/">report</a>, the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy notes that some companies’ vague language in their 10-K annual financial filings makes it difficult to calculate the exact size of their rebates. ITEP notes that Salesforce disclosed $132 million in “tax credits,” but doesn’t go into more detail.</p>
