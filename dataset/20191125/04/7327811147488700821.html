      <p>LIVINGSTON, New Jersey (WABC) -- An entire school district in New Jersey announced it will have delayed openings on Monday due to a ransomware attack.</p>
      <p>Livingston Public Schools will have a two-hour delayed opening after servers were compromised by an outside entity, and were affected with ransomware. Livingston Public Schools Superintendent Matthew Block confirmed the attack Sunday.</p>
      <p>Block said that while the schools' data is not lost, it is inaccessible until they can resolve the situation.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, a team of technology professionals are working to fix the problem. Internet access, email and college transcripts are not affected.</p>
      <p>Opening times for Livingston Public Schools:</p>
      <p>- Livingston High School will open at 9:50 a.m.<br/>- Elementary schools will open at 10:05 a.m.<br/>- Heritage Middle School will open at 10:20 a.m.</p>
      <p>- Mt. Pleasant Middle School will open at 10:35 a.m.<br/>- The A.M. Session of PRIDE is canceled.</p>
      <p>A 7 p.m. meeting is also scheduled for Monday in the Livingston High School auditorium for parents to answer any questions.</p>
      <p>Superintendent Block says he believes the attack came from outside the Livingston and the Livingston Public Schools community.</p>
