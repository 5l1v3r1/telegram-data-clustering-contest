      <p>Prolific performances from <a href="https://www.india.com/topic/BJ-Watling">BJ Watling</a>, <a href="https://www.india.com/topic/Mitchell-Santner">Mitchell Santner</a> and Neil Wagner helped New Zealand clinch a thumping victory against England in the first Test of the two-match series on Monday.</p>
      <p>Resuming their second innings at 55/3, none of the England batters could stay long at the crease as they got bowled out 197 in the final session of Day Five at the Bay Oval and suffered a crushing defeat by an innings and 46 runs.</p>
      <p>Left-arm pacer Wagner, who had taken three wickets in the first innings, was the tormentor in chief in England’s second essay as he picked up a fifer, giving away 44 runs in his 19.3 overs.</p>
      <p>Joe Denly (35), Rory Burns (31) and Jofra Archer (30) were the only England batters who could stay for a while at the crease but their efforts couldn’t avoid the defeat.</p>
      <p>Archer, along with Sam Curran (29), did delay the win for the Black Caps. However, it was too much a task for the lower-order batters as the hosts took a 1-0 lead in the two-match series. Santner also took three wickets in the second innings.</p>
      <p>Earlier, New Zealand had posted a mammoth 615/9 declared in their first innings, riding on the double century from Watling and ton from Santner in reply to England’s 353.</p>
      <p>Watling, in fact, became the first New Zealand wicketkeeper to score a double hundred in Test cricket.</p>
      <p>The two teams will now face in the second and final Test beginning Friday at the Seddon Park in Hamilton. The two-Test series is not a part of the ICC World Test Championship and thus results will have no bearing on the points table.</p>
      <p><b>Brief scores:</b> England 353 and 197 (Joe Denly 35, Rory Burns 31, Neil Wagner 5/44); New Zealand 615/9 declared won by an innings and 46 runs.</p>
