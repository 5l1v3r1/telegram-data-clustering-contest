      <p>Moree TAFE nursing student Claudia Turner has recently returned from a once-in-a-lifetime trip to China, where she spent two weeks undertaking work experience.</p>
      <p>Claudia, who is currently undertaking her Diploma of Nursing through TAFE, was one of 17 students from across western NSW selected to take part in the Outbound Mobility Program which gives rural and remote students the opportunity to travel abroad to enhance their industry skills and knowledge.</p>
      <p>During the trip to China, from October 17 to November 3, the students toured and undertook clinical work experience at Shanghai's Renji Hospital - an experience Claudia said was a "once-in-a-lifetime" opportunity.</p>

      <p>"It was so good," Claudia said.</p>
      <p>"It was great because you had a better understanding of cultural aspects and you have to be a bit more patient; I really want to put it into my practice now.</p>
      <p>"It's changed me for the better. It was a life-changing experience."</p>
      <p>During the work experience, the students were split into groups and rotated between four units - cardiology, cardio intensive care unit, maternity and breast surgery.</p>
      <p>Claudia said she particularly enjoyed the maternity and breast surgery rounds.</p>
      <p>"Maternity was just amazing; my group didn't get to see a birth but I got to hold some brand new babies," she said.</p>
      <p>"Breast surgery was good too. We got to go into theatre and got to watch a lumpectomy and mastectomy."</p>
      <p>Claudia said she would love to be a maternity nurse one day, but is also considering paediatrics and ED - "I have so many I want to do - it's so hard to decide," she said.</p>
      <p>Although there was a "bit of a language barrier", Claudia said she learnt a lot during her time at Renji Hospital.</p>
      <p>"It was very different," she said.</p>
      <p>"The hospital was huge.</p>
      <p>"Healthcare is very different over there; you have to be able to afford it. There were a lot of people out the front of the hospital begging. It was awful.</p>
      <p>"I learnt heaps and different ways of doing things. The nurses are so beautiful over there. They're so passionate about their work and that's what I want to be. They all work as a team, as a family."</p>
      <p>TAFE NSW Health head teacher Maryann Chandler, who travelled to China with the students, said Claudia was the ideal student to participate in this life-changing trip.</p>
      <p>"Claudia is very talented, reliable and always eager to embrace new ways of learning," she said.</p>
      <p>"It was great for Claudia and all 17 students to be completely out of their comfort zones and broadening their horizons in China, and seeing how the skills they have learnt at TAFE NSW are recognised and can be used all around the world."</p>
      <p>"The opportunity for TAFE NSW students to travel overseas with unprecedented access to some of the largest global enterprises and businesses across Shanghai is testament to the commitment of Australia's leading training provider to provide access to practical, hands-on learning opportunities to students," TAFE NSW deputy regional general manager Adam Bennett added.</p>
      <p>The trip wasn't all about study though, with the students given the opportunity to travel and explore on the weekends, during which they visited Shanghai Disney Resort and Shanghai Circus World.</p>
      <p>It was Claudia's first overseas trip by herself and now she's ready for more adventures.</p>
      <p>"I made a lifetime of memories and friends for life," she said.</p>
      <p>"I've definitely caught the bug.</p>
      <p>"I've started thinking about where I want to go next. I would like to go to Thailand to help in an orphanage."</p>
