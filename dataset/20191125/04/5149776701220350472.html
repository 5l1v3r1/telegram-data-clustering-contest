      <h1>Derby County mocked as Leeds United boss hints at Nottingham Forest transfer business</h1>

      <h3>Leeds United boss drops hint</h3>
      <p>Jack Clarke appears to be firmly in Leeds United's plans this season after making his second League debut for the club yesterday.</p>
      <p>He made a 19-minute cameo for Marcelo Bielsa's side in a 2-1 win at Luton Town, a result that keeps his side firmly in the Championship promotion race.</p>
      <p>They sit in second place, on 34 points and three ahead of Preston North End in third.</p>
      <p>Clarke came through the Whites' academy and was sold to Tottenham Hotspur in the summer for around £10 million - but he was loaned back to Leeds for the whole of this season.</p>

      <h3>Derby County taunted</h3>
      <p>Preston North End fans delivered a short, but cutting, message to Derby County supporters yesterday.</p>
      <p>Alex Neil's side were visiting Pride Park for a Championship clash, which they lost 1-0 thanks to a first-half effort from Martyn Waghorn.</p>
      <p>It was Derby's first game since the defeat to Nottingham Forest before the international break, with that match also ending 1-0 <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/nottingham-forest-derby-live-grabban-3518586">with Lewis Grabban capitalising on a stray pass from Jayden Bogle</a> to make himself the hero in front of the Trent End.</p>
      <p>That was <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Forest</a> 's third consecutive win over Derby in all competitions and already their second this season after a 3-0 pasting of Phillip Cocu's side in the Carabao Cup second round tie at the City Ground in August.</p>

      <h3>How the opposition reported it</h3>
      <p>Nottingham Forest battled to earn a point in a goalless draw with Bristol City yesterday.</p>
      <p>Despite Ryan Yates being sent off 11 minutes into the second half, the Reds still picked up what could turn out to be a vital point in the Championship promotion race.</p>
      <p>Forest did have chances, though, with Yates himself having an effort cleared off the line and Joe Lolley testing Daniel Bentley in the hosts' goal.</p>
      <p>Lewis Grabban, too, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/bristol-city-nottingham-forest-championship-3572523">spurned a brilliant opportunity with 15 minutes to go</a> as Forest threatened to sneak a win in a second half that had turned into a defensive battle with the visitors hoping to earn a point.</p>
