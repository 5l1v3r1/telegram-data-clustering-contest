      <h1>Khloe Kardashian Shares Another Cryptic Quote Seemingly Aimed At Ex Tristan: ‘Disappointed But Not Surprised’</h1>

      <h4>Tristan Thompson seems to actively want to get back together with Khloe Kardashian, recently sending her a gigantic display for her new fragrance and leaving flirty comments on her Instagram.</h4>
      <p><a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/celeb/khloe-kardashian/"><b>Khloe Kardashian</b></a>, 35, is dropping hints that once again seem aimed at her ex <b>Tristan Thompson</b>, 28. The <i>Keeping Up With The Kardashians </i>star posted a series of quotes on her Instagram story on Sunday, Nov. 24, including one that read “‘Disappointed, but not surprised’ has been my biggest mood this year.” This is the <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2019/11/22/khloe-kardashian-seemingly-shades-tristan-thompson-instagram/">second message</a> that Khloe has posted in recent days that appears to be directed to Tristan, including one that read “My mother once told me: ‘Every time you forgive him, he will love you a little more, but you will stop loving him, so the day he loves you the most you will not feel anything for him anymore,’” on Nov. 22. Ouch!</p>
      <p>The most recent post seemingly makes reference to events that happened earlier this year, which eventually lead to Tristan and Khloe — who share 1-year-old daughter <b>True</b> — to split. Tristan was busted for inappropriately kissing <b>Kylie Jenner</b>‘s BFF <b>Jordyn Woods</b>, 22, at a house party back in March which led Khloe to leave him for good. The incident was the <i>second</i> time the NBA star was caught stopping out on his gorgeous ex in under a year, as he was seen motor boating a woman’s breasts on video while Khloe was pregnant — which is possibly where the “not surprised” component of the quote comes in.</p>
      <p>Recently, it seems like Tristan has regretted his choices and attempted to make amends. He pulled out all the stops for Khloe’s recent KKW Pink Diamond fragrance launch with <b>Kim Kardashian</b>, sending over a <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2019/11/09/khloe-kardashian-receives-balloons-tristan-thompson-fragrance-co-parenting-true-video/">gigantic balloon display</a> to congratulate her. “Today was the launch of my pink diamond collection with KKW Fragrance and I got these balloons sent to me from baby True and Tristan and I really appreciate the love and the thoughtfulness,” Khloe posted about the gesture. She also added that she’s “really proud at the co-parenting place that we are in,” making it pretty clear she’s not interested in rekindling their romance for a third time.</p>

      <p>The Cleveland Cavalier also made sure to <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2019/11/11/tristan-thompson-message-khloe-kardashian-peoples-choice-awards-wins-reaction/">publicly congratulate his ex</a> on her recent win at the <i>E! People’s Choice Awards </i>for Reality Star 2019, hinting that he still has feelings for her. “Wow wow wow @khloekardashian 👑👑 Congrats Momma Koko on winning best reality star 2019, that’s two years in a row. Two time champ. I love the sound of that,” he posted on Instagram. “So proud of all you have accomplished this year.”</p>
