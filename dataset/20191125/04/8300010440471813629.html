      <p>NEW YORK -- Michael Bloomberg is running for president.<br/><br/>The former New York City mayor, one of the richest men in the world, formally joined the Democratic presidential field on Sunday. The 77-year-old former Republican announced his plans on a campaign website.<br/><br/>He wrote: "I'm running for president to defeat Donald Trump and rebuild America."<br/><br/>Bloomberg's entrance, just 10 weeks before primary voting begins, reflects his concerns that the current slate of candidates is not well-positioned to defeat Trump.<br/><br/>Bloomberg's massive investments in Democratic priorities like climate change and gun control, backed by his extraordinary personal wealth, could make him a force. He's already reserved more than $30 million in television ads across several states, although he's bypassing the first four on the primary calendar.<br/><br/>----------<br/>*<b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrlIS7z20CnVaCrMvdkig_g"> Follow us on YouTube</a></b> <br/>* <b><a href="https://abc7ny.com/news/">More local news</a></b><br/>* <b><a href="https://7ny.tv/submitnewstip">Send us a news tip</a></b><br/>* <b><a href="https://abc7ny.com/apps/">Download the abc7NY app for breaking news alerts</a></b></p>
