      <h1>New detention policy in Delhi schools unlikely this year</h1>
      <h2>Earlier this year, the no-detention policy of the Right to Education Act (RTE), 2009, was amended through a parliamentary bill, stating that a child who fails a regular examination at the end of classes V and VIII will take a re-examination.</h2>

      <p>Delhi schools are yet to be notified of amendments in the no-detention policy, which were to be implemented in the 2019-2020 academic year. As a result, educationists believe it is too late in the day to enable schools to detain students in classes V and VIII this session.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, the no-detention policy of the Right to Education Act (RTE), 2009, was amended through a parliamentary bill, stating that a child who fails a regular examination at the end of classes V and VIII will take a re-examination. The relevant central or state governments were asked to decide if they will allow schools to detain children who fail the re-examination.</p>
      <p>Amendments in Delhi’s policy were cleared in August by the state government, allowing all government, MCD and private schools to hold back students in classes V and VIII if they are unable to clear the re-exam. However, implementation has been stalled.</p>
      <p>An education department official confirmed that the notification had been drafted by the department but is still being processed.</p>

      <h3>Assessment based on written test, extra-curriculars</h3>
      <p>The committee has recommended changing the assessment model so children are assessed on a variety of criteria apart from standard testing. This includes 15% for attendance; 10% for participation in co-curricular activities like dance, theatre, debates, sports, community service and Olympiads; and 5% based on the attendance of any one of the student’s guardians in PTMs. The 70% of assessment on the basis of testing is recommended to be broken into three parts — 10% based on minimum competency to be attained at primary and upper primary levels; 30% based on ‘generic assessment’ through questions on a passage, picture or diagram from each subject; and 30% based on standard subject-wise testing as is practiced in schools.</p>

      <p>“It has to be cleared by a number of different departments; at the moment, it is with the Delhi Law department. Our efforts are directed towards implementing it at the earliest,” said the official.</p>
      <p>However, another department official said: “It is too late in this year to introduce a change as momentous as this. This is something which needed to be done at the beginning of the academic year… At this stage, students cannot be told they might be detained in the final exams, which are a few months away.”</p>
      <p>Recommendations for changes in the policy had been made in March by a committee formed to help the Delhi government amend the Delhi Right to Education Rules.</p>
      <p>“It will be difficult to notify schools of such wide ranging changes now. The recommendations had been made early, keeping in mind the amount of time that will be required to prepare for them,” said a committee member.</p>
      <p>The head of a government school said that while teachers are not ready to implement a “rollback in no-detention” this year, low learning levels in government schools could lead to a large number of drop-outs.</p>
      <p>“Right now, many students are reaching class IX without even basic reading, and then are dropping out after not being able to clear class IX examinations. A sudden rollback might see an increase in the number of dropouts at class VI itself. I think we should wait for a few years, until learning levels have improved and at least 70% students are passing without the support of the no-detention policy,” said the school head.</p>
