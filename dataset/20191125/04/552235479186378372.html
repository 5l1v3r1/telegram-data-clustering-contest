      <h1>Calls for probe into 'energy gum' that has more caffeine than Red Bull</h1>
      <h2>The chewing gum is often marketed at young people.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T04:30:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">Vivienne Aitken, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/vivienne-aitken/</a></address>
      <p>Growing concerns about the use of so-called “energy gum” have prompted warnings in Scotland about excessive <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/man-21-dies-after-drinking-17491660">caffeine</a> use.</p>
      <p>Just one piece delivers 100mg of caffeine into the bloodstream, even higher than the 80mg contained in a 250ml can of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/huge-boost-wishaw-red-bull-14268510">Red Bull</a>.</p>

      <p>Heart Research UK said 400mg – what is found in four cups of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/lifestyle/food-drink/here-how-you-can-claim-19321277">coffee</a> – is safe for adults over a day but there are fears young people are using large amounts of energy gum.</p>
      <p>The Scottish ­Government last month launched a consultation into energy drinks which could lead to them being banned for sale to under-16s.</p>

      <p>Labour MSP Mary Fee wants it to be widened.</p>
      <p>She said: “Energy gum can include doses of caffeine and it is marketed at young people.</p>
      <p>"The ­consultation is welcome but the same principle should apply to other high-caffeine products.”</p>
