      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T04:30:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">Jackie Grant, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/jackie-grant/</a></address>
      <p>The sister of a Scots <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/walking-and-climbing">climber</a> who died on the world’s ninth-highest mountain has made an emotional pilgrimage to the Himalayan peak where he lost his life.</p>
      <p>Kate Ballard’s brother Tom, 30, was climbing Nanga Parbat with Italian Daniele Nardi, 42, when they went missing on February 24.</p>
      <p>The 26,660ft peak in Pakistan is dubbed Killer Mountain because of its dangerous conditions.</p>
      <p>Search teams found Tom and Daniele’s bodies, which were roped together on a hard-to-reach summit, nearly two weeks later.</p>
      <p>The tragedy happened 24 years after Kate and Tom’s mum Alison Hargreaves died while descending K2.</p>

      <p>Alison, who was 33, died months after becoming the first woman to conquer Everest unaided.</p>
      <p>Kate, 28, said life has been “extremely difficult since February”.</p>
      <p>She added: “I trekked to Nanga Parbat base camp simply to see Tom’s last mountain. It’s a magnificent place, days from civilisation, completely wild, untouched and grandiosely glorious.</p>
      <p>“Our wish is that Tom will be left at rest on the mountain – at peace, undisturbed – as with mum on K2.”</p>
      <p>In 2015, Tom was dubbed the new King of the Alps after he became the first person to solo climb all six major north faces of the mountain range in one winter.</p>
      <p>Kate, a ski and snowboarding instructor who also teaches yoga, said: “Tom was the best brother I could have wished for. I could not be more proud.</p>

      <p>“He loved me and I love him. He was shy, quiet – although when he spoke, it was worth listening.</p>
      <p>“He was in tune with our natural world and he was completely comfortable and at ease in his preferred environment.</p>
      <p>“In the mountains, mum and Tom found peace and a sense of freedom.</p>
      <p>“They simply loved to climb and were talented enough to do so at the highest level.”</p>
      <p>After Alison died in 1995, Kate, Tom and their dad James travelled from their home in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/fort-william">Fort William</a> to the spot where Alison had planned her summit of the world’s second-highest mountain.</p>
      <p>A BBC documentary team filmed the trip.</p>
      <p>Kate later described Alison as the “best mum I could have asked for”.</p>
      <p>She added: “She inspired thousands of women worldwide to reach for more in their own lives.”</p>
