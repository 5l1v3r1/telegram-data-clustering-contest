      <h2>THE future of Prince Andrew’s role as patron of one of Jersey’s most prestigious sporting clubs remains uncertain following the announcement that he is withdrawing from Royal duties.</h2>

      <p>The Duke of York is facing pressure to step down from more than 200 patronages of various charities and associations, including the Royal Jersey Golf Club and the Alderney Maritime Trust, following his widely criticised Newsnight interview concerning his long-term friendship with American businessman and convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Epstein took his own life in jail earlier this year.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for the Royal Jersey Golf Club said that they had received ‘no official communication’ on the matter and would make no comment at this time.</p>
      <p>In Alderney, Mike Harrisson, of the Alderney Maritime Trust, said he had spoken to the group’s chairman, William Tate, about the future of the patronage and a decision would be made soon. Mr Harrisson said the Prince had served the Trust very well over the past 15 years.</p>
      <p>‘I’ve met him and his daughters several times and in my opinion he is a very fine man. The rush for the door by various organisations has been far too hasty, in my opinion. He served in the Falklands and he has done a lot of good work for his country,’ Mr Harrisson said.</p>
      <p>‘We will discuss the matter further when William Tate returns from Japan.’</p>
      <p>Following the interview the Duke of York resigned from a range of roles, including being chancellor of the University of Huddersfield and as patron of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and Outward Bound Trust charity.</p>
