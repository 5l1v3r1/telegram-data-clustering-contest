      <p>New Zealand wrapped up an impressive innings and 65-run victory over England shortly after tea on the fifth day of the first test at Bay Oval on November 25 with Neil Wagner running through the lower order.</p>
      <p>Wagner took three wickets in 17 balls for just one run as England collapsed from 132-5 to 138-8 before tea, then broke a 59-run ninth-wicket partnership between Jofra Archer and Sam Curran after they had threatened to thwart the hosts.</p>
      <p>The left armer then trapped Stuart Broad in front for a first ball duck to end England's resistance at 197 and end with figures of 5-44 from 19.2 overs.</p>
      <p>England had resumed on November 25 on 55-3 and needing to bat the entire final day to stop New Zealand from taking a 1-0 lead into the second match of the two-test series that starts on November 22 in Hamilton.</p>
