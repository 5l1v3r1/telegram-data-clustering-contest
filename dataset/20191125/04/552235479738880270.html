      <p>Parents have lost faith in safety standards at the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/nhs-whistleblower-reveals-10-more-20946043">Queen Elizabeth University Hospital</a> (QEUH) in Glasgow.</p>
      <p>The claim by <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/scottish-labour-leader-sets-out-20937564">Scottish Labour’s</a> health spokesperson follows accusations of a cover up over the deaths of two children linked to contaminated water in 2017.</p>
      <p>The Daily Record previously reported how three-year old <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/health/you-couldnt-care-less-mum-20903503">Mason Djemat’s</a> death is being probed by police.</p>

      <p>He died three weeks before 10-year old cancer patient Milly Main succumbed to an infection linked to contaminated water.</p>
      <p>Yesterday Monica Lennon MSP said: “Over the weekend, parents, staff and experts have continued to raise serious concerns about the safety of the QEUH campus.</p>
      <p>“Many parents remain unconvinced that the hospital environment is safe for young cancer patients.”</p>
      <p>Anas Sarwar MSP revealed to our sister paper, the Sunday Mail a whistleblower’s claim that 10 infections were identified in the children’s hospital during 2016, a year prior to the unexpected deaths.</p>
      <p>They are on top of the 26 incidents revealed in 2017 by the same review, including Milly’s death and 23 cases in 2018 reported by Health Protection Scotland - all in paediatric cancer.</p>

      <p>Mr Sarwar said: “These latest revelations from an NHS whistleblower show that problems at this hospital have been going on for years.</p>
      <p>“It’s clear that action should have been taken much earlier by senior managers to prevent the tragedy which unfolded.</p>
      <p>“Doctors responded to concerns about the circumstances of Milly’s death by starting the formal whistleblowing process in September 2017.</p>
      <p>“Dedicated staff repeatedly raised issues about the water supply with senior management, but they weren’t listened to.”</p>

      <p>A third child was left fighting for their life after an infection linked to the water contamination crisis.</p>
      <p>The child’s mother, who wants to remain anonymous, told the Mail on Sunday: “He was admitted for a simple procedure and was only meant to be in for two days.</p>
      <p>“During a line flush he became very unwell., very quickly.</p>
      <p>“I believe if he had been at home he would have died.</p>
      <p>“He had his line removed and pathology revealed it had five separate bugs in it.</p>
      <p>“My son almost died in my arms.</p>
      <p>“I don’t want that to happen to another parent.”</p>

      <p>The Sunday Post reported that the Health and Safety Executive listed problems with the way staff were trained and equipped to deal with highly contagious diseases, in November 2018.</p>
      <p>Jeane Freeman, Health Secretary, is under pressure to resign over the scandal.</p>
      <p>She told BBC’s Sunday Politics Scotland programme she not been shown the Health and Safety Executive report into the hospital when it came out in November last year.</p>
      <p>Ms Freeman added ministers “wouldn’t normally see” HSE reports, and added that it was about a separate part of the hospital, although she went on to say senior Scottish Government officials were now looking “very carefully” at what information comes to ministers.</p>
      <p>“I want to change what is normal procedure so I do know about some of these matters,” she said.</p>
      <p>“I think I should be informed when the Health and Safety Executive issues serious compliance notices on any board.”</p>
