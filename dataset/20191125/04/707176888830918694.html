      <h1>EY targets financial consultant cuts as fees dry up</h1>
      <h2>Big Four firm places 100 London roles including several partners at risk of redundancy</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T04:00:35+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 04:00</time> by <a rel="author">Tabby Kinder</a></address>
      <p>EY has put about 100 jobs in its financial consulting unit at risk of redundancy after a decline in work and a drop-off in fees made from regulatory advice.</p>
      <p>The Big Four accounting firm, which last week revealed revenues generated by its advisory business had shrunk 3 per cent in 2019, initially earmarked 350 roles that could be axed, according to one person close to the company.</p>
      <p>The staff affected work at EY’s office in London’s Canary Wharf and the departures will include a small number of salaried partners, the person said.</p>
      <p>EY’s UK revenues grew 1.5 per cent to £2.45bn in 2019, its slowest rate in several years, although profits increased by £5m to £477m. The average pay received by EY’s partners dropped from £693,000 to £679,000 after the number of partners rose from 681 to 702.</p>
      <p>One person close to the company blamed the redundancies in part on a lack of business from Lloyds Banking Group. EY has previously provided a number of advisory services to the UK bank, including reviewing its environmental, social and governance annual investor report.</p>
      <p>In 2012 EY’s Big Four rival PwC claimed in a submission to the Competition Commission that EY was targeting a takeover of its audit of Lloyds. PwC’s 153-year role as Lloyds’ auditor ended last year when it was replaced by Deloitte.</p>
      <p>EY denied the redundancies were linked to any single client.</p>
      <p>“We routinely review our business and staffing structures to ensure they can best meet client demand and market conditions,” it said. “The proposed redundancies are not linked to any one client — it is in response to the change in the mix of our business.”</p>
      <p>It is the latest cost-cutting measure being implemented by a Big Four accountant as the grouping faces a <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/4219750e-612a-11e9-a27a-fdd51850994c">major overhaul</a> in the UK. The government is considering recommendations from the competition watchdog to force a separation of audit and consulting businesses.</p>
      <p>KPMG has launched <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/9b46c17a-f1aa-11e9-ad1e-4367d8281195">Project Zebra</a> to save £100m in costs through restricting the use of staff mobile phones, axing a third of its personal assistants and selling the lease of its Mayfair members’ club, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/58c1ad80-0a21-11ea-bb52-34c8d9dc6d84">Number Twenty</a>.</p>
      <p>EY has been investing heavily in its UK audit practice by about £25m a year and has sought to gain more banking clients. It won its first major banking audit for the Royal Bank of Scotland in 2014.</p>
