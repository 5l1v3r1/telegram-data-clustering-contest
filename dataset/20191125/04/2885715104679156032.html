      <p>Consumers who alternate between broiler and desi chicken will identify countless points of difference. One of these is that broiler chicken can sometimes be hard to chew. Now, researchers believe they have found the reason why.</p>
      <h3>What affects broiler chickens</h3>
      <p>The condition is called wooden breast syndrome. When it affects broiler chickens, it makes the meat hard and chewy. It is a costly problem that can render the birds unmarketable and cause losses for growers.</p>
      <p>The first stage of the condition involves inflammation of the veins in the breast tissue and accumulation of lipid around the affected veins. Over time, this is followed by muscle cell death and replacement by fibrous and fatty tissue. This was found during previous research from the University of Delaware, which also carried out the new study identifying the cause of the condition.</p>
      <h3>The enzyme and the fat</h3>
      <p>The researchers identified an enzyme called lipoprotein lipase as likely contributing to wooden breast syndrome in broiler chickens. Lipase is crucial for fat metabolism.</p>
      <p>The team, led by Behnam Abasht, animal and food scientist at the University of Delaware, has suggested the disease is a metabolic disorder characterised by abnormal fat accumulation in the breast muscle tissue.</p>
      <p>They arrived at this conclusion by studying irregularities in gene expression, the process by which information from a gene is used in the creation of products such as proteins. At the onset of wooden breast syndrome, they found, the expression of lipoprotein lipase was higher in affected chickens, leading to more fat accumulating in the breast muscles. This is an irregularity because breast muscle fibres in chicken typically rely on sugar molecules for fuel, not fat molecules.</p>
      <p>The researchers used RNA sequencing to determine which genes were being expressed in fast-growing broiler chickens and slower-growing legacy (desi) chickens. They then employed a new technology to pinpoint exactly where this gene expression occurred inside the muscle. The research team found genetic evidence of lipoprotein lipase being expressed in endothelial cells in chickens. Present in all blood vessels, endothelial cells serve as a barrier between the blood and the surrounding tissue.</p>
      <p>The research is published in the journal Scientific Reports.</p>
      <h3>Why it matters</h3>
      <p>In a statement, the University of Delaware said the findings could help drive short-term solutions for growers to manage the condition through supplements, or to reduce the number of birds that develop the condition.</p>
      <p>While the United States leads production of broiler chickens worldwide, the university noted that wooden breast syndrome is a concern around the world, too.</p>
      <p>It said the findings could also provide potential markers to identify chickens that will develop the disease. The researchers had compared the signals found in commercial broiler chicken at different ages. They found signals consistent with the fact that young chickens may be showing the same changes as market-age broiler chickens with wooden breast syndrome, even before the disease shows up.</p>
      <p>The university suggested that the research also could inform human health research on metabolic syndromes, such as diabetes and atherosclerosis, which is associated with fatty deposits in the arteries. From the other perspective, the team is now combing literature for treating diabetes to see if there are ways to apply similar approaches to help broiler chickens avoid — or cope — with wooden breast syndrome.</p>
