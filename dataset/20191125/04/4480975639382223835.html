      <p>The latest update on the Hong Kong election outcome, as of 0400 GMT, confirmed Hong Kong democrats’ landslide victory after the pro-democracy parties took 390 of 452 district council seats, or nearly 90%, per the local broadcaster RTHK.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, the Hong Kong residents turned out in record numbers to vote following six months of anti-government protests, in a clear show of democracy.</p>
      <p>In response to the Hong Kong election outcome, leader Carrie Lam said that “the SAR government respects the results of this election”.</p>
      <p>Lam added that she hopes that peace, security and order can continue.</p>
      <p>“Government will listen to the views of the public with an open mind”, Lam noted.</p>

      <p>The risk <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/sentiment">sentiment</a> remains buoyed by the hopes of calming Hong Kong unrest and phase one US-China trade deal. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng drives the Asian stocks higher while S&amp;P 500 futures eke out 0.25% gains. USD/JPY consolidates near four-day highs of 108.81 while the <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/currencies/audusd">Aussie</a> remains close to 0.68 handle, keeping the rebound intact from weekly lows.</p>
