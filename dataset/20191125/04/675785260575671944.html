      <p>Sam Allardyce used clips from the films Gladiator and 300 to inspire his Blackburn Rovers players before a humiliating 7-1 defeat against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> - then was sacked just over two weeks later.</p>
      <p>The unusual motivational tactic was revealed by former Blackburn defender Gael Givet, who played for the club between 2009 and 2013.</p>
      <p>The Frenchman recalled how the Blackburn players were at Old Trafford in November 2010 about to face Sir Alex Ferguson's United when Allardyce played the montage of clips from the warrior films.</p>
      <p>It is not known whether Allardyce had taken his inspiration from then <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fc-barcelona">Barcelona</a> boss Pep Guardiola, who had used a similar idea before a huge game against United the year before - but with considerably more success.</p>
      <p>Ahead of the 2009 Champions League final in Rome, Guardiola showed his team a video montage which interspersed images from Gladiator with clips of all the Barcelona players, all set to the Hollywood blockbuster's epic soundtrack.</p>

      <p>Barcelona went on to beat United 2-0 thanks to goals from Samuel Eto'o and Lionel Messi.</p>
      <p>But it was a different story for Allardyce's Blackburn, whose defence was breached five times by Dimitar Berbatov, with Nani and Park Ji-Sun also scoring.</p>
      <p>In an interview with French publication L'Equipe, Givet recalled: "We had warmed up and we went back to the dressing room.</p>
      <p>"While we were putting on our shin guards, he [Allardyce] said: 'Guys, wait!' He put down a projector and showed us a montage of the films 'Gladiator' and '300'. In short, warriors with swords.</p>

      <p>"We were all in the dressing room going: 'Arrrrr!' (he said mimicking a soldier with a sword).</p>
      <p>"After 30 minutes, we were 3-0 down. We lost 7-1.</p>
      <p>"After the match, we were all laughing. The warriors had completely passed us by."</p>
      <p>Allardyce was sacked the following month, and Blackburn eventually finished the season four points above the relegation zone.</p>
      <p>United went on to win the Premier League title by nine points from defending champions <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> .</p>
