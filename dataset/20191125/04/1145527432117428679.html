      <p>The rupee on Monday fell 2 paise to 71.73 against the US dollar in early trade, amid increased demand of the greenback by banks and importers.</p>
      <p>Strengthening crude oil prices also impacted the rupee movement in the market, forex dealers said.</p>
      <p>However, a higher opening in domestic equity markets and persistent foreign fund inflows restricted the rupee's fall, they added.</p>
