      <p>These were the words of China's ambassador to the UK, Liu Xiaoming, after he was asked about a chain of detention camps holding more than a million people from the country's Muslim minority population in Xinjiang. The footage, due to be broadcast by BBC Panorama on Monday evening, was recorded prior to publication of the China Cables, a leak of what appear to be classified documents from within the Communist party. The BBC's Richard Bilton asked Liu to tell him the truth about these camps. The ambassador responded: 'There's no so-called labour camps, they are what we call vocational, education and training centres. They are there for the prevention of terrorists'</p>
