      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T04:30:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">John Dingwall, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/john-dingwall/</a></address>
      <p>Robert Carlyle has dashed hopes of a Trainspotting spin-off film based on his character Begbie.</p>
      <p>The actor first appeared as the hardman in the 1996 film and returned for 2017 sequel T2 Trainspotting.</p>
      <p>Both films were directed by Danny Boyle – and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/robert-carlyle">Carlyle</a> said any plans for a third film based on Irvine Welsh’s novel The Blade Artist are likely to remain “on the back shelf” without Boyle’s involvement.</p>
      <p>In the 2016 book, Begbie returns to Scotland from a life in California for the funeral of his murdered son.</p>
      <p>Carlyle, 58, told a Sunday newspaper: “As far as I know from talking to Danny, he sees another Trainspotting film as being the four main characters.</p>
      <p>“I know Irvine is very interested… I’d be happy to talk about it, but it would have to be with Danny.”</p>
