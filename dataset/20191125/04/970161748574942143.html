      <p>The <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/american-music-awards/">American Music Awards</a> took place on Sunday night in Los Angeles and the stars of the music biz were out in full force.</p>
      <p>It was definitely going to be a night to remember with the likes of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/shawn-mendes/">Shawn Mendes</a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/25/shawn-mendes-camila-cabello-cant-keep-hands-off-amas-performance-arriving-solo-red-carpet-11212778/"> and Camila Cabello performing</a>, as well as Lizzo, Post Malone, Travis Scott and Ozzy Osbourne taking to the stage and Taylor Swift being honoured with the Artist of the Decade prize.</p>
      <p>But, before all the action took place on stage, it all went down on the red carpet where Swifty was just one of the famous faces leading the glamour.</p>

      <p>Brushing off her ongoing feud with Scooter Braun – <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/15/taylor-swift-reignites-scooter-braun-feud-encourages-fans-go-manager-claims-blocked-performing-songs-11148397/">the latest saw Taylor accuse Scooter of banning her from performing her old songs at the AMAs after buying her back catalogue</a>, Taylor favoured natural make up and her hair styled to one side.</p>
      <p>She was joined by her BFF Selena Gomez, who recently marked her musical comeback with new track Love You To Lose Me – a break up ballad which is heavily rumoured to be about her ex Justin Bieber.</p>

      <p>And Gomez definitely came to play, as she stepped out sporting a chic bob hair cut and a neon yellow strapless mini dress.</p>
      <p>Selena had opened the AMAs with a powerful performance of her new hit and another track called Look At Her Now and it marked her first live TV performance in two years.</p>
      <p>Also performing on the night had been <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/25/lizzo-carries-smallest-little-bag-american-music-awards-seriously-can-fit-11212707/">Lizzo, who rocked up to the red carpet with what you could probably say is the world’s tiniest handbag</a>.</p>

      <p>The singer casually posed for pics on her arrival holding her teeny tiny accessory which arguably outshone her one-shouldered ruffled orange number. Seriously, what can she fit in it?</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>During her red carpet interview, Lizzo revealed there are only three of the little handbags in the world.</p>
      <p>As for what she packed for the evening, the singer joked: ‘I got tampons in here, a flask of tequila, condoms.’</p>
      <p>Lols.</p>

      <p>Post Malone was flying the flag for the male music stars and chose to attend the AMAs in a bold, two-piece checked suit and cowboy hat.</p>
      <p>Looking sharp, he later picked up the award for Favourite Album Rap/Hip Hop for his release, Hollywood Bleeding.</p>

      <p>Other red carpet arrivals included a very glam Heidi Klum, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/25/dua-lipa-anwar-hadid-passionately-kiss-american-music-awards-red-carpet-debut-11212515/">Dua Lipa and her boyfriend Anwar Hadid</a> and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/25/ciara-makes-melanin-pop-electric-blue-suit-american-music-awards-red-carpet-ahead-hosting-11212413/">show host Ciara, who dazzled in blue</a>.</p>
      <p>Christina Aguilera and Billie Eilish fought it out for most bizarre outfit choice on the night with their striking get-ups and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/25/pregnant-jenna-dewan-vision-shows-off-growing-baby-bump-amas-red-carpet-11212825/">Jenna Dewan looked simply divine as she showed off her baby bump</a> in a fuchsia pink floor-length dress.</p>
      <p>She is expecting a baby with her boyfriend of one year, Steve Kazee.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>Real life lovebirds Shawn Mendes and Camila Cabello decided to shun a PDA-filled arrival to the AMAs and instead rocked up separately, with Shawn looking sharp in a purple suit blazer and trousers, while Camila looked like a princess in a nude gown.</p>
      <p>So much glam. So much talent. If only we could have bagged an invite, eh?</p>
