      <p>Another game, another victory. Plateau United are on a roll in the five-week-old Nigerian Professional Football League and it doesn’t matter the arena.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, the venue was the Stephen Keshi Stadium, Asaba, home of Delta Force, yet the Jos boys ran away with a 3-1 victory.</p>
      <p>There were three away victories in the league at the weekend, but Akwa Starlets’ defeat of Enugu Rangers at the Nnamdi Azikiwe Stadium will rank as the biggest of them all.</p>
      <p>Plateau United was held to a 1-1 draw by Nasarawa United in Week Four, but they made sure of all the points in Asaba despite gong down early to a Kazie Enyinnaya’s 38th-minute penalty.</p>
      <p>Matters were even in the 44th minute through Uche Onwuasoanya before Michael Ibeh and Ibrahim Mustapha scored in the second half to hand Plateau United all the points.</p>
      <p>They are still on top of the NPFL log with 13 points.</p>
      <p>Akwa Starlets pilled more pressure on Coach Ben Ugwu when they defeated Enugu Rangers 2-0 at the Nnamdi Azikiwe Stadium.</p>
      <p>The Flying Antelopes lost 1-2 to Rivers United in midweek and hoped for a better day at home when the newly promoted Starlets came calling. But they succumbed to first-half goals from Femi Ajayi and Isaac George.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere in Aba, Enyimba turned back Adamawa United with a 2-0 victory courtesy of first-half goals from the boots of Victor Mbaoma.</p>
      <p>Kano Pillars were held to a goalless draw by Wikki Tourists, just as FC Ifeanyi Ubah and Lobi ended, as well Heartland and Jigawa Golden Stars ended theirs also goalless.</p>
      <p>Katsina United defeated Sunshine Stars 2-0 courtesy of goals from Tasiu Lawal and Mohamed Gambo, while MFM FC lost 0-1 to Abia Warriors after falling to a sixth-minute strike from Oghenetega Ebetomane.</p>
