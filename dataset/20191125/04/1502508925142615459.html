      <p>Wind energy solutions provider <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/inox-wind">Inox Wind </a>on Monday said it has been granted extension by state-run SECI for the scheduled commissioning of 550 MW inter-state transmission system (ISTS) connected wind power projects in <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/gujarat">Gujarat.</a></p>
      <p>The time extension has been granted by Solar Energy Corporation of India Limited (SECI) due to delay in operationalisation of long-term access by the central transmission utility, <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/inox-wind">Inox Wind </a>said in a regulatory filing to BSE.</p>
      <p>"Out of the total 250 MW of SECI 1 at Dayapar, Gujarat, <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/inox-wind">Inox Wind </a>had successfully commissioned 200 MW in June and July, 2019," the company said.</p>
      <p>Further, SECI has also granted permission to the company to commission the balance 50 MW project, which is already under execution, it added.</p>
      <p>Inox Wind is a player in the wind energy market with three manufacturing plants in Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh.</p>
      <p>The company's manufacturing capacity stands at 1,600 MW per annum.</p>
      <p>The shares of the firm were trading at Rs 34.10 apiece on BSE in morning trade.</p>
