      <h3>German Fashionista Leonie Hanne Is A Vision In Pink Silk</h3>
      <p>

      <p>Germany’s hottest social media influencer, Leonie Hanne, stepped out for the evening at the Playa Grande Beach Club, dressed to the nines in an elegant pink silk dress. Leonie treated her 2 million <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/instagram/">Instagram</a> followers to a gift today with the newest photo from the gorgeous fashionista.</p>
      <p>Her dress cuts low in front thanks to its plunging neckline. Teasing her fans with an ample amount of cleavage is one of Leonie’s favorite past times. Her previous Instagram photos show the stunner dressed in myriad outfits ranging from sultry to chic.</p>
      <p>Embroidered floral arrangements decorate the expanse of Leonie’s latest outfit. The low-lighting of her background makes her dress catch the light and shine. Leonie’s elegant gown recalls the bliss of summer due to its flowery adornments. A warm sentiment is further expressed with her multi-colored wrap and her bright yellow Jacquemus mini handbag.</p>
      <p>Leonie’s dress is actually a slip dress from Spell, but the daring <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/5760042/kelly-brook-bikini-yoga/">model</a> decided to wear it out for the night instead of into the bedroom. Staud Clothing supplied other elements of her outfit.</p>
      <p>Aside from the initial photo, Leonie also uploaded a short, close-up video that pans from head-to-toe. The zoomed-in shot allows her admirers to see her crimped blond waves and her jewelry. Her outfit comes with a little glitz in the form of several golden necklaces, each one dangling lower than the last. It also provides her fans with a close-up of her cleavage.</p>
      <p>No glamorous evening look would be complete without at least a touch of makeup. The ravishing beauty painted her lips in a bubblegum pink color with a glossy sheen. She brushed her cheeks with a peach-colored rouge that looks astonishingly natural, as does the subtle dash of white glimmery eyeshadow on her almond-shaped eyes.</p>

      <p>Germany might be the lucky country to claim Leonie as their own, but the influencer has fans across the globe. Many of them enjoy praising the beauty’s fashion taste and good looks regularly.</p>
      <p>“Love this outfit and look,” complimented one fan.</p>
      <p>“I love your profile it’s perfect,” gushed a second admirer. They also added a darling heart-eyes emoji.</p>

      <p>Even though Leonie’s “dress” is technically sleepwear, it appears her commenters don’t mind. Many of them chimed in to admire how incredible it looks like a standard gown.</p>
      <p>A third fan echoed the sentiments of many previous commenters.</p>
      <p>“This dress looks beautiful on you,” they wrote.</p>
      <p>“Perfection: Head to Toe,” said a fourth user.</p>
