      <h3>Jurgen Klopp has admitted that he has been thrilled by his side’s electric start to the new season in the Premier League.</h3>
      <p>The Reds have been in sensational form this season and they continued their brilliant start to their new Premier League campaign when they sealed a 2-1 win at Crystal Palace on Saturday.</p>
      <p>That win was their 12th in 13 Premier League games this season and the Reds are currently the heavy favourites to win the title following their brilliant start.</p>
      <p>Indeed, Liverpool FC have only dropped two points so far this season in what has been a sensational start to the new campaign for Klopp’s men.</p>
      <p>The Reds are aiming to go one step further than they did last season as they bid to win the Premier League title this term.</p>
      <p>And Klopp has admitted that he has been thrilled by the way his side have started the new Premier League campaign.</p>
      <p>Speaking at his post-match <a href="https://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/first-team/374314-jurgen-klopp-press-conference-crystal-palace">news conference</a> on Saturday, Klopp said: “I have no clue what people will say. But I know that 37 points after 13 matchdays is exceptional.</p>
      <p>“You cannot have them with winning only brilliant games. We had a couple of really brilliant games – and we won them, thank God – but we cannot only win them, so that’s how it is.</p>
      <p>“We are not out there to send messages, we actually just want to get results.”</p>
      <p>Next up for Liverpool FC is a Champions League clash against Napoli on Wednesday night.</p>
      <p>They will then switch their attentions back to Premier League affairs and their home clash against Brighton and Hove Albion next weekend.</p>
