      <h1>Gold inches lower on trade deal hopes, firmer dollar</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T01:22:57+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 01:22</time> by <a rel="author">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>Gold prices touched their lowest in a</p>
      <p>week on Monday as positive developments towards an interim trade</p>
      <p>deal between the United States and China lifted demand for</p>
      <p>riskier assets and boosted the dollar.</p>
      <p>FUNDAMENTALS</p>
      <p>* Spot gold was down 0.1% at $1,461.02 per ounce by</p>
      <p>0058 GMT, having fallen to its lowest since Nov. 18 earlier in</p>
      <p>the session. U.S. gold futures inched 0.2% lower to</p>
      <p>$1,460.60.</p>
      <p>* Asian shares made guarded gains as investors braced for</p>
      <p>another week of likely conflicting commentary on the trade</p>
      <p>dispute, while the outperformance of recent U.S. economic data</p>
      <p>gave the dollar a leg up on its peers.</p>
      <p>* The leaders of the United States and China on Friday both</p>
      <p>underscored their desire to sign an initial trade deal.</p>
      <p>* U.S. national security adviser Robert O’Brien said on</p>
      <p>Saturday that a phase 1 trade agreement with China is still</p>
      <p>possible by the end of the year, while warning that President</p>
      <p>Donald Trump would not turn a blind eye to what happens in Hong</p>
      <p>Kong.</p>
      <p>* However, an ambitious “phase two” trade is looking less</p>
      <p>likely as the two countries struggle to strike a preliminary</p>
      <p>“phase one” agreement, according to U.S. and Beijing officials,</p>
      <p>lawmakers and trade experts.</p>
      <p>* U.S. manufacturing output accelerated in November to its</p>
      <p>fastest pace in seven months and services activity also picked</p>
      <p>up more than expected, a survey of purchasing managers showed on</p>
      <p>Friday.</p>
      <p>* Pro-democracy candidates in Hong Kong romped to a symbolic</p>
      <p>majority in district council elections after residents turned</p>
      <p>out in record numbers to vote following six months of</p>
      <p>anti-government protests.</p>
      <p>* Hedge funds and money managers increased their bullish</p>
      <p>positions in COMEX gold and silver contracts in the week to Nov.</p>
      <p>19, data showed.</p>
      <p>* Physical gold demand remained subdued in China last week</p>
      <p>against a backdrop of slowing economic growth, and in Hong Kong</p>
      <p>where protests continued, while prices in India flipped into</p>
      <p>discount as demand eased.</p>
      <p>* Silver shed 0.3% to $16.95 per ounce, palladium</p>
      <p>rose 0.2% to $1,778.77 per ounce and platinum was</p>
      <p>up 0.1%, to $891.90.</p>
