      <p>Teenager Billie Eilish kicked off the American Music Awards by picking up the first award of the night.</p>
      <p>The 17-year-old has enjoyed a breakout year since the release of her debut album When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go? and was named alternative rock artist.</p>
      <p>It was one of Eilish’s six nominations at the AMAs, where she is also up for best new artist.</p>

      <p>Pop star Halsey won the second award of the night, favourite pop rock song for Without Me.</p>
      <p>Selena Gomez opened the ceremony with a medley of her latest singles.</p>
      <p>The singer raised the curtain by performing Lose You To Love Me and Look At Her Now, which will both feature on her upcoming album.</p>
      <p>The American Music Awards, described as the world’s largest fan-voted awards show, is taking place in Los Angeles.</p>
      <p>Eilish is set to perform, alongside multiple Grammy nominee Lizzo and British star Dua Lipa.</p>

      <p>The build-up to the AMAs was dominated by a row between Taylor Swift – who will be named artist of the decade – and prominent talent manager Scooter Braun.</p>
      <p>The pop super star accused Braun and Scott Borchetta, the founder of her former record label, of blocking her from performing old songs during the ceremony.</p>
      <p>The dispute over Swift’s back catalogue appears to have been solved, with Big Machine Records, saying it would not stop her from playing tracks from her first six albums.</p>
