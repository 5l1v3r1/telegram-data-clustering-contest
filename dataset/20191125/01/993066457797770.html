      <p>THE Greens are stepping aside in key constituencies to help pro-Remain candidates but Political Correspondent John Manley asks the party's leader if this strategy is building bridges or burning them?</p>
      <p>::</p>
      <p>BASED on the results of this year's council election, the Greens are on the rise, with a doubling the party's number of councillors from four to eight. In relative terms, this was a massive surge, even eclipsing that of 'middle ground' rival Alliance. With two MLAs, it can be argued that the Greens are the strongest of the north's smaller parties, outstripping the TUV, People Before Profit and the Progressive Unionist Party in terms of elected representatives.</p>
      <p>Given this momentum, it would appear logical to run as many candidates as possible in the Westminster election, building the party's profile and demonstrating to the electorate that the Greens are now contenders and not just a flash in the pan. It's also argued that voting is habit forming and that if a party's name is absent from the ballot paper it will damage its prospects in future polls.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, the Greens are a small party with limited resources. The party has no hope of winning a Westminster seat and in a first-past-the-post election, some candidates could potentially lose their deposit. Sitting out next month's election under these circumstances, in all but three seats, perhaps makes sense.</p>
      <p>Green leader Clare Bailey told The Irish News that the decision to withdraw in key constituencies, including North Belfast and South Belfast, wasn't an easy one but she maintains this is "no ordinary election" due to the "absolute shambles" that is Brexit.</p>
      <p>In response to criticism for appearing to give precedence to Brexit over tackling climate change, the South Belfast MLA is unapologetic because she believes "the two are intrinsically linked" and that the UK's withdrawal from the EU will spell a "more catastrophic outcome for our climate".</p>
      <p>"Climate change is absolutely the biggest crisis we are facing and we know that we've got only 10 years to mitigate against the worst impact before we reach the point of no return," she said.</p>
      <p>"But Brexit isn't going to do us any favours in that regard, according to the plan we've see from Boris Johnson and the European Research Group, so we need strong voices to stand up against these proposals."</p>
      <p>Noting how "climate change doesn't recognise borders", Ms Bailey argues that the EU is the best vehicle the climate crisis.</p>
      <p>"We can act locally but it has to be seen globally and now is not the time to retreat into isolation or close borders," she said.</p>
      <p>The Green leader does not accept that her party's absence this time around in two constituencies where it has Stormont representatives will affect its future prospects, insisting that the decision to stand aside in many seats was made with only this election in mind.</p>
      <p>"We are standing three candidates so we're not out of the election all together but time will tell," she said.</p>
      <p>"I don't think there's a win-win for anybody on a party level. Normally in a first past the post election it's a tactical vote, so we're explaining to our members, we're explaining to our voters, but these are extraordinary times and they demand an extraordinary response."</p>
      <p>To those who accuse the party of engaging in 'sectarian pacts', Ms Bailey says this is a "brutal and lazy retort".</p>
      <p>"This has nothing to do with constitutional identities, it's about the will of the people – we voted to remain and certainly in my own constituency that was overwhelming."</p>
      <p>But will the Greens alignment with nationalist parties, damage its credentials in the the eyes of unionists?</p>
      <p>"There's a lot of unionists out there who want to remain in the EU and they are not being represented," she said.</p>
      <p>"With the exception of Sylvia Hermon, the DUP has been the sole voice."</p>
      <p>She believes unionists will understand the subtlety of the Greens' strategy.</p>
      <p>It's a similar response when Ms Bailey is asked whether her party will gain credibility with Sinn Féin voters in North Belfast and SDLP voters in the south of the city, helping the Greens in future single transferable vote elections for the assembly and council.</p>
      <p>"The decision wasn't taken with that in mind – it's about the here and now," she said.</p>
      <p>Likewise, Ms Bailey said, resources weren't a consideration.</p>
      <p>"I don't know what it's going bring in to do in the long-term but so far the majority of people seem to understand what we are trying to do – the best outcome for us is a pro-Remain voice for South Belfast at Westminster."</p>
