      <p>A mum has spoken out about the excruciating pain she suffers on a daily basis because of a condition that's been dubbed 'suicide disease'.</p>
      <p>Toni Lea Lawrence, 33, has to take powerful medication to deal with the chronic pain, leaving her unable to have another baby.</p>
      <p>Mrs Lawrence, from Australia, weaned herself off the pain pills in order to fulfil her dream of becoming a mum when she had her first child.</p>
      <p>However, the pain is now so bad she cannot face another pregnancy without any drugs.</p>
      <p>The senior paralegal had to give up her job because of her agonising condition.</p>
      <p>It all started in March 2010, when she suffered a wave of searing pain and lost control of her left side at work.</p>

      <p>According to <a href="https://au.news.yahoo.com/i-could-barely-talk-queensland-mums-heroic-act-after-suicide-disease-diagnosis-022203201.html">Yahoo News</a> , she said: “I was sitting at my desk reading emails and my first thought was that I was having a stroke because I was in so much pain and my left side was struggling to work, and I could barely talk."</p>
      <p>She rushed to a nearby GP surgery in a panic after a colleague said her face looked different.</p>
      <p>A doctor gave her pain relief and sent her for an MRI scan, believing she had a brain tumour.</p>
      <p>However, Mrs Lawrence later found out she had trigeminal neuralgia (TN), which is commonly known as 'suicide disease'.</p>

      <p>She said the condition caused agony on her left side and compared the pain to her teeth being ripped out with fishing wire.</p>
      <p>The mum added: "It is triggered by stress, touching my face, really cold <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/weather">weather</a> , really hot weather and wind hitting my face.”</p>
      <p>The pain associated with the disease means that most sufferers are unable to have children - because they must come off medication for their pregnancy.</p>
      <p>However, Mrs Lawrence was so keen to have a baby with her husband Kieran, 32, that she came off her medication.</p>

      <p>She suffered increasingly severe pain after the fifth week of her pregnancy.</p>
      <p>Her contractions began after she fell down the stairs at 35 weeks, although doctors held off Theo's birth for one more week.</p>
      <p>The tot, now two, was delivered via c-section and his mum was finally able to take pain relief again after he was born.</p>
      <p>Although she would love to have more children, Mrs Lawrence says her pain has now become too much to consider a drug-free pregnancy.</p>
