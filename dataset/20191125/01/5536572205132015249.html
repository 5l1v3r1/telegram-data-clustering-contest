      <p>This is just sad.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, the Philadelphia Eagles offense never showed up at home and that might have something to do with the fact that the Seahawks defense knew what was coming most of the time.</p>
      <p>After the 17-9 loss, Seahawks star defender KJ Wright claimed post-game that they actually knew most of the offensive plays the Eagles were calling.</p>

      <p>Carson Wentz threw the ball 45 times but only tossed for 256 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions.</p>
      <p>The team didn’t score a touchdown until late in the 4th quarter when the game was basically over already.</p>
      <p>The Eagles are now 5-6, but caught somewhat of a break after the Dallas Cowboys lost to the Patriots.</p>
