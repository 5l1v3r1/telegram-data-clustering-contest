      <h1>Washington Redskins' Dwayne Haskins takes selfie with fan, misses final snap</h1>

      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/dwayne-haskins">Dwayne Haskins</a> just won his first victory as starting quarterback.</p>
      <p>But, he messed it up when the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/washington-redskins">Washington Redskins</a> rookie missed the final snap in victory formation to take a selfie with a fan in the front row.</p>
      <p>“I was so hype I think I broke a water bottle,” Haskins, the former Ohio State star, said, as <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/28156636/redskins-qb-dwayne-haskins-misses-final-snap-take-selfie-fan">ESPN</a> reported. “I look up and we were in victory (formation) and said, ‘Oh, I thought the game was over with already.’ But I’ll get it next time.”</p>

      <p>Dustin Hopkins connected on a 39-yard field goal with 16 seconds left, and the Redskins snapped a four-game skid and won their first game at home in 13 months.</p>
      <p>Haskins scrambled for 11 yards and completed passes of 5 yards to Kelvin Harmon and 17 to Terry McLaurin to set up Hopkins’ go-ahead field goal.</p>
      <p>The 15th overall draft pick was 13 of 29 for 156 yards and an interception.</p>

      <p>With Haskins away from the field, backup Case Keenum took a knee to run out the clock in Washington’s second win of the season.</p>
      <p>It was a 19-16 comeback win over the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/detroit-lions">Detroit Lions</a>.</p>

      <p>The weird ending confused even interim coach Bill Callahan.</p>
      <p>“We were looking for him,” Callahan said. “I think he thought the game was over. I think he thought it was over. I’ll have to find out a little bit more.”</p>
      <p>His actions angered at least one football great, as <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/24/unprofessional-dwayne-haskins-misses-final-redskins-play-for-selfie/">The New York Post</a> reported.</p>

      <p>“How do miss the last snap of a game because ur taking selfies,” <a href="https://twitter.com/Theismann7/status/1198730525692825601?s=20">tweeted Redskins legend Joe Theismann,</a> who before the season gave Haskins his blessing to wear his former No. 7 for the first time since he retired in 1985. “That’s unprofessional &amp; wrong.”</p>

      <p>A fan seen in the selfie took the side of Haskins, retweeting Theismann’s tweet with the photo and the message: “OK. BOOMER.”</p>
