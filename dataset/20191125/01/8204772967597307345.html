      <p>Sir, – Michael Harding piece (Life, November 20th) about death being the slow departure of a boat is both a beautiful image and a true reflection of how some loved ones pass into the next realm.</p>
      <p>It describes in measured careful prose what feelings and remembrances arise, sometimes many months after a loved one’s passing. Thank you Michael, keep writing from the heart. – Yours, etc,</p>
      <p>KENNETH FINN,</p>
      <p>Portarlington, Co Laois.</p>
