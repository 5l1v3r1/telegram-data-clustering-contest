      <h1>Kelly Dodd And Vicki Gunvalson Hug At The RHOC Reunion Taping, Insider Reveals – The Enemies Shocked Everyone On Set!</h1>

      <p>Fans of Real Housewives of Orange County know all too well that Vicki Gunvalson and Kelly Dodd have not been the closest of friends in the last couple of seasons. That being said, you might be surprised to find out that their latest interaction was actually a friendly one!</p>
      <p>Have the reality TV stars finally buried the hatchet?</p>
      <p>According to a new insider report, during the RHOC reunion taping, the ladies shared a shocking hug that left everyone on set with their mouths hanging!</p>
      <p>After all, things have been really bad between them for the longest time, so it makes sense people were not expecting a nice moment between Vicki and Kelly.</p>
      <p>One insider tells HollywoodLife that ‘There was a lot of screaming and of finger-pointing involving both, however, everybody was surprised when they hugged at the end of the night. Everybody in the cast was shocked to see it happen. The ‘RHOC’ reunion filming was filled with so much drama and Vicki and Kelly were at the center of most it.’</p>
      <p>They went on to explain that since Kelly is so happy with the ‘love of her life,’ fiancé Rick Leventhal, she sees life in a different light.</p>
      <p>In other words, ‘Kelly initiated the hug to Vicki because she has honestly never been happier in her whole life and has just had it with all the screaming and fighting and felt like it was the time to try and end everything. It is clear at the core both these women are hurt, and Kelly did it because she wanted to extend an olive branch if you will and Vicki did accept.’</p>
      <p>Regardless that is not to say they are anywhere near making peace as neither wants to have anything to do with the other.</p>
      <p>The source did stress however that it’s a start as far as being more cordial is concerned.</p>
