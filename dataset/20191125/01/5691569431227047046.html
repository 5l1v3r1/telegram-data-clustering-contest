      <h1>These 21 projects are democratizing data for farmers</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T01:10:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 01:10</time> by <a rel="author">Katherine Walla</a></address>
      <p>On fields across the world, phones, tablets, drones and other technologies are changing how food is grown. Through these devices, artificial intelligence (AI) — technology able to perform tasks that require human intelligence — may help farmers use the techniques they already know and trust on a bigger scale. And big data — data sets that reveal telling patterns about growth, yield, weather and more — may help farmers make better decisions before crises strike.</p>
      <p>According to the 2018 report <a href="http://refreshfoodandtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/refresh-report.pdf">Refresh: Food + Tech, From Soil to Supper (PDF)</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/@ODSC/the-future-of-artificial-intelligence-and-agriculture-540c39208df6">AI and big data</a> may help produce more food, use less water, limit resource consumption, redirect food waste and lower food prices — all while improving the lives and incomes of farmers and food producers. "Recent advances have the potential for big breakthroughs in the ways we grow, store, transport, distribute and consume food," says the Refresh Report. "From production to consumption, this digital transformation, in tandem with new ecological services, will prove critical to reducing greenhouse gasses, addressing the multiple causes of food insecurity and feeding the planet in the 21st century."</p>
      <p>But AI and big data also may present new challenges and risks for farmers, says former Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack. Data gathering may present <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htemgI5LRdM">challenges</a> if only certain farmers have the connectivity and funding to collect and comprehend the data. AI presents similar challenges, as private ownership and development in AI may equip entrepreneurs, innovators and companies with the power to control who owns, uses and benefits from these technologies — for or against equity in the food system.</p>
      <aside>We need to get below the layer of talking about AI in just a general sense. We need to start talking about real applications and solutions.</aside>
      <p>While AI and big data may present challenges for farmers, the regulatory system controlling tech development also may let farmers down: As regulation over general AI and big data slowly opens its gates for innovation, farmers may lack access to agriculture-specific technologies at crucial times for their farms and businesses. "To the extent that we can advance the regulatory conversation, we need to be far more specific — we need to get below the layer of talking about AI in just a general sense. We need to start talking about real applications and solutions," says Andrew Kim, manager of government affairs and public policy at Google.</p>
      <p>Food Tank is highlighting 21 tools to recognize innovations changing agriculture and improving technology access worldwide through AI and big data.</p>
      <h3>1. <a href="https://blog.ciat.cgiar.org/identifying-water-sources-for-smallholder-farmers-with-agri/">AGRI</a> by <a href="https://ciat.cgiar.org/">The International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT)</a></h3>
      <p>Agua para Riego (AGRI), or Irrigation Water, helps farmers find water sources for their irrigation systems. Initially developed for use in western Honduras, AGRI combines information about climate, soils, land cover and hydrology to create texture class maps which display close water sources and sites for building reservoirs. Currently, the <a href="https://www.wri.org/">World Resources Institute</a>’s <a href="https://www.wri.org/our-work/project/initiative-20x20">Initiative 20×20 project</a> deploys AGRI tools to restore deforested and degraded land across Latin America.</p>
      <h3>2. <a href="https://www.awhere.com/about/">aWhere</a></h3>
      <p>aWhere provides agricultural information and insight to farmers and growers globally. Now a Certified B Corporation, aWhere includes services such as Ag-Weather, which provides real-time and historical data on weather variables, and Agronomics, which helps farmers make predictions based on data about precipitation, growth stages and crop stress.

      <p>Picture-Based Insurance (PBI) helps farmers access, afford and understand crop insurance. Equipped with a free app on their smartphones, farmers can upload photos of their crops every day from sowing to harvest. After harvest, local agronomists analyze each photo to determine the extent to which farmers suffered crop damage, verify losses and deliver insurance payouts directly to farmers' bank accounts. The tool not only makes crop insurance more attractive and accessible to small farmers, but also opens up opportunities to reach farmers with advice for sustainable practices and managing local weather or agriculture-related events.</p>
      <h3>15. <a href="https://plantix.net/en/">Plantix</a> by PEAT GmbH</h3>
      <p>Branded as a mobile crop doctor, the Plantix app aims to help farmers, agricultural workers and consultants increase their productivity. Using the app, farmers can take pictures of their crops and receive information about the plant — and any potential diseases it may face. The app also connects farmers to a community of experts and databases collecting tips to increase yields and treat disease.</p>
      <h3>16. <a href="https://plantvillage.psu.edu/">PlantVillage Nuru</a></h3>
      <p>PlantVillage Nuru helps farmers diagnose crop diseases, even without an internet connection. Developed at Penn State University with the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IIAT) and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the app uses Google’s Tensorflow machine learning tool to diagnose crops such as cassava and potato. While the app currently helps farmers in Africa identify fall armyworm infections, the app continues to learn how to diagnose the most pressing diseases around the world, such as lanternfly pests in Pennsylvania.</p>

      <h3>18. <a href="https://swiim.com/about/">SWIIM</a></h3>
      <p>Sustainable Water and Innovative Irrigation Management (SWIIM), developed with the help of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), provides water use data that may help farmers or landowners manage their agricultural water use. The technology monitors water flows, water consumption levels and precipitation and weather data to help users understand their water expenses. With data collected over 60 times an hour for growers, SWIIM may help users make decisions related to water overuse quickly.</p>
      <h3>19. <a href="http://www.taranis.ag/english/about-us/">Taranis</a></h3>
      <p>Taranis addresses crop loss due to insects, crop disease, weeds and nutrient deficiencies by helping land managers and producers monitor their fields. Combining imagery from satellites, planes and drones, Taranis contributes to weather forecasting, disease predicting, scouting and more. The international startup also assembles data into maps, reports, graphs and insights to help users understand their data visually.</p>
      <h3>20. <a href="http://www.terra-i.org/terra-i/about.html">Terra-i</a> by CIAT</h3>
      <p><a href="http://www.terra-i.org/terra-i.html">Terra-i</a> tracks human-caused land-cover changes across the world, from Honduras to Vietnam. Knowing that natural vegetation follows a predictable pattern of changes in greenness in certain environmental conditions, CIAT joined with partners such as The Program on Forestry, Trees, and Agroforestry; and The Nature Conservancy to develop a network "trained" to understand normal patterns of change in greenness. The system then marks areas where land-cover dramatically changes so that people worldwide can envision the costs of continuing environmentally unfriendly practices.</p>
      <h3>21. <a href="https://tracegenomics.com/#/technology">Trace Genomics</a></h3>
      <p>Trace Genomics helps farmers optimize their fields’ potential by analyzing the soil. Farmers send soils, and the tech quantifies microbes in the soil, which Trace Genomics then decodes to help farmers understand the untapped potential of their soil. Trace Genomics has mapped over 150,000 acres, forming a comprehensive database of soils in the United States. Addressing concerns over data ownership and use, Trace Genomics keeps information anonymous.</p>
