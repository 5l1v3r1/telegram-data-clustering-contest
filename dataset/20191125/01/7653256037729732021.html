      <p>NEW DELHI: The Prime Minister’s Office has set up a group of 12 ministers to resolve differences over the proposed <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Model-Agricultural-Land-Leasing-Act">Model Agricultural Land Leasing Act</a>, 2016. The <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/GoM">GoM</a> includes the ministers of defence, home, <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/agriculture">agriculture</a> and rural development.</p>
      <p>“A GoM has been constituted by PMO for examining the draft Model Agricultural <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Land-Leasing">Land Leasing</a> Act, 2016, prepared by <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Niti-Aayog">Niti Aayog</a> and recommending the way forward in the light of necessity, practicality and desirability of encouraging land leasing,” said a government order, seen by ET.</p>
      <p>The model legislation, drafted by the Aayog three years ago, is yet to be adopted by states. Most state governments have either legally banned or slapped restrictions on agricultural land leasing that have forced tenancy to be informal, insecure and inefficient.</p>

      <p>A top government official told ET that the rural development ministry which had reservations over the model legislation, and did not pursue it aggressively with the states amid apprehensions over the framework leading to loss of farm income. “It is important to sort out the differences at the GoM level over issues of national importance before it is taken up by the Cabinet,” the official said on condition of anonymity.</p>
      <p>The move came after the Aayog took up with the PMO the issue of the crucial legislation being held up. The ministers of social justice and empowerment, tribal affairs, environment and forest, railway and commerce and industry are also part of the group.</p>
      <p>A Niti Aayog expert committee led by T Haq had proposed legalising land leasing to promote agricultural efficiency, equity and poverty reduction and to ensure complete security of the ownership rights of the landowner as well as security of tenure for the tenant through the agreed lease period.</p>
      <p>Terms and conditions of lease were to be determined mutually by the landowner and the tenant.</p>
      <p>The share of agriculture in the gross domestic product (GDP) is only about 14%, but it employs 49% of the country’s total workforce and 64% of the rural workforce.</p>
      <p>Landholding sizes, however, remained very small. The Aayog thinks that legalisation of land leasing will reduce the pressure of population on agriculture and enable small farmers to augment their size of operational holdings by leasing in land.</p>
