      <p>JERUSALEM, Nov 25 — Israel is set to become the first democracy to expel a Human Rights Watch employee, its executive director Ken Roth said yesterday, denouncing the upcoming deportation of one of his staffers.</p>
      <p>US citizen Omar Shakir, the New York-based rights group's director for Israel and the Palestinian territories, is to be deported from Israel on today over his alleged support of a boycott of the Jewish state.</p>
      <p>The expulsion would make Shakir the first person to be expelled from inside the country under a controversial 2017 law allowing the deportation of foreigners who support a boycott, according to authorities.</p>
      <p>HRW denies Shakir supports a boycott and accuses Israel of seeking to suppress criticism of its policies towards Palestinians.</p>
      <p>“I cannot think of another democracy that has barred a Human Rights Watch researcher,” Roth told AFP in Jerusalem.</p>
      <p>Roth said countries including North Korea, Venezuela and Iran have expelled HRW researchers but no functioning democracy had taken such action.</p>
      <p>“I think it demonstrates the increasingly constrained nature of Israeli democracy,” Roth added.</p>
      <p>He said Israel, despite having elections and a free press, tries “as much as it can” to silence efforts “spotlighting the human rights violations at the heart of the oppressive, discriminatory occupation” of Palestinian land.</p>
      <p>Shakir has been fighting a lengthy legal campaign against expulsion but earlier this month Israel's supreme court upheld the government's deportation order.</p>
      <p>Israel accuses him of supporting the banned Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, which calls for a broad-ranging embargo of Israel over its treatment of the Palestinians.</p>
      <p>Israel sees the movement as a strategic threat and accuses it of anti-Semitism — a claim activists strongly deny.</p>
      <p>Supporters compare it to the economic isolation that helped bring down apartheid South Africa.</p>
      <p>“All those who work against Israel must know that we will not let them live or work here,” Israeli Interior Minister Aryeh Deri said earlier this month.</p>
      <p>
        <b>'Implicit green light'</b>
      </p>
      <p>The United Nations and European Union have criticised the expulsion and called on Israel to reverse course.</p>
      <p>But the United States declined to do so, saying only it supported freedom of expression worldwide.</p>
      <p>Roth contended that US President Donald Trump's support for Israel's fellow right-wing government had emboldened it to crack down on human rights groups.</p>
      <p>“It is hard to imagine Omar's deportation going ahead if the US government hadn't given a kind of implicit green light,” he told AFP.</p>
      <p>The case against Shakir was initially based on statements he made in support of a boycott before taking up his post with HRW.</p>
      <p>But the government case also highlighted work he has undertaken since joining HRW, including criticising Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank.</p>
      <p>Shakir told AFP he had not called for a boycott in his capacity as HRW's representative in Israel, but said that the rights group does not restrict free speech, including the right to call for a boycott.</p>
      <p>“It is undeniable that boycotts around the world have led to changing unjust systems but Human Rights Watch doesn't take a position on them,” he said yesterday.</p>
      <p>The NGO said Shakir would continue in his position despite being expelled, working from neighbouring Jordan.</p>
      <p>Roth argued that while Israel claimed the issue was Shakir, authorities in reality took issue with HRW's work on highlighting Jewish settlements, which are considered illegal under international law.</p>
      <p>“So we couldn’t possibly replace Omar because whoever the next person would be would engage in the same kind of advocacy that just led to Omar’s deportation,” Roth said. — AFP</p>
