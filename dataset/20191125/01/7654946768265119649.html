      <h1>Boardwalk shop owner in new fight to ‘save Coney Island’s soul’</h1>

      <p>A Coney Island T-shirt peddler helped save the neighborhood’s fabled boardwalk from luxury condos a decade ago — only to now find herself about to be booted from her shop.</p>
      <p>Dianna Carlin — whose coalition of sideshow “freaks,” burlesque queens and “mermaids” got the city to preserve the eccentric amusement district in 2009 — says the company that was tapped to maintain it is now jacking up rents, endangering the very mom-and-pop shops it was meant to protect.</p>
      <p>“We’re fighting again to save Coney Island’s soul,” said Carlin (right), who also <a href="https://lolastar.com/pages/about-us">goes by “Lola Star”</a> and owns a tiny but successful T-shirt shop by the same name on the boardwalk, as well as the Dreamland Roller Rink in Downtown Brooklyn.</p>
      <p>“I feel stabbed in the back and betrayed.”</p>
      <p>Ten years ago, Carlin’s group lobbied the Bloomberg administration to rezone 27 acres of the “People’s Playground” as an amusement and entertainment district, with 9.4 acres set aside for rides, freak shows and other throwback attractions.</p>
      <p>Before the rezoning, mega-developer Joe Sitt had repeatedly threatened to boot Carlin’s shop and other longtime businesses off the boardwalk to pave way for an entertainment complex that included high-rise condos.</p>
      <p>In addition to the rezoning, the city also spent $95.6 million to buy nearly seven acres of prime beachfront land from Sitt and save the businesses.</p>
      <p>Zamperla, an Italian thrill-ride maker, <a href="https://nypost.com/2010/02/16/coney-island-to-add-new-amusement-park-with-19-new-rides/">then won a long-term contract</a> from the city to run the area as it saw fit, including setting and taking in rents.</p>
      <p>But Carlin said Zamperla is threatening to hike her rent nearly five times its current rate when her lease expires at the end of the month. She has been operating her shop since 2001.</p>
      <p>Other boardwalk establishments targeted for “unreasonably greedy” rent increases are Ruby’s Bar &amp; Grill, the Paul’s Daughter food stand and two more mainstays, she said.</p>
      <p>Lynn Kelly, who ran the city’s Coney Island Redevelopment Corp. under Mayor Mike Bloomberg, said she was flabbergasted at the turn of events.</p>
      <p>“It’s shocking that after the amount of time and effort that all sides made in good faith to keep Coney Island authentic that these boardwalk tenants would be in this position today,” Kelly told The Post.</p>
      <p>Carlin is planning what she promises will be a “fabulous” City Hall rally on Dec. 2 to protest the rent hikes.</p>
      <p>Councilman Mark Treyger, who represents the area, said he was trying to broker “fairer” deals to help the businesses stay.</p>
      <p>Zamperla spokeswoman Elizabeth Frunzi declined to address the rent hikes but said the company was “committed to the revitalization and development of Coney Island while preserving its unique identity.”</p>
      <p>Zamperla has been credited with aiding Coney Island’s resurgence by <a href="https://nypost.com/2010/02/16/coney-island-to-add-new-amusement-park-with-19-new-rides/">opening Luna Park</a> and keeping old establishments.</p>
      <p>The city’s Economic Development Corp. urged the sides to work to reach “reasonable agreements that maintain the boardwalk’s history and vitality.”</p>
