        <b>A bleak post-Ministerial career looms – out of government, out of office, rule by the Comrades in the Socialist Peoples’ Paradise – what’s in it for an old lag like me? Ed asks his diary.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Well a positive about the SPP is that there’ll be oodles of dosh around – the Comrades are going to borrow hundreds of billions and those guys don’t account for it too precisely.</p>
      <p>How do I get my share?</p>
      <p>Social care is the answer, I fancy. The Comrades need to look after the old, the sick, the poor, the homeless and hopeless and providing the Comrades  them with the means to do that is going to be a nice little earner. </p>
      <p>Swallowing my pride after Greaser’s spiteful refusal to put me on the board of FossLux, I phone the old bastard.</p>
      <p>“Social care, Greaser.”</p>
      <p>“What about about it, Ed?”</p>
      <p>“Do you have a company involved in providing it?”</p>
      <p>“We have a company which builds shitty apartments for the old folk and another management company which screws the old peeps after they’ve bought in,” says Greaser.</p>
      <p>“Is it lucrative?”</p>
      <p>“Massively so, Ed, they buy an over-priced leasehold in the belief they’ll get like-minded company, medical care and social activities and then we jack up the management fees until they’re forced out or die by which time the management fees are so high that the leaseholds are virtually unsaleable. So we get vacant possession for no cost, or very low cost, and flog it off to the next sucker.”</p>
      <p>“Sounds just the ticket, Greaser, with some re-vamped marketing BS and some fiddled financials to hide the profits, we’ll be able to flog this to the Comrades as enlightened social provision for our seniors.”</p>
      <p>“Well you’re the expert on BS, Ed. I’ll leave it to you to rebrand this outfit to fit vision of the Socialist Peoples’ Paradise.”</p>
      <p>“Consider it done Greaser. 10% of the net?”</p>
      <p>“5%.”</p>
      <p>“7.5?”</p>
      <p>OK, Ed.”</p>
