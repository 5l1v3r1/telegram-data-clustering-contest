      <p><b>GUWAHATI</b>: The guardians of the students of the Kendriya Vidyalayas (KVs) in Assam are a worried lot as their wards are compelled to give the Assamese language a miss.</p>
      <p>This feeling has made a number of guardians of KV students here to get into a huddle recently and form an association – Kendriya Vidyalaya Abhibabok Santha. The association has, among others, raised two issues – inclusion of the regional language (Assamese) in the KV curricula and observing the summer vacation in Assam in July-August, instead of May-June.</p>
      <p>The Santha has already moved a number of MPs of the State with memoranda on its two demands. They have met BJP MPs Queen Oja, Dillip Saikia, Pallab Lochan Das and Topon Kumar Gogoi and Congress MPs Ripun Bora and Pradyut Bordoloi. The Santha has also sent a memorandum to the Union Human Resources Development (HRD) Minister on the two demands both by post and by email. Yet another memorandum has also been submitted to Kamrup (M) DC Biswajit Pegu, who happens to be the chairman of KV, Khanapara in Guwahati.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, raising the issue in the Parliament currently in session, Guwahati MP Queen Oja has appealed to the HRD Minister to include the regional language (Assamese) in CBSE (Central Board of Secondary Education) curricula so as to let KV the students of Assam and students of schools affiliated under the CBSE in the State learn their own tongue.</p>
