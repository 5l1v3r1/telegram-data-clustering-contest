      <p>New Delhi: National broadcaster <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Prasar-Bharati">Prasar Bharati</a> wasn’t asked to cover <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Devendra-Fadnavis">Devendra Fadnavis</a> and Ajit Pawar’s swearing-in event early Saturday morning.</p>
      <p>They were sworn in by governor <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Bhagat-Singh-Koshyari">Bhagat Singh Koshyari</a> at around 7:50 am in a hush-hush ceremony at Mumbai Raj Bhavan. The event came to light when news agency ANI broke the news at 8 am.</p>
      <p>DD news — the channel responsible for covering government events — was not even informed about the event, PB officials said.</p>
      <p>ET has learnt that neither DD’s Mumbai news unit was notified about the event nor the Mumbai <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Doordarshan">Doordarshan</a> Kendra. <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/All-India-Radio">All India Radio</a> was informed at the last minute as the correspondent in Mumbai was in touch with Fadnavis’ office, ET has learnt.</p>
      <p>According to the public broadcaster's programme guidelines, about 12 types of events are mandated to be covered live by both Doordarshan and AIR.</p>
      <p>As part of ‘national hook-up events’, ceremonies such as Independence Day, Republic Day, Cabinet swearing-in, oath-taking ceremonies of the CJI, the President’s address are to be covered by DD. As part of ‘state events’, state cabinet swearing-in, oath-taking events of governors and chief justices of high courts, joint sessions of state legislatures addressed by governors, relief visits by CMs are covered live.</p>
      <p>But, on Saturday, while DD news showed a 6-minute news report with ANI visuals at 8:06 am, AIR’s bulletin had the main news but said ‘details awaited’. The DD news report even had a telephonic explainer from the correspondent who termed the event ‘a shocker that no one was aware of’. The Marathi bulletin of the event in Mumbai at 8:45 am too had no original visuals.</p>
      <p>"Ideally, given the event's importance, it should have been live telecast by Doordarshan with a multi-camera setup, and also covered by AIR with bilingual commentary. But since everything happened so hurriedly, it is possible that there was no time to inform us and wait till the arrangements," an official said, on condition of anonymity.</p>
      <p>The responsibility of informing the public broadcaster about important events and ensuring their coverage, is of the director, information and public relations of the State government. It usually falls on the governor's office in cases of States that are under the President's rule.</p>
      <p>A former official on condition of anonymity said that the coverage by Doordarshan would have also involved following protocol, and subsequent mobilising of government's communication machinery, including distribution of photographs to press units, intimation to other channels about free-to-air feed and ensuring flash points in all DD channels.</p>
      <p>"It is possible that they wanted minimum publicity till the swearing-in was done. But as Prasar Bharati is answerable to the parliament, <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Maharashtra">Maharashtra</a> administration officials should have ensured their presence during the ceremony. This is also about record keeping," the official added.</p>
