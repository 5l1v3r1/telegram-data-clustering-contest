      <h1>Katherine Schwarzenegger Praises Husband Chris Pratt</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T01:08:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 01:08</time> by <a rel="author">Todd Malm</a></address>
      <p>According to a report from UsMagazine.com, Katherine Schwarzenegger took to her social media account to show gratitude for her man, Chris Pratt. The 29-year-old author took to her IG account on the 23rd of November to praise her husband, whom she described as both “kind” and “wonderful.”</p>
      <p>Together with a photograph of <i>The Guardians Of The Galaxy</i> star, the star wrote a nice message for her hubby, stating she felt so “thankful and excited” to be with her family. According to the podcast host, Thanksgiving is her “second favorite holiday,” and she often feels very inspired to give back to her community.</p>

      <p>In addition to praising her husband, Katherine shared kind words for her 64-year-old mother, Shriver, who was married to the 72-year-old Hollywood actor from 1986 until 2011. Reportedly, Pratt and Schwarzenegger started dating in June 2018 after being introduced to each other at church.</p>
      <p>In January of this year, Pratt and Katherine announced their engagement and got married six months later in Montecito, California. Before then, Pratt was linked to Anna Faris from 2009 until 2018. They had a child together named Jack, who is 7-years-old.</p>
      <p>The Schwarzenegger family is quite complicated. Reported by Page Six in June of this year, Joseph Baena, the child of Arnold and his housekeeper, Mildred Baena, took to Katherine’s social media to write, “congratulations,” along with several celebratory emojis.</p>
      <p>Baena is now 21-years-old, and multiple outlets have pointed out that he looks a lot like the former governor of California. However, the 21-year-old son of Arnold wasn’t at his half-sister’s wedding in Montecito, California, on the 8th of June.</p>
      <p>Fans of the <i>Terminator</i> alum know that he has four children with Shriver, including Katherine, Christina, Patrick, and Christopher, who are 29, 27, 25, and 21 respectively.</p>
      <p>A source who spoke with Page Six explained that Katherine and Pratt don’t have a relationship with Joseph at all, although, the insider claimed the sons in the family know him a bit better than the girls.</p>
