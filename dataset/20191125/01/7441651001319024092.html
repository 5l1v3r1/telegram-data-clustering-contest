      <p>The University of Tasmania will make a public apology next month for its role in past "wrongdoings" against the palawa kani people.</p>
      <p>The university's Vice-Chancellor Rufus Black has sent an email out to staff that said the apology was "the right and necessary thing to do" and was a step towards "true healing" with the Aboriginal people of Tasmania, the <i>Advocate Tasmania </i><a href="https://www.theadvocate.com.au/story/6507945/university-of-tasmania-to-publicly-apologise-to-aboriginal-people-for-past-wrongdoing/">reported</a> on Sunday<i>.</i></p>
      <p>Local Aboriginal leader, Michael Mansell said the apology was "sincere" and "accepted in that spirit."</p>

      <p>Tasmanian Aboriginal leader, Michael Mansell.</p>
      <p>Mr Mansell described apologies for historic wrongdoing as not being "admissions of guilt", but instead served as examples that showed how people today were prepared to take responsibility for the consequences of the past.</p>
      <p>"These include invasion, frontier war, massacres, incarceration at Wybalenna and Putalina/Oyster Cove, State-sanctioned disinterment and collection of Aboriginal human remains, the denial of human rights and even of the Tasmanian Aboriginal community's very existence," said Prof Black.</p>
      <p>"There is no single measure or dimension that can describe or start to capture the wrong that has been done in this time or the magnitude of that wrongdoing.</p>
      <p>The apology will be recorded on a plaque and written in both palawa kani and English.</p>
