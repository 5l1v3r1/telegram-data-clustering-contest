      <h1>Taylor Swift slays on AMAs red carpet after reigniting Scooter Braun feud</h1>

      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/taylor-swift/">Taylor Swift</a> absolutely nailed her red carpet look for the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/american-music-awards/">American Music Awards</a> on Sunday night.</p>
      <p>The Shake It Off hit-maker looked nothing short of fierce, as she chose to rock up to the annual ceremony, held in Los Angeles at the Microsoft Theatre, in a glittering green dress.</p>
      <p>Sassing up her number, that came with a huge slit at one side, Taylor added a pair of black thigh-high boots to her outfit and wore her blonde hair over to one side.</p>
      <p>Of course, her make-up was just as a point, with the star choosing a more natural look when it came to her glam, so she could let her dress do all the talking no doubt.</p>

      <p>All eyes are on Taylor this year, as she is up for a huge five awards including Artist of the Year and Video of the Year.</p>

      <p>She’s also been honoured with the Artist of the Decade award (yup, we’ve had 10 years of Swifty, people) and she’ll be marking the moment by performing on stage.</p>
      <p>Although, her performance hasn’t come without a little controversy, as Taylor <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/15/taylor-swift-reignites-scooter-braun-feud-encourages-fans-go-manager-claims-blocked-performing-songs-11148397/">reignited her feud with Scooter Braun</a> ahead of the AMAs.</p>

      <p>She accused him of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/taylor-swift-perform-old-songs-american-music-awards-reaching-deal-scooter-brauns-label-11178243/">banning her from performing her old songs at the awards</a> – although, Scooter has denied this.</p>
      <p>The pair first came to blows when Scooter purchased Big Machine Records, which owned all of Taylor’s back catalogue of songs and she publicly hit out at Scooter on social media earlier this year, claiming she wasn’t allowed to buy the masters of her work.</p>
      <p>Scooter had remained silent on the situation for six months, but recently addressed his spat with Taylor and their ‘toxic division’.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘I haven’t talked about this in six months, not once. ‘I haven’t made a statement about it and that’s hard, because when you have a lot of things being said and a lot of different opinions — yet the principals haven’t had a chance to speak to each other — there’s a lot of confusion.’</p>

      <p>‘I think that I’m not gonna go into details here because it’s just not my style,’ he told the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce State of the Entertainment Industry Conference.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/22/scooter-braun-begs-taylor-swift-talk-sickening-death-threats-remains-silent-11203564/">Scooter, who claims he has received death threats as a result of his fallout with T-Swift</a>, added: ‘I just think we live in a time with toxic division and people thinking that social media is the appropriate place to air out on each other and not have conversations.’</p>
