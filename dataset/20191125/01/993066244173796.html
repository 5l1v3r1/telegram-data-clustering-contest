      <p>NADINE Coyle sparked an unexpected debate among Irish speakers watching I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! over her pronunciation of the language.</p>
      <p>The former Girls Aloud singer was shown in the reality TV show teaching radio DJ Adele Roberts some words and phrases as Gaeilge.</p>
      <p>But some viewers expressed surprise at her northern pronunciations, prompting a flurry of discussion online about different Irish dialects.</p>
      <p>Sitting in the main jungle camp, Roberts asked Coyle: "Can you teach me Irish then?", to which Coyle replied: "I can teach you a little bit of Irish, yeah."</p>
      <p>"Dia duit," the 34-year-old singer said to a confused Roberts and then pronounced it "jeea ditch", adding: "That means 'hello'."</p>
      <p>One Twitter user said: "Nadine absolutely slaughtering 'dia dhuit'," while another asked: "Sorry but what was Nadine's pronunciation of 'dia duit' or do y'all nordies say it like that?"</p>
      <p>However, others defended Coyle's pronunciation, with one viewer tweeting: "I say 'dia duit' just like Nadine so y'all need to pipe down in Connacht and Munster."</p>
      <p>Another said: "I can confirm in Ulster Irish it's correct to say 'dia ditch'. Don't come for Nadine because I won't have it."</p>
      <p>Others expressed their delight in hearing Irish in the Australian jungle.</p>
      <p>"The sense of Irish pride I felt when Nadine said 'dia duit'," one viewer tweeted.</p>
      <p>Coyle has already had some fans of the show struggling to understand her Derry accent, although many have also defended and praised her brogue.</p>
      <p>Saturday's episode saw Coyle retching and struggling to eat cow anus in one of the most gruesome tasks of the jungle-based series so far.</p>
      <p>Viewers have also seen Dublin stand-up comedian Andrew Maxwell (43) break down in tears as he revealed he considered quitting the show.</p>
