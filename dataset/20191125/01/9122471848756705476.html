      <h1>Jerry Jones’ Reaction To The Cowboys’ Loss Is Going Viral</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T01:41:55+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 01:41</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>Jerry Jones has reacted to the Dallas Cowboys’ loss to the New England Patriots on Sunday night. If Jason Garrett wasn’t worried about his job security before, he should be now.</p>
      <p>The Cowboys fell to the Patriots, 13-9, in an ugly game at Gillette Stadium. The weather was bad and Dallas simply made too many mistakes to get the win (<a href="https://thespun.com/more/top-stories/cowboys-patriots-tripping-penalty-call-video">a terrible “tripping” penalty call didn’t help, either</a>).</p>
      <p>Garrett’s team dropped to 6-5 with the loss. The Cowboys are still in decent position, leading the NFC East, but there’s too much talent on this roster to be just one game above .500 late in November.</p>
      <p>Jones knows this.</p>
      <p>His postgame quote on the Cowboys’ loss has quickly gone viral:</p>
      <p>“With the makeup of this team, I shouldn’t be this frustrated.”</p>

      <p>Garrett is in the final year of his contract. It’s widely believed that the Cowboys need to make a deep postseason run (NFC Championship Game or better, probably) for the head coach to keep his job.</p>
      <p>Jones’ postgame quote basically confirms this. The Cowboys are not currently playing up to their ability and the head coach gets the blame for that.</p>
      <p>Garrett will need to change that moving forward or he’ll likely be looking for a new job in 2020.</p>
