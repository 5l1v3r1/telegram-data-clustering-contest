      <h1>Mayweather Sr. will ‘whup Dana White’s ass’ if Floyd Jr. takes a UFC fight</h1>
      <h2>Floyd Mayweather’s father made it clear that his son isn’t allowed to fight in ‘the MMA’ for his big 2020 comeback.</h2>

      <p>Floyd Mayweather is returning to action in 2020, reportedly for two more fights. There’s nothing set in stone, but TMZ Sports recently claimed <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2019/11/24/20980295/report-mayweather-aiming-for-pacquiao-rematch-and-ufc-crossover-in-2020">Manny Pacquiao is a frontrunner, and a ‘UFC crossover’</a> could be in the cards as well. Pictures of Floyd sitting next to UFC president Dana White shortly before announcing his comeback only fanned the flames of that particular rumor.</p>
      <p>The whole thing seemed to come out of nowhere and was a surprise to many ... including, as it turns out, Floyd Mayweather Sr.</p>
      <p>FightHubTV caught up with the elder Mayweather to discuss the recent news and OG Floyd admitted he learned about the unretirement the same way we did: through the headlines.</p>
      <p>”We usually talk but I ain’t heard nothing from him,” Mayweather Sr. said. “It’s a big surprise to me.”</p>
      <p>As for whether the 67 year old was supportive of his son’s latest return to boxing?</p>
      <p>”I don’t want ... it ain’t the same,” he said. “It’s not the same, I’m just saying. You got things that Floyd can do, a lot of other things other than ... and they said he was saying something about getting into that ... what that thing called?”</p>
      <p>The Octagon. It’s called the Octagon.</p>

      <p>”It better not be the MMA,” Floyd Sr. said before interviewer Marcos Villegas said he didn’t think Jr. would do that.</p>
      <p>“You don’t think Floyd would take nothing like that?” Mayweather Sr. asked with a smile. “I don’t think he’d take it either because I’d go in there and whup Dana White’s ass! F**k yeah I will. I’d whup the s**t out of him. Even though Floyd is a grown man, I’d be the grown one that’d take over that. Sure will.”</p>
      <p>So let this be a warning to both Dana White and Floyd Jr.</p>
