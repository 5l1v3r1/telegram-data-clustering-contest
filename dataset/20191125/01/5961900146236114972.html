      <h1>Here’s All The Glorious Batshit Fashion Celebs Repped At The 2019 American Music Awards</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T01:03:30+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 01:03</time> by <a rel="author">By Melissa Mason</a></address>
      <p>I often forget about the American Music Awards because they’re always on WAY too close to Christmas, and sorry but all I care about this close to the holidays is a) what swimmers I’m going to buy and b) how many forms of potato-based carbs I can make for Christmas dinner.</p>
      <p>Luckily I realised last minute that all the music-based celebs would be cavorting down a red carpet at the AMAs today, trying desperately to get the attention of the paps, because I’ve sorely missed all the batshit fashion you guys! I need the joy that is questionable footwear and weird explosions of material like I need air!</p>
      <p>Let’s get into the best and the best of the worst, shall we?</p>
      <p>
        <b>LIZZO</b>

      <p>Lizzo can never do wrong, she is a perfect human angel with the fashion tastes of Jesus. I mean, minus the sandals and robes. Jesus’ ideal fashion taste if he was born in 2019 and had access to this much shimmery neoprene.</p>
      <p>I’m even accepting that tiny bag I’d probably swallow thinking it was a Tic Tac.</p>
      <p>

      <p>Oh, my god with added enthusiasm for zebra gloves.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>What is going on here! I didn’t even recognise him – why has he dressed like a bank teller?</p>
      <p>
        <b>SELENA GOMEZ</b>
      </p>

      </figure>
      <p>Dress – amazing. Shoes – kind of vomit toned but still, can get it.</p>
      <p>Hair… Selena, doll, you have the hair of my dreams, why have you allowed some stylist to chop it into a speak-to-the-manager haircut circa 1986? Where are your three kids and Volvo minivan? Pls tell me about the dilemma of private school fees going up 20% year on year. Buy a cavoodle. Buy three!</p>
      <p>
        <b>CLAUDIA SULEWSKI &amp; FINNEAS O’CONNELL</b>

      <p>These two lovebirds were being extreeeemely cute on the red carpet, but what is less extremely cute is Claudia’s pinstriped one-sleeves business woman special suit. Also, Finneas’ skeezy mo can go, thanks.</p>
      <p>
        <b>SHAWN MENDES</b>

      </figure>
      <p>Only Shawn can wear no shirt under a blazer and make it hot. Everyone else just looks like a dad having a middle-aged crisis.</p>
      <p>

      <p>Constance!! We were rooting for you!! How dare you with this shapeless sack thing with the old birthday ribbon!</p>
      <p>
        <b>MAYA HAWKE</b>

      </figure>
      <p>I am so deeply obsessed with this, but I can’t get over whatever the weird split is over her cleavage – WHY, FASHION GODS. WHY RUIN SUCH A GOOD THING.</p>
      <p>
        <b>KESHA</b>
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/11/GettyImages-1189823265-768x1104.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Rich Fury/Getty Images</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>I mean, it’s Kesha. I feel like this is a tame outfit from her. Also Versace-chic is due for a revival. What I can’t accept is the hair – this is my exact hairstyle from when I was 12 and didn’t realise you had to rinse conditioner out.</p>
      <p>
        <b>MEG DONNELLY</b>
      </p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>I will never understand taking a nice dress, in this case either one, I don’t care, then adding some other half of a different dress to it. JUST CHOOSE ONE. Be the Julia Roberts circa Pretty Woman vibe or the Cinderella Story vibe.</p>
      <p>
        <b>ANWAR HADID &amp; DUA LIPA</b>
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/11/GettyImages-1189828624-768x1092.jpg"/>

      </figure>
      <p>All I’m going to say is when I first saw these guys I thought Dua Lipa was Gigi Hadid, and I just don’t think you want to be emulating your boyfriend’s sister in terms of vibes. But I am 100% here for her 80s prom dress.</p>
      <p>
        <b>DIPLO</b>
      </p>
      <figure>

      <p>I am living for this insane swirly acid-trip of a gown with the galactic eye makeup.</p>
      <p>
        <b>CAMILA CABELLO</b>
      </p>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>Rodin Eckenroth/FilmMagic</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Look I get the Cinderella x Rapunzel vibe here but could they have dry shampooed the fringe a little? Why does Camila look like she went for a 5km run before the AMAs?</p>
      <p>
        <b>SHANIA TWAIN</b>
      </p>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for dcp</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>On one hand she looks like a Days Of Our Lives star after they’ve gotten possessed and then shown up at their ex-husband’s wedding to cast a hex on his new wife, but on the other… it’s Shania. She can do whatever she wants, she’s diva royalty.</p>
      <p>
        <b>TYRA BANKS</b>
      </p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>You know who can’t get away with being balls to the wall batshit on a music industry red carpet? Tyra Banks. Sorry Tyra, your Inspector Gadget getup would pass at the Emmys bc YOU are TV royalty no doubt, but here? I don’t even know why you are here actually.</p>
      <p>

      <p>WHO is this person and why has he dressed for the Gulf War.</p>
      <p>
        <b>CIARA</b>
      </p>

      <p>Indulge me for a sec: MISSDEMEANOURS IN THE HOUSE!!! CIARA’S IN THE HOUSE!!! MISSDEMEANOUR’S IN THE HOUSE!!!!</p>
      <p>Ok I got it out of my system. One must always yell that when a wild Ciara appears. On the fashion front, I love a flare but not when they’re made of morph suit material, I also don’t entirely understand what’s happening under the jacket??? Is that a breast plate made of turquoise? If so.. I’m actually into it tbh she would be very protected from negative energy.</p>

      <p>I have zero idea why our Queen is at the American Music Awards, but at least she’s gone a sort of “yeah I CBF trying” outfit over the Detective Tyra look.</p>

        <b>BILLIE EILISH</b>

      <p>My favourite part is the grandma sneakers, but my colleague David Adams had the best gentle sledges for this:</p>
      <p>“Billie Eilish is power walking in the park at 5am before getting a great deal on spring onions at the market.”</p>
      <p>“Billie Eilish is Hollywood’s foremost amateur beekeeper.”</p>
      <p>“Billie Eilish got in a fight with a picnic blanket and lost.”</p>
      <p>“Billie Eilish debuts Burberry’s first nunnery collection.”</p>
      <p>“When you got a red carpet at seven and a Dutch reformation at 8.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>TAYLOR SWIFT</b>

      <p>I wish everyone would stop with morph suit boots, and I wish people would just work out if they want to wear a mini or a gown and be done with it, but how GOOD is this colour on Tay, she’s like a St Patrick’s Day goddess.</p>

      <p>Oh goddddd I mean you know you’re at Peak Dad when you do the back-to-back pose on the red carpet, Christ. I miss 00s Pete Wentz.</p>

      <p>HEAVEN. Absolute heaven – even if those pants would give me 5,664 ingrown hairs and a case of hives. Even if I originally thought this was Kacey Musgraves. Even all of those things.</p>
      <p>
        <b>BILLY PORTER</b>

      <p>IDK why Katherine’s at the American Music Awards, and I extremely don’t know why she didn’t slap the makeup artist’s hand out of her face when she realised they were giving her “eye infection, but make it fashion”.</p>
