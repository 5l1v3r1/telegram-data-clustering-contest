      <p>A NEW book which explores the life of a west Belfast man who played a key role in an attack which is said to have kicked off the Irish War of Independence is to be launched next week.</p>
      <p>Citizen Soldier, which has been written by Clonard man, Daniel Jack, examines the life of Séumas Robinson who, in 1919, led an IRA party which attacked a convoy transporting gelignite during the Soloheadbeg Ambush in Co Tipperary on the same day that the first Dáil met.</p>
      <p>The group, which included other members of the Third Tipperary Brigade - Seán Treacy, Dan Breen and Seán Hogan - shot two police men dead and stole the explosive.</p>
      <p>This has long been considered the first engagement of the Irish War of Independence.</p>
      <p>The new book explores Robinson's journey from Sevastopol Street in west Belfast to Soloheadbeg.</p>
      <p>Having joined the Irish Volunteers and the Irish Republican Brotherhood in 1913, Robinson later participated in the Easter Rising of 1916.</p>
      <p>In 1921, he became a TD for Waterford–Tipperary East.</p>
      <p>He later left Sinn Féin and became a founding member of Fianna Fáil and was elected to Seanad Éireann for the party in 1928, and re-elected in 1931 and 1934. He resigned his seat in 1936 after serving eight years as a senator.</p>
      <p>In 1947 he was appointed one of the five founding members of the Bureau of Military History. He died in December 1961, aged 72.</p>
      <p>Mr Jack said it was a "very interesting story".</p>
      <p>"It is a story that has been neglected," he said.</p>
      <p>"He is very much in the footnotes of history but he had a leading role."</p>
      <p>Those attending the book launch will also be able to view a collection of artefacts dating from the War of Independence period.</p>
      <p>Loaned to the James Connolly Visitor Centre by west Belfast collector, Pat O'Hagan, the collection includes 20 pieces.</p>
      <p>Among the items is Michael Collins' handgun, a gun used by Dan Breen, a Thompson sub-machine gun, a Royal Irish Constabulary helmet and a Royal Irish Constabulary bayonet.</p>
      <p>The collection also includes several uniforms including that of the Irish Citizen Army and an Irish Volunteer uniform.</p>
      <p>Jim McVeigh, Trustee of the James Connolly Visitor Centre, said: "This is one of the best collections of artefacts from the period anywhere in the country".</p>
      <p>:: Citizen Soldier by Daniel Jack will be launched at 7pm on Monday, December 2 at Áras Uí Chonghaile The James Connolly Visitor Centre on Falls Road in west Belfast.</p>
