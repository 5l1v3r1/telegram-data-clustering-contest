        <b>Harry Kane and Mauricio Pochettino met after the 47-year-old was sacked as Tottenham manager.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Harry Kane revealed he spent “a couple of hours” with Mauricio Pochettino in the wake of the Argentinian’s sacking as Tottenham manager.</p>
      <p>Pochettino was sacked on Tuesday and replaced by Jose Mourinho, who guided Spurs to a 3-2 win at West Ham in his first game in charge.</p>
      <p>Kane, who scored at the London Stadium, visited Pochettino the day after the 47-year-old was sacked.</p>
      <p>“I’ve been to see him,” the star forward told UK newspapers.</p>
      <p>“I went around his house and caught up with him the next day. It was a shock for everyone, so I wanted to go and see him and we had a chat for a couple of hours, and it was nice to do that before the new manager came in.</p>
      <p>“It’s been a week I’ve never really had in my career before. A big shock on Tuesday night for everyone, the players included. And then it was a quick turnaround all of a sudden we got a new manager, one of the best managers there has been in the game.”</p>
      <p>While Pochettino impressed at the helm of Tottenham, including reaching last season’s Champions League final, he failed to deliver a trophy.</p>
      <p>Mourinho is a serial winner and Kane hopes the Portuguese tactician can lead Spurs to the trophies he craves.</p>

      <p>“The gaffer has won every club he has gone to, there’s no hiding away from that,” he said.</p>
      <p>“He wants to win, he’s a proven winner. I’ve made it clear that I’m at the stage of my career where I want to win trophies, I’ve made it clear I want to win them here and it’s a big year for this.</p>
      <p>“Realistically, we look at the Champions League and the FA Cup to try to do that. We will see how that goes and, from my point of view, I will keep doing what I’m doing and keep fighting for this club on the pitch.”</p>
      <p>Spurs host Olympiacos in the Champions League on Tuesday as they look to book their place in the knockout stage.</p>
