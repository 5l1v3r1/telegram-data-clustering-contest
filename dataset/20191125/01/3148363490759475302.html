      <p>Congressman Meuser spoke with <i>Breitbart News Saturday</i> host Matthew Boyle regarding the Democrats’ impeachment inquiry, and the president’s prospects for winning Pennsylvania during the upcoming presidential election.</p>
      <p><i>Breitbart News Saturday</i> host Boyle noted that Pennsylvania serves as one of the key battleground states for the 2020 presidential election.</p>
      <p>The Pennsylvania conservative said that Trump will win Pennsylvania, because Pennsylvanians realize that the impeachment inquiry is “ridiculous” and that Trump has “delivered” on his campaign promises.</p>
      <p>Rep. Meuser said that Pennsylvanians are “rallying around him in my district, but everywhere, because even Democrats say that this is ridiculous. It’s political; all they are trying to do is damage the president. Why can’t they just get back to work?”</p>

      <p>Meuser added, “And I will tell you why the president is going to win in Pennsylvania: because he’s delivered on his promises. He hasn’t lost a vote, he has not lost a vote, and he’s picked up many because he’s delivered. Those that thought it was all talk, look at our economy. Pennsylvania is benefitting, of course, from it: unemployment at the lowest numbers in our lifetime, manufacturing picking up, wages going up, anyone who wants a job…can find a job.”</p>
      <p>“We have new openings for distribution centers, and in manufacturing, it’s taking place regularly,” the Pennsylvania congressman added.</p>
      <p>Meuser also said that Pennsylvania farmers “are for the president.”</p>
      <p>He added that Pennsylvania is also “booming in natural gas.”</p>
      <p>“Pennsylvania can be the new Texas if we do things right,” Rep. Meuser said.</p>
