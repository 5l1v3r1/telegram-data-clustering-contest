      <p>Porsha Williams slammed Loni Love on social media after seeing a clip from The Real. Judging by a post to the comedienne’s Instagram Story, the two have made up.</p>
      <p>During an episode of The Real, the ladies spoke about Porsha Williams taking back Dennis McKinley after he cheated on her while she was pregnant.</p>
      <p>Adrienne Bailon defended the Real Housewives of Atlanta star by saying that ‘maybe Porsha knows what’s best for Porsha.’ Meanwhile, Tamera Mowry said that she would never be able to do it (especially on TV) and she doesn’t know anyone else that would marry a cheating spouse so quickly after scandal.</p>
      <p>Loni Love chimed in to say: ‘Let me tell you something, Porsha trynna get that reality show, that’s what that is.’</p>
      <p>She went on to say that she’s intrigued by the storyline and will be watching.</p>

      <p>Williams did not take Loni’s comment lightly and took to social media to clap back.</p>
      <p>She captioned a portion of the clip with: ‘B**ch F you! #FakeA** don’t run up smiling when I see you.’</p>
      <p>It was clearly directed at Love who chimed in on the Shade Room to tell the mom: ‘Porsha…I didn’t say anything bad and you know it…it was a light hearted comment. I hope you get your show!’</p>
      <p>On Sunday, the talk show host posted to her Instagram Stories a message that read: ‘Thx for listening and responding @porsha4real. I’ll keep my word to you. Family is everything and I wish you nothing but success. You are always welcome on The Real.’</p>
      <p>The Bravolebrity hasn’t said anything else about the situation so far.</p>
      <p>Recently, Porsha opened up about the relationship issues she and Dennis faced and how it will play out for the world to see.</p>
      <p>‘What we’re going through is reality. Other people are going through it. By them seeing him take responsibility, me learning to forgive — all of that is something that will hopefully empower them,’ she told People Magazine.</p>
      <p>Do you think Porsha should have forgiven Loni?</p>
