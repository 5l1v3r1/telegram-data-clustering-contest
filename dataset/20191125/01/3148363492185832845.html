      <h1>Watch-- Democrat Cindy Axne: 'I Didn't Run' to 'Impeach the President'</h1>
      <h2>Freshman swing-district Democrat Rep. Cindy Axne (D-IA) said Saturday that she “did not run” to “impeach” President Donald Trump despite her backing of the impeachment inquiry.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T01:09:40+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 01:09</time> by <a rel="author">Sean Moran</a></address>
      <p>Swing-district Democrat Rep. Axne traveled to Mount Ayr, Iowa, to meet with roughly twenty constituents to discuss the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) as well as her support for the impeachment inquiry against President Trump.</p>
      <p>One Iowa constituent asked whether Rep. Axne had <a href="http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2019/roll604.xml">voted </a>for impeachment in a recent vote to formalize the rules and procedures surrounding the impeachment inquiry. Rep. Axne was one of 230 Democrats that <a href="http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2019/roll604.xml">voted </a>for that resolution that would advance the impeachment inquiry against President Trump.</p>
      <p>Rep. Axne said, “No, no.”</p>
      <p>Another constituent asked the Democrat representative whether she backs the impeachment inquiry against President Trump.</p>
      <p>Rep. Axne replied, “What I’m for is doing the hard work for the people of this district. I didn’t run for this seat to impeach the president. Go back and check my 18 months of running for this office; there is nothing in there about that.”</p>
      <p>Congresswoman Axne represents one of the 31 congressional districts that President Trump won during the 2016 presidential election and that Democrats flipped during the 2018 midterm elections.</p>
      <p>Rep. Axne’s comments follow as a recent Emerson College poll <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/10/20/iowa-voters-impeachment/">found </a>that only six percent of Iowa voters say that impeachment is the most important issue.</p>
      <p>The freshman Democrat also <a href="https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/2019/11/cindy-axne-pressed-on-usmca-impeachment/">explained </a>that House Democrats “are very close to” passing the USMCA through Congress’ lower chamber.</p>
      <p>“I’m out here working hard to make sure rural America has what it needs and that we are serving its farmers,” she explained.</p>
      <p>In October, Axne reiterated her supported for impeachment by suggesting that she swore an oath to protect the Constitution.</p>
      <p>“First and foremost, as much as my job is dedicated to helping the people here in Iowa — and that’s my priority — I took an oath and swore that I would protect the Constitution,” she <a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/10/cindy-axne-democrat-impeachment-inquiry-donald-trump-rowdy-town-hall/3938012002/">said</a>.</p>
