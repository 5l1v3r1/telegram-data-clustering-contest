      <h1>Trump reacts to Navy Sec. Spencer’s ouster, ‘not pleased’ with Gallagher case</h1>

      <p>President Trump reacted on Twitter Sunday night to Navy Secretary Richard Spencer’s ouster, saying that he “was not pleased” with SEAL Eddie Gallagher’s trial.</p>
      <p>“I was not pleased with the way that Navy Seal Eddie Gallagher’s trial was handled by the Navy,” <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1198746358091530241?s=20">he wrote</a>. “He was treated very badly but, despite this, was completely exonerated on all major charges. I then restored Eddie’s rank.”</p>
      <p>Trump also revealed that unaddressed contracting “cost overruns from past administrations” contributed to Spencer’s departure.</p>
      <p>“Large cost overruns from past administration’s contracting procedures were not addressed to my satisfaction,” the <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1198746358091530241?s=20">president wrote</a>. “Therefore, Secretary of the Navy Richard Spencer’s services have been terminated by Secretary of Defense Mark Esper.”</p>
      <p>Earlier reports indicated <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/24/def-sec-esper-fires-navy-sec-spencer-over-handling-of-seals-review/">Defense Secretary Mark Esper canned</a> the Navy secretary for going over his head while handling the internal disciplinary review of SEAL Eddie Gallagher.</p>
      <p>Esper took offense to Spencer privately telling the White House that if it did not intervene in Gallagher’s case, he would make sure the Navy SEAL would be able to retire and keep his Trident pin that designates him as an elite warrior, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2019/11/24/pentagon-chief-asks-navy-secretarys-resignation-over-private-proposal-navy-seals-case/">The Washington Post reported</a>.</p>
      <p>After speaking with Spencer, President Trump last Thursday announced on Twitter that the Navy “will NOT be taking away Warfighter and Navy SEAL Eddie Gallagher’s Trident Pin.”</p>
      <p>The president reiterated this on Sunday night. “Eddie will retire peacefully with all of the honors that he has earned, including his Trident Pin,” Trump added on Twitter.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Trump also announced in his tweet that he plans to nominate Ambassador to Norway, Admiral Ken Braithwaite, as Spencer’s successor.</p>
      <p>“A man of great achievement and success, I know Ken will do an outstanding job!” Trump said.</p>
