      <p>A CHURCH in Co Monaghan which draws most of its small congregation from Co Fermanagh celebrated its 175th anniversary yesterday.</p>
      <p>St Mary's Parish Church, Drummully, has only 36 people registered as parishioners following a decline in numbers due to the Troubles and lack of employment in the area.</p>
      <p>However, yesterday, the Church of Ireland was filled for the service which was also attended by parishioners from Galloon and Sallaghy.</p>
      <p>It was led by the Bishop of Clogher, the Right Rev John McDowell, and Roy Crowe, diocesan reader and pastoral assistant.</p>
      <p>The building of the church coincided with the famine and while the population of many parts of Fermanagh and Monaghan was decimated the parish of Drummully was largely unaffected.</p>
      <p>Following partition in 1921, the parish was cut off from the UK by the new border. However, Drummully Salient, an area inaccessible by road except through Co Fermanagh, was not policed until May 1924.</p>
