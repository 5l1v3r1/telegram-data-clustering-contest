      <p>A COUNCIL is facing criticism for plans to give its mayor an 81 per cent pay hike.</p>
      <p>Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council is proposing to nearly double the mayor's pay from £13,797 to £25,000.</p>
      <p>This is on top of the basic annual wage already received by councillors of around £15,000 – meaning the mayor would be set to earn £40,000.</p>
      <p>It would make Antrim and Newtownabbey's civic leader the fourth highest earning across the north's 11 councils.</p>
      <p>The council is also proposing to increase the deputy mayor's pay from £9,021 to £11,000 and to increase the allowances paid for roles such as chairing committees.</p>
      <p>Councillors will discuss the pay proposals at this evening's full monthly council meeting.</p>
      <p>SDLP councillor Ryan Wilson said: "There can be no justification for increasing the allowance for the mayor by over £11,000.</p>
      <p>"It is obscene when many residents rely on food banks, council workers are expected to make do with a two per cent increase in pay and many of our businesses and householders struggle with their rates bills."</p>
      <p>The Dunsilly area representative urged councillors to reject the proposals and to cap future rises to the level awarded to the council's own staff.</p>
      <p>"It is time to show leadership and to not appear that we have our noses in the trough at the expense of the hard-working ratepayers of this borough," he added.</p>
      <p>The current mayor of Antrim and Newtownabbey is DUP councillor John Smyth and the deputy mayor is Sinn Féin councillor Anne Marie Logue.</p>
      <p>The posts, which involve representing the council at many civic and ceremonial events, change hands each year and are annually elected by fellow councillors.</p>
      <p>Belfast City Council has the highest paid lord mayor in the north at £34,800.</p>
      <p>In second is Derry City and Strabane council's mayor at £31,950 while Lisburn City and Castlereagh's mayor is third with £26,982.</p>
      <p>The lowest paid is in Fermanagh and Omagh council where the chairperson receives £10,000.</p>
      <p>These allowances to mayors and chairpersons are given on top of the councillors' basic annual allowance.</p>
      <p>Antrim and Newtownabbey had already set its 2019/20 scheme for councillor pay back in June.</p>
      <p>But in papers for this evening's council meeting, it said it has received updated Stormont guidance for regulations on councillor pay which came into operation last month.</p>
      <p>Its scheme of allowances has been amended to incorporate the guidance, the local authority added.</p>
      <p>A council spokesman said councillors will "consider correspondence received from the Department for Communities in relation to its updated Consolidated Guidance on Councillor Allowances at the council meeting".</p>
