      <p>On Saturday, Bitcoin bulls were afforded a glimmer of hope as the cryptocurrency jumped 8% from the Friday low of $7,400. Though, this hasn’t lasted. As of the time of writing this article, BTC has just tapped $6,600 — the lowest the cryptocurrency has traded at since the middle of May earlier this year — and is trading down some 6.66% (yeah ominous, I know) in the past 24 hours.</p>

      <p>Some say this corroborates the idea that the cryptocurrency heads lower in the coming hours. Trader <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/25/echo-bubble-bitcoin-price-fall-5000/">Walter Wyckoff noted earlier Sunday</a> that Bitcoin is likely to close the week under $7,500, the 100-week moving average. And it did.</p>
      <p>This is important as the last time BTC closed under this support level, the cryptocurrency’s price fell by 35% in the three weeks that followed. If history repeats, Bitcoin could drop to the high-$4,000s or low-$5,000s and then bottom from there, then begin its next leg higher.</p>
      <p>There’s also an analysis of Bitcoin’s one-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) from Byzantine General, which implies that the cryptocurrency will continue to <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/24/key-technical-indicator-suggests-pain-come-bitcoin/">bleed out towards the low-$6,000s</a> and potentially high-$5,000s before relief is found at last.</p>
