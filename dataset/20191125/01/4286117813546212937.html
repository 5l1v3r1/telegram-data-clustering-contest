      <p>After declaring that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) would fight the Delhi assembly elections under the leadership of Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari, Union Minister Hardeep Singh Puri has now made a U-turn. AAP has lapped up the opportunity to hit out at opposition BJP saying the party doesn't have an opponent against Arvind Kejriwal.</p>
      <p>Issuing a clarification on his earlier statement, Puri tweeted, "The BJP is headed for victory in Delhi. The party has so far not nominated anyone for the post of Chief Minister in Delhi. Shri Manoj Tiwari is Delhi BJP chief. The party is working vigorously under his leadership. My earlier statement meant that the BJP would win the upcoming elections under his leadership with a huge margin."</p>
      <p>Now, AAP has taken a dig at Puri's statements and called the party a "wedding procession without a groom".</p>
      <p>Replying to Puri's tweet, senior AAP leader Sanjay Singh said, "So this means that you have no one against Kejriwal? Wedding procession without groom? Did your chief ministerial candidate leave the field within two hours or did the BJP not trust his talent?"</p>
      <p>In another tweet, he wrote, "Respected Hardeep Puri Ji, the people of Delhi want to know who is your CM candidate in front of Arvind Kejriwal Ji? You also mentioned Tiwari ji's name and ran away from the field within 2 hours. Has the BJP given a walkover to Kejriwal due to the election?</p>
      <p>Puri said at an event on Sunday said the BJP will fight the upcoming Delhi assembly elections under the leadership of Tiwari and he will become the chief minister if the saffron party wins.</p>
      <p>However, the Union minister later tweeted that the party has so far not nominated anyone for as a CM candidate.</p>
