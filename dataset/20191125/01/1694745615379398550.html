      <h1>Coffee-Mate Is Launching Cinnamon Toast Crunch and Funfetti Creamers in the New Year!</h1>

      <p>Adding cream and sugar to coffee is fine, but who says you can't make things extra sweet in the morning? <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/Coffee-Mate-Oat-Milk-Creamer-45692665">Coffee-Mate</a> certainly doesn't, because the brand is launching Cinnamon Toast Crunch and Funfetti creamers! The former has cinnamon, brown sugar, and "hints of toasted cereal to finish," according to a Coffee-Mate press release. It supposedly tastes like the cinnamon-infused milk left in your bowl after a helping of Cinnamon Toast Crunch, so sign us up.</p>
      <p>The Funfetti creamer has notes of vanilla, cake batter, and a sweet finish reminiscent of frosting, so plan to reach for that on early Monday mornings when you really need a pep in your step. Each of the new additions to the <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/food/Snickers-Dove-Dark-Chocolate-Coffee-Mate-Creamer-45469531">extensive Coffee-Mate lineup</a> retails for $4 per 32-ounce container and will hit shelves in January 2020.</p>
