      <p>Some officials of the Lagos State Environmental Protection Agency (LASEPA) were attacked at the weekend after they tried to curb the menace of environmental nuisances.</p>
      <p>The attacks took place at the Westgate Lounge, Omole and Sky Lounge, Oko-Oba, Agege while the officials were performing their duty to shutting down the facilities.</p>
      <p>The facilities, LASEPA said, were known for their persistent noises and failure to operate within the ambit of the law.</p>
      <p>The state government warned the general public, particularly noise polluters to desist from attacking its officials while discharging their duties or face the full wrath of the Law.</p>

      <p>The agency in its determination to curb the menace of environmental nuisances across the state and further restore sanity and orderliness, on Saturday, clamped down on over 20 facilities for various environmental related issues.</p>
