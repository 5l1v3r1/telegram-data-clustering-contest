Whenever I feel that I am straying from my weight goal, my trainer Shiva bhaiya makes sure that I stay motivated.</p>
      <p><b>How do you ensure you don’t lose focus? </b>I make it a point to check my weight regularly and keep a record of the same. Seeing your body transform right in front of your eyes was inspiring enough to keep me focused</p>
      <p><b>What’s the most difficult part of being overweight? </b>There came a point when I wasn’t able to wear the desired clothes of my choice as my size was increasing with every passing day.

      <p><b>What are the lifestyle changes you made?</b> I have made it a point to hit the sheets on time and get up early in the morning. I also started clean eating, completely stopped junk food consumption and began working out daily.</p>
      <p><b>What was the lowest point for you?</b> While I never really cared about what people had to say about my weight, I got tired of constantly hearing that I am fat and overweight.</p>

Remember that there is no substitute for hard work and no shortcut for weight loss. The sacrifices you make during your weight loss journey will be certainly worth it.</p>
