      <p>Two persons were feared dead and 11 others rescued after a passenger boat capsised in Lagos.</p>
      <p>The accident occurred around 8:15 am on Thursday at Itun Àga Area, Amuwo Odofin after the wooden boat collided with a Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) Tugboat with number 9252723, inscribed ‘Larana’.</p>
      <p>It was gathered that the 30HP engine boat paddled by one John Adesuyi had 13 occupants.</p>
      <p>According to police spokesman Bala Elkana, a Deputy Superintendent (DSP), 11 occupants were rescued in an operation involving teams of Marine Policemen, firefighters, Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA) and other responders.</p>
      <p>However, the General Manager Lagos Waterways Authority (LASWA) Emmanuel Damilola told our Correspondent that 12 of the occupants were rescued that day.</p>

      <p>He said: “From the records I have, 12 persons were rescued that day and one person is missing. The body has not been recovered yet. I can only give you further details later when I have access to the records.”</p>
      <p>In a related incident, a 26-year-old man Sodiq Yusuf last week drowned while swimming in the pool at the National Stadium, Surulere.</p>
      <p>Yusuf, a resident of 26, Horgan Bassey Street, Surulere was said to have been discovered around 6 pm on November 17 and the police contacted.</p>
      <p>According to Elkana, the victim was rescued and rushed to Randle General Hospital by policemen but he later died.</p>
      <p>“The corpse was deposited at the Mainland General Hospital morgue, Yaba for autopsy. An investigation is ongoing,” said Elkana.</p>
