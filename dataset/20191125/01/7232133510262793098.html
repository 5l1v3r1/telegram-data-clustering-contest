      <h1>Echo Bubble Analysis Suggests Bitcoin Price to Fall to $5,000</h1>

      <p>If you’ve perused Crypto Twitter at all over the past months, you’ve likely seen the term “Bitcoin echo bubble” mentioned over and over again; bears of BTC and its ilk believe that the cryptocurrency market is in the midst of effectively a “do-over” of 2018’s Crypto Winter.</p>
      <h4>Related Reading: <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/23/crypto-tidbits-bitcoin-dives-under-8000-fidelity-bags-trust-license-sec-takes-second-look-at-etf/">Crypto Tidbits: Bitcoin Dives Under $8,000, Fidelity Bags Trust License, SEC Takes Second Look at ETF</a></h4>
      <p>While some have laughed this off as pure conjecture, citing the fundamental developments of the cryptocurrency ecosystem and adoption events, there are some technical analyses backing the idea that <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/category/crypto/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> is in the midst of an echo bubble, and will thus fall further from $7,100, where BTC trades today.</p>
      <h3>Bitcoin to Close Under Key Level</h3>
      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/walter_wyckoff">Trader Walter Wyckoff recently made</a> a simple though astounding revelation: if Bitcoin closes the week on Sunday under $7,500, the price will have settled under the 100-week moving average, a key indicator of long-term support. This is important as the last time BTC closed under this support level, the cryptocurrency’s price fell by 35% in the three weeks that followed.</p>
      <p>If history repeats, Bitcoin could drop to the high-$4,000s or low-$5,000s and then bottom from there, then begin its next leg higher.</p>

      <p>What’s interesting is that $5,000 is where a number of analysts, not just Walter, expect for BTC to find a long-term bottom. Per<a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/22/wheres-ultimate-bottom-for-bitcoin-plunge-5100-analyst/"> previous reports from NewsBTC</a>, an analyst going by Mac remarked that $5,100 will be the ultimate bottom of this recent downtrend because there exists a key confluence of support levels at that level: the double-month volume-weighted average price, a “price inefficiency fill” level, and the 200-week moving average.</p>
      <p>A 35% drop to $5,000 also corroborates 888Velvet’s analysis, in which he called the recent drop from $8,000 to $6,700 over a week ago. The analyst’s chart implies that Bitcoin will bottom somewhere in the $5,000s or $6,000s — just as the abovementioned analyses expect too.</p>

      <h3>Not so Fast </h3>
      <p>While there seems to be downside momentum, there is one indicator signifying that the bottom may be here. <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/24/bitcoin-sentiment-extreme-fear-sign-bottom/">This is the Bitcoin Fear &amp; Greed Index</a>, which factors in a fair mix of volatility, market momentum and volume, social media trends, surveys, dominance, and Google Trends.</p>
      <p>The Index printed a 23, which is on the “extreme fear” side of the oscillating indicator, just today. The reading of 23, and thus “extreme fear,” are relevant because many<a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/18/crypto-market-fear-index-suggests-bitcoin-price-has-further-to-fall/"> believe that emotions drive markets,</a> especially the cryptocurrency market. As analyst RektCapital wrote in a<a href="https://medium.com/@rektcapital/how-to-use-the-fear-greed-index-to-predict-increases-in-bitcoins-price-1bd2b54069f7"> recent blog post:</a></p>
      <blockquote>“Human psychology tends to be predictably irrational because many people tend to react similarly in certain contexts… Baron Rothschild made a fortune by buying when others sold in panic. His philosophy was to ‘Buy when there’s blood in the streets.’ Because the greater the fear — the larger the opportunity for profit.</blockquote>
