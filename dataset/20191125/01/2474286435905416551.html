      <h1>Fairview Retirement Village assets to be transferred to Whiddon after resounding vote at AGM</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T01:30:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 01:30</time> by <a rel="author">Jem Nash</a></address>
      <p>There are some positive changes coming for Fairview Retirement Village after it was decided that Fairview's assets would be transferred to Whiddon at the AGM last Wednesday, November 20.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.moreechampion.com.au/story/6449034/fairview-board-to-recommend-transfer-of-assets-to-whiddon/">Fairview has been facing many challenges in recent times, which the Board of Fairview Care Limited believed they weren't equipped to deal with as a stand-alone not-for-profit organisation, so they made the recommendation to Fairview Care Limited at last week's meeting.</a>
      </p>
      <p>The recommendation passed with a resounding 77 votes for to one against.</p>
      <p>"It was a good outcome," board member Helen Spain said.</p>
      <p>"Obviously that's satisfying that we can proceed to finalise the contracts. There was much positivity and understanding within the community.</p>
      <p>"There's some excitement of the potential that Whiddon can offer Fairview and the community."</p>
      <p>The contracts are still subject to conditions, including an inspection by the Department of Health.</p>
      <p>"If that goes according to what we hope and expect, we would be looking at a transfer on February 1," Mrs Spain said.</p>
      <p>If the inspection all goes to plan and the transfer goes ahead as planned, a community group would be set up to consult with Whiddon to assist with the transition as well as partnering together for community initiatives and fundraising.</p>
      <p>Prior to the AGM, Fairview residents and families, as well as the wider community, had the opportunity to meet with chair and director of the Whiddon board, as well as the CEO and CFO at two separate meetings, providing an opportunity for any remaining questions to be answered.</p>
      <p>While there was some apprehension when the recommendation was first made, Mrs Spain said these meetings were very positive and largely solved a lot of those remaining concerns.</p>
      <p>"We provided the members of the company that got to vote with reports and more information, so they were apprised with the whole information," she said.</p>
      <p>"The Whiddon people are impressive. I think the community were impressed by what they saw.</p>
      <p>"They were impressed by the integrity of the message. There weren't promises, there was acknowledgement that this is challenging, but Whiddon have a strong record, have a strong balance sheet and they know what they're doing as aged care is transitioning.</p>
      <p>"You could almost say we actually could not have a better operator taking the reins."</p>
      <p>Mrs Spain wanted to thank the Moree community for their "understanding and their engaging in the process" after some initial negative feedback when this recommendation was first brought up.</p>
      <p>"With some understanding and information, the community have taken on board and are embracing of necessary change and as we all know, change is not always easy so I think the board are grateful to the Moree community for their support."</p>
