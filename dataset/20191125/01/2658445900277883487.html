      <p>He said: “As we head into 2020, the successful commercialization of the creative industry is our number one priority.</p>
      <p>“It will create jobs, reduce crime, be a major source of foreign exchange and thereby reduce our dependence on oil, rebrand our country internationally and boost our GDP.</p>
      <p>“So, we in government are tackling all impediments to the industry thriving.</p>
      <p>“We are making cheaper and longer-term financing available for the industry, especially for infrastructural projects, like concert halls across the six geo-political zones of the country, as recently announced by the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria,” he said.</p>
      <p>The minister said government was providing the necessary framework through the Office of the Attorney-General of the Federation to ensure that listeners of music pay for it.</p>
      <p>In addition, he said internet data must be cheaper and owners of content must make more money from the use of their works.</p>
      <p>“The other big issue for commercialisation is the digital economy – data must be cheaper and owners of content must make more money from the use of their works.</p>
