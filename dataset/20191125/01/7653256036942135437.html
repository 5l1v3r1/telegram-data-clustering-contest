      <p>The classic refrain of everyone who tries to figure out investing in <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/mutual-funds">mutual funds</a> is that there are too many of them, and it’s really hard to know where to begin. There are obvious ways around this problem, like advisers or websites or just asking around. However, there’s actually an even more difficult choice that investors face, which is at the other end of the investment cycle— which funds to sell off and when.</p>
      <p>Strangely, more knowledgeable and more involved investors face this problem a lot more than others. The reason is that those of us who are active and involved investors always have an urge to do something. Such investors generally do well because they learn, analyse and act more than others.</p>
      <p>Therefore, they start equating being good investors with doing something, often anything. Unfortunately, along with everything else, in practice, this also translates into being all to ready to sell off their investments.</p>
      <p>Most obvious reasons for selling funds are not good ones. There are some exceptions but generally speaking, good reasons tend to be about the investor’s own finances and the wrong reasons tend to be about the fund. That may not be clear so I’ll explain.</p>
      <p>Hyperactive investors give three reasons for wanting to sell off a fund investment. One, they’ve made profits; two, they’ve made losses and three, they’ve made neither profits nor losses. Someone will say, “Now that my investments have gone up, shouldn’t I book profits?” Alternatively, “This fund has lost a bit of <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/money">money</a> recently, shouldn’t I get out of it?” And finally, “The fund has neither gained nor lost, shouldn’t I sell it.” Basically, what I’m saying is that investors who have a bias for continuous action can create a logic for taking action out of any kind of situation.</p>
      <p>Clearly, none of the above reasons are the right ones. By themselves, they are not legitimate reasons for selling a mutual fund. The first comes from the spurious ‘booking profits’ concept promoted by advisers. Booking profits doesn’t make sense for stocks, and it makes even less sense for funds. This attitude makes investors sell their winners and hang on to losers. In mutual funds, the whole point is that there is a fund manager who is deciding for you which stocks to sell and which to buy. If the fund manager is doing this job well, then the fund is giving good returns. Therefore, selling a fund that gives good returns is the reverse of what investors should be doing.</p>
      <p>Now the second point. Sure, getting rid of poor performers is a legitimate idea, but you need to evaluate the timeframe and the degree of underperformance. Investors try to sell funds that have performed well but may have underperformed other funds by small margins.</p>
      <p>Someone will say that over the last year, my fund has generated 25% but five other funds have generated 30%, so I will switch to those. This switching based on shortterm past performance is counter-productive and does nothing to improve future returns. Only if a fund underperforms consistently for two or more years should you switch.</p>
      <p>So where does that leave us? The right answer is that investors should be guided primarily by their own financial <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/goals">goals</a>. You should sell a fund and get your money out when you need it. Let’s say you have invested for five or 10 or 15 years, continued your SIPs, and now the money has grown to what you need. You need to make a down payment for a house, or pay for your child’s education, or whatever else. If you’re getting close to that time, you should sell and redeem, irrespective of the state of the market. In fact, unless it’s an expense that can be postponed if needed, you should start acting one or two years before time. Withdraw the money from the equity fund and start parking it in a liquid fund. You can use an automated STP (Systematic Transfer Plan) for this, which will be convenient.</p>
      <p>Think about it. The goal of investing is not to <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/invest">invest</a>, but to sell, to get the money you have earned. That should take at least as much attention as the first part does.</p>
