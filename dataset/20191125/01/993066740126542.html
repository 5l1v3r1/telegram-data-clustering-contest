      <p>Keep your nails looking strong and healthy with these top tips, says Katie Wright</p>
      <p>Trying to keep your nails from breaking is difficult at any time of year, but in winter, it's almost impossible.</p>
      <p>During the cold months the elements combine to dry out your nails and make them more brittle, flaky and prone to chips than usual – it's particularly annoying when you want your nails to look pretty for party season.</p>
      <p>The good news is, there are several ways to counteract the effects of the cold – and we don't just mean getting back to back gel manicures.</p>
      <p>Here, Carla Opoku, founder of cruelty free and vegan nail brand Cienna Rose shares seven top tips to strengthen your nails in winter.</p>
      <p>1. Hydrate with an oil: "We use oils on our face, body and hair so why not use them on your nails too?</p>
      <p>"Cuticle oils hydrate the cuticle, skin and nail area and as they penetrate deeper, are great at giving brittle nails and dry skin a mega moisture boost."</p>

      <p>2. Don't forget your base coat: "Always wear a base coat even if you don't have time for a full on manicure.</p>
      <p>"Applying a hydrating and strengthening base coat can prevent nails from peeling and becoming weak but make sure you use a natural formula without any harsh chemicals."</p>

      <p>3. Try a nail mask: "Transform tired and brittle nails while you sleep with a treatment such as the Cienna Rose Overnight Success Revival Mask.</p>
      <p>"Combining a synthetic crystalline protein that's super effective at rehydrating and seaweed, a brilliant source of vitamins, minerals and antioxidants, along with pro vitamin B5.</p>
      <p>"Simply paint the treatment onto nails at night and let it work its magic. Rinse clean in the morning with water and voila, healthy and revitalised nails."</p>

      <p>4. Give your nails a break: "We all love shiny salon style nails, however gel manicures can really dry out the nails.</p>
      <p>"So, take a much-needed break from the gels once in a while and give yourself a pretty DIY mani."</p>

      <p>5. Exfoliate regularly: "Nails have layers of dead cells that become dehydrated and damaged.</p>
      <p>"Exfoliation helps buff away build-up of dead skin and maintain strength and good health.</p>
      <p>"Massage a scrub on the surface of your nails in gentle circular motions to smooth and brighten beds."</p>
      <p>6. Boost your B vitamins: "Bumpy, ridged nail beds are not a pretty sight and could be caused by a vitamin deficiency.</p>
      <p>"Try increasing your vitamin B9 intake, otherwise known as folic acid, which helps repair cells and promote overall nail health.</p>
      <p>"Also try boosting your diet with foods like beans and wholegrains that are rich in folic acid."</p>

      <p>7. Ditch the acetone: "Acetone packed nail polish removers can be very harsh on nails and can instantly dry them out, leading to splitting and peeling, so go acetone-free.</p>
