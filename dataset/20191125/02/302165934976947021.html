      <p>BUCHAREST, Nov 25 — Incumbent Klaus Iohannis won re-election as Romanian president yesterday, confirming the pro-European trajectory of the eastern EU member state.</p>
      <p>Thirty years after the fall of communism, the centre-right former physics professor won slightly more than 63 per cent of the vote with 95 per cent of ballots counted.</p>
      <p>His opponent, Social Democrats (PSD) leader and former prime minister Viorica Dancila, received the remaining 37 per cent, the worst-ever result for her party, which has dominated post-communist Romania.</p>
      <p>“I promise to be a president for all Romanians... A modern, European, normal Romania won today,” a jubilant Iohannis said.</p>
      <p>The 60-year-old from the German minority, who already staged a surprise win over the PSD in 2014, has campaigned to help build functioning institutions without corruption.</p>
      <p>The election was fought against a backdrop of deep resentment over controversial judicial reforms seen to benefit PSD politicians, which led to massive street protests and irked Brussels.</p>
      <p>The PSD-led government collapsed in October in a no-confidence vote, capping months of political uncertainty under the left-wing party.</p>

        <b>'Waiting for things to get better'</b>
      </p>
      <p>Stan Mihai, a 76-year-old pensioner who voted in the capital Bucharest, told AFP that Sunday's vote was "a choice for the wellbeing of Romania."</p>
      <p>“We're waiting for a revolution, for things to get better. But we are waiting for this, and nothing comes our way,” he said.</p>
      <p>A total of 18.2 million Romanians were eligible to vote, including a record 650,000 voters abroad.</p>
      <p>Part of a four million-strong diaspora who have emigrated in search of better paying jobs, they tend to favour liberal candidates.</p>
      <p>The PSD government had engaged in a long battle with the European Union over allegations it was trying to push through the measures to neuter the judiciary. Iohannis backed Brussels in the dispute.</p>
      <p>The left-wing party, which is seen as the successor of the ruling elite before the overthrow of communism, has been accused of widespread corruption.</p>
      <p>And while nationalism has been less present in Romanian politics than elsewhere in the region — such as in Hungary or Poland — the PSD tried to frame its clashes with EU institutions as evidence that it was standing up for Romania.</p>
      <p>After the PSD-led administration's fall, Iohannis tasked ally Ludovic Orban with forming a new government to be in place until legislative elections due late next year.</p>
      <p>Former foreign minister Cristian Diaconescu said Iohannis — who has made the rule of law a central plank of his campaign — represents the "only European and Euro-Atlantic option."</p>
      <p>Under the constitution, Romania's president is responsible for foreign affairs as well as approving the appointment of judges and top prosecutors.</p>
      <p>Hundreds of thousands of Romanians have protested against the judicial reforms proposed by the PSD, seen as giving politicians a way to avoid corruption sentences.</p>
      <p>“I'm very upset. They made rules just to help themselves,” said Marin Cumatrenco, a 20-year-old film student who voted early Sunday in Bucharest. The priority for him was to “continue the European course,” he added.</p>
      <p>
        <b>'Dictator' vs 'toxic'</b>
      </p>
      <p>The PSD, which has become increasingly reliant on an ageing, rural electorate, has accused Iohannis of being a “dictator.”</p>
      <p>Criticised for refusing any face-to-face debate during the campaign, Iohannis, in turn, called his rival the “incarnation of a toxic regime.”</p>
      <p>Dancila, 55, an engineer by training, has highlighted the strong economic growth recorded during the PSD's time in office, including increases in pensions and public sector salaries.</p>
      <p>But this largesse has sparked concerns by the European Union and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which has warned about the country's rising deficit.</p>
      <p>In May, the PSD's former chief and strongman Liviu Dragnea was jailed on corruption charges, and the party also saw its support plunge during European elections. — AFP</p>
