      <h1>Matt Toomua 'dreams' of vacant Wallabies No. 10 jersey following departures of international veterans</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T02:56:31+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 02:56</time> by <a rel="author">Online Editors</a></address>
      <p>Matt Toomua is putting his hand up to wear the Wallabies No.10 jersey in 2020 after the departures of a swag of veteran test playmakers.</p>
      <p>The loss of <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/brumbies/players/christian-lealiifano/">Christian Lealiifano</a>, <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/waratahs/players/bernard-foley/">Bernard Foley</a> and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/rebels/players/quade-cooper/">Quade Cooper</a> to play overseas means locking in a new five-eighth will be a top priority for incoming Wallabies coach Dave Rennie.</p>
      <p>The versatile Toomua had limited opportunities there under former <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/australia">Australia</a> coach Michael Cheika, who mixed and matched his halves pairing throughout his tenure.</p>

      <p>Toomua started at No.10 in Australia’s World Cup pool game against <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/georgia">Georgia</a> but has only worn the jersey five times since making his debut against the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/new-zealand">All Blacks</a> in 2013.</p>
      <p>The 29-year-old said he wanted to stake an early claim on the jersey, with Australia’s first internationals of the year against <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/ireland">Ireland</a> in July.</p>
      <p>The Wallabies also host two Bledisloe Cup matches against New Zealand, with the first in Toomua’s home town of Melbourne on August 8.</p>

      <p>“My ambitions are the same as everyone, to get in that starting team, but with the changing of the guard there’s a bit of unknown there,” Toomua said.</p>
      <p>“Like others you have dreams of being in a starting jersey and for me it would be that 10 jersey.”</p>
      <p>James O’Connor looms as another contender depending on where he plays in his return to <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby">Super Rugby</a> with the Reds.</p>
      <p>Toomua said he needed to form a strong combination with the anointed Melbourne <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/rebels">Rebels</a> halfback with a trio in the running to land the role after Will Genia’s move to Japan.</p>

      <p>Fiji international <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/fiji/players/frank-lomani/">Frank Lomani</a>, young Australian <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/reds/players/james-tuttle/">James Tuttle</a> and South Africa-born veteran Ryan Louwrens are the No.9 hopefuls.</p>
      <p>“I will have some competition there as well with Andrew Deegan, who did really well at the (Western) Force, so we’ve recruited well,” Toomua said.</p>
      <p>“There’s some big holes with Will and Quade gone but I think with the young guys we’ve got coming through there’s a recipe for success.”</p>
      <p>Toomua said he hadn’t spoken to Rennie since the New Zealander’s appointment last week.</p>
