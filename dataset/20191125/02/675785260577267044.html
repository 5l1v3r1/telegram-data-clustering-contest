      <h1>Benjamin Mendy sends Liverpool message as Man City bid to close Premier League title gap</h1>
      <h2>Mendy wants to prolong Liverpool's 30-year wait for league crown and says City will be ready to pounce if Reds crack under pressure</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T02:30:25+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 02:30</time> by <a rel="author">David McDonnell, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/david-mcdonnell/</a></address>
      <p>Benjamin Mendy is determined to prolong Liverpool’s 30-year wait for the title and pile fresh misery on Jurgen Klopp and his players.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">City</a> overcame a seven-point deficit last season to overhaul Klopp’s side and make it back-to-back Premier League title triumphs.</p>
      <p>While a repeat of that feat looks unlikely, with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> nine points ahead of City and on a 30-game unbeaten run in the league, Mendy said Pep Guardiola's side will be ready to pounce if they falter.</p>
      <p>Asked if the pressure of trying to land a first title since 1990 could ultimately see Liverpool unravel, the France full-back said: “I hope they’re going to wait a year more. We’ll see.</p>
      <p>“It’s good for all the people and I hope they are enjoying the Premier League."</p>

      <p>Speaking after City came from behind to beat <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> 2-1 at the Etihad on Saturday, Mendy added: “A lot of the games are very exciting and we live for this type of game.</p>
      <p>"We’re going to fight and the better team will win.</p>
      <p>“We’re still the champions, so we’re going to fight until the end to keep the title here. If, at the end, Liverpool win the title, we’re going to say congratulations, but we’re going to fight.</p>
      <p>“I know they’re first now, but there are a lot of games for Liverpool to play and we’ll see the places in the table at the end of the season.”</p>

      <p>City host Shakhtar Donetsk in the Champions League on Wednesday knowing a win would guarantee top spot in Group C.</p>
      <p>They then resume their bid to catch Liverpool in the Premier League when they visit <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Newcastle</a> United on Saturday. Jurgen Klopp's Reds host <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brighton-and-hove-albion-fc">Brighton</a> the same day.</p>
