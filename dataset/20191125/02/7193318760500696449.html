        <b>Yuletide reunion: Lyric Theatre's 'A Christmas Carol' brings back actors, audiences for traditional holiday favorite</b>
      </p>
      <p>For the better part of a decade, Oklahoma merrymakers have been making Lyric Theatre's "A Christmas Carol" a part of their seasonal customs.</p>
      <p>But the faithful staging of Charles Dickens' beloved yuletide ghost story isn't only a well-loved tradition for the audiences who flock to the Plaza Theatre to see the show.</p>
      <p>"It's become a part of my Christmas, and I just love it. I look forward to it every year. I fly home Christmas Day, but the six weeks before is another huge part of Christmas for me in Oklahoma City," said Dirk Lumbard, the North Carolina-based actor who is starring as Lyric's Ebenezer Scrooge for the fourth straight year.</p>
      <p>"It's a joy each time. ... Hopefully, I'm appropriately horrible."</p>
      <p>Lyric's ninth annual production of the cherished classic will come a-caroling Friday-Dec. 24, bringing to the Plaza District the Victorian tale of a miserly businessman who changes his selfish ways after he is haunted by four ghosts on the night before Christmas.</p>
      <p>"There's few constants in theater as far as getting to work with the same people because every show is a different cast and different creative team. There's something really comforting and sweet about knowing once a year we're going to gather as friends and as family - our Lyric family - to tell a story that we already know and we already love, that we know works and that audiences also want to see and get a lot out of of," said Producing Artistic Director Michael Baron, who directs the show every year.</p>
      <p>"It's just a lovely time to come together as theater people."</p>

        <b>Creative reunion</b>
      </p>
      <p>When he first moved to OKC, Baron said he told the Lyric Theatre board of directors that one of his programming plans was to create a professional production of “A Christmas Carol” that would not only establish a yuletide tradition for the theater but would also serve as a home for the holidays for the talented actors in the community. Although every five years he shakes up the production with a new set, costumes and casting, the director said most of the company has been with the show since its start.</p>
      <p>The cast includes many Lyric favorites, including Thomas E. Cunningham as a triple threat as Jacob Marley, Mr. Fezziwig and Old Joe; Charlie Monnot as Bob Cratchit; Mateja Govich as the Ghost of Christmas Present; Susan Riley as a solicitor; Matthew Alvin Brown as Topper; Lexi Windsor as Belle; Jennifer Teel as Mrs. Fred; and Brenda Williams as Mrs. Dilber. The production also features Andi Dema in the dual roles of Fred and Young Scrooge, Natalya Fisher as the Ghost of Christmas Past and Nakeisha McGee as Mrs. Cratchit.</p>
      <p>"There are nine or 10 of us adults that reunite every year ... and I love each and every one of them - and I think they feel the same way," said Lumbard, a seasoned actor whose Broadway credits include “The Music Man,” “Barnum” and “Chitty Chitty Bang Bang."</p>
      <p>"Half the fun of this show is in the dressing room, getting ready for the show. ... It is hilarious down there. These people are very, very funny, very witty, and we're just like a family down there. It's really great."</p>
      <p>While the adult players will mostly remain the same until Baron revamps the whole show in a couple of years, the annual production gains two new casts of children each year who rotate throughout the show's run.</p>
      <p>"I'm super excited to work with new kids every year," Baron said, adding that former "Carol" child Ashleigh Robinson now works for Allied Arts. "It's fun to see that there are kids that were in the cast here in Oklahoma are already adults and working in the arts."</p>
      <p>Just like any other family, "The Christmas Carol" cast has bonded through hardship, Lumbard said, particularly last season when a flu outbreak meant the performers often had to double up on roles.</p>
      <p>"That was a lot of fun and a little bit stressful, but still brought us together and we pulled it off," he said, adding that the production is adding four swing performers this year in case of any other illnesses or emergencies. "We'd just all get together and say, 'Let's make this work.' ... And it would become so rewarding at the very end of the evening because you pull it off - and that's one of the miracle things about theater."</p>

        <b>Redemption story</b>
      </p>
      <p>Although he has fond memories of watching Albert Finney in the 1970 movie-musical "Scrooge," Lumbard said he prefers to Baron's script, which hews closely to Dickens' original text.</p>
      <p>"It doesn't need anything more. ... The purity of this one holds up beautifully," Lumbard said. "The journey of the part is always, always very rewarding."</p>
      <p>Although the costumes, sets and cast remain largely the same, he said that doesn't mean that the show is entirely unchanged.</p>
      <p>"It feels like I've gotten deeper into the character and gotten better at the character. Michael in directing, at times, will just give it a little bit of a slant different," Lumbard said.</p>
      <p>"I think it gets tweaked in different ways, and I think, generally, in better ways. ... So, the show that I did four years ago is not like the one that I do now - in a good way. I've grown and gotten deeper in it, and it seems like everybody does. Nobody takes that job, this particular production, lightly. We're all very invested in it."</p>
      <p>For Baron, "A Christmas Carol" is an vibrant reminder of the true significance - and potential - of the yuletide season.</p>
      <p>"Christmas has become fairly commercial ... so we get to talk about the real meaning of Christmas with this production," he said. "I think that's important because there's a lot of candy canes and icicles and Santa Clauses out there, but there's only one tale of redemption that's been told since 1843."</p>
