      <h1>Shaq Lawson Went Off On Denver OL Connor McGovern After Game ‘You Remember Me Now’ (VIDEO)</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T02:04:49+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 02:04</time> by <a rel="author">Darrelle Lincoln</a></address>
      <p>With all the talk about certain winning teams around the league, not many people are paying attention to the Buffalo Bills.</p>
      <p>The team sits comfortably at 8-3 following a 20-3 victory over the Denver Broncos on Sunday.</p>
      <p>During that game, Shaq Lawson had two of Buffalo’s four sacks and he wanted somebody on the Denver offensive line to know it.</p>
      <p>During the post-game handshake, Lawson approached Denver o-lineman Connor McGovern after the lineman stated he had never heard of him.</p>
      <p>Lawson made sure he knew about him now.</p>

      <p>“First of all, they were talking junk,’’ said Lawson after he pulled on a sweatshirt reading “Buffalo vs. Everybody.’’</p>
      <p>“That’s my thing, I talk junk. You can’t out-junk me. I like that stuff. To start the game, I think it was No. 60 (center Connor McGovern), he goes ‘I haven’t remembered you since college.’ I said, ‘I bet I show you.’ ’’</p>
