      <h2>Grace Millane told her killer she had not said 'yes' to his date request, prompting the 27-year-old to respond with 'you haven't said no either' - the chilling messages were released after the man was found guilty of murder in New Zealand</h2>

      <p>Newly released Tinder messages show how Grace Millane's killer talked her into meeting him for a date.</p>
      <p>The 27-year-old killer promises to buy drinks for the British backpacker in their exchange on the dating app.</p>
      <p>Grace at first appears reluctant to meet the local man during her travels in New Zealand, repeatedly telling him 'maybe' when he proposes date ideas.</p>
      <p>The man took the university graduate back to his hotel room after the date and strangled her to death.</p>
      <p>He then shoved her body into a suitcase and buried it in a shallow grave just outside Auckland, New Zealand.</p>
      <p>The killer claimed Grace died accidentally during rough sex, however, last week a jury reached the unanimous verdict that he murdered her.</p>

      <p>In his first message to the Brit, he wrote: "Hey Grace how are you? Much planned for your weekend?"</p>
      <p>She replied by telling him it was her birthday tomorrow and she did not have any plans.</p>
      <p>He then proposed they go for a drink, with Grace saying 'maybe' in response.</p>

      <p>Her killer asked her 'maybe yes??', prompting the Brit to suggest he 'convince' her.</p>
      <p>The murderer offered to 'shout' free booze for Grace and recommended a 'cool Mexican place'.</p>
      <p>Grace told him she was 'maybe' up for drinks, although when her killer suggested another venue she said 'I haven't said yes yet?'</p>

      <p>In a chilling message, the 27-year-old then replied 'you haven't said no either'.</p>
      <p>The pair later had a boozy date in Auckland, with Grace returning to her killer's room, where he strangled her to death.</p>
      <p>He then went on another Tinder date while she lay dead in his apartment.</p>
      <p>The killer is due to be sentenced in February.</p>
