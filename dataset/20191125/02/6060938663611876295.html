      <p>KOLKATA: <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Mushfiqur-Rahim">Mushfiqur Rahim</a> could only delay, not deny India with his attacking 74. In just 47 minutes and 52 balls on a sunny afternoon, the first-ever pink-ball Test in India was over before the first drinks break on the third day.</p>
      <p>

      <p>Bangladesh had been blown away by an innings and 46 runs, after their second essay yielded 195 runs. After the Indore win in similar fashion, it was clear that the colour of the ball didn't really matter.</p>

      <p>It was the pacers who once again did the job for India. <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/umesh-yadav">Umesh Yadav</a> grabbed all three wickets that fell on Sunday (<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Mahmudullah">Mahmudullah</a> didn't come out to resume his innings) to bag a fifer, denying <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/ishant-sharma">Ishant Sharma</a> his second five-wicket haul of the match. But the Delhi pacer, who bagged nine for 78 in the match, was adjudged Man-of-the-Match and Series. He had three in Indore, where the bulk of wickets had been pocketed by Mohammad Shami.</p>
      <p>The Indian pacers thus captured all 19 Bangladesh wickets that fell in this Test. From the time when <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/anil-kumble">Anil Kumble</a> grabbed all 10 in an innings against Pakistan two decades ago, the Indian bowling has gone through a thrilling transition.</p>

      <p>This was India's seventh win on the trot - two each against the West Indies and Bangladesh with three versus South Africa in between - their best run ever in Test cricket.</p>
      <p>This was also India's fourth straight innings victory - a world record. However, as a modest Kohli warned, most of these wins have come in home conditions. "All I can say is that we are at the top of our game," he said. "You can't judge a team's dominance after seven games."</p>

      <p>Talking about Rahim, he did deny India a win inside two days. Had the diminutive batsman not batted for 96 balls and spent 183 minutes in the middle, India wouldn't have had to take the field on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Rahim, the best Bangladesh batsman in the series, came out with attacking intentions, charging Ishant and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/ravindra-jadeja">Ravindra Jadeja</a>. Although the ploy did not work against the lanky pacer, he did get the spinner away for boundaries. Al-Amin Hossain picked up five boundaries, some of them fortuitous, in his 21 but those were never going to be of much help. There was just too much on the table for the Bangla tail to sweep away.</p>

      <p>Ishant, the first player on the field from both teams, was raring to go as he needed just one wicket for a personal milestone. But Yadav had other ideas. The latter finished with eight in the match, one less than Ishant.</p>
      <p>Shami couldn't add to his first innings haul of two, but played his part by intimidating the Bangladesh batsmen.</p>
