      <p>Police have taken to social media to voice their frustration following a number of alleged deliberately lit fires across the city including Victoria Park.</p>
      <p>A passerby on a Victoria Park walking track, south-east of the corner of Quercus and Plane avenues, noticed a fire lit in pine needles under large trees shortly before 7.30pm on Sunday.</p>

      <p>A second small grass fire was observed near Bray Raceway on Pleasant Street, just south of Bell Street, a short time later.</p>

      <p>Luckily no major damage was caused by the fires as they were put out before they could spread, however heading into warmer weather police are very disappointed by the behaviour.</p>
      <p>Police were told two males, believed to be in their early teens, were seen running in the vicinity of the incidents.</p>
      <p>One of the teens was described as around 173cm tall with shoulder-length curly brown hair.</p>
      <p>This comes less than a week removed from one of the region's <a href="https://www.thecourier.com.au/story/6504792/ballarats-day-of-chaos-wind-and-fires-wreak-havoc/?cs=62">wildest day of bushfires</a>, which saw over 20 separate blazes burn across the the greater west of the state.</p>
      <p>Anyone with information regarding these incidents is urged to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 or submit a confidential report at <a href="https://www.crimestoppers.com.au/">https://www.crimestoppers.com.au/</a></p>
