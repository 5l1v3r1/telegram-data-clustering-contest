      <h1>American Music Awards: Halsey throws shade at GRAMMYs snub as she takes prize</h1>
      <h2>She didn't win back in February but this time it was a different story as the start grabbed the AMA for Favourite Pop/Rock Song</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T02:34:07+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 02:34</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Elliott, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/sam-elliott/</a></address>
      <p>Fans were wondering if <a href="https://www.etonline.com/people/halsey">Halsey</a> threw shade the GRAMMYs after delivering an intense speech at the 2019 American Music Awards.</p>
      <p>She was snubbed at the February bash despite an incredible year.</p>
      <p>But the star got her hands on the award for Favourite Pop/Rock Song - and was dropping hints as she went up to collect her first ever AMA gong.</p>
      <p>The Without Me singer didn't miss the opportunity to call out other awards shows after stepping on stage.</p>
      <p>She said: "I grew up watching shows like this and I would sit at home wide-eyed and watch artists in these beautiful gowns and handsome suits.</p>

      <p>"Stroll up the stairs to the stage and they would hold up these awards and they were usually gold-plated and shiny and weighted, these, like, metaphors, these trophies that were supposed to be some kind of validation for the soul-crushing and heartache-inducing work that they put into writing a song and bringing it to life.</p>
      <p>"And to be honest with you, I really believed that fairy tale.</p>
      <p>"I believed these awards. When I was a kid, I used to believe that this award was the ultimate validating and that I'd come up here and laugh and cry and my fans at home would rejoice because we accomplished this thing together.</p>

      <p>"But the truth is I am older now and I'm also an artist and apparently I'm doing OK. But most of these awards really aren't what they seem at all."</p>
