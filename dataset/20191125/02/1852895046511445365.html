      <h4>She came, she saw, she SLAYED! Billie Eilish may be a newcomer to the AMAs, but her performance of ‘All The Good Girls Go To Hell’ absolutely blew the lid off L.A.’s Microsoft Theater.</h4>
      <p>Bow down! <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/tag/billie-eilish/"><b>Billie Eilish</b></a> is <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2019/10/24/2019-ama-nominations-american-music-awards-nominees-list/">up for six awards</a> at the 2019 AMAs and she showed why she’s so deserving with an incredible performance of “All The Good Girls Go To Hell”. The 17-year-old phenom has absolutely dominated the music scene this year and proved that she’s worth all the buzz. Billie wore a statement costume, as her oversized black t-shirt with red sequined flames read “No Music On A Dead Planet,” a rallying cry about the dangers of climate change. The stage was surrounded by flames as if she really was in Hell as she did her dominating dance moves.</p>
      <p>Billie went into the night tied with <b>Ariana Grande</b> with six AMA nominations, just behind leader <b>Post Malone</b>‘s seven. She’s up for Best New Artist, Best Female Artist Pop/Rock, Best Alternative Rock Artist, Best Video for “Bad Guy,” Best Social Artist and Best Album Pop/Rock for <i>When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?</i> She took home the first award of the evening, going onstage to pick up Best Alternative Rock Artist then later won Best New Artist. When her performance was introduced by <b>Tyler the Creator</b>, he announced, “I had the number one album in the country. Then a 17-year-old girl who dresses like a quarterback decided to change all that.”</p>
      <p>2019 has been an absolute monster year for the teenage newcomer. She proved that she was worth all of the buzz and hype with a <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2019/04/05/who-is-billie-eilish-singer/">dazzling set at Coachella</a> in April where she performed “Bad Guy” live for the first time. She made the coveted cover of <i>Rolling Stone</i> in August with the tagline “Billie Eilish and the Triumph of the Weird.” Then she went on to be the <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2019/09/29/billie-eilish-snl-performance-bad-guy-season-45-premiere-watch/">featured musical artist</a> for the 45th season debut of <i>Saturday Night Live</i> on Sept. 28.</p>
