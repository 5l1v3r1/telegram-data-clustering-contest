      <p><a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Gold-prices">Gold prices</a> touched their lowest in a week on Monday as positive developments towards an interim trade deal between the United States and China lifted demand for riskier assets and boosted the dollar.</p>
      <p>
        <b>FUNDAMENTALS</b>
      </p>
      <p>Spot gold was down 0.1 per cent at $1,461.02 per ounce by 0058 GMT, having fallen to its lowest since Nov. 18 earlier in the session. US gold futures inched 0.2 per cent lower to $1,460.60.</p>
      <p>Asian shares made guarded gains as investors braced for another week of likely conflicting commentary on the trade dispute, while the outperformance of recent US economic data gave the dollar a leg up on its peers.</p>
      <p>The leaders of the United States and China on Friday both underscored their desire to sign an initial trade deal.</p>
      <p>US national security adviser Robert O'Brien said on Saturday that a phase 1 trade agreement with China is still possible by the end of the year, while warning that President Donald Trump would not turn a blind eye to what happens in Hong Kong.</p>
      <p>However, an ambitious "phase two" trade is looking less likely as the two countries struggle to strike a preliminary "phase one" agreement, according to US and Beijing officials, lawmakers and trade experts.</p>
      <p>US manufacturing output accelerated in November to its fastest pace in seven months and services activity also picked up more than expected, a survey of purchasing managers showed on Friday.</p>
      <p>Pro-democracy candidates in Hong Kong romped to a symbolic majority in district council elections after residents turned out in record numbers to vote following six months of anti-government protests.</p>
      <p>Hedge funds and money managers increased their bullish positions in COMEX gold and <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/commoditysummary/symbol-SILVER.cms">silver</a> contracts in the week to Nov. 19, data showed.</p>
      <p>Physical gold demand remained subdued in China last week against a backdrop of slowing economic growth, and in Hong Kong where protests continued, while prices in India flipped into discount as demand eased.</p>
      <p>Silver shed 0.3 per cent to $16.95 per ounce, palladium rose 0.2 per cent to $1,778.77 per ounce and platinum was up 0.1 per cent, to $891.90.</p>
