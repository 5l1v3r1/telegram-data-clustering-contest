      <h1>KUWK: Kim Kardashian Updates Fans On Brother Rob’s Wellbeing Amid Rumors He’s Dating Kylie’s BFF Stassie – He’s ‘Doing Great!’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T02:26:42+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 02:26</time> by <a rel="author">Ashley Mitchell</a></address>
      <p>As they were leaving Drake’s Halloween party, Rob Kardashian and his sister Kylie Jenner’s close friend Stassie Karanikolaou looked really comfortable with each other in some now-viral paparazzi pics. More precisely, the only Kardashian son can be seen getting quite touchy-feely with the blonde beauty so it makes sense that there are rumors the two are romantically involved!</p>
      <p>Amid these speculations, another of his sisters, Kim Kardashian, told Entertainment Tonight that her only brother is doing great lately!</p>
      <p>Furthermore, he’s also spending some more quality time with his immediate relatives, especially during the Holidays!</p>
      <p>‘He’ll be around for Thanksgiving.  been around a lot — I’d say for the past year or two he’s been around,’ Kim shared during the interview.</p>
      <p>As fans remember, Rob has kept away from the public life in recent years because of his struggle with mental health issues as well as weight gain.</p>
      <p>That being said, people always want to know more about his health so Kim delivered when it comes to updating everyone: ‘Rob is doing great. He definitely is more low-key than all of us, and we love that and respect that.’</p>
      <p>Because of his depression, Rob was dealing with some extreme weight gain which then led to him developing Type 2 diabetes!</p>
      <p>But in a post from the clan’s Halloween party this year, Rob looked almost as slim as he once was so that made fans really happy.</p>
      <p>‘We love having [Rob] around. …He’s doing really good,’ Kim stressed once again.</p>
      <p>Previous insider reports also mentioned that since people always compliment and congratulate him for dropping so many pounds, Rob has been gaining a lot of confidence back.</p>
      <p>So now, the question that is most on fans’ minds is – ‘was he confident enough to make a move on Stassie?’</p>
