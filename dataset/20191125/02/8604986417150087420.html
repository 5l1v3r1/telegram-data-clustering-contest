      <h1>Here's Why You Should Stop Worrying About Raising an Only Child</h1>
      <h2>Friends or family may warn you that growing up a singleton is emotionally crippling. They're wrong.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T02:15:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 02:15</time> by <a rel="author">Minda Zetlin</a></address>
      <p>Are you the parent of an only child, or thinking about having only one child? If so, are you worried about the psychological impact this may have on him or her? A lot of parents do, and a lot of well-meaning friends and family members are quick to provide dire warnings that growing up as a singleton could negatively affect your kid. But I'm a happy, healthy, well-adjusted only child and I'm here to tell you: You can stop worrying.</p>
      <p>It seems to be widely "known" that only children are self-centered and difficult to get along with compared to people with siblings. (I do have an older half-sister from my mother's previous marriage, but she grew up with her father in the Philippines so I did not meet her until I was an adolescent and she was in her 20s.) </p>
      <p>All this "known" information about only children seems to be based on <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/is-only-child-syndrome-real/">highly dubious research</a> conducted in the 19th century. E.W. Bohannon sought to learn about the subject by handing out questionnaires. But he didn't give them to only children, he gave them to 200 people with siblings and asked them what <i>they</i> thought about only children. Those subjects rendered their opinions which might or might not have been based on stereotypes. When Bohannon compiled those results they were elevated to the status of scientific findings. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2016/jan/18/my-phd-busts-the-old-stereotypes-about-selfish-smug-only-children">According to him</a>, we are liable to be cruel, gluttonous, smug, priggish, selfish, untruthful, bad-tempered, and generally peculiar. And only sons are likely to be effeminate as well. </p>
      <h3>More creative, less agreeable?</h3>
      <p>Since then, there's been a little more research into only childhood. One meta-study (a study of studies) by researchers at the University of Texas in Austin in 1986 found that the only difference between only children and children with siblings is that only children formed stronger bonds with their parents. In 2017, though, researchers at China's Southwest University, Chongqing, compared 177 students with siblings to 126 students who were only children. On personality tests, the <a href="https://www.inc.com/betsy-mikel/study-only-children-are-more-creative.html">only children scored higher on creativity</a> and lower on "agreeableness." Those findings were confirmed by brain scans of the subjects--the only children had more development in the part of their brains that controlled creativity, and less in the medial prefrontal cortex, which is thought to help people control their own emotions and understand the emotions of others. </p>
      <p>This is, at least, more scientific than the research Bohannon did century before last. At the same time, it's not clear to me that the brains and abilities of 303 Chinese college students would necessarily mirror those of Americans. And even if they do, we're talking about fairly subtle differences. It's a long way from suggesting that only children will be emotionally crippled for life. </p>
      <p>As for me, thinking back to college and high school and even earlier, I've always had a very active social life. I became president of the <a href="http://www.asja.org/">American Society of Journalists and Authors</a> which isn't something you can do if you are antisocial or unpopular. I also need and enjoy time by myself now and then, perhaps more than my counterparts with siblings do. But knowing how to be happy in my own company seems more like a strength than a weakness to me.</p>
      <p>I remember thinking when I was a small child that I was worse at getting along with my peers than I should have been. But looking back on it now, I think that may have been because my parents, both of whom had siblings, worried that being an only child would make it harder for me to make friends and they and voiced that concern in my presence. Children believe what their parents say about them because they have no other point of reference and so I believed myself to be someone who had a hard time getting along with others even though over time that proved to be untrue.</p>
      <p>A man once told me that every only child he knew was either solitary or had "a zillion friends." I thought about it and answered, "I'm solitary <i>and</i> I have a zillion friends." If your only child grows up the same, he or she may find it's a pretty good way to be.</p>
