      <p>LVMH is close to buying US jewelry chain Tiffany &amp; Co. for about US$16.3 billion after sweetening its offer, Reuters reports, citing sources.</p>
      <p>The two sides are close to an agreement after the French luxury goods company raised its offer price for the company known for its engagement rings and ties to Hollywood glamor to US$135 per share, sources familiar with the matter said. It would be LVMH’s largest takeover.</p>
      <p>The new price is up from US$130 last week and US$15 higher than the original all-cash offer delivered to Tiffany by LVMH managing director Antonio Belloni on Oct. 18.</p>
      <p>It represents a 7.5 percent premium over Tiffany’s closing share price on Friday and is more than 50 percent higher than where the price stood before LVMH launched its effort to woo the company.</p>
      <p>LVMH, owned by Europe’s richest man, Bernard Arnault, has eyed the company for years after buying Italy’s Bulgari in 2011 for 3.7 billion euros, at the time the largest luxury goods deal in a decade.</p>
      <p>Tiffany will help grow its smallest business, give it a bigger share of the lucrative US market and expand in jewelry, the fastest-growing sector in the luxury goods industry.</p>
      <p>Known for its signature robin’s egg blue packaging, Tiffany rebuffed LVMH’s initial advance made just five weeks ago, arguing it significantly undervalued the company.</p>
      <p>Reuters reported earlier that LVMH had persuaded Tiffany to provide it with confidential due diligence after it raised its bid to US$130 per share, worth almost US$16 billion.</p>
      <p>Tiffany, founded in New York in 1837, had struggled with falling annual sales and profit since 2015, before a revenue turnaround in 2017.</p>
