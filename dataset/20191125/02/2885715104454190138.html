      <p>DR SAUGATA Choudhary, a senior resident at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) in <a href="https://indianexpress.com/elections/chandigarh-lok-sabha-election-results/">Chandigarh</a>, died while on a trek to Churdhar Peak in Himachal Pradesh on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The doctor, who was an assistant blood transfusion officer at the Department of Transfusion Medicine at PGIMER, had gone trekking with a group of 10 friends and had stopped at a place called Tesri on Friday night, before heading towards Churdhar peak again on Saturday morning.</p>
      <p>On Saturday morning, as he trekked further towards Churdhar, Chaudhary found himself getting increasingly breathless and stopped to break at an eating joint, but eventually died by Saturday night as his condition worsened.</p>
      <p>According to official sources at PGI, Chaudhary was cremated in Sector 25 on Sunday. His parents flew in from Kolkata for the last rites.</p>
      <p>Upon hearing the news of Chaudhary’ deteriorating medical condition, PGI director Jagat Ram constituted a team of doctors, including a pulmonologist, an anaesthesiologist and a young transfusion student who was Chaudhary’s friend, to rescue and bring Choudhary back for treatment at PGI. However, Choudhary had passed away before they arrived at the hospital in Nauradhar where he was being treated.</p>
      <p>According to a source from Choudhury’s department, the young doctor had been rescued by local police officers and civilians and sent to the hospital at Nauradhar, but he was pronounced dead on arrival. “Despite best efforts, it is hard to reach individuals on a trek quickly,” he said.</p>
