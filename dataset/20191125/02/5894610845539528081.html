      <h1>'Keep on running': Gran (70) vows not to slow down after 700th marathon</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T02:30:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 02:30</time> by <a rel="author">Elaine Keogh</a></address>
      <p>A grandmother who has completed her 700th marathon says she has no intention of slowing down.</p>
      <p>Collette O'Hagan (70), from Dundalk, has covered 18,300 miles - or just under 30,000km - which equates to going from Dublin to Barcelona and back seven times.</p>
      <p>Collette has run marathons all over the world since completing her first one in 1990 at the age of 41.</p>
      <p>She said she was "totally overwhelmed with all the lovely comments from so many on my 700th marathon, and while I don't want this to sound like an Oscar speech, I really want to thank each and every one of you from the bottom of my heart".</p>

      <p>Collette ran her 700th on Thursday, and said that when she read the lovely comments and messages to her, "I ask myself is it really me they are talking about?"</p>
      <p>She is often asked why she has done so many marathons and what drives her on.</p>
      <p>"I thoroughly enjoy doing them. I like challenges, and feel we should all strive to reach and achieve goals in our lives," she said.</p>
      <p>"Sometimes these goals go beyond my limitations but there is no harm in pushing the barriers every so often as long as you are not constantly doing so.</p>
      <p>"You need ingredients like motivation, determination, focus, tenacity and both mental and physical fitness. Mix all these together and you have the basis for life's challenges and long distance running."</p>
      <p>She added: "If I leave my footprints on this Earth I want them to be not just carbon, but embedded in a trail of total respect and affinity towards my fellow human beings, regardless of their colour, race or creed."</p>
      <p>And as for her plans for the future she said: "No stopping, no finish line, just keep on running."</p>
