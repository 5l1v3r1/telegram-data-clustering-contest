      <p>Jose Mourinho's charm offensive has been in overdrive during his whirlwind first few days as manager of Tottenham Hotspur.</p>
      <p>He has lauded the club's training complex as being "second to none" and without comparison across Europe "at any level".</p>
      <p>Mourinho says he has slept in the club's pyjamas at its on-site hotel, which he rates as "six star," with its "soft pillows, amazing duvet".</p>

      <p>Now it's time for a first taste of Tottenham Hotspur Stadium - "the best stadium in the world," he has purred - as the Portuguese continues his quest to win over fans who might still be sceptical about his appointment.</p>
      <p>Getting the team through to the knockout stage of the Champions League wouldn't do him any harm in the ingratiation process.</p>

      <p>Three days after guiding Spurs to a Premier League victory at West Ham United in his first match since replacing Mauricio Pochettino, Mourinho will take charge of them in a home match for the first time when Olympiacos visit on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>A victory guarantees progress out of Group B alongside Bayern Munich with a game to spare.</p>
      <p>It would complete a decent week's work for two-times Champions League winning coach Mourinho as he attempts to rebuild his reputation after a fractious, and ultimately disappointing, two-year spell at Manchester United that ended almost 12 months ago.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere this week, seeking a win to advance along with Juventus in Group D, Atletico Madrid are well aware of the dangers of a rested Cristiano Ronaldo.</p>

      <p>The Juve striker was rested at the weekend, as he continues to recover from a knee issue, with the Italian champions keen to secure top spot in the group on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Borussia Dortmund coach Lucien Favre has little room for error when they visit the Camp Nou on Wednesday to take on Group F leaders Barcelona.</p>
      <p>Both teams are favoured to advance to the last 16 but Inter Milan are also in the mix.</p>
      <p>Real Madrid will seal their progress from Group A by beating Paris Saint- Germain, who have already secured a place in the next phase, on Tuesday.</p>

      <p>Group C leaders Manchester City will advance by beating Shakhtar Donetsk at home on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Champions Liverpool have a one-point lead over Napoli heading into their meeting on Wednesday in Group E, in which Salzburg is a further four points back before they face out-of-contention Genk.</p>
      <p>In Group H, Ajax, Chelsea and Valencia are all on seven points with the Spaniards hosting Frank Lampard's men.</p>
      <p>Leipzig and Lyon can advance from Group G by beating Benfica and Zenit St. Petersburg respectively.</p>
