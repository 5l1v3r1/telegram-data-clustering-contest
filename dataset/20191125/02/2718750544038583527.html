      <h1>Lizzo Brings Big Voice, Tiny Purse to AMAs</h1>

      <p>Lizzo came to the American Music Awards on Sunday night <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2016/05/bob-the-drag-queen-rupauls-drag-race-winner-interview.html"><i>purse first</i></a>, honey! The New Artist of the Year nominee rocked truly the <a href="https://twitter.com/etnow/status/1198750645328601088">smallest purse we’ve ever seen</a> on the red carpet, leading all of us at home to wonder <a href="https://twitter.com/marxwift/status/1198747042169929728">what on earth she could possibly be carrying inside a bag that small</a>. What was hidden inside that tiny, tiny purse, you may ask? A massively powerful voice, of course. Lizzo let loose on a soulful rendition of her Grammy-nominated R&amp;B jam “Jerome,” showing off the full potential of her powerful pipes. From the purse to the voice, it’s abundantly clear: Lizzo has the range.</p>
