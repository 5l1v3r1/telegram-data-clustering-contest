    <meta property="og:description" content="With a record number of residents coming out to vote in Hong Kong's local elections on Sunday, pro-democracy candidates won more than half of the 452 district council seats. Nearly three million people cast their ballots — almost double the number of voters who participated in the last election four years ago — with local media estimating on Monday morning that at least 377 seats were captured by pro-democracy candidates and 52 by pro-establishment candidates. District councils decide on community issues, such as transportation. During the last election, pro-democracy candidates only secured 124 seats, and they received a boost this year thanks to young voters. Over the last six months, Hong Kong has been rocked by anti-government protests, with demonstrators calling for full democracy and an end to Chinese meddling in local affairs. Catherine Garcia"/>
