      <h1>Micro review: 'The Night Fire' by Michael Connelly</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T02:30:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 02:30</time> by <a rel="author">TIMESOFINDIA.COM</a></address>
      <p>'The Night Fire' has Harry Bosch and Renee Ballard working together again to solve another fascinating mystery.</p>
      <p>Our favourite detective starts this book on a low note. His mentor John Jack Thompson has passed away and while he's attending the funeral, Thompson's widow tells him of an old unsolved case and even gives him the file. Renee is working on some cases but gets drawn in easily when she sees the file and they start investigating together. However, they soon realise that the case hasn't been worked for years and begin to question if Thompson took the file home to solve or to hide.</p>
      <p>We see both Harry's and Renee's perspective in alternate chapters as they work the case together and work their individual cases. One of the best things about Connelly is he respects that detectives rarely work one case at a time and realistically balances their time. The characters themselves are familiar and beloved to long time fans, though even a reader unfamiliar with the series can enjoy the book. It's a good book to read when traveling.</p>
