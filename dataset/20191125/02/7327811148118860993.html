      <p>LOS ANGELES -- You can always count on Billy Porter to make an entrance.</p>
      <p>At the American Music Awards on Sunday evening, the actor walked the red carpet in a nearly all-white Thom Browne ensemble that included a white shirt and tie, knee-length coat and wide-legged pants. The outfit included "hints of red, white and blue because I'm an American," Porter later tweeted.</p>

      <p>He also sported a hat designed by Stephen Jones and an Oscar Heyman &amp; Brothers ring.</p>
      <p>Porte later said of his look during the award show while introducing Camila Cabello: "Understated. Low-key. Restrained. That is not how I approach the roles I play or the red carpet. Look at me, I'm an entire mood!"</p>
      <p>Sunday night's outfit was the latest in a string of attention-grabbing red carpet looks for the "Pose" star, who made headlines at the Oscars in a <a href="https://abc7.com/fashion/billy-porter-kicks-off-oscars-red-carpet-in-velvet-tuxedo-gown/5154596/">custom velvet tuxedo gown designed by Christian Siriano</a>.</p>
