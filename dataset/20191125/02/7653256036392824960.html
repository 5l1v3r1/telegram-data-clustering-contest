      <p>SINGAPORE: <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Oil-prices">Oil prices</a> began the week on a brighter note on Monday, posting early gains as positive noises from Washington over the weekend rekindled optimism in global markets that the United States and China could soon sign a deal to end their bitter trade war.</p>
      <p><a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/West-Texas-Intermediate">West Texas Intermediate</a> (WTI) crude rose 10 cents, or 0.17 per cent to $57.87 a barrel by 0220 GMT, having ended last week little changed after tracking ups and downs in the trade talks process.</p>
      <p><a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Brent-crude">Brent crude</a> futures were at $63.46 was up 7 cents, or 0.11 per cent, the benchmark having also finished little changed last week.</p>
      <p>"It is still all about trade talks," said Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets in Sydney. "It seems to be dominating markets action at the moment."</p>
      <p>Monday's higher opening prices came after US national security adviser Robert O'Brien said on Saturday that an initial trade agreement with China is still possible by the end of the year.</p>
      <p>This came a day after both President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping expressed a desire to sign an initial trade deal and defuse a 16-month tariff war that has lowered global growth - though Trump also he had yet to decide whether he wanted to finalise a deal while Xi said he would not be afraid to retaliate when necessary.</p>
      <p>At CMC Markets, strategist McCarthy noted that a move by China to protect intellectual property was also providing a supportive atmosphere for the trade talks.</p>
      <p>"This is a big step forward for potential trade negotiation if they are adopted as official policy," McCarthy said.</p>
      <p>Still, concern remains that events in Hong Kong, riven by months of anti-government unrest, could overshadow trade talk progress.</p>
      <p>US national security adviser O'Brien warned on Saturday that Washington would not turn a blind eye to what happens in Hong Kong, where demonstrators remain angry at what they see as Beijing meddling in freedoms promised to the ex-British colony when it returned to Chinese rule more than 20 years ago.</p>
      <p>Over the weekend, the city's democrats won a landslide and symbolic majority in district council elections.</p>
