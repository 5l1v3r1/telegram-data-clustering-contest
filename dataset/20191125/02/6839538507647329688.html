      <p>It is believed Cleanaway workers were inside the warehouse when it caught alight but had to flee when their efforts to douse the flames were unsuccessful.</p>
      <p>Thick plumes of black smoke have darkened the sky of surrounding suburbs of South Guilford, Ashfield, Bayswater, Morley, Eden Hill and Kiara and the Department of Fire and Emergency Services has issued a smoke alert.</p>
      <p>Air quality in the area is being monitored.</p>

      <p>Hyne Road has been partially closed and people should avoid the area.</p>
