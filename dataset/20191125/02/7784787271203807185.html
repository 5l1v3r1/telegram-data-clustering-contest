      <p>Mitchell had been heavily-linked with a switch to either the Tigers or the Cowboys after meeting with North Queensland officials in Townsville last week.</p>

      <p>On Sunday, however, the Cowboys confirmed Valentine Holmes would be joining the club on a six-year deal. It means they have no space in their salary cap to accommodate the sort of money Mitchell is after.</p>
      <p>But with Tigers in the box seat, having tabled a four-year, $3.8 million offer for Mitchell, a new rival has entered the race.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/nrl/teams/titans/nrl-battlers-gold-coast-titans-join-twoway-fight-for-latrell-mitchell/news-story/82ca56aab15ce00b4e3cd85c3341263f">Daily Telegraph reports </a>NRL basket case Gold Coast Titans want to lure Mitchell north and make him their marquee player.</p>
      <p>While the Titans are yet to meet with Mitchell, head of performance and culture Mal Meninga has publicly declared the club is in the market for a big-name signing as they look to put a disastrous 2019 season behind them.</p>

      <p>Despite the competition, the Tigers are still confident of getting their man. They will grant the 22-year-old hiswish and hand him the No. 1 jersey and believe the club could offer the type of off-field stability to take his game to the next level.</p>
      <p>But there could be a late twist.</p>
      <p>The Tigers fear South Sydney could enter the race at the 11th hour and poach Mitchell from under their noses.</p>
      <p>The Rabbitohs are seeking salary cap compensation following the retirement of Sam Burgess and, if granted, could use the cash to make a play for Mitchell.</p>
      <p>A decision on his future is expected this week.</p>
