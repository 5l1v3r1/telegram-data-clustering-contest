      <p>A landlord who was previously in court for overcrowding a five-bedroom property with up to 70 people has been ordered to pay more than €22,000 in rent arrears and damages.</p>
      <p>Christian Carter - younger brother of Cocoa Brown founder Marissa Carter - was ordered by the Residential Tenancies Board to pay €16,000 in rent arrears for a property in Stillorgan Heath.</p>
      <p>He was also ordered by the RTB to pay €6,225 in damages due to the condition the property had been left in.</p>
      <p>The landlord of the house had been renting it to Mr Carter, who in turn sublet it to a number of foreign nationals.</p>

      <p>Following complaints from neighbours, the landlord sought to end the agreement.</p>
      <p>The landlord - who lives outside Ireland - said she would inspect the property when in Dublin but was never aware how many people were living in her four-bedroom house.</p>
      <p>"Sometimes when I came to inspect my house some bedroom doors were locked so I didn't know who was living there. I then Googled his name and came across an article about him overcrowding houses," the landlord told the Irish Independent.</p>
      <p>The landlord - who wishes to remain anonymous - said she had not yet received the outstanding rent.</p>
      <p>The RTB adjudication report states there was damage to the windows and blinds and a lot of rubbish left on the property.</p>
      <p>Mr Carter did not respond to requests for comment.</p>
      <p>He was previously brought before Dublin Circuit Civil Court after an Irish Independent investigation uncovered a house in Cabinteely overcrowded with up to 70 people.</p>
      <p>Dún Laoghaire/Rathdown County Council found almost every room they could access had been filled with either double or bunk beds, the court heard.</p>
