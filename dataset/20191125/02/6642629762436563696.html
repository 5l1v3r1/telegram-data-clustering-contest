      <p><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/united-states.html">United States</a> Defense Secretary Mark Esper fired the US Navy's top civilian on Sunday over his handling of the case of a Navy SEAL who was convicted of battlefield misconduct in <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/iraq.html">Iraq</a> but later won the support of <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/donald-trump.html">President Donald Trump</a>.</p>
      <p>Navy Secretary Richard Spencer had been pushing for Special Operations Chief Edward Gallagher to face a peer review board that could have led to him being forced out of the elite force.</p>

      <p>The SEAL was <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/07/navy-seal-acquitted-murder-war-crimes-trial-190702234854226.html">acquitted</a> by a military jury in July of murdering a captured and wounded Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (<a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/isis-isil.html">ISIL</a> or ISIS) fighter in Iraq by stabbing him in the neck, but it convicted him of illegally posing with the detainee's corpse.</p>
      <p>That had led to him being demoted.</p>
      <p>Trump who had intervened in Gallagher's case to restore his rank cheered the moves.</p>
      <p>"Eddie will retire peacefully with all of the honors that he has earned, including his Trident Pin," Trump said on Twitter.</p>
      <p>Esper determined that Gallagher should also be allowed to retain the so-called Trident pin that designates him a SEAL, effectively ending the Navy's efforts to carry out the review.</p>
      <h3>'Good order and discipline'</h3>
      <p>The White House said in November that Trump had restored Gallagher's rank and had pardoned two Army officers accused of war crimes in Afghanistan.</p>
      <p>Critics said such actions would undermine military justice and send a message that battlefield atrocities would be tolerated.</p>

      <p>In a letter published in media reports, Spencer took parting shots at Trump and defended the need to preserve "good order and discipline throughout the ranks" - something Navy officials had believed the peer review board would help ensure.</p>
      <p>"The rule of law is what sets us apart from our adversaries," Spencer wrote, according to the reports.</p>
      <p>"Unfortunately it has become apparent that in this respect, I no longer share the same understanding with the Commander in Chief who appointed me."</p>
      <p>The Pentagon declined to immediately provide a copy of Spencer's letter.</p>
      <p>However, Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman offered a different version of events leading up to Spencer's dismissal, saying Spencer also had a private line of communications with the White House.</p>
      <p>"Secretary Spencer had previously and privately proposed to the White House - contrary to Spencer's public position - to restore Gallagher's rank and allow him to retire with his Trident pin," Hoffman said.</p>
      <p>Spencer never informed Esper of his private proposal, Hoffman said.</p>
      <p>Esper decided to ask for Spencer's resignation after "losing trust and confidence in him regarding his lack of candour over conversations with the White House," Hoffman said.</p>
      <p>Esper had favoured letting the review process "play itself out objectively and deliberately, in fairness to all parties," Hoffman said. But that now appeared impossible.</p>
      <p>"At this point, given the events of the last few days, Secretary Esper has directed that Gallagher retain his Trident pin," Hoffman said.</p>
