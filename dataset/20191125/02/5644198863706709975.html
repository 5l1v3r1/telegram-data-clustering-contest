      <p>Roberto Bautista Agut gave hosts Spain a flying start in the Davis Cup final against Canada when he beat Felix Auger-Aliassime 7-6(3) 6-2 on Sunday, the day after the death of his father.</p>
      <p>MADRID: Roberto Bautista Agut gave hosts Spain a flying start in the Davis Cup final against Canada when he beat Felix Auger-Aliassime 7-6(3) 6-2 on Sunday, the day after the death of his father.</p>
      <p>The 31-year-old played in both of Spain's Group B ties earlier in the week but left the camp for his home town of Castellon on Wednesday evening after father Joaquin's health deteriorated rapidly.</p>

      <p>Bautista Agut returned to Madrid and was seen supporting his team mates during Saturday's thrilling semi-final win against Britain and was named by Sergi Brugera to face Canada.</p>
      <p>With a partisan capacity crowd inside La Caja Magica roaring his every winner, the world number nine responded with a clinical performance, dominating the contest once he had pocketed a tense opener.</p>
      <p>When Auger-Aliassime hooked a backhand wide on match point Bautista Agut was hugged by Brugera before being embraced by his team mates on the Spanish bench.</p>
      <p>Canadian captain Frank Dancevic changed his team for the first time all week after Vasek Pospisil and Denis Shapovalov had produced heroics to get Canada to their first final.</p>
      <p>But the gamble backfired as Auger-Aliassime, who has been out with an ankle injury, failed to produce the kind of tennis that has seen him surge up the rankings this year.</p>
      <p>Several hundred Canadian fans ringing cowbells and blowing horns tried to lift their man but to no avail.</p>
      <p>Shapovalov will now have to beat Rafael Nadal in the second singles later on Sunday to keep Canada alive in the final.</p>
      <p>Victory for Nadal, who has won all seven rubbers he has played this week, will give Spain a sixth title and their first since 2011. Nadal has won his last 28 Davis Cup singles, losing only once, in his first tie in 2014.</p>
