      <h1>Wheat up for 2nd session on lower U.S. planting; soybeans rebound from 8-week low</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T02:10:53+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 02:10</time> by <a rel="author">Naveen Thukral</a></address>
      <p>SINGAPORE — Chicago wheat futures rose for a second straight session on</p>
      <p>Monday, underpinned by lower planting in the United States and a decline in Australia’s production.</p>
      <p>Soybeans edged higher, but the market was trading not far from Friday’s eight-week low, weighed</p>
      <p>down by doubts over a U.S.-China trade deal and improved weather in South America.</p>
      <p>The most-active wheat contract on the Chicago Board Of Trade (CBOT) was up 0.2% at</p>
      <p>$5.19-3/4 a bushel, as of 0201 GMT.</p>
      <p>Soybeans added 0.1% to $8.97-1/2 a bushel after hitting their lowest since Sept. 30 at</p>
      <p>$8.96 a bushel on Friday, while corn was flat at $3.68-3/4 a bushel.</p>
      <p>Wheat is being supported by short-covering coupled with worries about a drop in U.S. wheat</p>
      <p>acres. The slow pace of the U.S. corn and soybean harvest this autumn may have limited the number</p>
      <p>of winter wheat acres planted for harvest in 2020.</p>
      <p>U.S. farmers planted 45.2 million acres of wheat overall for 2019, the fewest in U.S.</p>
      <p>Department of Agriculture records dating to 1919.</p>
      <p>The soybean market is facing pressure because of uncertainty about prospects for a preliminary</p>
      <p>U.S. trade deal with China, the top global soybean importer.</p>
      <p>“U.S. China trade negotiations are still going on,” said Tobin Gorey, director of agricultural</p>
      <p>strategy at Commonwealth Bank of Australia.</p>
      <p>“A few events over the weekend are worth noting. China’s Foreign Minister (at G20 summit)</p>
      <p>expressed China’s irritation with the U.S., labeling the U.S. ‘the world’s biggest destabilizing</p>
      <p>factor.’ The U.S. is clearly succeeding in disrupting China.”</p>
      <p>Reports last week suggested that the initial deal could be delayed to 2020.</p>
      <p>U.S. President Donald Trump, however, told Fox News that a deal was “potentially very close,”</p>
      <p>adding to optimism following remarks by Chinese President Xi Jinping that Beijing wanted to work</p>
      <p>out an initial agreement.</p>
      <p>There was additional pressure on the soybean market as forecasts called for beneficial rains in</p>
      <p>crop areas of Brazil and Argentina, the world’s No. 1 and No. 3 producers. The United States is the</p>
      <p>No. 2 soybean grower.</p>
      <p>Soybean plantings for the new Brazilian crop (2019-20) have reached 77.3% of the expected area</p>
      <p>to be planted with the oilseed, a slower pace than seen last year and also lagging the five-year</p>
      <p>average for the period.</p>
      <p>Large speculators increased their net short position in CBOT corn futures in the week to Nov.</p>
      <p>19, regulatory data released on Friday showed.</p>
      <p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s weekly commitments of traders report also showed</p>
      <p>that non-commercial traders, a category that includes hedge funds, trimmed their net short position</p>
      <p>in CBOT wheat and increased their net short position in soybeans.</p>
