      <p>Jerry Jones came into the 2019 season hoping for a different season from his franchise, but the more things change, the more they stay the same.</p>
      <p>Even though the Dallas Cowboys owner gave head coach Jason Garrett a vote of confidence for the remainder of the season, his anger was evident after the Cowboys suffered a 13-9 defeat to the New England Patriots on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Cowboys was upset at the special teams and specifically called out the coaching staff.</p>

      <p>“With the makeup of this team, I shouldn’t be this frustrated,” Jones also said, via the team’s official website. Which is another way of saying, “We have the talent, so talent isn’t the problem.”</p>

      <p>This would be the second time in three weeks where special teams play likely cost them a win, with the other coming against the Minnesota Vikings.</p>
      <p>The only thing saving the Cowboys right now is how terribly bad the rest of the NFC East teams are.</p>
