      <h1>Chandigarh: Mayor seat reserved for woman candidate this time, race hots up between BJP councillors</h1>
      <h2>As the BJP has a majority in the General House with 20 councillors, women councillors have already started lobbying for the seat.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T02:15:27+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 02:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/profile/author/hina-rohtaki/" target="_blank">Hina Rohtaki</a></address>
      <p>IT WILL be <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/bjp/">BJP</a> vs BJP in the mayoral elections, yet again. With just a month left for the mayoral elections, the race for the coveted post has intensified. This time, the seat is reserved for a woman candidate and each of the woman councillors in the race has begun using the “clean image” card.</p>
      <p>As the BJP has a majority in the General House with 20 councillors, women councillors have already started lobbying for the seat. Those in the fray are BJP councillors Raj Bala Malik, Heera Negi, Sunita Dhawan and Chanderwati Shukla. Even as Asha Jaswal has been the mayor in 2017, she is still eyeing another chance.</p>
      <p>The contest is between the councillors holding allegiance to city BJP chief Sanjay Tandon and MP Kirron Kher.</p>
      <p>While speaking to <a href="https://indianexpress.com/elections/chandigarh-lok-sabha-election-results/">Chandigarh</a> Newsline, Shukla did not reveal anything but said, “If party gives me a chance, I will surely contest. I am the only woman councillor who doesn’t have any allegation against her. I have been clean during my tenure.”</p>
      <p>Shukla was initially close to Tandon but of late as the mayoral elections are nearing, her closeness to Kher has increased too. Next in line is BJP councillor Raj Bala Malik. Malik switched to the BJP from the Congress in 2014. She remained the mayor in 2012 from the Congress.</p>
      <p>During her stint as mayor, Malik was known for her tough dealing and straightforward approach. She did not shy away from saying bluntly anything which was true.</p>
      <p>When contacted, she said, “If party gives me a chance, I will definitely adhere to the party’s directions.” Heera Negi, who is quite close to MP Kher, too, is in the race. She had tried hard to be the mayor even during the previous term.</p>
      <p>In 2015, Negi was pitted against Congress candidate Poonam Sharma but the former lost the mayoral poll. In 2016, a statement from the BJP came which stated that fielding Negi was a mistake. Negi had then complained to the high command about the fact that she was being maligned.</p>
      <p>In 2017 again in the elections of Finance and Contract Committee, Negi lost despite the BJP being in majority. She had at that time been vocal in saying that those councillors were responsible for her loss that was holding allegiance to Tandon.</p>
      <p>Asked if she was in the race, Negi said, “I can’t say that I am in the race. Being in the party, every person has aspirations. But whatever party will say, I will adhere to it. I know all my other fellow women councillors are also in the race but I will agree with whatever the high command decides.”</p>
      <p>BJP councillor Asha Jaswal has already been the mayor in 2017. In 2018 when Davesh Moudgil from BJP leader Satya Pal Jain’s camp was being fielded for the mayor’s post, she had gone against the party to file nomination independently. However, she later withdrew it.<br/>Sunita Dhawan too is in the fray. She is from Tandon’s camp. Dhawan has not been in controversies so far.</p>
      <p>A mayor holds a one-year term in Chandigarh. A mayor is elected from amongst the elected representatives in the General House. To become a mayor, a candidate needs 14 votes out of 27. The nine nominated councillors do not have voting rights. One vote is that of MP Kher who is the ex-officio member of the House. Of the 26 elected councillors, the BJP has a majority in the Chandigarh Municipal Corporation with 20 councillors. There are five Congress councillors while one is from the SAD, which is in an alliance with the BJP.</p>
