        <b>The Democratic presidential field just grew larger, as billionaire and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg announced earlier on Sunday his entry into the 2020 US presidential race as a Democrat.</b>
      </p>
      <p>US Democratic Senator and 2020 presidential candidate Bernie <a href="https://sputniknews.com/columnists/201910181077079946-our-world-not-just-america-needs-bernie-sanders/">Sanders immediately put pressure</a> on Bloomberg, asserting that billionaires will not last long in the US 2020 presidential race.</p>
      <blockquote>"We do not believe that billionaires have the right to buy elections, and that is why we are going to overturn Citizens United, that is why multi-billionaires like Mr. Bloomberg are not going to get very far in this election, that is why we are going to end voter suppression in America," the Senator said during a Sunday campaign event in Hillsboro, New Hampshire.</blockquote>
      <p>Sanders later took to Twitter, affirming that nothing scares “the billionaire class more than a strong union movement”. Sanders added that <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201910181077077758-new-poll-shows-sanders-beats-trump-in-iowa-while-biden-warren-lose/">he and his supporters will “fight</a> for a union for every worker”.</p>

      <p>Earlier on Sunday, <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201911241077389944-bloomberg-launches-bid-for-2020-democratic-presidential-nomination/">Bloomberg announced that he would join</a> the race to win the Democratic Party’s nomination to run for president in 2020, in a bid to “defeat Donald Trump and rebuild America”, despite previous statements in March in which the ex-mayor said he would not run, suggesting instead that the Democratic Party "nominate a Democrat who will be in the strongest position to defeat Trump".</p>
