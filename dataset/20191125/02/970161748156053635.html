      <p>They might have chosen to rock up solo on the AMAs red carpet, but <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/shawn-mendes/">Shawn Mendes</a> and Camila Cabello proved they are still very much hot for each other during their performance at the awards.</p>
      <p>The couple, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/12/camila-cabello-and-shawn-mendes-cant-keep-their-hands-or-their-lips-to-themselves-on-courtside-date-11083242/">who have basically now become known for their NSFW public displays of affection</a>, didn’t seem to care who was watching (just an entire theatre full of people and the whole of the US) as they performed their hit Senorita.</p>
      <p>There’s no denying their chemistry, right?</p>

      <p>Shawn and Camila took to the stage and pretty much couldn’t keep their hands off each other, with some of the celebs in the crowd not quite sure where to look.</p>

      <p>You’ve all seen their steamy video for the track, right? Well, the AMAs pretty much got their own version on stage, as <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/camila-cabello-feelings-shawn-mendes-since-2015-smiles-heading-vocal-coach-11186182/">the real life couple</a> got all touchy feely while simultaneously slaying their vocals.</p>
      <p>And it seems fans love a love story, as the pair won the award for Collaboration of the Year for teaming up on Senorita – beating out the likes of Lil Nas X and Billy Ray Cyrus and Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga.</p>
      <p>Their performance came after Shawn and Camila decided to both arrive solo to the awards, earlier in the evening.</p>

      <p>Hitting the red carpet alone, Shawn looked super suave in a purple suit blazer and trousers, while Camila stunned in a nude dress fit for a princess.</p>
      <p>Just hours before her AMAs appearance, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/25/camila-cabello-channels-inner-fairy-nymph-steamy-new-music-video-ahead-amas-performance-11212602/">Camila dropped the music video for her new track Living Proof</a> and urged fans to take a look at the steamy video that sees her channel her inner fairy nymph. Watch it and you’ll know exactly what we mean.</p>
      <p>She also performed Living Proof at the AMAs, stepping back on to the stage later on in the show.</p>
