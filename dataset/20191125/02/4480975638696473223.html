      <h1>Oil news: US energy-related high yield bond spread hits highest since 2016</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T02:10:15+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 02:10</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fxstreet.com/author/omkar-godbole" target="_blank">Omkar Godbole</a></address>
      <p>The US energy-related high yield bond spread has widened to 826 basis points, the highest level since 2016, Jeroen Blokland,  Portfolio Manager for the Robeco Multi-Asset funds, Robeco ONE and Robeco Pension Return Portfolio, <a href="https://twitter.com/jsblokland/status/1198705366764269569">tweeted</a> on Monday. </p>
      <p>Back then, spreads had risen amid the sell-off in oil prices. The black <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/markets/commodities/metals/gold">gold</a> had dropped below $30 in early 2016. </p>
      <p>This time, however, the spreads are widening amid the rise in oil prices. For instance, WTI oil rose to $58.71 per barrel on Friday, representing a 15% rise on the low of $51.03 registered on Oct. 3.<br/> </p>
