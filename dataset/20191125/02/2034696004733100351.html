      <p>The pop star is nominated for six awards at the ceremony and has won two at the time of writing – Favourite Artist – Alternative Rock and New Artist Of The Year.</p>
      <p>Eilish was introduced on stage by <a href="http://nme.com/artists/tyler-the-creator">Tyler, The Creator</a>, who told those in attendance at the ceremony: “Earlier this year, my album ‘Igor’ was the number one album in the country. And then this 17-year-old girl who dressed like a quarterback decided to change that.”</p>

      <p>The singer was joined for her performance by her brother and collaborator Finneas and a live drummer. The stage was lit by bursts of flames as they performed the track from Eilish’s debut album <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/billie-eilish-album-review-when-we-all-fall-asleep-where-do-we-go">‘When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?’</a>.
