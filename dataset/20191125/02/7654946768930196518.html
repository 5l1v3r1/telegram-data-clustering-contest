      <p>Mayor Bill de Blasio and his schools chancellor, Richard Carranza, keep playing their race-baiting games with our schools. Yet somehow they’re surprised when racist discourse <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/20/carranza-keeps-treating-his-minority-critics-like-theyre-un-persons/">spills out of their administration</a>.</p>
      <p>Last week, de Blasio issued the blandest possible statement about offensive comments made by Jackie Cody, a member of a city schools advisory board. Cody had referred to Asians as “yellow folks” in a group e-mail.</p>
      <p>“It sounds very insensitive to me,” Hizzoner said. “It’s not something I think anyone should say.” He then added: “I think if the chancellor hears about it, knowing the chancellor, immediately the chancellor would say that’s inappropriate and wrong, and that individual should apologize.”</p>
      <p>Except — whoops! — Cody had made the comments back in September, and the chancellor didn’t do any of that. At the time Department of Education spokesman Will Mantell shot back: “This was an unacceptable comment made by one parent on a message board, and it has nothing to do with the chancellor.”</p>
      <p>Sorry. It has ­everything to do with the chancellor — and also the mayor.</p>
      <p>Carranza and de Blasio <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/20/group-backing-specialized-high-school-exams-calls-richard-carranza-thin-skinned/">have set the tone of the conversation about schools</a>. People who agree with their race-obsessed proposals are “us,” and anyone who disagrees is “them.” And the thems must be minimized and ­destroyed as racists or idle rich people who don’t care about kids.</p>
      <p>Lucas Liu, a member of Community Education Council 3, said about Cody’s comments: “I think this is representative of the environment Carranza has created. It’s a toxic racial environment pitting parents against each other.” Precisely.</p>
      <p>Carranza stoked racial animus to bully and harass Asians into ­accepting his proposed changes at specialized schools and elsewhere, many of which would come at Asians’ expense — like getting rid of gifted-and-talented programs and screening.</p>
      <p>Liu added that Carranza “has successfully intimidated white families into not speaking up by playing the race card but failed to achieve the same success with Asian families.”</p>
      <p>Carranza openly smeared white parents unhappy with his vision as “racists.”</p>
      <p>In April, he said that anyone who supports the 1971 legislation that created the Specialized High School Admission Test is “supporting a racist law.” The same month, Carranza accused a member of the parent advisory board of using “coded language” when the parent wondered if the specialized schools would experience a drop in quality if admissions standards were changed.</p>
      <p>Then, when it became clear that Asian parents were also deeply concerned, ­administration cronies like Matt Gonzales, a member of de Blasio’s School Diversity Advisory Group, began referring to Asians as “white adjacent.”</p>
      <p>If they didn’t have the race card to play, our leaders might have to actually listen to parents who want the best for all children. And they would have to work on fixing failing schools instead of rearranging the functioning schools in the name of “integration.”</p>
      <p>Councilman Brad Lander — last seen dispatching protesters to a panel in which he was participating, except he accidentally sent them to the wrong location — published a column last week heralding the integration changes in District 15 middle schools, which involved making the system lottery-based.</p>
      <p>Lander wrote that the district didn’t see a drop in white ­enrollment — therefore, success! He didn’t mention a disastrous 7 percent drop in overall enrollment, because that would have exposed that it isn’t just white people who have a problem with the changes.</p>
      <p>As education writer Alina ­Adams told me: “We don’t know how the newly unscreened schools will perform in the coming years and whether that will cause the predicted ‘white flight.’ But, most importantly, why assume that only white families are concerned about the education offered to their children by public schools? ­African-Americans have the highest proportional opt-out rate from their zoned schools of any racial group.”</p>
      <p>Carranza &amp; Co. already had egg on their faces in August when a proposed plan to “integrate” Carroll Gardens elementary schools and rezone kids had to be postponed after ­minority communities opposed it. ­Because the black and brown parents couldn’t easily be called “racist” like the white and Asian ones had been, the plan was quietly shelved.</p>
      <p>Our schools are bad and getting worse, and Team Blas’ only ­response is to deflect and hurl false racism charges, pitting different communities against each other. It won’t work. New York parents of all races are better, and smarter, than that.</p>
