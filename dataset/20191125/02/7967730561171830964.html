      <p>A woman accusing Chinese movie star Yunxiang Gao and his producer Jing Wang of rape threw the pair "under the bus" after her "insecure" husband confronted her about returning home in the early hours of the morning, a jury has heard.</p>
      <p>Defence barrister Margaret Cunneen, SC, told the NSW District Court the "mature", "corporate" woman had sought the company of both men during a wrap party for a television shoot in March last year and had "enjoyed a triumphant night out" with the pair.</p>

      <p>"This wasnâ€™t the case of some young teenage girl whose head was turned and got out of her depth," Ms Cunneen told the jury during her closing remarks on Monday. "This was a mature woman who's used to being in control ... she does as she deems fit."</p>
      <p>The woman, who was known professionally to the two men and who cannot be named, accused the actor and producer of raping her in suite in the Shangri-La Hotel in The Rocks early on March 27, following a party at a CBD karaoke bar the night before.</p>
      <p>The men, both 37, say the sexual activity was consensual and have pleaded not guilty to a raft of sexual-assault-related charges.</p>
      <p>The woman claimed she refused Mr Wang's unwanted advances at the club, but Ms Cunneen said the pair spent several hours "cosying up together".</p>
      <p>"On this night there are novel and exciting factors in play for [the woman], which meant she could put the mundane and hum-hum routine out of her life for a while," she said.</p>
      <p>In his closing address, Crown prosecutor Sean Hughes told the jury the woman was an "honest and credible" witness who had been trapped in the hotel room by the pair and forced to perform sexual acts.</p>
      <p>He said bruising on her thighs was caused by Mr Wang "being forceful with her, because he knew she was not, in fact, freely and voluntarily consenting" rather than by her husband roughly examining her, as the defence had argued.</p>

      <p>The woman said in evidence her husband wasn't angry with her but worried by her late return, but Ms Cunneen said this was contradicted by the husband's call to Mr Wang's business partner that morning in which he yelled "f--k you".</p>
      <p>She said the woman's lie assumed a "life of its own" from which there was no retreating, and she forsook the truth for her "domestic security".</p>
      <p>"As soon as there is some threat to that, these men can be thrown under the bus, and were," she said.</p>
      <p>"She took the soft option, ladies and gentlemen: blame someone else to save yourself. It was the easiest way to get out of trouble and she pointed the finger."</p>
      <p>Ms Cunneen said the woman knew she was going to see both men in the hotel room and cancelled the taxi she had booked as Mr Gao walked into the suite.</p>
      <p>"This was a once in a lifetime event," Ms Cunneen said. "She wasn't going to miss it".</p>
      <p>The trial continues.</p>
