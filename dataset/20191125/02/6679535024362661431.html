      <p>North Korea says leader Kim Jong Un has visited a frontline island and ordered troops there to practice firing artillery.</p>
      <p>The North’s Korean Central News Agency said Monday that the firing happened when Mr. Kim inspected a military unit on Changrin Islet near the disputed sea boundary with South Korea.</p>
      <p>It was Mr. Kim’s first known visit to frontline troops since he entered nuclear talks with the United States last year.</p>
      <p>Those talks remains stalled since Mr. Kim’s second summit with President Donald Trump in February.</p>
      <p>KCNA says Mr. Kim ordered artillery troops to fire before indicating the target for them. It says the troops “fully showed their gun firing skills” and “delighted the supreme leader.”</p>
      <p>Seoul’s Defense Ministry expressed regret over the drills, saying they violated last year’s tension-reduction deals between the Koreas.</p>
