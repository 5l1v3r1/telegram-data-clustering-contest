      <h1>Yankees bust Greg Bird could get chance to save career with Red Sox</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T02:28:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 02:28</time> by <a rel="author">George A. King III</a></address>
      <p>Even when Greg Bird was shelved in mid-April with a torn left plantar fascia, it was very difficult to believe Mike Ford would be on the Yankees’ 40-man roster and Bird <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/20/greg-birds-time-with-yankees-is-also-over/">would be designated for assignment last week.</a></p>
      <p>With a choice to retain one of the left-handed hitting first basemen, the Yankees went with Ford, who they got back from the Mariners after they selected him in the Rule 5 draft. The Yankees also have the right-handed Luke Voit to play first in 2020.</p>
      <p>The move meant the Yankees had 10 days to trade or release the 27-year-old Bird. Ten days out from this past Wednesday is next Sunday.</p>
      <p>So, where does Bird land? That depends on whom you ask.</p>
      <p>While it’s not a silly idea to predict Bird will return to the Yankees on a minor league deal, that likely won’t happen. With Justin Smoak (Toronto Blue Jays) and Mitch Moreland (Boston Red Sox) free agents, those clubs could be interested in Bird. Colorado, which is where Bird is from, has one more year on Daniel Murphy’s contract and could view Bird as a future piece. Bird would be a good fit for the rebuilding Orioles, but they have the impossible-to-trade Chris Davis signed for three more years and $69 million.</p>
      <p>Opinions from talent evaluators who have followed Bird since he was a fifth-round pick in 2011 ranged from the left-handed hitter getting a major league contract to someone who will need to prove he can remain healthy on a minor league deal that would include a June 1 opt-out clause.</p>
      <p>“Because of the injury history, I would think he gets a minor league deal,’’ a scout said. “And because he is a one-position player I believe he will get more interest from the American League clubs than the National League.’’</p>
      <p>Ah, the injury history. You can’t talk about Bird without it dominating the conversation. After opening eyes in 2015 when he filled in for Mark Teixeira and hit 11 homers, drove in 31 runs, batted .261 and posted a .871 OPS in 46 games and stamped himself as the Yankees’ first baseman of the future, Bird hasn’t been able to stay on the field.</p>
      <p>Right shoulder surgery cost him the entire 2016 season. Surgeries on his right ankle limited Bird to a combined 130 games in 2017 and 2018. The Yankees’ Opening Day first baseman this past season when he homered, Bird went on the injured list on April 16 after playing in 10 games and was never seen again.</p>
      <p>“The injuries can’t be ignored, but I think he will get a big-league deal,’’ a second scout said of Bird, who played briefly this offseason in the Dominican Winter League. “He is still young enough.’’</p>
      <p>A third scout said Bird will draw interest from several teams because should he stay healthy, he can knock off the rust.</p>
      <p>“Sign him and let him go play and figure it out,’’ said the scout who referenced Michael Brantley, who played in a combined 101 games for the Indians in 2016-17 and hit .292 with nine homers, 59 RBIs and posted a .776 OPS due to injuries. Brantley then played 291 games for the Indians and Astros from 2018 to 2019 and hit .310 with 39 homers, 166 RBIs and a .854 OPS.</p>
