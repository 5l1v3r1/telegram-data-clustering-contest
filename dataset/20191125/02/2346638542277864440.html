      <p><b>Abbott</b>’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical Products industry year to date (+15.8% vs. +12.2%).

      <p>Abbott has been in news within Diabetic Care on growth with FreeStyle Libre. Also, solid contributions from Diagnostics were encouraging on double-digit growth in core laboratory. Within Structural Heart, worldwide uptake of MitraClip improved further. Meanwhile, emerging market performance has been promising. Abbott exited third-quarter 2019 on a mixed note with earnings meeting estimates and revenues missing the same.</p>
      <p>Abbott has narrowed its EPS guidance for 2019. Abbott's international performance was dented by increasing currency headwinds and lower non-governmental organization purchases in Africa.</p>

      <p>Shares of <b>Philip Morris </b>have gained 6% in the past three months against the Zacks Tobacco industry’s rise of 5.2%. The Zacks analyst believes that Efficient pricing and gains from growth of IQOS in RRPs arena have remained as upsides for the company.</p>
      <p>These factors had a positive impact on third-quarter results, with earnings and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Also, earnings improved year on year. We note that the company is on track with investments to bolster presence in the RRPs space.</p>
      <p>However, the company has been facing persistent sluggishness in the cigarette category. During the third quarter, cigarette shipment volumes declined 5.9% while overall revenues from combustible products slipped 5.7%. Moreover, unfavorable currency movements are a threat.</p>

      <p><b>Lowe's </b>shares have gained 23.9% over the past six months against the Zacks Building Products - Retail industry's rise of 15.6%. The Zacks analyst believes that strong macroeconomic landscape along with constant efforts to enhance customers’ experience, solid performance of the merchandise category and strength in the Pro business bode well.</p>
      <p>The stock received a boost when it reported third-quarter fiscal 2019 results, wherein earnings grew year over year and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Moreover, comps in the quarter increased, driven by solid performance in its U.S. home improvement stores. Strong macroeconomic landscape along with constant efforts to enhance customers’ experience, solid performance of the merchandise category and strength in the Pro business also bode well.</p>
      <p>Further, efforts to enhance online business led to robust comps growth in lowes.com. Encouragingly, management raised adjusted earnings guidance for fiscal 2019. However, high level of debt for the past few quarters may act as a deterrent. Also, the company is exposed to competition.</p>
