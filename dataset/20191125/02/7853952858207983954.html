      <p>China said on Sunday that it will seek to improve protections for intellectual property rights, including raising the upper limits for compensation for rights infringements.</p>
      <p>An opinion document released by the State Council and Communist Party’s Central Office on Sunday evening called for a strengthening of protections through both the civil and criminal justice systems and an effective enforcement of penalties, Reuters reports.</p>
      <p>The upper limits on legal compensation should be raised substantially, the document said.</p>
      <p>By 2022, China should be making progress in issues that have affected intellectual property rights enforcement, such as low compensation, high costs, and the difficulty of proof, it said.</p>
      <p>By 2025, there should be a better system of protection in place.</p>
