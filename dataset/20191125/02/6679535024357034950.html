      <p>Taylor Swift tied Michael Jackson’s record at the American Music Awards as she collected her 24th win and used her speech to thank her record label for allowing her to freely express herself as an artist.</p>
      <p>Swift won favorite pop/rock album for “Lover,” her first release on Universal Music Group’s Republic Records. She released her first six albums on Big Machine Label Group, founded by Scott Borchetta, who owns Swift’s master recordings along with music manager Scooter Braun.</p>
      <p>"This album really felt like a new beginning, and I also really love my record label, Universal and Republic. Monte Lipman, Lucian Grange, thank you for being so generous to me and allowing me to make whatever music I want to make,” she said onstage. “As a songwriter it’s so thrilling to me that I get to keep doing that. And I’m so excited I get to perform for you all later.”</p>
      <p>That performance Swift was speaking of was put in jeopardy by Borchetta and Braun, she said in a Nov. 15 social media post. Swift beat out albums by Billie Eilish and Ariana Grande, who is managed by Braun.</p>

      <p>Eilish was also a winner, taking home the first televised award of the night - favorite alternative artist. "You made it all happen, man,” Eilish said as she thanked her fans. “I’m like shaking.”</p>
      <p>Selena Gomez kicked off the AMAs as Swift and Halsey got out of their seats to cheer their pal on. Gomez, sounding pitchy at times, performed her No. 1 hit “Lose You to Love Me,” and stripped down from her dress to a shiny bodysuit to finish the performance with the upbeat song “Look at Her Now,” as audience members, including country singer Kelsea Ballerini, sang along.</p>
