      <p>Taylor Swift and Selena Gomez shut down the American Music Awards red carpet on Sunday, stunning in two green gowns ahead of their performances on stage. See which musicians join Swift and Gomez on <i>The Hollywood Reporter</i>'s list of the 12 most memorable fashion looks at the 2019 AMAs (hint: three of them were named this week as some of the <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/meghan-markle-timothee-chalamet-named-2019-influential-stars-fashion-1255728">most influential stars</a> in fashion). </p>

      <p>Swift broke away from her pastel-hued <i>Lover </i>era and <a href="https://edit.hollywoodreporter.com/news/why-taylor-swifts-amas-outfit-will-be-a-big-statement-1257006">threw it back</a> to her <i>Reputation</i> days with an asymmetrical, custom Julien Macdonald dress and thigh-high boots. The olive green gown brought to mind the sparkly, snake-y style from her last album, which was all about managing her public image. It was fitting that Swift, named Artist of the Decade, rocked a darker glam aesthetic for the AMAs, which took place just days after she <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/taylor-swift-big-machine-reach-deal-amas-performance-1255740">settled a public feud</a> with her former record label, Big Machine. </p>

      <p>Look at her now — Gomez wowed in a strapless, lime Versace minidress with plenty of bling, thanks to that Roberto Coin Cento diamond necklace. "The most brilliant star on the red carpet tonight," the jeweler wrote on Instagram. Last month when Gomez debuted her two new singles and a <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/selena-gomezs-style-team-lose-you-love-me-look-at-her-now-looks-1249817">"strong sexy" sense of style</a>, her stylist, Kate Young, told <i>THR, </i>"We're just beginning!"</p>
      <p>
        <b>Lizzo</b>
      </p>

      <p>Proving Barbie comes in any size, Lizzo carried the micro-bag to end all micro-bags at the AMAs. Her doll-sized purse upped the attitude of her custom one-shouldered, ruffled Valentino dress. "Iconic orange," stylist Marko Monroe wrote on Instagram. "So proud of this angel for always being ready to put the *wink* back into the red carpet." In addition to the Valentino bag, Monroe added Stuart Weitzman's white patent Aleena mules, Lorraine Schwartz jewelry and Ofira jewels. "Bag big enough for my fucks to give," Lizzo wrote. "Big body bitch in a Valentin-HO custom look." </p>
      <p>
        <b>Ciara</b>
      </p>

      <p>Stylist Maeve Reilly, who also dresses Hailey Bieber, kicked off host Ciara's night of fashion with a blue, flared Balmain suit with turquoise jewelry. Reilly accessorized with Giuseppe Zanotti shoes and Jacquie Aiche's turquoise drop earrings. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Billie Eilish</b>
      </p>

      <p>A new Grammy record-setter, Eilish took to the AMAs red carpet in an authentic Burberry ensemble (unlike the Louis Vuitton knock-off she wore to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/memorable-performance-looks-coachella-weekend-1-1202338">Coachella</a>). The "Bad Guy" singer sported a Burberry Vintage oversized tee featuring crystal mesh sleeves, along with wide-leg trousers and a matching crystal mesh bonnet with a veil that was almost <i>Handmaid's Tale</i> meets beekeeper. </p>

        <b>Shawn Mendes</b>

      <p>Mendes dared to experiment beyond a black tux for the ceremony, wearing a deep purple Paul Smith suit with teal lapels. His V-neck showed off his layered boho necklaces. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Camila Cabello</b>
      </p>

      <p>The "Senorita" singer went with a nude color palette in an Oscar de la Renta dress that the fashion house describes as "ethereal eveningwear," featuring tulle embroidered with raffia. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Billy Porter</b>
      </p>

      <p>"I’m giddy about this one," wrote stylist Sam Ratelle on Instagram. Always one to embrace bold fashion choices, <i>Pose</i> star Porter wore a Thom Browne outfit with a Stephen Jones Millinery statement hat and Oscar Heyman ring on Sunday.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Christina Aguilera</b>
      </p>

      <p>Aguilera turned heads with her strong-shouldered regal gown from Jean Paul Gaultier. The fall/winter 2017 couture outfit included an embellished hood, oversized shoulders and white buckled belt.  </p>
      <p>
        <b>Alyson Stoner</b>
      </p>

      <p>The dancer and actor dazzled in one of the night's most expensive ensembles — a $2.4 million suit by Malan Breton decked out in Swarovski crystals (it took six months to stitch each gemstone into the silk). Under the spring/summer 2020 suit, which was inspired by the ballet <i>Giselle</i>, Stoner wore a metallic top by stylist Graham Cruz. </p>

        <b>Post Malone</b>
