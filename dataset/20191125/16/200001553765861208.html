      <h1>Newcastle United official in Portugal at the weekend – Potential transfer planning ahead of window</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T16:33:55+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 16:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/author/lucas-sposito/" target="_blank">Lucas Sposito</a></address>
      <p>Newcastle United were one of the clubs who had scouts watching Porto’s 4-0 win over Vitória de Setúbal on Sunday night.</p>
      <p>Newspaper <a href="http://record.xl.pt/">Record </a>reports the Magpies’ visit to the Estádio do Dragão, and it hasn’t been the first time they had officials watching the Portuguese side this season.</p>
      <p>Former Magpies defender Chancel Mbemba opened the scoring for the home side. Fabio Silva scored another, then Jubal helped Porto with an own goal, before Marega got the fourth.</p>
      <p>Marega is a player who’s been linked to Newcastle for a long time now, but the last market was one more summer the club didn’t make an attempt to sign him, <a href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/clubs-reasonable-e30m-demands-werent-enough-entice-west-ham-newcastle-bid-forward/">even though he’d been available for €30m.</a></p>

      <p>With only four goals this season so far, the striker hasn’t been as impressive as in other years. And since he’s 28, it’s becoming less likely he’ll ever make the move to the Premier League.</p>
      <p>The match also attracted scouts from Valencia, Atalanta, Wolves, Manchester United and Milan.</p>
