        <b>Nadia Sawalha was too impatient to wait for <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/kim-kardashian/">Kim Kardashian</a>’s branded boob tape and trialled her own using Gaffer tape.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Loose Women panellist wanted to know how whether Kim’s SKIMS tape actually worked but was put on the waiting list on the popular product.</p>
      <p>Instead of waiting for the product to become available, the 55-year-old took matters into her own hands and raided her toolbox for some heavy-duty Gaffer tape.</p>
      <p>She captioned her clip:’I’ve been on the Kim Kardashian waiting list for her skims body tape for way toooooooo long but need something to help the girls out while I wait …. what do you reckon on the results ?!! Clever huh !! #kimkardashian #skims#bodys #boobs #saggyboobs#confidence #skimsbody#boobtapeforthewin #boobtape#booblifttape #booblifting’</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>That’s a lot of boob-related hashtags.</p>
      <p>In a hilarious Instagram video, Nadia shows us how it’s done, explaining: ‘I’ve been on the waiting list for ages, and I need something as a stopgap until it gets here.</p>
      <p>‘Because to be honest, love, the boobs are hanging low.’</p>

      <p>In the video, the TV presenter wasted no time in attempting to cover her nipples with layers of tape while uncontrollably giggling at the ridiculousness of the whole ordeal.</p>
      <p>She relayed the instructions to herself: ‘Under the breast, over the nipple.’</p>
      <p>Once she finished taping up, the star showed her followers the results.</p>
      <p>‘So, guys,’ she said. ‘You too can save yourself 36 quid and you don’t have to wait on the waiting list anymore.’</p>
      <p>The make-shift tape isn’t what we’re worried about, Nadia.</p>
      <p>How does it feel when you’re ripping it off after a long day?</p>

      <p>Fans really appreciated Nadia – who now runs her own YouTube channel with her family – was extremely care-free and ‘real’ about women’s bodies.</p>
      <p>One user commented: ‘Love you!! Here from the U.S. you are so real and just enjoy life. Thanks for just being you and not what the public want you to be!! Need more like you’.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘Ouch! When you took the tape off. I’d prefer to just let them hang naturally lovey!?. But love you for sharing this. You are truly fab,’ another wrote.</p>
      <p>Never change, Nadia.</p>
