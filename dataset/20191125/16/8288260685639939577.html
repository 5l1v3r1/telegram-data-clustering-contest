      <p>A man who was kidnapped at gunpoint managed to use his phone to track his location and guide police to rescue him.</p>
      <p>The victim was walking home from work when he was bundled into the back of a van in Keston Road, Thornton Heath, south London just before 2.30am on Monday.</p>
      <p>He managed to phone his wife as he was being taken away, and she alerted the police. A member of the public also saw what was happening and called 999.</p>
      <p>Officers eventually managed to speak to him in the back of the van and he tracked his location using the device.</p>

      <p>He told them that three strangers had stopped him in the street and forced him to get into the back of the van at gunpoint.</p>
      <p>A police patrol car tried to stop the van but it sped off, sparking a chase that ended when it turned into a dead end.</p>
      <p>Two of the alleged kidnappers tried to run away but were Tasered and arrested. Police are hunting the third suspect.</p>
      <p>Detective Inspector Mel Lillywhite, said: "This incident is an example of a true team effort. It is with thanks to the member of the public who heard the commotion, the swift actions of the call handler and operators and of course the officers who pursued the vehicle and detained the suspects.</p>
      <p>"The victim also used quick-thinking to track his location on his phone.</p>
      <p>"It's so important that if you see a crime in action, or something that doesn't sound or look right, call the police immediately. We would not have been able to respond so quickly if it wasn't for the member of the public doing the right thing.</p>
      <p>"We are working to trace the third suspect and I would urge anyone with information to call us as soon as possible."</p>
