        <b>President Muhammadu Buhari says the rehabilitation of internally displaced persons (IDPs) in the country is imperative and urgent to avert problems in the future.</b>
      </p>
      <p>According to Femi Adesina, presidential spokesman, said Buhari spoke when he received Tijjani Muhammad-Bande, president of the 74th United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), at the state house, Abuja, on Monday.</p>
      <p>The president was quoted as saying Nigeria is committed to the provision of education and health care to the young and the old, among other welfare policies.</p>
      <p>“Most of the displaced children do not know their parents, or where they come from,” Buhari said.</p>
      <p>“We have to look at the issue now; properly rehabilitate them, otherwise, we will have a problem on our hands in the future.’’</p>
      <p>He commended the UNGA president for his “hard work and competence” so far and urged him to make Nigeria’s challenges glaring to the world.</p>
      <p>On his part, Muhammad-Bande said he was at the state house to express appreciation to the president for his support and the continued cooperation from Nigeria.</p>
      <p>He also appreciated Nigeria for rebuilding the UN building in Abuja, which was destroyed by the Boko Haram insurgents.</p>
      <p>The UNGA president said the UN would continue to focus on how to make life better for humanity by achieving the sustainable development goals (SDGs).</p>
      <p>He expressed gratitude to Nigeria for supporting his service to the global organisation.</p>
      <p>“Everything I have requested for, in terms of personnel and funds, has been delivered. I thank President Buhari very much. I also thank other member-states for the support I am getting,” he said.</p>
      <p>“I have come here in recognition of the support the president and Nigeria have given to my office since my assumption of duty.</p>
      <p>“Everything promised me in terms of personnel and funds was given and I, therefore, have every reason to make sure that at the end of the day, we achieve what we have promised to achieve.</p>
      <p>“Of course, this will be better achieved with the cooperation we get form other member-states and the support so far has been very encouraging.”</p>
      <p>The UNGA president also used the occasion to note the importance of the  protection of the rights of citizens, especially the aged.</p>
      <p>He said: “I also have the opportunity to participate in the opening of very important regional and high-level meeting on the human rights situation of other people.</p>
      <p>“This is a very important matter, not only because it is a bit connected to the achievements of the SDG by 2030, it is also imperative that we not only affirm the dignity and wellbeing of other persons but that we act through policy interventions to guarantee that the dignity and rights of the people.</p>
      <p>“This is crucial because gradually, the population is aging. In 10 to 30 years’ time or even less, probably about 15 percent of Africans will be 60 and above.</p>
      <p>“It will be a completely different picture, and we have to plan how to guarantee the rights to all citizens, regardless of their age and gender.”</p>
