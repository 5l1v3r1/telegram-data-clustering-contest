      <p>Saints manager Jim Goodwin admits he'd love to bring Lewis Morgan back to Paisley this summer.</p>
      <p>Goodwin has spoken already about his ambition to bolster his squad in the upcoming transfer window.</p>
      <p>And now he has revealed he is looking to snare former Buddie Morgan on a loan deal from Celtic.</p>
      <p>He told STV Sport: "The January window is approaching, we've been looking at our own squad and looking at different options that are out there.</p>
      <p>"Of course Lewis would be a player we'd love to get, he's obviously been here before and been very successful. He's a quality footballer but at this minute in time he's not available.</p>
      <p>"We haven't been told by Celtic that he is and he remains part of their squad.Â </p>
      <p>"I wouldn't hide from the fact that if we could have an opportunity of making that one happen then absolutely we would.</p>
      <p>"We'll wait until the window opens and we will have those conversations then.</p>
      <p>"It's all well and good speaking to Celtic but the player needs to want to come as well and he'll have people advising him on that but Lewis is among a number of players that we're looking at.</p>
      <p>"We need to strengthen again in January, it's as simple as that."</p>
      <p>Former fan favourite Morgan signed for Celtic two years ago, before being sent back immediately on loan.</p>
      <p>After another loan spell, this time at Jack Ross' Sunderland, he returned to Celtic at the start of this season but has found game time hard to come by.</p>
