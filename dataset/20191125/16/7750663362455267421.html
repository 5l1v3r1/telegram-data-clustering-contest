      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/club-brugge/"><b>Club Brugge</b></a> make the trip to Turkey to take on <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/galatasaray/"><b>Galatasaray</b></a> knowing that they require three points to maintain their slim hopes of qualifying for the <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/champions-league/"><b>Champions League</b></a> knockout stages.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, while they cannot reach the last 16 of this competition, the home side are aware that victory on Tuesday night will put them on the brink of sealing a place in the Europa League after Christmas.</p>
      <h3>We say: Galatasaray 2-1 Club Brugge</h3>
      <p>Despite failing to score a single goal in 360 minutes of European football, we feel that Galatasaray will produce the goods in front of their own supporters on Tuesday. While Club Brugge will be more than satisfied with a share of the spoils, being prepared to settle for a point may not play into their favour.</p>

      <p>For either team to progress through to the Champions League knockout stages, they will likely be required to win their remaining two fixtures.</p>
      <h3>We say: Lokomotiv Moscow 1-2 Bayer Leverkusen</h3>
      <p>Both teams will feel that they gave good account of themselves on Matchday Four, suggesting that they are in good form ahead of this contest. While Lokomotiv have home advantage, we are backing Leverkusen to build on their success over Atletico.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/atalanta-bc/"><b>Atalanta BC</b></a> may have revenge on their mind when they welcome <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/dinamo-zagreb/"><b>Dinamo Zagreb</b></a> to the San Siro on Tuesday night, having lost the reverse fixture 4-0 in Croatia on matchday one of their Champions League campaign.</p>
      <p>The Italian outfit need a win to stand any chance of reaching the last 16 of the competition, but face a Zagreb side with very realistic ambitions of reaching the knockout stages themselves.</p>
      <h3>We say: Atalanta 2-2 Dinamo Zagreb</h3>
      <p>This is a very difficult match to call with both sides capable of scoring goals and Atalanta showing improvement last time out against Man City. Defeat could be terminal for either team, particularly Atalanta, and that need for victory could result in an open, attacking score draw.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/atletico-madrid/"><b>Atletico Madrid</b></a> will be looking to join <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/juventus/"><b>Juventus</b></a> in the last-16 stage of the Champions League when the Spanish giants travel to Turin on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>Juve have already booked their spot in the next stage having collected 10 points from their four fixtures to date, while a win for Atletico would see them advance to the round of 16 with a match to spare.</p>
      <h3>We say: Juventus 2-0 Atletico Madrid</h3>
      <p>Atletico must be respected due to their standing on the European stage, but it is difficult to predict anything other than a home win on Tuesday night when taking everything into consideration. We fully expect Juve to pick up all three points, which might well leave Atletico vulnerable in the section.</p>

      <p>A point will suffice for Pep Guardiola's men but the Citizens will be looking for a victory after they got back to <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/premier-league/man-city-vs-chelsea_game_92631.html">winning ways against Chelsea</a> on Saturday.</p>
      <h3>We say: Manchester City 4-1 Shakhtar Donetsk</h3>
      <p>Manchester City should have far too much on Tuesday for a Shakhtar Donetsk team without a number of first-team regulars.</p>

      <p>PSG have already secured their passage into the last-16 and would claim first spot in <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/champions-league/2019-20/group-a.html">Group A</a> with a point in Madrid, while a home victory guarantees Los Blancos a spot in the next round.</p>
      <h3>We say: Real Madrid 1-1 Paris Saint-Germain</h3>
      <p>Both teams will feel that they can harm the opposition in the final third of the field, and it should be a fascinating match in the Spanish capital. A point would suit both sides, though, and we are finding it difficult to separate them when taking everything into account.</p>

      <p>Based on the recent performances of each team, we cannot see anything other than a convincing win for the visitors. Red Star showed nothing against Spurs to suggest that they can get anywhere near to causing an upset on Tuesday, and success for the hosts may be avoiding a heavy defeat.</p>
