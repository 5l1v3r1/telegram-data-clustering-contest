      <h1>Huawei’s premium MatePad Pro is official, but it’s still crippled without Google Play</h1>

      <p>A newly leaked <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/329612-huaweis-mediapad-m5-tablets-are-now-available-in-the-us-shipping-from-amazon-and-newegg/">Huawei tablet</a> hinted at a high-end device from the Chinese manufacturer with a hole-punch display and a design fairly similar to the iPad Pro. The <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/345854-huawei-matepad-pro-leak/">MatePad Pro</a> is now official, and it looks like it’s ready to give <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/342934-samsung-galaxy-tab-s6-hdr-10-plus/">Samsung and Apple</a> a run for their money.</p>
      <h3>Premium hardware</h3>
      <p>On the hardware side of things, the MatePad Pro is no joke. It has a 10.8-inch AMOLED display with a 2560×1600 resolution, pretty small bezels, and a front-facing 8MP camera housed in the screen itself. We don’t usually see cutouts in tablet screens, so Huawei’s pushing things forward here.</p>

      <p>The rest of the hardware matches that top-shelf display with a Kirin 990 CPU, 6/8GB of RAM and 128/256GB of storage, and a 7250mAh battery. The tablet supports 40W fast charging and wireless charging, which is extremely rare for any tablet.</p>
      <h3>Still no Google Play</h3>
      <p>The MatePad Pro will be running <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/342922-huawei-honor-emui-10-android-q-beta-timeline/">EMUI 10 on top of Android 10</a>, and Huawei has made an M-Pen that has some extra functionality, like the S-Pen or Apple Pencil. There’s also a smart keyboard if you really want to use this thing as a productivity tool.</p>

      <p>But the biggest problem is that like other newer Huawei devices, this thing doesn’t have the Google Play Store or any <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/346082-huawei-google-hms-gms/">other Google Play services</a>. Android tablets already struggle with a big selection of apps, and losing out on one of the only major sources of tablet apps is seriously going to limit how seriously anyone outside of China takes the MatePad Pro. The slightly improved hardware wouldn’t be worth the tradeoff from a Galaxy Tab S6.</p>
      <p>Fingers crossed Huawei can get that fixed in the next few months so the MatePad Pro can have a shot at being successful around the globe.</p>
