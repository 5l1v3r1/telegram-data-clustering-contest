      <p>Interesting comments. Tacha has really come a long way.</p>
      <p>In other news, <b>Legit.ng</b> reported that another BBNaija star, <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1278829-ike-shuts-down-troll-for-telling-his-friend-to-hook-mercy.html">Ike, slammed a troll for telling his friend to hook Mercy up with another guy.</a></p>
      <p>Recall that Ike and Mercy had given viewers mixed feelings with their affair back when they were still in the competition. However, doubts of their love for each other has since been dismissed, with the way they dote over one another.</p>
