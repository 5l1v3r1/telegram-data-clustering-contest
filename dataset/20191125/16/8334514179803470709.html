      <p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States has recalled its ambassador from South Sudan after the leaders of formerly warring factions failed to agree on a unity government, the U.S. State Department said on Monday.</p>
      <p>Ambassador Thomas Hushek will return for consultations “as part of the re-evaluation of the U.S. relationship with the Government of South Sudan given the latest developments,” the department said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted that Washington would “work with the region to support efforts to achieve peace and a successful political transition in South Sudan.”</p>
      <p>South Sudan’s ministry of foreign affairs said it was still engaging with the United States.</p>
      <p>“Our position is still the same. We are still engaging with them and we have a good relationship,” spokesman Mawien Makol told Reuters.</p>
      <p>He said differences over the extension of time to form a unity government “should not break our relations. The extension is meant to fully implement the peace agreement.”</p>
      <p>After a devastating five-year civil war, South Sudanese President Salva Kiir and opposition leader Riek Machar signed a peace deal in September 2018, under pressure from the United Nations, the United States and regional governments.</p>
      <p>On Nov. 7, they agreed to give themselves 100 days more beyond a Nov. 12 deadline to form the unity government, and Washington said it was “gravely disappointed”.</p>
      <p>The conflict began after Kiir sacked Machar as vice president. It killed an estimated 400,000 people, triggered a famine and created Africa’s biggest refugee crisis since the 1994 genocide in Rwanda.</p>
