      <p>Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd. (ZEEL) chairman Subhash Chandra has stepped down from his position, days after the promoter Essel Group sold close to 16% of its stake in the open market that resulted in a reduction in the overall holdings of the group in ZEEL to 5%.</p>
      <p>“In light of the changes in shareholding, Mr. Subhash Chandra has expressed his intention to resign as chairman of the board with immediate effect,” ZEEL said in a statement to the exchanges, adding that the board accepted his resignation.</p>
      <p>Mr. Chandra founded the company in 1992 which went on to become one of India’s largest media and entertainment firms. He will remain as non executive director.</p>
      <h3>Board reconstituted</h3>
      <p>The board of ZEEL was also reconstituted with the appointment of three new independent directors in lieu of two independent directors and one nominee director of the Essel Group.</p>
      <p>Newly-appointed board member R. Gopalan, former Finance Secretary, presided over the first board meeting of the reconstituted board. Apart from Mr. Gopalan, Surendra Singh, a retired officer of the Indian Police Service and Aparajita Jain, a professional with experience in contemporary arts, also joined the board.</p>
      <p>“The reconstitution of the board was to provide a strong signal to existing and new institutional investors who have recently reposed their faith in the intrinsic value of the company, by investing ₹4,770 crore,” ZEEL added.</p>
