      <h1>Week 13 PPR Rankings: WR</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T16:01:41+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 16:01</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Lutovsky</a></address>
      <p>Byes are over and everyone's back in the Week 13 fantasy WR PPR rankings -- well, everyone who isn't injured. We still have plenty of "questionable" wide receivers who would factor in start 'em, sit 'em decisions, including Adam Thielen (hamstring), JuJu Smith-Schuster (concussion), Alshon Jeffery (ankle), and Tyreek Hill (hamstring). Fortunately, none play on Thanksgiving this year (though Amari Cooper clearly isn't 100 percent, but that's a different kind of worry), so fantasy owners will have until the weekend to search for potential waiver wire sleepers who can rack up catches and help you get into the fantasy playoffs.</p>
      <p>The Lions, Saints, and Falcons are all Thanksgiving teams that are typically generous to WRs. Guys like Russell Gage (vs. Saints) and Taylor Gabriel/Anthony Miller (@ Lions) have boom-or-bust appeal, though their floors are slightly higher in PPR leagues. Tre'Quan Smith and Ted Ginn (@ Falcons) are similar, but they tend to be much more TD-or-bust, making them better fliers in standard leagues.</p>

      <p>You don't necessarily need to take a chance on any of those players if you have one of the aforementioned injury worries. There's a good chance all will be back, but even if, say, Hill is out, you can take a chance with teammates Mecole Hardman or Demarcus Robinson, who get highly favorable matchups against Oakland. Again, neither fits the mold of a typical PPR receiver, but when these teams played back in Week 2 (also without Hill), Hardman had a 4-61-1 line and Robinson posted a 6-172-2 line. That plays in PPR almost as well as standard.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Thielen doesn't play until Monday night, which always causes drama, but considering Seattle allows the fifth-most WR receptions in the NFL, you can maybe squeeze some value out of Olabisi Johnson if you're in a pinch. Minnesota ranks third in that category, so Josh Gordon or Malik Turner have some emergency streamer upside, as well.</p>
      <p>Hunter Renfrow (@ Chiefs) is another injury worry because of a ribs issue, but if he plays, he can work as a WR3 in PPR. The same goes for Nelson Agholor (knee) if he's back against the Dolphins. New England's Mohamed Sanu (ankle) and Phillip Dorsett (concussion) both missed last week but would be decent PPR plays in favorable matchups against Houston. If they're out, fantasy owners could turn to Patriot backups Jakobi Meyers or N'Keal Harry, with Meyers having more PPR appeal.</p>
      <p>Dede Westbrook and Chris Conley both took advantage of garbage time and posted nine targets in Week 12 and have highly favorable matchups against Tampa in Week 13. Only the Panthers allow more receptions to WRs than the Bucs. Kelvin Harman and Trey Quinn are deeper sleepers this week against the Panthers.</p>
      <p>This biggest worries are Will Fuller (@ Patriots) and Hollywood Brown (vs. 49ers). Both are big-play specialists (though Fuller has had some high-catch games this year), and given the matchups, both are atmajor riskof busting. You're still sticking with DeAndre Hopkins despite arguably the toughest matchup for a WR against Stephon Gilmore, but Hopkins could disappoint, as well.</p>
      <p>With so many options this week at WR, fantasy owners shouldn't have a problem filling out their starting lineups. Let's just hope we all pick the right players.</p>
