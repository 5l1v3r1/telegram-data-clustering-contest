      <p>The search for missing 19-year-old <b>Aniah Haley Blanchard </b>appears to have reached a tragic end. Police in Auburn, Alabama <a href="https://news.auburnalabama.org/article/Public%20Safety%20-%20Police/3221">say</a> on Monday they got information leading them to human remains several feet into a woodline in Macon County. They announced that there are working to determine the victim’s identity, including whether this is the missing young woman.</p>
      <p>A local prosecutor said that human remains authorities discovered are believed to Blanchard’s.</p>
      <p>“I can confirm that human remains have been found in Macon County on County Road 2 and we have good reason to believe they are that of Aniah Blanchard,” Lee County District Attorney <b>Brandon Hughes</b> told <a href="https://www.abc4.com/news/national/remains-found-believed-to-be-ufc-fighters-stepdaughter/"><i>The Associated Press</i></a>.</p>
      <p>Blanchard was last heard from on October 23, police said. Her damaged 2017 Honda CR-V was found a few days later. Earlier this month, cops announced the arrest of Montgomery resident <b>Ibraheem Yazeed</b>, 30, for first-degree kidnapping.</p>
      <p>The defendant <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKCvOqcfROE">waived fighting extradition</a> in a hearing on November 8 in Florida. He would face the criminal case in Alabama. He was denied bond. A detective <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx1pSaEiUQE">testified</a> that according to a witness, Yazeed forced Blanchard into her vehicle. A judge ordered a DNA test for the defendant after male DNA was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygqLphknaMY">allegedly found</a> in the vehicle.</p>

      <p>A second defendant <b>Antwain “Squirmy” Fisher</b> was arrested Friday. Authorities <a href="https://www.al.com/news/birmingham/2019/11/2nd-aniah-blanchard-suspect-disposed-of-evidence-records-state.html">said</a> he helped Yazeed travel and get rid of evidence. <a href="https://www.al.com/news/2019/11/alabama-media-companies-seek-to-lift-gag-order-in-ibraheem-yazeed-trial.html">A gag order was implemented on Yazeed’s case</a>.</p>
      <p>Blanchard’s disappearance caught national attention in part because her stepfather is Ultimate Fighting Championship heavyweight <b>Walt Harris</b>. From earlier this month:</p>
