      <p>Yes, the Windows Central home page looks different than usual today. That's because it's Black Friday week!</p>
      <p>Why the makeover? Our sibling site <a href="https://www.thrifter.com/">Thrifter</a> has been planning for Black Friday and Cyber Monday for weeks, and if you're seeking the best of the best deals this year, you need to listen up. We decided to focus our site on Thrifter-curated deals, beginning today and lasting through early next week, when all the best Cyber Monday promotions finally come to a close. (Don't worry, if you don't care about deals, just scroll down the home page past the deals block. Easy.)</p>
      <p>If you're not familiar with Thrifter, it's a site with the sole mission of finding and delivering the absolute best deals on the web, faster than any other competitor. This site is 100-percent dedicated to identifying the best deals on the planet, 365 days every year, seven days each week. Thrifter staff is literally composed of <i>professional deal-spotters</i>. That is what they do. And they're damn good at it.</p>
      <p>So if Windows Central looks a bit different to you, embrace the change! We absolutely guarantee you'll find a deal that'll prove beneficial to your bank account. The best way to find those deals is by visiting our home page often. But some other ways are also listed below</p>
      <p>Thrifter's curating an <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/thrifter-black-friday-newsletter">excellent Black Friday and Cyber Monday newsletter</a> â€” some of the best deals I've seen so far this year have arrived in my inbox, courtesy of Thrifter. You can sign up for that newsletter below.</p>
      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/ThrifterDaily">Thrifter is on Twitter</a>, of course.</p>
