      <h3>I agree substantially with <a href="https://business.financialpost.com/diane-francis/diane-francis-alberta-needs-a-new-deal-fast-or-separation-is-inevitable">an article written by Diane Francis</a> which appeared in the Nov. 5 StarPhoenix.</h3>
      <p>The provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan are getting a raw deal within confederation.</p>
      <p>But Francis failed to mention an important part of the story. Alberta, Saskatchewan, and most of what is now Manitoba were part of a territory controlled from Ottawa. The governor of that territory pressed the federal government to allow the territory to enter Canada as one province.</p>
      <p>Fearing that large of a province might one day prevent Ontario and Quebec from largely controlling the entire country, the territory was instead split into three provinces. Everything on the national level since confirms that attitude.</p>
      <p>I would prefer that Saskatchewan remain in confederation as it is now, but unless Central Canada’s attitude toward the Prairie Provinces changes, the movement toward a separate nation — either within Canada or as an entirely separate country — will justifiably continue. Simply electing a new party in Canada will change nothing. It was, after all, the Conservative Party under Stephen Harper which gave us the equalization formula we have today.</p>
