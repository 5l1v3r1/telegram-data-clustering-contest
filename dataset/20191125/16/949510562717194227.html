      <p>NEW YORK (AP) — At a time when anti-Semitic incidents are on the rise, schools should take steps to teach empathy as an antidote to racism and religious hatred. That’s the word from several rabbis attending a conference in New York.</p>
      <p>The rabbis praised a pilot project in El Paso, Texas, that requires students to pause each day to consider others. Children are given a small box shaped like Noah’s Ark. They collect money in it daily and give it to charities chosen by their classes.</p>
      <p>Rabbi Levi Greenberg says daily giving connects the students to other cultures, creating compassion. So far, the boxes have gone to 1,500 students.</p>
      <p>The program took on extra poignancy in August after a gunman opened fire in a Walmart in El Paso, killing 22 people.</p>
