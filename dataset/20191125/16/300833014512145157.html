      <h1>How to fix Android Phone Or Tablet That Won’t Turn On</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T16:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 16:00</time> by <a rel="author">A. Bera</a></address>
      <p>When the Android is not turning on, we feel quite limited with the troubleshooting, but a phone that is soft-bricked doesn’t offer a lot of options when it comes to troubleshooting either. Let us find out the reasons why this can happen to your device and what to do if your <a href="https://www.technobezz.com/fix-android-phone-wont-connect-or-pair-with-bluetooth/">Android</a> won’t turn on.</p>

      <h4>Software Bugs</h4>
      <p>One of the reasons why your Android may be acting up is because of the many bugs in the software which can cause the problem. Sometimes Android devices can begin to face problems because the software has a glitch. Bugged software can be resolved by updating the software. Manufacturers regularly come up with new updates to ensure that they can resolve problems with current bugs and problems in the software.</p>

      <h4>Software Manipulation</h4>
      <p>Some of our users reported that they faced this problem when they tried to tinker with the software. Android software can be easily manipulated and customized. When we try these customizations to make our devices even better, there are times when something may go wrong and as a result the phone won’t turn on or ends up stuck in a boot loop where it goes just as far as the logo and then stubbornly sits on that screen or turns off only to start again and go as far as the logo and repeat the same thing.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h4>Stuck After An Update</h4>
      <p>When a <a href="https://www.technobezz.com/update-software-android/">software update</a> does not finish properly, you may face the problem of being stuck in the boot loop. There are quite a few reasons which may cause the software update to end up causing the phone to start just halfway through and get stuck. This is why it is important that your phone has enough battery to ensure that the update completes without the phone dying because of no battery while the phone was being updated. Sometimes your phone ends up freezing while the update is underway and it gets stuck in the boot loop.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Most of the Android devices warn the users that the phone will take time to update so they should ensure that the phone is not switched off while the phone is being updated. When this happens, there is a chance that the update does not finish properly and your phone gets stuck on the logo when you try to start it.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h4>Malfunctioning Apps</h4>
      <p>When an app ends up malfunctioning, you may find this problem occur on your device. Some of our users ended up with this issue when they downloaded an app outside the Google Store. Many apps have malicious codes and virus which can damage the software of your device and make it act abnormally. To avoid such problems, you must make sure that all apps are downloaded from the Google Store and you have a robust anti-virus software on your phone that can effectively crush virus attacks or bugged applications.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h4>Defective Memory Card</h4>
      <p>If you casually overlooked the memory card which stores numerous files and apps on it, you may be making a mistake. At times, the memory card can be a problem for the device and your <a href="https://www.technobezz.com/phone-says-no-signal-android-samsung/">Android</a> may get caught in the boot loop because of a bad memory card.</p>
      <p>Before we go into solving the issue, you must also understand that it is difficult to confirm whether you may lose the data or not when it comes to the device. Sometimes, you may end up losing the data when your phone gets stuck in the boot loop. So try to connect your device to a computer and check if the computer is able to read your device. If your device is being read then you must move all the data to the computer before you proceed with any form of troubleshooting. It will ensure that you do not lose important files when you start the troubleshooting.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h3>What to do if your Android won’t turn on?</h3>
      <h4>Solution 1: Soft Reset</h4>
      <p>The first thing to do when you face this problem is to try and do a soft reset which should help you restart the phone without getting stuck on the logo screen. A soft reset varies on different devices. While it usually involves holding down the power button for 8 to 10 seconds, there are certain phones like the HTC One, Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 and Sony Xperia Z3 which requires holding the Power and the Volume Up button together for 8 to 10 seconds. Depending on the model of your phone one of these may be successful.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h4>Solution 2: Charge Your Device</h4>
      <p>There is a possibility that your device powered off because the battery died. Sometimes, the battery indicator may show the battery has 25% for example, and it is actually almost empty. Switch off your device completely and charge it. Allow your device to charge for some time and then power it on. Check if your device is able to power on completely and if it does then your problem is solved and you can enjoy using your phone now.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <h4>Solution 3: Use a Different Charging Method</h4>
      <p>If your phone’s or tablet’s charger is not helping, then try using a USB cable and connect your device to your <a href="https://www.technobezz.com/best-computers-for-photo-editing/">computer</a>. If you were using a computer to charge the phone then switch to a wall charger to check if it works. If nothing happens, try charging another device if possible, using the same charger to check if other devices are charging. By doing this, you will figure out if the problem lies within the device or the charger.</p>
      <p>Make sure that the charger or the cable is not damaged in any way if you do not have a different device to test whether the charger is working or not. Damaged cables can be a reason why your phone is unable to charge and if your phone’s battery is dead then your phone will not switch on.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <h4>Solution 4: Reinsert the battery or switch batteries</h4>
      <p>When the phone won’t turn on, it is worth pulling out the battery of the device (if the device has a removable battery), waiting for a few seconds and then reinserting the battery.</p>
      <p>If reinserting the battery didn’t fix the problem, switch batteries if you have an extra battery with you, check if the phone powers on when you switch batteries.</p>

      </figure>
      <p> </p>
      <h4>Solution 5: Try Hitting the Power Button – Again</h4>
      <p>I know you have already tried using the <a href="https://www.technobezz.com/fix-samsung-galaxy-s7-power-and-volume-buttons-not-working/">Power button</a> but try it more than two or three times. After you charge the phone, Press the Power button a few times to ensure that there is definitely a problem in powering on the phone. If it Powers on then check if the Power button is working properly. There may be a problem in the way the Power button is wired up and maybe some loose component is causing the issue. Take the phone to a technician who can check the internal wiring of the phone if the Power button is not working properly.</p>

      </figure>
      <p> </p>
      <h4>Solution 6: Wipe Cache Partition</h4>
      <p>Wiping the cache partition of your phone allows you to remove the cache files which may have been corrupted and caused the phone to power off. There is a possibility that the corrupt cache files may not allow your phone to power On. These cache files are temporary in nature and will be created by the phone once again after you wipe out the current cache files. In order to wipe the cache partition, you need to enter the recovery mode by pressing a specific combination of keys. The combination varies from one Android device to another. Here are some examples:</p>
      <p>Samsung: Power button, Volume Down button, Home button.</p>
      <p>Nexus: Power button, Volume Down and Volume Up</p>
      <p>LG: Power button and Volume Down button</p>
      <p>HTC: Volume down and Power button.</p>
      <p>To wipe the cache partition, follow these steps:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Press and hold the Power button, the Volume Down button, and the Home button (for Samsung) all at the same time.</li>
        <li>Once you see the Android icon, release the Power button but continue to press and hold the other two buttons till you see the System Recover screen.</li>
        <li>You will see a menu with many options. Use the Volume Down key to highlight the option that says ‘Wipe Cache Partition’.</li>
        <li>Select the option by using the Power key and the process of wiping out the cache partition will initiate.</li>
      </ul>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.technobezz.com/files/uploads/2016/07/Sol-7-www.youtube.com_.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>
          <cite>www.youtube.com</cite>
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Once it completes, your phone will automatically reboot and new cache files will be built by your phone. If you are able to go through the entire process successfully and your phone switches on, then your problem is fixed, but if your Samsung Galaxy won’t turn on or charge even after wiping the cache partition then you must consider resetting the phone to factory settings.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h4>Solution No.7: Use The Manufacturer Specific PC Suite</h4>
      <p>When you encounter this problem and your phone won’t turn on, it is wise to try connecting your device to the computer and using the device’s manufacturer specific PC suite. Smartphones have their own PC suite depending on the manufacturer of the phone like Samsung smartphones use Samsung Kies and LG phones have the LG PC suite. Similarly, all of the smartphones have a PC suite.</p>
      <p>With the help of a PC suite, you can accomplish a lot of things like transferring data, syncing the device with the computer it is connected to and creating backups. When your Android is stuck on the <a href="https://www.technobezz.com/boot-samsung-galaxy-s7-edge-safe-mode/">boot</a> screen, connect it to the computer and then transfer all the data. You can update your phone with the help of the PC suite so that if your phone got stuck during the updates, it will be able to complete the update and the phone should restart.</p>
      <p>This may work if your phone turns on but turns off again after a minute or two.</p>
      <p>If nothing seems to work, perform a factory data reset. The steps for this are explained above.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h4>Solution 8: Reset the Phone to Factory Settings</h4>
      <p>When none of the above solutions can help you, then consider resetting your device to factory settings. When you reset the device to factory settings, you bring your device back to its initial state when it was taken out of the box. This helps wipe all data and it removes all third party applications from your device. If any of these were the reason why your phone won’t turn on, then a reset should be able to fix it. Since you will not be able to do the reset from within the device, make sure that you have transferred all the data to your computer if your computer is able to read your device. However, if your computer does not read the device then you lose all the data on your phone. You will have to enter the recovery mode, by pressing a specific combination of keys as we mentioned in the previous solution.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Power off your device by pressing the Power key for a long time.</li>
        <li>Now press and hold the Power, Home, and Volume Down Key (if you are using Samsung).</li>
        <li>You will notice the Android logo come up on the screen, release the Power button and continue to press and hold the other two keys till you see the Recover Menu on the screen of your device</li>
        <li>Use the Volume down key to highlight the <a href="https://www.technobezz.com/factory-reset-nexus-5/">Factory Reset</a> option in the menu</li>
        <li>Now with the help of the Power key, confirm your option</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Wait till the phone complete the process of resetting itself to factory settings. Once the phone or tablet you are using has been reset, it will automatically restart. If it restarts successfully and reaches the home screen then you should be able to use your phone now.</p>
      <p>If you have created a backup then you can restore the backup now and begin using your device.</p>
      <p>If the factory reset fails to power on your device and your phone won’t turn on even after a factory reset or if you are unable to reset your device then you must consider taking your device to a professional who can check if there is any physical damage on the device which may be causing the problem.</p>

      <h3>How to fix Android stuck on boot screen On Samsung Galaxy S, Galaxy Note, LG G, Moto X, Nexus, And Other Android Devices</h3>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Some of our readers have been asking us for solutions for boot problems on their Android. It is one of those problems where you get stuck with a smartphone on which you can do nothing because it does not even start. This problem happens to be one of the most annoying Android issues and solving it can get fairly difficult because you will be working on a phone which is not powering up. You do not have access to the System Settings of your device. Let us check the main reasons and solutions for Android boot problems.</p>
      <p>When your Android has boot problems, it can be any one of the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The device does not start at all, it does not charge when you connect the device to a charger but it is being recognized by your computer when you connect it to a computer.</li>
        <li>The device cannot start but when you connect it to the charger, you can see the device charging.</li>
        <li>It begins to power on only to get stuck on boot screen. It may get stuck on the logo screen or it may power off automatically after reaching a certain point.</li>
        <li>When you see an error message on the boot screen and the device does not start up.</li>
      </ul>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Some users enjoy increasing the abilities of their Android device by using a custom ROM or by tinkering with the system files. When your device shows boot errors, the system files are unstable because they are corrupt or they have been tinkered with. This is why custom ROMs are best avoided, especially if you are not technically inclined.</p>
      <p>This article does not include solutions for custom ROMs because there are too many things that can go wrong in custom ROMs so our article focuses on issues faced by non-rooted devices.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h4>Solution 1: Charge Your Device</h4>
      <p>It is always suggested that users should use a charger that is meant for the device, which will provide the right amperage and which is ideally bought from the same manufacturer. This will help in knowing that the charger is providing the right amount of power to the phone so that the device can work as expected. If the phone begins to charge then allow the phone to charge for at least an hour and then try to switch on your device.</p>

      </figure>
      <p> </p>
      <h4>Solution 2: Remove the battery</h4>
      <p>If you are stuck on boot loop or if your phone does not switch on at all then remove the battery of your device and wait for 30 seconds. Now start the phone and check if it switches on completely. If your phone powers on and reach the home screen, then the problem may have been minor and a battery pull was able to solve it quickly and easily.</p>
      <p>If your phone does not have a removable battery then power off your device and allow it to remain powered off completely for 5 minutes. Then restart the device.</p>

      </figure>
      <p> </p>
      <h4>Solution 3: Soft Reset</h4>
      <p>A soft reset involves pressing and holding the power key for 10 seconds. You will soon find your phone restarting and if it reaches the home screen, then the reset solved the problem. A soft reset will not delete any data and it is easy to perform.</p>

      </figure>
      <p> </p>
      <h4>Solution 4: Remove the SD card</h4>
      <p>If you are using an SD card, there is a chance that it may have the malfunction of a virus may have infected the card which is further damaging the files of the device and making it unstable when you try to power on the device. To solve this problem, you must remove the SD card of your device and power it on. Check if removing the SD card helped you solve the problem for your device.</p>

        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p> </p>
      <h4>Solution 5: Wipe cache partition</h4>
      <p>When you perform this step, you delete all the system cache files of your Android stuck on boot screen. The cache files are created on a system so that you can quickly access the software and apps of the device. You will not lose any personal data when wiping the cache partition of your device. To <a href="https://www.technobezz.com/what-is-cached-data-clear-app/">wipe the cache partition</a> you must enter the recovery mode of the device. Different devices have different button combinations which can help you access the recovery mode. It is also referred to as the bootloader. It is generally a combination of the Power and Volume Up or Volume Down key along with the Home key.</p>
      <p>If you are unaware of the combination then it is best to check the internet before trying it. For Samsung users, the key combination is pressing and holding the Volume Up, Home and Power key together.</p>
      <p>Once the logo comes up, you must leave the Power key but continue to press the other two keys till Recovery screen appears. The background is black with the recovery menu on it.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Once you are in the recovery menu, you must use the Volume down key to highlight wipe cache partition.</li>
        <li>Then use the Power key to confirm your selection.</li>
      </ul>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.technobezz.com/files/uploads/2014/06/Sol-5-www.talkandroid.com_.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>
          <cite>www.talkandroid.com</cite>
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Once the cache partition has been successfully wiped, you will be back on the same Recover menu screen. You must go down to highlight Restart and then select it using the Power key. After the device restarts, check if it reaches the home screen. If your problem is fixed then some corrupt cache files may be the culprit for the boot problems faced by your device.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h4>Solution 6: Use Safe Mode</h4>
      <p>When a device is in <a href="https://www.technobezz.com/boot-android-safe-mode/">Safe Mode</a>, it automatically disables all third party apps and works with the most basic functions. This helps you identify if any of the third party apps that you downloaded could be causing the Android stuck on startup screen problem. Since you do not have access to the Home screen of your device, you will have to rely on key combinations once again to enter Safe Mode on your device.</p>
      <p>The only thing about key combinations is that they vary from one manufacturer to another. So if you have a Motorola it may act differently to certain key combinations than a Samsung phone. Please check the internet for the right key combinations so that you get it right. Generally, you are required to hold down the volume buttons while the phone is booting up and when you reach the home screen, you will see the words Safe Mode written on it.</p>
      <p>This will confirm that the phone has successfully rebooted in Safe Mode.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.technobezz.com/files/uploads/2016/08/Screenshot_2016-08-03-15-12-13-338x600.png"/>
      </figure>
      <p>If you have been able to start your phone successfully in Safe Mode then there may be a problem in one of the third party apps that you have downloaded. It is best to start with backing up all your data and then if you are aware of the app which may be causing the problem then you can uninstall the app and restart your phone to exit Safe Mode.</p>
      <p>If your phone starts as usual after the app is uninstalled then the problem is fixed and the culprit has been recognized, however, if your device does not enter Safe Mode at all and it continues to be stuck on boot or does not boot at all, then we must consider resetting the device.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h4>Solution 7: Reset the Device to Factory Settings</h4>
      <p>You must consider resetting your device to Factory Settings in the following situations:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your device restarts in Safe Mode but you are not aware of the app that may be causing the problem so you would rather have your phone start on a clean slate.</li>
        <li>You are unable to restart your device with any of the solutions above.</li>
      </ul>
      <p> </p>
      <p>When you <a href="https://www.technobezz.com/perform-factory-reset-android-smartphone-tablet/">reset the device to factory settings</a>, you will lose all data stored on your device including the third party apps that you have downloaded. SO connect your device to a computer and if it is being recognized then move all the data to the computer so that you will have a backup created for your device.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Enter the Recovery menu of your device. (As explained before the key combinations will vary, so use the internet to check for the right combination)</li>
        <li>Now use the Volume button to highlight Factory or Factory Reset and confirm your selection with the Power button.</li>
      </ul>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Once the factory reset is complete, the device will restart automatically. If it successfully reaches the home screen then your problem has been fixed.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>On the other hand, if the problem continues you must take the phone to a professional who can check for physical damage and if your phone is under warranty you can also get a replacement for your device.</p>
      <p>The solutions we have mentioned above should work for all the Android devices. We have created the solutions keeping a variety of devices in mind and most of our readers have reported success in using these solutions to solve the boot problem on their devices.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h3>What can I do if my Samsung Galaxy won’t start after water damage?</h3>
      <p>While some of the Samsung flagships are waterproof, considerable water damage can cause this problem. If your Android device was accidentally damaged in water, do not try to turn the phone on or charge it immediately. Allow all parts of the phone to dry completely before you consider using the phone.</p>
      <p>When Samsung Galaxy S3 was introduced as a waterproof phone, some owners complained that their Samsung Galaxy won’t charge after water damage. While the phone is water resistant, there are a lot of things that can still cause the damage. Make sure you try these steps, not only for the S3 but for any Samsung Galaxy phone if it gets wet.</p>

      <h3>What to do if my Samsung Galaxy Can Be Recognized by My Computer but Does Not Power On?</h3>
      <p>When your Samsung Galaxy does not Power on but when you connect it to your computer, your system is able to recognize it, then you can try to reinstate the Android operating system. It may have gone corrupt for some reason or if it is powered off because you were trying to tweak the system software or if you tried to change something in the custom ROM. Google provides firmware images that can be easily installed if your computer can read your Samsung Galaxy phone.</p>
      <p>Do this if you understand firmware and installation of software on a phone through the computer. If any of this is too difficult for you, leave it to a professional.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h3>What should I do to turn on my tablet with a non-responding power button</h3>
      <p>There are several ways to turn off the Samsung Galaxy device but it requires the power button in order to turn it on. So, the situation is  a bit pathetic in case the power button becomes non-responding for some unknown reason. If this is the case, then the phone must be taken to a technician to repair the power button, however, there is also  a way to turn on the device without a power button. What you are required to do to turn on the device is,</p>
      <ul>
        <li>First, open the back cover of your Galaxy device and take out the battery.</li>
        <li>Wait for few seconds and then reinsert the battery.</li>
        <li>Next press and hold down the Volume down and then connect the phone to a PC through USB cable. But continue holding the Volume down button.</li>
        <li>Wait for a while and the phone will start booting in download mode. Once you are in the download mode, release the Volume down button.</li>
        <li>Now press and hold down the Volume up button which will cancel the download mode and the phone will be restarted.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>What to do if my Samsung Galaxy won’t turn on after installing a third party app?</h3>
      <p>This is a very common issue and it is pretty much understandable that the reason your device is turning on is the third party application you recently installed in your Samsung Galaxy Device.

So, in this case, you are advised to go for a factory reset as this will delete all the files, documents, apps everything from the device and leave it as the new branded one. Here is how to perform the factory reset using the hard keys.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>First, press and hold down the Power, Home, and Volume Up keys altogether.</li>
        <li>As you see the Samsung Galaxy logo on the screen or the phone vibrate once, release the power key but keep holding the other two keys. After few seconds, the Android System Recovery screen will  appear. Release the other two keys then.</li>
        <li>Now make use of Volume button to navigate to any option and select that using the Power button.</li>
        <li>Here you need to select factory reset or wipe data option and then go for reboot system now.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>What should I do if my Android smartphone won’t turn on after a drop from hand?</h3>
      <p>If you have accidentally dropped your Samsung device and it gets off after the drop, then the first step you should try is to turn on the device is by long pressing  the power button. If the device remains unresponsive, then perform a soft reset by removing the back cover and then pulling out the battery. Wait for few seconds and replace the battery. Now see if it brings any changes. If not then, connect the phone to your PC and see if it can recognize the device.
