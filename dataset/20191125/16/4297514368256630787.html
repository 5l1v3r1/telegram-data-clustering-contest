      <p>While police will not confirm the names of either of the deceased, they have confirmed that a 21-year-old woman from India and an 18-year-old man from the Lower Mainland were found dead on Friday (Nov. 22) inside a Whalley home.</p>
      <p>Only one of them is believed to have been murdered, and police are not looking for suspects.</p>
      <p>“Due to privacy laws, we are not commenting on the names of the deceased as there is no investigative need to do so,” the Integrated Homicide Investigation Team stated in a tweet Monday morning. “No further information will be released at this time. We acknowledge the tragic nature of this case and our condolences go out to the affected families.”</p>
