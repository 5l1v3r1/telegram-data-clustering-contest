      <p>Jenna Dewan shut down speculation that she shaded Camila Cabello during the 2019 American Music Awards on Sunday.</p>
      <p>In a video posted to her <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jennadewan/?hl=en">Instagram</a> story, Dewan said she had nothing but love for the “Señorita” singer, who performed her hit song with Shawn Mendes at the ceremony Sunday night.</p>
      <p>“I’m getting a lot of text messages from people wondering if I was shading Camila,” Dewan said in the video, which appeared to be filmed as she was leaving the ceremony.</p>

      <p>“No. I love her. I love her so much. I’m such a big fan of hers,” Dewan clarified, adding, “I don’t understand what that’s about.”</p>
      <p>“Guys, we were bumping and grinding so hard to ‘Señorita,'” Dewan’s date for the event, celebrity stylist Brad Goreski, chimed in.</p>
      <p>The controversy began after a since-deleted video, showing Dewan whispering something to Goreski during Cabello and Mendes’ performance of “Señorita,” began circulating on Twitter during the awards show.</p>
      <p>Some fans thought that Dewan was whispering “She’s so extra” to Goreski, and even claimed that the dancer was rolling her eyes.</p>

      <p>But once Dewan posted the video clearing things up, others were quick to condemn the users who started the drama between Cabello and Dewan.</p>
