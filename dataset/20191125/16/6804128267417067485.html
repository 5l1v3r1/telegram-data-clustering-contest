      <h2>Dermot Gallagher has been speaking about a key decision in Tottenham's win at West Ham</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T16:07:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 16:07</time> by <a rel="author">Paul Clarke</a></address>
      <p>Former Premier League referee Dermot Gallagher has pinpointed the wrong decision which could have cost Tottenham at West Ham United.</p>
      <p>Spurs came into their first match under Jose Mourinho desperately needing a win to help them march up the Premier League table.</p>
      <p>Tottenham were 14th ahead of the clash at the London Stadium but have shot up to tenth on the back of the 3-2 win.</p>
      <p>Son Heung-Min, Lucas Moura and Harry Kane gave Spurs a 3-0 lead inside the first 49 minutes only for Michail Antonio and Angelo Ogbonna to pull goals back for the hosts.</p>
      <p>But it all could have been so different had Ryan Fredericks been red carded for a challenge on Son.</p>
      <p>Fredericks received a yellow card for the lunge but now Gallagher has identified this incident as a big mistake which could have cost Spurs on the day.</p>
      <p>"I think he is very lucky because on another day, with another ref, he could easily have got a red card," Gallagher explained on Sky Sports' Ref Watch.</p>
      <p>"If you make a tackle like this, you really run the risk of a red card. As it is, Michael (Oliver) saw it as a strong or high-tariff yellow and if he had been sent off for that, he could not have complained.</p>
