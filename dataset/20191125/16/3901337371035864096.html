      <p>The Reds' manager has backed star player Virgil van Dijk to pip Messi to this year's Ballon d'Or after his performances for the club over the past 12 months.</p>
      <p>"If you give the Ballon d'Or to the best player of this generation, then you should give it always to Lionel Messi. That's how it is," Klopp told Liverpool's official website.</p>

      <p>"But if you give it to the best player of last season, then it was Virgil van Dijk. I don't know exactly how it will work but that is how I see it.</p>
      <p>"The best player of all? That's Lionel. Best player of last season? That's Virgil. We will see."</p>
      <p>Van Dijk played an instrumental role in Liverpool's 2018/19 UEFA Champions League triumph and Premier League challenge, and was crowned the UEFA Men's Player of the Year, the PFA Players' Player of the Year and the Premier League Player of the Season earlier this year.</p>
