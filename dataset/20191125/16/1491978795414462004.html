      <h3>IN THE DO ONE DEPARTURE LOUNGE …</h3>
      <p>With its finger firmly placed on the beating pulse of piping hot football news, The Fiver has never been a daily football email that’s been easily overtaken by events, but staying ahead of the chasing posse of imminent managerial sackings in the Premier League that are currently snapping hungrily at our heels could prove trickier than usual today.</p>
      <p>With his job at Everton currently hanging by a thread [<i>subs please check thread hasn’t snapped</i>], Marco Silva is one of several top flight gaffers expected to be handed his P45 in the coming minutes, hours or days <i>[subs please check current whereabouts of Silva’s P45]</i>, following his side’s latest risible capitulation, this time at home to a team wearing red shirts, shorts and socks but purporting to be league strugglers Norwich City. In a state of affairs that suggests Silva isn’t only one who appears clueless about what’s going on at the club he manages <i>[subs please check he still manages the club]</i>, there seems widespread confusion regarding the identity of his successor.</p>
      <p>Some say the club are inclined to go homegrown and “give it back to Moyesey til the end of the season”, while the scourge of referees that is Ailsa from Home and Away has also been linked with a job that has sadly proved too difficult for one fancy dan continental manager – Bobby M, Ronald Koeman, Sam Allardici and now Silva – after another, despite the enormous amounts of transfer funds most have been given to waste.</p>
      <p>Whoever replaces Silva, his dismissal is likely to be greeted by high-fives, honks and hoots from Sky Sports pundits Paul Merson and Phil Thompson, who were widely derided as dinosaurs by The Fiver and other younger football media hepcats when they had the temerity to publicly question the Portuguese manager’s Premier League credentials upon his arrival in Hull two years and three high profile failures ago.</p>
      <p>While he may be closest to the sack <i>[subs please check he hasn’t been sacked]</i>, Silva is just one of no less than five Premier League managers currently sizing up boxes for their workplace possessions as none of Arsenal’s Unai Emery, West Ham’s Manuel Pellegrini, Watford’s Quique Sánchez Flores or Southampton’s Ralph Hasenhüttl are expected to last too long in their current roles [<i>subs please check etc, and so on and on and on and on and on</i>]. With so many managerial opportunities arising even Harry Bassett is rumoured to be updating his CV. After all, his old club Sheffield United won’t manage themselves if Chris Wilder ups and leaves <i>[subs please check Chris Wilder hasn’t upped and left]</i>.</p>

      <h3>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h3>
      <p>“It was one of the most unsavoury times of my career. I thought it was a ball to begin with, it was a big old thing … it didn’t miss be my much. The fans can throw some things but a cabbage?” – Newcastle boss Bernard Cribbins recalls his close encounter with a flying brassica before he was bundled aboard the good ship Do One by Aston Villa, where he returns this evening.</p>
