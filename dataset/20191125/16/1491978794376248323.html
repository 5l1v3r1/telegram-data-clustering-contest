        <i>Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Dele Alli has heaped praise on Mauricio Pochettino after he was sacked by Spurs. ‘I’ve been through a lot of ups and downs and he’s helped me through all of them. I can’t thank him for enough. I’ve seen him more than I’ve seen my own family in the last five years,’ said Alli. The 23-year-old admitted that he couldn’t help but feel to blame for Pochettino’s demise, but said that him and his teammates gave ‘110%’ while playing under him</i>
