      <h1>Fat Cops In Turkmenistan Told 'Lose Weight Or Lose Job'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T16:35:06+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 16:35</time> by <a rel="author">Farangis Najibullah, RFE/RL's Turkmen Service</a></address>
      <p>“Lose weight or lose your job,” police across Turkmenistan have been told as law-enforcement employees in the tightly controlled Central Asian nation undergo mandatory requalification tests.<br/><br/>The Interior Ministry has ordered officers to get in shape by December 25 if they want to keep their jobs, several police officers have told RFE/RL correspondents in Turkmenistan.<br/><br/>Some police say they’ve also been told to encourage relatives who live abroad to return to Turkmenistan by the end of 2019.<br/><br/>The officers spoke on condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisals from a government that doesn’t tolerate criticism or allow free speech.<br/><br/>They said the Interior Ministry has told them police must not weigh more than 100 kilograms because the country’s newly appointed Interior Minister Mammedkhan Chakyev “doesn’t like fat cops.”<br/><br/>Those who fail to meet the weight-loss requirement must resign -- regardless of their rank, years of service, or other qualifications.<br/><br/>Similar measures have previously been taken in neighboring Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, where authorities often criticize police about their fitness but rarely address allegations of widespread police corruption.<br/><br/>Turkmenistan's tight deadline for weight loss has led many officers to take up jogging or to start working out in stadiums, gyms, and public parks.<br/><br/>Police officers running and playing sports have suddenly become a common sight in the southeastern city of Mary, local RFE/RL correspondents report.<br/><br/>“In the stadium on Mary’s Ashgabat Street, police officers can be seen running nowadays,” our correspondents reported.</p>
      <p>“They also play soccer and volleyball in a sports center located behind the prosecutors’ office and work out in a gym at the Ylham Palace.”<br/><br/>The requalification tests for Turkmen police also include background checks to determine if any of their close relatives have criminal records or live abroad.<br/><br/>Police in Lebap Province say they were told to convince relatives who live in other countries to return home by the end of the year, a local RFE/RL correspondent reported.<br/><br/>That's because Turkmen authorities are said to be concerned that many <b><a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/escape-from-turkmenistan-almost-2-million-have-fled-but-the-president-won-t-hear-of-it/29987972.html">citizens are trying to flee the country</a></b> to escape financial hardships and the lack of basic freedoms.</p>
      <p><b>Superficial Changes</b><br/><br/>Turkmenistan is not the first country in Central Asia to order cops to shape up or ship out.<br/><br/>In 2017, Tajikistan’s Interior Ministry announced that 10 officers were dismissed for failing to lose excess weight within a six-month deadline.<br/><br/>About 100 hefty Tajik police officers were given official warnings.<br/><br/>Tajikistan also has instructed police to attend theater performances at least once a month to "help boost their spiritual and moral awareness and to unwind after a difficult working day.”<br/><br/>In Uzbekistan, President Shavkat Mirziyoev has said the country has <b><a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/uzbek-cops-given-six-months-to-get-fit-for-duty/29802662.html">“no need for an overweight police officer.”</a></b><br/><br/>“We are giving them a deadline: three to six months,” Mirziyoev said in March. “During this time, they should get in shape and shed that extra weight."<br/><br/>But chubby officers are the least concern for most ordinary citizens when it comes to fighting crime in Central Asia.<br/><br/>Police are notoriously corrupt in the region, with widespread allegations of police taking bribes and engaging in extortion, as well as being incompetent and mistreating detainees.</p>

      <p>Turkmenistan’s new interior minister reportedly has been taking measures to tackle corruption since he was appointed on October 1.<br/><br/>Our correspondents in Mary report that <b><a href="https://rus.azathabar.com/a/30211272.html">cameras have been installed to control traffic police officers,</a></b> a move some residents have welcomed as bringing change.<br/><br/>“Instead of getting bribes as they usually did before, police are now writing penalty tickets to traffic offenders,” RFE/RL’s correspondent quoted local residents as saying.<br/><br/>Several officers were reportedly arrested in Mary after being caught in October trying to extort bribes.<br/><br/>Low police wages are often cited as an explanation for bribe-taking cops.<br/><br/>According to several law-enforcement agency employees who spoke to RFE/RL in Lebap Province, police salaries in the area range from $80 to $140 a month.<br/><br/>In the capital, Ashgabat, residents say the number of police on duty has increased significantly since Chakyev became interior minister.<br/><br/>"In my neighborhood, they mostly catch people who cross the highway instead of using the underpass,” one Ashgabat resident told RFE/RL, adding that people want real reforms not “superficial” changes.</p>
