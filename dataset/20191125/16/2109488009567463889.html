      <p>Orange pressed on with its vaunted mobile banking play, launching the service in Spain more than <a href="https://www.mobileworldlive.com/featured-content/home-banner/orange-bank-launches-across-france/">two years after</a> the product made its debut in France.</p>
      <p>In a statement, Orange Bank CEO Paul de Leusse (<i>pictured</i>) held up the division as a “key strand of the group’s multi-service strategy” adding the service would deliver a unique offer to one of the operator’s largest markets.</p>
      <p>Orange Bank Spain general director Narciso Perales noted Orange’s longstanding experience in the mobile industry meant it was “most suited to design a mobile banking service for today’s highly mobile population.”</p>
      <p>Initially Orange Bank Spain will offer current accounts, savings products, physical debit cards and app-based group payment functionalities which enable the cost of items to be split among account holders.</p>
      <p>Customers also taking Orange’s core services will receive a discount on mobile bills.</p>
      <p>The launch comes two weeks after <a href="https://www.mobileworldlive.com/money/news-money/orange-bank-hails-progress-2-years-in/">Orange hailed the progress</a> of its French banking service, which signed-up half a million customers in the first two years.</p>
      <p>As well as its full banking service, which is eventually expected to expand across its European footprint, Orange offers mobile money in its Africa markets under the Orange Money brand.</p>
