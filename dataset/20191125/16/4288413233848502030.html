      <h1>Lemur Caught Trying to Steal Camera from Photographer’s Hands</h1>

      <p>Wildlife photographer Luca Bracali was shooting in Madagascar recently when a lemur dropped down from a tree and tried to yank the camera from Bracali’s hands. The photographer kept his grip on the camera and managed to capture unusual photos of the lemur reaching toward him.<br/><br/>Bracali was in Andasibe National Park and photographing the black-and-white ruffed lemur when the animal decided it wanted to be the photographer instead.</p>
      <p>“I was taking a photo of the lemur when all of a sudden he climbed down and tried to grab my camera,” the 54-year-old photographer tells SWNS. “He hung upside down and reached out towards my camera. I couldn’t believe it, I was really surprised!</p>
      <p>“I used a super wide-angle and I remained pretty close to the ground with the lens all the way up waiting for the lemur to come down.”</p>

      <p>Bracali began his career as a photojournalist and sports photographer before switching to wildlife photography. He says he enjoys the genre because of the challenge of photographing unpredictable wild animals — it’s an exercise in patience, and you never know what you’re going to walk away with.</p>
