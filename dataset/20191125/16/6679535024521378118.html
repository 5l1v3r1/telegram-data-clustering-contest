      <h2>Supreme Court reserved its order on the Maharashtra floor test issue for November 26.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T16:59:18+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 16:59</time> by <a rel="author">PTI</a></address>
      <p>Locked in a protracted power tussle with the BJP in Maharashtra, the Shiv Sena, the NCP and the Congress “paraded” 162 MLAs in a Mumbai five-star hotel on November 25 evening in a show of united strength.</p>
      <p>The move came hours after the leaders of the three parties submitted a letter to Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari claiming that they have the requisite numbers to form government.</p>
      <p>Which combine will win the floor test in Maharashtra Assembly? Who is legally the leader of NCP Legislature Party? Is the early morning swearing-in valid? The answers to some of these questions are still unknown as the Supreme Court reserved its order on the Maharashtra floor test issue for November 26.</p>
