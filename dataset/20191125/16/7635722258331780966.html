      <h1>Positive Fergus McFadden news in Leinster injury update before Glasgow test</h1>

        <b>Fergus McFadden is back in training with Leinster ahead of this Saturday's Guinness Pro14 match away to Glasgow Warriors.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The province have announced <a href="https://www.leinsterrugby.ie/injury-update-squad-boosted-clash-with-glasgow-warriors/?FixGuid=19GL4600">in an injury update</a> today that 33-year-old international returned to training last week and will look to increase his workload throughout this week.</p>
      <p>Centres Joe Tomane and Rory O'Loughlin are also set to train more this week as they recover from hamstring and shoulder complaints respectively.</p>
      <p>Tomane will increase his workload this week after sustaining his minor hamstring complaint ahead of the European Champions Cup opener against Benetton, while O’Loughlin returns to on-field training this week after picking up a shoulder injury in that same match.</p>
      <p>Tadhg Furlong came through Saturday’s 13-6 Heineken Champions Cup win over Lyon on his return from a back complaint with no issues and is also expected to train as normal over the coming days.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, hooker Seán Cronin remains unavailable for selection as he recovers from a neck injury picked up on international duty with Ireland. He too is expected to do more in training as the week progresses.</p>

      <p>Leo Cullen's side sit top of their Champions Cup Pool 1 on nine points alongside Northampton Saints after their opening wins in the tournament.</p>
      <p>The eastern province continue their Pro14  campaign this weekend, having kicked it off last month with an impressive 53-5 win over Ospreys in Conference A.</p>
      <p>They followed that up with a 3-0 win in Italy against Zebre in a dour affair, before a 50-15 win over Dragons on November 1st.</p>
      <p>Flanker Josh Van Der Flier was <a href="https://www.offtheball.com/rugby/van-der-flier-leinster-928884">one of those that impressed</a> in Saturday's win over Lyon, with Ronan Kelleher another that has people talking - with an international call-up potentially on the horizon.</p>
      <p>This weekend's Pro14 tie at Scotstoun is a repeat of the final of that competition in May. The 18-15 win at Celtic Park secured Leinster back-to-back wins in the tournament.</p>
