      <h1>Gengar’s mouth is a literal portal to hell in Pokémon Sword and Shield</h1>

      <p>I am always conflicted by Gengar. He is cute and round with short legs — sort of like my dog. I want to squeeze him and hug him but I’m also terrified by him. There is something sinister hiding behind his smile. As it turns out, it’s literally a portal to the afterlife.</p>
      <p>In <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2019/11/13/20961309/pokemon-sword-and-pokemon-shield-review-nintendo-switch-nov-15-release-date"><i>Pokémon Sword</i> and <i>Shield</i></a>, Gengar can enter <a href="https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-sword-shield-guide/2019/11/19/20971318/pokemon-sword-shield-guide-how-to-get-gigantamax-pokemon-vs-dynamax-pokemon">Gigantamax</a> mode where he becomes not only large, but his form changes, too. Essentially he goes from deadly baby to all mouth — a mouth that’s filled with “cursed energy” and leads not into his body but “directly to the afterlife,” according to Gengar’s <i>Sword</i> Pokédex entry. It gets worse in Gengar’s <i>Shield</i> Pokédex entry: “It lays traps, hoping to steal the lives of those it catches. If you stand in front of its mouth, you’ll hear your loved ones’ voices calling out to you.”</p>
      <p>Great!</p>

      <p>Of course, Gengar has always been a creepy cutie. In <i>Pokémon Sun</i> and <i>Moon</i>’s Pokédex, the Gengar entry got real — Game Freak had apparently been leaving out one <i>crucial</i> detail on Gengar’s backstory: It was once a human.</p>
      <p>“[Gengar] apparently wishes for a traveling companion,” according to <i>Moon</i>’s Gengar Pokédex entry. “Since it was once human itself, it tries to create one by taking the lives of other humans.”</p>
      <p>At this point, it shouldn’t really be surprising that the world of Pokémon is deep, dark, and devastating. Humans can become Pokémon — <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Kadabra_(Pok%C3%A9mon)">Kadabra</a> was once a child and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-sword-shield-guide/2019/11/19/20973054/how-to-evolve-galarian-yamask-runerigus">Yamask</a> carries a mask of its former human face — and <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Drowzee_(Pok%C3%A9mon)">Drowzee</a> eats children’s dreams. <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Dusclops_(Pok%C3%A9mon)">Dusclops</a> is a black hole that absorbs anything. <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Phantump_(Pok%C3%A9mon)">Phantump</a> is possessed by the spirit of dead children. <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Mimikyu_(Pok%C3%A9mon)">Mimikyu</a> is apparently so horrifying under its disguise that a scientist who peeked under its “mysteriously” died. And who can forget <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Cubone_(Pok%C3%A9mon)">Cubone</a>, the Pokémon who wears the skull of its dead mother?</p>
      <p>And this is not to mention the normal, everyday things that happen in the Pokémon universe: capturing wild creatures and forcing them to fight each other under the guise that they’re your best friends and companions. Scientists have <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/11/22/20977707/pokemon-sword-shield-fossil-dracozolt-arctozolt-dracovish-arctovish-pokedex-england-fake">created actual monsters</a> out of dead Pokémon. In <i>Sword </i>and <i>Shield</i>, this all goes down in a region essentially owned by capitalist Chairman Rose, who nearly destroys Galar.</p>
      <p><a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Xatu_(Pok%C3%A9mon)">Xatu</a>, a Mysteric bird-like monster, is said to stand in place all day long. Its <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokedex/xatu">Pokédex entry</a> said people believe it’s “out of fear of the terrible things it has foreseen in the future” — probably the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/11/19/20972466/pokemon-sword-shield-climate-change-galarian-corsola-cursola">climate crisis warned of by Galarian Corsola</a>, a bleached, cursed Pokémon that’s not unlike <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/3/30/11332636/great-barrier-reef-coral-bleaching">our real-world bleached coral</a>.</p>
      <p>Depending on what Xatu’s seen, maybe Gengar’s deep belly abyss isn’t so bad, after all.</p>
