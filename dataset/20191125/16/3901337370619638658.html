      <p>As one of the greatest footballers South Africa has ever produced, Teko Modise recently heaped praise on a former Kaizer Chiefs player. Did you see who?</p>
      <p>Amakhosi took on Maritzburg United in a Telkom Knockout semi-final clash this past weekend, with the Glamour Boys succumbing to a 2-1 loss on the day.</p>
      <p>The fixture also saw one of Chiefs' former players take to the field and inspire the Team of Choice to victory, much to Modise's delight.</p>

      <p>The player in question is Keagan Buchanan, and the former Bloemfontein Celtic star pulled the strings in the middle of the park for the Pietermaritzburg outfit.</p>
      <p>After the match, Modise took to Instagram Stories to post an image of the player known as "The Fixer" along with a caption that read: "As they say, form temporary, class is permanent. Great to see him do what he loves. The comeback from setback is well-documented."</p>
