      <h1>French couple shot dead in Haiti while seeking adoption, officials say</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T16:50:11+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 16:50</time> by <a rel="author">AFP</a></address>
      <p>Two French citizens were shot dead in Port-au-Prince at the weekend shortly after flying into the Haitian capital to adopt a child, diplomatic and other sources told AFP Monday.</p>
      <p>An official at the French embassy confirmed that a French couple had been killed, without giving further details of the exact circumstances of their deaths.</p>
      <p>According to two other sources, however, the couple were from the Ardeche region of southeastern France and had arrived in the Caribbean country to adopt a child.</p>
      <p>One of the sources said they were killed in an armed robbery that turned deadly.</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman for the Ardeche department confirmed to AFP that the couple, from the town of Saint-Martin-d'Ardeche, had been given a green light last year to adopt their first child.</p>
      <p>Haiti, the poorest country in the Americas, has been roiled for two months by protests, which were triggered by fuel shortages but have turned violent and morphed into a broader campaign against President Jovenel Moise.</p>
      <p>According to UN figures, at least 42 people have been killed and dozens injured during anti-government protests since mid-September.</p>
      <p>The French foreign ministry recommends visitors "postpone their trip to Haiti until further notice."</p>
      <p>"Demonstrations, accompanied by blockades on the main roads and violent acts (rock throwing, shots...) are very frequent. Violent groups are active and fueling a climate of insecurity," the foreign ministry warned last month.</p>
