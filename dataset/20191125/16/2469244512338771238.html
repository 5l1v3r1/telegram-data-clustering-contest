      <h1>TSB to shut 82 branches - and those in the South West could be affected</h1>
      <h2>It is thought up to 400 jobs could be lost as the bank announces it will close 15 per cent of its branches</h2>

      <p>TSB has announced that it will shut 82 branches as part of cost-cutting measures.</p>
      <p>The Spanish-owned bank, which has 540 outlets, is trying to make £100m of savings by 2022.</p>
      <p>The closures will hit around 15 per cent of their branches.</p>
      <p>Those in question will be made public on Thursday once staff have been informed. TSB has not disclosed exactly how many job will be lost, but it is believed 300-400 positions will be affected.</p>
      <p>The bank has said it will try to find new roles for those staff affected elsewhere in the group, and believes it will cost around £180m to close the branches down.</p>
      <p>TSB has 10 branches across Devon and Cornwall, with Devon outlets in Exeter, Exmouth, Torquay, Tavistock, Barnstaple, Okehampton and two in Plymouth.</p>
      <p>Cornwall has branches in St Austell and Bude.</p>
      <p>The bank's reputation has taken a battering in the last 18 months. Last year saw a massive IT failure which affected 1.9m customers when the bank tried to move date from one IT system to another.</p>

      <p>It led to their chief executive, Paul Pester, standing down.</p>
      <p>A damning independent report released last week said the bank's board lacked 'common sense' as it prepared to make the switch to the new system, which had not been fully tested.</p>
      <p>And the, just days later, an IT failure meant wages and other payments were not paid into some of its customers' accounts due to a 'processing error'.</p>
      <p>Despite vowing to leave no customer out of pocket, some complained about being unable to pay their rent and long call wait times when trying to seek help.</p>
      <p>TSB boss Debbie Crosbie said: "The plan we're sharing today involves some difficult decisions, but it sets TSB up to succeed in the future.</p>
      <p>"Taken together, these changes will help us to serve more customers, better, for the long-term."</p>
      <p>She added: "Many of these locations that we are closing are just not fit for purpose for a modern bank and they don't give us the flexibility to adapt to the changing needs of our customers."</p>
      <p>Ms Crosbie also did not rule out more branches being shut in the future as it follows in the footsteps of rivals like Lloyds and RBS.</p>
      <p>The bank said it expects up to 80 per cent of its sales to be digital by 2022, compared to 46 per cent in September this year.</p>
