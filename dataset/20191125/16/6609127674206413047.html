      <p>It ended with a pitch invasion and chaotic scenes at the Ayrshire side's Rugby Park stadium.</p>
      <p>Richard Bambridge, 29, Daniel McHugh, 25, Mattthew Brannigan, 27, and Jamie McEwan, 21, are accused of entering the field, embracing players, struggling with stewards, trying to take a photo with a player and gesticulating at rival fans.</p>
      <p>Bambridge, of Baillieston and McHugh, of Blackhill, both Glasgow, Brannigan, of Bishopton, Renfrewshire and McEwan, of Bishopbriggs, Dunbartonshire, all deny breach of the peace.</p>
      <p>They were freed on bail at Kilmarnock Sheriff Court for trial in April.</p>
      <p>At a separate hearing in the same court, Rangers fan Dean Jackson, 18, was accused of singing a song with sectarian lyrics at the game.</p>
      <p>Jackson, of Larbert, Stirlingshire, denies threatening or abusive behaviour aggravated by religious prejudice.</p>
      <p>He was bailed for trial in April and banned from attending any regulated football match in Scotland meantime.</p>
      <p>Police Scotland put out a public appeal for information after the match disruption, which caused the roof of a sheltered disabled section to cave in.</p>
      <p>Officers later said 13 men and boys had been charged with offences connected to the disorder.</p>
