        <b>An Iraqi minister who has been reported for alleged benefits fraud in Sweden is being investigated for suspected crimes against humanity, Swedish media report.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Swedish media identified the subject of their inquiry as Defence Minister Najah al-Shammari, but the statement from the Swedish Prosecution Authority did not name anyone.</p>
      <p>The prosecutors' body said in a statement that it had received complaints about "an Iraqi minister suspected of crimes against humanity". The investigation was "in a very early stage", it added.</p>
      <p>Several Swedish media outlets, including the country's main dailies, identified him as al-Shammari, reporting that he was also a Swedish citizen, though he goes by a different name in Sweden.</p>
      <p>An unnamed Swedish-Iraqi lawyer told Svenska Dagbladet that he had reported al-Shammari to police in October for his role in the shooting of hundreds of protesters during weeks of unrest.</p>
      <p>Since October 1st, Iraq's capital and majority-Shiite south have been swept by mass rallied protesting corruption, a lack of jobs and poor services. Those demonstrations have escalated into calls for a complete overhaul of the ruling elite.</p>
      <p>An estimated 350 protesters have been killed and thousands wounded in clashes with the security forces, according to a tally compiled by AFP. The authorities in Iraq no longer update their figures.</p>
      <p>The defence minister is <a href="https://www.thelocal.se/20191123/iraqs-defence-minister-charged-with-benefits-fraud-in-sweden">also under investigation for benefits fraud</a> for claiming housing and child benefits from Sweden despite living in Iraq, according to online news site Nyheter Idag and Swedish newspaper Expressen.</p>
      <p>Swedish social insurance agency Försäkringskassan told AFP that they were unable to confirm whether they were investigating al-Shammari as all their cases are classified.</p>
      <p>Al-Shammari arrived in Sweden in 2009 and was granted a permanent residency in 2011 before getting his citizenship in 2015, according to Expressen.</p>
