      <p>Cristiano Ronaldo remains in doubt for Tuesday’s Champions League clash against Atletico Madrid in Turin, Juventus coach Maurizio Sarri said on Monday.</p>
      <p>The 34-year-old Portuguese international was rested for Saturday’s Serie A game against Atalanta which Juventus won 2-1 thanks to a Gonzalo Higuain double to stay top of the Italian league.</p>
      <p>“Cristiano trained with his teammates yesterday (Sunday),” said Sarri.</p>
      <p>“It seems that his condition is improving but we still have to evaluate between today and tomorrow.</p>
      <p>“The positive thing he was able to play throughout the training session with his teammates.”</p>
      <p>Defender Matthijs de Ligt, who suffered a dislocated shoulder, and forward Federico Bernardeschi, who bruised his chest, also need to be evaluated, Sarri said.</p>
      <p>Ronaldo was substituted in Juventus’s previous two games including their Champions League game at Lokomotiv Moscow with a slight knee problem.</p>
      <p>The five-time Ballon d’Or winner and hit back with four goals to help Portugal qualify for Euro 2020.</p>
      <p>“My relationship with Cristiano is good,” said Sarri, “if a player who has won so much is angry about being substituted, it means he still has a lot of motivation, and this is something positive.”</p>
      <p>Juventus are already through to the last 16 and want to finish top of Group D with second-placed Atletico needing a win to guarantee their place.</p>
      <p>“Atletico are a difficult side to play against, we have to think we want to qualify to be the leader of the group that is our target for tomorrow,” said Sarri.</p>
      <p>Sarri conceded he was spoilt for choice upfront between Ronaldo, Paulo Dybala and Higuain.</p>
      <p>“We have three very strong strikers for just two roles, I think it is an ideal situation, nobody will be able to play 65 matches, including with the national team,” continued the Juventus coach.</p>
      <p>“Playing Dybala, Higuain and Cristiano all together is difficult because of their characteristics, but all three know how to play really well and are comfortable with each other.”</p>
      <p>Higuain, who has scored five goals this season, sat alongside Sarri in the press conference, and praise his coach, who he also played under at Napoli and Chelsea.</p>
      <p>“Obviously I spent some of the best season’s of my career with Mr Sarri, I know exactly what he wants,” said the 31-year-old Argentine who joined the veteran coach at Chelsea last season after an unhappy five-month loan spell at AC Milan.</p>
      <p>“Compared to last year I had to change something in my head and he (Sarri) helped me a lot.</p>
      <p>“Mentally and physically I’m in great shape and the manager has been helping me a lot.”</p>
