      <h1>Week 13 Fantasy QB Rankings: Larmar Jackson, Deshuan Watson falling because of tough matchups</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T16:37:46+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 16:37</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Lutovsky</a></address>
      <p>Some reliable quarterbacks disappointed for fantasy football owners last week, with Russell Wilson and Matt Ryan doing little despite favorable matchups. Both are back with favorable matchups this week, and both are once again high in our Week 13 fantasy QB rankings. In fact, both are higher than position stalwarts Lamar Jackson and Deshaun Watson, who both face brutal matchups against the 49ers and Patriots, respectively. Fortunately, there are plenty of potential sleepers, a few of which who can be found on the waiver wire, if you don't trust Jackson or Watson when making your start 'em, sit 'em decisions.</p>
      <p>We still trust Jackson and Watson, at least enough to rank them in our top 10, as both have shown the ability to produce regardless of opponent. Watson is a little more worrisome than Jackson, as he was shut down two weeks ago by Baltimore and will face a stiffer test on Sunday night against the Patriots. Like Jackson, he might have to utilize his legs more to find value, but we know he can do that, so it's tough to bench him in what could be a make-or-break week for many.</p>

      <p>This week's top sleepers include Sam Darnold (@ Bengals), Nick Foles (vs. Buccaneers) and Mitchell Trubisky (@ Lions). We don't blame you if you don't trust the latter two. You might not even trust a few of the guys in our top 12 despite their favorable matchups. Carson Wentz (@ Dolphins) and Jared Goff (@ Cardinals) have been inconsistent, to say the least, and obviously present risk. Still, with their matchups, it's tough to imagine them being held down again, even on the road.</p>

        <b>WEEK 13 PPR RANKINGS: <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/fantasy/news/week-13-fantasy-ppr-rb-rankings-running-back-sleepers/17al9q8kz6v1k19wh8otlz2we2">Running back</a> | <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/fantasy/news/week-13-ppr-rankings-wr-fantasy-football-wide-receiver-sleepers/wgsxmq892kf91l9h2x825a4bq">Wide receiver</a> | <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/fantasy/news/week-13-fantasy-ppr-rankings-tight-end-sleepers-te/zqdpejo0fsq018mp8i6iep2mk">Tight end</a></b>
      </p>
      <p>Tom Brady (@ Texans) also fits into that group, but we tend to give him the benefit of the doubt in favorable matchups like this. Houston is especially bad at covering backs in the receiving game, so James White gives Brady an added weapon you might not initially think about. Kirk Cousins (@ Seahawks) is in a dreaded "road prime-time" spot, but he handled that with aplomb a few weeks ago in a tougher matchup in Dallas. He should have Adam Thielen (hamstring) back this time around, too.</p>
      <p>Fades this week include the resurgent Baker Mayfield (@ Steelers), the somewhat-inconsistent Dak Prescott (vs. Bills), the relatively low-ceiling Josh Allen (@ Cowboys), and the slumping Philip Rivers (@ Broncos). Prescott is the toughest guy in that group to sit, as he's proven he can produce against anyone. Perhaps he has something special saved up for Thanksgiving, so he's not a "must-sit", but just three QBs have produced even two TDs in a game against the Bills (Baker Mayfield, Andy Dalton, Ryan Fitzpatrick), and none have produced three (Mayfield was the only one to throw for two). Buffalo hasn't exactly faced a murderer's row of QBs this year, so perhaps its numbers are inflated, but Prescott still has his work cut out for him, especially with Amari Cooper (knee) banged up.</p>
