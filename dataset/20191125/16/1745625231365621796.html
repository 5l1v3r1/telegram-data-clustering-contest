      <p><a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/chelsea-houska/">Chelsea Houska</a> showed off her killer figure and fashion sense in the most recent image that was posted on her popular social media page. As those who follow the mother of three on Instagram, Houska loves to share photos of her kids, projects that she is working on, as well as fashion-forward shots as well. In the most recent image that was shared with her millions of fans, Houska sizzled in a casual yet sexy look.</p>
      <p>In the image, the reality star struck a pose against a big, wooden wall that was just a little bit taller than her. The red-headed beauty was all smiles for the shot, holding up an iced latte from Starbucks in one hand and placing the other at her side. She wore her long, red-dyed locks down and curled and wore a grey beanie on top as the weather appeared to be just a little bit chilly. The <i>Teen Mom 2</i> star covered the majority of her face with a large pair of black sunglasses while rocking a beautiful application of makeup that included lipstick.</p>
      <p>The stunner had her killer stems on display in a pair of tight liquid leggings that fit her like a glove, accentuating her muscles. On top, Houska rocked an oversized black and red tie-dye Def Leppard sweatshirt while completing her look with a pair of black combat boot that had little silver studs all over them. The post has only been live on the beauty’s page for a short time but it’s already earned her a ton of attention from fans.</p>
