      <p>“Stevie and Johnny were a delight,” wrote one user. “They made sure our accommodations were met when my wife and I stayed on our anniversary. Place was clean and enjoyable. I loved the complimentary cinnamon rolls.”</p>
      <p>Another five-star review reads, “Was pretty nice. The room next door kept blasting ‘Don’t Cry Out Loud’ all night though.”</p>
      <p>The real motel, which is located in Orangeville, is currently not accepting reservations.</p>
      <p>The final season of “Schitt’s Creek”, which stars Dan Levy, Eugene Levy, Catherine O’Hara and Annie Murphy, premieres on Tuesday, Jan. 7.</p>
