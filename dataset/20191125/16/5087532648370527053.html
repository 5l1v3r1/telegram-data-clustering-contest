      <p>Nike joins other companies in offering 3% cash back to customers who use the Apple Card (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/25/nike-is-latest-retailer-to-offer-3-cash-back-to-apple-card-users/">via</a> <i>TechCrunch</i>).</p>
      <h3>3%</h3>
      <p>The offer works when customers use Apple Pay on any of Nikeâ€™s platforms including retail stores, Nike.com, SKNRS, Nike Training Club, Nike Running Club, and the main Nike app.</p>
      <p>Although the list of 3% merchants is still small, Apple said more partners will be added in the future. Our Apple Card guide below contains the full list of merchants.</p>
