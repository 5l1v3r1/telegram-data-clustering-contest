      <h1>Tidal’s Black Friday/Cyber Monday deals offer four months of Hi-Fi for $1.99</h1>
      <h2>Four months of regular Tidal are coming in at $0.99</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T16:01:08+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 16:01</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mobilesyrup.com/author/brad-bennett" target="_blank">Brad Bennett</a></address>
      <p>Starting now, music listeners who are interested in Tidal’s streaming service can nab a four-month subscription for as low as $0.99 CAD.</p>
      <p>That rock bottom pricing is for subscribers who opt for the basic level of Tidal streaming. That tier usually costs $10 per month.</p>
      <p>The streaming service is offering a better deal on its Hi-Fi streaming option. The high-quality tier of music regularly costs $20 per month, but you can currently get four months of Tidal Hi-Fi for $1.99.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, users who have already created a Tidal account won’t be able to redeem this offer. The fine print says it’s for new accounts only. That said, if you really want to try out Tidal Hi-Fi, you can just make a new account.</p>
