      <h1>Black Friday Strikes Again With Apple Airpod Deals</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T16:00:49+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 16:00</time> by <a rel="author">Shabana Arif</a></address>
      <p>Right now, you can get yourself second gen AirPods and wireless charging case for £159.</p>
      <p>This would usually set you back £199, but <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07PYM8FB8">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://shop.bt.com/products/apple-airpods-with-wireless-charging-case-mrxj2zm-a-F48G.html">BT</a> have both knocked off £40 for Black Friday, for a pretty decent 20 per cent discount.  While these AirPods may not be as easy to stuff into your earholes as the <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/10/apple-announces-airpods-pro-uk/">new AirPods Pro</a>, they did incorporate a few improvements on the previous iteration, like better connectivity and battery life.</p>
      <p>The refreshed version launched earlier this year and look just like the original AirPods, although we did say <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/04/the-new-airpods-are-fine/">in our review</a> that if you already have first gen AirPods, there's little point in upgrading.</p>
      <p>The wireless charging case is a must, so you don't have to piss about with lightning cables, and you'll struggle to find it cheaper elsewhere, so if you're in the market for new AirPods and don't want to spend £249 on the new AirPods Pro, this is the deal to beat right now.</p>
      <p>There's no doubt we'll see more deals and discounts in the run up to Black Friday proper, so if you'd rather sit on the fence until closer to the time to make sure you get the best deal, head over to our <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/tag/black-friday">Black Friday hub</a> for deals updates.
