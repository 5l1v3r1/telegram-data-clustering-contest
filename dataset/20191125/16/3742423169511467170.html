      <h1>Gin &amp; It: The Perfect 'Martini' For People Who Can't Add Up</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T16:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 16:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.lifehacker.com.au/author/claire-lower" target="_blank">Claire Lower</a></address>
      <p>I have made many cocktails in my time, but I am absolute garbage at remembering ratios. For that reason, I really appreciate recipes that call for equal parts of ingredients—even I, with my very scattered brain, can remember something like that.</p>
      <p>The Gin &amp; It is one of those easy to remember drinks that also happens to be extremely my shit. It’s gin (good) and Italian vermouth (also good), which is where the “It” comes from. If you’re in a fun mood, try calling it a “gin innit,” which is what a <i>Love Island</i> contestant would call it. (Also, yes, I have been featuring a lot of Italian vermouth-heavy cocktails lately, but I’m doing you a favour—you need to use that bottle up before it oxidises.)</p>
      <p>This drink is somewhere between a 50/50 martini and a Martinez (the martini-precursor). It is delicious <i>and</i> slightly lower proof than your standard martini, which is something I appreciate during holiday party season. I tend to crave darker, sweeter stuff in the warmer months, so this is an ideal summer drink for me. Just like <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com.au/2019/11/ease-your-way-into-sherry-with-the-adonis">last week’s cocktail</a>, you’ll want good gin and good vermouth, as you’ll be getting a full mouth of each. I enjoy this cocktail up (like a martini) but it wouldn’t be bad on a big rock, or with a strip of orange zest. To make it, you will need:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>45mL dry gin</li>
        <li>45mL ounces Italian vermouth</li>
        <li>2 dashes orange bitters</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Add everything to a stirring glass filled with ice and stir until well chilled. Strain into a chilled coupe and enjoy.</p>
