      <h1>Android security: Analysis, advice, and next-level knowledge</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T16:16:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 16:16</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.itworld.com/author/JR-Raphael/" target="_blank">JR Raphael</a></address>
      <p>It's tough to talk about Android security without venturing into sensational terrain.</p>
      <p>A large part of that is due to the simple fact that the forces driving most Android security coverage are companies that make their money by selling Android security software — and thus companies with strong interests in pushing the narrative that every Android phone is on the perpetual brink of grave, unfathomable danger. Plus, let's face it: A headline about 70 gazillion Android phones being vulnerable to the MegaMonsterSkullCrusher Virus is far more enticing than one explaining the nuanced realities of Android security.</p>
      <p>In actuality, though, Android security is a complex beast — one with multiple layers in place to protect you and one that almost never warrants an alarmist attitude. I've been covering Android security closely since the platform's earliest days, and I've <u><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3268904">busted more myths</a></u> and <u><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3105569/android/android-quadrooter.html">called out more shameless publicity stunts</a></u> than I can even count at this point.</p>
      <p>So allow me to be your guide in navigating the ever-changing arena of Android security and the misleading halo of information around it. From practical advice to in-depth analysis, you can find all my current Android security coverage in the frequently updated sections below.</p>
      <p>The most important thing to take away from this? Take a deep breath. Regardless of what you may have read elsewhere, there's rarely any reason to panic — and things are almost certainly going to be OK.</p>
