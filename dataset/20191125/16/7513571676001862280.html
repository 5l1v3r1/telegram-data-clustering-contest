        <b>Tony Blair, former British prime minister says Britain is in a mess, accusing Labour and Conservative Parties of “peddling fantasies”.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Britain is holding an election three years ahead of schedule because parliament was deadlocked over Brexit, unable to agree on how or even whether to leave the European Union.</p>
      <p>Commenting on this, Blair said neither his own Labour Party nor Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Conservatives deserve to win the December 12 election.</p>
      <p>“We’re a mess. The buoyancy of the world economy has kept us going up to now, but should that falter, we will be in deep trouble,’’ Blair said.</p>
      <p>“The problem with revolutions is never how they begin but how they end. The problem with revolutions is that they always end badly.</p>
      <p>“The truth is: the public isn’t convinced either main party deserves to win this election outright.’’</p>
      <p>The election is between a socialist-run state under Labour, which is offering a second referendum on leaving the EU, and the free-market Conservatives, who want to “get Brexit done” by the end of January.</p>
      <p>Blair, an opponent of Brexit, argued for a second referendum on the decision to leave, saying it would need to be followed by another general election.</p>
      <p>Johnson has pledged to take Britain out of the EU by January 31 if he wins a parliamentary majority and then to negotiate a comprehensive deal but Blair said there was still a risk that Britain could exit the EU in a year’s time without having struck a deal with its biggest trading partner.</p>
      <p>“No-deal Brexit is not off the table. This negotiation (on the future relationship) has no chance of being concluded in that transition period,” he said.</p>
