      <p>New Orleans Saints Pro Bowl left tackle Terron Armstead could miss several weeks after suffering a high-ankle sprain in Sunday’s 34-31 win against the Carolina Panthers, NFL Network reported Monday.</p>
      <p>Armstead, 28, was helped off the field in the first quarter and then carted to the locker room after being checked out in the sideline medical tent.</p>
      <p>A third-round pick by the Saints in 2013, Armstead has never made it through a 16-game season without missing time to injuries. His 11 starts this season were his most since 2015, and he has played in only 71 of a possible 107 regular-season games.</p>
      <p>Armstead almost certainly will not play this Sunday in Atlanta, a rematch of the Falcons’ 26-9 upset win in New Orleans on Nov. 10.</p>
      <p>The 2018 Pro Bowl selection was replaced by veteran Patrick Omameh. New Orleans already is playing without starting left guard Andrus Peat, who broke his arm in the Atlanta loss.</p>
