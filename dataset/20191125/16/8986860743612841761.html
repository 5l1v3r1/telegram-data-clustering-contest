This revelation came around 4 am – I quickly gave her name out to all the prophets that God has surround me with. We fast and wage warfare prayers. Just 7 days after the fast a strange woman chased me physically on a highway and cut in my lane. I wasn’t moved nor scared…<br/>I have escaped the fowler’s trap and the snare has been broken. Psalm 124:7 ???. I declare and degree as an Oracle of God, on this day, I exchange her soul for the evil scheme she’s been plotting against my life #ki</i>n<i>gdom</i>“</p>
