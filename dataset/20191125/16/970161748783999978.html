      <p>Louis Tomlinson lent his support to Vinnie Jones after the actor lost out on a place in the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/the-x-factor/">X Factor</a>: Celebrity final.</p>
      <p>Saturday’s semi-final saw a star-studded audience watch the likes of Megan McKenna and girl group V5.</p>
      <p>Louis, a former X Factor judge himself, was spotted leaving the show with Vinnie and mucking about in front of people stood outside.</p>
      <p>The singer was in good spirits as stopped to take pictures with fans, and posed next to the former footballer who had his arm around Louis’ shoulders.</p>
      <p>After his exit from the live shows, Vinnie <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/24/vinnie-jones-thanks-simon-cowell-helping-grief-following-x-factor-celebrity-exit-11209339/">thanked Simon for helping him get through a difficult time</a> after the death of his wife.</p>
      <p>In a video shared on social media, the Snatch star said:‘Been a fantastic journey, absolutely enjoyed it,’ Vinnie began. ‘Simon, thank you so much for getting me through my grief, helping me a hell of a lot with it. ‘I will always be indebted to you my friend. Thank you very much.’</p>

      <p>He added: ‘All the fans out there, I’ve had a terrific time.’</p>
      <p>Megan and V5 also had big smiles, understandable as they are both now X Factor: Celebrity finalists along with Max and Harvey and Jenny Ryan.</p>

      <p>He must be feeling pretty pleased with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/24/left-x-factor-celebrity-last-night-semi-final-11208778/">himself having two acts – V5 and musical.ly personalities Max and Harvey – in the grand final</a>.</p>
      <p>Louis and Nicole are still in with a fighting chance as their respective acts, Megan and Jenny, will be singing to win on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>Last Saturday Try Star were also sent home, made up of rugby players Thom Evans, Ben Foden and Levi Davis.</p>
