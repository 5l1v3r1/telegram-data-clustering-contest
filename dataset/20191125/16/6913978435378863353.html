      <p><b>BENI, D.R. Congo —</b> Protesters stormed a UN peacekeepers' camp near the eastern D.R. Congo town of Beni on Monday, angered by failures to curb a notorious armed group that killed eight civilians overnight, a reporter said.<br/><br/>Demonstrators invaded one of two camps on the town's outskirts despite gunshots fired by Congolese security forces seeking to disperse the crowd.<br/><br/>Dozens broke into the camp, which had apparently been evacuated, and set fire to a part of it, a reporter saw.<br/><br/>They were among an angry crowd several hundred strong that had headed to the camps after setting fire to Beni town hall, partially damaging it.<br/><br/>The Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) militia has plagued eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) for decades, despite the presence of a large UN force and repeated declarations by the government to root it out.<br/><br/>Army spokesman Colonel Mak Hazukai confirmed that the town had been attacked by armed men overnight, saying that "the enemy entered the Boikene quarter and killed eight civilians".<br/><br/>In the town center, two policemen were seen bleeding heavily from wounds after the morning protest, a reporter saw.<br/><br/>A demonstrator died when police opened fire on Saturday. Two policemen were killed the same day by angry demonstrators, the UN Okapi radio said.<br/><br/>Seventy-seven civilians have been killed in the Beni region since Nov. 5, according to a not-for-profit organization, the Congo Research Group (CRG).<br/><br/>The army launched an offensive against the ADF on Oct. 30, vowing to "definitively wipe out" armed groups in the lawless east.<br/><br/>The ADF's historical roots lie in extremist Ugandans opposed to Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni.<br/><br/>The group has plagued the North Kivu region bordering Uganda since the Congo Wars in the 1990s, although its membership has since broadened to non-Ugandans and it has not carried out an attack in Uganda for years.<br/><br/>Daesh (the so-called IS) has claimed some of the attacks ascribed to the ADF this year, but there is no clear evidence of any affiliation between the two groups.<br/><br/>MONUSCO — the United Nations Organization Stablization Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo — is one of the biggest UN peacekeeping operations in the world.<br/><br/>It was established in 2010, taking over from a UN mission in Congo called MONUC, set up in 1999 at the height of the second Congo War.<br/><br/>The mission today comprises more than 16,500 military personnel and observers, 1,300 police and at least 4,000 civilians.<br/><br/>But it has struggled to make headway in a vast country beset by armed groups as well as entrenched poverty and poor governance.<br/><br/>On Monday, the speaker of the D.R. Congo parliament, Jeanine Mabunda, said MONUSCO's mission "cannot be limitless".<br/><br/>"There is an unease over the presence, the cost of MONUSCO in the DRC, and the results obtained," Mabanda said in Paris.<br/><br/>She said it was "legitimate for people to ask why this force is still in the DRC."<br/><br/>On Saturday, the mission said the Congolese army had launched its anti-militia offensive unilaterally, and this was why it could not intervene.<br/><br/>"MONUSCO cannot engage in operations in a war zone without being asked and without strict coordination with the national army," it explained in a tweet.<br/><br/>Uncoordinated action could lead to casualties from friendly fire, it added.<br/><br/>Beni, in addition to being in the front line of militia violence, is also the epicenter of an Ebola epidemic that has killed around 2,200 people since August 2018.<br/><br/>On Friday, the World Health Organization (WHO) said fighting in the region could jeopardize an opportunity to end the outbreak.<br/><br/>Also in eastern DR Congo, at least 29 people were killed on Sunday when a small plane crashed after takeoff, smashing into a densely populated area of the city of Goma. — AFP</p>
