      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T16:57:13+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 16:57</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishtimes.com/profile/mary-carolan-7.1837414" target="_blank">Mary Carolan</a></address>
      <p>A boy who fell 2m (7ft) to the ground while in a playzone area has settled his <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=High+Court">High Court</a> action for €65,000.</p>
      <p>Jamie Cummins was aged three when he fractured his right thigh bone in the fall as he climbed steps to access the mid-level of a three tier play and slide area at Wexford Playzone.</p>
      <p>Jamie Cummins, Mount Prospect, <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=Clonard">Clonard</a>, <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=Co+Wexford">Co Wexford</a>, sued Wexford Playzone Ltd, Clonard, Co Wexford as a result of the accident on July 18th, 2015. The case was taken through his mother, Leanne Moore.</p>
      <p>The boy was climbing the leatherette covered steps ahead of his mother when he fell down an opening and then down a series of climbing steps to the ground.</p>
      <p>He was taken to hospital and a fracture of his right thigh was diagnosed.</p>
      <p>The High Court heard liability was at issue in the case. The boy had attended the playzone with his parents and sister.</p>
      <p>His mother, the court was told, was right behind her son and arrived at the top behind him.</p>
      <p>The mother was assisting the boy’s sister to come up the final step when the accident happened.</p>
      <p>Approving the settlement, Mr Justice Garrett Simons noted liability was at issue in the case and he was satisfied to rule the matter as proposed.</p>
