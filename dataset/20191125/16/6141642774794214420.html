      <p>Mr Webster attended the official opening in Chengdu over the weekend, and said he was “genuinely surprised” at how good the fish and chips – made to his own shop’s recipe – tasted.</p>
      <p>“I was worried before I arrived but they are very, very good,” he told the PA news agency. “The one thing from the beginning with Jimmy Yu, he wanted to be authentic.</p>

      <p>Mr Webster found success with visitors from China to Yorkshire after having his menu translated into Mandarin and establishing a presence for his shop on Chinese social media.</p>
      <p>That saw coach parties of tourists from China eating at the shop and earned coverage in Chinese media last year, which brought it to the attention of Mr Yu.</p>

      <p>“They are looking to roll it out across China with already talk of two or three more sites next year,” Mr Webster said. “We’ve met the investors and had dinner, and they’re really excited. You never know, but it could be the start of a good partnership.”</p>
      <p>The food seems to have been a success with the locals so far, with the only issue being the portion size.</p>
      <p>“One of the things we’ve found in the UK and they’re finding here is the portion is too big,” Mr Webster said. “I was talking to some customers on Saturday and there were two ladies sharing one portion, so they’re going to start doing a small portion.”</p>

      <p>While Mr Webster says he has shared all his “recipes and methodologies” with the new shop, there is one traditional aspect of the cooking process that has not yet been adopted.</p>
      <p>Mr Webster said: “They’re in veg oil at the minute but I’ve had words with them at the weekend to say, ‘look, you need to try and find some beef dripping out here’.”</p>
