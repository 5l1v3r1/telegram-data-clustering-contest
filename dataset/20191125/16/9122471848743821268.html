      <h1>What The BCS Rankings Would Look Like Heading Into Rivalry Week</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T16:14:20+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 16:14</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>The final week of the 2019 college football regular season has arrived. It’s the best week of the year – Rivalry Week.</p>
      <p>This year’s rivalry games will have some major College Football Playoff implications, with Ohio State taking on Michigan, Alabama facing Auburn and Oklahoma playing Oklahoma State, among others.</p>
      <p>The top 25 polls <a href="https://thespun.com/college-football/week-14-coaches-poll-top-25-released">updated on Sunday afternoon</a> and the new College Football Playoff rankings will be out on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>What if the BCS rankings were still around? What would they look like right now?</p>
      <p>Here are the hypothetical BCS rankings:</p>

      <p>As you can see, if the BCS was still around, it would be a three-team race for those two national title spots, with LSU and Ohio State having the leg up on Clemson.</p>
      <p>The College Football Playoff takes four teams, thankfully, and this year’s major debate will be about the No. 4 spot.</p>
      <p>Will it be Alabama? Oklahoma? Utah?</p>
      <p>We’ll find out in two weeks.</p>
