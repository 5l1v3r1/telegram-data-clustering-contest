        <b>As Anupam Kher's film The Hotel Mumbai is nearing its release date, we caught up with the actor for a quick chat about the film, his character of Hemant Oberoi and also the horrific 26/11 terror attack that hit Mumbai</b>

      <p>Anupam Kher’s rich repertoire of films over the past few decades proves that he’s unstoppable with his fab performances. As his upcoming film Hotel Mumbai is slated to release on Nov 29, we interact with the actor to know what went into its making.</p>
      <p>Hotel Mumbai is based on the 2008 Mumbai attacks that happened at Taj Mahal Palace hotel. It ain’t easy to recreate a dastardly act done by terrorists that still sends shivers down our spine. And for Anupam Kher too, it wasn’t easy to immediately say a yes when he was approached for the film by Australian filmmaker Anthony Maras.</p>
      <p>But, he was blown away by the director’s research and gave a go ahead. Anupam Kher essays the real life role of Taj Hotel Chef, Hemant Oberoi in the film. Speaking about his character, the actor said, “I'm the only person who is playing a real character Hemant Oberoi who was part of the tragedy. He was the chef at that time.” Well, the other characters in the film are fictional creations like Dev Patel plays the role of Arjun, a fictional character who’s working under Hemant Oberoi at the hotel.</p>

      <p>Furthermore, the actor revealed how humbled he was to meet Hemant Oberoi during the film’s screening at Toronto International Film Festival. “I was told that Hemant Oberoi is in the audience watching the film and it was a humbling experience. I broke down because he was the real hero. I met him backstage and I was humbled. I'm happy that he hugged me and said I don't think anybody else could have done this role,” said Kher.</p>

      <p>Then, he even spoke about dabbling between Hollywood and Bollywood and finally, we asked him about the failure of his last screen outing The Accidental Prime Minister. Without batting an eyelid, with a smile on his face, Anupam Kher told us that he still feels proud of the film and would count it amongst his top 5 performances.<br/><br/><br/><i>Image Source:- youtube/zeestudios/spotboyeteam</i></p>
