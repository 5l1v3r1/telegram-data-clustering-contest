        <h3>What Is Creativity?</h3>
        <p>Creativity is the ability or tendency to recognize and curate ideas, possibilities, alternatives that are crucial to solving issues, connect others, and entertain one another.</p>
        <p>When we talk about creativity, some names readily come to mind.</p>
        <p>It’s interesting to know that most of these creative people from Beethoven to Steve Jobs are ordinary people who exceptionally perform ordinary things. Therefore, it will not be an understatement to add your name to the list if you think you are creative.</p>
        <p>You may disqualify yourself because you have not created anything new. This has been found out to be a great misconception when discussing <a href="https://www.lifehack.org/810923/what-is-creativity">how creativity works</a>. Creativity is not only about inventing something new. There is nothing ever new or original. Every genius that has ever worked the face of the earth has only learned how to connect ideas and things to generate meaningful value.</p>
        <anchor name="why-is-creativity-important">
          <h3>Why Is Creativity Important?</h3>
          <p>People aspire to learn how to be creative for the following reasons:</p>
          <h4>The Need to Impact Meaningful Values</h4>
          <p>We are here to change the world. If you want to make a significant difference in life, there is a likely chance you are tapping the innate creative ability on your inside.</p>
          <h4>The Need to Address Problems</h4>
          <p>The world will become short of creative people once we stop having issues that threaten our existence like global warming.</p>
          <p>Is there darkness in the world? A genius will invent light. Is the light not eco-friendly? Another creative person will design how to leverage solar power to light up the world, and the chain becomes endless.</p>
          <h4>The Need for Complex, Varied and Novel Stimulation</h4>
          <p>If you hate the status quo like me, there is a chance you will end up with an innovative idea. Creative individuals learn how to look at life from other perspectives. They don’t go with the flow. They test a series of alternatives that can contribute meaningful value to life.</p>

            <h3>10 Creative Thinking Methods</h3>
            <p>So how can you be creative on demand? Here’re 10 thinking methods you should know:</p>
            <h4>1. Creative Problem Solving</h4>
            <p>This is a means of addressing issues or identifying opportunities when conventional thought processes have failed to yield results. The method encourages you to discover fresh perspectives and devise innovative ideas or solutions to surmount a daunting challenge.</p>
            <h4>2. Brainstorming</h4>
            <p>This technique is deployed to tackle a design problem. It usually comprises a group that is guided by a facilitator. The capability of each session is inherent in the ability of the participants to draw a connection between their novel ideas in the outside world.</p>
            <p>Alex Osborn, the inventor of brainstorming in his book, <i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000Z43XYG?tag=s7621-20">Applied Imagination</a></i> written in 1953, affirmed that,</p>
            <blockquote>“We aim squarely at a particular design problem and generate an arsenal of possible solutions. By not just harvesting our ideas but putting into consideration our colleagues’ concept, we cover the issue from all angles imaginable.”</blockquote>
            <h4>3. Charette</h4>
            <p>It is a thorough planning session that connects designers, citizens, and other polymaths to collaborate on a developmental cause. It offers an opportunity for sharing ideas and provides a rare privilege of communicating feedbacks instantly to the designers. It facilitates inclusion and makes everyone a mutual author of the development.</p>
            <h4>4. Critical Thinking</h4>
            <p>This is an objective analysis of facts to generate a conclusion. It is self-disciplined, self-directed, self-corrective thinking and self-guided. It incorporates problem-solving abilities, practical communication skills, and the tenacity to surmount your native sociocentrism (a tendency of viewing the world from your cultural or social perspective) and egocentrism( failure to differentiate yourself from others).</p>

            <h4>5. Interactive Planning</h4>
            <p>Russell L. Ackoff defined it as establishing a future by creating a desirable present. Interacting Planning or IAP is a technique employed by project managers to engage relevant stakeholders, as well as subject matter experts.</p>
            <p>The engagement process includes a collective discussion of the project plan and the strategy to design a dependable, holistic, and an active project schedule. It is often called Participative Planning(PP).</p>
            <p>A notable benefit of this method is it helps everyone to understand the project scope and design a realistic schedule. It is also a conduit pipe for effective communication to flow. It is relevant in identifying critical milestones, constraints, and assumptions.</p>
            <h4>6. Force-Field Analysis</h4>
            <p>This analysis pinpoints the competing forces that surround an issue and employs brainstorming to discover the solutions. It was invented in the 1940s by Kurt Lewin. He initially utilized the technique in his project as a social psychologist. However, it has found relevance in the business environment. It is useful in establishing, sharing go, or no-go decisions.</p>
            <p>The concept of this technique is that circumstances are established via a balance between forces that drive disruption or change and the ones that resist it. The driving actors must be empowered to cause change, or the negating forces must be weakened. <a href="https://www.lifehack.org/856822/how-to-train-your-brain-to-be-creative#footnote_plugin_tooltip_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>
            <h4>7. K-J Method</h4>
            <p>It is a technique that derived its name from its inventor, Jiro Kawakita. It is a facilitated session where participants highlight their priorities on a card, collate them collectively, and arrange them by relationship via individual voting.</p>
            <p>The objective of the method is to arrive at a consensus of valid information, especially in a group where individuals are bound to disagree.</p>
            <p>Here I’ll just briefly describe how to implement it:<a href="https://www.lifehack.org/856822/how-to-train-your-brain-to-be-creative#footnote_plugin_tooltip_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>
            <ol>
              <li>Gather five or more individuals together in a conducive room for 90 minutes. Give them markers and sticky notes.</li>
              <li>Establish a focused question that bothers on the project’s requirement and assign a facilitator to oversee the exercise</li>
              <li>Allocate 5 minutes for writing three answers to the items on the notes.</li>
              <li>Allocate 15 minutes to participants to stick their answers on the board, read others’ responses, and add to it. Guide them to cluster similar solutions without discussing them.</li>
              <li>Request participants to label each cluster individually. Make this mandatory. They can also segregate clusters.</li>
              <li>Put each name on the board cluster-by-cluster. Isolate duplicate words.</li>
              <li>Combine duplicate responses as long as the group agrees they are similar.</li>
              <li>Three or four teams will typically rank higher compared to others-those responses are relevant for the question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>8. Lateral Thinking</h4>
            <p>This technique is all about looking at a concept from different angles. It is a deliberate and systematic process.</p>
            <p>Check out the article <a href="https://www.lifehack.org/articles/work/think-laterally.html">Think Laterally</a> to learn more.</p>
            <h4>10. Play to Innovate Method</h4>
            <p>Individuals and teams unlock their innate potentialities by going through a fascinating, play-like technique. This method harnesses the creative power of the brain using playfulness.</p>
            <p>Several people believe we work to sustain a living outside of work. We go through work and life without locating a means of staying happy. Play to innovate methods changes the ball game. It asks, ” What if we adjust the work culture and provide reasons for people to work without monetary incentives. This hack examines making work playful while enjoying the benefits of creativity and innovation. <a href="https://www.lifehack.org/856822/how-to-train-your-brain-to-be-creative#footnote_plugin_tooltip_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>
            <h4>10. SWOT Analysis</h4>
            <p>SWOT is an acronym that stands for Strength, Weakness, Opportunities, and Threats. You can find out more about this in <a href="https://www.lifehack.org/602339/how-swot-analysis-turns-risks-into-opportunities/feed">How SWOT Analysis Turns Risks Into Opportunities</a>.</p>
            <anchor name="how-to-be-more-creative-if-youre-not-naturally-creative">
              <h3>How To Be More Creative If You’re Not Naturally Creative</h3>
              <p>Besides the above thinking methods, start trying the following ways to be more creative:</p>
              <h4>1. Distinguish Between Problem-Solving and Ruminating</h4>
              <p>It is helpful to think about approaches that will aid you in surmounting a challenge, but it is less productive to picture yourself unable to accommodate the pain. Anytime you are deliberating on a matter, take time out to see if you are problem-solving, or just ruminating.</p>
              <p>If the former, sustain the process. But if you are thinking about things you cannot control or that have occurred, it is a mere waste of time. Declutter your mind and allow your brain to focus on meaningful and productive activities.</p>
              <h4>2. Implement the Same Advice You Will Give a Confidant.</h4>
              <p>A lot of people find it easy to criticize themselves. Do you know that magnifying your weak points will only limit and drag you down?</p>
              <p>Research has linked self-compassion to emotional well-being. The NCBI research indicated that self-compassion affects every dimension of well-being. It enhances your self-esteem and activates your can-do spirit. <a href="https://www.lifehack.org/856822/how-to-train-your-brain-to-be-creative#footnote_plugin_tooltip_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>
              <p>Therefore, speak to yourself as you would talk to a friend.</p>
              <h4>3. Name-Tag Your Emotion</h4>
              <p>Most people, especially men, rarely talk about their feelings. Thus, a lot of people have created a gap between themselves and their feelings. This will only make it difficult for you to detect how you feel at any point in time.</p>
              <p>Most times, when you name-tag your feelings as adults, you do so using an indirect approach. You say something like, “I have butterflies in my stomach,” when you are nervous.</p>
              <p>It is not a sin to acknowledge your feeling. Give those emotions names and identify how they can impact your decisions.</p>
              <p>Spend time each day to perform emotional acknowledgment exercise. If something bothers you, note it down instead of transferring aggression (the consequence of not taking charge of your emotion) on others.</p>
              <h4>4. Balance Your Feelings with Logic</h4>
              <p>Peradventure you are battling with a chronic disease or facing a difficult financial situation, you will make informed decisions when you can establish an equilibrium between your emotion and logic. Allow the rational part of you to lead when your emotion is attaining its peak.</p>
              <p>Another approach to step down your emotions is to identify the consequences of your actions. Perusing the list will enable you to minimize the influence of your emotions on your decision.</p>
              <h4>5. Practice Gratitude</h4>
              <p>Research has found out that gratitude-oriented people exhibit increased wellness. A deliberate focus on the good side of life will produce interpersonal and emotional benefits, including happiness. <a href="https://www.lifehack.org/856822/how-to-train-your-brain-to-be-creative#footnote_plugin_tooltip_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>
              <p>Negative people can never be creative. Make a habit of listing what you are grateful for- the morning breakfast, the sunny weather, the green pasture, and many more. Practice journaling before retiring to bed. Allow your brain to reflect on the right things happening within and around you. Focusing on the sunny aspect of life will impact your wellness.</p>

              <h4>6. Develop a Healthy Mentality</h4>
              <p>If you desire to attain a peak in life, educate your brain now and then. You need to train your brain for success by speaking positive and meaningful words.</p>
              <h4>Bonus: Crack Your Cocoon!</h4>
              <p>According to Bill Stainton, isolating ourselves from weird people, or what he called ‘staying inside our cocoon’ robs us of creative ideas that possess the highest capability to address our biggest challenges. It is by cracking your cocoon or embracing individuals and weird experiences that you will discover the link that leads to breakthrough ideas. <a href="https://www.lifehack.org/856822/how-to-train-your-brain-to-be-creative#footnote_plugin_tooltip_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>
              <anchor name="bottom-line">
                <h3>Bottom Line</h3>
                <p>Creativity is a seed of greatness. You can become great and significant only if you take the responsibility to train your brain for breakthrough ideas.</p>
                <p>There are many techniques to adapt to nurture your innate creativity to fruition. Find what works for you, and do not forget to crack your cocoon! Creativity can rub on you when you associate with creative people.</p>
