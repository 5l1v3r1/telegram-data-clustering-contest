      <h1>Heart Plan New Music for 2020</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T16:15:17+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 16:15</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Wardlaw</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/heart/">Heart</a> returned to the road this past summer after a three-year absence from touring. Their <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/heart-2019-reunion-tour/">first headlining shows</a> since 2016 topped a bill that also included <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/joan-jett/">Joan Jett</a>, <a href="https://popcrush.com/tags/sheryl-crow/">Sheryl Crow</a>, <a href="https://tasteofcountry.com/tags/brandi-carlile/">Brandi Carlile</a> and Elle King.</p>
      <p>The tour found <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/ann-wilson/">Ann</a> and <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/nancy-wilson/">Nancy Wilson</a> blitzing across North America, and now, as Nancy tells UCR, they’re hoping to keep things moving forward in 2020 with new music. “The tour was really exciting after three years of not being [out there],” she says.</p>
      <p>On break until the spring, she plans to make good use of the downtime. “I’ve got a lot of song ideas in my head and in my notes on my phone, and [I’ve been] singing into my phone," she explains. "So I think that new Heart material would be really great, because the last album we did was <i><a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/heart-beautiful-broken/">Beautiful Broken</a></i>, [where] we kind of redid some of our favorite [songs from Heart's catalog].”</p>
      <p>Roadcase Royale, the band Nancy <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/roadcase-royale-debut-album/">formed</a> during Heart's hiatus, will be put on hold for the new year as Heart plans shows at some of the places they didn't get to this year.  “[With] the Heart thing, the whale swallowed the sailor there,” she admits. “I think the next smart move would be to get some new Heart stuff going and then take it out on the road again. But not the same shed tour. Canada wants us up there ... and probably some European dates and some other festivals and stuff like that. Things that don’t imitate what we just did.”</p>
      <p>Wilson has also been busy with other projects. She was recently at the <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/category/rock-and-roll-hall-of-fame/">Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</a> in Cleveland to celebrate the launch of the museum’s <a href="https://www.rockhall.com/play-it-loud-exhibit-open"><i>Play It Loud</i> </a>exhibit, which features her classic <a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/818718">1978 Ovation acoustic guitar</a>.</p>
      <p>“They knew that I’d seen one and it was a one-off, I think, that they’d made for Jim Messina of <a href="https://www.logginsandmessina.com/bio2.html">Loggins and Messina</a>," explains Wilson, who was<a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/heart-hall-of-fame-induction/"> inducted</a> into the Rock Hall in 2013 with Heart. "My heart flew out of my body when I saw that guitar. I knew that I needed one of those guitars, so they made me one too.”</p>
      <p>She played the instrument extensively in the '70s, and it still showed up onstage in the next decade too. “Stylistically, things changed up in the ‘80s,” Wilson notes. “So I played a lot more of the ‘80s-style, whammy-bar things for a while. The Ovation carbon top went into storage for maybe 20 years or so. When they called me about the guitar to maybe put it in the <a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2019/play-it-loud">[initial] exhibit</a> at the Met, I pulled it back out of storage and I opened it up, and it was perfectly in tune and it played beautifully.”</p>
      <p>Wilson says the "strings didn’t even feel rusty. It had just been waiting there for me to rediscover it and fall in love again. Now, it’s the only guitar that went on tour without me. So when I got to see it again, I was like, ‘Hi, I can’t wait until you can come home with me again!’ That’s a real special guitar.”</p>

      <h3>Heart Albums Ranked </h3>

      <h4>16: 'Private Audition' (1982)</h4>
      <p>Heart's sixth studio album, 1982's moody 'Private Audition,' is the first time the group felt fallible. Besides some overlooked standouts—the R&amp;B-inspired Top 40 hit "This Man Is Mine" and the fuzzed-out "The Situation"—the record was the sound of uncertainty, and a band trying to navigate an increasingly slick musical environment.</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>15: 'Heart Presents a Lovemongers' Christmas' (1998 / 2001)</h4>
      <p>This 2001 album was originally released in 1998 as a Lovemongers record, under the name 'Here Is Christmas.' This straight reissue, while a lovely representation of the group's acoustic compositions and bewitching harmonies, is one of the least essential releases in Heart's catalog.</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>14: 'Magazine' (1977 / 1978)</h4>
      <p>Heart's second LP emerged in a storm of controversy; in fact, a half-finished, rough version of the album was initially released by Mushroom Records in 1977 without the band's consent after their relationship with the label soured. The distractions had a deleterious effect on 'Magazine,' even after it was reissued in 1978. Although the funky "Heartless" remains a setlist staple to this day, and both a live version of "I've Got The Music In Me" and the Badfinger cover "Without You" are sublime, the record ended up as a weak sophomore effort.</p>

        <figcaption>Capitol</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h4>13: 'Desire Walks On' (1993)</h4>
      <p>This arrived in the midst of grunge's domination, which perhaps explains why Alice In Chains' Layne Staley pops up on backing vocals on the Bob Dylan cover "Ring Them Bells." Yet the record's production has an unfortunate '80s hangover, which mars the otherwise-impeccable Led Zeppelin nod "Rage," majestic "In Walks The Night" and the earnest hard rocker "My Crazy Head."</p>
      <hr/>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://townsquare.media/site/295/files/2015/07/Passionworks.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Epic</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h4>12: 'Passionworks' (1983)</h4>
      <p>Although Heart's 1985 self-titled album is generally considered to be the band's foray into contemporary-sounding hard rock, 'Passionworks' actually marks the band's biggest sonic shift to date. Produced by Keith Olsen, who had also worked with Fleetwood Mac and Rick Springfield, the LP adds studio slickness atop the band's heartfelt songs. The resulting collection is underrated, from the urgent, percussion-heavy AOR shoulda-been "Sleep Alone" to the scrappy power-pop of "How Can I Refuse."</p>

        <figcaption>Sovereign</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h4>11: 'Jupiters Darling' (2004)</h4>
      <p>One of the lesser-known parts of Heart's catalog, 'Jupiters Darling,' is also one of its most underrated albums. The first record to be mostly co-written by the Wilsons in several decades, the LP is a raw, organic-sounding collection that boasts solid songwriting; check out the slithering, grungy "Move On" and brisk, acoustic riff-driven "Make Me."</p>
      <hr/>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://townsquare.media/site/295/files/2015/07/Bad-Animals.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Capitol</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h4>10: 'Bad Animals' (1987)</h4>
      <p>Although there's no messing with the soaring "Who Will You Run To" and the dynamic "Alone," 'Bad Animals' is an ever-so-slightly inferior version of the modern-sounding hard rock on 1985's 'Heart.' Still, the Nancy Wilson co-written "There's the Girl," which the band has revived on more recent tours, and the Bangles-esque Wilson-Sue Ennis composition "Easy Target," stand tall against any classic Heart tunes.</p>

        <figcaption>Concord Music Group</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h4>9: 'Beautiful Broken' (2016)</h4>
      <p>For seven of the 10 tracks on'Beautiful Broken,' Heart revisit songs they feel were done right the first time around. The new arrangements and performances put the focus back on the quality of those songs, especially "Down on Me" and "Sweet Darlin'" Of the newer material, "Heaven" shows off their debt Led Zeppelin, while the title track is a blistering duet with Metallica's James Hetfield.</p>

        <img src="https://townsquare.media/site/295/files/2015/07/Brigade.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Capitol</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h4>8: 'Brigade' (1990)</h4>
      <p>Heart took steps to shed the too-glossy rock &amp; roll image into which they had been forced, as underscored by the folk-leaning "Under The Sky," horn-peppered "Tall, Dark Handsome Stranger" and the snarling, Sammy Hagar co-write "The Night." In fact, save for the wince-inducing "All I Wanna Do Is Make Love To You," 'Brigade' is a step in the right direction, one where the Wilsons were back doing Heart on their own terms.</p>

        <img src="https://townsquare.media/site/295/files/2015/07/Red-Velvet-Car.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Sony Legacy</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h4>7: 'Red Velvet Car' (2010)</h4>
      <p>This fantastic release contains down-and-dirty rock jams ("WTF," "Death Valley"), tender acoustic ballads ("Hey You") and sunburned psych-pop ("Sunflower"). It also features some of the band's strongest, most poignant lyrics to date.</p>
      <hr/>

        <figcaption>Capitol</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h4>6: 'Heart' (1985)</h4>
      <p>This was the band's commercial breakthrough, a collection of songs steered by glittering keyboards, crisp pop hooks and (at least on the squealing hard rocker "If Looks Could Kill" and power ballads "What About Love" and "These Dreams") outside songwriters. Although Ann and Nancy Wilson look back at this time with mixed feelings, the former's vocal performance on "Never" and the latter's lead vocal on "These Dreams" are exemplary – and, for as dated as the production sounds today, it's a remarkably cohesive record. Plus, the second side's "What He Don't Know," a classic Wilsons-Sue Ennis composition, is quite underrated.</p>

        <figcaption>Sony Legacy</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h4>5: 'Fanatic' (2012)</h4>
      <p>This album is arguably heavier than 'Red Velvet Car'; check out the string-laced rocker "Dear Old America," distorted blues stomp "Skin And Bones," the Led Zeppelin-esque title track and howling "Mashalla." Like 'Red Velvet Car,' however, the album contains forceful, thoughtful lyrics that cut to the quick and linger well beyond the record's end.</p>

        <figcaption>Epic</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h4>4: 'Bebe Le Strange' (1980)</h4>
      <p>This was the first Heart LP without Michael and Roger Fisher, which is perhaps why Ann and Nancy Wilson's songwriting feels so unconstrained by expectations. Highlights of the hard-rockin' album include the ferocious bar-band piano driving "Raised On You" and the crisp Tower Of Power horn sizzle on "Even It Up."</p>
      <hr/>

        <img src="https://townsquare.media/site/295/files/2015/07/Dreamboat-Annie.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Mushroom</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h4>3: 'Dreamboat Annie' (1976)</h4>
      <p>Few first albums are as fully formed (and confident-sounding) as Heart's debut. Come for the classic singles "Crazy On You" and "Magic Man"; stay for the blues-country boogie "White Lightning &amp; Wine," poetic gem "Soul Of The Sea" and the gentle, acoustic guitar-ruffled title track.</p>
      <hr/>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://townsquare.media/site/295/files/2015/07/Dog-and-Butterfly.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Epic</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h4>2: 'Dog and Butterfly' (1978)</h4>
      <p>Cut from the same cloth as 1977's 'Little Queen,' this album alternates between dreamy folk passages and nervy classic rock grooves. Still, the title track may contain some of the band's finest lyrics, while the laid-back "Straight On" embodies Heart's ability to move fluidly between genres, all in one song.</p>
      <hr/>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://townsquare.media/site/295/files/2015/07/Little-Queen.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Portrait</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h4>1: 'Little Queen' (1977)</h4>
      <p>In hindsight, Heart's third LP felt much more like the proper follow-up to 'Dreamboat Annie.' The band's inimitable combination of rock and folk—which was already sharply defined on their debut—feels even more in focus. "Barracuda" is the monstrous song here, but the rowdy "Kick It Out," blues-grooved title track and the mandolin-driven, misty folk tune "Dream of the Archer" are also standouts.</p>
