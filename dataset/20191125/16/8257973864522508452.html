      <p>Nov. 25 (UPI) -- Russia and Nepal have agreed to sign a defense cooperation deal and are also looking to expand their ties in aviation and energy, Russian Foreign Minister <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Sergey_Lavrov/?tps=1">Sergey Lavrov</a> said Monday.</p>
      <p>Lavrov <a href="https://tass.com/economy/1092451">told reporters</a> following a meeting with Nepalese Foreign Minister Pradeep Kumar Gyawali in Moscow the new agreement covered military and technological cooperation.</p>
      <p>Specifically, the two sides said they were pleased with an earlier deal in which Russia delivered Mi-17 helicopters for use in Nepal's high-altitude, mountainous areas and were looking to expand that aviation relationship.</p>
      <p>Lavrov and Gyawali also discussed <a href="https://www.urdupoint.com/en/world/russia-nepal-to-sign-defense-cooperation-dea-770602.html">expanding bilateral trade</a> in traditional goods as well as a new level of energy cooperation.</p>
      <p>"[There are] prospects of joint development of hydro-energy resources of Nepal," the Russian foreign minister said.</p>
