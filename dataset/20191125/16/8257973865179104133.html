      <p>Nov. 25 (UPI) -- <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Victoria_Beckham/?tps=1">Victoria Beckham</a> says her son <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/romeo-beckham/?tps=1">Romeo Beckham</a> used her to gain more followers on the social media app TikTok.</p>
      <p>The 45-year-old fashion designer and former Spice Girls singer discussed Romeo Beckham, her 17-year-old son with husband <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/David_Beckham/?tps=1">David Beckham</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fKSLB84z58">during Monday's episode</a> of <i>The <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Ellen_DeGeneres/?tps=1">Ellen DeGeneres</a> Show</i>.</p>
      <p>Beckham recently appeared in a <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@romeob7/video/6760277887510646021">video</a> with Romeo Beckham that shows them dancing to the Spice Girls song "Spice Up Your Life." She said her son had just joined TikTok and wanted to boost his followers.</p>
      <p>"He came home the other day and said, 'Mom, I've just joined TikTok. Will you do a dance with me?'" I was like, 'Yeah, what should we dance to?' He was like, 'The Spice Girls,'" Beckham recalled.</p>
      <p>"He took my phone, he posted it on my Instagram, and he said, 'That'll get my numbers up,'" she said. "He used me."</p>
      <p>Beckham jokingly commented on Romeo Beckham's dance moves.</p>
      <p>"It was a lot of fun but I have to say, I think Romeo definitely takes after his dad with his moves," she said.</p>
      <p>Romeo Beckham presently has over 143,000 followers on TikTok.</p>
      <p>Beckham came to fame with the Spice Girls in the 1990s. She told host Ellen DeGeneres she doesn't regret skipping <a href="https://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/2019/01/25/Victoria-Beckham-plans-to-see-Spice-Girls-reunion-with-her-kids/9091548428546/">the girl group's reunion</a> this year.</p>
      <p>"I had so much fun, and I'm still close with the girls. I was so proud of them and everything they did, it was a huge success," the star said. "But, you know, for me, I loved it when I did it. But I feel like a very different person now."</p>
      <p>"I'll always be a Spice Girl. I'll always be Posh Spice. Always," she added.</p>
      <p>In addition to Romeo, Beckham and David Beckham have three other children, Brooklyn, 20, Cruz, 14, and Harper, 8. Beckham said on <i><a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Jimmy_Kimmel/?tps=1">Jimmy Kimmel</a> Live!</i> last week that <a href="https://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/2019/11/20/Victoria-Beckham-says-raising-four-kids-requires-crowd-control/9381574260277/">raising four kids requires</a> "crowd control."</p>
