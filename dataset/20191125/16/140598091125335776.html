      <h1>6 of the best boozy creams for Christmas pudding, spiked with brandy, espresso martini and pink gin</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T16:47:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 16:47</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/madeleine-howell/" target="_blank">Madeleine Howell</a></address>
      <p>Now that you can carefully select this year’s C<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/food-and-drink/recipes/traditional-christmas-pudding-recipe-perfect-family/">hristmas pudding</a> and stockpile the mince pies, it’s time to put brandy sauce on the shopping list.</p>
      <p>While we’re fans of butter for smearing and slathering, nothing compares to a generous dollop of intoxicatingly festive cream to ensure good cheer.</p>
      <p>As for identifying what’s in the pot, brandy is a distilled spirit, made from any fermented fruit juice (such as grape or apple), from anywhere in the world.</p>
      <p>Cognac is a brandy, known for its nutty, fruity taste, with hints of caramel, honey and vanilla – but it must be made in the Cognac region of France.  So, while all cognac is brandy, very little brandy is cognac.</p>
      <p>But in 2019, it’s not just traditional brandy or cognac sauce (also commonly made with rum) on offer: these days, as well as the classic boozy cream, there are also a number of more unusual alcoholic twists available – from salted caramel to espresso martini-flavoured options. Here are our favourites, tried and tasted…</p>
      <h3>M&amp;S Extra Thick Salted Caramel Cream</h3>
      <p>£3.50 for 200g</p>

      </figure>
      <p>With Luxardo caramel spirit (five per cent) and a splash of vodka, this is a creamy treat with caramel sauce, molasses and condensed milk that has a salted, buttery taste; but it may dominate when paired with some desserts.</p>

      <h3>Asda Extra Special Pink Gin Cream</h3>
      <p>£2 for 250ml</p>

      </figure>
      <p>A good gimmick, with seven per cent fruity pink gin and a mulled wine compote with strawberries, raspberries and redcurrant. Lightly spiced with cardamom and star anise, it’s difficult to discern a juniper gin taste, but it’s surprisingly pleasant on a mince pie.</p>
      <p>

      <h3>Tesco Finest Brandy Extra Thick Cream</h3>
      <p>£2 for 250ml</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Made with double cream, rich Jersey cream and a hefty amount of Courvoisier VS Cognac (seven per cent); this is a simple but well done, frothily textured take on the Christmas staple – perfect for blobbing on top of puddings and sweet treats.</p>
      <p>

      <h3>Potts’ Brandy Sauce</h3>
      <p>£3 for 275ml, Ocado</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>Strong stuff, at nine per cent brandy. A thin, rather than a thick consistency, perfect for splashing generously, hot from the hob. It’s rich in vanilla flavours and is delicious with chocolate ice cream or poached peaches. A gluggable version of the classic.</p>
      <p>

      <h3>Waitrose &amp; Partners Clementine Extra Thick Cream</h3>
      <p>£2.75 for 250ml</p>

      </figure>
      <p>With seven per cent Cointreau liqueur and real clementines, this is a silky-textured, tartly sweet citrus cream with a hint of bitterness, which pairs well with trifles, ginger cake and strawberries, as well as Christmas pudding.</p>
      <p>
        <b>8/10</b>
      </p>
      <h3>Sainsbury’s TTD Extra Thick Espresso Martini Cream</h3>
      <p>£2.75 for 250ml</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Extra thick double and Jersey cream with Luxardo Espresso liqueur (four per cent) and vodka (three per cent): very sweet, but well balanced with a bitter coffee taste. Delicious with vanilla ice cream.</p>
