      <p>Justice Muslim S. Hassan of the Federal High Court sitting in Ikoyi, Lagos, adjourned the arraignment of Ismaila Mustapha ( a.k.a Mompha) associates, Kolade Phillip and Hamza Koudeih to November 28, 2019.</p>
      <p>When the matter was called today, the 2nd defendant’s counsel, Abdulhamid Mohammed told the court that he was only informed of the arraignment earlier in the day and doesn’t have a copy of the charge. He pleaded with the court for a short adjournment to enable him study the charge and prepare his client before the plea is taken.</p>
      <p>“I am not adequately prepared for the plea to be taken in respect of the 2nd defendant and I humbly urge the court to adjourn this matter to the earliest possible date”.</p>
      <p>The prosecution counsel, Rotimi Oyedepo opposed the application, arguing that the plea relevant to the jurisdiction of the court was not that of the counsel.</p>

      <p>Rotimi relying on S271(2&amp;3) of the Administration of the Criminal Justice Act, stated that the defendant had been served with the charge and he knows what to do with it.</p>
      <p>He, therefore, urged the court to discountenance the prayers of the defence and allow his plea to be taken.</p>
      <p>Justice Hassan, however, adjourned the matter until Thursday, November 28 for arraignment.</p>
      <p>Phillip and Hamza, both accomplice of Ismaila Mustapha (aka Mompha) will be tried docked on a 24- count charge bordering on conspiracy and money laundering.</p>
