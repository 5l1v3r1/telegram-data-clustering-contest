      <p>A woman who claims <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/prince-andrew-duke-of-york/">Prince Andrew</a> groped her breast at Jeffrey Epstein’s home has been pictured for the first time in 10 years.</p>
      <p>Johanna Sjoberg, 39, alleged that the Duke of York touched her chest at the convicted paedophile’s mansion in New York when she was 21.</p>
      <p>She is one of only two women who have claimed to have sexual contact with the prince.</p>
      <p>It is believed she is now willing to testify under oath against the duke.</p>
      <p>A source told <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/woman-groped-prince-andrew-epsteins-20952944">The Mirror</a> that her testimony over ‘how she was recruited and abused’ by Epstein is ‘vital’ to the agents working on the case.</p>

      <p>They continued: ‘They are ­determined all those who enabled [Epstein’s] crimes will face justice. It is a promise they made to the victims.</p>

      <p>‘Andrew has had serious allegations made against him and agents are determined that a person’s standing in life does not make them immune from being ­questioned.’</p>
      <p>Ms Sjoberg’s allegations were part of a defamation case brought by Virginia Giuffre against Ghislaine Maxwell.</p>
      <p>It was claimed that Epstein had flown both Ms Sjoberg and Ms Giuffre, then Roberts, to Manhattan to help entertain Andrew in 2001.</p>
      <p>The girls claimed they presented the prince with a Spitting Image puppet of himself, with Ms Maxwell then putting the dummy’s hand on Ms Giuffre’s breast.</p>

      <p>Ms Sjoberg alleges that Andrew then touched her breast while she was sat on his knee.</p>
      <p>When asked for comment, Ms Sjoberg stated that her lawyer is currently handling her case.</p>
      <p>The Duke of York is now <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/25/prince-andrew-step-back-patronages-car-crash-interview-11213216/">standing back from all of the organisations of which he is a patron</a>, following a fierce backlash from his Newsnight interview.</p>
      <p>Andrew faced criticism for showing a lack of empathy towards Epstein’s victims, at one point describing his former friend’s actions as ‘unbecoming’.</p>
      <p>He has also been stripped of his £249,000 Sovereign Grant ‘salary’ and all duties after the disastrous interview.</p>
