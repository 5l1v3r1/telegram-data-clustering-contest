      <p>Over the past six decades, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/TinaTurner">Tina Turner</a> has inspired fans across the world with her impressive vocal talent, her unparalleled stage presence and her strong work ethic.</p>
      <p>From singing with her former abusive partner <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/ike-turner">Ike Turner</a> to forging a chart-topping career on her own, Turner has stood the test of time.</p>
      <p>To celebrate Turner’s 80th birthday on 26 November, we have taken a look at back at some of her most inspiring pearls of wisdom.</p>

      <p>Earlier this year, Turner <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/tina-turner-ike-forgive-violent-abuse-interview-relationship-a9098546.html">spoke out</a> about her relationship with her former husband Ike, saying that she doesn’t think she can ever forgive him “for all he ever did” to her.</p>
      <p>Throughout their relationship, the “What’s Love Got To Do With It” singer was subjected to violent abuse at the hands of the late musician, who died in 2007 at the age of 76.</p>
      <p>“I don’t necessarily want to be a ‘strong’ person. I had a terrible life. I just kept going. You just keep going, and you hope that something will come… This [life now] came,” Turner told <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/09/theater/tina-turner-musical.html"><i>The New York Times</i></a>.</p>
