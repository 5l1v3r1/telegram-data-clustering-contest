      <p>Great Britain’s Sam Ward has vowed to do everything he can to resume his hockey career despite losing most of the sight in his left eye.</p>
      <p>Ward was struck in the face by a ball during an Olympic qualifying match against Malaysia on November 3 and underwent surgery 10 days later to reconstruct his cheek.</p>
      <p>“Over the last week I have received advice from three separate eye consultants,” Ward said in a Great Britain Hockey statement.</p>

      <p>“They have all told me that I have suffered damage to the retina of my left eye and that this damage is partly irreversible.</p>
      <p>“I may get some sight back, but this won’t be a quick process, and whether it will be sufficient for me to get back to playing international hockey only time will tell.</p>
      <p>“It is a tough pill to swallow but, as people know, I am not one to give up easily and I will do everything I can to make myself available for selection for Tokyo.”</p>
