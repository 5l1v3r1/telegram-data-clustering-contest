      <h1>Welcome the start of the festive season with Barnstaple's Christmas lights switch-on</h1>
      <h2>The highly anticipated event will take place in the heart of the town centre on November 28</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T16:03:58+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 16:03</time> by <a rel="author">Leena Sidat</a></address>
      <p>There's a packed programme of events planned in Barnstaple in the run-up to Christmas, kicking off with an evening of free, festive, family fun on Thursday, November 28, 2019.</p>
      <p>This year, the ever-popular Christmas light switch-on event will take place in the heart of the town centre as part of the first late night shopping evening.</p>
      <p>The event will be the perfect opportunity to spend a leisurely evening browsing the town’s many independent shops and well-known retailers. Enjoy some festive entertainment before stopping off for a seasonal drink or bite to eat.</p>
      <p>Get your Christmas started by enjoying the magic and sparkle of stalls, rides, a giant snow globe and special festive guests. You could even take part in the brand new Elf Trail – find the mischievous elves that are causing chaos in some of the shops and win some fantastic prizes.</p>
      <p>Queen Anne’s Café is hosting a special Christmas Fayre and Santa himself will be arriving on a traction engine at 3.45pm before heading off to his grotto in Green Lanes. The café will also be showing the Polar Express film with proceeds going to the Children’s Hospice South West - tickets available to purchase from the café.</p>
      <p>At 5pm, the usual magical, festive mix of entertainment and music will start on the stage in the beautiful Pannier Market until the countdown to the big light switch-on at 6.45pm.</p>
      <p>Before the main lights are illuminated, there will be a chance to support the North Devon Hospice and Children's Hospice South West’s Light up a Life campaign as a special star will be lit up to mark the launch of the appeal.</p>
      <p>Braunton Academy Choir will also be debuting and releasing their Christmas song ‘Decorate the Darkness’ written for them by local musician Jim Jones. The song has been written to increase awareness of mental health in young people and the importance of getting them talking when facing struggles. The single hopes to raise funds for the ‘Ask for Jake’ community group set up following the sudden death of 18 year old, Jake McPhail.</p>
      <p>There will then be a sneak preview of what to expect from this year’s spectacular pantomime, Snow White, as some of the stars are joined on stage by Hopps and Chapple, Seth Conway and the winners of The Voice’s community hero competition to push the plunger and light up the town.</p>
      <p>The full line up for the Pannier Market is as follows:</p>
      <p>- 5pm: Stagecoach Performing Arts</p>
      <p>- 5.30pm: Idol Giants</p>
      <p>- 6pm: Launch of Light up a Life campaign</p>
      <p>- 6.15pm: Braunton Academy Choir</p>
      <p>- 6.45pm: Switch-on with pantomime stars and winner of The Voice’s community hero competition</p>
      <p>The full programme of Christmas activities boasts more events than ever before and features a selection of new activities along with some firm favourites.</p>
      <p>Manager of Barnstaple Town Centre, Hannah Harrington, said, "I'm really excited about the festivities this Christmas which really do offer something for everyone. We decided to change the venue of the switch-on to encourage everyone to come into the town centre and support the businesses that make these events possible."</p>
      <p>Barnstaple Town Centre Management is very grateful to all this year’s sponsors who have made all the events possible: Zero 7, Philip J Milton &amp; Company PLC, Stagecoach SW, Scott Cinemas, Selladoor Venues, Brend Hotels, Wimpy, Roundtable, Councillors, M&amp;E Alarms and Green Lanes.</p>
