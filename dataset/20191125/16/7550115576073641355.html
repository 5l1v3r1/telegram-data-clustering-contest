        <b>Liverpool picked up another weekend win against Palace – now we need one more in midweek, beating Napoli to secure a last-16 spot in Europe. Today’s news starts there.</b>
      </p>
      <h3>Napoli woes ahead of Anfield trip</h3>
      <p>Last year, Napoli were a formidable opponent, seen as a real threat to win the Serie A title and even go deep in the <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/champions-league">Champions League</a>.</p>
      <p>They also came within an <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/alisson/">Alisson</a> save of knocking Liverpool out in the group stage – but instead, we did that to them.</p>
      <p>This time they come to Anfield in a rather more shambolic state, with in-fighting and injuries causing real problems for Carlo Ancelotti.</p>
      <p>At the weekend they were held to a 1-1 draw by out-of-form AC Milan, making it <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/2019/11/napoli-continue-to-stumble-ahead-of-visit-to-liverpool-in-champions-league/">six without a win for the Reds’ Wednesday opponents</a>.</p>
      <p>They’ve named their travelling squad for the match, too – and the Reds can feel somewhat boosted by the news that key forwards Arkadiusz Milik and Lorenzo Insigne are both missing.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the president is <a href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/napoli/story/3997961/sources-napoli-president-de-laurentiis-fines-first-team-25m-for-mutiny">fining </a>every fit squad member 25 per cent of their monthly salary as the bad feelings rumble on.</p>
      <p>Win this game and the Reds are through with a game to spare.</p>
      <h3>Form and fitness: the never-ending fight</h3>

      <p>The Liverpool team which <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/jurgen-klopp/">Jurgen Klopp</a> has built is absolutely brilliant, no question.</p>
      <p>But there will always remain questions over what happens when certain players get injured or lose form – particularly in key areas such as up front or full-back.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/roberto-firmino/">Roberto Firmino</a>‘s form in front of goal had taken a dip recently, but it’s testament to his all-round quality and importance that few had even mentioned it. <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/2019/11/jurgen-klopp-delighted-for-roberto-firmino-after-ending-his-goal-drought/">Klopp certainly didn’t mind, for one</a>.</p>
      <p>And then there are the ankle injuries plaguing Liverpool just now: Andy Robbo has explained <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/2019/11/andy-robertson-on-playing-through-the-pain-barrier-reds-need-to-be-a-bit-clever/">why he was in a position to start</a>, but <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/mohamed-salah/">Mo Salah</a> wasn’t.</p>
      <p>Both players need to managed over the coming weeks, with the extremely busy period coming up.</p>

      <h3>Klopp picks Virgil as Reds’ finest player</h3>

      <p>Liverpool have seven players in the running for the 2019 Ballon d’Or, but our manager has made it clear who he feels deserves it.</p>
      <p>Common opinion in the footballing world suggests that <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/sadio-mane/">Sadio Mane</a> and Leo Messi are in the running – as well as Klopp’s pick, <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/virgil-van-dijk/">Virgil van Dijk</a>.</p>
      <p>Klopp <a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11669/11869654/virgil-van-dijk-jurgen-klopp-says-liverpool-defender-should-win-2019-ballon-dor">feels</a> that Virgil edged out the Barca legend, rather like the Reds edged out his team in the semis last season.</p>
      <blockquote>“If you give the Ballon d’Or to the best player of this generation then you should give it always to Lionel Messi. That’s how it is.<br/><br/>“But if you give it to the best player of last season, then it was <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/virgil-van-dijk/">Virgil van Dijk</a>.<br/><br/>“I don’t know exactly how it will work but that is how I see it. The best player of all? That’s Lionel. Best player of last season? That’s Virgil. We will see.”</blockquote>

      <p>Italian football continues to show its moronic side, lagging well behind much of the rest of Europe with their tolerance of racism.</p>
