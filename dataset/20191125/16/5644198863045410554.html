      <p>LAGUNA: It was labelled as a match between close friends by Singapore captain Charmaine Soh, but there was nothing close about the scoreline as Singapore beat host Philippines 80-28 in their opening game at the 30th SEA Games on Monday (25 Nov).</p>
      <p>At the Laguna sports complex in Santa Rosa, the Singaporeans, who last won gold in 2015, raced to a 21-6 lead in the opening quarter. </p>

      <p>The Philippines' team was urged on by an enthusiastic crowd, many of whom were armed with colourful pom-poms, but the Singapore side kept the cheers to a minimum as they stretched their lead to 43-15 in the second quarter.</p>

      <p>Exceptional defence from Natalie Milicich’s side meant they kept the home team to just five points in the third, before closing out the game.</p>
      <p>Speaking to CNA after the game, Soh said that players from both the Philippines and Singapore team are "like long-time friends".</p>
      <p>“The Philippines team and us have a very close friendship, so playing them on court felt like a game between close friends,” said Soh. </p>
      <p>“Even in the hotel, we say hi and hug each other like long-time friends.”</p>
      <p>During the game, for instance, players from both sides could be seen speaking with one another, with Soh occasionally applauding the efforts of the Filipinos.</p>
      <p>“The players were saying that they improved quite a bit,” she added. </p>
      <p>“We played well, we had quite a jittery start but we managed to carry out the game plan after. I felt that the whole team got on court - the young ones, the old ones, we try to work out combis (combinations) and setups so the team did pretty well."</p>

      <p>Following reports that insufficient food had been an issue for the team at their hotel, Soh said that it was settled “almost immediately”.</p>
      <p>She said: “The hotel and accommodation are good, everything is fine. </p>
      <p>“Normally we eat a bit more, just that the portion wasn’t a lot. So we coped with the issue by ordering (food) in so that wasn’t an issue at all. We manage to settle the issue almost immediately.”</p>
      <p>The team has taken it in their stride, added Soh.</p>
      <p>“We should expect the unexpected. This is just one of those unexpected events we have to cope with and this is really a small issue for us,” she said. </p>
      <p>At the last edition of the Games, Singapore beat Philippines 91-22, but missed out on gold after losing to host and Causeway rivals Malaysia 65-41 in the finals. </p>
      <p>Singapore will face Brunei next on Wednesday.</p>
