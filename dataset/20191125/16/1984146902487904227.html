        <figcaption>General Election 2019: Opinion polls over the last seven days</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>There's almost three weeks to go until the general election, but so far the opinion polls have shown the Conservatives firmly in the lead.</p>
      <p>What will happen if the polls are right? It's possible to make a guess about which seats would change hands in the North East, and they show a number of gains for the Conservatives.</p>
      <p>Of course, this is at best just a rough guide to what could happen. The polls may be wrong, or opinions might change before the election takes place.</p>
      <p>It's also important to remember that the prediction assumes that there is a uniform "swing" across the country. This refers to voters switching between the different parties. In practice, it may be that people behave differently in some constituencies to others.</p>
      <h3>What do the polls say?</h3>
      <p>The most recent "poll of polls" from the <a href="https://britainelects.newstatesman.com/">Britain Elects</a> website, which brings together results from all the recent polls, says this is how people plan to vote:</p>
      <p>Conservatives 42.4%</p>
      <p>Labour 29.6%</p>
      <p>Liberal Democrats 14.7%</p>
      <p>Brexit Party: 4.6%</p>
      <p>Green Party: 3.3%</p>
      <h3>What would this mean for the North East?</h3>
      <p>The prediction tool on website <a href="https://www.electoralcalculus.co.uk/">Electoral Calculus</a> suggests that this could mean the Tories gain a number of seats from Labour, including:</p>
      <p>Bishop Auckland</p>
      <p>Darlington</p>
      <p>Stockton South</p>
      <p>Conservatives would also come very close to winning Sedgefield, the constituency once represented by former Labour leader Tony Blair, but based on these results they wouldn't quite take it.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>And there would be more good news for the Tories, as they would hold on to the marginal seat of Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland, and hold on to Berwick-upon-Tweed, which they won from the Liberal Democrats in 2015.</p>
      <h3>What would it mean nationally?</h3>
      <p>Nationwide the Conservatives would win 362 seats, giving them a majority of 74</p>
      <h3>Is this good news for the Conservatives?</h3>
      <p>It's worth pointing out, once again, that the polls can be wrong - and even if they are right, then things might change before the December 12 election.</p>
      <p>Labour supporters might not welcome predictions of a Conservative majority. But strange as it may sound, a lot of Conservatives won't welcome it either. That's because they believe, rightly or wrongly, that one of the best ways of winning support in this election is to convince voters that Jeremy Corbyn will become Prime Minister unless people vote Conservative. Tories think - and they might be wrong - that there are voters who wouldn't normally support them, but might do so in this election in order to stop Mr Corbyn gaining power.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>So any suggestion that the Tories have the election in the bag might actually hurt their chances, because it could lead voters to think they can safely vote for a different party.</p>
      <h3>How does this election compare to 2017?</h3>
      <p>The "poll of polls" puts the Conservative share of the vote on 42.4%. It may come as a surprise, but that's exactly what the Conservatives actually got in the 2017 election.</p>
      <p>Of course, in 2017 the result was a hung Parliament. But what's different - according to the polls - is that Labour is set to do much worse this time than in 2017.</p>
      <p>So, if the polls are right, the Conservatives could actually win a reasonable majority in Parliament even though their share of the vote is no better than it was in 2017. It would mean Boris Johnson was seen as a great success - despite doing no better than Theresa May the election two years ago.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Perhaps it's worth noting that the Conservatives led by Theresa May actually got far more votes in 2017 than they got when the party was led by David Cameron in the 2010 election and the 2015 election.</p>
      <p>However, Mr Cameron appeared to be very successful in elections while Mrs May appeared to be a failure. The difference is that Labour won far more votes in 2017 than in the past, which meant the gap between the two parties was very narrow.</p>
      <p>If Boris Johnson matches Theresa May's share of the vote in 2017 - but Labour's share goes down - the Tories could appear to have won a major victory, despite doing no better than last time.</p>
