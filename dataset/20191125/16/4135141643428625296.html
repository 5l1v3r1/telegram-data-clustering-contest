      <p>The Minnesota Twins are reviving their classic baby blue uniforms for the 2020 season.</p>
      <p>The new alternate uniforms, which can be worn at home and on the road, are based on the road uniforms the Twins wore from 1973-86 and will be paired with a navy blue cap.</p>
      <p>All of the Twins’ 2020 jerseys will sport a patch on the right sleeve commemorating the club’s 60th season.</p>
      <p>“No uniform in the history of Minnesota Twins baseball drives more fan engagement than the old-school baby blues,” Twins president and CEO Dave St. Peter said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The alternate uniforms will also feature baby blue pants.</p>
