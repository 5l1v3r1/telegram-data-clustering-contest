      <p>National Grid has reached an agreement with New York state to end its supply moratorium for customers in Brooklyn, Queens and Long Island, a day before governor Andrew Cuomo’s deadline to do so.</p>
      <p>The company will also make $7m (£5.4m) available to assist customers affected by the moratorium, as well as committing $28m more for investment in demand response and clean energy projects.</p>

      <p>On 12 November the governor sent National Grid a letter threatening to revoke the firm’s operating license if it had not resolved issues with gas supply within two weeks.</p>
      <p>Cuomo said that the energy supplier had failed to provide <a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-issues-letter-notifying-national-grid-intent-revoke-its-certificate-operate">“adequate and reliable service.”</a></p>
      <p>In a statement, National Grid said it would proceed to connect those customer applications put on hold due to the moratorium and start processing all new applications.</p>
      <p>The agreement, which will last for two years, also commits National Grid to present options to meet New York’s long-term gas supply needs within three months.</p>
      <p>Following a consultation process final options will be agreed with the state of New York by June 2020.</p>
      <p>The agreement confirms that the matter of the revoking of the company’s license has now been resolved.</p>
      <p>Governor Cuomo tweeted that “this agreement is a victory for customers.”</p>
      <p>Yesterday National Grid confirmed that it had moved ownership of the company offshore to new holding companies in Luxembourg and Hong Kong as a precaution against Labour’s sweeping nationalisation plans.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for the company said:</p>
      <p>“Labour’s proposals for state ownership of National Grid would be highly detrimental to millions of ordinary people who either hold shares in the company or through their pension funds – which include several local authority pension funds.</p>

      <p>“To protect their holdings, and in line with our legal fiduciary duty to our shareholders, we have established holding companies in Luxembourg and Hong Kong. </p>
      <p>“This has no financial benefit to the company and does not affect its day to day operations. It is solely to protect our shareholders’ interests.”</p>
      <p>Shares in National Grid rose nearly 1.5 per cent today.</p>
