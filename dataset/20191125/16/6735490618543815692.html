      <p>Thanks to Ryan Reynolds, the aftermath of Blake Lively’s “The Rhythm Section” on-set injury was caught on tape.</p>
      <p>The “Gossip Girl” alum shared a hilarious video – taken by her loving husband – from her hospital bed, after hurting her arm on set of the upcoming film.</p>
      <p>“Literally four weeks after I said, ‘I’d give my right hand to be in this movie!’ (Good thing no one told me to ‘break a leg’).” she captioned the video. “My husband somehow knew ‘Wild Thing’ would be my version of smelling salts. I’ve never felt so seen. Or high. Also… I have zero recollection of this.”</p>

      <p>The upcoming drama will be released in 2020, but the majority of the film, except for the short break while Lively healed, was filmed in 2017.</p>
      <p>Lively recently wiped her Instagram clean to get ready to promote “The Rhythm Section”, leaving just a clip of its trailer.</p>
      <p>“The Rhythm Section” hits big screens in January.</p>
