      </p>
      <p>Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder of the brain that is characterised pathologically by the loss of nigral dopaminergic neurons. Whilst motor features of the disease respond well to current dopaminergic treatments, side effects such as dyskinesia and neuropsychiatric problems are common over time. These problems could, in theory, be avoided through targeted delivery of dopamine to the dorsal striatum as is possible with neuronal replacement approaches or growth factor (GDNF) delivery.<br/><br/>These strategies have been tried over the last 20-30 years and shown long-term clinical benefit in some patients. But efficacy is inconsistent, and these new therapies often have their own side effects.<br/><br/>In this webinar, the University of Cambridge’s Professor Roger Barker will discuss the history, current status and potential of growth factor- and cell-based therapies for PD. <br/><br/>Attend this webinar to hear:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The latest advances in cell-based treatments for PD</li>
        <li>The potential of stem cell therapies for brain repair</li>
      </ul>
