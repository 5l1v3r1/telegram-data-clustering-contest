      <p>New Balance have released a special collection that pays homage to the six European Cups that Liverpool have won in their history, with a stylish black design.</p>
      <p>The collection features a special crest to pay homage to <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> 's continental triumphs in 1977, 1978, 1981, 1984, 2005 and 2019, as well as including a special edition jersey.</p>
      <p>​​The black jersey features gold detail on the front with the special edition crest proudly visible. The jersey has been constructed with NB Dry – technology that helps to remove moisture from the body.</p>
      <p>Kenny McCallum, General Manager at <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/new-balance">New Balance</a> Football, said: “With memories from Madrid still fresh in our minds, we are delighted to introduce the black Six Times Collection. We look forward to seeing Reds fans around the world in the new range.”</p>
      <p>The collection also includes a tracksuit, a football, trainers and other off-field items,  including a baseball cap, woolly hat, snood and bags.</p>
      <p>LFC's six time collection from New Balance continues the trend of stylish products available from the club's kit suppliers - although this year's also serves as a farewell from the American company.</p>
      <p>The club recently won a legal battle against New Balance which allows them to move to a new supplier at the end of the season, with the Reds due to pen a deal with Nike.</p>
