      <h3>HUAWEI WATCH GT</h3>
      <p>The HUAWEI WATCH GT was announced early in 2019 and features a classic style and rich smart watch features. With many fitness and wellness tracking capabilities, the watch will make for a great Black Friday special. One of the most notable features is a long lasting battery life that overcomes one of the more frustrating aspects of most smart watches.</p>
      <p>The HUAWEI WATCH GT uses an innovative dual-engine and smart power-saving architecture that allows it to switch between performance and efficiency modes depending on the user’s activity, maximizing battery life. HUAWEI spent a lot of time on the ceramic bezel design which is combined with a stainless steel shell and DLC (Diamond-like Carbon) coating. The watch is optimized for tracking indoor and outdoor fitness activities including running, exercise, mountain climbing, cycling and open water swimming. Use the HUAWEI TruSeen™ 3.0 heart rate monitoring technology to track your activities and heart rate throughout the day.</p>
      <h3>HUAWEI P30 lite</h3>
      <p>Another one of HUAWEI’s products getting the Black Friday treatment is the HUAWEI P30 lite. This low-cost phone offers high-end photography features including a 48MP AI camera and premium design. Use the AI photography mode to capture professional quality photos manipulating light and motion to get the perfect shot. The phone is available in Midnight Black, Peacock Blue and Pearl White.</p>
      <h3>HUAWEI FreeLace</h3>
      <p>With its intelligent connectivity, outstanding audio and long-lasting battery life, HUAWEI FreeLace offers an unmatched audio experience. Together with HUAWEI HiPair, HUAWEI FreeLace can easily be paired with and fast charged by Huawei smartphones by simply plugging into the device. It is available in Graphite Black, Amber Sunrise, Emerald Green and Moonlight Silver.</p>
