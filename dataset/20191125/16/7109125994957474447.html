      <p>Agriculture Minister Mahmoud Hojjati, who was to be impeached on Tuesday, has quit his post, so the parliamentary hearing on his performance has been cancelled, a lawmaker announced on Monday. <br/>“According to a letter by Vice President for Parliamentary Affairs Hosseinali Amiri to Majlis Speaker Ali Larijani, Hojjati’s resignation has been accepted [by President Hassan Rouhani],” Asadollah Abbasi, a member of the Majlis Presiding Board, told IRNA.<br/>“Due to this reason, the agriculture minister’s impeachment session has been called off,” he explained.     <br/>Lawmakers planned to hold a session on Tuesday to impeach Hojjati for his "poor" track record and failure to address major problems facing the sector. <br/>The motion calling for the impeachment of the agriculture minister carried 38 signatures. <br/>Hojjati had survived a vote of no-confidence in parliament in 2018. <br/>The motion cited a number of reasons to impeach the minister, including issues related to dismissals and appointments at the ministry, exports and imports, and failure to protect natural resources. </p>
