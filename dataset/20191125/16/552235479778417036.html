      <h2>Councillor calls for walkway to be installed at huge development sooner rather than later</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T16:36:24+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 16:36</time> by <a rel="author">Sarah Hilley, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/sarah-hilley/</a></address>
      <p>A huge housing estate with more than 500 people living there still has no direct footpath to a school and shops. </p>
      <p>Residents in the Earl’s Green and Princess Gate development in Troon have complained to a councillor about the problem.</p>
      <p>Someone even made a dodgy makeshift walkway with a pallet across a burn to make getting about easier. </p>
      <p>Councillor Craig Mackay called for pedestrian links to be installed as soon as possible at a council meeting.  But the South Ayrshire Council Regulatory Panel heard it wasn’t possible until a later date because of health and safety.</p>
      <p>Councillor Mackay said: “It is letting residents down. They have raised it with me time and time again. There is no great cost to putting this path in. My argument is let’s get it done.”</p>
      <p>The SNP councillor  said householders must embark on a mile-long walk through  Kilmarnock Road to reach the primary and GP. </p>
      <p>The development came before councillors again this month so the Troon politician seized the opportunity to raise the lack of footpath. </p>
      <p>Lynch Homes lodged an application to approve planning permission condition matters relating to the the North East Troon development at the council’s regulatory panel. <br/>Councillors approved the bid, which covers the building of another 115 homes and a shop. </p>
      <p>Councillor Mackay put forward an amendment looking for the installation of pedestrian access to the shops  to be accelerated. <br/>He failed to get majority support and his effort was rejected after councillors were told it was not appropriate to create a path currently as the site is still under construction.</p>
      <p>Builders will lay it in the future, however.</p>

      <p>Councillor Mackay said: "The original masterplan for the 720-house Earl's Green / Princess Gate development was approved in 2012 and in my view made too many concessions to the developers. This includes the phasing of vital footpath links to allow residents easy access to the shops and GP practice on Deveron Road and onward to the schools and town centre. While these are conditioned to happen eventually, we now have well over 500 people living in the new development who have to take a lengthy detour by Kilmarnock Road.”</p>
      <p>Blasting the lack of support for his amendment, he said the “application was rare opportunity to bring forward the construction of one of the footpath links, which would be of particular benefit to the affordable housing shortly to be built at that location.”</p>
      <p>He said he felt “surprised and disappointed to lose the vote.”</p>
      <p>Stewart Milne and Taylor Wimpey are some of the firms involved in the major developments at Earl's Green and Princess Gate.</p>
