      <p>"Former foreign policy advisor to President Trump and author George Papadopoulos is now running to put California's 25th Congressional District seat back in Republican hands," his official campaign site reads. "Help fight back against Democrat corruption by joining George's campaign today!"</p>
      <p>The former Trump aide made the announcement on "Fox &amp; Friends" Monday morning.</p>
      <p>“I have been living here for over a year and a half, and people every single day, when I go and talk around the districts, the state, the country, they tell me we need a candidate to represent the community that has an American First agenda at heart,” Papadopoulos <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/news/papadopoulos-confirms-run-for-rep-katie-hills-former-california-congressional-seat/">said</a>. “I’m running for the 25th Congressional District. I’m here to promote the America First agenda and to enact legislation that has real life consequences for the American people and my constituents.”</p>
      <p>Papadopoulos emerged as a major figure in special counsel Robert Mueller's Russian collusion investigation into the Trump campaign. He was sentenced to 14 days in jail for lying to FBI investigators about his contact with Russian agents, which he served in late-November, early December of last year.</p>
      <p>Rep. Hill <a href="https://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2019/10/31/katie-hills-farewell-address-n2555689">resigned</a> from Congress last month after allegations that she had sexual relations with one of her staffers.</p>
      <p>Republican Mike Garcia <a href="https://townhall.com/tipsheet/bethbaumann/2019/11/06/meet-the-republican-vying-for-katie-hills-congressional-seat-n2555808">announced</a> earlier this month that he is also vying for the vacancy.</p>
