      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/lyon/"><b>Lyon</b></a> make the trip to Russia to take on <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/zenit-st-petersburg/"><b>Zenit St Petersburg</b></a> knowing that victory will be enough to earn a spot in the <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/champions-league/"><b>Champions League</b></a> last 16.</h2>

      <p>However, sitting just three points adrift of the French outfit in Group G, Zenit are aware that a win will take them above Wednesday's opponents due to their head-to-head record.</p>

      <p>After recording four points from their opening two fixtures, Zenit appeared to be on course for the knockout stages, but the double-header with RB Leipzig did not work out as planned for <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/sergei-semak/"><b>Sergei Semak</b></a>'s side.</p>
      <p>While a narrow defeat in Germany did not come as a massive surprise, Zenit failed to make home advantage count in the reverse fixture as they succumbed by a 2-0 scoreline.</p>
      <p>That result has left the Russian giants with it all to do heading into the final two matches, although Semak will take some comfort from his team responding with two successive triumphs on the domestic front.</p>
      <p>Narrow wins have been registered at each of Arsenal Tula and Rubin Kazan, successes which have left Zenit sitting five points clear at the summit of the <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/russian-premier-league/2019-20/">top-flight standings</a>.</p>
      <p>As for Lyon, they appear to have finally settled down under <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/rudi-garcia/"><b>Rudi Garcia</b></a>, who has witnessed his new team claim four victories from their last five matches in all competitions.</p>
      <p>Picking up maximum points in Ligue 1 against Metz, Toulouse and Nice have moved Lyon into ninth place in the <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/ligue-1/2019-20/">table</a>, just three points adrift of fourth position.</p>
      <p>The other win came against Benfica in front of their own fans, and prevailing in that European encounter has put the French outfit one more positive result away from reaching the last 16.</p>
      <p>The contributions of <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/memphis-depay/"><b>Memphis Depay</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/moussa-dembele/"><b>Moussa Dembele</b></a> have proven key, with the pair scoring eight times between them over the course of the last five games.</p>

      <p>Depay is regarded as a major doubt for Lyon as he continues his recovery from a thigh injury.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/houssem-aouar/"><b>Houssem Aouar</b></a> will also play no part for the French side, with Garcia potentially naming the same team which began the game against Nice.</p>
      <p>Semak could opt against making any changes to his team after Zenit's hard-fought triumph at Kazan on Saturday.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/aleksey-sutormin/"><b>Aleksey Sutormin</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/aleksandr-erokhin/"><b>Aleksandr Erokhin</b></a> are each pushing for starting roles should Semak tinker with his first XI.</p>
      <p><b>Zenit St Petersburg possible starting lineup:</b> Kerzhakov; Karavaev, Ivanovic, Rakitskiy, Santos; Kuzyaev, Barrios, Ozdoev, Driussi; Azmoun, Dzyuba</p>
      <p><b>Lyon possible starting lineup:</b> Lopes; Dubois, Andersen, Denayer, Marcal; Mendes, Tousart; Traore, Terrier, Reine-Adelaide; Dembele</p>

      <h3>We say: Zenit St Petersburg 2-1 Lyon</h3>
      <p>We are expecting a tense affair in Russia as both teams look for the result which could ultimately make the difference in two weeks time. However, home advantage could play its part here, and Zenit may capitalise to edge a tight contest.</p>
