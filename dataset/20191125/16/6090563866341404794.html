      <p>A man from Mungezi River Range under Chief Marozva in Bikita could not believe his eyes when instead of meeting his lover at their usual rendezvous as planned found the husband and a colleague waiting for him there.<br/>Chief Marozva was told at his traditional court on Saturday last week that Jeremiah Mangondo tried to run away when he saw his lover’s husband but he could not run faster and was caught.<br/>He confessed that indeed he was dating Ticharwa Machafa’s wife. Ironically Machafa and Mangondo were friends.<br/>Chief Marozva was told that the affair started when Machafa went partially blind. It is then that Mangondo started sending messages to Prudence Takaendesa and the two fell in love and started dating.<br/>The court heard that Machafa was blind for three months but regained sight after a prophet healed him. It is then that he was able to read again and he took his wife’s phone and was shocked to find out that his friend and his wife were seeing each other.<br/>He confiscated the phone and while pretending to be Takaendesa sent a message to Mangondo asking that they meet at the usual rendezvous. Mangondo got there first and could not believe his eyes when he saw Machafa and another man Ephraim Mazhawiza approaching.<br/>Adrenalin pumped into his blood and he took to his heels.<br/>Mangondo told the court that it was Machafa’s wife who initiated the affair when her husband went blind. Judgment will be on November 30, 2019.</p>
