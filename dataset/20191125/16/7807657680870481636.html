      <h3>What you need to know</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>A new patent shows a potential heat transfer system for the Surface Neo and Surface Duo.</li>
        <li>The patent shows a vapor chamber extending across the hinge of a device.</li>
        <li>As with all patents revealed, this design might never be used in a device.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A <a href="https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=US276886580&amp;tab=PCTDESCRIPTION">newly revealed patent</a> shows off a potential cooling system for the upcoming Surface Neo and Surface Duo (<a href="https://windowsunited.de/surface-neo-duo-so-koennte-die-kuehlung-der-geraete-funktionieren/">via Windows United</a>). The patent shows heat pipes and vapor chambers extending across the hinge of a device.</p>
      <p>The Surface Neo and Surface Duo appear to be very thin devices, which could increase the importance of well-designed thermal dissipation.</p>
      <p>The patent was published on November 21, 2019, and filed for on May 17, 2018. Its description explains how a vapor chamber could help cool the device by extending through the hinge.</p>
      <blockquote>Examples are disclosed that relate to heat transfer devices comprising a vapor chamber and a flexible hinge. One disclosed example provides an electronic device comprising a first portion and a second portion connected by a hinge region, and a vapor chamber extending from the first portion to the second portion across the hinge region, the vapor chamber comprising a first layer comprising titanium, a second layer comprising titanium joined to the first layer to form the vapor chamber, a working fluid within the vapor chamber, and a third layer comprising titanium positioned between the first layer and the second layer, the third layer comprising one or more features configured to conduct the working fluid via capillary action."</blockquote>
