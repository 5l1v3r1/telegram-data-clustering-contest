      <p>It would be recalled that Efia Odo recently posted on her Twitter page that she missed her monthly period and might be pregnant for Shatta Wale.<br/>She probably posted it just for fun but a lot of blogging site took the hint and broadcasted it on major social media platforms.</p>
      <p>Efia Odo who was obviously unhappy about the post was just waiting for the right time to vent out her displeasure and anger towards the parties involved in the publication.</p>
      <p>Well, as expected, the Kwese TV presenter posted a picture on her Instagram page and captioned it ” Calling God to tell her I’m in the garden of Eden and there’s no apple”.</p>
      <p>The blogging site “Celebritiesbuzzgh” decided to look for trouble for themselves by commenting on it.</p>
      <p>Efia Odo who obviously has been waiting for the opportunity replied in rather harsh manner. She wrote “fuck you and your stupid fake ass stories u dey promote bout me! Now people think I’m pregnant!”</p>
      <p>When it comes to insults and the use of the “F” word, Efia Odo has no contender.</p>
