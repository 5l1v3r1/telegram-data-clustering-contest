      <h1>Ancient lion, crocodile and cat mummies unearthed in Egypt</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T16:55:48+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 16:55</time> by <a rel="author">Hannah Sparks</a></address>
      <p>Archaeologists in Egypt have unearthed a rare mummy menagerie, including the wrapped remains of cats, crocodiles, scarabs, cobras and two lion cubs.</p>
      <p>The discovery was made in the tomb of a 7th century royal priest in Saqqara, south of Cairo, according to Khaled El-Enany, Egypt’s minister of antiquities.</p>
      <p>The collection — 25 small wooden mummy caskets adorned with hieroglyphics, along with 75 more boxes filled with wooden and bronze statues of Egyptian deities — could make-up a “museum by itself,” El-Enany said Saturday.</p>
      <p>The archeologists report that the artifacts date back to the 36th dynasty, considered ancient Egypt’s renaissance era.</p>
      <p>Egypt’s Ministry of Antiquities <a href="https://www.facebook.com/moantiquities/posts/2666207426758224">shared information about the findings</a> on the Facebook over the this weekend. The most extraordinary pieces, according to the ministry’s secretary general Mostafa Waziri, is the five preserved big cats, which CT-scans revealed <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/11/possible-lion-mummy-unearthed-in-egypt/">were lion cubs</a>.</p>
      <p>Researchers pointed out that this would have been considered prized and extremely rare pets during that period, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/427211a?proof=true">pointing to a 2004 discovery</a> of a lion skeleton by French Egyptologist Alain Zivie, who then proved the lion’s high regard in ancient Egypt.</p>
      <p>The “meticulously mummified” animals were found buried alongside dozens of animal statuettes made of sandstone, wood and bronze, such as 75 cats of various shapes and sizes; sculptures of the apis bull deity, a mongoose, ibis, falcon and the god Anubis, formed with the body of a man and head of a jackal.</p>
      <p>The dig also unearthed a “large” stone-carved scarab beetle, a sacred symbol of rebirth in ancient Egypt, plus two more small smaller versions made of wood and sandstone, as well as several other amulets made of wood and clay.</p>

      <p>Deities featured in the cache included 73 bronze figurines of the god Osiris; six wooden statues of god Ptah-Soker, 11 wooden and ceramic statues of the lioness god Sekhmet; and goddess Neith wearing the crown of Lower Egypt.</p>
      <p>The animals remains were found at the Saqqara necropolis near the Giza pyramids, which also <a href="https://nypost.com/2018/12/15/ancient-never-looted-tomb-discovered-in-egypt/">houses the 4,400-year-old</a>, “exceptionally well preserved” tomb of ancient priest Wahtye, according to the Ministry of Antiquities, and the <a href="https://nypost.com/2018/07/15/archaeologists-in-egypt-discover-mummification-workshop/">recently excavated mummification workshop</a> dating as far back as 664 B.C.</p>
