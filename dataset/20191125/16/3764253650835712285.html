      <p>Tottenham Hotspur’s leading goalscorer Harry Kane has spoken for the first time on former manager Pochettino’s sacking as he revealed the club gagged him from revealing intricate details of the developments last week.</p>
      <p>Pochettino was dismissed from his job on Tuesday, November 19, with the club lying in a lowly 14th in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>He was replaced with former Manchester United and Chelsea boss Joe Mourinho hours later, and Kane has now revealed that a number of players actually made the effort to visit him at his home.</p>
      <p>Kane was quoted by The Sun saying Pochettino’s sacking came as a shock to everyone and it was particularly hard for him since the Argentine played an integral part in his development in the last five and a half years.</p>

      <p><i>“It was a shock for everyone, so I wanted to go and see him and we had a chat for a couple of hours and it was nice to do that before the new manager came in,”</i> the England striker said.</p>
      <p>Defensive midfielder Eric Dier also paid Pochettino a visit and revealed that players had to find out about his departure through the club almost like everyone else.</p>
      <p><i>“We found out that night through the club and obviously it was quite emotional,”</i> he said.</p>
      <p>Because the 47-year old did not get the chance to bid his players goodbye, he was forced to write an emotional note on the team’s tactics board as he left the Tottenham Stadium.</p>

      <p>Kane scored the third goal in Spurs’ 3-2 win over Westham in Jose Mourinho’s first game in charge at the London club.</p>
      <p>The 26-year old is however aware of the fact that despite Pochettino’s emotional sacking, the players have to pick themselves up and work for the new manager.</p>
