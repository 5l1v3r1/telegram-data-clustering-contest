      <h3>GRID Season 1 Launches on December 4 with Free Paris Circuit</h3>
      <p>By <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/author/Sean+Carey">Sean Carey</a>, 25 Nov 2019<br/>Comments<br/><a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/GRID/achievements">GRID</a>'s first season the "Hot Hatch Showdown" is coming December 4, and it adds a bunch of new content, including four new hatchbacks, new career events, and a circuit that will have players racing around the streets of Paris.</p>

      <p>Four new cars are being added for Ultimate Edition owners including the MINI Hatch JCW, Lancia Delta HF Integrale Super Hatch, Renault S1600, and the AUDI S1 Quattro Concept. These are all playable in Career, Free Play and multiplayer and can be used in any race scenario. For players who don't own the Ultimate Edition, the Renault S1600 is available in both Free Play and Multiplayer events as a loan car.</p>
      <p>Also coming with Season 1 is a total of 33 Career events to take first position in. Ultimate Edition owners will find two new Career threads in the Career menu — one that features the four new cars and the other using the existing roster of cars. Players will need to complete the race objectives to advance through the threads and reach two new Showdown events. If you win those, you'll be in the final three-race series where there is a new Ravenwest challenge.</p>
      <p>And finally, Codemasters is adding to the list of GRID's circuits with a new Paris circuit free to all players. Now you can race around the Arc de Triomphe and underneath the Eiffel Tower. The new circuit features three different routes, each with a reverse option. According to the Codemasters blog, Paris is "a tight and complex circuit, full of undulation and overtaking opportunities." Players can take on the Paris circuit in both day and night time and in the rain.</p>
      <p>If you're interested, the Ultimate Edition is included in the <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/n39784/xbox-black-friday-sale-2019-xbox-one-and-windows-games-bundles-and-dlc">Xbox Black Friday Sale</a> where it's been discounted by about 30%. If you own the Standard Edition, you can upgrade to Ultimate for $34.99/£29.99/€29.99.</p>
      <p>GRID Season 1 arrives on Xbox One on December 4.</p>

I'm Sean. I have been writing gaming content for various outlets over the past few years while studying a degree in Journalism. I grew up on everything PlayStation — mainly Metal Gear Solid, with a brief foray into the world of Xbox. Nowadays, you'll find me mainly playing multiplayer PC games, but with the recent addition of the Xbox Game Pass for PC, I'm looking forward to improving my TA Score.</p>
