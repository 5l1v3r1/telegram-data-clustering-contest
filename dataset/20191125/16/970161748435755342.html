      <p>Popular streamer PaymoneyWubby has said he would consider moving to Twitch, but only if Microsoft were to pay him a lot of money.</p>
      <p>With popular Twitch personalities such as Ninja, Shroud, and Ewok making high profile moves to Microsoft’s rival Mixer service, many others have begun to consider their position, including PaymoneyWubby.</p>
      <p>He seems to have been at least half joking, but said that he would consider making the switch for $5 million (£3.87m) over a period of five years.</p>
      <p>PaymoneyWubby recently had a falling out with Twitch after being banned for streaming in a public restaurant, despite allegedly having received permission from the owner.</p>

      <p>How much other Twitch stars have been paid has never been made official but estimates for Ninja’s move range anywhere up to $100 million (£77.5m) for his entire multi-year deal. Although more conservative estimates are around $8 million (£6.2m) per year.</p>

      <p>‘Here’s the thing, I want to be your friend,’ said PaymoneyWubby. ‘We can work something out, we can fake it, but just like your mom said you are going to have to pay me to be your friend right now’.</p>
      <p>PaymoneyWubby did also make a serious point in that all of Microsoft’s signings so far have been for gamers and that it doesn’t yet have any high-profile IRL (in real life) or more general interest streamers.</p>
      <p>Whether Microsoft is really interested in that kind of streamer remains to be seen though as the primary purpose of Mixer is to drum up interest in the Xbox format, which isn’t something someone like PaymoneyWubb can necessarily help with.</p>
