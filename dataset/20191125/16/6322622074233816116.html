      <h1>CIDB, RISM join hands to launch National Construction Cost Centre</h1>

      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 25): Construction Industry Development Board Malaysia (CIDB) and Royal Institution of Surveyors Malaysia (RISM) recently launched Building Cost Information Service Malaysia Sdn Bhd (BCISM) which will be the main service provider of CIMB’s National Construction Cost Centre (MyN3C).</p>
      <p>The MyN3C is part of the introduction of the National Construction Industry Information Centre (NCIIC), providing comprehensive construction-related data for industry reference, thus directly impacting activities such as estimation, cost control, cost forecasting and cost-benefit analysis.</p>
      <p>In a statement today, CIDB said the joint venture was among its initiatives to transform the industry into one that is highly productive, sustainable and world-class by 2020.</p>
      <p>“While there are a few organisations that provide construction cost data, the industry still faces the issue of lack of access, as there is no centralised and comprehensive data bank.</p>
      <p>“As such, the MyN3C Portal operated by BCISM will help to provide comprehensive information on construction costs to all industry stakeholders,” CIDB chief executive Datuk Ir. Ahmad Asri Abdul Hamid said.</p>
      <p>He described the BCISM model as similar to the BCIS company in the United Kingdom, or BCIS UK which had been collecting, analysing and interpreting cost information for the past 50 years.<i> — Bernama</i></p>
