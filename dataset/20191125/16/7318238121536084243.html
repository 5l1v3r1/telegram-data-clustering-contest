      <p>In dramatic footage released by the Italian coastguard, a diver plunges into the freezing waves off the coast of Lampedusa, Sicily, and rescues a one-year-old girl.</p>
      <p>Headcam footage shows one of the rescuers swimming over to a group of the stranded migrants, and taking the girl into his arms.</p>
      <p>He then manages to swim over to the lifeboat, keeping the child’s head above the water, before his colleagues haul her aboard.</p>
      <p>The young girl’s mother and father were also rescued.</p>
