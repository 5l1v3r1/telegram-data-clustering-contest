      <p>Manchester City’s all-time goalscorer Sergio Aguero might miss the Manchester Derby slated for December 7, manager Pep Guardiola has confirmed.</p>
      <p>Guardiola confirmed that Aguero picked up an injury in the City’s win against Chelsea on Saturday, November 23, and would be “out for a few weeks”.</p>
      <p>The 31-year old hobbled off the game in t<a href="https://www.legit.ng/1278403-manchester-city-chelsea-blues-armies-suffer-3-1-defeat-defending-champions.html">he 77th minute whilst holding what looked like his groin</a> or upper thigh as City went on to beat the Londoners.</p>

      <p>While addressing media ahead of their Champions League game against Shakhtar Donetsk, Guardiola himself could not pinpoint which muscle his star striker had injured.</p>

      <p>When asked, Guardiola simply said, “<i>Something at the front, I don't know the word in English</i>."</p>
      <p>According to the gaffer, it will take a miracle for Aguero to be fit for the anticipated derby which is only two weeks away.</p>
      <p>The Argentine has scored 13 goals in 16 appearances this season, and his obvious replacement is Brasilian Gabriel Jesus.</p>
      <p>Even before the Manchester derby, Aguero is set to miss crucial Premier League games in between Newcastle United and Burnley.</p>
