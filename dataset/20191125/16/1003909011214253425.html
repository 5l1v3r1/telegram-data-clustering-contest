      <h1>Review: CPO and Mahler Second Symphony</h1>

      <p>There was just one work on the CPO’s Masterworks series last weekend: Gustav Mahler’s Second Symphony (“Resurrection”). But such is the fame of this particular piece that it drew one of the largest audiences of the season, the second night virtually sold out.</p>
      <p>The reason for the fame is easy to understand. The symphony, an extension of the world of Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony, complete with a choral finale, is monumental in scope, its drama gripping, and the concluding movement emotionally shattering. Here the full forces of choir and orchestra combine to express a powerful message of belief in a world after death.</p>
      <p>An expanded CPO was joined by an expanded chorus—expanded not only with more singers but with singers from other local choirs. There were also two vocal soloists. Conductor Rune Bergmann led the combined forces in the much enjoyed performance, the music spaciously presented, weighting the momentum of the performance toward the transcendental ending.</p>
      <p>The performance started especially well, the cello section making the most of its fragmented figures, and the orchestra a blaze of sound at the first climax. In general, this was a somewhat slower than usual performance of the symphony, and with the extra space came more time to dwell upon the sound of the orchestra and Mahler’s remarkable scoring. The many short solos stood in relief, and the variety in the orchestral texture was a particular delight. There was, inevitably, some loss in a sense of forward momentum at times.</p>
      <p>The relaxed second movement came off remarkably well, inspiring some extra applause from the audience. And the St. Anthony and Fishes movement, with its surreal obligato accompaniment, saw some fine playing from the strings and woodwinds.</p>
      <p>Mezzo-soprano Edna Prochnik and soprano Iwona Sobtka were the two vocal soloists, and with their ample, resonant voices were able to be easily heard above the large orchestra. Prochnik got most of the memorable solo music, and she made the most of it, singing with rich expression and a deep emotional involvement. Sobotka soared above the orchestra in her briefer, but still important, role in the final movement.</p>
      <p>But the best came at the end, with excellent solos by the flute, piccolo, and trumpet, just to name a few, in the important passage just before the entrance of the chorus. With the entrance of the hushed chorus, the music gradually rose to its glorious climax, which with the organ made a splendid, unforgettable sound. As on other occasions, it was the clarity and brilliance of the choral sopranos, reaching to the absolute top of their register, that provided the sheen and drama that made the final movement so gripping. Overall, the chorus was impressive both in its soft singing and, especially, in the grandest of grand moment in the choral literature.</p>
      <p>The applause at the end was heartfelt and prolonged, the result of a palpable sense of being part of a major musical experience.  Mahler’s Resurrection Symphony has the ability to inspire a sense of awe, of things beyond one’s normal existence, and this impressive account of the work brought out the best in the performers and conductor.</p>
