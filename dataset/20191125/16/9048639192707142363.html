      <h1>Alleged R. Kelly victim calls singer controlling, abusive monster</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T16:22:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 16:22</time> by <a rel="author">Jericka Duncan / CBS Newspath</a></address>
      <p><b>(CBS NEWS) - </b>R. Kelly's live-in girlfriend, who defended him amid sexual misconduct allegations, is now apparently calling him a "monster" and saying she is also a victim, turned survivor. On the crowdfunding website Patreon, a woman claiming to be Joycelyn Savage describes the singer as "controlling" and "abusive." She also says Kelly got her pregnant twice. Some of what she has to say is disturbing.</p>
      <p>This was Joycelyn Savage in March when Gayle King sat down with her and R. Kelly's other live-in girlfriend, Azriel Clary, to speak about their relationship with the 52-year-old singer.</p>
      <p>"He's our full support, and we're his full support. And all we need is each other," Joycelyn Savage said.</p>
      <p>But now, on the website Patreon, someone claiming to be Savage says Kelly is abusive and forced her to call him, "Master" or "Daddy." According to the post, when she didn't, Kelly grabbed her and choked her until she "blacked out." CBS News has not been able to independently verify it's Savage making the posts.</p>
      <p>Savage, now 24, says she met Kelly when she was 19 years old and pursuing a music career. For years, she publicly defended him including in a July 2017 interview with TMZ.</p>
      <p>"I am in a happy place in my life," she said. "I'm not being brainwashed or anything like that."</p>
      <p>Savage now allegedly claims she was told what to say in that video and in others. She said a member of Kelly's staff starved her for days at a time until she learned her scripted lines word for word. She also claimed, Kelly got her pregnant twice, and she got an abortion both times. She wrote, "It's scary having your first child and aborting them because of some monster that kept me as a prisoner."</p>
      <p>Kelly broadly denied allegations of abusing women in his interview with Gayle.</p>
      <p>"How stupid would it be for me to, with my crazy past and what I've been through, oh, right now, I just think I need to be a monster and hold girls against their will, chain them up in my basement and, and don't let them eat?" he said.</p>
      <p>The new accusations come as Kelly is in jail awaiting trial, facing federal and state sex crime charges, which include child pornography and allegations he recruited underage girls and women to have sex with him.</p>
      <p>Savage's family has begged her for several years to leave Kelly.</p>
      <p>Gerald Griggs is the Savage family attorney and says they are concerned by the apparent new posts.</p>
      <p>"They are ready to do whatever it takes to get her in a safe, comfortable environment which she can reconnect with her family," he said.</p>
      <p>In a statement, R. Kelly's attorney, Steven Greenberg, said it was not until the money ran out that Savage decided anything was wrong.</p>
      <p>Greenberg condemned her for seeking money, he says to exploit her loving relationship with Kelly. Kelly has pleaded not guilty to all charges and is expected to go to trial in the spring.</p>
