      <p>A stray dog found with a ‘horrific injury’ from a sword is finally ready to find a new home.</p>
      <p>Rescuers found Sabby, five, with a wound so deep her bones were visible.</p>
      <p>She needed immediate medical attention after someone with a ‘hatred of stray <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/dogs/">dogs</a>’ is believed to have attacked her.</p>
      <p>Crossbreed Sabby was found in a town in Romania, but was brought to the UK to stay with Norfolk-based charity Safe Rescue for Dogs.</p>
      <p>Two years after her injury, she is at last ready to find a ‘patient and understanding’ family.</p>
      <p>A post on the charity’s Facebook page read: ‘Sabby was found in a town in Romania that is renowned for the poor treatment of street animals.</p>

      <p>‘The injury was open and down to the bone and her recovery took many months.</p>
      <p>‘The pain she must have endured prior to being rescued and given pain relief cannot even be imagined.</p>
      <p>‘The fact that she could emerge from this ordeal with any trust at all in humans is nothing short of miraculous.’</p>

      <p>Although Sabby is still weary of men, the charity said she mixes well with other dogs and loves going out on walks.</p>
      <p>The charity added: ‘She is very weary of men and may always be and who on earth could blame her.</p>
      <p>‘Sabby is now enjoying her walks and starting to enjoy the world around her.</p>
      <p>‘She will always bear the physical and mental scars of the cowardly act that made her hit the headlines but she is still a sweet and loving little girl who can have a bright and happy future.’</p>
