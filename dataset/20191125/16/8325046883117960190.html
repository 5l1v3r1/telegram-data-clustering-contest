      <p>If you ask the people who work in retail, <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/category/black-friday-2017">Black Friday</a> is rarely described in the most flattering of ways.</p>
      <p>“Being retired now, Black Friday is a nightmare of the past,” a former retail worker told Business Insider. “In my many years in retail, each one seemed to get worse.”</p>
      <p>This isn’t to say all Black Friday shoppers are horrible people.</p>
      <p>As one retail worker told Business Insider, “For the most part, people have always been very nice and patient. They can see it’s busy and I’m doing my best to get everybody taken care of.” They said it’s usually the customers who are never satisfied – “we can spot them a mile away” – that are more likely to make a scene.</p>
      <p>In honor of the “wild and hectic” day when everyone is “tired and cranky” – their words – Business Insider asked more than 40 Black Friday workers to share some of the most outrageous things they’ve seen working Black Friday.</p>
      <p>We also scoured Reddit for horror stories told by former Black Friday workers.</p>
