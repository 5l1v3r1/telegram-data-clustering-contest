        <b>‘Tis the season… to get loads of likes on Instagram, and it's all about two-tree households, pineapple, rainbow and cactus trees for 2019. Fiona Cowood speaks to experts and rounds up the rules to abide by</b>

      <p>Decorating the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/christmas/0/when-buy-christmas-tree-real-fake-fir-artificial-spruce-where/">Christmas tree</a> has long been a nostalgic ritual involving the same box of baubles and sorry string of tangled fairy lights. Then Instagram came along and rewrote the rules of hashtag #christmastree. </p>
      <p>In 2019, a Christmas tree that’s shooting for social media success needs personality: a quirky colour scheme, novelty theme or USP that makes it impossible to scroll on by. With almost 20 million images of Christmas trees tagged on Instagram, it’s a saturated field so how can you get your own Norwegian Spruce in on the action?</p>
      <p>Keri Sheehan, founder of Tribe Creative London, dressed this year’s show-stopping tree in the foyer of London’s Peter Jones store and she has led tree-dressing workshops for people keen to achieve what she calls an ‘editorial finish’. She says the trick can be summed up by following her mantra: fillers, thrillers, and spillers.</p>

      <p>Sheehan explains: ‘“Fillers” establish the colour scheme and this can be achieved quite cheaply by buying volume packs of baubles. The “thrillers” are the more expensive items that add some luxury to the tree. And the “spillers” are pieces of floristry, which people are now working into their trees more and more.’</p>
      <p>So if you’re dreaming of a Christmas full of magic, mulled wine and Instagram likes, here’s how to make it happen…</p>
      <h3>1. Don’t let the kids go near it</h3>

      <p>You might go tingly at the sight of your toddler’s dangly handmade robin with the goggly eyes but your virtual audience? Not so much. ‘In the past, people were quite happy to let the kids <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/christmas/0/decorate-christmas-tree/">decorate the tree</a>. It was a nostalgic, emotive thing to do together,’ says Sheehan. ‘But Instagram has changed our behaviour. People don’t want to rob their children of the experience of decorating the tree together but that’s not the one they want to share and show off to everybody. That’s why a lot of families are now becoming two-tree households — one for the kids, and one for Instagram.’ </p>
      <h3>2. Timing is everything</h3>

      <p>Emily Murray, founder of interiors blog <a href="https://www.pinkhouse.co.uk/">The Pink House</a>, has amassed 70,000 followers on Instagram since she started posting there as <a href="https://www.instagram.com/pinkhouseliving/">@pinkhouseliving</a> at Christmas 2015, and she sees her traffic peak around this time of year.</p>
      <p>‘The ‘Christmas Tree Reveal’ is a definite moment for Instagrammers, especially in the interiors realm,' says Murray. ' You’ve got to time it absolutely right, though. Too early and you look like an idiot, too late and you miss that first flurry of posts. I’d say the first showing of <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/christmas/0/best-john-lewis-christmas-adverts-watch-moz-monster-elton-john/">the John Lewis ad</a> is a good guide to stick to.’</p>
      <p>Murray advises posting between 6.30 and 8.30pm, to capitalise on the cosy vibe and catch parents after they’ve put the kids to bed.</p>
      <h3>3. Go non-traditional...</h3>

      <p>The traditional palette of red, gold and green might conjure warm memories of Christmases past but it’s not going to cut it in the sharp-elbowed world of Instagram. ‘Obviously pink is my trademark,’ says Murray, ‘And I don’t allow red in the house so for the past couple of years I’ve gone with pink and green. It’s just a nicer colour combination and I actually think it could take over from red and green; it’s really caught on in the last couple of years.’</p>
      <p>Keri agrees that the more unusual your theme, the more likes you’ll attract on social media. Last year, one of the trees she dressed for John Lewis had an underwater theme and was covered in crabs, jellyfish and octopus. ‘That tree got the most coverage on social media, by far,’ says Sheehan.</p>
      <h3>4. ...Or follow the trend</h3>

      <p>Every year, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/christmas/2019/11/20/upside-trees-christmas-firs-cut-half-introducing-extreme-tree/amp/">a tree trend blows up</a> — last year it was the #blackchristmastree. But an early look at what's trending on Instagram suggests big things ahead for pineapple, rainbow and cactus trees.</p>
      <p>Murray adds that the 'ombre tree' was starting to pick up pace last year, which uses bands of different coloured baubles to create a transitional effect. ‘I also think we’ll see more of the pared-back natural look that chimes with a more<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/christmas/0/how-have-eco-friendly-christmas-top-tips-hosting-green-christmas/"> eco-friendly approach to Christmas</a>. That’s all about bringing things in from outside, using them on your tree, and then putting the whole lot back out again.’</p>
      <h3>5. Shoot the whole tree, not a close-up</h3>

      <p>One of the first pieces of advice Sheehan gives to the people attending her tree-dressing workshops is to pick a theme that will be in keeping with the decor of the room. This is something that’s worked for Murray, too. She says the images that work best in terms of 'likes' are those that show the tree in situ. ‘Close-ups of specific decorations don’t do that well,’ says the PinkHouseLiving founder, ‘People want to see the whole room, and how it all comes together.’ </p>
      <h3>6. Choose the right filters</h3>

      <p>Your tree may look wonderfully twinkly and atmospheric from where you’re sitting but it’s hard to convey that in a photograph, so Murray advises taking pictures in natural light. An effective alternative — or cheat’s way out — is to use a softly-lit filter or download a gif app and lay something sparkly over the top of the image. </p>
