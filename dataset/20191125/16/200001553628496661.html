      <h1>‘Yes’ greater than ‘No’ – Club’s chances of signing Tottenham player seen as good</h1>

      <p>When Jan Vertonghen’s current contract with Tottenham expires he’ll be 33 years of age, and it’s quite possible his next contract will be his last.</p>
      <p>A return to Ajax has long been a topic in the Dutch media, and the Spurs defender is asked about it nearly every time he speaks to the Dutch media.</p>
      <p>He’s not the only one quizzed, Daley Blind, who returned to Ajax from Manchester United, was encouraged to comment on the possibility in October, <a href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/ex-teammate-says-spoken-tottenham-player-returning-former-club/">saying</a>: “<i>You naturally think of Suarez, Alderweireld, Vertonghen or Eriksen. I think the Tottenham boys are almost approaching the end of their contract.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“One of those three would certainly be an asset. I have spoken to Jan Vertonghen in the past year about what he thinks about it. It is up to him how he deals with it.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>AD journalist Freek Jansen, who specialises in Ajax, talked about the possibility on the newspaper’s <a href="https://www.ad.nl/nederlands-voetbal/feyenoord-vroeg-om-stuk-over-jeugdopleiding-niet-te-plaatsen~a41ef548/?referrer=https://t.co/ZOpxpue6ak?amp=1">latest podcast</a>. Dutch website <a href="http://www.soccernews.nl/news/636565/ajax-krijgt-groot-nieuws-over-jan-vertonghen">SoccerNews.nl</a> report Jansen said the chances of a ‘Yes’ from the player are greater than a ‘No’, insinuating he has some information from the player’s camp.</p>
      <p>The contract situation means it could be a case of ‘now or never’ for Vertonghen and an Ajax return.</p>
      <p>A lot will depend on how Jose Mourinho uses the player for the rest of the season.</p>
