      <p>Nothing says Christmas like a slab of fudge in the shape of a vagina.</p>
      <p>And the good news is, the Fudgina (yes, Fudgina) now comes in a delicious Christmas pudding flavour. To make it extra festive.</p>
      <p>The novelty fudge suppliers <a href="https://fave.co/37yEXMZ">Fudgeina</a> specialise in the quirky, vajayjay-inspired sweets – and you can send this one directly to your friends this Christmas, to make them feel really special.</p>
      <p>‘Made with luscious dark vegan chocolate and juicy plum flavouring, this one is sure to get Granny going back for seconds,’ reads the website.</p>
      <p>‘Finished with an edible snow glaze and a holly vajazzle, it literally can’t get any more Christmassy!’</p>
      <p>So if you have friends or family who would just love to chow down on a novelty vulva this December, now you know exactly what to put on your shopping list.</p>
      <p>You can even customise your gift by adding a vajazzle set including three vegan icing tubes in black, red and green to personalise your fudge vagina. Or you can add a condom to the delivery ‘to let your friend know what you expect them to do with it…’</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>The festive fanny costs £11.99 with free postage – with a little bit extra if you want to add the vajazzle or condom.</p>
      <p>The company launched in December 2018, and at Easter they launched a <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/03/26/can-send-friends-vagina-made-creme-egg-flavoured-fudge-9023581/">special edition Creme Egg flavour</a>.</p>
      <p>But you can also opt for strawberry, vanilla, or a solid chocolate vagina if you’re not into fudge.</p>
      <p>This truly is a gift for the entire family to enjoy.</p>
