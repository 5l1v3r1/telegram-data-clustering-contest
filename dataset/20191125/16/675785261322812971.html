      <h1>Jose Mourinho makes request to Jorge Mendes after discussing Tottenham's transfer plans</h1>
      <h2>Tottenham boss Jose Mourinho is already eyeing transfer targets - and he's made a request to Jorge Mendes regarding Bruno Fernandes and Ruben Dias</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T16:05:55+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 16:05</time> by <a rel="author">Rich Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/rich-jones/</a></address>
      <p>Jose Mourinho has reportedly asked Jorge Mendes to keep him informed over Portuguese duo Ruben Dias and Bruno Fernandes as he plots January transfer business.</p>
      <p>Mourinho is monitoring potential targets after taking over at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> despite getting his reign off to a winning start at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Portugal internationals Dias and Fernandes have both been linked with Premier League moves - and Mourinho is keen to use his connections to monitor the chances of bringing them to north London.</p>
      <p>Both are represented by super agent Mendes, who also represents Mourinho, and <a href="https://www.90min.com/posts/6504184-exclusive-jose-mourinho-asks-jorge-mendes-to-keep-him-informed-about-ruben-dias-bruno-fernandes?utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_medium=share">90min</a> claim Mendes has been asked to keep him informed on the future plans of both players.</p>

      <p>Fernandes was heavily linked with a move to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> in the summer before a late bid from Spurs was rejected by Sporting Lisbon.</p>
      <p>But he is still being tipped to move to the Premier League having been vocal about his desire to play in England in the past.</p>
      <p>With Christian Eriksen's future still uncertain, Fernandes could fit the bill as Mourinho eyes another creative midfielder.</p>

      <p>Centre-back Dias, 22, has been linked with Manchester United, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> in recent months.</p>
      <p>His current deal, until 2024, includes a release clause worth around £59million, although Benfica have looked to improve his terms to raise the buyout to around £79m.</p>
      <p>With both players in-demand, Mourinho has asked Mendes to provide him with the latest updates so he can decide whether to pull the trigger on a move, or risk waiting until the summer to conduct major transfer business.</p>
      <p>Reports have suggested both players feature on a three-man transfer shortlist handed to Daniel Levy by Mourinho when he took the job, along with Manchester United midfielder Nemanja Matic.</p>
      <p>His business could also be effected by whether he can successfully convince Christian Eriksen, Jan Vertonghen and Toby Alderweireld their futures lie at Tottenham as they resist signing new deals.</p>
