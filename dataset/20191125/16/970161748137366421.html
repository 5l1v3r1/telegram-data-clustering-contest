      <p>A pregnant mother is convinced that the ghost of her late father made an appearance in an ultrasound scan.</p>
      <p>Shantel Carrillo from San Diego says the scan of her unborn daughter mirrors a photo of her dad Charles cradling her older daughter.</p>
      <p>She even produced the photo, with the two images bearing an eerie resemblance.</p>
      <p>Carillo, who lost her dad in 2016, didn’t notice the likeness until she shared the snap on Facebook, and people began commenting.</p>
      <p>She told <a href="https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/local/san-diego-woman-believes-she-can-see-late-father-in-ultrasound-of-her-unborn-daughter/509-0ca2f70e-6502-42a8-a813-1f3f17962a1b">CBS News 8</a>: ‘People were messaging me, saying it looks like someone’s kissing your baby.</p>
