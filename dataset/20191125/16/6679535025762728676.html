      <p>TIRUCHI: Doctors of the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital in the city have performed a gastro-urethroplasty on a 55-year-old man who had been suffering from urethral stricture.</p>
      <p>The narrowing of the urinary path has affected the patient, Mookan’s, natural urination for the past two years. He had a diseased and closed urethra for about 15 centimetres. The total urethral length among males is about 17 to 20 centimetres.</p>
      <p>To create a new urethra, 15 cm of stomach tube was taken with its blood supply and used to reconstruct the urethra. This was a technically demanding and rare surgery, according to Rajesh Rajendran, urologist, who along with a team of doctors, Kannan, Karthikeyan and Rajasekaran, gastroenterologists, and Sivakumar, anaesthetist, performed the surgery</p>
      <p>“Our doctors have successfully performed the surgery. The patient has recovered well and his urination is normal now,” K.Vanitha, Dean, MGMGH, told reporters.</p>
