      <p>It looks like really hard times lie ahead for Rey and her companions in the upcoming <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/star-wars-the-rise-of-skywalker"><b>The Rise of Skywalker</b></a>. A new clip to that effect from the forthcoming final installment in the original <b>Star Wars </b>saga launched today. In it, the Stormtroopers have spotted Rey and her loyal friends, who are trying to lose the galactic shock troops. Much to the protagonists’ surprise, though, it seems that the stormtroopers have been upgraded and they have a new feature. They fly now.</p>
