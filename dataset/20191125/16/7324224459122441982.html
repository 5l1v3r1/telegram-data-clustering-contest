      <p>Jose Mourinho has said there is “no chance” of Tottenham signing Zlatan Ibrahimovic.</p>
      <p>The 38-year-old, currently a free agent following his exit from LA Galaxy in the last few weeks, has been linked with a move to Spurs given his strong connection with Mourinho.</p>
      <p>Mourinho has worked with Ibrahimovic at Inter Milan and Manchester United, but will not be bringing him to the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.</p>
      <p>The Portuguese says it does not make sense when he has Harry Kane at his disposal.</p>
      <p>“You are right about the connection, we have more than a connection,” Mourinho said when asked whether he would be trying to sign the Swede.</p>
      <p>“I would say also passion and understanding, an amazing player and an amazing guy, but I would say no. No chance.</p>
      <p>“We have the best striker in England, we have one of the top two or three strikers in the world, it doesn’t make any sense for a striker of Zlatan’s dimension, obviously in his late 30s, but still a striker that can play in any club in the world.</p>
      <p>“It doesn’t make sense to come to a club where we have Harry Kane.”</p>

      <p>It has been a hectic first week for Mourinho at the Spurs helm following his appointment last week.</p>
      <p>After his unveiling to the media on Thursday, he had his first game 48 hours later at West Ham – which Spurs won 3-2 – and is now preparing for a Champions League clash with Olympiacos on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Given the quick turnaround between Mauricio Pochettino leaving and him getting the job – it was less than 12 hours between the two club statements – Mourinho has not yet contacted Pochettino.</p>
      <p>The pair are good friends and the Portuguese is giving his predecessor some space.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t (speak to him) because I know what he is feeling,” Mourinho said.</p>

      <p>“I have been there and I know that there is a period where the best thing for us sometimes is to process our feelings, to process what happened with us and then in a couple of weeks, two, three weeks then we are open to the world.</p>
      <p>“We are open again to embrace the different period in our lives, so I want to respect that, to give that feeling to him.</p>
      <p>“But I spoke with his son (Maurizio), who is a player in our youth categories, and I think through his boy he can understand my feelings too.</p>
      <p>“And of course I will call him but I want to let him process.</p>

      <p>“I also told the players in contact with him to make him feel completely free to come here any time he wants.</p>
      <p>“I will contact him when I feel that he has had that space.</p>
      <p>“I needed that little bit of space to process things when I left previous clubs. It does not take just five or six days to be open again.</p>
      <p>“You take a little bit of time to process things and understand and to think and rethink.</p>
      <p>“You speak with people and in a couple of weeks he will be fine and I will call him.”</p>

      <p>Part of Mourinho’s remit at Spurs is to do one thing that Pochettino could not do – win silverware.</p>
      <p>He returns to the Champions League, a competition he has won twice, against the Greek side on Tuesday, where a point will see Tottenham reach the knockout stages.</p>
      <p>Even with Mourinho at the helm, the Premier League club will not be among the favourites to lift the trophy in June.</p>
      <p>Still, the Portuguese is not scared of what might be waiting for them in the next round.</p>
      <p>“I love the competition as much as everyone in football,” he said. “It’s something that everybody dreams about, to win it. Not everyone has the privilege to be a Champions League winner which I was happy enough to do twice.</p>

      <p>“Do I want to win it a third time? Of course, I would love it but I know the difficulties of it.</p>
      <p>“But with these boys, I will never be afraid of any Champions League match that comes into our faces.</p>
      <p>“I repeat, we need to qualify, that is the focus. I always say that.</p>
      <p>“We have to qualify, but, as I was saying, give me time to work, give me time to float my ideas with these boys and I will have no problem at all going to any stadium at all to face any big opponent in Europe or in England.</p>
      <p>“We are not going to be afraid of anybody.”</p>
