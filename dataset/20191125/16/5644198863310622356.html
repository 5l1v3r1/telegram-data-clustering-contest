      <p>Archer scored 30 and combined in a stubborn 59-run partnership for the ninth wicket with Sam Curran to delay the hosts' victory.</p>
      <p>"A bit disturbing hearing racial insults today whilst battling to help save my team, the crowd was been amazing this week except for that one guy," the 24-year-old said on Twitter.</p>
      <p>Archer, who was born in Barbados and represented West Indies at Under-19 level, has been fast-tracked into the England side and made an impressive test debut during the Ashes series against Australia.</p>
