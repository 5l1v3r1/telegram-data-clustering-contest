      <h3>What’s the difference between first party and third party PS4 controllers?</h3>
      <p>First party (officially licensed) PlayStation 4 controllers are going to cost you more, but you’ll get something of higher quality with all the extras, like HD rumble, touchpad and more.</p>
      <p>If you’re on a budget, a third party controller can be a decent go-to option. They might lack in build quality, and may not have all the features of a first party controller but they’ll likely do the job just fine.</p>
