      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/donald-trump/">Donald Trump</a> is ‘the chosen one’ who has been sent to Earth by God as part of a ‘divine plan’, a top aide claims.</p>
      <p>The President of the United States’ outgoing Secretary of Energy Rick Perry made the glowing comments on Fox News Sunday.</p>
      <p>Perry began by explaining his belief that God has ‘used imperfect people all through history,’ before naming Biblical examples King David, Saul and Solomon.</p>
      <p>He said he’d given Trump a brief note on those Old Testament kings last month, and added: ‘I shared it with him and said, “Mr. President, I know there are people that say you said you were the chosen one and I said, ‘You were'”.</p>

      <p>‘I said, “If you’re a believing Christian, you understand God’s plan for the people who rule and judge over us on this planet in our government.”</p>
      <p>The clip then cut back to the Fox and Friends studio, with host Ed Henry adding that Perry indeed believed Trump was sent ‘to do great things.’</p>
      <p>He said that Perry had also told him how Barack Obama had previously been sent by God, and that the US gets the right person to lead it at the right time.</p>
      <p>Trump has previously heaped similar praise on himself by retweeting gushing words from conservative commentator Wayne Allyn Root comparing his presidency to ‘the second coming of God.’</p>
      <p>Writing in August, Trump wrote: ‘Thank you to Wayne Allyn Root for the very nice words. “President Trump is the greatest President for Jews and for Israel in the history of the world, not just America, he is the best President for Israel in the history of the world…and the Jewish people in Israel love him like he’s the King of Israel.</p>

      <p>‘They love him like he is the second coming of God…</p>
      <p>‘But American Jews don’t know him or like him.</p>
      <p>‘They don’t even know what they’re doing or saying anymore. It makes no sense!</p>
      <p>‘But that’s OK, if he keeps doing what he’s doing, he’s good for all Jews, Blacks, Gays, everyone.</p>
      <p>‘And importantly, he’s good for everyone in America who wants a job.” Wow!’</p>
