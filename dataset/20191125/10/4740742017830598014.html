      <h1>Former Bristol City and Manchester United man linked with Everton return as pressure on Marco Silva grows</h1>
      <h2>It would be a sensational return to Goodison Park</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T10:59:45+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 10:59</time> by <a rel="author">David Byrom</a></address>
      <p>David Moyes has been linked with a sensational return to Everton.</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-city-fc">Bristol City</a> defender is out of work at the moment having not managed since leaving West Ham United in 2018.</p>
      <p>Yet he has regularly been linked to jobs in that period, most recently being hotly-tipped to take over at former club Preston North End should they lose Alex Neil.</p>
      <p>However, it now looks like he might make a return to another of his former clubs.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/marco-silvas-everton-fate-sealed-20951309">The Mirror</a> report that the Goodison Park hierarchy have held talks with Moyes over the prospect of him replacing Marco Silva at Everton.</p>
      <p>Silva has underachieved as Toffees boss with an underwhelming campaign so far seeing them in 15th in the Premier League, just four points above the relegation zone.</p>
      <p>A 2-0 defeat to Norwich City over the weekend could well have sealed Silva's fate, although a Goodison Park return for Moyes would raise eyebrows, with the Scot having enraged a number of Everton fans following his move to Manchester United in 2013.</p>
      <p>Moyes, who spent two years at <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-city-fc">the Robins</a> and is still held in high regard by many fans at Ashton Gate, would likely return to the Toffees on an initial short-term deal to try to steer the club away from relegation.</p>
      <p>The 56-year-old has previously told Bristol Live that he would fancy taking charge of the Robins one day if <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/exclusive-i-would-never-say-2143318">he was ever offered the job.</a></p>
      <p>He said: ""I would never say no, that's for sure. I was very close to becoming Bristol City manager before Tony Pulis went - I was close to it. I was manager of Preston and I was having quite regular contact with <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-city-fc">Bristol City</a> at the time.</p>
      <p>"And I said okay I would do it but in the end it didn't quite materialise or I would have been manager at that time.</p>
      <p>"But it's something that I would never say never to because it was such a great part of my career and I had a great rapport with the supporters and the people in the city so it was something I really enjoyed."</p>
