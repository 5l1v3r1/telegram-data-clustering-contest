      <h1>Here's how Kim Kardashian says she empathises with Harry and Meghan on a very personal level</h1>

      <p>Cape Town – Kim Kardashian West recently empathised with Harry and Meghan as their legal battle with the press continues.</p>
      <p>The mother of four said she completely understands how the new parents must be feeling when host of <a href="https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/lisa-wilkinson-interviews-kim-kardashian-on-the-sunday-project/news-story/d7a2127638950216c90b4aeb0659b408"><b><i>The Sunday Project</i></b></a>, Lisa Wilkinson said, "I’m trying to work out who is the most famous family in the world. I think it sat as a toss-up between the British royals and the Kardashians. I’m wondering if you feel some sympathy for what Harry and Meghan are going through?"</p>
      <p>"I think everyone has their own journey," Kim replied. "I think their journey is extremely personal, with – you know, what his mother experienced and how her life was so affected by the spotlight and by paparazzi.</p>
      <p>"I don’t think anyone can really understand what that’s like except for them. But I think as I’m older and as I have kids, what I would want for them is just the safest place. I can definitely empathise with their need for having a secure, safe place and taking time for themselves and having privacy when they need it."</p>
      <p>Harry and Meghan welcomed Archie in May of this year, but in a <a href="https://www.channel24.co.za/Gossip/Royal-News/prince-harry-releases-a-heartbreaking-statement-as-the-duchess-of-sussex-sues-the-mail-on-sunday-20191002-2"><b>heartbreaking statement</b></a>, Harry said as they wrapped their tour of Africa, that throughout Meghan’s pregnancy and with every move she’s made as a new mom, the media has criticised her. His Royal Highness called it a "ruthless campaign" and said, "I cannot begin to describe how painful it has been," as he announced the couple would be taking legal action against the press.</p>
      <p>Most heartbreaking of all, he compared the media's treatment of Meghan to that of his mother, the late Princess Diana. "My deepest fear is history repeating itself," he said. "I’ve seen what happens when someone I love is commoditised to the point that they are no longer treated or seen as a real person. I lost my mother and now I watch my wife falling victim to the same powerful forces.</p>
      <p>"We thank you, the public, for your continued support," he said. "It is hugely appreciated. Although it may not seem like it, we really need it."</p>
      <p>Last week, the duchess further revealed the extent of the media’s scrutiny as she addressed the "untrue and offensive" rumours in <a href="https://www.channel24.co.za/Gossip/Royal-News/meghan-markle-addresses-untrue-and-offensive-tabloid-rumours-head-on-in-new-court-documents-20191120"><b>new documents</b></a> filed by the royals' legal team. </p>
