        <b>Northern Irish Lorry driver Maurice Robinson, who is accused over the deaths of 39 migrants found in a trailer at an industrial estate in England, has pleaded guilty to plotting to assist illegal immigration.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 25-year-old, who is known as 'Mo', was allegedly part of a global smuggling ring and was charged with the manslaughter of a group of men, women and children found dead in Essex on October 23rd.</p>
      <p>All of the victims - made up of 31 men and eight women - were later identified as being from Vietnam.</p>
      <p>The youngest two boys were aged 15.</p>
      <p>Robinson, whose Scania cab was attached to the trailer when the bodies were found, appeared at the Old Bailey in London via video link from Belmarsh Prison for a plea hearing.</p>
      <p>Wearing a light blue sweater and tan trousers, he spoke to confirm his identity, nationality and to admit conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration between May 1st last year and October 25th 2019.</p>
      <p>The charge sheet states that he plotted with others to do "an act or series of acts which facilitated the commission of a breach of immigration law by various persons".</p>
      <p>Robinson - of Laurel Drive, Craigavon in Co Armagh - also admitted acquiring criminal property, namely cash, on the same dates but was not asked to enter pleas to other charges.</p>
      <p>Those include the 39 counts of manslaughter and the transferring of criminal property.</p>
      <p>He was remanded in custody until a further hearing on December 13th.</p>
