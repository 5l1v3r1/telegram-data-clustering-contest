      <h3>THE Bureau of Immigration (BI) yesterday announced it is hiring 100 immigration officers (IOs) to man posts at the international airports and seaports nationwide.</h3>
      <p>BI Commissioner Jaime Morente said the hiring is part of the agency’s drive to strengthen border control and improve its services to the traveling public.</p>
      <p>“We see the lack of manpower as one of the primary impediments in delivering a more efficient government service. Through this hiring, we intend to provide faster and smoother processing in our ports,” Morente said.</p>
      <p>He also said the BI is continuously hiring personnel to ensure that the upcoming new international airports are fully manned.</p>
      <p>Morente shared that the incoming officers will undergo rigorous training under the agency’s Center for Training and Research before deployment.</p>
      <p>“They will be housed at the Philippine Immigration Academy in Clark, Pampanga where they will undergo a two-month training on immigration laws and procedures. After which, they will be assigned in different BI offices as on-the-job trainees,” he said.</p>
      <p>Morente added that new hirees must pass examinations before being deployed. “We will only deploy immigration officers who will pass the immigration officers’ course. Being an immigration officer is not easy both physically and mentally. That is also why we will only employ the best of the best,” he said.</p>
      <p>Four months ago, the BI deployed 67 newly-hired immigration officers to the country’s ports and subports.</p>
      <p>“The 100 items are for Immigration Officer I positions with Salary Grade Level 11.  You must be a graduate of a four year course, and have a Career Service Professional Second Level Eligibility from the Civil Service,” announced Morente.</p>
