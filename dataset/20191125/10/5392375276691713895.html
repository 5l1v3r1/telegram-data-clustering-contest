      <p><a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/Honor">Honor</a> is gearing up to reveal the Honor V30 and V30 tomorrow in China. During the last few days, we have been machine-gunned with several leaks of the Honor V30 revealing its design and some of the specifications. We’re just one day from the actual release, but things can’t be different even in the last hours. The Honor V30 has bee spotted in a couple of leaked shots that reveal the handset in all its glory.</p>

      <p>The images appeared on Weibo, and since November 25 date appears in the V30 visor we can say that they are really fresh. The picture confirms the pill-shaped punch-hole enabled the display that will serve as a house for the dual-selfie snappers. The bezels are really slim, so the rumored 91.46% screen-to-body ratio seems accurate here. Moving around to the back we can see the triple-camera setup that is fitted in a vertical alignment. The volume rocker can be seen on the right edge of the device. In addition, we can see the side-mounted fingerprint scanner which is just below the volume buttons. The second shot reveals the retail package which boasts the “Vera” name.</p>
