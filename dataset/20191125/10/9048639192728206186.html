      <p><b>OUACHITA PARISH, La. (KNOE) - </b>A Ouachita Parish man is accused of sexually assaulting a relative in her home and then running through the neighborhood naked.</p>
      <p>According to an arrest report, it happened in the 700 block of Harris Street on Nov. 23, 2019.</p>
      <p>The victim told deputies that Lonnie Peters, 36, came into her house, took his clothes off and attempted to have sex with her. The victim said Peters touched her breasts and tried to remove her clothing. She says she broke her finger fighting him off. Two doors and a lamp were damaged in the process. He then left the home.</p>
      <p>About two hours later, deputies say they found Peters running around the neighborhood naked.</p>
      <p>Peters told deputies that he couldn't remember why he was naked and had no memory of the last few hours.</p>
      <p>According to arrest records, Peters was previously arrested in 2018 for a similar incident on Harris Street. In that arrest, Peters was accused of taking his clothes off and fighting people.</p>
      <p>Peters reportedly told authorities that he was on PCP and he was fighting people because certain people deserved to die.</p>
      <p>In the latest case, Peters was charged with simple battery, simple criminal damage to property, obscenity, sexual battery and failure to appear on a bench warrant.</p>
      <p>He was booked into the Ouachita Correctional Center.</p>
