      <h3>A HOUSE leader proposed the revival of the old sports program  Gintong Alay.</h3>
      <p>House Majority Leader and Leyte Rep. Martin Romualdez said the successful Project Gintong Alay was initiated in 1979 to increase the competitiveness of Filipino athletes in international competitions.</p>
      <p>The Philippines is hosting the 30th SEA Games from November 30 to December 7.</p>
      <p>Romualdez called on the government and business sectors as well as corporate sports patrons to show further “malasakit” (compassion) to athletes by making them realize their full potentials in bringing glory to flag and country.</p>
      <p>“If the country is to create sports superstars and excel in international sporting competitions like the Olympics, Asian and SEA Games, it must re-dedicate itself to the proven concept of the private and public sectors joining hands to spur sports development from the grassroots to the national and international levels,” said Romualdez said as he sent his best wishes to all Filipino athletes.</p>
      <p>Under Project Gintong Alay, Romualdez said corporations adopt athletes from their chosen sporting disciplines to nurture them into world-class competitors.</p>
      <p>Among the famed Project Gintong Alay products were then track and field champions Lydia de Vega, known as Asia’s Sprint Queen; Elma Muros, and two-time Olympian Isidro del Prado and swimmer champion Eric Buhain.</p>
      <p>Romualdez said the country is capable of producing future champions, recalling the country’s glory days with other swimming superstars Christine Jacob and  Akiko Thomson.</p>
      <p>“We have to focus on winning competitions, notably the Asian and SEA Games and the Olympics. In sports competitions, champions are made and not  miraculously born. Athletic prowess has been a source of pride and morale, and a  tool in nation-building in many countries because it mirrors a healthy citizenry,”  Romualdez pointed out.</p>
      <p>According to Romualdez, the Project Gintong Alay was a success because corporate sponsors adopted athletes and provided them sufficient allowances that allowed them to train full-time knowing their families would have food on the table.</p>
      <p>The corporate sponsors also took care of the nutritional needs of their adopted athletes and provided them the funds for exposure in international sporting competitions.</p>
      <p>Romualdez said the country’s top 1500 corporations may have to be invited to join the effort.</p>
      <p>He also wished the best of luck to the Filipino athletes and coaches competing in the SEA Games, which the country would host from November 30 to December 11.</p>
      <p>“Good luck to all our athletes and coaches competing in the SEA Games. As long as we work hard, nothing can prevent the Team Philippines from becoming champion. Fight hard, play fair and win big,” Romualdez said.</p>
