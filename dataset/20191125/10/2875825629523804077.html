      <p>She told OK!: "Liam is a genuinely lovely guy and very down to earth considering how successful he is.</p>
      <p>"If I messaged him and asked him for advice he would give it to me, but I’m not dating him. Liam is lovely but we’re just friends!"</p>
      <p>Amber did however date James Hawkins between April and June 2018.</p>

      <p>He told <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/">The Sun</a> : "I haven’t been on a date with anyone I’ve actually liked since I was with Amber and that’s honestly the truth.</p>
