      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/selena-gomez/">Selena Gomez</a> can’t seem to catch a break these days, as some fans criticised her ‘shaky’ opening performance at the American Music Awards last night.</p>
      <p>After <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/25/selena-gomez-looks-fierce-neon-prepares-support-taylor-swift-american-music-awards-11212671/">hitting the red carpet looking fierce in neon</a>, the 27-year-old singer took to the stage and performed her two new songs, Lose You To Love Me and Look At Her Now.</p>
      <p>She rocked a disco ball-like body suit in her fun and upbeat performance of Look At Her Now in Los Angeles’ Microsoft Theater, but it’s her other new song’s vocal performance drawing criticism.</p>

      <p>One fan wrote on social media: ‘I love Selena Gomez to the bones but her performance of Lose You To Love Me was absolutely shaky.’</p>
      <p>While another tweeted: ‘I have a feeling she was just nervous.’</p>
      <p>Then one fan critiqued: ‘Yikes.. I love Selena, but this just really wasn’t it.’</p>

      <p>But then fans of the Back To You singer rushed to her defence.</p>
      <p>One fan shot back at the haters: ‘The Selena Gomez performance was a bit shaky at first but that’s okay since she was probably really nervous.’</p>
      <p>Another simply tweeted: ‘Proud of you!’</p>
      <p>While another reasoned: ‘For everyone saying that Selena’s performance was shaky, please remember that she hasn’t done a performance like this in years. She was probably a bit nervous and she still killed it.’</p>

      <p>It’s true Selena’s not had the easiest time in the limelight lately.</p>

      <p>She recently <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/12/selena-gomez-messed-vicious-trolling-lupus-weight-gain-11085930/">opened up about the vicious trolling she received</a> during her battle with Lupus in 2015.</p>
      <p>The star was diagnosed with the condition – which is an autoimmune disease that occurs when your body’s immune system attacks your own tissues and organs, causing inflammation that affects different body systems – and let her fans know in 2015.</p>
      <p>She later went on to undergo a secret kidney transplant after complications from the disease, sharing the news on Instagram in September 2017.</p>
      <p>Speaking on the hurtful comments she received online about her weight at the time, she said: ‘That got to me big time.</p>
      <p>‘That really messed me up for a bit.’</p>
      <p>She also revealed she went ‘<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/03/15/selena-gomez-suffered-depression-life-saving-kidney-transplant-7388704/">through a depression</a>’ after her kidney transplant.</p>
