      <p>A 19-year-old college student in Chicago was found strangled to death Saturday morning inside her car parked in a campus parking garage, a report said.</p>
      <p>University of Illinois at Chicago student Ruth George, who was from a Chicago suburb, was discovered in a family-owned car in the Halsted Street Parking Garage about 11:15 a.m. — shortly after her family reported her missing, <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/breaking/ct-uic-body-20191123-pzqhcxb4ebfopebbmbmc2bl2te-story.html">according to the Chicago Tribune</a>.</p>
      <p>Campus police said Sunday they had a person of interest in custody, the report said.</p>
      <p>That person was not immediately identified.</p>
      <p>George was seen arriving at the garage alone at about 1:30 a.m. Saturday, according to police. Shortly after, the person in custody entered the garage.</p>
      <p>Campus police found George after witnesses reported seeing an unconscious woman alone in the backseat of a car.</p>
      <p>“It is very difficult to find words that can express the sadness our entire community experiences today,” the university’s chancellor, Michael Amiridis, said in a statement obtained by the paper.</p>
      <p>“We offer our sincere condolences to the student’s family and friends and I know that all of us have them in our hearts as they struggle with this devastating loss.”</p>
