      <h2>New Bluebirds boss Neil Harris made a big statement with how he set his team up against Charlton Athletic</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T10:00:32+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 10:00</time> by <a rel="author">Glen Williams</a></address>
      <p>There was an air of inevitability about Neil Harris selecting Gary Madine to start against Charlton Athletic.</p>
      <p>Madine, who is now 22 goals without a game for the Bluebirds following his £6m move from Bolton almost two years ago, has come in for copious amounts of criticism in the Welsh capital, but perhaps Harris' show of faith can relight the fire in the striker's belly.</p>
      <p>Many believed the previously out-of-favour forward would be one of the main beneficiaries of Harris' appointment, tipped to be brought back in from the cold in hope of recapturing his best form – which City fans are yet to see.</p>
      <p>That was indeed the case and when you look a little closer at the success both Harris and Madine have had away from the Welsh capital, it is a easier to see why.</p>
      <p>Some of Madine's best years, both at Sheffield Wednesday and at Bolton, often came while operating alongside a strike partner in a 4-4-2, feeding off and linking up with another forward.</p>
      <p>Harris has historically preferred playing two up top, but given the paucity of in-form strikers at Cardiff City Stadium, it was uncertain whether the manager would adopt his tried and tested formation.</p>
      <p>However Harris did in fact name Madine alongside Callum Paterson, another player who has come up shy of producing his best form so far this season, and Saturday's trip to The Valley represented a real opportunity for them to grab their chances.</p>
      <p>While neither particularly covered themselves in glory, many believe Madine came out of the game with more credit than Paterson, who, barring two penalty shouts, struggled. Perhaps the more pressing question, in fact, should be where Paterson's form has disappeared to rather than Madine's inclusion.</p>
      <p>But if the pair continue to impress Harris on the training ground they will be given every opportunity.</p>

      <p>"I just went with what I've seen during the week," Harris said of Madine's inclusion.</p>
      <p>"Gary has proven himself over the years to be a real handful as a striker and I've tried to make decisions not based on previous games this season or what I know of players from previous seasons.</p>
      <p>"I've tried to base it on what I've seen during the week and how we wanted to play against Charlton.</p>
      <p>"I thought Gary had two really good chances from headers that he'll be disappointed he hasn't done better with.</p>
      <p>"But he's been hungry all week to play, the same as Callum Paterson, I just thought they were the right starters."</p>
      <p>Two things can be gleaned from Harris' post-match comments.</p>
      <p>Firstly, Madine has clearly had the bit between his teeth. A new manager has come in and he has viewed it as a new lease of life and, in fairness, it is testament to his character that he has worked hard to force his way back into the reckoning.</p>
      <p>Secondly, Harris really wants to banish any preconceptions and is sticking by his mantra of affording the squad a clean slate.</p>
      <p>If Harris should be given some latitude, rightly so given he is new to the job, then perhaps so should Madine.</p>

      <p>No striker truly flourished under Neil Warnock at Cardiff City — Kenneth Zohore enjoyed a purple patch while Madine even scored three times for Sheffield United during his loan spell there last season — so now should be the start of a new chapter for the forwards.</p>
      <p>A new manager and a new system at Cardiff, which already appears to show glimpses of more progressive, passing football, could release the shackles on all of City's strikers.</p>
      <p>And, before we get too carried away, it's not as though Madine is forcing Cristiano Ronaldo or Lionel Messi out of the side. City's strikers this season have come up short of the mark so far this term.</p>
      <p>Robert Glatzel, two goals in 11 games, including a penalty, Omar Bogle, one goal in 10, and Isaac Vassell, who has been hit with injury but has scored once in three games, have all failed to make that forward berth their own.</p>
      <p>The only striker who has shown glimpses of any real form is Danny Ward, who has scored three goals in eight outings, and he will likely be put straight back into the starting line-up once his red card ban is served following the Stoke game.</p>
      <p>For some, the die has been cast for Madine and they want the club to recoup as much as they can in January in order to reinvest.</p>
      <p>Some supporters won't begin to be won over until he gets that monkey off his back and breaks that goal duck. That will only go some way to winning them over, too.</p>
      <p>But if it is a clean slate for one then it is a clean slate for all and who is to say that Madine and Ward cannot work in tandem up front?</p>
      <p>Of course much of that centres around whether Harris adjusts his system to accommodate Lee Tomlin, but that's a different conversation all together.</p>
      <p>Given Glatzel is sidelined through injury, Madine with his back to goal and Ward sniping around the six-yard box and making those runs in behind might just be the best option the Bluebirds boss has at his disposal.</p>
