      <h1>Joe Edwards: Plymouth Argyle's players cannot wait to see new grandstand full with fans</h1>
      <h2>The £8m-plus grandstand will open for the first time against Morecambe on December 14</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T10:32:01+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 10:32</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Errington</a></address>
      <p>Joe Edwards says he and his Plymouth Argyle team-mates are ‘lucky to be a part of this club’ as the £8million-plus Mayflower Grandstand is close to reopening.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/all-about/plymouth-argyle">Home Park</a> has been a three-sided stadium since the start of the 2018/19 season due to the redevelopment work.</p>
      <p>However, the rebuilt 5,403-seat grandstand will be open to 50 per cent capacity for the League Two game against Derek Adams’ Morecambe on December 14.</p>
      <p>That will increase to 75 per cent for the visit of Stevenage on December 29.</p>
      <p>The grandstand will then be fully open for the New Year’s Day game against current league leaders Swindon Town, taking the capacity of Home Park to 18,200.</p>
      <p>The crowd for that fixture could be close to that limit given the current form of both teams.</p>
      <p>The new dug-outs at the front of the grandstand were used for the first time when Edwards scored one of the goals in Argyle’s 2-1 win against Bradford City on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Edwards said: “It’s exciting even just walking out and seeing it (the grandstand). It looks fantastic and it will look even better when it’s full.</p>
      <p>“Hopefully we will can get it full and really rocking. If we are up near the top of the table the fans will be there in their numbers.</p>
      <p>“Everyone has done a fantastic job on it and we are just lucky to be a part of this club at the moment when it has been built. We are really looking forward to it being open.”</p>
      <p>Argyle’s average home attendance after nine league games at Home Park this season is 9,453.</p>
      <p>That is second best in the division, behind only Bradford (14,105).</p>
      <p>Swindon are third (7,326) followed by Leyton Orient (5,736), Northampton Town (5,182) and Exeter City (5,124).</p>
      <p>Argyle have won four of their last five league games to move up to eighth position.</p>
      <p>With the return of Adams to Home Park coming up, followed by two post-Christmas fixtures there is every chance of 10,000-plus crowds for the next three matches there.</p>
      <p>Edwards said: “We are on a good run and I think if we are in and around it at Christmas we can really kick on after that. Who knows where it can take us.”</p>
      <p>For now, though, Argyle’s attention turns to the FA Cup and their second round tie away to Bristol Rovers on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Argyle lost 1-0 to Rovers in a pre-season match at Home Park at the end of July.</p>
      <p>The teams then drew 1-1 in an EFL Trophy group game in early September, with the Pilgrims winning the subsequent penalty shoot-out 5-3.</p>
      <p>Now they are set to meet again, but this time at the Memorial Stadium.</p>

      <p>Edwards said: “It’s a good game for us. They are the league above but we have beaten Bolton already this year (1-0 in the first round).</p>
      <p>“We have played them a couple of times already this year. We are going there full of confidence.</p>
      <p>“It’s a distraction away from the league where we can just concentrate on this. It’s a one-off game and we are looking forward to it.”</p>
