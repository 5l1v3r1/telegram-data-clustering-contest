      <h1>How Sonko Retaliated While at The Standard Offices Over Critical Headline</h1>

        <b>Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko, on Monday, November 20, went to great lengths to prove a point during his visit for an interview at the Standard Group offices along Mombasa Road.</b>
      </p>
      <p>According to photos that surfaced online that day shortly after his interview on <i>Radio Maisha</i>, the properly suited governor emerged semi-clothed with a Tshirt that read "Most Dangerous"</p>
      <p>Sonko had earlier told <i>Spice FM</i> that he agreed with <i>The Standard</i>'s Friday, November 22, edition headlined that read," <a href="https://www.kenyans.co.ke/news/46697-embattled-sonko-responds-damning-standard-headline-audio">Is Sonko The Most Dangerous Man in Kenya?</a>"</p>
      <p>To explain his behaviour, the governor explained that he accepted he was the most dangerous man in Kenya mostly because of his war against corruption which he claimed has placed him on a collision course with the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC).</p>

      <p>"When you step on the floor, there is a lot of force applied. In a slippery floor, one can easily slip, roll down and get injured. This applies to the war against corruption. I have done my part. </p>
      <p>"I have sealed many corruption loopholes. Many have been suspended and prosecuted over the same. I am the most dangerous man in matters of fighting corruption and I will not relent on it," stated the governor.</p>
      <p>The paper had laid bare <a href="https://www.kenyans.co.ke/news/29226-ahmednasir-posts-photos-sonko-and-goons-who-attacked-timothy-muriuki">Sonko's antics in the city</a>, stating that with his money, energy, and chequered past, the governor seemed to be operating above the law.</p>
      <p>"He has cowed even top government officers and detectives, a populist whose antics excite some - a master of expletives - his leadership style is suffocating the city. How do you solve a problem like Sonko?" the publication posed.</p>
      <p>During the <i>Radio Maisha</i> interview, the governor also stated that he would not be cowed in ensuring that corruption was dealt with properly and praised president Uhuru Kenyatta's efforts.</p>
      <p>He had previously claimed that an EACC official grabbed a parcel of land in South C Nairobi where he was putting up a mall. The land was originally meant to host an ECDE centre, the governor claimed.</p>
