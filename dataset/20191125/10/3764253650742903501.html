      </p>
      <p>He accused the opposition party of spending million to raise false alarms and cover their disastrous outing in the Kogi election.</p>
      <p>Kingsly said the APC did not win the governorship election through violence, noting that the victory came via a combination of strategic planning of Governor <a href="https://www.legit.ng/tag/governor-yahaya-bello.html">Yahaya Bello</a>.</p>
      <p><i>“First, APC did a soul searching and realised it might not do too well in the election if it failed to come together as one united family. That led the leadership of the party to initiate a robust reconciliatory move that re-united the various factions within the party into one happy family,</i>” he said.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“Second, the APC went on an aggressive marketing drive across the state to showcase its achievements since it assumed <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1256503-power-season-6-cast-episodes-where-to-watch.html">power</a> in 2016 and this endeared prospective voters to the party, having seen the margin of difference in what APC achieved in less than four years compared with PDP’s 16 years of waste."</i>
