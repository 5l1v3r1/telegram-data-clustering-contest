      </p>
      <p>—</p>
      <p>The turkey and all the fat-laden trimmings of a traditional Thanksgiving meal were traded for a "ToFurky" made of plant-based proteins and no meat, plus a host of other plant-based dishes.</p>
      <p>And no one at the table cried fowl.</p>
      <p>The hungry crowd that gathered for a meal on a recent Sunday wasn't shocked by this culinary spin on the holiday — a day when many Americans expect to enjoy a bountiful feast of the richest (and most caloric) foods imaginable.</p>
      <p>Instead, diners like Shivani and Krishna Gandhi of Moore expected the intentional twist served up at the "Community Plant-based Thanksgiving" in northeast Oklahoma City.</p>
      <p>And they enjoyed it.</p>
      <p>"We've been vegetarians our whole lives but we really liked this because it was the first time that we've been able to eat a complete (Thanksgiving) meal that is vegetarian. We loved it," Shivani Gandhi said.</p>
      <p>The pair's glowing words were just what Choctaw residents Lamar and Laurel Mauldin hoped to hear. As the father-daughter founders of the faith-based nonprofit A Table in the Wilderness, the Mauldins set out to serve dishes that the crowd of 100 people would describe as delicious, even though the food wasn't full of saturated fat or unhealthy amounts of sugar or salt. And there wasn't any meat on the plates — no turkey, chicken, goose, ham or roast — either.</p>
      <p>The Mauldins are Seventh-Day Adventists, a religion that promotes a diet rich in whole foods, avoids processed foods and consumption of alcohol and most meats.</p>
      <p>Laurel Mauldin said the Thanksgiving twist was in keeping with their organization's mission to show metro residents that there are healthier alternatives to the foods traditionally served for the holiday — and every day.</p>
      <p>Her dad said the nonprofit has a biblical foundation.</p>
      <p>"God has told us from the very beginning what we should eat — food that won't make us sick, food that will make us well," he told guests.</p>
      <p>Laurel Mauldin said she could rattle off several Bible verses that point to the Lord's interest in people's physical health. One in particular, 3 John 2, recently came to mind.</p>
      <p>"A lot of people don't think that the mind and body and God are connected but they are because He is the Creator of us all and He wants us to put good things in our body," she said.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Focusing on food desert</b>
      </p>
      <p>The free dinner held Nov. 17 was served at the National Women in Agriculture Association's building at 1701 N Martin Luther King Ave., where the Mauldins and Tammy Gray-Steele, the agriculture organization's leader, said the two groups have similar healthy objectives for the community.</p>
      <p>"We paired with them by providence because our goal is the same: to bring adequate healthy food to those who need it," Lamar Mauldin said.</p>
      <p>The Mauldins initially focused on providing nutrition education for older adults at a predominantly black northeast Oklahoma City senior living center in 2017 and 2018. Eventually, they began offering interactive cooking classes at the Midwest City Library before turning their attention to the neighborhoods surrounding the intersection of NE 23 and Martin Luther King Avenue.</p>
      <p>Laurel Mauldin said this area is generally known as a "food desert," an urban area where people do not have easy access to affordable, fresh produce or other healthy foods.</p>
      <p>The Mauldins also were drawn to northeast Oklahoma City because they felt the health needs of the predominantly black community needed to be addressed. With heart disease and diabetes acknowledged problems across Oklahoma, she said, eating more healthy foods can help residents combat obesity which is a risk factor for heart disease, diabetes, stroke and other ailments that challenge their quality of life.</p>
      <p>Susan Gay, a health educator who calls herself a "medical missionary," gave a brief presentation about the risk of stroke as people ate helpings of green bean casserole, a gluten free tofu roast, stuffing, sweet potato casserole and desserts like apple and dairy-free versions of pumpkin pie and cheesecake.</p>
      <p>The plant-based meal was not a novelty for many of the guests. Several students and faculty members of Oklahoma Academy, a private Christian school in Harrah that's affiliated with the Seventh-Day Adventist Church, said they already eat mostly plant-based foods. The students helped serve dinner guests and performed several faith-themed songs.</p>
      <p>However, some of the guests came to learn about healthier alternatives to their less-healthy favorite foods.</p>
      <p>Meat eater Alisha Northington of Oklahoma City said she attended the dinner out of curiosity, hoping she might be enticed to cook some of the plant-based dishes for herself. She said she was seriously thinking of buying a ToFurky for Thanksgiving.</p>
      <p>"I think it's great because I'm trying to make a transition to plant-based food," she said. "It's a struggle, but I'm trying."</p>
      <p>Laurel Mauldin said she and her father enjoyed another opportunity to inject health education into the community.</p>
      <p>"We wanted to reach out to our community to say, 'Yes you can take your health into your own hands and yes, you can be healthy,'" she said.</p>
      <p>Her dad said the foods served at the recent dinner were more "sumptuous" than those that someone on an everyday plant-based diet would eat. He said they were what he called "transition foods."</p>
      <p>However, he said he hoped the dishes tantalized the diners' taste buds enough so they might be tempted to serve up some plant-based options at a future meal of their own.</p>
      <p>"We hope that someone received a blessing and learned that you can eat healthy and it tastes good," he said.</p>
