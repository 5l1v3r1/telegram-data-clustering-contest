        <b>Meet The Zimbabwean Running R50 Million Empire In South Africa</b>
      </p>
      <p>You probably had not heard the name Tinashe Ruzane until today. Maybe because the down to earth gentleman prefers to have his work speak for him and he is one example of grabbing the bulls by the horns balls, sorry, horns, or both. Tinashe Ruzane is one typical mover and shaker in the disruptive technology industry as he has harnessed and taken full advantage of the system.</p>

      <p>The former Uber employee started a business model typically similar to Uber but with a twist.  His company, Flexiclub, lets you rent out your ‘spare’ or unused vehicle – and get paid for it. After three years, the company will buy the car from you if you so wish.</p>
      <p>The vehicles are, in turn, rented out to Uber drivers who cannot afford to buy vehicles of their own. According to Flexclub co-founder, Tinashe Ruzane, the Uber drivers also have the opportunity to buy the vehicles from them.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/tinashe-ruzane">Ruzane</a> says they have up to R50 million worth of cars rented out to them since their launch last year.</p>
      <p>Impressed by the idea, he bought his own vehicle and rented it out to a driver. He noticed that a lot of would-be drivers could not secure vehicle finance. He then approached Uber with an idea to, hopefully, change that.</p>
      <aside>“There was a lot of data that they had on the drivers that if used properly could help the drivers clear their records, making them trustworthy for a vehicle loan.”</aside>
      <p>Uber hired him in 2015 and in 2016 he moved to Amsterdam where he worked as their head of vehicle solutions in charge of Europe, the Middle East and Africa.</p>
      <p>He then moved back to South Africa where he established his new multi-million rand company which is growing in leaps and bounds.</p>
      <aside>If you have a “spare” sedan (2013 model and younger) that has done fewer than 60 000 kilometres, you can expect to earn R4500 per month.</aside>
      <p>Flexclub insures the cars and covers maintenance costs.</p>
      <p>It pays car owners directly; how much or how little the Uber driver made in a month is irrelevant – your payment is guaranteed.</p>
