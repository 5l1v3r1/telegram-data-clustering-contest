      <h1>Corruption Inquiry Spreads to U.A.W. Lakeside Resort</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T10:00:24+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 10:00</time> by <a rel="author">Neal E. Boudette</a></address>
      <p>ONAWAY, Mich. — The United Auto Workers union is based in Detroit, but its spiritual home lies 250 miles to the north, in a dense and remote forest on the shores of Black Lake.</p>
      <p>Here, 40 miles from the nearest Starbucks, the U.A.W. owns a spartan retreat known to few people outside the auto industry, though it opened nearly 50 years ago. Covering 1,000 acres, the gated compound includes cabins, lodges, a banquet hall and a recreation center with an Olympic-size swimming pool. An eternal flame marks the hilltop resting place of the ashes of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/10/movies/brothers-on-the-line-sasha-reuthers-film-on-the-uaw.html?module=inline">Walter Reuther</a>, who built the U.A.W. into one of the most powerful unions in the country in the 1950s and 1960s.</p>
      <p>This tranquil scene was disrupted in August when the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/28/business/uaw-fbi-raid.html?module=inline">F.B.I. raided the compound</a>, seizing documents and records. The raid was the latest chapter in a yearslong Justice Department investigation into corruption at the union that has thrown the U.A.W. into turmoil and embroiled two of Detroit’s Big Three automakers — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/20/business/gm-fiat-chrysler-lawsuit.html?module=inline">Fiat Chrysler and General Motors</a>.</p>
      <p>The resort was one of a half-dozen locations government agents searched. The raids signaled that investigators were not done with their work, despite having charged or won convictions of a dozen union officials and three Fiat Chrysler executives.</p>
      <p>Last week, the U.A.W. president, Gary Jones, resigned as the union’s executive board was preparing to remove him for the submission of false expense reports and using union money for personal gain. The U.A.W. said Mr. Jones had concealed the use of more than $1 million in union funds for luxury travel, extravagant dinners and purchases of high-price cigars, golf clubs and apparel for himself, his family and his lieutenants.</p>
      <p>What drew federal agents to Black Lake is not clear. But union members and labor experts have criticized the U.A.W.’s unusual decision to build a luxury lakeside cabin at the resort for the exclusive use of Mr. Jones’s predecessor as president, Dennis Williams. Federal agents searched the cabin and separately raided a home owned by Mr. Williams in Corona, Calif. The union is reviewing other financial transactions for possible wrongdoing, and now plans to sell the cabin and the land that it sits on in a secluded corner of the retreat, said Brian Rothenberg, a U.A.W. spokesman.</p>
      <p>The decision to sell the cabin was part of a set of reforms instituted by the acting president, Rory Gamble, after he took the helm from Mr. Jones. “Restoring the full faith and trust of our membership and protecting their interests is the top priority,” Mr. Rothenberg said.</p>
      <p>The U.A.W. provided more modest, rustic cabins within the retreat complex for other previous retired presidents, and the union is considering ending that practice, too.</p>
      <p>Union members and supporters say it is particularly disappointing that the resort — formally called the <a href="https://uawblacklake.com/">Walter P. and May Reuther Family Education Center</a> — has been pulled into the investigation. The union uses it as a place for members to study the past and plan for the future in training seminars and conferences.</p>
      <p>“Black Lake serves a critical purpose for the union,” said Harley Shaiken, a labor relations professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who has attended and taught seminars at the retreat since the 1970s. “It’s historically important for the union. It’s meant to get people together to debate critical issues. It’s a place of thinking and engaging.”</p>
      <p>When the retreat opened in 1970, it was heralded for its timbered beams and spare Scandinavian design.</p>
      <p>Today, rather than a showplace for the U.A.W., Black Lake is a part of the union’s financial difficulties. The union spends several million dollars a year to operate it — money that is classified as a loan to the subsidiary that operates Black Lake. In 2018, the accumulated debt amounted to more than $60 million.</p>
      <p>Anyone can book a stay there. During a recent overnight stay, I found it dated. Guest rooms feature few of the amenities found in modern hotels, like Wi-Fi and cable TV. Some hallways were marked by musty odors. But a golf course the U.A.W. built just outside the retreat in 2000, at a cost of $6.7 million, is considered one of the best in Michigan.</p>
      <p>At the main gate, I was told only union-made vehicles were allowed on the grounds. I had to park my Volkswagen in a lot outside the perimeter. Some Chevrolets and Fords were parked there, too, because vehicles made in Mexico are not welcome, either.</p>

      <p>That week Black Lake was hosting about 150 workers for a weeklong seminar on the history of organized labor and the U.A.W. Any member is welcome to attend such courses. The union covers the cost and offsets the wages workers would have earned that week. Participants said they spent much of the day in lectures — instructors take attendance. One afternoon is set aside for recreation.</p>
      <p>When I visited, the large gymnasium with two full-size basketball courts and the pool were empty most of the day. Six pool tables remained untouched in a darkened room.</p>
      <p>These days, senior union officials often hold meetings in places like Orlando, Fla., Washington, D.C., and May, N.J. Before becoming the U.A.W. president in 2018, Mr. Jones ran a regional office in Hazelwood, Mo., and held annual conferences in Palm Springs, Calif. Court filings by federal prosecutors and an internal union complaint against Mr. Jones claim that he and other union officials booked luxury villas for four weeks or more, even though the Palm Springs conferences lasted less than a week.</p>
      <p>In raids at Mr. Jones’s home and elsewhere, agents seized thousands of dollars in cash, hundreds of bottles of high-price liquor, hundreds of golf shirts, multiple sets of golf clubs and large quantities of cigars that had been billed to union accounts, according to court filings. One dinner described by prosecutors ran up a bill of $6,599.87 that included $1,760 for four bottles of Louis Roederer Cristal Champagne.</p>
      <p>A lawyer for Mr. Jones, J. Bruce Maffeo, said the suggestion that the conference expenses had been concealed “is without any basis in fact.” Spending for the conferences in Palm Springs was “laid out in sufficient detail to the U.A.W. accounting department over a period of years.”</p>
      <p>A close associate of Mr. Jones who helped organize the conferences in Palm Springs and has been charged by federal prosecutors, Vance Pearson, resigned from the U.A.W. on Sunday. The union had been taking steps to remove him from his post as a regional director.</p>
      <p>Back at the union’s Black Lake resort, the stone and glass cabin for Mr. Williams, the former president, is in a fenced-off area more than a mile from the main complex. But it is accessible from the lake. Wading in to its shoreline, I found the home with picture windows facing the lake. According to the county planning office, the 1,885-square-foot residence has cherry cabinets, granite countertops, three-and-a-half baths and a stone patio.</p>
      <p>Mr. Reuther hoped the union would train future generations of leaders in the contemplative setting far from the toil of assembly lines. At one time, it had a day care center — Mr. Reuther imagined workers’ families joining them on their retreats.</p>
      <p>He also hoped it would be a place where the U.A.W. could use its power to solve societal problems. The first event held at Black Lake was a conference on the environment that the union organized with the United Nations in the summer of 1970.</p>
      <p>Such was the U.A.W.’s reach that it could attract foreign government officials to Northern Michigan. But Mr. Reuther didn’t attend the event. He died in a plane crash while traveling to Black Lake a few months earlier.</p>
      <p>Shortly after the resort opened, the union waged a bitter strike against G.M., and it eventually prevailed, coming away with significant wage increases. The strike was tough on the union, which depleted its strike fund and went into debt, even mortgaging Black Lake to the Teamsters for a time.</p>
      <p>By the 1980s, the Big Three auto companies and the union were in a slow decline. Today, the U.A.W.’s membership has <a href="https://uaw.org/about/">fallen to about 400,000</a>, from as many as 1.5 million when Mr. Reuther ran it. But it still remains a potent force, recently winning higher wages and bonuses for G.M. workers after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/25/business/gm-contract.html?module=inline">a 40-day strike</a>.</p>
      <p>Around the time G.M. and Chrysler were in bankruptcy in 2009, the U.A.W. tried sell the resort, which was viewed as a luxury when thousands of workers were losing their jobs. But the union couldn’t find a buyer.</p>
      <p>That’s good news, said JoAn Matney, a retired autoworker from Toledo. “It’s empowering and fun to go there,” she said. “I definitely think they should keep it.”</p>
