      <h1>Pundit gives Arsenal encouragement over replacing Unai Emery with Mauricio Pochettino</h1>

        <b>Former Tottenham star Jamie Redknapp believes Arsenal manager Unai Emery looks finished at the Emirates Stadium and that Mauricio Pochettino would be an ideal replacement.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Argentine was just last week sacked by Spurs and replaced by Jose Mourinho, but many neutrals will be puzzled to see such a big name dismissed by his club when Emery continues to stay in his job.</p>

      <p>The Spaniard has not looked at all convincing since replacing Arsene Wenger a year and a half ago, and Redknapp says he’d replace him with Pochettino “in a heartbeat”.</p>
      <p>In truth, many Gunners fans will probably feel the same at this point, with Pochettino doing hugely impressive work during his time with Tottenham.</p>
      <p>One imagines the 47-year-old could also have a number of other top jobs on offer to him soon, so it remains to be seen how likely he’d be to choose Arsenal at this moment in time.</p>
      <p>Still, Redknapp has given AFC some encouragement over this potential move, stating that he doesn’t believe Pochettino’s Spurs connections would stop him taking over their bitter north London rivals.</p>

      <p>“If I was a decision maker at Arsenal, I’d go for Mauricio Pochettino in a heartbeat. I’m not sure I believe Poch would let his time with Tottenham stop him from taking over,” the pundit wrote in his column for the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7720953/JAMIE-REDKNAPP-Frank-Lampard-debunking-NGolo-Kante-myth.html">Daily Mail</a>.</p>
      <p>“Maybe the reason Spurs decided to go for Jose Mourinho so suddenly was they felt they could not hang around, because their north London rivals might be searching for a new boss soon.</p>
      <p>“Unai Emery is under big, big pressure. I have some sympathy for him but he looks a beaten man.”</p>
