      <p>Having booked their place in the final of this year’s Telkom Knockout for the first time ever, Maritzburg United now turn their focus to the Absa Premiership with a suspension to deal with.</p>

      <p>Keagan Buchanan put in a fine performance against his former employers, Kaizer Chiefs, as the Team of Choice beat the Glamour Boys 2-1 to set up a final against Mamelodi Sundowns in Durban next month, but the midfielder will now have to sit out Wednesday’s clash with SuperSport United.</p>
      <p>The former Amakhosi man was booked in the first half of the game at Mbombela Stadium on Sunday, with his fourth yellow of the season meaning that he faces a one-game ban. Kwanda Mngonyama, however, can return after serving his two-match suspension following his red card v Orlando Pirates.</p>
      <p>After recovering from serious injury problems, Buchanan has now played as many Absa Premiership games in 2019/20 so far as he did in the last two seasons combined, and will be eager to keep up his form if given the chance to shine in the TKO final at Moses Mabhida Stadium next month.</p>

      <p>Maritzburg are now eight games unbeaten in all competitions for the first time since September 2011 - their longest run without defeat for the best part of a decade – and have lost just eight of the 29 games that Eric Tinkler has been in charge of since his arrival back in February. </p>
