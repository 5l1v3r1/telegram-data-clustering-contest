      <h2>Ninja Gaiden star not-so-surprise guest</h2>

      <p>Koei Tecmo has announced the next DLC character for the latest entry in fighting franchise <i>Dead or Alive 6</i>, and its fiend-hunter Rachel, star of the popular <i>Ninja Gaiden</i> series. No release date was revealed, but the leather-bound ass-kicker is expected to arrive before the year is out.<br/><br/>Rachel's return represents the latest in a series of characters - many of whom were base roster members or paid DLC in<i> Dead or Alive 5's</i> revisions - making their return as DLC in <i>Dead or Alive 6</i>. Other characters guilty of this include Nyotengu (was paid DLC in <i>DoA 5</i>, now a pre-order bonus in <i>DoA 6</i>), and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../king-of-fighters-mai-shiranui-and-kula-diamond-headed-to-dead-or-alive-6-556514.phtml"><i>KoF</i>'s Mai Shiranui,</a> (was paid DLC in <i>DoA 5</i>, and is now paid DLC <i>again </i>in<i> DoA 6</i>). <br/><br/><i>Dead or Alive 6</i>, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../review-dead-or-alive-6-544248.phtml">a game mostly unchanged</a> from its 2012 predecessor, continues to set a new standard of repetition with its character and costume DLC. That's <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../dead-or-alive-6-announces-its-third-80-season-pass-570940.phtml">without making mention of a <i>third</i> $80 season pass,</a> announced within just 10 months of the game's initial launch. <i>DoA</i> gonna <i>DoA</i>, I guess.</p>
