      <h3>GOVERNMENT forces rescued a British businessman  and his wife who were abducted by members of Abu Sayyaf Group ( ASG) during their operation yesterday morning in Parang Sulu.</h3>
      <p>This was confirmed by  Lt. Col. Gerald Monfort, spokesman of Joint Task Force Sulu. Monfort identified the victims as  Allan Hyrons and Filipina wife Wilma.</p>
      <p>The couple were rescued by  troops of the Philippine Army’s (PA) 2nd Infantry Battalion(IB) yesterday morning at Mt. Piahan, Parang, Sulu.</p>
      <p>Record showed that the victims were abducted by the bandits last October 4 from Hyrons Beach Resorts in Tukuran, Zamboanga del Sur.</p>
      <p>According to  JTF Sulu Commander Major General Corleto Vinluan Jr., the bandits were forced to hide the kidnapped victims with a minimum number of guards to avoid being detected by the military.</p>
      <p>“They were unaware that we are monitoring and have anticipated their actions,”  Vinluan said .</p>
      <p>“Our troops were able to close in on the Abu Sayyaf Group and engaged them in a firefight. Overwhelmed by our forces they withdrew from the site, allowing our soldiers to rescue the couple. Our unrelenting efforts to flush out these terrorists allowed our troops to pinpoint the location of the enemy and finally free the kidnap victims,” Vinluan said.</p>
