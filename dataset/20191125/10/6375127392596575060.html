      <h3>POLICE Regional Office 12 director, Brigadier General Alfred S. Corpus, yesterday said he has ordered the administrative relief of eight police station chiefs in Cotabato and South Cotabato provinces for their poor performance in the campaign against illegal drugs and other forms of criminality in their jurisdiction.</h3>
      <p>Relieved from their respective posts starting Friday last week were the chiefs of police of the Pigcawayan, Tulunan, Magpet, Antipas, Carmen and Kabacan Municipal Police Stations under the Cotabato Police Provincial Office and the Surallah and Tupi MPS of the South Cotabato PPO.</p>
      <p>Corpus said that the relief of the eight was in line with the program thrust of Philippine National Police Officer-in-Charge, Lieutenant General Archie Francisco F. Gamboa which calls for the strict monitoring of the performance of every PNP unit beginning at the National Headquarters down to the regional level.</p>
      <p>He also stressed that all leaders must take full responsibility for the implementation of all law enforcement campaigns and each one will strictly be held accountable on what his/her unit does or fails to do.</p>
      <p>The PRO12 director said that due to their poor performance, the eight were relieved and will be replaced by fresh faces.</p>
      <p>“This action taken is not aimed at looking who is at fault but to make way for the improvement of administrative and operational capabilities of each unit and office of this Police Regional Office. In such a way we can make sure that our commanders will always deliver results for their share of weight in our campaign against illegal drugs and other anti-criminality campaign,” Corpus said.</p>
