      <p>Concept images which show how the Royal babies could look in 20 years' time have been released.</p>
      <p>As the new generation of the royal family expands, public demand is at its peak. Whether it’s a royal wedding or the birth of a royal baby, the whole nation is at a standstill wanting to know more. </p>
      <p>With Meghan Markle giving birth to baby Archie earlier this year, all eyes and ears are on the latest royal babies, especially those closest in line to the throne. But what will the royal babies look like in 20 years’ time? Whose features will they take?</p>
      <p>A team of designers at beauty discovery website  <a href="http://www.cosmetify.com/">www.cosmetify.com</a>  have gazed into their crystal balls and created some concept images that depict what the royal babies could look like when they’re older. The images are of Prince George, Princess Charlotte, Prince Louis, Prince Archie and Savannah Phillips.</p>
