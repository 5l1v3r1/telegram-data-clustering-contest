      <h1>Rangers in Europa League boost as Feyenoord rocked by injury crisis</h1>
      <h2>The Rotterdam club are in poor form and injuries are not helping.</h2>

      <p>Feyenoord have been hit with an injury crisis ahead of this week's <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/europa-league">Europa League</a> clash against <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> with on loan Roma full back Rick Karsdorp out and main striker Nicolai Jorgensen extremely doubtful.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/ibrox-stadium">Ibrox</a> side travel to Rotterdam hoping to take a step closer to qualifying for the knockout stages of the competition.</p>
      <p>And their task has been made easier after former Rangers boss Dick Advocaat revealed two of his key players almost certainly won't play.</p>
      <p>Dutch international right back Karsdorp, who cost Roma Â£15 million before being loaned back to Feyenoord, has a calf injury.</p>
      <p>And Danish hitman Jorgensen is looking unlikely to make it after injuring a thigh in training.</p>
      <p>Advocaat said: "Rick Karsdorp is out for two weeks and won't play against Rangers.</p>
      <p>"And Nicolai suffered an injury in training. He's a real doubt for this week's game. We won't know until the day before.</p>
      <p>"And I would rather give players a chance to rest properly anyway.</p>
      <p>"I want them to be fully fit when they return, not constantly checking if they are fit or not."</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/feyenoord">Feyenoord</a> also have a doubt over another full back, Ridgeciano Haps, who missed their weekend draw at Groningen.</p>
