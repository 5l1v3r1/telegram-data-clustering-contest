      <h1>Gold Technical Analysis: Remains vulnerable near 1-week lows, just above $1455 level</h1>

        <li>
          <b>A retest of monthly lows, around $1445, remains a distinct possibility.</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/markets/commodities/metals/gold">Gold</a> traded with a mild negative bias for the fourth consecutive session on Monday and is currently placed near one-week lows, just above the $1455 horizontal support.</p>
      <p>Given that the commodity has been trending lower along a two-month-old descending trend-channel, the near-term set-up remains tilted in favour of bearish traders.</p>
      <p>This coupled with the recent failures near the 100-day SMA support-turned-resistance further reinforce the negative outlook amid renewed US-China trade optimism.</p>
      <p>Moreover, technical <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/indicators">indicators</a> on the daily <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/chart">chart</a> maintained their bearish bias and support prospects for an extension of the recent pullback from multi-year tops.</p>
      <p>Hence, some follow-through selling below the $1455 support zone will set the stage for a slide towards retesting monthly swing lows around the $1445 region.</p>
      <p>On the flip side, any meaningful recovery attempt might now confront some fresh supply and remain capped near the $1470 strong horizontal <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/support-resistance">resistance</a>.</p>
