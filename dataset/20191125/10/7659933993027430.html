      <p>Iran on Monday rejected a US court order for Tehran to pay $180 million in damages to a Washington Post reporter for jailing him on espionage charges.<br/><br/>Jason Rezaian spent 544 days in an Iranian prison before he was released in January 2016 in exchange for seven Iranians held in the US.<br/><br/>On Friday, a US district court judge ordered damages be paid to Rezaian and his family in compensation for pain and suffering as well as economic losses, AFP reported.<br/><br/>The Iranian foreign ministry's spokesman described the journalist's decision to seek damages as "strange."<br/><br/>"Mr. Jason Rezaian... was a security convict and the Islamic Republic of Iran commuted his (sentence of maximum punishment) to imprisonment," said spokesman Abbas Mousavi.<br/><br/>"He was pardoned and despite having an open case... he was released," Mousavi added.<br/><br/>"For him to go there and lodge a complaint and for US courts to lavishly determine such figures" was a course of action that Iran "rejects", said Mousavi.<br/><br/>"This was a favor that the Islamic Republic of Iran did for him," he said, adding that he could have been kept behind bars and punished more severely.<br/><br/>Mousavi said Iran could itself take similar legal action against Washington, without elaborating.<br/><br/>According to AFP, Rezaian and three other US were released on January 16, 2016, the day the nuclear agreement entered into force.</p>
