      <p>We had reported Samsung’s upcoming Galaxy S11 smartphone could be powered by the Exynos 990 processor. Now, the Geekbench listing of the SM-G986B, which is the Galaxy S11 5G smartphone, confirmed that the Exynos 990 processor is what will power the smartphone. It has revealed information about the RAM too.</p>
      <p>According to the Geekbench listing, the 5G model will pack 12GB of RAM. However, we’re not sure whether or not the 5G variant will be the only model that comes with 12GB RAM option.</p>
      <p>Talking about storage, according to <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-galaxy-s11-5g-benchmark-reveals-exynos-990-12gb-of-ram/"><i>SamMobile</i></a>, the LTE variant of the S11 will be available only in two storage options, 128GB and 512GB, while the 5G variant will be available in three storage options and these include 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB.</p>
      <p>While none of us haven’t really got a chance to use the upcoming Galaxy S11 and, therefore, don’t know about the performance, the Geekbench 5 scores suggest that the S11 is going to be a very powerful device. The Galaxy S11 5G posted a single score of 427 and a multi-core score of 2326 on Geekbench.</p>
