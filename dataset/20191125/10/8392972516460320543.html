      <h1>Ant McPartlin and Dec Donnelly hit back as viewers claim I'm A Celebrity live trial was 'fixed'</h1>
      <h2>Some thought one of the challenges wasn't fair on the campmates</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T10:54:30+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 10:54</time> by <a rel="author">Rebecca Carter</a></address>
      <p>TV's <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/ant-mcpartlin/">Ant McPartlin</a> and <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/declan-donnelly/">Dec Donnelly</a> have hit back after <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/">I'm A Celebrity</a> viewers branded last night's live trial a "fix".</p>
      <p>James Haskell, Roman Kemp, Ian Wright, Caitlyn Jenner, Andrew Maxwell, Jacqueline Jossa and Adele Roberts took part in a <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/reality-tv/love-island/">Love Island</a> themed trial to win a roast dinner for each campmate.</p>
      <p>The stars managed to sail through each challenge until the final one which saw James and Roman lying in a bed filled with snakes.</p>

      <p>They had to try and unscrew three stars in the blue boxes, which were on James' side and filled with a crab, spiders and cockroaches, and move it to the corresponding yellow box on Roman's side, which were also filled with critters.</p>
      <p>The pair had just 90 seconds to try and get the final three stars but didn't manage to complete the task, meaning Ian, Cliff Parisi and Andy Whyment weren't going to be getting their roasts.</p>
      <p>Viewers were unimpressed with the challenge, with many saying it was "impossible" to complete in 90 seconds.</p>
      <p>One person said on Twitter: "Time on last task was totally ridiculous. Thought it was 90 sec per star not 90 sec altogether. Impossible."</p>

      <p>Another wrote: "Last part of the live trial was unfair and impossible. That doesn’t make good watching at all."</p>
      <p>A third tweeted: "Can we all start a petition for everyone to get a roast after that trial!!! No time to do the last trial and was so unfair! Impossible if you ask me!"</p>

      <p>Others branded the trial a "fix", with one viewer adding: "James and roman had no chance of completing that trial what a fix... you simply cannot tell me that was enough time to finish that trial."</p>
      <p>Another agreed: "Has to be a fix on that last trial @imacelebrity! You wouldn't get them stars done in 90 seconds if the boxes were empty let alone with a giant crab blocking you."</p>

      <p>One said: "There was no way anyone on this earth could have completed James &amp; Roman's trial in 90secs! Be fair and feed the last 3 will ya #ImACelebrity2019. Shouldn't have had less than 3 mins on that. (sic)"</p>
      <p>Ant and Dec replied on their joint Twitter page: "The stand ins did it when we tested it."</p>

      <p>Following the trial, James snapped at Dec who asked him: "That was unlucky. What was it James?"</p>
      <p>James hit back: "What was it? It was the very fact there was a giant crab in the way that you wanted me to carefully caress in a different direction as I tried to unscrew a star in its face."</p>
      <aside>The stand ins did it when we tested it.</aside>
      <p>Dec said: "Alright someone's getting prickly!"</p>
      <p>I'm A Celebrity continues tonight at 9pm on ITV.</p>
