      <p>FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. (AP) — Native American tribes in northern Arizona overwhelmingly oppose proposals to dam the Little Colorado River for hydropower.</p>
      <p>Phoenix-based Pumped Hydro Storage company is seeking preliminary permits from the federal government to study the sites east of Grand Canyon National Park.</p>
      <p>Company manager Steve Irwin has touted the potential economic benefits, including paved roads, tourism and jobs.</p>
      <p>The Navajo Nation owns the land and the projects won’t move forward without the tribe’s OK.</p>
      <p>The tribe wrote in comments posted online Monday that the projects could negatively impact the tribe’s land, water, wildlife and cultural resources.</p>
      <p>The Navajo community closest to the proposed projects already has asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to deny the permits.</p>
      <p>The Hopi, Hualapai and Havasupai tribes say they’re also concerned about the possible impacts.</p>
