      <p>While Umtiti has made 101 appearances at Camp Nou since leaving Lyon in 2016, the centre-back has found himself out of favour over the past 12 months.</p>
      <p>The likes of <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/arsenal/"><b>Arsenal</b></a> have been linked with an approach for the France international, although it appears that the 26-year-old may prefer a return to his homeland.</p>
      <p>When asked about his future plans, Umtiti told <i>Sport</i>: "I'd like to be a coach. I take notes from those I've worked under, their training sessions and what they do.</p>
      <p>"Returning to Lyon is a possibility, as a player or as a coach."</p>
      <p>Umtiti still has over three-and-a-half years remaining on his contract at the La Liga champions.</p>
