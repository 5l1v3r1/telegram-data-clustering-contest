      <h1>Frozen 3 Put on Ice for the Time Being</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T10:11:35+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 10:11</time> by <a rel="author">Val Gonzalez</a></address>
      <p>With a six-year gap between 2013's <i>Frozen</i> and the recently released <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/frozen-2/"><i>Frozen 2</i></a>, fans might be inclined to expect a similar gap for a future third film in the series. However, the wait might be even longer than that as the filmmakers involved have made it clear that there are currently no plans for another entry in the hit Disney franchise.</p>
      <p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2485516/will-we-see-a-frozen-3-heres-what-the-filmmakers-have-to-say">CinemaBlend</a>, producer Peter Del Vecho and writers/directors Jennifer Lee and Chris Buck expressed that <i>Frozen</i><i> 2</i> was written as the end of the tale of the royalty of Arendelle, a statement that's supported by the <a href="https://screenrant.com/frozen-2-movie-ending-explained-fifth-spirit/amp/">film's ending</a>.</p>

      <p>Nevertheless, Lee stated that, while the story told in both films feels complete to her, she doesn't want to rule anything out, adding somewhat jokingly that Buck requests to wait until next year to be asked about writing a third entry.</p>
      <p>The original <i>Frozen</i> was a smash hit, quickly becoming Disney’s highest-grossing animated feature of all time. Merchandise from the film sold incredibly well even after it left theaters,  and the song "Let it Go" garnered the film its second Academy Award.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, <i>Frozen 2</i> is already on its way to <a href="https://www.cbr.com/frozen-2-smashes-another-record-at-the-box-office/">surpassing its predecessor's success</a>, and given this track record of box office success, it's to imagine Disney gearing up for a third entry down the line. However, whether this means that Lee and Buck will be the ones to helm it remains to be seen.</p>
