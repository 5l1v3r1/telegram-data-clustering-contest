      <p>Two-time champion-jockey Donnacha O’Brien has announced his retirement from the saddle at 21.</p>
      <p>O’Brien, son of Ballydoyle supremo Aidan, is set to concentrate on a new career as a trainer.</p>
      <p>He amassed 10 Group 1 wins, most notably last year’s Dubai Duty Free Irish Derby on Latrobe, trained by his brother Joseph.</p>
      <p>He crowned a memorable career with a spectacular double on British Champions Day at Ascot last month.</p>
      <p>“Racing has been very good to me and I owe everything to the people around me, particularly my own family and the Magnier, Tabor and Smith families,” O’Brien said yesterday.</p>
      <p>“I look forward to training a small group of horses next year (at Longfield Stud, former base of David Wachman) and, will, hopefully, grow from there."</p>
