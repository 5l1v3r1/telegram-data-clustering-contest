      <p>Get your hands on the most affordable VR headset yet with Amazon unleashing their Black Friday Oculus Go deals. You can grab the 32GB model for just <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07D7HPSFC?th=1">£149</a> this week, with the larger 64GB version going for just <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07D7HL9KV?th=1">£199</a>. These headsets are usually £199 / £244 a pop so you're saving big by jumping on this deal early. There are plenty of <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/black-friday/amazon-black-friday-deals-2019">Amazon Black Friday deals</a> jumping around at the moment, so why not add this to your list? </p>
      <p>The Oculus Go headset is the all-in-one, wireless VR experience many have been dreaming of since first donning the heavily cumbersome Oculus Rift machine in 2016. Released in May of this year, the Go offers a lighter way to experience virtual reality without relying on a high spec gaming PC to load up your price tag this <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/black-friday/black-friday-deals-2019">Black Friday</a>. With the Go, anyone can experience high-quality virtual reality, bringing immersive movies and gaming to the masses at a fraction of the cost many associate with VR. </p>
      <p>Simply connect the 468g headset to your smartphone (no need to precariously wedge it inside the screen like other similarly priced headsets, the Go offers its own 2560 x 1440 LCD display) and you're in VR. Kitted out with a Snapdragon 821 processor, the Go isn't as powerful as a PC dependent headset, or the standalone Oculus Quest model, but is more than suitable for the immersive entertainment on offer through the Oculus app. </p>
      <p>Once the headset is connected, you can choose from a range of classic VR games as well as all your favorite entertainment platforms to stream from. The Go only offers a stripped-back version of the Oculus Quest / Rift app store, but for less than £200 there is a range of stellar experiences on offer. </p>
      <p>This Black Friday Oculus Go deal represents the perfect opportunity to dip your toe into the world of VR without the commitment of a pricey overhead. </p>
