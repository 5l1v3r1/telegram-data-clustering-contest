      <p>EFCC had arrested Mompha for alleged internet fraud and money laundering recently at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport in Abuja.</p>
      <p>The anti-graft agency made the disclosure in a series of tweets titled: “Alleged Internet fraud, Money Laundering: EFCC Arrests Ismaila Mustapha, a.k.a Mompha.</p>
      <p>Following the declaration in his arraignment, Mompha had on Thursday dragged EFCC before a High Court in Lagos State</p>
      <p>Mompha instituted a fundamental rights enforcement suit against EFCC for detaining him beyond the constitutionally stipulated days without charging him to court.</p>
      <p>In the suit filed by his lawyers, Gboyega Oyewole (SAN), Ademola Adefolaju, Kolawole Salami and four others, the businessman is demanding the sum of N5m as damages from the anti-graft agency.</p>
      <p>The self-acclaimed Bureau-De-Change operator also sought a court order directing the EFCC to release him unconditionally forthwith from its custody.</p>
      <p>Mompha is seeking an order of perpetual injunction restraining EFCC or any person whatsoever acting for or on behalf of the agency from arresting and detaining him in relation to the subject of the suit without recourse to due process of law.</p>
