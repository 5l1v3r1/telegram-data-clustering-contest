      <p>Robinson, who is known as Mo, appeared at the Old Bailey via video link from Belmarsh prison for a plea hearing.</p>
      <p>He spoke to confirm his identity and British nationality.</p>
      <p>During the hearing before Mr Justice Edis, he admitted conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration between May 1 2018 and October 24 2019.</p>
      <p>The charge states that he plotted with others to do "an act or series of acts which facilitated the commission of a breach of immigration law by various persons".</p>
