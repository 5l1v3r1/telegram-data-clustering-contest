      <p><b>Lyon,</b>  A zoo in central France said it found a runaway red panda on Saturday, a week after it escaped by scaling branches broken by snowfall.</p>
      <p>The zoological park in Saint-Martin-la-Plaine said a man discovered the endangered furry mammal in his garden.</p>
      <p>"We were called this morning around 8:15 am by a resident. He saw the red panda on a shrub in his garden," said park vet Dr Jean-Christophe Gerard in a statement.</p>
      <p>A team headed immediately to the site and recovered the red panda.</p>
      <p>"The little panda appears to be in good health and has not suffered from his stay outside the park, even if he is a bit thinner," Gerard said.</p>
      <p>The three-year-old male escaped from the park last Thursday, taking advantage of heavy snowfall that brought down trees.</p>
      <p>His female partner did not follow him out of the zoo.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, a driver spotted the animal some 10 kilometres (six miles) from the zoo but the police and zoo staff were unable to locate it.</p>
      <p>The shy creatures spend most of their time in trees and are not considered dangerous.</p>
      <p>Vets will be monitor the panda over the next few days to ensure his well-being.</p>
