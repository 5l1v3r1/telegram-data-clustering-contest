      <h2>Jacqueline Jossa admitted on last night's I'm A Celebrity that she'd "love" to do Love Island - despite being married to Dan Osborne</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T10:13:32+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 10:13</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Jacqueline Jossa dropped a bombshell on last night's I'm A Celebrity that will no doubt have husband <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/who-dan-osborne-towie-fame-13054898">Dan Osborne</a> in a bit of a tizz.</p>
      <p>The married ex-EastEnders star gasped excitedly as she and her fellow campmates walked on to the set for the live trial and made her announcement.</p>
      <p>Hosts Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly had taken a leaf out of ITV's other flagship programme Love Island's book, turning the jungle into a mini villa for the gruelling live task.</p>
      <p>And Jacqueline was the most excited to see the Love Island set - complete with hot tub, fire pit and kitchen - practically dancing on as the Caroline Flack-fronted show's theme music blared out.</p>

      <p>As she skipped in behind Roman Kemp, Jac shouted out: "WAHOO!"</p>
      <p>"Oh my god," she gasped as she took in the surroundings.</p>
      <p>"I've always wanted to do Love Island!"</p>
      <p>Ant laughed as she filed in behind the other campmates, telling Dec: "She's a big fan!"</p>

      <p>Jac's confession seemed to slip out after she notably removed her wedding ring from her left hand.</p>
      <p>While some of the celebs appear to be taking off their jewellery to do the tasks, plenty of them are still wearing their wedding bands in camp and in the Bush Telegraph.</p>
      <p>She was spotted without the distinctive ring on after her Bushtucker trial with Ian Wright, and again during last night's Love Island segment.</p>

      <p>Other stars have kept their wedding rings on inside the camp, including Andy Whyment - who is married to wife Nicola - and Cliff Parisi, who is with BBC producer Tara Wyer.</p>
      <p>It comes after Jacqueline's marriage with Dan was rocked in May 2018 when photos emerged of Dan looking incredibly close to Love Island star <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/gabby-allen-celebrity-big-brother-10781186">Gabby Allen</a> on a yacht off the coast of Spain while Jac was heavily pregnant back home in the UK.</p>
      <p>She and Dan temporarily split and he moved out of the family home, citing their "constant arguments" and tense atmosphere.</p>

      <p>While Dan denied the rumours of an affair and they reconciled, the pair soon saw their marriage rocked again when eight months later rumours emerged that Dan had locked lips with Love Island star Alexandra Cane on a wild night out.</p>
      <p>Although Dan rejected the fresh rumours, Gabby waded into the debate in March, telling the Sun that Jac "deserves better" amid the scandal.</p>
      <p>Awkwardly, one of Jacqueline's closest friends inside the I'm A Celeb camp is Gabby's ex Myles Stephenson, who called it quits with the Love Island star in August.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>A source told the Sun that Myles wouldn't shy away from discussing the Dan/Gabby situation with Jac.</p>
      <p>"Gabby and Myles discussed the whole Dan situation during their relationship, and even though both Dan and Gabby always denied anything went on between them, there are a lot of things that Jacqueline might not know," they said.</p>
      <p>"Myles would be willing to tell Jacqueline everything - and answer any questions she might have."</p>

      <p>Jacqueline and Dan have had many ups and downs in their relationship, with Dan telling new! magazine earlier this year that their marriage was plagued by a "negative energy".</p>
      <p>"I just want to be happy and I want Jac to be happy," the ex-TOWIE hunk said at the time, "Whether that's with me or not.</p>
      <p>"It's more like a really bad tension in the house and it's getting worse. We're losing our friendship. When I feel it's getting too much, I'll get out of the house and go to the gym or something."</p>
