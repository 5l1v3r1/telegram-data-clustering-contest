      <h1>The Walking Dead season 10 episode 8 might have revealed how entire series will end</h1>
      <h2>One moment from the latest outing might be revisited in the series finale</h2>

      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/the-walking-dead"><i>The Walking Dead</i></a> just aired its tenth mid-season finale, and it featured a moment that may have teased how the entire series will end.</p>
      <p>As well as setting up how Danai Gurira’s character Michonne <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/danai-gurira-the-walking-dead-exit-season-10-michonne-a8770956.html">will leave later this season</a>, the episode – titled  “The World Before” – was the first to be broadcast after reports seemed to reveal the AMC drama <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/the-walking-dead-end-date-final-season-12-10-amc-rick-grimes-a9207031.html">will end with season 12</a>.</p>
      <p>The moment occurred as Michonne, Judith (Cailey Fleming) and Luke (Dan Fogler) were heading to Oceanside.</p>
      <p>Luke can be heard singing and, when he tells the group it’s one of his favourite classical songs, Judith writes the title down in a notebook.</p>
      <p>When asked what she’s writing, Judith reveals she’s documenting everything that happens to them, so people in the future will know their story.</p>
      <p>It’s a brief moment, but one that hints at the legacy these characters are creating. Let’s not forget that Rick Grimes (<a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/walking-dead-movie-andrew-lincoln-rick-grimes-helicopter-trailer-release-date-a9013516.html">Andrew Lincoln</a>) is something of a legend among the younger members of Alexandria, Oceanside and Hilltop having “died” five years before.</p>
      <p>Finishing the show with either an old version of Judith recounting the events of the series, or indeed with someone else finding the notebook she’s seen writing in here, isn’t outside the realms of possibility.</p>
      <p><i>The Walking Dead</i> returns to AMC, Fox and NOW TV next February.</p>
