      <h1>Nottingham Playhouse panto Sleeping Beauty is 'simply superb' - review and photos</h1>
      <h2>'The Nottingham banter ran throughout'</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T10:20:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 10:20</time> by <a rel="author">Helen Barnes</a></address>
      <p>It’s beginning to look a lot like <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/christmas">Christmas</a>… and that means panto season is upon us. On entering the Nottingham Playhouse last night, festive tunes playing, we even got our first glimpse of Santa - the big bearded, red-suited guy was greeting each and every child with a complimentary chocolate coin and setting the scene for a truly magical evening.</p>
      <p>This year’s production, Sleeping Beauty, is as spectacular as one now comes to expect from the Playhouse. More intimate than some local venues, with maybe less high profile ‘celebs’ taking the lead roles, it’s a traditional family pantomime, but of the highest quality.</p>
      <h3>20 photos of Sleeping Beauty</h3>

      <p>We all know the classic fairy tale – a princess is cursed to sleep until her true love wakes her with a kiss – first penned by an Italian author, Giambattista Basile, in 1634. This, however, written and directed by Kenneth Alan Taylor, sees the evil Maleficent (Toyin Ayedun-Alase) cast a spell on Princess Rosalind (Maddie Harper) so again she will die by pricking her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel, but with Fairy Wisheart (Lisa Ambalavanar) using her powers to ensure she simply sleeps for a hundred years instead.</p>

      <p>In a twist from the original, the princess is sent to live in a little cottage for 21 years, to keep her away from danger and it is here that she meets the dashing Prince Alexander (Louise Dalton.)</p>
      <p>"Ey-up me ducks, don’t forget to turn off your mobile phones" we were reminded before the show started. The Nottingham banter ran throughout and each time raised a cheer.</p>
      <p>Audience participation kept the crowd fully engaged from the outset. The show is bursting with opportunities to shout "it’s behind you", to join in the catchy songs, even get up on stage if you’re brave enough.</p>

      <p>Opening the show was the delightful, Jerry the Jester (Tim Frater.) Knocking out some awesome breakdancing moves, he was an instant hit with the kids. With the most wonderful plug for the sponsors Nottingham City Transport during his long, exhausting walk to the cottage in the woods, he had the whole room in stitches. A brilliant, well written addition.</p>
      <p>Although it was without the usual innuendos that you come to expect from pantomimes these days, Sleeping Beauty is still incredibly funny throughout. Elkington is captivating. Everything he does or says results in huge cheers, claps and laughter. An impressive 20 plus changes of eye-catching costumes and with spontaneous improvisation with comments from the audience, he was an absolute joy to watch.</p>

      <p>The same can be said for Southworth, as the King. His giggles, his facial expressions, his dancing… he put in a sterling performance, which one could watch time and time again.</p>
      <p>The dance routines were slick. The presentation, flawless. The choice of songs, brilliant. We LOVED the George Ezra classic Shotgun – the choreography was wonderful.</p>
      <p>The energy the cast brought to the performance was astounding - so upbeat, so ‘feel good’, so clever. Impressive sets, fast changes and lots of up to date ‘quotes’, kept this a classic panto but with a very current feel.</p>

      <p>Our favourite part had to be the kitchen scene, where Nurse Tilly was using Alexa to help her cook Rabbit Pie. With the cutest, most endearing bunny imaginable, she had the audience literally howling with laughter, followed by screaming ‘NOOOOOOO!’ at the top of their voices – not wanting to spoil it, we will leave that for YOU to discover why!</p>
      <p>Charming, joyful, simply superb. What an opening night.</p>
      <p>This is a must see and will leave you feeling that Christmas has well and truly arrived.</p>
      <p>
