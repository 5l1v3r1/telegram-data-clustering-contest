      <p>According to him, after the scan was done, the film was withheld as is the practice for patients whose scan was done on credit.</p>
      <p>"<i>They'd release the film when patient pays. Being a young woman, her presenting symptoms weren't typical but my suspicions were strong &amp; to aid quick intervention, that CT film was necessary to know for sure,</i>" he said.</p>
      <p>Dean stated that he acted as surety and the film was released. He added that stroke diagnosis was confirmed and treatment started.</p>
      <p>The doctor revealed that after he stood surety for the patient, she fled the hospital the following day without paying the N45,000 bill.</p>
      <p><i>"This morning at about 10am I came out to check on the patient only for the nurses to inform me that she signed a discharge against medical advise form &amp; they had left," </i>he added.</p>
