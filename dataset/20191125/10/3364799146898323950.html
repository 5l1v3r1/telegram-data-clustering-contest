      <p>Shares of <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/ebay-stock?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest">eBay</a> surged as much as 6% Monday on news that it is nearing a deal to sell StubHub, its ticketing business, for $4 billion, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ebay-nears-deal-to-sell-stubhub-to-viagogo-for-roughly-4-billion-11574688756?mod=hp_lead_pos2">The Wall Street Journal reported citing people familiar with the matter</a>.</p>
      <p>The deal could close as early as <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ebay-nears-deal-to-sell-stubhub-to-viagogo-for-roughly-4-billion-11574688756?mod=hp_lead_pos2">Monday,</a> Cara Lombardo and Corrie Driebusch <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ebay-nears-deal-to-sell-stubhub-to-viagogo-for-roughly-4-billion-11574688756?mod=hp_lead_pos2">of The Journal reported</a>. EBay is in talks to make the sale to Viagogo Entertainment Inc., a Swiss ticket reseller, according to the report. </p>
      <p>The company purchased StubHub in 2007 for $310 million. In the third quarter this year, StubHub's revenue grew 5% to $306 million, eBay reported. That accounted for about 12% of eBay's $2.6 billion revenue in the quarter. </p>
      <p>If the deal is confirmed, it would bring StubHub back under the control of Eric Baker, one of its cofounders who is now the CEO at Viagogo. </p>
      <p>Pressure to sell StubHub started in January when <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/elliott-management-calls-for-ebay-to-shed-stubhub-classified-ads-business-11548166204?mod=article_inline">activist investors Starboard Value and Elliott Management</a> began to persuade eBay to sell its ticketing and classified ads businesses, The Journal reported. </p>
      <p>In February, both activist investors won seats on eBay's board as part of a settlement, according to the report. Elliott said eBay could sell StubHub for between $3.5 billion and $4.5 billion, and its classified businesses for $8 billion to $12 billion, The Journal reported. </p>
      <p>Ebay has been working to strategically pick <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ebay-exec-why-stopped-competing-with-amazon-2019-11?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest">its battles with Amazon and lean on its strengths as a resource for small business owners</a> and independent sellers, Business Insider's Bethany Biron reported. </p>
      <p>Ebay is up <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/ebay-stock?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest">25% year-to-date through Friday's close</a>.</p>
