      <p>Honda has taken the wraps off its new City (which we know here in South Africa as the Ballade) in Thailand, with the sedan now offered with a turbocharged petrol engine.</p>
      <p>Yes, the Japanese firm says the new Ballade draws its urge from a turbocharged 1,0-litre three-cylinder VTEC unit, offering the front wheels some 90 kW and 173 N.m (the latter between 2 000 and 4 500 r/min).</p>
      <p>Honda claims the new engine – which is again mated with a continuously variable transmission (there's no mention of a manual gearbox in the press material) – provides “superior” performance to the outgoing naturally aspirated 1,5-litre four-cylinder powerplant, which in SA generates 88 kW and 145 N.m.</p>
      <p>The company says the new model features a “more premium yet sportier look”, adding that a more aggressively styled RS variant will be sold in Thailand. The new model measures some 113 mm longer and 53 mm wider than its forebear.</p>
      <p>Inside, Honda promises “unprecedented” ergonomics along with a “more spacious cabin” that incorporates an eight-inch touchscreen. In Thailand, the newcomer ships standard with six airbags, ABS with EBD, vehicle stability assist, hill-start assist and a reversing camera.</p>
      <p>While local specifications (and, indeed, engine options) have yet to be confirmed, we expect the new Ballade to arrive in South Africa at some point in 2020.</p>
