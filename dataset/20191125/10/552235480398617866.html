      <h1>Ferry chaos after Celtic match as dozens of fans escorted off boat by police</h1>
      <h2>The supporters were booted off following the incident in Cairnryan Port, Dumfries and Galloway, on Saturday night.</h2>

      <p>A group of around 40 people, thought to be <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> fans, were escorted off a ferry heading to Belfast after staff raised concerns about their 'unacceptable' behaviour.</p>
      <p>The supporters were booted off the boat following the incident in Cairnryan Port, <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/galloway">Dumfries and Galloway</a> , on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>Three were subsequently arrested and given "recorded <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/police">police</a> warnings", <a href="https://www.belfastlive.co.uk/news/belfast-news/stena-line-ferry-belfast-delayed-17309331">Belfast Live reports.</a></p>
      <p>It is believed that the group were returning to Northern Ireland after attending a <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> match earlier in the day.</p>
      <p>All 40 were allowed to continue their journey home on the early morning sailing from Cairnryan to Belfast on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Footage circulating on social media shows a group of men wearing Celtic tops being confronted by Police officers on board a ferry.</p>
      <p>Officers and security staff appear to be breaking up a fight which had broken out between rowdy passengers.</p>

      <p>A Stena Line spokesperson said they do not tolerate staff or customer abuse.</p>
      <p>They added: "Following an unacceptable level of behaviour from football fans onboard the Stena Line vessel due to depart Cairnryan at 11pm on Sat 23rd November to Belfast, the Captain called police in Cairnryan for assistance to escort the group off the ship before sailing.</p>
      <p>"Stena Line has a zero tolerance policy when it comes to staff or customer abuse and will refuse travel to anyone who contravenes this policy thus ensuring the safety and comfort of its passengers and crew."</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/police-scotland">Police Scotland</a> said: "About 40 people were escorted from the 2300 hours ferry at the request of the captain because of their behaviour. Three were arrested for public order offences.</p>
      <p>"All 40 later sailed on the 0600 hours ferry on Sunday morning without issue."</p>
