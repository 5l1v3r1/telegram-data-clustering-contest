      <p>While some may have thought Frozen 2 wouldn’t live up to the hype created by its predecessor, turns out it’s well and truly frozen the competition.</p>
      <p>In fact, it’s gone and done better than the original <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/disney/">Disney</a> film, which was released in 2013.</p>
      <p>According to<a href="https://www.comscore.com/Insights/Rankings#tab_worldwide_box_office/"> figures from Comscore</a>, domestically in the US Frozen 2 took in $127million (£98m) and $223m (£173m) overseas in its opening weekend, making a $350m (£271m) dent in the pockets of parents around the world.</p>

      <p>In turn, it has now become the biggest ever opening for a Disney film. Which says something…because #Disney.</p>
      <p>It absolutely scorched the competition and froze them out of the running for the top spot at the same time with Le Mans 66 (AKA Ford v Ferrari) driven into second place after taking $16m(£12m) during its second week in cinemas.</p>

      <p>Tom Hanks was in the charts in third with his latest film A Beautiful Day In The Neighborhood, which earned $13.5m (£10.4m) – chump change compared to Frozen 2.</p>
      <p>Back when it was released, Frozen took over theatres when it made a total of $1.27billion (£98bn) at the global box office, but collected $93m (£72m) in its opening days, much lower than its follow-up.</p>
      <p>It became a worldwide phenomenon with kids around the world singing Let It Go on repeat, terrorising parents who cursed the good name of princess Elsa (Idina Menzel) and her sister Anna (Kristen Bell). Don’t even get them started on Olaf (Josh Gad).</p>

      <p>Who knew we were still gasping, grasping, thirsty for another tale in the Frozen world?</p>
      <p>The second one follows the return of Anna and Elsa, as well as Kristoff (<a href="https://ew.com/movies/2019/11/24/jonathan-groff-frozen-2-song/">Jonathan Groff</a>), and Olaf as they leave Arendelle to travel to the ancient forest of an enchanted land in a quest to discover the origin of Elsa’s powers – in order to save their kingdom.</p>
      <p>Of course.</p>

      <p>Naturally.</p>
      <p>What else would they be doing?</p>
      <p>Frozen 2 may have got a leaping head start on its big sister, but the OG went on to win two Oscars; one for best animated feature and one for Let It Go, which won best original song.</p>
      <p>First stop, monetary glory, second stop, all the awards.</p>
