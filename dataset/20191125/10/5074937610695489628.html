      <h1>HOTCASS holds speech and prize giving day</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T10:13:29+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 10:13</time> by <a rel="author">Benjamin Adamafio Commey, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Accra, Nov. 24, GNA - Professor Neils Benjamin Quashie, a Research Fellow and Lecturer at the University of Ghana Medical School, has called on students to take advantage of the technology to increase their knowledge base.</p>
      <p>He said accessing information was much easier today with the increase in technology, adding that it is important that students exploit such an advantage to acquire the best of knowledge that would propel them to greater heights.</p>
      <p>He was speaking as a guest of honour at the 50th anniversary and Speech and Prize Giving Day of the Holy Trinity Cathedral Senior High School (HOTCASS) in Accra.</p>
      <p> The event was held under the theme: “HOTCASS at 50: The impact of christian education on the community.”</p>
      <p> Professor Quashie said “technology has placed knowledge in our hands and that anywhere we find ourselves we have access to any information without necessarily visiting the library. Let us all as students take advantage of things of this era to increase our knowledge.”</p>
      <p>Touching on the importance of education, Professor Quashie who is also the Director of the Centre for Tropical, Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics at Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital, said it is necessary that every community is well-informed and educated.</p>
      <p>He commended government for taking the bold step in implementing its Free Senior High School policy and appealed for the expansion of facilities at all tertiary institutions to enable them to accommodate the huge number of students.</p>
      <p>“Reports indicate an over 40 per cent increase in enrolment since the inception of the free SHS and this is a good feat. However, providing free SHS without creating an avenue for continuation of their education thereafter would be very much dangerous.</p>
      <p>“I appeal to government to seriously tackle the looming dangers by expanding facilities in the tertiary institutions and recruit more lecturers to handle the expected increase in demand for tertiary education,” the lecturer said.</p>
      <p>While commending the management of HOTCASS for its enormous contribution to education in the country, the Professor who is also an old student of the school, urged them to take steps to address the congestion situation that has plagued the school in order to guarantee the safety of students.</p>
      <p>HOTCASS, which was founded in 1969 currently has a student population of nearly 2,200.</p>
      <p>It currently offers four major social science programmes namely General Arts, Science, Visual Arts and Home Economics.</p>
      <p>Mr William Dompreh Adjaye, the Headmaster, said though a lot has been achieved over the years there is still the need for collaborative efforts between stakeholders to ensure improved academic performance.</p>
      <p>He commended government and old students of the school for their continual support towards the betterment of the school. </p>
      <p>Mr Edwin Nii Lante Vanderpuije, the Member of Parliament for the area, commended the school for the impact it has made towards the betterment of the lives of people in the community despite its challenging environment.</p>
      <p>He urged the management to use the occasion to make a thorough assessment in order to ensure that it addressed its shortcomings over the years.</p>
      <p>He assured the school of his support, especially in the area of infrastructure in order to enhance teaching and learning.  </p>
