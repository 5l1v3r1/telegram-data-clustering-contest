      <p>In the wake of <b><a href="https://www.racingpost.com/news/phoenix/phoenix-thoroughbreds-founder-accused-of-stealing-eur100m-from-global-ponzi-scam/410788?utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_campaign=RP%20-%20News&amp;utm_content=-Phoenix%20Thoroughbreds&amp;utm_term=Null">a Sunday report by Europe’s Racing Post</a></b> that connected Amer Abdulaziz, head of the worldwide ownership group Phoenix Thoroughbreds, to a money laundering scheme associated with a fake cryptocurrency, the group responded with a statement Monday saying it “categorically denies all allegations.”</p>
      <p>The Racing Post cited testimony in the U.S. trial of Mark Scott, a lawyer found guilty of money laundering via the international cryptocurrency scam known as OneCoin. Konstantin Ignatov, OneCoin’s co-founder caught up in what was termed a Ponzi scheme, said during his testimony that Abdulaziz was “one of the main money-launderers.”</p>
      <p>“Amer Abdulaziz, after he stole 100 (million euros) from OneCoin, he started buying racehorses for, like, 25 (million euros),” Ignatov said, according to the Racing Post. Ignatov said the alleged theft wasn’t reported because “the money came from a criminal activity.”</p>
      <p>Funds were reportedly transferred from an Irish bank to the United Arab Emirates in the spring of 2017, coinciding with Phoenix’s entry into the equine sales market. Abdulaziz has billed Phoenix as a Thoroughbred investment fund, with the group’s website saying its vision is “to breed top class horses to race for our investors and trade as necessary to secure a profit, as well as a lot of fun along the way.”</p>
      <p>According to Monday’s statement, Phoenix Thoroughbreds “believes that the firm and Mr. Amer Abdulaziz have acted according to the law at all times, and will vigorously contest all allegations of wrongdoing. Phoenix Fund Investments LLC will fully cooperate with relevant authorities should they require any assistance.”</p>
      <p>Phoenix, which has campaigned, among others, the Dubai World Cup runner-up Gronkowski in a short but star-studded run on the racetrack, “is currently seeking legal advice and will take appropriate action against those involved in the publication of false and defamatory statements.”</p>
      <p>Ray Paulick, publisher of Paulick Report, <b><a href="https://www.paulickreport.com/news/ray-s-paddock/phoenix-thoroughbreds-founder-and-ceo-named-in-money-laundering-case/">detailed a federal complaint last March</a></b> upon Ignatov's arrest at the Los Angeles airport. In it, a June 2018 message from Ignatov to a OneCoin employee was cited. It was a photo of Abdulaziz at the Royal Ascot meeting, and Ignatov says Abdulaziz was "having fun with our $."</p>
      <p>Abdulaziz has not been charged with a crime, and the FBI told the Racing Post is “neither confirms nor denies” an interest in him.</p>
