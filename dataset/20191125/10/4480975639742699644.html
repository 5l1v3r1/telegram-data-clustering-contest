      <p>The USD/CAD pair lacked any firm directional bias and seesawed between tepid gains/minor losses through the early European session on Monday.</p>
      <p>A combination of diverging forces failed to provide any meaningful impetus or assist the pair to build on Friday's goodish intraday positive move of around 45 pips and led to a subdued/range-bound price action on the first day of a new trading week.</p>
      <h3>Bulls await a fresh catalyst</h3>
      <p>The US dollar remained well supported by Friday's mostly upbeat US economic data and a modest pickup in the US Treasury bond yields. This coupled with some renewed hopes of a possible US-China trade deal extended some support to the major.</p>
      <p>In the latest trade-related developments, the US President Donald Trump said on Friday that a deal with China was “potentially very close” and further indicated that he might not sign a bill passed by the Congress that supports Hong Kong.</p>
      <p>The positive factor, to a larger extent, was negated by a mildly positive tone surrounding oil prices, which underpinned demand for the commodity-linked currency – <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/currencies/usdcad">loonie</a> and kept a lid on any strong positive move for the major, at least for the time being.</p>
      <p>Even from a technical perspective, the pair last week failed near a 5-1/2-month-old descending trend-line <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/support-resistance">resistance</a>, albeit has managed to hold its neck above the very important 200-day SMA, warranting some caution before placing any aggressive directional bets.</p>
