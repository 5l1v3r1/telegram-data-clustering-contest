        <b>UBER has today lost its licence to operate in London for the second time in as many years.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The firm now faces being banned from the capital over a "pattern of failures", including putting passengers safety at risk.</p>
      <p>A Transport for London spokesman said: "Despite addressing some of these issues, TfL does not have confidence that similar issues will not reoccur in the future, which has led it to conclude that the company is not fit and proper at this time."</p>
      <p>Uber can appeal the decision and was previously blocked from London in September 2017.</p>
