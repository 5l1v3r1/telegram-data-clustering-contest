      <h1>Pitso: The Trophy Is In Chloorkop!</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T10:41:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 10:41</time> by <a rel="author">Soccer Laduma</a></address>
      <p>Mamelodi Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane has played down the club’s recent slump and argued that the Brazilians are still very much on course to defend their Absa Premiership title this season despite trailing log leaders Kaizer Chiefs by 10 points.</p>
      <p>There were concerns about Downs’ form when they recently suffered two defeats in their three league games, one of them coming against Amakhosi.</p>

      </p>
      <p>But Mosimane’s men got back to winning ways at the weekend when they beat Golden Arrows, another side that had got the better of them in a league fixture, and booked their place in the final of the Telkom Knockout on December 14.</p>
      <p>Downs will face Maritzburg United, who beat Chiefs yesterday afternoon.  </p>
      <p>“Sundowns go through this every year, we wobble a little bit. It’s either two draws and one loss, or two losses and one draw. You can never become a bad team overnight. How many times have we proved we are at this level? It’s just that we were not winning the last three games and people make a lot of noise,” Mosimane told reporters.</p>
      <p>In what sounded a dig at log Chiefs, the coach reiterated that the championship trophy remained at their headquarters and nowhere else as things stand.    </p>
      <p>“At this point in time, who has the league title? It’s us. We have the league title, it’s in Chloorkop. No one has it. And we are defending it. All this other noise, it’s a good noise, but where’s the trophy? It’s in Chloorkop. The other one (MTN8) is at SuperSport, they are all in Tshwane. Those are the last two trophies. It’s how you finish. You can start very well and look very good and promising and say ‘this is the year’. Let’s talk in May, not now. That is the way it is,” Mosimane said.</p>
