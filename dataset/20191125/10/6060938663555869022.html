      <h1>George Bailey all set to be Australia's new national selector</h1>

      <p>MELBOURNE: Former limited-overs captain <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/George-Bailey">George Bailey</a> is set to be Australia's new selector after he was picked to be a part of the national selection panel alongside coach <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Justin-Langer">Justin Langer</a> and chairman <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Trevor-Hohns">Trevor Hohns</a>.</p>
      <p>Bailey, 37, is still an active cricketer and plies his trade in the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Big-Bash-League">Big Bash League</a> for <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Hobart-Hurricanes">Hobart Hurricanes</a> and in the Sheffield Shield for Tasmania.</p>
      <p>According to a report in 'The Sydney Morning Herald' and 'The Age', Bailey will not be the first active cricketer to be a national selector.</p>
      <p>In the past Don Bradman and Michael Clarke have enjoyed the post while still being the captain of the national team.</p>
      <p>Bailey, who has represented Australia in five Tests, 90 ODIs and 30 T20Is, is yet to call it quits from the game.</p>
      <p>Asked about the necessity of a new selector, Cricket Australia head of national teams Ben Oliver said he was "really pleased with the people who put their hat in the ring for that role".</p>
      <p>"There will be some people who are really disappointed no doubt but they should all take great encouragement and they all have a lot to offer," he said.</p>
      <p>Although it is believed that CA is showing keen interest in Bailey because of his vast knowledge of the white-ball formats as a player, especially with next year's Twenty20 World Cup at home round the corner, Oliver said the new selector would also be involved in selecting squads for Test matches.</p>
      <p>"The panel, and all three, will be responsible for all Australian men's teams," Oliver said.</p>
      <p>"What we've tried to achieve in this recruitment process is adding in some complementary skills to support Trevor and Justin and one of those is a consideration around short-format cricket."</p>
