      <h1>Elon Musk makes Rick and Morty cameo and now his Twitter alter ego makes sense</h1>

      <p>It finally makes sense why <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/elon-musk/">Elon Musk</a> changed his name to ‘Elon Tusk’ on Twitter earlier this year and the answer lies in his recent <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/rick-and-morty/">Rick and Morty</a> cameo.</p>
      <p>The 48-year-old co-founder and CEO of Tesla appeared on season four, episode three of the hit cartoon, entitled One Crew Over the Crewcoo’s Morty.</p>
      <p>He played, you guessed it, Elon Tusk – basically exactly like Elon Musk, but with tusks.</p>
      <p>Warning: Spoilers ahead!</p>
      <p>During the episode, Rick and Morty surprise Elon at his company headquarters, aptly titled Tuskla.</p>
      <p>Morty hurriedly told Elon: ‘Listen, we need your help!’</p>

      <p>Then Mr Tusk replied: ‘Rick, Morty – why me? Did something happen to Elon Musk in your own reality?’</p>

      <p>He went on to explain Elon Tusk and Elon Musk ‘aren’t opposites’, one just has tusks.</p>
      <p>The rest of the episode sees the team complete a series of random tasks, like Elon taking out a turkey from the oven and putting it in the fridge, as well as playing Minecraft.</p>
      <p>Probably easier to explain if you just watch the episode…</p>

      <p>Back in February, the billionaire <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/02/28/elon-musk-changes-name-twitter-prepares-reveal-big-tesla-news-8778827/">mysteriously changed his Twitter name to Elon Tusk</a>, complete with an elephant emoji and now we know why.</p>
      <p>At the time, fans speculated the alter ego (which, of course, used the initials ET) had something to do with aliens.</p>
      <p>And they were kinda right.</p>
      <p>People also had a hunch the name change could have had something to do with Fleetwood Mac’s twelfth studio album, Tusk.</p>
      <p>Alas, that guess was way off.</p>
