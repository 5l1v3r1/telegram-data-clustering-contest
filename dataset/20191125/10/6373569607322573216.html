      <p>We know that it can be difficult finding a new legal advisor, and one you trust, if the solicitor who has acted for you, and/or your family for many years, retires or ceases trading suddenly.</p>
      <p>Equally, it can be very overwhelming choosing a lawyer if you have never had a need to instruct one before.</p>
      <p>Plymouth Live thought it would be helpful to guide readers as they make one of the biggest decisions of their lives.</p>
      <p>Here, we set out the service which Wolferstans’ Wills and Probate Team offer all clients, whether new or existing. Wolferstans is a major Plymouth law firm with a history going back to 1812 so you can safely say that you are in capable hands.</p>

      <p><b>2.</b><b>Communication </b>– Solicitors usually meet with clients face to face on at least one occasion and keep in regular contact with them during the legal process. Straight forward language is used and they communicate clearly and effectively.</p>
      <p><b>3. Experience and technical ability</b> - Wolferstans is proud to have solicitors in the team who are members of Society for Trust and Estate Practitioners (STEP) and Solicitors for the Elderly (SFE). Wolferstans is accredited under the Law Society’s Wills and Inheritance Quality Scheme.</p>
      <p>There are members of the Wills and Probate Team who have received specialist training to be able to advise clients who are bereaved, as well as assist clients who have been diagnosed with dementia. Impressively, Wolferstans has been practising in Wills, Trusts and Probate for over 200 years!</p>
      <p><b>4. Regular reviews </b>- The team at Wolferstans writes to clients every two years offering free Will reviews and appreciates that clients’ circumstances can change and that there may be changes in the law that need to be brought to their attention.</p>
      <p><b>5.</b><b>Storage of documents</b> – The firm stores clients’ Wills, Powers of Attorney and Property Deeds free of charge and feels that you should not be paying for this service and are confident that documents will be stored safely and securely until such a time as they might be required.</p>
      <p>Wolferstans also offers clients the option to have their Will registered with the National Will Register; this is a service which offers peace of mind to many clients.</p>
      <p>The firm can help new clients retrieve their documents and deeds from their previous solicitor. If the previous solicitor is no longer trading, then it can try and help locate the important paperwork and documents.</p>
