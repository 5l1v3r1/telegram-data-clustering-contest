      <p>JOHANNESBURG, Nov 25 (Reuters) - South African farmers are expected to sow 2.8% fewer hectares of the food staple maize next season than forecast in October after the planting season was delayed by rains, a Reuters survey of analysts showed.</p>
      <p>Farmers are expected to sow 2.45 million hectares of maize for the 2019/2020 season, compared to 2.519 million estimated last month, a Reuters poll of four traders and market analysts showed.</p>
      <p>For the 2018/2019 season, the harvest is expected to be 12.244 million tonnes, 8.6% higher than its October estimate of 11.186 million tonnes, reflecting progress in the harvest.</p>
      <p>The government's Crop Estimates Committee (CEC) will give its final forecast of the year on Tuesday on what it plans to plant for the 2019/20 maize growing season.</p>
      <p>"Although rains were delayed at the onset of the 2019/20 summer crop season, the situation has since improved, which encouraged farmers to plant," said Paul Makhube, senior agricultural economist at FNB.</p>
      <p>The poll sees the 2018/19 harvest consisting of 5.61 million tonnes of the food staple white maize, and 6.52 million tonnes of yellow maize, which is used mainly in animal feed.</p>
      <p>Some analysts also said that they are expecting early deliveries to be lower due to the later planting season. (Reporting By Naledi Mashishi; Editing by Jan Harvey)</p>
