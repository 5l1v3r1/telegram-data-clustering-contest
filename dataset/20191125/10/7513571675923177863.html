        <b>The Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria has declared a two-day “prayer of warfare” against the conference on witchcraft being organised by the University of Nigeria, Nsukka (UNN).</b>
      </p>
      <p>In a statement on Sunday, Godwin Madu, chairman of PFN in Enugu, also called for the cancellation of the conference which he described as “sponsoring evil”.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thecable.ng/extra-unn-to-host-conference-on-witchcraft"><b>TheCable reported</b></a> that the event being organised by the B.I.C Ijomah Centre for Policy and Research in UNN, will take place between November 26 and November 27.</p>
      <p>But Madu said it does not “give God glory,” asking Christians to pray against it.</p>
      <p>“We cannot fold our arms and watch our future dragged into what will not give God glory,” he said in the statement.</p>
      <p>“To this end, the Church in Enugu has declared a two-day prayer of warfare. We must not allow this at a time like this, as we have had enough of ungodly activities in the country already. The Church should pray against those sponsoring evil in the state.”</p>
      <p>He said Enugu state is “in the hands of God,” adding: “We will not hand it over to witches.”</p>
      <p>“So, all Christians should, without further delay, call on the God of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and the awesome God of David to fight for his name,” he said.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thecable.ng/unn-belongs-to-jesus-students-kick-against-conference-on-witchcraft"><b>TheCable also reported</b></a> that some students of the university rejected the conference through online campaigns and protest posters.</p>
      <p>But the organisers told TheCable the event is a mere academic exercise “to interrogate the various things people think is witchcraft,” and not a “gathering of witches” as is being alleged.</p>
