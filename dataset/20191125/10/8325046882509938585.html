      <p><a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/uber-stock">Uber’s</a> stock is set to sink on Monday morning after the ride-hailing firm <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/uber-loses-london-licence-2019-11?r=US&amp;amp;IR=T">lost its license to operate within London</a>.</p>
      <p>The stock fell 6.3% in premarket trading, at 10:30 a.m. in London (5:30 a.m. ET), after Transport for London said it found a “pattern of failures” which put the safety of passengers in the city at risk.</p>
      <p>The stock drop would wipe $3 billion off the $50.4 billion market cap Uber closed with on Friday.</p>
      <p>Tfl said that it found 14,000 trips had been conducted by unauthorized drivers that were using approved Uber driver accounts to pick up passengers.</p>
      <p>Uber has about 21 days to appeal the decision, and in a statement emailed to Business Insider, it said that it plans to appeal, calling Tfl’s decision, “extraordinary and wrong.”</p>
