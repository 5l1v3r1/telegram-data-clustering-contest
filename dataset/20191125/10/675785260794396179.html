      <h1>Rennes 'name their price' for Man Utd transfer target Eduardo Camavinga</h1>
      <h2>Camavinga has been linked with a move to Manchester United, with under-pressure boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer keen to bolster his midfield ranks</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T10:23:17+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 10:23</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Maltby, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matt-maltby/</a></address>
      <p>Rennes have reportedly slapped a £43million price tag on highly-rated midfielder Eduardo Camavinga.</p>
      <p>Angolan-born Frenchman Camavinga has been linked with a move to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> , with under-pressure boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer keen to bolster his midfield ranks.</p>
      <p>Camavinga only turned 17 earlier this month but is seen as one of Europe's hottest properties - with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fc-barcelona">Barcelona</a> , <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> , <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> , Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund and Atletico Madrid also tracking the teenager.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> also reportedly had bids turned down, according to L'Equipe, which would have seen him return to Rennes on a two-year loan.</p>

      <p>And the French outlet has now claimed, via <a href="https://en.as.com/en/2019/11/24/football/1574603031_356017.html">Spanish daily AS</a> , that the Ligue 1 side have slapped a €50million (£43m) price tag on the highly-rated midfielder.</p>
      <p>That is despite the fact that Rennes president Olivier Letang has been credited with placing a price tag of €70m (£59m) on his young star.</p>
      <p>And the French club's chief recently claimed that he is preparing for talks with in-demand star Camavinga at the end of the season.</p>

      <p>“If it only depended on me, I would like to keep him for another 10 years. Aside from that, there are approaches, a market and the desires of the player.</p>
      <p>"We will meet to discuss it a little later on. Probably at the end of the season."</p>
      <p>Camavinga is a highly rated defensive midfielder who became the youngest ever assist maker when he setup a goal against Paris Saint-Germain earlier this season.</p>

      <p>Rennes boss Julien Stephan said of Camavinga's performance against PSG back in August: "He played a very interesting match, indeed, like the whole team.</p>
      <p>"We are talking to him. He is someone who is also very intellectually gifted, who knows how to question himself, who knows how to ask the right questions."</p>
      <p>Camavinga, who currently plays in the French Under 21 side, was born in Angola and moved to France aged two and so can represent either country, as well as the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p>
