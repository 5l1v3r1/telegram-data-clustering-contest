      <p>The crew of 20 Syrians and one Lebanese were rescued, according to Ana-Maria Stoica, a spokeswoman for the rescue services.</p>
      <p>Rescuers supported by the military, police and divers tried on Sunday to right the Palau-flagged ship and pull it to the port, she said.</p>
      <p>According to Romania's Digi24 online newspaper, the losses were estimated at three million Romanian lei (nearly $700,000).</p>
      <p>Romania's main livestock breeder and exporter association, ACEBOP, called for an urgent investigation.</p>
      <p>"Our association is shocked by the disaster," Mary Pana, ACEBOP president, said in a statement. "If we cannot protect livestock during long-distance transports, we should outright ban them."</p>

      <p>Gabriel Paun of NGO Animals International alleged the ship had been overloaded. He added that the Queen Hind was known to have engine problems as early as last December.</p>
      <p>"An investigation must be opened without delay," he told AFP news agency.</p>
      <p>Romania, which joined the European Union in 2007, is one of its poorest members.</p>
      <p>It is the bloc's third-largest sheep breeder, after the United Kingdom and Spain, and a top exporter, primarily to Middle Eastern markets.</p>
      <p>Activists have labelled the livestock transport vessels - about 100 of which leave Midia every year - "death ships", saying sheep risk being cooked alive on board during the hot summer months.</p>
      <p>In July, Vytenis Andriukaitis, then European commissioner in charge of health and food safety, demanded that Bucharest stop the transport of 70,000 sheep to the Gulf, citing animal welfare.</p>
      <p>He has asked the European Commission to investigate Romania's practices.</p>
