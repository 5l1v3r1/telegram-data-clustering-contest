      <p>Yuva Samrat Naga Chaitanya celebrated his Birthday, a couple of days ago. Naga Chaitanya went on a holiday with his wife <a href="https://www.mirchi9.com/movienews/samantha-might-prove-upper-hand-against-prabhas/">Samantha</a> to celebrate the eve. Meanwhile, favorite hero’s Birthdays are always a celebration for fans. However, Sagar, an Akkineni fan from Bobbili decided to celebrate it differently.</p>
      <p>He had a darshan of the deity at the famous Simhachalam Temple by climbing the steps on his knees. Some fans tagged Samantha to the video. However, Samantha’s response to it has drawn criticism. “Thankyou … this is incredible .. speechless 🙏 please meet us 🙏🤗 (sic),” she tweeted.</p>
      <p>The response did evoke anger from the netizens. Many termed the act of the fan as senseless and Samantha supporting such an act did not go well with them. “Samantha should have encouraged fans to do something productive other than this mindless act. This kind of response will only prompt more fans to do such mindless acts,” a netizen opined.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, the fan who trekked the hill on knees prayed to Lord to bless Naga Chaitanya and Samantha with a baby boy very soon.</p>
