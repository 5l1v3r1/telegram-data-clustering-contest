      <p>Amazon has the Razer Phone 2 on sale ahead of <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/best-cell-phone-deals">Black Friday</a> for just $299. The Razer Phone 2 won't be any cheaper on Black Friday so now is the time to get one.</p>
      <p>The regular price on the Razer Phone 2 (recently) has been $399. So it's not a very steep discount – still about 25-percent though – but definitely worth taking advantage of.</p>
      <p>The Razer Phone 2 is a gaming smartphone. Though it was released over a year ago, so the specs are a bit out of date, but still very usable. Since Razer used the latest specs available at the time, the Razer Phone 2 is still very capable.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>It sports a 5.7-inch Quad HD+ 120Hz display, powered by the Snapdragon 845 chipset, with 8GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. That's not a lot of storage, but at least this phone isn't $800 still, like the Google Pixel 4.</p>
      <p>Unlike some of the newer gaming phones, this one is an LCD display, instead of an OLED display. It also has a higher refresh-rate than most of the other gaming phones. Coming in at 120Hz. There are many games that are available right now that do support this higher refresh-rate too. So you can really take advantage of it.</p>
      <p>Razer also outfitted this phone with dual front-facing stereo speakers. These do support Dolby Atmos. Making it a really great multimedia device.</p>

      <p>The bezels are still quite large on the Razer Phone 2. Part of the reasoning for this was to make it easier to hold when gaming, and they wanted it to stay at 16:9, since almost all games support that natively. And not the taller 18:9 or even 21:9 aspect ratio.</p>
      <p>The Razer Phone 2 is available unlocked and will work on AT&amp;T and T-Mobile in the US.</p>
      <p>You can pick up the unlocked Razer Phone 2 from Amazon right now <a href="https://geni.us/KoeDKd">by clicking here.</a></p>
