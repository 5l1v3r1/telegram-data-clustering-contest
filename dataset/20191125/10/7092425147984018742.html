      <h1>United fans slam Ed Woodward after pic of him 'arguing' with Alex Ferguson</h1>

        <b>Manchester United executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward isn't exactly the most popular figure with the club's supporters.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Since Alex Ferguson and former CEO David Gill retired in 2013, the club has suffered an alarming slide.</p>
      <p>Woodward has become a figure of blame in United's demise as he's presided over a number of failed managerial appointments and botched transfers.</p>
      <p>While he's more than capable in terms of the business side of things, noodle partners don't quite match up to the feeling of winning trophies.</p>
      <p>In contrast, Ferguson is a club legend whose reputation is pretty much untouchable.</p>
      <p>With this in mind, a photo of the pair in heated discussion in the stands during <a href="https://cms.buzz.ie/sport/man-utd-player-ratings-sheffield-united-344083"><i>United's 3-3 draw with Sheffield</i></a> yesterday has not gone down well.</p>
      <p>The picture in question appears to show Woodward shouting at Ferguson and it has not gone down well with fans.</p>

      <p>In fairness, the picture may have only captured a moment as Woodward and Ferguson were also pictured looking friendly.</p>
      <p>Another photo shows the Scot with his head in his hand afterwards.</p>

      <p>Either way, the reaction represents the frustration of the club's supporters at the moment.</p>
      <p>The draw at Bramall Lane leaves United in ninth place and 20 points off leaders Liverpool after only 13 games.</p>
      <p>United have insisted Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's job is safe but pressure is likely to mount on the Norwegian if results don't improve quickly, especially with Mauricio Pochettino available.</p>
      <p>The Argentine was reportedly Ferguson's recommendation to replace Jose Mourinho at Old Trafford.</p>
