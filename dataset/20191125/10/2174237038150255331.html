      <p>The <i>Seconds Out + More!</i> tour will visit some of the same venues Genesis played on that 1977 tour. There will also be additional material, including Hackett's solo concert favourite <i>The Steppes</i> to celebrate the 40th birthday of his fourth solo album <i>Defector</i>.</p>
      <p>Hackett says: “I’m thrilled to bring <i>Seconds Out</i> back to life, featuring Genesis material at its most exciting and virtuosic, this time with all numbers played in full plus additional surprises."</p>
      <p><i>Seconds Out</i> was the hugely successful double album recorded on Genesis’ 1977 concert tour together with <i>The Cinema Show</i>, from their 1976 tour, and featured Hackett on guitar alongside <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/genesiss-mike-rutherford-on-hits-hellish-school-and-being-uncool">Mike Rutherford</a>, <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/tony-banks-investing-in-banks">Tony Banks</a> and <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/a-genesis-reunion-phil-collins-most-revealing-interview-yet">Phil Collins</a>, who had taken on the role of vocalist, following the departure of <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/the-top-10-best-peter-gabriel-songs">Peter Gabriel</a>. </p>
      <p>The tour included music from each of the six studio albums from Hackett's time in Genesis and marked his final recordings with the band as he left to pursue his solo career upon its completion. <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/news/genesis-live-album-seconds-out-to-get-new-vinyl-reissue">The album was reissued on half-speed mastered vinyl earlier this year</a>.</p>
