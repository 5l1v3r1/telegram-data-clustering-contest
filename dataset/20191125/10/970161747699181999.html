      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/brexit/">Brexit</a> is the issue dominating the election, with millions of voters heading to the polls on December 12 in the hope of finding a solution to the crisis that has divided the country for the last three years.</p>
      <p>
        <b>So where do the main parties stand on Brexit?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Conservatives</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/boris-johnson/">Boris Johnson</a> has repeatedly promised to deliver Brexit, despite failing to deliver on his do or die pledge to get Brexit done on October 31.</p>
      <p>At the Conservative Party manifesto launch in Telford yesterday, the prime minister pledged once more to ‘get Brexit done’ and ‘forge a new Britain’.</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson has repeatedly made clear his intention to leave the EU as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>He has vowed to bring back his Brexit deal to Parliament before Christmas if the Tories win the general election.</p>

      <p>It means the prime minister’s Withdrawal Agreement Bill, which passed its first hurdle in the House of Commons by 329 votes to 299, but was pulled by MPs who refused to rush it through, will return before the Commons just days after the election.</p>

        <b>Labour</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Labour party has gone into the election, promising to get Brexit done within six months.</p>
      <p>The party has pledged to renegotiate Mr Johnson’s deal with the EU before putting it back to the public in a second Brexit referendum.</p>
      <p>Labour says it will negotiate a deal which would involve a customs union with the EU, a close relationship with the European single market and protection for environmental and workplace safeguards.</p>

      <p>Jeremy Corbyn has also revealed in recent days that he would remain ‘neutral’ if such a referendum were to take place, which he claims would be a ‘sign of strength and maturity’.</p>
      <p>According to John McDonnell Labour MPs and members of a Corbyn government would be free to campaign on either side of any such referendum, which the party plans for June 2020 if it wins the election.</p>
      <p>Labour has previously said it would hold a special conference in the spring to decide which side it will back in the referendum, but the shadow chancellor’s comments suggest that MPs would be free to choose which side they campaign on.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Liberal Democrats</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Liberal Democrats are committed to cancelling Brexit, should they win the election on December 12.</p>
      <p>Party leader Jo Swinson has previously said: ‘We will do all we can to fight for our place in Europe, and to stop Brexit altogether.’</p>

      <p>In the event the party fails to secure a majority, it is committed to a second referendum, in which it would support an option to Remain in the EU.</p>

      <p>The Liberal Democrats have also promised a £50 billion remain bonus, money that will be found by cancelling Brexit, which it says it would invest in public services.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Green Party</b>
      </p>
      <p>In its manifesto, the Green Party has made clear it wants a second referendum in which it would campaign to remain in the EU.</p>

      <p>It says that the referendum was a radical rejection of the status quo, and it would ‘make staying and fighting for the Europe we want a pathway to change’.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Brexit Party</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Brexit Party says it wants to leave the EU without a deal.</p>

      <p>He has promised to deliver a ‘clean break Brexit’ with no extension of the transition period.</p>
