      <h1>The First ‘I’m A Celebrity’ Clue Is Here And If It’s Not Lindsay Lohan, We Riot</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T10:00:08+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 10:00</time> by <a rel="author">By Louis Hanson</a></address>
      <p>From the beaches of Mykonos to the swamps of the jungle, <b>Lindsay Lohan</b> is rumoured to be the first contestant on the sixth season of <i>I’m a Celebrity…Get Me Out of Here!</i> I literally just wee’d a little. Ms Lohan has that effect on me.</p>
      <p><i>I’m a Celebrity </i>just released their first contestant teaser video and, to be honest, it genuinely looks like it’s going to be Former Cady™.</p>
      <p>Let’s unpack the clues and you’ll see what I mean.</p>
      <p>Contestant numéro uno is described as a “television megastar” (tick), an “international party animal” (tick, shot, tick) and apparently likes to prove their critics wrong (a valiant tick). Oh, and it’s a her (HI, HOW ARE YA, GENDER?!)</p>
      <p>Also, given that she’s just <a href="https://www.pedestrian.tv/film-tv/lindsay-lohan-masked-singer-finale/">finished her stint on the <i>Masked Singer</i></a> – another Channel 10 production – it wouldn’t be a stretch to assume that she’d continue on with the network.</p>
      <p>I’m fucking adamant that’s it’s going to be her, okay? No one shit on my dream.</p>

      <p>Check out the official teaser below, and start sharpening your pitch forks in case it turns out not to be Ms LiLo. In the meantime, stream ‘Xanax’ for clear skin.</p>

      <p>To be honest, any day I get to write about Ms Lindsay Lohan is a stunning day… so I’m in a great mood.</p>
