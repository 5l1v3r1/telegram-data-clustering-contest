      <h1>French ministry sets 5G starting price at €2.2B</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T10:13:53+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 10:13</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.mobileworldlive.com/meet-the-team/#chrisdonkin" target="_blank">Chris Donkin</a></address>
      <p>French authorities plan to sell each operator in the country 50MHz of 5G spectrum for €350 million and then auction a further 11 lots with a minimum price of €70 million apiece, a high-ranking politician told <i>Les Echos</i>.</p>
      <p>Speaking days after regulator Arcep <a href="https://www.mobileworldlive.com/featured-content/top-three/french-regulator-unveils-5g-sale-proposal/">confirmed the terms of the sale</a>, the country’s secretary of state to the minister of economy and finance Agnes Pannier-Runacher (<i>pictured</i>) called the proposed sums “reasonable”.</p>
      <p>However, in an interview with <i>Le Figaro </i>last week Arcep president Sebastien Soriano said the minimum price for the complete allocation should be set at the much lower rate of €1.5 billion.</p>
      <p>The final decision on the price of the sale sits with the government, with Arcep only asked to provide recommendations.</p>
      <p>Under the plan existing mobile operators will be allowed to buy a licence for 50MHz of 5G suitable spectrum for €350 million in return for agreeing to commitments around coverage and availability. The remaining 110MHz on offer will be put forward to the auction.</p>
      <p>During her interview, Pannier-Runacher said the fixed price was set at a “very attractive” price, noting in the <a href="https://www.mobileworldlive.com/featured-content/home-banner/operators-scathing-over-german-5g-auction-outcome/">German 5G spectrum auction</a> operators had to pay twice as much for the same amount. She added the coverage commitments would be “much more ambitious than in other countries”.</p>
      <p>Assuming the rules are approved as they stand, the auction is expected to take place in April 2020, with commercial launches slated to swiftly follow.</p>
