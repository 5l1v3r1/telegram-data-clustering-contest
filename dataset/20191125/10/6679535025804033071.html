      <p>The Delhi Police Special Cell has averted a terror strike by arresting three persons with improvised explosive devices (IED) in Assam, a police officer said on Monday.</p>
      <p>The suspects, identified as Ranjeet Ali, Islam, and Jamaal are believed to be influenced by the Islamic State (IS).</p>
      <p>The Delhi Police said they got inputs on the movement of several suspected persons of an IS module in the city. Their target was a religious congregation.</p>
      <p>“We were carrying out major search operations across the city for the last two weeks after we got inputs from intelligence agencies,” said the police officer. A team of the Special Cell was sent to Assam.</p>
      <p>“They were arrested from Goalpara area. They had planned a blast in Delhi. But before that they almost planted a bomb at the Dudhnoi Rasleela mela in Assam as a rehearsal,” said Pramod Kushwah, DCP (Special Cell).</p>
      <p>They were about to execute their plan today, the last day of Dudhnoi Rasleela festival, but it was averted, Mr. Kushwah added.</p>
      <p>The IEDs recovered from them were similar to the one used in the March 7, 2017 <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/four-injured-in-blast-in-bhopalujjain-passenger-train/article17422081.ece">Bhopal-Ujjain passenger train blast </a>that injured eight persons near the Jabdi station in Madhya Pradesh.</p>
      <p>Hours after the incident, three terror suspects each were arrested in Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh, and Saifullah, a suspect holed up in a building in Lucknow, was killed after an encounter that lasted several hours.</p>
