      <h3>THE House of Representatives has approved on final reading the 3rd package of the comprehensive tax reform program of the administration.</h3>
      <p>House Bill 4664 or the Valuation Reform Bill got 224 affirmative votes, seven negative and one abstension.</p>
      <p>The bill seeks to reform the government’s  property valuation and assessment system which  is expected to provide additional revenues of P30.5 billion.</p>
      <p>Albay Rep. Joey Salceda, chairman of the House Committee on Ways and Means, is the principal author of the bill.</p>
      <p>According to Salceda, the measure will enable LGUs to achieve stable financial resources and a strengthened local real property tax base to fund service delivery requirements of the LGUs toward transparent governance and increased public performance.</p>
      <p>The VRB aims to improve real property valuation of government by adopting a single market-based schedule market value (SMV) -- a table of base unit values for all kinds of real properties within an LGU prepared by assessors -- to be used as basis of local and national real property taxation.</p>
      <p>It also seeks to address the perennial problems in real property valuation attributed to failure of LGUs to update their SMVs that leads to values not reflective of real market.</p>
      <p>The House leader added that the measure will benefit not just the LGUs but also the national government in terms of valuation of right-of-way acquisitions.</p>
