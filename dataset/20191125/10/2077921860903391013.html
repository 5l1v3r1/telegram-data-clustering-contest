      <h1>The 80 Best Horror Movies on Amazon Prime Right Now</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T10:14:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 10:14</time> by <a rel="author">Jim Vorel and Paste Movies Staff  </a></address>
      <p>After drawing up huge rankings of the <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2019/06/best-horror-movies-on-netflix.html">best horror movies on Netflix</a> and the <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2018/04/the-30-best-horror-movies-on-hulu.html">best horror movies on Hulu,</a> it’s safe to say we’ve gotten used to the challenge of diving through the refuse of a streaming service and searching for the gems. But we’ve never really experienced a library with just as much junk in it as the Amazon library. If you’ve been paying attention, then you know this is only compounded by the fact that the “browse” function on Amazon Video is <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2018/02/amazon-prime-videos-browse-function-is-completely.html">completely and utterly broken.</a></p>
      <p>That said, Amazon subscribers also have access to a wealth of riches, many of them hiding in plain sight. Slowly but surely, they’ve built what is truly the biggest and most comprehensive horror library of all the major services—there’s really no question now that they’ve surpassed <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/tag/Netflix">Netflix</a>, Hulu and all other streamers except for genre-specific services like Shudder. The trick is realizing those movies are there at all. Sure, it’s no surprise that <i>Hereditary</i> or <i>A Quiet Place</i> are now on the service, given their still recent releases. But did you know <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/tag/Amazon+Prime">Amazon Prime</a> was loaded with classic Italian <i>giallo</i> movies like <i>Deep Red</i>, <i>Opera</i> and <i>Blood and Black Lace</i>? Or werewolf classics like <i>Dog Soldiers</i> and <i>Ginger Snaps</i>? Or more 1980s slashers than you can wave a machete at? There are all sorts of great movies here, which have made us expand the scope of this list all the way to 80.</p>
      <p>Therefore, fall back on our list of films that are worth your time for one reason or another—just don’t expect to find them via browsing, when something like <i>Carrie</i> only shows up when you’re 30 pages deep.</p>

On first inspection it simply looks like a rip-off of Hitchcock’s <i>The Birds</i>, but in reality it’s so much worse and more fascinating than that. The parallels to <i>The Room</i> are extremely accurate: Like Tommy Wiseau’s famously inept film, <i>Birdemic</i> is the product of a single, deranged mind, that of the Vietnamese-born would-be auteur James Nguyen, whose non-native writing fills the dialog with mind-bending absurdities and a pathetically sincere attempt at an ecological message. The actors seem to be people that Nguyen scooped off the street moments before shooting began, completely wooden and unsure of where they are or how they got here. Technical gaffes abound. And when the birds <i>finally</i> show up, the film is graced by some of the most gut-bustingly hilarious FX of all time—clip-art birds that flutter in place, suspended in mid-air while the heroes swipe at them with coat hangers. This is all in <i>Birdemic</i>. You need to see <i>Birdemic</i>. But please, I’m warning you: Ignore Nguyen’s self-aware attempt to follow up on the film with <i>Birdemic 2: The Resurrection</i>. The magic, unsurprisingly, is gone. — <i>Jim Vorel</i></p>

It’s immediately obvious that this profane, smutty horror-comedy about a killer turkey is “bad on purpose,” but at the same time it displays incompetence both intentional and unintentional. The performers, especially the leads, are bad in ways that no amount of coaching could ever help, but that turkey … his one-liners are somehow just crass enough to often be side-splitting. Made for a mere $3,500, it’s a clear case where a writer-director’s cleverness is on an entirely different level from the poor souls he was able to scrape together to make his film, and the effect is an endearingly weird mix of repulsion and charm. Enjoy it for what it is, but by all means, avoid the horrendous, shark-jumping sequel, <i>Thankskilling 3</i>. If you’re wondering about that title, it’s because the series skipped right over <i>Thankskilling 2</i>. Trust me, it’s not as clever as it sounds. <i>—Jim Vorel</i></p>

Outside of star Bela Lugosi, the acting is pretty atrocious, but it’s a film that horror purists need to check off their lists at some point simply due to its influence and importance to the genre as the first-ever “zombie film.” Zombies, of course, had a very different connotation in the pre-George Romero world—these are Haitian voodoo zombies, Lugosi their spellbinding ringleader with the hypnotic eyes. This was in an age before subtlety had arrived in horror, so the name of Lugosi’s character is literally “Murder,” and he spends most of the film mucking about in the affairs of an engaged couple, zombifying the woman in the process to become his slave. It’s only 67 minutes long, so what do you have to lose? If you end up watching <i>Revolt of the Zombies</i>, <i>King of the Zombies</i> and <i>I Walked with a Zombie</i> afterward, I swear off all responsibility. —<i>Jim Vorel</i></p>

This is a competent adaptation of the classic short story from author Clive Barker’s <i>Books of Blood</i>, concerning an investigative photographer who stumbles onto a series of serial killings that seem to occur in New York City’s subway system. Soon he’s tailing the killer, an effectively blank and stone-faced Vinnie Jones, through atmospheric subway set-pieces as he tries to figure out why this guy is hanging late-night subway passengers from meathooks. Featuring strong performances that bolster a simple premise, <i>The Midnight Meat Train</i> takes a last-minute left turn into inanity, but that’s on Barker more than director Kitamura. You might find the conclusion a little absurd, but it’s a ride worth taking, especially as part of a <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/tag/Bradley+Cooper">Bradley Cooper</a> retrospective. —<i>Jim Vorel</i></p>

Pierce<br/>The original version of <i>The Town That Dreaded Sundown</i> feels like a strange outlier among other proto-slashers, thanks to its insistence on marketing itself as a dramatization of a true story. This it does with surprising fealty in many ways: Its depiction of a string of murders in 1946 Texas is actually pretty accurate to the historical record, but that accuracy sometimes comes at the cost of a complete narrative. As in reality, the killer is never caught, and the film never deigns to speculate as toward his identity or true motivations—it’s the rare slasher film that is largely depicted from the perspective of the police trying to catch the killer, rather than the killer’s motley crew of victims, an embryonic version of <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/tag/David+Fincher">David Fincher</a>’s <i>Zodiac</i>. As a result, there’s an exploitative edge to <i>The Town That Dreaded Sundown</i>, and it’s unsurprising that the film offended family members of the people who had been killed, especially with its claim that the killer “still lurks the streets of Texarkana.” Still, perhaps they were right. In the end, this film is a gritty, sober, almost depressive slice of rural bloodthirstiness that raises more questions than it answers. (We should note that there is one extremely goofy kill, involving a trombone, that seems much more slasher-esque than the others.) —<i>Jim Vorel</i></p>

In truth, there wasn’t all that much that was special about this movie, outside of some good makeup and a memorable design for its killer, Victor Crowley, ably brought to life by former Jason Voorhees portrayer Kane Hodder. The story, certainly is simple as slasher premises come: A bunch of idiots venture out into the swamp and get picked off one by one by the hulking, deformed Crowley. Notable today mostly just for a few good kills (the skull-ripping one is still both excellent and gross), <i>Hatchet</i> didn’t quite retain its buzz, but it’s a serviceable modern slasher. —<i>Jim Vorel</i></p>

It’s shot in grainy, low-budget black and white, of the kind that typified Corman’s horror comedies such as <i>A Bucket of Blood</i> in the same era, but it’s got an earnest goofiness that survives through it all. Seymour Krelboyne (Jonathan Hayes) is one of cinema’s great nebbishes, but you can’t help but root for the guy on some level, even as he’s manipulated to commit murders in service of a blood-drinking plant. And of course, the film is also filled with easter eggs, from the appearance of classic Corman bit player Dick Miller (of <i>Gremlins</i> and <i>Terminator</i>) to the weirdo performance turned in by a very young <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/tag/Jack+Nicholson">Jack Nicholson</a> as a masochistic dental patient.

With that said, you could argue that simply producing a ghost story this traditional in 2012 offered a bit of novelty. <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/tag/Daniel+Radcliffe">Daniel Radcliffe</a>, fresh off his final <i><a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/tag/Harry+Potter">Harry Potter</a></i> appearance, took a role playing “an adult” as Arthur Kipps, a Victorian era lawyer who travels to the country to negotiate the sale of a house that is revealed to be haunted by the spirit of the Woman in Black. This CGI specter has a particular fondness for targeting children, and the film becomes a mystery in the “placate this restless spirit and set her free” mold. It offers a few fun twists and turns, and evokes classic British haunted house movies as Radcliffe stalks through dark, cobwebbed rooms with a flaming candelabra to light his way. The ending is a bit derivative of <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/tag/Sam+Raimi">Sam Raimi</a>’s <i>Drag Me to Hell</i>, but all in all this is a better-than-average, classical ghost story. <i>—Jim Vorel</i></p>

Others were merely content to copy-cat the conventions of other films and let the bodies fall where they may. <i>Final Exam</i> falls mostly into the latter camp—the filmmakers were literally instructed to produce <i>Halloween</i>, except on a college campus, and this is the result. Still, there are a few little idiosyncrasies that make it more memorable than some of the other <i>Halloween</i> or <i><a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/tag/Friday+the+13th">Friday the 13th</a></i> clones. Most notable is the killer himself, who is presented as a completely unknown, rampaging force to whom motive (or even identity!) is never ascribed. The anonymous, seemingly unmotivated nature of the threat makes it easier to sympathize with the college kids, rather than simply rooting for their voyeuristic deaths, as becomes common the longer the slasher genre is around. It’s a minor entry in the “death stalks campus” genre that also includes such films as <i>Happy Death Day</i>, <i>The House on Sorority Row</i> and <i>Graduation Day</i>. —<i>Jim Vorel</i></p>

The film focuses on a cult in a fictional Gatlin, Nebraska, led by child preacher Isaac, who is convinced by an entity called He Who Walks Behind the Rows that all adults over 18 should get the axe. We see Burt and Vicky (played by Peter Horton and Linda Hamilton) struggle to escape the small town after driving through and hitting a young, dying boy with their car. There’s plenty of slasher scares and creepy visuals, but like any good horror movie, it’s a commentary on <i>society</i>, man, and like <i>Lord of the Flies</i> before it, this Stephen King-based story looks toward our kids to point out the oddities of our culture (including an obsession with religion). —<i>Tyler Kane</i></p>

As in, solar radiation somehow causes every animal above 5,000 feet of elevation to go insane, attacking anything in their path. A group of hikers are menaced by all kinds of animals—mountain lions, bears, birds of prey and even pet dogs. Leslie Nielsen, five years before his career-altering comedic turn in <i>Airplane!</i>, appears as the primary human villain, channeling a bit of his <i>Creepshow</i> character from the early ’80s. It’s sort of an ugly film to watch today, but if you’ve always wanted to see a shirtless Leslie Nielsen fight a bear, it’s really your only option. Regardless, of all the films on this list, it’s the one I’d most like to see remade with a big budget.

It’s simply not that expensive to apply zombie makeup and have an actor chew on some fake guts. Likewise with the found footage genre—ever since <i>Paranormal Activity</i> and Romero’s own <i>Diary of the Dead</i> in 2007, there have been dozens if not hundreds of cheap, found-footage zombie films. <i>Mulberry Street</i>, on the other hand, doesn’t lean on the found footage crutch, but it <i>does</i> look exceedingly low-budget. Still, this first feature film of capable horror director Jim Mickle (<i>Stake Land</i>, <i>We Are What We Are</i>) feels confident and far deeper than it has to be. Depicting what is essentially a street-level zombie epidemic in downtown Manhattan, it’s like a zombie film as made by an impoverished Robert Altman, weaving together the stories of various apartment dwellers as their lives come crashing down. There have been plenty of urban zombie movies, but this one captures the feeling of powerlessness that an “average person” would truly feel during such an event, completely cut off from any kind of information on what is happening, not to mention <i>why</i> it’s happening. Of every film on this list, <i>Mulberry Street</i> might well capture the most “realistic” zombie panic, the sort of event that must have happened prior to the beginning of the events in <i><a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/tag/The+Walking+Dead">The Walking Dead</a></i>. The only downside is that it looks like a film made for $60,000, but in the vein of <i>Evil Dead 2</i>, it would be cool to see Mickle remake it one day with a real budget. —<i>Jim Vorel</i></p>

In actuality, this camp-set story was essentially going to <i>be</i> an adaptation of the same source material as <i>The Burning</i>, that of the New York “Cropsey” urban legend, before the (much better) film by Tony Maylam beat them to the punch. And lo, we got <i>Madman</i> instead, wherein Cropsey is replaced by the revenant of “Madman Marz,” a murderer who survived hanging and still stalks the woods located conveniently next to the camp for gifted children. This film is exactly what you expect it to be, full of red herrings and drawn-out stalk-and-slash killings. You could throw this on any night of the week and it would immediately feel comfortably familiar to any golden era slasher fan.

It’s ambitious but somewhat messy, a story about a family that undergoes a traumatic, fracturing event and its fallout over the course of 30 years. The eventual revelation of the twist pushes the story into more of a “sci-fi horror” direction, and feels somewhat inspired by the prime-era films of M. Night Shyamalan in execution. The film simply isn’t quite as profound as it would like to think it is, and the visual fidelity holds back its “cinematic” quality slightly, but it gets the most out of a strong central performance from its lead. If you get on a South American horror kick, you’ll end up watching it eventually. <i>—Jim Vorel</i></p>

Equal parts <i>Psycho</i>, <i>Carrie</i> and <i>Halloween</i>, its central character/antagonist is a man who suffered long-running and traumatic abuse at the hands of his Norma Bates-esque mother, and lashes out at the world with fire as his preferred weapon to purify the world of evil. Some of its kills are particularly grisly, including graphic depictions of young women being burnt alive, and one imagines it was these sequences that partially inspired the fake trailer for <i>Don’t</i>, which ran in between segments of Rodriguez/Tarantino’s <i>Grindhouse</i>. Today, <i>Don’t Go in the House</i> stands as a minor grindhouse classic that appeals to the viewer with a somewhat misanthropic streak. —<i>Jim Vorel</i></p>

Rather, it was a joint British/Spanish production simply aping the Hammer formula of classy actors in silly premises. This one is particularly weird: An archaeologist played by Lee discovers a “missing link” ape man buried in ice and tries to transport him in secret via train. The still-alive ape man defrosts, however, and proves to be armed with a rather unique set of powers. What follows is a bizarre film about stolen memories and brain-swapping, all taking place aboard the train. There are some really hypnotic performances, especially from relatively unknown Argentinean actor Alberto de Mendoza as a crazed priest. Telly Savalas, TV’s Kojak, even shows up out of right field playing a Russian Cossack officer, sans the usual lollipop. Who loves ya, baby? —<i>Jim Vorel</i></p>

There’s a who’s-who of B-movie actor staples as well: Ray Wise, Eric Roberts, Richard Riehle, Lin Shaye, Kane Hodder and more.

Zombies!!</a></b> <br/><b>Year:</b> 2007<br/><b>Director:</b> Matthew Kohnen<br/>There’s no escaping that in the post-<i>Shaun of the Dead</i> era, indie zombie comedies piled up like so many bodies at the morgue after a zombie outbreak. Many of them are terrible, but occasionally you do get one like <i>Aaah! Zombies!</i> that is a pleasant surprise. The film uses a similar “told from the zombie’s point of view” structure to what you see in <i>Colin</i>, but with a clever, comedic twist: The zombies are conscious and unaware that they’re zombies. Rather, a group of slacker friends believe that they’ve become “super soliders” thanks to a confused military private who’s also become zombified. This is achieved through differing perspectives: When we see things from the zombies’ point of view, the film is colorized and their dialog is audible. When we see things from the perspective of human characters, the film is black-and-white, and the zombies are lumbering and uncoordinated. Our zombies, then, are something like unreliable narrators—we mostly see from their perspective, but we’re quickly made aware that their perspective is incorrect, which is the main source of humor. I’m making this film sound a bit more cerebral than it actually is, though—what one should expect from <i>Aaah! Zombies!</i> is simply some over-the-top slapstick humor, cartoonish zombie violence and silly character actor cameos. It gets a decent amount of mileage and laughs out of a decidedly indie budget. <i>—Jim Vorel</i></p>

Lost in the mix, thanks to all the blood and guts, was an appreciation for the things this stalk-and-slash thriller does well, and the nigh-inexcusable nature of its famously frustrating ending. Suffice to say, <i>Haute Tension</i> is wildly uneven from the get-go. Its sequences of the protagonist hiding from the killer, including one in an abandoned highway rest stop, are extremely well executed and brimming with suspense, but it can be difficult to appreciate them once arriving at an absurd denouement that seriously strains the mind’s ability to turn mental backflips in rationalizing it. The film demonstrated the artistic flair that would go on to make the films of Alexandre Aja into notable visual feasts, but your ultimate assessment of it will very much be decided by your opinion on the conclusion.

In fact, Brown originally wrote the film as an early parody of the genre, playing off the tropes established by <i>Halloween</i> and <i><a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/tag/Friday+the+13th">Friday the 13th</a></i>, but the movie was ultimately filmed as a legitimate horror vehicle instead, leaving it in a unique tonal middle ground that retains a fair amount of black comedy. As a result, it’s a trope-laden film that sees the denizens of the titular slumber party stalked by an escaped maniac (always a popular option, when you don’t want to write a killer’s backstory) armed with a power drill, à la 1979’s <i>The Driller Killer</i>. Ironically, despite being intended as parody, the film ended up establishing a number of “slumber party” horror movie tropes itself, the residuals of which echoed through the slasher genre for a decade to come. It’s also unusual in the sense that it has more than one character who could properly be labeled as a “final girl,” allowing for some tandem offense against the killer. —<i>Jim Vorel</i></p>

It’s the documentary-style story of a haunted house crew that picks a decidedly wrong location for their attraction, and boom—they all wind up dead. Very standard set-up for a “no one gets out alive” entry in the found footage genre, but <i>Hell House LLC</i> actually does have some inspiring scares and performances. It gets a whole lot out of very small set-ups and deliveries, such as the shifting positioning of props and the life-size (and appropriately horrifying) clown costumes, shooting scenes in what looks very much like “real time,” with no cuts. There’s a naturalistic air to the actors’ sense of frustration and unease as weird events start to mount, but of course it all goes quite off the deep end and into unintentional humor in the closing moments. Still, there are many islands of genuine, blood pressure-raising fear in this well-executed film.

In the case of <i>The Gate</i>, that sentence would be something like “A boy and his friend find a hole in the backyard that is actually a gate to hell.” And that’s really all there is to <i>The Gate</i>, a charming exercise in <i>Poltergeist</i>-esque haunted house tropes and <i>Goonies</i>-like child protagonists. It’s one of those films where simply describing the plot on paper makes it sound fairly intense (the family dog gets killed, among other things), but the whole thing is presented with an aloof sense of sarcastic detachment, like a lost work from Joe Dante. Suffice to say, we are not meant to take anything in <i>The Gate</i> seriously, and are free to simply enjoy some of the timeless effects work, which includes some very impressive stop-motion animation miniatures. There have been rumors of a modern remake of <i>The Gate</i>, and in an era that is still venerating 1980s pop culture, this is hardly surprising.

Naturally, they adapt it into a garage rock song, and soon enough, the neighborhood is abuzz with gore-heavy scenes of demonic possession. The humor is crude, and not quite as funny as it thinks it is, but the horror scenes are fun, and <i>Deathgasm</i> never drags.

A word to the wise: <i>The Toxic Avenger</i> isn’t for consumption by those without a strong stomach, although you could say that about most any of Troma’s classics. Their films aren’t so much “bottom of the barrel” or “lowest common denominator” as they are <i>sub-denominatorial</i>, reveling in their own poor taste and crassness, simultaneously parodying themselves and their own violent, sexual and scatological excesses.

The entire cast of the original return, along with the first film’s screenwriters, but lost are the dynamic direction of Tobe Hooper and the overseeing eye of <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/tag/Steven+Spielberg">Steven Spielberg</a>, which strips it of a bit of its verve. Still, you can’t fault this sequel for being boring—if anything, <i>Poltergeist II</i> is even weirder and more zany than the original, which wasn’t exactly shy about being off the wall. The infusion of native American mysticism into the sequel is a bit of an odd touch, to the point that you can almost empathize with Craig T. Nelson’s constant doubting and bemoaning of his lot in life, but it’s the <i>faces</i> of this film that really leave a lasting impression. In particular, character actor Julian Beck is haunting as the film’s antagonist, the Rev. Henry Kane, his taut skin and ghoulish features being only amplified by the fact that Beck was tragically wasting away from cancer in real life during filming. The evidence of his passing, like that of child star Heather O’Rourke during <i>Poltergeist III</i>, continue to cast a shadow of unease over the series to this day.

Killer doll, very cheesy, plenty of one-liners, right? Well yes, and no. The original (and pretty obviously best) entry in the <i>Child’s Play</i> series is the most serious-minded (at least slightly) and grounded of the movies, and it goes out of its way to humanize its iconic killer Chucky—or the spirit within him, that of serial killer Charles Lee Ray—more than one might expect. If you’ve never seen a film in the series, ask yourself this: Did you know that the plot of <i>Child’s Play</i> is technically all about voodoo? Because it is. In the end, though, its greatness and inherent watchability boils down to the charms of the wonderful Brad Dourif, who found in Chucky the vessel he needed to become a genre legend forevermore. Like Robert Englund did with Freddy Krueger, Chucky becomes the most beloved aspect of the series because Dourif’s voiceover just oozes charisma and character—he’s more alive than any of the flesh-and-blood characters in this series could ever be.

It’s the story of a troop of Russian soldiers in the waning days of WWII, infiltrating a German compound that turns out to be the testing grounds for a Frankenstein-descendent mad scientist. When his undead soldier creations come to life, the Russian soldiers end up fighting for their lives. Plot and performances are essentially unimportant—what ends up being extremely impressive here are the fabulously grisly monster designs, practical effects and inventiveness in staging found footage action sequences.

Such is <i>City of the Living Dead</i>, and such is almost everything in the filmography of Lucio Fulci. Never a director with the critical acclaim or heightened stature of a Dario Argento, Fulci was instead prolific, making his name in 1979 with the greatest of the Italian zombie films, <i>Zombi 2</i>. <i>City of the Living Dead</i> is considered the first in a so-called “Gates of Hell” trilogy, alongside two of his other best-known works, <i>The Beyond</i> and <i>The House by the Cemetery</i>. Like many of the Italian films it’s set in the U.S.A., which creates a strange, otherworldly quality given the international cast and dubbed dialog. It follows a young woman and her friends, who travel from New York to the Lovecraft-inspired town of Dunwich, where the suicide of a corrupted priest is causing the dead to rise from their graves and strike out at the living. It’s almost more a series of vignettes and unrelated scenes than a straightforward narrative, as residents of the town are killed at random by the zombies. That’s just how Fulci rolls. You don’t watch Lucio Fulci movies for plot; you watch them for atmosphere and stylish splatter. — <i>Jim Vorel</i></p>
