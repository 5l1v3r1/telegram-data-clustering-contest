      <p>SABAK BERNAM, 25 Nov — The Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) said the highest consumer complaints to date were related to the prices of ready-to-eat food in restaurants.</p>
      <p>Its minister, Datuk Seri Saifuddin Nasution Ismail said more complaints were lodged by consumers on this matter, compared to price increase of raw materials.</p>
      <p>“The price increase of raw materials only happen seasonally, when supply is plentiful, prices are low and vice versa,” he said after visiting Jeti 3,000 here today.</p>
      <p>Asked about the ministry’s steps in addressing possible fish price hikes during the monsoon season, Saifuddin Nasution said enforcement and monitoring of the matter were ongoing based on consumer complaints.</p>
      <p>He said price monitoring was not only conducted during the monsoon season but was conducted on a regular basis and so far, he has not received any complaints on the issue. — Bernama</p>
