      <p>While it often costs less to fly to Paris from Vancouver than to Manitoba, Swoop is offering a number of extremely low fares as part of its latest sale.</p>

      <h3>Discover Puerto Vallarta</h3>
      <p>World-famous tequila, delectable Mexican cuisine, beautiful beaches, and beaming sunshine are just a few of the reasons why people visit Puerto Vallarta. And, while it can be fun just to kick and back and relax at a resort, this beautiful city is a great place to stay in. What’s more, there are a number of ancient ruins nearby that are fascinating to explore.</p>
      <h3>Flying Swoop: What to know before you go</h3>
      <p>Since Swoop flies out of Abbotsford, Vancouverites have to make a trip into the Fraser Valley in order to catch their flights. As a result, many locals skip the low-cost option because they don’t want to spend the extra time or money getting to the airport.</p>
      <p>For those who are looking to save, but don’t want to spend big bucks on a cab or leaving their car at the airport, there is an alternative: Reliable Bus. Find out more information about the cost-effective transit option <a href="http://vancouverisawesome.com/2019/09/13/reliable-bus-abbotsford-airport/">here</a>.</p>
      <p><i>Note:</i> While the low-cost carrier is an extremely affordable alternative, it is worthwhile to note that <a href="https://www.vancouverisawesome.com/2019/01/19/canada-budget-friendly-airlines-costs/">there are a number of additional costs</a>. For one, luggage will cost extra, as will selecting your own seat or even speaking to an operator. As such, it is worthwhile to factor in what you need to bring, or if you want to sit in a particular spot.</p>
