        <b>Nationwide Building Society has opened an API sandbox for third party developers to pilot applications to help speed up mortgage processing for brokers.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The sandbox pilot enables third party systems to connect with Nationwide’s credit risk and back office systems via APIs. <br/><br/>Currently brokers use separate systems to collect client information, source their mortgage and then submit the application, a cumbersome process that entails duplication of information and excess paperwork. Baked-in APIs can reduce the overhead by ensuring that clients' information can be input just once and shared between systems.<br/><br/>The UK building society says it has been working with a number of third parties over the past few months to refine the systems available for the intermediary market.<br/><br/>Ian Andrew, director of intermediary relationships at Nationwide Building Society, says: “Brokers generate a significant proportion of our mortgage lending, so its important we also invest in our services.<br/><br/>“The launch of our API sandbox is a significant moment for Nationwide and the sector and we’re excited to be innovating and learning in partnership with a number of third parties in a test ahead of rolling out this new technology to the whole market. We hope this gives brokers back valuable time to help more clients or focus on other activity."</p>
