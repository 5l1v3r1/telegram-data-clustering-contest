      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T10:33:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 10:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/NicNak_Media" target="_blank">NicNak Media</a></address>
      <p>New Zealand pop artist <b>Theia</b> has written and recorded a traditional hymn in Te Reo Māori with the hope of spreading love and peace this Christmas.</p>
      <p>Titled '<b>Te Kaiwhakaora O Te Ao' </b>it will be released on all platforms on <b>Thursday, November 28</b> and will be the landing song on <b>Air New Zealand</b> international and domestic flights throughout the month of December.</p>
      <p>To pre-save '<b>Te Kaiwhakaora O Te Ao' </b><a href="https://nicnakmedia.us11.list-manage.com/track/click?u=2791a3fc6c0bf13e6d11f3ac0&amp;id=f14f56cd3c&amp;e=7e82ea609e">click here.</a></p>
      <p>The song sees <b>Theia</b> - who descends from Waikato-Tainui - following in the footsteps of her late great grandmother <b>Mite Kerei Kukutai, </b>the composer of the beloved waiata ‘<b><a href="https://nicnakmedia.us11.list-manage.com/track/click?u=2791a3fc6c0bf13e6d11f3ac0&amp;id=af7f99513f&amp;e=7e82ea609e">Kiwi Weka</a></b>’.</p>
      <p><b>'Te Kaiwhakaora O Te Ao'</b> is one of only a few Christmas waiata originally composed in Te Reo, with most translated from English. The song’s lyrics are traditional; its melody solemn and contemplative, with a lone guitar.</p>
      <p><b>Theia </b>- who is fluent in Te Reo and has a BA double majoring in Te Reo Māori and Māori and Indigenous Studies - worked with fellow Māori creatives to bring the project together, including the illustrator <b>Māori Mermaid</b> (Ngāpuhi, Ngāti Ruanui) who designed the cover art (see above) and <b>Nicole Hunt</b> (Ngāi Tūhoe) who shot the photos and video. <b>Theia</b> is wearing the work of esteemed fashion designer <b>Bobby Luke</b> (Ngāti Ruanui) from the label <b>Campbell Luke</b>.</p>
      <p>The song was recorded at <b>Roundhead Studios </b>by award-winning producer and engineer <b>Simon Gooding</b> and mastered by renowned engineer <b>Chris Chetland</b> from <b>Kog Studio</b>.</p>
      <p>“I wrote '<b>Te Kaiwhakaora O Te Ao'</b> as a gift to our people - a traditional Christmas hymn to call our own. A waiata to transcend generations and weave together the past and present,” says <b>Theia</b>. “I would love this to be a song that is sung and performed in marae, churches and schools for many years to come”.</p>
      <p>Christchurch-born <b>Theia</b> emerged on the New Zealand music scene in 2016 with her song '<b>Roam</b>'. She has gone on to release two EPs to critical acclaim; her first earning her three nominations at the<b> 2017 VNZMA</b>s and her second <b>NOT YOUR PRINCESS</b> receiving two nominations at the 2019 <b>Waiata Māori Music Awards.</b></p>
      <p><b>Theia</b> is opening for Swedish singer <b>LÉON</b> in <b>Auckland</b> on <b>November 29</b> and in <b>Brisbane</b> on <b>December 4</b>. Catch <b>Theia</b> live this summer at <b>Rhythm and Vines </b>on<b> December 29</b>; <b>Bay Dreams Warm-up </b>in <b>Tauranga </b>on <b>January 1</b>; supporting <b>Tones And I </b>in<b> Tauranga </b>on <b>January 5 </b>and <b>Soundsplash Timaru </b>on <b>January 17.</b></p>
