      <h4>What just happened? Few legal issues are as contentious as suspects being forced to hand over their passwords. But the practice could occur less in the future after a Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled it violates the Fifth Amendment.</h4>
      <p>As reported by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/11/police-cant-force-child-porn-suspect-to-reveal-his-password-court-rules/#">Ars Technica</a>, a 4-3 ruling overturned a lower-court order that demanded a suspect in a child-pornography case hand over a 64-character password to his computer. It had ruled that the decision didn’t violate his Fifth Amendment rights as Joseph J. Davis appeared to confirm child porn was on his machine.</p>
      <p>“It’s 64 characters and why would I give that to you,” he told law enforcement when asked for the password. “We both know what’s on there. It’s only going to hurt me. No f**king way I’m going to give it to you.”</p>
      <p>The lower court argued that the password request didn’t violate the Fifth Amendment protections against self-incrimination as it fell under the foregone conclusion exemption, which is when the government already knows of the existence, location, and content of the sought-after material.</p>
      <p>But the Supreme Court rejected this argument. Justice Debra Todd said that disclosing a password is testimonial, and that revealing it was a verbal communication, rather than a physical act such as giving a handwriting sample or providing blood.</p>
      <p>“As a passcode is necessarily memorized, one cannot reveal a passcode without revealing the contents of one’s mind,” the judge wrote. “Here, under United States Supreme Court precedent, we find that the Commonwealth is seeking the electronic equivalent to a combination to a wall safe—the passcode to unlock Appellant’s computer.”</p>
      <p>The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), which filed a friend-of-the-court briefing in the case, <a href="https://www.eff.org/document/commonwealth-v-davis-eff-amicus">wrote</a> that people should not be put in a no-win situation of choosing between giving up their password, thereby handing over the wealth of information stored on a device, or defying a court order.</p>
      <p>The EFF <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/11/victory-pennsylvania-supreme-court-rules-police-cant-force-you-tell-them-your">writes</a> that two other state supreme courts, in Indiana and New Jersey, are considering similar cases, and the group is participating in both.</p>
