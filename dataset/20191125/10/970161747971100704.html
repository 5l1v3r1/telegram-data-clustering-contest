        <b>Gerwyn Price has cleared up what was bothering him during the Players Championship final on Sunday, blaming a moving stage for his bad mood at the start of the game.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Price was beaten 11-9 by Michael van Gerwen in a superb final in Minehead, with the two players showing absolute respect for each other at the end of the game.</p>
      <p>However, there appeared to be some tension between the two men early in the game, with the Iceman clearly bothered by something.</p>
      <p>The pair have slightly differing accounts of the incident, but both involve something to do a moving Minehead stage.</p>
      <p>‘I could hear clicking on the stage,’ Price told Live Darts. ‘I wasn’t blaming Michael in any way, but there was some movement.</p>
      <p>‘I mentioned it but I thought it’s pointless dwelling on it, just try and blank it out and move on.’</p>

      <p>Van Gerwen said the moving stage was the issue for the Welshman, but he had his own problem with Price starting his throw too quickly.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>‘At the first break he was complaining that the stage was moving a little bit,’ said MVG.</p>
      <p>‘I wasn’t complaining, but three times he was throwing and I wasn’t away yet so he touched my shoulder and I told him there was no need for that.</p>
      <p>‘But there was no words in between, it wasn’t a bad thing.’</p>
      <p>Any problem the players had was quashed by the end of the contest as they shared a hug and had kind words for each other as their budding rivalry continues to grow, but in a friendly manner.</p>
      <p>‘Michael was the better player tonight,’ said Price. ‘I’ve got no complaints, and the opening leg [which saw 17 missed doubles] probably set the tone for the match.</p>
      <p>‘I battled back to get in front but Michael was too strong in the end. I’ve had another great weekend and the crowd were fantastic, they gave me great support.</p>
      <p>‘I played well, had a good week, I’m happy to get to the final, probably a bit too happy to get to the final. I played alright, just a few missed opportunities.</p>

      <p>‘I’m not here to lose in finals, I wanted to win and I missed opportunities. That game was there for both of us. Michael played better than me.’</p>

      <p>The world number one talked up the rivalry between the two men, and reaffirmed his belief that the Iceman is a credit to the sport.</p>
      <p>‘I think Gerwyn is good for darts,’ said the world champ. ‘He’s exciting and he’s a good player and he has done well lately. He deserves every credit and it will be a great rivalry – but today was my day.’</p>
