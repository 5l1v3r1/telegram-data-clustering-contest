      <h1>Ant McPartlin's ex-wife Lisa Armstrong makes new dig with cosmetic range name</h1>
      <h2>The make-up artist has been locked in a divorce battle with the TV presenter.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T10:56:01+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 10:56</time> by <a rel="author">Dailyrecord.co.uk</a></address>
      <p>The ex-wife of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/ant-and-dec">Ant McPartlin</a> has taken a swipe at the TV host with the name of her new cosmetic range.</p>
      <p>Lisa Armstrong has reportedly called the products after their beloved pet, who they are locked in a custody batter over.</p>
      <p>According the The Sun, the make-up artist will name her range Lisa Love Hurley.</p>
      <p>The 43-year-old has been in a divorce battle with Ant as she wants to keep <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/pets">dog</a> Hurley full-time - but Ant is determined to spend half the time with the pup.</p>
      <p>“It’s a way for her to say ‘F*** you’ to Ant, and a declaration of how much she loves Hurley,"  a source told <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/ant-mcpartlins-ex-wife-lisa-20953731">the Mirror</a> .</p>
      <p>"He’s been there by her side through all the mess Ant created.</p>
      <p>“She has always been upset that Ant couldn’t just let her have custody of Hurley who she sees as her baby.</p>
      <p>“She knows that Ant loves Hurley as well but she really hoped he would be the bigger man and let her at least have custody of him after all she has been through."</p>
      <p>It comes as Lisa has rejected a proposed settlement of £31million - half of Ant's £62million fortune - as well as their former marital home in London's upmarket Chiswick.</p>
      <p>Instead, Lisa's said to be wanting her day in court and has so far refused to sign Ant's non-disclosure agreement (NDA) that would be part of any financial settlement her legal team thrashes out with his.</p>
