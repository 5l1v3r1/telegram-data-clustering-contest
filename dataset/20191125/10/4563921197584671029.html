        <i>The entire humanity together ought to start working, concentrating on underpinning and strengthening the part of compassion, love, and sympathy from enriched Islamic philosophy into the overall human psyche. </i>
      </p>
      <p>Islamophobia may not be confused with the so-called xenophobia. In the ideological debate, the term Islamophobia become a popular term in 2000, referred to as the dread, abhorrence of, or prejudice against the Islamic religion particularly, or Muslims generally, mainly when seen as a geopolitical force or the cause of extremism. Very recently, in Norway’s southern city of Kristiansand over the weekend, some extremist people of the right-wing group Stop the Islamization of Norway (SION) burned and tor apart the copy of the Muslim’s Holy Book Qur’an (a central religious text of Islam). The action has been condemned and upsurges from top to toe annoyance in the Muslim world.</p>
      <p>Besides, it is not the single case that the SION has hurt Muslim feelings around the world.In June 2019, in a speech by the SION’s leaders during the event in town Drammen, Anna Braten, the leader clearly said that Islam has no place in Norway and all their Qur’an and Masjids (Mosques) must be destroyed at any cost. In Norway, most of the time, the feeling of Muslims have been hurt either through the burning of the Qur’an, destroying their worship-places, or insulting them in public.</p>
      <p>On August 11, 2019, an unknown gunman opened fire on the Al-Noor Islamic Centre (ANIC) in the capital Oslo, some people died on the scene, while the rest were afraid to go back to their desired places.  The above recent actions have prompted debates over whether the Muslim population is getting their fundamental rights in the country or not?. For many years the secret police say, Muslims are the biggest threat for this country; the same ideas were followed by many extremists and started an anti-Mulsim campaign to thrash the Muslim population in Norway. While it never makes sagacity if the authority proclaims hatred speech against other minority, the rest of the community consider it legal to act against those who are in marginal. So to speak if the commanding body is spreading and supporting abhorrence languages and illicit activities contrary to minority, the majority are eager to fight and cleanse the rest by considering it lawful.</p>
      <p>To deal with the recent, I am sure burning any book is not an excellent practice to follow,  it will not be an exaggeration to say that tearing or burning a book is slighted act and only loose in behavior might do such actions. It is better to read and keep. But it has never been illegal in the West even today. Even the SION members were prevented by the police of burning the Qur’an; however, effects are the same, and nothing has been achieved by them.</p>
      <p>Islam is a perfect religion, which does not allow the followers to act against humanity, generally speaking, millions of non-Muslims are living in Muslim countries, they are practicing their faith with peace and without any fear. Till now, it never witnessed if  Muslims have burn other religious books or disrespect other religions or people. After all, faiths, no matter who we are, to whom we bow and whom we follow, indeed we are human beings and human being ought to treat each other like humans, not beasts. We should respect each other faith, religious beliefs, and other theological seminaries that people accept as true. </p>
      <p>Islamophobia and Xenophobia becoming even more alarming and need to be handled with extra caution. In most of the western states, these terms are used by the elite leaders to attract and raise the emotion of <b><i>non-Muslims against Muslims</i></b>, or against <b><i>the we and them</i></b> Such movements are spreading every day through the different mediums, by certain politicians were inciting these trends against Islam and other. Using religious ideas and policies may favor some people on the one hand, but in the same vein, such action severely affects the rest of the people and their frame of mind as well. The so-called notion more against the less create undesired demands suppresses the less either to join or to be confiscated from all kinds of rights they retained. These disagreeable stresses some time take a new shape, a shape of extremism and zealotry, to protect their rights.</p>
      <p>Such attacks are not only against the Muslim community but also pose a significant threat to all humanity. I request all international communities to work cooperatively and eliminate all those viruses that threaten the entire world. All Muslims and non-Muslims countries must adopt some measure or laws to prevent such actions and pledge diplomatic and peaceful solutions to the constant Islamophobia or Xenophobia.</p>
