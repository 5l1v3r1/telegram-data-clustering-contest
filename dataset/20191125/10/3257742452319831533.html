      <p>As expected, <a href="https://appleinsider.com/topic/Apple">Apple</a> is to have <a href="https://appleinsider.com/black-friday">Black Friday</a> special deals —but not by reducing the cost of any of its products. Instead, anyone purchasing certain devices between Friday November 29 and Monday December 2, will <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/gifts/shopping-event">receive an Apple Store Gift Card</a>.<br/><br/>The only detail so far is that the maximum gift card amount is $200 and that, unsurprisingly, the value depends on which item is bought. Apple is not saying which items are eligible, it so far only refers to "select products during our four-day shopping event."<br/><br/>For people who were already planning to buy one Apple product and expect to buy another shortly afterwards, Apple's gift card scheme could be a way to effectively get a discount on the second item.<br/><br/>If you have an Apple Card, and use it to make these Black Friday purchases, <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/08/11/apple-reveals-details-of-how-apple-cards-daily-cash-works">you will get 3% cash back</a>. Apple doesn't directly say this, but for the first time its Black Friday webpage includes a <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/gifts/shopping-event">detailed promotion</a> for Apple Card.<br/><br/>However, there are alternative Black Friday sales that see actual discounts on a range of Apple products. <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/11/25/apple-black-friday-deals-2019-ipads-249-airpods-drop-to-134-macbooks-from-699">Amazon has already launched a sale</a> that sees a 2019 iPad <a href="https://amzn.to/2OgunT6">selling for $249</a>, for instance, instead of $329.<br/><br/>Check out the <i>AppleInsider</i> <a href="https://appleinsider.com/topic/black+friday">guide to Black Friday sales</a> to see the best bargains —and when the <a href="https://deals.appleinsider.com/">deals</a> are available.</p>
