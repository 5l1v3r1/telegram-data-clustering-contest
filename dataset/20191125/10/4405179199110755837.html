      <p>Apple has made a lot of improvements to the EarPods bundled with its iPhones, but buying a pair of <a href="https://www.macworld.co.uk/review/ios-accessories/airpods-review-apple-wireless-headphones-review-3652324/">AirPods</a> or other premium headphones remains an obvious and effective upgrade.

      <p>In this article we gather the best headphone deals currently on offer, as well as our general tips on what features you should be looking for and the price you should be expecting to pay - because deals aren't always what they appear to be.</p>

      <h3>Best headphone discounts: What to look for</h3>
      <p>There are three main kinds of headphone: in-ear (including the <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/MMEF2ZM/A/airpods">AirPods</a> and other earbuds), on-ear and over-ear (a heavier, more enclosing version of on-ear). Each type provides better and more insulating audio than the one before, but is also heavier, potentially less comfortable, and probably more expensive.</p>
      <p>When deciding which product to buy, you should be thinking about audio quality, comfort of fit, compatibility and price. Your priorities will depend on your requirements. Think carefully about:</p>
      <p><b>The sort of audio you listen to.</b> Different headphones excel at different parts of the spectrum, and you should find a pair that suit your favourites, such as bass for dance music (something that <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=Beats+by+Dr.+Dre&amp;rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3ABeats+by+Dr.+Dre&amp;ascsubtag=41-3686702-11-0000000">Beats headphones</a> tend to be good at). Check reviews and product descriptions for discussion of specific types of audio.</p>
      <p><b>What you'll be doing.</b> If you'll be running and working out, you'll probably need the headphones to be sweat-proof and to have ear clips or a neck band (or <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Beats-Dr-Dre-Powerbeats3-Earphones-Black/dp/B01LW8BKBD/?ascsubtag=41-3686702-11-0000000">both</a>) to keep them on. For a noisy commute you might want noise isolation.</p>
      <p><b>Devices you need the headphones to be compatible with</b> - ie the ports they need to be able to plug into. Current iPhones don't have 3.5mm headphone ports so consider Lightning or Bluetooth.</p>
      <p><b>Your budget.</b> If you want top-spec audio you'll have to pay for the privilege (£500-£600 isn't unusual) but it's possible to get a decent pair for well under £100. <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00U5WV250?ascsubtag=41-3686702-11-0000000">Sony's MDR-ZX330BT</a> are a nice choice at under £50.</p>
      <p>Our specialised buying guides are a good source of detailed advice. We look at <a href="https://www.macworld.co.uk/feature/iphone/best-lightning-headphones-3641595/">Lightning headphones</a>, <a href="https://www.macworld.co.uk/feature/iphone/best-wireless-headphones-3636239/">wireless headphones</a> and <a href="https://www.macworld.co.uk/feature/apple/best-running-headphones-3653065/">running headphones</a> in separate group tests.</p>
