      <p>Google is lopping <a href="http://tyvm.ly/A2TM7">$200 off the Pixel 4</a> if you buy the device via the Google Store. But what if you want a service plan? That’s where this rather intriguing Google Pixel 4 Fi deal comes in.</p>
      <p>The Fi promotion sees Google giving <a href="http://tyvm.ly/u0PR6">50% back in Fi credit</a> when you purchase and activate a Pixel 4 or Pixel 4 XL via the operator. That means you get $400 in Fi credit when you buy the 64GB standard model, $450 credit when you buy the 128GB standard model or 64GB XL variant, and $500 credit when you buy the 128GB Pixel 4 XL.</p>
      <p>It’s worth reiterating that this is Fi credit rather than cashback/crediting your bank account. Google’s terms note that this can only be applied to costs such as data, calls, text messages, and device protection. So those hoping to get another device via Fi with this credit are out of luck.</p>
      <p>The search giant says you’ll need to activate a full service plan rather than a data-only plan, with your Fi account being credited after your first 60 days with the service. Furthermore, your Pixel 4 or XL device needs to be activated within 30 days of receiving the shipment confirmation email.</p>
      <p>This still seems like a pretty good deal if you were planning to get a new phone and service plan anyway. And there’s always the <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-store-black-friday-1055513/">Google Store deal</a> if you don’t care for Fi, offering $200 off the 2019 flagships.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, the Google Pixel 4 Fi deal expires at 11:59PM PST on December 2, 2019 or while stocks last. So you still have the rest of the week to weigh your options. Keen to grab the Fi deal? Then check out the button below.</p>
