          <p>For both Canada and Combined Colleges and Campuses, this instalment of the Super50 Cup couldn’t have been any more horrendous. Both sit slumped in the trenches of Group A of the showpiece tournamnet, befittingly so with the outfits being routed and thumped in their sorties to see their sojourns being wrapped up at an early stage.</p>
          <p>What will especially perturb the two units is not just the fact that the failed to make the most of a pristine chance to showcase their capabilities but completely faltered in their aspirations. The two have fallen flat of their faces, left latching at little else than straws with the writing on the wall clear for them ever since their tournamnet openers.</p>

                <p>For Canada in particular, the backlash the side have faced for their showings is completely justified. The side have been taken swipes and jibes at with their gaffe showings unbecoming of a side of the calibre of an international setup with the team managing to muster up a sole win in their seven outings with their howler of a run extending to four successive defeats as things stand.</p>
                <p>The come into this clash having been routed by 7 wickets by Barbados who needed just 23 runs to peel off the sorry 155 run target laid out infront of them with 7 wickets to spare.. Elsewhere, Combined Colleges and Campuses haven’t fared any better with the side being ousted out of the tournamnet as well with the five defeats from seven matches although they did manage to defeat Jamaica by two wickets the last time around as they chased down 273.</p>

                      <h3>Pitch Conditions And Toss</h3>
                      <p>A reasonably good wicket for the bats, this is a surface where the team batting first is going to come out and look to post anything above 250. With the team chasing winning on a mere two occasions out of the 12 matches contested over here, it’s apparent that the team winning the toss will be looking to come out and set a target today.</p>

                            <h3>CAN Vs CCC Dream11 Wicket-Keeper</h3>
                            <p>Romaine Morrison from Combined Colleges and Campuses is our pick for this facet of our Dream 11 setup owing to two reasons. Our perusal for the choice here lead us to him not only due to hs relatively safe and steady knock with the bat but also courtesy of the fact that he’s going to find himself heavily involved behind the wickets as well today.</p>
                            <h3>CAN Vs CCC Dream11 Batsmen</h3>
                            <p>With 148 runs in 7 encounters till now, Jonathan Drakes will be his partner for the day with the bat having been someone the side can bank on till now. In an otherwise dwindling batting unit, he’s managed to show he stomach of a fight and punch above his weight, something we envisage him doing today as well.</p>
                            <p>Paul Palmer, the side’s leading run getter with 162 runs will be accompany him for the prevelant tie alongside Sadique Henry as we opt for an entire trivalent of picks from the home side for this one.</p>
                            <h3>CAN Vs CCC Dream11 All-Rounders</h3>
                            <p>The most heavily packed segment of our Dream 11 unit, we compensate for the batting picks from Canada over here by beginning with Nitish Kumar. Be it the international circuit or the Super50 Cup, the all-rounder has undoubtedly been the safest bet form Canada given his ability to incorporate his traits in both the dockets of the game.</p>
                            <p>It has seen him become the side’s leading scorer with 261 runs in 7 matches to make him an instant pick alongside Harsh Thaker with Rayyan Pathan completing the picks from the unit given his 8 wickets he’s snared till now. From the home side meanwhile we have the singular pick come in as well in the form of Jarlarnie Seales.</p>
                            <h3>CAN Vs CCC Dream11 Bowling Order</h3>
                            <p>While his 15 wickets till now were more than enough to warrant CCC’s Akeem Jordan’s selection in this docket of our Dream 11 side, the fact that he’s going to be sending down his rippers against a dwindling Canada side only made his selection more blatant. The bowler is set to pick up wickets at will today with his rippers sent to leave Canada in a tussle.</p>
                            <p>Larry Joseph partners him up for this one whilst from Canada we are getting in Shahid Ahmadzai given his ability to act as the custodian of his unit’s lower middle-order, something which has seen him earn 182 runs in 7 matches.</p>
                            <h3>CAN Vs CCC Dream11 Captain And Vice-Captain</h3>
                            <p>Jordan will be leading our side out as the captain whilst Thaker is the vice-captain.</p>
