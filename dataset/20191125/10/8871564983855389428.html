      <h1>Pit bull tore woman’s cheek in Makassar, owner to be questioned by police</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T10:11:13+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 10:11</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/Coconuts%20Jakarta" target="_blank">Coconuts Jakarta</a></address>
      <p>In yet another pit bull attack in Indonesia that happened over the weekend, a 35-year-old woman named Irawati Saskia Anwar was attacked by a pit bull in front of her house in the South Sulawesi capital of Makassar on Sunday evening. As a result of the attack, her left cheek was torn and she also suffered wounds throughout her body.</p>
      <p>Head of Mapala sub-district Community Development (Binmas) Umar Zulkarnaen said the owner of the pit bull, identified as 28-year-old Ihsan, was picking up food for his dog when the attack occurred. As Ihsan went into his house, the pit bull went out to chase a cat. At the same time, Irawati was just leaving her house when the pit bull suddenly attacked her.</p>
      <p>“The dog wasn’t tied up, he just let it loose. So when the owner went into the house, the dog went out to the road. The victim tried to close her gate, but the dog jumped and bit her. After it bit the victim, the dog owner came and held his dog to be carried home,” Umar <a href="https://news.detik.com/berita/d-4797428/pipi-perempuan-di-makassar-robek-digigit-anjing-pitbull?single=1">told </a><i><a href="https://news.detik.com/berita/d-4797428/pipi-perempuan-di-makassar-robek-digigit-anjing-pitbull?single=1">Detik</a> </i><a href="https://news.detik.com/berita/d-4797428/pipi-perempuan-di-makassar-robek-digigit-anjing-pitbull?single=1">today</a>. </p>
      <p>Irawati was rushed to a local hospital where, according to reports, she will undergo surgery on her face. Umar said the pit bull’s whereabouts is not known at the moment, and Ihsan has been requested to come to a local police station for questioning. He also said that the sub-district had forbidden its residents to keep dogs as pets, but Ihsan ignored the rule.</p>
      <p>The pit bull is reportedly approximately one year old and has been in Ihsan’s care since it was a puppy. Residents of Tidung Street, where Irawati and Ihsan live, said that <a href="https://news.detik.com/berita/d-4797561/pitbull-yang-gigit-pipi-wanita-di-makassar-kerap-kejar-warga-yang-jalan-kaki?single=1">the dog was known to be aggressive</a> and regularly chased people off the street.</p>
      <p>Police say they have summoned Ihsan in relation to the case. No charges have yet been announced.</p>
      <p>The latest case involving a pit bull occurred a day earlier in the North Sumatra capital of Medan. An 8-year-old girl, identified by her initial M,<a href="https://coconuts.co/jakarta/news/8-year-old-girl-attacked-by-family-pit-bull-in-critical-condition/"> is reportedly in critical condition</a> after her family’s pit bull attacked her. According to reports, M was playing alone with the pit bull when the canine attacked her, leaving severe injuries on her face and around her head.</p>
      <p>The incident was not the first pit bull attack on a child in Indonesia in recent years. In 2017, an 8-year-old in Malang, East Java was <a href="https://coconuts.co/jakarta/news/police-believe-8-year-old-girl-mauled-killed-foster-familys-pit-bull-malang/">mauled and killed by a pit bull</a> belonging to her foster family. Police say it was likely that the girl dropped her doll near the dog, which startled it and caused it to attack the girl when she got near.</p>
      <p>The ferocious canine has also been used as an attack dog. Last year, a man in Central Jakarta <a href="https://coconuts.co/jakarta/news/man-sics-pitbull-security-guard-telling-keep-dog-leash-might-get-pet-back/">set his pit bull on a security guard</a> after the latter told him to keep the dog on a leash. The dog owner was eventually <a href="https://www.suara.com/news/2019/01/18/221644/serang-satpam-polisi-tetapkan-pemilik-anjing-pitbull-sebagai-tersangka">charged with assault</a>.</p>
