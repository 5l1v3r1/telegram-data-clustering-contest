      <p>A green Holden Torana sedan could be key to solving the suspected murders of three Lake Macquarie teenage girls with police saying the pain of the families "lingers to today".</p>
      <p>Detectives believe Robyn Hickie, 18, and Amanda Robinson, 14, were killed in 1979 before Gordana Kotevski, 16, was murdered in 1994.</p>
      <p>Robyn left her home on the evening of April 7 1979 and was last seen standing at a bus stop on the Pacific Highway in Belmont North.</p>
      <p>Amanda Robinson, 14, was last seen a fortnight later on April 21 1979 near a bus stop in Swansea after attending a high school dance.</p>
      <p>Ms Gordana was forced into a vehicle while walking from Charlestown Square Shopping Centre - also in Lake Macquarie - on November 24 1994.</p>
      <p>Police on Monday made a public plea for information on the cases saying the mid-1970s Torana was central to the disappearance of the two girls in 1979.</p>
      <p>It's unclear if the green sedan was connected to Ms Gordana's 1994 disappearance.</p>
      <p>Despite investigations at the time, and over the years, none of the girls has been located.</p>
      <p>A subsequent coronial inquest into their disappearances found the three girls were deceased - most likely as a result of foul play.</p>
      <p>NSW Police Detective Chief Inspector Greg Thomas hopes photos of a similar green Torana will jog memories in the Lake Macquarie area.</p>
      <p>The car is thought to have travelled between the area and Queensland.</p>
      <p>"Whether it's still even on the road we don't know - but it's a very specific car," Det Chief Insp Thomas told reporters in Belmont on Monday.</p>
      <p>"Going back 40 years to when these disappearances occurred in this area, there could be someone who has knowledge of that vehicle.</p>
      <p>"The car has become a focus, not the sole focus, but a focus of investigators."</p>
      <p>Det Chief Insp Thomas said the families of all three missing girls continue to suffer.</p>
      <p>"It (the pain) lingers to today, and that's why the investigators treat every inquiry to its highest," he said.</p>
      <p>"What it gives them is the confidence ... that police are continuing to investigate these disappearances."</p>
