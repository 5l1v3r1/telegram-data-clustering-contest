      <p>The haul of 99 silver pennies - believed to be more than 1,000 years old - were found by 50-year-old builder Don Crawley at the site of a forgotten Saxon church in 2017.</p>
      <p>Mr Crawley, from Bucklesham, discovered the coins on his first visit to the site, and the Suffolk farmer who owns the land did not wish to reveal further details of its location.</p>
      <p>The hoard was taken to the British Museum who, following examination, stated the coins were from the reign of Aethelred II - who reigned in England from AD 978-1016.</p>
      <p>The haul remained at the British Museum until they decided to disclaim them in August.</p>
      <p>The hoard will be sold by Dix Noonan Webb (DNW) in Mayfair between December 4 and 5, with the proceeds split between finder Mr Crawley and the farmer on a 50/50 basis.</p>
      <p>The haul has a pre-auction estimate of £30,000 to £50,000.</p>

After walking up an incline in the field, my Deus detector gave off a strong signal and within a short space of time I had recovered 93 coins.</p>
      <p>"The finds liaison officer was called in and they investigated the site which turned out to be a long forgotten Saxon church which had been dismantled by the Normans in the 11th century.</p>
      <p>"Excavating around they uncovered the remains of human bones and I found another 6 coins."</p>
      <p>The hoard includes two rare mints - Melton Mowbray and a previously unrecorded mint in Louth, Lincolnshire.</p>
      <p>Louth had been a "Burh" or fortified settlement in the 10th century with a church containing the remains of St Herefrith.</p>
      <p>The auctioneers said the hoard appears to have been buried by a pilgrim who was making penitence worried about the impending apocalypse of the Millennium.</p>
