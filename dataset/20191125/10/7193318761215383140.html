        <b>Quotable: MAPS 3 whitewater park finances</b>
      </p>
      <p>"As you all know, the long-term plan out there is that we're trying to have more revenue-producing capability."</p>
      <p>— MAPS 3 Citizens Advisory Board Chairman <b>Tom McDaniel</b>, as the board recommended spending nearly $2 million, $500,000 above the estimate, on a surf attraction at the MAPS 3 whitewater park. The "double occupancy surf machine" is expected to net $250,000 per year for the cash-strapped Oklahoma City Boathouse Foundation, the city's whitewater park operating partner. Foundation Executive Director Mike Knopp said timing is critical in order to have the surf machine open by spring, when the park's 2020 season starts. Kids — or anyone, Knopp emphasized the surf machine's generations-spanning appeal — could get an all-day surfing pass for $19 but Knopp said the new attraction is seen as a driver of season pass sales. The city council makes the final decision; the council last year authorized $7.9 million for whitewater park improvements.</p>
      <p><b>Worth noting:</b> Olympic trials return to the whitewater park in May.</p>

        <b>Q&amp;A: Councilwoman picks podcasts</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Oklahoman asked Ward 6 Councilwoman JoBeth Hamon for her recommendations on podcasts with a civic focus.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Q: Can you give us suggestions on podcasts that have caught your attention?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>A:</b> <b>"Localites OKC"</b> showcases cultural events, restaurant openings, and volunteer opportunities around OKC. While not specific to OKC, <b>"Strong Towns"</b> explores issues related to city planning and building resilient communities.</p>
      <p><b>Worth noting:</b> Thanksgiving holiday cooking is on Food Dude <b>Dave Cathey's</b> mind in the new edition of The Oklahoman's <b>"Commmunity Table"</b> podcast.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Briefly: Contract ratified, safety concerns raised</b>
      </p>
      <p>• The city council ratified a new, one-year contract with the International Association of Fire Fighters Local 157, retroactive to July 1. Local President Scott Van Horn said salary increases average 1.6%; the deal also includes an increase in the city's contribution to health insurance.</p>
      <p>• The Downtown Design Review Committee approved a request to remove deteriorating, unused balconies from the north face of downtown's historic Colcord Hotel. An engineer said debris falling into an alley poses a "life safety" risk.</p>
      <p>
        <b>City sets holiday hours</b>
      </p>

          <b>The MAPS 3 convention center logo gives a sense of the building's architecture and, in the color palette, echoes the logo of Scissortail Park, its neighbor to the west. The Convention and Vistors Bureau has begun marketing the building; a recent report for the city council said 14 new booking opportunities for the convention center were identified in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. Construction is to be complete Sept. 19, 10 months from now.</b>
