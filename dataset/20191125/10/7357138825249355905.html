      <h1>Facebook Says Facial Recognition App Was Only Used By Employees</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T10:54:37+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 10:54</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pymnts.com/author/pymnts/" target="_blank">PYMNTS</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a> built a facial recognition app that was intended only for internal use, a company spokesperson told <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/11/22/facebook-confirms-facial-recognition-app-says-it-was-only-for-internal-use/">VentureBeat </a>on Friday (Nov. 22). </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-built-internal-facial-recognition-camera-app-2019-11">Business Insider</a> reported on Friday that as early as 2015, Facebook created a facial recognition smartphone app. It was said to have had the ability to “scan the faces of people identifiable through the social network’s facial recognition system.”</p>
      <p>A Facebook spokesperson told news outlets in a statement that it’s not out of the ordinary for the company to develop apps for internal use only. He said it was “a way to learn about new technologies.” </p>
      <p>He added that the facial recognition app was only available to employees and “could only recognize employees and their friends who had face recognition enabled.”</p>
      <p>He also said that a Facebook test asking users to take photos of their faces is intended to detect people “but is not made to recognize the face of any individual person.” </p>
      <p>Facebook is now making facial recognition an option for users. People who don’t want their faces to be analyzed can opt-out.</p>
      <p>Business Insider reported that the app was in its early stages, according to <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/facebook-built-a-facial-recognition-app-for-employees/">CNET</a>. It worked by providing employees the Facebook name and profile picture of anyone they pointed their phone cameras at. </p>
      <p>It pre-dates the 2018 Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal that exposed as many as 87 million Facebook users. The company was fined a record $5 billion by the Federal Trade Commission for privacy violations.</p>
      <p>This isn’t the first time Facebook was questioned about using facial recognition. The feature that suggests the identity of people in photos was the center of a 2015 lawsuit. The suit alleged that Facebook broke an Illinois biometric privacy law. Photo tagging used to be a default feature, but now it is something users have to opt into.</p>
      <p>The class-action <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/facebook/2019/facebook-facing-35-billion-dollar-fine-over-facial-recognition-lawsuit/">lawsuit </a>will move forward despite Facebook’s efforts to halt it. The contention is about permission and a lack of information about how the photos would be used. Facebook is potentially facing fines between $1,000 and $5,000 for every penalty, and there are 7 million people involved, so the total could reach as much as $35 billion.</p>
