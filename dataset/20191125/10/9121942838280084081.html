      <p>HONOR, Mich. (AP) — The family of a suburban Detroit woman who disappeared from a cabin in northern Michigan last month is offering a $100,000 reward for information on her whereabouts.</p>
      <p>Adrienne Quintal was reported missing from a cabin near Honor, about 20 miles southwest of Traverse City. Her sister, Jenny Bryson, said Quintal called a family friend on Oct. 17 at 2:34 a.m. and said she was in a shootout with two men who were outside the cabin and that she had shot one in the face. She urged the friend to call the police.</p>
      <p>Authorities say they found multiple bullet holes in the empty cabin and shell casings on the ground outside, but no signs that anyone had been shot or otherwise injured.</p>
      <p>Bryson told the Detroit Free Press that she lies awake at night wondering where her 47-year-old sister is.</p>
      <p>Anyone with information should call (231) 882-4487.</p>
