      <h1>Celebrating the launch of Telegraph Cookbook, our new-look recipe site</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T10:13:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 10:13</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/amy-bryant/" target="_blank">Amy Bryant</a></address>
      <p>Sundays, for many of us, mean a good stint in the kitchen. Perhaps the oven’s already on for beef or a roast bird for lunch, or maybe this afternoon is set aside to knock up some squidgy brownies.</p>
      <p>Batch cooking might be on the cards for next week’s dinners; tonight, I’ll box up leftover pumpkin and chickpea stew to take to work tomorrow.</p>
      <p>Most likely, you’ve a recipe as your guide. They’re what I work with day in, day out – commissioning, editing, photographing and cooking them – and of course I’m biased when I say that my favourites come from The Telegraph's weekend newspaper pages and those of Stella and Telegraph Magazine.</p>
      <p>An average of 25 recipes appear in The Telegraph’s print sections every weekend (and between now and<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/food-and-drink/christmas-recipes/"> Christmas</a> you can expect plenty more), to be torn out, stuck on fridges or passed on to friends.</p>
      <p>Tracking down these same recipes online, however, hasn’t always been easy – until now.</p>
      <p>This week, as the Telegraph website celebrates its 25th birthday, we launch <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/recipes/">Telegraph Cookbook</a>, an all-new recipe channel home to the latest creations by our award-winning columnists <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/diana-henry/">Diana Henry</a>, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/angela-hartnett/">Angela Hartnett</a>, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/stephen-harris/">Stephen Harris</a> and <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/xanthe-clay/">Xanthe Clay,</a> along with thousands in our archive by chefs and food writers including Tom Kerridge, Raymond Blanc and Skye Gyngell.</p>
