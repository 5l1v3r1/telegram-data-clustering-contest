      <p>The growth of Japanese basketball does not appear to be in danger of slowing down any time soon, according to financial data released by the B. League on Monday.</p>
      <p>The league revealed that Japanese basketball generated ¥30.8 billion ($283 million) in revenue over the course of the 2018-19 season.</p>
      <p>The figure includes the combined revenues of the Japan Basketball Association, the B. League and B. League clubs. The sum represents nearly three times the ¥10.5 billion ($96.5 million) generated in the 2015-16 campaign, which marked the conclusion of the National Basketball League and bj-league.</p>
      <p>In improving on 2017-18 revenues by ¥3.5 billion ($32 million), the JBA and B. League have met their goal of exceeding ¥30 billion by the 2020-21 season a full two years in advance.</p>
      <p>For the second consecutive year, the Chiba Jets Funabashi led the entire B. League first division in business revenue with ¥1.76 billion, which rose 23 percent from the 2017-18 season. The Jets were followed by the SeaHorses Mikawa (¥1.62 billion), Alvark Tokyo (¥1.38 billion) and Utsunomiya Brex (¥1.37 billion).</p>
      <p>Five clubs (Chiba, Mikawa, Alvark, Utsunomiya Brex and Osaka Evessa) exceeded the ¥1.2 billion mark in the 2018-19 season, up by one from the previous year. None hit that mark in the inaugural 2016-17 season.</p>
      <p>The Hiroshima Dragonflies led the second division in revenue with ¥475 million ($4.36 million).</p>
      <p>The Brex topped ticketing revenue with ¥433 million, overtaking Chiba, which had led in the B. League’s first two seasons. The Jets were runners-up with ¥416 million, but led the league in total home attendance for the third straight year with 156,125.</p>
      <p>B. League chairman Masaaki Okawa urged clubs to raise not only their attendance but also their commercial value going forward in order to capitalize on the spotlight Japanese basketball currently enjoys.</p>
      <p>“There’s going to be higher expectations for basketball,” Okawa said during a news conference at the league’s office. “Then we can expect more sponsorships and ticketing revenue.”</p>
      <p>The league also announced that the Fukushima Firebonds and six other clubs were in a state of insolvency last season.</p>
      <p>The growth of the league and its clubs has also lead to improvements in player salaries. The average base salary of Japanese players was ¥16.1 million ($147,000) in the 2018-19 season, up by 22.9 percent from the 2016-17 campaign. Salaries of B. League players who competed at this year’s FIBA World Cup in China, excluding Nick Fazekas and Yudai Baba, averaged ¥45.4 million ($417,000).</p>
