      <p>A dog who got locked inside his owner’s car stuck it in reverse and rode in circles for an hour.</p>
      <p>Police in Port St Lucie, Florida, said the owner stepped out of the car after making a wrong turn on to Edith Court.</p>
      <p>Max, a black labrador, then accidentally put the car in reverse, causing it to circle the cul-de-sac for an hour, hitting a postbox and taking out a rubbish bin.</p>

      <p>The owner handed police an extra car fob, but it did not work due to a dead battery, so officers opened the car by entering a code on a keypad on the driver’s side door.</p>
      <p>Neighbour Anne Sabol said Max was in high spirits after being rescued, adding he “jumped out of the car, wagging his tail”.</p>
      <p>Port St Lucie Police said: “No injuries were reported, and the car sustained minor damage. Max was fine, healthy and happy!”</p>
