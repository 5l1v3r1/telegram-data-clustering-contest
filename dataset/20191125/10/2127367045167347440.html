      <p>Australia outclassed Pakistan by an <a href="https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/australia-vs-pakistan-marnus-labuschagne-stars-as-australia-outclass-pakistan-in-1st-test-2137735">inning and five runs in Brisbane</a> to take a 1-0 lead in the two-Test series on Sunday. While some of Pakistan players failed to impress at the Gabba, five of them won hearts of many on Internet after English commentator Alison Mitchell told <a href="https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/mitchell-johnson-australia-cricket-union-condemn-boos-after-steve-smith-blow-2086708">Mitchell Johnson</a> a heartwarming story, featuring Yasir Shah, Shaheen Afridi and <a href="https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/pakistan-cricket-board-ceo-clears-the-air-about-naseem-shahs-age-controversy-2137930">Naseem Shah</a> among five touring cricketers. Narrating a story about the Indian taxi driver, who drove her to the stadium in morning, Alison Mitchell said: "A couple of days ago, he was called to the Pakistan team hotel and picked up five of the Pakistan players. They wanted to go to an Indian restaurant for a meal. He drove them to an Indian restaurant."</p>
      <p>The presenter revealed that when the cricketers offered him taxi fare, he refused to take any money. However, the Pakistani cricketers returned the favour with a generous act and invited the driver to have dinner with them.</p>
      <p>"He showed the photograph on his phone of him sitting at the table at the restaurant with five members of the Pakistan cricket team," she added.</p>
      <p>The video of Alison narrating the story, shared by ABC Grandstand on Twitter, went viral on social media within no time.</p>
