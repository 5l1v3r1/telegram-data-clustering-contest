      <h1>Top street artist creates stunning new artwork underneath Banksy's 'Mild Mild West' in Stokes Croft</h1>
      <h2>Hazard is known around the world for her stunning creations</h2>

      <p>Bristol is renowned for its graffiti and this weekend it welcomed a stunning new piece of artwork.</p>
      <p>Hazard, one of the top street artists in the UK, is renowned for her striking female portraits, detailed floral creations and wildlife pieces worldwide.</p>
      <p>This weekend the artist, real name Harriet Wood, showed off her skills outside Hamilton House in Stokes Croft, where she created a new piece of work below Banksy’s 'Mild Mild West'.</p>
      <p>Harriet was initially due to create the artwork last week as part of the <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/bristols-hamilton-house-host-jam-3488243">open studios weekend at the community hub</a>, but was ordered by a doctor to rest her hand having been involved in a painting marathon across the USA, including jobs in Arizona and New York.</p>

      <p>With Harriet keeping the nature of the artwork a secret before she started painting, crowds watched on as she brought it to life, working throughout the day on both Saturday and Sunday.</p>
      <p>The artwork depicts a blue bird surrounded by flowers directly underneath Banksy's infamous piece, which he created in 1999.</p>
      <p>After spending several years in Barcelona Harriet is now based in Bristol - when not jetting all over the world to create her distinctive artwork, of course.</p>
      <p>In 2014 she was recognised by the Huffington Post among "25 women pushing the limits of street art around the world" and also named among the UK’s very best female graffiti artists by The Guardian.</p>
