      <ul>
        <li>Peter Schiff believes bitcoin is breaking out of a bearish formation and is heading to $1,000.</li>
        <li>A renowned technical analyst thinks that such a bearish pattern could, instead, take BTC to $4,000, if validated.</li>
        <li>Several technical indicators add credibility to a further drop, but there is still a chance for a rebound.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>On Oct. 19, the veteran gold bug and longtime crypto critic <a href="https://twitter.com/PeterSchiff/status/1185367590094462976?s=20">Peter Schiff entertained the idea that a head-and-shoulders pattern was developing on bitcoin’s 1-day chart</a>. He said that if this technical pattern was validated, BTC could drop to $2,000.</p>
      <p>Schiff affirmed:</p>
      <blockquote>The Bitcoin chart looks horrible. Not only does the flag that followed the recent breakdown project a move to $6K, but we are close to completing the right shoulder of a head and shoulders top, with a $14K head, and neck line just below $8K, that projects a collapse to below $2K!</blockquote>
      <p>At the time, some of the most prominent analysts in the cryptocurrency industry laughed at Schiff’s claim and disregarded his bearish outlook for BTC. <a href="https://twitter.com/APompliano/status/1185369488704921600?s=20">Anthony Pompliano simply replied “lol”</a> while <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoMichNL/status/1185470164005019648?s=20">Michaël van de Poppe said this could be viewed as a bullish signal</a>.</p>
      <p>Despite the backlash, the gold bug recently reiterated his call with a picture of the infamous bearish formation with a price target of $1,000. Now, even 40-years trading veteran <a href="https://twitter.com/PeterLBrandt/status/1198786623921627137?s=20">Peter Brandt is considering the validity of the head-and-shoulders pattern.</a></p>

      <h3>The Head-and-Shoulders Pattern</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/head-shoulders.asp">Investopedia defines a head-and-shoulders pattern as “one of the most reliable” chart formations</a> that forecasts a trend reversal from bullish to bearish. It resembles a baseline with three peaks: two on the outside with a similar height; and, one in the middle that is the highest. By measuring the height from the neckline to the highest peak, a target can be calculated.</p>
      <p>According to Peter Brandt, this technical formation does not seem to be valid due to the shape it has. But, he believes that a technical pattern is not confirmed until it is completed.</p>
      <p>Brandt said:</p>
      <blockquote>One never really knows until history is written.</blockquote>
      <p>If this technical formation is validated, the 40-years trading veteran estimates that bitcoin could drop 47 percent from the neckline to hit a target of $3,905.</p>

      <h3>Bearish Bitcoin Signs</h3>
      <p>Over the last week, bitcoin plummeted nearly 23 percent. It went from trading at a high of $8,500 on Nov. 18 to a low of $6,600 today.</p>
      <p>Considering that the neckline of the potential head-and-shoulders pattern sits around $8,000, then the drop below this price point could be taken as confirmation. Or, at least the first signs that this bearish formation would be validated and BTC is bound for a drop to $4,000.</p>
