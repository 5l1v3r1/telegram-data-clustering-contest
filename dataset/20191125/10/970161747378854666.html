      <h1>Greenhouse gases rise to highest levels ever with 'no sign of slowing down'</h1>

      <p>Experts warn time is running out to tackle climate change as greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have reached another record high.</p>
      <p>The threat to the world’s food security, wildlife and water supplies continues to grow despite Governments making pledges to combat climate change.</p>
      <p>Concentrations of carbon dioxide reached 407.8 parts per million (PPM) last year, up from 405.5 in 2017, according to a report from the United Nation’s World Meteorological Organisation.</p>
      <p>It is well above the level of around 280 ppm seen before the industrial revolution, when large scale burning of fossil fuels for energy and transport began.</p>
      <p>The latest rise is close to the increase seen between 2016 and 2017 and just above the annual average over the last decade.</p>

      <p>Concentrations of other climate-warming greenhouse gases methane and nitrous oxide also surged by higher amounts in 2018 than in the past decade.</p>

      <p>WMO secretary-general Petteri Taalas said: ‘There is no sign of a slowdown, let alone a decline, in greenhouse gases concentration in the atmosphere despite all the commitments under the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.</p>
      <p>‘We need to translate the commitments into action and increase the level of ambition for the sake of the future welfare of the mankind.’</p>
      <p>He said the last time Earth experienced comparable concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was three to five million years ago.</p>
      <p>Back then temperatures were 2C to 3C warmer and sea levels were 10-20 metres higher than today.</p>

      <p>Human activity is rapidly accelerating the process of climate change which is leading to melting glaciers, more extreme droughts and heatwaves.</p>
      <p>The WMP warns that even with the pledges made by countries under the international Paris deal, global emissions are not expected to peak by 2030.</p>
      <p>This falls well short of the 2020 turning point when scientists say it is necessary to curb dangerous climate change.</p>
      <p>Preliminary findings for 2018 suggest greenhouse gas emissions continued to rise last year.</p>
