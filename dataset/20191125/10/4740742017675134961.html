      <h2>Shoppers are being urged to return the products for a full refund</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T10:45:16+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 10:45</time> by <a rel="author">Alexander Brock</a></address>
      <p>Aldi and <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/sainsburys">Sainsbury's</a> have recalled two food items due to "health risk" fears over undeclared ingredients.</p>
      <p>Shoppers are being urged to return the products in question to the store it was bought from and ask for a full refund.</p>
      <p>The first product is British Breaded Chicken Steaks, which have been recalled by Aldi because milk has not been listed as an ingredient on the label.</p>
      <p>This is because the product has been incorrectly packaged with Breaded Chicken Kievs which do contain milk.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for the The Food Standards Agency said: "Aldi is recalling Ashfield Farm British Breaded Chicken Steaks because they contain milk which is not mentioned on the label.</p>
      <p>"This means the product is a possible health risk for anyone with an allergy or intolerance to milk or milk constituents</p>
      <p>"If you have bought the above product and have an allergy or intolerance to milk or milk constituents, do not eat it. Instead, return it to the store from where it was bought for a full refund."</p>
      <h3>Product details</h3>

        <li>Pack size: 505g</li>

        <li>Allergens: Milk</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The second product is Sainsbury’s Tomato &amp; Basil Soup, which is being recalled because some products may contain wheat (gluten) which is not mentioned on the label.</p>
      <p>The supermarket has warned customers not to eat the product and return it to the store for a full refend.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for the Food Standards Agency said: "Sainsbury’s is recalling by Sainsbury’s Tomato &amp; Basil Soup because some products may contain wheat (gluten) which is not mentioned on the label.</p>
      <p>"This means the product is a possible health risk for anyone with an allergy or intolerance to wheat or gluten."</p>
