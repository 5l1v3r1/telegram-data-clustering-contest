      <p>N’Golo Kante has explained why he snubbed a move to French champions Paris Saint-Germain in the summer to stay at <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/chelsea-fc/">Chelsea</a>.</p>
      <p>Kante has established himself as one of the best midfielders in the world since arriving in the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/premier-league/">Premier League</a> from Caen in 2015.</p>
      <p>The French World Cup-winner helped <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/leicester-city-fc/">Leicester City</a> win the Premier League before repeating the feat at Stamford Bridge.</p>

      <p>Kante’s consistent performances for Chelsea have attracted attention from Ligue 1 heavyweights PSG but he says he stayed in west London for ‘sporting’ reasons.</p>
      <p>‘Sometimes we do not necessarily know where we want to go,’ Chelsea ace Kante told French television channel Canal Plus. ‘But we know what we have.</p>
      <p>‘I know I was in Chelsea and I was good there. If I did not want to come to PSG it was more a sporting choice. I felt good in London, in the project and I was happy to stay there.’</p>

      <p>Kante has only made six Premier League appearances for Chelsea this season due to reoccurring injury problems.</p>
      <p>The midfielder impressed in Saturday’s defeat at Premier League champions Manchester City, scoring the opening goal in the narrow 2-1 loss.</p>
      <p>Speaking after the defeat, Chelsea boss Frank Lampard said: ‘The feeling in the dressing room, it looked like they were very disappointed.</p>

      <p>‘That’s probably a simple answer, because we lost, but also I think they expect a lot of themselves.</p>
      <p>‘I think they will take an amount of confidence, but where we want to go to means that we might come here and win, and it might mean we can actually win titles going forward.</p>
      <p>‘I like to see them disappointed – it just shows the next question is the reaction we have.</p>

      <p>‘I expected us to compete in the game, because I’ve been watching us training daily, getting performances and playing well.</p>
      <p>‘I’m confident in the players we’ve got. I wanted us to win, so I probably haven’t changed my [long-term] mindset too much.’</p>
