      <p>LONDON (Reuters) - Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair said on Monday that a UK-U.S. trade deal would be very difficult to agree, saying protectionist sentiment worldwide was making trade agreements harder to negotiate.</p>
      <p>“I wouldn’t hold your breath on a United States-UK trade deal, I think it is going to be very difficult,” Blair told a Reuters Newsmaker event.</p>
      <p>“In today’s world they (trade deals) are even more difficult because there is a lot of protectionist sentiment.”</p>
