      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T10:37:10+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 10:37</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishtimes.com/profile/charlie-taylor-7.3745954" target="_blank">Charlie Taylor</a></address>
      <p>Middlegame Ventures, a fintech-focused investment firm that is actively targeting Irish startups, has announced a €150 million fund targeting post-seed, series A and series B lead investments in Europe and North America.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=Luxembourg+Future+Fund">Luxembourg Future Fund</a> (LFF) and the <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=European+Investment+Fund">European Investment Fund</a> (EIF) are anchor investors in Venture Fund I. Other investors include institutional, strategic and family offices. The fund remains open to additional institutional and private investors ahead of a final close in 2020.</p>
      <p>FinTech investment veteran <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Pascal+Bouvier">Pascal Bouvier</a> is co-founder of Middlegame along with <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Michael+Meyer">Michael Meyer</a> and <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Patrick+Pinschmidt">Patrick Pinschmidt</a>, formerly a deputy assistant secretary at the US department of treasury where he served as the first executive director of the financial stability oversight council.</p>
      <p>Mr Pinschmidt said the fund had already made its first few representative investments in Britain. He said it was keen to back Irish fintechs too.</p>
      <p>“Our job is to help connect the best and most promising startups with a broader network of critical business partners and new clients – as well as bring new sources of international capital into the Irish market,” he said.</p>
      <p>Middlegame partners have invested over $300 million in early stage financial services companies over the past decade including <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Ripple">Ripple</a>, <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Tandem+Bank">Tandem Bank</a>, SimpleSurance, <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Coverhound">Coverhound</a> and CompareAsia.</p>
      <p>The first companies to receive investment under the new fund include Nivaura, which recently raised $20 million in a fundraise led by the London <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Stock+Exchange">Stock Exchange</a> Group. Others include Railsbank and Gardenia Technologies.</p>
      <p>The Washington-headquartered VC teamed up with marketing and communication agency Farvest earlier this year to hold a fintech-focused accelerator in Luxembourg and Dublin.</p>
      <p>More than 100 applications were made for that accelerator, whose local partners included <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=Enterprise+Ireland">Enterprise Ireland</a>, Fintech and <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=Payments+Association+Ireland">Payments Association Ireland</a>, Banking and Payments Federation Ireland, and <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Stripe">Stripe</a>, the company founded by Limerick-born brothers Patrick and <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=John+Collison">John Collison</a>.</p>
      <p>“The Ireland fintech ecosystem is very attractive to Middlegame. The business-to-business focus of many startups offering technology solutions to financial institutions here is a strong fit with our key investment themes: B2B, back-office, regtech, capital markets and deeptech,” said Mr Pinschmidt.</p>
      <p>“Further, many Irish startups are eager to partner with investors that can help them access the US market, and other potential partners across Europe. Ireland has a great infrastructure via legacy financial services and technology operations, but that can only take a start-up with broader growth ambitions so far,” he added.</p>
