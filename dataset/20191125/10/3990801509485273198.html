        <i>Welcome to CHEAP, our series about things that are good, but most of all, cheap. CHEAP!</i>
      </p>
      <p>I’m a fan of tablets. There’s something about their notepad size and large screen that makes me feel like I’m a professional on some sort of futuristic space ship.</p>
      <p>Despite this, there is a downside in the real world though: what do you use them for?</p>
      <p>While tablets are nice to have, I’ve never found them to be a <i>must. </i>Phones are more portable, and laptops are more powerful, kinda leaving much of the technology in a weird grey area.</p>
      <p>But… this changes with price. For me, spending $500 or more on a tablet seems a bit much. But when it drops substantially below that? Well, then things start to get a lot more interesting.</p>
      <p>You know, say something like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XL7G4H6/">the latest Apple iPad for only $250</a>. That’s a $79 or 24-percent saving on its list price. I mean, at that cost, it’d be ridiculous if you <i>didn’t</i> pick one up.</p>
      <p>All this is made even juicier due to Apple recently releasing iPadOS, which could change how you use a tablet altogether. Have a gander at the features here:</p>

      <p>So, let’s say you’re on the fence. How can the latest iPad fit into your day-to-day life? Well, there <i>are</i> a few things that the tablet really excels at.</p>
      <p>For example, it’s perfect for watching TV shows or movies on transport, as it’s far less bulky than a laptop. It’s also a brilliant machine if you’re into reading digital comics.</p>
      <p>Media-aside, the iPad can also function as a great extra business device, making sending emails and Slack messages slick.</p>
      <p>Anyway, in my experience, the iPad is best tablet on the market. If I was going to recommend one of the devices to someone, it’d most likely be Apple’s.</p>
      <p>So, head on over here and pick up <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XL7G4H6/">the latest iPad for only $250</a>. Who knows how long stocks will last at that price.</p>
