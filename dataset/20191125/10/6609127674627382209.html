      <p>Glasgow Sheriff Court heard that between January 2015 and March 2017 Laurie stashed 362 items in his locker.</p>
      <p>When his home and car were then searched a further 932 letters and packages were discovered.</p>
      <p>The items recovered by police included IKEA cutlery, a watch and polling cards.</p>
      <p>Laurie said he had opened four of the parcels out of curiosity.</p>

        <figcaption>Laurie was hit with a community payback order at Glasgow Sheriff Court</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>He claimed he did not deliver the mail because of time constraints, but did not inform his line manager of this.</p>
      <p>He pled guilty to intentionally delaying or opening mail meant to be delivered in the south side of Glasgow.</p>
      <p>Laurie also admitted stealing a quantity of postal packets.</p>
      <p>He was ordered to perform 120 hours of unpaid work by Sheriff Andrew Cubie.</p>
      <p>Laurie was put on a community payback order for two years and ordered to be supervised by social workers.</p>
      <p>The court heard that police were contacted by the delivery manager and an investigation was launched.</p>
      <p>Prosecutor Amy Hunter said: “Officers attended at Laurie’s home and conducted a search of his property and vehicles.</p>
      <p>“Packets were recovered from the accused in a vehicle belonging to the accused, the living room, bedroom and kitchen.”</p>
      <p>Laurie told police that he had opened four items “out of curiosity.”</p>
      <p>Miss Hunter added: “He said he didn't deliver the parcels as he was late and didn’t advise his manager.</p>
      <p>“He said he was intending to deliver as much as he could.”</p>
      <p>Laurie said he would 'have disposed of' polling cards which were found in his living room.</p>
      <p>Lawyer, Jack Brown, defending, said: “He isn’t a dishonest man and was dealing with difficulties in his life at that time.”</p>
