      <p>Turkey has begun testing the S-400 missile defence systems that it purchased from Russia this summer, the Milliyet daily cited an unnamed source as saying on Monday.</p>
      <p>The source added that the Ankara Governorate earlier announced that the military will fly its fighter jets near the Turkish capital to test the S-400’s radar systems in the next few days.</p>
      <p>“Within the scope of some projects carried out in coordination with the Presidency of Defence Industries, F-16 aircraft and other aircraft belonging to the [Turkish] Air Force will carry out low and high altitude test flights on Monday and Tuesday in the skies of Ankara,” the governorate said.</p>

        <b>US Urges Turkey ‘to Destroy’ S-400s</b>
      </p>
      <p>The statement comes after a senior US State Department official called on Turkish authorities to stop using the S-400s, saying that “there is room for Turkey to come back to the table” to get Ankara back into the US’ F-35 stealth fighter programme.</p>
      <p>“They know that to make this work they need to either destroy or return or somehow get rid of the S-400,” the official told reporters at last week’s briefing.<br/>It was preceded by Turkish Defence Minister Hulusi Akar stating that his country is going to activate and make use of the S-400 air defences.</p>
      <p>“The S-400 will be functioning. At the moment, Turkish military personnel are undergoing training on the use of the S-400s. After this is concluded, the planned [use of the S-400s] will start. Do not doubt it,” he pointed out.</p>

        <b>Washington, Ankara Lock Horns Over S-400</b>
      </p>
      <p>Earlier this year, Washington announced its decision to suspend Turkey’s participation in the international F-35 programme over Ankara’s purchase of the S-400s, adding that the country would be completely removed from the project by late March 2020. Under the programme, Turkey ordered more than 100 F-35 fighter jets.</p>
      <p>The US claims that the S-400 systems are incompatible with NATO’s air defence weapons and may compromise the operations of the F-35 fighter jets. Washington has repeatedly threatened to slap sanctions on Ankara over its purchase of the S-400s.</p>
