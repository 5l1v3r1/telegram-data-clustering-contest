      <h1>Brian Moore condemns 'dross' served up at Welsh European encounter as 'short-changing' fans</h1>
      <h2>Former England star says something has to be done about the Challenge Cup</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T10:56:56+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 10:56</time> by <a rel="author">Simon Thomas</a></address>
      <p>Brian Moore has hit out at the “dross served up” at the Arms Park over the weekend amid a damning assessment of the second-tier European Challenge Cup.</p>
      <p>Leicester put out a second string for <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/rugby/rugby-news/cardiff-blues-leicester-live-score-17306224">the clash with Cardiff Blues</a> , opting to rest their big names ahead of next Saturday’s English Premiership derby against Northampton.</p>
      <p>And the Blues were not allowed to field World Cup stars Josh Adams, Tomos Williams and Dillon Lewis due to the WRU rest policy.</p>
      <p>The end result was a poor quality contest which the Tigers won 14-11 via the last kick of the game.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rugby-union/2019/11/25/something-needs-done-europes-secondary-cup-clubs-view-irritant/">Writing in The Telegraph,</a> former England and Lions hooker Moore used the Pool 5 fixture to illustrate the problems with the Challenge Cup.</p>
      <p>“If you had the misfortune to watch that game, you will have seen a handful of Cardiff’s best and almost none of the Tigers’ star players,” he said.</p>
      <p>“If you bill this as a bona fide European Cup tie, you are short-changing paying fans, sponsors and broadcasters, all of whom pay to support rugby, when you produce the sort of dross served up last Saturday night at the Arms Park.</p>
      <p>“If one of these games is your first experience of rugby, as a fan and especially a sponsor who has invited customers, you are going to think long and hard about repeating the venture.</p>

      <p>Moore added: “It is clear that European Professional Club Rugby is going to have to do something about the Challenge Cup.</p>
      <p>“Rather like football’s Europa Cup, this is now seen as an irritant to many of the qualifiers and certainly of secondary priority to success or survival in the relevant domestic leagues.</p>
      <p>“The Challenge Cup already gives one team automatic qualification for the Champions Cup, but if you increased this to two places, to try to incentivise participants, which of the Pro14, Top 14 or Premiership competitions will give up one of their qualifying places?</p>
      <p>“With domestic survival an absolute in England and France, because of the huge financial ramifications of relegation, would even that incentive be effective for their clubs?”</p>
      <p>Looking at the situation overall, Moore said: “It is safe to say the first two rounds of the Champions and Challenge Cups, usually the jewels in the crown of European club rugby, have been underwhelming."</p>
