      <p>Uber has branded the decision to ban the popular taxi service in the capital as ‘extraordinary and wrong’ and has vowed to fight.</p>
      <p>Transport for London <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/25/uber-banned-london-midnight-losing-licence-battle-11213996/">has stripped the taxi app of its licence</a> to operate in the capital from midnight on Tuesday over safety breaches and a ‘pattern of failures’.</p>
      <p>The government body said Uber had changed its system and found numerous examples of passengers being put at risk, leading to the decision to refuse the renewal of its licence.</p>
      <p>It added that it wasn’t sure these issues wouldn’t arise again in the future.</p>
      <p>But Uber has insisted it will appeal the decision, adding that it had made several changes in recent years, making safety one of its main priorities.</p>
      <p>Uber’s regional general manager for northern and eastern Europe Jamie Heywood said it would be business as usual today until it ‘resolves’ the situation.</p>

      <p>He said: ‘TfL’s decision not to renew Uber’s licence in London is extraordinary and wrong, and we will appeal.</p>

      <p>‘We have fundamentally changed our business over the last two years and are setting the standard on safety. TfL found us to be a fit and proper operator just two months ago, and we continue to go above and beyond.</p>
      <p>‘On behalf of the 3.5 million riders and 45,000 licensed drivers who depend on Uber in London, we will continue to operate as normal and will do everything we can to work with TfL to resolve this situation.’</p>
      <p>TfL said: ‘A key issue identified was that a change to Uber’s systems allowed unauthorised drivers to upload their photos to other Uber driver accounts.</p>
      <p>‘This allowed them to pick up passengers as though they were the booked driver, which occurred in at least 14,000 trips – putting passenger safety and security at risk.</p>
      <p>‘This means all the journeys were uninsured and some passenger journeys took place with unlicensed drivers, one of which had previously had their licence revoked by TfL.’</p>
      <p>But TfL said if Uber does appeal, the company will have to take their case to court and effectively prove it has put robust measures in place to safeguard passengers.</p>
      <p>Helen Chapman, director of licensing, regulation and charging at TfL, said: ‘If they choose to appeal, Uber will have the opportunity to publicly demonstrate to a magistrate whether it has put in place sufficient measures to ensure potential safety risks to passengers are eliminated.</p>

      <p>‘If they do appeal, Uber can continue to operate and we will closely scrutinise the company to ensure the management has robust controls in place to ensure safety is not compromised during any changes to the app.’</p>
