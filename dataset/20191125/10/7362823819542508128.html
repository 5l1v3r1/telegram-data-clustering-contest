He doubled down on the allegation in a statement apologizing for his actions, saying “I know what I heard.” Garrett’s suspension was upheld.</p>

      <p>“It’s totally untrue. I couldn’t believe it. I couldn’t believe it, and I couldn’t believe that he would go that route after the fact. But it is what it is and I think I’ve moved on. One day it was tough, but moved on. We’re good to go now,” Rudolph said, according to the <a href="https://www.cleveland.com/browns/2019/11/mason-rudolph-on-myles-garretts-racial-slur-accusation-its-totally-untrue-i-couldnt-believe-hed-go-that-route.html">Cleveland Plain-Dealer</a>.</p>

      <p>The quarterback added: “Absolutely not. I did not [use a slur] … There was nothing. Not even close.”</p>
      <p>Rudolph was fined $50,000 for his role in the brawl.</p>
      <p>The controversy over the allegations may have helped make his Sunday one to forget.</p>
