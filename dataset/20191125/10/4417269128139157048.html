      <h1>Amanzimtoti Tablers spread some festive joy</h1>
      <h2>RT Amanzimtoti thanks all the sponsors.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T10:00:23+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 10:00</time> by <a rel="author">Earl Baillache</a></address>
      <p>Round Table (RT) Amanzimtoti hosted the team and residents from Pevensy Place in conjunction with Round Table Sani in Winkelspruit from 15 to 17 November. Pevensy Place is a specialised home based in Underberg that caters for cerebral palsy sufferers and mentally challenged adults.</p>
      <p>This project is fondly known by the RT team as ‘Pevensy to the sea’ and it has been running for four years. Residents and staff were hosted at the Christian Camp in Winkelspruit. Helped by sponsorships through various local businesses, the RT clubs provided all the food, cooldrinks and entertainment for the residents on their annual holiday away from home, just before Christmas.</p>
      <p>“On the Saturday morning the teams took everyone from Pevensy to Amanzimtoti Main Beach to swim in the public pool and later residents enjoyed a fun evening of dancing and partying together. On the Sunday we took them to the rock pools at Baggies Beach and then in the afternoon each guest was treated to an exhilarating ride on a quad bike,” said Round Table Amanzimtoti president, Terence Hartwanger.</p>
      <p>After a braai, everyone enjoyed a nativity play put together by the committed staff of Pevensy with assistance from the Tablers and great laughs were had by all.</p>
