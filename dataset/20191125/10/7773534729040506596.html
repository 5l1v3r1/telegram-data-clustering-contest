        <b>Roche says its combination of immunotherapy Tecentriq and older cancer drug Avastin has improved overall survival in liver cancer, the first regimen to achieve that objective in ten years.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The top-line <u><a href="http://www.pmlive.com/pharma_news/roche_eyes_filings_for_tecentriqavastin_combo_in_liver_cancer_1313941">result</a></u> of the IMbrave150 study was reported last month, but Roche has now detailed the underlying data, revealing that Tecentriq (atezolizumab) plus Avastin (bevacizumab) reduced the risk of death by 42% compared to Bayer’s Nexavar (sorafenib) when given as a first-line therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients ineligible for surgery.</p>
      <p>Progression-free survival was also improved to 6.8 months from 4.3 months with Nexavar – a 41% improvement over the standard first-line option – and according to Roche IMbrave150 is the first phase 3 cancer immunotherapy study to show an improvement in overall survival in this setting. The results were presented at the ESMO Asia congress in Singapore.</p>
      <p>Roche’s chief medical officer Levi Garraway – who <u><a href="http://www.pmlive.com/pharma_news/lillys_levi_garraway_will_replace_sandra_horning_as_roche_cmo_1298155">took over</a></u> from Sandra Horning on 1 October – said the company was working with regulators to bring the regimen to regulatory agencies around the world as quickly as possible.</p>
      <p>HCC could be another important indication for Tecentriq as it plays catch-up in the cancer immunotherapy market with Merck &amp; Co/MSD’s Keytruda (pembrolizumab) and Bristol-Myers Squibb’s Opdivo (nivolumab), and Roche has a chance of pipping its rivals to the first-line HCC market.</p>
      <p>It’s also another endorsement for the Tecentriq/Avastin combination, which is viewed as a key pillar of Roche’s strategy to expand the use of its checkpoint inhibitor into new types of cancer.</p>
      <p>Merck is testing Keytruda alongside partner Eisai’s kinase inhibitor Lenvima (lenvatinib) – already-approved for first-line HCC – in the Leap-002 trial, picking up a breakthrough designation from the FDA for this use in July.</p>
      <p>BMS meanwhile reported data a few months ago from the CheckMate 459 trial which showed that Opdivo as a monotherapy improved on Nexavar in terms of response rates, but wasn’t able to achieve a significant improvement over Bayer’s drug on overall survival.</p>
      <p>The company is also testing a combination of Opdivo and low-dose Yervoy (ipilimumab) – its CTLA4 inhibitor – in previously-untreated HCC in the CheckMate 9DW trial which uses Nexavar and Lenvima as comparator drugs.</p>
      <p>More than 750,000 people worldwide are diagnosed with HCC every year, making it the most common form of liver cancer, and almost half of all cases occur in China.</p>
      <p>The Tecentriq/Avastin combination is already approved for non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) without EGFR or ALK mutations, and as a triple therapy with chemotherapy for EGFR or ALK mutation-positive non-squamous NSCLC.</p>
      <p>While it still has a long way to go to challenge Keytruda and Opdivo in sales terms, Tecentriq has seen its growth accelerate on the back of recent approvals, rising 146% to around $1.3bn in the first nine months of this year.</p>
