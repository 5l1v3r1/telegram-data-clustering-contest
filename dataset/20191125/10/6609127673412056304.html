        <b>A TOP Scots cop is taking legal against the force after being demoted for making sectarian remarks at work.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ruth Gilfillan, then a detective chief Constable at Police Scotland's National Rape Taskforce and National Human Trafficking Unit, made a joke about refusing to eat a Celtic birthday cake.</p>

      <p>She also made comments about children being at risk of abuse in Catholic schools.</p>
      <p>Gilfillan was arrested at work and although the procurator fiscal decided not to prosecute she was demoted three ranks to constable after an internal investigation.</p>
      <p>This resulted in a significant drop in salary.</p>
      <p>Now <a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/18057393.police-chief-takes-legal-action-demotion-sectarian-comments/">the Herald</a> reports she has lodged a claim for disability discrimination against Police Scotland, who she no longer works for.</p>
      <p>She claims she was suffering from depression at the time of the comments.</p>
      <p>A preliminary judgement from the tribunal states: “The claimant has accepted that she made inappropriate comments of a sectarian nature to some of her colleagues on 20 August 2015.</p>

      <p>“These resulted in a criminal investigation (where no proceedings were ultimately taken against the claimant) and a disciplinary process, the outcome of which was demotion to the rank of constable.”</p>
      <p>The judgement found in her favour, ruling that she did have a disability at the time.</p>
      <p>It also offered an insight into the pressure the force was under at that time, with Ms Gilfillan describing her workload as “horrendous”.</p>
      <p>And the force and chief constable backed that up, admitting pressure of senior officers was "punishing".</p>
      <p>Employment judge Sandy Meiklejohn said:”I am satisfied that the claimant was from late 2013 struggling to cope with an unsustainable workload in an environment where the culture was that ‘you just got on with it’ rather than complaining and where, in any event, there was little or no prospect of further resources becoming available to relieve the pressure.”</p>
      <p>The tribunal also heard that Ms Gilfillan suffered an assault in 2003 and was subjected to “poor treatment” by her sergeant at the time.</p>
      <p>she was also subjected to “malicious rumours about her alleged association with a criminal element from where she had been brought up” and an investigation was carried out.</p>
      <p>Despite the rumours being found to be "malicious", Gilfillan was still moved department, which she said "killed" her.</p>
      <p>She claimed that these issues contributed to her mental health problems.</p>
      <p>The judgement states: “The claimant described herself as becoming quieter and more insular and feeling down or angry.”</p>
      <p>She requested a transfer to another department on three separate occasions but never received one.</p>
      <p>Her psychiatrist said that she suffered from “moderate depressive disorder” at the time of the incident, evidence accepted by the judge.</p>
      <p>This led to her suffering from a low mood, disturbed sleep, fatigue and exhaustion, anxiety and irritability.</p>
      <p>The judge added: “Having looked at each element of the statutory definition and considered the guidance, I decided that the claimant was disabled... as at 20 August 2015.”</p>
      <p>A Police Scotland spokeswoman said: “As proceedings are ongoing we are unable to comment.”</p>
