      <p>Nigerian Instagram celebrity Ismaila Mustapha, also known as Mompha, is in court on Monday for arraignment by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC).</p>
      <p>Mompha was arrested on October 18 at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja on his way to Dubai, the United Arab Emirates “following series of actionable intelligence reports linking him to organised transnational cyber fraud and money laundering,” EFCC said.</p>
      <p>The commission said Mompha will be arraigned on a 14-count charge of cyber fraud and money laundering.</p>
      <p>EFCC boss Ibrahim Magu said the arrest of the social media celebrity is a “landmark achievement’.</p>
      <p>“I am sure you will be greatly shocked to know that five wristwatches valued at over ₦60million were recovered from the suspected internet fraudster, Mompha, at the point of arrest,” Magu said at an interactive session with stakeholders at the Lagos Zonal office of the Commission on October 31.</p>
      <p>“Investigation has also revealed that he operates 51 bank accounts in Nigeria with which he acquires properties in Dubai and had laundered about ₦14billion through a firm known as Ismalob Global Investments Limited.”</p>
