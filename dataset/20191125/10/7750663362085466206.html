      <h1>Jurgen Klopp was unconcerned by Roberto Firmino's goal drought</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jurgen-klopp/"><b>Jurgen Klopp</b></a> was not worried about <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/roberto-firmino/"><b>Roberto Firmino</b></a>'s goal drought and admitted it had not even crossed his mind.</h2>

      <p>The Brazilian hit an 85th-minute winner for the Reds at <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/crystal-palace/"><b>Crystal Palace</b></a> on Saturday to score for the first time since a 2-1 victory away to Chelsea on September 22.</p>
      <p>Firmino had gone two months without a goal – a run of nine matches – but picked a perfect time to find his shooting boots again, which ensured the Merseyside outfit are eight clear at the top of the Premier League table.</p>

      <p>"Bobby's work rate is incredible," Klopp said. "We expect a lot from the boys and I am completely fine with what I saw. For him, it is wonderful he finally gets the reward.</p>
      <p>"We didn't speak. I wouldn't have a clue when he scored last time and I never thought about it.</p>
      <p>"Who scores the goals, it is absolutely not important and you would have to ask him how he felt, but I didn't see anything (to suggest he felt anxious)."</p>

      <p>Sadio Mane had put Liverpool ahead four minutes into the second half at Selhurst Park, but Wilfried Zaha equalised for the hosts in the 82nd minute.</p>
      <p>Thankfully for Klopp's men it was Firmino who was on hand to fire home after a goalmouth scramble from a corner and ensure the goal conceded was not too costly.</p>
      <p>Liverpool have now gone nine matches in all competitions without keeping a clean sheet and needed to strike late in London to remain unbeaten, which has happened regularly during the last two months.</p>

      <p>Klopp added: "We conceded a goal, nobody wanted that, but I felt in that period it was not a surprise when they scored.</p>
      <p>"But we knew as well we would probably get a chance and we had to use it, if we don't use it we cannot take it for granted.</p>
      <p>"I don't like to talk about it (scoring late), but I understand you ask it. We are not like 'seven minutes to go, let's start winning the game now' so we don't think about it."</p>
      <p>Liverpool have only dropped points once in the Premier League this season and the German admitted the start to the campaign has exceeded his own expectations.</p>

      <p>"We are four years together," Klopp said. "I know a lot about my team, we just know want we want and we know what we have to do for it.</p>
      <p>"We are not the only team who knows that, but for us we know it and it's so difficult to get 37 points from 13 games.</p>
      <p>"If you asked me is that possible, I would say so, but now we are here, so we are critical of the performances and saying we can do better. It's all true.</p>
      <p>"At 3 o'clock we had to be there against a team that is really good, playing at home in a good stadium and they (Palace) fight.</p>
      <p>"We start fighting as well and have to be ready and we were again so big, big credit for my boys, but the next one (Napoli) is waiting."</p>
