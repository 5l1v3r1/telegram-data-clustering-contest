      <p>A LORRY DRIVER has pleaded guilty to plotting to assist illegal immigration in the case of 39 migrants found dead in Essex last month. </p>
      <p>Maurice Robinson, 25, who was allegedly part of a global smuggling ring, had been charged with the manslaughter of a group of men, women and children found dead in a refrigerated trailer.</p>
      <p>The bodies of eight females and 31 males were discovered in the trailer attached to his Scania cab in an industrial park in Grays, Essex early on 23 October.</p>
      <p>The victims were later identified as coming from various provinces of Vietnam with the youngest being two boys aged 15.</p>
      <p>Robinson, who is known as Mo, faces 39 counts of manslaughter, conspiracy to traffic people and conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration.</p>
      <p>He was also charged with acquiring criminal property and one count of concealing criminal property.</p>
      <p>The defendant, of Laurel Drive in Craigavon in Northern Ireland, appeared at the Old Bailey via video link from Belmarsh prison for a plea hearing this morning.</p>
      <p>Wearing a light blue sweater and tan trousers, he spoke to confirm his identity and British nationality.</p>
      <p>During the hearing before Mr Justice Edis, he admitted conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration between 1 May 2018 and 24 October 2019.</p>
      <p>The charge states that he plotted with others to do “an act or series of acts which facilitated the commission of a breach of immigration law by various persons”.</p>
      <p>He also admitted acquiring criminal property – namely cash – on the same dates.</p>
      <p>Robinson was not asked to enter pleas to other charges, including 39 counts of manslaughter.</p>
      <p>The details of that charge state that he “arranged or facilitated the travel of other persons into the UK with a view to their being exploited”.</p>
      <p>The defendant was remanded into custody until a further hearing on 13 December.</p>
      <p>Christopher Kennedy, 23, is due to appear at Chelmsford Magistrates’ Court on Monday accused of human trafficking offences.</p>
      <p>He was arrested in the early hours of Friday morning on the M40.</p>
      <p>Kennedy, from Darkley, Co Armagh, is charged with conspiracy to arrange or facilitate the travel of people with a view to exploitation and conspiracy to facilitate the commission of a breach of UK immigration law.</p>
