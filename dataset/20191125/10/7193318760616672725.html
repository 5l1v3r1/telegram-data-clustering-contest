      <p>Earlier this month, a special agent with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration asked the court for a search warrant to track the AT&amp;T cell phone location of an alleged Oklahoma drug dealer who was communicating with a confidential source inside the state prison system.</p>
      <p>A lieutenant with the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation asked for a search warrant to examine the Google Mail account associated with an Oklahoma City company under investigation for attempted fraud.</p>
      <p>A detective with the Oklahoma City Police Department asked for a search warrant to seize information from the Facebook account of a man who allegedly threatened a murder victim in the days leading up to the homicide.</p>
      <p>In each case, and thousands like them every year in Oklahoma, a judge approved the warrants.</p>
      <p>Many alleged criminals no longer leave a trail of evidence. They casually carry the evidence on their cell phones. For investigators, access to a digital archive of drug deals, death threats and other crime plots is just one search warrant away.</p>
      <p>
        <b>‘Freak out when the government does it’</b>
      </p>
      <p>“Evidence is evidence whether it's a bank robber writing a note and passing it to the teller, a gun at the scene of a crime or location data that your cell phone is picking up,” said Shawn Tuma, a Dallas-based cyber security attorney. “It’s all evidence. We’re not writing demand notes anymore. We’re writing emails saying ‘pay up or else.’”</p>
      <p>For all the sharing on social media and texting that Americans do, Tuma said people still express shock at how much access authorities have to their phones and digital profiles.</p>
      <p>“People get so upset when they hear Dallas-Fort Worth is using facial recognition technology for flights, yet at the same time, they are Snapchatting their face with reindeer antlers,” Tuma said. “It’s the same technology and we’re doing it all day on Snapchat, but we freak out when the government does it.”</p>
      <p>The Fourth Amendment protects Americans’ right “to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.”</p>
      <p>Part of the public’s consternation over law enforcement probing people’s digital lives — and the relative ease with which they are allowed to do so — is the lack of knowledge surrounding court rulings and the Fourth Amendment, according to one criminal justice expert.</p>
      <p>The evolution of law enforcement’s authority in this area may surprise people, said Christopher Hill, an assistant professor of sociology at the University of Oklahoma whose research areas include criminology, criminal justice and juvenile justice.</p>
      <p>“Courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court, have been dealing with the application of the Fourth Amendment since at least 1914 in a case called Weeks v. U.S.,” Hill said. “From brief stop and frisk encounters, to searches and seizures at public schools, there has been a lot of court activity surrounding police power and the Fourth Amendment.”</p>
      <p>Hill pointed to three other notable cases that illuminate that activity.</p>
      <p>In a 1998 appeal case for an insider securities trading conviction — United States v. Smith — the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit decided evidentiary issues involving the illegal interception of voicemail.</p>
      <p>The court said in its ruling that the intersection of two laws — the 1968 Wiretap Act and the 1986 Stored Communications Act — “is a complex, often convoluted area of the law. This case turns, at least in part, on issues at the very heart of that intersection.”</p>
      <p>In a 2007 appeal case for a drug deal conviction — United States v. Finley — the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit examined whether a lower court erred by denying the defendant’s motion to suppress text messages and call records recovered in a warrantless, post-arrest search of his cell phone.</p>
      <p>The court said in its ruling that although the defendant had standing to challenge the retrieval of the call records and text messages from his cell phone, “we conclude that the search was lawful.”</p>
      <p>In a 2008 appeal case for a child pornography conviction — United States v Perrine — the Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit considered “peer-to-peer” computer software and internet privacy.</p>
      <p>The court said in its ruling because the peer-to-peer software permitted anyone else on the internet to have access to certain folders in the defendant’s computer, which could expose his subscriber information to outsiders, the defendant shouldn’t have had any expectation of privacy in his computer and its contents.</p>
      <p>“Thus,” the court said, “Perrine has no Fourth​ Amendment privacy expectation in the subscriber information he gave to Yahoo!​ and Cox.”</p>
      <p>Hill, the OU professor, said the Finley and Perrine cases especially give a post-9/11 context for understanding Fourth Amendment powers the police have, though exceptions to warrant requirements were happening long before then.</p>
      <p>“The type and complexity of cyber crimes being committed changes, so laws and practices seem to be a step behind,” he said.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Smoke signals</b>
      </p>
      <p>When it comes to the law and cyber privacy, it’s better to send a memo than an email, said Tuma, the lawyer, with a laugh. It’s better to text than to send a memo. It’s better to call than to text. It’s better to have a face-to-face conversation than a phone call.</p>
      <p>“We’re going to get back to smoke signals,” he said. “What's the best protection of all? Don’t put it in writing.”</p>
      <p>Some crooks are brazen enough to post photographic evidence of their crimes on social media, Tuma said. But if even Joe Criminal didn’t show off that stolen car on Instagram, police will still come looking for his social media accounts, emails, text messages and phone records.</p>
      <p>“I really can't envision a case these days where that wouldn't be the first thing they think of,” Tuma said. “The warrant process is the due process of law that's giving the legal authorities the rights to do that. Probable cause is the standard for the warrant and the judge goes through the process of approving it.”</p>
      <p>We’re living in a brave new world of digital sleuthing, Tuma said.</p>
      <p>“We try to maintain what privacy we can, but you can't envision a crazy enough scenario for the future that's not going to be reality,” he said.</p>
