      <h3>THE Philippine National Police leadership yesterday vowed to pursue a relentless war on drugs nationwide particularly targeting “high-value targets” with officers under orders to ensure human rights protection at all times but defend themselves from armed drug dealers who put up a fight.</h3>
      <p>The vow was made by the PNP leadership headed by its Officer-in-Charge Lieutenant General Archie Francisco F. Gamboa in the wake of President Duterte’s decision to fire Vice President Leni Robredo as co-chairperson of the Inter-Agency Committee on Anti-Illegal Drugs or ICAD. Gen. Gamboa has ordered in particular the PNP Drug Enforcement Group headed by Colonel Romeo M. Caramat Jr. to pursue their ongoing operations against “HVTs” or the so-called major players in the country’s yearly multi-billion peso drug industry.</p>
      <p>“The PNP respects the decision of the President terminating the services of Vice President Leni Robredo as ICAD co-chair. The PNP leadership also assures that the crackdown against ‘high-value’ drug targets will remain relentless following the rule of law and with utmost respect for human rights,” said PNP spokesman, Brigadier General Bernard M. Banac.</p>
      <p>Banac emphasized that the President’s decision to fire Mrs. Robredo will not affect their war on drugs just as it was not hampered by the entry of the Vice-President into the ICAD two weeks ago.</p>
      <p>“Hindi naman ito nakakaapekto sa ating patuloy na kampanya laban sa ilegal na droga. Kahit man siya ay wala na, kinonsidera natin ang kaniyang mga naging pahayag at tumugma ito sa direksyon din ng PNP na gawing mas transparent ang ating kampanya laban sa ilegal na droga,” the PNP spokesman said.</p>
      <p>President Duterte last week gave Gen. Gamboa until December 10 to finish the procurement of Body-Worn Cameras which will be used by the police in the conduct of anti-narcotics operations, anti-crime raids, checkpoints and combat operations in Metro Manila and other parts of the country.</p>
      <p>Officials said that the Vice-President apparently saw “the writing on the wall” on Wednesday last week  when she declined to see a list of ‘HVTs about to be presented to her by the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency saying she wants to be clarified first on the scope of her authority as co-chairman of ICAD.</p>
      <p>A highly-reliable source said that top PDEA officials led by her ICAD co-chairman, Director General Aaron N. Aquino were about to present the top secret list to the Vice-President but she herself stopped them from showing her the document at the PDEA board room.</p>
      <p>Shortly after, the Vice-President went to the Dangerous Drugs Board office where, after a meeting with top DDB officials, she confirmed that she declined a classified briefing from the PDEA top brass until President Duterte clarified the scope of her authority.</p>
      <p>“I refused kasi sabi ko hihintayin ko muna yung sagot ni presidente sa aking clarification. Yung ayoko yung ma-accuse ako na lumalampas ako sa aking mandato,” she said.</p>
      <p>She also said that President Duterte should just tell her to leave as co-chair of ICADif he was not trusting her.</p>
      <p>“Dapat direchuhin na lang ako. Direcho naman akong kausap... Kung ayaw na niya, kung nagkamali sya sa pag-appoint sa kin at gusto niyang bawiin, sabihin lang niya. Kasi ako, madali akong kausap,” she said.</p>
      <p>Gen. Gamboa earlier said it would be good for the Vice-President to focus on improving the government’s advocacy and rehabilitation program when it comes to fighting drugs and just leave the arrest and prosecution of offenders to the subject experts which are the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency, the PNP and the Department of Justice.</p>
      <p>Lt. Gen. Gamboa previously pointed out that the Vice-President, being  Aquino’s co-chairperson  the Inter-Agency Committee on Anti-Illegal Drugs (ICAD), should instead focus on the drug war’s aspect of advocacy and rehabilitation.</p>
      <p>“Would it really matter who are on the list? Kaya nga palagi naming sinasabi... ako ha I’m already suggesting na anyway the entire ICAD is composed of four different sub-committees,” he pointed out.</p>
