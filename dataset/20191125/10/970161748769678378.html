      <p>One of R Kelly’s live-in ‘girlfriends’ has accused the star of locking her up and forcing her into having two abortions.</p>
      <p>Joycelyn Savage, 24, has been living with Kelly, 52, for the past four years and has strenuously defended the star amidst allegations of sexual abuse against him.</p>
      <p>However, Savage has now set up a Patreon account to share her story, alleging that Kelly – who has been charged with numerous counts of aggravated sexual assault, aggravated criminal sexual abuse, kidnapping, forced labour and sexual exploitation of a child in two states- kept her ‘locked up like a damn animal’.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/r-kellys-girlfriend-joycelyn-savage-speaks-out-on-patreon-he-kept-me-locked-up-like-some-damn-animal">In posts reported by the Daily Beast,</a> Joycelyn wrote on the paid membership platform: ‘I kept thinking to myself he just wants me to be safe, he wants the best for me he thinks someone is going to take me away from him.</p>

      <p>‘But it was me being delusional why would someone claim to love to keep me locked up like some damn animal.’</p>

      <p>Joycelyn alleges that after she met Kelly at a concert in 2015, when she was 17, she became a victim of the Ignition singer’s ‘controlling behaviour’ when she moved into his home.</p>
      <p>She alleged that on two occasions, she became pregnant but was forced to have abortions at Kelly’s home.</p>
      <p>Joycelyn wrote: ‘Eventually, I ended up getting an abortion. I was forced to get the surgery done at his house.</p>
      <p>‘He didn’t want me going to the hospital because news would break out.’</p>

      <p>She also claimed that Kelly choked her until she blacked out after she failed to use his preferred names of ‘Master and Daddy’, writing: ‘I had bruises around my neck, and I was told by him to wear a turtle necks or a scarf to cover them up whenever he would take me out in public.</p>
      <p>‘I was frightened to tell anyone about this because of what he may do next.’</p>
      <p>Savage claims that the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2017/07/18/r-kellys-alleged-hostage-refutes-claims-i-am-not-being-brainwashed-6787393/">many interviews she did with TMZ</a>, defending the star, were set up, writing: ‘The only time he would care for me is when the media is making him seem bad and saying that I was kept for a hostage.’</p>
      <p>She also alleges that Kelly would urinate on her and other women without their consent.</p>

      <p>R Kelly’s attorney Steve Greenberg <a href="https://variety.com/2019/music/news/r-kelly-joycelyn-savage-speaks-out-victim-1203414308/">told Variety:</a> ‘It is unfortunate that Joycelyn now seeks to make money by exploiting her long time, loving relationship with Robert. Obviously if she were to tell the truth no one would pay so she has, unfortunately, chosen to regurgitate the stories and lies told by others for her own personal profit.</p>
      <p>‘We know the real facts, and it was not until the money ran out that she decided anything was wrong. Hopefully people will see it for the obvious profiteering it is.’</p>
      <p>R Kelly has denied allegations of sexual misconduct and has <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/08/02/r-kelly-pleads-not-guilty-sex-trafficking-child-pornography-charges-10508926/">pleaded not guilty in federal court.</a></p>
      <p>He is currently awaiting trial in Chicago after being denied bail.</p>
