      <p>Network Rail said ballast stones below the southbound line had subsided as a result and that engineers would have to assess the depth of the subsidence.</p>
      <p>The sinkhole came to the attention of rail staff at about 8.40am.</p>

      <p>ScotRail suspended all services between Aberdeen and Edinburgh after the sinkhole was discovered, although services from Perth to Edinburgh have been running as normal.</p>
      <p>Widespread disruption was predicted to last all day.</p>
      <p>A Network Rail spokesman said: “Our engineers are on-site working to assess the condition of the track and make repairs.</p>
      <p>“We understand the inconvenience this incident is causing to customers and will reopen the line as soon as it is safe to do so.”</p>
      <p>ScotRail said only one service would run from the Scots capital to Dundee on Monday evening – the 5.02pm from Edinburgh to Arbroath.</p>
      <p>The firm posted: “Our 5.02pm Edinburgh – Arbroath service is the only direct service to Dundee this evening. It will have four carriages and be extremely busy.</p>
      <p>“If you’re travelling to Inverkeithing, Kirkcaldy, Markinch or Ladybank, please take an alternative service if you possibly can.”</p>

      <p>He said station staff were very organised but warned of long queues to board the replacement buses.</p>
      <p>Passengers heading to Edinburgh and beyond faced delays of almost two hours before their journey finally got under way.</p>
      <p>As of Monday afternoon, some 31 ScotRail services were cancelled as a result of “urgent repairs” to the track.</p>
      <p>ScotRail described the disruption as “major”.</p>
      <p>A spokesman said: “We’re sorry to our customers who have experienced disruption to their journey today.</p>
      <p>“Engineers are working as quickly as possible to repair the sinkhole and get services back to normal.</p>
      <p>“Anyone delayed 30 minutes or more can claim money back through the Delay Repay Guarantee on our website or mobile app.”</p>
