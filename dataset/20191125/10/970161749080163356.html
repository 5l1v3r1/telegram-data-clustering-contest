      <p>Daenerys Targaryen’s controversial and fast descent into madness in <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/game-of-thrones/">Game Of Thrones</a> remains one of the most fought over moments in the final season.</p>
      <p>But in a new behind-the-scenes documentary, actress Emilia Clarke revealed how the Queen’s bloodthirsty reign of terror was triggered episodes before – and it all happened in the Battle of Winterfell.</p>
      <p>In a telling moment of things to come, the fearless leader decided to fight for her throne for the first time in the battle against the Night King and his army, but lost loved ones as she did so.</p>
      <p>Most notably, Dany’s losses included the ever faithful Jorah Mormont (Iain Glenn), who died defending her to the bitter end against the ice-cold foes who tried to kill her.</p>
      <p>Speaking in documentary When Winter Falls, focused entirely on the battle episode, Emilia explained to camera: ‘In the actual battle itself, Dany’s impatient to get in there. She’s like, gunning for a fight. She’s ready to take this guy down.</p>

      <p>‘She’s a fierce warrior, although you don’t see a lot of hand-to-hand combat with her, she’s ready to fight to the death.’</p>

      <p>In a tease of what’s to come, Emilia added: ‘Especially at this point, there’s a lot of anger – she’s got all of that in her to put into this fight.</p>
      <p>‘It’s not just the matter at hand, but I think because of everything at an emotional level that’s gone on, she’s able to go into her cold-blooded side.’</p>
      <p>Unfortunately for the queen, this is the start of her downfall. While she won the battle, she ultimately lost the war when she stormed King’s Landing and burned the city – and all its inhabitants – to the ground as she failed to reign herself back in.</p>

      <p>Barely able to touch the Iron Throne she had coveted for so long, the series ended with Jon Snow (Kit Harington) ending her life for the sake of a better world without bloodshed at her hand.</p>
      <p>Saying goodbye to the show, in another documentary released as part of the complete Game Of Thrones collection, out today, the actress praised the show, and Dany for making her who she is.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/25/emilia-clarke-fights-back-tears-as-she-admits-game-of-thrones-gave-her-identity-she-didnt-have-11210809/">In an emotional moment to the camera</a>, as she said goodbye to the Mother Of Dragons forever, she said: ‘What I realised the other day is the show has given me more than just a job, it’s literally given me a family, it’s given me an identity that I didn’t have.</p>

      <p>‘I didn’t think I’d ever be able to play someone like this and so she’s been such a saviour for me in so many ways.’</p>
