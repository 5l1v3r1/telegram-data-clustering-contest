      <p>L.A. Clippers baller Patrick Patterson is under fire for referring to Black women as "bulldogs" during an Instagram conversation. </p>
      <p>The conversation started after an Instagram follower stated that Patterson could never get his wife, Sarah Nasser, if he weren't in the NBA. Patterson responded by writing, "So I should settle for a bulldog and act like I’m happy with my life and preach 'keep it in your race' to the world as if Dr. King didn’t fight/die for equality, acceptance, all cultures loving one another, and no hate? No thanks. That maybe your life but I don’t want that for mine or my family. Color doesn’t matter. Wake up." </p>
      <p>Patterson was soon called out for his remarks, for which he apologized for on his page. He wrote, "My sincere apology to the individual and his family for the cruel comments we exchanged on that day long ago.." You can read the full apology above. </p>
