      <p>Lorry driver Maurice Robinson (25) who is accused over the deaths of 39 migrants, has pleaded guilty to plotting to assist illegal immigration.</p>
      <p>Maurice Robinson, known as Mo Robinson, who was allegedly part of a global smuggling ring, is charged with the manslaughter of a group of men, women and children found dead in a refrigerated trailer.</p>
      <p>The bodies of eight females and 31 males were discovered in the trailer attached to his Scania cab in an industrial park in Grays, Essex, on October 23.</p>
      <p>The victims were later identified as coming from various provinces of Vietnam, with the youngest being two boys aged 15.</p>
      <p>Robinson appeared at the Old Bailey via video link from Belmarsh prison for a plea hearing this morning.</p>
      <p>Wearing a light blue sweater and tan trousers, he spoke to confirm his identity and British nationality.</p>
      <p>During the hearing before Mr Justice Edis, he admitted conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration between May 1 2018 and October 24 2019.</p>
      <p>The charge states that he plotted with others to do "an act or series of acts which facilitated the commission of a breach of immigration law by various persons".</p>
      <p>He also admitted acquiring criminal property - namely cash - on the same dates.</p>
      <p>The defendant, of Laurel Drive in Craigavon, was not asked to enter pleas to other charges, including 39 counts of manslaughter.</p>
      <p>He is charged with conspiracy to commit human trafficking offences between May 1 2018 and October 24 2019.</p>
      <p>The details of that charge state that he "arranged or facilitated the travel of other persons into the UK with a view to their being exploited".</p>
      <p>He is also charged with transferring criminal property.</p>
      <p>The defendant was remanded into custody until a further hearing on December 13.</p>
