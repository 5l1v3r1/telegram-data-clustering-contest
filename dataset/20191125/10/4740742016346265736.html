      <p>Bath’s mysterious fifth general election candidate has finally been revealed - and he wants the UK to leave the solar system by 2028. </p>
      <p>Political satirist and artist Bill Blockhead follows in the tradition of protest candidates like Lord Buckethead, Mr Fishfinger and Screaming Lord Sutch. </p>
      <p>He is standing with the slogan “Don’t Vote for Bill, he’s a Blockhead”. </p>
      <p>The independent is up against Liberal Democrat Wera Hobhouse, Labour’s Mike Davies, Jimi Ogunnusi from the Brexit Party and Conservative candidate Annabel Tall.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Here is his full bio: </b>
      </p>
      <p>"Born as a Blockhead, throughout his life Bill put his larger than average brain to good use. There was plenty of space in his rather impressive head for many different ideas. </p>
      <p>"A resident of Bath for more than two decades, Bill has observed a lack of political diversity. Therefore, he has decided to stand as an independent in the 2019 snap general election.</p>
      <p>"Bill’s first five pledges:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>He will campaign for the UK to leave the solar system by 2028</li>
        <li>Improved mental health services (furry animals on prescription) - he will give a FREE guinea pig or alternative small rodent to every citizen</li>
        <li>The environment - he will personally begin digging up the London Road and plant it with spring bulbs and perennials</li>
        <li>Bring back the trams to Bath - made from strawberry jelly and gingerbread men with sprinkles</li>
        <li>Free annual summer and winter parties for all - funded by any Bath resident in the 40% tax bracket</li>
      </ol>
      <p>"Follow Bill Blockhead’s campaign progress on Instagram @billblockhead."</p>
      <p>A recent post calling for a national policy on pancakes has been tagged #absurd and #satire. </p>
      <p>The UK has a colourful history of protest candidates.</p>
      <p>Lord Buckethead, an "intergalactic space lord", has stood against three Conservative Party leaders - he faced Margaret Thatcher in 1987, John Major in 1992 and Theresa May in 2017, when he promised "strong, not entirely stable, leadership" and won 249 votes, a personal best.</p>
      <p>Mr Fish Finger beat that record with 309 votes when he stood against then Lib Dem leader Tim Farron in 2017.</p>
      <p>His "manifishto" said: "I will work to provide a better education system for students. Free fishing rods for everyone."</p>
      <p>Perhaps the best known protest candidate is Official Monster Raving Looney Party founder Screaming Lord Sutch. He stood for election unsuccessfully 40 times between 1963 and 1997.</p>
      <p>The party had a number of policies that have now become law, including lowering the voting age from 21 to 18 and pet passports.</p>
