      <h1>China 'resolutely' backs Hong Kong leader despite polls setback</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T10:47:06+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 10:47</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/76/afp/" target="_blank">AFP</a></address>
      <p><b>BEIJING: </b>China said Monday it supports Hong Kong’s embattled leader Carrie Lam, after the pro-democracy camp scored a crushing victory in community-level elections in the city after months of violence.</p>
      <p>The result was a humiliating rebuke to Beijing and Lam, who has dismissed calls for political reform and had repeatedly suggested that a silent majority supported her administration and opposed the protest movement.</p>
      <p>“China’s central government resolutely supports chief executive Carrie Lam’s leadership of the Special Administrative Region government,” said foreign ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang at a regular press briefing.</p>
      <p>Although the elections handle local concerns such as bus routes and garbage collection, the result has been seen as voters giving the territory’s China-controlled administration a bloody nose after months of increasingly violent clashes between protesters and police.</p>

      <p>Geng said the government also supported the police and judiciary in Hong Kong in “punishing relevant violent and illegal behaviours.”</p>
      <p>“The Chinese government’s resolve to protect national sovereignty, security and development interest has not faltered. Its resolve to carry out one country, two systems has not faltered,” he said.</p>
      <p>Lam said earlier Monday that her government would “listen humbly” to the public.</p>
      <p>Candidates favouring greater democracy seized an overwhelming majority of the 452 seats in the city’s 18 district councils.</p>
