      <p>Oklahoma School Report Cards are about to be released with A-F grades for every public school in the state. These grades will be based on the 2018-19 school year.</p>
      <p>
        <b>When will the report cards come out?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Oklahoma State Board of Education must vote on whether to approve the annual A-F report cards at its monthly meeting on Monday. If the board approves the report, the Oklahoma State Department of Education will release an interactive dashboard with A-F grades for every public school. This is expected to go live at <a href="https://oklaschools.com/">oklaschools.com</a> by mid- to late afternoon Monday.</p>
      <p>
        <b>How are schools graded?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The report cards comprise several indicators, all of which contribute points to a school’s overall A-F grade. The state evaluates schools on academic achievement, which is based on spring test scores, and academic growth, which indicates how well students progressed in English and math assessments compared to the previous year.</p>
      <p>A school report card also considers rates of chronic absenteeism and progress among English language learners. High schools are also graded on graduation rates and post-secondary opportunities.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What do the report card grades mean?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Schools will learn how well they stacked up with every other public school in the state, including charter schools. Those that score in the bottom 5% automatically receive an F grade and qualify for federal school improvement funding for the next three years. Any charter school that falls in the bottom 5% for three years in a row qualifies for closure.</p>
