      <p>A man has been arrested on suspicion of the murder of a mum-of-one killed in a hit-and-run last week.</p>
      <p>Kaylib Connolly, 18, was wanted in connection with the death of Alison McBlaine, 36, who was hit in Blackburn, Lancashire, on Tuesday evening.</p>
      <p>She died in hospital two days later with her family, including her son Reagan, 12, by her bedside.</p>
      <p>Police have said Ms McBlaine was hit by a Fiat Punto Grande they believe deliberately mounted the pavement at about 7.45pm on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The car failed to stop at the scene and was later found with significant front end damage.</p>
      <p>Attempts had been made to set the vehicle on fire, a spokesman for Lancashire Police said.</p>
