      <h1>2021 F1 comeback 'tempting' - Wehrlein</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/pascal-wehrlein/"><b>Pascal Wehrlein</b></a> says he does not want to return to Formula 1 in order to race at the back.</h2>

      <p>The German lost his race seat after stints at Manor and Sauber, and he now races in Formula E. At the Saudi Arabia opener last weekend, he finished a best of 11th.</p>
      <p>Wehrlein has also been linked with a return to F1 for 2021 with the prospective new Spanish team headed by Adrian Campos.</p>
      <p>"Formula 1 is obviously tempting," the 25-year-old, who this year has been a <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/formula-1/ferrari/"><b>Ferrari</b></a> development driver, told t-online.de.</p>
      <p>"But it has to be the right opportunity. I would not want to race right at the back just to get back into F1," Wehrlein insisted.</p>
      <p>He admitted that 2021 would be the earliest date for his comeback.</p>
      <p>"There is still plenty of time before then, so I can still look, listen and think about everything," he said.</p>
