      <p>Expectations - largely on social media - that the return to Zimbabwe of fit-again Vice President Constantino Chiwenga would mark the beginning of a titanic political contest between him and President Emmerson Mnangagwa appear to have so far received short shrift. <br/><br/>This comes after the two men appeared to be very happy to reunite at the weekend - hugging each other warmly and animatedly exchanging pleasantries - after Chiwenga returned home on Saturday from China, where he had been undergoing treatment for an undisclosed serious ailment.<br/><br/>Chiwenga said timely intervention by President Mnangagwa to engage his Chinese counterpart, President Xi Jinping, to facilitate his airlift to Beijing for specialist care and treatment prevented his "imminent death" and saved his life. <br/><br/>In July, the President made the decision when VP Chiwenga was battling for life in the intensive care unit of a South African hospital. <br/><br/>At the time, the VP suffered memory lapses, speech impairment and excruciating pain. However, in what has been an extraordinary recovery story, VP Chiwenga — who arrived home in the early hours of Saturday after a four-month absence — yesterday looked fit and agile when he received President Mnangagwa at his home.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the government yesterday made conflicting statements about Chiwenga's return after his four-month-long stay in China where he was receiving treatment. <br/><br/>Chiwenga quietly flew back into the country yesterday and there were no government officials to welcome him at the Robert Mugabe International Airport. <br/><br/>A fit-looking Chiwenga, who appeared to have recovered from an undisclosed ailment, but suspected to be food poisoning, was met at the airport by his son Tawanda, brother Onismo and Chinese deputy ambassador Zhao Boagang.<br/><br/>Zanu-PF secretary for Information and Publicity Simon Khaya Moyo has thanked Zimbabweans for praying for Chiwenga who was hospitalised in China for four months. Vice President Chiwenga arrived back home early Saturday morning. <br/><br/>On Saturday morning, President Mnangagwa and First Lady Auxillia Mnangagwa visited VP Chiwenga's home where they expressed delight at VP Chiwenga's recovery. <br/><br/>In a statement, Khaya Moyo said: "The revolutionary party welcomes home the indomitable Vice President Retired General Dr Constantino Chiwenga after a spell in the People's Republic of China for medical attention.</p>
