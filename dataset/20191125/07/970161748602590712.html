      <h1>Spoilers: Who attacked Emmerdale's Al? Ellis' return revealed?</h1>

      <p>Al Chapman (Michael Wildman) clearly has a lot of secrets in his closet in Emmerdale – and more than his fair share of enemies. He has been clashing regularly with Billy Fletcher (Jay Kontzle) since the exit of Ellis (Asan N’Jie) – and so it seems obvious that Billy might have snapped and given him a smack on the noggin.</p>
      <p>However, that might not be the case. Since the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/11/what-did-asan-njie-do-and-why-was-he-sacked-from-emmerdale-10724321/">dismissal of Asan from the role of Ellis after an incident at the TV Choice Awards with Hollyoaks star Jamie Lomas</a>, the character has been recast, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/07/emmerdale-recasts-ellis-chapman-as-aaron-anthony-takes-over-from-sacked-asan-njie-11057472/">with Aaron Anthony taking over the role.</a></p>
      <p>With Al having been seen on the phone with Ellis recently and a return confirmed for the character, viewers are wondering if Al might have been attacked by his own offspring.</p>
      <p>Speaking about joining the soap, Delicious and Behind Her Eyes actor Aaron said: ‘Emmerdale is a cracking show with a brilliant cast that I’m over the moon to now be a part of. I know Ellis is a well loved character and I’m looking forward to continuing his journey and all that’s in store for him.’</p>

      <p>Kim Tate (Claire King) becomes worried tonight about what Al is involved in and questions him about what happened – and he insists that it was Billy who attacked him. But as he refuses to get the police involved, there are suspicions about what he is truly hiding.</p>

      <p>Soon afterwards, Dawn (Olivia Bromley) arrives to confront Billy over Al’s allegations, livid that he has risked being sent back to prison. Billy strongly denies having anything to do with the attack, leaving Dawn and Marlon (Mark Charnock) unsure who to believe.</p>
      <p>Later on, Dawn spies on Al and discovers what he is hiding. But just what is Ali’s secret?</p>
