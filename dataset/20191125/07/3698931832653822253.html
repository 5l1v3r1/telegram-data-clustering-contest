      <h1>Someone at Grab has definitely been watching the new Frozen movie</h1>

      <p>Frozen 2 is now showing in theatres, with the sequel to the hugely-popular first movie already drawing some decent <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/frozen_ii">reviews.</a> I have yet to drag myself to a cinema to catch the latest animated blockbuster (much to the chagrin of my significant other), but it appears that the latest movie is very much centred around the same set of protagonists, and feature some new songs for children (and select adults) everywhere to play on repeat.</p>
      <p>That’s based on what others have told me, and it seems that almost everybody I know has already seen the movie—including the folks over at <a href="https://www.soyacincau.com/tag/grab">Grab</a>. The e-hailing app has just rolled out a new update for iOS and Android devices (version v5.72.0), and left a tribute in the update notes to the first Frozen movie’s “iconic” theme song: Let It Go.</p>

      <p>If you look past the puns and rhymes, the update basically fixes some bugs in the app, while Grab is advising users to update to v5.72 soon—or older versions may stop working.</p>
      <p>It’s cute, I suppose, and it makes for more interesting reading than the dreary update notes that usually come with many new app versions—but I do wish there was a little more actual information contained within the parody.</p>

      <p>But maybe I’m just being a tad cynical here, because to be frank, I couldn’t help but play Let It Go in my mind as I read through the update notes. And if it’s slipped your mind (almost impossible, I feel), here’s the original song again—feel free to sing it with Grab’s lyrics:</p>
