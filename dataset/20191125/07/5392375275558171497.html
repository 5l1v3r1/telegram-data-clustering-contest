The smartphone maker has now added another unusual product to its growing portfolio. This time we’re looking at the Xiaomi Donlim multi-function breakfast machine. Yes! You heard it right.  The company now has a portable breakfast machine as its offering. Here is everything you need to know about the product.</p>
      <h3>Xiaomi Donlim Multi-Function Breakfast Machine</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/xiaomi">Xiaomi</a> has now partnered with Donlim to introduce its own iteration of portable kitchens. The product comes with both the toaster and electric stove. The former, as expected, is used for toasting bread while the latter offers multi-operation features. With the help of an electric stove, you can do numerous things such as steam, stir-fry, boil, and many other things. Basically, you can everything on it just like a normal stove. Xiaomi claims that you can prepare any breakfast meal using this machine and that too pretty quickly.</p>

      <p>Since this is a take on portable kitchens, the product comes with 1.2L large capacity pot and 304 stainless steel steamer. To make this even a more valuable offering, the brand is offering a Teflon non-stick frying pan along with a pull tray that can be used to remove bread from the toaster. Furthermore, you will also get a wooden spatula, glass lid, regular pan, and steaming equipment. The toaster offers six-degrees of roasting along with five cooking methods.</p>

      <p>Xiaomi Donlim multi-function breakfast machine comes in two different color options namely Pink and Light Blue.  The product comes with a price tag of merely 359 Yuan (roughly $52). Well, the brand has nailed the pricing here considering all the cooking equipment one is getting alongside. The product is up for crowdfunding in China on the company’s Youpin platform. It would be interesting whether Xiaomi will bring this interesting product to other major markets.</p>
