      <p>Could genuinely floating voters sway this election?</p>
      <p>ITV News Political Correspondent Romilly Weeks followed Jeremy Corbyn and his campaign team onto a canal boat and came away with a very entertaining Alan Partridge-themed anecdote for Daniel and Shehab.</p>
      <p>Before that Robert gives his end-of-week-three analysis on which of the main parties has gone up, down or stayed largely level.</p>

      <p>Boris Johnson <a href="https://www.itv.com/news/2019-11-24/boris-johnson-launches-conservative-party-manifesto-stating-stakes-never-higher-choice-never-starker/"><b>just took a very big political risk</b></a>, by NOT making any serious attempt to compete with Labour on bunging cash at public services and the fabric of the UK, writes ITV News Political Editor Robert Peston.</p>
      <p>Where Corbyn is pledging £83bn a year of increased spending on students, the elderly, health, schools, public-sector pay and so on by 2023, the Tories offer £3bn.</p>
      <p>For Labour’s £80bn plus per year on new housing, pension compensation for women born in the 1950s, nationalisations, greening businesses and multiple other projects, Johnson is committing to £8bn by the end of the next parliament.</p>
      <p>To be clear, Johnson’s relative parsimony is not quite what it seems - because the Tories already made their big pledges to increase hospital, police and schools funding before the election.</p>

      <p>In <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3EAtB7frsNdxAzE6YvjIKR"><b>the latest From The North podcast</b></a> the ITV New Tyne Tees Political Correspondent explains why he believes the Hartlepool candidate was so keen to dance around the details of his party's Brexit stance. (It's around nine minutes in if you're in a rush).</p>

      <p>In the podcast's second election special, ITV Granada's Hannah Miller shares the mood in Manchester's Moss Side and how first-time voters she has met across the North West of England reject the assumptions made about their voting intentions.</p>
      <p>ITV Calendar's Joe Pike also ponders the impact of a potential 'youth-quake' in 2019 while Martin shares anecdotal evidence that trust in Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn is thin on the ground in the North East of England.</p>
