      <h1>Hong Kong leader vows to 'listen humbly' after shock poll result</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T07:56:44+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 07:56</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/76/afp/" target="_blank">AFP</a></address>
      <p><b>HONG KONG: </b>Hong Kong’s unpopular leader Carrie Lam said on Monday her government would “listen humbly” to the public after voters dealt a humiliating election setback to the Beijing-backed establishment she heads.</p>
      <p>“The government will certainly listen humbly to citizens’ opinions and reflect on them seriously,” she said in a statement issued by the government.</p>
      <p>Hong Kong’s pro-democracy camp scored a crushing victory in community-level elections held on Sunday, a result that made clear the level of public support for the demands of a protest movement that has thrown the territory into turmoil.</p>
      <p>In a rout that stunned the semi-autonomous Chinese territory, candidates favouring greater democracy seized an overwhelming majority of the 452 seats in the city’s 18 district councils.</p>
      <p>The councils have historically been firmly in the grip of the Beijing-aligned establishment.</p>
      <p>The protest movement has several key demands including direct popular elections and a probe into alleged police brutality, and the result may bring new pressure on Lam to meet them.</p>
      <p>She has previously rejected the demands as “wishful thinking” and repeatedly suggested the ballot would show most Hong Kongers supported her administration and an end to the protests.</p>

      <p>“The government respects the election results,” Lam said.</p>
      <p>She also acknowledged that the result has sparked discussion of the fact “citizens are dissatisfied with the current social situation and… deep-seated problems,” without going into details.</p>
      <p>The unrest erupted earlier this year when Lam’s government introduced a bill that would have allowed extraditions to China’s opaque judicial system.</p>
      <p>It was later withdrawn but the anger it unleashed triggered a wider movement for change that brought millions into the streets and saw violent clashes between police and protesters.</p>
