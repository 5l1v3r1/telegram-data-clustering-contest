      <p>This cute golden retriever pup seems to be a big fan of Italian cuisine, so it tries to eat a big tasty slice of pizza. Unfortunately, it’s just a toy – but maybe it’s even better that way, because this pizza can’t be finished. Well, as long as the doggo isn’t too hungry, that is. But if this were to be the case, then the doggo would definitely be able to eat anything – just wait and see.</p>
