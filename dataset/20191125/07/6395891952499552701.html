      <p>On Friday, Tyler Perry Studios <a href="https://www.ajc.com/blog/radiotvtalk/tyler-perry-studios-plans-open-for-public-tours-2020/Srkjpr7Az0iRdzweEx1DsK/">announced</a> on social media that this indeed will come to fruition some time in 2020.</p>
      <p>The pricing, frequency and launch date <a href="https://www.ajc.com/blog/radiotvtalk/tyler-perry-studios-plans-open-for-public-tours-2020/Srkjpr7Az0iRdzweEx1DsK/">will come later</a>. </p>
      <p>Perry's studio is by far the largest in Georgia and, in terms of acreage, bigger than any of the studios in Los Angeles.</p>
      <p>Besides his 12 sound stages, he’ll be able to show off back lots featuring retail shops, a baseball field, a jail, a trailer park, a four-sided mansion and a duplicate White House.</p>
      <p>There are also historic buildings from the time it was Fort McPherson, an army base. He purchased the property in 2015 for $30 million and has invested more than $250 million into the site with more to come.</p>
      <p>This could become a popular tourist site on top of places such as the Georgia Aquarium, Martin Luther King Jr. National Historical Park and the Coca-Cola Museum. </p>
      <p>For comparison, in Los Angeles, Sony Pictures Studios offers tours Monday through Friday <a href="https://www.sonypicturesstudiostours.com/">four times a day for $50 per person</a>. <a href="https://www.sonypicturesstudiostours.com/viptours.html">VIP tours are priced at $175 apiece.</a> <a href="https://www.sonypicturesstudiostours.com/coffeetours.html">A more modest “coffee tour” is $135 per person</a>. </p>
      <p>A <a href="https://paramountstudiotour.ventrata.com/en/studio-tour">Paramount Studios</a> two-hour tour is $60 apiece seven days a week from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. (<a href="https://paramountstudiotour.ventrata.com/en/vip-tour">The 4.5-hour VIP tour is $189 per person which includes lunch and greater access to behind-the-scenes areas.</a>)</p>
      <p>The Warner Brothers studio tour starts at<a href="https://www.wbstudiotour.com/"> $69 per person</a> and runs up to 14 a day. There is a “classics’ version at the same price and a deluxe $295 tour. </p>
