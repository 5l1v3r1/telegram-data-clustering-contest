        <i>All the world's cricketers walked into a bar. The LOLs, the chatter, and the occasional mini-brawls, they were endless. And the news cycle was never the same again! Welcome to ESPNcricinfo's Social Buzz, your go-to destination for all the bantz, the jousts, and little bit of eavesdropping from the social media playground and beyond.</i>

      <p>The hype surrounding India's first-ever day-night Test practically overshadowed the actual game as a rotating cast of pink-wearing luminaries rang bells, gave speeches, did victory laps and put on a show. Among the all-star cast drafted to do things were chess grandmaster Viswanathan Anand and current world chess champion Magnus Carlsen, who were there to ring the bell at Eden Gardens on day two. Here's what that looked like.</p>

      <p>And apparently there's a good reason for that look on Carlsen's face - turns out no one had explained cricket to him. Speaking to the Hindu, this is how Carlsen described his experience: "What happened is, Anand rang the bell and I stood there and looked stupid. That would be my summary of the match. I have a lot to learn when it comes to cricket."</p>
      <p>Well, Magnus, all you need to know is that it's almost, but not quite, entirely unlike chess.</p>
      <h3>Ganguly and daughter trade banter on Instagram</h3>
      <p>Sourav Ganguly may have half the cricketing world hanging onto his every word now that he's the BCCI president, but some others are less than impressed. Ganguly recently posted a picture of him looking grim at the presentation ceremony after the Kolkata day-night Test wound up.</p>

      <p>His daughter Sana though seemed to find the whole thing hilarious, and this is clearly a look she's seen often. "What is it that you're not liking?" she commented on it. Ganguly took the opportunity to go full dad and sledge her a bit: "that ur becoming so disobedient". Sana wasn't going to take that lying down, though - "learning from you" she quipped back.</p>
      <p>Justin Langer and daughter have competition now on the <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/23714265/a-difference-banter-abuse-justin-langer-vows-put-fun-back-sledging">fun sledging</a> front.</p>

      <p>Let's start the week with a feel-good story. On ABC Grandstand, commentator Allison Mitchell related the story of an Indian taxi driver in Brisbane who told her about ferrying some of the Pakistan players to a restaurant, including Yasir Shah, Shaheen Afridi and Naseem Shah. When he dropped them off, he refused to charge them. For his generosity, the players asked him to join them for the meal.</p>
