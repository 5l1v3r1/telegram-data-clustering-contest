      <p>Justin Bieber took to Instagram to share a loving note for wife Hailey on her 23rd birthday - which teased plans to extend their family.<br/><br/>The Sorry hitmaker and the supermodel wed last year in an intimate New York courthouse ceremony, and made the honeymoon period last by throwing a second bash in September to mark their one-year anniversary.<br/><br/>On Friday, as Hailey celebrated her big day, Justin took to social media to share a sweet post in celebration.<br/><br/>"Happy birthday babes!" the star penned alongside two photos from their recent wedding. "You make me want to be better everyday! The way you live you life is so attractive.. ps you turn me on in every way."<br/><br/>He then hinted at a plan for a new addition to the family soon, adding: "next season BABIES."<br/><br/>Taking to his Instagram stories, the I Don't Care singer shared a number of clips of the intimate festivities, which showed several bouquets of roses around their enviable home, and the couple sitting down to a home-cooked meal and a glass of wine.<br/><br/>Earlier this year, Justin confessed he was "looking forward" to being a dad, but insisted he was in "no rush" to extend their family just yet. Instead, the pair have welcomed two part-exotic kittens into the family, which the star often showcases on his social media pages.</p>
