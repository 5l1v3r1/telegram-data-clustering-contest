        <b>Liverpool star Sadio Mane has been showered with praise by pundit Garth Crooks after another big performance for the Reds in their win over Crystal Palace.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Mane scored in the 2-1 victory at Selhurst Park, making it eight goals and two assists in 13 Premier League games so far this season.</p>

      <p>It’s not the first time the Senegal international has been one of Liverpool’s stand-out performers, and Crooks is now tipping the 27-year-old as his favourite to win PFA Player of the Year.</p>
      <p>Writing in his <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/50539143">BBC Sport</a> column, he said: “Sadio Mane is fast becoming my favourite to win the PFA Player of the Year award. His performances so far this season have been wonderful.</p>
      <p>“Against Crystal Palace he was, once again, Liverpool’s biggest threat. He refuses to give any defence a moment’s rest.</p>
      <p>“That said, the Senegal international might have had a hat-trick in a game that could have finished 3-3. Instead, Liverpool tightened their grip on that elusive Premier League title – and much of that is down to Mane.”</p>
      <p>Mane’s Liverpool team-mate Virgil van Dijk won it last year, and Mohamed Salah was another member of this squad to take the prize the previous year.</p>

      <p>Mane does look like a deserving winner based on recent form, and it would be quite something for a Liverpool player to win the award for three years running.</p>
      <p>LFC fans can take some pride in that, though they would surely just rather see their club finally win the Premier League title after coming so close last season.</p>
