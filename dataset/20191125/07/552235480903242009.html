      <p>Pop superstars Little Mix are to play a huge outdoor gig at Ayr Racecourse.</p>
      <p>The world's biggest girl band will visit Ayrshire as part of their 21-date summer tour which hits the road in 2020.</p>
      <p>Ayr has been chosen as one of the venues across Scotland, England and Wales to host the show on Saturday, July 25.</p>
      <p>Tickets go on sale at 9am this Thursday, November 2019 from www.ticketmaster.co.uk and www.lhgtickets.com</p>
      <p>The tour will see Little Mix perform some of their greatest hits including ‘Woman Like Me’, ‘Touch’, ‘Shout Out to My Ex’, ‘Black Magic’ and ‘Wings'.</p>
      <p>Venues include London's Hyde Park and the Cardiff City Stadium.</p>
      <p>The girls will play only two other dates in Scotland, at the Falkirk Stadium and Aberdeen's Hazlehead Park.</p>
      <p>The group said: "Performing live is our favourite thing to do as a band, we love it.</p>
      <p>"Our last Summer tour in 2018 was one of our favourites ever, so we can’t wait for some more brilliant outdoor shows next year.</p>
