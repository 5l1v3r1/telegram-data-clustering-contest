      <p>MBOMBELA – Heleen Winterbach, a member of CB and one of the organisers of the event, said that everything turned out great for the elderly people of the old-age village.</p>
      <blockquote>“They are not often visited by their children and therefore it is one of the highlights in their lives. They have enjoyed it thoroughly,” a delighted Winterbach explained.</blockquote>
      <p>The CB, who have been operating for the past 16 years, entertained the senior citizens with a live karaoke performance by Tom Jacobie. A delectable variety of foods, including gammon, Coronation chicken, potato salad, Malva pudding and champagne were served and prepared by Ingrid Scheepers, to tantalize their taste buds.</p>

      <p>“Everything we do is voluntarily done. We want alleviate the loneliness experienced by some of the residents by spoiling them with gifts and food,” Meisie Barnard, the CB chair indicated.</p>

      <p>The entertainers Judie and Malcolm Black performed a hilarious mock operation, to the immense thrill of the residents. Barnard wishes to thank all their sponsors for their contributions towards this event and urges all kind-hearted locals to join CB and their group of 70 volunteers.</p>
      <p>Ria van der Walt, Frieda Schoor and Ronel Vorster, all residents of the retirement village, agreed that this was a delightful day, in which they were spoiled rotten.</p>
