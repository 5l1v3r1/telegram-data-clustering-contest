      <p>It was informed earlier in the outcome of the Board meeting held on November 14, 2019 that the judicial authorities in Singapore have heard the matter regarding liquidation of the subsidiary and the written order was pending, the company said in a regulatory filing on Friday.</p>
      <p>"We now hereby inform that the written order for liquidation of the said subsidiary (Readymade Steel Singapore Pte Ltd) has since been received and Ng Kian Kiat and Lin Yueh Hung have been appointed as joint and several liquidators of the said subsidiary," it added.</p>
      <p>Further, as informed earlier, as a matter of prudence, the company has, in the results for March, 2019, already fully impaired its investments and loans outstanding in the said subsidiary Readymade Steel Singapore, in its standalone financials. In view of the same, there will be no major impact of the said liquidation on the financials of the company, it had said in the filing.</p>
