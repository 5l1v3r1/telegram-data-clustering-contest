      <p>MUMBAI, Nov 25 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - A female superhero will use her powers to fight sex crimes in India and the stigma that trafficking survivors face, in the third instalment of a comic series due to be released this week.</p>
      <p>Priya, a rape survivor-turned superhero who flies around on a tiger, fought her abusers and helped acid attack victims in the last two editions of the "Priya's Shakti" comic.</p>
      <p>"Comics are hugely popular with teenagers and young adults ... we wanted to reach teenagers because they are learning about sexuality, gender-roles and sexual violence," said series creator and filmmaker Ram Devineni.</p>
      <p>"More importantly, we have given voices and put attention on survivors of gender-based violence," Devineni told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in an email.</p>
      <p>Thousands of people across India – largely poor, rural women and children – are lured to cities each year by traffickers who promise good jobs, but sell them into modern day slavery.</p>
      <p>India recorded around 3,000 human trafficking cases in 2017, according to recently released crime data, which anti-trafficking campaigners said masked the true scale of the crime.</p>
      <p>In the new comic, which can be downloaded for free from Tuesday, Priya rescues sex trafficking victims and challenges the communities that refuse to accept them on their return home.</p>
      <p>"Priya's Shakti" (Priya's Strength) was the first Indian comic book of its kind when first released in 2014, using augmented reality to tell the story of a young, rural woman who is gang-raped and then shamed by her family and community.</p>
      <p>In her latest comic titled "Priya and the Lost Girls", she returns to her village where she finds all the women, including her sister, missing. She then traces them to a brothel owned by a demon who she must fight to rescue the women.</p>
      <p>Although set in India, the story has global resonance, the creators said.</p>
      <p>"People in first world countries think of sex trafficking as a third world problem. What they don't realize is, it happens in their own backyards. It is a global industry making a lot of money," the comic book's writer Dipti Mehta said.</p>
      <p>The story was based on research the creators conducted of brothels in red-light districts of Kolkata and Mumbai.</p>
      <p>"I think as artists and creators it is our social responsibility to raise awareness and give voice to those who need it the most," Mehta said.</p>
      <p>The "Priya's Shakti" series has been downloaded more than 500,000 times and read by about 26 million people worldwide, Devineni said.</p>
      <p>Augmented reality is being used as a sex education tool in Myanmar, while Indonesian storytellers are spreading a 'mighty girls' message through a series of illustrated e-books to fight male dominance.</p>
