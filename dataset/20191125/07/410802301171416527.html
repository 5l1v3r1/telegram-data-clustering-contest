      <p>Unveiled as a concept in Shanghai two years ago, Audi has followed-up the reveal of the all-electric e-tron in Geneva earlier year and then in South Africa in August at the Kyalami Festival of Motoring by taking the covers off of the coupe-styled Sportback at the Los Angeles International Auto Show this past week.</p>
      <p>Differing from the regular e-tron only in design with the sloping roofline and rounded rear facia mirroring that of the Q3 Sportback, the e-tron Sportback measures 4 901 mm in overall length with a wheelbase of 2 928 mm, width of 1 935 mm and height of 1 616 mm, with Audi claiming a boot space of 615-litres or 1 655-litres with the split rear seat folded down.</p>
      <p>Like its traditionally styled sibling, the Sportback will be offered in two trim levels; base and S line with the latter receiving a sports air suspension, an S line bodykit, 20-inch alloy wheels, S branded illuminated door sills, an integrated boot spoiler and rear diffuser, plus the optional Black Package for the window surrounds, Singleframe grille, mirror caps and the bumpers.</p>

      <p>Riding as standard on 19-inch alloy wheels with up to 22-inches optional, the Sportback’s interior is also unchanged from the e-tron with the 12.3-inch Virtual Cockpit Display instrument cluster being retained along with the 12.1-inch MMI plus navigation infotainment system plus the 8.6-inch climate control panel.</p>
      <p>Model-wise, the Sportback will initially consist out of two derivatives with the 50 quattro serving as base model. In this guise, motivation is provided by a 71 kWh lithium-ion battery pack that produces 230kW/540Nm. According to Ingolstadt, this allows the 50 to reach 100 km/h from naught in 6.8 seconds and top out at 190 km/h.</p>
      <p>Sitting at the top of the range, the 55 quattro packs a bigger 91 kWh battery that translates to a total output of 265kW/561Nm, or 300kW/664Nm when in the sportier S mode. With the latter engaged, the 55 will accelerate from 0-100 km/h in 5.7 seconds and reach a V-max of 200 km/h.</p>

      <p>In terms of range, the 50 can travel 347 km between trips to the plug, while 55 can achieve 446 km. Whereas the former model comes equipped with a 120 kW on-board charger, the 55 boasts a 150 kW socket with both being able to reach 80% charged from zero in 30 minutes.</p>
      <p>Arriving in the European spring next year, pricing for the e-tron Sportback kicks-off at €71 350 (R1 153 878) in Germany, but don’t expect it, for the moment, to become available in South Africa.</p>
