      <p>Your morning headlines for Monday, November 25.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Gloucester emerge as favourites to land Kyle Sinckler</b>
      </p>
      <p>Gloucester have reportedly emerged as favourites to sign England prop Kyle Sinckler.</p>
      <p>The Harlequins tighthead will come to the end of his contract at The Stoop this season and talks to sign a new deal appear to have hit an impasse.</p>
      <p>The Rugby Paper claim that Premiership rivals Gloucester are willing to table an offer of £500,000 to acquire Sinckler's services, with Johan Ackermann believed to be in the market for a prop.</p>
      <p>While he has had his issues with discipline in recent years, it cannot be argued that Sinckler is a hugely-exciting prospect with great potential and his capture would be a big boost to the Cherry and Whites.</p>

        <b>Former Springbok calls out 'problematic' doping issue in South Africa</b>
      </p>
      <p>Former Springbok lock Marco Wentzel has called out South Africa's 'problematic' doping culture.</p>
      <p>The World Cup winners have recently hit the headlines following their triumph in Japan, with ex-Ireland international Neil Francis calling on World Rugby to investigate the alleged doping issue in the country, insinuating they are not doing all they can to police the problem.</p>
      <p>"How certain are we when we point a finger to suggest there is a steroid culture in a country that has just won the World Cup? Fairly certain," Francis wrote in the <a href="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&amp;objectid=12284342">Irish Independent</a> .</p>
      <p>"What were we saying about latitude and dispensation? Do we need to put an asterisk beside the winners of the 2019 World Cup?"</p>
      <p>And now Wentzel, who played for South Africa in 2002, has sided with the critics, saying the problem is systemic and has to be cut out at grass-roots level.</p>
      <p>"The unfortunate fact is that if we look at the last few years in terms of the amount of rugby players caught doping, critics have a point," Wentzel told <a href="https://www.sport24.co.za/Rugby/Springboks/ex-bok-on-doping-in-sa-accusations-critics-have-a-point-20191122">Sport24</a> .</p>
      <p>"In recent times we have had the cases of Gerbrandt Grobler, Chiliboy Ralepelle and Aphiwe Dyantyi and way back we had the likes of Johan Ackermann. It's an issue and I don't think those who raise the issue are factually incorrect.</p>
      <p>"From what one hears the steroid use at schoolboy level is quite rife but is it because we are so competitive and there are so many players? It might spring from that because rugby is such a big cultural phenomenon.</p>
      <p>"It is up to the coaches and parents to police the use of steroids but kids are kids. In today's age you can't stop them and if they want something they'll get it."</p>

      <p>SA rugby president Mark Alexander, meanwhile, hit back at the critics while also conceding the issue needs to be stamped out at schoolboy level.</p>
      <p>"You know, those who commented about our so-called drug culture can be charged with defamation. And what if we start talking about their drug culture?" Alexander told Afrikaans newspaper <a href="https://www.netwerk24.com/Sport/Rugby/rugbybaas-se-ierse-kritici-pleeg-laster-met-aantygings-20191123">Rapport</a>.</p>
      <p>"There is a problem in our schools, but all of us are working hard to try to solve it. Players were tested every day at the World Cup an no-one failed (a dope test)."</p>

        <b>The forgotten, discarded or new Wales players with huge points to prove to Wayne Pivac</b>
      </p>
      <p>It’s the dawn of a new era in Welsh rugby and the challenge for players in Wayne Pivac’s Wales first squad is not to slumber at the start of it.</p>
      <p>The New Zealander has started with a clean slate, offering opportunities to a number of players who didn’t exactly prosper in the latter days of the old regime.</p>
      <p>There are also squad places for the freshly qualified Johnny McNicholl and Willis Halaholo, though Halaholo picked up an <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/rugby/rugby-news/injury-worry-over-new-wales-17307259">injury playing for Cardiff Blues against Leicester</a> .</p>
      <p>Who are the players with most to prove for Wales in the Cardiff game against the Barbarians this weekend?</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/rugby/rugby-news/seven-forgotten-discarded-new-wales-17308926">We take a look here</a>.</p>

        <b>Eddie Jones's take on that Owen Farrell haka 'smile'</b>
      </p>
      <p>Eddie Jones has given his view on Owen Farrell's 'knowing smile' during the All Blacks' haka in the World Cup.</p>
      <p>As England prepared to face the vaunted New Zealand in the semi-final, the camera panned to Farrell, standing at the apex of the now infamous V formation.</p>
      <p>Farrell's smile was branded as disrespectful by some corners of New Zealand's media, however Jones has his own take.</p>
      <p>"At the apex of the V, Owen Farrell catches the unblinking eye of the television cameras," Jones wrote in his autobiography, as reported by the New Zealand Herald.</p>
      <p>"He stares straight at Read, his face creased by a knowing smile. It's a great moment which is seen up on the big screen.</p>
      <p>"People would describe it later as a smirk but that reduces his reaction to one of disdain or disrespect. This is the opposite of what he and England mean. Rather, his smile is an acknowledgement of the power of the haka as well as our readiness to match the Kiwis with fire and intensity. It is a smile of anticipation rather than apprehension."</p>
      <p>The Australian coach went on to express his pleasure in how England dealt with the haka challenge.</p>
      <p>"England's players, calmly and methodically, remove their white tracksuit tops," he added.</p>
      <p>"I am pleased to see how unfazed they look - even as one of the commentators on New Zealand television yelps: 'You want box office? You've got it! How about that challenge from England?'"</p>

        <b>Bath furious after England star man returns from World Cup with serious injury</b>
      </p>
      <p>Bath are incensed by the 'limited information' they were given about their star wing Joe Cokanasiga after he returned from the World Cup with a serious knee injury.</p>
      <p>The bruising wing started just one game for Eddie Jones's side out in Japan, but returned from the global showpiece unfit to play for his club.</p>
      <p>It has been suggested that the 22-year-old could miss around four months.</p>
      <p>“Ultimately, Joe has come back to us unable to train,” Bath director of rugby Stuart Hooper said.</p>
      <p>“If people get injured, that happens. But we need to make sure that we are aware of everything that is happening so that when we do get them get back, we’ve got a decent plan moving forward.”</p>
      <p>The RFU, however, defended its treatment of the player and perceived lack of communication.</p>
      <p>“We are in ongoing conversations with Bath Rugby about Joe’s injury,” an RFU spokesperson told the Daily Telegraph.</p>
      <p>“The welfare of England players is paramount to us and our world-class medical team will always act in their best interests.”</p>
