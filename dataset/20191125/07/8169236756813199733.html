        <b>David Moyes is reportedly looking set for a return to Everton to replace the struggling Marco Silva.</b>
      </p>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/marco-silvas-everton-fate-sealed-20951309">Daily Mirror</a>, Silva’s fate at Goodison Park is all but sealed, with Moyes indicating he’d be ready to return to his former club.</p>

      <p>The Scot did fine work at Everton in his first spell in charge, leading the side for 11 years between 2002 and 2013.</p>
      <p>He then left the Merseysiders to take charge of Manchester United in a surprise move as he was selected as the replacement for the retiring Sir Alex Ferguson.</p>
      <p>Moyes did not last long at Old Trafford, failing to see out the first season at the club, and has since had a number of other underwhelming spells with Real Sociedad, Sunderland and West Ham.</p>
      <p>Still, the Mirror explain that Moyes looks a strong candidate to perhaps come in on a short-term deal at Everton and help them away from the relegation zone.</p>
      <p>The club are currently 15th in the Premier League table, just four points from safety, and an experienced head like Moyes could be ideal to help them tighten up a bit at the back and secure their status in the top flight.</p>
