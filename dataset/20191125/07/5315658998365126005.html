      <p>We agree with NZ First Jenny Marcroft ‘Spokesperson for Health’ innovative to lower 1080 poison on predator control in the press release 20th November 2019.</p>
      <p>QUOTE.<br/><i>“New Zealand First is proud to announce the Provincial Growth Fund (PGF) has allocated $3.5 million to develop innovative predator control approaches which will reduce the need for repeated 1080 use.”</i></p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <i>CEAC say this is good “environmental stewardship”</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>We have been witness to the multiple horrible slow death of other animal’s not considered as “predators” around the rural sector with the continued over-use of 1080 and offering a more humane control is welcomed here.</p>
      <p>This toxic chemical bait and use of pellets simply does not discriminate any animal or bird in the drop zone, so we are grateful for this excellent innovation project to ‘<i>develop innovative predator control approaches’</i></p>
      <p>NZ First claim to be the Party of “common sense” and this again is a good sensible plan.</p>
      <p>
        <b>CEAC encourage a coalition Government who is a caring, considerate inclusive, responsive to citizens’ concerns.</b>
