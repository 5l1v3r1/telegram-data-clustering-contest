      <p>Ozzy Osbourne returned to the stage for the first time since suffering injuries in a fall at home earlier this year.</p>
      <p>The former Black Sabbath singer, who cancelled a string of tour dates following the fall, joined rappers Post Malone and Travis Scott in a performance at the American Music Awards.</p>
      <p>The trio performed the song Take What You Want, from Malone’s album Hollywood’s Bleeding, during Sunday’s ceremony in Los Angeles.</p>

      <p>Osbourne, 70, spent most of the performance seated in a gothic-style throne towards the back of the stage.</p>
      <p>He was seen waving his arms in the air while encouraging the audience, including wife Sharon and daughter Kelly, to do the same.</p>
      <p>Osbourne, known throughout his career in heavy metal as the Prince of Darkness, sang the chorus of Take What You Want from behind a veil of smoke caused by the pyrotechnics surrounding the stage.</p>
      <p>The performance marked a comeback for the rocker.</p>
      <p>Osbourne had an accident at his home earlier this year, aggravating injuries from a near-fatal quad bike crash in 2003.</p>
      <p>While recuperating from a bout of pneumonia, Osbourne fell over a rug and hit his head, falling face down and forcing his neck back.</p>
      <p>He dislodged metal rods in his body, put there after his 2003 crash, and later said that he thought he was going to die.</p>
      <p>He was forced to reschedule dates on his European tour and has since said the No More Tours 2 shows will take place from October through to December next year.</p>
