      <p>NEW DELHI: Senior <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Congress">Congress</a> leader <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Jyotiraditya-Scindia">Jyotiraditya Scindia</a> on Monday dismissed speculation about his <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Twitter">Twitter</a> bio not including his links to the party as "baseless".</p>
      <p>Social media went into overdrive with many wondering whether Scindia was planning to quit the Congress and others highlighting the reported differences between him and Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Kamal-Nath">Kamal Nath</a>.</p>
      <p>But the changes were made a month ago, Scindia said.</p>
      <p>"I had changed it (the Twitter bio) a month ago... I got feedback that it is a long biodata and should be made short. All rumours around it are baseless," Scindia told PTI.</p>
      <p>Later Scindia tweeted, "Ridiculous commotion over a twitter profile change done almost a month ago!"</p>
      <p>His Twitter bio had earlier stated, "Former Member of Parliament Guna (2002-2019). Former Minister for Power (I/C); MoS Commerce and Industry, MoS communications, IT and Post".</p>
      <p>Scindia's Twitter bio now reads, "Public servant, cricket enthusiast".</p>
