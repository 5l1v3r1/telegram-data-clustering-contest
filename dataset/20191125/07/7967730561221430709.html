      <h1>Sydney FC move early to keep Ninkovic for another season</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T07:34:15+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 07:34</time> by <a rel="author">Dominic Bossi</a></address>
      <p>Sydney FC aren’t waiting until the end of the season to lock down Milos Ninkovic for another year, with the club already entering talks to re-sign the veteran playmaker.</p>
      <p>He might be in the twilight of his career but Ninkovic, 35, has shown no signs of slowing down and has already flagged his intention to continue playing for another year at least. The former Serbia international's contract does not expire until May, but Sydney FC want to make sure he is at the club next season.</p>

      <p>Club sources told the <i>Herald</i> they had begun working on a new deal for Ninkovic, an unusual step so early in the season. The stringent A-League salary cap means clubs usually leave contract renewals until late in the season, to account for form and fitness.</p>
      <p>The former Dynamo Kiev, Evian and Red Star Belgrade man has been one of the brightest performers in the Sky Blues’ title defence, netting twice in their first six games. His latest strike came on Saturday night, scoring the third goal in the club's <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p53dh7.html">3-1 away win over Perth Glory</a> in a grand final replay.</p>
      <p>Ninkovic's form has not dipped with age, and any suggestions this year will be his last appear to have been quashed. Club sources said he was eager to continue with Sydney and wanted to secure his future as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>Speaking to the <i>Herald</i> in April, he announced his ambition to see out the rest of his career with the Sky Blues.</p>
      <p>"I want to finish my career here because I am very happy here and I feel like I am home," he said then.</p>
      <p>However, sources close to the player said rival clubs had identified him as a transfer target and could try and tempt him away from Sydney FC. He will enter the last six months of his contract on December 1, when other clubs can approach Ninkovic without permission.</p>

      <p>Ninkovic has been one of the key figures of Sydney FC’s dominant era of the past four years, winning two A-League titles, two premierships, an FFA Cup and a Johnny Warren Medal. It is his fifth season at Sydney and, should he stay for a sixth, he will likely free up another visa spot at the club.</p>
      <p>Ninkovic has already received permanent residency and is awaiting Australian citizenship, which means he will no longer count as one of the club's allotted five foreigners. He was rewarded with a marquee contract in 2017 but any deal to keep him next season will likely be for a contract inside the salary cap.</p>
