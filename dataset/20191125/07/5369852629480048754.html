      <p>THE SAN FRANCISCO 49ers continued to impress in the NFL on Sunday, while the New England Patriots scraped past the Dallas Cowboys.</p>
      <p>The 49ers improved to 10-1 by comfortably beating Aaron Rodgers’ Green Bay Packers at Levi’s Stadium.</p>
      <p>Also 10-1 are the Patriots, who edged the Cowboys in rainy conditions at Gillette Stadium.</p>
      <p>There was also a big win for the Tennessee Titans over the Jacksonville Jaguars.</p>
      <p>
        <b>49ERS BRUSH PAST PACKERS</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 49ers were far too good for the Packers in a 37-8 victory.</p>
      <p>San Francisco contained Rodgers, who was sacked five times and had just 104 passing yards and a TD on 20 of 33 completed passes.</p>
      <p>49ers quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo was far better, throwing two touchdown passes and for 253 yards after completing 14 of 20, while George Kittle had 129 receiving yards and a TD.</p>
      <p>Green Bay (8-3) managed just 198 total yards to San Francisco’s 339, leaving them no match for the high-flying 49ers.</p>
      <p>
        <b>PATRIOTS EDGE COWBOYS</b>
      </p>
      <p>Tom Brady went 17 of 37 for 190 yards and the game’s only touchdown in the Patriots’ 13-9 victory over the Cowboys.</p>
      <p>The quarterback’s 10-yard pass to N’Keal Harry in the first quarter gave the Patriots a lead their defense were able to protect.</p>
      <p>New England’s defense is comfortably the best in the NFL so far this season, conceding just 117 points in 11 games. The 49ers (163 in 11) are the second best.</p>
      <p>Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott went 19 of 33 for 212 yards and an interception, while Ezekiel Elliott rushed for 86 yards on 21 carries.</p>
      <p>
        <b>TANNEHILL, TITANS PILE IT ON</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Titans scored 28 points in the third quarter of a 42-20 victory over the Jaguars.</p>
      <p>A second straight win helped the Titans improve to 6-5, the same record as the Indianapolis Colts in the AFC South, which is led by the Houston Texans (7-4).</p>
      <p>Titans QB Ryan Tannehill threw two TD passes on the back of 14 of 18 completed passes for 259 yards, while he also rushed for two scores.<br/>A.J. Brown scored a TD and had 135 receiving yards, while Derrick Henry rushed for 159 – and two TDs – on 19 carries.</p>

        <b>LUTZ SINKS PANTHERS AS GORE RUSHES INTO THIRD</b>
      </p>
      <p>Wil Lutz’s 33-yard field goal saw the New Orleans Saints (9-2) get past the 5-6 Carolina Panthers 34-31.</p>
      <p>“We continue to find a way to win when we are not really playing our best. It is a big team win and now we are off to a short week in Atlanta,” Lutz said.</p>
      <p>“I actually didn’t hit the ball too well. My heart kind of sank a little bit to be honest. At the end of the day it was good [win] and a nice win.”</p>
      <p>Frank Gore moved into third for all-time rushing yards in the NFL during the Buffalo Bills’ 20-3 win over the Denver Broncos.</p>
      <p>“I’m blessed, I’m happy,” Gore said after the Bills improved to 8-3.</p>
      <p>“For me it was tough to get to the NFL. I’ve been doubted my whole career. I tore my two ACLs and a lot of people said you will be here only two or three years and now in my year 15 I’m still having fun and still making plays, still helping a team win games.”</p>
