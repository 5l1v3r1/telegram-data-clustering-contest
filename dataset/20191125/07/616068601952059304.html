      <p>Rapper Post Malone struck lucky when he pocketed $50,000 thanks to a beer pong victory.<br/><br/>The Sunflower star challenged his up-and-coming artist, Tyla Yaweh, to a round of the popular drinking game, in which players throw a ping pong ball across a table with the aim of landing the ball in a cup of beer on the other end, before their Wednesday night concert at The Forum in Los Angeles, reported TMZ.<br/><br/>The high-stakes game drew an impressive crowd, with Billy Idol, Niall Horan, Mike Stud, and Diplo among the star-studded spectators watching the game - which saw the Beerbongs and Bentleys rapper emerge $50,000 richer.<br/><br/>The win will have no doubt made up for Post's recent losses, after the star, real name Austin Richard Post, handed over $20,000 to fellow star YG after betting the Dallas Cowboys would beat the Los Angeles Rams in the National Football League play-offs back in January.<br/><br/>His manager, Dre London, personally delivered the cash to YG on the set of Tyla's music video shoot for I Think I Luv Her last month.</p>
