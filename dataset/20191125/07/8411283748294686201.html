      <h1>HannStar Board 3Q19 profits hit 10-year high</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T07:09:17+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 07:09</time> by <a rel="author">Jay Liu, Taipei; Willis Ke, DIGITIMES</a></address>
      <p>PCB maker HannStar Board has posted the highest profit in 10 years in the third quarter of 2019, with gross margin nearing 20% and net earnings shooting up 62.17% on year to NT$1.514 billion (US$49.64 million) on total revenues of NT$11.82 billion, up 9.5% sequentially.</p>
      <p>The impressive profit growth was attributed to higher shipment ratios for high-end notebook and server boards, the depreciation of the Chinese currency and price falls for raw materials, according to industry sources.</p>
      <p>The firm is expected to see better revenues in the fourth quarter than a year earlier partly because downstream clients may advance shipment pull-in well ahead of the Lunar New Year holidays in late January, the sources said.</p>
      <p>In recent years, HannStar has expanded its board applications yo set-up boxes, network equipment, servers, TVs, and gaming consoles, in addition to traditional notebooks and PCs. Its affiliated Global Brands Manufacture has developed applications for automotive and electric machine tools, and HannStar has also become a major shareholder at flexible board maker Career Technology in 2019 to facilitate its deployment in rigid-flex board production and expand customer bases.</p>
      <p>HannStar will continue to stay away from handset applications, and instead it will enhance development of high-end boards for business-use notebooks, 2-in-1 laptops and other notebooks with high performance computing. The company will also step up 5G networking applications including servers, routers, switches, and IoT devices.</p>
      <p>At the moment, high-end PCBs for servers and IPCs are being produced at the firm's plants in Taiwan and other products at its plant in Jiangsu, China.</p>
