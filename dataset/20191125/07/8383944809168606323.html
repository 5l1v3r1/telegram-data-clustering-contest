      <p>Turkish security forces arrested 25 suspects over links to the terrorist PKK/KCK in simultaneous operations in several provinces, security sources said Sunday.</p>
      <p>The operation was launched on Nov. 14 in eight provinces. Fifty-four people were detained, while 29 were later released under judicial supervision.</p>
      <p>According to the sources, the arrested suspects include pro-PKK Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) Gaziantep Provincial Chairman Müslüm Kılıç and people involved in the so-called "city council," "youth movement" and "politics" of the Kurdistan Communities Union (KCK), which serves as an umbrella body of the PKK terrorist group.</p>
      <p>In its more than 30-year terror campaign against Turkey, the PKK – listed as a terrorist organization by Turkey, the U.S. and the EU – has been responsible for the deaths of some 40,000 people, including women and children.</p>
