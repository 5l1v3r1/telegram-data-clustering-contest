      <p>Acting director for person with disability unit from the Prime Minister’s office Youth, Employment and Persons with Disabilities Philbert Kawemama made the remarks over the weekend when speaking at the photo exhibition dubbed “The dark sight of photography” held at residence of Italian Ambassador to Tanzania Roberto Mengoni.</p>
      <p>The dark sight of photographs aims to spread messages to community, parents and other member of the society to communicate and improve the situation of children with disability.</p>
      <p>“The government recognises and commends the efforts by development partners in including Italian embassy to Tanzania in collaborations with its non government organisation named CEFA in supporting people with disabilities in the country,” he said.</p>
      <p>Kawemama added; “The government is aware of what development partners are doing in supporting children with disabilities to access education and other social services.”</p>
      <p>He however asked development partners to submit their quarterly implementation reports on their operations in the country so as to easily get support from the government.</p>
      <p>He said that by submitting their reports it will make it easier for the government to plan better for development and its people.</p>
      <p>“If the government would get implementation reports from development partners on projects they are carrying out in the country, it will help us to know who is doing what, where and when so as to avoid duplicating efforts,” Kawemama said.</p>
      <p>He urged development partners dealing with disability issues to submit their report to Prime Minister’s Office which is responsible with the people with disabilities.</p>
      <p>The official also reminded development partners in Tanzania to observe the existing laws, regulations and guidelines for them to operate smoothly.</p>
      <p>Earlier, the Italian Ambassador to Tanzania, Roberto Mengoni said the Italian non-for profit organisation- CEFA is implementing “All inclusive project” in Dar es Salaam in order to curb stigma and discrimination to people with disabilities.</p>
      <p>The envoy explained that in order to foster the inclusion of people with disabilities within Dar es Salaam, they have opened the rehabilitation office at Kawe in Kinondoni municipal.</p>
      <p>He said CEFA wants to face those problems by adopting a holistic rehabilitation approach on community basis that involve medical health rehabilitation, economic progress and social education inclusion.</p>
      <p>Gloria Mataba a teacher at Kawe primary school explained that her school is among 15 primary schools that benefits from CEFA project since 2017.</p>
      <p>She explained that through all-inclusive project they opened an inclusive youth club at the school which involves both children with disabilities and those with no disabilities.</p>
      <p>“The school have benefited with inclusive education that helps to reduce stigma and discrimination to persons with disabilities,” she said.</p>
