      <p><i><b>SIR:</b> </i>If we don’t do it — if we don’t even try — we will not be able to ensure the integrity of elections or the decency of the public sphere. If we don’t do it, in the long term there won’t even be a public sphere, and there won’t be functional democracies anymore, either. Anne Applebaum</p>
      <p>Social media have made tremendous impacts on human communication but the great threats it poses to fundamental laws and culture of society raises the question of whether it fits for purpose or not. The rising problems of fake news, misinformation, hate speech, invasion of privacy, among others give cause for concern. Time and again, the United States’ lawmakers have summoned the key drivers of internet technology such as Facebook and Google to address these problems. Across the globe, government is not complacent on the ‘erosion of civility’ on these platforms.</p>
      <p>In Nigeria, the federal government is fully prepared to take the bulls by the horns as echoed in the words of the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed. The senate appears poised to pass the Protection from the Internet Falsehood and Manipulations Bill into law as quickly as possible.</p>
      <p>While the Nigerian government may not have the power to hold the tech companies accountable, it aims to set the boundaries for social media users whose ambitions are to ignite hatred, propaganda, and violence by spreading misinformation and disinformation on the platform.</p>
      <p>However, this hard-lined approach of the federal government has sparked public debate with considerable opposition. There is a growing suspicion that the federal government is on a mission to tamper with the people’s right to freedom of expression due to its records of hostility to the opposition. Those who disagree assert that it is a mechanism to censor contents considered unfriendly to the government of the day.</p>
      <p>But some reasons point to the contrary and make it important to have a social media environment that is properly under check. In this digital age, unregulated social media equals a lawless and fragile society that can break up easily. It is no longer news that terrorist groups, ethnic bigots, politicians and the likes use social media to provoke violence. The Cambridge Analytica data scandal in the US, Christchurch massacre in New Zealand that was viewed live on Facebook by millions of people and the clone rumour of President Muhammadu Buhari amplified through social media are few examples. The social media environment need to be policed to enforce orderliness and keep it safe. It is the key responsibility of the tech companies as well as government to provide the mechanism for this to happen.</p>
      <p>If the traditional media which are largely controlled by professionals are under regulation, why should we not regulate social media that has far-reaching effect on the public? The internet providers have admitted that the overwhelming amount of information that go online makes it impossible to effectively police harmful content. Hence, the need for government intervention.</p>
      <p>Besides, it is counterproductive if the contents that dominate social media do not reflect the true ideals of our society. We need a media environment that will tolerate pluralism of ideas, thoughts, and opinions but we must draw the lines in the sand to safeguard our culture and democracy from destruction.</p>
      <p>Overall, the government mustn’t deviate from the real reasons behind the planned regulation which is to solve problems such as fake news and hate speech. It should not introduce instrument(s) that will breach the right to freedom of speech as obtainable in an authoritarian regime like China. Otherwise, the arguments against the planned regulation need to be considered.</p>
