      <h2>Dombivili-based Dhananjay Prabhune will make his silver screen debut with Ram Gopal Varma's Kamma Rajyamlo Kadapa Reddlu.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T07:38:46+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 07:38</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/pti/" target="_blank">PTI</a></address>
      <p>Former autorickshaw driver Dhananjay Prabhune, a lookalike of former Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu who was spotted by director Ram Gopal Varma, says acting in Telugu films has changed his life.</p>
      <p>Prabhune, who will be seen playing Chandrababu Naidu in Varma’s upcoming Telugu directorial Kamma Rajyamlo <a href="https://indianexpress.com/elections/kadapa-lok-sabha-election-results/">Kadapa</a> Reddlu, was honoured by the local rickshaw union on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Talking to the media, Prabhune praised the director and his crew for taking special care of him during the shooting of the film.</p>
      <p>The people of Andhra were very kind and the food was tasty, he said, adding that he loved working in the Telugu film industry.</p>
      <p>Dhananjay Prabhune said his life has transformed after getting the opportunity to act in Telugu films.</p>
      <p>Kalu Komatkar, president of the rickshaw union, said the auto drivers were proud that one of their fellowmen had found a place in movies, that too in the south film industry.</p>
      <p>This is a great honour for us, Komatkar added.</p>
      <p>Dombivili-based Dhananjay Prabhune used to drive rickshaw and later started a hotel in the temple town of Trimbakeshwar in Nashik district.</p>
      <p>Last year, while in Trimbakeshwar, he shot to fame as Chandrababu Naidu lookalike after a tourist shared a video of Prabhune serving food. The social media post went viral and caught Ram Gopal Varma’s attention.</p>
      <p>Varma, best known for films Satya, Shiva, Kaun? among more, posted a tweet, asking people to help trace the man in the clip. The filmmaker even announced a reward of Rs 1 lakh to the one who found Dhananjay Prabhune.</p>
      <p>Prabhune was tracked within hours. Ram Gopal Varma was then making Lakshmi’s NTR, a biographical drama based on the life of former film actor and Chief Minister of undivided Andhra Pradesh, NT Rama Rao.</p>
      <p>Though actor Sritej played Chandrababu Naidu in Lakshmi’s NTR, Varma cast Dhananjay Prabhune in the role of the former CM in Kamma Rajyamlo Kadapa Reddlu.</p>
