      <p>That is the view of <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/formula-1/ferrari/"><b>Ferrari</b></a> driver <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/sebastian-vettel/"><b>Sebastian Vettel</b></a>, who like Hulkenberg is German.</p>
      <p>Hulkenberg never finished on the podium during his decade on the grid, but Vettel says there is no doubt that he is good enough for Formula 1.</p>
      <p>"It's a strange situation because I've known Nico since we raced each other in childhood," Vettel is quoted by Marca.</p>
      <p>"The fact that a driver like him doesn't have a seat is very bitter. It's an example of the fact that some things are wrong in Formula 1.</p>
      <p>"I hope he comes back because he has the potential to be here and I don't want to be the only German," he added.</p>
      <p>Hulkenberg's current <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/formula-1/renault/"><b>Renault</b></a> teammate, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/daniel-ricciardo/"><b>Daniel Ricciardo</b></a>, also said he hopes the German returns to F1 in the future.</p>
      <p>"He definitely has the skills to come back," he is quoted by Speed Week.</p>
      <p>"I'm not afraid for him if he doesn't come back, as he's bright and quite enterprising. If he decides to do something else, he can handle it," he said.</p>
