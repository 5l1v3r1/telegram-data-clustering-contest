      <p>Mercedes-Benz South Africa has quietly added the diesel-powered A200d variant to its <a href="https://www.carmag.co.za/news/new-mercedes-benz-a-class-sedan-officially-revealed/">A-Class Sedan</a> range.</p>
      <p>Of course, we shared <a href="https://www.carmag.co.za/news/new-mercedes-benz-class-sedan-sa-pricing-revealed/">pricing</a> for the A200 and A250 Sport sedan derivatives back in February 2019 and this the A200d Sedan slots in between these two petrol-powered model, starting at <b>R570 400</b>.</p>
      <p>As in the <a href="https://www.carmag.co.za/news/pricing-mercedes-benz-a200d-coming-south-africa/">hatchback</a> version, the A200d Sedan offers 110 kW and 320 N.m from its 2,0-litre four-cylinder turbodiesel heart, directed to the front axle via an eight-speed dual-clutch transmission (as opposed to the seven-speed items used by the aforementioned petrol models). The sprint from zero to 100 km/h takes a claimed 8,2 seconds, with top speed coming in at 227 km/h.</p>
      <p>The A200d ships standard on 17-inch alloys, although the local arm of the Stuttgart-based firm offers a range of optional wheels, measuring up to 19 inches in diameter. Other interesting extras include an AMG Line exterior styling package (R50 175), a panoramic sliding sunroof (R15 200) and a Burmester surround sound system (R10 200).</p>
      <p>The A-Class Sedan shares its 2 729 mm wheelbase with its hatchback sibling, but measures 4 549 mm long, 1 796 mm wide and 1 446 mm high. Claimed luggage capacity comes in at 420 litres.</p>
