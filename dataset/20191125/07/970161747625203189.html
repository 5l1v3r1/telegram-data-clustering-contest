      <p>South Korean police have issued a statement on Goo Hara’s death, ruling out foul play and confirming a note from the K-pop star was found at the scene.</p>
      <p>Former Kara star <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/24/k-pop-star-former-kara-member-goo-hara-found-dead-28-11209087/">Goo Hara was found dead on Sunday</a> at the age of 28, just weeks after her close friend <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/14/k-pop-star-sulli-found-dead-aged-25-10913196/">Sulli died in a suspected suicide.</a></p>
      <p>Commissioner Lee Yong Pyo of the Seoul <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/metropolitan-police/">Metropolitan Police</a> Agency confirmed that they are not investigating a crime in relation to Goo Hara’s passing.</p>
      <p>The Commissioner said: ‘Yesterday (November 24), around 6 p.m., Goo Hara’s housekeeper discovered her. Based on an on-site inspection and testimony from her family, there are no suspicions of a crime.</p>

      <p>No other person visited Goo Hara’s home between that time and her housekeeper discovering her body at 6pm.</p>
      <p>The Commissioner continued: ‘The housekeeper had maintained a close relationship with Goo Hara for a long time. She went to her home after she attempted to contact Goo Hara and received no response.’</p>
      <p>He added: ‘There was a handwritten note found on a table in her living room. There is nothing we can reveal about the contents of the note.</p>

      <p>Regarding the possibility of an autopsy being carried out, the Commissioner stated: ‘We will decide after consulting with the prosecution while considering her family’s opinion and the results of the on-site inspection. Nothing has been decided as of now.’</p>
      <p>Goo Hara’s shocking death comes after he had allegedly attempted to take her own life after leaving a series of worrying messages on Instagram back in May.</p>
      <p>The Mamma Mia singer had also shown distress after the death of former f(x) member Sulli last month, as <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/24/goo-hara-left-heartbreaking-message-for-friend-sulli-following-suspected-suicide-as-k-pop-star-found-dead-11211221/">Hara shared a tearful live video</a> with fans explaining that she couldn’t attend Sulli’s funeral because she was in Japan.</p>
      <p>Goo Hara rose to fame as a member of the K-pop girl group Kara, who debuted in 2007 under DSP media, releasing hit singles such as Cupid and Step, before disbanding in 2016.</p>
