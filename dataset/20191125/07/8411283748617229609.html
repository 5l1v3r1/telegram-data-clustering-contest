      <h1>Intel CPU shortages may affect SSD adoption in PCs in 2020</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T07:30:45+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 07:30</time> by <a rel="author">Siu Han, Taipei; Joseph Tsai, DIGITIMES</a></address>
      <p>Intel's CPU shortages are expected to continue haunting the PC industry in the first quarter of 2020, and may even last into the second quarter, undermining demand for SSDs from the PC sector next year, according to sources from the upstream supply chain.</p>
      <p>With demand turning strong, PC shipments in the second half of 2019 are expected to improve from the first. The penetration rate of SSD in PC products has also risen to 55-60% in the second half, as consumer SSD prices have dropped to the sweet spot, the sources noted.</p>
      <p>But the Intel CPU shortages could dampen PC shipment momentum, slowing down demand for SSDs, the sources said.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20191121VL201.html">Digitimes Research's figures</a> show the global top-5 notebook brands' combined shipments rose 8% on year in October, the fourth consecutive month of on-year increase.</p>
      <p>Despite a possible setback in SSD adoption in PCs, demand for NAND flash is still expected to increase from consumer electronics such as True Wireless Stereo (TWS) earbuds, wearables and smart speakers in 2020, the sources said.</p>
