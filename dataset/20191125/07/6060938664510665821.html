      <p>Harbhajan quoted a tweet from Congress MP <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/shashi-tharoor">Shashi Tharoor</a>, who represents Thiruvananthapuram in the Lok Sabha, to make his point.</p>
      <p>Tharoor had expressed disappointment at the 25-year-old Kerala player not getting an opportunity.</p>
      <p>"Very disappointed to see @IamSanjuSamson dropped without a chance. He carried the drinks for three T20Is &amp; has been promptly discarded. Are they testing his batting or his heart?" he asked.</p>
