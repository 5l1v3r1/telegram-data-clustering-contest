      <h1>'Twiggy' Forrest's $440m plastics plan supported by big companies</h1>

      <p>Australian iron ore billionaire Andrew "Twiggy" Forrest says his ambitious plan to tackle ocean pollution by raising the raw cost of making plastic from fossil fuels has secured the support of leading global petrochemical giants including Saudi Aramco, the most profitable company in the world.</p>
      <p>Mr Forrest, the founder of mining giant Fortescue Metals Group and prominent philanthropist, is embarking on a week-long national tour with wife Nicola to meet political and business leaders to discuss their Minderoo Foundation, including its latest push to arrest the flow of single-use plastics into the ocean.</p>

      <p>The Minderoo Foundation has committed $US300 million ($440 million) to the campaign that aims to incentivise businesses to pay a voluntary contribution to push up the cost of manufacturing polymer from oil and gas. This would make it cheaper to manufacture it using plastic waste. Polymer sells for between $1000 and $1800 a tonne, Mr Forrest said.</p>
      <p>Under the proposal, the extra cost per tonne of polymer made from fossil fuels would be passed onto consumer brands, meaning the contribution would be "fully reimbursed", adding value for businesses by helping companies shift from fossil fuels as well as creating a commodity out of plastic waste.</p>
      <p>"If you elevate the price of polymer per tonne from fossil fuel up by, say, $500 dollars a tonne, then all recycling worldwide getting polymer from plastic, not fossil fuels, instantly becomes economic," he said.</p>
      <p>"As it's a minimum $1000 a tonne, that's a $350 billion per annum business here to tap into ... soon growing to 500 billion tonnes a year or a $US500 million business per annum. So you've got that massive scale of business if you're a petrochem to get into while you save the environment and get fully refunded for doing so."</p>
      <p>So far, Mr Forrest said, the voluntary plan has gained the support of Saudi Arabian oil and gas giant Saudi Aramco, south-east Asia's biggest petrochemical company Reliance Industries and consumer goods giants Coca-Cola and Unilever.</p>
      <p>"Business-wise, you’d have to be a barking old dinosaur not to do it," he said. "There are barking old dinosaurs out there who just don’t do change. But there are also incredibly good companies."</p>
      <p>Mr Forrest, 57, is ranked on the <i>Financial Review</i>'s Rich List as Australia's eighth-richest person. He and his wife are among Australia's biggest philanthropists, having given their Minderoo Foundation $1.5 billion in contributions.</p>
      <p>Minderoo's inaugural chief executive officer, Andrew Hagger, said the past year had been one of “significant expansion” from six focus areas to eight, including the oceans and plastics initiative.</p>
      <p>"What has enabled that to happen has been the remarkable generosity of Andrew and Nicola," Mr Hagger said. "That gives us the significant resources and capacity to tackle these significant world issues."</p>
