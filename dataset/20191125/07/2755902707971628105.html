      <p>The ruling party Zanu-PF has rubbished rumors of a purported  rift between President Mnangagwa and his deputy Dr Constantino Chiwenga who returned home from China on Saturday morning following a prolonged illness.</p>
      <p>Upon his arrival, <a href="https://iharare.com/vp-chiwenga-back-in-zim-welcomed-by-chinese-ambassador/">the rumor mill went into overdrive after he was welcomed by the Chinese deputy ambassador without any government official in sight.</a> There were whispers that President Mngangagwa wasn’t even aware that his deputy was coming back, which led many to believe that tensions were rife between the two men.</p>
      <p>However Chiwenga went on to tell the media that had it not been for President Mnangagwa’s quick intervention to send him to China for medical care, he would be history.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, Zanu-PF national spokesperson Simon Khaya-Moyo said such purported claims did not exist and should not be dignified.</p>
      <aside>“There is nothing like that. That is wishful thinking,” briefly said Khaya-Moyo.</aside>
      <p>He said the party was happy with Chiwenga’s recovery and return to the country in good health.</p>
      <aside>“The revolutionary Zanu-PF party welcomes home the indomitable Vice President Retired General Dr Constantino Chiwenga after a spell in the people’s Republic of China for medical attention.<br/>“The Vice President is also Second Secretary of our glorious party. I’ve no doubt that every patriotic Zimbabwean is filled with warmth, delight for his recovery and return. God is great and we praise Him with great reverence. He is indeed worth the praise,” said Cde Khaya Moyo.</aside>
      <p>President<a href="https://www.sundaynews.co.zw/vp-chiwenga-commends-president-says-he-is-ready-to-start-work/"> Mnangagwa said Chiwenga’s illness had troubled him hence the engagement of the Chinese Government</a> for his medical treatment.</p>
      <aside>“When he left, he was unwell, which was giving us sleepless nights because our comrade was unwell. So, we arranged for him to go to South Africa and while he was there, we spoke to our Chinese friends, we spoke to President Xi Jinping, who is our dear friend, who offered to assist with his treatment.<br/>We saw it fit for the VP to go to China. We flew him there and he stayed there for a number of months. Now you can see for yourselves that he has regained his fitness and he is clear-minded. When he initially left, he was having memory lapses, and he was in so much pain that everyone could tell the agony he was in,” said President Mnangagwa.</aside>
