        <b>The pressure on <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/arsenal-fc/">Arsenal</a> manager <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/unai-emery/">Unai Emery</a> was ramped up on Saturday when head of football, Raul Sanllehi, visited the team’s dressing room after the below-par draw with Southampton at the Emirates.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Gunners scraped a 2-2 draw with the relegation-threatened Saints thanks to a 96th minute <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/alexandre-lacazette/">Alexandre Lacazette</a> goal after conceding 21 shots on their goal.</p>
      <p>The result made it six games without a win for Emery’s side in all competitions and eighth in the Premier League, eight points off the top four.</p>
      <p>Such was the poor nature of the performance and the result, that Sanllehi took it upon himself to come into the dressing room after the game, reports the <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/unai-emery-on-borrowed-time-as-arsenal-line-up-mikel-arteta-rfvkz0g6k">Times.</a></p>
      <p>The head of football held a meeting two weeks ago at the Emirates in which he explained that performances had not been good enough, and his appearance in the dressing room will have heaped more pressure on the struggling Emery.</p>

      <p>Emery’s future was always going to be up for discussion in the summer as he entered the final year of his three-year contract, but these woeful performances may force the hand of the Arsenal hierarchy.</p>

      <p>The Gunners are reportedly considering Mikel Arteta and Max Allegri as possible successors to the Spaniard, and will move to sack Emery and appoint one of them before the end of the season unless results improve.</p>
      <p>Arsenal’s next four games are all winnable, but that makes them all the more high-pressure for Emery as they will be expected to pick up maximum points Eintracht Frankfurt in the Europa League, followed by Norwich, Brighton and West Ham in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>Continued failure in terms of results and performances over these four games could see the Arsenal boss sacked comfortably before Christmas.</p>
      <p>Arteta and Allegri were both interviewed for the Arsenal job in the summer of 2018 when Emery took over and the Gunners are clearly regretting their decision.</p>
      <p>Former Gunners midfielder Arteta is working as an assistant coach to Pep Guardiola at Manchester City, although the Premier League champions have said they will not stand in his way if he wants to take the top job at the Emirates.</p>
      <p>Allegri is out of work since leaving Juventus at the end of last season and has regularly been linked with a move to the Premier League, having been learning English for some time.</p>
      <p>Arsenal host Frankfurt on Thursday and in their current form, with Frankfurt fans banned from the trip for disturbances in a previous Europa League fixture, there are concerns that there could be the lowest attendance in Emirates history.</p>
