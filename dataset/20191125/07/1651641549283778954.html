      <h1>More than $8 billion worth of Tesla Cybertrucks already reserved! Update: Now at least $10 billion in pre-orders</h1>

      <p>Telsa’s share price dropped nearly 6% on the announcement of the <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/tag/telsa-cybertruck/">Tesla Cybertruck,</a> likely due to the very controversial design, but it seems those who like it, like it a lot.</p>
      <p>On Twitter, Elon Musk has just announced the Tesla CyberTruck pre-order numbers and surprisingly 146,000 people have already placed reservations for the vehicle.</p>

      <p>Surprisingly only 17% of buyers chose the cheapest $39,900 single motor version, while a massive 41% chose the most expensive tri-motor version. In theory, the Tesla CyberTruck pre-order numbers amount to more than $8 billion in pre-orders.</p>
      <p>The numbers will be compared with the Tesla Model 3, which managed more than 500,000 pre-orders with a much larger $1000 deposit required. You only need to put down $100 to pre-order a Tesla Cybertruck.</p>
      <p><b>Update</b>: Elon Musk added the next day that another 41,000 reservations have been received, adding a minimum of $1.6 billion to the total value of the pre-orders.</p>

      <p><b>Update 2</b>: Musk has posted another update, putting the total reservations at 200,000, and the total pe-orders at more than $10 billion in value.</p>
