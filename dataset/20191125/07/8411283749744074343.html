      <p>China-based handset maker Hauqin Telecom Technology has ventured into the notebook ODM business by securing orders for entry-level and mid-range notebooks from Acer and Asustek Computer, according to a Chinese-language <i>Economic Daily News </i>report.</p>
      <p>This is the first time that Taiwan-based notebook vendors have released orders to a China-based ODM, having previously relied solely on Taiwan-based manufacturing partners, including Quanta Computer and Compal Electronics.</p>
      <p>Established since 2005, Hauqin is currently one of the top-two handset ODMs in China, and the company's ODM handset shipments are expected to reach 90 million units in 2019, up from 84 million units shipped a year earlier, noted the report.</p>
      <p>With assistance from Intel, Huaqin began to tap into the notebook ODM business in 2016 and also received investment funds from the US chipmaker at the end of 2017. It shipped 1.5 million ODM notebooks in 2018 with the volume to increase to 4.2 million units in 2019, said the report.</p>
