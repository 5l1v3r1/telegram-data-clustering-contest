      <p>LONDON, UK and SOUTHLAKE, TEXAS – One year into its relationship with <b>Sabre Hospitality Solutions</b>, <b>Small Luxury Hotels of the World</b> (SLH) is seeing the benefits of connecting with Sabre’s industry-leading distribution solutions, allowing it to grow its portfolio and better serve customers.</p>
      <p>Sabre and SLH completed the integration of Sabre’s SynXis Central Reservations and device-responsive booking engine last year, giving SLH customers access to Sabre’s industry-leading technology platform, which not only better optimizes global distribution channels, but also delivers greater scale and operational efficiency to lower costs. All SLH hotels in 80 countries around the world have adopted the new technology, and new SLH member hotels will also stand to benefit from the SynXis Platform’s distribution and retailing solutions. </p>
      <p><i>“Since completing a successful implementation, we are already seeing some positive results in higher booking volume, resulting in more hotels that want to join SLH to get access to distribution services,”</i> said <b>Richard Hyde</b>, chief operating officer at SLH.</p>
      <p>The distribution landscape is becoming more complex and competitive. Consumers have access to an unprecedented number of options to shop and book hotels, with new choices continually emerging. It is increasingly risky for hoteliers to treat the channels as unified booking sources.</p>
      <p><i>“Hospitality providers like SLH need access to robust technology solutions as well as a broad network of channels to reach customers where they are and increase conversions,” </i>said<b> Frank Trampert</b>, managing director and CCO APAC and EMEA of Sabre Hospitality Solutions. “At Sabre, distribution is at the core of what we do, and our solutions are widely used and respected throughout the industry. Our goal is to deliver market-leading innovations for the hospitality industry, and we will continue to invest in our technology platform. We expect this to help SLH significantly grow revenue for its partner hotels all over the world.”</p>
      <p>SynXis Central Reservations allows hotels to distribute their rates and inventory to over 400 online channels worldwide, including all major GDS systems, hundreds of online travel agencies (OTAs), metasearch engines and call centers. In line with groundbreaking technology and digital trends, Sabre also offers a booking engine with built-in dynamic personalization along with a full suite of digital services that range from web design and marketing to building AI-powered digital touchpoints for consumer engagement.</p>
