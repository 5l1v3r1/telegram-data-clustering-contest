        <b>Salman Khan’s upcoming film Radhe requires him to commence work asap and reportedly it could be difficult for him to juggle both the movie and his hosting duties on Bigg Boss 13. The show’s telecast schedule has been extended by 4 weeks</b>

      <p>There are strong rumours that superstar Salman Khan might quit Bigg Boss 13 mid-season. The superstar has been associated with the show for the 10th time now and online reports claim that he might step down. This season is replete with drama, controversies, verbal and physical fights and a dash of romance, thanks to it’s contestants – Sidharth Shukla, Rashami Desai, Asim Riaz, Shehnaaz Gill, Himanshi Khurana, Devoleena Bhattacharjee, Paras Chhabra, Hindustani Bhau and others.</p>
      <p>A few days back <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/television/television-news/bigg-boss-13-show-getting-an-extension-of-3-to-4-weeks-so-more-chillam-chilli-bi-hing-and-flings-exclusive/5dd6ca650cada251e9c31089">we reported that the show that has been garnering great TRPs will now be extended by another 4 weeks</a>. Which means, Salman Khan will also need to make the required changes in his film calendar, to alot the show extra time. According to a report in Pinkvilla, the superstar might not be able to do so and hence is likely to exit the show before Season 13’s winner is announced. <b><a href="https://www.spotboye.com/television/television-news/bigg-boss-13-nov-25-2019-spoiler-alert-rashami-desai-sidharth-shukla-get-cosy-in-bed-as-they-re-create-a-scene-what/5ddb412e0cada251e9c31218">ALSO READ: Bigg Boss 13 Nov 25 2019 SPOILER ALERT: Rashami Desai - Sidharth Shukla Get Cosy In Bed As They Re-Create A Scene - WHAT</a></b></p>

      <p>The channel is desperately trying to convince Salman to extend his tenure but in the current scenario an extension will spell disaster for Radhe that is scheduled to be shot across exotic International locations, claim reports.<br/><br/><br/>Image Source:- twitter/BeingSalmanKhan, headlinezpro, instagram/beingsalmankhan</p>
