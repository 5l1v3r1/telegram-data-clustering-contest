      <p>Richa has been quoted by PTI saying, “Bollywood has taught me that if you have talent and are ready to work without massive ego, complications, if you can keep sane and keep working, then you’re in it for a long haul. I’m very inspired by people like Ranveer Singh who, in his mega-stardom, still goes out and works as hard as he did in his first. That hunger to do better shouldn’t ever die. The minute someone gets complacent it reflects.”</p>
      <p>On the professional front, Richa will return to the digital world with Inside Edge where she will be seen reprising her character of Zarina Malik from the Amazon Prime series, <i>Inside Edge 2</i>.</p>
      <p><i>Inside Edge 2</i> also stars Vivek Oberoi, Sayani Gupta, Angad Bedi, Sapna Pabbi among others and two will stream from December 6.</p>
