      <p>Banking on the group’s N10 billion asset base,  OxfordCal is set to re-define property leasing, sales and investment in Nigeria.</p>
      <p>In addition to the group’s core business of selling and leasing of landed properties andsale of real estate investment,  it is also saddled with the payments of commissions and granting of short-term loans.</p>
      <p>Its Managing Director, Mr. Leke Balogun said selling of real estate investment is “buying into Oxford Project of perimeter fencing, gate house and creating communal living such as residential estates which translates into a rich future for investors.”</p>
      <p>The company further launched other subsidiaries that will deal with specific aspects of real estate such as real estate management, homes and gardens, landscaping and consultancy services.</p>
      <p>The Oxford Group Chief Executive, Dr.Teniola Adesanya,  the subsidiaries was borne out of the need to re-define the way people do businesses.</p>

      <p>“In the case of legal service, for instance, it has been what  most lawyers use to make money, but in our conglomerate we are offering legal services at no cost.</p>
      <p>“Also we want to ensure that most of these landed properties that people get at very high cost are brought down to its barest to afford more people the opportunity to own their personal houses”.</p>
      <p>He said the group’s properties transversed 30 locations, including Lagos, Oyo  and Ogun states, in  such places like Ipaja, Lekki and Ikorodu. Others are Lagun and Eleyele in Ibadan and Agbara, Atan-Otta, Ewekoro and Abeokuta in Ogun State.</p>
