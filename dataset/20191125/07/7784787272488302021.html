      <h3>An investigation into Brisbane young gun David Fifita’s ill-fated Bali trip may take weeks to conclude, NRL CEO Todd Greenberg says.</h3>
      <p>Fifita was the subject of an NRL integrity unit probe when he returned to Australia a fortnight ago after a three-day stint in a Bali jail following an alleged assault on a nightclub security guard.</p>

      <p>Facing more than two years in jail for assault, Fifita ensured his release by paying compensation out of his own pocket to reach a peace settlement with the security guard.</p>

      <p>Greenberg said he was aware that there was pressure for a quick outcome to the investigation but claimed the NRL integrity unit was in no rush.</p>
      <p>Asked why the investigation was ongoing, Greenberg said on Monday: “The integrity unit hasn’t completed their investigation, that’s the simple answer.</p>

      <p>Fifita’s alleged incident took place at the same nightclub where Melbourne’s Nelson Asofa-Solomona was involved in a wild brawl a month ago. The giant Storm prop copped a three game ban and a suspended $15,000 fine from the NRL.</p>

      <p>But Greenberg wouldn’t speculate on a potential punishment for the 19-year-old Fifita.</p>
      <p>“We are in an international jurisdiction. We have to have discussions with people overseas and different agencies so I want to make sure we get it right,” he said of the Fifita investigation.</p>
      <p>“It’s about getting to the bottom of the information, making sure we speak to the appropriate people.</p>
      <p>“When we make sure we land on a decision, whatever that decision might be, we have all the information in front of us.”</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Greenberg confirmed Penrith playmaker Tyrone May would still be bound by the NRL’s “no fault stand down” rule after pleading guilty to four charges of intentionally recording an intimate image without consent last Friday.</p>

      <p>May was stood down from playing duties under the NRL’s “no fault” rule following his arrest on March 5.</p>
      <p>May will appear again in court for sentencing on January 31.</p>

      <p>“The no fault stand down is retained right through until the completion of sentencing, I understand that will happen at the end of January,” Greenberg said.</p>
      <p>“And once that is fully completed in the courts then we will reassess the situation.</p>
      <p>“The no fault stand down ensures he can train throughout that period so there is no changes to the sanctions for the player until the end of sentencing.”</p>
