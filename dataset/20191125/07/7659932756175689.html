      <p>The Nineveh provincial council’s election of Lt. Gen. Najm al-Jubouri as governor to replace Mansour al-Mareed stirred a political and legal dispute in Iraq on Sunday.<br/><br/>“The dismissal of the former governor and the election of a new one are considered two unconstitutional and illegitimate moves,” legal expert Ahmad al-Abadi told Asharq Al-Awsat.<br/><br/>He said that based on Article 7 of the provincial councils law No. 21 of 2008, the election of a new governor is not valid if all legal measures are not completed, including an appeal against decisions issued by the provincial councils before the Cassation Chamber within 30 days.<br/><br/>In light of this law, the dismissed or resigned governor stays in office until a decision is issued by the administrative judiciary, in addition to a presidential decree on his dismissal and the appointment of a new governor, the expert said.<br/><br/>“Therefore, the election of a new governor is considered invalid because the mandate of the current provincial council has expired,” Abadi said.<br/><br/>However, MP Mohammed al-Karbouli defended the election and said it was consistent with the laws of provincial councils valid until March 2020.<br/><br/>“We support the election of Jubouri and we wish him luck in managing the governorate, which needs a lot of work to return to normalcy,” the deputy said.<br/><br/>On Sunday, Jubouri was elected by 22 out of 39 council member votes.<br/><br/>The new governor was a former major general in the Iraqi security forces and a former commander of the Nineveh Operations in the past few years.<br/><br/>Following his election, Mareed rejected the decision of the provincial council, describing it as illegitimate. "I will continue to carry out my duties as governor," he affirmed.</p>
