      <h1>Government to shake up cash payment oversight in wake of housing scandal</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T07:49:31+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 07:49</time> by <a rel="author">Nathan Hondros</a></address>
      <p>Bureaucrats in charge of taxpayers' money will face tougher scrutiny as the government moves to ensure audits are overseen by external experts and with the state's auditor general to conduct targeted forensic investigations of the public service's finances.</p>
      <p>Premier Mark McGowan has also directed the Public Sector Commission to examine whether public servants could be immediately suspended without pay if they are accused of corruption or fraudulent activity.</p>

      <p>In a raft of changes announced by Mr McGowan and Finance Minister Ben Wyatt, the Housing Authority, which has been the focus of a possible $40 million corruption investigation that has already seen charges laid against former deputy director general Paul Whyte, will also be broken up.</p>
      <p>Social housing and other non-commercial functions will remain with the Department of Communities, while land development and related commercial functions will be merged with DevelopmentWA, a newly merged entity comprising of LandCorp and the Metropolitan Redevelopment Authority.</p>
      <p>The Premier said the restructure of the Housing Authority and changes to DevelopmentWA would take time and require legislative amendments.</p>
      <p>They would also have a financial impact on the state budget.</p>
      <p>Mr McGowan also announced details of a Public Sector Commission review of the Department of Communities in the wake of the alleged fake invoicing scheme.</p>
      <p>It would "examine the governance, legal and administrative systems at the Housing Authority, and where relevant the Department of Communities".</p>
      <p>The shake-up of the Housing Authority comes after significant "machinery of government" changes introduced by the McGowan government after the 2017 state election.</p>
      <p>Mr McGowan said he had "already introduced a number of legislative and administrative changes that have been successful in delivering quality services and exposing improper conduct".</p>

      <p>"Today, we take a further step by announcing a number of individual reforms to identify poor practice and potential fraudulent conduct across the public sector," he said.</p>
      <p>"These are immediate and ongoing reforms that will also mean services are delivered better to the people that need them.</p>
      <p>"The independent review of the Housing Authority will also provide further advice as to what else can be done to ensure the public have the utmost confidence in their public sector."</p>
