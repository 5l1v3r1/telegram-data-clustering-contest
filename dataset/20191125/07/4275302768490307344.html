      <h1>Angus firm’s water system to be trialled in new development</h1>
      <h2>A water-saving system invented by an Angus firm is set to be trialled in London as it reaches the next stage of development.</h2>

      <p>Arbroath-based Cascade Water Products has created Aqua Gratis, which processes waste water from showers and baths which it then utilises to flush toilets.</p>
      <p>The small size of the Aqua Gratis means that it can be fitted into a domestic property and removes the need to use drinking water to flush the toilet, saving more than 30% of water in the average home.</p>
      <p>The three tank design allows debris to settle and traps floating debris, while treatment of the water using an organic biocide prevents odours while protecting the environment from harsh chemicals such as bleach.</p>
      <p>The next phase will see the product fitted to five new-build homes in the Greater London area, with an eye to increasing the number to 200 as part of a larger pilot project.</p>
      <p>Managing director Carolyn Hogg said the growing scarcity of water had seen the firm receive enquiries from across the globe.</p>
      <p>She said: “Currently, our target market is the Greater London area and we are currently in discussion with Thames Water, as well as housing associations.</p>
      <p>“There have been a number of international incidents where demand for water has outstripped supply – there is a serious water problem that has to be solved.</p>
      <p>“The system fits into a concealed panel in a downstairs toilet and it can be monitored remotely via a smart meter.</p>
      <p>“We have to bear in mind that water usage also adds to our carbon footprint, so reducing the amount of water we use makes a real contribution to the achieving a zero-carbon society.”</p>
      <p>An Aqua Gratis unit costs around £900 and Cascade Water Products say that manufacturing the next 200 units will take place in the firm’s Kirkton Industrial Estate premises in Arbroath, but the company is looking to scale up production to around 200,000 systems per annum.</p>
