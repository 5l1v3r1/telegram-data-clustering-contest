        <b>Emotions run high</b>
      </p>
      <p>K24 news anchor Anne Kiguta was on Sunday night overcome by emotions as she mourned her colleague and close personal friend, Daniel Chemjor who passed on in a car accident last Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Kiguta recalled how she and <a href="https://www.pulselive.co.ke/news/k24-journalist-daniel-chemjors-body-yet-to-be-retrieved-after-car-accident-in-deep/4ynb8e7">Chemjor had come a long way</a>, having started out their careers at around the same time thirteen years ago while working for KTN.</p>
      <p>Her message of condolence was briefly interrupted as she choked back tears, but nevertheless proceeded to mourn the late journalist.</p>
      <p>“<i>I remember the day we met in the corridors of the Standard Group. His first day there when we both began out television careers.</i></p>
      <p>“<i>I was a bright-eyed presenter and he was a trainee news director and we both rose through to the top of this profession as he became one of the finest news directors in this business. We reconnected here at Mediamax as he was among those who started this show, Punchline. He was actually supposed to direct tonight’s show</i>,” Kiguta stated.</p>
      <p>Chemjor’s car crashed shortly after he left the Big 5 Resort near Cheploch on the Iten-Kabarnet road where he had been having drinks with a friend.</p>
      <p>The vehicle rolled several times before landing into the deep Chebloch Gorge. His body was retrieved together with his car on Thursday morning.</p>
