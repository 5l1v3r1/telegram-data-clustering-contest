      <p>Ven. Ernest Onuoha, Vicar of All Saints Anglican Church, on Sunday, urged the National Assembly to remove the <a href="https://www.concisenews.global/2018/03/01/senate-considering-bill-to-make-hate-speech-punishable-by-death/">proposed death penalty</a> clause included in the hate speech bill before it.<br/><a href="http://concisenews.global/news">Concise News</a> reports that Onuoha, who made the call at the 2019 General Harvest, in Abuja, at the All Saints Church, Anglican Communion, noted that such law would create more problems and cause many heads to roll.<br/>According to him, life is sacred and every life belonged to God almighty, death penalty is not a solution to hate speech.<br/>”We have other things bothering the nation, people are suffering, roads are bad, people are unemployed and electricity is not working, these should be the focus of the government not hate speech.<br/>”If the people are not disappointed at the government, they will not go out of their way talking the way they are talking.<br/>”The people are speaking out this way because there is an indication of failure to address the problem of the masses.<br/>”Rather than enact death penalty for hate speech, government should make policies and pass Bills that will enhance the quality of life of Nigerians,” he said.<br/>Onuoha, however, urged Nigerians not to lose hope in the country and in the leadership as God was still in charge of Nigeria.<br/>”I believe strongly that God will heal, revive and restore Nigeria back to its glory, so the youths should continue hoping and looking on to God, who in His time will intervene,” he said.<br/>Also, Rev. Yusuf Jafalan, Bishop of Anglican Diocese of Kaduna, said that government should remove the death penalty clause in the hate speech bill because hate speech is directly or indirectly almost in everybody.<br/>Jafalan added that many people would die if that bill is passed, the government must give a dichotomy, else it would do more harm than good.<br/>He also advised the government to think about state policing to address insecurity, adding that the people in every community know those terrorising them.</p>
      <h3>Biafra: IPOB’s Nnamdi Kanu Reacts To Hate Speech Bill</h3>
      <p>In related news, the leader of the outlawed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) Nnamdi Kanu has claimed that the late Sardauna of Sokoto Ahmadu Bello was the progenitor of hate speech in Nigeria.</p>
      <p>This news medium understands that the pro-Biafra leader <a href="https://www.concisenews.global/2019/11/24/biafra-ipobs-nnamdi-kanu-reacts-to-hate-speech-bill/">Kanu said this in a reaction to the proposed Protection from Internet Falsehoods and Manipulations Bill, also known as anti-social media bill</a>.</p>
      <p>In a statement on Sunday, Kanu said: “Sir Ahmadu Bello the preliterate Fulani Caliphate feudal lord with his primitive xenophobic tendencies was and still remains the undisputed progenitor of hate speech and irredeemable hater of non-Muslim ethnic groups in the disastrous British colonial experiment known as Nigeria.</p>
      <p>“Fulani were the first to utilise hate speech to advance their domination of the political space in Nigeria, but today they want to stifle debate and criticism. I suggest this fact guide the thinking of Almajiri lawmakers sponsoring this bill.</p>
      <p>“Some inhabitants of the abominable damnation, especially those from the south-with their warped and misguided sense of patriotism, still accommodate the obnoxious and downright ignorant views of the Janjaweed unity begging desert-dwelling cow loving reprobates. Britain must close their African Zoo to help put the animals that inhabit it out of their collective misery and hopelessness.”</p>
