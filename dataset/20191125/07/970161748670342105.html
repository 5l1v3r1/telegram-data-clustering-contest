      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/joe-root/">Joe Root</a> admits he wants to see improvements from Jofra Archer after New Zealand smashed England in Tauranga.</p>
      <p>Archer took 1-107 from 42 overs in New Zealand’s sole innings as the hosts wrapped up an emphatic victory to take a 1-0 lead in the two-match series.</p>
      <p>The 24-year-old burst into the international scene last summer, starting in England’s <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/world-cup/">World Cup</a> triumph and the subsequent Ashes series.</p>
      <p>But Root insists Archer is a work in progress, telling Sky Sports after the defeat: ‘This has been a frustrating Test for Archer.</p>
      <p>‘He’s a hugely exciting talent and he has a huge amount of skill but he has to learn that there are certain spells where he needs to ramp it up more.</p>
      <p>‘He may have to bowl shorter spells. The energy and effort have to be there all the time.</p>

      <p>‘Jofra is a young guy at the start of his career. He’s never bowled with this ball before, these are foreign conditions and it will take time to adjust to that.</p>
      <p>‘He’s taken international cricket by storm but having too high an expectation of him at the start of his career is a dangerous thing.’</p>
      <p>New Zealand sailed past England’s first innings total of 353, with BJ Watling scoring a double century and Mitchell Santner posting his maiden Test ton as the Black Caps declared on 615-9 and took control of the match.</p>
      <p>England spent a gruelling 201 overs in the field before being bowled out for 197 on the final day.</p>
      <p>‘I can’t fault the effort levels,’ Root added. ‘We were trying to create pressure by bowling maidens when there wasn’t much in the surface.</p>
      <p>‘There were a few half chances that slipped away from us but we have to give credit to the oppositon who played very well on this surface.</p>
      <p>‘It will be important to see how the bowlers pull up as there has been a big workload.’</p>
