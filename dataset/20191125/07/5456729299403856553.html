      <p>Prominent on the health scene this week was the World Antibiotics Awareness week. The celebration is a one week awareness campaign on the importance of antibiotics and the dangers in the misuse of the medicine.</p>
      <p>Here is a roundup of major health stories in the news last week.</p>

        <b>HIV/AIDS: New infections still high in Nigeria – Official</b>
      </p>
      <p>As Nigeria prepares to join the rest of the world to commemorate the <b><a href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/health/health-news/364580-hiv-aids-new-infections-still-high-in-nigeria-official.html">World AIDS day</a></b> on December 1, the country still accounts for more than half of new infections and deaths from AIDS-related illnesses globally.</p>
      <p>The Director General of the National Agency for the Control of AIDS (NACA), Gambo Aliyu, said this at a press conference to commemorate the World AIDS Day (WAD).</p>
      <p>Mr Aliyu, on Thursday, also said “less than 40 per cent of adolescent and young people in Nigeria have comprehensive knowledge about HIV.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>Chronic viral hepatitis in Nigeria</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Ministry of Health says no fewer than <b><a href="https://www.channelstv.com/2019/11/23/at-least-16-million-individuals-in-nigeria-live-with-chronic-viral-hepatitis-fg/">16 million individuals</a></b> in Nigeria are living with chronic Hepatitis B and C virus.</p>
      <p>The ministry said the discovery is sequel to a National HIV/AIDS Indicator and Impact Survey carried out in 2018.</p>
      <p>A representative for Viral Hepatitis Control in Nigeria, Clement Adeshigbin, said in Taraba State, during a training organised for health workers on how to manage the disease, that viral hepatitis is now globally known to be 10 times more widespread than HIV/AIDS.</p>

        <b>Europe’s Prisons Not Monitoring Inmates’ Health – WHO</b>
      </p>
      <p>Prison authorities in Europe are not doing enough to <b><a href="https://www.channelstv.com/2019/11/21/europes-prisons-not-monitoring-inmates-health-says-who/">monitor the health of inmates</a></b>, meaning prisoners are more likely to suffer untreated conditions and are released without adequate support, the World Health Organisation said Thursday.</p>
      <p>The UN body warned that such failings will come at a “high cost” for society at large as they add to the public health burden.</p>
      <p>The WHO collected the data of 39 European countries between 2016 and 2017 and recommended that prisons test for tuberculosis, sexually transmitted diseases, mental health problems, and addictions.</p>

      <p>Receiving the report on ‘‘Funding Universal Healthcare Delivery in Nigeria’’ by the Senior Executive Course 41 of the National Institute for Policy and Strategic Studies (NIPSS), Kuru, President Buhari directed relevant agencies of government to review the submission and ensure its integration into ongoing policies and programmes.</p>
