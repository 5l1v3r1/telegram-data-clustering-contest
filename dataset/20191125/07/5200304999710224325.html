      <p>The much-awaited third installment of the ‘Munna Bhai M.B.B.S’ film franchise has been in the pipeline for a long while, and has by now become long overdue, with the first two movies releasing in 2003 and 2006, respectively.</p>
      <p>Thankfully, the movie is indeed being produced, but there are two issues in the production of the film that are stagnating the completion of the project. This information was confirmed by an unknown source to <i>Deccan Chronicle</i>, “The script of the third part of the film had some issues in the first half and one problem in the second half. The creative team has been working hard to solve that issue, but that has not been done because of a connecting problem. Rajkumar Hirani has been busy getting around four more scripts ready. With him being busy in the script development of the other films, he has not been able to devote time to get this in order.”</p>
