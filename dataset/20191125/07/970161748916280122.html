      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/joe-root/">Joe Root</a> has called for calm and backed his England team to respond after their crushing defeat in the opening Test against New Zealand.</p>
      <p>Attempting to bat out the final day to rescue a draw, England were bowled out with 21.4 overs remaining as they slipped to an emphatic innings-and-65-run loss.</p>
      <p>England made 353 in their first innings after winning the toss and electing to bat but BJ Watling (205) and Mitchell Santner (126) put the Kiwis in control on day three and four.</p>
      <p>Root’s side then failed to bat out the final four sessions of the match as New Zealand took a 1-0 lead in this two-match series.</p>
      <p>‘We missed an opportunity when you look at the two first innings in comparison,’ England captain Root said.</p>
      <p>‘We needed to get a score over 450 and to use that scoreboard pressure as an extra fielder.</p>

      <p>‘We did a lot of good stuff, we just need to do it for longer. It’s different to the style of cricket we’ve had to play in our home conditions. There is stuff to address.</p>
      <p>‘It ended up being a good wicket over the course of five days. It was the right decision at the toss but not kicking on in that first innings has cost us the game.</p>
      <p>‘We can’t panic and think it’s the end of the world. We are working hard behind the scenes and if we come back strong, we’ll hopefully level it up.’</p>
      <p>New Zealand skipper Kane Williamson added: ‘It feels great to win a Test match and it took a huge amount of work to get past their total. It was a really good wicket and it aged nicely.</p>
      <p>‘It was huge heart from our middle order to get over 600 and that gave us the only chance of winning.</p>
      <p>‘We had to apply ourselves as long as possible so we didn’t require a big batting effort batting last on this pitch.</p>
      <p>‘BJ Watling’s application at the crease and his focus, his patience to make good decisions for a long time are incredible.</p>
      <p>‘Apart from the odd delivery that reacted as you’d expect on a day five wicket it was still a good surface and our bowlers were outstanding.’</p>
