      <h1>Shabana Azmi to sanction film version of ‘Kaifi &amp; I’?</h1>

      <p>Shabana Azmi had previously played lead actress in the play ‘Kaifi &amp; I’, which was based on the accomplished lives of her parents Kaifi and Shaukat Azmi. Now, the actress has agreed to a remake of the play as a film, with four notable Bollywood producers wanting to champion the project.</p>
      <p>Azmi has one condition, though, which is that the producer must cast a younger pair that are fresh on the Bollywood scene. In her own words, Azmi was quoted in <i>Deccan Chronicle</i> as saying the following, “Javed and I have played the role on stage over and over again all over the world. We’ve taken the roles as far as we can. Now it’s time for other actors to see what they can do with the characters”.</p>
      <p>Sadly, Shabana’s mother Shaukat Kaifi passed away on Friday.</p>
