      <p>Dan Osborne said his wife Jacqueline Jossa was "emotional, dramatic and screams a lot" on I'm A Celeb.</p>
      <p>The former TOWIE star, 28, has been documenting his wife's I'm A Celeb journeys on his <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> stories as he tunes in to watch every night.</p>
      <p>In a honest post, the dad-of-three didn't mind pointing out his love got "emotional", "dramatic" and "screamed a lot".</p>
      <p>However, the reality star also drew attention to the fact Jacqueline always gets what she wants done.</p>

      <p>He said: "She's doing great. It's well out of her comfort zone. I said in an interview after the first episode, she'll shock everyone.</p>
      <p>"She'll do good. She do it. She might be an emotional person, she might be a little dramatic, she might scream a lot but she's getting it done and that's what matters."</p>
      <p>Dan had watched on in fear as the mother-of-two took part in the cave trial where she had to crawl into boxes to collect stars passed up to her by Ian Wright.</p>
      <p>However, there were a few nasty surprises in there including snakes and spiders.</p>

      <p>Incredibly impressed, Dan gushed his wife had made the Bushtucker Trial look "easy" when she performed it alongside Ian.</p>
      <p>"Jac and Ian did amazing in that trial," he enthused. "Went in there. Smashed it. Made it look easy.</p>
      <p>"There was a lot of screaming going on from both people but they absolutely nailed it."</p>
      <p>It comes after Dan made a sly dig at Jacqueline for crying ahead of the I'm A Celeb trials.</p>
      <p>He said: "I think it's good, if you go there, you're not going to enjoy the trials. There's a part of you wanting to do the trial.</p>
      <p>"You want to get out of camp and do as much as you can."</p>
