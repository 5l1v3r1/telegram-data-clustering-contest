      <h1>Bristol Sounds 2020: Noel Gallagher, Jack Savoretti, Supergrass and more announced for concert series</h1>
      <h2>The summer concert series is returning with a bang</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T07:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 07:00</time> by <a rel="author">Robin Murray</a></address>
      <p>A massive lineup has been revealed for Bristol Sounds 2020.</p>
      <p>The concert series has become a firm favourite for many in the city's summer calendar and this year included the likes of Elbow, Tom Misch and Bloc Party.</p>
      <p>In 2020 music fans will be treated to more big performances, this time from the likes of Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds, Supergrass, Jack Savoretti, The Levellers, Reef and more.</p>
      <p>And for the first time ever there will be an all-day Saturday show as part of next year's series, which will run from midday until 11pm, curated by the Levellers.</p>
      <h3>Who's playing on what day?</h3>

      <p>Wednesday, June 24 will see Noel Gallagher’s High Flying Birds return to Bristol having recently released their latest single, Wandering Star, taken from the forthcoming EP Blue Moon Rising.</p>
      <p>Fans of Gallagher will no doubt be delighted with his return to the city, following his incredible headline set at The Downs Festival in 2018.</p>
      <p>Supporting Noel are the Australian indie electro-pop outfit Confidence Man, whose debut album Confident Music for Confident People was named the best independent dance album in the Australian Independent Record Label Music Awards. </p>
      <p>On Thursday, June 25, Supergrass take to the stage. The Britpop four piece reunited in September of 2019, performing a 'surprise' performance at the annual Pilton Party in the same month, which means they are likely to perform at the festival's 50th anniversary.</p>
