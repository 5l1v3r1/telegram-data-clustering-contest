      <h3>Australia vs Pakistan day/night, second Test at Adelaide Oval, every ball live and ad free on Fox Cricket.</h3>
      <p>Romanian cult figure Pavel Florin has had another successful performance while representing Victorian suburban cricket club Surrey Hills on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Florin took 3-10 in two overs and backed it up with three catches in the field.</p>
      <p>In his first match for the club last week, he took one wicket and asked questions of the opposition batsmen with his unique bowling style, which initially saw him rise to fame.</p>

      <p>Unfortunately for Australian fans, this could be the last time we see Florin in action.</p>
      <p>He was invited by Surrey Hills to play two exhibition games and since he has now fulfilled his role, he will fly back to Romania this week.</p>

      <p>“The grenade still working — 3/10 runs in two overs.</p>
      <p>“Is not matter is park or stadium, the value of the league, people around you and the joy of playing is everything you need.”</p>
