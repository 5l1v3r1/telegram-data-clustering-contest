      <h1>Western United searching for shooting boots</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T07:10:46+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 07:10</time> by <a rel="author">Michael Lynch</a></address>
      <p>No one doubts the character and attitude of Mark Rudan's Western United.</p>
      <p>But they will need to find their shooting boots - and quickly - if they are to maintain what has, until the past two weeks, been an excellent start to their A-League life.</p>
      <p>The coach praised his team's mindset and dispelled any suggestion of a rift with striker Besart Berisha after the latter looked frosty after being substituted in the game against Central Coast on Sunday.</p>

      <p>And he is just the latest coach to have a mini VAR meltdown after his side's 1-0 loss at Gosford in which Western looked to have a perfectly good penalty shout ruled out.</p>

      <p>But Rudan and his players have to put any feelings of injustice and ill fortune behind them, if they are to see off the challenge of Sydney FC as last season's champions ready for their first visit to GMBHA Stadium.</p>
      <p>Western's flying start to the season - they won on the road in Wellington and came back from two goals down against Melbourne Victory to win 3-2 in round three - has given them some breathing space.</p>
      <p>But two or three bad results can see a team sliding down the table quickly. Two defeats on the spin simply cannot be allowed to turn into three consecutive losses when Steve Corica and his side travel south to regional Victoria.</p>
      <p>Western lies fifth on the ladder with 10 points from its seven games and a quarter of the season gone.</p>
      <p>But every other team in the league has played at least one game less (Newcastle two) bar the two other Victorian sides, so to some extent its proximity to the leaders (it is only two points behind third-placed Adelaide) could be flattering.</p>
      <p>Western's last two games have been frustrating for all involved with the club.</p>
      <p>As Rudan points out, they "annihilated" Newcastle in the second half in their home game last week but still lost. And they dominated the Mariners last weekend without being able to find a way to score.</p>
      <p>For all the delight Alessandro Diamanti brings - and his joyful, fun filled contribution to every game he plays has so far has been one of the highlights of the season - the Italian international would dearly love to find the target more often than the once he has so far managed. So would Berisha, who has netted twice.</p>

      <p>Rudan scoffed when asked at his post-match press conference whether there was a problem with Berisha given his reaction when he was taken off.</p>
      <p>The coach got on the front foot straight away, declaring: "I know Besart and I know my players inside out ... it's about managing them. I don't expect them to be smiling when they come off.</p>
      <p>"Besart is a unique beast ... [there are] no issues there at all. He wasn't at his best ... he has had 12 months out of football ... he will keep building ... it's no issue," he said.</p>
      <p>Rudan certainly needs him to.</p>
