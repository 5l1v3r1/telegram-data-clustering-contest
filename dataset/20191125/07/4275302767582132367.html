      <h1>Firefighters in Fife to give life-saving tips to home-schooled pupils</h1>
      <h2>Firefighters in Fife have launched a new drive to share potentially life-saving guidance with home-schooled pupils across the region.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T07:58:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 07:58</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thecourier.co.uk/author/craigsmith/" target="_blank">Craig Smith</a></address>
      <p>Community crews regularly carry out a range of educational visits to schools throughout Scotland.</p>
      <p>But with not all children attending mainstream schools, firefighters in the kingdom are making extra efforts to ensure they reach families from every background.</p>
      <p>As part of this commitment, staff at Glenrothes Fire Station recently welcomed a group of home-schooled pupils.</p>
      <p>The primary school aged children, whose families have chosen to educate then at home, were given vital safety advice, enjoyed a tour of the station, and even took part in target practice with a hose.</p>
      <p>Crew Commander Gary Stewart, who helped organise the visit, said it was crucial to ensure every child had an education in fire safety.</p>
      <p>“It’s vitally important for us to share potentially life-saving advice and guidance with all members of our communities,” he said.</p>
      <p>“The children we welcomed are aged between four and 11 and represent a very diverse group, from a range of backgrounds.</p>
      <p>“For us, this was a group of people who were potentially missing out on important advice.”</p>
      <p>He said the activities had already had spin-offs, which would hopefully mean the children’s families were in a safer position.</p>
      <p>“On the back of the visits, we’ve been able to carry out several home fire safety visits and install smoke detectors,” he said. “It’s been a real success and has been well received by everyone involved.”</p>
      <p>Mr Stewart added: “The children really enjoyed the visits and the parents were given some very important guidance.</p>
      <p>“We need to ensure we reach everyone, in every community, right across Scotland. It’s vital to us that people know we are here to help and that we will be there when they reach out for help or assistance.”</p>
