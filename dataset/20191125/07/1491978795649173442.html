First described in 1835, it has a yellow stomach and orange moutharms. Its Latin name refers to the Kamchatka peninsula in Russia, where it was first found.</p>

      <p>An adult male <i>Copula sivickisi</i>. Its name refers to the courtship behaviour in which males and females entangle their tentacles and swim as a couple. The male then delivers a capsule of sperm which is swallowed by the female. Sometimes many males tangle with a single female at once.</p>
