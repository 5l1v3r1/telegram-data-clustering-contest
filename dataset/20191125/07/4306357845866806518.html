      <h2>Spurs legend Gary Lineker suggests Mauricio Pochettino could be in charge at Arsenal soon</h2>

      <h3>Gary Lineker has joked that Mauricio Pochettino could be in charge at Arsenal by Monday.</h3>
      <p>The Argentine head coach was sacked by Tottenham Hotspur last week after five seasons in charge of the north London side.</p>
      <p>Pochettino was axed by the north London side despite leading Tottenham to four consecutive top-four finishes for the first time in the club’s Premier League history.</p>
      <p>The 47-year-old lead Spurs to the Champions League final last term before Tottenham lost 2-0 to Liverpool FC in Madrid back in June.</p>
      <p>Arsenal’s current manager Unai Emery is coming under pressure following the Gunners’ disappointing start to the Premier League season.</p>
      <p>The Emirates outfit drew 2-2 with Premier League strugglers Southampton on Saturday afternoon after Alexandre Lacazette’s late equaliser.</p>
      <p>Former Spurs forward Lineker suggested that Pochettinho could be swiftly re-employed given the poor form of Arsenal, as well as Everton and West Ham.</p>
      <p>Lineker wrote on <a href="https://twitter.com/GaryLineker/status/1198284416600203264?s=20">Twitter</a>: “Pochettino could be managing West Ham, Everton and Arsenal by Monday.”</p>
      <p>Arsenal are in seventh place in the Premier League table and eight points adrift of the top four.</p>
      <p>The Gunners will make the trip to face Norwich City at Carrow Road in their next Premier League fixture next weekend.</p>
      <p>Arsenal appointed Emery as Arsene Wenger’s replacement back in May 2018.</p>
      <p>Emery led the Gunners to the Europa League final last term before Arsenal lost 4-1 to Chelsea FC.</p>
