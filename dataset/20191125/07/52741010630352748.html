      <p>PARIS — French luxury giant LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton said Monday it has reached a deal to buy U.S.-based jewelry legend Tiffany &amp; Co for $16.2 billion.</p>
      <p>LVMH said in a statement that the deal values the 180-year old Tiffany and its 300 boutiques worldwide at $135 a share. The agreed deal is higher than the $14.5 billion cash offer LVMH made last month.</p>
      <p>The conglomerate said both companies' boards approved the deal and hope to finalize the takeover in 2020 subject to the approval of regulators and Tiffany shareholders.</p>
      <p>LVMH says the deal will strengthen its position in high-end jewelry and in the US market.</p>
      <p>LVMH already owns 75 brands including Christian Dior, Fendi, and Givenchy as well as watchmaker Tag Heuer. The purchase would also give LVMH a much broader foothold in the United States and broaden its offerings in jewelry.</p>
      <p>Tiffany says the deal will ensure the company's long-term sustainability. Tiffany, which is trying to transform its brand to appeal to younger shoppers, could use a company with deep pockets to help expand its business.</p>
      <p>The offer comes as luxury goods companies have been wrestling with changing habits of shoppers who are increasingly buying online. They're also purchasing second-hand luxury items from places like The RealReal.com.</p>
      <p>In addition, luxury companies are facing fears of an economic slowdown in China, a key area of business, while they're already dealing with a slowdown in international tourism in the U.S.</p>
      <p>Under its CEO Alessandro Bogliolo, Tiffany is trying to appeal to younger shoppers with more modern takes on jewelry. Earlier this year, it launched a men's jewelry collection, and it's increasing its marketing to a more diverse customer base like same-sex couples. It's also been renovating its flagship store in Manhattan.</p>
      <p>Still, Tiffany's U.S. sales have been stagnating as China's slowing economy has weighed on spending by Chinese tourists, who make up a substantial portion of luxury spending. The strong dollar has also made Tiffany products more expensive for consumers outside the U.S.</p>
