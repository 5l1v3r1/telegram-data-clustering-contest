      <p>The last few days have seen media attention shifting to the Ambani ladies as Mukesh and Nita Ambani hosted pre-wedding functions of their nephew Arjun Kothari at Antilia. As expected, the topic of intense discussion on social media was the outfits chosen by Shloka Mehta, Isha Ambani and Radhika Merchant for the various occasions related to Arjun’s wedding. While Nita Ambani’s daughter-in-law Shloka Mehta rocked in her red-hot avatar at the Ambani residence, daughter Isha and to-be <i>bahu </i>Radhika Merchant were no less stunning in their designer outfits. Even though the wedding is now over, fresh photos of Isha’s have gone viral soon after designer-duo Abu Jani and Sandeep Khosla shared her regal look with ‘Romance of Blossoms!’ caption.</p>

      <p>While sharing Isha’s photos, Abu Jani and Sandeep Khosla wrote, “Isha Ambani Piramal is absolute grace in custom Abu Jani Sandeep Khosla. Her powder pink Floral <i>ghagra</i> is exquisitely hand-embroidered in intricate floral bursts formed with crystals, silk threads and sequins. Paired with a short jacket blouse with floral corsages and finished with a light as air, organza Stole to create deliciously delicate romance.”</p>

      <p>In another photo, Isha looked <a href="http://www.jantakareporter.com/entertainment/nita-ambanis-daughter-in-law-shloka-mehta-gets-playful-as-mukesh-ambanis-nephew-dances-to-sara-ali-khans-simmba-track/273460/">utterly radiant</a> in her 3D floral embellished couture <i>lehenga. </i>Her custom made ivory <i>lehenga choli </i>with her <i>lehenga</i> being embossed with several floral designs was no less a stunner. The highlight of her look was that she wore absolutely no jewellery except for earrings and a statement ring on her left hand. Needless to say, Isha looked absolutely stunning.</p>

      <p>Arjun Kothari is the son of Mukesh Ambani’s sister Nina Kothari. He got married last week.</p>
