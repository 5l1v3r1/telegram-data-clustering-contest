      <p>If you plan on purchasing something from Apple before December 2, Apple will donate some money to (RED) if you use <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a>.</p>
      <p>Apple made the announcement on its official <a href="https://www.apple.com/product-red/">(PRODUCT)RED</a> micro site today, revealing that for any purchase made with Apple Pay at a physical <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/apple-store/">Apple Store</a>, through the Apple Store app, or through Apple’s Online Store, the company will donate $1 to (RED). Apple says it will donate up to $1 million through the initiative.</p>
      <blockquote>To support (RED)’s fight against AIDS, Apple will donate $1 to the Global Fund for every Apple Pay purchase made at an Apple Store, on apple.com, or in the Apple Store app — now through December 2. You can also donate directly using Apple Pay at red.org.</blockquote>
      <p>The Global Fund to fight AIDS has been around for years, and Apple has been partnered with the (PRODUCT)RED effort for quite some time. The company has a variety of products that offer support for the program, including leather cases for its iPhone lineup, Beats-branded headphones and speakers, Apple Watch bands, the iPod touch, and of course the iPhone 11 comes in a (PRODUCT)RED color variant.</p>
      <p>The company says that, since 2006, Apple has raised upwards of $220 million for (RED). The site also makes it clear that 100 percent of proceeds generated from RED partners funds HIV/AIDS programs across Africa. The Global Fund not only fights HIV/AIDS, but also malaria and tuberculosis.</p>
      <p>If you plan on making a purchase through Apple in the near future, think you’ll be using Apple Pay to do it?</p>
