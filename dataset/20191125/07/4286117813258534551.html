      <h4>HIGHLIGHTS</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Is BJP hoping NCP MLAs to stay away from floor test?</li>
        <li>BJP says it has the number to prove majority while officially NCP is in Opposition</li>
        <li>Supreme Court to decide on petition seeking early floor test on Tuesday</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Let's begin with a question. How many of you remember Franklin D Roosevelt from school textbooks? For those who don't, he was the US president at the time of World War II and a keen observer of politics - national and international. And he said this: "In politics, nothing happens by accident. If it happens, you can bet it was planned that way."</p>
      <p>Consider Roosevelt's statement as a touchstone to understand Maharashtra politics of the day.</p>
      <p>Maharashtra politics has been unpredictable in the past five weeks. Political pundits have miserably failed to see what was in the offing. Many of them, however, were quite on the money in predicting a BJP-Shiv Sena win in the election.</p>
      <p>Post-election, it has been a different ball game altogether. But the script turned illegible once the results were announced. And, in what appeared as a political accident, Devendra Fadnavis of the BJP and Ajit Pawar of the NCP took oath early Saturday morning.</p>
      <p>The BJP claims to have enough number to prove that the Fadnavis government enjoys majority in Maharashtra Assembly, which is yet to be constituted. The Opposition camp of the three-party alliance has claimed that they have the numbers and not the Devendra Fadnavis-Ajit Pawar government.</p>
      <p>The three-party alliance has demanded a floor test for the Fadnavis-Pawar government both in the Supreme Court through their petition and in their letter to Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari.</p>
      <p>
        <b>FLOOR TEST IS CERTAIN BUT HOW?</b>
      </p>
      <p>In the landmark judgment in SR Bommai, the Supreme Court had laid a principle that the trust vote on the floor of the house is the ultimate test to know if a government enjoys majority or not.</p>
      <p>As the Fadnavis-Pawar government has already been formed, it cannot be dismissed without a floor test. The government requires support of 145 MLAs in the 288-member Maharashtra Assembly.</p>
      <p>The BJP won 105 seats in the Maharashtra Assembly election that it contested with the Shiv Sena, which got 56 seats; the NCP won 54 seats and the Congress 44. There are 29 MLAs who won as either Independents or as candidates of smaller parties.</p>
      <p>Now, it has come to a pass. Going by the official positions taken by all the four parties, the three-party alliance should easily defeat the Fadnavis-Pawar government in the floor test. However, there are many ifs and buts in the story, what looked a plain tale on the day of election results.</p>
      <p>
        <b>BOYCOTT OF FLOOR TEST</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ajit Pawar has clearly defected if the official line of the NCP is the benchmark. Ajit Pawar is the man managing the NCP practically for past five-seven years. He played a key role in selection of the NCP candidates and is said to have been the main fundraiser for around 30 of the winning nominees of the party.</p>
      <p>When Ajit Pawar gave the support letter of his party MLAs to Governor Koshiyari, he was the leader of the NCP legislature party before Fadnavis and he were administered oath.</p>
      <p>He has been replaced as the NCP legislature party leader since with Jayant Patil who incidentally submitted a similar letter to Koshiyari claiming support of the same MLAs to the three-party alliance. A total support claimed was of 162 MLAs.</p>
      <p>Ajit Pawar has, interestingly, not been either suspended or expelled from the NCP. So, he continues to hold a say officially in the NCP.</p>
      <p>The NCP is likely to split during the floor test. There is another speculation that instead of split, the NCP MLAs - at least a sizeable number of them - may boycott or stay away from the floor test.</p>
      <p>If the NCP actually boycotts. It won't be an accident. Q.E.D. Roosevelt theory.</p>
      <p>
        <b>CASE OF MINORITY GOVERNMENT</b>
      </p>
      <p>If the NCP or a sizeable number of its MLAs boycotts the floor test, the effective strength of Maharashtra Assembly may come to as low as 288-54 = 234. This brings the half-way mark to 118 with one MLA becoming the Speaker of Maharashtra Assembly.</p>
      <p>The BJP claims to have support of 15-20 other MLAs. They have the letter of support from 11 already. This brings the Fadnavis-Pawar government in a position to win majority despite technically being a minority government.</p>
      <p>An interesting coincidence comes from the 1991 trust vote of the PV Narasimha Rao government of the Congress. It was in minority but never fell in a floor test for five years. BJP leader Subramanian Swamy referred to PVNR government case in his tweet Sunday evening.</p>
      <p>There is more to it.</p>
      <p>
        <b>FRINGE IN FOCUS</b>
      </p>
      <p>The BJP is said to be reaching out to most of the 29 MLAs - Independent and smaller parties - except the four members of the AIMIM and the Samajwadi Party.</p>
      <p>In addition, party hopping was the order of the day in the run up to the Maharashtra Assembly. The BJP received some and lost some. The party has reached out to those who left the party and won the election on some other party's ticket.</p>
      <p>Such MLAs are reportedly being promised the BJP ticket when bypoll happens next and that they were denied tickets as the Shiv Sena was wrongly given a generous deal in the election.</p>
      <p>Further, those who crossed over to the BJP from other parties have been roped in to get in touch with the MLAs of their former parties and seek their support during the floor test.</p>
      <p>This opens the ground for mass-scale defection or en mass resignation the way it happened in Karnataka. The MLAs were held disqualified later in Karnataka but back then the Speaker was a JDS member while the BJP had managed the number.</p>
      <p>
        <b>PROCESS TO FOLLOW</b>
      </p>
      <p>In Maharashtra, the Speaker is yet to be elected. This can happen only after the MLAs have been administered oath. The oath to MLAs can only be administered by a pro-tem Speaker. This can happen only when a session of Maharashtra Assembly is convened.</p>
      <p>Only a Speaker can conduct a floor test, as constitutional provisions.</p>
      <p>The ball is in the Supreme Court, where former Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for the governor asserted that the judiciary cannot overrule the constitutional process for holding a floor test. The Supreme Court will give its ruling on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The BJP is confident that with or without boycott by the NCP MLAs or a sizeable number of them, or defection or resignation by the required number of MLAs, it will be able to garner support for Devendra Fadnavis-Ajit Pawar government.</p>
      <p><b>Before we end, an important recap:</b> Devendra Fadnavis had formed a minority government in 2014 and won his floor test by voice vote while there were shouts and chaos in Maharashtra Assembly.</p>
