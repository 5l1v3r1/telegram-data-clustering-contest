      <p>Paul Foreman (Peter Ash) is about to take the extraordinarily brave step of exposing the truth about sexual abuser Kel (Joseph Alessi) in Coronation Street after the depraved criminal is arrested. Kel finds himself caught out over the burglaries but with Kel having spoken out to his family about what happened to him as a child, Bernie Winter (Jane Hazlegrove) takes it upon herself to inform the police of Kel’s much more serious crimes.</p>
      <p>At first, Paul is unhappy with his mum for taking this decision out of his hands but he soon decides that he wants and deserves justice. The police present Kel with the photographs recovered during the search of his flat and he is seething with Bernie for reporting him.</p>
      <p>In anger, he later takes her prisoner in her own home but as she fears for her safety, Paul arrives with sister Gemma (Dolly Rose Campbell) and saves the day. The situation gives Paul food for thought and he knows that Kel belongs behind bars.</p>

Paul is nervous as he heads for the meeting but he soon finds himself opening up about his ordeal and finds a weight being lifted from him.</p>
      <p>As he speaks more about what happened, he stops seeing himself as a helpless victim and the one at fault and realise the responsibility for the horrific crimes is Kel’s alone. Determined to get justice and see Kel pay for what he has done, Paul feels ready to take on the battle and give the statement.</p>
