      <p>Taiwan's National Cheng Kung University (NCKU) has recently deployed five new Nvidia DGX-1 deep-learning supercomputers, looking to improve its R&amp;D in AI technologies. Prior to the installment, NCKU already acquired a DGX-1 in 2017.</p>
      <p>The supercomputers will be used primarily for smart medical care, financial technologies and nature disaster studies, initially. For medical care, the computing power is able to shrink the time needed for labeling 38,000 medical images to only one hour from up to one month by manpower.</p>
      <p>Eunice Chiu, Nvidia VP of sales and country general manager ofTaiwan, pointed out that the DGX-1 is a supercomputer built specifically for AI and deep learning and is equipped with eight Tesla V100 GPUs able to boost computing performance by 96 times compared to CPU-powered systems.</p>
      <p>The university, which is in southern Taiwan, is also looking to apply the computing capability to industries such as semiconductor, aerospace components and traditional industries to help them improve yield rates via AI.</p>
