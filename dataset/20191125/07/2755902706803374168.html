          <i>White ZRP traffic officer breaks Zim Twitter</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Zwitter (Zim Twitter) got busy and talking after the photo of a white ZRP traffic officer went viral on the social media platform.</p>
      <p>Lately it has been a rare feat to see white Zimbabweans in the uniform so naturally it prompted a huge dialogue which lasted the whole weekend.</p>

      <aside>So i saw a white cop near belgravia shops paitika accident…i didnt even know kuti there were white policemen in Zim …other side of samora is really living a different life huh</aside>
      <p>This was followed by a slew of comments expressing different opinions.</p>
      <aside>“Varimo muno and its not like they really love to be ZRP but its meant to protect their own frends &amp; fam . If u wana see it being genuine one, mapurisa anochinjwa chinjwa kuendeswa kana Lupane or mhondoro Highfiridzi ,i bet they ain’t gon b relocated yhey remain uptown.” said one comment<br/>“We have neighbourhood guys who are doing great jobs to curb crimes within their suburbs and they are doing voluntary work …though in police Uniforms and they have too donated vehicles to easy their patrols.. Suburbs have Watch committees these days.” said another<br/>“I was almost arrested by some Chinese cop in Mt Pleasant some time back for public drinking of my own alcohol ndikaramba. I was more shocked that resistant. Imajeni kuiswa chain by a Chinese fellow in Zim for drinking a quart made using our very own Chivero water” chipped in another<br/>“i actual have 3 of my frends who are white and are policemen. the other one helps in the medic side..his passionate about what he does.i wish we are could do the same for our community it would make a difference” said one<br/>“hey are volunteers not real cops…u can do it too” another one added his pearls of wisdom<br/>“Many volunteers neighbour hood watch..most been doing this for years. But murungu ariko ku central anopfeka uniform” said another.</aside>
