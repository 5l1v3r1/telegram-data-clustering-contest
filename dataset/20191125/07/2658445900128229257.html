      <p><i><b>SIR:</b> </i>Remember the Francophone years with the near-fascist Dictator De Gaulle as President of France? Almost all countries surrounding Nigeria were classified as enemy territories. All the French speaking countries owed their allegiance to France and continued with the colonial mentality which had been their lot for decades. These countries could not and did not stand on their legs. The Gold Coast (Ghana), English-speaking also joined the French-speaking in their hate for big brother Nigeria.</p>
      <p>The situation came to a head during the devastating Civil War of 1967-70. For our neighbors, it was time to hit hard at us. Hard they did. They all became Biafra defenders, harboring Nigerian dissidents and making their territories landing ports against Nigeria. Nigeria kept mute, focusing on the struggle for national survival.</p>
      <p>After the civil war, Nigeria consolidated its hold on the region forming and consolidating its influence especially in the West African sub-region. Our country’s mere size, its economic relevance and strategic location made it imperative for many of our neighbors to beat a quick turn-around, seeking some accommodation if not cooperation in the sub-region. As ever, Nigeria assumed a sympathetic stance, mellowing down on regional, especially economic matters, making concessions to erstwhile recalcitrant neighbors. This led to the setting up and maintaining political, economic and legal institutions to cater for West Africa. This move also strengthened Nigeria’s position on the continent, where Nigeria is now accepted as the largest economy.</p>
      <p>But all these gains and positive development have their price. Nigeria’s neighbors –almost all round our geographical entity, have taken advantage of our liberal big brother position to frustrate and assault our domestic economy. All manner of goods – ranging from automobiles to foods are being smuggled across numerous routes to our territory, making our economy subject to adulteration if not total vandalisation. What is alarming now is that the goods being smuggled through these borders are not only sub-standard, but they are not even produced or manufactured in the importing countries. These countries are just routes or media whereby illegal goods and services are transacted to Nigeria. Our neighbors have no tangible assets or facilities to produce any of the goods sent to Nigeria; they are mere agents to destroy our economy.</p>
      <p>Now for how long shall we remain Father Christmas or sympathetic big brother? Our population of around 200 million as being speculated –is more than all these countries put together. Up to 60-70% of the population is unemployed. Our agricultural landscape is big and rich enough to accommodate and engage the vast unemployed but we all know our youth prefer the easy way of making their life. Our country is thus faced with a docile, unproductive population and aggressive evil minded economic aggressors who for good measure find their collaborators within our territory.</p>
      <p>Today, fuel movement and border location top the agenda of the economic saboteurs. One may ask, why should Nigeria make concessions in locating fuel depots and stations near our borders and locate where these will further compound our problems? Nigeria’s problems are now compounded by the activities of terrorists without borders. They come in and out at will sometimes collaboration with disloyal and dishonest indigenes of border states. This is even worse than economic sabotage. Any reasonable country will move fast and ensure the borders are safe and saboteurs and invaders are put in check.</p>
      <p>Any further or future arrangement to open our borders must consider first and foremost the interest of our country especially in the vital areas of corporate existence, safety and economic well-being. Campaigns to allow free movements in and out of Nigeria at will, will remain hollow except-these vital issues are resolved, and quickly too.</p>
