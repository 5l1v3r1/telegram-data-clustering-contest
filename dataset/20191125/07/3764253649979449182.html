      <p>The Nation reports that earlier in November the businessman gave out the sum to the Save The Children organisation in its aim to intervene in the northeast.</p>
      <p>It should be noted that the charity outfit is a 100-year-old United Kingdom organisation and is the biggest organisation ranked after UNICEF.</p>

      <p>In his comment on why he made the donation through his daughter, Otedola said: "<i>A lot of people think when they die, they take their money with them, we’ll see. In my journey of life, I have taken the risk, I’ve done the chase, I’ve enjoyed the thrill and I have achieved success and recognition. What next? You give it back."</i></p>
