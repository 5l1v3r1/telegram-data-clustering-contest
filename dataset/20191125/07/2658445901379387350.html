      <p>The Pacific Lagos will be bigger, better and offer more value. In place of the former design, there are two distinct luxury towers – one with 10 suspended floors of premium office space for commercial use and 12 floors of exclusive hotel apartments for residential purposes”.</p>
      <p>The remodelling, which is ongoing, will be completed on schedule, given the resources already committed and the progress in preliminary engineering, procurement and construction works on the project.</p>
      <p>Its owners, Global Property Partners (GPP), a subsidiary of Cavalli Business &amp; Investment Group, said: “ We have assembled a team of experienced, world-class professionals to ensure the Pacific Lagos met the standards envisaged by our clientele in terms of quality, expertise and the cutting-edge facilities we have outlined for Pacific Lagos,” said GPP Chief Executive Officer Emmanuel Odemayowa.</p>
      <p>He added: “The modifications are made in line with the company’s vision of developing a best-in-class mixed-use development and the specifications of some subscribers to the iconic Twin Towers. He further acknowledged that the market reception to the project has been enthusiastic.</p>

      <p>Among the already remodelled facilities are the recreational floor which has been expanded and moved to the third floor to enhance the “Work.Live.Play” Concept of Pacific Lagos.</p>
      <p>“Also, the 10-office floor are designed for optimal efficiency, functionality and convenience,” said Odemayowa, adding that the 12 floors of residential space comprise one and two-bedroom ensuite hotel apartments modelled on five-star hospitality accommodations.</p>
      <p>Located on Victoria Island, the project is in line with the Cavalli Group’s vision of reducing the severe housing deficit in the country through the development of real estate modelled on international standards.</p>
      <p>Odemayowa said the group had completed various real estate projects across Lagos.</p>
      <p>The group said it had designed a number of innovative packages for investment in Pacific Lagos, among which is the Pacific Mutual Investment Plan, a product that offers flexible investment options for from as low as N5 million.</p>
