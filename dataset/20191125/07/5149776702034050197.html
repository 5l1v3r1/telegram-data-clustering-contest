      <h1>Police to carry out underwater search at River Trent for missing Newark man</h1>
      <h2>He was reported missing on November 18</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T07:42:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 07:42</time> by <a rel="author">Phoebe Ram</a></address>
      <p>An underwater search of the River Trent is due to start as part of an investigation to find a missing man not seen for more than two weeks.</p>
      <p>Police say they are "growing increasingly concerned" for the welfare of 27-year old Michal Krysztofcyzk after he was reported missing from Cross Street, <a href="http://www.notttinghampost.com/all-about/newark">Newark</a>, on Monday, November 18.</p>
      <p>It is not known exactly when he was last seen but it is likely to have been around Saturday, November 9.</p>
      <p>Specialist underwater teams are due to start searches of the <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/river-trent">River Trent</a> between North Muskham and the Newark A46 flyover on Monday 25 and Tuesday, November 26.</p>
      <p>This will depend on the strength of the current and the weather conditions.</p>
      <p>Officers will be supported by volunteers from the Nottinghamshire Search and Rescue Team (NSART) who will be combing nearby river banks while the underwater searches are taking place.</p>

      <p>Sergeant Ian Birkin from <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottinghamshire-police">Nottinghamshire Police</a>’s Missing from Home team, said: “Our officers have real concerns for Michal, who we have had very few sightings of since he was reported missing to us.</p>
      <p>“The searches of the river are being carried out as a precaution and we have been in close contact with Michal’s family to support them and ensure they are aware of our activity during what must be a heart-breaking time for them.</p>
      <p>“I would urge anyone with any information about Michal – no matter how insignificant they think it may seem – to contact Nottinghamshire Police as soon as possible.”</p>
      <p>Michal is described as white, slim and bald. Michal is a Polish national who has previously suffered burns which has left him with distinctive scarring to his face, ears, and hands.</p>
      <p>It is not known what Michal was wearing when he was last seen.</p>
      <p>Anyone who has seen Michal since Monday, November 9 is asked to call Nottinghamshire Police as soon as possible on 101, quoting incident number 350 of 18 November.</p>
