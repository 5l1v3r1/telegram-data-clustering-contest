      <h3>What the papers say</h3>
      <p>Striker <b>Rhian Brewster</b> could be leaving Liverpool on loan in January, the Daily Star reports. The 19-year-old has only played three hours of first-team football, during the Carabao Cup, this season and Reds manager Jurgen Klopp is happy to let him leave for a spell. Leeds, Crystal Palace, Swansea and Aston Villa are all possible destinations.</p>
      <p>Bournemouth’s loss could be Liverpool or Arsenal’s gain when it comes to <b>Ryan Fraser</b>, the Daily Mirror reports. The 25-year-old winger’s contract with the Cherries is up at the end of the season and he has been linked with bigger clubs.</p>
