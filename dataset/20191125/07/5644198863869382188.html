      <p>Feliciano Lopez praised an "amazing" Rafael Nadal after the world number one sealed Spain's sixth Davis Cup title on Sunday with another superhuman display at La Caja Magica.</p>
      <p>MADRID: Feliciano Lopez praised an "amazing" Rafael Nadal after the world number one sealed Spain's sixth Davis Cup title on Sunday with another superhuman display at La Caja Magica.</p>
      <p>Spain captain Sergi Brugera was forced to juggle his squad throughout an intense and gruelling week at the inaugural edition of the revamped team competition.</p>

      <p>The 38-year-old Lopez, Roberto Bautista Agut, Marcel Granollers and Pablo Carreno Busta all got court time but world number one Nadal was the rock.</p>
      <p>He won all eight of the matches he played without dropping his serve. His 6-3 7-6(7) win over Canada's Denis Shapovalov clinched a 2-0 victory in the final and took his run of singles wins in the competition to an incredible 29 dating back to 2004.</p>
      <p>His match against Shapovalov was his seventh match in four days and the past three nights he had played well past midnight, including a nerve-jangling doubles decider with Lopez against Britain in Saturday's semi-finals.</p>
      <p>"I think especially Rafa playing singles and doubles almost every day, he's been our MVP this week," Lopez said.</p>
      <p>"Of course, I want to give credit to all of us, but he's been amazing what he has done.</p>
      <p>"There's things that only people like Rafa can do and if you ask my opinion I think he's a superhero."</p>
      <p>With Spain's King Felipe amongst the 25,000 crowd on Sunday, Nadal showed again the fight that has taken him to 19 Grand Slam titles, fighting off a Shapovalov onslaught in the second set to claim Spain's sixth Davis Cup title.</p>
      <p>The Mallorcan was also in the winning teams in 2009 and 2011 but this one marked a new chapter in the historic competition as it was the first to be played in the new format with 18 teams battling out over an intense and gruelling seven days.</p>
      <p>"It's been amazing, the whole week of course. When you finally win the title after all the things that we went through I think this week," Nadal told reporters.</p>
      <p>"And playing at home is something difficult to describe. It's been an unforgettable week for all of us, without a doubt,"</p>
      <p>Team mate Roberto Bautista Agut had got the ball rolling with a win over Felix Auger-Aliassime, after returning to the squad on Saturday following the death of his father.</p>
      <p>There were emotional scenes after his win and when the title was in the bag and Bautista Agut thanked his team mates.</p>
      <p>"I had the opportunity to play today because all the team and all the players ... did an unbelievable effort since the first day," he said.</p>
      <p>"It was an amazing feeling on the court today."</p>
      <p>Lopez said the condensed new format, breaking away from the year-long World Group that culminated in a November final had been exciting to be involved in and the three-rubber ties and best-of-three set matches made it more unpredictable.</p>
      <p>"It's a very different situation to be playing," he said. "I think this format makes everything very even.</p>
      <p>"But it's very exciting for the crowd but for us it's more demanding probably. We were going to bed very late every day."</p>
