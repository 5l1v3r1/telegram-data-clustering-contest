      <h1>Hearts are 'clueless' and Ann Budge is making it up as she goes along says former Hibs star</h1>
      <h2>Pressure is building on the Hearts chairman after a 3-0 defeat to Kilmarnock at the weekend.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T07:49:12+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 07:49</time> by <a rel="author">Jonathan McFarlane</a></address>
      <p>Kris Commons has slammed Hearts' recruitment process as they attempt to replace <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/craig-levein">Craig Levein</a> .</p>
      <p>Chairman Ann Budge moved to dismiss the manager after a long period of poor results on Halloween. Nearly a month later, it appears little tangible progress has been made, despite a number of interviews having taken place.</p>
      <p>Hearts, under the leadership of interim boss Austin MacPhee, were easily beaten 3-0 against <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/craig-levein">Kilmarnock</a> at the weekend after a catastrophic opening period that saw the Jambos three down in the first 16 minutes.</p>
      <p>Commons, who had a short spell on loan at Edinburgh rivals <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hibernian-fc">Hibs</a> , feels that the Gorgie club should look to North London to see how managerial appointments should be done.</p>

      <p>Speaking in the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/index.html">Daily Mail</a> , he said: "Look at Spurs. Some of their fans would have gone to work and started a night-shift last week with Mauricio Pochettino in charge of their club. Then, by the time they got home the next morning, he'd been punted and replaced by Jose Mourinho.</p>
      <p>"That's how clubs operate when they have a clear and definite plan of action...they act swiftly and make a change.</p>
      <p>"Hearts, though, are a million miles from that. They're clueless and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/ann-budge">Ann Budge</a> is basically making it up as she goes along. She's dragging her heels over appointing a new manager and a sporting director.</p>
      <p>"Meanwhile, they are being hammered 3-0 at Kilmarnock. That's patently not good enough."</p>
