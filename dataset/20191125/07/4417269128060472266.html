      <h1>Watch out for scammers when shopping online this festive season</h1>
      <h2>Shoppers should be wary of offers which are too good to be true and are advised to buy from well known reputable stores or sellers.</h2>

      <p>SHOPPING online is convenient especially for the festive season as it also means you can avoid the crowds.</p>
      <p>ESET South Africa CEO, Carey van Vlaanderen said unfortunately, the holiday season is also a great time for online scammers.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Watch out for</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Offers too good to be true</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you see deals that are too good to be true it’s because they probably are.  This is an easy way for scammers to get you to divulge your private and/or financial information by selling non-existent goods.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>
        <b>Protect yourself</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Buy from well-known, reputable stores or sellers</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Some scammers set up highly elaborate and genuine looking websites.</p>
      <p>Don’t be fooled and do your due diligence.</p>
      <p>Read the online views; ask around in forums; and if you’re buying high priced items check the seller’s credentials in their country of origin.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Pay securely</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Check to see the site is secured – look for web addresses starting with https.</p>
      <p>This ensures your payment information being sent in the transaction is encrypted and can’t be intercepted and stolen.</p>
