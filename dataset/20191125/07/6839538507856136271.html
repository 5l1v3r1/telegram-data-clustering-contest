      <p>Police have established a strike force as they continue investigating the disappearance of NSW woman Ruth Ridley who they fear may have been killed in a "domestic violence incident".</p>
      <p>Ms Ridley, 58, drove from her home in Port Macquarie to Tumbarumba in NSW on October 18 in a dark blue Mitsubishi Pajero towing a caravan, NSW Police say.</p>
      <p>Detectives believe she then travelled to the Neils Bend Murray River Reserve or Walwa in Victoria on October 26 with her estranged husband Gary Ridley.</p>
      <p>The Pajero was found in Shelley a few days later with Mr Ridley's body inside.</p>
      <p>Ms Ridley was reported missing on October 30.</p>
      <p>"Police hold grave fears for her safety and suspect she may be the victim of a domestic violence incident that has resulted in her death," NSW Police said in a statement on Monday when announcing the establishment of Strikeforce Alysse.</p>
      <p>Detectives want to speak with anyone who may have been at Neils Bend reserve or Walwa on the Murray River between October 26 and 28.</p>
      <p>"Police would like to hear from anyone who may have seen Ruth or Gary Ridley camped in the area during that period."</p>
      <p>After Ms Ridley was reported missing Steven Ridley wrote on Facebook: "Thank you for your prayers. We all are holding out hope for mum to be found one way or another for some sort of closure."</p>
