        <b>Paul Foreman (Peter Ash) has had an incredibly difficult couple of months in Coronation Street, as — after <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/billy-mayhew/">Billy Mayhew</a> (<a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/daniel-brocklebank/">Daniel Brocklebank</a>) questioned him about his past — he came to the horrifying realisation that Kel (Joe Alessi) had sexually abused him when he was a teenager. With him having revealed the truth about what happened to him to both Gemma and Bernie Winter (<a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/dolly-rose-campbell/">Dolly-Rose Campbell</a> and Jane Hazelgrove), he begins to open up about his abuse to others.</b>
      </p>
      <p>With the festive season approaching, Sean (Antony Cotton) is excited about the prospect of decorating the flat.</p>
      <p>However, Billy has decided against Christmas decorations this year, as he’s come to understand that they trigger bad memories for Paul from when he was a teenager.</p>

      <p>Sean’s none too pleased at the lack of decorations, and he makes his opinion on the matter known.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Paul is incredibly nervous about speaking to the police in regards to his abuse, but — after a conversation with David (Jack P Shepherd) in which he spoke about his own ordeal with Josh (Ryan Clayton) — he’s put at ease.</p>

      <p>Later, Paul returns to work and admits to the factory workers that the police want to speak to him in regards to him being sexually abused — and the factory staff are left speechless as a result.</p>
      <p>Later in the week, Paul reveals to both Billy and Sean that he’s decorated the tree — confirming that he’s ready to move forward in life.</p>
