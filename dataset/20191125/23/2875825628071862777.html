      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T23:32:20+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 23:32</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/katie-price">Katie Price</a> has shared the first look at her upcoming two-part special reality show My Crazy Life.</p>
      <p>The former glamour model, 41, posted the explosive trailer to her <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> page on Monday afternoon and sent fans wild as they anticipated Pricey's TV return.</p>
      <p>The businesswoman woman teased an insight into the new show with the clip showing her on-off toyboy beau <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/kris-boyson">Kris Boyson</a> , 31, addressing Katie's recent cheating scandal with Essex builder <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/charles-drury">Charles Drury</a> , 22.</p>
      <p>The short teaser clip also showed the mum-of-five in despair in her famously 'mucky mansion' as she blamed a 'builder' for selling her the dream.</p>

      <p>After a friend questioned Katie over the state of her house, the model sighed as she replied: "Honestly, you have no idea.</p>
      <p>"This builder offered me the dream. So, I've gone from 11 bedrooms to Harvey's annexe. I feel so stupid."</p>
      <p>The camera panned across the mucky mansion and showed crumbling rooms crammed with tonnes of rubbish and piles of clothes.</p>
      <p>Even Katie's ex <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/kieran-hayler">Kieran Hayler</a> appeared to have some sympathy for this former wife as he could be seen 'apologising' to Katie.</p>
      <p>The dad-of-two reasoned with his ex: "I'm sorry for all the stress that you're going through, because this is not nice."</p>

      <p>The second part of the clip showed an annoyed Kris Boyson seemingly addressing Katie's cheating scandal with Charles.</p>
      <p>Katie appears to beg for her on/off fianc√©'s forgiveness as she pleads: "I'm really sorry about everything."</p>
      <p>However Kris shut her down by saying, "It don't really mean anything anymore."</p>
      <p>The personal trainer then revealed: "After everything, I've been 100% honest and she's the one that's gone off and been unfaithful."</p>

      <p>Katie and Kris's relationship hit rock bottom after the model brutally dumped him over text while in Turkey to pursue a romance with her now-ex Charles.</p>
      <p>It's been a tough few months for Katie after facing bankruptcy and being slapped with another driving ban as well as all the explosive break ups and full-on make-ups.</p>
      <p>Since the end of their brief romance, builder Charles has continued to make a string of explosive statements about his and Katie's courtship.</p>

      <p>Katie's reps denied Charles' claims.</p>
      <p>Charles claimed that on the first night they met, they binged on drugs and drink before sleeping together hours later.</p>
      <p>He also believes she cheated on him during their fling, but she would never admit to it.</p>
      <p>Their relationship came to an end when Charles saw pictures of her leaving Kris' house.</p>

      <p>Katie and Kris have since rekindled once again and she is thought to be staying with him in his home in Kent while she finalises renovations on her 'mucky mansion'.</p>
      <p>The star talks about her chaotic lifestyle in the TV show trailer, saying: " Is it normal for all this to happen to one person.</p>
      <p>"I'm a survivor every time, but how much more can I keep taking?!"</p>
