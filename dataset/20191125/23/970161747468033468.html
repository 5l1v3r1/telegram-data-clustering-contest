        <b>Robert Preston (Tristan Gemmill) has fought long and hard in Coronation Street to ensure that his wedding to Michelle Connor (Kym Marsh) goes ahead, and with him having been leading a double life and cheating on Michelle with Vicki Jeffries (Kerri Quinn), he’s lucky he’s got this far. However, Vicky proves to be a thorn in his side as the week of the wedding arrives, but will he resort to murder to ensure she remains out of the picture?</b>
      </p>
      <p>In the coming episodes, pre-wedding celebrations get underway at the bistro, but Robert is left horrified when Vicki shows up and interrupts proceedings.</p>
      <p>However, he quickly manages to get rid of her, and lies to Michelle about it — claiming that he’s simply attempting to help out Tyler. As a result, Vicky scolds him, and promises to take him for every penny.</p>

      <p>With the wedding in sight, Michelle orders Robert to ban Vicky from the ceremony, so he takes a trip to visit her to do just that. However, during his visit, a neighbour of Vicky’s hears the two of them shouting — that is, until there’s a resounding noise, followed by total silence.</p>

      <p>Robert returns to the cobbles and ensures Michelle that Vicky won’t be a problem.</p>
      <p>Later in the week, the wedding arrives, and Tyler barges into the ceremony, and demands that Robert tell him what he’s done to Vicky.</p>

      <p>With people starting to believe that Robert’s murdered his ex, Michelle puts two and two together — remembering how Robert informed her that Vicky wouldn’t be a problem on their big day.</p>
      <p>Later, Robert’s questioned by the police in regards to Vicky’s vanishing.</p>
      <p>Has Robert went to extreme lengths to keep Vicky out of his life? If so, then that means he’s also killed his unborn baby.</p>
