      <h1>Juventus to rival Real Madrid for Christian Eriksen next summer?</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/juventus/"><b>Juventus</b></a> will reportedly do battle with <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/real-madrid/"><b>Real Madrid</b></a> over the transfer of <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/spurs/"><b>Tottenham Hotspur</b></a> midfielder <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/christian-eriksen/"><b>Christian Eriksen</b></a> next summer.</h2>

      <p>Eriksen's current contract expires at the end of this season, meaning that the Dane is free to speak with other clubs in January.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/spurs/transfer-talk/news/christian-eriksen-agent-set-for-real-madrid-talks_363657.html">It is claimed</a> that Los Blancos came close to completing a deal for Eriksen over the summer transfer window.</p>
      <p>According to <i>Corriere dello Sport</i>, the Serie A side will look to hijack Real's bid to sign the midfielder by launching an approach of their own.</p>
      <p>Juventus have a history of completing shrewd free transfers, as seen with <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/emre-can/"><b>Emre Can</b></a>, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/adrien-rabiot/"><b>Adrien Rabiot</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/aaron-ramsey/"><b>Aaron Ramsey</b></a> in recent times.</p>
      <p>Eriksen was not included in <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jose-mourinho/"><b>Jose Mourinho</b></a>'s first starting XI against West Ham United over the weekend.</p>
