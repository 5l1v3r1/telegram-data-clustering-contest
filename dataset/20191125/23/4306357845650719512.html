      <h2>Virgil van Dijk earns praise from Garth Crooks after Liverpool FC's 2-1 win at Crystal Palace</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T23:30:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 23:30</time> by <a rel="author">The Sport Review staff</a></address>
      <h3>Garth Crooks has praised Virgil van Dijk for the performance he produced during Liverpool FC’s 2-1 win at Crystal Palace at the weekend.</h3>
      <p>The Netherlands international has been a key part of the Liverpool FC team during the last few months and he has played an important role in helping the Reds to challenge for the Premier League title.</p>
      <p>The 28-year-old played the full 90 minutes as he helped Liverpool FC to claim an important victory at Selhurst Park at the weekend as they took another step closer towards the top-flight title.</p>
      <p>Van Dijk has started every one of Liverpool FC’s 13 Premier League games this season and he is widely regarded as one of the top defenders in world football right now.</p>
      <p>Goals from Sadio Mane and Roberto Firmino wrapped up an important win for Liverpool FC – but it was Van Dijk who earned special praise from <i>BBC Sport</i> pundit Crooks.</p>
      <p>Writing in his column for <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/50539143">BBC Sport</a>, Crooks said: “Virgil van Dijk was at it again. This time, he was strutting around Selhurst Park as if he owned the place.</p>
      <p>“Whenever Van Dijk plays, Liverpool always seem to retain a sense of calm regardless of the circumstances.</p>
      <p>“Crystal Palace played their best football for some time, created chances and missed them, and seemed to suffer from the occasion more than their visitors. Strange, that.”</p>
      <p>Liverpool FC are currently eight points clear at the top of the Premier League table after 13 games this term.</p>
      <p>They are in Champions League action on Wednesday night when they take on Napoli, before they switch their attentions to their home clash against Brighton and Hove Albion in the Premier League this weekend.</p>
