      <p><b>Pune: </b>NCP chief Sharad Pawar on Monday said that he was not behind Ajit Pawar’s decision to align with the BJP and become the deputy chief minister and asserted that his party along with Congress and Shiv Sena will form the next government in Maharashtra.</p>
      <p>Addressing reporters in Karad town of neighbouring Satara district, the NCP chief reiterated that the decision of aligning with the BJP was that of his nephew Ajit Pawar and not of the NCP. “It is not the party’s decision and we do not endorse it,” the former Union minister said.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>He also said that he has no contact with his nephew, who rebelled against the NCP.</p>
      <p>“It is wrong to say that I have a hand behind Ajit Pawar’s revolt,” he added. Asked whether the NCP, Congress and Shiv Sena will form government in the state, he said, “There is not an iota of doubt.”</p>
