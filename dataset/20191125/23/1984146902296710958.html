      <h2>Newcastle United boss Steve Bruce confesses that his side weren't up to it at Villa Park</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T23:23:51+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 23:23</time> by <a rel="author">Lee Ryder</a></address>
      <p>Steve Bruce admitted that Newcastle United “weren’t good enough” as they collapsed at Aston Villa last night.</p>
      <p>The Magpies were beaten 2-0 and now face Manchester City at St James’ Park after a weekend in which both Norwich City and Southampton trimmed the gap down at the bottom.</p>
      <p>United <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/newcastle-united-player-ratings-desperate-17315691">have a five-point cushion above the relegation zone</a> but will need to find an improvement quickly.</p>
      <p>When asked about the fans - who made their unhappiness known at the end - Bruce said: “They make it the club it is.</p>
      <p>“It is fantastic support and they were there in their thousands. We have tried hard but we weren’t good enough.</p>
      <p>“At least there was a response.</p>
      <p>“At that moment in the match it would have been a bit interesting had Allan’s shot went past Heaton.</p>
      <p>“We were too passive in the first half, we had opportunities on the counter but should have held onto the ball and should have created a bit more.</p>
      <p>“We surrendered it too quickly in the first half.</p>
      <p>“We had one or two opportunities but were not quite there.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/aston-villa-vs-newcastle-live-17302627">And reflecting on the opening 45 minutes</a> , Bruce said: “In the first half, we were nowhere near where we have been in the past few weeks.</p>
      <p>“Until the free-kick, there was nothing in the game.</p>
      <p>“We could have defended better but it changed the game.</p>
      <p>“The key was whether we could score after half-time.</p>
      <p>“The more we chased the game the more open we become.”</p>
      <p>But Bruce must go back to the drawing board now and with Man City heading to Tyneside, he said: “We are up against one of the best team in the world (Manchester City) next and we have to do better than tonight if we want to get anything out of the game.</p>
      <p>"We have to roll our sleeves up and get ready for it.”</p>
