        <b>WASHINGTON (Sputnik) - The US computer giant Apple agreed to a nearly half-billion-dollar penalty to settle charges that it contracted with a Slovenian software company ATR.SIS d.o.o. that had been sanctioned for drug trafficking, the Treasury Department said in a press release on Monday.</b>

      <blockquote>"On July 18, 2008, Apple entered into an app development agreement with SIS, a software company located at 19 Spruha, Trzin 1236, Slovenia", the release said.</blockquote>
      <p>On 24 February 2015, <a href="https://sputniknews.com/world/201911221077379515-us-treasury-dept-sanctions-iranian-information-minister-over-internet-restrictions/">Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)</a> designated SIS and Savo Stjepanovic ("Stjepanovic"), a director and majority owner of SIS, pursuant to the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act... and added them to the SDN [Specially Designated Nationals] list", the release said.</p>
      <p>Apple said it failed to identify SIS as a sanctioned company, claiming the oversight resulted from a failure by Apple's in-house sanctions screening tool, the release said.</p>
      <p>The $466,912 settlement with Apple settles the company's potential civil liability for violating the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Sanctions Regulations, the release added.</p>
      <p>SIS was sanctioned for trafficking in steroids, according to the release.</p>
