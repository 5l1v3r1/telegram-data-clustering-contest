      <p>Smokey <a href="https://www.wvlt.tv/content/news/Smokey-named--542508091.html">was named among the greatest mascots</a> in college football history this year. Plus, the Bluetick Hound was <a href="https://www.wvlt.tv/content/news/The-Bluetick-Coonhound-is-officially-Tennessees-state-dog-557893951.html">officially dubbed Tennessee's state dog this summer</a>.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.wvlt.tv/content/news/A-look-back-at-65-years-of-Smokey-498228631.html">prolific dog has been part of the Vols history for 65 years</a>. After General Neyland stepped down, the University of Tennessee started looking for a mascot and had its eyes set on a hound. So, they held a contest and let the students decide. Rev. Bill Brooks brought in his prize-winning Bluetick Coonhound.</p>
      <p>Smokey will be at the Thompson-Boling Arena on Monday night to cheer on the BasketVols as they take on Chattanooga and hope to keep their home game winning streak.</p>
