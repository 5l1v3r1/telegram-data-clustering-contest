      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T23:53:27+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 23:53</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/westlife">Westlife</a> 's Mark Feehily wants to be in the first same sex celeb pair to compete on <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/strictly-come-dancing">Strictly Come Dancing</a> .</p>
      <p>And the 39-year-old has already met with the show’s talent executive who is responsible for booking the contestants.</p>
      <p>Rather that chomping on kangaroo anus like his bandmate Kian Egan who was crowned King of the Jungle in 2014, he is keen to follow Nicky Byrne’s (dancing) footsteps on the BBC1 show.</p>
      <p>Mark explained: “We were talking about Kian in the jungle. I just couldn’t do it. I know I couldn’t. I’m particularly squeamish.</p>
      <p>“Strictly is the only one with an ability attached to it.</p>
      <p>“There is ability with the jungle with the challenges and working stuff out but not in the same way.</p>
      <p>“ <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/big-brother">Big Brother</a> you are just sitting around and I don’t think I would like that. Strictly would be fun to do as I love a freestyle dance.”</p>

      <p>Nicky, who danced with Karen Hauer added: “I could see it ‘Dancing The Cha Cha Cha, Mark Feehily and Anton du Beke’.” Mark added: “It would have to be with a guy as it would feel strange for me to go with a girl.</p>
      <p>“Well it wouldn’t feel strange but why wouldn’t I do it with a guy?”</p>
      <p>And despite being “too busy” focussing on the Westlife 2020, Mark and the rest of the band recently met with Strictly Come Dancing’ talent executive Stefania Aleksander, who is known to be a fan of the band.</p>
      <p>He added: “Steph? We met her the other day.”</p>
      <p>The band also joined Strictly judge Bruno Tonioli in hitting out at the criticism over Johannes Radebe and Graziano di Prima’s same sex routine.</p>
      <p>Kian said: “There was some negativity towards it but it’s just two guys together. Australia already do it. Two-hundred complaints? That’s just the one person complaining repeatedly.”</p>

      <h3>Becoming a parent</h3>
      <p>Mark feels the band’s relentless schedule in the early years prepared him for becoming a dad.</p>
      <p>The 39-year-old, who welcomed daughter, Layla with his fiance Cailean O’Neill earlier this year, said: “There was sleepless nights before for other reasons.</p>
      <p>“Being in Westlife has helped me 100% in terms of getting up at silly hours to do things when you would rather be sleeping.</p>
      <p>“It’s just changing to feed the baby instead of getting up at 3am to do crazy-time breakfast TV.”</p>

      <h3>I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out Of Here!</h3>
      <p>Kian, who was crowned Jungle King on I’m A Celebrity in 2014, is backing Jacqueline Jossa to win the show as long as she can keep her focus.</p>
      <p>He said: “Watching it so far, Jacqueline is definitely very strong, but she’s going to come to a breaking point and it’s going to be one way or the other for her.”</p>

      <h3>X Factor: The Band</h3>
      <p>Westlife have thrown their support behind <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/x-factor">X Factor</a> : The Band saying the secret of <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/simon-cowell">Simon Cowell</a> ’s success in managing boybands is that he makes each group member feel special.</p>
      <p>Nicky said: “He’d look at you and give you the wink. He rang me one time and said, ‘Nicky, I think the boys need a bit of styling, can you have a word with them?’</p>
      <p>“I thought I was the chosen one but then he’d ring Kian and then Shane then Mark. He was a good manager as he knew how to keep us all interested.”</p>

      <h3>Extreme celebrating</h3>
      <p>The Irish boys celebration of their number one album almost cost Kian thousands after he spilt some VERY expensive Cognac.</p>
      <p>Nicky explained: “We were in an expensive restaurant and Kian decided to turn a bottle upside down that was on a swivel thing. It was about £3k a shot of brandy.”</p>
      <p>But thankfully the restaurant didn’t charge them for the spillage, Kian, 39 added: “I didn’t think it was real.”</p>
      <p>Mark joked: “Obviously we licked it all up afterwards.”</p>

      <h3>Life on the road</h3>
      <p>Westlife were almost Flying Without Wings literally after two of the band nearly fell out the window of a moving tour bus on the motorway while they were play fighting.</p>
      <p>Nicky explained: “We were on the Smash Hits tour bus on the motorway. The lads were wrestling and the window of the bus popped out. They could have fallen out.”</p>
      <p>Mark added: “The two of you would have been dead.”</p>
      <p>The band, who are celebrating 20 years of music, can’t remember who the culprits were – blaming Shane Filan who was at home sick and Brian McFadden who left the band in 2004.</p>
      <p>Nicky added: “It wasn’t me, it wasn’t Kian or Mark so it must have been Shane and Brian.”</p>
