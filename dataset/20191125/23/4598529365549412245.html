      <p>Oops.</p>
      <p>House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) posted a <a href="https://twitter.com/GOPLeader/status/1198984892299780097">30-second ad</a> on Monday that praised President Donald Trump for “getting things done” despite the House impeachment investigation into Trump’s misuse of U.S. foreign policy, which includes Trump pushing a conspiracy theory about Ukraine propagated by Russia.</p>
      <p>Then CNN reporter Andrew Kaczynski noticed something ironic about the video: Some of the stock footage <a href="https://www.pond5.com/stock-footage/item/114881171-adult-farmer-holds-tablet-corn-field-and-examining-crops-agr">came from Russia</a>.</p>

      <p>Trump and his allies have been peddling the bogus conspiracy theory that Ukraine, not Russia, interfered in the 2016 elections. Former National Security Council official Fiona Hill <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/fiona-hill-opening-statement-impeachment-inquiry">warned</a> Congress last week that the conspiracy theory is a “a fictional narrative that has been perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services themselves.”</p>
