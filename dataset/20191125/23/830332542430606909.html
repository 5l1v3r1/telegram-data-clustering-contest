      <p>(CNN) - Garth Brooks made Kelly Clarkson feel his love and more when he covered Bob Dylan's "To Make You Feel My Love" on her talk show Monday.</p>
      <p>The country legend covered a few songs while sitting down with Clarkson, but it was his take on the Dylan classic that left Clarkson moved to tears.</p>
      <p>"I just can't believe my life sometimes," she said after wiping her eyes.</p>
      <p>"That's very sweet, especially coming from you," Brooks said.</p>
      <p>Before his performance, Clarkson admitted that she never knew "To Make You Feel My Love" was originally a Dylan song because no one in her life listened to Dylan growing up.</p>
      <p>"I thought it was a Garth Brooks song -- like, until I was 20," she said.</p>
      <p>Clarkson did her own cover of the song with Ben Platt <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhERWuw4aBU">back in October</a>.</p>
