      <p>An inmate who died at the Regina Provincial Correctional Centre was found in his cell with a bed sheet wrapped around his neck, according to testimony from several witnesses Monday.</p>
      <p>During the first day of a <a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/saskatchewan/inquest-set-into-death-at-regina-correctional-centre">coroner’s inquest into the death of Elton John Heebner</a> witnesses recounted the timeline of events that led up to the discovery of his body on Sept. 2, 2018. Heebner’s past struggles with mental health, suicide attempts and drug addiction were also discussed.</p>
      <p>Seven witnesses testified Monday, including an RCMP officer, paramedic, a nurse and four correctional officers.</p>
      <p>Jessie Paton, a 17-year correctional officer at the jail, described Heebner as a likeable inmate who had not been a problem. But leading up to his death, Paton said he was like a different person.</p>
      <p>“He was nonverbal. He looked very sad and just struck me as a shell of a person,” said Paton.</p>
      <p>Approximately 41-years-old at the time of his death, Heebner was originally from Moose Jaw. According to testimony from a case worker, the estranged father of two children was serving a sentence for stealing cigarettes and assaulting a clerk at a 7/11 store.</p>
      <p>RCMP Cpl. Kevin Gagne, who responded to the jail after Heebner’s body was found, watched surveillance video footage showing Heebner returning to his cell at 4:05 p.m. and putting a sheet up to cover the cell door’s window.</p>
      <p>At approximately 4:35 p.m., Gagne said a guard walked by and looked at the cell, but continued on. He passed the cell again shortly after.</p>
      <p>At the time, it was not unusual for inmates to put up a sheet for privacy when using their cell’s toilet. According to one of the correctional officers, window coverings are no longer allowed.</p>
      <p>Heebner did not exit his cell for dinner. At 8:25 p.m., inmates came outside their cells for a standing count. When Heebner didn’t show up, Paton went to his cell and tried knocking. After getting no response, she went into the cell and found Heebner lying on the floor. Paton said he appeared to be dead. Another guard said it appeared Heebner had made a knot out of part of the bed sheet and wedged it into the door jam.</p>
      <p>Paton called for medical assistance, and soon other guards and nurses arrived. Another guard on duty in the unit, Doug Deagnon, said he didn’t go upstairs to Heebner’s cell after the discovery. Paton said Deagnon returned to the guard’s office at the time. Having had a family member and friend who committed suicide in recent years, Deagnon said he resigned and never returned to the correctional centre.</p>
      <p>Angel Whitford, one of the nurses who responded, said Heebner’s medical history included three previous suicide attempts in 2015. He had no more issues with self harm in recent years, but had recently started using crystal meth while on the street. Whitford described Heebner as also having schizophrenia symptoms in recent years.</p>
      <p>Coroner’s council Robin Ritter asked several corrections staff about policies and procedures around suicide prevention, including training. Paton said she only received suicide prevention training when she was initially hired, and it was aimed more towards corrections employees.</p>
      <p>According to Whitford, inmates are asked about suicidal tendencies when first admitted. However, Whitford said suicide assessments are not done on a regular basis.</p>
      <p>After Heebner’s death, Paton was suspended for five days with no pay, which she grieved. She said the ministry has agreed to give back three of the five days. At that point in Paton’s testimony, one of the two lawyers representing the Ministry of Corrections asked Brent Gough, the inquest coroner, to remind the jury the purpose of the inquest is not to establish blame, but rather to determine the nature of someone’s death.</p>
      <p>When asked by Ritter if anything could have been done to prevent Heebner’s death, Paton said, “I don’t think so.”</p>
      <p>The inquest is scheduled to resume on Tuesday.</p>
