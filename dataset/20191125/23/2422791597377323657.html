      <h1>Texas man's death inside apartment goes unnoticed for three years</h1>

      <p>DESOTO, Texas -- Doris Stevens has wondered what happened to her adult son since he stopped answering her phone calls in 2016.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, Stevens received a grim answer when maintenance workers found Ronald Wayne White dead on the floor of his apartment in a Dallas suburb. The Dallas County Medical Examiner's Office says the condition of White's body indicates he had been dead for an "extended period," possibly three years.</p>
      <p>Police say White's apartment was locked from the inside and there was no odor in the hallway or sign of foul play.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for the apartment complex says a "highly unusual" confluence of circumstances allowed White's death to go undetected.</p>
      <p>David Margulies says White's rent was paid automatically, his mail didn't pile up and his family didn't know where he lived.</p>
