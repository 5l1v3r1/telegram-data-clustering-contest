        <b>FOR dementia sufferer Peter Farr, dogs really are man’s best friend after a specially trained pooch gave him a new leash of life.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Peter, 71, was diagnosed with the illness three years ago as his once-encyclopedic memory started to fade.</p>

      <p>When the Aussie-born Air Force veteran got the devastating news, he admits it was a hammer blow. Understandably, he found himself getting very frustrated by the debilitating and incurable illness.</p>
      <p>But that changed when a very cute two-year-old black labrador named Ruby came running into his life and even shared his passion for ROCK MUSIC.</p>
      <p>Peter’s is one of only 11 homes in Scotland to have a specially trained dementia dog.</p>
      <p>The grandad-of-two, who is cared for by wife Veryan, says: “The most important thing is that you have to accept you have dementia.</p>
      <p>“Once you realise that, you’ll think it’s a bugger but at least you’re not dead!</p>
      <p>“Dementia is only a word. Not a sentence. And if I’m having a bad day, Ruby is always there.</p>

      <p>“We listen to my rock music together, go out places and she’s been a real boost to me and Veryan. Everybody loves her. I can’t tell you how many people I’ve met because of Ruby.”</p>
      <p>Similar to guide dogs for the blind, pooches like Ruby help those with dementia to feel safe and get them out and about.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, most people don’t know that they exist so finding funding is a constant struggle.</p>
      <p>However, Alzheimer Scotland, along with MND Scotland, will benefit from funds raised at The Scottish Sun charity shop which opens on Wednesday in Glasgow.</p>

      <p>Love Island hunk Anton Danyluk will open our pop-up Sunta Store in Glasgow’s St Enoch Centre at 11am.</p>
      <p>The People’s Postcode Lottery has already donated £20,000 to our good causes, while Stagecoach chairman Sir Brian Souter has vowed to match every penny raised over the counter.</p>
      <p>As part of Dogs For Good, the Dementia Dog Project takes clever puppies and trains them to help improve the lives of those with the illness.</p>
      <p>Ruby knows how to fetch Peter’s medicine bag and can even pull off his clothes and tell him when his lunch is ready.</p>
      <p>And Veryan, 65 — who lives with her hubby in Dunblane, Perthshire — reckons the pooch has been the perfect pal for Peter.</p>
      <p>She says: “If we’re having a bad day, Ruby is our absolute rock. She’s just a loving, soppy dog who always wants a big hug.</p>
      <p>“In the morning I let her out and she comes inside rushing upstairs and wakes Peter up without a murmur from him. If I told him to get up at 7am it wouldn’t work but there’s not a word to Ruby.</p>
      <p>“But it’s not just Peter. I often feel she does more for me than him. It’s nice if I’m feeling fragile to be able to take her anywhere.</p>

      <p>“I belong to a rambling club in Stirling and they kindly said she is an honorary member. She goes because she’s so well-behaved and everyone loves her.”</p>
      <p>Veryan adds: “It’s just amazing how she’s changed our lives. Two years ago, I hadn’t heard of dementia dogs.</p>
      <p>“I remember telling Peter what he needed was a guide dog. That was the start of it.</p>
      <p>“And now Peter and Ruby are perfect together. They settle down and both listen to his ghastly music on Alexa. But as long as they’re both happy, I’m happy.”</p>
      <p>Peter’s big priority is to now raise awareness of dementia dogs so that more people like him can benefit from having their own pooch.</p>
      <p>With costs of up to £25,000 for training one dog, it’s vital to spread the word.</p>
      <p>Recently, Peter and Ruby have visited local schools to educate youngsters about dementia.</p>
      <p>He jokes: “One boy asked me ‘Have you ever forgotten your wife’s name?’ I told him, ‘No! She’d kill me’.</p>
      <p>“And many of them have said their gran or grandad has the condition. It’s good to talk about it and they all want to pat Ruby.</p>
      <p>“Then they don’t find it a frightening thing and it helps to normalise it. You can’t put a price on that.”</p>
