      <h2>David Stokes killed himself and his sons in at their home in November 2016.</h2>

      <p>A lottery-winning dad is said to have stabbed himself and his young sons to death after his wife found out about him using money on <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/prostitution">prostitutes</a> .</p>
      <p>David Stokes used a kitchen knife to inflict his fatal <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/knife-crime">knife</a> wounds, while the bodies of sons Adam, 11, and Matthew were found holding hands in bed by officers.</p>
      <p>It followed a five-hour stand-off with <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/police">police</a> where wife Sally Stokes was held hostage before being stabbed in the back.</p>
      <p>She said she also suspected her electrician husband, who had previously won £40,000 on the lottery, had used a date rape drug on her.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/lotto-winner-killed-two-sons-20956836">The Daily Mirror reports</a> how an inquest was told Stokes spent the lottery winnings on shares and a new car. He had been married to Sally, a pub assistant manager, since 2011 but their relationship deteriorated.</p>

      <p>They separated three months before the killings but remained on good terms for the sake of their sons.</p>
      <p>The tragedy unfolded on the night of November 1, 2016, at the family’s semi-detached home in Hinckley, Leicestershire.</p>
      <p>Stokes, 43, snapped after Sally confronted him earlier in the day over emails showing he was using prostitutes and had researched ‘date rape’ drugs.</p>
      <p>The electrician killed his two sons in the family home while she was meeting his relatives to discuss her concerns with them.</p>
      <p>When she returned to the house later that night he attacked her with a rolling pin and tried to smother her with a pillow.</p>
      <p>Sally gave a chilling account of the stand-off with police on the opening day of the inquest in Loughborough.</p>
      <p>She revealed how her husband calmly asked if she wanted a cup of tea before attacking her as she got changed upstairs.</p>
      <p>“I felt him hit me over the back of the head,” she said. “I fell on the bed. He put a pillow over my head and tried to suffocate me.</p>

      <p>“I wriggled and was screaming for Adam because I thought he was the only person who could help me.</p>
      <p>“I ended up by the side of the bed. He was standing there with a rolling pin. He looked evil. I thought at that moment I was going to die.”</p>
      <p>Stokes told his wife their sons were “safe” but with someone who would harm them if he did not send coded text messages.</p>
      <p>He ordered her to put her engagement and wedding rings back on and tried to force her to put cable ties around her wrists and ankles.</p>
      <p>Sally said: “I refused. I went into survival mode. I knew if I did that I was going to die.”</p>
      <p>She briefly escaped the house by hitting Stokes with the rolling pin and opening a rear patio door but he slammed her head into a brick wall.</p>
      <p>“When I was outside I was screaming, saying his name, I just hoped someone would hear and realise it was us,” she said.</p>
      <p>“He dragged me back into the house, he was saying ‘I can’t believe you hit me’.</p>
      <p>“He was saying it was all my fault. The fact is he was the one who was sleeping with prostitutes.”</p>
      <p>A neighbour had heard Sally’s screams and alerted police, who arrived at the scene shortly after 9pm.</p>
      <p>Stokes had locked the doors and refused to let officers in, leading to the five-hour stand-off.</p>

      <p>Sally told the hearing how negotiators repeatedly spoke to her husband over the phone in a bid to bring the siege to an end.</p>
      <p>After telling police he was armed with a gun, Stokes calmly led his wife upstairs and knifed her in the back.</p>
      <p>She said: “I felt a bump in my back, then I felt warmth. I put my hand there and realised I had been stabbed.</p>
      <p>“I looked at him and said his name. The look on his face was like satisfaction, as if he had kind of won. I will never, ever forget that.”</p>
      <p>Badly-injured Sally fled the house at around 2am through the front door and into the arms of police.</p>
      <p>Armed officers then stormed the property and found Stokes lying in his bed with a kitchen knife in his chest.</p>
      <p>Colleagues then found the bodies of the couple’s two tragic sons holding hands under a duvet in Matthew’s bedroom.</p>
      <p>Sally spent four days in hospital with head injuries and a stab wound to her back which caused internal bleeding and a punctured lung.</p>
      <p>She was told the day after the tragedy by police that her two sons and estranged husband had died.</p>
      <p>Police found a suicide note penned by Stokes in the garden shed in which he said he was “sorry for what I have done”.</p>
      <p>He said he had fallen in love with his wife again but it had “all come crashing down, it had to end”.</p>
      <p>Stokes added: “I love Adam and Matthew and we will all be together again soon.</p>
      <p>“Sal, I’m so sorry for all the things I’ve done and hurt you. But this last week you have had me completely and totally in love with you.</p>
      <p>“You pushed too much. If you had left it, we could have been happy forever.”</p>
      <p>In her evidence Sally said her husband had a “temper” but had never laid his hands on her.</p>

      <p>“David was a calm person but he could flip,” she said. “I used to say I had three kids, he would have tantrums like a child.</p>
      <p>“He had a temper, he would throw things. But he never harmed me or the boys.</p>
      <p>“David won the lottery and then spent it himself. He bought a new car and had been doing shares with his brothers.</p>
      <p>“We talked about the lottery win, about getting married. But then he bought a new car without asking me.</p>
      <p>“I remember asking how much we had left. He didn’t answer me. I wasn’t allowed to know about our finances.”</p>
      <p>The inquest continues.</p>
