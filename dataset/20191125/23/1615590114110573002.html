      <p>Kid-friendly game creation MMO Roblox has brought in over $1 billion in revenue since its 2005 launch, with much of its rapid growth happening over the last two years.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/roblox-one-billion-revenue">Sensor Tower</a>, the game has grossed $435 million so far in 2019 alone, 30% more than its total revenue for all of 2018. It also recently hit a monthly peak of $50 million in revenue in August 2019. For further comparison, Roblox grossed just under $46 million in the full year of 2016.</p>

      <p>The social platform's rapid growth can also be seen in its userbase, which reached <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2019-08-05-roblox-now-has-100m-monthly-active-users">100 million monthly active users</a> in August after adding a total of ten million MAUs over four months.</p>
