      <p>Australian bombshell <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/tarsha-whitmore/">Tarsha Whitmore</a> dropped jaws earlier today when she posed in a black lace lingerie bodysuit.</p>
      <p>The brunette beauty wore the bodysuit while on a balcony on the Gold Coast in Queensland. Taken at night, lights from houses below dotted the otherwise dark background.</p>
      <p>The bodysuit itself was a trendy combination of semi-sheer black lace and a piece of black striped fabric. The cups represented half of each pattern, with the top part the black lace and the bottom the stripe. The rough edge of the lace was also the trim of the bodysuit, and it effectively hugged the curve of Tarsha’s cleavage.</p>
      <p>The top featured a deep v-neckline, showcasing a generous of Tarsha’s ample assets, and a black band wrapped around under her bust to add additional support. A little gold charm was sewn in the center of the band as an added accent.</p>
      <p>The lace extended just to the top of Tarsha’s trim torso before giving way completely to the black stripes. It hugged her body, highlighting her tiny waist. The cut at the brief bottom extended all the way up towards her belly button, again emphasizing her hourglass figure.</p>
      <p>The straps of the bodysuit were likewise black and featured a buckle detail at the cups.</p>
      <p>With such a glamorous look, it was fitting that Tarsha opted for dramatic makeup as well. She used bronzer to contour her face to highlight her chiseled cheekbones and sported long and voluminous false lashes that accentuated her warm chocolate brown eyes. Completing the look was a terracotta lip color with added gloss.</p>
      <p>Tarsha’s long brunette locks were styled into loose bombshell waves, and they cascaded past her shoulder to nearly reach her hip.</p>
      <p>She posed by facing the camera directly, crossing one leg slightly in front of the other to further accentuate her curves. Her hands lightly rested on her upper thigh as she offered the camera the smallest hint of a smile.</p>

      <p>Within under three hours, the picture quickly earned close to 12,000 likes and more than 130 comments.</p>

      <p>“You’re so unreal,” raved one awestruck fan, with two sobbing and two heart-eye emoji.</p>
      <p>“How can I look like this,” sighed another follower.</p>
      <p>“The face of an angel,” wrote a third, trailing their comment with several pink hearts.</p>
      <p>“Ughhh you’re perfect,” proclaimed a fourth social media user, adding a fire emoji.</p>
      <p>In the picture, Tarsha had tagged Gooseberry Intimates, one of the many clothing companies for which she has a contract. Another company she works with is Lounge Underwear, and she advertised their attire just this morning in a picture where she tugged at her underwear set while lying in bed, as previously covered by <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/5760858/tarsha-whitmore-lounging/"><i>The Inquisitr</i></a>.</p>
