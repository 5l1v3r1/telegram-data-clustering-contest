      <p>The Tampa Bay Rays and catcher Mike Zunino agreed to a $4.5 million contract for the 2020 season on Monday, avoiding arbitration.</p>
      <p>The team has a 2021 option, also for $4.5 million, with compensation potentially growing to $5.25 million with incentives.</p>
      <p>Zunino, 28, hit .165 with nine home runs and 32 RBIs in 90 games last season. While he’ll be looking for a bounce-back season at the plate, his defense remains his calling card, as he threw out 38.6 percent of attempted base stealers (17 of 44) last season, the third-best mark in the majors.</p>
      <p>Zunino spent the first six seasons of his major league career with the Seattle Mariners before being sent to the Rays last November in a five-player trade. He has a career batting average of .202 with 104 home runs and 273 RBIs in 677 games.</p>
      <p>He was the third overall pick in the 2012 draft, making his major league debut about a year later.</p>
