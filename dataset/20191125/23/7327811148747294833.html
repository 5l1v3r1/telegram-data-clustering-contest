      <p>MINEOLA, Long Island (WABC) -- The Federal Railroad Administration has recognized the Long Island Rail Road for improving safety.</p>
      <p>As part of a new program, the LIRR <a href="https://abc7ny.com/traffic/lirr-to-upgrade-safety-at-crossings-due-to-gps-confusion/3471161/">installed new equipment </a>to better alert drivers who may become confused by GPS directions.</p>
      <p>The new initiative dramatically cut down on drivers crossing onto tracks during the dark or in inclement weather.</p>
      <p>The LIRR has a first of its kind partnership with the GPS app Waze, to alert drivers that they are approaching a grade crossing.</p>
      <p>Federal officials suggest all US railroads review the LIRR's program and consider similar changes.</p>
