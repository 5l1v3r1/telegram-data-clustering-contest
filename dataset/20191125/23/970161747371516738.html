      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/declan-donnelly/">Declan Donnelly</a> has blamed James Haskell for the I’m A Celebrity live trial fail that <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/24/im-celebrity-fans-demand-justice-james-haskell-roman-kemp-impossible-bushtucker-trial-11212111/">fans claimed was ‘impossible’ to complete.</a></p>
      <p>Roman Kemp and James failed to get a single star in their Bushtucker Trial segment, based on the day beds of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/love-island/">Love Island</a>.</p>
      <p>Given 90 seconds to unscrew three stars from their respective boxes, and rescrew them on the other side of the bed, viewers declared that it was an impossible challenge…and Ant and Dec have been defending it ever since.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Emily Atack and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/joel-dommett/">Joel Dommett</a> on Extra Camp, Dec said: ‘People are going “oh give them it, it was a fix, it was too hard”, and as I said on social media yesterday, it was done in the block through and the rehearsal.</p>
      <p>‘The stand-ins did it. It was able to [be completed].’</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>He then went on to add that James’s strategy was what ultimately let them down.</p>
      <p>‘Why he started with the crab, which was the hardest box, which was the furthest one away, I don’t know,’ Dec added.</p>
      <p>‘And he’s got sausage fingers!’ Ant laughed.</p>

      <p>Each box Roman and James had to deal with was filled with critters and animals – including a particularly snappy crab that caused havoc for James.</p>
      <p>Lying on a bed together, they were also covered in snakes as they completed the task.</p>
      <p>The guys had previously joked about the fan backlash during the main show, during a segue into the footage of a trial for care packages for the camp.</p>

      <p>Ant and Dec were seen mulling over finding a word for a ‘difficult task that was barely possible to complete’, but drawing a blank despite Mission Impossible playing in the background.</p>
      <p>Way to be subtle, you two.</p>
