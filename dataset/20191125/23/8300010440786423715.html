      <p>LOS ANGELES (KABC) -- Traveling to and from LAX this holiday season? The Los Angeles airport has made some recent changes to their ride-share pickup rules.<br/><br/>The launch of these new procedures was <a href="https://abc7.com/travel/lax-ride-share-ban-travelers-livid-after-getting-stuck-in-shuttle/5659859/">met with some confusion and frustration</a>, but the airport has rolled out some additional <a href="https://abc7.com/travel/laxs-pickup-system-implements-lot-expansion/5675862/">changes and improvements </a>to fix some of the initial challenges.<br/><br/>Whether you're traveling by Uber or Lyft, we've got everything you need to know before navigating the new pick-up system at LAX this season. You can still get dropped off curbside for departing flights by ride-share services; however, in order to get picked up, you will need to take the shuttle to the LAX-it (pronounced "L.A. Exit") lot and find your driver there.<br/><br/>Be sure to order your ride while still in the terminal and follow the instructions in the app.</p>
