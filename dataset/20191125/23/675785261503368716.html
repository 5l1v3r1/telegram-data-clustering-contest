      <h1>Voice of the Mirror: Corbyn shows our elderly respect unlike arrogant Johnson</h1>
      <h2>Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has pensioners' best interests at heart whereas Tory Boris Johnson takes them for granted</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T23:03:45+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 23:03</time> by <a rel="author">Voice of the Mirror, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/voice-of-the-mirror/</a></address>
      <p>Labour's comprehensive offer to ­pensioners in this General Election exposes the neglect of the Tories.</p>
      <p>Whether providing decent social care or righting a Conservative wrong by compensating WASPI women cheated of pensions, concerned Jeremy Corbyn shows our elderly respect whereas arrogant Boris Johnson takes them for granted.</p>
      <p>The gulf between the two parties is perhaps best illustrated by Corbyn vowing to save free TV licences from the Tory axe for millions of over-75s – after they were introduced by a previous Labour Government.</p>
      <p>On a deeper level, the treatment of senior ­citizens highlights the very different approaches of Corbyn and Johnson, Labour and Tories.</p>

      <p>Corbyn and Labour believe in social justice and leaving nobody behind, taxing the wealthiest to fund a better life for everybody.</p>
      <p>Johnson and the Conservatives on the other hand would entrench austerity, ruining public services and dodging answers to the social care crisis.</p>
      <p>Perhaps we shouldn’t be surprised when the Tories are in the pockets of rich donors.</p>
      <p>Pensioners would enjoy a much better deal under Corbyn.</p>
      <p>The question is whether enough of them realise that to vote Labour into power.</p>
