      <h1>Tom Brady Trolled Cowboys With “Bowl 96” Cadence At Line of Scrimmage (VIDEO)</h1>

      <p>The Dallas Cowboys offense could never quite get it going during the rain soaked evening at Gillette Stadium on Sunday Night, and it resulted in just 9 points scored another loss to a an above .500 team.</p>
      <p>On top of that, the team seemed to get trolled by Tom Brady late in the 4th quarter with his snap count. The Patriots QB could be heard yelling ‘Bowl 96’ at the line of scrimmage, which seems to be a shot at the last time they won a Super Bowl back in 1996.</p>

      <p>The Cowboys haven’t been back to the NFC Title game, let alone the Super Bowl since the mid 90’s, something Cowboys fans and certainly Jerry Jones would love to end soon.</p>
      <p>If the team keep going about their losing ways to better competition, it won’t be happening this season.</p>
