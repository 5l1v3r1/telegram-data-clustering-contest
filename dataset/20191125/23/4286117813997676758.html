      <p>Retired Indian Air Force personnel Nilachala Mohapatra, 56, lost all his retirement money to cyber thugs. He was duped on pretext of KYC verification of mobile digital wallet. Mohapatra said on November 11, he got a call from a person who pretended to be an employee of the e-wallet company and asked to fill the forms by downloading an app from the app store for verification of KYC form.</p>
      <p>"I had completed my KYC a year back and I told him that it has already been completed. However, he said that it has to be redone as my photograph was not clear. He made me download an app and asked me to transfer Rs 5 to an account, which is refundable. That Rs 5 was immediately refunded, but then the thugs somehow sneaked into my bank accounts and transferred Rs 7.33 lakhs from two accounts," Mohapatra told India Today.</p>
      <p>He said before he could have acted and froze the account, all his retirement funds were gone. Now Mohapatra is running pillar to post to get his life's saving back.</p>
      <p>"I have got an FIR registered with cyber cell of Noida police. I met many senior police officials and submitted all the details I have but nothing happened so far. Also, I have raised the issue with the bank. How come they allowed a transaction of such a huge amount without letting me know. Both my accounts are linked with my digital wallet and the thugs were able to hack into both," he added.</p>
      <p>An official posted with the cyber crime branch of the Gautam Budh Nagar police said the investigation in the case is on as similar complaints have been received by others.</p>
      <p>"We cannot comment about findings in one particular case but an investigation is going on at a larger level as similar complaints are being received," said the official.</p>
      <p>Deepak Gupta, a Delhi resident had a close encounter with the same kinds of thugs but awareness about apps that share the screen with others, saved him from being a target. About a week back, Deepak received a similar phone call from a mobile number, which is not active now. He shared the details of his PAN Card and Adhaar Card from KYC verification of his digital wallet, but as soon as he was asked to download a team viewer app, he sensed something amiss and disconnected the call.</p>
      <p>"The thugs tried to convince me to download an app that shares screen with others. It is similar to what we see in the offices, which the IT and system people use to fix any laptop of computer by remotely handling it from their desk. In mobile phones, it can be done through such apps. Since I was aware of such apps, I questioned the person on the phone on which he did not reply. Sensing the scam, I disconnected the phone," said Deepak, who is in videography business.<br/>Kishlay Chaudhary, a cyber security expert, says awareness is the only way to keep check on such crime.</p>
      <p>"Team viewer apps are in plenty at the app store, they are legal and can be downloaded easily and once details is share with a criminal, one can easily access to all of the stuff that is inside. People shall be aware of such thugs and such apps. KYC verification is done by physical presence of the person by taking fingerprints to connect it to Adhaar card. People shall check twice with the bank or the digital wallet. Noone asks to download anything in the mobile for verification," said Kishlay.</p>
