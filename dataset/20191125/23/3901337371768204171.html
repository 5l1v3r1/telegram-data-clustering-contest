        <b>English Premier League</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Result:</b> Aston Villa 2-0 Newcastle United</p>

      <p>Aston Villa ended a three-match winless run in the Premier League with a 2-0 triumph over Newcastle United on Monday evening.</p>
      <p>Paul Dummet earned a recall for the Magpies, replacing the injured Jamaal Lascelles as Jack McGrealish entered as one of the home sideâ€™s three key changes.</p>
      <p>Long range shots from outside the area and a few half-chances marred the opening minutes of the encounter, as either side struggled to get clear openings through.</p>
      <p>The Magpies though threatened the opener with a curling free-kick from Dummet on the far side of the penalty area, but the attempt was of no trouble to Tom Heaton following the 26th minute.</p>
      <p>Conor Hourihane changed the overall context six minutes later when he curled home a free-kick from the far side of the area after a one-two with McGrealish.</p>
      <p>Villa doubled their cushion four minutes later when Anwar El Ghazi raced onto an in-swinging free-kick from the left to rifle into the roof of the net.</p>
      <p>Newcastle came quick out of the starting blocks in the second half and had Heaton at full stretch following a low drive outside the area from Allan Saint-Maximin. Moments later, Joelinton went close to increasing the hosts tally when his header from a corner forced Martin Dubravka to go down and parry the effort.</p>
      <p>Newcastle went for a change following the 62nd minute and introduced Andy Carrol who entered for Dummet, as Steve Bruce threw caution to the wind.</p>
      <p>However, the Claret and Blue remained in the ascendancy and forced the visitors to thorough defending after threatening deliveries and attempts close to the area.</p>
      <p>This brought an end to Villa's three-match losing run in the league, as the Magpies continue their inconsistent run of results.</p>
