      <p>BUCKEYE, AZ â€” Several Arizona corrections officers became sick Monday after searching an inmate's cell at Lewis Prison prompting medical evaluations and the relocation of an inmate.</p>
      <p>Buckeye police spokeswoman Donna Rossi said emergency crews were called to the prison around 2 p.m. Bill Lamoreaux of the Arizona Department of Corrections said officers became disoriented, light-headed and began to vomit after entering a cell just before noon.</p>
      <p>Hazardous material crews were investigating the situation. Inmates reported no medical symptoms. Rossi said two corrections officers were treated at the scene and refused further care and that three others were sent to a hospital.</p>
      <p>This is the same prison that had <a href="https://www.abc15.com/news/local-news/investigations/prison-doors">past issues with broken locks and where video captured an officer being beaten by inmates</a> .</p>
