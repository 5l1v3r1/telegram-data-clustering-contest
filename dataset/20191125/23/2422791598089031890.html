      <h1>Doug Ford doubles down on pledge to push for national unity</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T23:44:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 23:44</time> by <a rel="author">Rachel Gilmore, CTVNews.ca Writer</a></address>
      <p>Ontario Premier Doug Ford said he's going to do his best to quell the tensions between Ottawa and the Prairie provinces -- but he stopped short of calling himself a unifier.</p>
      <p>"I don't know if I'd call myself a unifier, but I'll tell you, I'm going to do the best I can to cool the waters," Doug Ford told host Joyce Napier during a CTV Power Play interview that aired Monday.</p>
      <p>"I have a great relationship with all the premiers."</p>
      <p>The comment comes one year after Ford appeared alongside Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer and other Conservative premiers on the cover of Maclean's magazine. The men were labelled "The Resistance," a nod to their opposition to key policies coming from Ottawa, including the carbon tax.</p>
      <p>While Ford has adopted a new conciliatory tone, not all of the other premiers have followed suit. Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe walked out of a meeting with Trudeau last week and called it "disappointing."</p>
      <p>Ford told Napier he understands the frustrations coming from Alberta and Saskatchewan, where the federal Liberals failed to elect a single MP.</p>
      <p>"Anyone that's been out there -- it's real. You go downtown in Calgary and you see a lot of vacant, empty buildings there," said Ford.</p>
      <p>He said he had a piece of advice for Trudeau as he navigates the tensions with the Prairies – adding that he passed this tidbit along to the prime minister during their meeting last week.</p>
      <p>"It's absolutely essential he listens to the people out West," Ford said.</p>
      <p>Ford warned that the fractures in Canada's confederation could hurt the country on the global stage, where prospective investors might view the tensions within Canada as a source of uncertainty – and subsequently look to spend their money elsewhere.</p>
      <p>"We have to send the world the message of certainty. Nothing scares businesses and economic development away from regions or countries than a country not being stable, divided," said Ford.</p>
      <p>"As much as we may have differences within province to province, we have to send a united message out to the rest of the world."</p>
      <p>He added that he'll be spreading this gospel of unity at a meeting with the other premiers on Dec. 2.</p>
      <p>However, when pressed on whether fractious issues like equalization or pipelines would be raised during the meeting, Ford kept mum – except to say that he'd like to see a pipeline snake its way through Ontario to greet the refinery out East.</p>
      <p>"I've always been in favour of a pipeline going through Ontario," Ford said. "We do have the largest refinery in the country out in New Brunswick."</p>
      <p>Ford also extended an invitation to Canadians from other provinces who are struggling to find work, saying they are welcome to come to Ontario where things are "absolutely booming."</p>
      <p>"I need more people. Anyone who doesn't have a job in Canada, come to Ontario. We need you – skilled or unskilled," said Ford.</p>
