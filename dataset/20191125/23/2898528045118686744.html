      <h1>Third suspect arrested in connection with Walt Harris’ missing stepdaughter</h1>

      <p>A third suspect has been arrested and charged in connection with the disappearance of 19-year-old Aniah Blanchard, who is the stepdaughter of UFC heavyweight <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/1436/walter-walt-harris">Walt Harris</a>.</p>
      <p>Lee County District Attorney Brandon Hughes <a href="https://www.wsfa.com/2019/11/25/rd-suspect-arrested-aniah-blanchard-disappearance/">confirmed on Monday</a> that David Johnson Jr. has been arrested in Montgomery, Ala. and charged with hindering prosecution in relation to Blanchard’s disappearance.</p>
      <p>Johnson’s arrest comes after two other suspects—Ibraheem Yazeed and Antwon Fisher— were arrested and charged with first-degree kidnapping in the case.</p>
      <p>Details surrounding Johnson’s arrest haven’t been revealed yet due to a gag order issued by the judge on the case as the investigation continues.</p>
      <p>On Monday, authorities also <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/2019/11/25/20982524/lee-county-d-a-human-remains-found-believed-to-be-walt-harris-missing-stepdaughter-aniah-blanchard">released a statement </a>that human remains were found that they believe are Blanchard. The remains were discovered in Macon County, Ala. in between Auburn where Blanchard was last seen and Montgomery where her vehicle was recovered two days after she had been reported missing.</p>
      <p>Blanchard hadn’t been seen since Oct. 23 when she was spotted on surveillance footage at a local convenience store in Auburn. An eyewitness later came forward identifying Yazeed as the man he saw force Blanchard into her car against her will.</p>
      <p>Forensic evidence later showed blood in the car indicative of a “life threatening” injury and police believed Blanchard had been harmed and likely was a victim of foul play.</p>
      <p>A veteran of 13 fights in the UFC, Harris had been asking for help in the search for his missing stepdaughter ever since she first disappeared in late October.</p>
