      <p>This will mark the first meeting between UT and UAPB. The Lady Vols are coming off a 73-46 victory over Stetson last Tuesday night. Arkansas-Pine Bluff, meanwhile, fell 65-50 at Illinois last Thursday evening.</p>
      <p>Leading up to Tuesday night's game, the Lady Vols were off for a full week, the longest stretch with no games since the season began.</p>
      <p>Coach Kellie Harper said the break allowed the team to install new wrinkles, both offensively and defensively.</p>
      <p>"It is huge. We don't get enough practices. It is good for us to get some practices in and working on us instead of working on an opponent," said Harper.</p>
