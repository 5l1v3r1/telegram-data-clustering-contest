      <p>This past Sunday, former WWE Champion <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/rey-mysterio">Rey Mysterio</a> took on <i>current </i>WWE Champion Brock Lesnar in a No Holds Barred, No Disqualification match for... well... the WWE Championship.</p>
      <p>He, uh... he didn't win.</p>
      <p>That being said, the lead up to the match - Brock attacking Rey and his son, Dominick; Rey attacking Brock with a steel chair after his match at Crown Jewel; Rey attacking Brock... again with a lead pipe on Raw. OK, look, it was a much better lead up than I'm making it sound here.</p>
      <p><i>And,</i> the match itself was actually pretty fun to watch, even <i>if</i> Rey was dressed as Doink The Clown for some reason. Dominick got involved and actually showed us that, yes, he actually <i>is</i> training to be a wrestler and that it's not just something they're making up.</p>
      <p>However, while Rey looked pretty good in the match, it was a pretty decisive win for Lesnar, which means he's more than likely moving on to his next challenger. Which leaves the obvious question: where does that leave Rey? Well, putting aside the possibilities of him either getting a rematch against Brock or retiring - which, of course, are still on the table, I just don't want to talk about them - we've come up with three other ideas that WWE might have planned for the Master of the 619.</p>

      <h4>#3 Tag team with Dominick</h4>

      <p>When Dominick Mysterio (I <i>love</i> that they're calling him that) talked his father out of retiring a while back, he reminded Rey that he promised he would help his son make his wrestling debut by teaming with him. You can watch that here - it's a little cringey, but also kind of sweet.</p>

      <p>Well, provided that both Rey and Dominick feel like they got some measure of revenge against Lesnar, this could be the opportune time for Dominick to finally make his honest-to-goodness debut.</p>
      <p>I have no idea if Rey's son is even remotely ready to perform in an actual match, but having a team like... I dunno... The Ascension (remember them?) come out on Raw to confront Rey and set up some sort of tag team match for the next PPV could work. Maybe. Kinda. Kinda sorta.</p>
      <p>Let's just... move on.</p>
