      <p>The Eredivisie side are level on points with their two rivals in the group, but <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/lille/"><b>Lille</b></a> are cut adrift at the bottom with just one point from their four games.</p>

      <p>Lille's fantastic Ligue 1 campaign of last season in which they finished second behind dominant force Paris Saint-Germain feels very much like a distant memory in light of the struggles of this term.</p>
      <p>The French side are just <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/ligue-1/table.html">10th in the league</a> this year as the demands of European football take their toll on the team's performances, while the departure of star forward <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/nicolas-pepe/"><b>Nicolas Pepe</b></a> to Arsenal has clearly had a negative effect on the club.</p>
      <p>Lille are on a run of poor form at present, with three defeats and no wins in their last four games across all competitions, and just one win from their last 10.</p>
      <p>With just one point so far in Group H, it would take a remarkable turnaround even to earn a Europa League qualification spot, given the six-point gap between them and the leading pack.</p>
      <p>Ajax, on the other hand, are having a stellar season both domestically and in Europe, and may feel aggrieved not to be top of the group outright.</p>
      <p>The reigning Eredivisie champions are <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/eredivisie/2019-20/table.html">top of the league</a> once more, five points clear of nearest challengers AZ Alkmaar.</p>
      <p>The Dutch side also top their <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/champions-league/"><b>Champions League</b></a> group, but are still level on points with Chelsea and Valencia after taking just one point from their two games against the Blues following some controversial VAR decisions that went against them.</p>
      <p>With the Premier League side out of the way, however, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/erik-ten-hag/"><b>Erik ten Hag</b></a>'s side may feel confident of claiming maximum points from their remaining two games to secure qualification to the knockout stages, having brushed aside both Lille and Valencia in their meetings with the pair earlier this season.</p>

      <p>Lille are without teenage striker <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/timothy-weah/"><b>Timothy Weah</b></a> due to a muscle injury that has kept him out of action since the end of August.</p>
      <p>However, aside from the 19-year-old, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/christophe-galtier/"><b>Christophe Galtier</b></a> has no other fitness concerns to contend with.</p>
      <p>Ten Hag is unable to call on a forward of his own in <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/david-neres/"><b>David Neres</b></a>, with the winger not expected to return from a knee problem until the turn of the year.</p>
      <p>Versatile defender <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/joel-veltman/"><b>Joel Veltman</b></a> is also likely to be out of action, having just picked up a muscle injury and it is not yet known when he will return.</p>
      <p>The rest of the Ajax squad remain healthy and available, however, with several possible options to cover for the two missing men.</p>
      <p><b>Lille possible starting lineup:</b><br/>Maignan; Djalo, Fonte, Gabriel; Celik, Andre, Soumare, Xeka, Mandava; Ikone, Araujo</p>
      <p><b>Ajax possible starting lineup:</b><br/>Onana; Mazraoui, Shuurs, Blind, Tagliafico; Van de Beek, Martinez; Labyad, Ziyech, Promes; Tadic</p>

      <h3>We say: Lille 1-3 Ajax</h3>
      <p>Lille are struggling at present while last season's semi-finalists are flying and have lost just one game all season. Expect Ten Hag's team to brush their faltering opponents aside once again, playing some lovely football in the process.</p>
