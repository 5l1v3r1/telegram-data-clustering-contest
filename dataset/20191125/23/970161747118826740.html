      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/caitlyn-jenner/">Caitlyn Jenner</a> is still getting to grips with the new celebrities around her on I’m a Celebrity…Get Me Out Of Here.</p>
      <p>But on Extra Camp tonight she was confronted with the biggest challenge of all – could she tell the difference between Ant and Dec?</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/emily-atack/">Emily Atack</a> asked the American star the question to end all questions via a direct chat with the Bush Telegraph on Monday’s episode of the spin-off show.</p>
      <p>Caitlyn, as blunt as always, beamed as she said: ‘Do I know which one is Ant or which one is Dec?…No!’</p>
      <p>But then she backtracked and said: ‘I think [I do]. Ant looks like an ant, with dark features and Dec, he’s a little bit shorter.</p>
      <p>‘But see, I can remember Dec because of Dec-athlon. That’s what I did,’ she then said.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>Then cheekily added: ‘…But he doesn’t look like a decathlete.’</p>

      <p>Hey, everyone gets them confused from time-to-time Cait! But we think you’ve got it cracked.</p>
      <p>The 70-year-old campmate has become a firm favourite with viewers thanks to her parental nature with the others and her ever-quotable way of thinking.</p>
      <p>However she could cost them dearly over the next couple of days after being <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/25/im-a-celebrity-caitlyn-jenner-risks-punishment-by-sneaking-food-to-ian-wright-11218040/">caught handing Ian Wright a contraband corn on the cob</a> from a banquet dinner that she won, but he missed out on.</p>

      <p>While both completely denied doing it, Ian in particular was awful at being subtle about the food, and was seen clearly munching it in his hammock.</p>
      <p>She was also seen leaning into Ant and Dec’s Geordie accent at the end of Monday night’s main episode, leaving the pair chuffed as she greeted them with an ‘Howay, Pet!’</p>
      <p>Cheering her on for the efforts, after leaving the camp an excited Ant was clearly delighted as he declared: ‘She’s learned Geordie!’</p>
      <p>You’ve done alreet, fellas!</p>
