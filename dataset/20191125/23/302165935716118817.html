      <p>LOS ANGELES, Nov 26 — On its first weekend in theatres, the long-awaited sequel to the magical adventures of Elsa and Anna has enjoyed a prodigious launch with US$350 million (RM1.46 billion) in sales worldwide. <i>Frozen 2</i> has set a new record for the highest-grossing opening for an animated film.</p>
      <p>Released in 38 territories at the weekend, <i>Frozen 2</i> has already taken in US$350.2 million around the globe, according to the latest figures from ComScore.</p>
      <p>In North America, Disney's animated film totalled US$127 million, ahead of China's US$53 million. The new feature is also a success in South Korea (US$31.5million), Japan (US$18.2million), Great Britain (US$17.8 million), Germany (US$14.9 million), France (US$13.4 million), Mexico (US$9.3 million), Indonesia (US$6.2 million), the Philippines (US$6.1 million) and Spain (US$5.8 million).</p>
      <p><i>Frozen 2</i> now tops the rankings for the highest grossing launch of an animated movie, if you do not take into account the latest live-action version of <i>The Lion King</i>, ahead of the<i> Incredibles 2</i> (US$242 million) and <i>Toy Story 4</i> (US$240.9 million). Of course the original 2013 <i>Frozen</i> was one of the biggest successes in the history of animated film with close to US$1.3 billion in sales.</p>
      <p>Far behind, <i>Ford v Ferrari</i>, last week's world box-office leader, is now placed second with US$30.7 million. Released only in the US and Canada, <i>A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood</i> with Tom Hanks has entered directly in third place with US$13.5 million.</p>
