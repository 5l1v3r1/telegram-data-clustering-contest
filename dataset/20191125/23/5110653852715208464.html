      <p>Sunday was devoid of many major injuries, but afterupdates came out Monday, there are a few players worth worrying about heading into Week 13.Eric Ebron will be out beyond that, as he was placed on Injured Reserve, while Carson Wentz is dinged up and Golden Tate has entered into concussion protocol. Here's a catch-all injury update on those three players and what it could mean for Jack Doyle, Darius Slayton and Sterling Shepard as you prepare to make your waiver pickups.</p>

      <h3>Carson Wentz injury update</h3>
      <p>Wentz is day-to-day with a bruised hand, <a href="https://twitter.com/RealDGunnNBCS/status/1199012268350025732">Doug Pederson said Monday</a>. The quarterback is expected to be fine for a matchup with Miami on Sunday in Week 13.</p>
      <p>Wentz struggled without Alshon Jeffery, Nelson Agholor and Jordan Howard in Week 12, throwing two interceptions and losing a pair of fumbles. If any of those players can make it back to the field in Week 13, that would help Wentz as much as recovering from a dinged-up hand would, especially in favorable matchup.</p>

      </p>
      <h3>Golden Tate injury news</h3>
      <p>Tate has entered concussion protocol after apparently being injured on his touchdown in the fourth quarter Sunday. He had been blown up earlier in the game on a punt return and checked out before returning, so there might have been a couple of costly blows to Tate's head in that game.</p>
      <p>Sterling Shepard and Darius Slayton both played slightly more than Tate on Sunday, and both would be WR3/FLEX options in Week 13 against the Packers if Tate is out. If all three play, they all can have some FLEX utility.</p>
      <h3>Eric Ebron to IR; Jack Doyle fantasy outlook</h3>
      <p>Eric Ebron (ankle) was placed on Injured Reserve, ending his season. That means Jack Doyle is probably in line for a bit more production, with Mo Alie-Cox, the former VCU basketball player, stepping into a larger role as well.</p>
      <p>Doyle should see his floor rise a bit and could average four catches per game the rest of the way, which is enough to have some back-end PPR value. Alie-Cox could snag a few red-zone touchdowns in the Ebron role, but he's not worth a pickup.</p>
