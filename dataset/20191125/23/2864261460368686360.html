      <h2>President on Conan, a Belgian Malinois: ‘Right now, probably the world’s most famous dog’</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T23:55:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 23:55</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.bashawstar.com/author/ap-staff/" target="_blank">Associated Press</a></address>
      <p>A U.S. military dog that played a starring role in the raid that killed Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi seemed oblivious to the praise that President Donald Trump heaped on him Monday at the White House.</p>
      <p>Conan, a Belgian Malinois, seemed much more interested in the head scratches from Mike Pence, repeatedly looking up at the vice-president in search of more attention.</p>
      <p>Trump used a slew of adjectives to describe Conan, who was injured when he was exposed to electric wires in the late October raid while <a href="https://www.vicnews.com/news/trump-says-islamic-state-leader-dead-after-us-raid-in-syria/">chasing al-Baghdadi at the terrorist’s compound in northwest </a><a href="https://www.vicnews.com/news/trump-says-islamic-state-leader-dead-after-us-raid-in-syria/">Syria</a>. “Incredible.” “Brilliant.” “Smart.” “Ultimate fighter.” “Very special.” “Tough cookie.”</p>
      <p>“So this is Conan,” Trump said. “Right now, probably the world’s most famous dog.”</p>
      <p>Trump said he bestowed a medal on the dog and presented him with a plaque. First lady Melania Trump stood a few feet away.</p>
      <p>The president said initially Conan was going to be muzzled for the appearance, but he thought that would put the dog in attack mode.</p>
      <p>“He’s not in a bad mood today,” Trump told dozens of reporters and TV crews gathered in the Rose Garden. “So, you’re safe.”</p>
      <p>Trump said he asked members of the U.S. special forces who met with him that day if an unarmed man would stand a chance against Conan. He said the special forces, who could not appear in public, told him “No.”</p>
