        <b>Ben Mitchell (<a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/max-bowden/">Max Bowden</a>) was a little perturbed in EastEnders when he first discovered that Callum ‘Halfway’ Highway (Tony Clay) <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/08/eastenders-spoilers-ben-mitchell-horrified-as-callum-highway-reveals-he-wants-to-join-the-police-11066923/">wanted to pursue a career in the police</a>. However, he came to accept that <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/13/eastenders-spoilers-callum-highway-has-a-huge-proposition-for-ben-mitchell-10961927/">love was more important than any old dodgy dealings</a>, and thus he decided to pack in a life of crime in favour of a happier one with his man.</b>
      </p>
      <p>In spite of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/eastenders-spoilers-ben-mitchell-vows-to-change-and-makes-a-big-gesture-11014532/">Ben having turned over a new leaf</a> so that his relationship with Callum could thrive, it appears as if <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/eastenders-spoilers-ben-mitchell-callum-highway-fight-tonight-police-job-11175869/">his initial suspicions</a> — that his boyfriend’s line of work would prove a problem for his dodgy deals — are proven correct in the coming episodes, as Tubbs offers Ben a job, but Ben refrains from accepting — which leads to Tubbs discovering that Callum’s interested in joining the police.</p>
      <p>What with them all living in the delightful community known as Walford, it doesn’t take long for such news to travel, and several of Phil’s (Steve McFadden) associates get wind of the situation, and thus pull out of deals.</p>

      <p>However, Ben’s more interested in helping Callum with his training, but — determined to rectify the situation — Shirley (Linda Henry) hunts him down and warns him about the severity of said situation. As a result, Ben comes to the realisation that he’s got a problem to solve.</p>

      <p>As Louise (Tilly Keeper) goes into labour, Ben rushes to the hospital to be by her side, but while there, he realises how emotional Phil is, and attempts to console him — which leads to the pair having something of a heart-to-heart.</p>

      <p>As a result, Ben can’t help but feel guilty over what’s happened to his dad’s reputation, and thus he sets about rectifying the situation.</p>
      <p>Later, he meets with Shirley and Phil at The Arches, before Tubbs arrives to see what they have to say.</p>
      <p>Ben’s incredibly creative — as he’s proven in the past before — so what will this plan of his entail?</p>
      <p>What’s more, will it impact his relationship with Callum?</p>
