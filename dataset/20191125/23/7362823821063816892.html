      <p>A <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/florida">Florida</a> man who was attacked by an intruder on Saturday fought back, and now the suspect is in police custody, authorities said.</p>
      <p>On Saturday around 10:20 p.m., Barry Sands was asleep at home in Miami when he woke up to what sounded like a “hysterical female banging on the front door of the residence, asking for help,” according to the arrest affidavit.</p>
      <p>Sands opened the front door and was allegedly attacked by a man identified by police as Mark Katsnelson, 35, court records said.</p>

      <p>Katsnelson forced his way into the home as he was striking Sands with his hands, the complaint said, adding that Sands had a cut on his lip and toe as a result of the alleged attack.</p>
      <p>Sands punched Katsnelson several times in the face in what seemed to be a case of self-defense, police said.  He then called 911.</p>
      <p>Katsnelson suffered facial injuries and was transported to medical facilities in Florida for treatment.</p>
