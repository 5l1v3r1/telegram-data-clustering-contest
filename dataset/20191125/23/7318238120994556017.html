      <h1>At least 143 protesters have died in Iran, says Amnesty International</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T23:32:30+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 23:32</time> by <a rel="author">Euronews </a></address>
      <p>Iran's security forces may have killed at least 143 people during recent protests.</p>
      <p>That's according to human rights organisation Amnesty International which says the deaths resulted from the use of firearms and tear gas from security forces.</p>
      <p>Protests broke out in Iran on November 15 after the government announced an increase in fuel prices.</p>
      <p>Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said last week that the protests were a security matter that had not been carried out by the people.</p>
      <p>Tehran has previously said death toll figures were "fabricated".</p>
      <p>Amnesty International says that accounts from eyewitnesses and victims as well as video footage showing security forces shooting unarmed protesters "provide clear evidence".</p>
      <p>"The international community’s cautious and muted response to the unlawful killing of protesters is woefully inadequate," said Philip Luther, Amnesty International’s Middle East Research and Advocacy Director.</p>
      <p>Access to the internet was blocked during the demonstrations in one of the largest internet blackouts the country has experienced.</p>
      <p>Experts said that authorities were curtailing access to the internet to stop people from organising.</p>
