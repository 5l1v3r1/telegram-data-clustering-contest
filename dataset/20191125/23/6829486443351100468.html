      <h1>Trust No One: Turns Out That Rage Against The Machine Tour ‘Leak’ Was Fake</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T23:23:35+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 23:23</time> by <a rel="author">Jared Richards</a></address>
      <p>Yesterday, we <a href="https://junkee.com/splendour-rage-against-the-machine/231741">reported on a seeming tour leak</a> that suggested Rage Against The Machine were locked in to headline Splendour In The Grass next year. Unfortunately, the good folks at <a href="https://wallofsoundau.com/2019/11/25/a-leaked-rage-against-the-machine-tour-poster-has-them-playing-splendour-2020/"><i>Wall Of Sound</i></a> have spoken to the troll reportedly behind the ‘leaked’ poster, and it looks like we might be waiting a little bit longer to see ‘Killing In The Name’ live.</p>

      <p>The ‘leak’ came in the form of a 2020 world tour poster, which listed shows in Melbourne and Byron Bay around the time of Splendour, and was even supposedly re-shared on the band’s Instagram in a now-deleted post.</p>
      <p>While we’re generally pretty suspicious of tour poster leaks, the Instagram screenshot was the touch that made it seem real. Unfortunately, someone got in touch with <i>WOS</i> to let them know they had faked the whole thing.</p>
      <p>“So, the insta was shopped, the poster isn’t anything amazing but the Insta really sells it,” they told <i>WOS</i>. “I just changed the post count and time stamp of it haha As far as why [I did it], I mean, I love a good troll hey. Plus how sick would it be if Rage did get their ass down here, and Splendour doesn’t seem too far out of the realm of possibility. Especially as it’s their 20th year.”</p>

      <p>One clue that things were off was that the post misspelt Auckland. Better luck next time. Still, maybe the band’s team saw the feverish reaction the hoax created, and realise that there’s a market for an Australian tour? Consider their Coachella 2020 set a warm up for the real event… right?</p>
