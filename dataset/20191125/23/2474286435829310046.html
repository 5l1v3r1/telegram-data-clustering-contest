      <p>Three regional supplier briefings will be held along the Narrabri to North Star (N2NS) section of the Inland Rail next week, as the project gains speed.</p>
      <p>The meetings will be held in North Star, Moree and Narrabri from December 2 to 4, and follow on from fully-subscribed industry briefings last month in Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne as interest in upgrading approximately 171km of existing track continues to grow.</p>
      <p>Inland Rail Chief Executive Officer Richard Wankmuller said local businesses were keen to get involved in the project and the regional supplier briefings would provide a platform to ask questions and start to be prepared for when Inland Rail announces the successful tenderers.</p>

      <p>"We are at an exciting stage marking the start of the formal procurement process for our second major component of the Inland Rail project," he said.</p>
      <p>"It also sends a clear message that Inland Rail is progressing and the benefits it will bring to regional communities are real.</p>
      <p>"The Parkes to Narromine section of Inland Rail is about 10 months into construction and the economic benefits in that community can be clearly seen. Inland Rail is investing significant dollars into local businesses with the spend in the area around $46.7 million so far.</p>
      <p>"Nearly 1000 people have worked on the Parkes to Narromine section with 395 of them local residents. Around 80 local businesses have also supplied to the project. We are already achieving some great outcomes for those communities and I expect similar results in the Narrabri to North Star section.</p>
      <p>"From the outset Inland Rail has had a focus on creating opportunities for regional workforces and we are also engaging with businesses right across Australia to fill the contracts for the project's build."</p>
      <p>Mr Wankmuller said interest in Inland Rail was continuing to build momentum across not only regional Australia, but in metropolitan areas.</p>
      <p>"Companies from throughout Australia are making enquiries on how to bid for Inland Rail projects. They are lining up to be part of this process," he said.</p>
      <p>"The successful bidder will need to meet procurement and contractual obligations around local employment targets and the Australian Rail Track Corporation will work very closely with them to maximise local participation.</p>
      <p>"We see Inland Rail as a way to create meaningful change in communities along the alignment by developing a pathway to support longer term employment outcomes. I know there is excitement building in the N2NS section as we move towards construction next year and local companies are looking to be ready to hit the ground running once the successful bid is announced."</p>
