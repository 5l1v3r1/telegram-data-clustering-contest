      <h3>A 17-year-old boy was out on bail, awaiting sentencing for two home invasions, when he was charged in connection with Saskatoon’s 15th homicide of 2019.</h3>
      <p>The boy — <a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/news/crime/saskatoons-15th-homicide-of-2019-teen-charged-with-murder-in-shooting-death-of-15-year-old">one of three teens charged with second-degree murder</a> after a 15-year-old boy was fatally shot on Nov. 7  — pleaded guilty to breaking into two homes to commit robbery in April and received an 18-month youth sentence in Saskatoon provincial court on Monday.</p>

      <p>His identity is protected under the Youth Criminal Justice Act.</p>
      <p>According to an agreed statement of facts, the boy was driving around with three friends before breaking into a home on Grey Avenue in the Forest Grove neighbourhood and then, just minutes later, a home on Pohorecky Cove in the Evergreen neighbourhood.</p>
      <p>Court heard the Grey Avenue residents chased the teen, who was dressed in black and carrying a tire iron, with a bat.</p>
      <p>During the second break-in, the teen smashed a back window and swung a tire iron at the homeowner, Crown prosecutor Victoria Kindrachuk said. The man threw a dog dish out the broken window to keep the intruder from getting inside.</p>
      <p>Police later arrested the boy in a vehicle filled with black clothing, knives, a hammer and a 16-inch pipe. The teen admitted breaking into the homes, saying he needed to steal money to pay off a large drug debt.</p>
      <p>Nothing was stolen during either home invasion, court heard.</p>
      <p>One victim provided an impact statement, which Kindrachuk read out at the sentencing hearing. The man described his lingering paranoia, and how he wrote out “panic drill” instructions on a closet drawer for his five-year-old child.</p>
      <p>“He went over this drill with him numerous times, until the five-year-old was able to repeat that drill on command,” Kindrachuk read.</p>
      <p>Court heard the teen does not have a prior criminal record, although he told a pre-sentence report writer that he’s been committing crimes since he was 10 years old.</p>
      <p>Legal aid director Joanne Khan said her biggest concern is that her client has learning disabilities for which he is unwilling to take medication, instead using cannabis, cocaine and pain pills daily. </p>
      <p>The teen said he did a brief stint in rehab to “look good” in court, Kindrachuk said, adding he also told a report writer that he doesn’t need any further addictions treatment.</p>
      <p>He chose random home invasions instead of turning to his loving, supportive family — something many kids in the youth criminal justice system don’t have, Kindrachuk noted. She said the Crown hopes some time in a structured facility will help the boy make healthy connections with a clear head. </p>
      <p>Judge Marilyn Penner accepted the joint submission from the Crown and defence: An 18-month sentence comprised of 12 months in custody and six months of community supervision.</p>
      <p>While on a six-month probation order following his sentence, the teen will be on a strict curfew, cannot possess any weapons and must take in-patient addictions treatment as required. He also cannot have any contact with known gang members.</p>
      <p>Kindrachuk said the boy “seems to revere the gang lifestyle” and chooses criminal friends over positive activities.</p>
      <p>He acknowledges that he scared innocent people and wrote an apology letter to his victims, Khan said.</p>
      <p>His next court appearance on the murder charge is scheduled for Dec. 11.</p>
