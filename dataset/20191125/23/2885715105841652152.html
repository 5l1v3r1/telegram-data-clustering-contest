      <p>To spread awareness and promote research about owls, the Ela Foundation and Savitribai Phule Pune University will conduct the 6th World Owl Conference (WOC) in Pune from November 29 to December 2.</p>
      <p>“Owls kill harmful crop pests and are actually economically beneficial to an agricultural country like ours. So, we need to understand owls in scientific light and spread the message that owls are our friends, to prevent poaching, killing and trapping of owls for black magic, trade, pseudo-medicinal purposes and other superstitious beliefs,” said Dr Pande.</p>
      <p>A total of 46 research papers will be presented at the WOC by researchers from 16 countries. WOC will also include an exhibition of photographs of owls of India, posters and stalls about owl paraphernalia and video sessions, among others.</p>
      <p>This owl conference is being held for for the first time in India, said Professor Dr Satish Pande, organising secretary, WOC. The conference will be held at Pune University.</p>
      <p>A special students workshop will be held during the WOC. Ela Foundation will also host the 16th ‘Certificate Course in Ornithology’ after the WOC to promote conservation of owls and other birds.</p>
      <p>The Maharashtra Forest Department, Canada-based Discover Owls and Poland-based Ecotone are among the organisations and agencies that have supported WOC. According to a TRAFIC India report, 78,000 owls were killed in one year alone.</p>
      <p>Researchers like James Duncan (Canada), the author of ‘Owls of the World’, Alexadre Roulin (Switzerland), Prof. Reuven Yosef (Israel), Ingrid Kohl (Austria), Jonathan Haw (S. Africa) among many others will share their research findings to promote owl conservation.</p>
      <h3>Owl festival on December 3 and 4</h3>
      <p>Following the WOC in Pune, Ela Foundation will hold the 2nd Indian Owl Festival on December 3 and 4 at Ela Habitat, Pingori, taluka Purandar, near Jejuri. The festival will display more than 1,000 owl paintings, sculptures, masks, mugs, caps and rangoli art made by students from more than 100 schools. Visitors can enjoy hand and face owl paintings, watch owl films, owl dances, owl skits, owl songs, monologues, owl Kirtan, take selfies at owl photo points and watch the ‘Maha-Uluk’ made from grass.</p>
      <p>‘Last year, more than 15,000 visitors had attended the Indian Owl Festival. This year, we shall have visitors from several foreign countries as well,” added Pande.</p>
