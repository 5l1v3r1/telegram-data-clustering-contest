      <h1>Ripple Completes Promised $50M Investment in MoneyGram With Final $20M</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T23:50:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 23:50</time> by <a rel="author">Joeri Cant</a></address>
      <p>Major money transmission network MoneyGram has announced that blockchain-based payments firm<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/ripple"> </a>Ripple has completed its original commitment with a final $20 million investment.</p>
      <p>In a Nov. 25 press release, MoneyGram <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ripple-makes-investment-in-moneygram-equity-to-complete-original-investment-commitment-expansion-of-on-demand-liquidity-accelerated-300964278.html">announced</a> that Ripple Labs Inc. has made a final $20 million equity investment in MoneyGram as part of Ripple's original $50 million equity investment commitment.</p>
      <h3>A total investment of $50 million </h3>
      <p>In June, the two companies <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/ripple-to-invest-up-to-50m-in-moneygram-following-new-partnership">entered</a> into a 2-year-strategic partnership to collaborate in cross-border payments and foreign exchange settlements with digital assets. As part of the agreement, MoneyGram would be able to draw up to $50 million dollars from Ripple in exchange for equity.</p>
      <p>MoneyGram will reportedly use Ripple’s xRapid liquidity product to allow for money to be sent in one currency and instantly settled in the destination currency. By using Ripple’s<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/xrp-price-index"> XRP</a> token for such transfers, xRapid can purportedly settle such transactions faster than with fiat currencies or other major digital assets. Ripple's CEO Brad Garlinghouse commented on the latest investment:</p>
      <blockquote>"Last month, we announced that MoneyGram began using On-Demand Liquidity for payments to the Philippines, and we're excited to support MoneyGram's further expansion into Europe and Australia. Digital assets and blockchain technology have the potential to make a tremendous impact on cross-border payments — MoneyGram and Ripple is an example of that [...] In June, we announced this partnership, and it's encouraging to see the rapid growth and benefits come to life." </blockquote>
      <p>Ripple purchased the equity from MoneyGram at $4.10 per share and will now own reportedly  9.95% of MoneyGram’s common stock.</p>
      <h3>Majority of crypto will probably go to zero</h3>
      <p>At the beginning of November, Garlinghouse <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/ripple-ceo-only-1-of-todays-cryptocurrencies-will-survive">claimed</a> that there are too many cryptocurrencies so far, forecasting that only 1% of the total are here to stay and that this small number of crypto projects will be game-changing and grow significantly in coming decades since they will be focused on solving real problems for real customers. </p>
      <p>He hinted that very few will actually be able to meet customer needs, arguing that the vast majority of them “probably goes to zero.” He stated:</p>
      <blockquote>“Anytime there is a new market, there are a lot of people that run into that market and try to show that they can solve a problem, they can deliver a customer need.”</blockquote>
