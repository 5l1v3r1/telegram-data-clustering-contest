      <p>Deadpool actor Ryan Reynolds has bought an ownership stake in the US mobile operator <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3778667-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fnetwork-wifi%2Fryan-reynolds-buys-stake-in-us-mvno-mint-mobile-3778667%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mintmobile.com%2F">Mint Mobile</a>.</p>
      <p>Announced via a press release and on Reynolds' social media channels, he said, “Celebrities generally invest in high-end products like skincare brands or delicious gin companies. Yet Mint is making wireless way more affordable at a time when the average American is paying 65 dollars a month. I’m excited to champion a more practical approach to the most essential technology.”</p>

      <p>Mint is a subsidiary of MVNO Ultra Mobile, and both piggyback the T-Mobile network in the US. Mint offers plans from $15 per month, the amount Reynolds will be paid monthly for his role. Reynolds also owns Aviation American Gin and has been help shake up its marketing, including in a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3778667-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fnetwork-wifi%2Fryan-reynolds-buys-stake-in-us-mvno-mint-mobile-3778667%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DJbqw5foE7Mg">humorous crossover advert with Samsung</a>. </p>
      <p>The move comes shortly after T-Mobile’s divisive and disruptive CEO John Legere announced he was stepping down from his role. US telecoms is a pretty dour place and no matter what you think of him, Legere broke the mould. Maybe Reynolds will, too.</p>
