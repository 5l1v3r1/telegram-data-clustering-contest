      <p>The Madhya Pradesh High Court on Monday sought suggestions from the Central and state governments, petitioners and others on steps needed to improve the quality of healthcare services being provided to victims of the 1984 Bhopal gas tragedy. A division bench of Chief Justice AK Mittal and Justice MF Anwar heard a bunch of petitions seeking improvement in the quality of healthcare services and other issues pertaining to the industrial disaster, the petitioners' counsel Naman Nagrath and senior advocate Rajesh Chand told PTI.</p>
      <h3>Suggestions sought on steps to be taken for improving healthcare facilities</h3>
      <p>"The court sought suggestions from the Central and Madhya Pradesh governments, petitioners and others on steps to be taken for improving (the quality of) healthcare facilities for the victims of the tragedy," they said. The petitioners were asked to file their suggestions by December 18, they added.
