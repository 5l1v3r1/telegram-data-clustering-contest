      <h1>RBA Deputy Governor Debelle: Sees steady wage growth over next couple of years</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T23:52:12+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 23:52</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fxstreet.com/author/ross-j-burland" target="_blank">Ross J Burland</a></address>
      <p>RBA commentary is what traders are focussing on today for the <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/currencies/audusd">Aussie</a> and we are now hearing from Deputy Governor Debelle on Employment and Wages to the Australian Council of Social Service national conference.</p>
      <p>Analysts at Westpac explained that this is "a very hot topic but the main focus will still be Governor Lowe’s speech in the Sydney evening (8:05pm/ 5:05pm Sing/HK) to business economist on Unconventional Monetary Policy: Some Lessons from Overseas."</p>

      <h3>Key comments </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Sees steady wage growth over next couple of years.</li>
        <li>Growing evidence that wage rises of 2-3% now the norm in Australia, rather than 3–4%.</li>
        <li>If wage growth entrenched at 2-3%, tighter labour market will have to be to force a wage rise.</li>
        <li>Gradual lift in wages growth would be welcome for workforce, economy.</li>
        <li>Says wage lift also needed for inflation to reach 2–3% target range.</li>
        <li>Says jobs growth stronger than expected in recent years, but also labour supply.</li>
        <li>Supply driven by rise in participation rates of females and older workers.</li>
        <li>One key uncertainty is whether labour supply will continue to expand.</li>
        <li>Need unemployment down near 4.5% to lift wages.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>FX implications</h4>
      <p>This is familiar rhetoric from Debelle and has no material impact on the Aussie. </p>
