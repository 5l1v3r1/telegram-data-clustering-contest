      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 26 ― Malaysia will continue to play an active role in seeking solutions to the Palestine-Israel conflict and towards the establishment of an independent and sovereign state of Palestine.</p>
      <p>Deputy Foreign Minister Datuk Marzuki Yahya said the government would continue to provide support to Palestinians in terms of political, economic, social aspects as well as financial assistance.</p>
      <p>He said this in a special chamber session in Parliament, yesterday.</p>
      <p>The session was held after obtaining the permission of Dewan Rakyat Speaker Tan Sri Mohamad Ariff Md Yusof to debate a special motion to denounce the airstrikes by the Zionist regime which killed and injured civilians in the Gaza Strip recently.</p>
      <p>Describing it as extreme and disrespectful of international laws, Marzuki said Malaysia strongly condemned the Israeli attack.</p>
      <p>“The attack could be considered as a violation of Article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights on everyone's right to life, liberty and security,” he said.</p>
      <p>During the session, Kota Baru MP Datuk Takiyuddin Hassan proposed that the government declare solidarity with the Palestinians and help strengthen efforts of local non-governmental organisations to seek prosecution of Israelis at the International Criminal Court. ― Bernama</p>
