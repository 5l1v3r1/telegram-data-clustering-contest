      <h1>Why Sonic Healthcare shares are at an all-time high</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T23:36:50+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 23:36</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fool.com.au/author/kennethhallau/" target="_blank">Kenneth Hall</a></address>
      <p>Shares in <b>Sonic Healthcare Limited </b><a href="https://www.fool.com.au/company/Sonic+Healthcare+Limited/?ticker=ASX-SHL">(ASX: SHL)</a> hit a new mark of $30.13 in early trade yesterday despite no news or announcements from the Aussie healthcare group. </p>
      <p>So, what’s driving Sonic Healthcare shares higher in 2019 and is there still time to buy?</p>
      <h3>Why Sonic Healthcare shares are surging higher</h3>
      <p>Sonic Healthcare shares have been racing higher in 2019 and are up more than 36% in 2019 so far.</p>
      <p>This is an especially strong run when you consider the <b>S&amp;P/ASX 200 Index </b><a href="https://www.fool.com.au/latest-asx-200-chart-price-news/">(INDEXASX: XJO)</a> is up 21.12% over the same period.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.fool.com.au/2019/08/23/why-you-should-look-at-sonic-healthcare-shares-for-long-term-growth/">A strong full year result</a> has been a big boost for Sonic, while the ASX healthcare stocks have had a relatively good year as well.</p>
      <p>Sonic reported 18% revenue growth in the United States with 5% organic growth once its <a href="https://www.afr.com/companies/healthcare-and-fitness/sonic-healthcare-beefs-up-us-operations-in-750m-deal-20181212-h190ll">Aurora acquisition</a> is excluded.</p>
      <p>The Aussie healthcare company is forecasting future growth in the United States, which could see its group revenue share grow even further.</p>
      <p>CEO Dr. Colin Goldschmidt said Sonic’s pipeline for acquisition and hospital laboratory opportunities remains strong. Sonic has operations across Australia, the United States, New Zealand, Germany, Ireland and Switzerland.</p>
      <p>Sonic shares climbed higher on the back of the result as the company boosted its final dividend by 4.1% to 51 cents per share.</p>
      <h3>Is there time to buy Sonic on the ASX?</h3>
      <p>Some investors might be wary of purchasing a company at or near its all-time high.</p>
      <p>This can be very wise, but there is also the potential for momentum to carry Sonic shares higher in the short-term.</p>
      <p>However, if you’re a buy-and-hold investor like me, you should be looking at the long-term potential of Sonic.</p>
      <p>Strong earnings and the potential for expansion could be 2 good reasons to buy Sonic Healthcare shares in November.</p>
      <p>The company also has a market cap of $14.2 billion and a tidy 2.81% dividend yield on offer for investors.</p>
