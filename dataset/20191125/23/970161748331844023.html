      <p>Arnold Schwarzenegger was the epitome of kindness yesterday as he gave out free turkeys for Thanksgiving.</p>
      <p>The former Governor of California was spotted handing out the birds in LA ahead of the holiday on 28 November.</p>
      <p>The Austrian-born actor – who achieved super stardom with the Terminator and Predator films – chose Hollenbeck Youth Center as the location for his surprise act of generosity.</p>
      <p>As you can see from the pictures, those who stopped by looked pleased as punch to meet a bonafide movie icon – and bagsy some free poultry to boot.</p>
      <p>We’re actually slightly jealous…</p>
      <p>Arnie’s most recent film is of course Terminator: Dark Fate, which saw him return to the blockbuster franchise that made his name.</p>

      <p>Also starring original Terminator actress Linda Hamilton, it opened last month to positive reviews and has so far grossed almost $250 million (£194 million) worldwide.</p>

      <p>As well as his charitable and professional endeavors, Arnold has recently been hitting the headlines for a bike ride he embarked on around his native LA.</p>

      <p>Not just any old bike ride, mind you, but a bike ride with climate change activist and most famous teenager on the planet Greta Thunberg.</p>
      <p>Arnie, 72, shared news of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/05/arnold-schwarzenegger-goes-bike-ride-friend-hero-greta-thunberg-11045477/">his meeting with Greta</a>, 16, on social media on 5 November, calling her his ‘hero’. Again, we’re kind of jealous.</p>
      <p>‘It was fantastic to see my friend and one of my heroes @gretathunberg last week and go on a bike ride around Santa Monica together,’ he enthused of the teen, who also recently hung out with Oscar-winning actor Leonardo DiCaprio.</p>
      <p>‘I was so pumped to introduce her to my daughter Christina,’ added Arnie. ‘Keep inspiring, Greta!’</p>
