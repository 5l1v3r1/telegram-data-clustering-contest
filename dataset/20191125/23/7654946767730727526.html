      <h1>Fired Navy Secretary Spencer defends handling of Gallagher case</h1>

      <p>Former Navy Secretary Richard Spencer, who was <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/24/def-sec-esper-fires-navy-sec-spencer-over-handling-of-seals-review/">fired this weekend</a> for his handling of the Navy SEAL Edward Gallagher case, defended himself Monday in his first interview since his ouster</p>
      <p>Spencer, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/eddie-gallagher-case-fired-navy-secretary-richard-spencer-in-interview-defends-handling-of-navy-seal-case/">speaking to CBS News</a>, said President Trump’s decision to allow Gallagher to retire as a Navy SEAL and keep his SEAL “Trident pin” sends the message to troops that they “can get away with things.”</p>
      <p>“What message does it send?” reporter David Martin asked Spencer about Trump’s decision to allow him to keep his Navy SEAL pin.</p>
      <p>“That you can get away with things,” Spencer responded.</p>
      <p>“We have to have good order and discipline. It’s the backbone of what we do, and the Trident review process with the senior enlisted reviewing fellow senior enlisted is critical,” Spencer added.</p>
      <p>“The senior enlisted of our military are the backbone of our military. They are the girder of good order and discipline. They can handle this, they can handle this in each one of their communities,” Spencer said.</p>
      <p>Gallagher, 40, was demoted this summer when he was convicted of posing next to the corpse of a slain ISIS fighter.</p>
      <p>He was acquitted of more serious charges, including murder.</p>
      <p>Last week, Trump announced he would <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/15/trump-pardons-2-ex-military-officers-promotes-navy-seal-eddie-gallagher/">restore Gallagher’s rank</a> — and the Navy responded by beginning a review process of Gallagher’s Trident pin.</p>
      <p>Trump intervened, and <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/25/trump-ordered-that-disgraced-navy-seal-eddie-gallagher-keep-his-trident-insignia/">ordered the Navy</a> that he will retain the pin.</p>
