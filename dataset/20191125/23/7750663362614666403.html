      <p>The club are thought to be seriously considering the future of <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/marco-silva/"><b>Marco Silva</b></a> following the club's <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/everton/sack-race/result/result-norwich-see-off-everton-to-pile-pressure-on-silva_380362.html">2-0 defeat</a> at home to Norwich City over the weekend.</p>
      <p>It is claimed that Moyes and Hughes are the two leading candidates to step into the role at Goodison Park.</p>
      <p>According to <i>The Sun</i>, Moshiri favours the appointment of Hughes, while Kenwright has expressed his determination to bring Moyes back into the fold.</p>
      <p>The Everton owner is said to have been serenaded by agent <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/kia-joorabchian/"><b>Kia Joorabchian</b></a>, who represents Hughes as well as Everton players <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/bernard/"><b>Bernard</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/richarlison/"><b>Richarlison</b></a>.</p>
      <p>Moyes, who has been out of work since 2018, enjoyed a successful period with the Toffees between 2002 and 2013.</p>
