      <h1>Croppa Creek Public School students fly to Sydney for excursion thanks to generous sponsors</h1>

      <p>Croppa Creek students have escaped the dust and heat and will enjoy a few days exploring the big smoke, thanks to some generous sponsors.</p>
      <p>Ten students from years four to six and two teachers flew from Moree to Sydney on Tuesday morning for a three-day excursion which has been made possible thanks to donations from Inland Rail ARTC, Gwydir Shire Council, Croppa Creek P&amp;C committee and Clovelly Public School in Sydney.</p>
      <p>Croppa Creek teacher Michael Sky said the excursion wouldn't have happened without this support.</p>
      <p>"We weren't planning on going," he said.</p>
      <p>"Clovelly Public School had raised money for us, so we thought we'd try to go on an excursion.</p>
      <p>"Their principal Matthew Jackman used to be the Croppa Creek principal. He came back to visit and saw the extent of the drought and wanted to do something to help his old school."</p>

      <p>The school raised money through the fiver for a farmer initiative, which will go towards the cost of Opal cards and some of the activities the students will do in Sydney.</p>
      <p>The Croppa Creek students will also be staying with some of the Clovelly families, so they don't have to pay for accommodation during their trip.</p>

      <p>The ARTC contributed $4000 towards the excursion and handed out bags with drink bottles and hats to the students before they flew out.</p>
      <p>Mr Sky said it means a lot for these students to be able to get away for a few days.</p>
      <p>"Some of these guys have never been on a plane before or to Sydney, so it's a massive experience for them," he said.</p>
      <p>"Out at Croppa Creek it's a bit like living in a bubble, so this is an opportunity to open their eyes and see what's our there. It's also a chance for them to get away from the drought. Rain is forecast in Sydney while we're there, so some proper rain will be nice to see."</p>
      <p>During the three days in Sydney, students will visit the Powerhouse Museum, Taronga Zoo, Parliament House, Centrepoint Tower and the Museum of Contemporary Art, before returning on Thursday.</p>
