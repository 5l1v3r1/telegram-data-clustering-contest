      <h1>T.I. breaks silence over making daughter take 'virginity test' after furious backlash</h1>
      <h2>The musician and actor, real name Cliffford Harris, sparked controversy when he said he accompanies 18-year-old Deyjah to the gynaecologist and asks her to sign a form so the doctor can give him her personal information</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T23:10:12+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 23:10</time> by <a rel="author">James Rodger, https://www.facebook.com/jamesrodgerjournalist</a></address>
      <p>T.I. has claimed he "exaggerated" when he said he goes with his daughter to the doctor for checks on her hymen to make sure she is a virgin, adding his intentions have been "terribly misconstrued and misconceived".</p>
      <p>The musician and actor, real name Cliffford Harris, sparked controversy when he said he accompanies 18-year-old Deyjah to the gynaecologist and asks her to sign a form so the doctor can give him her personal information.</p>
      <p>Appearing on Jada Pinkett Smith's chat show Red Table Talk on Facebook Watch, he said: "From a place of truth I began to embellish and exaggerate.</p>
      <p>"I think a lot of people took it extremely literal, because if you put any of my reputation, who I am as a father, who I've been, I honestly thought people knew me better than that."</p>

      <p>Asked if he understood the sensitivity around his comments, he said: "I did not. I understand it now. However I think my intentions have been terribly misconstrued and misconceived.</p>
      <p>"Let me go set this record straight. I never said I was in any exam room, that is an assumption, that is a falsity, I never said it was being done present day as an 18-year-old."</p>

      <p>His wife Tiny Harris, who is not Deyjah's mother, clarified the teenager was 15 or 16 at the time.</p>
      <p>T.I. added: "I never said that her mother wasn't present. Her mother was there. This false narrative has just been sensationalised.</p>
      <p>"There was never any objection. She did have a problem with me talking about it, however, and I understand that and I am incredibly apologetic to her for that, not to any of these other strangers or any of these weirdos who toss lies around for fun.</p>
      <p>"She knows my intentions, she knows who I am and she knows who I've always been and I think that allows a certain level of understanding.</p>
      <p>"Outside, the noise is distracting, confusing, it's hurtful and embarrassing."</p>
      <p>The rapper added that he has been trying to protect his daughter, saying: "In the age or the time when our women, black women, are the most unprotected, unattended, disregarded women on the planet, I am being criticised because I am willing to go above and beyond to protect mine.</p>
      <p>"I'm talking about all of the little slimy, grimy, chubby-fingered little boys who want to just come in and defile and destroy the sanctity that I have... I don't understand anything that is the most important thing to me in my life, I am going to deal with that with very extreme care, and I don't understand how that is looked at as being so wrong.</p>
      <p>"For there to be malice there must be ill-intent. If I'm going to the doctor with you for the sake of controlling you then OK, but if I'm going for the purpose of being a protective parent, and there is no such thing as over-protective, there is protected and unprotected.</p>
      <p>"I am here to protect all of the children from themselves, until they make it to a point where they have awareness, a sense of self, and discernment, to be able to make certain decisions on their own that will impact their lives indefinitely.</p>
      <p>"I'm not there necessarily to protect virginity, I just know that is a big move, once you make that move there are thing that happen that follow, you have to be equipped and I don't know if you're equipped.</p>
      <p>"Awareness is my first line of defence."</p>
