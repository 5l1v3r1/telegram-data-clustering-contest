      <p>He only stopped briefly to pick up a bra launched towards him by a fan.</p>
      <p>He told the Glasgow crowd: “Are you ready to lose your mind Glasgow?</p>
      <p>"Or have you already lost it?”</p>
      <p>He added: ““You can look like whatever you want to look like, you can love whoever you want to love, and you can identify however you want to identify.</p>
      <p>“No one can f***ing touch us.</p>
      <p>He followed on from support band Saint Phnx, comprised of brothers Stevie and Alan Jukes from Wishaw.</p>
      <p>They soared through their set while the crowd echoed the band’s infectious energy in true Glasgow style.</p>
      <h3>SET LIST</h3>

      <p>Yungblud’s latest EP, the Underrated Youth, came out in October this year.</p>
      <p>He is a figurehead for his own pop-punk protest movement.</p>
      <p>And as the adoring crowd screamed Kill Somebody along with him as he took centre stage in a mosh pit, there was a tangible feeling of love, defiant rage, and above all, hope.</p>
      <p>He reappeared on the stage in a black mini skirt and an acoustic guitar before belting out Casual Sabotage - an anthem for the “freaks” and the “rejects”.</p>
      <p>And he finished his encore with every hand in the air as Glasgow sang: “There’s hope for the underrated youth”.</p>
