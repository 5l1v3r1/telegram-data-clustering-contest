        <b>I’m A Celebrity host <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/ant-mcpartlin/">Ant McPartlin</a> gave viewers an unexpected eyeful during tonight’s episode as he cheekily adjusted his ‘care package’ live on-air.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ant, 44, and his sidekick <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/declan-donnelly/">Declan Donnelly</a> were giving their commentary after the campmates carried out their latest Bushtucker trial, which saw them abseiling down the side of a cliff in an attempt to win care packages.</p>
      <p>For the male campmates likes Myles Stephensons and Andy Whyment, it was a particularly tricky challenge to navigate in regards to their manhood and Ant just couldn’t resist a cheeky joke.</p>
      <p>‘I thought Andy and Myles did a great job too although those packages took quite a bashing on the way down,’ the TV host observed.</p>
      <p>Dec chimed in: ‘The harnesses were very tight.’</p>
      <p>Poor fellas.</p>
      <p>As he introduced the next segment, Ant began hoisting up his trousers prompting Dec to ask what was on all of our minds.</p>

      <p>‘What are you doing there?’ he enquired to which Ant replied: ‘Just adjusting the old care package.’</p>

      <p>And the words of Phoebe from Friends echoed in all our ears: ‘My eyes. MY EYES.’</p>
      <p>Reacting to Ant’s cheeky quip, one ITV viewer tweeted: ‘I’m distracted by Ant’s care package,’ although we’re not sure if they were horrified or entertained.</p>
      <p>Another advised: ‘Ant I’d be carful sorting your care package on live television.’</p>
      <p>One viewer shared a meme of them spitting out their drink and, frankly, the other tweets are just too NSFW for publication.</p>
      <p>The campmates were abseiling in a bid to win their special packages from home and Emmerdale actor Andy, Kate Garraway, Nadine Coyle and Rak-Su singer Myles were able to successfully grab hold of their parcels meaning all 12 campmates would receive their care packages.</p>
