      <p><a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Janhvi-Kapoor">Janhvi Kapoor</a> marked her debut in <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Shashank-Khaitan">Shashank Khaitan</a>'s 'Dhadak' co-starring <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Ishaan-Khatter">Ishaan Khatter</a> in 2018. She received appreciation and love from the audience for her performance in the film. And now, she has several films lined up ahead.</p>
      <p>The actress often gets snapped in the city post her workout sessions and on various occasions. On Monday, the young starlet visited her brother <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Arjun-Kapoor">Arjun Kapoor</a>'s house and was clicked while leaving the same. For the night, she opted for a sky blue shirt teamed with denim shorts and flip flops. The actress looked beautiful as she left her hair open as she stepped out for the same.</p>
