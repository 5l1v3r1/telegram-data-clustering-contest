      <p>Former Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) strawweight contender Pearl Gonzalez, who currently competes under the Invicta FC banner, returned to the grappling circuit last weekend inside Foro Cintermex Nave Lewis in Monterrey, Mexico.</p>
      <p>Where she promptly broke her opponent’s arm.</p>
      <p>The tournament, which aired on the UFC Fight Pass digital network, featured a middleweight tournament won by jiu-jitsu ace Dan Martinez, who heel-hooked UFC veteran Jesse Taylor just 24 seconds into their final bout.</p>
      <p>For those of you unfamiliar with Combat Jiu-Jitsu, <a href="https://mymmanews.com/combat-jiu-jitsu-worlds-the-middleweights-live-results/">Laura Kent</a> has a pretty solid breakdown:</p>
      <blockquote>The combat jiu jitsu ruleset allows for open hand palm strikes once the action hits the ground. There is also a “get down” rule if the match does not hit the ground for a full minute, which requires the competitors to get down on the mat and start from there to allow for the palm strikes.</blockquote>
      <p>Gonzalez, 33, parted ways with UFC after suffering back-to-back losses to Cynthia Calvillo and Poliana Botelho, but “Chi-Town Princess” has since racked up a 4-1 record for Invicta FC, including last month’s unanimous decision win over Brogan Walker-Sanchez in Kansas City.</p>
