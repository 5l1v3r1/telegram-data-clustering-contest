      <h1>Google Play Pass picks up 37 Android apps and games following launch</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T21:25:07+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 21:25</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5google.com/author/technacity/" target="_blank">Abner Li</a></address>
      <p>Play Pass <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/09/23/google-play-pass-launch/">rolled out</a> last month as a subscription service that “unlocks” hundreds of Android apps and games for a monthly fee. Since launch, Google has added 37 more titles to the collection.</p>
      <p>The vast majority of newly added applications are free and skew toward gaming content, but there’s also a podcast player, budgeting, drawing, and journaling app. In case of free titles, Play Pass unlocks all in-app purchases and removes advertising for a premium experience.</p>
      <p>Paid games highlighted by Google today include <i>Cytus II</i> ($1.99), <i>Sally’s Law</i> ($1.99), and <i>Traffix</i> ($4.49), while one pirate-themed title normally costs $13.99.</p>
      <p>Play Pass launched with over 350 apps and Google noted that more are coming every month. The service is currently invite-only for developers and touted as offering a “high-quality, curated collection.” It costs $4.99 per month with a 10-day free trial. The subscription integrates with Google Play Family Sharing so it can be shared with up to five other family members.</p>
