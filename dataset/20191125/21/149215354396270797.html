      <p>The White House over the course of several hours has provided numerous different accounts of the gender of a dog President Trump praised as a "tough cookie." Just another normal one in Washington.</p>
      <p>Trump honored Conan, the military dog who chased down Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in a raid last month, at the White House Monday, referring to the very good pup as a "he." But pool reporter Hunter Walker provided the very important update that actually, according to a White House official, Conan is a female dog.</p>

      <p>The story, believe it or not, would not end there, with Walker hours later issuing <i>another</i> update citing a White House official as saying Conan is a male dog after all.

      <p>"I can't believe I've spent so much of my day trying to confirm the gender of a canine," <a href="https://twitter.com/kathrynw5/status/1199067299166248961">CBS News' Kathryn Watson wrote</a>, while <a href="https://twitter.com/Kyle_Feldscher/status/1199069173466439680">CNN's Kyle Feldscher observed</a>, "this 'no one knows if Conan The Hero Dog is a boy or girl dog' story is easily one of the most absurd things to happen in Washington in the last 4 or 5 hours."</p>
