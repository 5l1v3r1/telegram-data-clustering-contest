      <p><b>Agilent</b> (NYSE:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/a-stock-quote/"><b><u>A</u></b></a>) earnings for the research, development and manufacturing company’s <a href="https://www.investor.agilent.com/news-and-events/news/news-details/2019/Agilent-Technologies-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2019-Financial-Results/default.aspx">fiscal fourth quarter of 2019</a> have A stock down on Monday. That’s in spite of its adjusted per-share earnings of 89 cents and revenue of $1.37 billion. These are both better than Wall Street’s estimates of 85 cents per share and $1.33 billion.</p>

      <p>Here’s what else is worth mentioning from the current Agilent earnings report.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Adjusted EPS for the quarter is up 4.94% YoY compared to 81 cents.</li>
        <li>Revenue is sitting 6.20% higher than the $1.29 billion reported during the same period of the year prior.</li>
        <li>Operating income for the quarter comes in at $250 million.</li>
        <li>That’s a 2.46% increase over operating income of $244 million in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2018.</li>
        <li>The Agilent earnings report also includes a net income of $194 million.</li>
        <li>This is a slight drop from its net income of $195 million reported during the same time last year.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Mike McMullen, President and CEO of Agilent, has this to say about the A stock earnings.</p>
      <blockquote>“Agilent’s fourth-quarter results cap off a very solid 2019 and reflect the broad-based business we’ve built over the last five years. Based on what we’ve been able to achieve in 2019, I’m convinced we’re in an exceptionally strong position for the future.”</blockquote>
      <p>Despite McMullen’s positive disposition, Agilent earnings contain a poor outlook for fiscal 2020. The company expects adjusted earnings per share of $3.38 to $3.43 on revenue of $5.50 billion to $5.55 billion. That doesn’t compare well next to Wall Street’s estimates of $3.44 per share and $5.55 billion.</p>
      <p>A stock was down 2.94% after markets closed on Monday. The stock finished the day up 1.44%.</p>
