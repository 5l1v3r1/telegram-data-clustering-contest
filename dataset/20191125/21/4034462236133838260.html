      <h1>Cadillac May Give Subscription Program Another Go</h1>
      <h2>It wasn't very popular last time.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T21:40:32+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 21:40</time> by <a rel="author">Jared Rosenholtz</a></address>
      <p>Subscription services have not yet reached universal awareness but more automakers are experimenting with these programs. We believe they offer benefits over traditional buying or leasing. For example, programs like<a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/porsche-will-now-let-you-drive-any-of-its-cars-for-3-000-a-month"> Porsche Passport</a> allow subscribers to swap in and out of cars within the brand - so you can have an SUV during the week to take the kids to school and a convertible on the weekend to have some fun.</p>
      <p>The Book by Cadillac program worked in the same way, meaning you could theoretically borrow an <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/cadillac/xt6">XT6</a> during the week, then switch to a <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/cadillac/ct6-v">CT6-V</a> for the weekend. The trouble is, Book by Cadillac subscribers did <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/cadillac-s-revolutionary-lease-program-might-be-a-huge-failure">not receive any answers</a> when they attempted to sign up because there weren't enough cars to go around. In late 2018, <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/is-cadillac-s-subscription-service-already-dead">Cadillac ended the service</a> soon after it began. But early this year, rumors emerged of Book by Cadillac's return and according to <a href="https://www.autonews.com/retail/cadillac-subscription-service-return-february">Automotive News</a>, it's finally happening.</p>

      <p>Speaking at the J.D. Power/NADA AutoConference in Los Angeles, General Motors chief marketing officer, Deborah Wahl said the first dealerships will relaunch a pilot version of Book by Cadillac. She didn't go into much details about the revamped program but said it will offer "convenience, flexibility, and value for potential subscribers." Earlier this year, Wahl said the program would function better if it was more well-integrated with the dealer network.</p>
      <p>Dublin Cadillac in California has been chosen to be the first pilot dealership for the new program. Speaking to Auto News earlier this year, Wahl said, "we do still see a lot of interest from consumers in finding different ownership models, but the right price, value, how we do that, how we bundle those services is what we're working on."</p>

      <p>Wahl didn't mention pricing but we know Book by Cadillac launched with a $1,800 monthly fee (including insurance and maintenance) that allowed subscribers to swap in and out of vehicles with no commitment. $1,800 is significantly more than most people spend on their monthly car payment, so perhaps the luxury of being able to swap out cars isn't worth it to some shoppers. "There's really no one-size-fits-all solution for personal transportation," Wahl said.</p>
