      <h1>Indianapolis Colts Release Injury Update For RB Marlon Mack</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T21:45:11+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 21:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/alekarend" target="_blank">Alek Arend</a></address>
      <p>The AFC South is shaping up to be one of the most hotly contested division battles in the NFL this season. The Colts and Titans are each 6-5 and just one game behind the Texans for the division lead.</p>
      <p>Indianapolis hosts the Titans on Sunday in a pivotal division contest. According to the <a href="https://twitter.com/AdamSchefter/status/1199075460111618048">latest report</a> from ESPN’s Adam Schefter, the Colts will once again be without running back Marlon Mack.</p>
      <p>Mack missed Thursday’s game with an injury and will be out again this week, Schefter tweeted earlier today.</p>

      <p>This will be Mack’s second straight missed game. He suffered a hand injury in Week 11 against the Jaguars – an injury which required subsequent surgery.</p>
      <p>Jonathan Williams is expected to replace Mack in the starting lineup for the second straight week. The backup running back had 104 yards on 26 carries against the Texans on Thursday Night Football last week.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, it wasn’t enough for the Colts as they fell 20-17 to Houston – giving the Texans the AFC South Division lead in the process. Indianapolis would love to have Mack return as soon as possible. But as long as Williams keeps running the ball like he did last Thursday, Mack’s return won’t be rushed.</p>
      <p>Colts- Titans kicks off this Sunday at 1 p.m. ET on CBS.</p>
