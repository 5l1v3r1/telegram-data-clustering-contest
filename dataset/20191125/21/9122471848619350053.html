      <h1>The TV Ratings For Cowboys-Patriots Game Are Massive</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T21:05:44+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 21:05</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matthladik" target="_blank">Matt Hladik</a></address>
      <p>The Dallas Cowboys and New England Patriots are teams that are both widely loved and hated. No matter how you may feel about them, people watch them.</p>
      <p>Lots of people, in fact. The television numbers are in for yesterday’s Cowboys-Patriots game on FOX and they are huge.</p>
      <p>The game earned a 19.5/40 metered market rating, FOX’s best for a regular season broadcast since 1996. It was also the best rating for a regular season broadcast from any network in 12 years.</p>
      <p>Naturally, the Boston and Dallas markets tuned in in droves. But other markets made their presence felt as well, like Seattle, Cleveland and Philadelphia.</p>

      <p>The game itself wasn’t even that great, with the Patriots winning 13-9 thanks to good defense, bad weather and some questionable game management by Jason Garrett.</p>
      <p>Oh, and the <a href="https://thespun.com/more/top-stories/cowboys-patriots-tripping-penalty-call-video">officiating didn’t hurt </a>either.</p>
      <p>We won’t see these two teams again in the regular season until 2023, though there is always the chance they meet in the Super Bowl before then.</p>
