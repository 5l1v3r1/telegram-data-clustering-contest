      <p>What do Americans think about impeachment? Do they think President Trump acted inappropriately? And how strongly do they hold their views?</p>
      <p>FiveThirtyEight partnered with <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/538-impeachment-tracker-2019">Ipsos</a> to see how people’s opinions change over the course of the inquiry. Here are the results of our first FiveThirtyEight/Ipsos poll on impeachment, conducted using Ipsos’s KnowledgePanel. We’ll be checking in with these same Americans again in the coming weeks to see how their views on impeachment shift.</p>
