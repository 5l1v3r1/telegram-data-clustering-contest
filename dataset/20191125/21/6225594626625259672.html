      <h1>The YouTube Masthead Is Now Available On TV Screens For All Advertisers Globally</h1>

        <b>Google has announced that all advertisers globally can now buy the YouTube Masthead on a CPM basis, as a seamless cross-screen buy or only on TV Screens.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Back in September Google <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/ads/full-funnel-video/">announced</a> an open beta test bringing the <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/ads/masthead-on-tv-screens/">YouTube Masthead to TV Screens</a> in addition to mobile and desktop placements.</p>
      <p>Following the success of the test in some select markets, all advertisers <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/9639395?hl=en">will now</a> be able to run their ads on mobile, desktop, and TV Screens – as part of a seamless cross-screen buy – or choose to run them only on TV Screens.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, advertisers will be able to do so <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/2375464#masthead-ads">on a CPM basis</a> as well as CPD. This development is particularly important since the YouTube Masthead on TV screens has the potential to drive a lot of awareness for advertisers with the “rich audio and visual experience” it offers – especially when combined with the home placement.</p>
      <p>Broadcaster FOX has been testing the Masthead on TV screens during the last month to drive awareness for The Masked Singer hit show.</p>

      <p>Natalie Park, VP of Media at the company commented that “This first-of-its-kind initiative reaches viewers where they live, right at their point of viewing, and with YouTube’s scale, it’s the perfect partnership and a fantastic way to promote our #1 show.”</p>
