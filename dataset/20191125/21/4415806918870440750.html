      <p>Four men have been arrested after what gardaí are describing as a "serious public order incident" at a halting site in Co Kildare.</p>
      <p>The men, in their 20s and 30s were arrested today after an incident on Saturday which left a man in his 50s injured and his 4x4 badly damaged.</p>
