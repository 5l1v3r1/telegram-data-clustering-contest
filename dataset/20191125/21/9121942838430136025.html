      <p>GEORGE TOWN, Cayman Islands – The Washington State men’s basketball team had a solid start, but Nebraska outscored the Cougars by 14 points in the second half of an 82-71 victory Monday in a Cayman Islands Classic game.</p>
      <p>Sophomore CJ Elleby, a graduate of Cleveland High School in Seattle, matched his career high with 27 points for WSU (2-3) and teammate Isaac Bonton had 17 points.</p>
      <p>Elleby has scored 27 points three times this season and has scored at least 20 four times. He made 9 of 21 shots from the field and all seven of his free throws.</p>
      <p>WSU will face Old Dominion at 2 p.m. PT Tuesday in consolation play.</p>
      <p>Nebraska’s accurate shooting was the difference.</p>
      <p>The Cornhuskers (3-2) made 52.6% of their shots from the field, including 50% of their three-pointers (9 of 18).</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the Cougars shot 37% percent overall and made a mere 22.2% (6 of 27) of their three-point attempts.</p>
      <p>Both teams had identical shooting stats in the first half, making 14 of 32 for 43.8% accuracy.</p>
      <p>But in the second half, Nebraska connected on a sizzling 64% (16 of 25) and the Cougars cooled to 31.7% (13 of 41).</p>
      <p>WSU fared better in some other statistical categories. The Cougars made fewer turnovers (17 to 19) and grabbed more rebounds (44-41). They were especially effective on the offensive boards, getting 20 second-chance points, compared with four for Nebraska.</p>
      <p>Jaylen Shead led WSU in rebounds (eight) and assists (four) after returning from an injury that held him out of a loss to Omaha last week.</p>
      <p>Haanif Cheatham scored 19 points and Jervay Green added 14 to lead the Cornhuskers. They combined for 26 points in the second half.</p>
      <p>Dachon Burke and Kevin Cross added 14 points apiece and Cam Mack had 10 with eight rebounds, six assists and three steals for Nebraska.</p>
      <p>The teams met for the first time since the 1998 Top of the World Classic in Fairbanks, Alaska, on a 9-degree day. Temperature at tipoff Monday was 80 degrees.</p>
      <p>Nebraska went on a couple of 13-2 runs in the second half. The first started barely two minutes in and erased a four-point deficit. Green, who had eight points during the surge, started it with two free throws and followed with three-pointer to put the Cornhuskers on top 41-40. He had another three during the run, which ended with 13:47 to go and Nebraska up 49-42. During that span, the Cougars went 1 for 8 with three turnovers.</p>
      <p>WSU trailed by five points when the next run began. Cheatham led the way with six points. In that 3½-minute stretch, WSU shot 1 for 8.</p>
