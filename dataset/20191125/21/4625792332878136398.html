      <h1>'No reason why these young people should not have a say': Town approves lowering voting age to 16</h1>

      <p>The town of Brookline, Massachusetts, is looking for state approval to lower the voting age for municipal elections to 16 after the measure was passed at a town meeting.</p>
      <p>The decision was approved 142-71 last week, <a href="https://boston.cbslocal.com/2019/11/22/voting-age-brookline-vote-approve-house-rule-petition/">according</a> to CBS Boston. If the state grants approval, 16- and 17-year-olds would be eligible to become town meeting members and to register to vote in local elections.</p>
      <p>“These elections directly impact these young people,” said board member Raul Fernandez. “At the age of 16, they can start working and paying taxes on that work.”</p>
      <p>He added, “There’s no reason why these young people should not have a say in our politics, and actually giving them a say in our politics will make us even better.”</p>
      <p>Others in the town of about 60,000 expressed disapproval with the decision. Some argued that the brains of 16-year-olds are not developed enough to make important decisions on electoral issues.</p>
      <p>“Voting is an adult responsibility, and childhood is short enough,” <a href="https://patch.com/massachusetts/brookline/brookline-votes-lower-voting-age-16">said</a> town meeting member Linda Roseman.</p>
      <p>The town will have to wait on a Home Rule Petition to be approved by the Statehouse. The petition allows smaller municipalities to enforce new rules under state law.</p>
