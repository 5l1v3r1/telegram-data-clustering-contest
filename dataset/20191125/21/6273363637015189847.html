      <p>The kid-friendly multiplayer platform game has had 290 million downloads on mobile. About $677 million of its revenue, or 67%, has come from the U.S., while Great Britain is No. 2 with $89 million, or 9%.</p>
      <p>The Google Play store has been the source of most of the downloads, about 75% of them. Apple devices are making most of the revenue, however, accounting for 76% of it.</p>
      <p>Most impressively, Roblox on mobile keeps growing.</p>
