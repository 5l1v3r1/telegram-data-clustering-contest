      <p>A 36-year-old man died after he allegedly rammed the sedan car he was driving into a tree in South West Delhi Monday morning. The incident took place around 1.10 am outside Devam farmhouse on Dwarka Link Road.</p>
      <p>The victim, Dwarka resident Apurv Pandey, was returning home in his Honda City after attending a function from NH8, said police. “Prima facie it appears that Pandey was speeding,” said a police officer. DCP (South West) Devender Arya said, “A PCR call was received at 1.29 am about fire in a car and when a police team reached there, it was found that a car had collided into a tree and had caught fire.”</p>
      <p>Irshad Khan (55), a guard on duty outside the farmhouse, told <a href="https://indianexpress.com/">The Indian Express</a>, “From a distance, I saw a speeding car hit the tree. A few of us rushed there and took the driver out… Suddenly the car caught fire.” Pandey was rushed to Venkateshwar hospital, where he declared dead on arrival.</p>
      <p>“His body was handed over to the family after post-mortem at DDU,” said Arya.</p>
      <p>Pandey held a private job and is survived by his parents and an elder brother who lives in Mumbai.</p>
      <p>A case under IPC sections 279 and 304 has been filed. Police said the cause of the accident is yet to be ascertained.</p>
