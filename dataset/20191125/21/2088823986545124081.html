      <p>Canisius College athletic director Bill Maher can’t say yet if there will be another Canisius-St. Bonaventure men’s basketball game next season at KeyBank Center.</p>
      <p>But after the Golden Griffins defeated the Bonnies 61-57 on Saturday at the downtown arena, Maher said he wants the venue to continue to host college basketball. Maher also said discussions about the future of college basketball at KeyBank Center have already started between the Big 4’s athletic directors and Pegula Sports and Entertainment.</p>
      <p>“We want to try and find a way for it to work, for everybody to do it in 2020,” Maher said.</p>
      <p>More than 3,800 people attended the doubleheader on Saturday at KeyBank Center. Division II Daemen College defeated Wilmington 83-81 in the first game, and the Golden Griffins defeated the Bonnies in the second half of the doubleheader, the first college basketball games played at a downtown venue since December of 2016.</p>
      <p>Pegula Sports and Entertainment said in a statement to The News that it is open to continuing to host local college basketball games at KeyBank Center.</p>
      <p>“We are proud to support our local programs and are always willing to work together with them to create a good experience for players and fans at KeyBank Center,” Ron Raccuia, Pegula Sports and Entertainment executive vice president, said in a statement. “In addition to local teams, the NCAA basketball tournament has been extremely popular at KeyBank Center and we look forward to welcoming it back in 2022.”</p>
      <p>Bona athletic director Tim Kenney said the program would be interested in returning to KeyBank for future basketball events, whether it’s a Canisius-Bona game or a potential doubleheader.</p>
      <p>Kenney offered some direction for the future of the event.</p>
      <p>“It’s finding a group of people who are not just in the schools who want to make this work,” Kenney said. “Do you have a doubleheader? Is it sponsored by someone? That can help underwrite arena costs. But it’s also about having a group of people in Buffalo that love the Big 4 and basketball, getting them together as a group, and really helping push this event to make it a must-do event.</p>
      <p>“I don’t have those answers right now, because it’s still so new to unpack, but we want to look at this and say, ‘This is a good start. How can we make this bigger?’ The Pegulas will be a huge part of this, and they were great in working with Canisius on the logistics. It’s something that, it will happen, if everyone wants it to happen.”</p>
      <p>Daemen coach Mike MacDonald also made a pitch for future basketball events at KeyBank.</p>
      <p>“Basketball is in the city’s fabric, for a lot of people,” MacDonald said. “I even said I think they should try and expand it. Make it a quadruple-header. Play a Division III game, a Division II game and two Division I games. Try to make it a full day of basketball, just like they do for the NCAA tournament.”</p>
      <p>When athletic directors from Canisius, the University at Buffalo, Niagara and St. Bonaventure met with The News in August, they said they were exploring the possibility of making games against Big 4 opponents a mainstay of their nonconference basketball schedules, but that there wasn’t the same urgency to revive Big 4 doubleheaders at KeyBank Center. But Maher considered a few ideas – including MacDonald’s pitch – as to what could constitute future college basketball events at KeyBank Center.</p>
      <p>“We’ve talked about playing three games, and I’d be all for it,” Maher said. “Whatever can help us build basketball in Buffalo, bring people downtown and have two great experiences, like the kids from Daemen had and the kids from our team had ... those are what we want to try and provide and build.</p>
      <p>“Three and four games, it’s been done, but it’s hard to do, just logistically to play that many games in a day, but it’s been done. We do it in our conference tournament all the time.”</p>
      <p>Maher didn’t project what the long-term future of Big 4 basketball at KeyBank Center will be, but said Canisius is committed to continuing to build a basketball event at the downtown venue.</p>
      <p>“Whether it be a game like we did, partnering with Daemen, or doing it with the Big 4 schools because the four ADs have had considerable discussion about it, I think there’s a willingness to try and find a way to make it work,” Maher said.</p>
