      <p>The Conservatives’manifesto has been widely interpreted as a ‘low risk’ election pitch which aims to minimise controversy before December 12.</p>
      <p>But despite the muted reaction to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/24/boris-johnson-vows-corbyn-neutral-christmas-tory-manifesto-speech-11209742/">yesterday’s launch</a> – and the comparatively low level of spending pledges compared to Labour’s plans, a number of Tory policies aside from ‘getting <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/brexit/">Brexit</a> done’ have attracted attention.</p>
      <p>As well as leaving the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/european-union/">European Union</a> by December 2020, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/boris-johnson/">Boris Johnson</a>’s party says it will increase the number of nurses in England and be carbon neutral by 2050.</p>
      <p>The Prime Minister also promised to back a ‘Northern Powerhouse rail plan’and a spending boost for the NHS.</p>
      <p>But there were a number of other eye-catching policies that you might have missed – here are some of them.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b> Tampon tax abolished</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson’s party have pledged to abolish the tampon tax – a 5% ‘luxury’ charge on an essential good, which has long outraged women’s groups.</p>
      <p>The move is expected to cost around £15 million a year.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b> Human rights act ‘update’</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Tories say they will change the Human Right Act to better ‘balance’ individual rights, national security and effective government.</p>
      <p>Within a year of returning to power, the party says it would set up a commission to look at how the act can be used most effectively in depth.</p>
      <p>Conservative leaders have previously called for the act to be overturned and replaced by a ‘British Bill of Rights’.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b> Cancer drugs fund</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Tories will extend the Cancer Drugs Fund – which allows early access to new treatments – to various other illnesses.</p>
      <p>A new ‘Innovative Medicines Fund’ will allow doctors to ‘use the most advanced, life-saving treatments for conditions such as cancer or autoimmune disease, or for children with other rare diseases’, the party says.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b> More tasers and body cams for police</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>In a bid to cut crime, Mr Johnson’s party would equip more police with tasers and body cameras.</p>
      <p>The Conservatives say this will help keep the public and police officers safe.</p>
      <p>The PM is keen to show that he is being tough on knife crime – and his plan would ’empower officers with court orders’ so that they can target known knife carriers through stop and search.</p>

      <p>The Conservatives say they will invest £640 million in a new ‘Nature for Climate’ fund which would see the creation of a ‘Great Northumberland Forest’.</p>
      <p>The party hopes to create an additional 75,000 acres of trees a year by the end of the next Parliament and ‘expects’ all new streets to be tree-lined.</p>
      <p>As part of its plans to make Britain carbon neutral by 2050, the party say it will also establish a £500 million ‘Blue Planet Fund’ to ‘protect oceans from plastic pollution, warming sea temperatures and overfishing’.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Voters will have to show ID</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Tories say they are trying to reduce election fraud by making voters show identification at polling stations.</p>
      <p>They also aim to ‘stop postal vote harvesting’ and reduce foreign interference in election, though there is limited detail on what this would mean in practice.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Electric vehicle charging network</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>An investment of £1 billion is being promised for completing a ‘fast-charging network’, which would ‘ensure’ that everyone is within 30 miles of a rapid charging station for electric vehicles.</p>
      <p>The party says the initiative would be prioritised in the first budget after the election.</p>
      <p>It also aims to set the earliest date possible to phase out the sale of petrol and diesel cars, after previously considering 2035 as a possible cut off point.</p>

          <b>NHS ‘not for sale’ </b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Amid Labour attacks on the Tories suggesting that the NHS could be part of a trade deal with President Donald Trump’s USA after Brexit, the Conservatives have tried to make it abundantly clear that they would not sell the health service.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>The party write: ‘When we are negotiating trade deals, the NHS will not be on the table.</p>
      <p>‘The price the NHS pays for drugs will not be on the table. The services the NHS provides will not be on the table.’</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Domestic abuse plans</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Tories say they will pass the Domestic Abuse Bill if they win a majority and increase support for refuges and victims of rape and sexual abuse.</p>
      <p>The party also plan to pilot ‘integrated domestic abuse courts that address criminal and family matters in parallel’.</p>
      <p>A cash injection of £15 million to support rape victims has already been announced – doubling the current funding for the Rape and Sexual Abuse Support Fund and more Independent Sexual Violence Advisors.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Fox hunting</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>This one is not in the manifesto – but is noteable in its absence.</p>
      <p>The Conservatives have long promised MPs a free vote on repealing the fox hunting ban.</p>
      <p>Instead, this time round the party says simply that it will make ‘no change’ to the current act – which could alienate some rural voters, but will please animal rights groups.</p>
