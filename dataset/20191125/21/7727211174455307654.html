      <h1>ITV Coronation Street fans disturbed by 'devil child' Hope Stape</h1>
      <h2>"It is worrying to say the least."</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T21:04:50+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 21:04</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/rebecca-koncienzcy/" target="_blank">Rebecca Koncienzcy</a></address>
      <p>Soap fans were left disturbed this evening as <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/coronation-street">Coronation Street's</a> Hope Stape's face lit up with delight as a fire broke out in her back garden.</p>
      <p>Hope's spiralling behaviour has become a huge cause for concern for mum Fiz Stape, played by, Jennie McAlpine, and Tyrone Dobbs, played by Alan Halsall.</p>
      <p>But on <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/itv">ITV</a> tonight it also started to concern viewers as they watched her get eerily excited as a firework party got out of hand and a fire, sending two foot flames into the air, started.</p>
      <p>As the rest of the family backed away in fear, Hope was relishing the flickering flames, almost giddy and fans were shocked.</p>

      <p>One, @moore95_pamela said: " Oh my god. Hope's euphoric reaction to the fire she started is positively disturbing."</p>
      <p>Another, @PunjabAlchemist said: " Hope, Weatherfield's "I'm a fire-starter" devil child."</p>
      <p>A third, @rebeccamason12 said: " I know Fizz is very annoying but is she really that daft? Iâ€™d be seriously concerned if a child was getting pleasure like that from fire-setting."</p>
      <p>A fourth, @DannyFlexen said: " Hope's a firestarter, twisted firestarter."</p>
      <p>And a fifth, @1stLadyHooligan said: " Hope is loving that fire, the happiness on her face seeing it is worrying to say the least."</p>
      <p>But it is not yet clear if Hope started the fire, and as tutor Jade Rowan, played by Lottie Henshall, plots to portray Fiz and Tyrone as unfit parents to social services, this is not going to help.</p>
      <p>And now Fiz is convinced she started the fire and the factory fire and they she is to blame for Hope's behaviour.</p>
      <p>And viewers see Jade telling Hope how "mummy always sees the worst in her", only adding to her horrible plot.</p>
