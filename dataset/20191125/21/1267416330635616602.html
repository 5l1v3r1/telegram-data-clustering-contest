      <h1>Get your weed faster in Toronto with the Ontario Cannabis Store’s same-day delivery</h1>
      <h2>The OCS likely wants to take on popular black market cannabis delivery services</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T21:36:58+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 21:36</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mobilesyrup.com/author/patrickorourke" target="_blank">Patrick O'Rourke</a></address>
      <p>In what is likely an effort to take on the burgeoning black market of marijuana delivery services, the government-owned Ontario Cannabis Store has launched a <a href="https://ocs.ca/blogs/shopping-at-ocs/introducing-same-day-and-next-day-shipping-now-available-in-toronto">same-day delivery pilot program</a>.</p>
      <p>The OCS has reportedly been considering adding same-day delivery as an option since January 2019, when the company first announced it was looking for a courier to handle the expedited service.</p>
      <p>Depending on the shipping location, ‘Same-Day Delivery’ costs $13.75 CAD when an order is placed before 1pm, with ‘Next-Day Delivery’ for $12 when an order is placed before 11:59pm. Same-Day deliveries will arrive between 6:30pm and 10pm, according to the OCS.</p>
      <p>“You will receive a series of text message updates from the delivery agent providing you with a live tracking link and status of the delivery,” reads text on the <a href="https://ocs.ca/blogs/shopping-at-ocs/introducing-same-day-and-next-day-shipping-now-available-in-toronto">OCS’ website</a>. To receive an order, proof that you are 19 years of age is required.</p>
      <p>The OCS says that if the pilot program is successful, same-day delivery will be released across the GTA, with other areas of Ontario being “considered in the future.”</p>
      <p>The OCS’ selection of cannabis is available on the <a href="https://ocs.ca/">crown corporation’s website</a>.</p>
