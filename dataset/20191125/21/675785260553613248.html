      <h1>Inside James Haskell and Chloe Madeley's extreme sex life and racy tricks that keep things hot</h1>
      <h2>I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here's James Haskell and wife Chloe Madeley certainly aren't shy about getting what they want in the bedroom</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T21:30:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 21:30</time> by <a rel="author">Frances Kindon</a></address>
      <p>With his bravery and bulging biceps, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here</a> 's James Haskell is proving to be quite the bushman.</p>
      <p>And he's also a bit of a wild guy in the bedroom, according to his wife, Chloe Madeley, who says their union is cemented by a seriously steamy sex life.</p>
      <p>From role play and daily romps to fantasies and domination, the lusty pair enjoy a magnetic attraction which Chloe admits was the reason their romance ever got off the ground.</p>
      <p>"I'm a really sexual person, and if I had a partner who didn't want to have a very sexual relationship then that would be a problem for me," Chloe previously told Fabulous magazine.</p>

      <p>"I'd struggle in terms of feeling satisfied and loved. So thank God it is massive for James."</p>
      <p>England rugby star James, 34, first approached Chloe on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> with a view to making her the face of one of his workout supplements.</p>
      <p>She refused, and knowing his reputation as a ladies man, she also declined his amorous advances.</p>
      <p>But a green tea-drinking date was followed by a boozy night out and they began hooking up regularly before Chloe told him to commit or cool it.</p>

      <p>He chose the former and they tied the knot at All Saints' Church in Berkshire on December 15, 2018 in front of celebrity guests including Chloe's parents Richard and Judy.</p>
      <p>And like Chloe, James admits sex was the glue that held them together in the early days.</p>
      <p>"Yeah, I don’t think we’d have got past that initial stage if it wasn’t very good. With Chloe it was a key component from the start," he said.</p>
      <p>But marriage has done nothing to dampen their x-rated frisson, with the couple employing a number of raunchy tactics to keep things fresh in the bedroom.</p>
      <p>Like indulging each others' fanatsies to make sure they never have "boring" or "mundane" sex.</p>

        <figcaption>Their early romance was founded on sex</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>"It’s about communication. We talk about everything all the time. 'What do you want, what are you interested in, what are you thinking about?' A relationship can be more sexual and fun if you have those conversations," James said.</p>
      <p>They also do the deed every night apart from a two week hiatus they were forced to take earlier this year while James had a foot injury treated.</p>
      <p>Outside of that, both have said the longest they like to go without is three days, with Chloe admitting, "too long doesn’t agree with me mentally."</p>

      <p>They're also big fans of role play and taking it in turns to be the dominant one.</p>
      <p>But one thing that's off the table is public sex, with Chloe even refusing to do it in the shower for fear of breaking her neck.</p>
      <p>"Sex isn’t about a danger factor for us. There is nothing fun about getting caught having sex, ever," James said.</p>
      <p>Their passion also extends outside of the bedroom, with the couple getting into ferocious rows and splitting up "in excess of a thousand times".</p>

      </figure>
      <p>They even rowed on their engagement trip to Paris and almost split up before James had chance to pop the question.</p>
      <p>"James is a domineering alpha male which is why I’m so attracted to him and why I sometimes hate him. And I’m a mouthy broad who has to be in control all the time," Chloe previously told The Mirror.</p>
      <p>"We must have broken up in excess of a thousand times. We know when it’s really serious ­because we each go eerily quiet.</p>

      <p>"By contrast, when the plates are hitting the wall, we’re just kind of showing off."</p>
      <p>So how are they coping without their daily dose of the good stuff while James is in the jungle?</p>
      <p>Before entering the show, he admitted the grotty environs will probably be enough to kill any trace of horniness.</p>
      <p>"I think I’ll be able to stay calm. When you’re on 700 calories and everything smells of smoke, I’ll be fine. I’ll just throw myself in the creek," he told The Sun.</p>
