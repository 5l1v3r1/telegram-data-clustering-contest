      <p>New Zealand’s <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/bj-watling">BJ Watling</a> wrote his name into the record books during the first Test against <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/team/england-cricket">England</a> at Mount Maunganui. Watling scored 205 from 473 balls with the aid of 24 boundaries and a six, and thus became the first wicket-keeper batsman from New Zealand to register a double hundred in Tests.</p>
      <p>The previous best by a Kiwi wicket-keeper bat was Brendon McCullum’s 185 against Bangladesh at Hamilton in 2010.</p>
      <p>Watling’s marathon effort took New Zealand to 615 for 9 before they declared, in reply to England’s 353. During the course of his innings, Watling was involved in a seventh wicket partnership of 261 with Mitchell Santner, who made with his career-best score of 126.</p>
      <p>Neil Wagner’s second innings five-for <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/cricket/wagner-s-five-for-seals-crushing-black-caps-win-over-england">bowled Kiwis to victory</a>, but Watling was the man of the match.</p>
      <p>There have been only a few instances of wicket-keepers scoring double hundreds in Tests. Here are five of the more memorable ones.</p>
      <h4>#5 Mushfiqur Rahim, 200 against Sri Lanka in 2013</h4>

      <p>The experienced Bangladesh wicket-keeper Mushfiqur Rahim scored exactly 200 from 321 balls against Sri Lanka in the Galle Test of March 2013. The standout feature of his innings was the fact that Rahim’s knock came in response to Sri Lanka’s mammoth first-innings score of 570 for 4.</p>
      <p>Rahim stood up to the Lankan attack and hit 22 fours and 1 six. Mohammad Ashraful scored 190 and Nasir Hossain 100, as Bangladesh replied with 638 all out.</p>
      <p>Bangladesh drew the contest, and Rahim became an even bigger star on the international stage than he already was.</p>
