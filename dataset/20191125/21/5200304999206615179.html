      <p>Rumours about the sequel of Yash Raj Films’ ‘Bunty Aur Babli’ have been doing the rounds for days, with latest buzz suggesting that Saif Ali Khan and Rani Mukerji will be taking the film forward.</p>
      <p>Earlier, rumours about Khan opting out of the project had made the headlines. However, it seems Khan will be taking up the lead role, where Mukerji will reprise her role as Babli.</p>
      <p>A source told <i>The Asian Age</i>, “Apart from Saif and Rani, Siddhant Chaturvedi and Sharvari Wagh have been roped in for the film. The film will actually continue from where the earlier one ended. R Madhavan was also approached to play the role that Abhishek Bachchan played in the original, but it doesn’t seem that the dates worked out. Saif is now in the project, getting the Hum Tum team back together. Saif had won the National Award for Best Actor when he was paired with Rani in Hum Tum.”</p>
      <p>The ‘Bunty Aur Babli’ sequel will be directed by Varun B Sharma.</p>
