      <h1>A Quick Reminder of Why Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber Broke Up</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T21:45:17+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 21:45</time> by <a rel="author">Amanda Prahl</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/selena-gomez-2019-american-music-awards-performance-video-46914625">Selena Gomez performed</a> at <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/celebrity/best-pictures-from-2019-american-music-awards-46941064">the 2019 American Music Awards</a> with <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/When-Selena-Gomez-Releasing-Her-New-Album-44741115">her first new songs in years</a>, which are generally considered to be <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/celebrity/Selena-Gomez-Justin-Bieber-Songs-About-Each-Other-44224070">about the end of her relationship with Justin Bieber</a>. The performance might have casual viewers wondering when and why they broke up in the first place. Although neither of them ever spoke about it in detail, we've got a pretty good idea of what led to their final split.</p>
      <p>The couple had a long and messy history together, with a constant on-and-off relationship dating back to the beginning of the decade. After a lot of back and forth and <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/celebrity/Selena-Gomez-Relationship-History-38858804">dating other people</a>, <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/celebrity/Justin-Bieber-Selena-Gomez-LA-October-2017-Photo-44196771">they did reconcile one more time in late 2017</a>, but as always, drama was never far away. By sometime in the Spring of 2018, E! reported that their "break is <a href="http://www.eonline.com/shows/e_news/news/923198/justin-bieber-and-selena-gomez-are-they-moving-on-from-each-other">becoming a full-blown breakup</a>," and Bieber was quickly spotted with other women, including model Baskin Champion and, eventually, his then ex-girlfriend and future wife Hailey Baldwin. By July, he and Baldwin were engaged.</p>
      <p>The precise reason for the breakup never quite became public knowledge, but insiders reported that the relationship hadn't been healthy for a while. "They haven't spoken in months. She hasn't been talking about him since they ended things again earlier this year. It was never a healthy situation for Selena and Justin . . . Their relationship was always very complex and complicated. <a href="http://people.com/music/selena-gomez-reaction-justin-bieber-engagement-hailey-baldwin/">It was just too much baggage</a>," a pair of sources told <b>People</b> in July 2018.</p>
      <p>That view on their relationship seemed to be confirmed with <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/selena-gomez-third-album-details-46932232">Gomez's first new music in years</a>, "Lose You to Love Me" and "<a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/selena-gomez-look-at-her-now-music-video-46802167">Look at Her Now</a>," which are widely believed to <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/is-selena-gomez-lose-you-to-love-me-about-justin-bieber-46798031">address the end of Bieber and Gomez's long-running relationship</a> and his quick engagement to Baldwin soon after their final split. "Lose You to Love Me" includes lyrics such as "Set fire to my purpose / And I let it burn / You got off on the hurting when it wasn't yours" that seemed to imply Gomez was deeply unhappy in the relationship; later lyrics include a revelation of self-love only after their breakup: "I needed to lose you to find me / This dancing was killing me softly / I needed to hate you to love me." After all the drama and painful emotions, though, it seems like they're both fairly happy now, with <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/celebrity/justin-bieber-hailey-baldwin-married-in-south-carolina-46690037">Bieber apparently happily married</a> and <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/selena-gomez-on-air-with-ryan-seacrest-interview-video-46809327">Gomez starting off with a new wave of music</a>.</p>
