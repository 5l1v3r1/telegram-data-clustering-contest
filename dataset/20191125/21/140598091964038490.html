      <h1>Russia should compete as neutrals at next Olympics and football World Cup, says anti-doping panel</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T21:10:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 21:10</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/telegraph-sport/" target="_blank">Telegraph Sport</a></address>
      <p>Russian athletes should be forced to <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/athletics/2019/11/18/olympics-will-oppose-blanket-bans-russians-wada-process-could/">compete as neutrals at next year’s Olympics in Tokyo</a> and other major events, a key World Anti-Doping Agency panel recommended on Monday.</p>
      <p>Wada’s compliance review committee proposed a four-year ban on hosting major events in Russia and a ban for the same period on flying the Russian flag at major competitions. The Wada executive committee will rule on the recommendations on Dec 9.</p>
      <p>The recommendation follows a lengthy investigation into lab data handed over by Russia in January. That was part of a deal to lift a suspension of the Russian anti-doping agency, and was meant to expose past cover-ups of drug use by Russian athletes. Instead, the Wada panel says data on hundreds of positive tests were removed.</p>
      <p>Russia was officially banned from the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang but allowed by the International Olympic Committee to send a 168-strong team under the name “Olympic Athlete from Russia”.</p>
      <p>The panel’s recommendation would create a similar system lasting four years and covering not just the Tokyo Olympics but also the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing and major championships in several sports, including football.</p>
      <p>With Russia having booked their place at Euro 2020, their elimination now could potentially open the door for Scotland, who finished behind them in their qualifying group.</p>
      <p>The expert panel’s advice could have serious implications for Uefa if accepted in full by Wada’s executive committee.</p>
      <p>The recommendations include stripping Russia of sports events already awarded “unless it is legally or practically impossible to do so”.</p>

      <p>St Petersburg in Russia is set to host four games, including a quarter-final, at European 2020, which is being co-hosted in 12 different countries. The city is set to share hosting a four-team group with Copenhagen in Denmark.</p>
      <p>Some tickets for those games have been sold ahead of the tournament draw on Saturday, and St Petersburg could likely be replaced by Stockholm, which was a losing candidate when host cities were chosen in 2014.</p>
      <p>St Petersburg was also chosen two months ago to host the Champions League final in 2021. A replacement could easily be found. Wada said the most recent edits to the vast laboratory data archive were made in December 2018 and January this year, after Russia had agreed to hand over the data.</p>
      <p>“These activities were concealed by backdating of computer systems and data files in an attempt to make it appear that the Moscow data had been in their current state since 2015,” Wada said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Wada added that messages were planted to implicate former lab director Grigory Rodchenkov, who later became a witness for Wada, and two other people.</p>
