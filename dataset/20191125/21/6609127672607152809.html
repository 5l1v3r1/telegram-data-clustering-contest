        <b>A REVELLER was rescued by firefighters after getting his hand stuck in a pub radiator.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The mortified drinker had to be freed with hydraulic cutting gear when his digits got lodged between the heater and the boozer’s wall.</p>

      <p>Tickled onlookers took a series of snaps at the Boarding House in Howwood, Renfrewshire, before dialling 999 on Sunday.</p>
      <p>One pub-goer said: “The guy was really starting to panic so the fire brigade were called.</p>
      <p>"I’m not sure why his hand was down there — maybe he dropped something and was trying to retrieve it.</p>
      <p>"But he soon regretted his decision.”</p>
      <p>The unlucky punter was treated with oxygen therapy before being taken home.</p>
      <p>A Scottish Fire and Rescue Service spokesman said: “We were alerted at 6.40pm on Sunday to reports of a person in need of assistance within a pub.</p>
      <p>“Operations control mobilised one fire appliance to the town’s Main Street, where firefighters used small cutting gear to help a casualty whose hand had become trapped in a radiator.”</p>
      <p>“Crews removed the casualty to safety and provided the individual with oxygen therapy before leaving the scene.”</p>
      <p>We told how a pensioner was rescued by 12 firefighters after getting stuck up a tree in Insch, Aberdeenshire, in 2013.</p>
      <p>The 70-year-old worker was stranded 20ft up when his ladder crashed to the ground.</p>
