      <h1>Nicola Sturgeon admits NHS has 'challenges' after broken promises and hospital infections</h1>
      <h2>The First Minister insisted the NHS is 'not immune' to problems as she was put on the spot by Andrew Neil ahead of the general election.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T21:24:37+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 21:24</time> by <a rel="author">Andy Philip, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/andy-philip/</a></address>
      <p>Nicola Sturgeon was forced to defend her record of handling the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/nhs-scotland">NHS</a> during a bruising broadcast interview.</p>
      <p>The First Minister was asked to respond to a long list of missed targets, <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/heartbroken-mum-reveals-child-cancer-20889570">infection</a> scandals and hospitals that cannot fully open.</p>
      <p>The set-piece Andrew Neil pre-election interview was dominated by well-worn debate over independence and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/european-union">EU</a> membership.</p>
      <p>But Sturgeon, the longest serving former health secretary, also had to answer for problems in the devolved health service.</p>
      <p>A public inquiry is being held into construction problems at the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/health/opening-troubled-edinburgh-sick-kids-20024259">unopened sick kids’ hospital</a> in Edinburgh.</p>
      <p>The Record also revealed this month that child <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/health-secretary-admits-dirty-water-20923955">cancer patient Milly Main died</a> after contracting a dirty water infection at the new Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow.</p>
      <p>Sturgeon said: “Health services everywhere have challenges. We are not immune from that. But I believe that we are doing the things that are required to fix those challenges and to make sure that we have the health service that people expect. And patient satisfaction ratings for NHS Scotland remain extremely high.”</p>
      <p>Faced with criticism for the consistently broken promise of a legal waiting time guarantee, Sturgeon insisted: “I don’t think it’s unreasonable to say, yes, we have challenges in Scotland.</p>
      <p>“But we are dealing with these challenges more effectively than any other part of the UK.”</p>
      <p>On general election issues, Sturgeon stuck by plans for an independence referendum next year.</p>
      <p>She insisted Scotland has a <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/nicola-sturgeon-insists-scotland-could-20959060">quick path to EU membership</a> despite concerns over the timetable and currency plans.</p>
      <p>Former European Parliament president Martin Schulz said an independent Scotland would face a “very long, hard debate” on rejoining.</p>
      <p>But in August, a Polish MEP who helped negotiate the country’s entry said they would be “strong supporters” of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/law-professor-says-independent-scotland-20573050">Scotland’s membership.</a></p>
      <p>On currency, EU countries are supposed to commit to joining the EU at some point, but countries such as Sweden have never done so.</p>
      <p>The SNP wants to used the pound after independence then move to a new currency after strict tests are met, including having a central bank.</p>
      <p>Sturgeon claimed: “In all of my experience of discussions with different interests in the European Union I think that could be relatively quick but that will depend on the discussions we have.</p>
      <p>“We understand the conditions we would require to meet and the discussions that would require to take place but if we’re in a position of Scotland being taken out of the European Union then we will be seeking a way back in.”</p>
      <p>Sturgeon repeated demands Labour would have to agree to an independence referendum for support in a minority government.</p>
      <p>But she also refused to prop up Boris Johnson, adding: “I would never do anything to support a Conservative government in office.”</p>
      <p>Scots Tory candidate Paul Masterton said: “Here goes Nicola Sturgeon again. We had the same vague assurances during the independence referendum. Now once again she’s back telling Scots not to worry their heads, it’ll all be alright on the night.”</p>
