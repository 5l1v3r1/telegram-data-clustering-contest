      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: Allan, 70, and Wilma Hyrons, 59, were in the Philippines when they were snatched a month ago and freed today following a 20-minute shoot-out</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T21:05:52+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 21:05</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Hughes, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/chris-hughes/</a></address>
      <p>The SAS and intelligence officers played a key role in the dramatic rescue of a British ­couple held hostage by Islamic State loyalists.</p>
      <p>Allan and Wilma Hyrons were freed this morning by the Philippine Army after being kidnapped on October 4.</p>
      <p>British special forces helped to plan the rescue mission.</p>
      <p>Allan, 70, and Wilma, 59, were saved after a 20-minute shoot-out on the island of Sulu, 400 miles from where they were snatched.</p>
      <p>They were left behind as their abductors from the Abu Sayyaf group fled.</p>
      <p>Lieutenant General Cirilito Sobejana said: “There was a running gun battle.”</p>
      <p>He added the hostages were abandoned by the gunmen “because they could not drag them any more”.</p>
      <p>Foreign ­Secretary <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/dominic-raab-mp">Dominic Raab</a> praised the “tremendous efforts” of the authorities in the Philippines.</p>

      <p>He said: “We worked closely with the government of the Philippines on Allan and Wilma’s case over the last two months.</p>
      <p>“We are in particular grateful to their armed forces for their courage. Foreign Office officials have been in contact with their family throughout this ordeal.”</p>
      <p>But a security source added: “Special forces will have had a significant input on the rescue, offering technical advice and help in planning the actual military operation.</p>
      <p>"And our intelligence officers will have provided information on the ramifications of the rescue, who the abductors are and how much support they have.”</p>
      <p>The couple were abducted from a resort in Zamboanga del Norte province.</p>
      <p>Witnesses reported seeing them being taken from a hut and dragged to a motorboat.</p>
      <p>British Ambassador Daniel Pruce tweeted after the rescue: “Fantastic news!”</p>
