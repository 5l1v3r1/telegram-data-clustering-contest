      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T21:52:09+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 21:52</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fxstreet.com/author/ross-j-burland" target="_blank">Ross J Burland</a></address>
      <p>Today’s quarter three retail sales volumes have been released and while it is a second trier data release, it is still a closely watched component of production GDP. The data arrived as follows and as a positive for the bird:</p>
      <h3>Data release</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>New Zealand Retail Sales (QoQ) (Q3) Actual: 1.6% Vs 0.3% Previous.</li>
        <li>New Zealand Core Retail Sales (QoQ) Actual: 1.8% Vs 0.2% Previous.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>NZD/USD jumps 20 pips from 0.6406 to a high of 0.6425.</p>
      <h4>FX implications</h4>
      <p>The retail Sales released by the <a href="http://www.stats.govt.nz/">Statistics New Zealand</a> measures the total receipts of retail stores. Quarterly percent changes reflect the rate of changes of such sales. Changes in <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/economic-calendar">Retail Sales</a> are widely followed as an indicator of consumer spending. A high reading is seen as positive (or bullish) for the NZD, while a low reading is seen as negative (or bearish). On this data, the bird has spiked about 20 pips. </p>
