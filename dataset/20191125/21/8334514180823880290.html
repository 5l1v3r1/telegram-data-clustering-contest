      <p>NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar rose and global equity markets rallied on Monday, with the Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500 hitting new highs as investors grew more hopeful the United States and China could soon sign an interim deal to end their trade war.</p>

      <p>Trade-sensitive miners in Europe and semiconductors on Wall Street climbing on reports suggesting the world’s two largest economies were close to an initial trade deal. A burst of M&amp;A activity also lifted equities.</p>
      <p>European shares posted their biggest daily gain in three weeks as France’s LVMH agreed to buy luxury jeweler Tiffany &amp; Co for $16.2 billion, and Swiss drugmaker Novartis agreed to a $9.7 billion acquisition of The Medicines Co.</p>
      <p>In the United States, Charles Schwab Corp agreed to buy TD Ameritrade Holding Corp in an all-stock deal valued at $26 billion while EBay Inc will sell ticketing unit StubHub to ticket reseller Viagogo Ltd for $4.05 billion in cash.</p>
      <p>Reports that an elusive “phase one” U.S.-Sino trade agreement was near drove broad buying in stock markets.</p>
      <p>“The market’s really assuming that we get an initial deal,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York. “There’s a lot of optimism, excessive optimism, but there is still some upside assuming that it does occur.”</p>
      <p>Corporations have put a hold on capital expenditures on property, plant and equipment as trade uncertainty has dragged on the industrial side of the U.S. economy, Ghriskey said.</p>
      <p>“I don’t see the market selling off when eventually we get a deal, but there’s limited upside at that point,” he said.</p>
      <p>U.S. national security adviser Robert O’Brien said on Saturday that a trade pact was still possible by year’s end, while Chinese state-backed tabloid Global Times said Beijing and Washington were “very close” to a “phase one” trade deal.</p>
      <p>Adding to the positive mood was the weekend announcement that China would seek to improve protections for intellectual property rights, a sticking point in the talks.</p>
      <p>MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.70% and its emerging markets index added 0.47%. The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 1.0%.</p>
      <p>Apple Inc, Microsoft Corp and Amazon.com, along with microchip stocks, lifted U.S. stocks.</p>
      <p>The Philadelphia Semiconductor index jumped 2.43% and was on pace for its best day in just over three weeks.</p>
      <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 190.85 points, or 0.68%, to 28,066.47. The S&amp;P 500 gained 23.35 points, or 0.75%, to 3,133.64 and the Nasdaq Composite added 112.60 points, or 1.32%, to 8,632.49.</p>
      <p>The benchmark S&amp;P 500 has gained 25% so far this year, while the Nasdaq is up 30%.</p>
      <p>Overnight in Asia, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan bounced 0.7% and Japan’s Nikkei firmed 0.7%.</p>
      <p>Gold fell for a fourth straight session, sliding to a two-week low, as investors’ appetite for riskier assets increased. Oil prices edged higher.</p>
      <p>U.S. gold futures settled down 0.5% at $1,456.90 an ounce. Brent crude futures gained 26 cents to settle at $63.63 a barrel and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude rose 24 cents to settle at $58.01 a barrel.</p>
      <p>Core euro zone bond yields rose slightly, as positive trade developments trumped last week’s weak euro zone data.</p>
      <p>The German benchmark 10-year bond yield rose two basis points in early London trading before easing to trade almost flat on the day at -0.349%.</p>
      <p>U.S. Treasury yields slid ahead of the Treasury Department’s scheduled sale of $113 billion in coupon-bearing supply this week and on optimism about trade.</p>
      <p>Benchmark 10-year notes rose 4/32 in price to push their yield down to 1.7586%.</p>
      <p>The dollar index rose 0.05%, with the euro down 0.11% to $1.1009. The Japanese yen weakened 0.29% versus the greenback at 108.96 per dollar.</p>
