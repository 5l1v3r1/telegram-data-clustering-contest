      <p>Doha:  Qatar coach Felix Sanchez said Monday that facing the Iraqi team in the opening match of the Arabian Gulf Cup on Tuesday will be difficult for the two teams. Sanchez added that he looks forward to a perfect start so the team can take the first step in the journey towards winning the title.</p>
      <p>Sanchez said at the press conference held today that the preparations started immediately after the match against Afghanistan in the Asian qualifiers, but before the team was given two days rest to catch their breath and give them more rest.</p>
      <p>He added that the Qatari team aspires to achieve a perfect start, especially that the opening game always motivates players and adds confidence to win one match after another.</p>
      <p>Sanchez has kept faith in the core squad that won the Asian Cup, with few youngsters joining the experienced stars.</p>
      <p>He pointed out that the Asian Cup is different from the Arabian Gulf Cup, which is a new challenge and competition different from others, and all participating teams aspire to achieve positive results and win their matches.</p>
      <p>Qatar is hosting the Arabian Gulf Cup for the fourth time and will be gunning for their fourth title, and a grand double to add to their historic AFC Asian Cup title they won in the UAE in February.</p>
      <p>Qatars previous triumphs came in 1992, 2004 and 2014, and are undoubtedly the strongest contenders among eight Arab Gulf Cup Football Federation teams to lift the title on December 6. (QNA)</p>
