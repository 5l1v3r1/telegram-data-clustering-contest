      <p><i>Witches of East End</i> star <b>Jenna Dewan</b> has been forced to publicly deny throwing a heap of shade at <b>Camila Cabello</b> at the American Music Awards yesterday.</p>
      <p>During Camila and <b>Shawn Mendes’</b> ~steamy~ performance of ‘Señorita’, Dewan was reportedly spotted saying, “She’s always extra,” to stylist friend <b>Brad Goreski</b> while rolling her eyes, <a href="https://people.com/music/amas-2019-jenna-dewan-denies-shading-camila-cabello/">according to People</a>.</p>
      <p>Goreski later defended his friend, stating: “Guys, we were bumping and grinding so hard to ‘Señorita.’”</p>

      <p>After the internet got into a major tizzy over the whole thing and Dewan was receiving loads of texts from her famous mates, she publicly shut down the rumours on Instagram.</p>
      <p>“I’m getting a lot of text messages from people wondering if I was shading Camila. No! I love her, I love her so much. I’m such a big fan of hers,” Dewan said on her story.</p>
      <p>“I don’t understand what that’s about but no, I love her, love her, love her.”</p>

      <p>A bit of background on the girl in case you’re not as obsessed with her as I am: She’s the ex-wife of <b>Channing Tatum</b>.</p>
      <p>The pair share a 6-year-old daughter<b> Everly</b> and finalised their divorce earlier this month.</p>
      <p>In September, Dewan announced she and boyfriend <b>Steve Kazee</b> are expecting their first child together.</p>
      <p>Dewan starred in <i>Step Up</i> alongside Tatum and also played the loveable witch Freya in the mystical series<i> Witches of East End</i> alongside<i> Riverdale</i> star <b>Mädchen Amick.</b></p>
      <p>It ran for two seasons before its shock cancellation. The series is currently streaming on Netflix, so go forth and binge, witches.</p>
