      <p>I'm A Celebrity aired a food hoarding discovery on Monday that left a number of campmates raging.</p>
      <p>Two of the gang, Nadine Coyle and Myles Stephenson, were blamed for the awkward mix-up that had left the stars super hungry this week, significantly the day before.</p>
      <p>Nadine and Myles had been placed in charge of the cooking by camp leader James Haskell hence the blame laying with them, as it emerged a number of bags of food hadn't been used.</p>
      <p>Instead, they'd been kept in the trunk, with no one appearing to even know they were there - despite the stars complaining of hunger.</p>
      <p>As James had a search through the trunk in the latest episode, he suddenly found extra food they didn't realise existed.</p>

      <p>But it wasn't just one, two, maybe three bags - James found 21 extra bags of beans uneaten.</p>
      <p>Not only that, but there wasn't the same amount of rice to match.</p>
      <p>While they tend to keep a few back in case the camp have a smaller meal another day, or generally get hungry around lunchtime, 21 is far too much to be hoarding.</p>

      <p>James told his campmates: "We have got to be way better at this food organisation, we’ve got 21 beans in here."</p>
      <p>A hungry Ian shouted: "What?! And we are getting the same amount of rice to beans?”</p>
      <p>Jacqueline Jossa admitted people weren't eating their beans in favour of the rice.</p>
      <p>She confessed: "When we are putting them on we are putting just three of four bags on instead of the amount of people there are.”</p>

      <p>Andrew Maxwell complained: "It’s madness. We had such a tiny portion of beans yesterday.”</p>
      <p>James went on: "It’s because people aren’t organising them properly by putting them in a box so you can see what you’ve got….I’m not going to have a go at Myles because he’s doing such a brilliant job or Nadine because she’s so lovely but we’ve got to have a conversation.</p>
      <p>“I’d delegated catering admin to a couple of other people but I’m now going to take over it myself to make sure we don’t find hoarded food because yesterday everyone was flagging.”</p>
      <p>Ian later said in the Bush Telegraph: "Everyone was sitting there hungry yesterday not realising that we’ve got 21 packets of beans!" with Andrew adding: "We didn’t need to go hungry at all yesterday."</p>
