      <p><i>Knives Out</i>, a fun, murder-mystery film, is hitting theaters just in time for the holidays to act as the ultimate getaway treat for your own personal family drama. But in case you need more of an escape between carving turkey and avoiding politics, these 12 <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/nov/15/she-has-become-cool-how-agatha-christie-became-cinema-hot-property">books like <i>Knives Out</i></a> are perfect to pick up after you see the movie when it premieres on Nov. 27. (And if you decide to start reading them now, I can keep a secret.)</p>
      <p>Directed by Rian Johnson (<i>The Last Jedi</i>) and starring many famous faces like Daniel Craig (<i>Casino Royale</i>), Chris Evans (<i>Avengers: Endgame</i>), and Jamie Lee Curtis (<i>Halloween</i>), <i>Knives Out</i> is a rollicking murder mystery set on a rural, luxurious estate. To celebrate his 85th birthday, crime writer Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer) invites his estranged family to his home, with disastrous results. Thrombey is found dead, but was he killed by a family member, a dissatisfied employee, or someone else entirely? Detective Benoit Blanc (Craig) swoops in to solve the case, but it's not an easy job. Everyone in Thrombey's circle (and family) wants <i>something</i>, and they each have secrets to keep.</p>
      <p><i>Knives Out</i> has drawn comparisons to <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2019/11/knives-out-review.html">Agatha Christie's Hercule Poirot mysteries</a> and the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2019-11-18/rian-johnson-knives-out-agatha-christie-alfred-hitchcock">films of Alfred Hitchcock</a>. And while there is no <i>Knives Out</i> book, if you're looking for stories like the movie to read, look no further than these 12 fun titles:</p>
      <h3>In the Hall with the Knife by Diana Peterfreund</h3>

      <p>With humor to temper its dark subject matter, <i>Knives Out</i> feels a lot like the 1985 <i>Clue</i> film starring Tim Curry, which makes Diana Peterfreund's board game-based novel, <i>In the Hall with the Knife</i>, the perfect accompaniment. The first book in a new series of <i>Clue</i> mysteries, <i>In the Hall with the Knife</i> centers on a group of six prep school students, who must solve a murder mystery — and try to stay alive — when their headmaster is found dead in the conservatory.</p>

      <p>An attorney returns home to investigate his sister's death in this novel from <i>Black Orchid Blues</i> author Persia Walker. A lot of Lillian's life doesn't make sense to David, including her marriage to a near-stranger, and the odd behavior of her twin, Gem, following the death. David doesn't trust his late sister's widower husband, and he takes it upon himself to protect their family legacy from this outsider. But David has secrets, too, and they make Harlem a very dangerous place for him.</p>

      <p>For the last 10 years, a group of nine college chums have spent the days between Christmas and New Year's together on holiday. This year, they've rented Loch Corrin, a remote, Scottish estate, where they can get a little much-needed peace and quiet. Two days after they arrive, however, one of them is dead. The Loch Corrin guest was murdered, ostensibly, by someone who was supposed to be a friend, but who is dead, and who killed them, are mysteries left to be revealed.</p>

When a close friend is murdered, and a clue at the scene points to a Holland short story, Clare finds herself at the center of a murder investigation.

Then another person's handwriting appears in the journal, addressing Clare directly, and the teacher's life becomes much more complicated — and deadly.</p>

      <p>In another time, Belle Vie embodied everything that antebellum Louisiana held dear. These days, it continues to sugarcoat its ugly history, hosting weddings and Civil War reenactments. Belle Vie's manager, Caren, is descended from the enslaved people who once worked on the property, and her job security is now threatened by the estate's lack of steady business. When the body of a murdered migrant worker is found nearby, Caren's routine business at Belle Vie becomes entwined with the ensuing police investigation.</p>

      <p>Set in 1921 Bombay, this series-starter from Sujata Massey centers on Perveen Mistry, a fresh Oxford grad who returns to India to work in her father's law firm. Perveen's first case involves the will of a mill owner, whose three wives have signed over their inheritances to the same charity. It's a strange move, and one that will almost certainly doom the women, who have no other means of income. Complicating matters is the fact that the widows live in seclusion, refusing to speak to men outside their families. Perveen begins her investigation, but soon finds herself wrapped up in a murder mystery only she can solve.</p>
