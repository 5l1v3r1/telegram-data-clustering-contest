        <b>Amid the protracted political crisis in Israel caused by the failure to form a government after the September snap election, the country's prime minister was indicted last week for fraud, breach of trust and bribery.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Israel's Attorney-General Avichai Mandelbilt on Monday said he did not believe Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has to step aside over his indictment in three corruption cases, the Justice Ministry announced.</p>
      <p>The ministry added that the statement was coming as a response to queries submitted to Mr Mandelbilt over <a href="https://sputniknews.com/middleeast/201911251077391176-netanyahus-likud-party-mulls-snap-leadership-vote-to-replace-embattled-pm---report/">whether Mr Netanyahu should resign</a>.</p>
      <p>This comes against the backdrop of a hung parliament in Israel which is the result of the inability of both Netanyahu and his major rival Benny Gantz to form a 61-seat governing coalition in the Knesset.Â </p>
      <p>Apart from this, Netanyahu has been recently charged with bribery, fraud and breach of trust on three separate occasions.</p>
