      <p>Stormzy has declared his support for Labour’s Jeremy Corbyn in the General Election, while slamming ‘sinister’ <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/boris-johnson/">Boris Johnson</a> in an epic tirade for the ages.</p>
      <p>In an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5TLV6PJKRh/">Instagram</a>, the Big For Your Boots rapper said Corbyn is ‘the first man in a position of power who is committed to giving the power back to the people and helping those who need a helping hand from the government the most.’</p>
      <p>He then went in on Boris – and did not mince his words.</p>
      <p>In his lengthy message, he calls the Conservative leader a ‘sinister man’ with a ‘long record of lying and policies that have absolutely no regard for the people that our government should be committed to helping and empowering’.</p>
      <p>Stormzy then added: ‘I also believe it is criminally dangerous to give the most powerful role in the country to a man who has said that the sight of a “bunch of black kids” makes him “turn a hair”, compared women in burqas to letterboxes and referred to blacks [sic] people as “picaninnies” with “watermelon smiles.”’</p>

      <p>The grime icon’s words follow an open letter published in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/25/stormzy-backs-labour-in-election-with-call-to-end-austerity">The Guardian</a> today in which he elaborated on his political beliefs.</p>

      <p>The letter was also signed many more of the UK’s top names in music, with Kano, Professor Green, Katy B, Kano and Akala among them.</p>
      <p>In it, a total of 35 artists state: ‘We are musicians, artists, rappers and grime MCs, and we will be voting for Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party this election.’</p>

      <p>‘We’re not voting Labour in the naive hope that they will solve all the problems our communities face,’ they went on.</p>
      <p>‘We vote because they offer an urgent alternative to the destructive policies of the Conservatives.’</p>
      <p>Later in the letter, the artists add: ‘Ending austerity will, for the first time in many of our lifetimes, use the taxes we all already pay into, to reinvest in the housing, youth clubs, community groups and cultural centres being destroyed by the current government.</p>

      <p>‘These spaces made many of us who we are today, and while we don’t rely on them like we used to, we know how important they will be for the next generation.’</p>
      <p>Powerful words.</p>
