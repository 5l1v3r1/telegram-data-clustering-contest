      <h1>EXCLUSIVE: 50 Cent Dragging Rick Ross Back Into Court Over Leaked Sex Tape</h1>

      <p>50 Cent's legal team can't get close enough to serve him with legal papers in his ongoing war with a legal firm over a $7 million payout to Rick Ross' ex-girlfriend for a leaked sex tape.</p>
      <p><b>(AllHipHop News)</b> 50 Cent has opened up another front in his ongoing war with rap star Rick Ross.</p>
      <p>50 Cent is trying to haul Rick Ross into court as part of a $32 million legal war with his old law firm, Reed Smith and an attorney named Peter Raymond.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://allhiphop.com/news/50-cent-out-of-bankruptcy-in-new-reorganization-deal-YBPxln2G-0i5gJmoqb35mQ/">The Queens, New York rapper claims the law firm cost him $7 million, which he had to pay to Rick Ross' former girlfriend Lastonia Leviston who was featured in a leaked sex tape narrated by Fif's character "Pimpin Curly."</a>
      </p>
      <p>In January of 2017, 50 Cent went after Reed Smith when the firm demanded he fork over $600,000 in unpaid legal fees.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://allhiphop.com/news/50-cent-hits-his-old-lawyers-with-a-32-million-lawsuit--DQnBFNf20GnNp-mlC_1ug/">50 Cent accused Reed Smith of malpractice, saying the firm's shoddy work tanked his case and forced him into Chapter 11 bankruptcy.</a>
      </p>
      <p>50 blames Reed Smith and Raymond for intentionally deceived him by failing to disclose a binding pre-trial stipulation between their firm and Lastonia's lawyers, which "precluded key material witnesses," including his longtime foe, Rick Ross.</p>
      <p>The battle has been delayed because 50 Cent's team cannot get anywhere close to Rick Ross to serve him with paperwork, so they are asking a judge to give them more time to find the Miami rapper.</p>
      <p>Rick Ross, born William Leonard Roberts II, was supposed to be deposed on Friday (November 22nd).</p>
      <p>But 50's legal team has had no luck attempting to serve Rick Ross because they cannot get past the security at his sprawling Atlanta mansion.</p>
      <p>AllHipHop obtained emails 50's team has been sending back and forth about their cross country attempts to serve Rick Ross, so he can sit and be questioned in regards to <a href="https://allhiphop.com/news/rapper-50-cent-drops-porn-featuring-rick-ross-baby-s-mom-9CANR9O3nEu1hHz9cItp9Q/">the sex tape.</a></p>

      <p>A process server tried to get Rick Ross at a show in Pennsylvania on October 31 and again on November 3 at his gig at ComplexCon in California without any success, due to the rap star's security.</p>
      <p>"Given his celebrity lifestyle, Ross has proven exceptionally difficult to personally serve," 50 Cent's legal team said in a court filing. "As a prominent celebrity, Ross lives in a gated home and has personal security personnel protecting him at the various public appearances he makes."</p>
      <p>50 Cent's legal asking the judge overseeing the case to give them until December 20th to find Rick Ross so they can depose the rap star.</p>
