      <p>LONGWOOD, The Bronx (WABC) -- A manhunt is underway in the Bronx Monday after one person was slashed, possibly with a machete, inside a laundromat.</p>
      <p>It happened on Southern Boulevard and East 149th Street in the Longwood section.</p>
      <p>Police say the suspect ran into the business and took a swing at the victim but missed. He then swung a second time, slashing him in the left arm with a sharp object.</p>
      <p>The man then ran back outside and hopped into a dark-colored BMW that fled the scene.</p>
      <p>The victim was taken to Lincoln Hospital with a non life-threatening injury.</p>
      <p>The FDNY says three other people were transported to the hospital with unknown injuries.</p>
      <p>It is believed the suspect and victim know each other, and sources tell Eyewitness News this is an ongoing dispute over money.</p>
