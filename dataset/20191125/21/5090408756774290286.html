      <p>If you know exactly what model you need, then skip right down to the deals.</p>
      <p>If you’re having trouble deciding which of the various KitchenAid stand mixers is right for you, there are a few things to consider: KitchenAid makes two types of stand mixers, the tilt-head and the bowl-lift. Most home bakers will want to opt for tilt-head mixers since they make it easy to remove attachments, don’t require a ton of vertical space, and work well for family-sized batches of doughs and batters. The bowl-lift style is generally used for high-powered, professional stand mixers since they’re slightly more stable. They require more vertical space to make room for the bowl to move up or down, but they’re best for anyone who plans on making lots of large batches or heavy doughs.</p>

            <li>This 275-watt is the KitchenAid stand mixer that most home bakers who don’t care about color opt for (because it only comes in a few neutral options). It has a powerful motor and a medium-large mixing bowl for family-sized batches of dough.

            <li>This 450-watt bowl-lift model has a stronger motor than the Classic, along with a larger bowl, but similarly doesn’t come in many colors.
