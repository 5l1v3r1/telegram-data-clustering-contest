        <b>Jamie Carragher has warned <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/manchester-united-fc/">Manchester United</a>’s board ‘that they would not be doing their job properly’ if they fail to speak with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/mauricio-pochettino/">Mauricio Pochettino</a> over replacing <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/ole-gunnar-solskjaer/">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a>.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Solskjaer is under intense scrutiny after a miserable start to the season for the Red Devils, with the club sitting ninth in the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/premier-league/">Premier League</a> with only four wins from 13 matches.</p>
      <p>The Norwegian would have been fearing for his job after a dismal opening hour at Sheffield United on Sunday afternoon, but a spirited second-half fightback to salvage a draw may have saved him for the time being.</p>
      <p>However, it’s understood United are eyeing a move for Pochettino after the Argentine was sacked by Tottenham last week.</p>

      <p>Though Carragher agrees with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/25/gary-neville-destroys-fred-andreas-pereira-tells-ole-gunnar-solskjaer-selfish-january-11217904/">Gary Neville that Solskjaer should have money to spend in January</a>, he believes United’s board have no option but to begin talks with Pochettino.</p>

      <p>‘We can say about any team in this league that they need five or six top players,’ Carragher said on <i>Sky Sports’ Monday Night Football.</i></p>
      <p>‘Let’s not forget Manchester United are the biggest spenders in the summer so it always seem to go back at United… more money, spend more money, spend more money.</p>
      <p>‘The money they’ve spent since Alex Ferguson left is just astronomical and look where they are now. In terms of Solskjaer, the top six teams in this country now all believe they should be challenging for the league.</p>
      <p>‘There’s always going to be two or three we’re criticising and saying: “are they getting into the top four?” There’s Arsenal, Tottenham and Manchester United are the other one.</p>
      <p>‘In terms of Ole, there’s no doubt Pochettino was the one they originally wanted and Solskjaer did so well that it forced United to give him the job.</p>
      <p>‘I agree that he should be allowed in January to get what he needs and look after himself but at the top of United, if this continues into Christmas or January, this is Manchester United, one win in 11 away from home since March.</p>
      <p>‘With a guy like Pochettino who could take this club forward, they would not be doing their job properly if they weren’t in contact with him.’</p>
