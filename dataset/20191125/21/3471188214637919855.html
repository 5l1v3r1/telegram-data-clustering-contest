      <h1>Samsung Galaxy S11 5G benchmarks have appeared and it looks good</h1>

      <p>Over the last month we’ve already started to see some of the <a href="https://ausdroid.net/2019/11/12/samsung-rumour-time-the-first-galaxy-s11-rumours-leak-out/">rumours about the upcoming Galaxy S11</a>. This includes a potential <a href="https://ausdroid.net/2019/11/23/samsung-galaxy-s11-renders-leak-showing-5-cameras-on-the-rear/">five rear facing cameras</a> and <a href="https://ausdroid.net/2019/11/10/samsung-galaxy-s11-to-feature-108mp-camera-sensor-rumours-say-so/">108MP sensors</a> for the camera array. Now we get a sneak peek at the potential performance thanks to Geekbench results appearing for the 5G model.</p>
      <p>Model Number SM-G986B has appeared on Geekbench and been found by a few eagle eyed readers and sites. The benchmark gives us some confirmation into the specs (at least for the engineering model) including 12GB of memory, Android 10 and an Exynos 9830 (same chip as 990) SoC processor.</p>

      <p>There’s plenty of other information floating around about the potential options we’re likely to see for the LTE and 5G model. We’re yet to get absolute clarity on specific specs for each. The storage options run from 128GB – 512GB, according to SamMobile the S11+ will have a 1TB option. It’s unclear if the 12GB of memory will be across both LTE and 5G universally, or if it will be for the higher storage units only.</p>
      <p>It’s early days for the S11 rumour train and we’re sure to see more in the coming months before its expected launch in Q1 2020.</p>
