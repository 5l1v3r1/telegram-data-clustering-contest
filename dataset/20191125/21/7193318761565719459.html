      <p>An alleged prostitution deal ended with one man dead, a convicted rapist charged with murder and a woman charged with helping the alleged murderer avoid arrest.</p>
      <p>Antonio Quinton Adair, 36, has been charged with first-degree murder, while Julia Jones, 29, has been charged with accessory to murder after authorities said Adair shot and killed Antonio Lamont Johnson, 31, in an Oklahoma City motel over a prostitution deal.</p>
      <p>On Oct. 14, Oklahoma City police responded to a reported shooting at Drovers Inn, 3809 S I-35 Service Road. Johnson, the victim, had been driven in a personal vehicle to Integris Southwest Medical Center.</p>
      <p>Investigators learned that Johnson and a witness allegedly arranged to have Jones perform oral sex on Johnson’s boss in Bethany, for $200, according to an arrest warrant.</p>
      <p>Johnson and a second witness allegedly took Jones to the home of Johnson’s boss, according to the warrant. Johnson and the second witness waited outside the home while Jones was inside with Johnson’s boss, authorities said.</p>
      <p>When Jones came outside, Johnson and the second witness took her to Drovers Inn, according to the arrest warrant. Authorities said once at the motel, Jones went into an unknown room. Johnson called the first witness, identified in the arrest warrant as a friend, who came to the motel, authorities said.</p>
      <p>Johnson started knocking on doors to find Jones. At room No. 109, Jones opened the door, Johnson started discussing “his portion of the money” for arranging the sex act, the arrest warrant says. Jones told Johnson she received only $100 for the sex act, not the original $200 allegedly agreed upon.</p>
      <p>At the motel room, Adair pulled out a handgun and shot Johnson at least once, according to the arrest warrant. The witnesses drove Johnson to the hospital where he later died during surgery, authorities said.</p>
      <p>In addition to first-degree murder, Adair has been charged with one count of felon in possession of a firearm. Authorities said he has previous felony convictions for rape, robbery and failure to register as a sex offender.</p>
      <p>In addition to accessory to murder, Jones has been charged with engaging in prostitution. Authorities said she has previous felony convictions for burglary and possession of a stolen vehicle.</p>
      <p>Adair and Jones were arrested in El Paso, Texas in October. As of Monday, they remained in custody at the Oklahoma County jail.</p>
