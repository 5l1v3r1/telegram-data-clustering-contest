      <p>Equities burst higher on Monday, as investors enter a short trading week ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday. Here’s a look at our top stock trades for Tuesday.</p>
      <h3>Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 1: Nvidia (NVDA)</h3>

      <p>What a beautiful move we’re seeing in <b>Nvidia</b> (NASDAQ:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/nvda-stock-quote/"><b><u>NVDA</u></b></a>) on Monday, up more than 4%. Shares are vaulting over former resistance and hitting $220.</p>
      <p>The move comes as little surprise, given that Nvidia stock was forming an ascending triangle. That’s a bullish setup where rising uptrend support (blue line) squeezes the stock price against a static level of resistance (black line).</p>
      <p>We <a href="https://investorplace.com/2019/11/nvidia-stock-is-setting-up-to-burst-higher/">outlined this setup just last week</a> here on <i>InvestorPlace</i>. With it coming to fruition, let’s see now if NVDA stock can get to our upside target near $227.50. On a pullback, see that $212.50 holds as support.</p>
      <h3>Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 2: Tesla (TSLA)</h3>

      <p><b>Tesla</b> (NASDAQ:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/tsla-stock-quote/"><b><u>TSLA</u></b></a>) stock was riding high into its Cybertruck unveil last week. On Friday, shares pulled back in the first trading session after the unveiling, as investors reacted to the futurist vehicle.</p>
      <p>After <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1198788116372344832?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet">tweeting</a> that the Cybertruck had logged 200,000 pre-orders, Tesla stock bounced back a bit on Monday. However, shares still lack momentum. Now what?</p>
      <p>Since the event, we have a nice two-day range on the chart, making the setup somewhat simple. If it falls below Friday’s low <i>and</i> the $330 mark, TSLA stock has downside to $310. Over Monday’s high and it can fill the gap up over $350.</p>
      <p>Those who take the downside short or the upside long can use the opposite entry as their stop-loss. (For example, if they’re shorting TSLA on a move below $330, bears can use Monday’s high as their stop-loss).</p>
      <h3>Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 3: Gilead (GILD)</h3>

      <p>What a strong move <b>Gilead Sciences</b> (NASDAQ:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/gild-stock-quote/"><b><u>GILD</u></b></a>) made on Monday. Earlier this month, shares burst through a bevy of moving averages (black arrow). Last Thursday, shares pulled back to these moving averages, and ripped higher after finding them as support (purple arrow).</p>
      <p>This served as a clue to investors that more upside may be coming. Now ripping through downtrend resistance, we’re seeing that upside play out. Let’s see if GILD can push up to the $67.50 to $68 area. Its 52-week high sits just under $73.</p>
      <p>On a pullback, bulls need to see former downtrend resistance hold as support.</p>
      <h3>Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 4: IWM ETF (IWM)</h3>

      <p>The <b>iShares Russell 2000 ETF</b> (NYSEARCA:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/iwm-stock-quote/"><b><u>IWM</u></b></a>) has spent all of November consolidating its recent rally to range resistance.</p>
      <p>With Monday’s 2% rally, we finally got the <a href="https://investorplace.com/2019/11/5-top-stock-trades-for-tuesday-nvda-iwm-xrx-roku-and-i/">breakout we were looking for</a>. Now see that the IWM holds the $158 to $160 area on any future pullbacks. While it’s a little early to get too ahead of our skis, this move is very noteworthy.</p>
      <p>Small caps have been significantly lagging their stock-index peers. To hit new highs, IWM will need to hurdle $173 — although that’s quite a ways from here. Let’s take it one day at a time, but for now, IWM looks good on the long side and may gain momentum into year-end.</p>
      <h3>No. 5: Kirkland Lake (KL)</h3>

      <p><b>Kirkland Lake</b> (NYSE:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/kl-stock-quote/"><b><u>KL</u></b></a>) was looking great after breaking out of its wedge pattern (blue lines) earlier this month. KL stock is plunging now, though, down 17% after an <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20191125005355/en/Kirkland-Lake-Gold-Add-New-Cornerstone-Asset">M&amp;A announcement</a>.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, there’s really not much to say that will give any solace to those who came in long. If shares can hold Monday’s low and reclaim the 200-day moving average, perhaps a rebound into the mid-$40s is possible. Below the 61.8% retracement near $38.50 and $36 is possible.</p>
      <p>It may take a few days for KL stock to shake out. Be careful in the meantime.</p>
