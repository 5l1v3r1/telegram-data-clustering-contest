      <p>People can now have their groceries carried for them by a robot that will follow their every move, all for the cost of a little under $5,000. But experts are asking, why?</p>
      <h3>Key points:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The Gita robot is designed to follow its owner and assist them with carrying goods</li>
        <li>The product is thus far only available in the United States</li>
        <li>The Gita retails for over $4,700, leading experts to question whether it is worth it</li>
      </ul>
      <p>According to one technology analyst, Italian company Piaggio — famous for the Vespa scooter — might be onto a loser with its "Gita" (pronounced Jee-tah) if all the robot does is carry groceries, not other applications such as lugging tools around warehouses, hospitals or factory floors.</p>
      <p>"That's a lot of money for what is in effect just a cargo-carrying robot that's going to carry your groceries," Forrester's JP Gownder told the Associated Press.</p>
      <p>However, in the eyes of Piaggio's tech arm Fast Forward, the Gita, named after the Italian word for a short, pleasurable excursion, is a way for people to get "connected" with their local areas — rather than take a car to the shops, they can walk with a robot.</p>
      <p>"We're trying to get you out into the world and connected to that neighbourhood you decided to move to because it was so walkable," said Greg Lynn, chief executive of Piaggio Fast Forward.</p>
      <p>On a recent November morning, Mr Lynn was hunched over in a Boston waterfront park, pushing a button that triggered a Gita to "see" him with its cameras and sensors. Then came a musical whirring sound as the device — a squarish, bright red bucket with two oversized wheels — rose up and signalled it was ready for a neighbourhood stroll.</p>

      <p>A young boy in a stroller pointed excitedly. Another pedestrian asked to try it and playfully shouted as it swerved around, keeping in pursuit as she switched directions.</p>
      <p>The Gita does not require a phone or intrusive people-tracking technology such as facial recognition or GPS.</p>
      <p>"It basically just locks onto you and tracks you," said Piaggio Fast Forward's other co-founder, Jeffrey Schnapp.</p>
      <p>Other start-ups, like Starship Technologies, have a more conventional business plan for their own delivery robots. The company charges a delivery fee starting at $US1.99 ($2.93) if you order its rovers to bring you a coffee or a lunch.</p>
      <p>So far, the best habitat to find Starship's six-wheelers are relatively confined spaces such as college campuses: the University of Houston and the University of Wisconsin-Madison rolled them out in autumn.</p>
      <p>The robots, which look like oversized ice chests on wheels, can carry up to 9 kilograms, while the Gita's capacity is 20kg.</p>
      <p>"I love them. I think they're so cute!" University of Houston freshman Sadie Garcia said as one of the machines rolled up with a bagel sandwich she had ordered. She said she was so cold she did not want to leave her dorm.</p>
      <p>Starship co-founder Ahti Heinla said his San Francisco start-up once looked at selling the machines directly to consumers but dropped the idea after realising it would have to price them at more than $3,000.</p>
      <p>Amazon is experimenting with a similar-looking machine that delivers retail goods in a handful of US areas. FedEx is testing its own delivery rover in partnership with Pizza Hut, Walmart, Target and Walgreens, while Ford has shown off a gangly two-legged robot to carry items to homes. So far, none are as far along as Starship, which has hundreds of its machines already in service.</p>
      <p>While Forrester's Mr Gownder is not impressed with the Gita, he is bullish about delivery robots of the Starship variety because their autonomy will help slash labour costs.</p>
