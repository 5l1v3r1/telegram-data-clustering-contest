      <h1>‘Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker’ Runtime Shorter Than Originally Reported</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T21:00:50+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 21:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.slashfilm.com/author/chris-evangelista/" target="_blank">Chris Evangelista</a></address>
      <p>It was previously reported that <b><i>Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</i></b> would be the longest <i>Star Wars</i> movie yet. Now it looks like reports of the film’s length have been slightly exaggerated. <i>Star Wars </i>director <b>J.J. Abrams</b> set the record straight, confirming that the <i>Rise of Skywalker</i><i> </i>runtime, while still over two hours, doesn’t exceed <i>The Last Jedi</i>‘s length.</p>
      <p>When <i>Rise of Skywalker</i> tickets went on sale <a href="https://www.slashfilm.com/longest-star-wars-movie/">last month</a>, ticket sites were reporting the movie’s runtime as 2 hours, 35 minutes. If that were true, it would make <i>The Rise of Skywalker</i> the longest film in the series:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Last Jedi – 2 hours, 32 minutes</li>
        <li>Attack of the Clones – 2 hours, 22 minutes</li>
        <li>Revenge of the Sith – 2 hours, 20 minutes</li>
        <li>The Force Awakens – 2 hours, 15 minutes</li>
        <li>The Phantom Menace – 2 hours, 13 minutes</li>
        <li>Return of the Jedi – 2 hours, 12 minutes</li>
        <li>The Empire Strikes Back – 2 hours, 4 minutes</li>
        <li>Star Wars – 2 hours, 1 minute</li>
      </ul>
      <p>But, as it turns out, that number was inaccurate. Speaking with <a href="https://ew.com/movies/2019/11/25/rise-of-skywalker-running-time/">EW</a>, J.J. Abrams revealed the runtime is a bit shorter. According to Abrams, the film is “two hours and 21 minutes.” Abrams also added “I believe” to this statement, which means he might be off by a few minutes. But either way, it sounds like the film is not longer than the 2 hour and 32-minute runtime of <i>The Last Jedi</i>. In fact, even <i>Attack of the Clones</i> appears to be longer.</p>
      <p>This means everyone out there writing their “here is when you should go to the bathroom during <i>The Rise of Skywalker</i>” think-pieces should just call it quits right now and move on. You can handle 2 hours and 21-minutes, right? If you sat through a little over three hours of <i>Avengers: Endgame</i>, surely you can sit through an even shorter final entry in the Skywalker Saga.</p>
      <p><i>Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</i> opens <b>December 20</b>.</p>
      <blockquote>The surviving Resistance faces the First Order once more as Rey, Finn and Poe Dameron’s journey continues. With the power and knowledge of generations behind them, the final battle commences.</blockquote>
