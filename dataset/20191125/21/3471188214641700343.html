      <p>Who doesn’t love cheaper stuff? One thing we keep an eye out for ere at Ausdroid is discounted Google Play cards, as it effectively drops the price of services purchased through Google Play. Paying for Disney+ via in-app subscription, or YouTube Premium, Google One it’s all cheaper with discounted cards.</p>

      <p>Typically you only get 15% off direct sales these days but Woolworth’s latest trick with their gift cards is to give you bonus reward points. This week’s offer is 2000 points for a $50 card, those 2000 points can then be redeemed for $10 off on your next shop effectively giving you a 20% discount. The catch obviously is that you have to have a Woolworth’s rewards card and shop at Woolworths another time to get your discount.</p>
      <p>However, 20% off is 20% off however you slice it.</p>
