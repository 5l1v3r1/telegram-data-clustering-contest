      <p>In another case on the same day, officers inspected the checked-in baggage of a 27-year-old man and 26-year-old woman who had arrived in Hong Kong from Brussels on the same flight. </p>
      <p>Upon inspection of their baggage, around 10.3kg of suspected ketamine and about 3.2kg of suspected cocaine were found. </p>
      <p>The two suspects were subsequently arrested and investigations into both cases are ongoing. </p>
