      <p>The leader of the banned Indigenous People Of Biafra (IPOB) Nnamdi Kanu has vowed to defend the Chairman of Air Peace Allen Onyema over fraud charges against him, Concise News reports.</p>
      <p>Concise News had reported that <a href="https://www.concisenews.global/2019/11/23/air-peace-chairman-onyema-indicted-for-20m-fraud-in-us/">the United States Department of Justice indicted Onyema</a> for moving more than $20 million from Nigeria through US bank accounts in a scheme involving false documents based on the purchase of aeroplanes.</p>
      <p>According to a statement posted on the US Justice department’s website, Air Peace Chief of Administration and Finance, Ejiroghene Eghagha, was also charged with bank fraud and committing aggravated identity theft in connection with the scheme.</p>
      <p>U.S. Attorney Byung J. Pak, said: “Onyema allegedly leveraged his status as a prominent business leader and airline executive while using falsified documents to commit fraud.</p>
      <p>“We will diligently protect the integrity of our banking system from being corrupted by criminals, even when they disguise themselves in a cloak of international business.”</p>
      <p>The Special Agent in Charge of the DEA Atlanta Field Division, Robert J. Murphy, said: “Allen Onyema’s status as a wealthy businessman turned out to be a fraud.</p>
      <p>“He corrupted the U.S. banking system, but his trail of deceit and trickery came to a skidding halt.</p>
      <p>“DEA would like to thank the many law enforcement partners and the subsequent prosecution by the U.S. Attorney’s Office who aided in making this investigation a success.”</p>
      <p>While speaking in a live broadcast on Radio Biafra, Nnamdi Kanu said IPOB would defend Onyema.</p>
      <p>He said: “We shall defend Allen Onyema and he will be the last Amnesty we shall Grant to anybody who lies against IPOB or myself [sic].”</p>
      <p>“I will meet with people that matter most in this case in the USA. And if the FBI fails to Investigate the names we are going to submit to them, then we shall start a case of victimization with them.”</p>
