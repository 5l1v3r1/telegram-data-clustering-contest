      <h1>Manager keen to extend Nottingham Forest youngster's loan spell but admits others could show interest</h1>
      <h2>Latest Nottingham Forest transfer news | The 21-year-old midfielder is on loan at the League Two club until January</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T21:04:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 21:04</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Wakefield</a></address>
      <p>Port Vale boss John Askey is hopeful <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Nottingham Forest</a> will extend Jake Taylor’s loan deal at the club.</p>
      <p>The 21-year-old joined the League Two side on a short-term loan deal in the summer which currently runs until January.</p>
      <p>So far this season, the versatile midfielder has scored five goals and provided one assist for his Vale team mates in 17 appearances in all competitions.</p>
      <p>His last outing saw the young midfielder score his side’s only goal in the Valiants’ 2-1 defeat at Scunthorpe United.</p>
      <p>Vale are hoping to persuade Forest to extend the loan until the end of the campaign but Askey says other clubs could take an interest.</p>
      <p>"Hopefully. It will depend if anybody comes in for him,” Askey told <a href="https://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/port-vale-fans-been-brilliant-3575360">Stoke-on-Trent Live</a>, when asked if he hoped to keep told of Taylor for the remainder of the season.</p>

      <p>“He has scored again and played reasonably well so the more he does that the more difficult it becomes."</p>
      <p>On Taylor's loan spell as a whole, Askey said: "He has done really well and hopefully we can get something sorted."</p>
