          <p>For San Antonio Spurs, the predicament of facing unprecedented failure after rampant success has been a rather unfortunate one. What began as the ideal season for the side has taken no time in going on a downward slump with the side slipping from the echelons of Western Conference to find themselves in 11th place ahead of making an advent into today’s clash.</p>
          <p>However, they’ll be turning to their foregone encounter as a source of inspiration, a match which finally catered to the side’s much yearned for aspirations of a win finally coming to an end as they putdown New York Knocks 111-104. It was a much needed win for the side in a period where they were left bereft of any kind of solace with their opponents finding it way too easy to make light work of them.</p>

                <p>And as they look to further wrench out of their impasse, the side couldn’t have asked for a more arduous test than the one they have been dished out today. Squaring off against Los Angeles Lakers, the side are taking on the runaway conference leaders, a side who furthered their position atop of the points tally with a humdinger of a 109-108 win over Memphis Grizzlies the last time around.</p>
                <p>It was a result which embodied the kind of resolve, will and valour prevelant in the unit as they clutched onto straws in the closing stages of the match to pull off a gusty and gritty win. It’s one which will make San Antonito Spurs extremely jittery, a match which looks set to be a foregone conclusion before the encounter even gets underway.</p>

                            <h3>SAS Vs LAL Dream11 Point Guard</h3>
                            <p>Ever since having a solid world cup, Patty Mills has been a consistent and bankable name for San Antonio Spurs as well to see us venture in with the point guard for today’s impending contest. The player will be tasked with carrying the ball for his side and transitioning it from defence to attack as he turnovers possession fruitfully and looks to convert it into points.</p>
                            <h3>SAS Vs LAL Dream11 Shooting Guard </h3>
                            <p>It’s a cheap selection for us over here but a much needed one given the staggering amount of money we need to shelve out for the standout players in the ensuing slots of our Dream 11 side. Trey Daniels at shooting guard is someone who offers good value with the player bound to get some time out on the court and pick up pints courtesy of his exuberant expertise.</p>
                            <h3>SAS Vs LAL Dream11 Small Forward</h3>
                            <p>With 10.8 assists per match, LeBron James has continued to remain a talisman of his side’s framework of illustrious success. The player has not only cantered down the court for his side but pulled off attacking plays to layup the ball articulately for hs counterparts to see us bring him in from Los Angeles Lakers.</p>
                            <p>Another player who has emerged as a fulcrum of the side is Kentavious Caldwell-Pope with the player immensely thriving this season in what looks set to be a breakthrough campaign for him. The small forward has opened up the zone outside the circle for himself adequately to rope in a hoard of triples for himself, a narrative we see him emoting us to today as well.</p>
                            <h3>SAS Vs LAL Dream11 Power Forward</h3>
                            <p>A regulation pick for this encounter, Anthony Davis has undoubtedly been the talisman of his side’s unit this season. A staggering 25.5 points paired with the 8.8 rebounds are enough to allude the kind of sensational work he’s carried out for the unit with the power forward being the focal point of all of the side’s attacking sojourns.</p>
                            <p>We will be partnered by Trey Lyles for this encounter with the player getting an escalated time out on the court after some solid performances off late.</p>
                            <h3>SAS Vs LAL Dream11 Centre</h3>
                            <p>We had to begin this slot of our Dream 11 side with LaMarcus Aldridge from the home side given the 6.8 rebounds per encounter he’s managed to dole out for his unit. The number is one which resonates the kind of defensive work the centre has been part of for his side with his fight and character being required today if his side are to have any chance of salvaging a win from this one.</p>
                            <p>From the other side of the facet, Javale McGee comes in for us to wrap proceedings for our Dream 11 side for this encounter.</p>
                            <h3>Star Player</h3>
                            <p>Davis has always been our side’s captain when he’s featuring and the same discourse continues today.</p>
