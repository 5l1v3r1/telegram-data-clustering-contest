      <p>ALAMEDA, Calif. — Raiders wide receiver Hunter Renfrow suffered a ribs injury Sunday that will keep him out for “a while,” coach Jon Gruden said Monday.</p>
      <p>NFL Network reported Renfrow suffered a broken rib and punctured lung. Gruden declined to go into specifics on the injury or set a specific timetable for Renfrow’s potential return, saying the wide receiver has more tests to undergo.</p>
      <p>Still, Gruden called Renfrow’s injury “a big, big loss for us.”</p>
      <p>“We’ve had a lot of turnover at that position this year. It’s really too bad,” Gruden said. “I’ll say this — Renfrow is going to be a great Raider. He’s really been playing good for us.”</p>
      <p>A fifth-round rookie out of Clemson, Renfrow had become one of Carr’s critical targets at wide receiver — particularly on third down. Of Renfrow’s 36 receptions for 396 yards, 16 catches for 216 and both of Renfrow’s touchdowns came on third down, resulting in 13 first downs.</p>
      <p>Renfrow caught three passes for 31 yards on five targets during Sunday’s loss. He initially went down after sustaining a hit on an incomplete pass midway through the second quarter. Renfrow re-entered the game, and ended up playing a total of 42 percent of the Raiders’ offensive snaps.</p>
      <p>With Renfrow injured, Gruden mentioned wide receiver Keelan Doss, tight end Darren Waller, tight end Derek Carrier and wide receiver Zay Jones as candidates to play slot receiver.</p>
      <p>“We’ll see who we plug in there as we prepare for the Chiefs,” Gruden said.</p>
