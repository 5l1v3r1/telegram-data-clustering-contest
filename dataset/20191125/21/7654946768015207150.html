      <h1>Ravens vs. Rams betting decision: How much Baltimore’s big wins should sway you</h1>

      <p>Have the Baltimore Ravens become the best team in pro football?</p>
      <p>Betting markets aren’t quite pricing them that way heading into Monday night’s TV attraction on the road at the Los Angeles Rams (8:20 p.m., ESPN).</p>
      <p>But, if you’re strictly looking at recent on-field performance, there’s little debate. In their past four games, the Ravens have crushed a fairly difficult schedule.</p>
      <p>Sure, the Cincinnati Bengals didn’t represent much of a test. Baltimore’s other three wins came against playoff contenders with a combined record of 19-4 at kickoff. Those three victories over top opposition came by a combined 108-43 margin. The Ravens just beat teams playing .826 football by an average of three touchdowns per game!</p>
      <p>A quick review of the Ravens past month:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Baltimore (+3) won at Seattle 30-16. The final score is a bit of a red herring. The Ravens had two defensive touchdowns. But, they did rush for 199 yards and gain 6.1 yards per play on the road at a loud site.</li>
        <li>Baltimore (+3) beat defending Super Bowl champion and projected top AFC seed New England, 37-20. The Ravens took full advantage of a bye week to prepare, winning total yardage 372-342, yards-per-play 5.7 to 5.3, and rushing yards 210-74. Baltimore turned all four red-zone trips into touchdowns, then added another defensive score.</li>
        <li>Baltimore (-10¹/₂) stomped Cincinnati, 49-13. How about 8.2 yards-per-play, 67 percent on third-down conversion attempts, and 100 percent once again in the red zone?</li>
        <li>Baltimore (-4) humbled Houston, 41-7. Some of this may be attributed to Houston thinking more about a huge divisional game scheduled a few days later. But, the Ravens put on a true clinic, winning yardage 491-232, yards-per-play 7.7 to 4.1, rushing yards 263-122, while cashing in five touchdown drives of 70 yards or more.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>That’s four double-digit wins that covered their point spreads by 19, 20, 25¹/₂, and 30 points.</p>

      <p>When handicapping Ravens-Rams, or thinking about the futures board, should bettors focus on the gaudy stats above, or extenuating circumstances such as a 4-0 edge in non-offensive touchdowns … a bye week ahead of New England … catching Houston distracted … and so on?</p>
      <p>The point spread spent a week expressing that very dilemma, hopping between Ravens -3 and -3¹/₂ .</p>
      <p>Quants see an offensive mismatch against the recently struggling Rams, who have turned the ball over six times while converting just four of 24 third-down tries their past two games. And, the public loves betting hot teams at cheap prices.</p>
      <p>Dog lovers make their case with money whenever the hook shows up. Long-time bettors are always on the lookout for overreactions. They’d point out that the Rams would have been favored by -3 or -3¹/₂ if this game were played a month ago (the price range for Ravens-Seahawks), and closer to a touchdown in September. They’ll take a defensive ’dog at +3¹/₂ against a regression-due favorite that had to travel cross-country in an emotional letdown spot.</p>
      <p>No trophies are given for being the best team in November. Let’s see if Baltimore is Lombardi ready.</p>
