      <p><b>MANILA —</b> Philippine soldiers on Monday rescued a British man and his wife from militants linked with Daesh (the so-called IS) nearly two months after the couple was kidnapped from their beach resort in the nation's south, authorities said.<br/><br/>Troops recovered the pair after a firefight with gunmen from the Abu Sayyaf group on the restive southern island of Jolo, which is a stronghold of the kidnap-for-ransom gang that has been behind some of the worst attacks in the Philippines.<br/><br/>"There was a brief exchange of fire, but they later abandoned the couple after being overwhelmed by pursuing government forces," Lieutenant General Cirilito Sobejana said, adding the hostages were unharmed.<br/><br/>Regional army spokesman Arvin Encinas said no ransom was paid.<br/><br/>The British embassy in Manila confirmed the rescue of Alan and Wilma Hyrons, saying in a statement "we extend our gratitude to the government and authorities of the Philippines".<br/><br/>Armed men abducted the couple on Oct. 4 at their beach resort on the southern island of Mindanao, which makes up the southern third of the Philippines.<br/><br/>Muslim separatists have led a decades-long insurgency in the south of the Catholic-majority Philippines, which has led to the death of tens of thousands of people.<br/><br/>While the government has negotiated peace with the largest group, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, hard-line factions allied with Daesh are not part of the accord.<br/><br/>Daesh claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing of a Sunday mass in January at a Catholic cathedral on Jolo which killed 21 in the country's worst attack in years.<br/><br/>Authorities blamed the bombing on Abu Sayyaf, which in part funds its violence with ransom payments.<br/><br/>Dutch birdwatcher Ewold Horn, who was kidnapped in 2012 in the southern Philippines, was killed in May during a firefight between his Abu Sayyaf captors and the military. — AFP</p>
