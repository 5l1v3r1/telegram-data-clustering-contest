      <p>Shares of CVS Health Corp. rose after a report that activist investment firm Starboard Value LP had taken a small stake in the drugstore chain and held talks with management.</p>
      <p>Shares of the company, which runs almost 10,000 drugstores across the U.S., closed up 1.7 per cent Monday after the the Wall Street Journal’s report.</p>
      <p>The Journal described the stake in CVS as small, and said the two firms had held amicable discussions. Representatives for Starboard and CVS didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>
      <p>CVS has been transforming itself into a vertically integrated health-care company, with a pharmacy-benefit management unit and a health insurer, Aetna. It’s also transforming stores into so-called health hubs, where people can get medical services.</p>
