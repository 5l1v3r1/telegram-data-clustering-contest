      <p>The subject line of the third email reads: “Action required on your application.” The body of the email was blank.</p>
      <p>In a statement sent to Business Insider shortly after the publication of this story, a Synchrony spokesperson said: “Synchrony is aware of an unplanned notification that was distributed in error to some consumers. The email sent in error did not include any customer data or personal information. We are currently investigating the notification and the root cause.”</p>
      <p>The spokesperson said the messages were an internal error and “did not involve a data breach or fraudulent activity.”</p>
      <p>Amazon also said it was aware of the issue.</p>
      <p>“Amazon is aware of a notification that was distributed by Synchrony in error to some customers,” an Amazon spokesperson told Business Insider. “They are investigating the root cause. Additional inquiries can be sent to Synchrony.”</p>
      <p>Laurie Voss said he received the emails on Monday and found them alarming.</p>
      <p>“Because I didn’t sign up for anything, and it talks about trial deposits … the whole thing looks highly alarming,” Voss said.</p>
      <p>He said he didn’t have an Amazon credit-builder account, but he does have an Amazon store card.</p>
      <p>Many others found the messages alarming and suspected fraudulent activity, according to social-media posts. People also reported having trouble getting through to Synchrony Bank’s customer-service phone lines.</p>
