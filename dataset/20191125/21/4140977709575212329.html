                            <h3>QUN vs WAU Dream11 Wicket-Keeper</h3>
                            <p>Josh Phillipe scored just 22 runs the last time around but the knock was enough to show why he’s an instrumental component of his side’s batting order. The opener has been in sublime and pristine form, sending bowlers departing with disdain with his dauntless brand of batting being at the forefront of his outfit’s consummate success.</p>
                            <h3>QUN vs WAU Dream11 Batsmen</h3>
                            <p>After staying unbeaten on 86 runs the last time around for his side, Usman Khawaja from Queensland Bulls is being brought into our side’s setup as the first player for this encounter. Number 3 bat Matthew Renshaw comes in as well from the unit with the player being someone who has imbibed in him a slew of shots, someone who can not only hold fort for the side but pile on runs at a quick rate as well for his setup.</p>
                            <p>From Western Australia meanwhile we have decided to rope in D’Arcy Short with the side’s opener being one of ther most dependable and flawless bat. The player has been in imperious touch with his tenacity seeing him rope in a slew of runs for his side to make the player an instant pick for us.</p>
                            <h3>QUN vs WAU Dream11 All-Rounders</h3>
                            <p>We compensate for the batting picks from western Australia into his docket of our Dream 11 setup with Marcus Stoinis being the first name to be roped in by us. While the player has been good with the bat, his role with the bat offers additional value to his selection with the player snaring the two wickets the last time around to further hammer down this rhetoric.</p>
                            <p>Ashton Agar comes in owing to his spin as well while Hilton Cartwright earns his spot in our unit after scoring 43 pivotal runs in the lower middle-order, a knock which not only held fort at a time when wickets were tumbling but adding match winning runs to his side’s score.</p>
                            <h3>QUN vs WAU Dream11 Bowling Order</h3>
                            <p>His man of the match spell of 5-48 sees us maraud Nathan Coulter-Nile into our Dream 11 outfit for this match. The pacer from western Australia was in titillating form the last time around as he sent down an ominous brand of space, one which engulfed the opposition in a tiff. The quick will immensely enjoy the bounce and pace he extracts from this wicket with the ball moving both ways for him, something we envision heralding his was a solid amount of wickets in this encounter.</p>
                            <p>Jhye Richardson comes in as well from the unit whilst from the other side of the docket we are moving in for a duo as well in the form of Xavier Bartlett and Mark Steketee. Both the bowlers retuned with the three wickets apiece for the side the last time around as they sent down ominous spells to induce an exodus of wickets by adding the a tenacious influx to leave batsmen perturbed. </p>
