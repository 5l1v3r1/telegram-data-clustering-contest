      <h1>Alexa Wi-Fi Access is Amazon’s answer to Nest Wifi voice controls</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T21:40:49+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 21:40</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://venturebeat.com/author/kylewiggers/" target="_blank">Kyle Wiggers</a></address>
      <p>If you’ve been lusting after <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/10/15/google-takes-the-wraps-off-nest-wifi-router-and-nest-wifi-point-with-google-assistant-built-in/">Google Wifi</a> and the new <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/11/04/nest-mini-vs-nest-wifi-point-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-dedicated-ml-chip/">Nest Wifi’s</a> voice-activated features, good news: Alexa will soon enable something comparable. Amazon today announced that Alexa Wi-Fi Access, a feature that allows customers with supported routers to add Alexa voice control to their devices, is now rolling out to owners of Eero routers and network extenders.</p>
      <p>Starting today, Eero customers can add Alexa control by navigating to the Devices tab in the Alexa companion app, adding their router, and following the on-screen prompts. Once it’s set up, they’ll be able to use Alexa via a smart speaker, smart display, or app to pause or unpause Wi-Fi access for individual devices or groups of devices, and to schedule Wi-Fi access times and control guest access.</p>
      <p>Amazon says additional support for TP-Link, Asus, Arris Surfboard, and Linksys routers will arrive in the coming months. Here’s a few examples of supported commands:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>“Alexa, pause the Wi-Fi for 30 minutes”</li>
        <li>“Alexa, turn off the Wi-Fi for Sarah”</li>
        <li>“Alexa, unpause the Xbox Wi-Fi”</li>
        <li>“Alexa, turn on the guest Wi-Fi”</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Of course, Alexa control for routers and networking devices isn’t <i>completely</i> unheard of. Indeed, Netgear, Asus, TP-Link, Linksys, and other manufacturers offer voice apps with much the same functionality as Amazon Wi-Fi Access. For example, Netgear’s Alexa skill lets customers switch on or disable guest networks, reveal a network’s password, reboot a router, or surface Wi-Fi configuration settings with voice. The idea behind this new Alexa feature, then, is to eliminate the need to invoke a third-party app or skill.</p>
      <p>Also worth noting: Google Assistant supports similar commands (.e.g., “OK Google, turn on the guest network,” “OK Google, what are my Wi-Fi settings,” “OK Google, reboot the router”) on select third-party devices. However, certain commands — like those governing parental controls and network speed tests — are only supported on products in the Google Wifi and Nest Wifi families.</p>
