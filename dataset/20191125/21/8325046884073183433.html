          <b>Global Entry is a fantastic way to save time every time you enter the US.</b>

          <b>Unfortunately, Global Entry isn’t free.</b>

          <b>While I believe it’s worth the price for frequent travelers, you might as well use a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/best-credit-card-reward-program">credit card</a> that will reimburse you for the fee, like the <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/card-details/chase-sapphire-reserve/?utm_campaign=bi_cl_022719_eight-best-cards-global-entry-fee&amp;amp;utm_source=referral">Chase Sapphire Reserve</a> or the <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/card-details/the-platinum-card-from-american-express/?utm_campaign=bi_cl_022719_eight-best-cards-global-entry-fee&amp;amp;utm_source=referral">Platinum Card® from American Express.</a></b>

      <p>Frequent travelers know that having TSA PreCheck or Global Entry makes your airport experience significantly more pleasant, especially during peak travel times.</p>
      <p>Some of the top travel cards – include the <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/card-details/chase-sapphire-reserve/?utm_campaign=bi_cl_022719_eight-best-cards-global-entry-fee&amp;amp;utm_source=referral">Chase Sapphire Reserve</a> and the <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/card-details/the-platinum-card-from-american-express/?utm_campaign=bi_cl_022719_eight-best-cards-global-entry-fee&amp;amp;utm_source=referral">Platinum Card from American Express</a> – will reimburse you for the cost of the Global Entry application (which includes access to TSA PreCheck), up to $100.</p>
      <p>Global Entry lasts approximately five years, and all the cards on this list cover the cost of your application when you need to renew.</p>
      <p>Here are eight top credit cards that cover Global Entry or TSA PreCheck.</p>
      <p>
        <i>Keep in mind that we’re focusing on the rewards and perks that make these credit cards great options, not things like interest rates and late fees, which will far outweigh the value of any points or miles. It’s important to practice financial discipline when using credit cards by paying your balances in full each month, making payments on time, and only spending what you can afford to pay back.</i>
