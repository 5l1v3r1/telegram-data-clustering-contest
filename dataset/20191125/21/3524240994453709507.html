      <h1>UPDATED: Court grants Maina N1bn bail</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T21:15:19+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 21:15</time> by <a rel="author">Agency Report</a></address>
      <p>The Federal High Court, Abuja, on Monday admitted Abdulrasheed Maina, former Chairman, defunct Pension Reform Task Team, to a bail in the sum of N1bn.</p>
      <p>Justice Okon Abang who gave the ruling also ordered that Maina must produce two sureties who must be serving senators.</p>
      <p>The two lawmakers, according to the judge, must not be standing any criminal trial in any court in the country.</p>
      <p>He also ruled that the two sureties, who must be prepared for a N500m bond each, must always be in court with the defendant at each adjourned date.</p>
      <p>The ex-pension reform boss is standing trial on alleged money laundering charge involving over N2bn preferred against him by the EFCC,</p>
      <p>The <i>News Agency of Nigeria</i> reports that Maina, who came into Court 6 at the second floor of the building at about 9:40am, supported himself with a walking stick.</p>
      <p>Justice Abang had, on November 21, fixed Monday (today) for hearing on the bail application and for continuation of Maina’s trial.</p>
      <p>The judge accused the Nigerian Correctional Services of compounding the issue before the court by failing to produce a medical report on Maina’s health status days after the order to that effect was made.</p>
      <p>He ruled that the trial would be on a day-to-day basis in subsequent proceedings.</p>
      <p>NAN recalls that Maina’s trial was stalled in the last adjourned date due to his worsening health condition.</p>
      <p>The EFCC had, on October 25, charged the defendant before the court alongside his firm, Common Input Property and Investment Ltd.</p>
      <p>He pleaded not guilty to the 12 counts and his trial has yet to make meaningful progress due to his failing health.</p>
