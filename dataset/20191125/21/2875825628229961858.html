      <h2>I'm A Celebrity viewers praised Caitlyn Jenner for getting Ian Wright the roast he deserved after missing out in the latest trial</h2>

      <p>I'm A Celebrity's Caitlyn Jenner defied the rules to bring Ian Wright some roast into the jungle after he was told he wasn't allowed any.</p>
      <p>All the contestants minus Myles Stephenson, Kate Garraway, Andy Whyment and Nadine Coyle took part in a live trial hosted by Ant and Dec on Sunday.</p>
      <p>They had the option to win a roast dinner for all 12 campmates, but unfortunately Roman Kemp and James Haskell failed to secure Andy, Ian and Cliff Parisi a meal after failing the final challenge.</p>
      <p>But that didn't stop Caitlyn from doing what was right in the latest episode, deciding that if Ian couldn't be taken to the roast, the roast would be taken to Ian.</p>

      <p>As all the campmates dwelled on the fact that three of their co-stars were missing out, Caitlyn had an idea.</p>
      <p>Believing after what he went through in the live task that Ian should have got his dinner, Caitlyn hid some chicken and corn on the cob in her trouser pocket.</p>
      <p>As she headed back to Main Camp, she greeted Ian in his hammock with a surprise.</p>

      <p>Handing over the goods, she told him what she'd done leaving him super pleased.</p>
      <p>He quickly chomped down the food having been left with rice and beans just hours earlier.</p>
      <p>Viewers loved the moment, as they continued to protest that football legend Ian should have had a roast.</p>
