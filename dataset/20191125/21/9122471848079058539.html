      <h1>Adrian Martinez Comments On Nebraska’s Game vs. Iowa</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T21:30:13+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 21:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/alekarend" target="_blank">Alek Arend</a></address>
      <p>Nebraska is in serious jeopardy of ending the season with seven losses, meaning the Huskers wouldn’t qualify for a bowl game. Head coach Scott Frost and quarterback Adrian Martinez are going to try and do everything they can to avoid a season-ending loss against No. 17 Iowa on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Martinez isn’t going to shy away from the challenge against the Hawkeyes. In fact, the Nebraska QB is well aware of what’s at stake on Saturday.</p>
      <p>“It’s obvious what’s at stake for us this week, but our guys are focused,” Martinez said, via <a href="https://twitter.com/HuskerExtraPG/status/1199025377735303176">Parker Gabriel of Husker Extra</a>.</p>

      <p>It’s a good thing Martinez and the Huskers are aware of what’s ahead of them. Win, and you go bowling. Lose, and your season is over.</p>
      <p>Iowa will certainly be up for the challenge as well. Any chance a team gets to play in Husker territory is a big deal, and the Hawkeyes will look to capitalize on the moment.</p>
      <p>The Huskers will salvage any momentum they can on Saturday. Nebraska is coming off a lopsided 54-7 victory over Maryland last Saturday. Will Martinez and this Huskers offense be able to have success against Iowa?</p>
      <p>Iowa-Nebraska kicks off at 2:30 p.m. ET on Big Ten Network. The Hawkeyes have won four straight against the Huskers.</p>
