      <p>At WWE <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/wwe-survivor-series">Survivor Series 2019</a>, the reigning NXT North American Champion <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/roderick-strong">Roderick Strong</a> defeated AJ Styles and <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/shinsuke-nakamura">Shinsuke Nakamura</a> in a triple-threat match to win an important point for the Black and Gold brand.</p>
      <p>This match saw the three champions locking horns in an exciting encounter that was well-balanced through its entire duration. In the end, Strong eked out a victory by outsmarting both his opponents.</p>
      <p>The closing moments of the match saw Styles taking down Nakamura with a 'Phenomenal Forearm'. At that time Strong was right outside the ring, taking his time to recover from the beat-down he had received.</p>
      <p>The Undisputed Era member then quickly spotted the right moment to enter the ring and went on to push Styles towards the ringside. He then pinned the 'King of Strong Style' to win the match and turn the tide in favor of NXT.</p>
      <p>Following the conclusion of Survivor Series, Nakamura took to Twitter to congratulate Strong but added that the latter got lucky and might have 'to pay' for it soon. He also fired a warning at Styles and said that their paths might cross again.</p>
      <p>Nakamura's tweet read:</p>
      <p>"Congrats @roderickstrong.but it was just lucky. You'll pay for this soon maybe. @AJStylesOrg, we’re not done yet. Anyway I was standing tall in the ring.... tallest. #SurvivorSeries #RAW #SmackDown #NXT #AnStupidEra"</p>

      <p>Strong, who picked a convincing victory in the match, was quick to respond to this message from the Intercontinental Champion. He said that he is prepared to lock horns with Nakamura in a singles match, and that that would be enough to prove whether his victory was indeed due to good 'luck'.</p>
      <blockquote>"I am open to a 1 on 1 match up any time my friend. Let’s see if it was luck!", said Strong.</blockquote>

      <p>This would indeed be a dream match, with the potential to tear the house down no matter what the circumstances. Now that Survivor Series is over the chances of watching this match are bleak, but it is good to know that both these Superstars are interested in meeting once again inside the squared circle.</p>
