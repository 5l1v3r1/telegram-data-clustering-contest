      <h1>Rejoice: ‘Sex Education’ Is Coming Back To Netflix For A Second Season</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T21:03:04+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 21:03</time> by <a rel="author">Joseph Earp</a></address>
      <p>There’s no two ways about it: <a href="https://junkee.com/tag/sex-education"><i>Sex Education</i></a> was one of the stand-out hits of 2019.</p>
      <p>A delightfully kind-hearted and comedic coming-of-age story, the show stood out in an overcrowded streaming market thanks to the sheer intelligence and emotional honesty of its storytelling. You can save your multi-million dollar budgets and cliff-hanger story style. <i>Sex Education</i> works because it tells a compelling tale with kindness.</p>
      <p>Starring Asa Butterfield, a child star best known for his role in sci-fi extravaganza <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game_(film)"><i>Ender’s Game</i></a>, and Gillian Anderson of <i>The X-Files</i>, the show was a monumental success with critics and audiences.</p>

      <p>Given all that, it was only a matter of time before the show was renewed for a second season.</p>
      <p>And guess what: that renewal has just been made official today. Yep, <i>Sex Education</i> is coming back for another serving.</p>
      <p>Exact details on the plot for the new season are a little vague, but we do know that it’ll focus around Otis’s strained friendship with Maeve, and his ongoing relationship with Ola. Oh, and that’s all happening against the background of a Chlamydia outbreak. So, you know: typical <i>Sex Education</i>-style stuff.</p>
      <p>The second season will hit Netflix on January 17, 2020, with eight new episodes available to stream on that day.</p>
