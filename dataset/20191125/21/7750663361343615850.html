      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/celtic/"><b>Celtic</b></a> have announced a partial closure of Parkhead for Thursday's <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/europa-league/"><b>Europa League</b></a> clash with <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/rennes/"><b>Rennes</b></a> amid ongoing safety concerns.</h2>

      <p>The Scottish champions were fined £12,900 by UEFA on Friday after fans displayed an "illicit banner" and sang obscene chants during their Europa League game at home to <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/lazio/"><b>Lazio</b></a> last month.</p>
      <p>Celtic were also fined £10,400 for supporters setting off flares in the Europa League win over Cluj in October and fined £11,000 for their fans using flares and throwing objects in the play-off second-leg win over AIK in Stockholm in August.</p>
      <p>With another charge hanging over the club for fans using  pyrotechnics during the win over Lazio in Rome on November 7, the Parkhead board have acted and closed rows A to M in the rail seating section of the stadium which holds the club's ultras, the Green Brigade.</p>
      <p>"Celtic has ultimate responsibility for the safety of all our supporters and it is a responsibility which we take very seriously," said a statement on the club's official website.</p>
      <p>"We need to tackle any behaviour which can compromise the safety of our supporters including the use of pyrotechnics, overcrowding and offensive chanting or banners.</p>
      <p>"Following the latest UEFA disciplinary decision we can confirm that there will be a partial closure of the rail seating section at Celtic Park for the forthcoming match against Rennes.</p>
      <p>"All those supporters affected will be notified and will receive a refund.</p>
      <p>"This decision follows similar significant sanctions being imposed against the club already this season for the use of pyrotechnics during the matches against CFR Cluj and AIK Stockholm.</p>
      <p>"The club also faces another UEFA charge for the use of pyrotechnics during the match in Rome recently and this will be heard on 12th December 2019.</p>
      <p>"Regrettably, these charges and sanctions continue to damage the club's reputation and this behaviour continues to threaten supporter safety.</p>
      <p>"UEFA's rules and the club's long-established ground regulations are very clear.</p>
      <p>"Indeed, the club engages in regular dialogue with all supporters groups to ensure these are well known and understood.</p>
      <p>"We have considered this matter very carefully. It is disappointing that behaviour which is unsafe and which we all know will breach UEFA and club regulations has continued."</p>
