      <p>MADISON, Wis. - These potatoes are wonderful.</p>
      <p>Even when made days ahead of time, the potatoes taste like you just made them.</p>
      <p>They are good to keep on hand in the refrigerator for a quick warming whenever you are in the mood for great mashed potatoes.(Do not freeze.)</p>
      <p>The white pepper is an essential ingredient.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>5 large russet potatoes (2 ½ pounds), peeled and quartered</li>
        <li>1/2 cup fat free milk or milk of your choice</li>
        <li>1/2 cup light or regular sour cream</li>
        <li>3 ounces reduced fat or regular cream cheese</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon white pepper</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In a large saucepan, boil potatoes in salted water until tender. Drain. </p>
      <p>Add milk, sour cream, cream cheese, and white pepper to the potatoes in the saucepan. Using an electric mixer, beat until fluffy. (Do not use a food processor or the potatoes will turn to "glue.") </p>
      <p>Add extra milk if needed for a smooth light consistency. They will thicken a little more after being refrigerated. </p>
      <p>Add additional pepper and salt to taste. Transfer potatoes to a lightly buttered casserole dish. Cover and refrigerate. </p>
      <p>On the day of serving, bring to room temperature and heat covered potatoes in 350 degree oven until hot - about 30 minutes. Time will depend on the size of the casserole dish. The potatoes can also be reheated in a microwave but stir occasionally for more even heating throughout the dish. </p>
      <p>Serves 6. Per serving: </p>
