      <p>“The Good Place” actor was very humble, and a tad gobsmacked, by just how thirsty Twitter is for him. <i>Buzzfeed</i> caught up with the actor who read and reacted to the public’s demand for his abs, arms, pectorals and <i>other</i> body parts.</p>
      <p>“We don’t talk about William Jackson Harper’s arms enough, TBH,” read one tweet. “I’m fine with how much they’re being talked about,” a slightly self-conscious Harper replied. “Totally fine. I don’t mind be objectified but I don’t want to be a d**che bag either.”</p>
      <p>The official YouTube account of “The Good Place” left an amusing comment on the YouTube video: “We thought we were in ‘The Good Place’, but now we’re in The Best Place.”</p>
