      <p>US online giant eBay agreed to sell its ticket marketplace StubHub to Swiss-based rival Viagogo for $4.05 billion in cash, the two firms announced Monday.</p>
      <p>The move will allow Viagogo, which already sells tickets for live sport, music and entertainment events, to boost its footprint to more than 70 countries around the world.</p>
      <p>The deal comes after eBay's leadership change earlier this year and announcement that it was mulling asset sales in the face of slumping profits.</p>
      <p>"We believe this transaction is a great outcome and maximizes long-term value for eBay shareholders," said Scott Schenkel, interim chief executive of eBay, who took over following the departure of CEO Devin Wenig in September.</p>
      <p>"Over the past several months, eBay's leadership team and board of directors have been engaged in a thorough review of our current strategies and portfolio, and we concluded that this was the best path forward for both eBay and StubHub."</p>
      <p>Eric Baker, Viagogo's founder and CEO, also co-founded StubHub while in <a href="https://techxplore.com/tags/business+school/">business school</a>, but left before the business was sold to eBay in 2007.</p>
      <p>"It has long been my wish to unite the two companies," Baker said.</p>
      <p>"I am so proud of how StubHub has grown over the years and excited about the possibilities for our shared future. Buyers will have a wider choice of tickets, and sellers will have a wider network of buyers. Bringing these two companies together creates a win-win for fansâ€”more choice and better pricing."</p>
      <p>eBay is one of the success stories of the early internet period but in recent years it failed to keep pace with rival Amazon.</p>
      <p>In its most recent quarter, eBay profits fell by more than half to $310 million as revenues were virtually flat.</p>
      <p>The companies said the sale is expected to close by the end of the first quarter of 2020, pending regulatory approval.</p>
