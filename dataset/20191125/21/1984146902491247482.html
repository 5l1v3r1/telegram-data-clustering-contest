      <p>Huge Newcastle United supporters &amp; Dec have proved that not even hosting a live TV programme can get in the way of them watching their beloved team by tuning into the Magpies latest match in the jungle.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity</a> hosts took to Instagram and Twitter to reveal they were keeping a form eye on <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/aston-villa-vs-newcastle-live-17302627">Newcastle v Aston Villa</a> on Monday night, minutes before the ITV show went live on air.</p>
      <p>The lads tweeted a picture them in front of the telly and captioned it "Cracking little show for you tonight. I promise we are not distracted by anything and are fully focussed on the show."</p>
      <p>Unfortunately for Ant &amp; Dec, their dedication to following the Magpies wasn't rewarded as, at the time of writing, Steve Bruce's team were 2-0 down, with Conor Hourihane and Anwar El Ghazi scoring for the hosts.</p>
      <p>And United's lacklustre performance didn't go un-noticed by the Geordie duo's many followers, with one quipping "I would just focus on the show if I was you guys," and another having a joke at NUFC and Ant &amp; Dec's expense by commenting "Yes villa :)"</p>
      <p>One of their fans was also watching the game Down Under and posted "I'm watching the game here in oz not happy with the game so far."</p>
      <p>On Monday, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/tv/im-celebrity-ant-dec-trial-17315308">Ant &amp; Dec hit back at claims</a> from many viewers and This Morning host <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/tv/phillip-schofield-im-celebrity-trial-17312970">Phillip Schofield</a> that Sunday night's show was fixed, after the campmates being given an 'impossible' bushtucker trial to complete.</p>
