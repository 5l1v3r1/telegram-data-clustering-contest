      <p>Nollywood screen top shot, Elvin Ibru, on Monday said she would love to meet her 2004 rapist, expressing confidence of seeing the armed robber again.</p>
      <p>Ibru, a star actress who played the role of Mopelola in the blockbuster movie, <i>Lagos Bling,</i> in an interview with the <i>News Agency of Nigeria</i> urged rape victims to speak out.</p>
      <p>She said there was the need for others to learn from her experience.</p>
      <p>“I was raped by an armed robber in 2004. It wasn’t my fault and [it is] not an incident that warrants me taking up microphone about, so I set up an advocacy group to address it.</p>

      <p>“The group is to manage the young and old ones who had been through the same ugly incident like me. I know if I had to go all out to media about the situation, it will fizzle out.</p>
      <p>“However, it is not something I have been silent about; I don’t know the person that raped me, but I will meet him again, I know I will meet him,” she said.</p>

      <p>The multi-talented, actor, producer, director and writer urged Nollywood stakeholders to be professional in their conduct, adding that the industry needs the touch of core professionals.</p>
      <p>“Although I can say that I am not a veteran in the movies because I just spiced up my acting recently, I have been on stage for a long time.</p>
      <p>“What I can bring to the table for my colleagues is that they must be professional with their jobs as much as possible.</p>
      <p>“There are times that we need to up our games as actors, producers and other professions in the film industry; we need to be professional and do things right.</p>
      <p>“The fault in our movies did not just happen because we lack money, they also come with the way we handle things as professionals; though, money is also a big factor.</p>
      <p>“There are other things that are attached to film-making, which we need to look at to move the industry forward,” she said.</p>
