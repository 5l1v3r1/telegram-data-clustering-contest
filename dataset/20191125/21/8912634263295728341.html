      <p>Mohammed Al-Shalhoub is a Saudi football player who currently plays as a left-wing midfielder for Al-Hilal football club in the Saudi Professional League. He is considered to be one of the greatest Saudi footballers ever. </p>
      <p>Born on Dec. 8, 1980 in Riyadh, Al-Shalhoub holds 32 personal championships making him one of the most decorated players in the world.</p>
      <p>His great achievements have earned him the title “the gifted.” He wears the No. 10 jersey.</p>
      <p>In 2000, he was selected as one of the most promising Arab footballers of the year. In 2006, Al-Shalhoub won the title of the third best Asian player of the year and he earned the title of the top scorer of the league in 2009.</p>
      <p>He has been a part of the Saudi national squad since 2000. He made his debut at the age of 20 against Qatar in the 2000 AFC Asian Cup.</p>
      <p>His team, Al-Hilal, beat the Urawa Red Diamonds 2-0 on Sunday and 3-0 on aggregate to claim a record-equaling third Asian club title in the AFC Champions League.</p>
      <p>The Saudi giants have endured a continental trophy drought since 2000 when they won the tournament for the second time, the first being in 1991 when it was called the Asian Club Championship.</p>
      <p>They came close in 2014 and 2017 when they reached the final, only to be beaten by the Western Sydney Wanderers and Urawa respectively.</p>
