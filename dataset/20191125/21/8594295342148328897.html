      <h1>Uber Loses License in London, Deemed Unsafe by Regulator</h1>

      <p>Transportation for London (TfL) announced it has informed Uber that it will not be reissued a license to operate in the UK capitol, citing concerns over customer safety. TfL had previously declined to renew the ride-hailing business’ private hire operator license, which expired on September 30th, saying it was unsatisfied with the number of drivers it found “fit and proper to hold a licence.” Then it changed its mind, offering a two-month extension.</p>
      <p>Now it’s claiming that at least 14,000 Uber trips taken within the city included drivers linked, via their app profiles, to cars they were not legally registered to drive. Having done an impromptu survey of his own (done as unscientifically as possible by just asking drivers if they owned the vehicle), your author found the number of “rogue” Uber drivers in New York City to be about one in five.</p>
      <p>While easily framed as a gotcha moment, that ratio isn’t really any different from what I’ve experienced with NYC’s sanctioned yellow (or green) cabs. But that doesn’t exactly make it a non-issue either — just more of the same. </p>
      <p>From Transportation for London:</p>
      <blockquote>A key issue identified was that a change to Uber’s systems allowed unauthorised drivers to upload their photos to other Uber driver accounts.<br/><br/>This allowed them to pick up passengers as though they were the booked driver, which occurred in at least 14,000 trips — putting passenger safety and security at risk.<br/><br/>This means all the journeys were uninsured and some passenger journeys took place with unlicensed drivers, one of which had previously had their licence revoked by TfL.</blockquote>
      <p>Uber wants to appeal the decision, saying it has made sweeping changes in recent years with safety at the forefront. Despite the TfL recognizing those changes and offering a brief extension of its revoked London license (or licence, if you prefer) from September, it said the agency “does not have confidence that similar issues will not reoccur in the future, which has led it to conclude that the company is not fit and proper at this time.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/25/uber-banned-london-midnight-losing-licence-battle-11213996/"><i>Metro UK</i></a> quoted Helen Chapman, director of licensing, regulation and charging at TfL, as saying, “If they choose to appeal, Uber will have the opportunity to publicly demonstrate to a magistrate whether it has put in place sufficient measures to ensure potential safety risks to passengers are eliminated … If they do appeal, Uber can continue to operate and we will closely scrutinise the company to ensure the management has robust controls in place to ensure safety is not compromised during any changes to the app.”</p>
      <p>London Mayor Sadiq Khan supported TfL’s decision, adding that public safety has been his primary concern for the city. He later <a href="https://twitter.com/MayorofLondon/status/1198908278555774982">released an official statement</a>, followed by condemnation of any persons blaming the regulator for taking action.</p>
      <p>This is just one of many thorns placed into the side of Uber. Here in the United States, the National Transportation Safety Board is hoping to encourage regulators <a href="https://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/2019/11/regulators-mount-up-ntsb-presses-nhtsa-for-better-self-driving-safety/">to take a firmer stance on self-driving laws</a> (after investigating Uber’s fatal accident from 2018) and <a href="https://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/2018/08/from-contractor-to-employee-california-ruling-poised-to-decimate-uber-lyft/">California has been cracking down</a> on the gig economy the company relies on to exist. Considering Uber is still highly unprofitable, these mounting headaches aren’t doing it any favors. Meanwhile, it’s been withdrawing from several sizable markets (mostly in Asia) after losing ground to local startups.</p>
