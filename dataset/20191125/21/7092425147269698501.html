          <b>Met Eireann has issued a weather advisory warning for three counties as Storm Sebastien looks set to finally land in Ireland.</b>

      </p>
      <p>The Tropical Storm is moving north-east from the Atlantic and is set to arrive on these shores on Monday and continue into Tuesday, possibly bringing heavy rain and a risk of flooding.</p>
      <p>The US National Hurricane Centre (NHC) confirmed the Atlantic’s 18th named storm of 2019, which formed last week, had suddenly intensified in strength after it had initially been predicted to weaken quite quickly.</p>
      <p>Earlier this evening <b><a href="https://www.buzz.ie/news/cork-city-council-issues-tidal-flood-warning-storm-sebastien-closes-344144"><i>Cork City Council issued a tidal flood warning</i></a> </b>and now the national forecaster has issued a Weather Advisory for Wexford, Cork and Waterford.</p>
      <p>The warning, which will be valid from 3am until 8pm, on Tuesday states: "A combination of high tides, together with appreciable, but generally sub-warning levels of wind and rain, will produce localised impacts along the south coast during Tuesday."</p>

      <p>Earlier today, <a href="https://www.buzz.ie/news/met-eireann-warns-freezing-temperatures-week-lows-2c-344101"><b><i>Met Éireann warned that freezing temperatures are in store for this week with lows of -2C forecast.</i></b></a></p>
      <p>Met Éireann said: "Rather cloudy and misty today, with just a few bright spells.</p>
      <p>"The rain will become confined to Ulster this morning, with scattered showers elsewhere, a few of these heavy. A few patches of fog also.</p>
      <p>"Top temperatures of 9 to 12 C. Light to moderate southeast breezes will become southwesterly or variable.</p>
      <p>"A few clear spells tonight, but generally misty and cloudy, with patches of fog in places. Scattered showers at first, but wet and windy weather will develop over Munster and south Leinster later in the night.</p>
      <p>"Rain will move northwards tomorrow morning, heavy in places. Brighter, more showery weather will follow from the south.</p>
      <p>"Windy, with strong to gale force southerly winds on southern coasts and fresh to strong easterly winds elsewhere. Top temperatures of 8 to 11 C."</p>

      <p>The forecast continued: "Low pressure will make for further unsettled conditions, rather dull generally with showery spells of rain occurring most days.</p>
      <p>"However, it should become somewhat drier by Friday. Temperatures will be around normal for the first half of the week, with mostly frost free nights, but becoming colder later in the week with frosty nights returning.</p>
      <p>"Outbreaks of rain on Thursday; driest and brightest cross southern counties at first, and later across northern areas. Highs of 8 to 11 degrees, in light to moderate northwest breezes.</p>
      <p>"It will be a cold and mostly dry night, with a risk of frost. Lowest temperatures of -2 to +3 degrees.</p>
      <p>"Continuing mostly dry, with some sunny spells developing. Cool, with lowest temperatures of 5 to 8 degrees.</p>
      <p>"Dry with clear spells at first on Friday night, but rain possibly moving into the southwest later in the night."</p>
