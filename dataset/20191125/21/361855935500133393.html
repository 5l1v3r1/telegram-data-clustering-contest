      <h4>Aries</h4>
      <p>You should let go of your anger at people who have wronged you. You should accept they screwed up and accept they’re out of your life for good.</p>
      <h4>Taurus</h4>
      <p>You should let go of your cynicism. You should let yourself believe in love again, let yourself believe in happiness again.</p>
      <h4>Gemini</h4>
      <p>You should let go of your guilt. You should stop blaming yourself for mistakes you made years ago, mistakes you cannot fix now.</p>
      <h4>Cancer</h4>
      <p>You should let go of your desire to please everyone. You have to accept that you aren’t in charge of everyone else’s happiness, only your own.</p>
      <h4>Leo</h4>
      <p>You should let go of your addiction to social media. You should put down your phone and stop comparing yourself to people you haven’t seen since high school.</p>
      <h4>Virgo</h4>
      <p>You should let go of your desire to be right all the time. Embrace the fact that you don’t know everything.</p>
      <h4>Libra</h4>
      <p>You should let go of your self-doubt. You should stop holding yourself back because you’re acting as your own biggest critic.</p>
      <h4>Scorpio</h4>
      <p>You should let go of your grudges. You should put your past in the past.</p>
      <h4>Sagittarius</h4>
      <p>You should let go of your fears. You should break free from your comfort zone and take more chances.</p>
      <h4>Capricorn</h4>
      <p>You should let go of your expectations. Stop assuming you need to reach a certain milestone by a certain point in time.</p>
      <h4>Aquarius</h4>
      <p>You should let go of your toxic friendships. It doesn’t matter whether you’ve known this person for years, because if they’re unhealthy for you, they’ve got to go.</p>
      <h4>Pisces</h4>
      <p>You should let go of your worry about the future. You should focus on what <i>today</i> holds instead of jumping too far ahead.</p>
