      <p>Baker passed away last month at the age of 80.</p>
      <p>He founded Cream in 1966 with Clapton and bassist Jack Bruce. The trio released four albums including the influential ‘Disraeli Gears’ before splitting in 1968. Baker and Clapton went on to play in Blind Faith with Steve Winwood of Traffic and Family bassist Ric Grech, who lasted only one self-titled album.</p>
      <p>After his band Air Force recorded two albums in 1970, Baker released 18 solo albums, most recently ‘Why’ in 2014. He has also made three albums with Fela Kuti. The father-of-three endured a long battle with heroin addiction, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jan/05/ginger-baker-cream-interview">telling <i>The Guardian</i></a> in 2013 he had come off the drug “29 times”.</p>
