      <h1>Shania Twain Makes Rare Appearance With Husband At AMAs Nearly A Decade After A Shocking Scandal Ruined Both Of Their Previous Marriages</h1>

      <p>Country music legend <a href="https://celebrityinsider.org/shania-twain-announces-new-residency-in-las-vegas-293351/">Shania Twain</a> made a rare appearance with her husband Frédéric Thiébaud at this weekend’s American Music Awards, and the couple cuddled up next to each other to pose for pics and watch the show. Twain and Thiébaud have been married for eight years, but they rarely step out in public together.</p>
      <p>Twain and Thiébaud’s relationship started nearly a decade ago after a shocking scandal ended both of their previous marriages. Twain was married to music producer Robert “Mutt” Lange from 1993 to 2010, but they split when Lange cheated on Twain with Thiébaud’s then-wife Marie-Anne.</p>

      <p>Shania and Marie-Anne were incredibly close. Not only was Marie-Anne Shania’s personal secretary, but she was also her best friend and confidante. After her husband and best friend cheated together, Twain left Lange and Frédéric left Marie-Anne.</p>
      <p>In a surprising twist, Shania and Frédéric found comfort with each other while they were experiencing massive heartbreak, and they ended up falling in love.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t want to love again-it was the last thing on my mind,” Twain told <i>People Magazine</i> in 2011. “It’s just amazing how life works.”</p>
      <p>The 49-year-old Thiébaud is from Switzerland and he is an executive for Nestle. The couple still spend the majority of their time in the Swiss town of Corseaux near Lake Geneva.</p>
      <p>“I describe what happened to Fred and me this way: we were two people who had been jettisoned from our lives as if we’d been shoved off the edge of a high cliff,” said Twain. “Thankfully, we managed to grab onto each other on the way down in midair, and break each other’s fall.”</p>

      <p>Twain absolutely wowed the crowd at the AMAs with her incredible performance. She started with a medley of songs while playing her sparkling pink guitar – including <i>Shake It Off</i> from Taylor Swift, <i>Stressed Out</i> by Twenty-One Pilots, <i>God’s Plan</i> by Drake, and <i>Rockstar</i> by Post Malone.</p>
      <p>Twain then transitioned into a medley of her own huge hits with a group of shirtless male background dancers and female dancers wearing some of her most iconic looks. Twain sang <i>Any Man Of Mine,</i> <i>You’re Still The One, That Don’t Impress Me Much,</i> and <i>Man! I Feel Like A Woman.</i></p>
      <p>Shania Twain’s Las Vegas residency begins next month at the Zappos Theater at Planet Hollywood Resort &amp; Casino.</p>
