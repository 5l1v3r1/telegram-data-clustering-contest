      <p><b>TOKYO — </b>Lawyers for parents separated from their children in Japan said on Monday they would appeal a court decision that the government was not responsible for enforcing visitation rights.</p>
      <p>Fourteen parents had sued the government claiming damages of 9 million yen, arguing there was no legal framework in Japan to ensure they get proper access to their children. The Tokyo District Court dismissed the claim last week.</p>
      <p>Parental alienation is a chronic problem in Japan, with children often losing contact with the non-custodial parent after an acrimonious split. Unlike most developed countries, Japan has no joint-custody system after divorce, and court-ordered visitation rights are often ignored with impunity. The police are reluctant to get involved.</p>
      <p>"I'm certain that this ruling will not escape international condemnation," Akira Ueno, a lawyer representing the plaintiffs, told a news conference on Monday. "We plan to appeal to this ruling."</p>
      <p>The World Health Organisation classified parental alienation this year as a health condition, while the United Nations stipulates children should have the right to maintain bonds with both parents.</p>
      <p>The plaintiffs had claimed the parents' lack of access to their children was a clear violation of the U.N. treaty on children's rights, which Japan ratified in 1994.</p>
      <p>In the ruling on Friday, presiding Tokyo District Court judge Tatsuro Maezawa said the U.N. treaty was "merely an agreement to respect" those rights, but had no binding power.</p>
