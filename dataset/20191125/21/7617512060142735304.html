      <h1>Vikes reclaim U Sports national rugby crown</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T21:55:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 21:55</time> by <a rel="author">Cleve Dheensaw</a></address>
      <p>The cleat prints of University of Victoria Vikes rugby alumni were all over the Canadian team at the 2019 World Cup this fall in Japan, as they were in previous World Cups, and will be again at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.</p>
      <p>The man responsible for that program, Doug Tate, closed out his XVs university head coaching career with the Vikes in grand fashion by winning the Canadian title Sunday at McGill in Montreal. The 21-20 championship game victory came against the arch-rival and two-time defending national champion UBC Thunderbirds, which made the moment all the sweeter.</p>
      <p>“UVic-UBC is a great rivalry and these players know each other well from high school and provincial and national teams,” said Tate.</p>
      <p>“We had the upper hand for many years against the Thunderbirds before they flipped the script the past few years, so this felt great for our [current] players.”</p>
      <p>UBC led 12-0 before the Vikes rallied to lead 14-12 at the half.</p>
      <p>“It’s a credit to our guys. They didn’t panic,” said Tate.</p>
      <p>A last-gasp convert could have won it for UBC but the try at the death was scored in the corner, so the convert attempt couldn’t have been more difficult.</p>
      <p>“That was a tough kick from the sideline,” said Tate.</p>
      <p>“But we lost last year on a difficult kick made by [national-team player] Theo Sauder.”</p>
      <p>So there was not a sigh of relief from the Vikes until they saw the ball sail just wide of the uprights.</p>
      <p>The Vikes were led by Canada U-20 players James O’Neill and Lockie Kratz along with the play of Thomas Di Fiore, Spencer Cooper, Jenner Teufel, Ben Newhook, Logan Martin-Feek and Nick Carson.</p>
      <p>The Canadian university championship went on hiatus for many years — UVic was the 1997 and 1998 champion — and has been resurrected the past three years.</p>
      <p>“Finances killed it originally. But Mike Holmes and the Rugby Foundation have worked hard to bring it back to life,” noted Tate.</p>
      <p>“Of the eight teams at nationals, five were capable of winning it.”</p>
      <p>While the victory ended Tate’s 27-year career at the UVic helm in university competition, the Vikes will continue playing in the B.C. Premier League, and UVic will go for another national sevens championship later this season. So it won’t be until the spring when Tate is completely done his UVic tenure.</p>
      <p>“UVic is unique in the support that rugby receives,” said Tate.</p>
      <p>“It has been a great place to work. Our athletes have been fantastic over the years. We have Vikes alumni like Nathan Hirayama, Mike Fuailefau and Isaac Kaay leading the Canadian charge into the 2020 Olympics next year in Tokyo and a great like Sean Duke, who played rugby internationally for Canada and attended medical school.”</p>
      <p>Tate could have also pointed to UVic alumni Phil Mack, Conor Keys, Jake Ilnicki, Luke Campbell, Dustin Dobravsky and Guiseppe du Toit in the recent 2019 World Cup in Japan and the likes of former Vikes Brett Buekeboom, Andrew Tiedemann and Phil and Jamie Mackenzie in previous World Cups.</p>
      <p>“It’s been a very exciting run, but it’s time to hand it over to somebody else,” said Tate.</p>
