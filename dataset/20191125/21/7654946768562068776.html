      <h1>Trump defends decision to fire Navy secretary over Eddie Gallagher case</h1>

      <p>President Donald Trump on Monday defended his <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/24/def-sec-esper-fires-navy-sec-spencer-over-handling-of-seals-review/">decision to sack Navy Secretary Richard Spencer</a> for his handling of SEAL Eddie Gallagher’s disciplinary review, saying he will always have the backs of those who serve — except for deserters like Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl.</p>
      <p>“I think what I’m doing is sticking up for our Armed Forces, and there’s never been a president that’s going to stick up for them, and has, like I have,” Trump said during an Oval Office meeting with Bulgaria’s prime minister, Boyko Borissov.</p>
      <p>He contrasted his support for the military with how the Obama administration treated the matters involving Bergdahl, who deserted from Afghanistan in 2009 and was taken captive by the Taliban, and Army soldier Chelsea Manning who was convicted of espionage in a court-martial in 2013.</p>
      <p>“So when you have a Chelsea Manning who stole classified information … and gets pardoned or whatever happened. And you have a Sgt. Bergdahl who gets virtually nothing — a slap on the wrist — and then they want to put these warriors in jail for 25 years. … No. we’re not going to do that to our people,” Trump said.</p>
      <p>Obama commuted all but four months of Manning’s 35-year sentence in January 2017.</p>
      <p>Bergdahl was released by his Taliban captors in May 2014 in exchange for the release of five Guantanamo Bay detainees.</p>
      <p>He pleaded guilty to charges of desertion and misbehavior before the enemy and was dishonorably discharged, had his rank busted down, and was fined $1,000 a month for 10 months in November 2017.</p>

      <p>Bergdahl had sought a pardon from Obama, but it was not granted.</p>
      <p>Gallagher faced a peer-to-peer disciplinary review early next month after posing with the corpse of an Islamic State militant while deployed in Iraq in 2017.</p>
      <p>He was acquitted of premeditated murder in the death of the terrorist.</p>
      <p>Defense Secretary Mark Esper fired Spencer for his handling of the review process that could have <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/24/navy-seal-eddie-gallagher-says-hes-being-retaliated-against-in-war-crimes-case/">stripped Gallagher of his Trident pin</a> that designated him as a SEAL.</p>
