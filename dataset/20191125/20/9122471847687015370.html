      <h1>LSU’s Ed Orgeron Releases Apology For His Arkansas Comment</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T20:11:44+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 20:11</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>LSU head coach Ed Orgeron had a brutally honest response when asked about his team’s lack of a celebration following Saturday night’s win over Arkansas.</p>
      <p>“There wasn’t going to be celebration for beating Arkansas, they haven’t beaten anyone in a long time,” <a href="https://thespun.com/college-football/coach-o-has-brutally-honest-comment-about-arkansas-following-win">Coach O told reporters</a>.</p>
      <p>LSU beat Arkansas, 56-20, at Tiger Stadium in Baton Rouge. The Razorbacks have yet to win an SEC game this season.</p>
      <p>Coach O addressed his viral comment at his press conference this afternoon.</p>
      <p>“I want to apologize if it came out wrong to Arkansas,” Coach O said today. “I love them. I had a great time up there, I have some good friends up there. By no means was that to demean them. That was just the mood of our football team. We have bigger goals down the road. If I said something wrong, I apologize to them. I know those guys are some good guys up there, really appreciate those guys.”</p>

      <p>Coach O’s initial comment was brutally honest, but it wasn’t wrong. Arkansas hasn’t had a winning record since 2016. The Razorbacks haven’t won double-digit games since 2011.</p>
      <p>LSU, meanwhile, is 11-0 and will look to finish the regular season undefeated on Saturday night vs. Texas A&amp;M.</p>
