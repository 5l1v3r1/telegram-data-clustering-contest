      <p><a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/10/08/tile-reveals-2019-bluetooth-trackers-including-sticker-new-slim-pro-and-mate/">Tile’s Bluetooth trackers</a> are already able to help users find their lost products, but now company is looking to expand that functionality by relaunching ‘Smart Alerts.’</p>
      <p>Tile’s new Smart Alerts, which is currently in beta, automatically warns users when they’ve left an item with a tracker in it behind for five minutes. You’ll be able to set ‘safe zones’ so that the tile won’t set off an alarm when you forget your purse at home.</p>
      <p>Smart Alerts beta requires a premium subscription, but if you’re forgetful enough, this new feature might be worth it. The premium subscription costs $34.99 CAD for the year. The New Tile Mate is priced at $29.99 CAD, the New Tile Pro costs $39.99 ($74.99 for a two pack), the New Slim is priced at $34.99 and the New Sticker costs $49.99 CAD for a two-pack.</p>
      <p>The beta will be available in December.</p>
