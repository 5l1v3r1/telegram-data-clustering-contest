      <h1>Everton were ridiculed for trying to sign Chris Smalling, who is bossing Serie A</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T20:15:56+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 20:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/tom-procter/" target="_blank">Tom Procter</a></address>
      <p>When Everton moved to sign Chris Smalling from Manchester United on loan in August (<a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11667/11779301/chris-smalling-everton-loan-bid-rejected-by-manchester-united">Sky Sports</a>), more than a few eyebrows were raised.</p>
      <p>Neutrals found the pursuit somewhat amusing, given the Englishman’s poor form for the Red Devils throughout the 2018/19 campaign.</p>

      <p>A lot of Toffees supporters despaired after it had become clear fans’ favourite Kurt Zouma would not be returning permanently to Goodison Park.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, Everton’s move for Smalling was dismissed by United, and the former Fulham defender headed for Italy with AS Roma in one of the summer’s weirder transfers.</p>
      <p>Remarkably though, Smalling is now playing some of the best football he has in years, and Roma’s gain is absolutely looking like Everton’s loss.</p>
      <h3>TBR’s view – How Everton need Smalling now</h3>
      <p>Everton have struggled at the back all season, particularly with the defending of set pieces.</p>

      <p>Michael Keane has been having a torrid time, while Yerry Mina started strong but has been lacking consistency in recent weeks.</p>
      <p>Most Everton fans were relieved to miss out on Smalling at the time, but his form with Roma has been nothing short of a rock at the back.</p>
      <p>He’s a permanent fixture in the team, starting all of his side’s last 11 games, and he’s very much looking like the one that got away with each passing weekend.</p>
