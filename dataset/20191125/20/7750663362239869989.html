      <h1>How Liverpool could line up against Napoli</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/liverpool/"><b>Liverpool</b></a> welcome <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/napoli/"><b>Napoli</b></a> to Anfield on Wednesday knowing that victory would secure top spot in Group E of the <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/champions-league/"><b>Champions League</b></a> with a game to spare.</h2>

      <p>The holders are currently <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/champions-league/2019-20/groups.html">one point clear at the top of the pool</a> and would open up an unassailable lead with a fourth successive European victory, while even a defeat could be enough to seal their place in the last 16 should Red Bull Salzburg fail to beat Genk.</p>
      <p>Napoli can also qualify for the knockout stages with a win, though, and the Italian outfit are the only team to have beaten Liverpool inside 90 minutes this season courtesy of their <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/liverpool/champions-league/result/result-liverpool-begin-cl-defence-with-late-defeat-in-naples_371811.html">triumph in the reverse fixture</a>.</p>
      <p>Here, <b>Sports Mole</b> looks at how <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jurgen-klopp/"><b>Jurgen Klopp</b></a> could set his side up as they bid to avenge that defeat in Naples.</p>

      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/mohamed-salah/"><b>Mohamed Salah</b></a> was an unused substitute during <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/liverpool/result/result-roberto-firmino-nets-winner-for-liverpool-at-palace_380355.html">Saturday's 2-1 win</a> at Crystal Palace, but Klopp confirmed after the match that the Egyptian winger will be ready to return from his ankle injury for this game.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/andrew-robertson/"><b>Andrew Robertson</b></a> also came through that game unscathed having been struggling with a similar problem, and both are expected to be named in the starting lineup for Wednesday's match.</p>
      <p>Salah's return means that <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/alex-oxlade-chamberlain/"><b>Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain</b></a> will likely be displaced in the front three, although his tally of three goals from his last two Champions League games could be enough to earn him a midfield role.</p>
      <p>Klopp could also consider other changes in that area of the field with <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/james-milner/"><b>James Milner</b></a>, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/adam-lallana/"><b>Adam Lallana</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/naby-keita/"><b>Naby Keita</b></a> all pushing for starts, but <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/fabinho/"><b>Fabinho</b></a> looks certain to retain his place given that he will miss Saturday's game against Brighton &amp; Hove Albion through suspension.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/dejan-lovren/"><b>Dejan Lovren</b></a> is again expected to start ahead of <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/joe-gomez/"><b>Joe Gomez</b></a> with Joel Matip likely to miss out once more due to a knee injury, while behind them <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/alisson-becker/"><b>Alisson Becker</b></a> will hope that there is no need for a repeat of the heroics which rescued his side in the same fixture last season.</p>
      <p>Xherdan Shaqiri could play some role as he continues his recovery from a calf injury, although he is unlikely to be thrown straight in from the start considering he has now been out for more than two months.</p>
