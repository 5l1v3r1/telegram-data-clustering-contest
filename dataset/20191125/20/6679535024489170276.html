      <p>Two years after Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik announced one of the most ambitious irrigation projects in the State, the government has not made any expenditure for its execution.</p>
      <p>Just before the Bijepur by-election in 2017, the government had announced the State’s first underground irrigation project — Gangadhar Meher Lift Canal System.</p>
      <p>In response to an RTI query, the government said that the tendering process for the project is yet to be completed.</p>
      <p>“The administrative sanction for the project, which entails an investment of ₹1,340.55 crore, has been approved by the government. In 2018-19 and 2019-20 budget provision of ₹200 crore and ₹100 crore has been made,” the government said.</p>
      <p>As per the plan, water will be drawn from Hirakud Dam through Bargarh Main Canal.</p>
      <h3>Over 70 villages to benefit</h3>
      <p>The water will travel 17.64 km through the pipeline up to Barihapali Secondary Reservoir.</p>
      <p>From Barihapali reservoir, the water will be delivered to farmers in the designed ayacut area, including 74 villages in Bijepur block.</p>
      <p>There will be a mix of underground gravity and pressure pipe distribution network with outlets every 4.5 hectare patch of land.</p>
      <p>It is estimated that an area of about 25,600 hectares would be irrigated in the three blocks. Though the project was to be implemented over five years, no expenditure has been made.</p>
      <p>“The announcement was meant to deceive voters ahead of the Bijepur polls in 2017 when the BJD and the BJP were locked in a bitter contest. Had the government been serious about the project, it would have been fast-tracked,” alleged Pradip Pradhan, RTI activist.</p>
