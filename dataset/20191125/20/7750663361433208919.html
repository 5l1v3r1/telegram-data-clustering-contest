      <p>The Gunners needed a late equaliser to <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/premier-league/arsenal-vs-southampton_game_92626.html">draw with Southampton</a> on Saturday, a result that extended their run to just two wins from their last 11 league games and increased the pressure on the Spaniard.</p>
      <p>Several names have been linked with potentially replacing the ex-Sevilla boss in recent days, with former Tottenham Hotspur manager <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/mauricio-pochettino/"><b>Mauricio Pochettino</b></a> previously seen as a <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/arsenal/sack-race/news/pochettino-leading-candidate-to-replace-emery-at-arsenal_380504.html">leading candidate</a> alongside <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/massimiliano-allegri/"><b>Massimiliano Allegri</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/mikel-arteta/"><b>Mikel Arteta</b></a>.</p>
      <p>However, <i>Sky Bet</i> have now made the current Wolves boss their favourite to take the top job at the Emirates Stadium, pricing him at 6/4.</p>
      <p>Since taking over at Molineux in May 2017, Nuno has guided the West Midlands club to promotion from the Championship and a place in this season's Europa League, winning just shy of 55% of his games as manager.</p>
