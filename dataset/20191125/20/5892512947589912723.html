      <p>Two men are currently being held on kidnapping charges in <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2019/10/31/20941748/video-dana-white-offers-25k-reward-during-emotional-plea-return-walt-harris-daughter-mma">the disappearance of Aniah Blanchard</a>, stepdaughter of UFC heavyweight Walt Harris.</p>
      <p>Those charges are likely to be upgraded to murder.</p>
      <p>“I can confirm that human remains have been found and we have good reason to suspect they are that of Aniah Blanchard,” District Attorney Brandon Hughes told <a href="https://www.wrbl.com/news/tragic-human-remains-believed-to-be-missing-19-year-aniah-blanchard-located/">WRBL News 3</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2019/11/25/20982035/second-suspect-arrested-charged-aniah-blanchard-missing-person-case-disposing-evidence-mma">Antwon Fisher, 35, along with 30-year-old Ibraheem Yazeed</a>, were taken into custody after a nationwide search for Blanchard, who went missing in late October. Her car was eventually recovered, soaked in blood, suggesting foul play.</p>
      <p>A preliminary hearing for Fisher and Yazeed is scheduled for Dec. 18 and Blanchard’s family has been notified of the grisly discovery, which came on Monday morning in a wooded area in Macon County, Alabama, not far from New Hope Baptist Church.</p>
      <p>An autopsy has been ordered to confirm her identity, as well as determine the probable cause of death.</p>
