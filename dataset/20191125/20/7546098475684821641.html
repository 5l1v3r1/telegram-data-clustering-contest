      <h1>Should you buy Afterpay shares?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T20:54:19+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 20:54</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fool.com.au/author/jamesmickleboro/" target="_blank">James Mickleboro</a></address>
      <p>The <b>Afterpay Touch Group Ltd</b> <a href="https://www.fool.com.au/company/Afterpay+Touch+Group+Ltd/?ticker=ASX-APT">(ASX: APT)</a> share price was a strong performer on Monday.</p>
      <p>The payments company’s shares started the week with an impressive 7% gain to $32.64.</p>
      <p>This latest gain means that Afterpay’s shares are now up a remarkable 172% since the start of the year.</p>
      <h3>Why did the Afterpay share price surge higher on Monday?</h3>
      <p>Investors were scrambling to buy shares on Monday after it released the <a href="https://www.fool.com.au/2019/11/25/afterpay-share-price-storms-higher-on-austrac-audit-update/">findings and recommendations</a> of its Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing (AML/CTF) final audit.</p>
      <p>Although the auditor found historical breaches of the AML/CTF act, this was due to the company being given the wrong legal advice in the past. These issues have now been addressed.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, none of the six recommendations that the auditor reported appear onerous or disruptive. In fact, one of the recommendations was encouraging Afterpay to engage AUSTRAC regarding its buy-now pay-later service being formally designated as low ML/TF risk in the AML/CTF Rules.</p>
      <p>All in all, this appears to have been a very good result for Afterpay.</p>
      <h3>Goldman Sachs retains its buy rating.</h3>
      <p>This view was echoed by analysts at Goldman Sachs. According to a note out of the investment bank, it doesn’t believe that AUSTRAC will come after Afterpay like it has with <b>Westpac Banking Corp</b> <a href="https://www.fool.com.au/company/Westpac+Banking+Corp/?ticker=ASX-WBC">(ASX: WBC)</a> this month.</p>
      <p>Goldman said: “The full report and findings of the audit report are now due to be reviewed by AUSTRAC to determine if any further action/penalties may be applicable. However, based on the summary released by the auditor, we would not anticipate there to be material remedial action necessary from AUSTRAC.”</p>
      <p>In light of this, the broker has reaffirmed its conviction buy rating and lofty $42.90 price target on the company’s shares. This price target implies potential upside of over 31% for its shares over the next 12 months.</p>
      <p>I think the broker is spot on and would also class its shares as a buy. Though, it is worth noting that it is a high risk option and could be unsuitable for more cautious investors.</p>
