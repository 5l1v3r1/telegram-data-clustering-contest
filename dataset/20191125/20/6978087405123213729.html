      <h1>The Outer Worlds gets lowest sale price in PS4's Black Friday 2019 lineup</h1>
      <h2>Short of getting free in the Xbox One Game Pass, a digital copy of The Outer Worlds is running at one of its best discounts yet on the PlayStation Store.</h2>

      <p>The Outer Worlds is absolutely great. Obsidian’s return to the Fallout style of gameplay, complete with a spacefaring journey where you amass a lovely ship and crew to save the galaxy from Capitalism gone mad (or uphold company values) is a deliciously snarky adventure full of fun. If you want to see what we’re talking about, it’ll be on a few sales through Black Friday 2019, but the recently launched PlayStation Store sale just put a digital copy of The Outer Worlds at its best price yet.</p>
      <p>PlayStation is getting its Black Friday going early alongside many other major outlets, and with that sale comes a lot of discounted games and services. By far, one of the most interesting among the bunch was The Outer Worlds at a pretty nifty <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP4581-CUSA16285_00-THEOUTERWORLDS01">$44.99 for a digital copy</a>. While a few other outlets have The Outer Worlds on sale, none are offering it at quite that low of a price in their Black Friday catalogs. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Outer-Worlds-PlayStation-4/dp/B07SWT3C45/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;th=1&amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;tag=sec2002-20&amp;linkId=0510e7c769ab4a94ae60984245248841">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/xbox-one?cat=onsale">Xbox</a> are both running the game at around $50 and many other outlets aren’t featuring any deals on the relatively new game.</p>

      <p>It’s worth noting as an aside, The Outer Worlds is featured in the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass">Xbox Game Pass</a>, so if you have the Game Pass or are considering getting it, it’s still worth going after The Outer Worlds there. Even so, as a full, new, and great game, PSN’s $45 sale price on the game is probably the way to go if you’re looking to pick it up for as cheap as its going to get this holiday weekend.</p>
