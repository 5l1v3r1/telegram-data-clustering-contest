      <h1>Make way for us: Uddhav Thackeray to BJP at MLA parade</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T20:05:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 20:05</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/pti" target="_blank">PTI</a></address>
      <p>Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray on Monday asked the BJP to "make way" for the Sena-NCP- Congress alliance to rule Maharashtra.</p>
      <p>He was speaking at a joint parade of MLAs of the three parties, held at a luxury hotel in suburban Mumbai.</p>
      <p>NCP chief Sharad Pawar, who was also present, said BJP misused power to grab power even in states where voters hadn't given their mandate to it.</p>
      <p>Locked in a protracted power tussle with the BJP in Maharashtra, the 'Maha Vikas Aghadi' of the Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress has decided to "parade" 162 MLAs in the Mumbai five- star hotel on Monday evening in a show of united strength.</p>
      <p>The move was announced hours after the leaders of the three parties submitted a letter to Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari claiming that they have the requisite numbers to form government.</p>
      <p>Those present were at the parade were Congress leader Ashok Chavan, who said, "We are more than 162, not just 162. We all will be a part of the government. I thank Sonia Gandhi who allowed for this alliance to stop BJP."</p>
      <p>"The governor should invite us to form government," he said.</p>
