      <p>Nov. 25 (UPI) -- Facebook and Twitter announced Monday that hundreds of users' personal data has been breached by a third-party through certain apps.</p>
      <p><a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/sdk-issue">Twitter announced</a> that personal data potentially accessed by a third-party developer included email, username and last tweet.</p>
      <p>The social media giant added the breach impacted Android, but not Apple users.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/25/facebook-and-twitter-says-users-gave-improper-access-to-personal-data.html">Hundreds of users may have</a> been breached after they logged into certain Android apps downloaded from the <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Google/?tps=1">Google</a> Play store, including those who accessed apps such as Giant Square and Photofy.</p>
      <p>Both social media companies found out from a security researchers report that the problem stemmed from a "malicious mobile software development kit" named One Audience, which gave third-party developers access.</p>
      <p>"Security researchers recently notified us about two bad actors, One Audience and Mobiburn, who were paying developers to use malicious software development kits (SDKs) in a number of apps available in popular app stores," Facebook told CNBC in a statement. "After investigating, we removed the apps from our platform for violating our platform policies and issued cease-and-desist letters against One Audience and Mobiburn."</p>
      <p>"We encourage people to be cautious when choosing which third-party apps are granted access to their social media accounts," the statement added.</p>
      <p>Facebook and Twitter said they plan to notify users who may have been impacted by the breach.</p>
      <p>The announcement for Facebook comes on the same day it's <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2019/11/introducing-facebook-viewpoints/">introducing a new market</a> research app.</p>
      <p>The new app, called Facebook Viewpoints, gives people points for completing surveys, such as the first "Well-Being Survey" with 1,000 points that results in a $5 reward sent to a PayPal account.</p>
