      <p><a href="https://www.cbs42.com/news/national/tragic-human-remains-believed-to-be-missing-19-year-aniah-blanchard-located/"><i>CBS 42 </i>reports </a>that the ‘probable remains’ of Aniah Blanchard, 19, have been discovered in Macon County, AL. That outlet quoted Lee County District Attorney Brandon Hughes, who said that “I can confirm that human remains have been found and we have good reason to suspect they are that of Aniah Blanchard.”</p>
      <p>Blanchard, who is from Homewood, AL and whose stepfather is UFC heavyweight Walt Harris, was reported missing on October 24th. Her damaged vehicle was discovered on the 25th at an apartment complex in Montgomery, AL.</p>
      <p>In court documents authorities stated that blood evidence recovered from inside the vehicle suggested a “life-threatening” injury had been suffered there.</p>
      <p>On November 7th Ibraheem Yazeed, 29, was named a suspect in Blanchard’s kidnapping. A witness claimed they saw Yazeed force Blanchard into her vehicle and drive off with her. CCTV footage also showed Yazeed and Blanchard at the same convenience store on the night of the 23rd.</p>
      <p>That same day <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/11/8/20955469/us-marshals-capture-man-suspected-kidnapping-walt-harris-daughter-aniah-blanchard-ufc-mma-crime-news">Yazeed was captured by U.S. Marshals</a> in Escambia County, FL. He was then extradited to Lee County, AL where he was booked on a charge of first degree kidnapping and held without bond.</p>
      <p>Yazeed was <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/11/11/20959173/suspect-aniah-blanchard-jailed-without-bond-alabama-ibraheem-yazeed-walt-harris-ufc-mma-crime-news">out on bond</a> at the time of his arrest and was awaiting trial on unrelated kidnapping an attempted murder charges. Those charges stem from an alleged incident that occurred in January.</p>
      <p>On Friday <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/11/25/20971066/second-suspect-arrested-in-connection-with-aniah-blanchard-disappearance-ufc-walt-harris-crime-news">Antwain Fisher was arrested</a> by U.S. Marshals and the Auburn Police Department. He was also charged with first degree kidnapping.</p>

UFC President Dana White and other figures from the MMA community contributed to that fund.</p>
