      <p>Though neither of them could have predicted it, 17-year-old Omaha, Nebraska, high school quarterback Elliott Brown, and 6-year-old McKinley Blue have become a formidable team.</p>
      <p>As first reported by “<a href="https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/family/story/year-good-luck-charm-paints-high-school-quarterbacks-67234442">Good Morning America</a>,” the two met while Blue was in the hospital recovering from the after-effects of a <a href="https://www.3newsnow.com/news/local-news/girl-4-goes-home-after-tramatic-brain-injury-from-may-car-crash">2018 car accident.</a> That accident left Blue with a left skull fracture that put her in a coma for 10 days. The 6-year old had to have a piece of her skull removed and was confined to a wheelchair during her recovery, <a href="https://www.3newsnow.com/news/local-news/girl-4-goes-home-after-tramatic-brain-injury-from-may-car-crash">KMTV reported.</a> Blue’s brain trauma was so severe she reportedly had to relearn how to walk, talk, and eat. It was during those long months of recovery that Brown started visiting.</p>

      <p>Brown was friends with Blue’s older sisters and was moved by the young girl’s attempts at recovery. He would come sit with Blue during her recovery sessions and let her paint his fingernails, a process that slowly helped Blue regain some of her strength in her arms. Brown returned every week before game day for a fresh layer of paint.</p>
      <p>Blue’s mother, Jessica, told Good Morning America that the two forged a deep bond during their visits.</p>
      <p>“I always thought he was a very sweet boy and a great example for my girls,” Jessica Blue said.</p>
      <p>The fingernail painting continued on even after Blue was released from the hospital. Now, when Blue paints Brown’s nails she can actually go seen him in action at the games.</p>
