      <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says that at a forthcoming Normandy summit in Paris, he is going to talk about a ceasefire in Donbas, as "this war must end."</p>
      <p>"We got the date for [the Normandy summit] confirmed by the four countries ...We've entered final straight – well done. It's very important to unblock .... this opportunity to talk about the return of our territories, the restoration of our territorial integrity," Zelensky said during his latest video address <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zelenskiy95/videos/2390516187865410/">posted on his official Facebook page on November 25</a>.</p>
      <p>"We'll start preparations for the meeting. Frankly speaking, we're ready now, but we need to work a little more. Unfortunately, we are losing our soldiers, we are losing the best ones. And the sooner we could talk about a ceasefire [in Donbas], the fewer of our people will suffer ... This war must end," he added.</p>
      <p>As UNIAN reported earlier, a meeting of heads of state in the Normandy format - Ukraine, Germany, France, and Russia – is scheduled for December 9. It will be hosted by Paris, France.</p>
