      <p>An adorable baby monkey has been caught on a video snuggling with its mommy. At first, the little mischief-maker tried to get away from its mum, but she firmly grabbed at its rear leg so it does not escape.</p>
      <p>But the kid did not mind its mother's company, as it started clutching at mum's hair and nibbling at her face gently.</p>
      <p>The mother did not seem to be against this kind of treatment at all - on the contrary, she seemed really composed and serene, probably, because she knew that her child is safe and by her side.</p>
