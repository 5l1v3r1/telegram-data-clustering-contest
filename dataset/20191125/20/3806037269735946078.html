      <h1>Tesla Cybertruck Defeats Ford F-150 in Tug-of-War Battle</h1>
      <h2>Experts are skeptical, however.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T20:30:16+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 20:30</time> by <a rel="author">Emily Engle</a></address>
      <p><a href="http://www.hypebeast.com/tags/elon-musk">Elon Musk</a> recently posted a 16-second video on Twitter that shows <a href="http://www.hypebeast.com/tags/tesla">Tesla</a>‘s <a href="http://www.hypebeast.com/tags/tesla-cybertruck">Cybertruck</a> duking it out with a <a href="http://www.hypebeast.com/tags/ford-f-150">Ford F-150</a> in a tug-of-war match. Musk has been taking numerous digs at the F-150, including in a tweet that simply states the Cybertruck is a “better truck than an F-150.” In the video, The Cybertruck pulled away victorious almost immediately, leading to some skepticism from the experts over at <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2019/11/25/tesla-cybertruck-pulls-ford-f-150/"><i>Autoblog</i></a>.</p>

      <p><i>Autoblog</i> points out that while the Cybertruck gains traction and moves forward right away, the F-150’s rear wheels begin spinning. This likely means the Cybertruck’s opponent is a rear-wheel drive F-150. The F-150 also appears to be a lower-spec STX package in a SuperCrew configuration, meaning it is somewhere between 6,070 and 7,050 pounds, as opposed to the Cybertruck’s massive battery pack and stainless steel material, which are likely heavier. It is also unclear what version of the Cypertruck is in the video, as the vehicle will be offered with between one and three electric motors. If this is, in fact, the all-wheel drive version with three motors, it is able to tow around 14,000 pounds.</p>
      <p>This video comes following the news that <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/11/tesla-cybertruck-first-week-sales-elon-musk">146,000 Tesla Cybertrucks have been preordered in just two days</a>.</p>
