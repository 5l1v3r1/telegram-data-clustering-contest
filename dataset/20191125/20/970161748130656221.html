      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/ufc/">UFC</a> fighter Walt Harris’s missing stepdaughter, Aniah Blanchard, 19, is believed to have been found dead, police said.</p>
      <p>Blanchard’s body is believed to have been discovered Monday morning in Macon County, Alabama, more than a month after she disappeared from Auburn, which is in the same state, on October 24.</p>
      <p>Lee County District Attorney Brandon Hughes said: ‘I can confirm that human remains have been found in Macon County and we have good reason to believe they are that of Aniah Blanchard.</p>
      <p>Auburn police told <a href="https://www.al.com/news/2019/11/report-aniah-blanchards-body-may-have-been-found.html">AL.com</a> that investigators found the remains after they ‘obtained information regarding the possible location of a body.’</p>
      <p>A suspect in Blanchard’s kidnapping, Antwain ‘Squirmy’ Fisher, 35, was arrested on Friday made his first court appearance Monday in the case of Aniah’s disappearance, according to <a href="https://www.cbs42.com/news/national/tragic-human-remains-believed-to-be-missing-19-year-aniah-blanchard-located/">CBS</a>.</p>

      <p>Prosecutors say Fisher helped 29-year-old Ibraheem Yazeed, a second suspect, kidnap Blanchard by giving him ‘material assistance to Yazeed by providing transportation to Yazeed and disposing of evidence,’ according to court records made public Monday.</p>

      <p>Yazeed was arrested on November 7 and charged with kidnapping after he was seen in surveillance footage at the same convenience store as Blanchard shortly before she disappeared.</p>
      <p>A witness told police that Yazeed forced Blanchard into a car at the store, although it is unclear if the witness was referring to Yazeed’s vehicle or Blanchard’s SUV, which was later found abandoned and damaged.</p>
      <p>Auburn police said evidence inside the SUV contained the ‘blood of someone suffering a life-threatening injury. The evidence was submitted to the Alabama Department of Forensic Sciences and was found to contain Blanchard’s DNA.</p>
      <p>The vehicle was also found to contain a man’s DNA and Yazeed has recently been ordered by a judge to submit a DNA sample.</p>

      <p>Yazeed reportedly has an extensive criminal history including arrests for drug possession and assault and battery of a police officer. He was also charged with two counts of robbery and attempted murder, but a jury found insufficient evidence against Yazeed in those cases and found him not guilty.</p>
      <p>Fischer has had less issues with the law and has only been previously convicted of public intoxication and marijuana possession in 2015.</p>
      <p>In the wake of Blanchard’s disappearance the UFC community came together to donate more than $105,000 as a reward for anyone with information that helped police find the teen. The reward includes donations from UFC President Dana White, light heavyweight champ Jon Jones, police and others.</p>
      <p>Blanchard’s mother, Angela, and her stepfather, UFC heavyweight fighter Walt Harris, told appeared on Doctor Phil and alleged that Aniah was set up to be taken, but added that they could not elaborate on their claims because of the ongoing investigation.</p>
