        <li>Movies based on real-life events have seen a comeback in Hollywood recently.</li>
        <li>A number of celebrities have been tasked with bringing real icons to life on-screen in films like “The King,” “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,” and “A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood.”</li>
        <li>These icons range from other celebrities, like Judy Garland and Marilyn Monroe, to activists like Martin Luther King, Jr. and Nelson Mandela.</li>

      <p>Biographical films tell stories about real people and actors are tasked with bringing those icons to the big screen.</p>
      <p>The icon could be another celebrity, like Renee Zellweger playing Judy Garland, or a politician, like David Oyelowo playing Martin Luther King Jr., but the goal remains the same – become the real person with as much accuracy as possible. From physical transformations to working with dialect coaches, the actors mold themselves into the person they are portraying.</p>
      <p>Here are 33 actors compared to the icons they played in real life.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>As McQueen, Lewis makes a short appearance in “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,” and it’s suggested that he has feelings for his close friend Tate.</p>
      <p>McQueen was reportedly supposed to spend the evening with Sebring, Tate, and others the night of the murders, but ended up making other plans.</p>
      <p>The actor’s ex-wife, Neile Adams, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/life/steve-mcqueens-wandering-eye-saved-murdered-mansons/">told the Telegraph</a> that the actor “ran into a chickie and decided to go off with her instead,” thereby avoiding being killed by Manson followers at Tate’s home.</p>
      <p>“Going off with that girl saved his life. After that, he became more paranoid and wouldn’t let me go anywhere without a gun,” Adams said</p>

      <h3>Martial artist Bruce Lee was played by Mike Moh in “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.”</h3>

      <p>Lee, a legendary martial artist, was portrayed as arrogant and quick-tempered in “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,” a choice Tarantino <a href="https://www.insider.com/quentin-tarantino-bruce-lee-once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-2019-8">later defended</a>.</p>

Jett told Interview that Stewart <a href="https://www.interviewmagazine.com/film/joan-jett-the-runaways">studied her mannerisms</a> before playing the musician.</p>
      <p>“The thing that came through to me was that it was important to her to capture it,” Jett said. “So I gave her all The Runaways music that I could find; I gave her tapes of me talking. … When we were together prior to the start of filming, she was staring at me the whole time. And I was fine with it because I knew she was watching my posture, my mannerisms, everything I did, the way I hold my hands, just everything.”</p>

      <p>“In watching everything she ever did, I saw her experimenting and forming Marilyn Monroe over time,” she said. “It gave me courage: This didn’t come naturally to her, so I didn’t have to expect it to come naturally to myself.”</p>

      <p>“I know that [Chaplin] also had a hand in this, that somehow he and I are connected,” he said. “You don’t do something like this where his spirit doesn’t check in.”</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Kutcher looked physically like Apple co-creator Jobs, but Steve Wozniak, another Apple co-creator, said that the movie itself wasn’t historically accurate. Wozniak told The Verge that he was contacted by the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/1/26/3919472/steve-wozniak-turned-down-offer-to-work-on-jobs-after-reading-early-script/in/2794100">studio but disliked the first script so much</a> that he ended up supporting Sony’s Steve Jobs movie instead.</p>
      <p>“I was approached early on [for <i>JOBS</i>],” Wozniak said. “I read a script as far as I could stomach it and felt it was crap. The Sony people got in contact with me too and in the end I went with them. You can’t do both [films] and be paid.”</p>

      <p>Redmayne won an Oscar for his portrayal of the physicist. The actor did extensive research into Hawking’s life to understand the man’s brain as well as to portray his body’s deterioration over the years.</p>
      <p><a href="https://variety.com/2014/film/news/eddie-redmayne-theory-of-everything-stephen-hawking-1201340498/">According to Variety</a>, the actor watched documentaries and YouTube videos, read the physicist’s books, studied with a physics teacher, and worked with a choreographer. He also spoke with doctors and other patients at a neurology clinic. He kept notes on a paper so that he would remember specific movements during certain scenes because the movie wasn’t filmed chronologically.</p>
      <p>“The thing about motor neuron disease, once a muscle stops working, it doesn’t start again,” he told Variety. “So often in the edit, directors and editors will shift things around. James and I were absolutely adamant that Anthony’s script would have to be pretty solid from the get-go.”</p>
      <p>Hawking even met with Redmayne before the film started shooting so that Redmayne could see the man he was to portray.</p>

      <p>The drama is about the life of pilot, businessman, billionaire, and director Howard Hughes. The film also portrays Hughes’ relationship with Hepburn. Blanchett spoke to the New York Times about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/12/movies/the-cate-who-would-be-kate.html">portraying an icon like Hepburn</a>.</p>
      <p>“Representing Kate in the same medium, film, in which she existed was very daunting,” Blanchett said. “But because she was so private and few people really knew her, we basically know Hepburn through her films, so of course you have to give a nod to her screen persona when playing her.”</p>
