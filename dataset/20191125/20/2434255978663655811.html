      <h1>Signs, Symtoms and Treatment for Mumps: HSE issues warning amid major increase in Ireland</h1>
      <h2>Headaches, tiredness, and joint pain are all warnings signs</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T20:10:57+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 20:10</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.rsvplive.ie/authors/blathin-de-paor/" target="_blank">Blathin de Paor</a></address>
      <p>The HSE have issued a warning for the public to be vigiliant on the signs and symtoms of mumps, amid a major increase in Ireland.</p>
      <p>They revealed that last week alone there were 77 cases of mumps reported in Ireland, with 111 the week before.</p>
      <p>The HSE is warning that vaccines are more important than ever to stop the spread of preventable diseases like mumps.</p>
      <p>Dr Suzanne Cotter, Specialist in Public Health Medicine, HSE HPSC (Health Protection Surveillance Centre) told RSVP Live the mumps outbreak can be largely attributed to older teenagers and young adults who are among large groups of people, like at college or school.</p>
      <p>The outbreak of mumps is related to a combination of factors, according to Dr Cotter, including non-vaccination with MMR, under vaccination or, in some individuals, immunity after two doses.</p>
      <p>Mumps is a highly contagious viral infection that usually affects children. The most common symptom of mumps is a swelling of the parotid glands.</p>
      <p>The parotid glands are located on one side, or both sides, of the face. The swelling gives a person a distinctive 'hamster face' appearance.</p>
      <p>Other symtoms to watch for according to the HSE are fever, tiredness and headaches.</p>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.hse.ie/eng/health/az/m/mumps/symptoms-of-mumps.html">HSE</a> , once a person has had mumps, they usually develop immunity against further infections.</p>
      <p>One of the most common concerns about mumps is if it can make men sterile.</p>

      <h3>Symptoms of mumps</h3>
      <p>The symptoms of mumps usually develop 14-25 days after being infected with the mumps virus (the incubation period). The average incubation period is around 17 days.</p>
      <p>Swelling of the parotid glands is the most common symptom of mumps. The parotid glands are a pair of glands that are responsible for producing saliva. They are located on either side of your face, just below your ears.</p>
      <p>Both glands are usually affected by the swelling, although in a minority of cases, only one gland is affected.</p>
      <p>Other symptoms of the mumps include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>headache</li>
        <li>joint pain</li>
        <li>nausea</li>
        <li>dry mouth</li>
        <li>mild abdominal pain</li>
        <li>fatigue</li>
        <li>loss of appetite</li>
        <li>inflammation of ovaries, testicles, deafness</li>
        <li>high temperature (fever) of 38ºC (100.4ºF), or above.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>How common are mumps?</h3>
      <p>Before the introduction of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine in 1988, mumps was a common childhood infection that was responsible for many hospital admissions a year.</p>
      <p>After the MMR vaccine was introduced as part of the routine childhood vaccination programme, the number of mumps cases fell sharply.</p>
      <p>However, in recent years, there has been a rise in the incidence of mumps in <a href="https://www.rsvplive.ie/all-about/ireland">Ireland</a> , particularly among teenagers and young adults. In 2009 more than 3600 cases were reported, most 15-34 years of age.</p>
      <p>The recent mumps epidemics mainly affected people who were never vaccinated with MMR vaccine or may have only received one dose of the MMR vaccine.</p>

      <h3>How are mumps spread</h3>
      <p>Mumps is an airborne virus and can be spread by:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>an infected person coughing or sneezing and releasing tiny droplets of contaminated saliva, which can then be breathed in by another person</li>
        <li>an infected person touching their nose or mouth, then transferring the virus onto an object, such as a door handle, or work surface; if someone else then touches the object shortly afterwards, they can transfer the virus into their respiratory tract</li>
        <li>sharing utensils, such as cups, cutlery or plates with an infected person</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>How do you treat mumps?</h3>
      <p>There are currently no anti-viral medications that can be used to treat mumps. Treatment is focused on relieving symptoms until your body's immune system manages to fight off the <a href="https://www.rsvplive.ie/all-about/wellness">infection</a> .</p>
      <p>The self-care techniques listed below should help.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Get plenty of bed rest until your symptoms have passed.</li>
        <li>Over-the-counter (OTC) painkillers, such as ibuprofen or paracetamol, can reduce symptoms of pain. Children who are 16 years old or under should not be given aspirin.</li>
        <li>Drink plenty of fluids, but avoid drinks that are known to stimulate saliva production, such as fruit juice, because excess saliva can cause pain. Water is usually the best fluid to drink.</li>
        <li>Applying a cold compress to your swollen glands should help to reduce the pain.</li>
        <li>Eat foods that do not require a lot of chewing, such as soup, mashed potatoes and scrambled eggs.</li>
        <li>In people with mumps, preventing the spread of infection is also important. The advice below explains the best way to do this.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Avoiding Contact If You Have Mumps</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Stay away from school, college or work until five days after the onset of your symptoms.</li>
        <li>Wash your hands regularly, using soap and water.</li>
        <li>Always use a tissue to cover your mouth and nose when you cough and sneeze. Throw the tissue in a bin immediately afterwards.</li>
      </ul>
