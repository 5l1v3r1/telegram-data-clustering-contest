      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jessica-biel/">Jessica Biel</a> was spotted in public for the first time since her husband <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/justin-timberlake/">Justin Timberlake</a> was caught getting cosy with Palmer co-star Alisha Wainwright.</p>
      <p>In the photos, the 37-year-old actress can be seen sporting a pair of sunnies and wearing a long coat, plain white tee and casual trousers.</p>
      <p>But, peculiarly, she was holding a giant pillow, as well as a Transformers toy.</p>
      <p>Perhaps their four-year-old son Silas had a sleepover?</p>
      <p>Whatever it is, she’s looking unfazed and unbothered by recent rumours swirling around her husband’s antics last week.</p>
      <p>(She’s also still wearing her wedding ring, if that’s anything to go by).</p>

      <p>The rumours started after photos emerged of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/24/justin-timberlake-seeing-holding-hands-co-star-ditches-wedding-ring-parties-without-wife-jessica-biel-11208805/">Justin and Alisha partying on a wild night out at The Absinthe House</a> in New Orleans this weekend.</p>

      <p>Even more worryingly, Justin wasn’t wearing his wedding ring.</p>
      <p>Alisha, 30, can be seen with her hand on 38-year-old Justin’s leg. While in another photo, the pair hold hands under the table.</p>
      <p>Wearing a cap, Justin looks up at Alisha as she, at one stage, got up from her seat holding a bottle as she draped herself over a railing.</p>
      <p>The pair were sitting on a balcony, surrounded by other party-goers, who all appeared to be having fun as they joked with Justin, who was in great spirits.</p>
      <p>Justin also appeared in footage that showed him being helped up and dragged inside by a friend at the party.</p>
      <p>Neither Justin or Jessica have spoken publicly about the incident.</p>
