      <h1>How do I recognise a healthy relationship from an unhealthy relationship?</h1>
      <h2>If you are currently in a relationship and uncertain if yours is a healthy or unhealthy relationship, the following checklist of behaviours may help you decide</h2>

      <p>Healthy, supportive relationships are one of the best predictors of emotional and physical health. Yet, in my work as a Dating and Relationship Coach the majority of my client’s have experienced at least one unhealthy or emotionally abusive relationship at some point in their lives. The negative impact of living in a society obsessed with the idea of romantic love means so many people overlook red flags in the rush to partner up.</p>
      <p>‘Red flag behaviours’ are undesirable behaviours that can be a pre-cursor to abuse if ignored. Make it your responsibility to gain awareness regarding red flags so you can spot some of the signs before it’s too late. Unhealthy love is always characterised by some form of manipulation at the beginning yet this is also the time when you get so swept up in the idea or ‘potential’ of a person that you overlook their bad behaviours. Swot up on the following three ways you can turn inwards to spot red flag behaviours and offer yourself the best chance at detecting signs of unhealthy love.</p>
      <p><b>1. Listen To Your Built-In Red Flag-Alert System:</b> Get familiar with your personal internal monitor for danger and how it generally goes off and respond to it. Call it your whispered warning or a biological sensory response system, become aware of how you receive your warnings. Some people describe a flash of fear, a pinch in their stomach, a pounding heart, etc.</p>
      <p>Overall, it is generally a feeling of discomfort you cannot explain but you know it exists. Almost all of my clients when they describe the beginnings of their unhealthy relationships mention a sense of knowing something was not quite right but ignoring it. Don’t ignore any of these ‘warnings’ as they can be powerful indicators to protect you from danger.</p>
      <p><b>Remember:</b> Despite popular opinion your life should not turn upside down when you meet someone. You life should not change overnight yet unhealthy relationships always involve lots of drama. If you feel uneasy at the early stages of dating, do not ignore it. Dating in a healthy relationship is characterised by excitement and looking forward to seeing your date rather than a dull sense of uncertainty, second guessing and worrying if you have said or done something to offend them or pressure of any kind.</p>
      <p><b>2. Go slowly:</b> Unhealthy relationships are characterised by speed, intensity and urgency (e.g. incessant texting, desire to spend more and more time together or perhaps demanding you to move where they live under the pretence this is ‘best’ for you). If you ask the person you are dating to slow things down and they don’t, claiming they like you and this is just how people behave when they like someone, be warned. Someone who does not respect your need to take things slowly at the beginning is not only being disrespectful to your needs but is suggesting his/her needs are more important than yours and this unfortunately is an ongoing theme in unhealthy <a href="https://www.rsvplive.ie/all-about/relationships">relationships.</a></p>
      <p><b>Remember:</b> Ideas regarding ‘love at first sight’ are damaging. We watch movies where big grand gestures, obsessive love and people not being able to get enough of one another is normalised. These ideas are can allow us to overlook unhealthy behaviours in favour of the notion that the person your dating must be mad about you, this must be love and as a result you end up feeling flattered by all the attention and ignore the violation of your personal boundaries.</p>
      <p><b>3. Consciously Date:</b> Be a conscious dater, do not always rush in to see only the positive and ignore the negative. Do not only consider if the person you are dating likes you, ask yourself if you like this person. How do they speak about people, how do they treat people, are they kind? A fundamental piece of my work as a dating and relationship coach is to support people to identify and understand their needs in relationships and help them realise why they have been accepting unsatisfactory, unhealthy love.</p>
