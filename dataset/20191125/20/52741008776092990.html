      <p>TORONTO — Ontario's public elementary and high school teachers are getting ready to start work-to-rule campaigns Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The unions representing those teachers say they are frustrated by contract negotiations with the province.</p>
      <p>The Elementary Teachers' Federation of Ontario and the Ontario Secondary School Teachers' Federation say their members will start withdrawing some services.</p>
      <p>They say their campaigns won't affect student learning, but will include forgoing administrative tasks such as putting comments on report cards, attending certain meetings and participating in standardized testing.</p>
      <p>Education Minister Stephen Lecce says the government has been reasonable in contract talks, scaling back increases to class sizes and mandatory e-learning requirements.</p>
      <p>But OSSTF president Harvey Bischof says those moves have just taken the education system from much worse to somewhat worse.</p>
      <p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published Nov. 25, 2019.</p>
