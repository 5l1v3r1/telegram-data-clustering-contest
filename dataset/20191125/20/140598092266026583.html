      <h1>Lib Dems scale back ambitions to focus on unseating Tories in marginals</h1>

      <p>The Liberal Democrats are now focusing on stopping a Tory majority, says Chuka Umunna, as the party recalibrates its strategy.</p>
      <p>After predicting at the start of the campaign that the Lib Dems could net 200 seats to stand a chance of forming a Government, Mr Umunna, the party’s foreign affairs spokesman, said the only way to stop Brexit was to reduce the number of Tory MPs.</p>
      <p>“Here the Liberal Democrats have a vital and decisive role to play because only we can take seats from the Tories in significant numbers,” he told activists on the campaign trail in Watford.</p>
      <p>He said polls showed that in a number of Tory constituencies the Lib Dems were in second place poised to win the seat “particularly if Remainers vote tactically.”</p>
      <p>“Conversely, the Labour party would lose in all of them.  Far from taking seats from Johnson, Labour is trying to defend its own from the Tories, particularly in the West Midlands, North East and Yorkshire.  </p>
      <p>“For the betting folks out there, Ladbrokes does not have Labour as favourites to win in any Tory-held seat – but it does with the Lib Dems.  </p>
      <p>“This highlights the crucial role voters have in Tory/LibDem marginals in the coming weeks – stopping Brexit and stopping Boris Johnson’s extreme Brexit is the prize.”</p>
      <p>He said that post-election, there were only two options. One was to get sufficient MPs to secure a people’s vote. “As the last parliament illustrated, what matters is the parliamentary arithmetic, not the wishes of any minority government,” he said.  </p>
      <p>“Every Liberal Democrat MP and the full weight of our party will be thrown behind Remain in that scenario.”</p>
      <p>“Or, Boris Johnson is given a majority, allowing him to more or less blank cheque to do exactly as he pleases.”</p>
