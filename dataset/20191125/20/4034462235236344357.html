      <h1>Is Mazda Finally Serious About A Rotary Sports Car?</h1>
      <h2>It sure seems like it's going to happen.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T20:00:32+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 20:00</time> by <a rel="author">Jared Rosenholtz</a></address>
      <p>The Mazda RX-8 has been off the market for nearly eight years now and fans of the rotary-powered sports car have been left in the dark with no successor in sight. Mazda seems to go <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/mazda-not-sure-world-is-ready-for-a-new-rotary-engined-car">back and forth on the decision to build a new rotary sports car </a>but speaking recently to <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/mazda-rx-9-hopes-boosted-new-rotary-engine-technology">Autocar</a>, company R&amp;D boss Ichiro Hirose seemed more willing than ever to introduce one.</p>
      <p>The Japanese automaker recently went through a lot of development work on a new rotary engine, which will be <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/mazda-enters-electric-car-market-with-all-new-mx-30">used as a range-extender</a> in the new <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/mazda/mx-30">MX-30</a> electric SUV. "The flexible rotary engine is a major solution for electrification technologies. It's compact and lightweight with outstanding NVH. By using the rotary engine in a variety of ways, we can improve the cost efficiency - that means we can lower the hurdle of putting the rotary engine on a sports car. I really wish that we can justify this car. We have that dream, of course," said Hirose.</p>

      <p>The rotary engine won't actually be used to drive the wheels in the MX-30. Instead, it will act as a generator for the batteries (much like a <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/chevrolet/volt">Chevrolet Volt</a>). This doesn't mean the rumored RX-9 sports car would have to be all-electric though. Mazda says the rotary engine can also be used in hybrid and plug-in hybrid applications as well as LPG and hydrogen-powered cars but due to the strict emissions regulations, the RX-9 would have to use some form of electrification.</p>
      <p>"If we just look at the rotary engine, to meet current environmental requirements, technology-wise, it will be difficult for a rotary to meet these," said Mazda design boss Ikuo Maeda. "Mazda is looking at combining different technologies in our vehicles. If we can look at some suitable and fitting combination [for a sports car], then that might be a good solution."</p>

      <p>"It is hard just to focus on studying high-performance sports cars with a rotary engine, but we wanted to see how we can evolve the technology by going through this type of trial [with the range extender]," Maeda added. "And, of course, we share the same dream that in the future we would like to have an RX-type sports car." In our recent interview with Mazda Program Manager, Naohito Saga, we were told the rotary engine could eventually <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/mazda-has-exciting-plans-for-the-cx-30">find its way into other Mazda vehicles </a>like the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/mazda/cx-30">CX-30</a>.</p>
