        <b>JJ Abrams is spilling all the tea and has recalled how a <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/star-wars/">Star Wars</a> actor left the script for the next episode in a hotel room – and it ended up on eBay for sale.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is set for release in cinemas next month and the cast, including John Boyega, Daisy Ridley and Mark Hamill, were filming scenes right up until Sunday.</p>
      <p>Details about the next installment are, of course, tightly under wraps, but JJ reveals the whole story was almost made public due to a slightly careless cast member.</p>

      <p>During his appearance on Good Morning America on Monday, the Hollywood director recalled: ‘The security is insane, the company were nervous about anything getting out. So they had only a handful of scripts and they were printed on crazy uncopyable paper.</p>
      <p>And one of our actors – I’m not going to say which one, I want to but I won’t – left it under their bed and it was found by someone who was cleaning their place.’</p>
      <p>Could you imagine the horror?!</p>
      <p>JJ, 53, went on to reveal how the precious script was then passed onto someone else who, of course, listed it on eBay to earn a sure-fire quick buck.</p>

      <p>However luckily, those Disney eagle-eyes are out in force (slight pun intended) and managed to spot the script up for sale.</p>
      <p>‘Someone at the company said, “There’s a script, that looks like it’s a legit script for sale on eBay”. And they got it back before it sold.’</p>
      <p>The director added: ‘With all the security you’ve got to be careful.’</p>

      <p>No doubt the actor at fault will be kicking themselves for all of eternity.</p>
      <p>JJ’s revelation comes after actress Keri Russell, who plays Zorri Bliss in The Rise of Skywalker, recently revealed how she was prevented from reading the full script and only shown the ‘sides’ of her scenes.</p>

      <p>If she wanted to read the whole script, she had to do so in a security-guarded room.</p>
