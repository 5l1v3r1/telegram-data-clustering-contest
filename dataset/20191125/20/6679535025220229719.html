      <h3>CBI special judge</h3>
      <p>CBI Special Judge S.B. Sahu sentenced Pradeep Tyagi (29) to 10 years’ rigorous imprisonment along with a fine of ₹5,000 after finding him guilty of rigging the 2013 police constable recruitment exams conducted by Vyapam, special prosecutor Satish Dinkar told PTI.</p>
      <p>Judge Sahu sentenced 30 others to seven years in jail and fined each one of them ₹30,000, finding them guilty of several offences, including cheating by impersonation, cheating and forgery related to the 2013 police constable exam.</p>
      <p>These 30 persons include 12 people, arrested at the time from Bhopal and Datia, who wrote the exams on behalf of other candidates.</p>
