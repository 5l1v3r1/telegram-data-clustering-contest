      <h1>Aston Martin's Future DBX Plans Will Haunt Lamborghini</h1>
      <h2>Time to add more power? Of course!</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T20:55:32+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 20:55</time> by <a rel="author">Jay Traugott</a></address>
      <p>If you want to buy a new <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/aston-martin/dbx">Aston Martin DBX</a>, you have just one engine choice: a 4.0-liter AMG twin-turbo V8 producing 542 horsepower and 516 lb-ft of torque. Impressive figures, no doubt, but in this day and age of <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/here-s-why-high-performance-suvs-make-absolutely-no-sense">high-performance SUVs</a>, more power is better and, in this case, possible. But that V8 may not do the trick. Speaking to Aston Martin CEO Andy Palmer, <a href="https://www.roadandtrack.com/new-cars/future-cars/a29858789/aston-martin-dbx-v-12-andy-palmer/">Road &amp; Track</a> was able to confirm the company's V12 fits under the DBX's hood.</p>
      <p>"We'll probably do other engine derivatives, we'll do other spec derivatives. As you do with any lifecycle management," Palmer said. "And obviously, in the same way as we do specials off of our DB11 platform, we may well do specials off this platform."</p>

      <p>Just because this 5.2-liter twin-turbo V12, the very same one found in the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/aston-martin/db11">DB11 AMR</a> where it makes 630 hp and 516 lb-ft, can be stuffed in the DBX doesn't necessarily mean it'll be an easy job. One main concern is whether or not the Mercedes-AMG-sourced nine-speed automatic currently in the DBX can handle the nearly additional 100 hp. Swapping out the entire powertrain can be a costly affair as significant re-engineering requirements will almost surely be needed.</p>
      <p>Even if the V12 option doesn't work out, Aston Martin has other options to squeeze more juice out of the DBX. Right off the bat, there's the simple option of increasing the current V8's output.</p>

      <p>In the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/mercedes-benz/amg-gt-63">Mercedes-AMG GT 63 S</a>, for example, it makes 630 hp and 664 lb-ft. It's also important to remember that power isn't always everything; it's the overall experience that matters most. A V12-powered DBX would offer unique different driving and handling characteristics, as well as a different sound. The SUV's attitude would be significantly altered.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, it would place the DBX directly against the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/rolls-royce/cullinan">Rolls-Royce Cullinan</a>, currently the only other SUV with a V12. There's also the W-12-powered <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/bentley/bentayga">Bentley Bentayga</a> to consider. Above all, a V12 would provide the DBX with bragging rights over any Lamborghini Urus owner.</p>
      <p>Lamborghini has more or less confirmed there are no immediate plans to <a href="https://carbuzz.com/features/aston-martin-dbx-vs-lamborghini-urus-how-do-they-compare">swap out the Urus' twin-turbo V8 for a V12</a>. Aston Martin has taken note of that.</p>
