      <h1>Athletics golden girls get SPOTY nominations on day of turmoil for their sport</h1>
      <h2>A month after Neil Black quit as performance director of UK Athletics, the governing body has forced newly appointed chief executive Zara Hyde-Peters to stand down</h2>

      <p>Dina Asher-Smith and Katarina Johnson-Thompson were tonight nominated for Sports Personality of the Year - as their sport suffered a fresh body blow.</p>
      <p>Britain’s two world champions joined a six-strong shortlist, alongside Raheem Sterling, Lewis Hamilton, Ben Stokes and Wales rugby captain Alun Wyn Jones.</p>
      <p>Yet athletics’ pride in being the only sport with multi-nominees was tempered by turmoil behind the scenes.</p>
      <p>A month after Neil Black quit as performance director of UK Athletics, the governing body has forced newly appointed chief executive Zara Hyde-Peters to stand down.</p>

      <p>The move follows claims she allowed her husband to continue coaching athletes despite being banned from teaching.</p>
      <p>Chris Clark, chair of UKA, revealed that the matter had been “fully” discussed at a UKA board meeting on Sunday.</p>
      <p>He added: “Following the meeting I had time with Zara to review the situation and we have agreed together, that she will now not be taking up her position as CEO on 1st December.”</p>
