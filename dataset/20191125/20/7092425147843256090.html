          <b>The 1996 family film <i>Matilda</i> remains a staple of many people's childhood - and now the director behind the beloved comedy has revealed he wants to make a sequel.</b>

      </p>
      <p>While many of you will remember that Danny DeVito starred in <i>Matilda</i>, which is based on the Roald Dahl novel, as the catty and arrogant car seller Harry Wormwood, many people are unaware that the <i>Always Sunny in Philadelphia</i> star also directed the film.</p>
      <p><i>Matilda</i> proved hugely popular when it was released over 23 years ago as it struck a chord with those who loved reading books larger than their body frames, shy kids, introverts, and anyone who felt like an outcast in their families/communities.</p>
      <p>And now DeVito has revealed that he'd be up for making a follow-up to the 90s classic which could revolve around the child of the now grown-up Matilda.</p>
      <p>While promoting his new film <i>Jumanji: The Next Level</i>, DeVito was asked which of his previous films he'd most like to revisit, with the 75-year-old actor revealing his desire to produce a sequel to the iconic fantasy film.</p>

      <p>"I always wanted to do Matilda 2, but when the kid was still a kid," DeVito told ComicBook.com.</p>
      <p>"But that was like 20 years ago, 25 years ago. Maybe Matilda has a kid and we can do something that, I don't know."</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, it appears unlikely that we will see a <i>Matilda</i> sequel any time soon.</p>
      <p>Mara Wilson, who starred as the precocious six and a half-year-old girl who has a passion for reading books, hasn’t appeared in a feature-length film since 2000’s Thomas and the Magic Railroad, according to IMDb.</p>
      <p>But with the film's 25th anniversary taking place in 2021, we're holding out hope that plans for a sequel could get off the ground in the near future.</p>
