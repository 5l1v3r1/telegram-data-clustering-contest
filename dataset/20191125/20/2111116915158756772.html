      <h3>This $699 MacBook Air deal makes it cheaper than an iPad Pro</h3>
      <p>It's an Apple oldie, but at this price, a goodie</p>

      <p>Apple made headlines when it abandoned the Butterfly keyboard in the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/macbook-pro-16-inch-2019-review">16-inch MacBook Pro</a>, but it's still there in the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/apple-macbook-air-2019">most recent MacBook Air</a>. In fact, you have to go all the way back to 2017 to get a livable keyboard in the Air – luckily Amazon has that exact model on sale.</p>
      <p>Right now you can pick up this sweet <a href="https://www.techradar.com/black-friday/black-friday-laptop-deals-the-best-prices-this-year">Black Friday laptop deal</a>, scoring the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/laptops-portable-pcs/laptops-and-netbooks/macbook-air-1300233/review">2017 MacBook Air</a> with an Intel Core i5 processor, 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD for just $699. It's an older processor to be sure, but it's really not <i>that</i> much slower than the current mid-2019 model, and this $300 <a href="https://www.techradar.com/black-friday/amazon-black-friday-deals-2019">Amazon Black Friday deal</a> is pretty awesome. </p>

      <p>This model of the MacBook Air is still using an old Intel dual-core processor, and a 900p display. That doesn't sound super great on paper, but if you have a kid that needs their first computer or just want something you can carry around without worrying about price, it can still do pretty much everything you throw at it. Plus, macOS is frankly amazing at working with older hardware. </p>
      <p>Plus, you can't forget the keyboard: this laptop came out before Apple started shoving the Butterfly keyboard into literally every laptop in its lineup. If you want a comfortable, quiet keyboard that won't break because it gets some dust on it, you can either get this laptop or spring for the <i>much more expensive</i> MacBook Pro 16-inch. If you ask us, it's an easy choice. </p>
