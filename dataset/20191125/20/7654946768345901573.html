      <p>Remains were discovered in the search for Aniah Blanchard, the missing stepdaughter of UFC heavyweight Walt Harris, officials said.</p>
      <p>The remains were found Monday in a rural area in Shorter, Ala., as authorities looked for the 19-year-old, who was reported missing Oct. 24, <a href="https://www.wrbl.com/news/tragic-human-remains-believed-to-be-missing-19-year-aniah-blanchard-located/">news station WRBL reported</a>.</p>
      <p>“I can confirm that human remains have been found and we have good reason to suspect they are that of Aniah Blanchard,” Lee County District Attorney Brandon Hughes told the outlet.</p>
      <p>It’s unclear what brought authorities to the remote road in Macon County, which is around 35 miles from where Blanchard was last seen on Oct. 23.</p>
      <p>Authorities <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/24/second-arrest-made-over-ufc-stars-missing-stepdaughter-aniah-blanchard/">arrested two people</a> in Blanchard’s disappearance after her <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/11/blood-of-ufc-stars-missing-stepdaughter-aniah-blanchard-found-inside-car/">abandoned car was found</a> in Montgomery with her own blood. They were identified as Ibraheem Yazeed, 29, and Antwain Shamar Fisher, 35.</p>
      <p>Police received a tip that Yazeed was allegedly seen forcing Blanchard into her car on Oct. 23 at an Auburn convenience store.</p>
