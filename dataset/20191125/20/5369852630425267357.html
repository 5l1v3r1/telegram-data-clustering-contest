      <p>MANCHESTER UNITED are still in need of “five or six signings”, says Gary Neville, with a Paul Pogba-less midfield proving to be a real “problem” for the Red Devils at the moment.</p>
      <p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer made just three additions to his ranks over the summer, with Daniel James, Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Harry Maguire snapped up.</p>
      <p>They are considered to be useful recruits for the present and future, but a number of experienced stars departed Old Trafford during the last window.</p>
      <p>Many have not been replaced, with United forced to put trust in academy graduates such as Scott McTominay and Andreas Pereira.</p>
      <p>They have fared admirably at times, but the Red Devils still find themselves short in important areas of the field.</p>
      <p>Neville believes strengthening is required from back to front, with goalkeeper the only area which is well covered by David de Gea and Sergio Romero.</p>
      <p>Big money will need to be invested plugging the other gaps, with injuries – such as that being endured by World Cup winner Pogba – highlighting the need for further change.</p>
      <p>“The midfield’s just a problem for United full stop, let’s be clear about it,” United legend Neville told Sky Sports.</p>
      <p>“Even with Scott McTominay in it’s a problem. They haven’t strengthened in that area, obviously Pogba’s injured.</p>
      <blockquote>“t’s a problem for them and it’s just not good enough, the midfield just doesn’t have good enough quality.</blockquote>
      <p>“They need a striker, they need two midfield players, they need a left-back – they need five or six signings.</p>
      <p>“They can’t do that until January and obviously the summer but the midfield will not go away as a problem for Manchester United just because of an injury.</p>
      <p>“It’s a problem full stop – it needs strengthening.”</p>

      <p>Solskjaer has previously stated that he expects to be in a position to bolster his ranks during the January transfer window.</p>
      <p>He has started to backtrack, though, with the Norwegian having revealed that loan deals may represent the height of United’s ambition during a period in which value for money is notoriously difficult to find.</p>
      <p>Solskjaer told reporters when quizzed on a possible winter budget: “It’s not about X amount of money.</p>
      <blockquote>[Buying players] is about who we think is going to be good for the club in the long term, not just for three or four months.</blockquote>
      <p>“[Are those people available?] Probably not, because that’s the thing in January — not many clubs will sell players they want to keep in January. </p>
      <p>“Maybe one or two could be a loan deal, but that’s not a money thing, that’s to help the team. But we’re getting players back. We’re looking at what can be available for us.”</p>
