      <h1>Everton fans consider Leeds United manager Marcelo Bielsa on Twitter</h1>

      <p>Everton could be on the lookout for a new manager with reports suggesting that Marco Silva could be about to lose his job as manager, after Saturday’s 2-0 defeat to Norwich City at home – and many Everton fans want Leeds boss Marcelo Bielsa.</p>
      <p>Silva’s side looked devoid of ideas and powerless to avoid defeat against a Norwich side that have been struggling in the top flight since being promoted. They were missing plenty through injury, but still produced a 2-0 win.</p>
      <p>Despite spending plenty of money, it seems former Watford and Hull City boss Silva is out of ideas at Goodison Park. The early favourites to replace the Portuguese gaffer are Toffees legend David Moyes, or Everton fans Eddie Howe.</p>

      <p>Earlier this year, Everton were strangely linked with Leeds manager Bielsa as Silva’s future as Toffees gaffer went under the microscope again. <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/1084988/Everton-Leeds-United-Marcelo-Bielsa-Marco-Silva-Premier-League-Farhad-Moshiri-Championship">The Daily Express claimed</a> Everton had shortlisted the Argentine manager.</p>
      <p>Bielsa pushed Leeds to within an inch of promotion last season before losing to Derby County in the play-offs. This season, Leeds sit second in the league as the second tier approaches the halfway stage. He earns £77,000 a week (<a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/marcelo-bielsa-gamble-leaves-leeds-14607482">Mirror</a>).</p>
      <p>The former Argentina, Marseille, Lille, Athletic Bilbao and Chile manager is only contracted until the end of the season, but it is agreed to extend it year by year depending on the feeling. Everton fans, though, want ‘El Loco’ on Merseyside.</p>
