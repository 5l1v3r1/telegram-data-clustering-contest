      <h1>Andy Murray admits he rested groin problem in Davis Cup ahead of Australian Open</h1>
      <h2>Andy Murray only played one match in the Davis Cup in Madrid last week and has revealed he has been struggling with his groin</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T20:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 20:00</time> by <a rel="author">Neil McLeman, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/neil-mcleman/</a></address>
      <p>Andy Murray has revealed he rested a groin injury at last week's Davis Cup to ensure he is fit to play the Australian Open.</p>
      <p>The former world No.1 played only one match in Madrid last week before sitting out the rest of the tournament.</p>
      <p>Captain Leon Smith concealed the three-time Grand Slam winner was suffering from the “bony bruise” as Great Britain reached the last four.</p>
      <p>Murray admitted he was a bag of nerves watching his brother Jamie losing the decisive doubles in the semi-finals to eventual champions Spain.</p>
      <p>And the Scot, who revealed he had arrived in the Spanish capital overweight after a month off, described the whole week as “tough”. Murray said: “I had a bit of an issue with my groin, pelvis. I wanted to play but I wasn't allowed to risk it.</p>

      <p>“I took the final decision but I’m obviously speaking to my physio, doctor, speaking to Leon.</p>
      <p>“I don't know exactly when I did it because I had a scan straight after the match with Tallon Griekspoor because my groin area was sore during the match.</p>
      <p>"I had noticed it a little bit a couple of days in the build-up so I didn't know because after Antwerp I took 12 days off or something and didn't hit any balls, and then I slowly built up till I got over to Madrid and then started practising hard and I noticed it was a bit sore.</p>
      <p>“It was more like a bony bruise. It’s mild. But that was something which if I had played on it, it could have got worse. And that’s why it was difficult for me.</p>

      <p>"Because I wanted to try and play, because I didn’t know how many opportunities you get to play again in the quarter-finals or semi-finals of the Davis Cup. So that was quite a difficult situation.</p>
      <p>"But then obviously the other guys were playing really well and it was like they can handle themselves. But I would have liked to have tried to play.</p>
      <p>“It was probably the right decision not to play. I wouldn’t have influenced probably the matches differently to any of the guys that played, ultimately. But obviously competitively I still wanted to get out there, try and play and try and help.”</p>

      <p>Murray, 32, now plans to fly out to Miami for a two-week training block on December 5 before returning to competitive action at the ATP Cup in Australia on January 3. The Australian Open, where Murray feared his career was finished this year, starts in Melbourne on January 20.</p>
      <p>“I guess the good thing about stopping when I did was that it’s mild, so it shouldn’t be long. We got at the beginning of the issue.”</p>
      <p>Murray was speaking in London before the premiere of the film Andy Murray: Resurfacing.</p>
      <p>The feature-length documentary will launch exclusively on Amazon Prime Video on Friday 29 November in over 200 countries and territories worldwide.</p>
