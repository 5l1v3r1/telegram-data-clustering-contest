      <h1>Why I would buy NAB and these ASX dividend shares</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T20:19:47+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 20:19</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fool.com.au/author/jamesmickleboro/" target="_blank">James Mickleboro</a></address>
      <p>The good news for income investors in this low interest rate environment is that the Australian share market is home to a large number of shares offering generous dividend yields.</p>
      <p>Perhaps the hardest thing is choosing which ones to buy over the others. To help you with your decision I have picked out three dividend shares which I think are great options right now.</p>
      <p>Here’s why I would buy them:</p>
      <h3>Helloworld Travel Ltd <a href="https://www.fool.com.au/company/Helloworld+Travel+Ltd/?ticker=ASX-HLO">(ASX: HLO)</a></h3>
      <p>I think this integrated travel company would be a good option for income investors. Helloworld was a solid performer in FY 2019 and looks set to build on this in FY 2020. It recently provided a first quarter update and revealed total transaction value growth of 10.4% and EBITDA growth of 7.7%. Pleasingly, management appears confident this can continue over the remainder of FY 2020, which I feel bodes well for its dividends. At present its shares offer a trailing fully franked 4.7% dividend.</p>
      <h3>National Australia Bank Ltd (ASX: NAB)</h3>
      <p>If you’re considering an investment in the banking sector, now could potentially be a good time to do it. Recent developments in the industry have dragged all the big four banks lower. The NAB share price, for example, is down 10% in less than two weeks. I think this is a buying opportunity, especially given its strong underlying performance in FY 2019 and its positive outlook due to its overweight exposure to SME lending. Another bonus is that this share price weakness means its shares now offer a trailing 6.35% fully franked dividend yield.</p>
      <h3>Wesfarmers Ltd <a href="https://www.fool.com.au/company/Wesfarmers+Ltd/?ticker=ASX-WES">(ASX: WES)</a></h3>
      <p>I think this conglomerate’s shares could be a good option for income investors. Especially with the housing market showing signs of improvement. This would be a big positive for Wesfarmers due to its heightened exposure to the housing market through its Bunnings, Kmart, and Target brands. A thriving housing market is likely to lead to solid demand for home-related goods and drive strong sales growth. This could lead to solid earnings growth and support further dividend increases. For now, I estimate that Wesfarmers will pay a FY 2020 dividend of $1.53 per share. This equates to a fully franked 3.6% dividend yield.</p>
