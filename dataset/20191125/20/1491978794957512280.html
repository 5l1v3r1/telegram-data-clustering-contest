        <i>Patel’s video art lands prestigious prize with engaging explorations of what it’s like growing up as a working-class British Asian</i>
      </p>
      <p>In one video he’s leaping from his grandmother’s sofa dressed as Spider-Man. Another shows him cheekily mimicking his car-mechanic dad during a tour of the latter’s workplace. Hetain Patel’s video work explores his family’s roots and the issues of identity and acceptance that they throw up – and it’s been rewarded with the 2019 Film London Jarman award, which recognises work in the field of the moving image.</p>
      <p>The 38-year-old from Bolton overcame competition from, among others, <a href="http://tenderpixel.com/represented-artists/rehana-zaman">Rehana Zaman</a>, whose videos have included archive footage of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/jul/03/toxteth-liverpool-riot-30-years">Toxteth race riots, </a>and Imran Perretta, whose work has commented on rendition and power structures.</p>

      <p>Patel’s work is engaging and often accessible, marked out by nods to big-budget Hollywood movies such as The Matrix and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. But beneath the surface it explores themes such as marginalisation, communication and cultural overlap.</p>
      <p>In a forthcoming interview with the Guardian, Patel describes the motivations for his work: “I’m interested in bridge-building. It comes from a personal place of wanting to fit in and be accepted.”</p>
      <p>He says winning the Jarman prize will be of immeasurable help for an artist in his position, especially as it comes with a £10,000 prize. “That’s a significant amount of money for someone like me. It will contribute to sustaining my practice, and helping me be less chaotic in the way I work.”</p>
      <p>The members of the Jarman jury said: “The virtuosity, beauty and humour of [Patel’s] works speak clearly of our current condition, trying to make sense of a polarised world that is far messier than we like to acknowledge. His films are technically sophisticated, and his use of sound and super-slow-motion video capture is masterful.”</p>
      <p>The award was announced at the Barbican, London, during an event that marked 25 years since the death of pioneering film-maker <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/derek-jarman">Derek Jarman</a>. Actor and director Rupert Everett, who knew Jarman, presented the award. Previous winners include Luke Fowler, Heather Phillipson and Daria Martin.</p>
      <p>Work by all six nominees will be on display at the Whitechapel Gallery, London, from 26 November to 8 December.</p>
