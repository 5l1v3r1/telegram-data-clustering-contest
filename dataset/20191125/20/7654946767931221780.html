      <h1>These great AirPod alternatives are over 50% off for Black Friday</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T20:44:34+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 20:44</time> by <a rel="author">Alex McGeeney, StackCommerce</a></address>
      <p>Apple’s new <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/28/apple-announces-new-airpods-pro-with-noise-cancellation-for-249/">AirPods Pro</a> are here. They’re better than the original AirPods, as they come with active noise cancellation and water resistance, but they still come up short in the battery department (five hours, or almost 24 with the charging case) and will put a hole in your wallet. Typical.</p>
      <p>Now, if you’re a die-hard Apple fan, there’s probably no convincing you to change things up. But if you’d rather keep your hard-earned dollars in your pocket, you can get a similar listening experience with the <a href="https://store.nypost.com/sales/pamu-slide-bluetooth-5-in-ear-headphones-with-wireless-charger-black?utm_source=nypost.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=pamu-slide-bluetooth-5-in-ear-headphones-with-wireless-charger-black&amp;utm_term=scsf-352573&amp;utm_content=a0x1P000004MyMS&amp;scsonar=1">PaMu Slide Bluetooth 5 In-Ear Headphones</a>. They cost less than half the sticker price of the AirPods Pro. Plus, they’re actually designed to stay in your ears, no matter how much you move, which is definitely a huge deal for those who have <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/09/03/the-mta-is-sick-of-picking-up-airpods-from-subway-tracks/">lost AirPods to subway tracks</a>.</p>
      <p>The PaMu Slide Headphones also boast a Qualcomm QCC3020 chip and the most advanced Bluetooth 5.0, so you’ll get unparalleled sonics with extra bass and seamless connectivity. Not to mention, these babies are also IPX6 water-resistant and can last you up to 60 hours with the included wireless charging case (which also doubles as a wireless phone charger).</p>
      <p>Originally $199, the PaMu Slide In-Ear Headphones, along with the wireless charging case are on sale for $99.99. Plus, you can get an extra 15% off using the code <b>BFSAVE15</b> and drop the price down to just $84.99.
