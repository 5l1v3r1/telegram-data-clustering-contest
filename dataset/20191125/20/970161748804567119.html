      <p>Dramatic home surveillance footage captured the moment a furious domestic abuser was shot dead by his ex-girlfriend dad.</p>
      <p>Brian Ingham, 39, arrived full of aggression at his former partner’s house in Lakeland, Florida, on November 21 to pick up their two year-old son as part of a custody agreement.</p>
      <p>He was filmed breaking his way into the family’s home through a door, before clutching his chest in pain after being shot.</p>
      <p>Ingham was then seen stumbling away while oozing blood, before collapsing and dying in the garden moments later.</p>
      <p>No charges have been filed against his killer, who suffered minor injuries during the confrontation.</p>

      <p>It began when Ingham’s mom Patricia went to the door to collect her grandson. Ingham’s ex has a restraining order in place preventing him from contacting her directly.</p>

      <p>The dad who later shot Ingham explained that his daughter was out on an errand, and asked Patricia Ingham to wait inside until she returned.</p>
      <p>Patricia Ingham was happy to do so, but the delay infuriated her son, who also dialed 911 to claim he was being barred from accessing his child.</p>
      <p>He continued to break his way into the home despite his ex’s dad warning him that he would shoot if he failed to do so.</p>
      <p>The man who shot Ingham, who has convictions for crimes including assault and battery, remained in the yard, and cooperated fully with sheriff’s deputies.</p>
      <p>Polk County Sheriff’s Office say his version of events lines up exactly with what the video shows, with criminal charges unlikely to be filed.</p>
      <p>Ingham’s son was uninjured in the commotion. His ex arrived home shortly after he was shot and killed.</p>
