      </p>
      <p>Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, the national chairman of All Progressives Congress (APC), has pleaded with the governors elected under the party to implement the N30,000 new minimum wage and the consequential adjustments.</p>
      <p>The Nation reports that Oshiomhole made the plea on Monday, November 25, in Jos at the federal government/Progressives Governors Forum (PGF) parley.</p>
      <p><b>Legit.ng</b> gathered that the former governor of Edo state noted that the payment would make the progressive governors to set a pace for other governors in the country.</p>
      <p>He said:<i> “As progressives, let us be the first to pay the new national minimum wage and not just the wage but also the consequential adjustments arising from it. Already, there are some proactive progressive governors that have taken steps to address this.</i></p>

      <p>
        <i>“I plead that you give this a priority, because when other governors are fighting whether or not to pay, you will say that progressive governors have paid. Where there is will, there will certainly be a way."</i>
      </p>
      <p>Oshiomhole also called on the APC governors to support the closure of all land borders by the federal government.</p>
      <p>He said that the nation’s borders should remain closed until neighbouring countries follow the protocols of fair trade.</p>
      <p>The national chairman in an interview with journalists, also lent his support to financial autonomy for local governments in the country.</p>
      <p>He said that local government autonomy was not negotiable.</p>
      <p><i>"Just as the federal government does not control state governor on how to manage his money, so should the state governors allow the local governments to function,"</i> he said</p>
      <p>He added that local governments should be allowed to operate the same way states operate with the federal government exercising oversight function.</p>

        <i>“Local governments should be autonomous, but autonomy doesn’t mean there should not be oversight.</i>
      </p>
      <p><i>“The same way the federal government goes after a state governor that breaks the financial rule, the same way state governor should go after local government that mismanages revenue that accrue to it,”</i> he said.</p>
