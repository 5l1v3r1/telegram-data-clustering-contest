        <b>Michael van Gerwen will begin the defence of his World Darts Championship title against either former BDO world champion Jelle Klaasen or Northern Ireland's Kevin Burness, after the draw was made live on Sky Sports News on Monday evening.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Van Gerwen defeated Michael Smith to clinch his third world title 12 months ago but he could face a tough tie against his compatriot Klaasen - a semi-finalist at Alexandra Palace back in 2016.</p>

      <p>Raymond van Barneveld will begin his final competitive event before retirement against experienced American Darin Young.</p>
      <p>The five-time world champion is competing in his 28th and final World Championship and could face his protege Jeffrey de Zwaan if he overcomes Young in round one.</p>
      <p>Two-time champion Gary Anderson could meet last year's quarter-finalist Brendan Dolan in the second round, if the resurgent Northern Irishman overcomes Indian qualifier Nitin Kumar.</p>

      <p>This is the only major ranking tournament in which James Wade has never reached the final and the nine-time major winner begins his bid for world title glory against either Ritchie Edhouse or Russia's World Cup captain Boris Koltsov.</p>
      <p>Ninth seed Ian White will play either Darius Labanauskas or Matthew Edgar - who meet in round one for the second straight year, whilst in-form Dave Chisnall battles Vincent van der Voort or Irish youngster Keane Barry.</p>
      <p>Three-time BDO world champion Glen Durrant faces a tough assignment on his Alexandra Palace debut. He will collide with either two-time Pro Tour winner Jose De Sousa or Brisbane Darts Masters winner Damon Heta.</p>
