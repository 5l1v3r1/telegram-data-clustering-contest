      <p>The New York Knicks have been the doormat of the NBA for quite some time and for NBA champion Richard Jefferson, the fact that the Knicks were the only team to offer him a contract in the summer of 2018, he knew it was time to call it quits.Â </p>
      <p>Jefferson let as much be known while calling the Knicks game on Sunday afternoon. During the broadcast, Jefferson snarks: "Knicks? No, I'll retire. That's why I retired, they were the one team that offered me a job."</p>
      <p>The Knicks organization issued a statement responding to Jefferson's claims which read, in part, "For clarification purposes, it is not true that the New York Knicks offered Richard Jefferson a contract in either the summer of 2018 or 2019."</p>
