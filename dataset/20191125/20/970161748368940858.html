      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/caitlyn-jenner/">Caitlyn Jenner</a>’s appearance on <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/22/are-kendall-and-kylie-jenner-and-the-kardashians-watching-caitlyn-on-im-a-celeb-in-america-11200479/"> has not gone unnoticed by the Kardashian clan</a> – with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/23/what-has-kim-kardashian-said-about-caitlyn-jenners-im-a-celebrity-stint-as-she-breaks-silence-11205620/">Kim K the first to break her silence</a> about her appearance in the jungle.</p>
      <p>The reality star took to Twitter late last week to share a video of Caitlyn delivering a rousing speech to her fellow celebs, ending with an apparent reference to Rise and Shine, the song her daughter Kylie Jenner has sung to baby Stormi.</p>
      <p>‘I literally recorded this and set this as my alarm a few weeks ago,’ Kim said of the clip.</p>
      <p>Caitlyn has played a pretty significant role in the life of Kim and her sisters – but just how is she related to the clan?</p>
      <p>Here’s what you need to know…</p>
      <h3>How is Caitlyn Jenner related to the Kardashians?</h3>
      <p>Caitlyn is related to the Kardashians <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/caitlyn-jenners-family-exes-kids-kardashians-11180247/">through her marriage to Kris Jenner</a> – making Kim, Khloe, Kourtney and Rob Kardashian her step-children.</p>

      <p>She was married to Kris Jenner from 1991 until 2014, before she transitioned.</p>

      <p>However Kris was already mother to the Kardashian sisters and their brother – who are her children from her first marriage to lawyer Robert Kardashian, whom she was married to from 1978 until 1991.</p>

      <p>Caitlyn also has two extremely famous biological daughters with Kris – <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/im-a-celebritys-caitlyn-jenner-opens-up-about-being-a-father-and-reveals-her-kids-still-call-her-dad-ill-be-your-dad-till-the-day-i-die-11197359/">supermodel Kendall, 24, and 21-year-old make-up entrepreneur and social media favourite Kylie.</a></p>
      <p>In total, she has six biological children from three marriages.</p>
      <h3>Do Caitlyn and the Kardashians get on?</h3>

      <p>The relationship between Caitlyn and the sisters <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/im-celebritycaitlyn-jenner-kardashians-11170629/">hasn’t always been plain sailing,</a> with Caitlyn and Kim going through a rocky patch after Caitlyn published her memoir, where it was perceived she was making digs at Kris and the Kardashian lifestyle.</p>
      <p>However it seems the pair may have reconnected lately, with Kim being spotted at Caitlyn’s 70th birthday celebrations in October.</p>

      <p>Kourtney and Caitlyn also appear to have fixed their relationship, however things have been strained between her and Khloe, who didn’t attend Caitlyn’s 70th birthday, and who was noticeably left out of a social media post Caitlyn made celebrating all the ‘amazing’ mothers in her life – despite her being mum to one-year-old daughter True.</p>
      <p>Caitlyn and Kris are reportedly on good terms – although it’s been predicted she might spill a few more family secrets on the show.</p>

      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/23/im-celebritys-caitlyn-jenner-open-marriage-kris-jenner-according-psychic-11207348/">Psychic Chris Riley told metro.co.uk:</a> ‘She is very respectful of her family and personal life. I feel she’s already discussed with her family the things that they’d prefer her not to discuss, especially with regards to their relationships and personal lives.’</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘I do think that she may open up about her marriage to Kris Jenner, but it won’t be to get sympathy, nor will she “bad mouth” her. I think it’ll be general conversation as she opens up to her campmates.’</p>
