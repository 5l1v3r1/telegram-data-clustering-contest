      <h1>3 Finalists Named For College Football’s Top Player Award</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T20:33:34+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 20:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>The Heisman Trophy won’t name its finalists for another two weeks, but the Maxwell Award, given to college football’s top player, has already named its finalists.</p>
      <p>The Maxwell Award, presented each year by the Maxwell Football Club, has named three finalists:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>LSU QB Joe Burrow</li>
        <li>Oklahoma QB Jalen Hurts</li>
        <li>Ohio State DE Chase Young</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Maxwell Award and the Heisman Trophy don’t always line up exactly the same, but it’s usually a pretty good indication of who will end up in New York.</p>
      <p>Burrow is a lock to be a Heisman Trophy finalist, while Hurts and Young are strong contenders, too.</p>
