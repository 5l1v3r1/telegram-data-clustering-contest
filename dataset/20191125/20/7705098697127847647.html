      <h1>Deborah Chow’s The Mandalorian Experience Will Carry Over To Obi-Wan</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T20:30:44+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 20:30</time> by <a rel="author">Robert Workman</a></address>
      <p>Director Deborah Chow helmed the third episode of <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/the-mandalorian"><b>The Mandalorian</b></a>, which premiered last week on Disney+. She reflected on that experience in a recent interview with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/22/arts/television/the-mandalorian-star-wars-baby-yoda.html">The New York Times</a>. Chow also explained how it helped her prepare for what lies ahead on the <b>Obi-Wan </b>series for Disney+.</p>
      <p>“One of the biggest benefits is that I just spent the last year in the <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/star-wars"><b>Star Wars</b></a> universe and I had great mentors, coming in under Jon (Favreau) and Dave (Filoni),” noted Chow. “Absorbing that, I feel, was the best training I could have had to take on the next one.”</p>
      <p>“So much of it just feeling it and understanding it, on an instinctual level, to know what’s right and what’s wrong with it,” continued Chow. “And there’s so much knowledge — every prop, every costume is important. Every detail really matters.”</p>
      <p>Chow <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tv/467725-obi-wan-kenobis-disney-original-series-lines-up-a-director">was named as a director of the series</a> during D23 Expo, shortly after Ewan McGregor confirmed his Obi-Wan return.</p>

      <p>However, there is at least one character that won’t make it in <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/obi-wan"><b>Obi-Wan</b></a>’s show.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think the baby (Yoda) will be coming with us on that one,” noted Chow. “I think the baby steals the show.”</p>
