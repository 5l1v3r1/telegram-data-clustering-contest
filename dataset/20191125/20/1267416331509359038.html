      <p>It looks like the Big Three have dropped the cost of rate plans in Manitoba and Saskatchewan ahead of the holiday shopping season.</p>
      <p>Telus and Rogers both reduced rate plans by $10, while Bell dropped prices by $20.</p>
      <p>Vancouver-based national telecom Telus reduced the price of its Peace of Mind, Peace of Mind Connect and Simple Share plans by $10 per month in Manitoba and Saskatchewan. The new costs for the starting bring-your-own-device (BYOD) rate are as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Peace of Mind — $65 per month, 10GB of unlimited high-speed data</li>
        <li>Peace of Mind Connect — $75, $90 and $115 per month for 10GB, 20GB and 50GB of unlimited high-speed data</li>
        <li>Simple Share — $60, $75 and $90 per month for 5GB, 10GB and 20GB of shareable data</li>
      </ul>
      <p>All plans include unlimited calling and messaging. Once you pass over your high-speed data limit, speeds are capped at up to 512Kbps.</p>
      <p>Likewise, Rogers reduced the cost of its Infinite plans, which offer a set amount of high-speed data followed by unlimited usage at up to 512Kbps speeds. Those plans at the starting BYOD rate are as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Infinite +10 – $65 per month for 10GB of high-speed data</li>
        <li>Infinite +20 – $85 per month for 20GB of high-speed data</li>
        <li>Infinite +50 – $115 per month for 50GB of high-speed data</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Again, all plans include unlimited calling and texting.</p>
      <p>Finally, Bell reduced the price of its plans by $20 (the plans were already reduced by $10, but received a second $10 reduction. This is on both its ‘Unlimited’ plans and its ‘Connect Everything’ plans. Below are the prices at the starting BYOD rate:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Unlimited – $65, $85 and $115 per month for 10GB, 20GB and 50GB of high-speed data</li>
        <li>Connect Everything – $60, $65, $85 and $115 per month for 5GB, 10GB, 20GB and 50GB of shareable data</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Unlimited plans also include unlimited usage beyond the high-speed cap throttled to a maximum of 512Kbps speeds. Both the Connect Everything and Unlimited plans offer unlimited calling and texting.</p>
