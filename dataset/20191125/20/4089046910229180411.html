      <p><b>KURE, N.C. (WECT) --</b> Two baby turtles at a North Carolina aquarium need new names. Can you help them?</p>
      <p>WECT reported the North Carolina Aquarium at Fort Fisher is hosting a public contest to help name two baby loggerhead sea turtles in the aquarium's care.</p>
      <p>The staff there have five names that voters can choose from: Bubbles, Hatch, Noggin, Pearl and Scute. Voting kicked off on Monday and is expected to wrap up on Dec. 3 with the winning names being announced on Dec. 4. Go <a href="http://www.ncaquariums.com/fort-fisher-name-the-loggerheads">here to vote</a>.</p>
      <p>“Giving these sea turtles a name allows our guests to more deeply connect with the animals and better understand how our actions impact them and other marine animals,” said Gail Lemiec, aquarium educator.</p>
