As the official hydration partner, Aquafina supplied more than 350,000 bottles at the event and installed several recycling stations with promoters to educate and encourage visitors to recycle. Aquafina’s sustainable solutions partner Naqaa, sorted, recovered and baled the collections at its materials recovery facility, in addition to supplying a daily dashboard with impact stats to track progress.<br/><br/>“Formula E is all about our impact on the environment, making it an excellent opportunity for PepsiCo, through ifs Aquafina brand, to showcase our commitment to build a world where plastic never becomes waste,” said Nadim Nakfoor, MENA FOBO, Senior Vice President &amp; Business Unit General Manager for PepsiCo.<br/><br/>Nakfoor also highlighted the important role of stakeholder engagement and active partnerships: “By working with our partners – Al Jomaih Bottling Plants and Naqaa – we are able to provide hydration to visitors through purified Aquafina water, while upholding our responsibility towards the planet by ensuring as many plastic water bottles as possible are recycled after the event.”<br/><br/>Naqaa, which has a proven track record for environmental solutions, believes its contribution helped make the Formula E race the most environmentally friendly edition yet.<br/><br/>“By establishing the recycling system at this Formula E, Aquafina set a pioneering example of how companies can make a positive impact on the environment.
