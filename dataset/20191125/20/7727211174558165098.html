      <h1>Iceland staff step in to help nan, 76, who couldn't carry shopping bags home</h1>
      <h2>Myra Gore was seen putting all her shopping back on the shelves before staff stepped in</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T20:06:09+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 20:06</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/lottie-gibbons/" target="_blank">Lottie Gibbons</a></address>
      <p>Iceland has received huge praise after making an incredibly kind gesture to a 76-year-old nan.</p>
      <p>Myra Gore, was doing her 'big shop' at <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/town-centre-dealt-another-blow-17245869">her local Iceland branch</a> when she ran into trouble.</p>
      <p>The nan from <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/ellesmere-port">Ellesmere Port</a> relies on Iceland's delivery service after her husband, who was in charge of getting the groceries, died in June.</p>
      <p>Myra also suffers from crippling arthritis which leaves her in extreme pain if she carries more than she can manage.</p>

      <p>Her granddaughter Cheryl <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/">told the ECHO</a> : "My granddad used to do all the shopping, he was quite savvy online so he would order it to be delivered.</p>
      <p>"But my nan doesn't really know how to use the Internet, she can't send an email or anything so she uses Iceland's service where you can shop in store and have your groceries delivered to your door later on."</p>
      <p>Last Wednesday, as usual Myra visited the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/ellesmere-port">Ellesmere Port</a> Iceland store.</p>

      <p>But after gathering her items, she went to the checkout where she was told that the option for delivery was unavailable.</p>
      <p>Without any other options, Myra started to put her shopping back on the shelves.</p>
      <p>It was then two Iceland employees approached Myra with a heartwarming offer.</p>
      <p>One of the staff members mentioned that she was finishing her shift soon and proposed to drive Myra back home along with her groceries.</p>

      <p>Cheryl said her nan was "completely overwhelmed" by the offer, as without their help she would have been forced to make a number of trips to the shops to pick up items one at a time.</p>
      <p>Cheryl said: "The thought and what they did, it has just touched us all.</p>
      <p>"Nothing like this has ever happened to her, actually nothing as kind as this has ever happened to our family.</p>
      <p>"My nan was just really grateful, all of the staff were so thoughtful and kind to her."</p>
