      <p>After generations of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/franchise/pokemon/701">Pokémon</a> games, the community is finally coming to its senses over <i>Pokémon Sword and Shield</i>’s version of the creepy lamp-ghost Pokémon, Lampent.</p>
      <p>In a recent <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/e1g8t9/i_love_lamp/">post on the Gaming subreddit</a>, user sycoskater pointed out some alarming subtext surrounding the sentient lamp. Lampent’s Pokédex description reads: “It lurks in the cities, pretending to be a lamp; once it find someone whose death is near, it will trail quietly after them.”</p>
      <p>If this was the real-life description of a perspective friend or pet, you’d never talk to them again — let alone let them live in your pocket. And yet players have been capturing these things in Poké Balls since <i>Pokémon Black</i> and<i> White</i>. But Lampent’s attraction to death gets worse. Lampent isn’t exactly a subtle Pokémon — it’s a floating lamp for god’s sake.</p>

      <p>When camping in <i>Sword and Shield</i>, players with Lampents in their party can get this message: “Lampent looks like it wants to be with you forever.” Other Pokémon can say this, albeit with their name and less creepy visage slotted in instead. Still, it’s not really the thing you want to hear from a Pokémon that’s well known for being the harbinger of death.</p>
      <p>We’re not here to suggest that Lampent isn’t a cute Pokémon. Something about its peaceful flame and small, yellow eyes are appealing — especially to those of us interested in the macabre. But this Pokémon has the audacity to show up in your camp, eat (?) your curry, and then prophecy your doom.</p>
      <p>Get out of here Lampent,<a href="https://sonicpokemon.fandom.com/wiki/Haunter"> at least Haunter just eats my dreams</a>.</p>
