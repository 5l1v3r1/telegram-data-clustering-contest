      <p>"I never approached this character from that physicalized aspect. I always just inhabited him with my voice," Conroy said. "When you do that in a recording studio, it's a very intimate experience and you're sort of living in your own imagination. You do it with your eyes closed and you're in this other world, and you have Mark Hamill feeding you [need], and the other actors (because we always recorded together in the booths.)"</p>

      <p>"To actually be on the set, in the physical world, and to be walking as the character and inhabiting the character in three dimensions, it was a real transition for me," he added. "It did take a while to get used to, I have to admit. I was surprised because I know the character so well."</p>
      <p>Conroy will appear as Bruce Wayne in "Crisis on Infinite Earths: Hour Two," which will see Kate Kane and Kara Danvers go off in search of him.</p>
