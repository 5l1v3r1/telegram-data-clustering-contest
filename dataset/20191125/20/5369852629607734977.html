      <p>DUTCH FOX SPORTS on Monday suspended former Netherlands star Marco van Basten for a week as an analyst for saying “Sieg Heil” on air as a “joke of bad taste.”</p>
      <p>The broadcaster said it would pay the former Dutch great’s salary for the week to the Dutch Institute for War, Holocaust and Genocide studies.</p>
      <p>Van Basten, 55, made the comment on Fox Sports’ pay-to-view channel, after an interview ahead of the Eredivisie clash between Ajax and Heracles.</p>
      <p>His words could be heard in the studio moments after TV presenter Hans Kraay’s interview in German with Heracles’ German manager Frank Wormuth.</p>
      <p>“Not too pretty, sieg heil, pfannkuchen (pancake),” Van Basten said, using the Nazi German salute.</p>
      <p>“It was not my intention at all to shock people. I only wanted to ‘explain’ Hans’ German,” a contrite Van Basten said.</p>
