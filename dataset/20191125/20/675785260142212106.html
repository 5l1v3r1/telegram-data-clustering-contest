      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: As the Irish boy band celebrated 20 years in the business and their new No1 album, Mirror Online quizzed them with a bunch of silly questions</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T20:33:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 20:33</time> by <a rel="author">Vicki Newman, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/vicki-newman/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/westlife">Westlife</a> took on a series of silly questions as they were quizzed by Mirror Online.</p>
      <p>We put 20 questions to the lads to mark the two decades since the release of their debut album when they popped into the offices for an exclusive chat.</p>
      <p>We asked everything from who's the funniest to who farts the most and who's the loudest to who's the most likely to be abducted by aliens.</p>
      <p>We also quizzed Mark Feehily, Kian Egan and Nicky Byrne - without Shane Filan who was too poorly to attend - on who'd survive the longest in an apocalypse and which one of them is manager Louis Walsh's favourite.</p>
      <p>The lads agreed that Nicky was the loudest, but couldn't agree on which one of them is the best looking.</p>

      <p>Although Nicky, who admitted to being a big fan of himself, proclaimed he was the answer for any question that made him better than the others.</p>
      <p>When asked who farts the most, they all chose Shane, especially today when he's at home with a tummy bug.</p>
      <p>When the question about who's the best dancer came, Nicky, who took part in <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/strictly-come-dancing">Strictly Come Dancing</a> in 2012, immediately answered himself.</p>
      <p>But Kian said: "Listen, just because you do Strictly doesn't mean you're a good dancer, right."</p>
      <p>When asked who'd survive the longest in a post-apocalyptic world, Nicky said: "Definitely Kian. Only because he won the jungle and he fed the camp that year and he was the daddy of the camp."</p>

        <figcaption>They all agreed Shane would be abducted by aliens</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>When ask which of them is Louis' favourite, Nicky and Mark both held up pictures of Kian, while Kian answered Shane.</p>
      <p>Nicky leaned into Kian, shouting: "Are you kidding me?"</p>
      <p>Kian said: "It's changed. Back in the day it was me but not any more."</p>
      <p>Nicky then told us: "Ask that question again and say 'least favourite'."</p>
      <p>When we did as we were told, all three of the boys immediately held up a picture of Nicky, and Mark also held up a picture of himself.</p>

        <figcaption>They laughed as they shared their answers</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Impersonating Louis, Kian said: "There was three in the Bee Gees."</p>
      <p>When asked about who they'd eat first if they were ever stranded on a deserted island, Mark warned the boys this "could go really wrong".</p>
      <p>Nicky said he was too lean, so you wouldn't get much meat off him.</p>
      <p>He said: "I'd be gone in a second. If you ate me you wouldn't get fat."</p>
      <p>When asked which of them is the most likely to be abducted by aliens, they all agreed it was Shane, with Kian impersonating him to say: "They thought I was one of them."</p>

        <figcaption>Nicky thought he was the answer for lots of questions</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Mark said: "Shane would be abducted by them because they'd want to study him to see how he's so amazing."</p>
      <p>Nicky added: "He'd say, 'My voice is so unique that the aliens wanted to hear me in outer space'."</p>
      <p>When we asked who spends the most time naked, Nicky quickly held up his own picture, and the others agreed.</p>
      <p>Kian said: "I reckon Nicky walks around naked at home all the time."</p>
      <p>Nicky jumped in: "You've got to let it hang out, haven't you? You've got to just be free as a bird."</p>
