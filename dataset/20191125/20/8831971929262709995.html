      <p>Any girl who has a large collection of shoes knows how hard it can get to store them. A big shelf is the best option to have all your footwear in one place, so definitely consider it if you have enough space. You can also adjust the shelving based on the height of specific pairs.</p>

      <p>How frustrating is it when all your jewelry gets tangled up, and you have no time to sort it out? To never face this problem again, get yourself an organizer. It can be a jewelry box or even a specific drawer with different compartments to keep everything in place.</p>

      <h3>Mirrored Doors</h3>

      <p>Mirrors let you make any space visually bigger. Integrating them into the doors of your closet will allow you to fully transform the area without taking up any space. Also, who doesn’t like a nice full-length mirror for taking those outfit picks?</p>

      <h3>Multilevel Shelving</h3>

      <p>Hanging all of your clothing will take up a lot of room in the wardrobe, no doubt. Here, shelves come to the rescue. You can stack everything neatly on a shelf, and if they go too high, just store the items that are not suitable for the current season there.</p>

      <h3>Clothing Rack</h3>

      <p>For those of you who live in a dorm or just have limited space in their room, a clothing rack is an amazing way to organize your clothes and accessories. It’s very handy, as you can hang prepared outfits there, as well as hang something like your bags or scarves on the sides.</p>

      <h3>Wardrobe Hooks</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Hooks let you store multiple items while saving some precious space. These can be installed on your wall, door or even inside a wardrobe. Outwear, scarves and bags take up limited room when stored in this way.</p>

      <h3>LED Lights</h3>
