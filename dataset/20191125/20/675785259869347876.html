      <h1>Matt Targett sick on pitch during Aston Villa clash with Newcastle</h1>
      <h2>Aston Villa defender Matt Targett was seen vomiting on the pitch as he return to action after suffering concussion against Wolves in his last game</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T20:38:47+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 20:38</time> by <a rel="author">Rich Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/rich-jones/</a></address>
      <p>Aston Villa left-back Matt Targett was seen being sick on the pitch in the early stages of their game with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Newcastle</a> at Villa Park.</p>
      <p>Targett keeled over and vomited near the touchline.</p>
      <p>He eventually was handed a drink of water and continued playing, despite looking uncomfortable.</p>
      <p>He rubbed his neck as he ran off and resumed without any major delay.</p>
      <p>Around 20 minutes of the game had been completed at the time of the incident.</p>
      <p>Targett was back in action for Villa after being forced off shortly before half-time against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> in their last fixture following a blow to the head.</p>

      <p>Targett also attempted to continue on that occasion having been caught by Diogo Jota's knee, only to concede he was unfit to continue and be withdrawn.</p>
      <p>Manager Dean Smith confirmed in the run-up to their return to action after the international break that he had been substituted due to concussion but had returned to training.</p>

      <p>He started at left-back as former boss Steve Bruce returned to Villa Park with his Newcastle side.</p>
      <p>Villa had the best of the early action and took a deserved lead after half an hour when Conor Hourihane fired in a superb free-kick beyond Martin Dubravka.</p>
      <p>They soon doubled their lead via Anwar El Ghazi as they took control of the game before the break.</p>
      <p>After the weekend's Premier League action, a win for newly promoted Villa could move them up to 15th in the table, just a point behind Newcastle, who had won their previous two games.</p>
