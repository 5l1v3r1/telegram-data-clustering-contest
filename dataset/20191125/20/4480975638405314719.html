      <h1>Forex Today: Dollar wins but cautious prevails</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T20:10:11+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 20:10</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fxstreet.com/author/fxstreet-team" target="_blank">FXStreet Team</a></address>
      <p>Here is what you need to know Tuesday, November 26th:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The greenback was the best performer, appreciating against most major rivals on the back of encouraging US-China trade-related headlines.  EUR/USD barely holding above 1.1000 as the German IFO survey showed that expectations remain subdued.</li>
        <li>The Sterling was an exception, rallying on weekend polls, indicating that Conservatives lead surveys ahead of December’s election. The advantage narrowed to 7% according to an ICM/Reuters survey, liming pound’s bullish scope.</li>
        <li>Save-haven assets and commodity-linked currencies suffered the most. USD/JPY flirting with 109.00.</li>
        <li>Gold fell to $1,455.00 a troy ounce, crude oil prices edged marginally lower.</li>
        <li>Cryptocurrencies trimmed early losses, ended the day with modest gains.</li>
        <li>Equities closed in the green worldwide, although US Treasury yields were pretty much unchanged, somehow hinting a prevalent cautious stance. </li>
      </ul>
