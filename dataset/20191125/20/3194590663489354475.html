        <b>Elvina Ibru, Nollywood actress, says she would love to meet her 2004 rapist, expressing confidence of seeing the armed robber again.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ibru, who played the role of Mopelola in the blockbuster movie ‘Bling Lagosians’, said this during an interview with NAN on Monday. She also urged rape victims to speak out.</p>
      <p>According to her, having experienced the ugly incident, there was a need for others to take a cue from what she had been through which suggested her advocacy group.</p>
      <p>“I was raped by an armed robber in 2004, it wasn’t my fault and not an incident that warrants me taking up microphone about, so I set up an advocacy group to address it,” she said.</p>
      <p>“The group is to manage the young and old ones who had been through the same ugly incident like me. I know if I had to go all out to media about the situation, it will fizzle out.</p>
      <p>“However, it is not something I have been silent about; I don’t know the person that raped me, but I will meet him again, I know I will meet him.”</p>
      <p>The multi-talented actor and writer urged Nollywood stakeholders to be professional in their conduct, adding that the industry needed the touch of core professionals.</p>
      <p>“Although I can say that I am not a veteran in the movies because I just spiced up my acting recently, but I have been on stage for a long time,” she said.</p>
      <p>“What I can bring to the table for my colleagues is that they must be professional with their jobs as much as possible.</p>
      <p>“There are times that we need to up our games as actors, producers and other professions in the film making industry; we need to be professional and do things right.</p>
      <p>“The fault in our movies did not just happen because we lack money, they also come with the way we handle things as professionals, though, money is also a big factor.</p>
      <p>“There are other things that are attached to film making which we need to look at to move the industry forward.”</p>
      <p>Ibru was a guest and an anchor at the 2019 Future Awards held that the Balmoral Convention Centre, Federal Palace Hotel, Lagos Island.</p>
