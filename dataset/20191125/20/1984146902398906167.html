      <p>If there's on e song that is guaranteed to get Geordies going any time of the day on any day of the week it's Sweet Caroline and, while it's not a festive song, it went down a treat at Newcastle Christmas Market on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The Neil Diamond hit, which was recently <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/whats-on/music-nightlife-news/newcastles-favourite-car-karaoke-song-17265989">revealed to be Newcastle's favourite car karaoke track</a>, is without a doubt an absolute classic and there are total scenes every time it is played somewhere in the city.</p>
      <p>Over the past year, we've seen people go mad for it at Paddy Fest and loads of hands in the air when it gets played at Stack on a Saturday or at Kroud Karaoke.</p>
      <p>And on Sunday it was in the recently opened <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/vip-cabins-newcastle-christmas-market-17267826">Apres Ski Bar</a> at the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/full-list-newcastle-christmas-market-17267723">Christmas Market</a> at Monument, that the sing-along anthem prompted great excitement <i><b>as you can see in the video above.</b></i></p>
      <p>The Alpine themed bar is one of the big highlights of the city's biggest Christmas Market to date and, as well as serving up festive tipples like mulled wine and mulled cider, it has a full entertainment lineup laid on between now and the end of December.</p>
      <p>On Sunday afternoon it was the job of local singer Abi Garrido to get everyone in the seasonal spirit and the minute started singing Sweet Caroline the crowd went wild.</p>
      <p>Abi, who reached judges houses on The X Factor in 2014 and is a former Metro Radio Big Audition winner, was blown away by the response and told Chronicle Live "I absolutely loved singing at the new winter wonderland! It was so amazing hearing everyone singing along with me. It’s such a great addition to the city and I’m just buzzing that I get to be a part of it!"</p>
      <p>If you fancy a slice of the Sweet Caroline action, Abi is back performing at the Ski Bar on December 12, 14, 21 and 28 and there are loads of other talented local singer on the bill throughout the festive season.</p>
