      <p>The Scotland striker came off the bench in the second half of the 4-0 Ladbrokes Premiership win over Livingston at Parkhead on Saturday for his first appearance since August due to personal problems, illness and injury.</p>
      <p>In an interview with Celtic TV, boss Lennon encouraged the 29-year-old "natural born goalscorer", who signed from Wolves in January 2014, to keep on top of his fitness and go from strength to strength at the club.</p>

      <p>"I have spoken to him about this," said the former Celtic captain and midfielder, who also hopes the shoulder injury <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jonny-hayes/"><b>Jonny Hayes</b></a> picked up against LiviÂ is not as bad as first feared.</p>
      <p>"I hope so. I didn't come to Celtic until I was 29 and people thought I had been here all my life.</p>
      <p>"If you look after yourself and keep yourself in good condition, you can play for a long time now, the way the modern game is going.</p>
      <p>"He certainly has the appetite for it. There is a hunger there to get back in and he really missed playing.</p>
      <p>"Hopefully he will get fitter and stronger and have a good run of games now. He needs to do extra work, he needs to stay on top of his condition.</p>

      <p>"He is in reasonable condition now and he is working hard and to make sure he stays fit.</p>
      <p>"The fitter you are, the more robust you become and then you are less likely to pick up soft tissue injuries which is one that he had with a thigh strain.</p>
      <p>"It is good to have him back, it adds that little bit of quality to the attack and strength that we already have."</p>
      <p>Hayes injured his shoulder in the opening minutes but stayed on until early in the second half before being replaced by Greg Taylor.</p>

      <p>Lennon said: "He is having a scan this evening.</p>
      <p>"We are hoping it is just a muscle injury and if that is the case he should be good to go in the next week or so.</p>
      <p>"We have a couple coming back. Mikey Johnston is back in training, we are hoping Mohamed Elyounoussi will be training by the end of the week.</p>
      <p>"So fingers crossed Jonny isn't as bad as we first feared."</p>
