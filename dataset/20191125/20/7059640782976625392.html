      <h1>Is Burlington Stores' Uptrend Still in Stock?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T20:39:36+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 20:39</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://realmoney.thestreet.com/author/1668375/bruce-kamich/all.html" target="_blank">BRUCE KAMICH</a></address>
      <p>Burlington Stores (<a href="https://realmoney.thestreet.com/quote/BURL.html">BURL</a>) is due to report its latest quarterly earnings numbers on Tuesday. Let's see what this retailer is up to on the charts ahead of the fundamental numbers. </p>
      <p>  In the daily bar chart of  <a href="http://secure2.thestreet.com/cap/prm.do?OID=031628">Action Alerts PLUS</a> holding BURL, below, we can see a pattern of higher lows from March and higher highs from April. Prices are just above the rising 50-day moving average line and above the rising 200-day moving average line.   The On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line has been moving up since March and it should soon make a confirming new high of its own. The trend-following Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator is in a bullish configuration rising from the zero line.   </p>

      <p>  <b>Bottom-line strategy: </b>I have no special knowledge of BUR:'s earnings tomorrow but the charts look positive and a trade at $211.69 should refresh the uptrend.  </p>
