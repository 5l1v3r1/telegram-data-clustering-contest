      <h1>Dublin businesses to pay more in rates as budget passes</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T20:27:34+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 20:27</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.rte.ie/author/933395-dyane-connor/%20" target="_blank">Dyane Connor, https://www.facebook.com/rtenews/</a></address>
      <p>Business owners in the capital will have to pay almost 3% more in commercial rates next year after Dublin City Council passed its budget for 2020 tonight.</p>
      <p>Local authority rents will not be increased, as was previously warned, but there will be hikes for on-street parking and the East Link Toll.</p>
      <p>The price hikes are to make up for a loss of â‚¬8.4m in income from Irish Water-owned properties and an increase in insurance.</p>
      <p>On street parking will increase by 10% from next July while the East Link toll will increase by 36% from April.</p>
      <p>A majority of councillors voted for commercial rates to be increased by 2.7% from 1 January.</p>
