      <h1>WFAN is helpless to salvage the fallout from Mike Francesa’s failed return</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T20:00:02+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 20:00</time> by <a rel="author">Andrew Marchand</a></address>
      <p>While the ratings destruction of Mike Francesa continues in his final drive-time book, ESPN New York is in deep discussions to strengthen its hand in the local market with yet another former WFAN headliner, The Post has learned.</p>
      <p>Ex-FAN afternoon host Chris Carlin is in advanced talks with ESPN New York to work evenings, following the Michael Kay Show, according to sources.</p>
      <p>The Post has previously reported that <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/16/mike-francesa-fallout-wfan-nearing-successor-espn-lures-bart-scott/">Bart Scott plans to leave FAN</a> to co-host a new local show from 1-3 p.m. on ESPN New York in 2020.</p>
      <p>Scott is expected to be teamed with Alan Hahn, according to sources. Hahn’s promotion from nights will open up the spot for Carlin, who could also add some ESPN Radio talk and play-by-play roles.</p>
      <p>Entercom, WFAN’s parent company, badly wants to center its daytime programming around Scott and spent last week — after The Post story broke about Scott’s plans to leave — trying to convince him to change his mind, according to sources.</p>
      <p>There is no evidence yet that Scott has seriously reconsidered the move that will also give him a role on ESPN TV, including “Get Up!”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Kay continues to dominate Francesa in the ratings, even as the rest of FAN’s main shows strongly outperform their rivals.</p>
      <p>After <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/28/mike-francesa-ratings-disaster-is-here-in-uncertain-wfan-times/">winning by 1.4 share in the first month</a>, Kay, the No. 1 rated program in the entire afternoon radio market, beat Francesa 7.5-6.2 in the second month. If Francesa’s debated streaming numbers are added, Kay still holds a 7.5 to 6.9 advantage. Yogi might even say it is over.</p>
      <p>Two months into the Nielsen Audio book is the equivalent of six innings of a baseball game. Francesa would need a dramatic, maybe implausible, rally to win his final book.</p>
      <p>In mornings, Boomer Esiason &amp; Gregg Giannotti dominated, finishing first by a wide margin. ESPN’s Radio’s national show, Golic &amp; Wingo, was 12th in New York.</p>
      <p>Giannotti’s contract is up at the end of the year, but Entercom has finally stepped up its offer and guarantees to Giannotti, according to sources. Gio is now expected to return.</p>
      <p>In the way WFAN looks at the ratings (streaming included), Scott and Maggie Gray finished first with a 7.0 share, while Stephen A. Smith’s national show was a respectable sixth at 5.3</p>
      <p>What Francesa will be doing next year is still not entirely known. Entercom hopes the 66-year-old can help boost Radio.com, while he still could have a shortened daily presence on FAN.</p>
      <p>Francesa has talked on the air as if he is semi-retiring again, but Entercom has presented him with a three-year contract to work. Par for the Francesa course, there is uncertainty.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, with Scott expected to keep his commitment to ESPN, WFAN wants to promote Evan Roberts and Joe Benigno to afternoons, sources reiterated.</p>
      <p>Nothing is finalized as of yet since a slot in the afternoons should result in a substantial raise for Roberts and Benigno. Joe &amp; Evan were again atop the ratings at 8.0 with the stream included at their mid-day slot.</p>
      <p>Humpty &amp; Canty with Rothenberg were seventh at 5.1 for ESPN New York. The trio has to fight uphill as Joe &amp; Evan have the much more favorable New York morning lead in.</p>
      <p>With Carlin already gone and Scott intent on following him, it leaves Gray, who has one more year left on her contract, as the last remaining member of CMB. She is in line to move to middays if Joe &amp; Evan go to afternoons.</p>
      <p>FAN continues to have internal discussions about whom to pair with Gray, according to sources. The two leading candidates are John Jastremski and Marc Malusis, though others can’t be entirely ruled out as of yet.</p>
      <p>Malusis, the former Mike &amp; the Mad Dog producer, has now been a host for a good while, mostly on Entercom-owned CBS Sports Radio and SNY. He hosted a showed with Gray on CBS Sports Radio. Jastremski currently does overnights.</p>
      <p>Now, in the new year on 98.7 FM ESPN New York, Scott and Carlin will sandwich Kay’s programs as the station further goes after FAN in the tri-state area with local programming from 10 a.m. to midnight, with the genial Larry Hardesty expected to continue after Carlin or games at night. ESPN New York is upping its stakes in the sports-radio rivalry.</p>
      <p>ESPN New York appears as if it has clearly passed Francesa, without any asterisks about streaming.</p>
      <p>While it is not entirely over yet, the stain that Kay said he wanted to put on Francesa’s legacy looks more and more like it will be a permanent one.</p>
      <p>FAN once tried to replace Francesa and compete against Kay with CMB. Francesa stomped back on the scene after his faux retirements.</p>
      <p>Now, it looks as if two-thirds of CMB will be on its rival, ESPN New York, in 2020 to further help the Kay Show, which is suddenly the only program FAN can’t beat.</p>
