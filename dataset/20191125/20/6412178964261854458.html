        <b>Tottenham goalkeeper Hugo Lloris has fears that he could be axed from the side by new boss Jose Mourinho, according to reports.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/tag/hugo-lloris"><b>The 32-year-old</b></a> has been one of the club’s key players since joining from Lyon in 2012 and was a firm favourite under former manager Mauricio Pochettino, who was sacked last week.</p>
      <p>Lloris is currently out with an elbow injury he suffered in October and is expected to return in the new year, but according to <a href="https://www.footballinsider247.com/exclusive-tottenham-untouchable-loved-by-poch-tells-friends-he-fears-mourinho-axe/"><b>Football Insider</b></a>, the Spurs skipper is fearful that the change in the dugout will hamper his chances of remaining in the team.</p>
      <p>The source says that the goalkeeper has informed friends that he feels he will not be considered in the same manner he was by Pochettino under Mourinho, which could lead to his exit from the team.</p>
      <p>It is claimed that while a move for a new man between the sticks is unlikely in January, Mourinho could look to do so in the summer despite second-choice stopper Paulo Gazzaniga making a solid impression since stepping in for his teammate.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/tottenham-hotspur"><b>Spurs</b></a> climbed to 10th in the Premier League table on Saturday courtesy of a 3-2 win over West Ham in Mourinho’s first game in charge, with a clash against Olympiakos in the Champions League up next.</p>
