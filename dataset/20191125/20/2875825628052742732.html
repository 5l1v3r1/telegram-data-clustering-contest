      <p>Tommy looked comfy and casual for his travels as he sat back in a black zip-up tracksuit.</p>
      <p>He proved that he put his Love Island success to good use as he stored his essential belongings in a luxurious Louis Vuitton satchel bag, which was perfectly placed on the table.</p>
      <p>Molly-Mae also opted for casual attire for the trip as she donned a stylish black beanie hat, leggings and a long sleeved top, while she sported a hint of bling with a subtle gold necklace.</p>
