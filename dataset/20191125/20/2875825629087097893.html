      <p>It's fair to say there’s no love lost between <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here</a> star Nadine Coyle and her Girls Aloud bandmates.</p>
      <p>While I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here star Nadine has insisted there's no bad blood, that wasn't the case when the group disbanded in a blaze of bitterness in 2013.</p>
      <p>Nadine said at the time that she didn’t want the split, claiming the bandmates Cheryl Tweedy, Nicola Roberts, Kimberley Walsh and Sarah Harding went behind her back and blindsided her with the news via their manager just minutes before the final show of their reunion tour.</p>

      <p>Taking to <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> the next morning, a furious Nadine told fans: “You should know by now I had no part in any of this split business. I couldn't stop them. I had the best time &amp; want to keep going. Xxxx”</p>
      <p>Cheryl hit back, telling Attitude magazine that Nadine was “full of s***” and accusing her of holding the band to “ransom”.</p>
      <p>“She was the one who wanted to make a solo record. Which is why we took the hiatus. She wants to come out and say we broke the band up? No! She shouldn’t tell porkie pies,” the Geordie star raged.</p>
      <p>"Okay, so do you want us to tell the truth? She wasn’t going to make another Girls Aloud record until she got a solo deal. I feel she held us to ransom and then made her solo record deal.</p>

      <p>"It’s the truth. She’s saying that we broke the band up. So there you go."</p>
      <p>And their public mud-slinging was just the tip of the iceberg, according to a source, who claimed it kicked off royally behind the scenes on that fateful night.</p>
      <p>“It was ­really dramatic and there were a lot of tears. Nadine and Cheryl were both fighting their corner and nobody was prepared to budge,” the insider told the Daily Star.</p>
      <p>“Nadine was saying [Cheryl] was ­trying to control everything.</p>

      <p>“But Cheryl thinks it’s nonsense. They only ever agreed to get back together for an anniversary tour and then leave it at that.</p>
      <p>The split came after Nadine suffered a career crisis following the flop of her solo album while Cheryl's soared during Girls Aloud's 2009 hiatus.</p>
      <p>Cheryl had joined The <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/x-factor">X Factor</a> a year earlier and already had a solo deal, giving her a head start.</p>
      <p>While her albums 3 Words and Messy Little Raindrops shot to number one, Nadine’s album Insatiable limped into the Uk album chart at number 47 before fading away.</p>
      <p>Nadine admitted she was jealous of Cheryl’s set up, telling Closer magazine: “I think anyone would be envious that Cheryl has Simon Cowell's backing.”</p>

      <p>And Simon made it quite clear he was Team Chez when he made a snide dig about Nadine following her second failed bid at a solo career in 2017.</p>
      <p>When Cheryl joined him for the X Factor’s judges’ houses, Simon urged her to reunite Girls Aloud before sniping: "Why don’t we get Nadine for dinner?...the three of us and we should talk about it.</p>
      <p>"I mean Nadine is not exactly storming the charts as a solo artist is she?”</p>
      <p>Irish-born Nadine has since insisted she’s "indifferent" to the band, admitting, in 2017 that they hadn't spoke since the split.</p>

      <p>“We’re all very, very different characters," she said, admitting she was "sad" about how things panned out.</p>
      <p>"For so long... you want everybody to think we’re best friends and we have pillow fights and, you know, drink milkshakes,” she said.</p>
      <p>“That’s what I wanted it to be. I really, really wanted that to be, but it just wasn’t how it was."</p>
