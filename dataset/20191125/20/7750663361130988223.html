      <p>The 21-year-old is entering the final months of his current deal at Old Trafford and he will be free to speak to other European clubs in January.</p>
      <p>United's fear of losing the defender has prompted them to trigger a one-year extension in the Dutchman's deal, giving them more time to work out a longer contract.</p>
      <p><i>The Sun</i> reports that the Red Devils will be prepared to let Fosu-Mensah leave on loan in January for the second half of the season if an appropriate offer comes in.</p>
      <p>The former Ajax academy prospect has not played since April, when he suffered a serious cruciate ligament injury while playing for Fulham.</p>
      <p>Fosu-Mensah has made 21 appearances for United since making his professional debut in February 2016.</p>
