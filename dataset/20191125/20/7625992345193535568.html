      <p>Authorities in Alabama believe they have discovered the remains of missing 19-year-old student <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/aniah-blanchard-update-ufc-star-missing-stepdaughter-life-threatening-injury-alabama-police-today-2019-11-11/">Aniah Blanchard</a>, <a href="https://www.cbs42.com/news/national/tragic-human-remains-believed-to-be-missing-19-year-aniah-blanchard-located/">CBS affiliate WRBL</a> reported. Blanchard, the stepdaughter of UFC heavyweight star Walt Harris, was reported missing by her family on October 24.</p>
      <p>"I can confirm that human remains have been found and we have good reason to suspect they are that of Aniah Blanchard," said District Attorney Brandon Hughes.</p>
      <p>The remains were discovered near the New Hope Baptist Church in Macon County.</p>

      <p>Police arrested two suspects before the remains were found: Antwon "Squirmy" Fisher, 35, and Ibraheem Yazeed, 30, both of whom are charged with first degree kidnapping, according to WRBL. A third man, David Johnson Jr., was arrested Monday and charged with hindering prosecution. A judge issued a gag order in the case, preventing authorities from discussing it.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, police discovered Blanchard's SUV at an apartment complex in Montgomery. Authorities said it was damaged and there was a significant amount of her blood inside, WRBL reported. They believe she suffered a "life-threatening injury."</p>
