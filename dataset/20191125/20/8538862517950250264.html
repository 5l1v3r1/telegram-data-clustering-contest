      <p>This week, the real-life Tony Stark – better known as Elon Musk – unveiled Tesla's Cybertruck. It's a futuristic-like pickup featuring an "exo-skeleton" using the same "cold rolled" stainless steel alloy featured on the SpaceX Mars rocket prototype. Elon says the design was partly inspired by Roger Moore's Lotus Espirit S1 in the 007 film, <i>The Spy Who Loved Me</i>.</p>
      <p>It's also meant to be bulletproof but the live demonstration didn't go quite as planned, with Elon uttering "oh my f***ing god" under his breath as the side window smashed, while reassuring the audience it didn't completely shatter. As amusing as it was when the live demonstration didn't go as planned, what was truly hilarious was the Internet's reaction to the truck's aesthetics.</p>
      <p>A lot of people on social media seem to think the Cybertruck looks like a low-polygon pickup from an old video game. One sound comparison via Twitter was to the <a href="https://twitter.com/aureylian/status/1197731057359097857">early years</a> of Lara Croft's <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps3/tomb_raider">Tomb Raider</a> series on the original PlayStation. The best tweet of all though might have been this single reply Elon Musk received from the official <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/cyberpunk_2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> account:</p>

      <p>Hell yeah, Cybertruck and Cyberpunk 2077 teaming up – could the timing of this be any better? If we don't see some sort of collaboration or at least some free DLC allowing us to drive around in a Cybertruck by April next year, we're going to be thoroughly disappointed. As long as Microsoft doesn't feature the truck in the <a href="https://twitter.com/WCGamingTweets/status/1197752718133276672">Halo series</a> anytime soon, we don't see why this shouldn't be given the green light in Cyberpunk 2077.</p>
      <p>What do you think? Should the Cybertruck make a cameo in Cyberpunk? Could we expect to see it in Gran Turismo? Tell Musk what you think down below.</p>
