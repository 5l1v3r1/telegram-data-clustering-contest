      </p>
      <p>He stated this during the official closing ceremony/Terminal parade of the 21-day orientation course for the 2019 batch ‘C’ (Stream I) Oyo State corps members held at the permanent orientation camp, Ogbakuta, Iseyin, Oyo state.</p>

      <p>According to the governor, who was represented by the deputy governor, Raufu Olaniyan, the host Communities are highly expectant, therefore, the corps members must proceed to impact positively on them.</p>
      <p>His words: “Be determined to leave your host locality better than you met it and impact the knowledge acquired from your various institutions on the younger ones.</p>
      <p>“For those of you that would pay proper attention to the development of these communities by executing viable projects, I assure you that such noble efforts would not go unrewarded.</p>
      <p>Declaring the orientation for the batch closed, he assured the corps members that the Oyo State administration would not only make their stay worthwhile but memorable.</p>
      <p>Earlier in her address, the state coordinator, Ambekemo Eniola also advised the corps members to steer clear of any act of indiscipline or anti-social behaviour.</p>
      <p>“Start to exhibit and nurture the leadership traits in you by beginning to dream big and create visions that will outlast you in any community you find yourself.”</p>
