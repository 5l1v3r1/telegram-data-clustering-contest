      <p><a href="http://gizmochina.com/tag/sony">Sony</a> Corporation recently held a press conference in China. During the event, the head of Sony’s imaging and sensing solutions business had cause to throw some light into the company’s operations. He also detailed the innovation journey and future of Sony Image Sensing innovative technology.which has made tremendous progress over the years.</p>

      <p>Sony admitted that the rapid growth in demand for multi-camera and large-size chips in the mobile phone market (especially in the Chinese market) exceeded its expectations. In response to this growth, the Japanese company has ramped up production.</p>
      <h4>EDITOR’S PICK: <a href="https://www.gizmochina.com/2019/10/01/first-samples-from-the-100mp-mi-mix-alpha-is-here-we-are-not-impressed">First Samples from the 108MP Mi Mix Alpha is here &amp; we are not impressed!</a></h4>
      <p>In addition, the company is also working to improvements to its new image sensors in aspects such as HDR, low light, autofocus and high-speed focus. The company hints that the ultimate goal is to catch up with SLR in terms of quality. That is a tall order considering the level of quality SLR cameras are capable of capturing. The company says it will deploy large-size chips and will also gradually apply polarized sensing technology for industrial applications and new technology in surveillance, TOF and automotive sensing to mobile phone chips. The Sony exec also added; “Sony Group has a wealth of business, sensors are used in professional camera products, micro-cameras, cars, robots and other products. Our chips have to fulfil many technical demands. This is an advantage over competitors, and we will continue to deploy this.”</p>

      <p>The imaging giant also plans to deploy fusing tech to achieve new tweaks such as HDR + background blur, to make the principal objects super sharp while the background is blurred. There is also HDR+ autofocus and AF Pixel autofocus pixel technology which allows each pixel to quickly focus in dark conditions</p>
      <p>To buttress the importance of the camera business, Sony Corporation Semiconductor (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. President Kimura Shin disclosed that during the 2019 financial year, Sony Semiconductor is expected to achieve 1.04 trillion yen in sales with image sensors contributing a massive 890 billion yen. 80% of this revenue is said to come from mobile image sensors with China undoubtedly ranking as the company’s largest market.</p>
