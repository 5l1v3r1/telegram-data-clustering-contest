        <b>Scheming nanny Jade Rowan (Lottie Henshall) has taken another step into the dark side after she has shamelessly framed a young child for starting a fire in Coronation Street. <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/25/coronation-street-spoilers-jade-fiz-hope-fire-11214979/">The tutor clearly has an axe to grind with </a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/fiz/">Fiz Stape</a> (<a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jennie-mcalpine/">Jennie McAlpine</a>) and Tyrone Dobbs (Alan Halsall) and she certainly managed to cause a big rift in the family tonight.</b>
      </p>
      <p>As a fire took hold out in the back yard, Fiz and Tyrone were horrified to find Hope watching it in a trance while the flames almost injured Jack Webster. As Fiz deduced that Hope must have been responsible for the arson, Tyrone was staggered when she admitted that she believes her daughter was also behind the fire at the factory several months ago.</p>
      <p>As Tyrone let rip at Hope, telling her he didn’t want to be around an arsonist, Fiz tried to calm things down while Jade watched and offered to take Hope up to her room. As she did so, she assured the youngster that she believes her, even if her mummy doesn’t.</p>

      <p>With Hope taking confidence from this, Jade smirked to herself and stuffed a box of matches in her own back pocket, confirming that she had in fact started the fire in order to frame Hope. But what is her motive for wanting to bring harm to the family?</p>

      <p>It is just the beginning of her spiteful vendetta too as future scenes will see her make accusations of child abuse against Fiz and Tyrone, leading to the couple facing court. <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/coronation-street-spoilers-nanny-jade-fiz-stape-tyrone-11195109/">And when social services take their children away, they are broken hearted.</a></p>
      <p>As viewers begin to learn more about Jade and what she has against the family, another revelation will come this week – but the nightmare is only just starting for Fiz and Tyrone.</p>
      <p>But how far will Jade go to destroy them?</p>
