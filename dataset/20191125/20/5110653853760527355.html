      <h1>Monday Night Football Betting Preview: Ravens-Rams odds, trends, pick</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T20:43:22+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 20:43</time> by <a rel="author">Dan Karpuc</a></address>
      <p>Although it might still be a tad bit too early to label this as a “must-win” game for theRams (6-4), they’re currently sitting outside of the NFC playoff picture. While they have the edge over the Bears (5-6), Eagles (5-6), and Panthers (5-6), they’re in the danger zone, hovering behind the Seahawks (9-2) and Vikings (8-3) in the wild card race. A loss in this game would be catastrophic to their playoff aspirations. The spreadlists Baltimore as athree-point road favorite,and the over/under total is set at 47 points.</p>
      <p>The Ravens (8-2) are widely regarded as the team to beat in the AFC based on their recent play and the ascension of quarterback Lamar Jackson, who is a definite MVP contender. They’re slated as the second seed in the AFC and are clicking on all cylinders. After beating down the Texans 41-7 last week, Baltimore will look to show up on the second part of their three-game test (Houston, the Rams, and the 49ers next week).</p>

      <p>
        <b>Ravens outlook</b>
      </p>
      <p>Remember when some people were wondering whether Lamar Jackson could emerge as an NFL starter… at wide receiver? Those days are long gone, and if the season ended right now, he’d most likely be neck-and-neck with Russell Wilson for the MVP award. The Ravens are winners of six straight games and have also covered in four straight, including a 16-point win against the Seahawks in Seattle, a 17-point win at home against the Patriots, a 36-point win on the road against the Bengals, and a 34-point win at home against the Texans last week. While Jackson and Baltimore’s offense has clicked all season long, their defense turned the corner five games ago and has allowed an average of 14.6 points per contest since.</p>
      <p>Both the Ravens and the Rams have middling defenses against the pass andtop-seven rushing defenses. It’s important to note that it might be tough sledding for both Mark Ingram (and the Rams' Todd Gurley). But, the way Baltimore’s offense is clicking right now, it might be unstoppable. The Ravens lead the NFL by averaging 3.19 points per drive (no other team averages more than 2.71 and only three others average more than 2.38).</p>

        <b>MONDAY NIGHT DFS: <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/fantasy/news/draftkings-week-12-monday-night-showdown-picks-advice-for-ravens-vs-rams-nfl-dfs/cziu3666hlf21oofxuddddsax">DraftKings Showdown picks</a></b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Rams outlook</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Rams have won and covered in three of their past four games (against the Falcons, Bengals and Bears)but dropped a crucial road contest against the Steelers in Week 10. Luckily for Jared Goff, Todd Gurley and Cooper Kupp, two other crucial offensive playmakers are slated to return for this game. Brandin Cooks (head) and Robert Woods (personal) are both deemed likely to suit up, and they add two important dimensions to their team’s offensive attack.</p>
      <p>While Sean McVay’s offense hasn’t exactly lit it up recently, scoring 17 or fewer points in three of their last five games (which contributed to their past five contests finishing under the total), their defense has stepped it up and has seemed to turn the corner. They’ve allowed an average of 11.8 points per game over their past four games and held opponents to 10 or fewer points in three of those four contests. Although facing Lamar Jackson is a challenge of its own -- even for an elite defense (shout out to the Patriots) -- it’s worth mentioning how dominant this Rams unit has been.</p>
