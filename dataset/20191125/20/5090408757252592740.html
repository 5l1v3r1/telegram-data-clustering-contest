      <h1>Ford is coming after Tesla and wants an 'apples to apples' showdown between its F-150 and Elon Musk's Cybertruck, Business Insider - Business Insider Singapore</h1>

        <li><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/tesla">Tesla</a> CEO Elon Musk picked a fight with <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/ford">Ford</a> as he unveiled his long-awaited electric pickup truck last week.</li>
        <li>
          <b>In a sometimes awkward presentation, Musk took direct shots at the automaker and showed the Cybertruck beating the F-150 in a tug-of-war.</b>
        </li>
        <li>“Hey @elonmusk send us a Cybertruck and we will do the apples to apples test for you,” Sunny Madra, who leads Ford X, the automaker’s mobility-ventures lab, <a href="https://twitter.com/sundeep/status/1198988235252199424">said on Twitter on Monday</a>.</li>

      <p>A top Ford executive implied on Monday that Tesla’s video showing its <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-cybertruck-pickup-truck-pictures-info-details-price-2019-11">new Cybertruck</a> beating an F-150 in a tug-of-war might not have been completely fair.</p>
      <p>“Hey @elonmusk send us a Cybertruck and we will do the apples to apples test for you,” Sunny Madra, who leads Ford X, the automaker’s mobility-ventures lab, <a href="https://twitter.com/sundeep/status/1198988235252199424">said on Twitter</a>.</p>

      <p>On Thursday, as part of a laser-filled reveal <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/video-tesla-cybertruck-launch-blooper-armour-windows-smashed-oops-2019-11">that didn’t always go to plan</a>, Tesla CEO Elon Musk <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-ford-porsche-tesla-cybertruck-reveal-2019-11">went out of his way to take shots at Ford</a> and other automakers.</p>
      <p>“You want a truck that’s really tough, not fake tough,” he said.</p>

      <p>Ford was quick to fight back.</p>
      <p>“We’ve always focused on serving our truck customers regardless of what others say or do,” a Ford representative told Business Insider.</p>
      <p>Madra’s tweet appears to be the first time since the Tesla reveal that a Ford executive has publicly discussed the Cybertruck. However, the company has big plans for its own electric-truck fleet.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, Ford <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/electric-ford-f150-prototype-towed-a-million-pounds-2019-7">showed off an electric F-150 prototype</a> that handily towed 1 million pounds of train cars for 1,000 feet. (For context, a properly configured Ford F-150 pickup truck can tow 13,200 pounds.)</p>
      <p>It’s not clear whether Tesla will take Madra up on the offer of a test, which could be the first of its kind for the nascent electric-vehicle industry – and certainly a treat for automotive fans.</p>
