      <p>You may not be the only ones monitoring your baby, these worried parents warn.</p>
      <p>A Seattle family was disturbed to discover that a stranger was watching and communicating with their young daughter through what they believe was a “hacked” baby monitor.</p>
      <p>Jo and John, who withheld their last names and ages, <a href="https://www.king5.com/article/news/local/baby-monitor-hack/281-0f06509a-42bd-4108-b884-718c79e55e0f">tell KING 5 News</a> that they were on the lower level of their home last week when they heard their 3-year-old daughter, Jayden, calling from her room.</p>
      <p>When Jo got to her daughter and asked what the problem was, she claims the toddler made a scary statement.</p>
      <p>“She said the ‘voice is talking to me,’ ” <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/stranger-hacks-baby-monitor-tells-child-i-love-you-n1090046">Jo tells her local NBC affiliate</a>. “I said, ‘The voice is talking to you, what’s going on?’ And she said the man said, ‘Jayden, I love you.’ And I said, ‘What?’ ”</p>
      <p>Jo claims the voice <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Monitor-Taococo-Wireless-Security-Detection/dp/B07L8TS26P/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=Taococo+Video+Baby+Monitor&amp;qid=1574715156&amp;sr=8-3&amp;tag=nypost-20">came from the Taococo Video Baby Monitor</a> — a gift from a baby shower for Jayden’s baby sibling roughly six months ago.</p>
      <p>Jo and John had previously noticed it acting odd, its settings resetting, the camera angle moving independently and John’s mother reported hearing a strange voice coming from Jayden’s room — but had thought nothing of it.</p>
      <p>When they realized the device was possibly hacked, Jo’s response was physical.</p>
      <p>“I instantly wanted to throw up. My heart was in my throat,” the worried mom says. “Someone was in our daughter’s room … I don’t know what all they saw, what they got from that. Is it the fear alone they’re enjoying? It’s just so unsettling to not know.”</p>
      <p>The couple has since unplugged the camera.</p>
      <p>The model has glowing online reviews and, at under $50, is affordable, says Jo — which makes her question how widespread the problem of creeps hacking into them could be.</p>
      <p>“How many families are going to get this camera that’s not secure?” asks Jo. “It’s just, like, really upsetting.”</p>
      <p>The monitor’s China-based manufacturer, Shenzhen Jinbaixun Technology Co., has yet to respond to several requests for comment.</p>
      <p>While the family contacted Seattle police, a spokesperson tells KING 5 there is no open investigation.</p>
