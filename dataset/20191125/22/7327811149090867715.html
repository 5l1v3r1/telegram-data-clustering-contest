      <p>MIDTOWN, Manhattan (WABC) -- The Paris Theatre, one of the oldest art houses in the United States and the last single-screen theater in New York, is back in business after being shuttered earlier this year.</p>
      <p><a href="https://abc7ny.com/entertainment/iconic-paris-theatre-in-manhattan-closes-its-doors/5501293/">Back in August</a>, a note saying its lease had ended was posted on the theater's doors on 58th Street.</p>
      <p>On Monday, Netflix announced a lease agreement to keep the theater open and save the beloved institution.</p>
      <p>The company plans to use the theater for special events, screenings, and theatrical releases of its films.</p>
      <p>Terms of the lease were not disclosed.</p>
      <p>The iconic Paris Theatre opened in 1948.</p>
      <p>Marlene Dietrich cut the ribbon on the theater, and on the corner of Grand Army Plaza right next to the Plaza Hotel, it has occupied a prime spot in high culture for decades as one of the only places to see independent and foreign films.</p>
      <p>The theater closed in August 2019 after a successful run of Ron Howard's Pavarotti.</p>
      <p>Just over two months later, it's open for business again and showing Marriage Story by acclaimed New York filmmaker Noah Baumbach.</p>
