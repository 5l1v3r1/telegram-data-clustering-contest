      <h1>Dave Cormack in Aberdeen stadium admission as he refuses to rule out Pittodrie stay</h1>
      <h2>The new chairman insists a new stadium is still the club’s preferred option but admits the numbers must add up.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T22:29:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 22:29</time> by <a rel="author">Scott Burns, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/scott-burns/</a></address>
      <p>Incoming <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/dave-cormack">Dave Cormack</a> has refused to rule out Aberdeen remaining at Pittodrie.</p>
      <p>The new chairman insists a new stadium is still the club’s preferred option.</p>
      <p>But he concedes staying at their current ground must remain on the agenda if funding for the new £45million HQ at Kingsford proves impossible – although Cormack insists <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/aberdeen-fc">Aberdeen</a> won’t sell their top stars to bankroll it.</p>
      <p>He is confident he and his new board will be able to raise the money for the new stadia but admitted the timescale has had to be knocked back to 2023.</p>
      <p>Cormack explained: “The 2023 date is moveable.</p>

      <p>“You can never say never (with regards Pittodrie) and if we can’t raise the money then we can’t do it but we are confident our best opportunity is to move out to Kingsford.</p>
      <p>“I’m not fixated on two years here or six years here.</p>
      <p>“Listen, £45million is a lot to raise and if you look at our recent report we’ve had Pittodrie valued recently and there is no point in us trying to sell.</p>
      <p>“We wouldn’t maximise the value of Pittodrie in the current downturn.</p>
      <p>“We are working with consultants in London and we have a significant amount of money lined up from companies ready to invest.</p>
      <p>"We also want Atlanta United to take a look at what the stadium would look like and the real costs associated with it.</p>
      <p>“Nobody can commit to money that isn’t there today but a new stadium is our best option.”</p>

      <p>Cormack points to the money it has cost Hearts to redevelop their main stand and knows it could cost more to bring Pittodrie up to scratch than it does building a new ground.</p>
      <p>“Let’s say we got £15million for the same of Pittodrie. Hearts spent £18million from building their new stand,” the Aberdeen director claimed.</p>
      <p>“It would cost us £55million to redevelop the stands here so when you weigh that up against £45million for a custom-built stadium which costs £45million and you have reduced the actual cost to £30million due to the sale of Pittodrie then that’s a £25million difference at Kingsford.</p>
      <p>“Plus, we think we can raise £3-5million more of income which will allow us to invest in the team.”</p>
      <p>The Dons have real value in their team with the likes of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scott-mckenna">Scott McKenna</a>, <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/sam-cosgrove">Sam Cosgrove</a> and Lewis Ferguson and their transfer valuations could go a long way to meeting the growing £45million cost of their proposed new ground at Kingsford.</p>

      <p>Cormack, who announced a link-up with Atlanta and £5m of investment, is adamant the priority will always be the success on the pitch and that when players are sold the bulk of that money will be r-invested in the team.</p>
      <p>Cormack confirmed: “I want to make sure we are investing in the football team as there is no way we are going to invest in a stadium and have a team which is ninth in the league.</p>
      <p>“The critical factor for us is the performance of the first team.</p>
      <p>“It’s a hard balancing act.</p>
      <p>“We have resisted offers for players. We did it in the summer and not just for Scott McKenna.</p>
      <p>“But at the right time when there are players coming through, of course we will look at accepting offers.</p>
      <p>“Scott will move on at some stage for his career.”</p>
