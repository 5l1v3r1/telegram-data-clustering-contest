      <h1>Pro skateboarder Lizzie Armanto says there's a new Tony Hawk game in the works</h1>
      <h2>As rumours continue to swirl.</h2>

      <p>It's been four years since the world was last graced with a Tony Hawk's Pro Skater game - and, as we've all tried hard to forget, it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-10-02-tony-hawks-pro-skater-5-review">was rubbish</a>. Even so, despite late-life missteps, love for the series lingers on - and recent whispers from those seemingly in the know suggest that fans may finally be set to get the Pro Skater revival they've been hoping for.</p>
      <p>Word of a new Tony Hawk game initially began to circulate over the weekend when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-06-10-accurate-e3-leaker-says-nintendo-threatened-legal-action-against-them">reliable industry leaker Sabi</a> shared word from an Activision source, suggesting that prototype remakes of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 and 2 had been doing the rounds internally.</p>
      <p>Sabi did note, however, that "Nobody seems to know if both games are being fully remade, or if it's just a test for something else.” That uncertainty might well have already been cleared up elsewhere, though, thanks to a recent interview unearthed by fans.</p>

      <p>Back in October, it turns out, professional skateboarder Lizzie Armanto told The Nine Club podcast - during a brief back-and-forth about her appearance in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5 - that "[Hawk is] coming out with another one, and I'll be in that too."</p>
      <p>That revelation can be heard at around the 2:05:00 mark in <a href="https://soundcloud.com/thenineclub/168-lizzie-armanto">this Soundcloud upload</a>, but, intriguingly, the line (as noted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/activision-is-working-on-tony-hawks-pro-skater-remakes-according-to-this-gnarly-new-rumor/">GamesRadar</a>) has since been excised from other versions - including <a href="https://youtu.be/TMj7bgCzsAA">this YouTube recording</a>, where the cut is evident shortly after the two-hour mark.</p>
      <p>Despite the slowly mounting evidence pointing toward a new Tony Hawk game, it goes without saying that nothing is certain until Activision makes it official. The last big razzmatazz opportunity to do so in 2019 would likely be during December's Video Game Awards, but there's no reason to believe that any such announcement is planned for this year.</p>
      <p>Of course, Activision has had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-08-04-a-spyro-remaster-could-be-closer-than-you-think">huge success</a> in recent times with its various nostalgia-tweaking Spyro the Dragon and Crash Bandicoot remakes. As such, it wouldn't be a huge surprise to learn the company is officially dusting off Tony Hawk Pro Skater, another of its fondly remembered properties, for a long-awaited revival.</p>
