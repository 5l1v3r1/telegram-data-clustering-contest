      <p>The end of Week 12leaves only a month and a week left in the 2019 NFL regular season. Once again, now heading into Week 13, there has been a reshuffling of the league's best teams.</p>
      <p>Three playoff-bound teams got big wins against other contendersSunday to create changes at the top, but there also was a shake-up in the middle and bottom, with some surging teams falling and some underachieving teams finally playing up their potential.</p>

      </p>
      <p>From the new No. 1 all the way down to the same No. 32, here are our NFL power rankings going into Week 13 of the 2019 season.</p>
      <h3>NFL power rankings</h3>
      <p>
        <b>1. San Francisco 49ers, 10-1 (previous ranking: 3)</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 49ers finally got their Sunday night showcase for their breakout season and unleashed all their strengths, including a nasty pass defense, a powerful running game and big plays in the passing game. Kyle Shanahan is your coach of the year, and John Lynch should also be the executive of the year.</p>
      <p>
        <b>2. Baltimore Ravens, 9-2 (1)</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Ravens came out of Monday night making heir lateststatement in Los Angeles against the Rams. Lamar Jackson is your MVP, and the defensive improvement throughout the season also has been impressive. Baltimore has looked great in every facet since beating up New England. Now it gets San Francisco at home to prove without a doubt it should be the unquested Super Bowl favorite.</p>
      <p>
        <b>3. New England Patriots, 10-1 (2)</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Patriots are starting to win games the way they won the Super Bowl over the Rams. They frustrated the Eagles and Cowboys in back-to-back weeks with their clutch situational defense. Tom Brady has gone back to grinding mode and seems to be loving it more with the power running game being restored.</p>
      <p>
        <b>4. Seattle Seahawks, 9-2 (5)</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Seahawks wereslopping in their post-bye road trip to Philadelphia, but what their offense couldn't do as usual didn't matter with the defense playing so well without Jadeveon Clowney. This team isn't all about Russell Wilson anymore; Seattle has gradually become more complete.</p>
      <p>
        <b>5. New Orleans Saints, 9-2 (4)</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Saints got a scare all the way through the end at home against the Panthers. Their pass defensemissed the coverage of Marshon Lattimore, but they found other ways to win with their offense and special teams. New Orleans remains a complete Super Bowl contender.</p>

        <figcaption>Aaron Rodgers</figcaption>

      <p>
        <b>6. Green Bay Packers, 8-3 (6)</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Packers got smashed in San Francisco, but they don't drop because they are still in control of the tough NFC North with a stellar record. They'll get rolling again here with Aaron Rodgers and the defense againstthe Giants and Redskins back-to-back.</p>
      <p>
        <b>7. Minnesota Vikings, 8-3 (7)</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Vikings enjoyed their bye with the Packers falling into a virtual tie with them. Now they have to keep up their strong offensive play around red-hot Kirk Cousins right awaywith Russell Wilson and the Seahawks next on the schedule.</p>
      <p>
        <b>8. Houston Texans, 7-4 (10)</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Texans got Deshaun Watson and DeAndre Hopkins revved up again as a dynamic duo, with a big assist of Will Fuller returning to make plays. There's still plenty of work to do to ensure another AFC South title or at least a wild-card berth with the Patriots next and both the Colts and Titans still on their heels.</p>
      <p>
        <b>9. Kansas City Chiefs, 7-4 (8)</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Chiefs needed a bye to regroup for a tough stretch run with the division and at least a wild-card berth on the line with the Raiders and Patriots as their next two opponents. Patrick Mahomes should be back at 100 percent, and so will Tyreek Hill.</p>
      <p>
        <b>10. Buffalo Bills, 8-3 (14)</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Bills turned in another dominant performance against an overmatched opponent, trading the Dolphins for the Broncos. Now they'll see if they can feast again to get a transcendent statement victory over the Cowboys — who have yet to beat a winning team — on the road on Thanksgiving.</p>

      <p>
        <b>11. Dallas Cowboys, 6-5 (9)</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Cowboys had plenty of opportunities to take down the Patriots, but the offense, defense and special teams let them down a few more times in another big game. No wonder Jerry Jones is frustrated. He knows the talent is there to beat other good teams, but situationally in big moments, the execution, for one reason or another, isn't.</p>
      <p>
        <b>12. Los Angeles Rams, 6-5 (13)</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Rams are doing their best to hide a struggling Jared Goff bymaking Todd Gurley and their running game the centerpiece of the offense again. Despite that mess against the Ravens, theyare good enough defensively to win a lot more with that formula down the stretch.</p>
      <p>
        <b>13. Pittsburgh Steelers, 6-5 (16)</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Steelers went into the offensive tank without James Conner and JuJu Smith-Schuster against the Bengals, but with Mason Rudolph benched in the nick of time, they found what they needed with Devlin Hodges, James Washington and Benny Snell. They're also trying to do the "defense and running game" thing to do make the playoffs.</p>
      <p>
        <b>14. Oakland Raiders, 6-5 (11)</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Raiders did what everyone expected them to do just when things were looking great — get sucked into a Black Hole of ineffectiveness on the road. The offense and defense stunk against the Jets, and it mightcompletely derail a playoff run with theChiefs next on the schedule.</p>
      <p>
        <b>15. Indianapolis Colts, 6-5 (12)</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Colts are getting a little too conservative offensively, which doesn't work when their defensive is giving up big plays. Jacoby Brissett is playing fine, but they're living and dying by the close, lower-scoring games and falling more off the precipice this season, a bit of a sophomore slump for Frank Reich.</p>

      <p>
        <b>16. Tennessee Titans, 6-5 (18)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Don't look now, but the Titans look impressive and explosive all-around. They're a completely differentteam with Ryan Tannehill starting over Marcus Mariota. They've opened up everything in the offense, and it has helped Derrick Henry return to dominance. They could easily make a late playoff surge now, as they are built for late November and December.</p>
      <p>
        <b>17. Cleveland Browns, 5-6 (19)</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Browns now have three consecutive wins and get the rematch against the Steelers in Pittsburgh, this time without Myles Garrett (suspension) and likely Rudolph (benching), too. We're seeing what their offense should really look like with Baker Mayfield binding Odell Beckham Jr., Jarvis Landry, Nick Chubb and Kareem Hunt. Credit the defense for rallying without Garrett, too.</p>
      <p>
        <b>18. Philadelphia Eagles, 5-6 (15)</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Eagles can'tmuster anything impactful offensively with their skill players and offensive line taking big injury hits around Carson Wentz. They need toride their — wait for it — defense and running gameto an NFC East title with afavorable schedule ahead, save for the Cowboys in Week 16.</p>
      <p>
        <b>19. Carolina Panthers, 5-6 (17)</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Panthers found their offensive groove again with Kyle Allen locked into his receivers downfield, led by breakout second-year man D.J. Moore, to complement Christian McCaffrey. But their run defense and pass protection were again big bugaboos against the Saints at the worst times in a would-be win. It's on Ron Rivera to get them to finish strong, and the Redskins and Falcons back-to-back can get them back above. 500.</p>
      <p>
        <b>20. Chicago Bears, 5-6 (20)</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Bears gotbetter play from Mitchell Trubisky despite his two bad interceptions against the Giants. When the arm talent and legs manifest at their best, he looks like a legitimate NFL quarterback. But what Chicago needs is more consistency, or it will be stuck trying to take low-scoring games.</p>

        <figcaption>Sam Darnold</figcaption>

      <p>
        <b>21. New York Jets, 4-7 (28)</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Jets have unleashed the offense they expected to field with Adam Gase all season: explosive and balanced with Sam Darnold and Le'Veon Bell. The real breakthrough story is the defense and how it has dominated the run and come up with creative ways to get to the passer under Gregg Williams.</p>
      <p>
        <b>22. Tampa Bay Buccaneers, 4-7 (26)</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Bucs saw some more Jameis Winston turnovers in Atlanta, but they were far outweighed by the many big plays he made with wide receiver Chris Godwin in helping his team take full control of a game late. When they can get rolling like that offensively and have their defensive front tee off, it masks the major issues in the secondary.</p>
      <p>
        <b>23. Jacksonville Jaguars, 4-7 (21)</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Jaguars are lost defensively, as they can no longer stop the run and are starting to give up huge plays downfield in the passing game. Offensively, Leonard Fournette is nice bread and butter to have, but they have lost much of their dynamism without Gardner Minshew.</p>
      <p>
        <b>24. Los Angeles Chargers, 4-7 (22)</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Chargers had a bye to shake off all those Philip Rivers interceptions and refocus on winning out. They have two games they should win back-to-back right away against the Broncos and Jaguars, but then it gets much harder with the Vikings, Raiders and Chiefs.</p>
      <p>
        <b>25. Arizona Cardinals, 3-7-1 (27)</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Cardinals moved up a little during the bye because some teams in their atmosphere fell hard in upset losses. Kyler Murray will try to continue his rookie-season momentum to try to steal Offensive Rookie of the Year from the Raiders' Josh Jacobs.</p>

        <figcaption>Matt Patricia</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        <b>26. Detroit Lions, 3-7-1 (23)</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Lions can think about what could have been the past three weeks had Matthew Stafford been able to continue his career-best play, but as they've found something with their defense and running game, they've been let down by Jeff Driskel'splay. Will that be enough to give Matt Patricia a free pass in Year 2?</p>
      <p>
        <b>27. Atlanta Falcons, 3-8 (24)</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Falcons threw all their defensive mojo out the window against the Bucs after dispatching two other NFC South foes. Just when you thought Dan Quinn might be safe, that home disaster happened. They have three more division games with which to save face, surrounding an ugly spot against a 49ers team coached by their former offensive coordinator.</p>
      <p>
        <b>28. Denver Broncos, 3-8 (25)</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Broncos need to give Drew Lock a shot,because it has gotten to the point of overwhelming for Brandon Allen. There's nothing left to lose this season, but there's plenty of knowledge to be gained about how they should proceed at quarterback in 2020.</p>
      <p>
        <b>29. New York Giants, 2-9 (29)</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Giants saw Daniel Jones hang in there through a toughdefensive matchup, reminding them he has the physical and mental toughness to be fine in New York for a long time. Now we'll have to see if the other offensive issues will cost Pat Shurmur his job.</p>
      <p>
        <b>30. Washington Redskins, 2-9 (31)</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Redskins probably would like rookie Dwayne Haskins to be more about pocket awareness than selfie awareness, but after a rough rookie season in which everything has been a struggle, Sunday's win was a relief. They no longer need to worry about being the worst team in the NFL.</p>

      <p>
        <b>31. Miami Dolphins, 2-9 (30)</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Dolphins have gone back to losing with atrocious, depleted defense, but they have found some respectability with Ryan Fitzpatrick always willing to fight to the end, mirroring the attitude of their keeper coach, Brian Flores. It's now more about "buying the groceries" a lot betterin 2020.</p>
      <p>
        <b>32. Cincinnati Bengals, 0-11 (32)</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Bengals did their best to stun the Steelers with some more life from the key playmakers around rookie Ryan Finley, namely Tyler Boyd. But their bungling run defense and big-play yielding pass defense reared their ugly heads at the wrong times. It's now looking like Week 16 against the Dolphins will decide whether they crack their goose egg.</p>
