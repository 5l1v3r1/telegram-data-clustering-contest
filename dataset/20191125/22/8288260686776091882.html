      <h1>'So easy' - Aston Villa fans have their say after comfortable win over Newcastle United</h1>
      <h2>Aston Villa 2-0 Newcastle | First half goals from Hourihane and El Ghazi earned AVFC a comfortable win over the sorry Magpies</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T22:41:09+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 22:41</time> by <a rel="author">Ben Husband, https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/authors/ben-husband/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa</a> ended their three-match losing run with a resounding 2-0 win over Newcastle United at Villa Park.</p>
      <p>The home side dominated the Magpies and could have scored countless more, but had to settle for two, first half strikes.</p>
      <p>Conor Hourihane, who was recalled by Dean Smith, opened the scoring with a clever free-kick. Before the Irishman created the second, this time, his set piece was turned home by Anwar El Ghazi.</p>

      <p>Newcastle had chances either side of half time, but after Heaton stood strong, they were able to cruise towards their fourth Premier League win of the season.</p>
      <p>Delighted fans belted out 'Sweet Caroline' at full time and supporters on social media were similarly as jubilant:</p>
      <p><b>@Afranklin_AVFC:</b> Thought we were superb tonight. Grealish deservedly MOTM. Thought that collectively we bounced back excellently from the no-show v Wolves and bossed the game tonight. A real professional and quality performance. Get in boys!</p>
      <p><b>@Frankbad_AVFC:</b> The couldn't get near Jack tonight, what a performance, slowed down play, sped it up.. he knows when to increase the tempo.. our midfield bossed that with ease! A great win villa boys</p>
      <p><b>@shak96utv:</b> That’s why @JackGrealish1 is so important for us. Special mention for @ConorHourihane keep proving the doubters wrong</p>
      <p><b>@mansell_james:</b> Great performance and result that, so nice to see us close a game out with ease for once. Up the villa!!!</p>

      <p><b>@TheRealPaulB:</b> Buzzing. Most complete performance for me. Thought Mings had an iffy first half, Konsa bailed him a couple of times. McGinn was below par. Jack ran it, Conor won it. Wes worked hard. Beer time</p>
      <p><b>@avfchistory:</b> Just home from the game. Great performance tonight. Great to have Jack back, he makes such a difference, Hourihane shows he is a must start now, goal and assist tonight was class. Guilbert also dominated his man in a crucial battle. All in all a great night at Villa Park</p>
      <p><b>@lee_harrison:</b> don't think we expected it to be so easy, great team performance. Jack pulled the strings, Luiz bossed the middle.</p>
      <p><b>@QN1981:</b> Pleased with the win &amp; clean sheet.. added bonus it’s over Steve Bruce and Newcastle!</p>
