      <h1>Amazon Prime members can get a special purple monkey in Sea of Thieves</h1>

        <b>Pirates of the seven seas were given the ability to buy pet monkeys and parrots in the Pirate Emporium update for Sea of Thieves back in September, and now you can have an animal sidekick for the low, low price of an Amazon Prime membership.</b>
      </p>
      <p>If you’re already an Amazon Prime subscriber, all you’ve to do is make sure you’re signed up for Twitch Prime (included in the price of Amazon Prime), and link your account to Sea of Thieves at <a href="https://twitch.amazon.com/prime/loot/seaofthieves">this link</a>. A lovely, cute little purple monkey pal will be waiting for you in-game at any of your pet chests. Some other treats include a Celestial Steed Ship Livery Set with purple and pink sails, a figurehead that looks like a unicorn, and a paint job for your hull. You’ll get a few emotes and a Twitch theme, too.</p>
      <p>The items can take up to 72 hours to spawn, so don’t worry if your Amethyst Soul Capuchin isn’t there as soon as you register. The offer is open until January 21, 2020, and once you’ve acquired the items they’re yours regardless of what happens to your Amazon Prime subscription.</p>
      <p>Prime offers a 30-day free trial, which means you can sign up for the free month to get the goodies and then let the membership lapse. Given that Amazon Prime currently costs $13/£8 per month, or $120/£79 per year, it’s a pricey commitment otherwise, granted you do get all the regular perks of Amazon Prime.</p>
      <p>Rare granted players the power to <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/sea-of-thieves/underwear">change the colour of their underwear</a> in Sea of Thieves with the October update, and the developers have said <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/best-pirate-games-pc">private servers are on the agenda for an upcoming update</a>.</p>
      <p>Sea of Thieves is among our <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/best-pirate-games-pc">best pirate games</a>, along with a slew of others, if you’ve been thinking of taking the high seas in search of hidden treasure.</p>
