      <h1>Result: Villa defeat Newcastle to end losing run</h1>
      <h2>Newcastle manager <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/steve-bruce/"><b>Steve Bruce</b></a>’s maiden return to former club <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/aston-villa/"><b>Aston Villa</b></a> ended in a wretched 2-0 Premier League defeat.</h2>

      <p>Goals from <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/conor-hourihane/"><b>Conor Hourihane</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/anwar-el-ghazi/"><b>Anwar El Ghazi</b></a> in the space of four first-half minutes eased Villa’s recent woes after a run of three straight defeats had plunged <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/dean-smith/"><b>Dean Smith</b></a>’s side to one place above the relegation zone.</p>
      <p>Inspired by returning captain <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jack-grealish/"><b>Jack Grealish</b></a> after a month-long absence with a calf injury, Villa ensured it was an unhappy visit back to Villa Park for Bruce, who was sacked in October last year after two years in charge.</p>
      <p>Grealish, sidelined for the 2-1 defeats at home to Liverpool and at Wolves, again provided the spark Villa had been missing in those games.</p>

      <p>In fairness, little had been created by either side in the opening half-hour, with El Ghazi a yard shy of a toe poke onto a piercing low ball into the six-yard box from <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/matt-targett/"><b>Matt Targett</b></a>, while <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/martin-dubravka/"><b>Martin Dubravka</b></a> produced a stunning fingertip save to deny <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/douglas-luiz/"><b>Douglas Luiz</b></a>’s fizzing 22-yard right-foot curler.</p>
      <p>Left-back Targett was the victim of a bizarre 20th-minute incident when he vomited on the pitch just after he had taken a throw-in – but after treatment and water the £15.6million summer signing from Southampton was able to continue.</p>
      <p>Although Villa were always the more threatening side, with the Magpies primarily reliant on the counter-attack, it required two set-piece situations to prise open the visitors.</p>

      <p>The first arrived in the 32nd minute as Grealish raced onto a raking through ball, only for the attacking midfielder to be blatantly pushed in the back by the covering <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/deandre-yedlin/"><b>DeAndre Yedlin</b></a> a yard outside the area.</p>
      <p>It was prime territory for Hourihane, whose first touch was a tap pass to Grealish who in turn stopped the ball dead. The Republic of Ireland international sumptuously whipped around the wall, and the poorly-positioned Dubravka, for his fifth goal of the season.</p>
      <p>Four minutes later Villa doubled their lead, with Grealish again drawing a foul, although it appeared as if he had deliberately caught the outstretched leg of <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/federico-fernandez/"><b>Federico Fernandez</b></a>.</p>
      <p>On this occasion, Hourihane curled a piercing low ball into the six-yard box, and with Newcastle’s defence leaden-footed, El Ghazi easily stabbed home his fourth goal of the season from three yards.</p>

      <p>It prompted cries from the Villa fans of ‘Brucey, Brucey what’s the score?’ as the home faithful teased their former boss.</p>
      <p>Villa, though, were then indebted to <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/tom-heaton/"><b>Tom Heaton</b></a> for preserving their two-goal cushion just before and after the break. First he pushed away a downward header from Fernandez, before tipping beyond the post a corner-of-the-net-bound 20-yard strike from <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/allan-saint-maximin/"><b>Allan Saint-Maximin</b></a>.</p>
      <p>Dubravka responded in the 53rd minute with a brilliant save of his own as his defence again went missing, pushing away a six-yard header from an unmarked <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/ezri-konsa/"><b>Ezri Konsa</b></a> onto an inswinging Grealish corner.</p>
      <p>In the 77th minute, Dubravka again denied Villa a third, saving from Wesley at point-blank range after another low ball had been played into the six-yard box, this time from Targett.</p>
      <p>Despite Bruce playing all three substitutes, including strikers <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/andy-carroll/"><b>Andy Carroll</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/dwight-gayle/"><b>Dwight Gayle</b></a>, his side were unable to find a way back into the game.</p>
