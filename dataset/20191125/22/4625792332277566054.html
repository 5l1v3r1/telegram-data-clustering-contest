      <h1>Journalist temporarily suspended on Twitter for response to Chelsea Clinton about transgender violence</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T22:19:44+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 22:19</time> by <a rel="author">Mike Brest</a></address>
      <p>Journalist Andy Ngo said he was temporarily suspended from Twitter for his contributions to a conversation pertaining to violence against transgender people.</p>
      <p>Last week, the Human Rights Campaign honored Transgender Day of Remembrance on Twitter. Chelsea Clinton quote tweeted the HRC and commented, "Since 2013, more than 150 trans people have been murdered in the U.S., the majority Black transgender women. On #TDoR2019, we remember and honor the lives lost, hold their loved ones in our hearts and must commit to doing all we can to end this epidemic of violence and hate."</p>
      <p>Ngo, who is currently an editor at <i>The Post Millennial</i>, responded to Clinton by tweeting, “The US is one of the safest countries for trans people. The murder rate of trans victims is actually lower than that for cis population. Also, who is behind the murders? Mostly black men.”</p>

      <p>Twitter ruled that Ngo's tweet violated its rules on "hateful conduct" policy, which says a user "may not promote violence against, threaten, or harass other people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or serious disease."</p>
      <p>As a result of the infraction, Ngo was barred from tweeting, retweeting, following other users, or liking other tweets for 12 hours. His account appears to have been restored, and he has since <a href="https://twitter.com/MrAndyNgo/status/1197269938647355392">tweeted</a> similar responses to Clinton.</p>
      <p>Ngo told <i><a href="https://www.thepostmillennial.com/breaking-twitter-suspends-journalist-andy-ngo/">The Post Millennial</a></i>, “Stating a verifiable empirical claim with no value [judgment] attached is determined to be ‘hateful conduct’ by Twitter. The platform most used by journalists to communicate and counter ‘fake news’ also actively punishes individuals for communicating truths when they are deemed politically inconvenient.”</p>
      <p>He has gained notoriety in recent months for covering antifa and right-wing confrontations in Portland, Oregon. The culmination for Ngo came when he was <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/journalist-attacked-by-antifa-speaks-out-this-was-the-anarchy-of-portland">assaulted while covering a rally</a> at the end of June, after which he was hospitalized with a head injury.</p>
