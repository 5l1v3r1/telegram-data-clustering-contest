      <h1>This GeForce RTX 2070 Super is on sale for $490 after rebate</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T22:41:20+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 22:41</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/author/tyler-wilde/" target="_blank">Tyler Wilde</a></address>
      <p>GeForce RTX 2070 Super graphics cards usually go for between $500 and $600, but for <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/black-friday-pc-gaming-deals-2019/">Black Friday</a>, Newegg's got an overclocked Gigabyte RTX 2070 Super <a href="https://www.newegg.com/gigabyte-geforce-rtx-2070-super-gv-n207sgaming-oc-8gd/p/N82E16814932212?Item=N82E16814932212">on sale for $490</a> when you use the promo code BLACKFR34 and redeem a $20 rebate card. </p>
      <p>It's a decent deal on a card that will serve you well for several years. The RTX 2070 Super <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-2070-super-review/">comes close</a> to the performance of an RTX 2080, and <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-2070-super-review/">using a reference card</a> clocked at 1770Mhz (a little lower than the card Newegg is selling), we managed an average FPS of 95.8 in Forza Horizon 4 at 1440p with Ultra settings.</p>
      <p>If you're thinking ahead to next year's games like Cyberpunk 2077 or Half-Life: Alyx, this card will do the job. If you want even more power, though, the same deal is also available on Newegg for an RTX 2080 Super, which is <a href="https://www.newegg.com/evga-geforce-rtx-2080-super-08g-p4-3182-kr/p/N82E16814487464">on sale for $690 after rebate</a>. That's the lowest price we've seen for that particular card.</p>
      <p>Over on Amazon, the same <a href="https://www.amazon.com/GIGABYTE-Graphics-Windforce-GV-N207SGAMING-OC-8GD/dp/B07WN6WB4G/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=Gigabyte+GeForce+RTX+2070+Super&amp;qid=1574719090&amp;sr=8-2">Gigabyte RTX 2070 Super is $520</a>, which is $30 off the price it was at the start of the month, but isn't as notable without the $20 rebate Newegg is offering. Keep an eye on these cards throughout Black Friday and Cyber Monday in case any bigger deals pop up—we'll be collecting the <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/black-friday-graphics-card-deals-2019/">best Black Friday graphics card deals here</a>—but I'm doubtful they'll get <i>huge</i> discounts given that they launched this year.</p>
      <p>The non-Super version of the RTX 2070, however, is technically discontinued. Because of that, you're likely to see some bigger discounts. Newegg's <a href="https://www.newegg.com/msi-geforce-rtx-2070-rtx-2070-gaming-8g/p/N82E16814137377?Description=rtx%202070&amp;cm_re=rtx_2070-_-14-137-377-_-Product">got one for $455</a> after $15 rebate, for example. Just don't pay more than that for one given that the Super version will probably dip below the $500 line a few more times as the week of deals continues.</p>
