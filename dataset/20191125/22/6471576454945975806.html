      <p>All jokes aside, the stunning Khalilah superyacht is switching hands, with the current owner asking for the equivalent of $31 million for it. For this kind of money, you get the first-ever all-carbon yacht ever built, finished in custom gold, fully equipped with toys, and spacious and luxurious interiors by Palmer Johnson (whose team also built it).</p>
      <p>Khalilah was built in 2014 and unveiled one year later, and has been making headlines ever since. The 160-foot cruiser isn‚Äôt just light, but also comes with revolutionary, wave-penetrating hull that ensures high speeds and stability with optimal fuel consumption. Khalilah is equipped with twin 16V MTU diesel M94 engines and can reach speeds of 26 knots, boasting a transatlantic range when cruising at 15 knots. It was designed for high performance and it delivers on the original promise.</p>
      <p>Khalilah can accommodate 11 guests in 5 vast staterooms and a 9-person crew, and includes stunning amenities like an alfresco dining area, floor-to-ceiling windows for breathtaking vistas at sea, a skylounge, a sunken spa pool on a sheltered terrace, high-tech entertainment systems and contemporary LED light installations. All interiors are finished in bleached birch wood paneling with Asian elements, breathing an air of ultra-luxury and sophistication.</p>
      <p>The current owner is selling the superyacht with a matching 20-foot tender (also finished in custom Cordova Gold) and an impressive array of toys, including hoverboard, jet skis and a jet pack, wakeboard, paddle boards, kayaks and inflatables.</p>
      <p>The superyacht is listed exclusively with <a href="https://www.superyachtsmonaco.com/sales/khalilah-sale">Superyachts Monaco</a> and is in excellent condition. üèÅ</p>
