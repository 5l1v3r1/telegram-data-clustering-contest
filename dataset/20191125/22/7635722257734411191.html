        <b>Ireland's Conor Hourihane scored an excellent opener for Aston Villa as they beat Newcastle United 2-0 in Monday night's Premier League encounter.</b>
      </p>
      <p>On a good night for the 28-year-old, he also set up the second goal of the night.</p>
      <p>The Birmingham club took the lead on 32 minutes through the Cork-born midfielder.</p>
      <h3>Harbinger of Joy?</h3>
      <p>Villa captained Jack Grealish teed him up at the edge of the Newcastle box and Hourihane curled an excellent free-kick into the back of the net inside Martin Dubravka's near post.</p>

      <p>Ireland fans will hope it's a harbinger of joy for March's Euro 2020 playoff against Slovakia. That's given the fact that Dubravka is also the central European nation's nominal starting goalkeeper.</p>
      <p>Villa didn't have long to wait for their second. Four minutes after Hourihane's opener, Anwar El Ghazi turned in an excellent free-in from the Ireland midfielder.</p>
      <p>They held on to that 2-0 advantage and the win lifts Villa up to 15th in the table, four points above 18th place Norwich. They also climb above out-of-form Everton and West Ham. However, Newcastle remain one point and also one place above Villa in the Premier League table.</p>
