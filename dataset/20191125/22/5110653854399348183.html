      <h1>When is Super Bowl 2020? Date, location, odds, halftime show for Super Bowl 54</h1>

      <p>Though the date and location for the Super Bowl changes every year, the borderline unhealthy fixation on America's biggest professional sporting event is a constant. In 2020, when the NFL's 100th season ends with Super Bowl 54, that domestic and global attention will turn to Miami.</p>
      <p>The Super Bowl in 2020, the game that will crown an NFL champion for the 2019season, is scheduled to take place Sunday, Feb. 2 at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Fla. That stadium, of course, is home to the Miami Dolphins, one of the few NFL teams we can guarantee will not be playing in the Super Bowl in 2020.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The latest Super Bowl odds suggest at least one familiar contender will reach the big game in 2020. According to <a href="https://www.sportsbookreview.com/betting-odds/nfl-football/?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=sportingnews.com&amp;utm_campaign=sporting%20news&amp;utm_content=top%20bar&amp;utm_term=nfl%20odds">Sportsbook Review</a>, the defending-champion Patriots remain the favorites to make and win the Super Bowl. The team they beat in last year's Super Bowl, the Rams, had fallen to No. 9 on the list of favorites at the midpoint of the regular season.</p>
      <p>Other favorites to reach and win the Super Bowl in 2020 based on the odds are the Saints and Chiefs, theteams that lost in the NFC and AFC championship games, respectively, last season. Other top contenders this yearinclude the 49ers, Packers, Ravens, Cowboys, Eagles, Vikings and Seahawks.</p>
      <p>We won't know for a while what teams will play in the Super Bowl in 2020, but we do know one thing about Miami: It knows how to throw a party. So expect Super Bowl 54 and all the events that surround the big game to be nothing short of a spectacular show. That includes a very Miami-appropriate halftime performance.</p>
      <p>Below is everything you need to know about the Super Bowl in 2020, including the date, location, odds and halftime show info.</p>
      <h3>When is Super Bowl 2020?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Date</b>: Sunday, Feb. 2</li>
        <li><b>Kickoff time</b>: TBD</li>
        <li><b>TV channel</b>: Fox</li>
        <li><b>Live stream</b>: Fox Sports app | DAZN (in Canada)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Super Bowl 54, also known as Super Bowl LIV, is scheduled for Sunday, Feb. 2, 2020. The official kickoff time will be determined at a later date, but the ballpark of 6:30 p.m. ET has become the traditional start time for the Super Bowl.</p>
      <p>Every Super Bowl since 2003 has taken place during the first week of February. From 1967-2003, all but one Super Bowl took place in January.</p>
      <p>The Super Bowl in 2020 will mark the second time a Super Bowl has been played on Feb. 2. On the same date sixyears ago, the Seahawks dominated the Broncos in New York to win Super Bowl 48.</p>
      <p>Per usual, the Super Bowl in 2020 will take place one week after the Pro Bowl in Orlando, Fla., and two weeks after the AFC and NFC championship games. The next notable event on the <a href="https://operations.nfl.com/football-ops/league-governance/2019-20-important-nfl-dates/">NFL calendar</a> after the Super Bowl is the 2020 NFL Combine in Indianapolis.</p>
      <p>The 2020 NFL league year begins March 18, a little more than a month after the 2019 season concludes with Super Bowl 54 in Miami.</p>

      <h3>Where is Super Bowl 2020?</h3>
      <p>The Super Bowl in 2020 will be played in a city that's no stranger to America's biggest game. But the venue will be a fresh addition to Super Bowl history.</p>
      <p>Super Bowl 54 will be played at <a href="https://hardrockstadium.com/">Hard Rock Stadium</a> in Miami Gardens, Fla., a city located innorth-central Miami-Dade County roughly 15 miles up I-95from central Miami. The stadium, home to both the Miami Dolphins and the Miami Hurricanes, was selected as the host venue for the Super Bowl in 2020 in part because of its warm location, but also because of recent renovations.</p>

      <p>The NFL made South Florida the host of Super Bowl 54 back in 2016, when Miami competed against Atlanta, New Orleans, Tampa and Los Angeles to secure the big game and when Hard Rock Stadium's renovation project was completed.</p>
      <p>While the stadium’s seating capacity was reduced from 75,000 to 65,000, the renovationfeatured new video boards, suites and seating pods.</p>
      <p>“We were confident. It was definitely our most competitive bid ever,” said chairman of the Super Bowl host committee Rodney Barreto at the time. "A $450-million-plus enhancement to the Dolphins’ stadium. A budget of cash and incentives valued at more than $40 million. A warm weather destination that always delivers. Always.</p>
      <p>"We are truly thankful to Mr. Stephen Ross, owner of the Miami Dolphins, for all his support and assistance throughout this process."</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Added Miami-Dade County mayor CarlosGimenez: "I can’t think of a better place to host the Super Bowl than right here in our world-class community. Miami has hosted more Super Bowls than any other city, and it’s clear why. This is the place to live, work and play, and hosting the Super Bowl at Dolphins’ stadium once again serves as further evidence that Miami is a major event community.”</p>
      <p>Indeed, the Miami area already <a href="https://www.miasbliv.com/history/">has hosted 10 Super Bowls</a>, and its 11th will break a tie with New Orleans for the most in the country. (New Orleans, though, will create another tie when it hosts Super Bowl 58 in 2024.)</p>
      <p>Now called Hard Rock Stadium, the venue theDolphins call home originally was named Joe Robbie Stadium when it opened in 1987. It has been renamed seven times since and has hosted five Super Bowls, with the old Miami Orange Bowl having hosted South Florida’s other five Super Bowls.</p>
      <h3>Super Bowl 2020 odds</h3>
      <p>No team has ever played a Super Bowl in its own city. Based on the Super Bowl odds (and common sense), that won't happen in 2020. According to the latest Super Bowl odds at <a href="http://www.sportsbookreview.com/betting-odds/nfl-football/?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=sportingnews.com&amp;utm_campaign=sporting%20news&amp;utm_content=top%20bar&amp;utm_term=nfl%20odds">Sportsbook Review</a>, the Dolphins literally have the worstchances in the NFL to reach Super Bowl 54.</p>
      <p>Miami's division rival in New England has been the favorite to reach and win the Super Bowl in 2020 ever since it won last year's title. However, there has been some significant movement behind the Patriots throughout the 2019 regular season.</p>
      <p>The 49ers, for example, opened at +4500 to win the Super Bowl in 2020. That has dropped below +700 at most sportsbooks, as San Francisco was the last undefeated team remaining in the regular season. The 49ershave the third best odds to win the Super Bowl behind the Pats and Saints.</p>
      <p>The opposite can be said of the defending NFC champion Rams, who opened at +1000 to win the Super Bowl in 2020 but have slipped during the regular season, resulting in odds closer to +2000 or higher.</p>
      <p>Below are the odds to win Super Bowl 54 for all 32 NFL teams,via <a href="https://www.sportsbookreview.com/betting-odds/nfl-football/?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=sportingnews.com&amp;utm_campaign=sporting%20news&amp;utm_content=top%20bar&amp;utm_term=nfl%20odds">Sportsbook Review</a> as of early November 2019:</p>

      <h3>Future Super Bowl locations, host sites</h3>
      <p>When the NFL considers sites for future Super Bowl locations, many <a href="http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1184220-20140605190910.html#document/p36">requirements</a> must be met by potential cities, their venues and their accommodations. Stadium quality is among the priorities, which is why several of <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/future-super-bowl-locations-sites-cities-stadiums-hosts/caixretvamxc113i2gmt8f18v">the next five Super Bowls</a> will be played in new or recently renovated stadiums.</p>
      <p>That’s why Minnesota was awarded Super Bowl 52 back in 2018, after all; same for Super Bowl 53 in Atlanta, Super Bowl 54 in Miami and Super Bowl 56 in Los Angeles. Weather is also being a factor when the NFL considers future Super Bowl locations.</p>
      <p>That will be the case again in 2020, when the Super Bowl will be played in a recently renovated stadium and in warm weather. Beloware the sites the NFL has pinned as future Super Bowl locations.</p>
