      <p><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6386/eaaq1392">In April of 2018</a>, a team of scientists made an imaging breakthrough that allowed them to capture this incredible video of an immune cell moving through the tissues of a zebra fish’s inner ear, picking up sugar particles as it goes along.</p>
      <p>The video resurfaced today when it exploded in popularity <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/e1f81w/firstever_hd_footage_of_a_cell_moving_through_the/">on the r/videos subreddit</a>, where it’s received some 10k upvotes over the past ten hours. And not without reason: the fact that this kind of footage exists is genuinely mind-blowing.</p>
      <p>This breakthrough in microscopic imaging was made by a team of researchers led by Physicist Tsung-Li Liu, who combined two different imaging techniques into a hybrid that allows them to “study a variety of delicate subcellular events in vivo.” In other words: they can capture highly detailed 3-D images of living cells moving through living tissue.</p>
      <p>The example above shows an immune cell buzzing around a zebrafish inner ear, but they were able to capture many more examples of subcellular activity, like neural circuits developing in a zebrafish spinal chord and a cancer cell migrating through a blood vessel:</p>

      <p>The technique they developed is described in technical detail <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6386/eaaq1392">in the journal <i>Science</i></a>, but in summary, the researchers developed a new kind of microscope by combining <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_light-sheet_microscopy">lattice light-sheet microscopy</a> (LLSM) with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_optics">adaptive optics</a> (AO) to create a system that can capture 3D ‘movies’ of specific structures <i>in vivo</i> at an unprecedented level of detail.</p>
      <p>The lattice light-sheet microscope “rapidly and repeatedly sweeps an ultrathin sheet of light” through the subject—collecting imaging data and building a 3D movie—while the adaptive optics system “measures sample-induced distortions […] and compensates for these by changing the shape of a mirror to create an equal but opposite distortion.”</p>
      <p>That allows the scientists to go from an image that is, a researcher Eric Betzig <a href="https://www.hhmi.org/news/new-microscope-captures-detailed-3-d-movies-cells-deep-within-living-systems">told HHMI</a>, “too damn fuzzy” to a high-resolution 3D time-lapse that captures the activity as it’s happening. The immune cell video, for example, is made up of 90-minutes worth of images taken every 13 seconds.</p>

      <p>This first iteration of the microscope was, unfortunately, massive. <a href="https://www.hhmi.org/news/new-microscope-captures-detailed-3-d-movies-cells-deep-within-living-systems">According to HHMI</a>, it takes up about a 10-foot-long table. But it was a proof of concept that researchers were already working on shrinking down back in 2018.</p>
      <p>As this technique and technology advances (and shrinks) we’ll begin to see many more amazing videos like the ones above: bona fide peeks into the inner workings of living cells.</p>
