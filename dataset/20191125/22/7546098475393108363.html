      <h1>Why the Qantas share price just hit a new record high</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T22:39:15+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 22:39</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fool.com.au/author/kennethhallau/" target="_blank">Kenneth Hall</a></address>
      <p>The <b>Qantas Airways Ltd </b><a href="https://www.fool.com.au/tickers/ASX-QAN/">(ASX: QAN)</a> share price climbed 1.96% higher to $7.28 per share yesterday – a new record high for Qantas on the ASX. The company’s shares have surged 26.39% higher in 2019.</p>
      <p>But what’s driving the Aussie airline’s shares higher, and is November the best time to buy?</p>
      <h3>Why Qantas just hit a new record high</h3>
      <p>The Qantas share price climbed higher on Monday as Aussie equities generally performed well.</p>
      <p>The <b>S&amp;P/ASX 200 Index </b><a href="https://www.fool.com.au/latest-asx-200-chart-price-news/">(INDEXASX: XJO)</a> added 21.60 points (0.32%) to close at 6,731.40 points yesterday.</p>
      <p>There were no announcements or news from Qantas in yesterday’s trade but there could be some momentum behind the stock.</p>
      <p>The Qantas share price pushed higher on Friday after <a href="https://www.fool.com.au/2019/11/22/qantas-share-price-on-watch-after-accc-approval/">gaining ACCC approval for its deal with <b>BP</b></a>.</p>
      <p>The regulator will grant a 5-year authorisation, which will allow BP to require BP-branded petrol stations to be a part of the Qantas rewards programs.</p>
      <p>Cost savings and public benefits were cited as key factors behind the decision. The ACCC doesn’t believe it will result in materially lower competition in the market.</p>
      <p>Qantas has gone from strength to strength in recent weeks and <a href="https://www.fool.com.au/2019/11/12/why-is-the-qantas-share-price-hitting-new-all-time-highs/">hit another record high last Wednesday</a>.</p>
      <p>The company’s shares have surged higher in November after unveiling its plans to be net carbon neutral by 2050. Qantas will double the number of flights being carbon offset with a cap on net emissions starting next year.</p>
      <h3>Is November the time to buy?</h3>
      <p>Qantas shares clearly have momentum behind them at the moment following the stock’s recent record highs.</p>
      <p>However, that may be a double-edged sword, as shares could be overvalued at $7.28 per share.</p>
      <p>That being said, if you’re looking for an airline to add to your portfolio in 2019, I think Qantas looks like better value than <b>Virgin Australia Holdings Ltd </b><a href="https://www.fool.com.au/tickers/ASX-VAH/">(ASX: VAH)</a> or <b>Air New Zealand Ltd </b><a href="https://www.fool.com.au/tickers/ASX-AIZ/">(ASX: AIZ)</a>.</p>
      <p>Both airline rivals have seen their share prices fall lower in 2019 as higher fuel prices and weaker earnings have had a significant impact.</p>
