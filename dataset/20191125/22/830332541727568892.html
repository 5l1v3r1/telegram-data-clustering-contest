      <h1>Mississippi just began selling its first-ever state lottery tickets</h1>
      <h2>Proceeds go to education, infrastructure</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T22:25:47+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 22:25</time> by <a rel="author">Lauren M. Johnson, CNN</a></address>
      <p>(CNN) - For the first time, Mississippi residents can now play their own state lottery.</p>
      <p>Instead of going to Louisiana, Tennessee or Arkansas, residents can purchase lottery tickets right in their own backyard. Tickets went on sale at 5 a.m. Monday after lawmakers passed a bill last year authorizing a state lottery.</p>
      <p>State Rep. Alyce G. Clarke, a lottery advocate for <a href="http://billstatus.ls.state.ms.us/documents/20181E/pdf/SB/2001-2099/SB2001SG.pdf">whom the bill is named</a>, made the first ceremonial purchase, the Mississippi Lottery Corporation said in a news release.</p>
      <p>"This is not only a monumental day for the MLC, but it is also an incredible day for Mississippi," said Dr. Mike McGrevey, chairman of the MLC Board.</p>
      <p>More than 1,200 approved retailers -- including convenience stores, grocery stores, casinos and even barber shops -- jumped on board to get their chance at selling a winning ticket. They all went through a screening process that took about 30 days.</p>
      <p>"Today would not have been possible without our retailers," said MLC President Tom Shaheen. "Some are so excited they are hosting their own giveaways and promotions."</p>
      <p>The bill was signed into law on September 1, 2018, and after more than a year of preparation, residents are ready to get scratching. Proceeds will go towards education and infrastructure across the state.</p>
      <p>While scratch-off tickets are now available, Powerball and Mega Millions tickets will not be sold until January 2020.</p>
      <p>Only five states remain without a lottery: Alabama, Nevada, Alaska, Hawaii, and Utah.</p>
