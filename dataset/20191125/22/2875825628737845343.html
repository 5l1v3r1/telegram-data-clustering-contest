      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/ayda-field">Ayda Field</a> has KOd her husband <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/robbie-williams">Robbie Williams</a> ’ plan to fight <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/liam-gallagher">Liam Gallagher</a> , telling him to grow up.</p>
      <p>Singer Robbie, 45, last week said he had approached boxing promoter <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/eddie-hearn">Eddie Hearn</a> to fix up a fight with Liam, 47.</p>
      <p>The rivalry dates to the mid-1990s when Liam’s brother Noel dubbed Robbie the “fat dancer from Take That”.</p>
      <p>In October, Robbie said he wanted to settle their differences once and for all.</p>
      <p>But Ayda said: “I think it is embarrassing.”</p>
      <p>She told Robbie: “I am going to knock the hate out of you so you may even send Liam a Christmas card.”</p>

      <p>Last week, Robbie said: “If there’s anybody that I want to box, it’s Liam Gallagher. Eddie Hearn’s up for it”.</p>
      <p>But on their new podcast, At Home With The Williamses, Ayda stormed: “You are 45, man. You are going to go in a ring and smack each other. It is lame.</p>
      <p>“You are not in your 20s. I am going to have to bring you back from the dead after this. I don’t understand it.”</p>
      <p>Robbie got the message. He said: “This is the festive season to all men, even Liam Gallagher. If you need me to smack anybody I am not gonna. I am now the spirit of Christmas too, like you.”</p>

      <p>The two musicians have a long running feud, and Williams wanted to settle his differences with the Oasis frontman in a KSI vs Logan Paul-style bout in the ring.</p>
      <p>Williams admitted back in October he hoped to battle it out with the Oasis frontman in a bout similar to that of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/boxing/breaking-ksi-beats-logan-paul-20852127">Youtube stars KSI and Logan Paul</a> .</p>
      <p>He told <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/culture/article/robbie-williams-liam-gallagher">GQ</a> at the time: "I’d love it. But I’d want it to be a professional fight. I’ve seen how much KSI and Logan Paul made from theirs and I think we could trounce that."</p>

      <p>He added: "But, yeah, I think last time in the noughties Liam wanted to go down to an abandoned railway track or something. I don’t want to do that. It’s got to be f****** whistles and bells if it happens."</p>
      <p>During a recent chat on the Jonathan Ross show, Robbie revealed that he made contact with Eddie Hearn over staging a bout with Gallagher.</p>
      <p>He claims that Hearn - who promoted the KSI vs Logan Paul fight - is up for it, although Gallagher is yet to reply.</p>
