      <p>And he told how tennis was often an "escape" which helped him deal with his trauma.</p>
      <p>The two-time Wimbledon champion left an emotional voice note for director Olivia Cappuccini as he lifted the lid on how he’s been impacted by the tragedy.</p>
      <p>He said: “You asked me a while ago why tennis was important to me.</p>
      <p>“Obviously I had the thing that happened at Dunblane. When I was around nine.”</p>
      <p>Murray told how the shooting came a year before the divorce of his parents, and his brother Jamie moving away from home.</p>
      <p>He said: “I am sure for all the kids there it would be difficult for different reasons.</p>
      <p>“The fact we knew the guy, we went to his kids club, he had been in our car, we had driven and dropped him off at train stations and things.</p>

      <p>“Within 12 months of that happening, our parents got divorced.</p>
      <p>“It was a difficult time that for kids. To see that and not quite understand what is going on.</p>
      <p>“And then six to 12 months after that, my brother also moved away from home. He went away to train to play tennis in Cambridge.</p>
      <p>“We obviously used to do everything together. When he moved away that was also quite hard for me.</p>
      <p>“Around that time and after that, for a year or so, I had lots of anxiety but that came out when I was playing tennis. When I was competing I would get really bad breathing problems.</p>
      <p>“My feeling towards tennis is that it’s an escape for me in some ways. Because all of these things are stuff that I have bottled up.</p>
      <p>“I don’t know because we don’t talk about these things. They are not things that are discussed.”</p>
      <p>The new documentary, entitled Andy Murray: Resurfacing, will focus on the tennis superstar’s gruelling recovery from a career-threatening injury.</p>
      <p>It will be released this Friday - and is being premiered at London's Curzon Bloomsbury's tonight.</p>
      <p>The two-time Olympic gold medallist underwent hip surgery at the end of January.</p>
      <p>Murray and wife Kim <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4947093/andy-murray-son-teddy-name/">gave birth to a baby boy</a> called Teddy last month.</p>
