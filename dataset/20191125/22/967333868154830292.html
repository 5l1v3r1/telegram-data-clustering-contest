        <b>A new survey conducted by marketing research company OnePoll is leading grannies across the US to clutch their pearls after its findings revealed that 1 in 4 Americans believe turkey is one of the most overrated Thanksgiving dishes.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Commissioned by fast food company Hardee’s, the <a href="https://www.studyfinds.org/gobbled-out-1-in-4-americans-are-tired-of-traditional-thanksgiving-food/">survey</a> of some 2,000 participants also revealed that aside from turkey, many Americans also listed cranberry sauce (37%), sweet potatoes (27%), green beans (25%) and mac and cheese (24%) as overrated.</p>
      <blockquote>With more than a quarter of those surveyed stating that traditional dishes are getting worn out, some 45% of surveyed Americans indicated that they’ve already changed their <a href="https://sputniknews.com/viral/201811231070063752-thanksgiving-turkey-optical-illusion/">Thanksgiving Day</a> culinary lineup. Overall, 30% of the participants have already ditched the bird, and more than 60% of individuals noted they would be willing to do the same.</blockquote>
      <p>Officials found that the shift away from traditional Thanksgiving foods was largely fueled by the hourslong preparations that the dishes - especially the turkey - require for the grand November feast. Other reasons included a desire to lessen stress, keep Thanksgiving somewhat low-key and focus more time on creating memories with family members, which 69% of respondents indicated was their favorite part of the holiday.</p>
      <p>Additionally, 35% of respondents noted that they’ve completely parted ways with the Thanksgiving kitchen showdown and have instead decided to enjoy their holiday meal at a restaurant.</p>
      <p>OnePoll’s findings weren’t completely unprecedented, though. </p>
      <blockquote>According to Thrillist, a recent Harris Poll <a href="https://news.instacart.com/turkey-day-expos%C3%A9-how-americans-really-feel-about-the-big-dinner-c7dbdf1146f7">survey</a>, which interviewed 2,000 individuals in the US, found that 68% of the participants loathe some traditional Thanksgiving day side dishes, even though they still scarfed them down because, you know, “tradition.”</blockquote>
      <p>Among Harris Poll’s most hated dishes were canned cranberry sauce, green bean casserole, sweet potato/sweet potato casserole, pumpkin pie and - drum roll, please - turkey. The survey also noted that 32% of surveyed millennials are not a fan of Thanksgiving leftovers, whereas 18% of baby boomers said they were not in favor.</p>
