      <p>Nov. 25 (UPI) -- President <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Donald_Trump/?tps=1">Donald Trump</a> on Monday appeared outside the White House with Conan, a special forces dog that was injured in the raid that killed <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Islamic-State/?tps=1">Islamic State</a> leader <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Abu-Bakr-al-Baghdadi/?tps=1">Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi</a>.</p>
      <p>Trump said that the White House awarded a medal and a plaque as he introduced the dog to the press at the <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Rose_Garden/?tps=1">Rose Garden</a> alongside first lady <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Melania-Trump/?tps=1">Melania Trump</a> and Vice President <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Mike_Pence/?tps=1">Mike Pence</a>.</p>
      <p>"I actually think Conan knew exactly what was going on," Trump said, calling the dog "very, very special."</p>
      <p>In October, Trump<a href="https://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2019/10/27/Trump-confirms-Islamic-State-leader-al-Baghdadi-dead/3121572151942/"> confirmed</a> that al-Baghdadi fled from U.S. military personnel during the raid and detonated a suicide vest in a dead-end tunnel, killing himself and three children.</p>
      <p>Conan was injured in the operation, but no U.S. personnel were killed.</p>
      <p>Both Trump and Pence noted that they met with the special forces members, who couldn't appear publicly, but said they were happy to welcome Conan to the White House.</p>
      <p>"I think having the special forces here today, who obviously can't come out in the public, but also having this extraordinary dog here today is all a reflection of our armed forces and the great job that they do," Pence said.</p>
      <p>The president said the United States has done "a lot of work" combatting IS since the raid and has also received help from other nations.</p>
      <p>"Certain things have happened that are very important. So we're in very good shape," he said.</p>
      <p>Trump said that Conan recovered very quickly from his injuries and has since gone on "very important raids."</p>
      <p>He also stated that Conan will not be retired following the injury, saying the dog is "primetime age-wise" to continue working.</p>
