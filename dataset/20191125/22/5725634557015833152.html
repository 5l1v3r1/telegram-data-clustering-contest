      <p>Summary</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Refining margins are getting obliterated. Tanker rates shot up again last week and refinery run cuts are now expected. So the question becomes, why are physical crude spreads so tight?</li>
        <li>We have a few theories as to why this is happening and Energy Aspect had a theory as well.</li>
        <li>Our take is that global crude is very tight and hence another reason why physical timespreads refuse to sell-off.</li>
        <li>We think the combination of OPEC exports being lower ~4 mb/d y-o-y and low global oil-on-water are contributing to the tight physical timespreads.</li>
        <li>As for global oil inventories, the overall trend has been supportive.Â We are now below last year's levels according to the high-frequency weekly reports.</li>

        <b>Welcome to the <i>global crude edition</i> of Oil Markets Daily!</b>
      </p>
      <p>Refining margins are getting obliterated. Tanker rates shot up again last week and refinery run cuts are now expected. <b>So the question becomes, why are physical crude spreads so tight?</b></p>

      <p>We have a few theories as to why this is happening and Energy Aspect had a theory as well.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Refineries are limited by how much they can cut throughput as local product supplies are tight.</li>
        <li>Drop in refining margins is related to higher tanker rates, not outright higher crude prices.</li>
        <li>Lower OPEC exports globally and lower global oil-on-water have kept crude supplies very tight.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>EA stated in today's weekly report that outright refinery run cut should have started, but due to constraints, the estimated run cut has only been ~300k b/d, which is puny.</p>
      <p>Our take is that global crude is very tight and hence another reason why physical timespreads refuse to sell-off.</p>

      <p>We think this is also largely contributable to OPEC exports being ~4 mb/d lower y-o-y. You can see that last November saw the Saudis spike exports to ~8.3 mb/d to placate Trump. This year? It is at ~6.7 mb/d for Nov.</p>

      <p>In addition, it appears Iraqi exports are being impacted by the recent protests with exports falling ~200k b/d m-o-m.</p>

      <p>Iraqi exports this year have also disappointed to the downside as you can see in the chart above.</p>
      <p>Finally, when you put the lower export figures together, you get lower oil-on-water.</p>

      <p>Which we think is the main cause for the backwardated timespreads in global crude.</p>
      <p>This, of course, is bullish for crude, but we will need to see the timespreads continue to hold-up as refinery throughput increases.</p>

      <p>Global CDU outages are expected to drop another ~4.3 mb/d by next month, so this increase in demand will quickly hit global crude storages.</p>
      <p>As for global oil inventories, the overall trend has been supportive.</p>

      <p>We are now below last year's levels according to the high-frequency weekly reports.</p>
      <p>But for oil watchers, the drop in refining margin is of concern, so we will be watching the physical spreads closely.</p>
