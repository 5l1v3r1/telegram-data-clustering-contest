      <p>US President Donald Trump on Monday publicly introduced Conan, the specially trained “Hero dog” that helped American commandoes in the mission that led to the death of ISIS leader Abu Bakr-al Baghdadi.</p>
      <p>Baghdadi, 48, died in October after the world’s most wanted terrorist was chased by the US special forces along with military working dogs.</p>
      <p>He blew up his suicide vest following the US raid on his compound in Syria’s Idlib province.</p>
      <p>The dog was brought to visit the White House and met President Trump in his Oval Office.</p>
      <p>Conan later appeared before the White House press corps in the Rose Garden along with Mr. Trump, the First Lady Melania and Vice President Mike Pence.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Mr. Trump also met with Special Forces involved in the attack in Northern Syria that resulted in the death of Baghdadi. The commandoes did not come out in the public.</p>
      <p>“Al Baghdadi is gone, but it was a flawless attack,” Mr. Trump told reporters.</p>
      <p>Mr. Trump said he met with the soldiers and had given Conan an award.</p>
      <p>He said: “The dog is incredible. So brilliant and so smart,” Mr. Trump said.</p>
      <p>He said both the soldiers and Conan did a fantastic job.</p>

      <p>In his remarks, Mr. Trump repeatedly praised Conan’s performance and described his breed as the ultimate at fighting and drug sniffing.</p>
      <p>He did not directly answer a question about whether he would adopt Conan, but he said that the dog would not be retiring and had more time to serve.</p>
      <p>According to a White House official, Conan was not accompanied by his normal handler for this appearance since the handler participated in the Baghdadi raid and cannot appear publicly.</p>
      <p>Conan appeared to be very calm and composed, during his Rose Garden appearance.</p>
      <p>The cannine, a four-year veteran of the Special Operations Command (SOCOM) Canine Programme, has been a member of approximately 50 combat missions and was injured during the raid at the hideout of Baghdadi in northwestern Syria.</p>
