      <p>Newcastle United were handed a reality check on a wet and miserable night at Villa Park.</p>
      <p>On a frustrating night against the newly promoted second city side, frustration in the away section set in and there were renewed calls for Mike Ashley to sell up from the Geordie faithful.</p>
      <p>Make no doubt about it, they’ve seen much worse from United on his watch but despite two wins in a row before the international break from Steve Bruce’s side, gallows humour on the terraces returned.</p>
      <p>Indeed, when Villa fans - revelling in a gift-wrapped win - chanted: “You’re ******* s**t”, the United fans felt inclined to agree with them.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/aston-villa-vs-newcastle-live-17302627">On a night when Newcastle were undone by their own mistakes</a> after two defensive gaffes at the end of the first half it was probably a little harsh.</p>
      <p>But a combination of failing to take chances in the offensive areas and awful mistakes in defence capped a dreadful night - and it’s Manchester City at home next.</p>
      <p>As the teams left the field both Jonjo Shelvey and Dwight Gayle bickered before applauding the fans.</p>
      <p>But if Gayle was talking about the lack of decent service he was exactly right.</p>
      <p>The former Crystal Palace man was afforded just TWO touches in 19 minutes while Andy Carroll managed just 12 and one shot on target in 28 minutes.</p>
      <p>United tested Aston Villa goalkeeper Tom Heaton early in the game when Allan Saint-Maximin tried his luck from distance with a powerful low shot, but it was gathered by the experienced stopper.</p>

      <p>On three minutes, Miguel Almiron tried his luck from long range but his effort was high and wide at the Holte End.</p>
      <p>Villa enjoyed 67% of the possession in the first 12 minutes and they nearly made that count when Matt Targett’s low cross zipped across the face of goal but the home side’s front men failed to connect.</p>
      <p>Newcastle countered well enough in the first quarter of the match but after Joelinton had cleared from a corner, Saint Maximin’s breaking run and pass to Almiron was met with a bad touch and poor attempt at goal.</p>
      <p>With 24 minutes on the clock, Joelinton bulldozed his way forward but he lacked composure in the box and his effort was snuffed out.</p>
      <p>Saint-Maximin caused havoc again on 27 minutes and won a free-kick on the left-hand side after a foul by Frederic Guilbert, but Jonjo Shelvey’s shot was collected by Heaton.</p>
      <p>Villa came close on 29 minutes when Luiz’s powerful effort was tipped over by Martin Dubravka.</p>
      <p>But the Slovakian international was let down by a silly and needless foul from Yedlin who shoved Grealish near the penalty area.</p>
      <p>Having escaped punishment in terms of a card Yedlin could only watch as Grealish teed up Conor Hourihane to sweep the ball majestically past Dubravka and hand Villa the lead on 32 minutes.</p>
      <p>Before Newcastle could regroup, Villa came flying forward again with Federico Fernandez booked for another foul on Grealish.</p>
      <p>Grealish’s free-kick was played into the box and Anwar El Ghazi was left unmarked to fire home the second goal in the space of four minutes.</p>
      <p>Newcastle almost clawed one back before the break when Shelvey’s corner picked out Fernandez but Heaton made a fine save to push the ball away.</p>
      <p>Newcastle went in 2-0 down at the break after sloppy defensive display.</p>
      <p>United started the second half with some urgency and Saint-Maximin’s low effort needed to be tipped wide by Heaton just two minutes in.</p>
      <p>However, the Magpies were grateful to Dubravka at the other end on 53 minutes as he pushed away Ezri Konsa’s header from Grealish’s corner with Newcastle’s marking again questionable.</p>
      <p>The black and whites regained some composure just before the hour with Almiron’s throw ending up at the feet of Isaac Hayden before the midfielder drove a shot at Heaton.</p>
      <p>Moments later, Saint-Maximin’s cross almost resulted in Konsa slicing past his own keeper but the ball went out for a corner.</p>
      <p>Bruce made his first change of the night just after the hour mark with Andy Carroll thrown into a 4-4-2 system to replace Paul Dummett.</p>
      <p>With 21 minutes left, Yedlin swung over a cross from the right to pick out Carroll but after chesting the ball down and firing at goal, Heaton gathered once more.</p>
      <p>Two minutes later, Carroll knocked the ball down for Joelinton but he blazed it spectacularly over the bar.</p>
      <p>It would prove to be the last act of the £40million man’s night with Dwight Gayle replacing him seconds later.</p>
      <p>Dubravka was needed again on 77 minutes as he blocked superbly to deny Wesley from close range after a left-wing cross.</p>
      <p>A third goal wouldn’t have been undeserved for Villa but nothing can disguise how poor Newcastle played for 90 minutes as they failed to rise to the occasion.</p>
      <p>Did United get ahead of themselves after two wins in a row?</p>
      <p>It’s not an unfair suggestion on this evidence.</p>
      <p>Blue Monday isn’t the word.</p>
