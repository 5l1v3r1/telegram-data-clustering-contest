      <h1>Showtime's 'Shameless': America Is a 'Piece of S**t Country'</h1>
      <h2>While today’s entertainment is riddled with subtle leftist and anti-American propaganda, Showtime’s latest episode of Shameless abandoned any and all subtlety on Sunday night when one of its characters — portrayed by actor William H. Macy — referred to the United States of America as a “piece of shit country.”</h2>

      <p>“Unlike this piece of shit country, my border turns away no one!” proclaimed Macy’s character, Frank Gallagher, in the episode, entitled, <i>Which America?</i></p>
      <p>At one point in Sunday night’s episode, Frank Gallagher had invited people to a party at his house, where he would charge ten dollars at the door in order to make some money off of his party-goers.</p>
      <p>“Party at the Gallagher’s house, starting right now,” said Frank Gallagher. “A keg has been procured and for ten bucks at the door, I invite you to celebrate my coronation as king. All are invited, and unlike this piece of shit country, my border turns away no one!”</p>

      <p>While working in a so-called “piece of shit country” — as the show’s writers like to put it — Macy makes $350,000 per episode of <i>Shameless</i>, according to a report by <i><a href="https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/tv-star-salaries-revealed-2017-robert-de-niro-david-letterman-ellen-degeneres-1202534375/">Variety</a></i>.</p>
      <p>In March, Macy was able to <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2019/03/13/actor-william-h-macy-avoids-charges-in-college-admissions-scandal-despite-meeting-with-alleged-mastermind/">avoid charges</a> involving the infamous college admissions scandal, despite being in the same room when his wife, Felicity Huffman first heard the pitch from a scam insider, according to an FBI affidavit.</p>
      <p>While the actor was able to dodge indictment — allowing him to get back to memorizing his character’s lines in the new <i>Shameless </i>script without any further duress — Huffman, on the other hand, was not as lucky, as she received a 14-day <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2019/09/13/felicity-huffman-sentenced-to-14-days-in-prison-for-college-bribery-scam/">prison sentence</a> for her role in the bribery scandal.</p>
      <p>The actress was <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2019/10/25/college-admissions-bribe-scandal-felicity-huffman-released-from-prison-three-days-early/">released from prison</a> three days early, and only ended up serving 11 days of her sentence.</p>
