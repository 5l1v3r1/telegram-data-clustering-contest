      <p>Headlines about Jacqueline Jossa's struggles in <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/">I'm A Celebrity</a> have dominated the press coverage so far this year.</p>
      <p>The young mum of two has struggled with fear over the trials, although performing in them really well.</p>
      <p>She has also been devastated to be put up for them time after time.</p>
      <p>And it appeared she would face her fears again tonight as Ant and Dec revealed who would be facing Arch of Agony.</p>
      <p>It was down to her and Andrew Maxwell... and luckily for the former Easties star the comedian was headed to the task this time.</p>

      <p>Earlier today her husband Dan Osborne slammed James Jordan for accusing his wife of being "fake" on <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/">I'm A Celebrity</a>.</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/eastenders/">EastEnders</a> actress has had a tough time in the jungle after being voted to do the last couple Bushtucker trials.</p>
      <p>Before each trial, Jacqueline has broke down in tears despite going on to absolutely smash them.</p>

      </p>
      <p>During last night's episode, former <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/strictly-come-dancing/">Strictly Come Dancing</a> pro James tweeted: "I’m normally a great judge of character I don’t know if it’s just me but I feel Jacqueline is acting the whole time on @imacelebrity.</p>
      <p>"Everything she does seems a little fake &amp; trying to be what she thinks the public want to see. Only my opinion guys."</p>
      <p>Dan, who has two daughters with Jacqueline, hit back: "Coming from someone who is married to her and lives with her, she isn’t being fake at all mate &amp; she isn’t acting.</p>
      <p>"She is dramatic and can be emotional but she would say that herself... but fake, ABSOLUTELY not."</p>

      <p>It comes after Dan begged viewers to stop voting for Jacqueline to do the gruesome trials.</p>
      <p>Jac <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/im-a-celebrity-jac-jossas-breakdown-as-shes-picked-for-trial-again/">broke down in tears</a> on Saturday night's show after she was voted to do the Crevice Of Cruelty task with Ian Wright.</p>
      <aside>I don’t know if it’s just me but I feel Jacqueline is acting the whole time.</aside>
      <p>The actress also cried when viewers voted for her to do the Snake Hotel trial with Myles Stephenson.</p>
      <p>Dan told his fans on Instagram: "Give her a break please because she's getting upset now."</p>
      <p>He also shared a snap of himself and Jacqueline when she tried on her jungle attire before flying to Australia.</p>

      <p>He wrote: "Smashing it in there girl!! This is when she had her fitting, trying on her jungle clothes, I’d just got out of bed... it’s come around so quick, now a week in and she’s doing great in there!</p>
      <p>"Really appreciate all the support you guys are giving her, literally had hundreds, possibly thousands of messages thank you."</p>
      <p>As well as the trials, Jacqueline has also been teary over being away from her children - daughters Ella, four, and Mia, one.</p>
      <p>Last night, she was seen crying as he buried her head in a pillow she brought in which featured photos of her little girls.</p>

      <p>She said in the Bush Telegraph: "I took myself off, had a little moment, looked at my kids on my pillow and I'll do the best I can, for them."</p>
      <p>Her campmate Kate Garraway told the camp: "I think she's just really scared and I know exactly that feeling and you just get to a point where you're too tired and you think, I can't do it again."</p>
      <p>I'm A Celebrity continues tomorrow at 9pm on ITV.</p>
