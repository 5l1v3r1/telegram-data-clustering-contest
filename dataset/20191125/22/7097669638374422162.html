      <p>Ottawa (AFP) - Good with cats: a stray dog found on the side of a road on a cold Canadian night keeping a litter of kittens warm needs a home.</p>
      <p>The two-year-old female mongrel, named Serenity by animal rescue officials, was discovered in a ditch on the side of a rural road near Chatham, Ontario a week ago.</p>
      <p>It was -3 degrees Celsius (26.6 Farenheit) and dark outside, and the dog was covered in a dusting of snow.</p>
      <p>When the passerby stopped to help the dog, she was surprised to find five tiny black kittens "snuggling with her," Myriam Armstrong, a spokeswoman for the Pet and Wildlife Rescue, told AFP.</p>
      <p>The unlikely companions were brought to the agency for care -- and their heartfelt story of survival and cross-species nurturing has been widely shared on social media.</p>
      <p>More than 30 people from across the continent have asked about adopting them.</p>
      <p>"The kittens wouldn't have survived the cold Canadian winter without this dog's help," Armstrong said.</p>
      <p>It's not clear how or what brought the dog and the now five-week old kittens together.</p>
      <p>But Armstrong said their bond continued at the shelter, describing how Serenity doted on the kittens.</p>
      <p>Many people have proposed finding them a home for the animals together, if possible.</p>
      <p>Armstrong said they will be ready to be adopted several weeks apart, however.</p>
      <p>Serenity will be ready next week after being spayed, but the kittens need another few weeks to fatten up and finish treatments for fleas and parasites.</p>
      <p>An Instagram post purportedly written by Serenity says she is young and energetic, needs some house training, but is "obviously great with cats and would have no problem going to a home that has cats in it."</p>
