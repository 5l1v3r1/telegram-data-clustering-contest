      <p>It was an unhappy return to Villa Park for <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Newcastle United</a> head coach <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/steve-bruce">Steve Bruce</a> after the Magpies suffered a 2-0 defeat against Aston Villa under the lights.</p>
      <p>First-half goals from Conor Hourihane and Anwar El Ghazi put the home side in complete control to send Dean Smith's side up to 15th and within a point of Newcastle.</p>
      <p>Here are five things we learned from the game.</p>
      <h3>Set-pieces tear Newcastle apart</h3>
      <p>Going forward, set-pieces proved crucial to Newcastle recording back-to-back wins against West Ham and Bournemouth but at the back they were undone by two free-kicks at Villa Park.</p>
      <p>Conor Hourihane's finish for the first was brilliant -a well-worked training ground routine involving the Ireland international and talisman Jack Grealish - but DeAndre Yedlin made a senseless foul in the build-up to give Villa a glorious opportunity.</p>
      <p>Then, just four minutes later, it was all to easy for the home side to double their advantage and Newcastle were too static as Anwar El Ghazi met Hourihane's free-kick to double his side's advantage.</p>
      <h3>Gameplan does not come off</h3>
      <p>In the early stages, Newcastle stood off and just seemed to show Villa, who had lost their previous three league games going into this, too much respect.</p>
      <p>The home support took plenty of encouragement from an energetic start from Dean Smith's side - Villa targeted Newcastle's right flank time and time again - and the Magpies struggled to gain a foothold in the game.</p>
      <p>Joelinton lacked service and Allan Saint-Maximin and Miguel Almiron lacked the spark they showed earlier this month, rarely getting the chance to run at Villa's defence.</p>

      <p>Without offering a threat going forward, Newcastle continued to invite pressure with a low block and the home side soon found the breakthrough.</p>
      <p>Bruce shifted to a 4-2-4 after the hour mark and Andy Carroll, Dwight Gayle and Christian Atsu all coming on but the Magpies' best effort came from Saint-Maximin from distance just after the break.</p>
      <h3>Not quite a Leicester but another wake-up call</h3>
      <p>Going into this game, Newcastle had claimed back-to-back wins and the training ground was bouncing, with the players all desperate to play after a lengthy international break.</p>
      <p>But the Magpies just did not get going at Villa Park and, for the first time this season, found themselves 2-0 down going into half-time.</p>
      <p>Newcastle can ill-afford starts like this at this level and should know that by now.</p>
      <h3>An unhappy return for Steve Bruce</h3>
      <p>'Brucie, what's the score? Brucie, Brucie, what's the score?' rang out after El Ghazi put the home side 2-0 up and how the Newcastle head coach would have hoped for a different outcome on his first return to Villa Park since being sacked more than a year ago.</p>
      <p>Bruce has seen and heard much worse - a cabbage was flung at him by a Villa game before his last game in charge - but this was an unhappy return to his former home.</p>

      <p>There were a few boos for Bruce as he climbed down the steps of the team bus and made his way to the away dressing room at 6.30pm but there were plenty of friendly faces there on the way there to greet him and shake his hand.</p>
      <p>It was a similar story when he walked down the touchline, with one Villa fan sticking a hand out for him to shake. Ultimately, though, it was Villa fans who tasted a sweet victory.</p>
      <h3>Season-defining weeks ahead</h3>
      <p>Newcastle would have been up to ninth place had they beaten VillaÂ  but Bruce's side now find themselves in 14th place, five points clear of the relegation zone ahead of the visit of champions Man City on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Bruce admitted the next few weeks will define the Magpies' season given how many games they are playing . Getting anything against City will be a bonus but Bruce will have looked at those games against those teams in and around Newcastle, including Villa, to target points.</p>
      <p>The Magpies will have to be much better against Southampton, Crystal Palace et al in the coming weeks - otherwise they will be dragged right back into the mix.</p>
