      <p>Westlife have granted the wish of a terminally ill fan battling cancer by inviting her backstage to meet them at a recent show.</p>
      <p>The boys – Markus Feehily, Shane Filan, Nicky Byrne and Kian Egan – met Mairead Nolan in Dublin on Friday night.</p>
      <p>The super fan was diagnosed with terminal ovarian cancer last October.</p>
      <p>Mairead says she was invited backstage at RTE Studios, where the guys – known for hits like Mandy and Flying Without Wings – were rehearsing for their Late Late Show performance.</p>
      <p>Speaking to the <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/news/irish-news/cork-woman-mairead-nolans-dying-20945437">Irish Sunday Mirror</a>, Mairead, from Cork, said: ‘I am in floods of tears after meeting them, I was just so excited. It was better than my wildest dreams and it has given me a lift and the push I need to fight the cancer.’</p>
      <p>She furthermore explained: ‘I was shaking with nerves, I was worried about what way they might be towards me but they were calling my name, they knew all about me.</p>

      <p>‘They came over and were hugging me, kissing me and taking selfies. It was the best day of my life.</p>
      <p>‘I can die happy now, if something happens to me at least I know I have met them and they were so nice to me.’</p>
      <p>What an inspiring story. And they say you should never meet your idols.</p>
      <p>The guys’ act of kindness follows a blazing music comeback for the four-piece, which last week culminated in them scoring Ireland’s year’s <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/22/westlife-achieves-eighth-uk-number-one-album-with-comeback-effort-spectrum-11202598/">fastest-selling album</a>.</p>
      <p>Spectrum is their 11th studio LP and first since 2010. It was preceded by the hit singles Hello My Love and Better Man, released earlier this year.</p>
      <p>Congratulations, guys. All this success couldn’t be happening to nicer people.</p>
