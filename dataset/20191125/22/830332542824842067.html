      <p>MADISON, Wis. - Gov. Tony Evers has signed a bill into law that allows children to legally run lemonade stands.</p>
      <p>Evers signed the bill Monday.</p>
      <p>It allows anyone under age 18 to run lemonade stands on private property without a permit and without fear of running afoul of the law, which has happened in some states.</p>
      <p>The bill would limit sales to $2,000 of lemonade a year, however. That translates to 8,000 cups at 25 cents each. Children would be barred from selling any potentially hazardous food, such as raw meat and egg salad.</p>
      <p>The bill passed with bipartisan support.</p>
