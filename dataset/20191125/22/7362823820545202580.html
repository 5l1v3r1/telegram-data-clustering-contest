      <p>Last week, ABC <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/hannah-brown-reacts-windmill-peter-weber">rolled out its “Bachelor” trailer</a>, in which the infamous windmill of the Brown-Weber fantasy suite sleepover made an expected appearance. Brown said the two <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/the-bachelorette-hannah-b-pete-windmill-sex-elimination">had sex in the windmill some four times</a> after admitting she was previously “a little dishonest” when she said they did the deed only twice.</p>

      <p>Weber made headlines last month when he <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/bachelor-peter-weber-rushed-to-hospital-costa-rica-freak-accident">endured a head injury</a> in a “freak accident” involving a golf cart while filming the season in Costa Rica.</p>
      <p>“Bachelor” host <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/bachelor-peter-weber-rushed-to-hospital-costa-rica-freak-accident">Chris Harrison confirmed to Fox News</a> at the time that “Peter suffered a freak accident. He got a cut on his head, he did get stitches but he’s 100 percent OK and production is already back underway," Harrison said. "He’s still the dashing, handsome pilot we’ve all dreamed of."</p>

However, according to <a href="http://people.com/tv/bachelor-peter-weber-gets-stitches-out-cut-on-forehead-source/">People</a>, Weber's injury was "not as bad as what [was] being reported.”</p>
