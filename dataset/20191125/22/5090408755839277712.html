      <p>WeWork cofounder Adam Neumann reportedly helped the White House adviser and President <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-donald-trump-bio-age-family-key-positions-2019-4">Donald Trump</a>‘s son-in-law Jared Kushner cut a video promoting his Middle East peace plan, which a BuzzFeed News reporter has now apparently unearthed.</p>
      <p>WeWork has seen a dramatic and highly publicized crash and burn throughout 2019. The startup’s valuation dropped by billions of dollars, its initial public offering was delayed, and the company’s future is left uncertain amid massive layoffs and turnover in its executive team, with SoftBank now coming to its rescue.</p>
      <p>But outside the turmoil within the company itself, Neumann, a former Israeli soldier, also involved himself in global geopolitics and believed he could “solve the world’s thorniest problems,” according to Vanity Fair.</p>
      <p>In <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/11/inside-the-fall-of-wework">a deep dive into the embattled coworking startup</a> published on Thursday, the Vanity Fair correspondent Gabe Sherman reported that executives “were shocked to discover Neumann was working on Jared Kushner’s Mideast peace effort.”</p>
      <p>Even though Kushner lacks formal diplomatic experience, the Israel-Palestine conflict is one of many issues in his portfolio in his post as a senior White House adviser.</p>
      <p>Business Insider <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/adam-and-rebekah-neumanns-ties-to-jared-kushner-and-ivanka-trump-2019-9">previously reported</a> that Neumann and his wife, Rebekah, are “close friends” with Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump, and even invited the couple to Rebekah’s extravagant 40th birthday bash in Italy.</p>
      <p>Two sources familiar with the matter told <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/11/inside-the-fall-of-wework">Vanity Fair that</a> Neumann dispatched the WeWork development director Roni Bahar to enlist an advertising firm to create “a slick video for Kushner that would showcase what an economically transformed West Bank and Gaza would look like.” Bahar later told Vanity Fair that he simply helped arrange the video’s production, and WeWork did not at all fund the video.</p>
      <p>On Monday, the BuzzFeed News technology reporter Ryan Mac tweeted what he said he believes to be footage of Kushner presenting the video that Neumann helped him make at the Peace to Prosperity Workshop hosted in June in Bahrain.</p>

      <p>“This is not a conference where people come to benefit themselves. You all have big responsibilities and a lot of places you could be, and the fact that you’re showing up to do this shows that you care about the region, and you care about doing good in the world,” Kushner says to the audience at the beginning of the clip.</p>
      <p>Kushner then shows his promotional animated video, set to upbeat music, detailing his ambitious plan to bring peace to the Israel-Palestine region.</p>
      <p>The video opens with a shot of greenery sprouting up and blooming throughout the poverty-stricken regions of Gaza and West Bank. This is meant to represent Kushner’s plans to bring “prosperity” to the region by “empowering” the Palestinian people through big investments in infrastructure, jobs, education, and “building a digital society.”</p>
