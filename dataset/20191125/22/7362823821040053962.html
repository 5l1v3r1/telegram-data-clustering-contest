      <p>"As we enter this week of Thanksgiving we have something we’d like to share... Such overwhelming love has surrounded us this last month," TobyMac -- whose real name is Toby McKeehan -- <a href="https://twitter.com/tobymac/status/1198748131724316673?s=20">wrote in a social media post</a> on Thursday.</p>

"As we mourn our firstborn son, God has poured out His love on us... through people.

      <p>Truett, who was an aspiring rapper and collaborated with his father on a few tracks, died on Oct. 24.  <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/tobymac-son-truett-mckeehan-dead">A rep for TobyMac told Fox News at the time that Truett died at his Nashville home.</a> He was 21.</p>
      <p>"Toby was traveling back from Canada and did not get home to be with his family until after midnight last night so there is no statement. We just ask that everyone please be respectful of their privacy during this time and allow them to grieve their loss," the singer's rep said.</p>
      <p>In a tribute written by TobyMac, and obtained by Fox News, he said his son "had joy that took the room when he entered."</p>

      <p>"He was a magnetic son and brother and friend. If you met him you knew him, you remembered him," TobyMac wrote. "His smile, his laugh, the encouragement he offered with words or even without. He had an untamable grand personality and dreams to match. And he hated being put in a box."</p>

      <p>"We don’t follow God because we have some sort of under the table deal with Him, like we’ll follow you if you bless us. We follow God because we love Him. It’s our honor."</p>
      <p>"He is the God of the hills and the valleys," TobyMac said. "And He is beautiful above all things."</p>
