      <h2>England star was subjected to "disturbing" racial insults by a spectator during the first Test against the Black Caps</h2>

      <p>New Zealand Cricket (NZC) will apologise to Jofra Archer on Tuesday after England's pace sensation was racially abused by a fan during the first Test in Mount Maunganui.</p>
      <p>Archer claimed he'd been subjected to "disturbing" racial insults while he batted during the series-opener as England tried, in vain, to hold on for a draw on the Test's fifth day.</p>

      <p>NZC issued a statement hours after Archer's tweet confirming the fast bowler had been racially abused as he left the field after the Black Caps sealed an innings-and-65-run win in the game's final session.</p>
      <p>The statement also promised to increase security for the second Test in Hamilton, beginning Friday.</p>
      <p>"Although security providers at the venue (were) unable to locate the perpetrator, NZC will be examining CCTV footage and making further inquiries tomorrow in an endeavour to identify the man responsible," read NZC's statement.</p>
      <p>"NZC has zero tolerance towards abusive or offensive language at any of its venues and will refer any developments in the case to police.</p>
      <p>"It will contact Mr Archer tomorrow to apologise for the unacceptable experience, and to promise increased vigilance in the matter when the teams next meet in Hamilton."</p>
      <p>Archer added in his tweet that the crowd had "been amazing this week except for that one guy" and praised the England's touring spectator group, the Barmy Army.</p>
