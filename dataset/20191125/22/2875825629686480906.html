      <h2>A woman claimed her 83-year-old mother who has dementia was left on a chair in urine-soaked clothes</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T22:36:08+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 22:36</time> by <a rel="author">Aoife Moore, David Raleigh</a></address>
      <p>Patients' families hit out at a “cattle mart” A&amp;E as the highest-ever levels of patient overcrowding were recorded on Monday at <br/>University Hospital Limerick.</p>
      <p>A woman claimed her 83-year-old mother who has dementia was left on a chair in urine-soaked clothes last week as staff were initially too busy to change her catheter bag.</p>
      <p>UHL set the shameful new record with 85 patients on trolleys.</p>
      <p>A spokesman apologised to patients “experiencing lengthy waits for beds”, and that the hospital was “working to alleviate the situation”.</p>
      <p>The elderly patient attended UHL last Monday night along with her 62-year-old daughter.</p>
      <p>However, despite complaining at 9.45pm that the bag was leaking, it wasn’t until 3.50am that staff attended.</p>
      <p>The daughter said: “She was soaked, there was urine everywhere. She wasn’t on a trolley, she was in the waiting room on the chair. It was wet everywhere. They gave me a pad but her clothes we’re wet and her coat was wet – it was sopping, it was disgusting.”</p>

      <p>The patient and her daughter returned to UHL at 4pm yesterday after the pensioner fell. She was still waiting on a trolley 24 hours later with a suspected broken bone in her back.</p>
      <p>The woman said: “It’s madness. They didn’t even have trolleys, people were on chairs, any space they could find at the end of trolleys.”</p>
      <p>Despite their ordeal she praised “brilliant” staff for doing their best.</p>
      <p>Noreen Keane, 76, from Rhebogue, attended the hospital at 8.30pm Sunday complaining of severe pain.</p>
      <p>The Limerick grandmother eventually got a bed in a single room nine hours later.</p>
      <p>Her daughter Karen Ryan said: “We are the lucky ones.</p>
      <p>“It’s ridiculous in there. It’s like a cattle market, there are trolleys everywhere. You’re standing over trolleys to get into the room, it’s madness.”</p>
      <p>John Monaghan, 73, from Ennis, Co Clare, arrived at UHL at 11.30am on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Despite being seriously ill he was still in A&amp;E, waiting on a trolley, “praying” for a bed, over 24 hours later.</p>

      <p>Mr Monaghan’s son John said: “I feel sorry for the staff. Genuinely, they are trying their hardest in there.</p>
      <p>“They are trying to fit oxygen bottles to people in the corridors. The staff are just thrown to the wolves.“</p>
      <p>Mr Monaghan Jnr, who travelled from his home in Belfast, said his father was suffering with “fluid on the lungs, breathing difficulty” and was diagnosed with cancer last week.</p>
      <p>He added: “His lips went blue and they rushed him in. He had kidney failure, but he’s had a kidney <br/>transplant so he’s attending renal and he was diagnosed with cancer. He has all that and now this here.”</p>
      <p>In a statement a hospital spokesman urged the public to “consider all care options before attending A&amp;E today”.</p>
      <p>He said the hospital group was “appropriately transferring patients to other hospitals” and were “receiving expert medical care [with] every effort being made to make their stay as comfortable as possible”. The spokesman added: “People may attend a GP or out-of-hours service for referral to an Assessment Unit the following day if required.</p>
      <p>“Local Injury Units (LIUs) are open at Ennis and Nenagh Hospitals and St John’s Hospital for broken bones, dislocations, sprains, strains, wounds, scalds and minor burns.</p>

      <p>“In the 24 hours prior to 8am [yesterday], 183 patients had attended the hospital’s Emergency Department. This is significantly above the norm for a Sunday. We regret any patient has to wait on a trolley for admission. This is not the service we wish to provide.”</p>
      <p>The Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation called for emergency funding to tackle the crisis.</p>
      <p>Among its demands included the cancellation of non-essential elective work and more home care packages to move patients out of the hospital.</p>
      <p>It also called for an immediate end to the recruitment ban for nurses and midwives and extra support for GPs and Public Health Nurses to allow more home/community treatment.</p>
      <p>Yesterday there were a further 631 patients without beds across the country, 22 of them children.</p>
      <p>The other worst-hit included Cork University Hospital, 52, Letterkenny University Hospital, 47, Tallaght University Hospital, 36 and University Hospital Galway, 33.</p>

      <p>INMO spokeswoman Mary Fogarty said: “Despite the best efforts of staff, the situation in Limerick escalates.</p>
      <p>“The hospital is breaking records in the worst possible way. Promises of improvement will not suffice. Action is needed.</p>
      <p>“Without an increase in beds and the professionals to staff them, this problem will continue to escalate.</p>
      <p>Labour TD Alan Kelly has called for a bespoke plan for UHL. He said: “This is not good enough. The circumstances people are being left in are disgraceful.</p>
      <p>“Staff in UHL are over stretched, stressed beyond words because of the recruitment ban the Government continues to deny exists.</p>
      <p>“Health Minister Simon Harris cannot plead ignorance on this one.</p>
      <p>“The grave concerns of patients and staff are constantly being brought to the minister’s attention and he seems to be doing very little to solve the problems.”</p>
