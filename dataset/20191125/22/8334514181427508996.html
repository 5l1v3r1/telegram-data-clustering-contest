      <p>LIMA (Reuters) - Peru’s Constitutional Tribunal on Monday ordered the release of opposition leader Keiko Fujimori, jailed last year for alleged money laundering and receiving illegal contributions from Brazilian construction company Odebrecht.</p>
      <p>The members of Peru’s top court decided to release Fujimori by a narrow margin of four votes in favor versus three against, the body’s president Ernesto Blume said at a press conference.</p>
      <p>Fujimori has been serving an 18-month pre-trial sentence since October 2018 after prosecutors said she led a criminal organization and received millions of dollars from Odebrecht during her 2011 election campaign.</p>
      <p>She denies the accusations.</p>
      <p>“The court has not passed judgment on the substantive issue in the case of citizen Keiko Fujimori, and has not declared her acquittal or condemned her,” Blume said.</p>
      <p>Fujimori is the daughter of the country’s authoritarian ex-President Alberto Fujimori, who is serving a 25-year sentence for human rights crimes and graft.</p>
      <p>The decision comes as the country prepares to hold legislative elections on Jan. 26 after President Martín Vizcarra dissolved Congress amid a battle with lawmakers over his anti-graft campaign. Keiko Fujimori’s Popular Force party had held a majority in Congress before its dissolution.</p>
      <p>Popular Force, a conservative right-wing group, has announced it will participate in the January elections, but Fujimori is not expected to take part.</p>
