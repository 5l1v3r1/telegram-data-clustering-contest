      <h3>Women’s State of Origin matches may be taken to Townsville if the concept outgrows its new home at the Sunshine Coast.</h3>
      <p>NRL boss Todd Greenberg confirmed on Monday that the 2020 Women’s State of Origin clash would be held at the 12,000 capacity Sunshine Coast Stadium in June after two years at North Sydney Oval.</p>

      <p>It will mark the first time women’s Origin will be held in Queensland but not everyone in the Sunshine State is happy.</p>
      <p>Townsville Mayor Jenny Hill wanted their new $290 million, 25,000 seat North Queensland Stadium to host the fixture, describing the NRL’s decision to pick Sunshine Coast as a “kick in the guts”.</p>
      <p>But Greenberg said women’s Origin may yet head north if the concept continued to prosper.</p>

      <p>“I know the Townsville Mayor very well and it’s nice to see she is disappointed when she can’t get the content that she so richly wants,” he said.</p>
      <p>“I understand that disappointment. All I would say to the mayor is be patient.</p>
      <p>“There is a lot of content to come to Queensland including the new stadium at Townsville.</p>
      <p>“We will start here (Sunshine Coast) and see if we can grow it.”</p>

      <p>Greenberg said women’s Origin had outgrown North Sydney Oval and believed it would gain further momentum on the Sunshine Coast, not ruling out the series one day featuring three matches.</p>

      <p>“We played in Sydney and ultimately we grew out of that in the second year - we hope the same problem eventuates here,” said Greenberg, who expected the June 2020 clash to be a sellout.</p>
      <p>“We will get through the first year (at Sunshine Coast) and consider what it looks like in 2021.</p>
      <p>“The other component on our calendar is how do we grow the women’s State of Origin game - can we make it more than one game, can it be two and ultimately three games?</p>
      <p>“We will go slowly and strategically, make sure we don’t overload our players.”</p>
