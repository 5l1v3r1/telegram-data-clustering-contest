      <p>Earlier in August, CBS and Viacom agreed to merge, creating a company with more than US$28 billion in revenue, as an increasingly competitive media landscape prompted their controlling shareholder to reunify the U.S. entertainment companies 13 years after breaking them up.</p>
      <p>The two companies are controlled by National Amusements Inc, the holding company owned by billionaire Sumner Redstone and his family.</p>
