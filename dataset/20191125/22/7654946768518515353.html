      <h1>Bengals go back to Andy Dalton in mission to avoid 0-16</h1>

      <p>The Ryan Finley experiment is over for now.</p>
      <p>On Monday, the Bengals announced <a href="https://twitter.com/Bengals/status/1199053203482001408?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet">via their official Twitter account</a> that veteran quarterback Andy Dalton would start against the Jets on Sunday after a 16-10 loss to the Steelers. The team made the switch to the rookie before their Week 9 bye after starting the season 0-8 in order to evaluate their fourth-round pick.</p>
      <p>“Just win. We just want to win. We just want to win. Just get us some wins,” coach Zac Taylor said.</p>
      <p>Finley, the former NC State star, completed 47 percent of his passes with two touchdowns, two interceptions and is averaging a mere 158 passing yards per game in the three losses he started.</p>
      <p>After losing to Pittsburgh on Sunday, Taylor would not comment on personnel changes. He noted that three games was not a lot of time to evaluate Finley, <a href="https://twitter.com/LaurelPfahler/status/1198715096438059011">per the Dayton Daily News</a>.</p>
      <p>Dalton, 32, will make his 129th regular season start on Sunday against a <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/24/gregg-williams-and-this-jets-defense-are-for-real/">Jets defense that held the Raiders to three points</a> last week. Through eight seasons, Dalton has a 68-58-2 record, 30,352 passing yards, 197 touchdowns and a career completion percentage of 62 percent. In his last appearance against the Rams, he completed 32-of-52 passes for 329 yards and a touchdown.</p>

      <p>The Bengals have suffered injuries to key skill players such as John Ross and A.J. Green and their offensive line is 29th in the league in sacks allowed per game. At 0-11, they are primed for the top pick of the 2020 NFL Draft. Based on Finley’s performance through three games, they will likely take a quarterback, possibly LSU’s Joe Burrow or Oregon’s Justin Herbert, in the first round.</p>
