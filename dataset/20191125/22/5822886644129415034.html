      <h1>Here's A Healthier Version Of The Iconic Green Bean Casserole</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T22:18:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 22:18</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.mindbodygreen.com/wc/william-cole-dc" target="_blank">Functional Medicine Practitioner</a></address>
      <p>Everyone's favorite Thanksgiving dish, the iconic green bean casserole is usually made with cans of cream of who-knows-what and loads of flour. A lot of no-no's if you are following <a href="https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/what-is-the-keto-diet-how-do-you-do-it">a ketogenic diet</a> (high fat, moderate protein, low carbohydrate). While its main ingredients—green beans and onions—are actually low-carb and perfectly fine to enjoy while following a keto diet, the rest has got to go.</p>
      <p>Not to worry though, as the author of the plant-based keto book, <a href="https://drwillcole.com/ketotarian/"><i>Ketotarian</i></a>, I have a couple keto tricks up my sleeve when it comes to easy and delicious swaps. And with a just few simple substitutions you can still take part in this classic dish.</p>
