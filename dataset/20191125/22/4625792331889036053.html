      <h1>Elizabeth Warren launches full-frontal attack against Michael Bloomberg after not directly attacking 2020 Democratic rivals</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T22:46:02+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 22:46</time> by <a rel="author">Emily Larsen</a></address>
      <p>Elizabeth Warren broke her tradition of not directly attacking rivals in the Democratic presidential primary with a strong rebuke of Michael Bloomberg's candidacy.</p>
      <p>"I am here today on Day Two of Michael Bloomberg's $37 million ad buy," Warren said Monday in Iowa, referring to the former New York mayor's record-setting weeklong <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/michael-bloomberg-set-to-spend-more-in-one-week-on-tv-ad-blitz-than-any-candidate-ever">ad blitz</a> that started earlier in the day. It was her first public campaign appearance since Bloomberg launched his presidential campaign on Sunday. "He doesn't need people, he only needs bags and bags of money. I think Michael Bloomberg is wrong and that's what we need to prove in this election."</p>
      <p>The Massachusetts senator has proposed a wealth tax on millionaires and billionaires and has made being an antagonist of billionaires a cornerstone of her campaign. She <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/13/elizabeth-warren-blasts-billionaires-in-campaign-ad-calling-for-wealth-tax.html">ran an ad</a> that shamed specific billionaires and that sells a " <a href="https://shop.elizabethwarren.com/products/billionaire-tears-mug">Billionaire Tears</a>" mug in her campaign merchandise shop.</p>
      <p>"His view is that he doesn't need people who knock on doors, he doesn't need to get out and campaign with people, he doesn't need volunteers, and if you get out and knock on 1,000 doors, he'll just spend another $37 million to flood the airwaves. And that's how he plans to buy a nomination in the Democratic Party," Warren said of Bloomberg.</p>
      <p>The Bloomberg's campaign website has a <a href="https://www.mikebloomberg.com/volunteer">volunteer</a> sign-up page, potentially refuting Warren's assertion that his campaign does not plan to utilize unpaid volunteers. He is also expected to try to secure support from <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/amberjamieson/bloomberg-gun-violence-moms-demand-action-volunteers">volunteers</a> for Moms Demand Action, the gun control activist wing of Everytown for Gun Safety that Bloomberg founded.</p>
      <p>"But that's exactly what's now at play in 2020: Which vision of our democracy, which version of our democracy, is going to win?" Warren said. "And if Michael Bloomberg's version of democracy wins, then democracy changes, and it's going to be about which billionaire you can stomach going forward. Because, believe me, there are plenty of billionaires who think they should be president, or, at a minimum, should be picking the president."</p>
      <p>Bloomberg responded to Warren's attacks when speaking to reporters in Norfolk, Virginia on Monday.</p>
      <p>"For years I’ve been using my resources for the things that matter to me. I was lucky enough to build a successful company. It has been very successful and I’ve used all of it to give back to help America. I’m committed to fight for gun safety. I’m committed to fight for stopping climate change, which is a disaster for us. I’m committed to doing things like," Bloomberg said. "I’m fully commitment to defeating Donald Trump. I think he’s an existential threat to our country. I’m going to make my case and let the voters, who are plenty smart, make their choice."</p>
