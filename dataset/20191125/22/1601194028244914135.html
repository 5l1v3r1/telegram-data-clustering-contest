      <p>A World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) panel has recommended that Russia should be handed a four-year ban from competing in - and also hosting - major sporting events.</p>
      <p>Russian athletes may once again have to compete as neutrals at the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo after WADA's independent Compliance Review Committee (CRC) recommended the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) be declared non-compliant.</p>
      <p>The CRC believe there should be strong consequences for RUSADA after considering a report from WADA's Intelligence and Investigations Department (I&amp;I) and independent forensic experts.</p>
      <p>Based on the investigations, CRC determined that "hundreds" of presumed adverse analytical findings had been removed from a database in a Moscow Laboratory, with underlying raw data and PDF files deleted or altered.</p>
      <p>The CRC concluded RUSADA was guilty of "an extremely serious case of non-compliance with the requirement to provide an authentic copy of the Moscow data, with several aggravating features".</p>
      <p>WADA's Executive Committee (ExCo) will consider the CRC's recommendation at a specially convened meeting in Paris on December 9.</p>
      <p>Among the suggested actions are Russian athletes being unable to compete for their country in the summer and winter Olympics, as well as "any other event organised by a major event organisation", and "any World Championships organised by any signatory".</p>
      <p>Russia could also be unable to stage major events over a four-year period. They are due to host fixtures during Euro 2020, including a quarter-final.</p>
      <p>RUSADA was suspended by WADA in November 2015 in the wake of accusations of widespread corruption and state-sponsored doping, resulting in athletes from the European nation competing in neutral uniforms at the 2016 Rio Games.</p>
