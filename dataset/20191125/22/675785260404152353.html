      <h1>Marco Silva dodging Everton sack due to struggle for suitable replacement</h1>
      <h2>Former manager David Moyes could come in as a short-term option at Everton but Farhad Moshiri knows there has been fan resistance to his return</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T22:30:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">David Maddock, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/david-maddock/</a></address>
      <p>Marco Silva will take Everton training on Tuesday – but only because club owner Farhad Moshiri cannot decide on a suitable replacement.</p>
      <p>Moshiri is under pressure to get this decision right for the long-term, after two disastrous appointments in his first two years in charge.</p>
      <p>He hired and then sacked Ronald Koeman after just 16 months and followed it with the disastrous knee-jerk appointment of Sam Allardyce, as <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/everton-fc">Everton</a> flirted with the relegation zone.</p>
      <p>And even though David Moyes could be a safe short-term option, Moshiri knows there has been fan resistance to the return of the former manager.</p>
      <p>It is the Allardyce reign that has forced Moshiri to step back from his initial instinct to sack Silva in the hours after the disastrous defeat by bottom club Norwich on Saturday.</p>

      <p>He knows supporters have had enough of Silva after they chanted, ‘you’re getting sacked in the morning’. But he is also painfully aware that they will not stomach another appointment as Allardyce – who was the most unpopular manager in the club’s history.</p>
      <p>The supporters are desperate for a high-profile manager such as Mauricio Pochettino, Massimiliano Allegri or a Jose Mourinho type figure.</p>
      <p>But that is simply unrealistic given the club’s current position and the competition for experienced top-level managers, with the likes of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> , <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> and even <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> likely to be in the market in the near future.</p>

      <p>Moyes knows the club inside out, has shown he can organise a failing team and kept <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> up a year ago, after arriving with the club mired deep in relegation trouble.</p>
      <p>Moshiri is a fan of Moyes and he could well offer the former boss the job if there are no obvious better alternatives. But he is also casting his net wider to show supporters every option has been considered.</p>
      <p>Former Everton player Mikel Arteta is also a target but he is interesting Arsenal and it would take something special to prise him from <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> at the moment.</p>

      <p>The same applies to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/afc-bournemouth">Bournemouth</a> boss Eddie Howe. Moshiri is a fan and Howe has been on the radar at Goodison Park for a while. But it is hugely unlikely he would consider leaving mid-season.</p>
      <p>Names such as Mark Hughes and former Porto coach Vitor Pereira have also been mentioned but they have met with an underwhelming response from supporters.</p>
      <p>And that conundrum could see Silva left in charge for the visit to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> on Sunday, as the club’s board considers the position further.</p>
      <p>It is hard to see how Silva survives much longer, however, with Everton hosting high-flying <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> the following Saturday.</p>
