      <p>The 18.5-foot douglas fir tree from Mahantongo Valley Farms in Pitman, Penn., was delivered to the White House on a horsedrawn carriage at around noon on Monday.</p>
      <p>Trump inspected the tree as the <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/U.S._Marine/?tps=1">U.S. Marine</a> Band played "O Christmas Tree."</p>
      <p>The first lady also posed for photos with Mahantongo Valley Farms owner Larry Snyder and his family.</p>
      <p>Snyder was named Grand Champion of the annual tree contest held by the <a href="https://realchristmastrees.org/Portals/22/2019%20Membership/2019WHTreeSelectionPressRelease.pdf?ver=2019-11-24-003051-887">National Christmas Tree Association</a>, which selects the White House Tree each year.</p>
      <p>"We are honored to have the opportunity to represent the tree growers of America, by continuing the tradition of providing a tree to the White House Blue Room, which will be viewed by millions of people," said Snyder. "This will be a memorable experience of a lifetime for our family, especially for our children and grandchildren, who are accompanying us for the presentation fo the tree to the White House."</p>
