      <h1>Triple-killer released on bail just hours before 'murdering' three pensioners</h1>
      <h2>Alexander Lewis-Ranwell was considered a 'serious risk to the public' but killed three pensioners shortly after he was freed.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T22:52:53+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 22:52</time> by <a rel="author">Paul Greaves</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/police">Police</a> identified a former public schoolboy as a 'serious risk to the public' but still released him just hours before he murdered three male pensioners, a court heard.</p>
      <p>Alexander Lewis-Ranwell, 28, was freed from custody on the morning of the murders after a doctor's recommendation he be seen by a mental health nurse was ignored.</p>
      <p>The court heard he was under the delusion he was uncovering a paedophile ring when he killed Anthony Payne, 80, and 84-year-old twin brothers, Roger and Dick Carter.</p>
      <p>Lewis-Ranwell has admitted the killings in February, but pleaded not guilty to murder on the basis of insanity.</p>

      <p>The victims were all killed in Exeter, Devon, just a couple of hours apart with Lewis-Ranwell using a hammer in one attack and a spade in the other.</p>
      <p>Exeter Crown <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/courts">Court</a> heard on Monday that he was arrested the day before the murder for an attack on farmer John Ellis with a 4ft saw.</p>
      <p>But despite showing signs of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/mental-health">mental illness</a> , the jury was told Lewis-Ranwell was released on bail the next morning.</p>
      <p>He then travelled to Exeter where he embarked on a killing spree over a mistaken belief from the defendant that he was uncovering a ring of child sex offenders.</p>
      <p>Prosecution barrister Richard Smith QC told the jury Lewis Ranwell killed his first victim around 12.30pm on February 10 when he murdered Anthony Payne with a hammer.</p>
      <p>Around two and a half hours later he killed the elderly twins with a spade, the court heard.</p>
      <p>But the jury heard evidence that police had expressed concerns that Lewis-Ranwell would be a danger to the public if he was released.</p>
      <p>The court heard after his arrest for the farmer attack he remained at Barnstaple Police Station throughout the day.</p>
      <p>Police arranged for him to be assessed by medical professionals.</p>
      <p>His erratic behaviour included saying he wanted to protect all animals and he had 'lost his unicorn'.</p>
      <p>And an inspector reviewing his detention stated the 'detained person presents a serious risk to public if released'.</p>
      <p>The defendant also confirmed he had been sectioned twice previously and was not currently taking medication.</p>
      <p>At 6.30pm that day he was seen by a Forensic Medical Examiner and he was spitting and behaving aggressively to police.</p>
      <p>The doctor said just before 7pm that as he was not suicidal or psychotic or presenting acute mental health illness there was no need for a full mental health assessment at that time.</p>
      <p>The doctor did recommended that the next morning Lewis-Ranwell should be seen by a mental health nurse before being released from custody - but this never happened.</p>
      <p>While in custody that evening it is agreed that Lewis-Ranwell continued to exhibit bizarre and sometime aggressive behaviour to police.</p>

      <p>This included asking for water and when it arrived throwing it at the officer.</p>
      <p>At 9.32am the next day he was released from custody with bail conditions not to visit farmland in the area without being seen by a mental health nurse.</p>
      <p>At around 11am Lewis-Ranwell then hailed a taxi driver to take him to Haldon Hill in Exeter and handed over a 100 Euro note as payment.</p>
      <p>The driver Johnson Joseph said in a statement read to the jury: "He made me feel very scared. He came across as some sort of mental health patient."</p>
      <p>He added that the defendant sat in the passenger seat and asked him where he could buy <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/drugs-1">marijuana</a> .</p>
      <p>The cab driver said he did not know and the pair then shared a journey for about 30 minutes during which the driver said he became increasingly frightened by Lewis-Ranwell's behaviour.</p>
      <p>Lewis-Ranwell, of Croyde, Devon, then grabbed some <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/religion">rosary beads</a> from the mirror and jumped into the back seat behind the driver.</p>
      <p>Johnson Joseph added: "This made me feel very scared as I thought he was going to strangle me with it."</p>
      <p>Just as the car approached the train station in Copplestone they stopped behind a bus. Lewis-Ranwell got out and said he was going to catch the replacement bus service. The driver never saw him again.</p>
      <p>The defendant then arrived at Exeter St David's and came across a run-down property at Bonhay Road owned by Anthony Payne.</p>
      <p>The prosecution say the defendant then picked up a hammer and bludgeoned Payne to death with blows to the head.</p>
      <p>He later beat both brothers to death with blows to the head from a spade.</p>
      <p>The prosecution and defence agree the defendant has a partial defence of diminished responsibility. It means the defendant has some responsibility for what happened.</p>
      <p>The prosecution say Lewis-Ranwell bears some responsibility for what he did. They do not agree he was legally insane at the time of the killings.</p>
      <p>The trial continues.</p>
