      <p>UK pop star Tara McDonald and US-based Indian Amrit Dasu have launched their new single ‘Skeletons’.</p>
      <p>‘Skeletons’ is a catchy urban pop track and will be released by 9122 Records.</p>
      <p>Tara McDonald said, “‘Skeletons’ is a crazy song about a dark past that’s difficult to accept and those skeletons in the closet want to break free. Working with Dasu has been such an incredible experience, I’m really proud to collaborate with him. His performance &amp; song-writing gives the record a R&amp;B swag. It feels more like a duet than a feature which I love. It’s the first time I’ve collaborated with an Indian artist which has been a dream of mine for a long time as I continue my mission to promote equality through my pop world music album concept.”</p>
      <p>Amrit Dasu, “‘Skeletons’ is a fun song which also has a lot of truth in it. It shows we can talk about things people are scared to speak about in a less dramatic way. I want to thank Tara for let me being part of this exciting project. Her energy is infectious and I loved the whole process of the track coming together. It was quick, instinctive and pretty much organic. I’m looking forward to seeing the fan’s reactions to ‘Skeletons'”.</p>
      <p>Sunil D’Sa, Founder, 9122 Records said, “This is truly a multi-cultural collaboration. English-Irish pop star meets US based Indian who was brought up in Hong Kong. It can’t get any more complicated than this, but the output is ‘Skeletons’ a brilliant urban / pop dance track with a `stuck in your head’ hook. What pleases me most is the coming together of two extremely talented personalities from totally different backgrounds to create such a strong and seamless track. Can’t wait for the fans to hear it!”</p>
      <p>Following the success of her second Latin American collaboration “Money Maker” released earlier this year, which featured multi-platinum Billboard award winners Zion &amp; Lennox Tara now returns with her new single ‘Skeletons’.</p>
      <p>Amrit Dasu a.k.a. ‘DASU’ is a US based singer, songwriter and model of Indian descent. After putting out his music on the internet since 2014, DASU bagged his first major record deal with UMG in 2016. His debut single “Dil Kya Kare (Did I Love You?)” was produced by Rishi Rich and featured Bollywood actress Mallika Sherawat in the music video. He followed up the single with his debut EP `Holding On’ and since then has built a fan following both in India and the US.</p>
