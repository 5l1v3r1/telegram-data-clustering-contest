      <h4>Who is it for?</h4>
      <p>Designed with the modern-day business professional in mind, the HP Elite Dragonfly Notebook is not only lightweight, but it also comes equipped with everything you may need for meetings and conferences on the road. No stone is left unturned with this touchsreen laptop. It functions as a tablet while on a flight with its 360-degree hinge.</p>
      <p>If that's not enough, this notebook comes with gigabit-speed Wi-Fi 6 and optional gigabit-class 4G LTE wireless broadband. This means that you can bring the office with you wherever you go. Exceptional network speeds when adding those last-minute details on your project. This also gives you the ability to change and tweak your pitch to cater to each individual prospect on the fly. If you're working on something private, turn on the HP Sure View Technology to protect your screen from prying eyes.</p>
      <p>Presenting is made easy with the HP Elite Dragonfly as this notebook comes prepared with a 13.3-inch display. It has an impressive 87% screen-to-body ratio. The convertible ability of this laptop allows you to flip your screen into four different modes including laptop for solo work, tablet for quick note taking, tent for sharing content, and media for presenting.</p>
      <p>If your job requires you to engage in conference or video calling, this laptop comes equipped with a high definition camera. If you're concerned about privacy, then you'll be happy to know that the Dragonfly comes with an integrated webcam shutter.</p>
      <h4>What's so special about its design?</h4>
      <p>What makes the design of the HP Elite Dragonfly so memorable is that weighs only 2.2 pounds and features a unique color. The laptop's chassis is made from a single piece of magnesium alloy, which is why it is so light. Meanwhile, the keys are made from rubber and 50% recycled plastic. This allows you to type on the backlit keyboard with minimal noise. No one will even know you're typing.</p>
      <p>The dark blue color scheme uses a water-based paint rather than lead-based paint. Blue is known to represent responsibiltiy, security, and dependability. It is actually one of the most trusted colors in the world. What a great way to get your leads to subconciously trust you before you even begin your presentation.</p>
      <p>The HP Elite Dragonfly has weathered shock tests, vibration tests, and drop tests, securing it a MIL-STD 810G military-standard rating.</p>
      <h4>What's under the hood?</h4>
      <p>In terms of connectivity, the Dragonfly supports HDMI and comes equipped with two USB-C Thunderbolt ports as well as a USB-A port. This gives you variety and ensures that you stay relevant and compatible with what your potential leads and clients are using.</p>
      <p>When deciding on a processor, you have a choice between a quad-core 8th Generation Intel Core i5 or an i7. Both ensure that your applications are working at rapid speeds when you're on the road or during board meetings.</p>
      <p>This device comes prepared for long days with its HP Long Life 4-cell battery. This battery is compatible with HP's Fast Charge Technology and can be charged to 50 percent after only 30 minutes. A fully-charged battery will last you 24 hours. This feature alone makes the HP Elite Dragonfly great for travel.</p>
      <p>There are three different display options to choose from including Full High Definition at 400 nits, Ultra High Definition at 550 nits, and HP Sure View at 1000 nits for privacy.</p>
