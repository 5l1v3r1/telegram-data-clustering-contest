        <b>Libertarian: Sacha Baron Cohen vs. Free Speech</b>
      </p>
      <p>At an Anti-Defamation League summit Thursday, comedian Sacha Baron Cohen blasted Facebook for running “any ‘political’ ad you want, even if it’s a lie.” That’s rich for a man who has “literally made a career out of duping people,” <a href="https://reason.com/2019/11/22/sacha-baron-cohen-adl-facebook-hate-zuckerberg/">gibes Reason’s Robby Soave</a> — and “particularly silly.” Sure, “horrible people can say things that are evil and false” on the Internet, but Cohen’s claim that “hate crimes are surging,” an “oft-expressed fear by progressives,” just “isn’t actually supported by the <a href="https://reason.com/2019/08/26/trump-rally-hate-crime-226-percent-increase/">available evidence</a>.” In fact, we have “more protections for free speech, more ways to express ourselves than ever before and if anything, less violence.” So much for what Cohen called “the greatest propaganda machine in history.”</p>

        <b>2020 watch: Dem Race Shifts to … Race</b>
      </p>
      <p>“The late stages of the Democratic primary have taken an abrupt turn,” <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/25/race-identity-democrats-2020-electability-072959">report Politico’s David Siders, Christopher Cadelago and Laura Barrón-López</a>: “Suddenly, a contest that has been largely defined by ideology is being reframed around questions of race and identity.” The camps of ­Kamala Harris, Cory Booker and Julián Castro are sounding “alarms about whether any other candidate can beat Trump” and taking “their campaigns in a more race-conscious direction.” Bernie Sanders and Liz Warren are also pushing for minority support, trying to break Joe Biden’s “commanding lead with black voters,” while Amy Klobuchar just “offered the campaign’s sharpest critique to date of sexism.” Bizarrely, “it’s as though Democrats just now realized that the primary’s four front-runners are all white, and that three are men.”</p>

        <b>Leftist: The Insufficiently Radical Liz Warren</b>
      </p>
      <p>“From the beginning, there were good reasons for progressive leftists not to trust that Elizabeth Warren was on their side,” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/24/elizabeth-warren-not-progressive">claims Nathan Robinson in The Guardian</a>, even if she has “unveiled a series of ambitious social-policy plans designed to please leftists.” Now, though, progressives “no longer need to wonder whether she’s with us or not. She’s not.” While Warren claims to champion single-payer health care, she has now said it won’t “be one of her primary initiatives” — an admission, says Robinson, that she doesn’t intend to pass it, after all. “So much for big structural change.” Meanwhile, she supports Israel and “sides with Trump” on opposing the socialist ­regime in Venezuela. It all tells progressives she’s “not one of us” — and leftists “should believe her.”</p>

        <b>Foreign desk: End Endless Wars To Stop China</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/end-forever-wars-and-face-chinas-threat-11574634656">In The Wall Street Journal, Sen. Josh Hawley decries</a> what America’s post-Cold War strategy has wrought: “the longest war in American history, in Afghanistan; trillions of American dollars expended on failed nation-building; exhaustion at home; aimlessness abroad; and a newly dangerous world.” The calamitous outcome calls for a “new departure” focused on preventing “any one nation” from “dominating or dictating to us in any key region of the globe.” That means, foremost, checking the Chinese Communist Party’s relentless drive toward regional hegemony and global economic dominance. “The Asia-Pacific is critical to the prosperity of American farmers, manufacturers and consumers,” Hawley warns. “We can’t afford to be shut out in the years to come, nor can we afford to be ­reduced to begging Beijing for terms.” The answer: End the “forever wars” in the Middle East, and press European allies to do more to defend themselves, so Washington can focus more determinedly on resisting Beijing.</p>

        <b>Culture critic: Enough With the Podcasts</b>
      </p>
      <p>Podcasts, <a href="https://spectator.us/pod-delusion/">snarks Matt Labash at The Spectator</a>, have “turned the country into such a nonstop jibber-jabbering wind tunnel that there are more than 700,000 active podcasts (or one per every 471 Americans).” Among the horrors: “Every other podcaster thinks he needs to sound like Ira Glass on ‘This American Life.’ ” Plus, “everyone who’s already had his say feels the compulsion to say more and more.” Do we really need a Rudy Giuliani impeachment podcast? “Just because technology makes it easy for anyone to have his say doesn’t mean that the people who have something worth saying couldn’t fit in a midsize sedan.”</p>
