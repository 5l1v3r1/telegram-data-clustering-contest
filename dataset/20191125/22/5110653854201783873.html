      <h1>NFL Draft order 2020: Can Dolphins or Giants steal the No. 1 pick from Bengals?</h1>

      <p>The Bengals have built what could be an insurmountable lead in the race to earn the No. 1 overall pick in the 2020 NFL Draft.</p>
      <p>Cincinnati fans who are picturing LSU quarterback Joe Burrow in orange and black can thank Pittsburgh for <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/steelers-mason-rudolph-benched-bengals/lvkrl8n6n3zx1oqrpkc16urr1">its benching</a> of struggling quarterback Mason Rudolph on Sunday, as the move led to the Steelers' game-winning touchdown in the second half of their Week 12 game. Now the Bengals, still winless at 0-11, have a two-game "lead" over the 2-9 Giants for the No. 1 pick.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The Giants, of course, don't need a quarterback in next year's draft, but that doesn't mean New York shouldn't welcome the second overall pick. General manager Dave Gettleman surely saw what Ohio State pass-rusher Chase Young <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/ncaa-football/news/chase-young-heisman-campaign/c63iyifx1t6d1185f4fxpebkn">did to Penn State on Saturday</a>.</p>
      <p>In other developments based on Sunday's NFL results, the Jets' slide down the draft board continued with their third straight win. The Dolphins, Broncos, Falcons and Lions moved up with their losses. The Redskins — and more importantly, Dwayne Haskins — pushed themselves away from top quarterback territory with their victory.</p>
      <p>Below is the updated NFL Draft order for 2020 through theSundaygames of Week 12.</p>

      <p>In Sporting News' <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/nfl-mock-draft-2020-giants-chase-young-jets-jerry-jeudy/13bp2qa0w3g771ugrwgmvtsbx6">latest NFL mock draft</a> for 2020, the Bengals indeed land Burrow with the No. 1 overall pick. "Coach Zac Taylor will see some Jared Goff qualities in Burrow as a traditional passer, but Burrow is better than that with his athleticism," SN's Vinnie Iyer writes. "He, and not Ryan Finley, should be the long-term replacement for Andy Dalton."</p>
      <p>The Giants, who were still slotted at No. 3 when SN's latest mock draft was released, land Young to boost their pass rush. There's no reason to think they'd go elsewhere with the No. 2 overall pick.</p>
      <p>If their place in the order were to stick, and if the Bengals were to select Burrow, the Dolphins at No. 3 overall would have their choice of the quarterbacks, from Oregon's Justin Herbert to Oklahoma's Jalen Hurts to, perhaps, Alabama's Tua Tagovailoa.</p>
