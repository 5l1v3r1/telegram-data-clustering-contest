      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T22:31:27+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 22:31</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/express-news-service/" target="_blank">Express News Service</a></address>
      <p>Taking note of the poor condition of the beach and the encroachment in the area, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has appointed a contractor for the beautification project of Mahim beach. The project will be completed in the next six months or by March 2020.</p>
      <p>Officials from the civic body said the Mahim beach (Retibundar) area was in poor shape since it was either encroached upon or had become an illegal dump for debris. They said the lack of security had also led to a rise in crime and anti-social activities in the area.</p>
      <p>The project will entail cleaning up of the entire beach along with repair work of existing structures and development of gardens.</p>
      <p>A BMC official said, “The Mahim beach is surrounded by several illegal shanties and a dilapidated wall of the Mahim police colony. Debris is being illegally dumped there and bamboo shops leased by the Mumbai Maritime Board have encroached upon other parts of the beach. We have proposed to clear the encroachment and put everything in order. The beautification includes creating a garden near the beach, repair work of the police colony wall, removing illegal shanties and encroachment of bamboo shops. This will give Mahim beach a new lease of life.”</p>
      <p>The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation will spend Rs 3.57 crore on the project. A proposal will be tabled before the Standing Committee meeting for the final nod on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The official added, “We will also repair a shed constructed to protect visitors from sunlight. And lay sand on parts of the beach wiped out by illegal dumping of debris.”</p>
      <p>“The contractor will prepare a detailed plan and design for the project. We have proposed to finish the work either in six months or by March 31, 2020,” a BMC official said.</p>
