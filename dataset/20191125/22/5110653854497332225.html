      <p>When the Ravens (8-2) travel to face the Rams (6-4) on "<a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/monday-night-football-tonight-time-tv-channel-schedule-week-12/1ra48lpyy82lm1w2rv7rvl5m4i">Monday Night Football</a>" (8:15 p.m. ESPN) to close Week 12 of the 2019 NFL schedule, there will be a lot of interconference implications.</p>
      <p>While Baltimore tries to keep pace with New England, which it beat, for the top seed in the AFC playoffs, Los Angeles will try to get closer to Seattle (9-2) and Minnesota(8-3) — who play each other in Week 13 — and back into tne NFC wild-card playoff race.</p>
      <p>Lamar Jackson has been an unstoppable MVP-caliber force of late quarterbacking forthe Ravens. Rams' marquee defenders Aaron Donald and Jalen Ramsey will be charged with slowing him down as a runner and passer.</p>

      <h3>Ravens vs. Rams odds for 'Monday Night Football'</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Spread:</b> Ravens by 3.5</li>
        <li><b>Point total:</b> 47</li>
        <li><b>Odds:</b> <a href="http://www.sportsbookreview.com/betting-odds/nfl-football/?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=sportingnews.com&amp;utm_campaign=sporting%20news&amp;utm_content=article&amp;utm_term=nfl%20odds">Ravens -100, Rams -110</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Ravens are mild road favorites and would be about touchdown favorites had this game been played in Baltimore. They have beaten the Seahawks, Patriots and Texans this season. The Rams' biggest win came way back in Week 2 against the Saints.</p>
      <h3>Ravens vs. Rams all-time series</h3>
      <p>The Ravens lead the limited series 4-2. They have won three straight dating back to '07. The Rams last won at home in St. Louis in '03. When they beat the Ravens in '99, it was on route to a Super Bowl championship. The Ravens returned the favor in the '11 season.</p>

      </p>
      <h3>Three trends to know</h3>
      <p>— 63 percent of spread bettors are going with the Ravens. 53 percent of bettors are also with the Ravens.</p>
      <p>— 54 percent of bettors like the total to go over the medium total despite two very good defenses being on the field.</p>
      <p>— The Ravens are 5-4-1 against the spread despite their 8-2 record. The total has gone under in 3 of the Rams' 10 games.</p>
      <h3>Three things to watch</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Cooper Kupp vs. Marlon Humphrey</b>
      </p>
      <p>For Rams quarterback Jared Goff, the struggle has been real. The big issue is the cooling off of go-to slot wide receiver Cooper Kupp. Although deep threat Brandin Cooks and equally speedy outside possession man will return to help Kupp get more favorable coverage, that won't happen in this game with coverage ace Humphrey drawing Kupp inside. The Steelers took Kupp out of the game with Minkah Fitzpatrick and others. Humphrey is capable of doing the same for the Ravens.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Marcus Peters revenge game</b>
      </p>
      <p>Peters was traded from the Rams to the Ravens before the midseason deadline. The Rams improved at cornerback with Jalen Ramsey, but Peters' ballhawking has been a better fitwith Humphrey and fellow outside cornerback Jimmy Smith. Between Peters, Humphrey and Smith, the Ravens can slow down Cooks, Kupp and Woods. Peters will know Goff's tendencies and will be looking to jump one of his routes for a big interception.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Donald vs. the Ravens' offensive line</b>
      </p>
      <p>Baltimore has been very good at moving bodies out of the way for Jackson, Mark Ingram and Gus Edwards in the power rushing attack. If the Ravens can neutralize him, they will be able to execute their normal offense at a high level.</p>
      <h3>Stat that matters</h3>
      <p>The Rams have the No. 4 rushing defense in the NFL, allowing on average 89.1 yards per game at only 3.3 yards per carry. The Ravens have the No. 7 run defense, allowing 94.3 yards per game at 4.4 yards per carry. The Rams have the No. 16 pass defense, while the Ravens have the No. 17 pass defense. The team that is able to set up big plays in the passing game, fighting through with the strongest situational rushing, will win.</p>
      <h3>Ravens vs. Rams prediction</h3>
      <p>The Rams will go with a run-heavy game plan again with Todd Gurley to avoid throwing Goff into the fire against a deep secondary and revamped pass rush. That also will serve to be ball control to keep it out of the hands of Jackson. But in the end, Jackson is the more effective passer than Goff at the moment and it will show up in crucial moments as Baltimore uses its tight ends better than Los Angeles does in a one-possession game.</p>
