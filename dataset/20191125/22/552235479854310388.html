      <h1>Daniel Stendel free to join Hearts as Jambos could snap him up for nothing</h1>
      <h2>It had been reported that the German had been placed on gardening leave by former club Barnsley.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T22:30:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">Ross Pilcher, Fraser Wilson, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/ross-pilcher/, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/fraser-wilson/</a></address>
      <p>Hearts can grab managerial target Daniel Stendel for free right now after the German’s contract at Barnsley ended.</p>
      <p>But the Jambos face a fight if they want to land the German as he is considering a return to his homeland among other options.</p>
      <p>Stendel’s preference is to take another job in England but he is open to a <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scottish-premiership">Scottish Premiership</a> move and held talks with Hearts at the weekend.</p>
      <p>It has been reported Stendel remains under contract at Barnsley and has been placed on gardening leave.</p>
      <p>But <i><b>Record Sport</b> </i>understands this is not the case and he is free to take a job elsewhere immediately.</p>
      <p>It’s believed Stendel’s preference is to remain in England, where his stock remains high after guiding Barnsley to promotion from League One in his first season. Stendel had been linked with the Sunderland job after Jack Ross’ sacking.</p>
      <p>The 45-year-old is also considering a return to his homeland, while exploring the Dutch, French and Scottish markets as well.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hearts-fc">Hearts</a> are ramping up their hunt for a new boss almost a month after Craig Levein was sacked.</p>
      <p>But fans are growing increasingly frustrated at the length of time it is taking <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/ann-budge">Ann Budge</a> and her board to appoint a new man.</p>
      <p>Caretaker <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/austin-macphee">Austin MacPhee</a> has overseen the three games since Levein’s sacking but Saturday’s 3-0 thumping at Kilmarnock saw the Tynecastle outfit slip back to level on points with bottom side St Johnstone.</p>
      <p>MacPhee is due to meet with Budge this week to discuss the management situation at the club, as well as the hunt for a sporting director.</p>
      <p>Stendel is bookies’ favourite to replace Levein. Stuart McCall is among the frontrunners and was interviewed a fortnight ago along with ex-Birmingham boss Steve Cotterill, ex-Jambos hero Neil McCann and former West Brom manager Alan Irvine.</p>

      <p>Stendel led Barnsley to second place in League One last season but was bulleted at the start of October after a run of 10 Championship games without a win.</p>
      <p>He cut his teeth in management with Hannover 96, where he had spent seven years as a player, suffering relegation but instant promotion back to the Bundesliga in 2016.</p>
      <p>Rumours also surfaced over the weekend that Alex McLeish was a contender, but the former Scotland and Rangers boss is not in the running.</p>
