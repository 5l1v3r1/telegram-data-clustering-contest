      <p>A pregnant woman was fatally stabbed outside her California home last week in what police are calling a “random act of violence,” a report said.</p>
      <p>Garrett Christopher Scheff, 43, is accused of knifing Mariana Jurado, 26, in South Salinas as she was heading to work at about 9:15 a.m. last Tuesday, <a href="https://www.thecalifornian.com/story/news/2019/11/19/stabbing-reported-south-salinas-police-investigating-california-attack-knife/4241687002/">according to The Californian</a>, citing police.</p>
      <p>Jurado was found with multiple stab wounds and died shortly after at a nearby hospital.</p>
      <p>Scheff, who has a lengthy rap sheet, was arrested a block away from the scene. He’s facing a first-degree murder charge.</p>
      <p>Salinas Police Department Cmdr. John Murray called the stabbing “a tragic and senseless crime,” in a statement to the paper.</p>
      <p>The department said Scheff and Jurado didn’t know each other.</p>
      <p>Scheff is being held on $1 million bail at the Monterey County Jail. He’s expected to be arraigned on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>In 2015, Scheff’s last criminal case, he was deemed mentally unfit to stand trial, The Californian reported, citing court records.</p>
