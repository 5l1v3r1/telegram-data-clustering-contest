      <h1>Fermilab Cosmologist Dr. Dan Hooper – TMO Background Mode Interview</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T22:39:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 22:39</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.macobserver.com/author/john-martellaro/" target="_blank">John Martellaro</a></address>
      <p>Dr. Dan Hooper is a Senior Scientist and the Head of the Theoretical Astrophysics Group at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Illinois. He is also a Professor in the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics at the University of Chicago. He holds a Ph.D. in physics from the University of Wisconsin.</p>
      <p>Dan told me about how his early aspirations as a youth were actually in music. It wasn’t until he took a class as an undergraduate in Relativity that the astrophysics bug bit him. Hard. Dan explained how he landed a post-doc position at Oxford and how he was later hired at Fermilab. Later, we chatted about his interest in the interface between particle physics and cosmology, Dark Matter and what neutrinos can tell us about the early universe. We finished with an overview of his new astrophysics book that explores the mysteries of the origin of the universe.</p>
