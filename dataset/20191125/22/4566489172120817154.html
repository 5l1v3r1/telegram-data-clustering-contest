      <p>An iconic US company with a storied history, the jeweler Tiffany agreed Monday to be acquired by French luxury giant LVMH for $16.2 billion.</p>
      <p>Upon sealing the deal, LVMH chief Bernard Arnault called Tiffany itself a "jewel" and vowed to bestow it with "the same dedication and commitment" that the company had applied to all its businesses.</p>
      <p>- Birth and evolution -</p>
      <p>The company's story dates back to 1837 when founder Charles Lewis Tiffany opened a store on Broadway in New York that sold stationary, handkerchiefs and other finery.</p>
      <p>Over the next decade or so, the company shifted to jewelry, especially in 1848 through acquisitions of top European collections, including diamonds worn by Marie-Antoinette.</p>
      <p>In 1850, Tiffany opened a store in Paris at rue de Richelieu, which was followed by a London store in 1868 and a watch factory in Geneva a few years later.</p>
      <p>The company flourished further when Charles' son, Louis Comfort Tiffany -- a painter, born in 1848 -- moved into glassmaking as the medium was enjoying a major renaissance in France, English and Italy.</p>
      <p>Works by Louis Tiffany included lamps and stained glass that became synonymous with the "Gilded Age" in America at the end of the 19th century.</p>
      <p>Some of Tiffany's work was event installed in the White House, but it was removed early in the 20th century.</p>
      <p>Tiffany is "an American icon that is becoming a bit French. It has a lot of potential and an amazing history," Arnault said.</p>
      <p>- Fifth Avenue store -</p>
      <p>Tiffany's rise also parallels New York's ascent and the company in 1940 opened a luxury store on Fifth Avenue.</p>
      <p>The store is still very much a destination in the upscale New York shopping hub, with its robin blue logo attracting tourists from around the US and the world.</p>
      <p>The shop's list of clients have included the Kennedys, Richard Nixon, Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton.</p>
      <p>The New York store is also home to the famous Tiffany Yellow diamond, a giant stone discovered in 1878.</p>
      <p>The store was immortalized in the 1961 movie, "Breakfast at Tiffany's" which features Audrey Hepburn in perhaps her most famous part and the luminous song, "Moon River."</p>
      <p>- 300 stores worldwide -</p>
      <p>Tiffany's flagship store on Fifth Avenue, next to Trump Tower, accounts for almost 10 percent of the company's overall sales, with the rest coming from more than 300 stores worldwide.</p>
      <p>The Americas account for 44 percent of Tiffany's sales, followed by Asia, excluding Japan, with 28 percent, Japan with 15 percent and Europe with 11 percent, according to company figures.</p>
      <p>Tiffany last year reported $586 million in profits on $4.4 billion in sales.</p>
