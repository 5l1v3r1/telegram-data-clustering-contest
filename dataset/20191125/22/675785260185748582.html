      <h1>I'm A Celebrity host Dec blames James Haskell for failing 'impossible' trial</h1>
      <h2>I'm A Celebrity host Dec Donnelly said James Haskell chose the wrong box to start with in the live trial</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T22:59:14+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 22:59</time> by <a rel="author">Charlotte Tutton</a></address>
      <p>I'm A Celebrity host Dec Donnelly stood by his claim that the "impossible" live Bushtucker Trial was doable, as he appeared to blame contestant James Haskell for messing up.</p>
      <p>James and campmate Roman Kemp had to retrieve three stars screwed down in three boxes, all containing different creatures.</p>
      <p>Unable to complete the challenge in the set amount of time, it meant Ian Wright, Cliff Parisi and Andy Whyment did not get a roast dinner.</p>
      <p>Viewers hit out at the show, with Ant and Dec also receiving a backlash from fans who claimed the task and result was unfair.</p>
      <p>They believed the challenge was "impossible", something the hosts denied given the stand-ins managed to complete it during the rehearsals.</p>

      <p>Ant and Dec even mocked the backlash in a sketch during the latest episode.</p>
      <p>Speaking on spin-off series Extra Camp though, Dec repeated that the trial was possible, before suggesting it was the campmates' fault for not being successfull.</p>
      <p>Ant joked it was down to James' "sausage fingers" for not finishing the task, while Dec implied his technique was to blame.</p>

      <p>Dec said: "As I said on social media it was done in the block through, and rehearsal. The stand-ins did it.</p>
      <p>"It was able to be completed."</p>
      <p>He then quipped: "Why he started with the crab which is the hardest box and the furthest one away, I don't know."</p>

      <p>Ant then joked: "It's cos he's got sausage fingers."</p>
      <p>Viewers were still convinced that the challenge was "unfair", and that it wasn't James or Roman's fault they didn't complete their challenge.</p>
      <p>Fans called for Ian, Cliff and Andy to still get their roast dinners, as others said the trial was a "fix".</p>
      <p>Caitlyn ended up smuggling some food into camp for Ian, with Ant hinting the pair would be punished.</p>
