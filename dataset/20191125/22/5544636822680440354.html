      <p>President Muhammadu Buhari has warned governors under the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) that under-performance would not be accepted.</p>
      <p>He, therefore, called on them to use all resources at their disposal for the benefit of Nigerians.</p>
      <p>Buhari spoke on Monday in Jos, Plateau State at the third Federal Government/Progressives Governors Forum’s parley on “Strengthening Public Service Delivery.”</p>
      <p>He said: “Early in 2019, Nigeria overwhelmingly re-elected me as President. That election was a referendum on not just my leadership but also on our party.</p>
      <p>“Some State Governors were re-elected while new ones also came on board.”</p>
      <p>According to him, “To whom much is given, much more is expected. It is therefore incumbent on this to meet the expectations of our teeming population.</p>
      <p>“There should be no room for excuses and that is where the outcome of this parley becomes very critical.”</p>
