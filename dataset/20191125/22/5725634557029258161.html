      <h1>Canadian Dividend All-Stars Expected To Announce Dividend Increases - Week Of Nov. 25</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T22:40:50+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 22:40</time> by <a rel="author">Mat Litalien</a></address>
      <p>Summary</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Canadian Dividend All-Stars are companies that have raised dividends for at least five consecutive years.</li>
        <li>Boyd Group Income Fund came through with an as expected raise.</li>
        <li>Magellan Aerospace raise was significantly lower than expected and its prospects aren't enticing.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It is the calm before the storm. Although there are no Canadian Dividend <a href="https://www.dividendgrowthinvestingandretirement.com/canadian-dividend-all-star-list/">All-Stars</a> expected to raise dividends, the majority of banks begin to report next week and we should see several dividend increases. It has been a couple of weeks since the last update, and I figured it best to get everyone caught up before the banks start to report.</p>
      <p>Of note, all figures are in Canadian dollars unless otherwise noted.</p>

          <b>Last Week – Results</b>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>The last couple of weeks unfolded with little fanfare. The lone All-Star expected to announce a dividend increase - <b>Boyd Group Income Fund (<a href="http://byd.CA/">BYD.CA</a>)[TSX:BYD.UN] </b>- didn’t disappoint. Likewise, I received some clarification on<b> Magellan Aerospace (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MALJF">OTCPK:MALJF</a>)[TSX:MAL], </b>which did in fact announce a raise in the week it was expected.</p>

      <p>Let’s start with Boyd Group Income Fund which raised inline with expectations. As <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4302237-canadian-dividend-stars-expected-announce-dividend-increases-week-nov-4">discussed previously</a>, Boyd isn’t going to impress anyone with its 0.28% yield which is the lowest among all Canadian Dividend All-Stars. The company raised dividends by $0.001 per share or 2.2% for a new monthly dividend of $0.046 per share.</p>
      <p>What it lacks in yield however, it more than makes up in capital appreciation. To put its performance into perspective, have a peak at its 10-year chart as compared to the some of the hottest stocks of the past decade:</p>

      </p>
      <p>No, you eyes are not deceiving you - Boyd Group has outperformed the likes of Amazon (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN">AMZN</a>), Apple (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL">AAPL</a>) and Netflix (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NFLX">NFLX</a>). Who said consumer cyclical stocks were boring?</p>
      <p>I think it is safe to say that shareholders are in great hands and that the company as effectively deployed its cash. Management has done a phenomenal job of turning Boyd Group into a leading industry consolidator.</p>
      <p>Next, let’s take a deeper look at Magellan Aerospace. I searched high and low for any information on Magellan’s dividend announcement and came up blank. Turns out, it was announced after the market close on Friday which was after I had submitted my article for the week.</p>
      <p>The company announced a 5% dividend increase, which was much lower than expected. The company had a history of raising dividends in the high-teens, and last year it raised by 17%. I thought I was being conservative with my 15% estimate considering it had a low payout ratio (25%).</p>
      <p>It was however, a disappointing third quarter. Revenue jumped by only 4%, and EPS dropped by 15.6% which missed estimates by 4 cents. The market didn’t react too kindly to earnings as its share price dropped by 3.6% the day after it released earnings.</p>
      <p>Outside of an uptick in revenu, it was red across the board. The reduced profit was a result of <i>“lower production volumes on certain programs, production inefficiencies and higher manufacturing costs”</i>. That isn’t exactly a sentence that instills confidence.</p>
      <p>At the time of writing, Magellan is trading at what looks to be an attractive 11.80 times earnings. However, earnings are only expected to grow in the low single-digits on average through 2022. As you can see in looking at the F.A.S.T. Graph below, Magellan has been trading inline with its historical P/E ratio since about 2013. It dipped below the average in 2016-17, but considering it was reporting negative earnings growth, this isn’t all that surprising.</p>

      <p>Likewise, the company doesn’t exactly have a stellar reputation of meeting estimates. Take a look at this chart:</p>
      <figure>

      </p>
      <p>Taking all this into account, the company appears to be fairly valued. Although the company is one of the few TSX-listed aerospace companies, don’t expect out-sized returns. Over the past five years, its share price has averaged low, single digit returns. It doesn’t look any better over the next couple of years.</p>
