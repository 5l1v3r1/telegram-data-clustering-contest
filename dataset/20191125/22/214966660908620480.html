      <h1>Gold Coast loses major event to Brisbane due to ‘the threat of smoke’ </h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T22:44:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 22:44</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.mygc.com.au/author/mstclair/" target="_blank">Monique StClair</a></address>
      <p>The Gold Coast has had a big boxing match pulled out from under us, and moved up the M1 to Brisbane instead.</p>
      <p>Anthony Mundine and John Wayne Parr were set to go head to head this Saturday at Cbus Stadium in Robina.</p>
      <p>Though the event promoter took to Instagram yesterday to announce the match will now be held at the Brisbane Convention Centre.</p>
      <p>DDP Sports Management says ‘the threat of further smoke pollution down the Gold Coast’ was the deciding factor.</p>
      <p>“A decision was made considering the health and well being for both fighters and spectators,” the post reads.</p>
      <p>“All tickets remain valid and can be used at the Brisbane Convention Centre.</p>
      <p>“Most importantly, WE HAVE A FIGHT,” the post finishes.</p>
      <p>John Wayne Parr also shared the news to his social media, saying he’s devastated with the move away from his hometown.</p>
      <p>“Personally I’m guttered. I wanted to fight at Cbus sooo bad for that one last walkout.</p>
      <p>“I’ll have to try and make the night special in another way to make it rememberable,” his post reads.</p>
      <p>While Anthony Mundine’s taken a swipe at the state government for not doing more to keep the match on the Gold Coast.</p>
