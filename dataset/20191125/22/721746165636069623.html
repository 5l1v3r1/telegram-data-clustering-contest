      <h1>Swain is the next champion to get the Hextech treatment</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T22:28:35+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 22:28</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.polygon.com/users/Julia%20Lee" target="_blank">Julia Lee</a></address>
      <p>Swain is next on the list of <i>League of Legends</i> champions to get a crafting-exclusive Hextech skin.</p>
      <p>As with other crafting-based skins, Hextech Swain will be available for 10 Gemstones. Lucky players will also be able to roll it directly out of loot boxes. If rolled out of a box, it will unlock automatically. (You won’t have to use any Orange Essence to activate it.)</p>
      <p>His model is rocking the usual blue, purple, and gold color scheme we see in Hextech skins, but unlike the other skins, he hasn’t been completely turned into a robot. This opens up a lot of possibilities. Is he just a cyborg? Did he help make the other Hextech skins? Maybe he’s in charge of the whole operation?</p>

      <p>If you’re a Swain main, you better start saving up your Gemstones now or pray that you get lucky.</p>
      <p>This is Swain’s fifth skin, with his last being Dragon Master Swain in Feb. 2018.</p>
