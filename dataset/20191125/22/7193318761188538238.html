      <p>As friends and family gathered at a Northeast Oklahoma City church to mourn the loss of a teen killed in a shooting earlier this month, his funeral procession was interrupted by gunfire.</p>
      <p>Oklahoma City Police Department responded to a call of shots fired at New Zion Baptist Church, near the corner of NE 28th and Kelley on Monday just after 12:20 p.m.</p>
      <p>Two people, a man and a woman, were shot outside the church after an argument boiled over between the man and another man. Police suspect the shooting was gang related.</p>
      <p>The victims' names were not released by Emergency Medical Services Authority, which transported both to OU Medical Center, one as an emergency patient, the other as a non-emergency patient.</p>
      <p>Police began a pursuit of a red car they believed was involved in the shooting.</p>
      <p>Terrance Britton, 20, was arrested following a pursuit. His car came to to a stop in the middle of the westbound lane of NE 23rd Street, about three blocks west of the state Capitol. Traffic was blocked in the westbound lane for less than 10 minutes while police took Britton into custody.</p>
      <p>Britton was arrested on two complaints of assault with a deadly weapon and one complaint of attempting to elude police.</p>
      <p>A crowd stood near the church waiting outside the yellow caution tape as police interviewed witnesses and crime scene investigators combed the parking lot for evidence.</p>
      <p>Mourners were there to pay their respects to Donyea Robinson, an 18-year old Del City man who was killed two weeks ago in a shooting. Robinson was caught in the crossfire between two cars and shot in head.</p>
      <p>Oklahoma City Police Maj. Dexter Nelson said police had a unit on standby at the funeral for fear of possible violence or gang-related retaliation.</p>
      <p>"We had received some intel about his funeral earlier," Nelson said. "We did have some gang-related activity here that resulted in the shooting."</p>
      <p>No arrests have been made in Robinson's murder.</p>
      <p>Pauline Hill, 36, paced around her car shaking her head. Hill, who was wearing a bright yellow hooded sweatshirt with pictures of Robinson on it, said she had been talking with the male victim just seconds before the shooting began.</p>
      <p>Hill said the male victim was arguing with a man in his car when his mother intervened and tried to break up the fight. That's when she heard six gunshots and saw a red car tear out of the parking lot.</p>
      <p>"These kids are always beefing about something," Hill said. "I always try and tell them it's not worth shooting each other over. It's not worth all this, look at all the people dying.</p>
      <p>"They just don't listen."</p>
      <p>The shooting happened across the street from Classen School of Advanced Studies at Northeast, but students are gone for the week due to Thanksgiving break.</p>
