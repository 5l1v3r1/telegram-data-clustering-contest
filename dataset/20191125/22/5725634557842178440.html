      <p>Summary</p>
      <ul>

        <li>Lamar increased same-unit revenue by almost 7% last quarter.</li>
        <li>The stock is trading in a bullish pattern for the near term.</li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>Start where you are. Use what you have. Do what you can. - Arthur Ashe</blockquote>
      <p>We are all familiar with the big billboard advertisements alongside our highways or the advertisements on the side of a bus or taxi. And anyone who was an adult from the 90s can remember that opening scene in Sex and the City when the bus, with the picture of Carrie Bradshaw on the side of it, drives through a puddle and splashes Carrie or the Chick-Fil-A billboards with cows writing messages about eating chicken. It is ads like these, that Lamar Advertising Company (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LAMR">LAMR</a>) makes their money on, also known as out-of-home (OOH) advertising. Lamar Advertising Company is a real estate investment trust that leases these spaces to advertisers. LAMR is involved in the ads from soup to nuts. Not only do they own the right to lease the space, but they also make, place, and maintain the advertisement. OOH is a growing segment of advertising given its visibility and lack of ability to block it out of your life, unlike most digital advertising.</p>
      <p>Even though the REIT sector is facing some difficulties, there are always some diamonds buried beneath a weak sector. As acknowledged in the Lead-Lag Report, REITs are facing headwinds with rising Treasury yields. The yield spread between the 10-year Treasury and Real Estate Select Sector SPDR Fund (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XLRE">XLRE</a>) had shrunk by 55 basis points in just over 2 months. So, while the broad sector is struggling, Lamar appears to have some strong technical signals.</p>

      <p>In the middle of October, LAMR's 50-day and 200-day moving averages came extremely close to crossing, but they have since separated and moved upward. The stock is trading above both averages which is a strong sign. Its Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) crossed above its signal line on November 15 and has stayed in positive territory, which is also bullish for the stock. Plus, volume points to an accumulation phase since it is greater on positive days than negative days.</p>
      <p>Lamar is not widely covered by the investment analyst world. There is currently 1 buy, 5 hold, and 2 sell recommendations for it. This gives investors the chance to discover the stock for themselves. Lamar has outshined their closest competitors lately. Outfront Media, which is a close competitor in the OOH market recently reported earnings below estimates and its stock is declining as a result. The OOH market is very fragmented and could easily see consolidation in the future. Lamar is the largest player with about 23% of advertising revenue, Outfront is close behind with 21%, and Clear Channel has just over 15%, and then there are many smaller competitors.</p>

      <p>Lamar has a strong position because it does not have a heavy debt load, generates free cash flow, and has a strong dividend. In its most recent earnings report, it beat the revenue estimate and was up 9% compared to a year ago. Earnings per share were $0.99 compared to an estimate of $1.06. A better metric to look at since Lamar is a REIT is adjusted funds from operations which were $1.62 per share compared to an estimate of $1.59. These strong numbers were supported by an increase in advertising revenue and most notably the 6.9% increase in revenue from same-unit digital advertising.</p>
      <p>Lamar's future growth is going to come from moving from print to digital billboards and advertising. There is a huge capital outlay needed to make the switch, which will reduce the current free cash flow of $133m. By making the switch, Lamar will be able to reduce the time and manpower needed to change advertisements and, ultimately, increase revenue per unit. Lamar expects to upgrade 350 advertising units by year-end. Lamar could also look to make acquisitions in this space to increase their size to be substantially larger than Outfront Media. This focus on the future is a very positive sign for Lamar and makes the stock worth looking at for investors.</p>
