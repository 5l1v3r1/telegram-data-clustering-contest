      <h1>Aston Villa boss Dean Smith hails 'big win' after comfortable victory over Newcastle</h1>
      <h2>Villa boss Dean Smith hailed an important win against Newcastle as he targets a surge up the compact Premier League table.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T22:41:14+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 22:41</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.expressandstar.com/news/authors/lewis-cox/" target="_blank">Lewis Cox</a></address>
      <p>The hosts eased back to winning ways in the top flight thanks to two first half goals inside four minutes from Conor Hourihane and Anwar El Ghazi.</p>
      <p>Smith's men dominated throughout to inflict more Villa Park misery on Steve Bruce, who made his first return since he was sacked 13 months ago.</p>
      <p>Returning skipper Jack Grealish played a starring role on his return from an injury lay-off, while Hourihane struck one and laid on the second for El Ghazi.</p>
      <p>Just four points now separate 15th-placed Villa from Sheffield United, in sixth.</p>
      <p>Smith said: "It shows how close this league is.</p>
      <p>"It was a big win in terms of the table. What you don't want to see is a gap opening up (above). It puts us in a shout with teams above us.</p>
      <p>"The top four have won nine games, everybody else have won four - other than Burnley with five - it shows how competitive the league is.</p>
      <p>"You can put three results together and be in the top 10 or lose three and be in the bottom five. It's the way it seems this season."</p>
      <p>Villa put some daylight between themselves and the relegation zone with the win, that lifted them up two places to 15th.</p>
      <p>It ended a run of three straight Premier League defeats for Smith's men.</p>
      <p>Both goalscorers Hourihane and El Ghazi were brought to the club by Bruce, who admitted his disappointment at his team's failure to turn up in a costly first period.</p>
      <p>Bruce said: "We weren't good enough on the night, especially first half.</p>
      <p>"All the talk has been about McGinn but I have to tell you for Â£1million Hourihane is not too bad either.</p>
      <p>"Conor with two pieces of magic which we know he's capable of has scored a great goal and the second changed the game."</p>
