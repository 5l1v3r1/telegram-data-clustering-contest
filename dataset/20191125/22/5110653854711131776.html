      <h1>Find Week 13 waiver pickups, fantasy sleepers using snap counts</h1>
      <h2>Fantasy football owners should consider more than targets and carries to find waiver pickups and sleepers for Week 13. Snap counts can help show the true usage a player might get going forward. We have notes for all 32 teams.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T22:29:03+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 22:29</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://twitter.com/billyheyen" target="_blank">@billyheyen</a></address>
      <p>Week 13 of the NFL season means no more bye weeks, so we'll be back and looking at a full 32-team analysis next week. For now, we'll deal with the 26 teams that have already played in Week 12(with two more coming Monday night), as there are plenty of interesting playing time numbersfor fantasy owners to dig into this week. You won't want to make your waiver wire claims or start/sit decisions without first consulting this list.</p>
      <p>Where else could you learn that Kalen Ballage's borderline fantasy relevance might be closing? You might soon have to learn the name Patrick Laird or maybe Myles Gaskin. You can also marvel at the fact that the Panthers haven't done one interesting thing in terms of playing time all season.</p>

      <p>But seriously, there's plenty here. From figuring out where the heck Jonathan Williams came from (or, rather, where the heck did Jordan Wilkins go)to the Lions continuing to provideopportunities to Bo Scarbroughto deciding whether Rashaad Penny the real deal, we have someinput. With Thanksgiving coming up, you might need some of these answers sooner than usual.</p>
      <p>The biggest thing to watch Thursday might be the Atlanta receivers. Julio Jones is dinged up -- he should play -- but he ranked third on the team in WR snaps Sunday and could be in line for a similar workload if Calvin Ridley and Russell Gage continue to play well.</p>

        <b>What to watch coming off bye:</b>
      </p>
      <p>Kenyan Drake's usage relative to David Johnson -- who should be healthier -- along with the health of Chase Edmonds (hamstring).</p>

      <h3>#2<br/>Atlanta Falcons</h3>
      <p><b>WR snaps (out of 87):</b>Calvin Ridley (74), Russell Gage (64), Julio Jones (49), Christian Blake (38), Justin Hardy (15), Olamide Zaccheaus (7)</p>
      <p>Julio is dinged up and Gage saw 10 targets Sunday as a result. With a quick turnaround to Thursday night, Gage is in play as a PPR WR3, especially if Marshon Lattimore (hamstring) is healthy enough to play and take Jones out of the game.</p>
      <p><b>TE snaps (out of 87):</b>Jaeden Graham (57), Luke Stocker (32)</p>
      <p>This flipped from a week ago when Stocker held the edge, as Graham overtook him and held a 25-snap advantage here. Graham had a 53-yard catch right away Sunday, but he was only targeted twice in total compared to Stocker's one.</p>

      <h3>#4<br/>Buffalo Bills</h3>
      <p><b>TE snaps (out of 80):</b>Dawson Knox (62), Tyler Kroft (25), Lee Smith (14)</p>
      <p>With the Bills coming up against a Cowboys' defense vulnerable to tight end production on Thanksgiving, seeing that Knox has dominated Buffalo TE snaps for the second straight week provides us an assurance that if you want a sleeper tight end for Week 12, Knox is a prime candidate.</p>

      <h3>#6<br/>Chicago Bears</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Anthony Miller vs. Taylor Gabriel</b>
      </p>
      <p>Each of these secondary receivers played 42 snaps in Week 12, which is technically a win for Miller over previous weekswhen Gabriel was playing more than him. Miller caught six-of-nine targets, while Gabriel caught one of three. With a Thanksgiving day game with the Lions coming up, Miller looks to be the slightly preferred fantasy option, although a case can still be made for Gabriel in PPR, as prior to Week 12, he'd shown more consistency in receptions.</p>

      <h3>#7<br/>Cincinnati Bengals</h3>
      <p><b>TE snaps (out of 58):</b>C.J. Uzomah (36), Tyler Eifert (22)</p>
      <p>Uzomah has played more than Eifert in each of the past two weeks, something worth noting in deeper leagues as owners may have come to rely on Eifert as a TD-dependent tight end flier.</p>

      <h3>#8<br/>Cleveland Browns</h3>
      <p><b>RB snaps (out of 76):</b>Nick Chubb (43), Kareem Hunt (43), Dontrell Hilliard (3)</p>
      <p>Chubb had led Hunt in snaps each of their first two weeks playing together, but this week, they were dead even. Chubb still got his 21 carries, so there's not much to worry about there, but Hunt did add a season-high eight carries of his own to go with a rushing touchdown. He's becoming more and more of a standard league option, especially in favorable matchups.</p>

      <h3>#9<br/>Dallas Cowboys</h3>
      <p><b>WR snaps (out of 64):</b>Michael Gallup (63), Amari Cooper (52), Randall Cobb (29), Tavon Austin (13)</p>
      <p>Cooper's snaps rose, both in raw total and relative to Cobb, from a week ago. That suggests he's feeling a little healthier, although you never know how his ailments will respond on a short week before playing on Thanksgiving. With Tre'Davious White on tap, Cooper is a worry, but he will be tough to sit.</p>

      <h3>#10<br/>Denver Broncos</h3>
      <p><b>RB snaps (out of 50):</b>Royce Freeman (28), Phillip Lindsay (27), Devontae Booker (3)</p>
      <p>A week after Lindsay got the heavy majority of snaps and was more efficient on a per-touch basis than Freeman, this reverted to the norm of the rest of the season at least in terms of snaps. It terns of touches, Lindsay (14) still dominated Freeman (4) in terms of touches.It's not obvious why Week 11 was all Lindsay or why this week was back to what we'd come to expect. It's just frustrating if it felt like it was finally time to be all-in on Lindsay. Perhaps Denver being in trail mode let to Freeman being on the field more for blocking/scheme purposes, so Lindsday is still the preferred play right now in all formats.</p>

      <h3>#11<br/>Detroit Lions</h3>
      <p><b>RB snaps (out of 75):</b>Bo Scarbrough (38), Ty Johnson (27), J.D. McKissic (11)</p>
      <p>Big Bo's touches tell the best story here, as his 18 carries tell us he's the workhorse. Against the Bears on Thanksgiving, you can proably expect another 15 or so rushes out of the former Alabama back, making him a legit FLEX with RB2 upside.</p>

      <h3>#12<br/>Green Bay Packers</h3>
      <p><b>WR snaps (out of 80):</b>Davante Adams (60), Geronimo Allison (54), Allen Lazard (52), Marquez Valdes-Scantling (30), Jake Kumerow (22)</p>
      <p>The starters were pulled early, but it appears the trend from before Green Bay's bye has continued with Allen Lazard ahead of MVS on the depth chart. Valdes-Scantling did have some appeal heading into this year as a deep threat with big-play potential for fantasy, but that seems like a dream that's passed us by.</p>

      <h3>#13<br/>Houston Texans</h3>
      <p><b>WR snaps (out of 59):</b>DeAndre Hopkins (59), Will Fuller V (53), Kenny Stills (37)</p>
      <p>The Texans only went three WRs deep on Thursday night in Fuller's return from injury. This is about how we expected things to break down, so Fuller can go back to being a boom-or-bust WR3 play each week.</p>

      <h3>#14<br/>Indianapolis Colts</h3>
      <p><b>RB snaps (out of 67):</b>Jonathan Williams (45), Nyheim Hines (22), Jordan Wilkins (1)</p>
      <p>So, I guess we didn't have to be worried about Wilkins. Williams touched the ball on nearly two-thirds of his snaps and will fit in as an RB2 for as long as Marlon Mack is out. Hines saw a season-high nine carries, for what it's worth.</p>

      <h3>#15<br/>Jacksonville Jaguars</h3>
      <p><b>TE snaps (out of 86):</b>Nick O'Leary (45), Ben Koyack (44), Charles Jones (2)</p>
      <p>O'Leary finished with four catches and looks like a usable fantasy option against Tampa Bay in Week 13. The Bucs have been the second-worst defense against tight ends in regards to fantasy points allowed in 2019.</p>

      <p><b>RB snaps (out of 63):</b>Kalen Ballage (24), Patrick Laird (23), Myles Gaskin (16)</p>
      <p>It's taking the Dolphins longer than everyone else, but they're finally realizing that Ballage is bad. This was his lowest usage since Mark Walton's suspension. Laird is more of a pass-catcher than anything, but that would make him interesting in PPR leagues on a team that trails all the time if he can hop over Ballage.</p>

      <p><b>WR snaps (out of 70):</b>Julian Edelman (68), N'Keal Harry (57), Jakobi Meyers (54), Matthew Slater (2)</p>
      <p>The rookies Harry and Meyers will only remain relevant as long as Mohamed Sanu and Phillip Dorsett are out, but maybe we see the slight favoriting here of Harry, who did catch a touchdown Sunday. Meyers dwarfed him in targets, though, seeing nine passes thrown his way.</p>

      <p>For the third straight week, Smith outsnapped Ginn. Smith also found the end zone in this one, although Ginn had more targets, five to three One of the two will probably have a good game on Thanksgiving night against the Falcons, although it's hard to predict which one. If you want the probability play, maybe it's Smith as the guy who's on the field more.</p>

      <p>Apparently the Giants can utilize all three of their top guys at once -- Shepard saw nine targets and Slayton and Tate each had seven passes thrown their way. That leaves them all in FLEX consideration going forward.</p>
      <p>Also worth noting: Tight end Kaden Smith played 59-of-60 snaps and would be in line for potentially decent production against the Packers in Week 13 if Evan Engram (foot)and Rhett Ellison (concussion) remain out.</p>

      <h3>#24<br/>New York Jets</h3>
      <p><b>RB snaps (out of 63):</b>Le'Veon Bell (36), Bilal Powell (15), Ty Montgomery (12), Josh Adams (5)</p>
      <p>This was skewed by the Jets winning this one in a blowout, but Powell was being worked in early enough to wonder whether Bell is indeed fully healthy and/or fully happy.</p>

      <h3>#25<br/>Oakland Raiders</h3>
      <p>Yuck. The Raiders gave up on their starters in the third quarter of this one, so not much insight to be gleaned from Week 12. Zay Jones did lead Oakland's wideouts in snaps, while Josh Jacobs and Jalen Richard played the same amount of snaps. Both of those things might not hold true in a more competitive game. (Although with Hunter Renfrow injured, Jones may maintain a decent-sized role)</p>

      <h3>#26<br/>Philadelphia Eagles</h3>
      <p><b>TE snaps (out of 76):</b>Zach Ertz (66), Dallas Goedert (66)</p>
      <p>Goedert is only a step behind Ertz when it comes to fantasy value at this point. There's nothing wrong with relying on Goedert as a starter in 12-team leagues the rest of the way.</p>

      <p><b>RB snaps (out of 74):</b>Benny Snell Jr. (36), Jaylen Samuels (22), Trey Edmunds (12), Kerrith Whyte (7)</p>
      <p>With no James Conner (shoulder), Snell was the workhorse that received 21 carries, and he'd be the best fantasy option here if Conner were to miss another week.</p>

      <p><b>WR snaps (out of 48):</b>Deebo Samuel (35), Emmanuel Sanders (32), Kendrick Bourne (24), Richie James (13), Dante Pettis (7)</p>
      <p>Because of turnovers, big plays and a blowout, these numbers are almost too small to tell a whole story. But at least it looks like Sanders (ribs) is pretty healthy, or he would've played even less in a lopsided game.</p>

      <h3>#29<br/>Seattle Seahawks</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Josh Gordon watch</b>
      </p>
      <p>Gordon played 22-of-65 snaps, the third-most used WR for Seattle but well off the pace of Tyler Lockett and DKMetcalf. He caught one-of-two targets for 10 yards and can be ignored in fantasy unless an injury happens to one of the top two guys.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Rashaad Penny vs. Chris Carson</b>
      </p>
      <p>Carson had 35 snaps to Penny's 30, and this could turn into a full-on split, which Pete Carroll hinted at on Monday.</p>

      <h3>#30<br/>Tampa Bay Buccaneers</h3>
      <p><b>TE snaps (out of 66):</b>O.J. Howard (51), Cameron Brate (21), Tanner Hudson (6)</p>
      <p>Howard's benching from a week ago was short-lived, as he reclaimed the major role here. It's too bad Winston didn't target Howard like he did Brate a week ago. Howard finished with just one catch on two targets.</p>

      <h3>#31<br/>Tennessee Titans</h3>
      <p><b>WR snaps (out of 53):</b>Corey Davis (39), A.J. Brown (37), Adam Humphries (12), Kalif Raymond (10), Tajae Sharpe (9)</p>
      <p>Davis is obviously back to full health, and with Ryan Tannehill playing pretty well, you can consider both Davis and Brown (who caught another long touchdown) for your FLEX spot on a weekly basis.</p>

      <h3>#32<br/>Washington Redskins</h3>
      <p><b>RB snaps (out of 60):</b>Derrius Guice (26), Adrian Peterson (20), Wendell Smallwood (17)</p>
      <p>Guice and Peterson both received 10 carries and a target, but at least Guice leaped from behind Smallwood to leading the backfield in snaps. AP's usage remainedabout the same while Smallwood's fell off. We should continue to see a slight growth in Guice snaps going forward.</p>
