      <p>Newcastle United legend Alan Shearer has given his verdict following a "poor night" at Aston Villa.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">The Magpies</a> were undone by two set-pieces in the first half at Villa Park on Monday night, and were lucky not to fall further behind in the second half.</p>
      <p>A clever free-kick between Conor Hourihane and Villa skipper Jack Grealish saw the Irishman's whipped effort catch Martin Dubravka out at the near post.</p>
      <p>Minutes later, Hourihane fired in a cross from a similar area to give Anwar El Ghazi a simple tap-in.</p>
      <p>The Magpies raised their intensity after the break, but this spell was short-lived as the hosts quickly regained control.</p>
      <p>Grealish, Hourihane, John McGinn and Wesley all spurned chances to kill the contest off, and United failed to muster anything in response.</p>
      <p>Andy Carroll and Dwight Gayle were thrown on, and while the former won several aerial duels, the visitors did not fashion a real chance to claw back the deficit.</p>
      <p>Magpies' record goalscorer Shearer posted his reaction on the final whistle of the 2-0 defeat, labelling his former side's goal threat as "zero".</p>

      <p>His reaction was echoed by former United full-back Warren Barton, who labelled the match as a "waste of time" for United.</p>
