      <p>President Muhammadu Buhari has said about three thousand Nigerian youths would be trained by his government in N-Power Creative, Concise News reports.</p>
      <p>This news medium understands that Buhari said this over the weekend at the graduation ceremony of Senior Executive Course 41 of the National Institute of Policy and Strategic Studies (NIPSS) in Kuru near Jos.</p>
      <p>He was represented at the event by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo who noted that the present government wants to create jobs for youths with technology.</p>
      <p>Buhari said “the first industrial revolution used water and steam power to mechanize production, the second used electric power to create mass production.</p>
      <p>“The third used electronics and information technology to automate production.</p>
      <p>“Now, a fourth industrial revolution is building on the third, the digital revolution that has been occurring since the middle of the last century.”</p>
      <p>On N-Power Creative, he said: “In its first year, the programme will train 3,000 young Nigerians.</p>
      <p>“1,500 young Nigerians from the South-West, South-South and South-East were in Benin between July and August this year, learning these creative skills.</p>
      <p>“Another 1,500 from the North-East, North-West and North-Central have undertaken a similar exercise.”</p>
      <p>The Nigerian leader added that “These Asian countries are not only cost-competitive but are also high on quality and availability of skills.</p>
      <p>“India, much like Nigeria can be, has honed its attractiveness as an animation hub because it has an English-speaking workforce that comes at low costs.</p>
      <p>“From industry reports, the average monthly salary of an animation professional in India is US$600 compared to about US$6,000 in North America.</p>
      <p>“It is this arbitrage that we intend to leverage on.”</p>
