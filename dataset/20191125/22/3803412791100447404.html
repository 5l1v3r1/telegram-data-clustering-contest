      <h3>Where to find Eevee</h3>

      <p>Eevee can be found in the grass on Route 4 at any time during the day or night. You'll arrive at Route 4 after taking the train from Wedgehurst.</p>
      <p>Eevee is very elusive, so it's going to take a while for it to appear. Keep wandering around in the tall yellow grass and keep an eye out for those adorable tell-tale ears sticking out.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Enter into a <b>Pokémon battle</b> with Eevee.</li>
        <li><b>Weaken it</b> with one of your Pokémon until its HP is in the 'red' zone.</li>
        <li>Throw a <b>Poké Ball</b> and hope for the best!</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>How to evolve Eevee</h3>
      <p>Evolving Eevee in Pokémon Sword and Shield is relatively easy. Simply level up your Eevee a little bit so it is at least level 15 and then use one of the following stones on it:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Flareon = Use a fire stone</li>
        <li>Jolteon = Use a thunder stone</li>
        <li>Vaporeon = Use a water stone</li>
        <li>Leafeon = Use a leaf stone</li>
        <li>Glaceon = Use an ice stone</li>
      </ul>
      <p>An easy place to find these stones is on the narrow strip of land on the other side of the Lake of Outrage. However, you'll need to be far enough in the game to be able to ride your bike over the water. On this strip of land, you'll find a tall ring of stones. Each one has an element stone next to it.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Espeon</li>
        <li>Umbreon</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For Espeon and Umbreon the process is slightly different as you must raise your friendship level with your Eevee in your camp by playing with it, feeding it and using it to practice fighting in your camp. Once your friendship with that Eevee has been maxed out, the next time it evolves it will transform into either Espeon if it levels up during the day or Umbreon if it levels up during the night.</p>

      <p>A great way to increase your Pokémon's friendliness in a hurry is by having it hold the <b>Soothe Bell</b>. This is a special item which you get from a blonde-haired woman inside a house in Hammerlocke. The house is immediately on the right once you enter the city. Additionally, another person in the same home, can tell you what your Pokémon's friendship level currently is.</p>
