      <p>If your love for Apple products is so strong that you basically just trade in all of your paychecks for whatever devices they have, you're going to finally get a break this holiday season with an epic sale. Though there's a wide range, the <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/the-best-black-friday-apple-deals-will-save-you-hundreds-of-dollars-19344493">best Cyber Monday deals for Apple products</a> left over from Black Friday are so impressive, that even the experts are surprised. Literally, Julie Ramhold, consumer analyst with <a href="http://www.dealnews.com/">DealNews.com</a> told Bustle that the sales were "incredible" and far bigger than she had predicted, with shocks across the board. As someone who literally just traded a paycheck in for AirPods, under the misguided assumption that they'd never go on an epic sale, I too am eating my words.</p>
      <p>AirPods, along with many other popular Apple accessories and items will still be on sale this Monday after Black Friday, and you'll want to act fast because these sales won't last. If you already have all of the devices and accessories you need, you'll want to use this opportunity to do some holiday shopping for others. The items that might be too expensive at their regular price are now affordable, meaning that you're basically going to be the best gift giver ever this year. What's more, by the time Christmas rolls around, Black Friday and Cyber Monday will be a faraway memory and you'll get full price credit, for sure. Here are some of the <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/dtdeals/best-apple-cyber-monday-deals/">best Apple deals</a> to take advantage of on Monday from multiple trusted retailers:</p>
