      <h1>ESPN’s Prediction For Tonight’s Rams-Ravens Game</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T22:45:58+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 22:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matthladik" target="_blank">Matt Hladik</a></address>
      <p>Week 12 of the NFL season concludes tonight with a Monday Night Football matchup between the Baltimore Ravens and Los Angeles Rams.</p>
      <p>Tonight’s game features two teams with quarterbacks playing on opposite ends of the spectrum. Baltimore’s Lamar Jackson is performing at an MVP-level, while the Rams’ Jared Goff has been struggling immensely.</p>
      <p>At 8-2, the Ravens are right now the No. 2 seed in the AFC, and they have a win over the top-seeded Patriots on their resume. The Rams are 6-4 after beating the Bears last week and must win to stay in the thick of a tight NFC playoff race.</p>
      <p>Translation: there’s plenty at stake tonight. ESPN has <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401128012">released its prediction</a> for the game.</p>
      <p>Despite being on the road, the Ravens are slightly favored by the computer.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>Baltimore has a 52.5 percent chance of winning, according to the FPI. The Rams are given a 47.1 percent shot, with a 0.4 percent chance of a tie.</b>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Rams-Ravens will kick off at 8:15 p.m. ET from Los Angeles.</p>
      <p>You can catch the action on ESPN.</p>
