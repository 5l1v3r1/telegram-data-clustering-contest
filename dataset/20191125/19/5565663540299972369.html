      <p>EXPECTATIONS - largely on social media - that the return to Zimbabwe of fit-again Vice President Constantino Chiwenga would mark the beginning of a titanic political contest between him and President Emmerson Mnangagwa appear to have so far received short shrift, the Daily News reports.<br/><br/>This comes after the two men appeared to be very happy to reunite at the weekend - hugging each other warmly and animatedly exchanging pleasantries after Chiwenga returned home on Saturday from China, where he had been undergoing treatment for an undisclosed serious ailment.<br/><br/>In addition, Chiwenga also appeared to have responded directly to the social media chatter, after he pledged loyalty to Mnangagwa - further thanking his boss profusely for having assisted him to get medical treatment in South Africa and China.<br/><br/>At the same time, Mnangagwa disclosed at the weekend that Chiwenga had been gravely ill when he was airlifted abroad - to the extent that he was suffering from "memory lapses". Speaking to State media, Mnangagwa also said that he was mightily relieved that Chiwenga was back.<br/><br/>On his part, Chiwenga also revealed how close he had come to meeting his maker before he was flown to China.<br/><br/>Chiwenga returned in a Chinese private jet and was welcomed at Robert Mugabe International Airport by Chinese Deputy Ambassador to Zimbabwe, Zhao Baogang.<br/><br/>Later, Chiwenga met with Mnangagwa at his private residence, where the two leaders appeared very happy to reunite â€” hugging each other warmly, holding hands for minutes on end and animatedly exchanging pleasantries.<br/><br/>"Mukoma ndadzoka (My big brother I am back)," Chiwenga said as he embraced with the Zanu-PF leader.</p>
