      <p>The trains in New York City are notorious for producing unpleasant experiences, probably none more so than the L train. For lucky passengers in a particular train car on Sunday, the L train was the place to be. </p>
      <p>Videos began circulating on Sunday evening of a full-on feast happening on one of the train cars. While many on social media lauded the gesture, others deflated the moment by reminding people of how bacteria-ridden the MTA actually is and how it may not be the ideal place to enjoy a Thanksgiving meal. </p>
