      <h1>John Hartson sends Celtic detractor Sam Allardyce a firm message as he tells snipers to shut it</h1>
      <h2>The Hoops hero took to social media to address the club's doubters in the wake of the former England manager's barbed claim.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T19:39:07+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 19:39</time> by <a rel="author">Graeme Young, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/graeme-young/</a></address>
      <p>Former Celtic striker <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/john-hartson">John Hartson</a> has issued a firm defence of his former club in the wake of Sam Allardyce's criticism.</p>
      <p>The Hoops hero took to social media to address the club's detractors - hours after Allardyce had a pop at the Premiership champions when he claimed anyone could lead them to silverware.</p>
      <p>And Hartson wasted no time in responding as he paid tribute to <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> and insists those who don't know the club should remain silent.</p>
      <p>The Wales international posted on Twitter: "One or two more people putting the boot into Celtic.</p>

      <p>"Unless you have represented this great club you have no idea of the culture, the meaning, the family and the volume of its fan base. In the mean time, just be quiet please."</p>
      <p>Allardyce didn't hold back with his assertion that winning trophies with the Parkhead side would be easy and he reckons Rangers are poised to end the Hoops' dominance.</p>
      <p>He said: "We can all go to Celtic and win trophies.</p>
      <p>"It will be <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> soon the way they are going under <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steven-gerrard">Steven Gerrard</a> .</p>

      <p>"Fans expect you to win trophies and if you don't do that then you'd get the sack.</p>
      <p>"I agree with what Brendan was saying and it was a great move for him because it built his reputation again.</p>
      <p>"But I didn't think there was anything wrong with him because he was brilliant at Liverpool, just a bad patch of recruitment cost him his job."</p>
