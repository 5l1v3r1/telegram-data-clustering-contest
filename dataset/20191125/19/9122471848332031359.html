      <h1>Urban Meyer Named Favorite To Land The Dallas Cowboys Job</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T19:57:19+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 19:57</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>Urban Meyer addressed the Dallas Cowboys job earlier this fall during an appearance on Colin Cowherd’s radio show. The former Ohio State head coach said it was the kind of job you almost have to take if you’re offered it.</p>
      <p>“That’s the New York Yankees, that’s the Dallas Cowboys, that’s the one. Great city, you got Dak Prescott, you got Zeke Elliott, you got a loaded team, and I can’t speak for [Lincoln Riley] obviously—I hate to even speculate—because I don’t know him, that’s really not fair, but to me, that’s the one job in professional football that you kind of say, ‘I gotta go do that.’”</p>
      <p>Meyer said he would consider an offer if he got one.</p>
      <p>“Absolutely. Absolutely,” <a href="https://thespun.com/college-football/urban-meyers-comments-on-the-cowboys-job-were-pretty-telling">he said</a>. “That one? Yes.”</p>
      <p>That was a month ago. Fast forward to the present and Urban Meyer coaching the Dallas Cowboys might be a legitimate possibility.</p>
      <p>Jason Garrett likely needs to reach the NFC Championship Game or better to stick around in 2020. Jerry Jones made it very clear after Sunday’s loss in New England that he’s not happy.</p>

      <p>Oklahoma head coach Lincoln Riley <a href="https://thelandryhat.com/2019/06/26/lincoln-riley-destined-dallas-cowboys/">has long been considered</a> the guy Jones will try to get, but does Meyer actually make more sense in Dallas?</p>
      <p>The three-time national champion puts a significant focus on special teams, something the Cowboys have stunk at all season (<a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/sports/cowboys/2019/11/25/jerry-jones-on-the-loss-it-is-a-significant-setback-for-our-team/">especially on Sunday</a>). He has significant experience working with – and building an offense around – athletic quarterbacks.</p>
      <p>Meyer has also been “retired” for about a year and could be fresh and ready for a new challenge.</p>
      <p>Betting odds have been released this afternoon for the Cowboys’ 2020 head coach. The favorite to land the job: Urban Meyer.</p>

      <p>Meyer has always been a college guy, but it would be interesting to see him coaching an NFL team, especially a prestigious franchise like the Cowboys.</p>
      <p>For now, though, Dallas is 6-5 and led by Jason Garrett. The Cowboys will look to hold onto their NFC East lead on Thursday with a win over the Bills.</p>
