      <p>There is no significant snow in the forecast for the Okanagan, but it’s going to feel like winter from a temperature point of view this week.</p>
      <p>That wasn’t the case on Nov. 25 and 26, 2014, when the valley experienced an overnight winter storm that brought 14 centimetres of heavy, wet snow to Vernon, and 17 cm of snow along with four millimetres of rain to Kelowna. Penticton set the Nov. 26 record for snowfall in 2014 when 18 cm fell on the city, in addition to three cm that fell on the Nov. 25.</p>

        <figcaption>Five years ago the Okanagan was hit by an early winter overnight snowstorm that dropped rain and soggy wet snow throughout the valley. Vernon received 14 cm of snow, while Kelowna received a combination of 17 cm of snow and four mm of rain. In Penticton, 21 cm of snow fell, setting a record for snowfall on that day.

      <p>Environment Canada meteorologist Matt MacDonald says a big change in the weather is due today, Nov. 25, when a mass of arctic air is expected to begin pushing into the region.</p>
      <p>“It will be a windy, cold day on Tuesday, getting progressively colder through the week,” he says.</p>
      <p>The Okanagan should see minus temperatures in the double digits for the first time this winter.</p>
      <p>MacDonald says the cold snap is pretty much “right on schedule” for this time of year. He says the cold, dry conditions are expected to remain well into next week, but at this point, it doesn’t appear cold weather records will be broken.</p>
      <p>For today in the Okanagan, expect a mix of sun and cloud in Vernon, and a 30 per cent chance of rain or flurries in Kelowna and Penticton this morning.</p>
      <p>It should reach a high of 2 Celsius and a low of -3 C in Vernon and Kelowna.</p>
      <p>In Penticton it should reach a high of 5 C, dropping to -2 C overnight.</p>
      <p>Tomorrow should see mostly cloudy conditions with the wind becoming north at 20 km/h in the afternoon.</p>
      <p>An expected high of -1 C  in Vernon and  Kelowna and 2 C Penticton could be accompanied by a wind chill of -9 C in the afternoon.</p>
      <p>Cloudy conditions are expected overnight with a low of -7 C.</p>
      <p>Wednesday should see a mix of sun and cloud. It’s expected to be windy with a high of -2 C and a low of -10 overnight.</p>
      <p>The windy conditions are expected to continue overnight along with cloudy periods.</p>
      <p>Thursday should be mainly sunny but very cold, with a high of -3 C and an overnight low under clear skies of -13 C.</p>
      <p>More sunshine is forecast for Friday, with a high of -7 C and a low of -12 C along with cloudy periods overnight.</p>
      <p>Saturday should see a mix of sun and clouds with a high of -4 C and a low of -9 C.<br/><br/>Sunday’s forecast should be similar, with sun and cloud and a high of -3 C expected.</p>
      <p>Normal temperatures at this time of year in the Okanagan are highs of 1 C and lows of -5 C.</p>
