      <p>Two Apple TV+ shows are entered Reelgood’s streaming Top 20 last week (via <a href="https://bgr.com/2019/11/22/most-watched-tv-shows-disney-plus-netflix-other-streamers/"><i>BGR</i></a>). <i><a href="https://www.macobserver.com/columns-opinions/apple-tv-see-review/">See</a> </i>and <a href="https://www.macobserver.com/analysis/the-morning-show-episode-six-review-fighting-with-fire/"><i>The Morning Show</i></a> were in 11 and 12th positions respectively.</p>

      <h3>Apple TV+ Shows in Streaming Top 20</h3>
      <p>Top of the pile of all the streaming services’ shows was Star Wars spin-off series <i>The <a href="https://www.macobserver.com/cool-stuff-found/star-wars-the-mandalorian-trailer/">Mandalorian</a> </i>on Disney+. At the time of this writing, <i>The Morning Show</i> had an IMDB audience score of 94 percent. That’s compared to a 63 percent Tomatometer ranking, which is based on critic reviews. Interestingly, despite being streamed more, <i>See </i>is fairing less well when it comes to ratings. It had an audience score of 85 percent and a Tomatometer reading of 42 percent. (It is worth noting that <i>The Morning Show </i>had received a lot more critic and user ratings.)</p>
      <h3>‘The Morning Show’ Producer Thinks Some Critics Are Just Apple Haters</h3>
      <p><i>The Morning Show</i> producer Mimi Leder used an appearance at the <i>Recode</i> Code Media conference to hit back at the critics who had been unkind to her show. She blamed much of the reaction on the critic’s feelings about Apple:</p>
      <blockquote>When those reviews came in, I didn’t know what show they were watching, and I just kind of thought they were nuts. I just felt there were a lot of Apple haters and wanting Apple to fail.</blockquote>
      <p>While IMDB ratings are hardly scientific, they show she may just have a point.</p>
