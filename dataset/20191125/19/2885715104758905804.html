      <p>The 2012 gangrape and murder case was Monday transferred from a vacant court to another judge to decide whether to direct Tihar Jail authorities to expedite the execution of the convicts. District Judge Yashwant Kumar sent the case to Additional Sessions Judge Satish Arora, who will hear the matter on November 28, on an application by the victim’s mother.</p>
      <p>In her application, the victim’s mother, through counsel Jitender Kumar Jha and Seema Kushwaha, said the “fast track court of Additional Sessions Judge P K Jain has been vacant and she has waited for some successor judge to occupy the Chair…”</p>
      <p>“Convicts have not preferred any remedy available in law… Sessions court is authorised to issue appropriate warrants so that the sentence awarded to the convicts may be carried out as early as possible…,” said the plea.</p>
      <p>Tihar Jail authorities had said the convicts — Mukesh (31), Pawan Gupta (24), Vinay Sharma (25) and <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/akshay-kumar/">Akshay Kumar</a> Singh (33) — on death row have “exhausted” all legal remedies “except provision of filing mercy petition” before the President.</p>
      <p>While the counsel for Pawan, Vinay and Akshay said they have sent their replies to jail authorities, Mukesh’s counsel said a plea will be filed before the Supreme Court soon.</p>
