      <h1>Urban Meyer Releases Thank You Video For Ohio State Fans</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T19:33:28+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 19:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matthladik" target="_blank">Matt Hladik</a></address>
      <p>Urban Meyer returned to Ohio State for last weekend’s game against Penn State. Meyer is part of FOX’s “Big Noon Kickoff” pregame show.</p>
      <p>Naturally, the Buckeye fans welcomed their former head coach with open arms. Meyer returned the favor over the weekend and today on Twitter.</p>
      <p>This afternoon, Meyer thanked the OSU fans who turned out and provided the atmosphere for he and his colleagues on Saturday.</p>
      <p>“On behalf of the <a href="https://twitter.com/CFBONFOX">@CFBONFOX </a>Big Noon Kickoff team, THANKS for your hospitality. You guys are the best. Come see us in Ann Arbor,” Meyer wrote.</p>

      <p>Even if Ohio State fans show up, Meyer will find things much less hospitable in Ann Arbor on Saturday. He’s not exactly well-liked by Michigan fans.</p>
      <p>The Wolverines will be looking to beat the Buckeyes for the first time since 2011, the season before Meyer made his coaching debut for Ohio State.</p>
      <p>A win over Ohio State won’t keep the Buckeyes out of the conference title game or the College Football Playoff, but it will go a long way for a Michigan program that is dying to beat its rival.</p>
