      <h1>Jacoby Ellsbury doctor details the origins of Yankees’ fight for millions</h1>

      <p>The war between the Yankees and Jacoby Ellsbury continued to escalate Monday as the doctor at the heart of the explosive contractual dispute argued that he never treated the oft-injured outfielder for a work-related injury and never provided him or any athlete with performance-enhancing drugs.</p>
      <p>Dr. Viktor Bouquette <a href="https://theathletic.com/1407130/2019/11/25/rosenthal-doctor-at-center-of-jacoby-ellsbury-dispute-says-he-never-treated-the-player-for-a-work-related-injury/">told The Athletic that his clinic</a>, the Progressive Medical Center (PMC) in Atlanta, “focuses not on rehabilitating specific injuries but on reducing inflammation in patients by identifying and treating its underlying causes.”</p>
      <p>The Yankees are attempting to recoup some or all of the final $26 million they owe on Ellsbury’s $153 million albatross contract, charging he used the facility without their authorization to rehab injuries that sidelined him for all of the past two seasons.</p>
      <p>The Post reported Friday that once Ellsbury cleared release waivers last week, <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/22/yankees-claiming-jacoby-ellsbury-went-behind-their-backs-in-grievance/">the Yankees immediately sent a letter to the MLB Players Association</a> notifying the union of their intention to convert Ellsbury’s contract from guaranteed to non-guaranteed, thereby clearing them of the outfielder’s $21 million salary for 2020 as well as a $5 million buyout of a $21 million team option for 2021. The Post also reported that the Yankees could look to recover some of the $127 million already paid to Ellsbury.</p>
      <p>The MLBPA shot back that it would fight the organization’s claims on Ellsbury’s behalf, saying in a statement the union “will vigorously defend any action taken against Jacoby or his contract and is investigating potential contract violations by his employer.”</p>

      <p>The Post also has reported that the Yankees were unable to insure Ellsbury’s contract for 2020 after the team had been reimbursed 75 percent of the $42 million he’d been paid in 2018 and 2019 despite not appearing in any games.</p>
      <p>According to The Athletic report, however, Bouquette claimed he never treated Ellsbury for a work-related injury. If proven, Ellsbury, who is represented by agent Scott Boras, could argue he did not violate his contract or MLB’s collective-bargaining agreement.</p>
      <p>Bouquette also claims the Yankees reached out to him in May asking for a signed statement saying the clinic would not administer Ellsbury any substances on baseball’s banned list, which he said he provided on May 31.</p>
      <p>“To my knowledge, [the Yankees] had no objection at all,” Bouquette said of Ellsbury’s treatment at PMC. “The only [request] I got from them was asking if I was familiar with the banned-substance list, and then saying I needed to put that in writing, which I did. That was the only contact we had with them [to that point].”</p>
      <p>That written statement, at least according to Bouquette, was the Yankees’ condition for Ellsbury to continue receiving treatment at the clinic.</p>
      <p>Still, Bouquette claimed that he hadn’t treated Ellsbury nor heard again from the Yankees since June. He added that any supplements PMC provides to patients are certified by the National Science Foundation and aren’t included on baseball’s banned list.</p>
      <p>According to Bouquette, his clinic does not prescribe PEDs “for any reason whatsoever.”</p>
      <p>“What happens if you give an anabolic steroid to someone who has inflammation, the symptoms on the surface might appear to mitigate,” Bouquette said. “But the underlying problem is amplified. It will actually cause more harm by doing that.”</p>
      <p>In 2011, Bouquette was disciplined by the Georgia Composite Medical Board for improperly diagnosing a female patient (who later died) nine years earlier. Bouquette was forced to pay nearly $6,000 in fines and stop using a controversial practice known as intravenous chelation therapy on patients without fully documenting a need for the treatment.</p>
