      <p>Award-winning director Kenneth Gyang is set to shoot his fourth feature film which will be produced by Gyang’s outfit Cinema Kpatakpata, and will follow his ground-breaking debut Confusion Na Wa, the Nigeria-Norway coproduction Lost Café and Oloture,  which received its African premiere at the prestigious Carthage Film Festival in Tunisia.</p>
      <p>The new picture is currently in pre-production under a working title and has been described by insiders as an Indiana Jones-type adventure set in one of Nigeria’s many beautiful towns.</p>
      <p>Nollywood great Richard Mofe Damijo (popularly known as RMD) is one of the film’s stars. He would be working alongside Ntare Guma Mwine, star of the Oscar-nominated film Blood Diamond. Mwine was also in the 2016 box office success Queen of Katwe, which featured Oscar winner Lupita Nyong’o.</p>
      <p>The forthcoming project has been in development for several years while Gyang worked on a series of projects, including documentaries and workshops for aspiring Nigerian filmmakers. Shooting will commence towards the end of the first quarter of 2020.</p>
      <p>RMD expressed his admiration for the young director, who has previously worked with established actors Ramsey Nouah and Ali Nuhu.</p>
      <p>“We should get ready for what is coming. I won’t be able to give specific details of the project but Kenneth and his team are going to give our audience a great ride. I am happy to get on it.”</p>
      <p>The director was, however, tight-lipped on rumours of his next film being a Nigerian homage to the Indiana Jones films.</p>
      <p>“I love Spielberg,” Gyang said. “But I can’t say anything about the film, except that it is a film by Nigerians and for the world. Let’s just wait till next year. We are putting finishing touches to the script and intend to give this beautiful country a film it deserves.”</p>
