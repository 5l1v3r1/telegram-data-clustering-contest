      <p>TMZ reports that Tekashi 6ix9ine's assault charge stemming from a 2018 incident where 6ix9ine choked Santiago Albarran at a mall for filming him without his permission. On Monday, a Texas judge threw out the case completely after citing several reasons, which are not surprising. </p>
      <p>For starters, Albarran told the judge to drop the case during the initial court hearing and later posed in a photo with Tekashi after the two left court. Lastly, the judge cited 6ix9ine's current legal situation that has him federal custody. </p>
