      <p>eBay plans to sell its StubHub ticket marketplace to European competitor Viagogo for about $4 billion in cash.</p>
      <p>eBay determined selling StubHub was “the best path forward” for both companies as part of a review of its portfolio and strategies, interim CEO Scott Schenkel said Monday. That review was launched this year amid pressure from an activist investor, according to the Associated Press.</p>
      <p>When combined, the resale platforms will hawk hundreds of thousands of tickets each day more than 70 countries after the deal closes in the first quarter of next year, according to a news release.</p>
      <p>“This provides a great opportunity to expand our business, pursue new partnerships and execute our strategy,” StubHub President Sukhinder Singh Cassidy said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The sale will also reunite StubHub with its co-founder Eric Baker, the Viagogo founder and CEO who left his former company before eBay bought it for $310 million in 2007.</p>
      <p>“I am so proud of how StubHub has grown over the years and excited about the possibilities for our shared future,” Baker said in a statement. “Buyers will have a wider choice of tickets, and sellers will have a wider network of buyers.”</p>
