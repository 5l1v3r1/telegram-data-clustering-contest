      <h1>The LifeStraw that was a top 5 best-seller on Prime Day is discounted again ahead of Black Friday</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T19:10:01+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 19:10</time> by <a rel="author">Maren Estrada</a></address>
      <p>We’re not sure if it’s because hiking and camping are <i>waaaaaaay</i> more popular than we thought or because doomsday preppers really love big sales events. Whatever the case, Amazon announced earlier this year that the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B006QF3TW4?tag=b0c55-20">LifeStraw Personal Water Filter</a> was one of the five best-selling products of Prime Day 2019. Think about how crazy that is… there were tens of thousands of killer deals out there, and this was one of the top five! If you missed out on the Prime Day deal everyone went crazy over, don’t worry because we have great news: It’s back on sale ahead of Black Friday 2019!</p>
