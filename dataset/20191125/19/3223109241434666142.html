      <h1>Man Nearly Loses $1.4 Million Online Game Character</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T19:24:40+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 19:24</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.geek.com/author/jminor/" target="_blank">Jordan Minor</a></address>
      <p>People are willing to spend unreal amounts of money on video games. Look at all the folks who give thousands of dollars to “free” mobile games while balking at $60 retail releases. Or consider how many rubes have contributed to the ongoing grift that is <i>Star Citizen</i>, a game that lets you spend hundreds of dollars on fake spaceships in a game that’s never coming out. And when you fork over that kind of dough for a purely digital product, you need to be extra careful that it doesn’t totally evaporate.</p>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/article/3038799/man-sues-netease-after-his-friend-sells-us14-million-game-character-us500">South China Morning Post</a> (and reported by <a href="https://kotaku.com/man-spends-1-4-million-on-game-character-which-his-fr-1840027912">Kotaku</a>) this nightmare nearly happened to an unfortunate Chinese gamer. This player spent $1.4 million on his character in <i>Justice Online</i>, an MMORPG, and nearly lost his creation due to a careless and possibly malicious friend.</p>
      <p>Like many online social games, <i>Justice Online</i> has a marketplace component where players can lend and sell items. Remember the original <i>Diablo 3</i>? The game comes from NetEase, who now have a significant stake in <a href="https://www.geek.com/games/after-bungie-and-destiny-please-free-blizzard-from-activision-1769408/">Bungie</a>, which makes sense considering how <i>Destiny</i> works.</p>
      <p>But in this case of <i>Justice Online</i>, the original player lent his pricey character to a friend. The friend then apparently tried to sell the character back for about $55,000, but accidentally listed the price as $552 instead. This led to yet another player snapping up the great unintentional bargain before any other sales could go through.</p>
      <p>Fortunately, it all worked out. The sale was reversed. The character returned to its original home, and the innocent frugal player who bought the character got over $12,000 in damages. The whole mess makes you realize why China maybe wants to enforce <a href="https://www.geek.com/games/new-chinese-rules-limit-how-much-time-money-young-gamers-spend-online-1809703/">stricter gaming curfews</a>, even if we disagree.</p>
