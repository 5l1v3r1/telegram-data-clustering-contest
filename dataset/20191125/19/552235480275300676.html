      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T19:01:14+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 19:01</time> by <a rel="author">Graeme Young, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/graeme-young/</a></address>
      <p>Brescia are at the centre of a major racism storm after they blamed a misunderstanding on chairman Massimo Cellino's shock insult aimed at Mario Balotelli.</p>
      <p>The football world has been left aghast at the ex- <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/leeds-united-fc">Leeds United</a> chairman's disgusting view on the the club's marquee forward.</p>
      <p>Cellino said: "What can I say? That he's black and he's working to whiten himself but he has great difficulties in this."</p>
      <p>The vile slur is the latest in a string of insults aimed at the former <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> striker during his time back in his homeland.</p>
      <p>It comes after Fabio Grosso left Balotelli out of Sunday's squad for the 3-0 defeat at Roma and challenged him to show more "determination and enthusiasm" to regain his place.</p>

      <p>A club statement said: "In relation to what president Massimo Cellino declared this afternoon about our player Mario Balotelli, Brescia Calcio explains that it was clearly a joke said as a paradox.</p>
      <p>"It was clearly misunderstood and it was said in the attempt to downplay an excessive media exposure and aimed at protecting the player."</p>
      <p>The striker has endured years of abuse in Italy and Gazzetta hello Sport infamously depicted Balotelli as King Kong on top of Big Ben back in 2012.</p>
