      <h1>Newcastle United team news: Steve Bruce confirms Jonjo Shelvey as stand-in skipper</h1>
      <h2>Newcastle United head coach Steve Bruce forced into changes for the trip to Villa Park as captain Jamaal Lascelles misses out</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T19:10:40+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 19:10</time> by <a rel="author">Lee Ryder</a></address>
      <p>Newcastle United boss Steve Bruce was relieved to see Ciaran Clark passed fit enough to start against his old club Aston Villa tonight.</p>
      <p>The Republic of Ireland centre-back had been doubtful with a knock but will line up in the second city this evening.</p>
      <p>With Jamaal Lascelles ruled out with a knee injury, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/aston-villa-vs-newcastle-live-17302627">Paul Dummett came back into the starting line-up</a> with Jonjo Shelvey handed the skipper’s armband.</p>
      <p>Bruce had an array of attacking options on the bench with Dwight Gayle, Andy Carroll and Christian Atsu in reserve while Fabian Schar was deemed fit enough for just a substitute role.</p>
      <p>A gang of Villa fans waited for returning former boss Bruce with some half-hearted booing as he prepared to take on his ex-club.</p>
      <p>Before the game Bruce had been asked about a cabbage being hurled at him in his last game as manager.</p>
      <p>He said: “How they got it into the stadium I don’t know. Stephen Clemence miscontrolled it when it came in.</p>
      <p>“My reaction was ‘what the **** is that?’ It didn’t miss me by much, it fell at my feet. I thought it was a ball, the size of it.”</p>
      <p>The Magpies can climb up to the top 10 with three points at Villa Park tonight.</p>
      <p><b>UNITED</b> : Dubravka, Yedlin, Fernandez, Clark, Dummett, Willems, Almiron, Hayden, Shelvey, Saint-Maximin, Joelinton</p>
      <p>Subs: Darlow, Schar, Carroll, Gayle, Krafth, Atsu, Longstaff</p>
