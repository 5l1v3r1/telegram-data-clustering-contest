      <p>The Okanagan School of the Arts says it may be time to consider leaving the historic Shatford Centre behind, as a public dispute opens up between it and their landlord. </p>
      <p>In a letter to members Monday afternoon, OSA board president Keith MacIntyre accused SD67 secretary treasurer Kevin Lorenz of being difficult to deal with when it comes to renewing the organization's lease set to expire June 30 , 2020.</p>
      <p>The OSA leases the Shatford building from the Okanagan Skaha School District for one dollar a year, but is responsible for all building repairs and maintenance for the 100-year-old building.</p>
      <p>“We are having challenges with the renewal of our lease and we need to discuss as an organization what the OSA may look like without being in the Shatford Centre,” said MacIntyre’s letter to members, in advance of the group’s AGM on Saturday.</p>
      <p>“I have been flabbergasted by the approach taken by the secretary treasurer of the school board while we have been trying to determine the best path to renewing our lease. I have come to the conclusion that there is an agenda that is not being made clear to us,” MacIntyre’s letter continued.</p>
      <p>While admitting he has no proof, MacIntyre suggested the school district would rather a private business take over the Shatford building. His letter alleges Lorenz has threatened to not approve sub-leases, requested expensive reports and blocked attempts to install their own internet line.</p>
      <p>Lorenz, meanwhile, tells Castanet News the Okanagan School of the Arts has not submitted any type of formal proposal for a lease renewal. He said the school district remains committed to keeping the Shatford Centre a public building and asset.</p>
      <p>Lorenz declined to comment on the specifics of MacIntyre’s letter, but released email correspondence between the pair after a Freedom of Information Request by Castanet. </p>
      <p>The emails detail MacIntyre’s growing frustration with the Lorenz and the school district over the perceived bureaucracy involved with dealing with the public body.</p>
      <p>One of the largest sticking points is Lorenz’s request for a depreciation report, which would ostensibly detail required repairs and renovations. MacIntyre says the report would cost around $10,000 and is typically only used by residential stratas. He maintains the required renovations have already been documented by previous reports. </p>
      <p>There was also a disagreement over the installation of internet for the OSA and its sub-leases. After receiving approval from a lower-level SD67 staffer, MacIntyre contracted Telus to install internet at the Shatford to lower costs associated with buying it from the school district. </p>
      <p>Lorenz would later block the internet install from happening, stating the OSA did not receive written approval for the project and said a formal proposal be required for the install. </p>
      <p>“It is very unlikely that the district would approve any building alterations on a lease that is ending in seven months, particularly if they involve piercing the building envelope. Given the additional cost to you organization in having that proposal prepared and reviewed, I am not recommending you undertake that work,” Lorenz said in an email to MacIntyre on Nov. 15. </p>
      <p>Another email suggests Lorenz would be open to discussing the internet install once a new lease is signed. </p>
      <p>MacIntyre maintains the install would not have pierced the building envelope. He added they have not submitted a lease proposal because their current lease forbids expressing interest for renewal until January. </p>
      <p>The emails also outline apprehension the school district had over approving any subleases proposed by the OSA, which have become an important part of the group’s sustainability.</p>
      <p>“Given the current financial circumstances of OSA and the lack of a capital funding plan, I am very uncomfortable approving new subleases in the last year,” Lorenz said on July 30 in an email to OSA executive director Kim Palmer. </p>
      <p>“But we do want to support you as much as we reasonably can,” Lorenz said, asking the OSA “unequivocally” disclose to their tenants they may have to leave at the end of June 2020.</p>
      <p>MacIntyre is requesting the school board form some sort of committee to deal with the renewal of the Shatford lease and take it out of district staff's hands. </p>
      <p>“I don't understand why we're being treated like an apartment tenant with a grow op,” MacIntyre emailed Lorenz on Nov. 15. “We have been good tenants in this building for almost 10 years and I'm very disappointed with how we have been treated throughout this process.”</p>
      <p>MacIntyre says he’ll be taking his request for a lease renewal committee to the school board during one of their future meetings.</p>
      <p>The City of Penticton provided the <a href="https://www.castanet.net/news/Penticton/251925/City-bailing-out-Shatford">OSA a $47,000 bail out </a>earlier this year.</p>
