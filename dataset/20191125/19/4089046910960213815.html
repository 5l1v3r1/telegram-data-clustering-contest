      <p><b>WASHINGTON (AP) —</b> A U.S. military dog that played a starring role in the raid that killed Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi seemed oblivious to the praise that President Donald Trump heaped on it Monday at the White House.</p>

      <p>Conan, a Belgian Malinois, seemed much more interested in the head scratches it was getting from Mike Pence, repeatedly looking up at the vice president in search of more attention.</p>
      <p>Trump used a slew of adjectives to describe Conan, which was injured when it was exposed to electric wires in the late October raid while chasing al-Baghdadi at the terrorist’s compound in northwest Syria. “Incredible.” “Brilliant.” “Smart.” “Ultimate fighter.” “Very special.” “Tough cookie.”</p>
      <p>“So this is Conan,” Trump said. “Right now, probably the world’s most famous dog.”</p>
      <p>Trump bestowed a medal on Conan and presented the dog with a plaque. First lady Melania Trump stood a few feet away.</p>
      <p>The president said initially Conan was going to be muzzled for the appearance, but Trump said he thought that would put the dog in attack mode.</p>
      <p>“He's not in a bad mood today,” Trump told dozens of reporters, cameramen and members of TV crews gathered in the Rose Garden. “So you’re safe.”</p>
      <p>Trumpsaid he asked members of the U.S. special forces who met with him Monday if an unarmed man would stand a chance against Conan. He said the special forces, who could not appear in public, told him ‘No.”</p>
      <p>“Conan is really a hero,” Pence said, patting the dog on the head.</p>
