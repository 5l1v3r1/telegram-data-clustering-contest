      <p>Following up this year’s <i>Cows on Hourglass Pond</i> album, <a href="http://hypebeast.com/tags/animal-collective">Animal Collective</a> musician <a href="http://hypebeast.com/tags/avey-tare">Avey Tare</a> is announcing his next major solo project, <i>Conference of Birds/Birds in Disguise</i>. A five-song EP, Avey Tare’s forthcoming release is a curated collection of studio recordings of live-only solo compositions that were initially performed during the tours in support of Avey Tare’s 2017 album <i>Eucalyptus</i> and <i>Cows on Hourglass Pond</i>. To introduce <i>Conference of Birds/Birds in Disguise</i>, the acclaimed Animal Collective artist is serving up a Natalia Stuyk-directed vignette in support of the EP’s two opening salvos, “Midnight Special” and “Red Light Water Show.”</p>
      <p>“It’s more nerve-wracking to play alone. I get way more nervous. It’s also because I haven’t done it that much. I’ve only done one kind of short tour for Down There some years ago, and I’ve only played a few other solo shows since. I’m not a huge fan of having a lot of backing tracks and stuff like that. It’s just not my thing,” Avey Tare shared with <a href="https://www.popmatters.com/avey-tare-2019-interview-2637319759.html?rebelltitem=1#rebelltitem1"><i>PopMatters</i></a> earlier this year, opening up about the differences between performing with Animal Collective versus performing as a solo act. “When it comes down to playing solo, it becomes more of a challenge in how to make it feel live and organic, considering the music.”</p>
      <p>“You just have to pick and choose the core elements of the song,” Avey Tare added. “We’ll play them as a band and see what feels like needs to be there and what feels like it doesn’t need to be there. It’s honestly a lot easier to play with other people and not have to follow a click track or have to pay attention to some backing track that’s always there. That always feels stale to me.”</p>
