      <h1>Multiple Cowboys Players Call Out Refs By Starting #Trippin Hashtag Following Loss To Patriots (TWEET)</h1>

      <p>In the fourth quarter of Sunday’s New England Patriots-Dallas Cowboys game, the Cowboys were flagged for a tripping penalty.</p>
      <p>Trailing 13-9 and facing a third-and-1 from their own 35, the team picked up a crucial first down on a pass to Ezekiel Elliott, but it would soon be called back as Offensive lineman Travis Frederick was flagged for tripping New England linebacker Donta’ Hightower as he rushed Prescott.</p>
      <p>It was a terrible call.</p>

      <p>The 10-yard penalty pushed Dallas back to third-and-11 instead of having the first down. Following the game, several members of the Dallas Cowboys took to Twitter and called out the refs by starting a #trippin hashtag to show how upset they were by that crucial call.</p>
