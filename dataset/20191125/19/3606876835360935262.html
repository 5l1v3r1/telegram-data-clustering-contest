        <li>Hooded Justice's stunning origin story was revealed in Watchmen's masterful sixth episode.</li>
        <li>The story purposefully mirrors Superman's origin story, actor Jovan Adepo says.</li>
        <li>Adepo says that showrunner Damon Lindelof and writer Cord Jefferson pitched the episode as a parallel of Superman's origin story.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The sixth episode of Watchmen is a stunner. Showrunner Damon Lindelof, co-writer Cord Jefferson, and director Stephen Williams delivered a triumph in the show's latest episode, using non-linear flashback/memory scenes to tell the backstory of Will Reeves, a mysterious character revealed to be masked crimefighter Hooded Justice in the flashbacks. And as <a href="https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a29862360/watchmen-hooded-justice-comics-explained/">Hooded Justice </a>was the first superhero in Watchmen's world, it's also clear that his path mirrors that of one of the world's most iconic superheroes: Superman.</p>
      <p>This isn't a secret, or a theory; this is the show's intent. Consider Will's origin that we saw in the opening sequence of the first episodehe's sent away from a war-torn, dangerous place, by his father. This is exactly what happens when Superman (Kal-el) is sent away by his own father (Jor-El), arriving in Kansas. Will, here, is sent away from Tulsa to a field, where he wakes up with a baby; eventually, he finds his way to New York, the setting of the sixth episode.</p>
      <p>Actor <a href="https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a29865202/hooded-justice-jovan-adepo-watchmen-interview/">Jovan Adepo </a>, who played the young police officer version of <a href="https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a29896628/watchmen-mesmerism-twist-explained/">Will Reeves </a>/Hooded Justice, explained that the show's Hooded Justice origin story was indeed trying to match that of <a href="https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/g29816386/superman-actors-list/">Superman </a>.</p>
      <p>"The way [playing Will] was introduced to me for this episode was that Damon was attempting, along with Cord Jefferson, to pay homage to the origins of young Kal-El, Superman," he said in an interview with Men's Health. "And him leaving Krypton, which also goes into the first episode, when you see the young Will being sent away from Tulsa by his father, is supposed to mirror Jor-El sending Kal-el away from Krypton, to earth."</p>
      <p>There are also allusions to the Superman origin parallel in the song titles on the show's original score, by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross. One song early on is called "ORPHANS OF KRYPTON" (of course alluding to Superman's home planet), while another, called "WATCH OVER THIS BOY" clearly alludes to the shot of Will and the note his father wrote for someone to find him with.</p>
      <p>Superman and Watchmen both exist under the DC Comics umbrella (someone is reading an Action Comics in the episodeits 1938 setting also marks the year of Superman's first appearance). Adepo says that he's always been drawn to the brand "DC Comics in general have always had stories that feel a little bit more grounded, in my opinion," he explained. "I think I've really been a fan of DC for a long time, and all of its propertiesnot just Watchmenalways have an incredibly high amount of stakes. We're talking about a great achievement, or a great loss, and pain and suffering. They've never really shied away from the darkness that comes from those types of conflict."</p>
      <p>We'll continue to see how the Hooded Justice story plays out in the coming weeks of Watchmenonly three episodes remain.</p>
