      <p>Mercedes-Benz recently revealed a new subcompact SUV called the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/mercedes-benz/glb">GLB</a>, which is styled to be reminiscent of a baby <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/mercedes-benz/g-class">G-Class</a>. The GLB rides on the same front-wheel-drive-base architecture as the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/mercedes-benz/a-class">A-Class </a>sedan and <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/mercedes-benz/cla">CLA-Class</a> four-door coupe and it will also underpin the upcoming <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/mercedes-benz/gla">GLA</a>, which is <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/this-is-when-the-new-mercedes-gla-will-debut">set to debut on December 11</a>, 2019, with a digital-only world premiere.</p>
      <p>With the reveal just a week away, Mercedes has posted a teaser image showing the GLA's silhouette with a dark background. The headlights and taillights are partially visible on the image, giving us a better idea of<a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/could-the-new-mercedes-gla-look-like-this"> what the GLA will look like</a>.</p>

      <p>We expect the final design to be similar to the A-Class hatchback, which is only sold in Europe. Compared to the outgoing GLA, Mercedes says this new model is ten centimeters (3.9 inches) taller, which allows for more headroom and a higher seating position. This new GLA is also 1.5 centimeters (0.59 inches) shorter than the outgoing model while also improving on rear legroom. Mercedes has also shown off some camouflaged photos of the GLA undergoing off-road testing, demonstrating the short front and rear overhangs as well as the protective cladding underneath.</p>
      <p>Under the hood, we expect the GLA to utilize the same 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine mated to a seven-speed automatic transmission found in the A-Class, CLA, and GLB. Mercedes could offer the 220 horsepower tune in the GLA but could also use the 188-hp version of the engine found in the A-Class.</p>

      <p>Inside, the GLA should share most of its cabin layout with the other sub-compact Mercedes models. This means it will benefit from a dual-screen setup powered by the excellent MBUX infotainment system. Mercedes says the GLA will be offered with a Driving Assistance package, which includes Active Brake Assist, cornering function, emergency lane function, exit warning, and pedestrian warning. When it arrives, the GLA will likely cost less than the GLB, which starts at $36,600.</p>
