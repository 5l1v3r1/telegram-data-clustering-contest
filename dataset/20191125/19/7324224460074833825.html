      <p>England’s Cricket World Cup-winning hero Ben Stokes is on the six-person shortlist for the 2019 BBC Sports Personality of the Year award.</p>
      <p>Stokes, who struck an unbeaten 84 before coming back out to bat in a nail-biting Super Over in the World Cup final against New Zealand, is joined on the list by athletics stars Dina Asher-Smith and Katarina Johnson-Thompson, England and Manchester City footballer Raheem Sterling, Formula One world champion Lewis Hamilton and Wales rugby captain Alun Wyn Jones.</p>
      <p>The six nominees were announced across a variety of BBC programming on Monday. Voting will open on the evening of Sunday, December 15, with the event taking place in Aberdeen this year.</p>

      <p>Stokes followed up his World Cup heroics with a performance for the ages in the third Ashes Test at Headingley with an incredible 135 not out which levelled the series at 1-1.</p>
      <p>Australia ultimately retained the urn in the drawn series, but Stokes’ innings is regarded as one of the greatest of all time.</p>
      <p>Asher-Smith and Johnson-Thompson were the star attractions for Great Britain at the World Athletics Championships in Doha.</p>

      <p>Asher-Smith won gold in the women’s 200 metres in a British record time and also took silver in the 100m, with Johnson-Thompson claiming victory in the heptathlon.</p>
      <p>She set four personal bests as she finally saw off great rival Nafissatou Thiam to secure gold.</p>
      <p>Hamilton secured his sixth F1 drivers’ title earlier this month, and is now just one shy of Michael Schumacher’s all-time record.</p>
      <p>The 2019 success was his third in a row, and his race-wins record currently stands at 83.</p>

      <p>Sterling played a key role as Manchester City secured the domestic treble of Premier League, FA Cup and League Cup in 2019.</p>
      <p>He was voted the Football Writers’ Association Footballer of the Year and has been praised for taking a stand against racism in the game.</p>
      <p>He has also been a key performer for England and looks set to be one of the stars at next summer’s European Championship finals, which conclude at Wembley.</p>

      <p>Jones captained Wales to the Rugby World Cup semi-finals in Japan. The team were eliminated by eventual winners South Africa, but Jones led by example for Warren Gatland’s side.</p>
      <p>He has won 143 caps for Wales and the British and Irish Lions, which puts him five shy of all-time international appearance record-holder Richie McCaw of New Zealand.</p>
      <p>Jones also led Wales to Grand Slam success in the Six Nations earlier this year and was named player of the championship.</p>
