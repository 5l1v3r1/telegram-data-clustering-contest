      <p>Ciara was certainly amped up host Sunday’s American Music Awards.</p>
      <p>During the award ceremony’s red carpet rollout Thursday, the 34-year-old hooked up with rapper Megan Thee Stallion for a quick behind-the-scenes twerk session.</p>
      <p>“Linked up with my Melanin Queen @TheeStallion #Melanin Paahpin! #StrongKneeGame. P.s. @thegirljt and @yungmiami305 verse goes hard ,” wrote the “Dose” singer, 34, on Instagram.</p>

      <p>Ciara and Meg took four steps towards the camera before turning around and twerking while onlookers stood stunned. The song playing was her new single “Melanin,” which features City Girls, Lupita Nyong’o, LaLa Anthony and Ester Dean.</p>
