        <b>Dachung Bagos, a member of the house of representatives from Plateau state, has kicked against the bills seeking to regulate social media and “curb hate speech” in the country.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Addressing journalists in Abuja on Monday, the lawmaker said he rejected the bills following incessant calls and messages from his constituents who reached out to express their reservations over the proposed legislation.</p>
      <p>The protection from internet falsehoods and manipulation and other related matters bill and National Commission for the Prohibition of Hate Speeches bill were both recently introduced in the senate.</p>
      <p>But many Nigerians kicked against the two bills which some claim is an attempt to clamp down on free speech and government criticism.</p>
      <p>In his address, Bagos said the bills are not welcomed by his constituents, and that their provisions have been covered by existing laws.</p>
      <p>He said he had received “series of complaints and objections via text messages, calls, emails, WhatsApp messages and direct contact” with some of his constituents whom kicked against the bills.</p>
      <p>The lawmaker further said: “The views so expressed align with my thoughts and position as the Honourable Member, Representing Jos south/Jos east federal constituency, Plateau state. </p>
      <p>“More so that there are extant laws in our Jurisprudence and under the law of tort like the defamation of character, libel and slander, that addresses the concerns raised by the two bills.</p>
      <p>“Having sworn to an oath to defend the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended), I am herein guided and constraint to categorically and unequivocally state in strong terms, that I and my constituents will not be a party to, nor grant consent to any proposed legislation that will compromise nor subvert the fundamental rights of citizens as enshrined in chapter VI of the Constitution of the Federal Republic Of Nigeria 1999 (As Amended).”</p>
      <p>He said to endorse the bills is “tantamount to taking our dear nation back to the days of anarchy and tyranny.”</p>
