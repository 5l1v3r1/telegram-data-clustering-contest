      <p>Energy Secretary Rick Perry said in an interview with Fox News that U.S. President Donald Trump is "the chosen one."</p>
      <p>Speaking to "Fox &amp; Friends" over the weekend, the former Texas governor said: "God's used imperfect people all through history. King David wasn't perfect. Saul wasn't perfect. Solomon wasn't perfect.” </p>

      <p>“And I actually gave the president a little one-pager on those Old Testament Kings about a month ago and I shared it with him,” he continued. “I said, 'Mr. president, I know there are people that say you said you were the chosen one and I said, 'You were,’" Perry added.</p>
      <p>Perry, who ran against <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/misc/tags/TAG-donald-trump-1.5599319">Trump </a>in the 2016 presidential campaign, said the same thing of former president Barack Obama. "You know, <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/misc/tags/TAG-barack-obama-1.5599045">Barack Obama </a>doesn't get to be the President of the United Sates without being ordained by God. Neither did Donald Trump."</p>
      <p>In January then-White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said God "wanted Donald Trump to become president."</p>

      <p>"That's why he's there and I think he has done a tremendous job in supporting a lot of the things that people of faith really care about," she added. </p>
