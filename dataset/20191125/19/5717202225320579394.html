      <h1>Report: Besiktas to ask to loan Arsenal midfielder Mohamed Elneny again in 2020/21</h1>

      <p>Besiktas will reportedly ask Arsenal to loan midfielder Mohamed Elneny for another season.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.fanatik.com.tr/besiktasta-devre-arasi-operasyonu-2104147">Fanatik report</a> the Turkish giants have been impressed with the Egyptian, who has struck up a good partnership with Atiba Hutchinson.</p>
      <p>After receiving a red card on his debut for the club, Elneny has been in great form since his return and the club have won each of their last four Super Lig matches.</p>

      <p>Apparently the club will not be able to afford the €16 million/£14 million option to buy, and so will ask for the Gunners’ cooperation.</p>
      <p>Elneny was rarely used last season by Unai Emery – the 27-year-old made just 17 appearances, with Lucas Torreira Matteo Guendouzi and Granit Xhaka all ahead of him in the pecking order.</p>
      <h3>TBR’s view – Arsenal should re-negotiate with Besiktas</h3>
      <p>Arsenal should try to work with Besiktas regarding Elneny.</p>

      <p>He may be in good form right now, but realistically £50,000-a-week player Elneny (<a href="https://www.spotrac.com/epl/arsenal-f.c/payroll/">Spotrac</a>) isn’t Arsenal quality and has plenty of chances to prove that he is</p>
      <p>The player’s contract at the Emirates expires in the summer of 2022, and they should be looking to move the player on – even if it means lowering their demand for a permanent transfer.</p>
      <p>He only cost £5 million (<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/35308910">BBC Sport</a>) to sign and the club cannot be expecting to see a huge return on that original investment.</p>
