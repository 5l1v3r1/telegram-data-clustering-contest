      <p>According to <a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20191125PD200.html">Digitimes</a>, Apple has just sent iPhone shipment forecasts for 2020 to its key supply chain partners. Judging by these estimates, the Cupertino-based firm is pretty confident about the iPhone 12 series performance. According to them, the next year’s iPhone series should total over 100 million shipments. This will happen due to the drastic changes being made on the design and the company’s 5G debut.</p>
      <p>It’s curious to see that <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/Apple">Apple</a> is pretty confident despite the overall slowdown of the global smartphone shipments in the past year. Apple predicted 80 million sales of its iPhone 11 series. With the iPhone 12 series, the tech giant expects to see a bigger demand moved by the new design and the 5G capabilities. Apple has chosen to skip 5G support in 2019, however, with a broader global rollout of 5G happening in the next year, we can see why the company has opted for not being one of the 5G beta-testing companies.</p>

      <p>Apparently, seems that Apple is ignoring the sales that have been stagnating over the past years. Perhaps, the company is just too confident about this new design. According to rumors, the iPhone 12 will be a throwback in the iPhone 4/5 era. Moreover, recent leaks indicate that the company will release four iPhones in the next year.  The iPhone 12, 12 Pro, 12 Pro Max and the long-awaited iPhone SE 2. The Pro models may switch to high-quality 120Hz ProMotion OLED displays with smaller notches. They should also come with a 3D ToF camera around the back and the A14 Bionic SoC paired with 6GB of RAM. The SE 2, on the other hand, may come in an iPhone 8 disguise. Despite this, it will boast a modern A13 Bionic chipset and 3 GB RAM.</p>
