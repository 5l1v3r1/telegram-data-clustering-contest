      <p>Please attribute to Waitemata Acting District Commander Inspector Shanan Gray:</p>
      <p>Police observed a suspicious vehicle at 5.08pm in Massey, West Auckland after it was seen leaving an address of interest.</p>
      <p>The vehicle failed to stop after it was signalled to do so and a pursuit was initiated.</p>
      <p>A short time later the fleeing vehicle collided with a cyclist on Don Buck Road and continued on without stopping.</p>
      <p>The cyclist has sustained serious injuries and has been transported to hospital.</p>
      <p>The vehicle involved was located concealed several kilometres from the crash scene and the driver was taken into custody without further incident.</p>
      <p>A 25-year-old man has been charged with driving offences and other unrelated charges and will appear in Waitakere District Court tomorrow morning.</p>
