      <h1>ESPN Analyst Releases Score Prediction For Ohio State-Michigan</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T19:22:08+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 19:22</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>The Game is now less than a week away. Ohio State and Michigan will meet in Ann Arbor on Saturday afternoon. While the stakes might not be as high as normal from a national perspective- the Buckeyes can lose this game and still make the playoff – they’re always monumental for those inside the respective programs.</p>
      <p>Ohio State is entering the game as a sizable favorite. The Buckeyes opened as a 9-point favorite heading into the game.</p>
      <p>ESPN analyst Bill Connelly <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/28156003/everything-need-know-college-football-rivalry-week">has released his S&amp;P prediction</a>.</p>
      <p>The formula actually likes the Buckeyes to cover.</p>
      <blockquote>Michigan could complete a stirring second-half turnaround by pulling off its first win over the Buckeyes in eight years — not to mention Jim Harbaugh’s first since he was the Wolverines’ QB in 1986 — and putting a dent into their rivals’ national title stock. More likely, Ohio State could send the school up north back into the existential crisis from which it has recently begun to emerge. Either way, it’s going to be a hell of a show.<br/><br/><b>SP+ projection:</b> Ohio St. 30, Michigan 19</blockquote>
      <p>Jim Harbaugh has yet to beat Ohio State since taking the Michigan job. He’s hoping that will change on Saturday.</p>
      <p>“We’re very aware of the rivalry, having played in it, having coached in it. I grew up here. My dad was a coach. As I liken the Michigan State game to a state championship, this is even bigger,” he said.</p>
      <p>Ohio State and Michigan will kick off at noon E.T. on FOX.</p>
