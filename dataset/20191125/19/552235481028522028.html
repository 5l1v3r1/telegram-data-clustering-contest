      <h2>The link-up appears far more than lip service and there's plenty of reasons for optimism for the Dons faithful ahead of their move to Kingsford.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T19:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 19:00</time> by <a rel="author">Graeme Young, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/graeme-young/</a></address>
      <p>Supporters all over the world dream of a Utopian matchday experience following the team they love</p>
      <p>And why not? Punters pay a pretty penny supporting their heroes and clubs should always strive to deliver the best they can for the lifeblood of the beautiful game.</p>
      <p>Our game's foot soldiers have mobilised this season as they rail against ticket prices and the substandard experience of travelling the length and breadth of the country.</p>
      <p>Controversial government policies have been challenged in recent years with supporters believing they are victims of a nanny state when inside stadiums.</p>

      <p>Revoking a Scottish football booze ban is something many crave but most would settle for a decent pie and the feeling their voices are being heard.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/aberdeen-fc">Aberdeen</a> diehards are certainly no different and there's a buzz in the north east with <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/dave-cormack">Dave Cormack</a> taking the reins at Pittodrie. The US-based businessman certainly brings a Stateside swagger to proceedings.</p>
      <p>The Granite City native is back in his hometown as he looks to shake Scottish football up after succeeding <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/stewart-milne">Stewart Milne</a> who is exiting stage left after 21 years at the helm.</p>
      <p>And Cormack certainly hasn't arrived unarmed as he looks to battle Celtic and Rangers for supremacy in the Premiership.</p>
      <p>Major League Soccer side Atlanta United's parent company, AMB Sports and Entertainment, are putting in £2m into the Dons as part of a £5m investment package to boost <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/derek-mcinnes">Derek McInnes'</a> side.</p>
      <p>A link has been forged and it looks set to grow in the coming years but it already appeared in the works. Jon Gallagher arrived at the Dons on loan before the start of the season and former Aberdeen star Stephen Glass is currently Atlanta's reserve manager.</p>
      <p>Long gone are the days of teams from across the Atlantic being viewed with disdain. The MLS is a progressive league that has rapidly built its fanbase with a mix of marquee signings and superior social media usage.</p>

      <p>Atlanta United, who only made their debut at the start of the 2017 season, are the flag bearers for how a modern team or, cough, franchise should be built from the ground up.</p>
      <p>And it all starts with the supporters.</p>
      <p>Owner Arthur Blank, who has a £5billion personal wealth, is revered for his measured approach at the helm of the city's NFL team the Atlanta Falcons and understands implicitly the importance of making supporters feel immersed in the club they love.</p>
      <p>United are based at the state-of-the-art Mercedes-Benz Stadium and enjoy the biggest average attendance in the league with 52,000 supporters flocking to every home game.</p>
      <p>The greater Atlanta metropolitan area is one of the most diverse Stateside and the insatiable appetite for the sport was already there before the arrival of their own team.</p>

      <p>But you have to find a way to make it work and every fan who heads through the turnstiles is treated with respect and that's reflected with the club's pricing plan for food and drink.</p>
      <p>Hot Dogs cost $2.50 and and a fizzy drink setting punters back $2. It's the American dream and it's something Cormack will be acutely aware with the Dons nearing their move to their own shiny new stadium.</p>
      <p>Aberdeen, already reaping the benefits of their shiny new training facilities named after their new chairman, are set to head to Kingsford to play their games in front of 20,000 supporters from 2023.</p>
      <p>The £50m development is all part of the plan to help the Dons cut the gap on the big two on Glasgow as they maintain their desire to become a top 100 UEFA club.</p>

      <p>Cormack, who lives in Atlanta, will have the chance to implement the ideas which have proved so successful for Aberdeen's new partners.</p>
      <p>But the United blueprint goes way beyond kindness at the kiosks and the technology entrepreneur knows full well innovation on the pitch can reap rewards.</p>
      <p>Atlanta romped to MLS Cup glory in their second season under the guidance of former Barcelona boss Tata Martino and reached the semi-finals under ex-Rangers star Frank De Boer during the 2019 season.</p>

      <p>Stellar recruitment landed Miguel Almiron before the Paraguay international was then sold to Newcastle for an eye-watering £20m in January of this year.</p>
      <p>And what about Josef Martinez? The Venezuelan striker is a goal machine and will almost certainly be on a host of European sides' radar when the January transfer window opens.</p>
      <p>But first and foremost there's an opportunity for the Dons to learn from their associates when it comes to fan experience.</p>
      <p>In fact, it's something every team should look to master.</p>
