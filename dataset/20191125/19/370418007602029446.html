      <p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/m%C3%B6tley-cr%C3%BCe/">Mötley Crüe</a> delighted fans and venue owners to no end with the announcement that <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/the-news/m%C3%B6tley-cr%C3%BCe-release-official-statement-announcing-their-return/">they’d decided to reunite, despite saying they’d never do so</a>. Shortly after that, an interview was uncovered from around the time of the band’s final tour in which guitarist Mick Mars said that if <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/the-news/mick-mars-once-said-he-would-invite-the-world-to-come-for-free-if-m%C3%B6tley-cr%C3%BCe-reunited/">they ever did reunite, he would invite “the world to come for free.”</a> Now, Mick has addressed the comment, calling it a joke and claiming that he honestly never expected this reunion to happen.</p>
      <p>In a post on his Instagram, Mick wrote the following: “While I was clearly joking about the free tickets that night on TMS, I was also deeply convinced that we would never ever be touring again. I would never have expected to be facing a whole new generation of fans demanding to see us play. In fact, touring with Mötley Crüe comes at a weird time, since my solo record is almost complete after such a long time of writing and recording. But, I put our fans first. Anyways, I am eating a lot of crow and humble pie this Thanksgiving for those remarks and accept that some of you see this as me being dishonest. I said what I said and I was wrong. Peace.”</p>

      <p>For the record, here’s the clip from the original interview:</p>

      <p>It’s big of Mick to admit he was wrong…though it feels a little odd that he says he’s doing this to “put our fans first.” Wouldn’t making the reunion tour free put the fans first? If the concern is the fans first and foremost, why not make the entire tour free, or charge $5 a ticket, so that more fans can have more access to the band? One assumes tickets to the band’s reunion tour will be significantly more expensive.</p>

      <p>The post is in keeping with the Crüe’s official statement announcing their return, in which the band claimed that their reunion was based on wanting to give a new generation of fans the Mötley Crüe live experience.</p>
      <p><i>“Vince, Nikki, Mick and Tommy didn’t come together again until 2018 to participate in the making of THE DIRT movie,” </i>wrote the band, “<i>which unexpectedly brought them closer together again including seeing them head back into the recording studio after having gone in their own directions for several years. The fuse was lit.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“Since playing Tommy Lee in The Dirt, so many of my fans have said how they wish they could’ve seen the real Mötley Crüe play live,” said Colson Baker (aka Machine Gun Kelly) “I never thought I would see the day when this would become a reality. But the fans spoke and Mötley Crüe listened!”</i>
      </p>
      <p>Stay tuned for Mötley Crüe’s reunion tour’s dates when they’re released.</p>
