      <h1>Sega Genesis Mini gets $30 price cut for Black Friday</h1>
      <h2>Retro gaming for just $49.99</h2>

      <h4>Attention to detail: In terms of aesthetics, the Genesis Mini is a home run. The feet on the bottom of the system could have a bit more grip and the three-button controllers should have been six-button variants but otherwise, everything is about as top notch as one could expect – right down to the mock expansion ports that accept visual accessories.</h4>
      <p>Sega’s Genesis Mini retro console is now available at the lowest price we’ve ever seen. If you were waiting for a price reduction, now might be the time to buy.</p>
      <p>The Genesis Mini launched on September 19, 2019, to mostly favorable reviews. The $79.99 console shipped with 42 pre-installed games including fan favorites like ToeJam &amp; Earl, Comix Zone, Earthworm Jim, Ecco the Dolphin, Sonic the Hedgehog 2 and Road Rash II, just to name a few.</p>

      <p>In Japan, Sega even launched a “<a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/80366-sega-announces-final-12-games-genesis-mini.html">mini tower</a>” of non-functional accessories to add to the console. The complete kit includes a replica Sega CD (the Mega CD), a 32X and a couple of cartridges to plug into the top of the 32X. Unfortunately, Sega hasn’t released the kit for North American markets and only sent out a few examples to select members of the press.</p>
      <p>The pre-Black Friday sale over at Amazon features the Genesis Mini for just <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sega-Genesis-Mini/dp/B07PFT19MG/?tag=httpwwwtechsp-20">$49.99</a>, or roughly $30 off its normal list price. That’s the lowest price you’re likely to find before the holidays – remember, this isn’t the ill-fated PlayStation Classic so don’t expect prices to <a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/80804-playstation-classic-hits-all-time-low-price-2499.html">plummet</a> like they did with Sony's system.</p>
