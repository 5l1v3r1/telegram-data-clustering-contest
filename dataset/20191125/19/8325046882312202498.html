        <li><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/popeyes">Popeyes</a> launched a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/popeyes-chicken-sandwich-vs-chick-fil-a-which-is-better-2019-8">fried-chicken sandwich</a> in August.</li>
        <li>After a Twitter spat with <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/chick-fil-a">Chick-fil-A</a> went viral, Popeyes’ sandwich exploded in popularity.</li>
        <li>Popeyes employees across the nation were <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/popeyes-workers-describe-chicken-sandwich-demand-chaos-2019-8">sent into overdrive</a> as many worked nearly 60-hour weeks to fulfill orders. The sandwich <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/popeyes-chicken-sandwich-is-sold-out-after-demand-soars-2019-8">sold out</a> across the country after being available for just two weeks.</li>
        <li>Following a nearly two-month hiatus, the sandwich returned on <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/popeyes-chicken-sandwich-returns-chick-fil-a-battle-2019-10">Sunday, November 3</a>. And, in some cases, tensions escalated. Police confirmed that a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/popeyes-chicken-sandwich-return-linked-to-violent-incidents-list-2019-11">deadly stabbing</a> was connected to the relaunch of the sandwich.</li>
        <li>Here’s how a spat between two fast-food chains devolved into a civil war among sandwich-crazed customers.</li>

      <p>Life was simpler in the early days of the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/chicken-sandwich-war">Chicken Sandwich Wars.</a></p>
      <p>The choice, though divisive, was clear. You were either for Chick-fil-A or Popeyes. And though still a war in the most basic sense, most of the battles were confined to snarky tweets and comments on social media. It was a simpler time, for the most part.</p>
      <p>The war started when Popeyes added a chicken sandwich to its menu in August. Chick-fil-A, the self-proclaimed inventor of the chicken sandwich, had built an entire empire around poultry, sandwiched and otherwise, for <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-chick-fil-a-took-over-america-2019-8">years.</a></p>
      <p>Popeyes was the underdog in this battle. Still, the chain’s move threatened Chick-fil-A’s dominance on the chicken sandwich scene. Business Insider’s <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/author/irene-jiang">Irene Jiang</a> even <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/chick-fil-a-mcdonalds-wendys-kfc-popeyes-best-chicken-sandwich-2019-8?utm_source=reddit.com#bun-the-potato-bun-was-very-sweet-and-flavorful-but-crumbled-under-the-weight-of-its-contents-texture-a-thin-layer-of-breading-still-made-for-a-solid-consistent-crisp-the-chicken-was-juicy-and-the-pickles-were-thick-and-crunchy-23">proclaimed the Popeyes sandwich</a> the superior option before it went viral.</p>
      <p>But then, some Popeyes fans began to turn on each other, and tensions escalated.</p>
      <p>Here’s how a spat between two fast-food chains devolved into a civil war among sandwich-crazed customers.</p>

      <h3>The battle begins</h3>

      <p>The tension between Popeyes and Chick-fil-A hit Twitter on August 19, when a spat between the two chains turned Popeyes’ menu item into a national icon, forcing fast-food consumers to pick a side in what became the Chicken Sandwich War of 2019.</p>
      <p>Despite the popularity of the Popeyes sandwich, Chick-fil-A devotees still pledged their allegiance to the chain.</p>

      <p>But Popeyes was still gaining ground. And the divisions between the two chains were growing wider.</p>

      <h3>The tension escalates</h3>

      <p>What began as an inter-chain fast-food frenzy started to escalate as the sandwich got more popular. Sandwich-crazed fans went to extraordinary lengths to get a chance to taste the item that was poised to take down Chick-fil-A. The lines were massive, the demand almost insatiable.</p>
      <p>In the first iteration of the sandwich, Popeyes employees across the nation were <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/popeyes-workers-describe-chicken-sandwich-demand-chaos-2019-8">sent into overdrive</a>, as many worked nearly 60-hour weeks to fulfill orders.</p>
      <p>Around this time, things started to get violent.</p>
      <p>“I had customers nearly fight some of my coworkers because they were told that we were not serving the sandwich because we had ran out,” a manager at an East Coast Popeyes <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/popeyes-workers-describe-chicken-sandwich-demand-chaos-2019-8">told</a> Business Insider in August.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>The war turns civil</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>After the item sold out in August, the madness compounded.</p>
      <p>An angry customer pulled out a gun at a Popeyes in Houston, Texas, apparently after hearing that the sandwich was sold out in early September, local news <a href="https://abc13.com/people-with-gun-demand-popeyes-chicken-sandwiches-/5510088/">reported</a>.</p>
      <p>“He could have shot someone behind a chicken sandwich,” Fredrick Taylor, a resident who lives near the Houston Popeyes, <a href="https://abc13.com/people-with-gun-demand-popeyes-chicken-sandwiches-/5510088/">told</a> local news. “Somebody could have lost their life because they ran out of chicken sandwiches.”</p>
      <p>By the time the sandwich relaunched in November, the players in the war between Popeyes and Chick-fil-A had gone rogue. Popeyes fans turned against their neighbors, and the violence mushroomed into a full-out civil war.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>And then it got deadly</h3>

      <p>Since the sandwich’s relaunch, the violent incidents <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/popeyes-chicken-sandwich-return-linked-to-violent-incidents-list-2019-11">have continued</a>. Many have resulted from agitated customers wanting to get their hands on the coveted menu item.</p>
      <p>Perhaps the worst altercation linked to the sandwich happened the day after its official re-release, when an altercation between two men in line at a Popeyes in Oxon Hill, Maryland, ended in a fatal stabbing. Police confirmed that the incident was related to the release of the sandwich at the restaurant.</p>
      <p>“For you to get that angry over anything, for that type of anger to develop into this type of violence, is a very sad and tragic day,” <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/maryland-stabbing-linked-to-return-of-popeyes-chicken-sandwich-police-2019-11">said</a> Jennifer Donelan, a spokeswoman for the Prince George’s County Police Department.</p>
      <p>“There is no reason for someone to lose their life on a Monday night in a parking lot,” Popeyes said in a statement. “Our thoughts are with the victim’s family and friends and we are fully cooperating with local authorities.”</p>

      <h3>All this for a sandwich?</h3>

      <p>At this point, Chick-fil-A is but a distant memory in the the Chicken Sandwich War of 2019, a supporting character that served its purpose in the first act of the drama.</p>
      <p>Now, the battle pits Popeyes fans against their peers.</p>
      <p>The sandwich hype has yet to fully die down. But amid a fatal stabbing and multiple <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/popeyes-chicken-sandwich-return-linked-to-violent-incidents-list-2019-11#the-video-showed-two-women-throwing-food-trays-at-one-another-8">reports</a> of physical brawls and assault, one can only wonder if the sandwich is more than just a case of viral mania gone wrong.</p>
