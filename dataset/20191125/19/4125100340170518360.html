      <p>“I was raped by an armed robber in 2004, it wasn’t my fault and not an incident that warrants me taking up microphone about, so I set up an advocacy group to address it.</p>
      <p>“The group is to manage the young and old ones who had been through the same ugly incident like me. I know if I had to go all out to media about the situation, it will fizzle out.</p>

      <p>The multi-talented, actor, producer, director and writer, Ibru urged Nollywood stakeholders to be professional in their conduct, adding that the industry needed the touch of core professionals.</p>

      <p>“What I can bring to the table for my colleagues is that they must be professional with their jobs as much as possible.</p>
