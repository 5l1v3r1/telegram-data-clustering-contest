      <p>Future of Work priorities released</p>
      <p>The Future of Work Tripartite Assessment identifies the priorities for NZ’s working future, says BusinessNZ Chief Executive Kirk Hope.</p>
      <p>The Future of Work Forum - a partnership of Government, BusinessNZ and the CTU - today outlined some of the issues that will impact NZ over the next 30 years, and the steps required by Government, business and unions to create opportunities from the changes.</p>
      <p>Kirk Hope says many skills that are needed now will soon become obsolete.<br/>"Work and workplaces are becoming automated, and workplaces are becoming organised in different ways.</p>
      <p>"Without appropriate action, there’s the danger of income inequality, lower employment standards and possible job loss," Kirk Hope said.</p>
      <p>"Our challenge is to create systems that can effectively support workplace transformation. Education, welfare and health systems all need to be aligned with the changing world of work."</p>
      <p>"The Forum is action orientated towards solving these challenges collaboratively. It was great to see more resources put in to employer-led literacy and numeracy by the Government in recognition of the benefits to both business and workers of strengthening the foundation skills of the workforce," Mr Hope said.<br/>ENDS</p>
