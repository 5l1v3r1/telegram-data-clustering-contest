      <h1>Buying a Chromebook on Black Friday could be a very bad idea if you don't do your research</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T19:16:39+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 19:16</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/author/corbin-davenport/" target="_blank">Corbin Davenport</a></address>
      <p>This <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/11/19/black-friday-2019/">Black Friday</a>, there will be a lot of deals on Chromebooks. In fact, there already are a few <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/11/19/black-friday-2019/#Chromebooks">early discounts</a> from Google, HP, and others. Before you pull the trigger on a new Chrome-powered laptop, there's one critically-important factor that most product listings will leave off: the end-of-life date.</p>
      <p>Chromebooks don't get indefinite updates, like PCs. While you can run the latest build of Windows 10 on some computers built a decade ago (or longer), every Chromebook model has a fixed support life. The exact lifespan depends on a few different factors, but new models typically have around 5-7 years of software support starting from the release date.</p>

        <i>Expiration dates for Google's Chromebooks</i>
      </p>
      <p><b>The first thing you should do when considering a Chromebook is to look it up on <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/6220366?hl=en">Google's Auto Update Policy</a></b><a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/6220366?hl=en"> page</a>, which lists the end-of-support date for every Chromebook ever released. Once a Chromebook reaches the expiration date, it probably won't get any more Chrome OS updates. That means no new features, and more importantly, no more security patches.</p>
      <blockquote>If your Chromebook no longer receives updates, you become more vulnerable to a rogue site or Android app stealing your data.</blockquote>
      <p>You might be thinking to yourself, "Do I really need security updates on this $100 laptop?" The answer is <i>yes</i>. Chrome regularly patches <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/03/06/update-your-browser-right-now-google-releases-fix-for-zero-day-exploit-in-chrome/">security</a> <a href="https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/google-chrome-zeroday-wizardopium/29126/">flaws</a> that are already being used in the wild (referred to as "zero-day exploits"), and if your Chromebook no longer receives updates, you become more vulnerable to a rogue site or Android app stealing your data.</p>
      <p>The other problem is that retailers are still selling Chromebooks released several years ago, which now have a limited lifespan. You might even run into sites selling refurbished/used models that are <i>already past</i> their expiration date. Here are a few examples of things you should <i>not</i> buy:</p>
      <p>
        <b>Asus C200MA from Newegg, updates ended in June 2019:</b>
      </p>

        <b>Samsung Chromebook XE303C12 from Rakuten, updates ended in July 2018:</b>
      </p>

      <p>Most product listings have the date somewhere in the description, which you can then search for on the Auto Update Policy page. If the model name isn't listed, that's probably a sign the seller is trying to obscure how much life the Chromebook has left.</p>
      <p>So, this Black Friday (and Cyber Monday, and non-denominational Winter holiday), <b>don't buy a Chromebook unless you know when it will stop receiving updates</b>. Having your passwords and bank information stolen by hackers isn't worth saving a few bucks. If your budget is extremely tight, consider something like <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/SAMSUNG-11-6-Chromebook-3-16GB-eMMC-4GB-RAM-Metallic-Black-XE500C13-K04US/796891786">this Samsung Chromebook 3 for $99</a> (starting 11/27), which will get updates until mid-2022.</p>
