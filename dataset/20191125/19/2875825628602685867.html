      <p>"I think it's good that he's in public eye because there's so many people out there who are scared, they don't know how to cope or they don't go out because they think people might look at them.</p>
      <p>"Why should Harvey be hidden away? Everyone loves him, he's got such a following. Just because of his disabilities why should be be treated any different?"</p>
      <p>In another scene she asked Harvey if he knew what his new role as an ambassador meant.</p>
