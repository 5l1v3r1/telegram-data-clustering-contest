      <p>Toronto Maple Leafs forward Alex Kerfoot was suspended two games for his hit on Colorado Avalanche defenseman Erik Johnson, the NHL’s Department of Safety announced Monday.</p>
      <p>Johnson’s cross-check to Johnson from behind caused his former teammate to crash into the boards with 2:44 remaining in the second period of Saturday’s game. Johnson was assessed a minor penalty for boarding on the play.</p>
      <p>“First and foremost, I think I’m disappointed in myself,” Kerfoot said Monday, per TSN. “It was obviously a bad play. I know Johnson well and I just hope he’s all right. I hope that he doesn’t miss any time or anything like that. I feel terrible.</p>
      <p>“He kind of unfortunately lost possession right as I was pushing him and then he stumbles and I pushed him into the boards. It’s no excuse. It was unfortunate timing but it was also a bad play by me and I just hope he’s all right.”</p>
      <p>Kerfoot spent the previous two seasons as Johnson’s teammate with the Avalanche before being traded to the Maple Leafs on July 1 along with defenseman Tyson Barrie and a 2020 sixth-round selection. Colorado received forward Nazem Kadri, defenseman Calle Rosen and a 2020 third-round draft pick in the deal.</p>
      <p>The 25-year-old Kerfoot has collected five goals and three assists in 22 games this season. He has recorded 39 goals and 54 assists in 179 career games with Colorado and Toronto.</p>
