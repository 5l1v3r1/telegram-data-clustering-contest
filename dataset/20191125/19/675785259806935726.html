      <h2>Australian Koala Foundation and the country's Prime Minister Scott Morrison have called on more to be done to protect koalas, of which 1,000 died in the recent bushfires</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T19:45:15+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 19:45</time> by <a rel="author">Nada Farhoud, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/nada-farhoud/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/animals">Koalas</a> may be "functionally extinct" because of Australia’s devastating drought and bushfires.</p>
      <p>More than 1,000 koalas are thought to have died in the fires which have killed six people since October.</p>
      <p>Slow-moving koalas, who curl up in trees to avoid danger, have been trapped by flames and heard to yelp in distress.</p>
      <p>Fires engulfing more than 3.7 million acres of eastern Australia have also destroyed 80% of their habitat.</p>
      <p>Eucalyptus tree leaves are a koala’s main source of nutrients, an adult can eat up to 2lb of leaves a day.</p>
      <p>But Eucalyptus take months to re-grow after a fire, so many of the marsupials could starve.</p>

      <p>Deborah Tabart, of the Australian Koala Foundation, is urging action from Australia’s Prime Minister Scott Morrison.</p>
      <p>Deborah said: “If we combine all of the estimated deaths of koalas in the bushfires, there could be 1,000 koalas which have been killed in the last two months.</p>
      <p>“Functionally extinct means a koala living today might have one joey and that joey may or may not have a joey, if they don’t, that’s functionally extinct.</p>

      <p>“We think there’s no more than 16-18,000 koalas in the whole of New South Wales. So to lose a population of that size in a stronghold is disastrous."</p>
      <p>Professor Chris Dickman, an ecology expert at Sydney University, said hearing koalas’ yelps is a sign things are going badly wrong.</p>
      <p>"Koalas don't make noise much of the time," he said.</p>
      <p>"Males only make booming noises during mating season. Other than that they're quiet animals. So hearing their yelps is a pretty bad sign things are going catastrophically wrong for these animals."</p>
