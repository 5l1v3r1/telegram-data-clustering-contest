      <p>An emotional Andy Murray has spoken about the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/dunblane">Dunblane</a> school massacre for the first time and revealed how he knew evil killer Thomas Hamilton as a child.</p>
      <p>Both <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/andy-murray">Andy</a> and brother Jamie were in the school during the infamous massacre and knew Hamilton - sometimes sharing a car with the monster and attending his kids' clubs in their home town of Dunblane.</p>
      <p>The sporting legend also revealed how tennis helped him deal with the tragedy and later the trauma of his parents' divorce.</p>
      <p>The rare comments come in a tearful recorded message featured in a new documentary film about his recovery from injury called Andy Murray: Resurfacing.</p>

      <p>The world premier of the movie was held at the Curzon Bloomsbury in London on Monday night with Andy's wife Kim, brother Jamie and mum Judy at the screenin g with the two-time Wimbledon champion.</p>
      <p>Former world No.1 Murray has only previously briefly mentioned the Dunblane tragedy on a BBC programme in 2013.</p>
      <p>And the Scot could not speak face-to-face about the painful experiences in the new film - and he instead left a voicemail for the director.</p>

      <p>In the recording Murray, 32, opens up about the Dunblane Primary School shooting in March 1996 when Thomas Hamilton shot 16 children and one teacher dead before committing suicide.</p>
      <p>He also speaks about the series of events that hit him as a child around the same time - including the divorce of his parents Judy and William and his big brother Jamie leaving home to pursue his own tennis dreams.</p>
      <p>He told film-maker Olivia Cappuccini: “You asked me a while ago why tennis was important to me. Obviously I had the thing that happened at Dunblane. When I was around nine.</p>

      <p>“I am sure for all the kids there it would be difficult for different reasons. The fact we knew the guy, we went to his kids club, he had been in our car, we had driven and dropped him off at train stations and things. Within 12 months of that happening, our parents got <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/divorce">divorced</a>.</p>
      <p>“It was a difficult time that for kids. To see that and not quite understand what is going on. And then six to 12 months after that, my brother also moved away from home. He went away to train to play tennis in Cambridge.</p>

      <p>“We obviously used to do everything together. When he moved away that was also quite hard for me. Around that time and after that, for a year or so, I had lots of anxiety but that came out when I was playing tennis. When I was competing I would get really bad breathing problems.</p>
      <p>“My feeling towards tennis is that it’s an escape for me in some ways. Because all of these things are stuff that I have bottled up. I don’t know because we don’t talk about these things. They are not things that are discussed.</p>

      <p>“The way that I am, on the tennis court, I show some positive things about my personality and I also show the bad things and things I really hate. Tennis allows me to be that child, that has all of these questions and that’s why tennis is important to me.”</p>
      <p>The feature-length documentary includes gruesome footage of the double Olympic champion undergoing a second hip surgery in London in January – and interviews with fellow stars Roger Federer and Rafa Nadal.</p>

      <p>But in December 2018, when he feared his career was over because of his chronic hip injury, he left a voicemail for director Olivia Cappuccini which revealed for the first time how tennis helped him cope with the most trying moments in his life – and how he suffered anxiety and breathing problems during his teenage years.</p>
      <p>Filmmaker Cappuccini is the girlfriend of Andy’s wife Kim Murray’s brother Scott – and Murray trusted her so much he did not even ask to see the film before the premiere in London.</p>

      <p>Murray said: “I obviously spent a lot of time with the lady who was filming it.</p>
      <p>"You were getting asked a lot of questions all the time. We were travelling together for quite a while, spending weeks on end together, and I was getting asked questions like 'Why is tennis important? Why is it important to you?'</p>
      <p>“At the beginning, I was like: ‘Well, it is. It’s important to me. I know I am very fortunate I get to play, and very lucky that this is what I get to do for my living. It’s important for me for other reasons. And I don’t want to talk to you about it. Maybe I will tell you later on. I don’t want to discuss it'.</p>
      <p>“And then as things were getting worse and stuff, it started to look like it coming towards the end of playing. I was trying to explain why this was so difficult for me.</p>
      <p>“It was in December 2018 when I was in Miami and I had spoken with my team about it: ‘I cannot play anymore. I don’t want to play anymore, I am not enjoying this. I can’t keep doing it’. I guess she was trying to understand why.</p>
      <p>“She was there with us in Miami and I was like: ‘Look, I am not talking to you about this to your face.’ One, I feel a bit embarrassed about it. And two I have not really spoken to anyone that much about it ever. So, that was kind of how that came about.”</p>

      <p>Cappuccini said: “I never actually brought it up. It was completely from him. Why would you? I’m making a film about someone who is rehabbing and that’s buried deep in a space in his heart and mind, there’s no need for it.</p>
      <p>“But I think at the time where he’s wrestling with his identity and the prospect of it all being over and what tennis meant for him. When he went into that which I hope was quite cathartic for him in the moment and I hope did him some good getting it off his chest.”</p>
      <p>Producer and director Cappuccini added: “Andy hasn’t even seen the film the whole way through. Kim has seen it but she’s only watched two cuts of it. At no stage did she say that’s a bit too sensitive. We were prepared for that.</p>
      <p>“There are some very raw moments in there that are close to the bone for the family and I’m amazed that we were able to keep them in in the way we wanted to.”</p>

      <p>But Murray admitted: “It’s difficult for me. Not because I’m watching it thinking this isn’t good. The last two years for me were difficult.</p>
      <p>“When I’m doing a lot of the interviews and being asked questions, because I was comfortable with the lady who was filming it, you open up as it goes along and feel more comfortable talking about your issues and how you are feeling.</p>
      <p>“And then obviously as the documentary gets closer, you realise at the time that you are really vulnerable. I don’t like watching myself on camera for a start. Also, seeing myself like that is difficult at times.</p>

      <p>“I didn’t want to censor it - it was actually the opposite because I was like, I don’t want to watch this and be like ‘I don’t like that bit, I want to change this bit’. I didn’t want it to be like that. I trusted the people who had matched it and made it. I was sure they will do a very good job.</p>
      <p>“I lived it as well, I know what it was like and I know how it was for me so I didn’t want to watch it and say this bit needs to change. I didn’t want it to be like that.”</p>
