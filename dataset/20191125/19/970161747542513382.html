        <b>Emmerdale has confirmed that shady businessman Al Chapman (Michael Wildman) is out of his depth and owes a lot of money to some very dangerous people – and now that Dawn Taylor (Olivia Bromley) has overheard an incriminating exchange, she could expose him to Kim Tate (Claire King) and also Billy Fletcher (Jay Kontzle).</b>
      </p>
      <p>Al has been on edge recently and taking his frustrations out on Billy and, after he was attacked from behind with a metal pipe and left out cold, he told <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jai-sharma/">Jai Sharma</a> (<a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/chris-bisson/">Chris Bisson</a>) and Dawn that Billy must have been responsible.</p>
      <p>Kim was wary about being connected with Al as she feared he was a liability but as he insisted that this was a family member but also refused to involve the police, Dawn waded in and confronted a shocked Billy.</p>
      <p>It soon became clear that Billy had no idea what she was talking about and, determined to get to the bottom of Al’s deceit, she followed him to the scrapyard, where he was sitting in his car, looking anxious.</p>

      <p>Before long, another car pulled up, with two dodgy men inside reminding Al that he owed money and promising that next time, the attack would kill him. Ali threw £5000 at them but the loan shark told him that this wasn’t even close to being enough to what he needed to pay back.</p>
      <p>As his cohort advanced on a shaken Al, he told them that his car was worth £50k and handed them the keys. The gangster responded that they would take the value as £20k and he still had more to pay off – and soon.</p>
      <p>As Dawn watched in horror, realising how much trouble Al is in and how this could impact Billy and also Ellis, will she come clean about what she has seen?</p>
      <p>Or will she confront Al and be persuaded to keep quiet?</p>
