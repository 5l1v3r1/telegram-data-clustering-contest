      <h1>AMD confirms 64-core Threadripper 3990X coming in 2020 for VFX pros</h1>
      <h2>'More details still to come'</h2>

      <h4>In a nutshell: AMD off-handedly confirmed it would launch the Ryzen Threadripper 3990X in 2020. The ultra-high-end desktop processor will pack in 64 cores and 128 threads, and still have a TDP about the same as current third-gen offerings. It will likely be priced out of the range of most consumers, though.</h4>
      <p>A presentation slide for AMD’s <a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/82414-next-gen-threadripper-rumored-arrive-november-19.html">rumored</a> Ryzen Threadripper 3990X leaked on Twitter Monday morning. The HEDT processor features 64 cores/128 threads, 288MB total cache, and a TDP of 280W.</p>
      <p>AMD did not mention clock speeds. However, with double the core count and a 280W TDP that <a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/82663-amd-3rd-gen-threadripper-now-official-starting.html">is on par</a> with its 3970X, it might be comparatively under-clocked to keep temperatures under control, but that is purely speculation.</p>
      <aside>"More details still to come, of course, but it’s not difficult to imagine how outrageously fast the 3990X will be for the highly scalable workloads of a VFX pro."</aside>
      <p>The company, which was not planning to unveil the CPU until January, <a href="https://community.amd.com/community/gaming/blog/2019/11/25/something-for-everyone-this-november-with-amd-ryzen-9-3950x-3rd-gen-threadripper-and-athlon-3000g-processors">confirmed</a> the 3990X is coming next year in a press release for the Ryzen 9 3950X. The company says that it is targeting “Hollywood creators” with the chip, specifically VFX studios. What this means is that it will probably be quite expensive. AMD’s 32-core 3970X is currently around $2,000, so we can expect it to be quite a bit higher than that.</p>
      <p>Despite being out of reach for the average consumer, AMD has been steadily increasing core counts in its more affordable consumer-level processors. Advancements in the HEDT market always trickle down. So we could see the 3990X or a more consumer-friendly 64-core variant in a few years.</p>
      <p>AMD promised it would be releasing more details on the 3990X soon.</p>
