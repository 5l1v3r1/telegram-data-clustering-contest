      <p>JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu does not have to step aside after being indicted for alleged corruption, the country’s attorney general ruled on Monday, a reprieve for the conservative leader as he fights for his political survival.</p>
      <p>The bribery, fraud and breach of trust charges filed against Netanyahu on Thursday - the first criminal indictment of a sitting Israeli premier - prompted calls for his departure from the center-left opposition and a watchdog group, as well as stirring up leadership challenges from within his Likud party.</p>
      <p>Israeli law does not require Netanyahu to step down at this stage. He denies wrongdoing and has vowed to stay in power - even though his position is already in doubt after he and rival Benny Gantz failed to get a majority in two elections this year.</p>
      <p>Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit on Monday convened his senior staff to discuss if Netanyahu should be declared temporarily unfit for office, a status that would require he resign or take a leave of absence, the Justice Ministry said.</p>
      <p>Citing, among other considerations, the fact the Netanyahu heads a caretaker government, Mandelblit found that “the issue of temporary unfitness for office should be left in the public-political realm (as) there is no place for an attorney general’s decision at this time,” the ministry said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Israeli commentators interpreted “public-political realm” as a reference to party or national elections, as well as potential petitions to the Supreme Court to order Netanyahu to step aside.</p>
      <p>One such petition, by the Movement for Quality Government in Israel, was filed with the court and dismissed on Sunday.</p>
      <p>After both Netanyahu and Gantz failed to form a coalition government, Israel is in a three-week period during which lawmakers can choose a new candidate from their ranks to form a government.</p>
      <p>Whether Netanyahu qualifies may come down to him holding onto the leadership of Likud.</p>
      <p>A challenger within the party, Gideon Saar, said on Sunday that, at his behest, Likud would hold a leadership election. He voiced hope it would take place within the three-week period allotted to find a new nominee within. A Likud spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
      <p>A poll of Likud supporters aired on Israel’s Channel 13 TV found that 53 percent would re-elect Netanyahu as party head against 40 percent for Saar. Senior Likud members serving as cabinet ministers have largely rallied behind Netanyahu.</p>
      <p>He said Likud was still in talks with Gantz’s Blue and White party on forming a broad “national unity” coalition.</p>
      <p>Previous such talks had stalled amid disagreement, including over the order in which Netanyahu and Gantz might serve in top office as part of a proposed rotating premiership.</p>
      <p>Gantz, however, accused Netanyahu of being a “unity refuser” - implying that there were no serious coalition talks under way.</p>
      <p>“Likud leaders: We were elected to take care of security, education and health, or Netanyahu’s legal situation?” Gantz tweeted, in an apparent bid to bolster the internal party challenge to the prime minister.</p>
