      <p>Protesters remained defiant on Monday after supporters of main Shia groups <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/hezbollah.html">Hezbollah</a> and Amal attacked demonstrators overnight, sparking a UN call to keep protests peaceful.</p>
      <p>Demonstrators demanding a complete government overhaul have been mobilised since protests began on October 17, but a bitterly divided political class has yet to find a way forward. </p>

      <p><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/lebanon.html">Lebanon</a> has faced five weeks of anti-government protests fuelled by anger at <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/issues/corruption.html">corruption</a> among the sectarian politicians who have governed Lebanon for decades.</p>
      <p>Frustrated by the stalemate protesters called for roadblocks and a general strike on Monday, but an attack by supporters of allied parties Hezbollah and Amal on Sunday night weakened the turnout.</p>
      <p>Political parties "are trying to instil fear in us as a people so we don't progress and stay at home", said Dany Ayyash, 21, who was blocking a key road in Beirut's Hamra district.</p>
      <p>But "the attack gave us all - at least the ones here right now - a sense of determination," Ayyash said.</p>
      <p>At around midnight on Sunday, backers of Hezbollah and Amal attacked demonstrators at a flyover near the capital's main protest camp.</p>
      <p>Brandishing party flags, they hurled stones at peaceful demonstrators and taunted them as riot police deployed to contain the violence.</p>
      <p>The attackers also ravaged a nearby encampment, tearing down tents and damaging storefronts in their most serious assault on protesters so far.</p>
      <p>At least 10 demonstrators were injured, civil defence said.</p>
      <h3>Businesses announce strike</h3>
      <p>A business group representing much of Lebanon's private sector called on Monday for a three-day general strike to press the country's divided politicians to form a government and end a crisis that has brought the economy to a standstill.</p>
      <p>The group issued its statement hours after the flyover clashes broke out between Hezbollah and Amal and anti-government protesters. </p>
      <p>"The economic bodies have decided unanimously to call for the implementation of a general strike to close all private institutions in the country on Thursday, Friday and Saturday," said the Lebanese Economic Bodies, a group that includes private industrialists and bankers.</p>
      <p>"The political forces have not assumed their national responsibilities and have not shown the seriousness necessary to produce solutions to the current crisis," it said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Without elaborating it added its "escalation" would continue until a new government is formed.</p>
      <h3>Shortage of dollars</h3>
      <p>There have been widespread concerns over Lebanon's economy - of which one such worry is the shortage of US dollars, which has caused several businesses to close and many people losing their jobs.</p>
      <p>"It is causing a crisis," Al Jazeera's Zeina Khodr reported from Beirut about the protests' impact.</p>
      <p>"The [Lebanese] economy doesn't rely on the local currency, the lira, importers pay in dollars and many businesses demand payment in the US currency."</p>
      <p>One resident told Al Jazeera "Soon, I am going to move out of my apartment because the owner is insisting on taking the rent in US dollars."</p>
      <p>He added he was not willing to pay it because it would mean an increase of 30-35 percent in his rent. </p>
      <p>Khodr noted banks are limiting access to the US dollar and that has created a black market, causing the local currency to lose 25 percent of its value while leading to a rise in the cost of goods in Lebanon where "almost everything is imported".</p>
