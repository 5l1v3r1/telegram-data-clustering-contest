      <h1>Punjab: Women’s commission clean chit to Ghanaur MLA after he says video was tampered with</h1>
      <h2>The video was alleged to have shown Jalalpur asking police to pick up women members of the family of accused in an assault case.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T19:46:12+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 19:46</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/profile/columnist/kanchan-vasdev/" target="_blank">Kanchan Vasdev</a></address>
      <p>Three days after it issued a notice to Congress’ Ghanaur MLA Madan Lal Jalalpur — who was purportedly seen in a viral video making an “inappropriate” reference to women — the Punjab State Women Commission gave him a clean chit on Monday, accepting his reply that the video had been tampered with.</p>
      <p>Chairperson of the commission Manisha Gulati told <a href="https://indianexpress.com/">The Indian Express</a>, “The MLA sent his reply to the commission at 2 pm. He has stated that his video was tampered with. I have accepted his defence as we get a lot of complaints from common people that their videos are tampered with. So we have accepted the reply of the prominent MLA. We have directed the Patiala SSP to inquire into the case as to who tampered with his video.”</p>
      <p>The video was alleged to have shown Jalalpur asking police to pick up women members of the family of accused in an assault case. Harsangat Singh, the sarpanch of Takhtupura village, was allegedly assaulted by Akali workers at Rajpura Civil Hospital last week. Jalalpur had taken on the Congress-led state government, accusing it of “jungle raj”.</p>
      <p>The MLA told this newspaper, “I have also written in my reply that I have never disrespected women. I am the in-charge of Ghanaur constituency. Has any woman been harmed there? Did the police pick up any woman? As many as 40 accused in our sarpanch’s assault case are absconding. Has the police arrested any woman member of the accused’s family? Our police was not able to arrest the actual accused. What are you talking about picking their women?” he asked.</p>
      <p>After getting a clean chit from the commission, Jalalpur said he would not keep quiet. “I will take the case to its logical conclusion. I will fight against the corruption as well as the rule of bureaucracy in the state. I joined Congress and suffered with it for 10 years. I lost everything. Still, I never complained. But if still I do not have a say in the party I will speak out. And they cannot keep me silent even if they offer me the post of an advisor,” he added.</p>
      <p>The commission’s notice to Jalalpur had created a furore in Congress. A few senior leaders had taken up the matter with the commission chairperson after the notice was sent.</p>
