      <h3>Tajudeen Adebanjo</h3>
      <p>Lagos State government said it would relocate 400 residents of the Lateef Jakande Estate because of reconstruction.<br/>The estate is in Ilasan, Eti-Osa Local Government Area.</p>
      <p>The relocation, Commissioner for Housing, Moruf Akinderu-Fatai said, will be temporary to one of the state-owned schemes which will soon be completed.</p>
      <p>Akinderu-Fatai said Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu’s administration is determined to regenerate the housing estate.</p>
      <p>He said: “We are committed to the regeneration of Ilasan and other parts of the state in line with sustainable development goal SDG 11 which is focussed on creating sustainable and livable cities and communities.</p>
      <p>“The regeneration programme will involve reconstruction of dilapidated structures and repair of run down infrastructures which are no longer safe for further human utilisation.</p>
      <p>“In regenerating the estate, we will also take cognisance of access to quality education, health facilities, efficient public transportation, refuse collection services, sewage, human safety and good air quality, among other things.</p>
      <p>“We are working with other ministries and agencies to promoting a robust neighbourhood life through availability of structures that encourage community activities.”</p>

      <p>Akinderu-Fatai said habitation in Ilasan is dangerous and injurious to healthy living, hence the government’s determination to intervene by reconstructing the estate as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>He explained that the decision was based on the need to set good standards of sustainability for future generations of Lagosians.</p>
      <p>“The future of our state is very important, hence we must make the right decisions today in order to bequeath a legacy of sustainability to the generations yet unborn”.</p>
      <p>“We are set to make the provision of housing beyond mere shelter by promoting a better quality of life through enhancing inclusive and sustainable urbanisation,” he added.</p>
