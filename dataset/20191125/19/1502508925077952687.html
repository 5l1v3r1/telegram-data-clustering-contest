      <p>After months of sometimes-violent unrest in Hong Kong, an election with record turnout handed a big victory to pro-democracy local district council candidates, posing a new conundrum for Beijing and adding pressure on the city’s leader.</p>
      <p>In the run-up to the citywide elections on Sunday, extreme clashes had broken out between riot police and anti-government protesters. The standoffs were stoked in part by the death of a protester after a fall, and the shooting of another by a policeman at point-blank range. Yet on Sunday, amid a rare lull, nearly three million people - about three-quarters of eligible voters - queued on a crisp, cerulean autumn day to exercise their democratic rights, with pro-democracy candidates ultimately winning nearly 400 of the 452 seats.</p>
      <p>In the last election, four years ago, they won just 100.</p>
      <p>“Most people think the extra one million voters came out to send a political message to the government, that they still support the protesters and they’re dissatisfied with the government,” said Chinese University political scientist Ma Ngok.</p>
      <p>“The government and the pro-Beijing camp have always claimed they have public support,” Ma added. “But now … this is a big slap in the face because the public has showed their real position in record numbers.”</p>
      <p>The likelihood of Beijing offering any new concessions in the short term remains slim, observers say, given the tough line taken so far.</p>
      <p>Of the protesters’ key demands, the government has so far only responded to one: In September, it formally withdrew the extradition bill that sparked the first protests.</p>
