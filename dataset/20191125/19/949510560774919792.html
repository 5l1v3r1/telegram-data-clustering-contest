      <p>NEW YORK (AP) — Peter Gelb is set to become the Metropolitan Opera’s third-longest tenured general manager.</p>
      <p>The company’s board of directors approved a five-year contract last Thursday that extends Gelb’s term through the 2026-27 season.</p>
      <p>Gelb, who turned 66 on Nov. 10, succeeded Joseph Volpe for the 2006-07 season. If Gelb serves through his new contract, only Giulio Gatti-Casazza (1908-35) and Rudolf Bing (1950-72) will have run the Met for the longer periods.</p>
      <p>Gelb started simulcasts to movie theaters around the world and this season instituted regular Sunday matinees of staged operas for the first time at the Met. The company will start splitting its season in 2020-21, going dark in February and extending its schedule into June. Ticket sales slumped following the Great Recession but have stabilized in recent years, when the company has run at a small deficit.</p>
