        <b><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/kim-kardashian/">Kim Kardashian</a> admits she’s enjoying an ‘awakening’ of sorts after realising that she’s contributed to the majority of nudity on Instagram.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Don’t be alarmed if you see the Keeping Up With the Kardashians star wearing more clothes going forward as she explains how she no longer cares to strip off and take part in sexy photo shoots, despite building her brand on such.</p>
      <p>In an <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2019/11/kim-kardashian-west-on-her-decade-of-multi-platform-fame.html">interview with The Cut,</a> Kim admits being a sex symbol can be ‘complicated’ and addresses her husband <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/kanye-west/">Kanye West</a>’s new distaste for her famously sexy image.</p>
      <p>‘I don’t know if it’s the fact that my husband has voiced that sometimes too sexy is just overkill and he’s not comfortable with that,’ Kim said.</p>
      <p>In a recent episode of KUWTK, the married couple were seen clashing when Kanye, 42, admitted he wasn’t a fan of her revealing Met Gala dress.</p>

      <p>At the time, Kim pointed out that he was the one who used to celebrate her sexy image but it seems she’s coming round to his way of thinking.</p>
      <p>She explained: ‘I listen to him and understand him. Still, at the end of the day, he always gives me the freedom to be and do what I want.</p>

      <p>‘But I have kind of had this awakening myself. I realised I could not even scroll through Instagram in front of my kids without full nudity coming up on my feed pretty much all the time. And I definitely contributed to that.’</p>
      <p>Kim, 39, went on to explain how she’s now ‘evolving’ to a place where she doesn’t want to ‘keep up’ with her sex symbol image.</p>
      <p>A Kardashian who doesn’t want to keep up? Ironic that.</p>
      <p>The reality TV star noticed the change in her priorities with a recent holiday where she simply wanted to ‘lay out’ like the rest of us usually do on sun-kissed getaways, rather than find the perfect ‘set ups’ for photo shoots for the ‘gram.</p>
      <p>According to Kim, being overtly sexy doesn’t line-up with her new position as a law student advocating for prison reform and rubbing shoulders with President Donald Trump in the White House.</p>

      <p>Simply put, Kim K wanted the politicians to be able to look her in the face without thinking about her latest scantily-clad shoot.</p>
