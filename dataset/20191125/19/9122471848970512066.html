      <h1>ESPN Analyst Releases Score Prediction For Alabama-Auburn</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T19:30:56+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 19:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>Alabama needs to beat Auburn on Saturday to keep its College Football Playoff hopes alive and it might need to be done in blowout fashion. Are the Crimson Tide capable of that without Tua Tagovailoa under center?</p>
      <p>Nick Saban thinks highly of this year’s Tigers team. He said Auburn is “probably” the best team Alabama has faced this year. That’s quite the comment considering his team lost to No. 1 LSU two weeks ago.</p>
      <p>“This is the best team we’ve played, probably, so far this year,” he told reporters today.</p>
      <p>ESPN’s Bill Connelly <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/28156003/everything-need-know-college-football-rivalry-week">has released his S&amp;P model’s prediction</a> for the game.</p>
      <p>It likes Alabama to win and cover the spread.</p>
      <blockquote>Auburn’s not going to be willingly pushed over, though. The Tigers held LSU and Georgia to season lows in yards per play and gave up 13 fewer points to LSU than anyone else has. They are fourth in defensive SP+, and while their offense looks as if it is led by a true freshman QB (because it is), they could pretty swiftly end Bama’s backdoor title hopes.<br/><br/><b>SP+ projection:</b> Alabama 30, Auburn 22</blockquote>
      <p>Alabama is on the outside looking in when it comes to the College Football Playoff right now, but Oregon’s loss could open the door for the Crimson Tide.</p>
      <p>The No. 4 spot will likely come down to Alabama, Oklahoma and Utah. The Crimson Tide need to get by the Tigers first, though.</p>
      <p>Alabama and Auburn will kick off at 3:30 p.m. E.T. on Saturday.</p>
