      <p>President Trump just held a surprise White House event with a <a href="https://twitter.com/TalKopan/status/1199041701685452801">very good girl</a>.</p>
      <p>Trump on Monday brought out Conan, the dog injured in the raid on ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, at the White House, announcing he was giving the "brilliant" dog, who he described as a "tough cookie," a medal and a plaque.</p>
      <p>"I actually think Conan knew exactly what was going on," Trump said. "A dog that is very, very special."</p>
      <p>During the raid, Conan <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/31/politics/conan-dog-baghdadi-raid-trump-white-house/index.html">chased down the ISIS leader</a>, and Trump previously declassified the dog's name along with <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1188909031403900928">posting an image</a> of her, praising her "GREAT JOB." Though Trump referred to Conan as "he" during the event, a <a href="https://twitter.com/TalKopan/status/1199041701685452801">pool reporter confirmed Monday</a> that Conan is actually female.</p>
      <p>After reporters <a href="https://twitter.com/GabbyOrr_/status/1199017138801061895">were warned</a> before the event to "remain as calm as possible," Trump also made a joke out of the idea of Conan attacking the press, first noting that "this particular type of dog" is "trained that if you open your mouths, you will be attacked" and then jokingly telling one reporter, "You're very lucky he's not in a bad mood today."
