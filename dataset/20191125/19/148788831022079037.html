      <h1>Jonathan Glazer and A24’s Secret Short Film ‘The Fall’ Is Now Available Online</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T19:30:25+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 19:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.slashfilm.com/author/chris-evangelista/" target="_blank">Chris Evangelista</a></address>
      <p><b>Jonathan Glazer</b> directed one of the best films of the last ten years, <i>Under the Skin</i>. Now he’s closing out the decade with a disturbing, nightmarish short film: <b><i>The Fall</i></b>. For seven-plus-minutes, Glazer’s short film draws you into a story of mob-mentality at its absolute worst – a story that has unfortunate and terrifying connections to the current reality we find ourselves in.</p>
      <p>While we wait for Jonathan Glazer’s next <a href="https://www.slashfilm.com/new-jonathan-glazer-movie/">feature film</a> – which he’s set to start shooting next year – we’ll have to make due with <i>The Fall</i>, a genuinely unnerving short that is now available to watch in full <a href="https://us.thefall.film/?utm_source=WIDE+PR+BLAST&amp;utm_campaign=85ffd2c321-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2019_11_14_09_43_COPY_02&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_745cb9c02a-85ffd2c321-&amp;goal=0_745cb9c02a-85ffd2c321-&amp;mc_cid=85ffd2c321&amp;mc_eid=%5BUNIQID%5D">here</a>. The movie begins in a forested area, where individuals wearing grotesque, ill-fitting masks shake a terrified person (who is also wearing a mask) from a tree, gather around him, and pose for a selfie. Glazer drew this image from a real event – specifically, a photo of Donald Trump’s large adult sons posing with a leopard they had killed.</p>
      <p>“The day I saw a picture of the Trump sons grinning with a dead leopard,” is what inspired the scene, Glazer told the Guardian. This opening sets the stage for a visually disturbing and altogether haunting portrait of mob-mentality clearly inspired by the Trump-era. “I think fear is ever-present,” Glazer says. “And that drives people to irrational behavior. A mob encourages an abdication of personal responsibility. The rise of National Socialism in Germany for instance was like a fever that took hold of people. We can see that happening again.”</p>
      <p>Other inspirations for the short include a Bertolt Brecht poem – “In the dark times / Will there also be singing? Yes, there will also be singing / About the dark times” – and paintings by Francisco Goya. “[Goya’s] Disasters of War etchings, urgently titled <a href="https://www.museodelprado.es/en/the-collection/art-work/i-saw-it/0620975c-ecac-4b67-8b03-9a7b9cf44ca8">I Saw It</a> or <a href="https://www.nationalgalleries.org/art-and-artists/34019/worse-esto-es-peor-plate-37-disasters-war-series">This Is Worse</a>. Hell on earth, witnessed like a photojournalist such as Robert Capa or Don McCullin. Ferocious, factual, unflinching,” Glazer says.</p>
      <p><i>The Fall</i> originally debuted, unannounced, on BBC Two in October. A24 then had the short screening in front of <i>The Lighthouse</i> over the weekend. Now, it’s available for all to see. Don’t miss it.</p>
