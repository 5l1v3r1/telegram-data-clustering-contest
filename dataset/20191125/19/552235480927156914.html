      <h1>Celtic announce self-imposed shutdown as Green Brigade section partially closed for Rennes clash</h1>
      <h2>It comes after the club were sanctioned for pyrotechnics going off during the games against Stockholm and Cluj earlier this season.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T19:49:59+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 19:49</time> by <a rel="author">Graeme Young, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/graeme-young/</a></address>
      <p>Premiership champions <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> have announced part of their standing section will be closed for the game against Rennes on Thursday.</p>
      <p>It comes after the club were sanctioned for pyrotechnics going off during the games against Stockholm and Cluj earlier this season and the latest charge for illicit chanting against Lazio.</p>
      <p>The rail seating area, which houses the club's Green Brigade ultras, will be partially closed for the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/europa-league">Europa League</a> showdown with the Ligue 1 side.</p>
      <p>Celtic have urged supporters to eradicate misbehaviour with the club racking up 19 <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/uefa">UEFA</a> sanctions over the past decade. </p>
      <p>Chief executive <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/peter-lawwell">Peter Lawwell</a> has spoken at length about the need for supporters to stop damaging the club during continental fixtures and will likely address the latest proactive measure during the club's AGM on Wednesday.</p>

      <p>The club previously dished out a two-game blanket ban to the section in July 2017 for pyrotechnics and producing paramilitary banners.</p>
      <h3>A club statement read:</h3>
      <p>"Celtic has ultimate responsibility for the safety of all our supporters and it is a responsibility which we take very seriously.  </p>
      <p>"We need to tackle any behaviour which can compromise the safety of our supporters including the use of pyrotechnics, overcrowding and offensive chanting or banners.  </p>
      <p>"Following the latest UEFA disciplinary decision we can confirm that there will be a partial closure of the rail seating section at Celtic Park for the forthcoming match against Rennes.</p>

      <p>"All those supporters affected will be notified and will receive a refund.</p>
      <p>"This decision follows similar significant sanctions being imposed against the club already this season for the use of pyrotechnics during the matches against CFR Cluj and AIK Stockholm.</p>
      <p>"The club also faces another UEFA charge for the use of pyrotechnics during the match in Rome recently and this will be heard on 12th December 2019.</p>
      <p>"Regrettably, these charges and sanctions continue to damage the Club’s reputation and this behaviour continues to threaten supporter safety.  </p>
      <p>"UEFA’s rules and the club’s long-established ground regulations are very clear. Indeed, the club engages in regular dialogue with all supporters groups to ensure these are well known and understood.</p>
      <p>"We have considered this matter very carefully. It is disappointing that behaviour which is unsafe and which we all know will breach UEFA and club regulations has continued.</p>
      <p>"N.B. supporters in rows A-M will be affected."</p>
