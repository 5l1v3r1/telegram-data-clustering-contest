      <p>Robbers have made off with three priceless diamond sets from a state museum in Dresden city, police and museum directors said, in what the German media described as the biggest art heist since the second world war.</p>
      <p>The thieves broke into the Green Vault at Dresden's Royal Palace - home to around 4,000 precious objects of ivory, gold, silver and jewels - at dawn on Monday after a power cut deactivated the alarm.</p>

      <p>The stolen items included brilliant-cut diamonds that belonged to a collection of jewellery of 18th-century Saxony ruler, Augustus the Strong.</p>
      <p>"We are talking here about items of inestimable art-historical and cultural-historical value," director of Dresden's state art collections, Marion Ackermann, told reporters at a news conference on Monday.</p>
      <p>"We cannot put an exact value on them because they are priceless," said Ackermann, adding she was "shocked by the brutality of the break-in".</p>
      <p>The thieves launched the brazen raid after a fire broke out at an electrical panel near the museum in the early hours of Monday, deactivating its alarm, as well as street lighting, police said.</p>
      <p>They added that investigations were ongoing to determine if there was a link between the fire and the robbery.</p>
      <p>Despite the power cut, a surveillance camera kept working and filmed two men breaking in.</p>
      <p>They smashed a window and cut through a fence before making their way to a display case "in a targeted manner" and destroying it, the head of Dresden police Volker Lange said.</p>
      <p>The two remain on the run.</p>
      <p>Bild newspaper said the heist was "probably the biggest art theft since World War II".</p>
      <h3>'World heritage'Â </h3>
      <p>Dirk Syndram, director of the Green Vault, said the museum's jewellery sets amounted to "a kind of world heritage," totalling about 100 items.</p>
      <p>He explained that the stolen sets were part of a 10-set collection which included not only diamonds, but also sapphires, rubies and emeralds.</p>
      <p>Founded by Augustus the Strong, Elector of Saxony in 1723, the Green Vault is one of 12 museums which make up the famous Dresden State Art Collections.</p>
      <p>One of the oldest museums in Europe, the Green Vault holds treasures including a 63.8cm (25.1-inch) figure of a Moor studded with emeralds and a 547.71-carat sapphire gifted by Tsar Peter I of Russia.</p>
      <p>The museum is now made up of two sections - a historic part and a new section.</p>
      <p>Monday's raid targeted the historic section, which contains around three-quarters of the museum's treasures and has a strict limit on the number of daily visitors.</p>
      <p>Exhibits are arranged into nine rooms, including an ivory room, a silver-gilt room and the central "Hall of Treasures".</p>
      <p>One of its most valuable pieces, the green diamond, is currently on loan to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, where it is a headline attraction in the temporary exhibition, "Making Marvels: Science and Splendor at the Courts of Europe".</p>
      <p>After the Royal Palace suffered severe damages in the second world war, the Green Vault remained closed for decades before it was restored and reopened in 2006.</p>
      <h3>'Hard-earned' treasures</h3>
      <p>Saxony's state premier said the heist went beyond the value of the artefacts stolen.</p>
      <p>"The treasures that are found in the Green Vault and the Dresden Royal Palace were hard-earned by the people of Saxony over many centuries," Michael Kretschmer said.</p>
      <p>"One cannot understand the history of our country, our state without the Green Vault and Saxony's State Art Collections."</p>
      <p>In 2010, the museum hosted a meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and then US President Barack Obama, on the latter's first state visit to <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/germany.html">Germany</a>.</p>
      <p>The museum remained closed and sealed off by the police on Monday.</p>
      <p>Monday's theft is the second high-profile heist in Germany in recent years after a 100kg (220-pound), 24-karat giant gold coin was stolen from Berlin's Bode Museum in 2017.</p>
      <p>Dresden police said they were in contact with their colleagues in Berlin to examine "if there are any connections and if there are similar patterns in the crimes".</p>
      <p>Germany's culture minister Monika Gruetters said that protection of museums and cultural institutions was now of "the highest priority".</p>
      <p>"The theft of items which make up our identity as a nation of culture strikes at our hearts," she said.</p>
