      <h1>Monument to Jewish writer vandalized with swastikas</h1>
      <h2>Sholem Aleichem known as 'Yiddish Mark Twain'</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T19:20:21+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 19:20</time> by <a rel="author">Lauren M. Johnson and Nathan Hodge, CNN</a></address>
      <p>(CNN) - Ukrainian police are investigating a case of anti-Semitic vandalism after a monument to a prominent Jewish writer was vandalized with swastikas.</p>
      <p>A criminal investigation was opened by police in Kiev after they received a report of unknown individuals defacing the monument in honor of Yiddish author and playwright Sholem Aleichem.</p>
      <p>Ukrainian Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko condemned the act of vandalism <a href="https://twitter.com/VPrystaiko/status/1198891300424212480?s=20">on Twitter:</a> "The anti-Semitic act on the Sholem Aleichem monument in Kiev is disgusting, appalling and in need of prompt investigation. The perpetrator(s) must be brought to justice."</p>
      <p>Images on Ukrainian social media showed the monument, located across from the Brodsky Synagogue in central Kiev, painted with red swastikas.</p>
      <p>"Police at the scene questioned the complainant and inspected the building and the surrounding area,"<a href="https://kyiv.npu.gov.ua/news/publichna-bezpeka-ta-poryadok/pravooxoronczi-z-yasovuyut-obstavini-poshkodzhennya-pam-yatnika-na-stolichnomu-pechersku/"> the police statement read. </a>"In addition, law enforcement officers removed CCTV footage."</p>
      <p>Ukraine has a large and thriving Jewish community, but community activists also report frequent cases of anti-Semitic vandalism.</p>
      <p>Rabbi Moshe Azman, the president of American Friends of Anatevka, a charity that helps Jews forced to flee the separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine, called the incident "another provocation in front of our synagogue" <a href="https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=1061150477569297&amp;id=388184211532597">on his Facebook page.</a></p>
      <h3>Who is Sholem Aleichem?</h3>
      <p>Born in 1859 in Russia, Sholem Aleichem was a Yiddish author and playwright known in the United States as the "Yiddish Mark Twain," <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Sholem-Aleichem">according to Encyclopaedia Britannica.</a></p>
      <p>Americans would know his writing best from the musical "Fiddler on the Roof." His works were adapted into the script surrounding the musical numbers.</p>
      <p>Several of his other works were adapted and instrumental in the founding of the Yiddish Art Theatre in New York City.</p>
      <p>Before his death in 1916, Aleichem published more than 40 novels, stories, and plays in Yiddish.</p>
      <p>Last November, a man <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/15/us/man-yells-heil-hitler-baltimore-fiddler-roof-trnd/index.html">caused a commotion</a> in a Baltimore theater last week by yelling "Heil Hitler! Heil Trump!" during a "Fiddler on the Roof" performance. He later apologized.</p>
      <p>"I opened my mouth and it was so wrong. I know that now," the man told CNN affiliate WBAL. "I don't know what I was thinking. I'm so ashamed."</p>
