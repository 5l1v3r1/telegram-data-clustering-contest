      <p>Dubbed as the Fab Phones Fest, the latest Amazon promo features a slew unmissable offers such as no-cost EMI, exchange offer, and total damage protection. On top of that, consumers using Axis Bank Debit/Credit Card will be eligible for up to 1,500 INR instant discount.</p>
      <p>To simplify and expedite the phone selection process for you, Amazon has carefully added all handsets and mobile phone accessories under specific categories. The promotion page features Top deals on mobiles &amp; accessories section, which is further divided into All Available, Upcoming, and Missed sub-categories.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>You can check out the Deal of the Day under the All Available sub-category. At the time of writing, the Honor 20 with 6GB of RAM, and 128GB of internal storage space was up for grabs bearing a reduced price of just 22,999 INR as the Deal of the Day. Without this 36 percent discount, you’d end up shelling out 35,999 on the aforesaid Honor 20 variant.</p>
      <p>To make sure you do not end missing out great discounts and offers on top-branded smartphones, activate the Notify Me button on the promotion page. As part of the Limited Price Offer, Amazon is currently offering the recently unveiled OnePlus 7T for a considerably lowered price of just 34,999 INR, while it usually sells for 37,999 INR.</p>

      <p>Likewise, you can grab great discounts on other equally popular handsets including the iPhone XR, Redmi Y3, Samsung Galaxy M30s, and the Vivio U10. Other coveted devices available on the promo page are the iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, Samsung Galaxy M10s, along with the recently unveiled Nokia 6.2 for a lowered price of 13,999 INR, which translates to a 21 percent off on the device’s original selling price of 17,699 INR.</p>

      <p>The Mobile Accessories section features 100 percent original wide selection of accessories such as cases, power banks, headsets, etc starting at just 99 INR. If you have been refraining yourself from purchasing a top-branded smartphone due to the steep price tags they usually carry, you might want to check out the Jaw-Dropping Offers  – Now or Never section.</p>
      <p>The aforesaid section of the promotion page heavily discounted smartphones such as the OnePlus 7 Pro, Oppo F11 Pro, Samsung Galaxy M20, Mi A3 and many more. In addition to getting noteworthy discounts on these mobile phones, you can avail of other amazing offers associated with them.</p>
      <p>For instance, the OnePlus 7 Pro not only carries a 19 percent discount, but it also has been assigned offers such as 6 months No Cost EMI. Similarly, the Oppo F11 Pro which usually retails for 28,990 INR has gone on sale for a reduced price of just 19,990 INR, which is a 33 percent reduction in the phone’s original asking price.</p>
      <p>Aside from that, you can grab other offers such as 6 months No Cost EMI and an Extra 3,000 INR on exchange. You can get up to 60 percent off on handpicked mobile accessories such as headsets, and power banks. The section features accessories from popular brands like Realme, Xiaomi, Jabra and more.</p>
      <p>Cost-conscious buyers can head straight to the next category which is called the Best Budget Smartphones. As the name suggests, the category is teeming with inexpensive mobile phones that don’t disappoint in terms of performance. For the sake of an instance, you can get the Redmi 7 smartphone for a reduced price of only 6,999 INR, which is a significant drop in the phone’s original asking price of 9,999 INR.</p>

You can also get up to 70 percent discount on power banks manufactured by top brands like Xiaomi, Ambrane, Zinc and more. In addition to that, you can take full advantage of other limited period offers, wherein you can purchase the Honor 20 for only 22,999 INR, while it usually sells for 24,999 INR.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, you can check out the Premium Smartphones category for those who do not want to settle for an average device.
