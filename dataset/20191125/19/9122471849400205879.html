      <h1>XFL Reportedly Blocked NFL Team From Signing Their QB</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T19:07:04+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 19:07</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/alekarend" target="_blank">Alek Arend</a></address>
      <p>The XFL is getting ready to kick things off in late winter of 2020. The football league will try and garner a viewership while the NFL and college football are in the off-season. It’ll certainly be interesting to see how many tune in to watch the new football league.</p>
      <p>While the XFL doesn’t get started until next year, the league is already starting to try and compete with the NFL.</p>
      <p>With Lions QB Matthew Stafford dealing with a back injury, the Detroit Lions are trying to find a quarterback to help out with depth issues. The Lions reportedly attempted to sign XFL quarterback Josh Johnson, but the XFL has blocked the Lions from doing so.</p>

      <p>Certainly an interesting move on the XFL’s part. The league is definitely tying to compete with the NFL as it hopes to gain plenty of fans.</p>
      <p>QB Josh Johnson is currently signed with XFL’s Los Angeles Wildcats. The Wildcats are one of eight teams in the new football league.</p>
      <p>Other teams include:  St. Louis BattleHawks, Tampa Bay Vipers, New York Guardians, Seattle Dragons, Houston Roughnecks Dallas Renegades and the DC Defenders.</p>
      <p>The league will get started in February of 2020 – the same weekend the NFL’s Super Bowl takes place. It’ll be interesting to see how many fans the league generates during the NFL’s off-season.</p>
