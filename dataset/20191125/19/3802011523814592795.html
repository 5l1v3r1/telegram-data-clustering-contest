      <p>Chanting “Freedom, peace, justice,” the catchcry of the protest movement that led to autocrat Omar al-Bashir’s ouster in April, the demonstrators took to the streets in the Burri district, a site of regular anti-Bashir protests earlier this year.</p>
      <p>Many women, dressed in orange, carried banners that read: “Women’s revolution continues” and “We are the revolution, we are the change.”</p>
      <p>Many also carried banners such as “Stop rape of Darfuri Women,” as they called for justice for female victims of the war in the western Sudan region.</p>

      <p>“There is an atmosphere of freedom now,” said 21-year-old university student Fatima, as others behind her whistled, clapped and ululated, an AFP correspondent reported.</p>
      <p>“There is less violence now, but we still need to change the laws that are against us.”</p>
      <p>Bashir seized power in an Islamist-backed coup in 1989 and since then the role of women had been severely restricted in Sudan.</p>
      <p>During his 30-year-old rule, authorities implemented a strict moral code that activists said primarily targeted women, using harsh interpretations of Islamic sharia law.</p>
      <p>Thousands of women were flogged and handed hefty fines under a controversial public order law for “indecent dressing” or consuming alcohol, which is banned in the country.</p>
      <p>During the protests that rocked Bashir’s regime, women were at the forefront, demanding his ouster and an end to violence against them.</p>
      <p>The army deposed him on April 11, and his overthrow has triggered hope that laws encouraging violence against women be scrapped.</p>
      <p>“I came to demand an end to violence against women,” said, Adila Farouk as she marched in the capital’s streets.</p>
      <p>“I have been subjected to sexual harassment, but it is nothing compared to what other women have faced.” <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-7724061/Hundreds-Sudanese-women-march-against-violence.html"><b>AFP</b></a></p>
