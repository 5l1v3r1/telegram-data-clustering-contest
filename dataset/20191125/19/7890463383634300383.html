      <h1>Take some sweet cyberpunk selfies with the Cyberpunk 2077 Instagram filters</h1>

        <b>If you’ve ever wondered what you’d look like with some heavy duty cyberpunk body mods, wonder no more – these new Cyberpunk 2077  Instagram filters let you test out some dystopian looks ahead of the imminent sci-fi adventure.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The game’s <a href="https://twitter.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1199007488097554433">official Twitter</a> released a short demonstration of the AR filters, and a link where players can try them for themselves to up their selfie game. Four different variations are shown off, two heavy on the bright lights and metal, two more aesthetically simple.</p>
      <p>A pair of filters replace the top half of your face with an led concoction that replaces your eyes with bright lights emanating from chunks of metal that’s been grafted to your skin – the height of fashion when the machines take over. The remaining pair just add some asymmetrical lines, mapping the face like circuitry, for when you want people to know you’re in the concrete wasteland, but want to retain your natural beauty while you’re at it.</p>
      <p>CD Projekt has set some lofty standards for itself as the April 2020 release of Cyberpunk 2077 draws ever closer. The studio remarked that this would be the <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/cyberpunk-2077/last">“last” exceptional looking game of this generation</a>, and that’s without mentioning that internet sweetheart <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/cyberpunk-2077/cast-actors">Keanu Reeves is among the cast</a>.</p>

      <p>Some competition was recently revealed, with Valve returning to game development for Half-Life: Alyx, a new VR game set in the the Half-Life universe, <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/half-life-alyx/release-date">coming March 2020</a>. CD Projekt, however, is undaunted by Half-Life’s resurrection, saying that <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/cyberpunk-2077/half-life-alyx">VR is such a small niche it’s just not a concern</a>.</p>
      <p>Cyberpunk 2077 arrives April 16, 2020, so you’ve five months to perfect your selfie game.</p>
