      <h1>Let’s patronise local cables to create jobs - Reroy Cables</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T19:55:06+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 19:55</time> by <a rel="author">Kodjo Adams, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Accra, Nov. 25, GNA - Mrs Kate Quartey-Papafio, the Chief Executive Officer of Reroy Cables, has encouraged Ghanaians to patronise locally manufactured electrical cables to improve the country’s economic growth.</p>
      <p>This would also help in promoting business building relationships, trade, exchange linkages and innovations.</p>
      <p>In an interview with the Ghana News Agency in Accra, the CEO said when Made-in-Ghana goods are patronised extensively, it would create jobs and improve on the country’s competitive strength and provide stakeholders a trusted platform to interact with industry and economic operators.</p>
      <p>Mrs Quartey-Papafio expressed concern over the spate of fake electrical brands in the country, urging the authorities to step up their supervisory role by arresting the perpetrators to serve as a deterrent to others.</p>
      <p>A nationwide surveillance conducted by the Ghana Standards Authority (GSA) revealed that more than 70 per cent of all imported electrical cable brands on the market were substandard and could cause fires.</p>
      <p>Out of 22 electrical cable brands sampled for laboratory test, only two, which were manufactured locally, passed the critical safety requirement test for conductor resistance at the GSA Cable Laboratory in Accra.</p>
      <p>The test showed that 20 of the brands, all imported products, were not designed or test-approved to meet the requirements in safety standards.</p>
      <p>Statistics from the Ghana National Fire Service revealed that an alarming 80 per cent of all domestic fires in the country are caused by Sub-standard electrical cables used to wire buildings.</p>
      <p>“Reroy products are made according to the standards of the International Electrical Commission and enforced by the GSA,” Mrs Quartey-Papafio said.</p>
      <p>Patronizing locally made goods and services would position the country on the international market to compete favorablY with global companies.</p>
      <p>“Competing on the global arena would boost both internal and international trade and as well as promote Ghana’s exports to create employment.”</p>
      <p>Mrs Quartey-Papafio commended government for instituting the “Made-in-Ghana Products Campaign” designed to promote consumption of locally made products and increase industrial productivity of indigenous goods.</p>
      <p>“However, the resultant effect will be the massive creation of jobs and a better quality of life for our citizens,” she said.</p>
      <p>“The campaign in future will help the nation achieve its desire for a diversified and industrialised economy. Most Ghanaians utilise foreign products because of their low prices compared to local products.”</p>
