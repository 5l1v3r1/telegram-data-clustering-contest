      <p>The component parts of a bomb were picked up by a child in Newry, police have said.</p>
      <p>A suspicious object found in the Violet Hill Avenue area on Sunday led to a 24-hour security alert and a number of homes were evacuated.</p>
      <p>The alert ended on Monday afternoon.</p>
      <p>The PSNI said Army bomb disposal experts carried out a controlled explosion on what are believed to have been the component parts for an explosive device and a number of items were taken away for forensic examination.</p>
      <p>Superintendent Jane Humphries said: “We believe these to be component parts of an explosive device. When such items are left in a public area they can be innocently handled by anyone and on this occasion it was picked up by a child.</p>
      <p>“I appreciate the disruption this has caused, however, when it comes to keeping people safe we do not take chances. I can only reinforce to everyone that if you see anything suspicious please do not lift it or approach it.”</p>
      <p>She appealed for anyone with information to contact police on 101.</p>
