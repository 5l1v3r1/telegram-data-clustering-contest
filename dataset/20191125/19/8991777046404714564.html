      <p>Former Tottenham Hotspur forward Darren Bent has claimed that Mauricio Pochettino cannot yet be considered to be a great manager.</p>
      <p> <br/>During his five and a half year spell in North London, Pochettino guided his side to four successive Champions League campaigns along with an appearance in last season’s final.<br/> <br/>The club’s eleven year wait for a trophy continued with the Argentine falling to land any silverware whilst in charge.<br/> <br/>Bent believes the 46-year-old has a long way to go before he can be regarded in the same dispatches as Guardiola, Mourinho, Ferguson and Ancelotti.<br/> <br/>Pochettino was succeeded by Mourinho, who will be looking to book the club’s place in the knockout stages of the Champions League tomorrow night with victory against Olympiacos.</p>
