      <p>CALGARY — Coming off a big win in Philadelphia on Saturday, the Calgary Flames have something else to celebrate — the return of defenceman TJ Brodie to the lineup.</p>
      <p>The team announced Monday that Brodie, 29, has been activated off the injured reserve, 11 days after collapsing and convulsing on the ice during practice at the Scotiabank Saddledome.</p>
      <p>Brandon Davidson, who was called up to replace the injured D-man, was sent back down to the Stockton Heat of the American Hockey League. </p>
      <p>After a brief hospital stay, Brodie underwent further testing, which team officials said showed positive signs.</p>
      <p>He missed five games while on IR.</p>
      <p>Brodie flew to Philadelphia to meet the team and continue its road swing.</p>
      <p>The Flames face the Pittsburgh Penguins on Monday, which gets underway at 5 p.m. MT.</p>
      <p>Their next home game goes Nov. 30 when they host the Ottawa Senators.</p>
      <p>The Flames are currently sixth in the Pacific Division with an 11-12-3 record and 25 points.</p>
