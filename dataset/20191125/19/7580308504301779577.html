      <h1>Buhari’s decision against third term irreversible – BMO</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T19:29:10+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 19:29</time> by <a rel="author">NAN</a></address>
      <p>Buhari Media Organisation (BMO) says President Muhammadu Buhari’s decision not to run for a third term in office is sacrosanct, final and irreversible.</p>
      <p>In a statement signed by its Chairman Niyi Akinsiju in Abuja on Monday, BMO said that those pushing the agenda should respect the president and stop the campaign.</p>
      <p>Akinsiju said that his organisation had believed that the president’s declaration would put the matter to rest finally.</p>
      <p>”We want to restate that President Muhammadu Buhari, as an acclaimed democrat and a man of integrity.</p>
      <p>“It is important to acknowledge that Buhari’s major concern is to rebuild the dilapidated infrastructure in the country, eradicate corruption and fight insecurity, thereby bequeathing a country that works for all citizens,” he said.</p>
      <p>The organisation expressed the belief that with the bold declaration of the president not to seek for a third term, Nigerians should ignore calls for term elongation as it violated the nation’s constitution.</p>
      <p>”As a man of integrity, he will not renege on his promise and neither will he bastardise the Nigerian constitution for personal gains, no matter the pressure.</p>
      <p>“We are confident that with the measures already put in place by Buhari, Nigeria is already well-positioned for development which will lead to job creation, economic growth and rapid socio-political development of the country.</p>
      <p>“Definitely, third term is not on the agenda of the president as it runs contrary to the oath of office he swore to.</p>
      <p>”We want to reassure Nigerians that Buhari remains focussed in improving the lives of Nigerians by embarking on programmes and projects that will positively impact on Nigerians,” Akinsiju said.</p>
