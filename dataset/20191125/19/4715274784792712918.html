      <p>New York―Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the US Supreme Court’s eldest justice and de facto leader of its liberal wing, has been released from hospital after being admitted last week with a possible infection.</p>
      <p>The 86-year-old has had a series of health scares this year, sparking speculation she may retire―a move that would allow conservative US President Donald Trump to nominate a replacement.</p>
      <p>Ginsburg is “home and doing well”, US media reported the court as saying Sunday.</p>
      <p>She was hospitalized on Friday with fever and chills, according to a court spokesperson.</p>
      <p>A feminist icon, Ginsburg is one of four liberals on the nine-justice court and has given no sign she is thinking of stepping down.</p>
      <p>In August Ginsburg completed a three-week course of outpatient radiation therapy in New York for a localized malignant tumor on her pancreas.</p>
      <p>She was treated for colon cancer in 1999, and a decade later, pancreatic cancer that was caught at an early stage. In December 2018, she had two nodules removed from her lung.</p>
      <p>US Supreme Court justices are appointed for life. She has repeatedly said she will only retire when she feels incapable of handling the workload.</p>
      <p>Ginsburg is fondly known as “The Notorious RBG,” a riff on dead rapper The Notorious B.I.G.<b> </b></p>
