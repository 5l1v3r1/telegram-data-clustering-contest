      <p>Smartphone cameras are getting better with every new update, but they still lack a lot of versatility. There's a reason why pro photographers still lug around DSLR cameras and an array of lenses to suit different lighting conditions.</p>
      <p>While there's still nothing like a dedicated camera, the <a href="https://store.boingboing.net/sales/revolcam-the-multi-lens-photo-revolution-for-smartphones?utm_source=boingboing.net&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=revolcam-the-multi-lens-photo-revolution-for-smartphones&amp;utm_term=scsf-354777&amp;utm_content=a0x1P000004N0YM&amp;scsonar=1">RevolCam</a> goes a long way toward bridging the gap between phone cams and the real deal.</p>
