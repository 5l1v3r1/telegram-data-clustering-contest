      <p>But the WADA's potential punishment would be harsher than what Russia's experienced in the past if it ultimately stands. Any governing bodies that have signed WADA's code <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/25/sports/russia-wada-olympics.html?smtyp=cur&amp;smid=tw-nytsports">would be affected</a>, including FIFA, which could prevent the Russian men's national soccer team from competing in the 2022 World Cup. Russian government officials <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/25/sports/russia-wada-olympics.html?smtyp=cur&amp;smid=tw-nytsports">wouldn't be allowed</a> to attend any international sporting events, either, and the country would be barred from hosting and bidding to host any events. The latter punishment means the ban could continue to face consequences beyond just the four years on the docket.
