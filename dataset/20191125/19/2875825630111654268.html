      <p>Manchester United chief Ed Woodward has been warned he would not be doing his job if he didn't contact Mauricio Pochettino whilst he is out of work.</p>
      <p>Pochettino, heavily linked with United after Jose Mourinho's sacking last December, is on the market after being replaced by Mourinho as <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> boss last week.</p>
      <p>The Argentinian manager is already attracting plenty of interest as he plots his next move, whilst United are still languishing in mid-table after a 3-3 draw with Sheffield United on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is expected to be given time to rebuild the Red Devils despite mixed results as he approaches 12 months at the helm.</p>
      <p>But former <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> star Jamie Carragher has told United bosses they at least make contact with Pochettino over the festive period if their form does not improve.</p>

      <p>"The top six teams, all believe they should be challenging for the league," Carragher told Sky Sports Monday Night Football.</p>
      <p>"There will always be two or three who are being criticised for what they are doing.</p>
      <p>"There is no doubt Pochettino is the one they wanted and Solskjaer did that well, it forced United to give him the job.</p>
      <p>"He should be allowed in January to get what he needs.</p>

      <p>"At the top of <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> , when they get to Christmas and January and this continues, and there is a guy like Pochettino who would take them forward.</p>
      <p>"They would not be doing their job if they weren't in contact with him."</p>
      <p>United legend Gary Neville, meanwhile, urged Solskjaer to "protect himself" by splashing the cash on the players he needs in January.</p>
      <p>"It was the most predictable thing in the world," Neville said.</p>
      <p>"Two and a half years ago, I said Mauricio Pochettino should be appointed before Jose Mourinho.</p>
      <p>"I can't say I don't think he would be the right person.</p>
      <p>"But Ole has been appointed and he has to be selfish now. He has to have that ruthless streak that Mourinho or Conte has and spend money to protect himself.</p>
