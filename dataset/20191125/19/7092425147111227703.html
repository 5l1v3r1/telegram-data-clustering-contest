          <b>A man has been crushed to death by a rollercoaster in a tragic incident at Berlin Christmas market.</b>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>The incident was reportedly witnessed by a family-of-four who had been riding the rollercoaster when the accident occurred just after 7pm on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Fire Department spokesman Jens-Peter Wilker said the man is believed to have been a market employee and was working when he was hit by the carriage and crushed beneath it.</p>
      <p>German broadcaster Deutsche Welle reports the man died at the scene after several attempts to resuscitate him.</p>
      <p>The Berlin Spectator said several visitors suffered post-traumatic stress disorder and received treatment.</p>
      <p>Counselling has also been offered to those affected.</p>

      <p>Market officials immediately closed the popular attraction - which had only opened on Friday - and visitors were asked to leave.</p>
      <p>Police are currently investigating the cause of the incident but the death is not being treated as suspicious.</p>
      <p>The Christmas market was pitched on a large car park on Landsberger Allee in the North East of the city.</p>
      <p>The accident occurred within days of the death of a two-year-old boy who was crushed by a large block of ice at Luxembourg Christmas market.</p>
      <p>Luxembourg's Prime Minister Xavier Bettel said: “It cannot be put into words how sad this makes us.</p>
      <p>"My deepest sympathies and condolences for the family.”</p>
