      <p>Eagle-eyed Gavin and Stacey fans have been treated to a first look at the Christmas special thanks to BBC iPlayer.</p>
      <p>The cheeky devils over at the series have casually dropped a sneak peek of the new one-off, revealing Uncle Bryn (Rob Brydon) in full on meltdown mode right at the end of season three’s final episode.</p>
      <p>With a million dishes on the go and a tight schedule that noone’s sticking to, Bryn, who’s never exactly been one to handle the pressure of any situation, is running ragged around the kitchen.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>He’s even got a walky-talky for this kind of military operation, because a phone is not efficient enough clearly.</p>
      <p>Calling in for back-up from Gwen, Jason or basically anyone at this point, Bryn is getting more panicked as the big dinner prep gets on top of him.</p>
      <p>With the plates still at Stacey’s, the table still not set, and a large number of pots getting to literal boiling point on the stove, it’s only a matter of time until Bryn steams up too.</p>

      <p>Hearing an almighty crash, Stacey (who was actually setting the table so he was panicking over nothing) and Nessa run into the kitchen to find her kind-hearted uncle on the floor over a smashed plate.</p>
      <p>Looks like dinner was going to be a bit late, gang!</p>
      <p>It’s fair to say the entire nation is getting excited over the return of the Barry/Billericay collective, which will air pride of place on BBC One on Christmas Day.</p>
      <p>Ruth Jones, who plays Nessa and co-wrote the show with James Corden, even got the celebrations off to a flying start by turning up as Nessa to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/24/ruth-jones-switches-barry-christmas-lights-gavin-staceys-nessa-everything-11208598/">light up the Barry Christmas decorations on Sunday.</a></p>

      <p>Ruth and fellow showrunner James Corden <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/05/28/james-corden-confirms-gavin-stacey-returning-christmas-special-9700098/">confirmed that the hit series would be making a dramatic comeback</a> for a festive treat after a nine-year hiatus.</p>

      <p>‘Over the last 10 years we’ve talked a lot about Gavin And Stacey – where they might be today and what their lives might look like,’ they said in a joint statement.</p>
      <p>‘And so in secret we took the plunge and wrote this one-hour special.</p>
      <p>‘We’ve loved revisiting Barry and Essex again and bringing the characters back together has been a joy.’</p>
      <p>Actress Alison Steadman, who plays meme queen Pam Shipman, said that <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/23/gavin-and-staceys-alison-steadman-reveals-christmas-special-was-like-family-reunion-11205246/">returning for the one-off episode was like a ‘family reunion’</a>.</p>
