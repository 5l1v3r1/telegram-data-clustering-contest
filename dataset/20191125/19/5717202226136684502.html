      <h1>Tottenham fans react to Mourinho’s Zlatan Ibrahimovic comments</h1>

        <b>A number of Tottenham Hotspur fans have taken to Twitter to react to comments made by Jose Mourinho – <a href="https://www.football.london/tottenham-hotspur-fc/fixtures-results/jose-mourinho-eriksen-ibrahimovic-pochettino-17312942">and reported by Football London</a> – where he discussed the recent reports linking Zlatan Ibrahimovic with a move to Spurs.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/21/tottenham-linked-veteran-forward-zlatan-ibrahimovic-following/">The Telegraph reported last week</a> that Mourinho was considering bringing Ibrahimovic to Tottenham. The 38-year-old will be available on a free transfer heading into January, and it was suggested that the Portuguese could look to bring him in as cover for Harry Kane.</p>

      <p>However, Mourinho – who has worked with the striker on a number of occasions in the past – insisted that there is nothing in the reports linking the Swede with a move to Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.</p>
      <p>“He is an amazing player and an amazing guy. But I would say no chance,” he said, <a href="https://www.football.london/tottenham-hotspur-fc/fixtures-results/jose-mourinho-eriksen-ibrahimovic-pochettino-17312942">as reported by Football London</a>.</p>

      <p>“We have the best striker in England and one of the top two or three strikers in the world. It does not make any sense for a striker of Zlatan’s dimension. Obviously, he is in his late 30s but he is still a striker who can play in any club in the world. But it does not make sense to come to  a club where we have Harry Kane.”</p>
      <p>It appears that most Spurs fans are happy to hear that Ibrahimovic will not be joining. Despite being available on a free, some supporters clearly feel that it would be a mistake to invest in signing the striker.</p>
      <p>His wages are likely to be incredibly expensive. And it is clear that many fans feel that it would be a poor decision given that they do have Kane and that he is well into the twilight of his career.</p>
      <p>It should also be noted that Mourinho has been praised for another reason. Towards the end of his tenure, Mauricio Pochettino seemed to frustrate the supporters when he would provide cryptic answers, particularly to questions that seemed straightforward.</p>
      <p>Of course, some will speculate that Ibrahimovic could still be a target. But Mourinho appears to have done as much as he can to quash the rumours. And some fans are impressed by his clear message on the striker.</p>
      <p>Here is what some of the supporters were saying after Mourinho’s comments…</p>
