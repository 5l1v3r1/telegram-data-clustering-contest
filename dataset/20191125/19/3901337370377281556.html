      <h1>Pitso: I Know The Referee…</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T19:02:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 19:02</time> by <a rel="author">Soccer Laduma</a></address>
      <p>Pitso Mosimane says he was forced to withdraw Mamelodi Sundowns captain Hlompho Kekana at half-time to avoid a red card in their eventual 2-1 win over Golden Arrows in the semi-final of the Telkom Knockout on Saturday. </p>
      <p>The skipper, who scored the opening goal for the Brazilians, had been as early as the second minute and the coach said he feared referee Victor Gomes would give him his marching orders.</p>

      </p>
      <p>“I was forced to make subs. The first two were Denis (Onyango) with a hamstring and with Kekana I was afraid he would also get a yellow card,” Mosimane told reporters.  </p>
      <p>“I know the referee, he is on top of those small fouls and he will give a yellow if he has to give a yellow. So I sacrificed Kekana and I told them that when we are 2-0 up we don’t want to take the risk of not having enough to go forward or play well. But we’ve got the two goals already, so we opted to secure the 2-0 and Tiyani Mabunda (who took Kekana’s place) has experience as well. There was no excuse not to play him.”</p>
      <p>Gomes did eventually send a Sundowns player off, but it was midfielder Gaston Sirino for a dangerous challenge in the dying minutes of the game. </p>
      <p>Mosimane applauded the referee’s brave and decisive call.</p>
      <p>“I believe Arrows’ goal (scored before the red card) was offside. But I am happy to be wrong. But the Sirino sending off was right, he was naughty and went over the ball,” Mosimane, whose side will now face Maritzburg United in the final on December 14, said.</p>
