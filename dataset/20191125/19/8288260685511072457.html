      <h1>Wolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo tipped to replace Unai Emery at Arsenal</h1>
      <h2>The pressure has been mounting on the Gunners boss following a disappointing run of form</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T19:20:56+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 19:20</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Watson</a></address>
      <p>Wolverhampton Wanderers boss Nuno Espirito Santo has emerged as the bookies' favourite to become the next Arsenal manager.</p>
      <p>Pressure has been mounting on current Gunners chief Unai Emery following a run of only two league wins in 11 Premier League games.</p>
      <p>Arsenal were fortunate to grab a last-gasp equaliser against struggling Southampton at the Emirates Stadium on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The 2-2 draw left them eighth in the table, 19 points behind leaders Liverpool.</p>
      <p>With Emery's future apparently in the balance, the bookmakers have been taking bets on who might replace him at the helm.</p>
      <p>And <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> fans will not be pleased to learn that, at the time of writing, <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/nuno-makes-demand-wolves-players-17306508">Nuno</a> has been installed as the 6/4 favourite by <a href="https://m.skybet.com/football/manager-specials/event/24911620">Sky Bet</a> .</p>
      <p>Former Arsenal player Mikel Arteta is next on the list at 7/2, followed by Massimiliano Allegri and Rafa Benitez at 5/1.</p>
      <p>Mauricio Pochettino, sacked by Tottenham Hotspur last week, is at 6/1, with Freddie Ljungberg 8/1.</p>
