      <p>IPS officer Ashish Bhatia, who was holding the additional charge of Ahmedabad city police commissioner, has been given full charge Monday, a notification issued by the Gujarat government said.</p>
      <p>Bhatia, who was the Director General of Police (CID Crime and Railways) and was given the additional charge of commissioner of police of Ahmedabad city, has been “transferred and appointed on the vacant ex-cadre post of the commissioner of police, Ahmedabad city”, read the notification released by the Home Department.</p>
      <p>Bhatia was given the additional charge on October 25 after the post felt vacant when the then Ahmedabad city police commissioner A K Singh was promoted and transferred to the post of Director General of the National Security Guard (NSG) in New Delhi.</p>

Another Gujarat IPS officer who was the member of the SIT along with Bhatia was Shivanand Jha, the current DGP of Gujarat Police.</p>
      <p>Bhatia has also served as the police commissioner of Surat city in 2016 and his name was one of the top contenders for the post of Ahmedabad city police commissioner. He has received police medal in 2001 and the President’s police medal in 2011.</p>
      <p>IPS officer Sanjay Srivastava, who was the Additional Director General of police (ADGP) of Armed Police (Armed Unit), has been transferred and appointed on the cadre post of ADGP CID Crime and Railways, in place of Ashish Bhatia, by “downgrading the ex-cadre post of Director General of Police, CID Crime and Railways, Gujarat state, Gandhinagar to Additional Director General of Police level,” read the notification.</p>
      <p>The notification also stated that Srivastava will continue holding the additional charge of ADGP, Technical Services and SCRB.</p>
