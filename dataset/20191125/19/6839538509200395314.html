      <p>A special hero of the recent take down of the ISI leader al-Baghdadi received an audience with the White House to thank him for his good work.</p>
      <p>“It was a flawless attack, al-Baghdadi’s gone, and we gave Conan a medal and a plaque. He’s a very, very special dog,” the president said at the White House about the Belgian Malinois.</p>
      <p>“He’s an incredible dog. We’re very honoured to have Conan here and to give Conan an award,” he said in the Rose Garden ceremony after meeting with Special Forces troops in the White House.</p>

      <p>“He was badly hurt but he recovered very quickly. Conan is a tough cookie, nobody’s going to mess with Conan,” the president continued, alluding to the dog’s injuries when the ISIS cutthroat blew himself up with a suicide vest.</p>
      <p>The commander-in-chief then extolled the canine’s fighting abilities.</p>
      <p>“This is the ultimate fighter, ultimate everything. Ultimate in terms of sniffing drugs,” Trump said.</p>

      <p>Mr Trump said he asked Conan’s handlers “what chance a person [would] have against Conan without the guns, I guess the answer was pretty much none. No chance, it was amazing.”</p>
      <p>“We had a case [on the southern border] where we had drugs in a cylinder in a car. It was undetectable. The dog came in and jumped on the hood, pointing — wow! — incredible sense of smell,” said the president, who was accompanied by Vice President Mike Pence and first lady Melania Trump.</p>
      <p>As the president and his wife walked back into the White House, a reporter asked the first lady if she wanted to adopt Conan for the couple’s son, 13-year-old Barron.</p>

      <p>The president and his wife chuckled at the question.</p>
      <p>The first family does not own a dog.</p>
      <p>Service dogs have been used by the military for decades.</p>
      <p>On the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan, the animals’ most critical function has been sniffing out hidden roadside bombs or IEDs — and they have saved untold numbers of American lives.</p>
