      <h1>It's Beginning to Look a Lot Like...Halloween in the BBC's Spooky New Take on A Christmas Carol</h1>

      <p>The lyrics for beloved Christmas song “It’s the Most Wonderful Time of the Year” very clearly affirm that “scary ghost stories” are just as much a part of the holiday season as “mistletoeing.” And if the BBC’s spin on <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/06/the-greatest-what-we-do-in-the-shadows-moments-so-far/">the oft-adapted Dickens classic</a> wants to lean into its horror elements, we are all for it.</p>
      <p>Guy Pearce stars as Scrooge (other cast members include <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/andy-serkis-thinks-performance-capture-will-just-be-how-1826917109">Andy Serkis</a> and <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-greatest-what-we-do-in-the-shadows-moments-so-far-1835055437"><i>What We Do in the Shadows</i></a>’ Kayvan Novak) in what is most definitely a dark, dark take on <i>A Christmas Carol,</i> with Ridley Scott and Tom Hardy among its producers. Steven Knight<i> (Locke, Serenity) </i>directs. Check out this grim-as-hell trailer:</p>

      <p>“This is the place where Christmas comes to die,” indeed. <i>A Christmas Carol</i> premieres on BBC One this Christmas.</p>
