      <h1>Rob Vanstone: Former Saskatchewan Roughriders quarterbacks are Winnipeg Blue Bombers' lucky charm</h1>
      <h2>The Bombers have won their last two Grey Cup games, separated by 29 years, with a former Saskatchewan Roughrider starting at quarterback.</h2>

      <p>Tom Burgess did not attempt a pass in the 1989 Grey Cup game, but the word “incomplete” was still applicable.</p>
      <p>As much as he revelled in<a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/rob-vanstone-celebrating-the-greatest-grey-cup-30-years-later"> the Saskatchewan Roughriders’ 43-40 victory over the Hamilton Tiger-Cats</a>, there was a notable, nagging void.</p>
      <p>“There’s a teammate part of you that’s extremely happy because of what we had achieved together, but there’s a selfishness, because you want to be the one,’’ Burgess said in an interview for my book on the 1989 CFL champions, The Greatest Grey Cup Ever.</p>
      <p>“It was a very bittersweet kind of feeling. On the one hand, you’re the Grey Cup champions. On the other hand, I didn’t appear in the game.’’</p>
      <p>A year later, Burgess discovered what it was like for Kent Austin in the 1989 Grey Cup game. Burgess, a la Austin, threw three touchdown passes to lead his team to victory.</p>

      <p>That team, the 1990 Winnipeg Blue Bombers, eviscerated the Edmonton Eskimos 50-11.</p>
      <p>The Blue Bombers would not win another Grey Cup until Sunday, when another erstwhile Saskatchewan quarterback — <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/rob-vanstone-winnipeg-blue-bombers-zach-collaros-has-silenced-the-skeptics">Zach Collaros</a> — piloted <a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/local-news/what-a-party-cfl-fans-from-across-canada-watch-bombers-win-grey-cup-in-calgary/wcm/4217fe98-6d12-4648-be4a-26f279f9267d">Winnipeg to a 33-12 conquest of Hamilton.</a></p>

      <p>Collaros, a la Burgess, earned his second Grey Cup ring after being a bystander the first time around.</p>
      <p>Back in 2012, Collaros watched from the sideline as teammate Ricky Ray quarterbacked the Toronto Argonauts to a 35-22 victory over the Calgary Stampeders.</p>
      <p>Collaros returned to the big game in 2014 — as Hamilton’s starting quarterback — but lamented a 20-16 loss to Calgary.</p>
      <p>The following year, Collaros was looking very much like the CFL’s most outstanding player before suffering a season-ending knee injury.</p>
      <p>The Tiger-Cats gave up on Collaros midway through the 2017 season. The following January, he was dealt to the Roughriders, for whom he had a 10-4 record as a starter in 2018.</p>

      <p>Come playoff time, though, Collaros could only watch due to a concussion he suffered in the regular-season finale. Elevated into a starting role, Brandon Bridge struggled at quarterback for Saskatchewan in a 23-18 playoff loss to Winnipeg.</p>
      <p>In the months ahead, the concussion-prone Collaros received plenty of free, unsolicited advice from commentators who suggested that he should retire.</p>
      <p>Collaros, and the Roughriders’ brass, had other thoughts. Saskatchewan re-signed him last February, to reviews that were hardly effusive.</p>
      <p>The rest is well-documented.</p>
      <p>Collaros was concussed, again, on the third play of the season opener.</p>
      <p>A virtual unknown named <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/rob-vanstone-saskatchewan-roughriders-quarterback-cody-fajardo-didnt-let-anyone-down">Cody Fajardo</a> performed so brilliantly, so quickly, that Collaros was deemed expendable.</p>
      <p>More alleged experts suggested that he should retire.</p>
      <p>With Fajardo suddenly, surprisingly entrenched as the Roughriders’ signal-caller, Collaros was dealt to Toronto on July 31. He never played a down for the Argonauts before being traded to Winnipeg on Oct. 9.</p>
      <p>“But shouldn’t he really pack it in?” was the chorus (repeat).</p>
      <p>Collaros ended up starting four games for Winnipeg, winning each time.</p>
      <p>As a punctuation mark, he became a Cup-winning starting quarterback, authoring one of the most memorable comeback stories in CFL history.</p>
      <p>Suggestions of retirement? Those, too, are history.</p>
      <p>All plaudits are well-deserved.</p>
      <p>All criticism of his critics is also warranted.</p>
      <p>Collaros took the high road when asked about a nomadic 2019 season. He went to considerable lengths to downplay a delectable storyline, choosing his words with characteristic caution while concentrating on mastering a series of playbooks and being an exemplary teammate.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Burgess, too, made the best of an imperfect situation.</p>
      <p>In the 1989 final, for example, he came off the bench after Austin injured a knee and threw touchdown passes to <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/rob-vanstone-happy-60th-birthday-to-saskatchewan-roughriders-legend-ray-elgaard">Ray Elgaard</a> and <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/rob-vanstone-saskatchewan-roughriders-legend-jeff-fairholm-belongs-in-canadian-football-hall-of-fame">Jeff Fairholm</a> to help a 9-9 Saskatchewan side upend the 16-2 Eskimos 32-21.</p>
      <p>Austin recovered quickly, presenting Roughriders head coach John Gregory with a dilemma: Which quarterback to choose?</p>
      <p>Gregory opted for Austin and was rewarded with a 474-yard passing performance.</p>
      <p>Austin was named the Grey Cup’s most outstanding offensive player — an award Burgess would win a year later.</p>
      <p>Even while relegated to the sideline in 1989, Burgess deserved an assist. He suggested a play — a bomb to Fairholm — and Austin liked the idea.</p>
      <p>A one-play, 75-yard touchdown drive resulted.</p>
      <p>The next year, Burgess was launching TD passes on behalf of the victorious Blue Bombers — celebrating a championship for the second successive season.</p>
      <p>“I put those two years together,’’ Burgess recalled. “I was with Saskapeg.”</p>
      <p>Collaros, for his part, became a Saskapegger in one storybook season — ultimately knocking down his detractors a peg or two.</p>
