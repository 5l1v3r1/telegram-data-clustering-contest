      <p>And with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/23/eastenders-spoilers-first-look-at-mel-owen-funeral-lisa-fowler-crack-revenge-11201766/">Lisa determined to learn the truth</a> of what happened to her friend, her daughter Louise is becoming concerned for her, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/wp-admin/post.php?post=11215735&amp;action=edit">especially after she becomes concerned over whether she is taking her medication.</a></p>
      <p>But just what’s wrong with Lisa?</p>
      <p>Here’s what you need to know…</p>
      <h3>What is wrong with Lisa in EastEnders and what illness does she have?</h3>
      <p>Lisa has previously suffered from psychosis and was sectioned back in 2017.</p>

      <p>She made a brief return to the soap then after Louise was badly burned by candles at her school prom and ended up in hospital.</p>

      <p>Lisa subsequently kidnapped Louise from hospital, leading to a furious confrontation with Phil during which it was established that she had mental health issues.</p>
      <p>She initially fought back by hitting Phil with a phone, before Louise was handed over to ambulance staff.</p>
      <p>Viewers learned some time later that she was unable to attend Mel’s wedding to Ray Kelly (Sean Mahon) as she had been sectioned.</p>
      <h3>What happened to Mel?</h3>

      <p>Mel was killed earlier this month after she was hit by a lorry following a car crash during a high speed chase with Sharon.</p>
      <p>While she survived the wreck after Sharon dragged her to safety, she subsequently walked back into the road after becoming convinced she had heard her son Hunter (Charlie Winter) who died a few months earlier, calling her.</p>
      <p>She subsequently walked back into the road towards her car – and was fatally knocked down.</p>
      <p>Despite the circumstances, Lisa has since<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/14/eastenders-spoilers-lisa-fowler-accuses-sharon-mitchell-of-murdering-mel-owen-dead-11126736/"> accused Sharon of killing Mel</a> – and also attempted to tell <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/14/eastenders-spoilers-phil-mitchell-discovers-truth-sharon-baby-mel-owen-dead-11126982/">Phil (Steve McFadden) that he is not the father of Sharon’s unborn child.</a></p>
