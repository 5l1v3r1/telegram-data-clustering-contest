      <p>The police have launched an internal investigation following a video of an officer at Midrand police station, who refused to help a pleading mother and child, went viral.</p>
      <p>The video shows the officer – who was alleged to be under the influence – refusing to check up on a woman who was in the police cell with her child.</p>
      <p>The woman is clearly pleading for help but the officer says, “it is none of my business … she can die and I can write an affidavit that she died”.</p>

      <p>He addresses the person capturing the video, saying, “who are you to tell me there is a lady who is crying. I will write in the books, ‘there was a lady, she was crying and then she died’.”</p>
      <p>According to Gauteng police spokesperson Brigadier Mathapelo Peters, no formal complaint had been laid but an “urgent” investigation into the incident was launched.</p>
      <p>“While at this point the police have received no complaint relating to a video clip circulating on social media, the provincial commissioner, Lieutenant General Elias Mawela, has sanctioned an urgent internal investigation to establish the facts surrounding the clip,” Peters said.</p>
      <p>She called on the person who captured the video to contact the police.</p>
      <p>“It would assist the internal investigation if the person, who captured the video, could contact management at the Midrand police station.”</p>
