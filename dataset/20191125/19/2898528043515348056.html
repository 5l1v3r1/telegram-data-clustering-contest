      <h1>Former UFC fighter Pearl Gonzalez breaks her opponent’s arm in Combat Jiu-Jitsu match</h1>

      <p>Former UFC fighter and current Invicta FC athlete <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/4035/pearl-gonzalez">Pearl Gonzalez</a> earned a victory in her Combat Jiu-Jitsu match this past weekend when she broke her opponent’s arm to secure the submission.</p>
      <p>Combat Jiu-Jitsu is a different kind of grappling competition where athletes are allowed to use open palm strikes against each other once the action hits the ground. It’s grappling that’s not quite mixed martial arts, not exactly like Pancrase rules and definitely not the same kind of Brazilian jiu-jitsu seen at tournaments like ADCC.</p>
      <p>In this particular match, Gonzalez was facing Lilian Borja when she locked up a triangle choke before falling back to the mat trying to lock up the submission. When Borja didn’t tap, Gonzalez adjusted to an armbar combination along with the triangle choke and that’s when the arm popped.</p>

      <p>The commentators immediately recognized that Borja’s arm was broken as the match was stopped and Gonzalez declared the victory. Take a look at the full video, which is not for the faint of heart.</p>
