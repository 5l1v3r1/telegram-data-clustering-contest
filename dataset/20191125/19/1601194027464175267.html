      <h3>Original plans revealed for WWE Survivor Series</h3>
      <p>This past Sunday night's WWE Survivor Series PPV featured <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/bray-wyatt">'The Fiend' Bray Wyatt</a> defeating <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/daniel-bryan">Daniel Bryan</a> in a WWE Championship match. Much like last year, Bryan fought hard during his match at Survivor Series, but in the end, was unable to defeat his opponent, who powered through the leader of the "Yes" movement.</p>
      <p>Although Wyatt faced Bryan in a match which received generally positive reviews and was a back-and-forth contest, Bryan was not the originally planned opponent for The Fiend at the PPV.</p>
      <p>According to Dave Meltzer of <a href="http://www.f4wonline.com/">Wrestling Observer Radio</a>, <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/the-miz">The Miz</a> was originally scheduled to face The Fiend at Survivor Series this year, and the bout would likely have been a quick squash in favor of the current Universal Champion.</p>
      <p>Additionally, Meltzer noted that the plan beyond Survivor Series was for Bray Wyatt to face The Miz again at WWE Starrcade, with the second match also being a quick squash in favor of Wyatt.</p>
      <p>For reasons unknown, the Survivor Series portion of the WWE plan was scrapped, and the match featured Daniel Bryan instead of The Miz, with Miz being relegated to giving Bryan a "pep talk" before Bryan's bout yesterday. Bryan ended up facing The Fiend in a more competitive match, which fans likely would have preferred to a squash match.</p>
      <h3>WWE Starrcade plans remain intact</h3>
      <p>As for Starrcade, The Miz remains advertised to face The Fiend in a Steel Cage WWE Universal Championship match airing live on WWE Network. While current booking plans for the match remain unknown, it appears as though fans might be in store for a total squash match inside the steel cage.</p>
      <p>Starrcade airs live on WWE Network on December 1st from Duluth, Georgia.</p>
