      <h1>Tuesday's Best Bet: Semi Excited a strong contender at Parx</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T19:27:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 19:27</time> by <a rel="author">Jarrod Horak</a></address>
      <p>Tuesdayâ€™s 8th race from Parx is a $46,000 entry level allowance event for 3-year-olds and up traveling a mile and seventy yards on the main track (Post Time 3:34 p.m. ET).</p>

      <p>#5 SEMI EXCITED (4-1) exits a strong front running starter allowance victory at this course/distance. The pace was slow that day, and that was the only time he was near the lead recently. Some others have speed in this spot, and I am expecting him to revert to patient tactics.</p>
      <p>#3 Snap Hook (9-2) exits a runner-up finish at Keeneland, and Mike Pino claimed him for $30k that day. He should be forwardly placed.</p>
      <p>#6 Evil Monkey (8-5) is a 2-for-20 gelding with an affinity for finishing 2nd and 3rd. He stretches back out and figures to stalk the pace.</p>
      <p>#7 Over Sensual (3-1) stretches back out in his third start after a layoff. He is 2-for-3 at Parx and projects an outside stalking trip. He seems best between seven panels and one mile.</p>
