      <h3>THE Philippine National Police has recorded a significant decline in crime and terrorist-related incidents in many parts of Mindanao over the nearly three years it has been under martial law prompting recommendations for President Duterte to order a continuing martial rule in selected parts of the region.</h3>
      <p>Amid Davao City Mayor Sara Duterte’s call on her father, President Duterte to already lift martial law in her city,  both Philippine National Police Officer-in-Charge, Lieutenant General Archie Francisco F. Gamboa and Armed Forces chief of staff, Gen. Noel Clement have expressed favor  in recommending the extension of martial law in select areas in Mindanao.</p>
      <p>Mayor Duterte said she is seeking the help of the House of Representatives and the Department of National Defense to exempt Davao City from martial law in Mindanao and has officially sent a letter to the Office of the President last August 7 regarding the matter.</p>
      <p>Last June, the President’s daughter announced they will request the Office of the President to reconsider and review the declaration of martial law in Mindanao and make it localized. She was backed up by the City Council as well as the Police Regional Office 11 which also expressed its support on the exemption, with reference to the decrease in the city’s crime volume and crime rate.</p>
      <p>“Generally yes, but there is still ongoing assessment on the part of the PNP,  baka pwedeng maging selective,” said Gen. Gamboa. The PNP-OIC said the ‘selected areas’ are those with high terrorist threats specifically those posed by the Abu Sayyaf and other ISIS-inspired terror groups in the region including Sulu, Basilan and the Lanao provinces including Marawi City.</p>
      <p>Under martial law, police have noted a significant reduction in crimes and terrorist-related incidents in the Southern Philippines.</p>
      <p>According to Police Regional Office 12 director, Brigadier General Alfred S. Corpus, the entire SOCCSKSARGEN region has been experiencing a peaceful climate over the nearly three years it has been under martial law.</p>
      <p>“The region is now more peaceful and economic-friendly as we are experiencing a continuing decline in crime and terrorist-related incidents since President Duterte declared martial law in Mindanao in 2017” the official said.</p>
      <p>According to Corpus, the region’s crime statistics show a 27.04 percent reduction in the total crime volume compared to the 40.41 percent crime volume prior to the declaration of martial law in the region on November 9, 2017.</p>
      <p>The official said that from May 1 to November 12, 2016, the region’s overall crime rate is 40.41 percent but it went down to 32.64 percent in 2017 followed by 30.06 in 2018 and 27.04 percent from January to date.</p>
      <p>The statistics showed a massive reduction in cases of murder, homicide, rape, physical injury, robbery, theft, carnapping and stealing of motorcycles as well as crimes covered by special laws and ordinances in the region.</p>
      <p>“With or without martial law we will not submit to complacency, instead we will continue in our proactive efforts against all criminal elements and terrorist groups here in SOCCSKSARGEN.  However, there is no denying that the implementation of martial law has helped us in our campaign against terrorism and criminality,” Corpus said.</p>
      <p>“But more than this, I believe that the improved services coming from the intensified police operations we conducted in coordination with the Armed Forces, the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency and our other partner-agencies as well as the support we are getting from the community are the main factors why we enjoy a peaceful and more secure environment in the entire region,” Corpus told the Journal Group.</p>
      <p>Other Mindanao-based police regional directors have also reported a significant reduction in criminality and terror-related incidents in their respective areas. They include Brig. Gen. Froilan F. Quidilla of PRO9 in Western Mindanao;  PRO10 director in Northern Mindanao, Brig. Gen. Rolando B. Anduyan; PRO11 director in Southern Mindanao, Brig. Gen. Filmore B. Escobal; PRO13 director in Caraga region, Brig. Gen. Joselito T. Esquivel Jr.;  and Bangsamoro Autonomous Region police director, Brig. Gen. Marni C. Marcos Jr.</p>
