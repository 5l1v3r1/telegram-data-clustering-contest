      <p>Following their well-received value-flagship Redmi K20 (Mi 9T) and its Pro variant in early 2019, Xiaomi is gearing up to launch the sequel and it will purportedly sport an all-new display with a speedy refresh rate.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p><a href="http://talkandroid.com/tag/xiaomi">Xiaomi</a>, like many Chinese brands, has been chasing up the value game with a new category of ‘value-flagships’ and ‘sub-flagships’ offering flagship or near-flagship specs and features, respectively, for much more reasonable prices.</p>
      <p>Xiaomi launched their offensive on both categories with their newly offshot sub-brand <a href="http://talkandroid.com/tag/redmi-k20">Redmi’s K20</a> and <a href="http://talkandroid.com/tag/redmi-k20-pro">K20 Pro</a>, known as the <a href="http://talkandroid.com/tag/mi-9t">Mi 9T</a> and <a href="http://talkandroid.com/tag/mi-9t-pro">9T Pro</a> globally, offering a full suite of cameras, bezelless display and popup camera, and excellent sub-flag<i>chip</i> <a href="http://talkandroid.com/tag/snapdragon-730">Snapdragon 730</a> or <a href="http://talkandroid.com/tag/snapdragon-855">Snapdragon 855</a> respectively, at very attractive $300US and $400US base prices. <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/reviews/xiaomi-mi-9t-redmi-k20">They are still excellent phones</a>.</p>
      <p>In even only the half-year since those phones debut, however, great leaps in mobile technology have continued to be developed, namely in the display refresh-rate technology with Redmi K20 Pro competition like <a href="http://talkandroid.com/tag/oppo">Oppo</a>‘s <a href="http://talkandroid.com/tag/realme-x2-pro">Realme X2 Pro</a> with its 90hz display (vs the standard 60hz) and the only 120hz AMOLED in the <a href="http://talkandroid.com/tag/asus-rog-phone-2">ASUS ROG Phone II</a>, and it now seems like Xiaomi will be chasing that smoothness trend with the imminent Redmi K30 (Mi 10T? Mi 10X? Mi 9+?…).</p>

      <p>These photos shared on the Chinese social media site Weibo show off the Redmi K30’s display and a few different apps revealing the device’s specs, including: a dual punch-hole camera cutout in the same place as the <a href="http://talkandroid.com/tag/galaxy-s10-plus">Galaxy S10+</a>, a 120hz max refresh rate edging out the <a href="http://talkandroid.com/tag/realme">Realme</a> X2 Pro competition, and a Snapdragon 730(G) just like the K30’s predecessor – an excellent chipset.</p>
      <p>We’ll have to wait a bit longer to see the K30’s full design, given these photos obfuscate it in what appears to be a developer case (which is designed to hide the phone as much as possible), and presumably we’ll see the full official launch within the next few weeks.</p>
      <p>Looks pretty rad.</p>
