      <h3>Key Quotes</h3>
      <p>“<a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/eurgbp"><b>EUR/GBP</b></a> has at last started to correct higher near term. We still have positive divergence on the daily RSI and may thus bounce near term. Rallies will find a minor downtrend at .8633 ahead of the four month downtrend line at .8795. Overhead <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/support-resistance">resistance</a> is reinforced by .8786 the mid-September low”.</p>
      <p>“Beyond this there is scope for the slide to extend to the .8465 2019 low. We note the TD support at .8485 and we look for the market to hold here”.</p>
