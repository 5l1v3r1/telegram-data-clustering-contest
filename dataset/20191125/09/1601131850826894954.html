      <h1>T-Mobile Galaxy S8 November security update released</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T09:16:17+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 09:16</time> by <a rel="author">Abhijeet M.</a></address>
      <p>Late last week, the November 2019 security patch <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/unlocked-samsung-galaxy-s8-gets-november-security-update-in-the-us/">was released</a> for the unlocked <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/devices/galaxy-s8/">Galaxy S8</a> and Galaxy S8+ in the US. Today, T-Mobile is rolling out the latest security update to the Galaxy S8 and S8+ on its network, becoming the first carrier to do so. The November security update for the Galaxy S8/S8+ comes a little over a week after T-Mobile’s <a href="https://support.t-mobile.com/docs/DOC-34352">previous update for the device</a>, which brought improvements to RCS messaging.</p>
      <p>The November update for Galaxy devices brings fixes for two critical vulnerabilities. One of those allows <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-camera-app-vulnerability-puts-your-privacy-at-risk">unauthorized access to a phone’s photos and videos</a> and its camera to malicious apps, while the other allows full control of a device by taking advantage of an exploit <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/october-security-patch-fixes-vulnerability-affecting-a-few-samsung-phones/">within the Chrome web browser</a>. Both vulnerabilities affect Android devices from other manufacturers as well and are not exclusive to Samsung phones and tablets.</p>
      <p>T-Mobile’s November update for the Galaxy S8 and S8+ is currently available via our firmware database (<a href="https://www.sammobile.com/samsung/galaxy-s8/firmware/SM-G950U/TMB/">S8</a> | <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/samsung/galaxy-s8-plus/firmware/SM-G955U/TMB/">S8+</a>). It doesn’t seem to have been released over the air yet, but that should change within a day or so. You can check your phone to see if it’s already available over the air by opening the Settings app and going into the <i>Software update</i> menu. The software version for the update is <b>G950USQS7DSK2</b> and <b>G950USQS7DSK2</b> for the Galaxy S8 and S8+ respectively.</p>
