      <h1>I'm A Celeb fans demand justice for James Haskell and Roman Kemp after 'impossible' trial</h1>
      <h2>But Ant and Dec said the stand-ins were able to do it</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T09:58:16+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 09:58</time> by <a rel="author">Emma Flanagan</a></address>
      <p>Last night saw the <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity</a> camp mates take part in their first live Bushtucker Trial and it was certainly a challenge.</p>
      <p>With a roast dinner for everyone up for grabs the celebs were determined to collect all 12 stars, and were on track for success after successfully winning their first nine.</p>
      <p>But, the final challenge proved too difficult for former rugby-player James Haskell and radio host Roman Kemp.</p>

      <p>They were tasked with unscrewing stars from a box on one side of the bed and re-screwing it in on the other side, with various unsavoury critters to contend with of course.</p>
      <p>But the first box, which contained a large crab, proved too challenging as James was unable to unscrew the star with the animal in the way. Fans of the show also contested the time limit, of just 90 seconds, to complete all three boxes.</p>

      <p>"That was unlucky," said Dec, "What was it, James?"</p>
      <p>A disgruntled James came back: "What was it?!</p>

      <p>"The very fact that there was a giant crab in the way that you wanted me to carefully caress in a different direction while I was trying to unscrew a star in its face."</p>
      <p>Dec mocked: "Alright, somebody's getting a bit prickly!"</p>
      <p>"The competitive spirit!" James laughed.</p>

      <p>Taking to Twitter fans described the trial as "totally unfair" with some even crying out for the camp to be given another chance to earn their lost meals.</p>
      <p>However, hosts <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/ant-dec">Ant and Dec</a> tweeted the stand-ins were able to complete the trial in the allotted time.</p>
      <p>Only capturing nine stars means three of the celebs, Ian Wright, Andy Whyment and Cliff Parisi all miss out on the roast dinners.</p>
