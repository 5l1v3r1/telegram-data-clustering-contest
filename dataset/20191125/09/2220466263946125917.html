      <p>The struggle to prevent a total collapse continues, and the crisis lingers. A key policy mistake, which led to the current financial crisis in Lebanon, is that corrective and preventive actions were not taken sooner. There is a need for collective effort by the management of Banks operating in Lebanon, their clients, and the Central Bank to rectify the situation. There is a collective responsibility here due to the failure to act in due time.At least until now, the current financial crisis is neither a crisis of default nor total insolvency; instead, it’s that of liquidity! In recent months, banks confronted nagging demands:● To secure resources to absorb losses incurred from deteriorating loan quality; since 2015, banks have been aggressively expensing their income to allocate provisions for loan loss reserves● To extend credit to struggling local businesses trying to survive the steep economic downturn● To refrain from paying dividends (including the current year 2019) and to retain the profits as instructed by the Central Bank of Lebanon.● To meet the panic-driven depositors’ demand for withdrawals, be it in cash or transfers outside of Lebanon. Banks have been meeting clients’ demands in full, provided it’s in checks (not in cash) of the same currency, and transfers outside Lebanon are excluded except when it’s for humanitarian needs – to cover child support living outside Lebanon, the imports of pharmaceutical products, wheat, and oil, just to name a few.At the root cause of this crisis we find:a) Commercial banks paid more attention to the growth and health of their uses of funds (i.e., assets – loans, holding of government securities, deposits at the Central Bank, and deposits at other financial institutions mostly correspondent banks) and setting aside enough provisions to absorb any anticipated losses from deteriorations in the quality of their assets, excluding government securities.b) Liquidity Concerns didn’t get the much-needed attention from the board of directors, nor did chief risk officers make a proper assessment of it through stress testing plausible scenarios considering the state of the economy, the political chaos, and the fate of the uses of funds.  c) In the situation as of late 2017, banks:<i>I. used all they were permitted to use, in regulation, out of their required reserves (i.e. technically used up their deposit cushion) to fund their appetite to extend housing and other types of subsidized loans;</i><i>II. noticeably reduced their holding of excess reserves and locked this excess liquidity in deposits at the central bank (BDL), which, in turn, used it to bail out an ailing fiscal government rendering the asset of the bank illiquid;      </i><i>III. favored investing their available liquidity with the troubled Central government over investing it with the private sector. Under the circumstances, both are non-liquid forms of usage of funds. </i>To add insult to injury, the Central Bank of Lebanon used most of its available liquidity to finance the mounting government deficits and helped in meeting the hard-to-satisfy spending appetite of the corrupt members of the government.To sum up, banks concentrated the majority of their uses of funds in relatively non-liquid assets; and the central bank deployed a significant portion of its available funds with the central government. Consequently, the financial community watched helplessly the emerging of the worst version of a liquidity crisis to date.However, the crisis didn’t hit all financial institutions evenly. The severity of the crisis had to do with each financial institution’s appetite for risk-taking behavior. As bad as it is, this is not the end of life in banking as we know it. The crisis is still manageable; rescue efforts remain possible; and complete recovery is, given time, possible.   <i><br/></i>The focus now should be on preserving the integrity and stability of the entire financial community in Lebanon and refrain from treating individual financial institutions as endangered species and in need of protection at any cost. Those who polluted the banking sector with their bad decisions and un-satiated risk-taking behavior must pay. Losing one, two, three or even more financial institutions is manageable – I dare say somewhat desirable! Institutions that stand strong and survive the crisis will be able to absorb losses and safeguard all depositors in failing institutions from any potential loss.Everyone who benefited from the imperfections of recent months and years must contribute to the rescue efforts.Who are they?  <i><br/></i>▪ Politicians who never had to worry about responsible government spending. Today is the time to wise up and act responsibly!▪ Depositors who enjoyed the excessively high-interest rates on their deposits combined with unrestricted access to their deposit funds be it in time and/or demand deposits. It is time to change these rules of engagement! ▪ Borrowers, households and business owners, who exploited the subsidized loanable fund market, and uncontrollably expanded their credit obligations to include exposures to banks and to shadow banks. Now is the time for abstinence! ▪ Banks that enjoyed loose regulatory enforcement and, to a greater extent, a laissez-faire banking landscape. It has been obvious that banks have been chaperoned, not regulated as they should be, by the Central Bank of Lebanon. It’s time for some whipping! The Central Bank of Lebanon needs to stop being so accommodating and to hold banks accountable for non-compliance with financial regulations. The regulator is a whip, not a chaperone!  <i><br/></i>Major efforts have been undertaken by commercial banks to protect, not to control, depositors’ funds, and to delay or completely avoid a total collapse by introducing some controls: ● Withdrawals of deposited funds outside the banking system. ● Changing the currency denomination of deposit balances from Lebanese Pound to US Dollars. ● The transfer of funds outside Lebanon.  These are controls, with well-defined boundaries, and don’t qualify as capital controls because they are not legislated; they are set and implemented at the discretion of the management of each individual bank based on its own demand for and availability of liquidity; they are circumstantial and easily revoked. Restrictions on capital flows, on the other hand, should they prove necessary, perpetuate external imbalances, and undermine trust. Any policy measure that undermines the credibility of these controls runs the risk of triggering a depositor runs. On the other hand, rumors about a haircut inflict harm and create fear; it’s unlikely to happen! However, if it happens, it’s unlikely for it to target small depositors. <i><br/></i><i>----</i><i><b>Mohammad Ibrahim Fheili is a risk &amp; capacity building expert.</b><br/></i>Related Articles <a href="https://en.annahar.com/article/1074634-the-sectarianization-of-lebanon-and-smearing-a-revolution">The sectarianization of Lebanon and smearing a revolution </a><a href="https://en.annahar.com/article/1074448-judge-orders-byblos-bank-to-release-depositors-funds"> Judge orders Lebanese bank to release depositor's funds </a><a href="https://en.annahar.com/article/1074049-key-beirut-road-reopens-after-hezbollah-amal-supporters-attack-protesters"> Key Beirut road reopens after Hezbollah, Amal supporters attack protesters</a></p>
