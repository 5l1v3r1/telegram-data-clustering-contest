      <p>MUMBAI: Japan’s SoftBank-backed <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/InMobi">InMobi</a> Group has acquired video content platform <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Roposo">Roposo</a>, as it looks to ramp up curated content on its platform <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/glance-finance-ltd/stocks/companyid-7068.cms">Glance</a> in regional Indian languages.</p>
      <p>InMobi Group also plans to take Roposo to Southeast Asia, where it launched Glance earlier this year. The company did not comment on the deal value, but industry trackers peg the cash and stock deal at $20 million.</p>
      <p>Glance will also benefit from Roposo’s popular regional-language influencers, content creators and its more than 42 million users, InMobi group founder Naveen Tewari told ET.</p>

      <p>The company recently launched Glance in Indonesian Bahasa, by leveraging the local creator market, he added. The company will now take Roposo to the Indonesia market. Glance also has a presence in Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines. “We are attempting to bring together quality content from variety of sources to be part of Glance and we found that Roposo has access to professional influencers who create high-quality video content,” said Tewari.</p>
      <p>The acquisition gives Glance ownership of Roposo’s video technology, platform and brand.</p>
      <p>Roposo started out as a fashion social network and then pivoted to a platform that offers a TV-like interface with content from regional language influencers.</p>
      <p>“Glance is a disruptive platform and we are very excited to be a part of it,” said Roposo founder Mayank Bhangadia. “We hope to bring our experience and expertise in the area of short-form video platform to deliver engaging video experiences and make Glance the dominant vernacular video platform in India and the world.”</p>
