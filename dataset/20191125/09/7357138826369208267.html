        <b>Around The Next-Gen AP Automation World</b>
      </p>
      <p>More efficient access to data and analytics is among the potential benefits that automation promises. Several companies recently launched new solutions that utilize artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to quickly and seamlessly capture data and expedite invoice processing.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bottomline.com/us">Bottomline Technologies</a>, for one, recently released an AI-powered solution designed to help North American businesses. The company recently partnered with <a href="https://www.drift.com/">Drift</a>, a provider of conversational marketing platform tools, to enable chat capabilities through Bottomline’s Paymode-X and PTX solutions.

      </p>
      <p>Reliable and trustworthy relationships are essential for businesses in the logistics market, which must deliver goods and products to recipients as quickly and efficiently as possible. New automated AP solutions promise to deliver several benefits for logistics providers, such as cost savings and more seamless access to data.

        <b>Deep Dive: AP Automation’s ROI Potential</b>
      </p>
      <p>Manual and paper-based products still persist in business-to-business (B2B) payment practices. PYMNTS research has found that 72.4 percent of AP professionals receive their invoices through postal services, while 43.8 percent receive them via fax machines. In terms of payments, a whopping 80.8 percent still use paper checks to pay invoices. There are signs, however, that AP organizations are ready to embrace change. The Tracker’s Deep Dive highlights the potential ROI for AP organizations and how these tools could prove useful when recruiting millennial candidates.</p>
