      <p>Lexi-Mae and her great-grandad Derek Woolnough had a very close bond.</p>
      <p>So when he passed away, the six-year-old gave him her Super Bunny toy so he wouldn’t be alone.</p>
      <p>She’d first given him the teddy when he went into hospital a few years earlier and it became a tradition that he would always take Super Bunny if he was ill.</p>
      <p>When her mum Danyella Senior told her that grandad was going to heaven, Lexi-Mae said that Super Bunny had to go with him.</p>
      <p>But she asked if she could get another one so they could talk to eachother.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, the toy, which was from Asda, had been bought years earlier and was now discontinued.</p>
      <p>Desperate Danyella put out a plea on Facebook to find another one but she had no luck.</p>
      <p>But the team at Asda’s head office picked up her plea and they got in touch with the manufacturer to find another bunny.</p>

      <p>Luckily, they still had a few left and they shipped it over to Danyella’s local Harlow store, where community champion Rachel Forth and store manager Steve Chamberlain gave it to Lexi-Mae.</p>

      <p>Teacher Danyella said: ‘I really can’t thank Asda enough for doing all this. It’s absolutely fantastic. Lexi-Mae was so close to her great-grandad.</p>
      <p>‘When she received it she smiled and said “It’s Super Bunny, just like grandad’s”. She hasn’t put it down yet. She’s even taken it to school.</p>
      <p>‘My grandad was my idol. I was so close to him and so was Lexi-Mae. We saw him at least two or three times a week. She loved him.</p>
      <p>‘I was speechless, totally gobsmacked when I got the message that you had found us one. It’s made a really difficult time a little easier.’</p>
      <p>Harlow store’s manager Steve said: ‘Lexi-Mae looked really happy to have her little toy and her mum was extremely grateful for all the support we had given her.</p>
      <p>‘It was the right thing to do. We were just happy to have helped.’</p>
