      <p>Midfielder Antoni Sarcevic is Plymouth Live’s Argyle Player-of-the-Month for November.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/all-about/plymouth-argyle">The Pilgrims</a> have only had three matches this month, winning all of them, and Sarcevic has been in excellent form.</p>
      <p>Their next game is not until Sunday, December 1, when they travel to Bristol Rovers in the FA Cup second round.</p>
      <p>Sarcevic’s average rating for November was 8.00, which included a mark of nine out of 10 in the 2-1 League Two victory over Bradford City at Home Park on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The 27-year-old was also the Star Man for Argyle when he scored the winning goal in the 1-0 triumph at Forest Green Rovers the previous weekend.</p>
      <p>Sarcevic had been the runner-up in the Plymouth Live Argyle ratings to Will Aimson in September and George Cooper in October.</p>
      <p>Now his consistent form has seen him come out on top in the November rankings.</p>
      <p>The runner-up to Sarcevic was Joe Edwards, who has averaged 7.66 from three games after moving to right wing-back from the holding midfield role.</p>
      <p>Edwards, who recently became the father to twin boys Alfie and Louie, grabbed the Pilgrims’ second goal in the defeat of Bradford.</p>
      <p>In joint third place with an average mark of 7.33 for November were defenders Niall Canavan and Scott Wootton, plus Josh Grant.</p>
      <p>The latter has impressed in the holding midfield role vacated by Edwards over the last three matches.</p>
