      <p>She then said she thought the reality TV star had “nice contacts,” hair, and that she was a fan of “the line around her lip.”</p>
      <p>Leakes’ fellow “WWHL” guest Kelly Rowland and host Cohen laughed nervously as she made the comments.</p>
      <p>Leakes’ latest comments come after <a href="https://etcanada.com/news/536347/nene-leakes-reacts-to-kenya-moore-on-the-wendy-williams-show/">Moore accused her of spitting on her during an appearance on “The Wendy Williams Show”,</a> something Leakes was quick to deny.</p>
      <p><a href="https://etcanada.com/news/535040/kenya-moore-says-rhoa-co-star-nene-leakes-tried-to-spit-on-her/">Moore also spoke about the alleged spitting incident</a> during her own appearance on “WWHL”.</p>
