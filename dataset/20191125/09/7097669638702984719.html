      <p>By Guy Faulconbridge and William James</p>
      <p>LONDON (Reuters) - Former prime minister Tony Blair said on Monday that Britain was in a dangerous mess and that neither his own Labour Party nor Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservatives deserved to win a Dec. 12 election.</p>
      <p>Britain is holding an election three years ahead of schedule because parliament was deadlocked over Brexit, unable to agree on how or even whether to leave the European Union.</p>
      <p>"We're a mess," Blair said at a Reuters Newsmaker event. "The buoyancy of the world economy has kept us going up to now, but should that falter, we will be in deep trouble."</p>
      <p>Blair, Labour prime minister from 1997 to 2007, said both major parties were peddling fantasies, adding that if the opinion polls were accurate, Johnson's party looked likely to win a majority.</p>
      <p>Blair, the only Labour leader to win three elections, said his party was now controlled by its "Marxist-Leninist wing" and that its leader Jeremy Corbyn was promising a revolution.</p>
      <p>"The problem with revolutions is never how they begin but how they end," said Blair. "The problem with revolutions is that they always end badly."</p>
      <p>"The truth is: the public aren't convinced either main party deserves to win this election outright."</p>
      <p>The Dec. 12 vote presents a stark choice between a socialist-run state under Labour, which is offering a second referendum on leaving the EU, and the free-market Conservatives, who want to "get Brexit done" by the end of January.</p>
      <p>RISK OF NO-DEAL BREXIT</p>
      <p>Blair, an opponent of Brexit, argued for a second referendum on the decision to leave, saying it would need to be followed by another general election.</p>
      <p>Johnson has pledged to take Britain out of the EU by Jan. 31 if he wins a parliamentary majority and then to negotiate a comprehensive deal with the bloc covering trade and future relations during a transition period due to end next December.</p>
      <p>Blair cast doubt on that timetable and said there was still a risk that Britain could exit the EU in a year's time without having struck a deal with its biggest trading partner.</p>
      <p>"No-deal Brexit is not off the table," Blair said. "This negotiation (on the future relationship) has no chance of being concluded in that transition period."</p>
      <p>Blair said he did not know whether Labour, which has tacked sharply to the left under Corbyn, would ever return to the center ground of British politics, but added: "We must set about the urgent task of reconstructing the sensible mainstream of British politics."</p>
      <p>"Otherwise, this laboratory experiment in populism running riot will end very badly for our nation."</p>
