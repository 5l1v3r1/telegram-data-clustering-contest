      <h1>Fitness influencer Cassey Maynard cried tears of joy after her breast implant 'explant'</h1>
      <h2>"I remember unwrapping the bandages in front of the mirror ready to cry my eyes out, but I actually cried tears of joy."</h2>

      <p>I’m a Sydney-based <a href="https://www.casseymaynard.com/">personal trainer</a> wellness expert who's super passionate about living a balanced life and loving the skin you’re in, but this wasn’t always the case.</p>
      <p>Growing up in my teens and into my twenties I had a very <a href="https://www.bodyandsoul.com.au/health/kelly-clarkson-lost-16kg-but-heres-why-shell-love-her-body-no-matter-what-size-she-is/news-story/626ed0cd8a87aeeb8244473a2662740d">negative relationship with my body</a>. I always felt I was fat, and my shoulders were too board. (Possibly because everyone used to tell me I looked like a swimmer… not cool when hormones are on overdrive.) When I hit the age of 25,<a href="https://www.bodyandsoul.com.au/health/health-advice/what-to-ask-before-having-breast-implants/news-story/68528d147589fa4912270ff05b2244d3"> I decided to get breast implants</a>.</p>
      <h3>Before implants</h3>
      <p>At the time I was living in Dubai working as an air hostess for Emirates. I felt I was not good enough and I was constantly comparing myself to all the beautiful and exotic girls I worked alongside so I joined the ‘plastic fantastic’ trend to fit in and <a href="https://www.bodyandsoul.com.au/diet/body-confidence/weight-watchers-naked-issue-3-women-bare-all-to-celebrate-body-confidence-and-bravery/news-story/628032366dd0f76125450e8dee1eb698">feel better about myself</a>.</p>
      <h3>There were complications</h3>
      <p>The operation all went well but a few months post I developed an air bubble in one of my breasts which meant I had to undergo corrective surgery when I moved back to Australia.</p>
      <p>Of course, <a href="https://www.bodyandsoul.com.au/health/womens-health/why-you-need-to-be-wary-of-highly-textured-implants/news-story/f23c2a1200398999e0b350b8974cd2cd">I decided to go bigger</a>, because I still didn’t feel confident in my own skin and I ended up with a whopping E cup and a very expensive pair of boobies. At the time I didn’t think they were that big. In fact, I bloody loved them and was very happy with my body… especially when naked!</p>

      <h3>Things started to change</h3>
      <p>It wasn’t until I made the transition into the health industry six years ago that I started to feel self-conscious. It was uncomfortable to exercise, and I was constantly trying to cover up my very large breasts because I didn’t want to get the wrong type of attention. They just weren't my 'vibe' anymore.</p>
      <p>The thoughts around the removal of them really started to come when I went on more of spiritual journey at the beginning of 2018. I learnt the practice of <a href="https://www.bodyandsoul.com.au/mind-body/wellbeing/how-meghan-markles-favourite-form-of-meditation-changed-my-life/news-story/a7fce58604d37fb66846c0b2acc26f8a">Vedic meditation</a> and meditating twice a day for 20 minutes got me to really tune in to my body and discover the ‘true’ me. It really gave me the clarity to see that health is my number one value in life, and <a href="https://www.bodyandsoul.com.au/beauty/body/pete-evans-wife-is-having-her-toxic-breasts-removed/news-story/e5ac6b173d7307d33805691f605a4731">having foreign objects in my body</a> just didn’t fit that.</p>
      <h3>And the decision was made</h3>
      <p>In April this year I had another issue with one of my breasts. It shifted and <a href="https://www.bodyandsoul.com.au/health/health-news/my-breast-implants-completely-ruined-my-health/news-story/27d772649714f13c264902af16ca079f">caused me to feel very unwell</a>. This was when I knew it was time. I started to research the removal and discovered a Facebook group called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BreastImplantIllnessSymptons/">Breast implant Illness Awareness</a> which helped make the decision to explant. The women on the page were all very supportive of each other and it really helped calm my nerves and confirm that I was making the right choice. I found an amazing doctor in Sydney and within a few weeks my operation was booked and paid for.</p>
      <p>The lead up to the removal was fuelled with anxiety, stress, sleepless nights and plenty of tears but when the big day finally arrived, I was so ready and just wanted them out!</p>

      <h3>Finally the day arrived</h3>
      <p>Everything went smoothly and the doctor was happy with the results although he said they were ‘very small’ and I might be shocked. I recovered with my family in Newcastle, and I had to keep them strapped up like a mummy, unable to see my new gals until day five. I had barely had any pain and I was up and about walking the next day. This was a very different experience as to when I got the implants in.</p>
      <h3>The big reveal</h3>
      <p>The big reveal on day five was scary. I remember unwrapping the bandages in front of the mirror ready to cry my eyes out, but I actually cried tears of joy. They looked a little deflated but after 11 years with implants that’s to be expected. I was in love with my new/old boobies and I couldn’t stop looking down and smiling at them in the shower.</p>
      <p>Fast forward six months post-explant and I’ve never felt happier with my body. I’m obsessed with my new/old little B cups and feel so much healthier. I’ve got my energy back and for the first time in as long as I can remember. I also had my blood tests done and they came back with absolutely no deficiencies. I’ve also been told by numerous people that I seem more open and the best version of myself, so I’m pretty certain I made the correct decision.</p>
      <p>Now I’m here to share my story to help others on their explant journey. You can find me on Instagram at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/cassey.maynard/">@cassey.maynard</a>.</p>
