      <p>Kristina and Matt Juarez were both immediately <a href="https://www.kiro7.com/news/local/covington-couple-trying-to-track-down-family-in-recently-discovered-photos/1012215183">drawn to a vintage photo of the Seattle skyline</a>.</p>
      <p>"We both grew up in the area, so I thought it was kind of a unique picture since the city is changing so much over the years to have an iconic shot of Seattle with the mountain in the background, the Kingdome," Matt said.</p>
      <p>They bought it at Renton's Goodwill four years ago. But it's been sitting in storage ever since they moved into their Covington home last year.</p>
      <p>"The other day, we pulled it out and I got curious. I wonder if there's a date on the back or if there's any information on this photo in the back of this picture?" Kristina said.</p>
      <p>So, <a href="https://www.kiro7.com/news/local/covington-couple-trying-to-track-down-family-in-recently-discovered-photos/1012215183">she started taking it apart</a> and discovered that all along, hidden behind the Seattle skyline picture were two family portraits.</p>
      <p>"I was surprised when I found the first one and I was really shocked when I found the second one," Kristina said.</p>
      <p>It's the same family of four in both portraits. They appear to be taken a few years apart. In one, the mother's hair color is blonde. The kids look older in the two images.</p>
      <p>"Matt said, 'Throw it on Facebook. See if somebody knows these people.' You know, the power of Facebook," Kristina said.</p>
      <p>"We figured they were local maybe since they were stuffed behind the Seattle photo," Matt said.</p>
      <p>There's a letter "C" written on the duct tape on the back of one of the pictures and also a "C" written on the frame, but not much else to go on.</p>
      <p>Kristina and Matt are just hoping to return these precious pictures.</p>
      <p>"It's the holidays. It's a special family time of year," Kristina said. "I think it would be really special. I would be touched if I had somebody contact me and said we have old family photos of you as a kid that you've never seen. I think that would be really cool."</p>
