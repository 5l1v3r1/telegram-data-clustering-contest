      <p>Circus goers were left screaming in horror as an acrobat plunged more than 30ft during a performance yesterday evening.</p>
      <p>It's understood that Jackie Armstrong's foot slipped from her loop at Zippos Christmas Circus Show at Winter Wonderland in London's Hyde Park.</p>

      <p>The circus was evacuated as paramedics went to the 35-year-old entertainer's aid following the 6pm performance.</p>
      <p>An audience member told <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7720795/Circus-horror-female-acrobat-crashes-30ft-floor-screaming-families.html">Mail Online</a>: "The lady had one foot in the loop with no actual harness and her foot slipped out and she fell to the floor diagonally.</p>
      <p>"Kids were on the front row and there were people screaming. She was yelping in agony, it was traumatic as she bounced as she hit the floor.</p>
      <p>"There was an announcement after a minute or two to all leave."</p>
      <p>Another witness told <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10414238/winter-wonderland-horror-as-female-acrobat-hurt-in-30ft-circus-ring-fall-watched-by-screaming-families/">Sun Online</a>: "It was horrific. I thought it was part of the act but when she didn’t get back up I knew something was wrong.</p>
      <p>"A group of people ran on to help her and people were shouting for a paramedic."</p>
      <p>A spokesman for Zippos said: "The female British artist, Jackie Armstrong, performs an aerial act and is a highly experienced circus artist with 10 years in the ring.</p>
      <p>"Jackie was immediately attended to on the scene by first aiders and an ambulance called. She was taken to hospital by ambulance and further information on the nature of her injuries is awaited.</p>
      <p>"Immediately following the incident, audience members were asked to leave the Big Top and offered tickets for the next performance that evening."</p>

      <p>Circus Founder and Director Martin Burton told MailOnline: "Jackie is a very experienced artist whom we value dearly as part of our circus family.</p>
      <p>"Clearly we are concerned and offering her and her family our full support and sympathy at this time.</p>
      <p>"At this stage we cannot comment further as we have no information on any injuries she may have sustained."</p>
