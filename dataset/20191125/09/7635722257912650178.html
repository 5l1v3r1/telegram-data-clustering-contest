        <b>Police in Spain have arrested two people after intercepting a submarine off its north-west coast.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The submersible contained around 3, 000 kilos of cocaine, Spanish state broadcaster<b><a href="http://www.rtve.es/noticias/20191124/interceptan-narcosubmarino-3000-kilos-cocaina-costa-gallega/1992417.shtml"> TVE reports</a>.</b></p>
      <p>The submarine had come from a country in Latin America and arrived in Spain on Sunday.</p>
      <p>A third person who was on-board is reportedly on the run.</p>
      <p>Authorities are trying to re-float the submarine, which is 20 meters long.</p>
      <p>Investigators are also trying to clarify whether the submarine had sailed from South America to Spain with the drugs - or whether they picked up the cargo en-route.</p>
      <p>It was discovered off the coast of Galicia, in an area known asÂ Morrazo.</p>
