      <h1>Why Carrie Lam should consider amnesty for arrested protesters</h1>

      <p>Following the District Council elections on Sunday, when voters were able to let off steam through the ballot box, street clashes between protesters and the police are likely to ease off for a brief period of time.</p>
      <p>I believe the SAR government should seize this precious window of opportunity to do something to resolve the current crisis.</p>
      <p>After the DC race, the administration can announce that it is going to set up an independent commission of inquiry, which will be headed by a highly credible figure and will start working on January 1, 2020.</p>
      <p>The chief executive can also make further concessions by offering amnesty to those who committed crimes related to the protests before New Year’s Eve, thereby allowing the city to make a fresh start in 2020.</p>
      <p>Although the independent commission of inquiry itself will not be pressing criminal charges, it can enhance public confidence in the fairness of the prosecution brought by the Department of Justice against arrested the protesters.</p>
      <p>Instead of just allowing the tit-for-tat between the police and the protesters to go on, I believe my suggestion of granting pardon to those who have violated the law before the arrival of January 1, 2020 can reduce the level of animosity between the two sides.</p>
      <p>It is inevitable that some people would be fiercely opposed to establishing an independent inquiry and offering amnesty to protesters.</p>
      <p>But if the chief executive is not sure which side she should listen to, there is one thing she must keep in mind: whoever advised her to press ahead with the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance in the first place, which has proven a political misjudgment of catastrophic proportions, must be wrong.</p>
