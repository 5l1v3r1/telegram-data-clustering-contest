      <p>Jyotiraditya Scindia sheds Congress identity on Twitter. Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra do not wish Kamal Nath on his birthday. More than 20 Congress MPs and MLAs have reportedly gone missing, a development vehemently denied by Scindia. What is brewing in the Congress in Madhya Pradesh?</p>
      <p>All beat reporters and political commentators know that the Madhya Pradesh Congress is faction-ridden. The party won the 2018 Madhya Pradesh Assembly election in spite of the factionalism. Former Chief Minister and Congress veteran Digvijaya Singh had tilted the balance in favour of Kamal Nath during the Madhya Pradesh election. This was not taken lightly by the supporters of Jyotiraditya Scindia.</p>
      <p>Now, there are reports claiming that between 20 and 30 MLAs and MPs have gone incommunicado. The party leadership not Scindia camp, according to reports has not been able to establish contact with these leaders for past few days.</p>
      <p>The reports have been topped up with a revelation that Jyotiraditya Scindia has shed his Congress identity on Twitter, a platform used by politicians to air their anguish particularly in cases when their voice is not heard on the party forum.</p>
      <p>
        <b>SCINDIA PADS WEAK DEFENCE</b>
      </p>
      <p>Scindia tried to play down his move to drop references to his Congress links on Twitter saying he changed it a month back as he received feedback about his previous bio being very long.</p>
      <p>In place of his Congress identity, Scindia chose to declare himself as public servant and cricket enthusiast. Hypothetically, Scindia could have simply declared himself a Congress leader. This could have been a shorter bio than his current one.</p>
      <p>So, his argument that his previous Twitter bio was very long prompting him to opt for shorter one is only deflection, which most batsmen in the game of cricket do while batting on a dicey pitch. Madhya Pradesh politics is certainly a treacherous pitch.</p>
      <p>
        <b>MISSING FOR CONG, NOT SCINDIA?</b>
      </p>
      <p>This is where the story of missing MPs and MLAs connects the last dot with dissent of Scindia. It was he who not only rejected the reports that the MLAs and MPs are missing but also offered to connect with them on phone.</p>
      <p>He said, This is utter rubbish. Who is missing, tell me the name, I will make you talk to him/her. This certainly establishes that Scindia holds a commanding position with regard to these reported missing leaders.</p>
      <p>These leaders are said to be the same who have been demanding a change of Congress leadership in Madhya Pradesh. They want Kamal Nath to be replaced as the Madhya Pradesh chief minister with Jyotiraditya Scindia.</p>
      <p>
        <b>THERE IS A RAHUL GANDHI ANGLE</b>
      </p>
      <p>The revival of the rivalry between Scindia and Kamal Nath takes the battle to the Congress’s national headquarters, where the old guard is holding the fort but against the Young Turks of Rahul Gandhi camp. Scindia is a key member of the Rahul Gandhi camp.</p>
      <p>Scindia was sidelined by the old guard of the Congress party after Rahul Gandhi resigned and Sonia Gandhi took over as interim president in the aftermath of the Lok Sabha election defeat.</p>
      <p>The tussle between the Rahul Gandhi camp and the old guard is not limited to Madhya Pradesh Sanjay Nirupam has virtually revolted in Maharashtra where the Congress has joined hands with the Shiv Sena but the internal fight for supremacy appears the fiercest in Madhya Pradesh.</p>
      <p>Whatever signal and importance it might carry, Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi were conspicuous by their absence in wishing Kamal Nath on his 73rd birthday, on November 18. A press statement from the Kamal Nath’s office said those wished him included Prime Minister Narendra Modi and many other leaders Scindia being one of them. But Rahul Gandhi did not feature in the official release.</p>
      <p>
        <b>BACK TO SCINDIA SHOW, OR SINGE?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Aligned to Rahul Gandhi camp, Scindia supporters have been found to be creating trouble for the Kamal Nath government often providing ammunition to the BJP to launch fresh attack on the Congress government every now and then.</p>
      <p>Recently, Scindia himself took on the Kamal Nath government questioning the implementation of the loan waiver scheme for the farmers. He also attacked the Kamal Nath government over flood relief measures and on the issue of power cuts.</p>
      <p>In September, Scindia had hit out at Kamal Nath and Digvijaya Singh. He asked Kamal Nath to stop outside interference in the government. This came in the backdrop of Madhya Pradesh minister Umang Singhar accusing Digvijaya Singh of running a proxy government in the state. Many allege that Kamal Nath does not rein in Digvijaya Singh as he feels obliged to his one-time rival.</p>
      <p>Clearly, there is no love lost between Jyotiraditya Scindia and Kamal Nath but no one for sure knows what is brewing in Madhya Pradesh Congress right now, with speculation that the BJP may be ready to welcome dissenting Congress leaders and MLAs to effect a political switch hit. After all, Scindia has declared himself a cricket enthusiast.</p>
