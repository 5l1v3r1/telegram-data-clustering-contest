      <p>French luxury goods conglomerate LVMH has agreed to buy US jeweler Tiffany &amp; Co in a deal worth US$16.2 billion, according to an announcement on Monday.</p>
      <p>“The acquisition of Tiffany will strengthen LVMH’s position in jewelry and further increase its presence in the United States,” LVMH and Tiffany said in a joint statement, Reuters reports.</p>
      <p>The transaction will “provide further support, resources and momentum,” Tiffany CEO Alessandro Bogliolo said in the statement.</p>
      <p>The companies said they expect to close the deal in mid-2020.</p>
      <p>Tiffany said in the statement its board of directors recommended that shareholders approve the transaction with LVMH.</p>
      <p>The US$135-per share cash deal will boost LVMH’s smallest business, the jewelry and watch division that is already home to Bulgari and Tag Heuer, Reuters noted.</p>
      <p>Fashion and accessories brands including Christian Dior generate the bulk of earnings at LVMH, run by France’s richest man, Bernard Arnault, though growth in jewelry has shone in recent years.</p>
      <p>The swoop on Tiffany involved revised offers from LVMH after its original US$120 per share bid in October.</p>
      <p>The revised price tag represents a 7.5 percent premium over Tiffany’s closing share level on Friday, and is more than 50 percent higher than where the stock price stood before LVMH’s interest emerged, the report noted.</p>
