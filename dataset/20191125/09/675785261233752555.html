      <h2>Arsenal dropped two points at the Emirates to relegation-threatened Southampton on the weekend and have now gone a staggering six games without winning under Unai Emery</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T09:15:02+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 09:15</time> by <a rel="author">Jake Polden, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/jake-polden/</a></address>
      <p>The Arsenal players have reportedly lost faith in Unai Emery and no longer believe he has what it takes to save their season.</p>
      <p>The Gunners have failed to win in their last six and are on a downward spiral under the Spaniard in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>As things stand <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> are as close to the relegation zone as they are the Champions League places, and as you would expect, Emery is under intense pressure to turn things around or face being sacked.</p>
      <p>Arsenal head of football Raul Sanllehi has backed his compatriot to get the club firing again.</p>
      <p>The Spaniard has even been trying to convince the other board members that Emery is still the right man for the job, but time is quickly running out for the Arsenal boss.</p>

      <p>It's safe to say that things are looking bleak for Emery, and according to <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/24/arsenal-players-lose-faith-unai-emery-stuttering-bid-qualify/">The Telegraph,</a> they may be getting even worse.</p>
      <p>The paper is reporting that Arsenal players have been confused by their manager's tactics and instructions and are concerned by the direction he is taking the club.</p>
      <p>Many reportedly feel that Arsenal has no identity under the Spaniard, and they lack the belief that he has what it takes to turn things around.</p>

      <p>Emery said: "The club are supporting me every day and also I have a responsibility.</p>
      <p>"I know I can do better, I can take more performances with the players and I'm going to try to do that. Now my job is to analyse, to try to move on with confidence with the players.</p>

      <p>"It's difficult but we need to move on in the next days. After analysing that match we are going to play at home again on Thursday, prepare as well as possible.</p>
      <p>"We know, and I know, that we need to connect with our supporters."</p>
