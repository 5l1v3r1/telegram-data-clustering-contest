      <h1>One year on from debut and Will Huffer’s Leeds United future looks bleak</h1>
      <h2>The 21-year-old goalie appears to have fallen down the pecking order at Leeds United.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T09:15:08+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 09:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/mathewcoull/" target="_blank">Mathew Nash</a></address>
      <p>Back on the 24th of November 2018, Leeds United took on Bristol City and won that game 2-0 thanks to goals from Kemar Roofe and Pablo Hernandez. </p>
      <p>It was a typical Leeds team on the day, except for one surprise debutant. </p>
      <p>Will Huffer was in goal after injuries to both Bailey Peacock-Farrell and Jamal Blackman. The young stopper handled himself well on the night and remained the second-choice stopper for Leeds until January. </p>
      <p>But in the 12 months since it does not appear that Huffer has progressed the way he would have liked at Leeds United. </p>

      <p>Huffer eventually lost his second-place standing when Kiko Casilla arrived from Real Madrid. He headed out to Barnet on loan and, in the summer, signed a one-year contract extension to remain at Leeds until next summer. </p>
      <p>However, it is hard to see him sticking around beyond that point. </p>
      <p>Casilla remains number one, whilst Lorient loanee Ilan Meslier is the current number two. But it seems Huffer has even lost his position as third in line. Kamil Miazek has been on the bench instead of Huffer when Meslier has been dropped due to loan player restrictions. </p>
      <p>The 21-year-old, who is a former England under-18 international, might have thought that his big break a year ago was the start of his Leeds United first-team chances. </p>
      <p>However, it appears that might end up being the peak of his time at Elland Road.</p>
