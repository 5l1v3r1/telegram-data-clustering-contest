      <p><b>UPDATE:</b> Black Friday has always been a good time to pick up a new TV. There should be a great range of 4K TVs on sale, whether you're after the latest and greatest tech, or simply something affordable.</p>
      <p>Smaller HD TVs are so cheap these days that taking hundreds off the RRP isn't actually possible considering you can pick up a 40-Inch 4K TV for less than £300.</p>

To back this up Currys is promising to refund the difference on any deals that turn out cheaper on Black Friday, on November 29. This is available on purchases made between November 13 - 21, but these dates may alter as we approach Black Friday and the end of the month. If you want to take advantage of this offer, you can register your details within 14 days of purchasing and claim any difference back during the assigned dates of December 17 - 31.</p>
