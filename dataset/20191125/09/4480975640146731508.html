      <h1>Former UK PM Blair: Chances of Labour majority government are negligible if polls are right</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T09:27:51+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 09:27</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fxstreet.com/author/dhwani-mehta" target="_blank">Dhwani Mehta</a></address>
      <p>At a Reuters Newsmaker event on Monday, former British Prime Minister Tony Blair said that the UK was in a mess.</p>
      <h3>Further Comments:</h3>
      <p>The UK is testing whether a major developed nation can turn its politics into chaos and survive without serious economic and social damage.</p>
      <p>If the buoyancy of the world economy should falter, "we will be in deep trouble".</p>
      <p>The public aren't convinced either main party deserve to win this election outright.</p>
      <p>Both major parties are peddling "fantasies".</p>
      <p>No deal <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/macroeconomics/events/brexit">Brexit</a> is not off the table, it is the probable outcome if conservatives stick to their plans.</p>
      <p>Labour party is promising a revolution.</p>
      <p>The problem with revolutions is never how they begin but how they end.</p>
      <p>Suggests second referendum followed by another election is required.</p>
      <p>This election is the weirdest of my life time.</p>
      <p>We must urgently reconstruct the sensible mainstream of British politics.</p>
      <p>If not, "laboratory experiment in populism running riot, will end very badly for our nation".</p>
      <p>It looks like, if the polls are right, that there will be a Conservative majority.</p>
      <p>Chances of Labour majority government are negligible if polls are right.</p>
      <p>People want this mess to end.</p>
      <p>All the spending promises being made are treating people like fools.</p>
      <p>I will vote Labour - I have to.</p>
