      <h1>Kylian Mbappe names Barcelona star as favourite to win Ballon d'Or</h1>
      <h2>The PSG forward has been nominated as one of the 30 candidates for the prestigious award but has backed another attacking player to win it over him</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T09:45:39+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 09:45</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Milne</a></address>
      <p>Paris Saint-Germain star Kylian Mbappe believes Lionel Messi deserves to win the Ballon d'Or this year following his sensational performances for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fc-barcelona">Barcelona</a> .</p>
      <p>The Argentinean forward, who has won the award five times before, has scored a stunning 39 goals in 41 appearances for his club in 2019, creating 12 assists, while he has also added another five goals in 10 games for his country.</p>
      <p>The 32-year-old is the second favourite to win the award behind Liverpool's Virgil Van Dijk, who was instrumental in helping his side win the Champions League last season.</p>
      <p>Mbappe, however, is in no doubt that Messi should win the award.</p>

      <p>When asked about his opinion in an interview with German outlet <a href="https://www.spiegel.de/plus/kylian-mbappe-ich-weiss-schon-ich-bin-nicht-gott-a-00000000-0002-0001-0000-000167093496">Der Spiegel</a> Mbappe said: "Messi. In individual terms, he was the best this year."</p>
      <p>Messi beat Van Dijk and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/cristiano-ronaldo">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> to the FIFA Best Men's Player award in September, and it looks like it will be those three competing for the top three spots again at the Ballon d'Or.</p>
      <p>The ceremony will take place in Paris on December 2, and there is plenty of Premier League interest, with a total of 15 players nominated for the award who ply their trade in England's top flight.</p>

      <p>Messi has won the award the joint-most number times along with Cristiano Ronaldo on five each, with last year's prize going to Luka Modric following his impressive performances in the World Cup for Croatia and Champions League and La Liga for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> .</p>
