      <h1>Sam Warburton omits two All Blacks greats in 'best international team he's faced' XV</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T09:26:57+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 09:26</time> by <a rel="author">Ian Cameron</a></address>
      <p>Sam Warburton has snubbed two All Black greats in his ‘best international team he’s faced’ XV.</p>
      <p>The former Welsh backrow – who retired last year – named the team in his new autobiography – <i>Open Side</i>.</p>
      <p>However, there was no room for two of New Zealand’s all-time greats, Dan Carter or Richie McCaw.</p>
      <p>Instead Warburton plumped for <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/brumbies/players/david-pocock/">David Pocock</a> at 7, who he described as ‘the single hardest player I ever faced’.</p>
      <p>Instead of Carter, he opted for <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/england">England</a> legend Jonny Wilkinson at flyhalf.</p>

      </p>
      <p>“One of my all-time heroes. I wanted to be like him – I saw how hard he trained, and I modelled myself on that,” he wrote.</p>
      <p>Both Carter and McCaw do make the subs bench, so shouldn’t feel too down-hearted, as both made the replacements bench.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere in the team there was room for plenty of other New Zealanders – with nine of the final 23 having represented the land of long white cloud.</p>
      <p>Warburton previously admitted to having an unwillingness to bow before All Black great McCaw, last year admitting he never wanted to swap jerseys with the New Zealander.</p>
      <p>“I don’t want to give them, or give them the perception, that I’m giving them respect,” he said.</p>
      <p>“If they want my shirt, they can ask me, but I’m not asking them for a shirt.</p>
      <p>“I want to be this young guy who doesn’t care, who just wants to play and who just wants to knock his head off.”</p>
