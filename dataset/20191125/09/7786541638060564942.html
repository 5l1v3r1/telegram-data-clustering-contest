      <p><b>BERLINÂ (AP)</b> - A closely watched survey is showing that German business confidence has increased slightly.</p>
      <p>The Ifo institute said Monday that its monthly confidence index edged up to 95.0 points in November from 94.7 in October.</p>
      <p>The survey is based on responses from some 9,000 firms in Germany, Europe's biggest economy.</p>
      <p>Their assessment of their current situation rose to 97.9 points from 97.8, while their expectations for the coming six months increased to 92.1 points from 91.6.</p>
      <p>Analysts had widely predicted that Germany's economy entered a technical recession in the third quarter, but figures released earlier this month instead showed quarterly growth of 0.1%.</p>
      <p>Still, businesses remain cautious in light of the U.S.-China trade war and uncertainty related to Britain's departure from the European Union.</p>
