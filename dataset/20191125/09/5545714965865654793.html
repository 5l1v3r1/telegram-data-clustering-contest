      <p>Capcom continue to pump exciting new content into its epic adventure title <i>Monster Hunter: World</i>. Publishers tend to do that kind of thing when a game turns out to be their biggest and most successful release of all time. A new trailer gives us a look at the next gargantuan beastie headed your way, the Stygian Zinogre.<br/><br/>Making its series debut back in 2011's <i>Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate,</i> the Stygian Zinogre is a fearsome giant, typified by its spiny exterior and black, white and red colouring. It draws its blood-red lightning attacks from the ethereal bugs that swarm around its body, allowing for devastating damage to its opponent. That's you, buddy boy.</p>

      <p>The Stygian Zinogre is expected to arrive in-game on December 5, and will be found wandering a brand new region set within the frozen Tundra of the Guiding Lands. If that wasn't even, then <a href="https://twitter.com/monsterhunter/status/1198513650954309632?s=20">the <i>Monster Hunter</i> Twitter also appears to be teasing a second giant,</a> which looks like a new or returning Elder Dragon. Better get your gear packed.<br/><br/>Finally, Capcom has also released a new image for what appears to be a Chinese New Year seasonal event. Although no further details were forthcoming, from the calendar we can ascertain that this event will likely take place in January.<br/><br/><br/><i>Monster Hunter World: Iceborne</i> is available now on PS4 and Xbox One. The <i>Iceborne</i> expansion is headed to PC early in 2020.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.siliconera.com/stygian-zinogre-steals-the-spotlight-for-monster-hunter-world-icebornes-second-monster-update/">Stygian Zinogre steals the spotlight for Monster Hunter: World</a> [Siliconera]</p>
