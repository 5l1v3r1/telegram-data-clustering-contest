      <p>Tehran (AFP) - Iran on Monday rejected a US court order for Tehran to pay $180 million in damages to a Washington Post reporter for jailing him on espionage charges.</p>
      <p>Jason Rezaian spent 544 days in an Iranian prison before he was released in January 2016 in exchange for seven Iranians held in the United States.</p>
      <p>On Friday, a US district court judge ordered damages be paid to Rezaian and his family in compensation for pain and suffering as well as economic losses.</p>
      <p>The Iranian foreign ministry's spokesman described the journalist's decision to seek damages as "strange".</p>
      <p>"Mr Jason Rezaian... was a security convict and the Islamic Republic of Iran commuted his (sentence of maximum punishment) to imprisonment," said spokesman Abbas Mousavi.</p>
      <p>"He was pardoned and despite having an open case... he was released," Mousavi told a news conference in Tehran.</p>
      <p>"For him to go there and lodge a complaint and for American courts to lavishly determine such figures" was a course of action that Iran "rejects", said Mousavi.</p>
      <p>"This was a favour that the Islamic Republic of Iran did for him," he said, adding that he could have been kept behind bars and punished more severely.</p>
      <p>Mousavi said Iran could itself take similar legal action against the United States, without elaborating.</p>
      <p>Relations between arch-foes Tehran and Washington plunged to a new low in May last year when the US withdrew from an international accord that gave Iran relief from sanctions in return for curbs on its nuclear programme.</p>
      <p>Rezaian and three other Americans were released on January 16, 2016, the day the nuclear agreement entered into force.</p>
