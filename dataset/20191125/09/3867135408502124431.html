      <p>Well, here we go again. The lawsuits against Initiative 976 are claiming all sorts of wrongs, except the will of the people, again. Why do we even vote?</p>
      <p>Why did these plaintiffs (cities, counties, transit authorities, etc. ) not fight the initiative before a vote, claiming it was unconstitutional, vague, over-reaching and the like. How were the same entities allowed to sell bonds on an uncertain matter; they all knew this was coming and the prior will of the people?</p>
      <p>Oh, not to worry, the state’s Attorney General is the one that will represent the voters. Yes, the same guy who, on the front page of his October Ferguson File publication, brags that his daily work involves “defeating the president.”</p>
      <p>Are the voters in good hands?</p>
