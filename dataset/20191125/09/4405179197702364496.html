      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T09:35:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 09:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.macworld.co.uk/author/karen-haslam/" target="_blank">Karen Haslam</a></address>
      <p>The iPhone XR, which launched in September 2018, spent a year as the most popular iPhone, with premium features but a more affordable price tag than its siblings, the now discontinued iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max.</p>
      <p>Now we have three new iPhones - the iPhone 11, 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max - but the iPhone XR has had a price cut and is still available from Apple (with prices starting at £629/$599 if you buy the iPhone XR SIM-free). As a result there are some great iPhone XR deals to be had.</p>
      <p>In this article we bring you the very best iPhone XR deals. There are some great offers available right now. Our experts are continuously scouring the web for the best prices, both SIM-free and on contract.</p>
      <p>If you're looking for Apple's other iPhones, check out our round-up of the best <a href="https://www.macworld.co.uk/how-to/iphone/iphone-11-deals-3702013/">iPhone 11 deals</a>.</p>
      <p>Read our<a href="https://www.macworld.co.uk/review/iphone/iphone-xr-3685946/"> iPhone XR review</a> to find out if you should buy the iPhone XR.</p>
      <h3>iPhone XR price</h3>
      <p>You can choose between 64GB and 128GB of built-in storage, priced as follows, if you <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-xr">buy directly from Apple</a>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>64GB: £629/$599 (Was previously £749/$749)</li>
        <li>128GB: £679/$649 (Was previously £799/$799)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>With the 128GB iPhone XR just costing a few pounds (or dollars) more than the 64GB model we'd suggest that you choose the model with greater capacity.</p>
      <p>Keep these prices in mind when looking at deals because some third-party resellers may quote the price from before Apple's discount was applied.</p>

      <h3>Best iPhone XR Black Friday contract deals</h3>

      <p>You'll find some of the best deals available in our widget below. It's always up-to-date so you won't miss out on the great deals.</p>
      <h3>Best iPhone XR SIM-free deals</h3>
      <p>If you'd prefer to buy the iPhone XR SIM-free, perhaps because you already have a contract you are happy with, there are plenty of places you'll find it available.</p>
      <p>Even Apple is still selling the iPhone XR. You can buy direct from Apple for £629/$599 (64GB) or £679/$649 (128GB) as a SIM-free deal. Apple will sell it to you for even less if you have another iPhone to trade in.</p>
      <p>Most of the iPhone XR's we've seen are also on sale for £629 - which is exactly what Apple is selling it for. We've seen a deal on John Lewis <a href="http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=1203&amp;awinaffid=254429&amp;clickref=41-3685300-11-0000000&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.johnlewis.com%2Fapple-iphone-xr-ios-6-1-4g-lte-sim-free-64gb%2Fp3769101">here</a> for £629, for example. You certainly shouldn't pay more than that for the 64GB model! Surprisingly there are plenty of places selling a 64GB iPhone XR for more than Apple is!</p>
      <p>One of the best deals we've seen recently was from <a href="http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=3090&amp;awinaffid=254429&amp;clickref=41-3685300-11-0000000&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.very.co.uk%2Fapple-iphone-xrnbsp64gb-black%2F1600306242.prd">Very</a>, who were offering a 64GB iPhone XR for £599, but it's now gone up to £629 again.</p>
      <p>Another thing to look out for is if anywhere is selling the 256GB version that Apple used to sell for £899 but is no longer selling. From time to time Amazon has a 256GB iPhone XR available <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Apple-iPhone-XR-64GB-Black/dp/B07JZVDRKT?ascsubtag=41-3685300-11-0000000">here</a> for £779, and Argos is also selling it for £779 <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7928211/type/dlg/sid/41-3685300-11-0000000/https://www.argos.co.uk/list/shop-for-iphone-xr">here</a>, for example.</p>
