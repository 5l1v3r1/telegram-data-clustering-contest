      <p>The owner of Vegan GreenGo has been charged with soliciting the murder of his ex-girlfriend, a judge, and two Sheriff's employees, reports the <a href="https://newspress.com/local/2019/restaurant-owner-charged-with-soliciting-murder-of-ex-girlfriend-judge-sheriffs-officials/">Santa Barbara News-Press</a>.</p>
      <p>Tyler David Beerman, 33 of Santa Barbara, was charged in April with 10 felony counts, including three counts of solicitation of murder, inducing false testimony by threat, and dissuading a witness. His girlfriend, Gissel Castano Diaz, is also charged with one count of solicitation of murder, dissuading a witness and destroying or concealing evidence.</p>

      <p>Beerman and Diaz were charged in December 2018 with stalking Beerman's ex-girlfriend. Beerman was also caught on surveillance cameras at the house of a Sheriff’s Lieutenant involved in the stalking case.</p>
      <p>It's also alleged that while in jail Beerman agreed to pay another inmate $20,000 to kill his ex-girlfriend, specifically by placing explosives in her car so it would explode while she was inside. He also allegedly agreed to pay $40,000 to “hit” a Sheriff's Lieutenant as well as a detective because he thought the detective was in a relationship with his ex-girlfriend, according to the <i>News-Press</i>.</p>
      <p>The inmate was arrested shortly after being released from prison and confessed to law enforcement who planted a recording device that taped conversations with Beerman, corroborating the story. The inmate and an undercover detective then met with Diaz who confirmed the victim's vehicle and agreed to pay $4,000 upfront, reports <i>News-Press</i>.</p>
      <p>Several weeks later a second inmate claimed Beerman wanted to kill Judge Von Deroian who previously presided over Beerman's case.</p>
      <p>Beerman and Diaz will appear for hearing on January 15, 2020. Beerman is currently being held without bail while Diaz is currently out on bail.</p>
      <p>The vegan Mexican restaurant located at 3613 State Street opened in 2018 and has been visited by several celebrities embracing the Vegan lifestyle. It's unknown if the business is still operational.</p>
