      <h1>10 talking points from the Premier League weekend as Man City and Liverpool win again</h1>
      <h2>It was another fascinating round of fixtures in the top flight but it would be no surprise to see a managerial departure over the next few days</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T09:18:47+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 09:18</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Milne</a></address>
      <p>There will be a few Premier League managers looking over their backs at their training grounds this morning as the pressure continues to grow on a number of top-flight bosses.</p>
      <p>Marco Silva's <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/everton-fc">Everton</a> and Manuel Pellegrini's <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> both lost again, while a last-gasp equaliser against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/southampton-fc">Southampton</a> was not enough to stop <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> fans booing off their side and manager Unai Emery.</p>
      <p>There are no such worries for 'The Humble One' Jose Mourinho, who got off to the perfect start to his <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> reign with the 3-2 win over the Hammers, while there was a humdinger on Sunday evening as <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> drew 3-3 with Sheffield United and Manchester City and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> won again.</p>
      <p>Here are 10 talking points from another fascinating Premier League weekend.</p>
      <h3>1) Lift-off for Mourinho</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>The curious thing about this thumping win in Jose Mourinho’s first game in charge was that Spurs didn’t actually play that well.</p>
      <p>Dele Alli did. Son Heung-Min did. But then he normally is a seven or eight out of ten. Harry Kane did his job, scoring yet again.</p>
      <p>But despite his goal Lucas Moura, for example, was light years away from the speedy, scheming forward that ripped Ajax apart in the Champions League.</p>
      <p>He and his confidence will take some time to heal after his time on the fringes this season under Mauricio Pochettino. Serge Aurier clearly had licence to go forward. Ben Davies on the left did not.</p>
      <p>Ring-rusty Eric Dier misplaced a number of passes. Spurs were side feeling their way back to form.</p>
      <p>Their decision-making at times was poor. They were lucky to come up against a poor, poor side. Manuel Pellegrini is a man under pressure...</p>
      <h3>2) Pellegrini under pressure</h3>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>No charm, no charisma and no Plan B when the going gets tough.</p>
      <p>His cv - having done well at Malaga and won the title with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> - is good for West Ham but there is so little else that is.</p>
      <p>Just as with City, he will leave eventually having built no real, lasting relationship with the club or their fans.</p>
      <p>But with an extremely healthy bank balance. The Hammers’ keeper might be bad but Pellegrini’s job is to provide protection for him.</p>
      <p>That he failed here is a big part of the reason why Spurs had it so easy.</p>
      <h3>3) De Bruyne comes back to haunt the Blues</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>The Belgium international missed much of last season with injury and was a hole in Guardiola's midfield, despite them winning the Premier League.</p>
      <p>Kevin De Bruyne has returned this season and is enjoying a consistent run-out in the first team, and it's safe to say both Man City and the Belgian are benefitting.</p>
      <p>The midfielder has more Premier League assists and has been been directly involved in more home goals than any other player in the top flight.</p>
      <p>And, on Saturday, De Bruyne only boosted his stats and his value to City fans with an equalising goal against his former side <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea.</a></p>
      <h3>4) Mateo Kovacic is a free man under Lampard</h3>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>Last season <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> fans could take or leave the Croatia international.</p>
      <p>Mateo Kovacic, then on loan from <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid,</a> was nothing more than a cog in Maurizio Sarri's well-oiled machine - following the Italian's rules to the letter - and fans couldn't work out what his overall purpose was on a football pitch.</p>
      <p>This season, under Lampard, Kovacic has been given the opportunity to express himself; and the Croatian is a man reborn.</p>
      <p>Diminutive with tricky feet, Kovacic would have been earmarked by Guardiola as a man who could cause problems if allowed space to run at Manchester City's defence.</p>
      <p>And so whenever he got the ball at the Etihad, he was quickly closed down.</p>
      <p>The problem is, the midfielder can also pick a pass, and as the City defence took a step forward to apply pressure whenever he received the ball, Kovacic found a way to punish them by floating an inch-perfect pass into the feet of N'Golo Kante to fire home.</p>
      <h3>5) For the Mane not the few</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>You could say that Sadio Mane loves playing against Palace given his excellent record against them (he now has eight goals), but the reality is that the Senegalese loves playing against pretty much everyone right now.</p>
      <p>With Mohamed Salah on the sidelines and Firmino out of scoring form before this game, it was again left to Mane to be the man who made the difference with the opener, albeit with the help of a deflection, Vicente Guaita's hand and both posts.</p>
      <p>But such is life for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> right now.</p>
      <h3>6) Emery losing support</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>A changing of the guard up the Seven Sisters Road has brought a new dynamism to the Premier League sacking season.</p>
      <p>And <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> manager Unai Emery's body language has all the joy of a condemned man prowling the exercise yard the night before he has an appointment with the firing squad.</p>
      <p>After nearly 18 months in charge, the only thing Emery does with conviction is to greet the media “Good ebening” - and he is in danger of matching the gendarme's “Good moaning” in spoof sitcom 'Allo 'Allo.</p>
      <p>Two points from a possible 12, before the Saints came to town, had left fans teetering on the brink of mutiny – or, even worse, apathy.</p>
      <p>Noticeably, there were no chants in support of Emery, no ringing endorsements of his leadership from the posh seats (they are all posh seats at the Emirates).</p>
      <h3>7) Disastrous day for Jones</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20951310.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Premier-League-Sheffield-United-v-Manchester-United.jpg"/>

      </figure>
      <p>Scott McTominay's injury saw Phil Jones come in for his first Premier League start of the season for Manchester United.</p>
      <p>Before the game, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer explained: “Phil has been training well. He’s got experience of playing both central midfield and at the back.</p>
      <p>“When you show the attitude he’s shown in training, it’s time for him to get a chance."</p>
      <p>But he didn't take it, failing to clear the ball in the build up to Sheffield's opener, and the former Blackburn man seemed out of his depth at the back.</p>
      <p>And to compound Jones' misery, he was hauled off at half-time and replaced by Jesse Lingard as Solskjaer opted for a chance of tactics.</p>
      <h3>8) Magical Mousset shines for the Blades</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Lys Mousset endured a miserable maiden spell in the Premier League, failing to deliver the goods for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/afc-bournemouth">Bournemouth</a> during his three-year spell on the south coast.</p>
      <p>He opted for a move to the newly-promoted Blades in the summer and has found his feet, producing a string of fine performances that proves he has the ability to shine at the highest level.</p>
      <p>After playing a crucial role in the opener, Mousset then got on the scoresheet in the second half with a fine strike, firing home into the bottom corner to leave De Gea with no chance.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old Frenchman now has more goals in 10 Premier League appearances for United (4) than he managed in 58 games for Bournemouth (3).</p>
      <h3>9) Silva on the brink</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20952392.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Everton-FC-v-Norwich-City-Premier-League.jpg"/>

      </figure>
      <p>Everton's win against Southampton before the international beak looked like it could have been a turning point for the Toffees.</p>
      <p>It was their Premier League first win on the road since March, and Silva said afterwards that his side were 'turning' towards a possible brighter future.</p>
      <p>But the 2-0 dismal home defeat against bottom side Norwich could prove to be the straw that broke the camel's back, with David Moyes being lined up to come in as a short-term option.</p>
      <p>In reality Silva can have no complaints if he does lose his job. He spent over £100m on seven signings this summer and, frankly, not one of them has proved their worth so far.</p>
      <p>They look clueless, and Silva appears to have run out of ideas of how to turn it around. An announcement of his sacking over the next few days would surprise nobody.</p>
      <h3>10) Could Vardy break his own record?</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>In Leicester's stunning Premier League winning 2015-2016 season Jamie Vardy broke Ruud van Nistelrooy's record of scoring in consecutive games by netting in 11 matches in a row.</p>
      <p>He couldn't do it again... could he?</p>
      <p>Vardy's re-taken penalty in the 2-0 win against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brighton-and-hove-albion-fc">Brighton</a> made it five in a row, adding to strikes against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/burnley-fc">Burnley</a> , Southampton, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> and Arsenal.</p>
      <p>With the form he is in, it is hard to see the 32-year-old failing continuing his streak, especially as the Foxes have a kind-looking fixture list going into the Christmas period.</p>
      <p>It would be one of the stories of the season if Vardy repeated the trick. You just never know...</p>
