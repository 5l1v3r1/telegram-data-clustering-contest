      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/kendall-jenner">Kendall Jenner</a> is the only one in the Kardashian/Jenner brood without any children, but according to her latest <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> post, she's got baby fever.</p>
      <p>She posted photos with her two cute nephews, Kim Kardashian's sons Saint, three, and Psalm, six months, who she shares with husband <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/kanye-west">Kanye West</a> .</p>
      <p>She posed with model and musician Fai Khadra, who she has taken as her date to events including Justin and Hailey Bieber, but maintains they are just friends.</p>
      <p>Fai, 28, has accompanied Kendall to lots of glitzy events, but she has maintained it's a platonic relationship, telling a fan: "He's my date but we don't date".</p>

      <p>Notably, none of the Kardashians have been supporting their step parent Caitlyn Jenner, who was married to Kris until 2015.</p>
      <p>The 70-year-old I Am Cait reality star has been ignored by Kylie and Kendall Jenner since she embarked on her jungle adventure.</p>
      <p>er son Brody has already declared that he is not interested what she gets up to on the ITV show but Kylie and Kendall have decided to turn a blind eye to it at all.</p>
