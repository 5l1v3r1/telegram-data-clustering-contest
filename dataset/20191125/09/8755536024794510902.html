      <p>Winners and nominees for the Grammys are selected by industry professionals, and presented by The Recording Academy – unlike winners of the American Music Awards, which are directly voted for by fans.</p>
      <p>“Most of these awards aren’t really what the seem at all, but that’s ok because I’m up here right now,” she said.</p>
      <p>“I am so thankful for the AMAs because they are the worlds largest fan-voted award show.”</p>
