      <p>Like so many others, and other companies for that matter, Apple is <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/2019/11/25/apple-gift-card-holiday-2019-purchases/">gearing up</a> for the holidays. So of course need a new Apple holiday-themed ad to help us along.</p>
      <p>Production values in Apple ads are typically nothing to scoff at. And while this one might not be as <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/2017/11/23/apple-holiday-2017-ad-swan/">bombastic as others</a>, it’s certainly heartfelt enough. We get to see a busy family stuffing themselves into a packed car, with the kids getting whisked away to their grandparents’ house. “The Surprise” comes in the form of an <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/ipad/">iPad</a> bringing the family together as they remember a lost loved one.</p>
      <blockquote>Sometimes, the best gifts can come from the most unexpected places.</blockquote>
      <p>The ad features the song “<a href="https://music.apple.com/bn/album/married-life/721296492?i=721296524">Married Life</a>” by Michael Giacchino from the motion picture soundtrack for Pixar’s <b><i>Up</i></b>. It’s a fitting song choice, to say the least.</p>
      <p>Here’s the ad:</p>

      <p>It’s another solid ad from Apple, and it shows how a piece of technology can bring us all together in the right moment.</p>
