      <p>Julian Assange is so unwell he could die behind bars if he does not receive ‘urgent’ medical care, say doctors who have signed an open letter to the home secretary.</p>
      <p>The WikiLeaks founder is being held at the top-security Belmarsh prison, in south-east London, while awaiting a hearing to fight US extradition in February.</p>
      <p>More than 60 doctors from across the world have insisted ‘there is no time to lose’ in the letter penned to Priti Patel, following the serious deterioration of Assange’s mental and physical health.</p>
      <p>They have expressed ‘serious concerns’ over the 48-year-old’s fitness to stand trial early next year, where he faces 18 US charges including conspiring to hack into a Pentagon computer.</p>
      <p>Assange is accused of working with former US army intelligence analyst, Chelsea Manning, to leak hundreds of thousands of classified documents.</p>
      <p>Doctors are now calling for Assange to be transferred to a university teaching hospital, where he can be assessed and treated by an expert medical team.</p>

      <p>Their basis of their health assessment included ‘harrowing eyewitness accounts’ of his appearance at Westminster Magistrates’ Court on October 21, where he struggled to confirm his own name, saying: ‘I can’t think properly.’</p>

      <p>The 16-page letter reads: ‘From a medical point of view, on the evidence currently available, we have serious concerns about Mr Assange’s fitness to stand trial in February 2020.</p>
      <p>‘Most importantly, it is our opinion that Mr Assange requires urgent expert medical assessment of both his physical and psychological state of health.</p>
      <p>‘Any medical treatment indicated should be administered in a properly equipped and expertly staffed university teaching hospital (tertiary care).</p>
      <p>‘Were such urgent assessment and treatment not to take place, we have real concerns, on the evidence currently available, that Mr Assange could die in prison.</p>
      <p>‘The medical situation is thereby urgent. There is no time to lose.’</p>

      <p>The letter, which has also been copied to shadow home secretary Diane Abbott, was written by doctors from the UK, the US, Sri Lanka, Australia, Sweden, Italy, Germany and Poland.</p>
      <p>Assange has been in custody since he was dramatically removed from the Ecuadorian embassy in London this year, avoiding extradition to Sweden over rape allegations.</p>
      <p>His seven-year stay came to an end over his alleged poor behaviour and hygiene in the embassy in April, when he was jailed for 50 weeks the following month for breaching his bail conditions for seeking diplomatic asylum.</p>
      <p>Last week WikiLeaks welcomed the decision by the Swedish authorities to drop the long-running rape investigation into Assange – something he has always denied.</p>
      <p>Dr Lissa Johnson, a clinical psychologist in Australia and one of the letter’s signatories, said: ‘Given the rapid decline of his health in Belmarsh prison, Julian Assange must immediately be transferred to a university teaching hospital for appropriate and specialised medical care.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘If the UK Government fails to heed doctors’ advice by urgently arranging such a transfer on medical grounds, there is a very real possibility that Mr Assange may die.</p>
      <p>‘As it stands, serious questions surround not only the health impacts of Mr Assange’s detention conditions, but his medical fitness to stand trial and prepare his defence.</p>
      <p>‘Independent specialist medical assessment is therefore needed to determine whether Julian Assange is medically fit for any of his pending legal proceedings.</p>
      <p>‘Consistent with its commitment to human rights and rule of law, the UK Government must heed the urgent warning of medical professionals from around the world, and transfer Julian Assange to an appropriately specialised and expert hospital setting, before it’s too late.’</p>
