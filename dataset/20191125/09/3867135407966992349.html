      <p>It is truly wonderful when both houses of our Congress can join forces with support for the Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (“People spoke, Congress listened, funded global AIDS program,” The Herald, Nov. 5)</p>
      <p>While Congress recently appropriated more money for the Global Fund than the Trump administration requested, U.S. financial support for global health remains far less than 1 percent of our federal budget. Still, the Global Fund has had a big hand in the fact that now the world has about half as many AIDS-related deaths since the peek in 2005.</p>
      <p>Not-so-fun facts: About 1.1 million people in the U.S. are living with HIV (the virus that causes AIDS). About 15 percent of them (1 in 7) are unaware that they are infected (and can unknowingly infect others). And an estimated 38,700 Americans became newly infected with HIV in 2016.(hiv.gov/hiv-basics)</p>
      <p>So yes, let’s celebrate this good news and thank our political leaders.</p>
