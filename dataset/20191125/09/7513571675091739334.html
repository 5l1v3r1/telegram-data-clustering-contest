        <b>The Open Society Foundation (OSF) has announced a $15 million initiative to support the repatriation of artifacts looted from Africa.</b>
      </p>
      <p>In a statement on Monday, the organisation said the initiative will support networks and organisations for the next four years to return the cultural objects to their countries.</p>
      <p>According to the organisation, Africans have advocated for decades for the return of their heritage such as art and ceremonial objects, human remains, natural history specimens, archives and intangible cultural heritage like sound recordings and photographs.</p>
      <p>It said the artifacts were looted during military raids by colonialists across Africa.</p>
      <p>Patrick Gaspard, president of OSF, said the initiative is also a way of reconciling the historical wrongs meted out to the continent.</p>
      <p>“The legacy of colonial violence has deep implications for the ways that racism and imbalances of power are perpetuated today. This isn’t just about returning pieces of art, but about restoring the very essence of these cultures,” Gaspard said.</p>
      <p>“We are proud to support this movement towards reconciling historical wrongs, as part of our mission to advance true justice.”</p>
      <p>Rashida Bumbray, OSF’s director of culture and art, added that returning the objects will allow the people have access to their heritage and maintain connection with the future.</p>
      <p>“With so much of Africa’s precolonial cultural legacy housed in European museums, these artifacts are out of reach for millions on the African continent, who have a right to their own knowledge and cultural production,” Bumbray said.</p>
      <p>“Restitution is not only about rightsizing the past, but about access to one’s own heritage and a necessity to maintain this connection for future generations.”</p>
