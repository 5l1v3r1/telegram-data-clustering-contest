      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T09:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 09:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.autoblog.com/bloggers/reuters/" target="_blank">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>BEIJING/FRANKFURT â€” Daimler's main Chinese joint venture partner BAIC Group has signaled its intention to increase its stake in the German <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/car-finder/luxury/">luxury car</a> manufacturer, sources briefed on the matter said, after it built up a 5% Daimler stake in July.</p>
      <p>Officials at BAIC's listed company BAIC Motor Corp Ltd said at investor conferences in mid-October that "both sides are willing to increase stakes in the other," responding to questions about future relationship between BAIC Group and Daimler, the sources said.</p>
      <p>This increased interest in Daimler comes as the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2019/11/11/daimler-job-cuts-wage-freeze-cost-savings/">German automaker faces significant cost-cutting</a> and seeks to freeze worker pay.</p>
      <p>Daimler said in a regulatory filing on Friday that HSBC held 5.23% in Daimler's voting rights directly as well as through instruments such as equity swaps as of Nov 15. BAIC has used HSBC to help it build its initial 5% stake.</p>
      <p>Sources declined to be named as they are not allowed to speak to media.</p>
      <p>A Daimler spokesman on Monday said, that they had received notification from HSBC that the voting stake of 5% has been exceeded. "There is nothing to add to this," Daimler said when asked whether this was related to stake buying by BAIC.</p>
      <p>BAIC was not immediately available for comment.</p>
      <p>Geely, Daimler's biggest shareholder with a 9.7% stake, said: "We are a long-term investor in Daimler. We do not react spontaneously to any volatility and we support Daimler's management and their strategy."</p>
      <p>BAIC (Beijing Automobile Group Co Ltd) has been Daimler's main partner in China for years and operates <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/mercedes_benz/">Mercedes-Benz</a> factories in Beijing through Beijing Benz Automotive.</p>
      <p>Two months before its July stake deal was announced, sources told Reuters that BAIC wanted to invest in Daimler to secure its investment in Beijing Benz Automotive.</p>
      <p>In March, sources told Reuters Daimler had asked Goldman Sachs to help it explore increasing its stake in BAIC's Hong Kong-listed company.</p>
      <p>The partners also planned to revamp manufacturing facilities to make <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/mercedes_benz/">Mercedes</a> Benz-branded trucks via their <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/category/commercial-trucks/">commercial vehicle</a> joint venture Foton Daimler Automotive (BFDA), Reuters reported in August citing a document and sources familiar with matter.</p>
      <p>The companies also said Daimler and BAIC's new energy vehicle unit BluePark have jointly developed a battery research lab in Beijing.</p>
      <p>State-owned BAIC built its stake after Li Shufu, chairman of rival private automaker Zhejiang Geely Holding Group, built a 9.69% stake in Stuttgart-based Daimler in early 2018.</p>
      <p>By using Hong Kong shell companies, derivatives, bank financing and structured share options, Li kept the plan under wraps until he was able, at a stroke, to become Daimler's single largest shareholder.</p>
      <p>Since the investment, Geely and Daimler have said they plan to build the next generation of Smart <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/electric/">electric cars</a> in China through a joint venture.</p>
      <p>Zhejiang-based Geely owns <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/volvo/">Volvo</a> while BAIC in addition to Daimler has a partnership with South Korea's <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/hyundai/">Hyundai</a> Motor.</p>
