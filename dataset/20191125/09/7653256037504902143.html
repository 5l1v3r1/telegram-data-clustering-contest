      <p>NEW DELHI: Governments that fail to provide clean air and water to their citizens must compensate them for the adverse impact of pollution, the Supreme Court said on Monday while issuing notices to all state governments and UTs to explain why citizens should not have such a remedy.</p>
      <p>The order came on a petition that highlighted the high <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/air-pollution">air pollution</a> levels in the Delhi-NCR region.</p>
      <p>“We have become a laughing stock. The government cannot provide clean air and water to the citizens in its capital city. What is the point of all this development? What is the point of being a world power?”</p>
      <p>“Delhi has become ‘narak’ (hell). People are living in a gas chamber and are dying due to cancer and other lung ailments. Their life spans are getting shorter,” Justice Arun Mishra, who was sitting alongside Justice Deepak Gupta, said.</p>
      <p>The bench also took upon itself to deal with the alarming water pollution levels in the city.</p>
      <p>“Should they die or suffer?” Justice Mishra asked. He said governments in a welfare state were constitutionally bound to provide clean air and water to all their citizens. They cannot “politicise” the issue or indulge in a blame game. “Should we keep quiet if things keep happening under our noses?”</p>
      <p>He said the time has come for all governments to act together to grapple with the menace or face constitutional tort action from citizens. The bench said they would begin by making the governments around Delhi-NCR accountable for air pollution in the NCR from <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/stubble-burning">stubble burning</a>. “Punjab, <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Haryana">Haryana</a>, Delhi and UP must give compensation to Delhiites for the air pollution,” he said.</p>
      <p>The court had summoned chief secretaries of the four states to personally explain what they were doing to check stubble burning. Not satisfied with their replies, the bench asked all of them to sit together and draw up immediate and long-term plans to deal with air and water pollution, and the pollution caused by the garbage that has piled up in our cities.</p>
      <p>The court also asked the Delhi and the central government to jointly work on alternate schemes to rein in air pollution levels. That includes installation of smog towers. The governments will have to respond in 10 days. The court said it may expand the scope of the petitions to include river pollution and the pollution caused by industrial effluents released into air and water.</p>
      <p>Past efforts in these directions have failed due to lack of political will and bureaucratic apathy. Though crores of rupees have been spent to clean the Ganga and Yamuna, nothing has come of it despite courts monitoring these. A tort action against the state would allow citizens to move courts in case of specific pollution-related illnesses for compensation.</p>
