      <p>Environment Canada warns that a Pacific Frontal System will bring periods of snowfall to a major B.C. highway throughout the day and into the night.</p>
      <p>The forecast notes that 9 cm of snowfall has already fallen on Highway 1 – Alison Pass as of 8 a.m. on Nov. 25. However, periods of heavy snowfall are expected to continue today, as a northerly flow brings several bands of moisture over the area. Between these bands of moisture, the heavy snow is expected to taper off.</p>
      <p>Periods of heavy snowfall are expected to continue through the day with total amounts of 15 to 25 cm.</p>
      <p>Weather in the mountains can change suddenly resulting in hazardous driving conditions. For instance, as the snow increases, visibility may become severely reduced. As a result, you should be prepared to adjust your driving with changing road conditions during this time.</p>
      <p>Public Safety Canada encourages everyone to make an emergency plan and get an emergency kit with drinking water, food, medicine, a first-aid kit and a flashlight.</p>
