      <h1>Strictly's Kelvin Fletcher has viewers in tears telling romantic story about how he met his wife</h1>
      <h2>The former Emmerdale star was in tears and so were viewers as he talked about Eliza</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T09:59:20+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 09:59</time> by <a rel="author">Katie Fitzpatrick, Jasper King</a></address>
      <p>Strictly Come Dancing fans were left in tears after Kelvin Fletcher told viewers the story about how he met his wife Eliza, reports the <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/showbiz-news/strictlys-kelvin-fletcher-viewers-crying-17307086">Manchester Evening News</a>.</p>
      <p>Kelvin explained how the pair met and welled up as he paid tribute to his wife Eliza, who is also the mother of his two children Milo and Marnie.</p>
      <p>Kelvin played Andy Sudgen in Emmerdale and met Eliza at school and she was the first girl he ever kissed.</p>
      <p>However, the pair lost contact when she went to university because Kelvin was working on Emmerdale. But their future together appears to have been mapped out.</p>
      <p>The Oldham actor was in a bar in Manchester when by remarkable chance he found Eliza again.</p>

      <p>"I'm in a random bar in Manchester and who of all people appears in the crowd dancing towards me?" he said.</p>
      <p>Kelvin married Eliza in 2015, and they welcomed daughter Marnie in August 2016 and son Milo last December.</p>
      <p>During the weekend's Strictly performance, he performed to their first dance song Do I Love You (Indeed I Do) by Frank Wilson with his dance partner Oti Mabuse.</p>
      <p>"It will mean so much," he said ahead of their performance.</p>

      <p>"I just want Liz to know how lucky I feel. Thank you for giving me two amazing incredible children."</p>
      <p>And Eliza said about her husband: "He's everything, everything."</p>
      <p>Viewers watching at home took to Twitter to say the introduction had melted their hearts.</p>
