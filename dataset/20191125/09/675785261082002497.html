      <h1>Paul Pogba attempting to 'force through January transfer to Real Madrid'</h1>
      <h2>The Man Utd midfielder could be set to move to the Spanish capital after missing out on switch during the summer window</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T09:57:51+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 09:57</time> by <a rel="author">Ned Keating</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/paul-pogba">Paul Pogba</a> is said to be intensifying his efforts to force through a January move from <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Man Utd</a> to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> , according to reports in Spain.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fifa-world-cup">World Cup</a> winner was linked with a move to the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/la-liga">La Liga</a> giants throughout the summer, but ultimately remained with the Red Devils in the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/premier-league">Premier League</a> .</p>
      <p>Since then, the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/france-football-team">France</a> international has struggled with an ankle injury that has sidelined him since a 1-1 draw at home to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> at the end of September.</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/juventus-fc">Juventus</a> man has recently spent time in Miami in an effort to return to full fitness as quickly as possible, hanging out with rapper <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/pharrell-williams">Pharrell Williams</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/nba">NBA</a> star Jimmy Butler in between gym sessions.</p>

      <p>But it seems the trip may also have been to get Pogba fit for a move to Madrid in the winter transfer window if reports in Spain are to be believed.</p>
      <p>Speaking on radio show <a href="https://www.cope.es/deportes/futbol/amp/noticias/vestuario-del-united-afirman-que-pogba-juega-para-poder-irse-madrid-invierno-20191124_558749?__twitter_impression=true">Tiempo de Juego</a> , journalist Paco Gonzalez claimed that the 26-year-old has already fully recovered from his ankle injury, but has asked not to play.</p>
      <p>Sources close to Utd reportedly confirmed Gonzalez' claims, while also detailing that boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer would be open to allowing Pogba to leave in January, having kept hold of the midfielder in the summer.</p>
      <p>It is thought any deal taking the Frenchman to the Spanish capital would set Real back around Â£130m.</p>
      <p>Claims of Pogba's wantaway behaviour will have come as a blow to Utd, who have missed the 26-year-old's undoubted talent in recent weeks.</p>

      <p>The former Juve man's absence led to a recall for the much-maligned Fred, with the Brazilian having failed to set the world alight since moving to Old Trafford from Shakhtar Donetsk last summer.</p>
      <p>And if the reports from Spain prove true, it could well be the case that Pogba may have played his last game for Solskjaer at Utd.</p>
