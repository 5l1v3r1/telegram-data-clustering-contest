      <p>Delighted St Mirren manager <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/jim-goodwin">Jim Goodwin</a> paid tribute to his super subs after they helped carve out a telling winner.</p>
      <p>With the Buddies struggling to break down a stubborn <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/ross-county-fc">Ross County</a> defence, the gaffer threw on attacking talents Tony Andreu and Kyle McAllister.</p>
      <p>And they helped set up Sam Foley's superb strike that sealed an important win for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/st-mirren-fc">St Mirren</a> .</p>
      <p>Goodwin said: "You make substitutes and you want them to come on and make an impact.</p>
      <p>"What a fantastic goal to win it. Tony Andreu plays a big part in it, does really well. Kyle McAllister puts a good ball around the corner as well.</p>
      <p>"The two boys were involved and obviously Sam Foley gets the plaudits because it's a hell of a strike."</p>
      <p>While Goodwin wishes his team hadn't left it to the last minute to make their dominance pay, he was pleased with the character his side showed to stick at it to the death.</p>
      <p>He added: "I'm always happy when we win. I was a little bit frustrated to be honest because I felt we could have made it a lot more comfortable than what it was.</p>
      <p>"I'm really pleased for the players. It was fantastic character that they showed to go behind and come back and win it like that.</p>
      <p>"It was a great result and a really important result. A draw wouldn't have been enough today, there's no doubt about that.</p>
      <p>"It was great scenes at the end and great to see the the fans at the end happy and enjoying that moment.</p>
      <p>"We were maybe five minutes from being booed off the park so thankfully we managed to get a nice ovation at the end instead."</p>
