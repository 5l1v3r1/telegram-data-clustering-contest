      <p>The State Security Agency (SSA) is back in the spotlight at the state capture inquiry on Monday.</p>
      <p>The commission is tasked with investigating allegations of state capture, corruption and fraud in the public sector, including organs of state.</p>
      <p>The commission has called former senior SSA officials Mo Shaik and Gibson Njenje to testify on Monday.</p>
      <p>The former head of the South African Secret Service Shaik took up the position in 2009 when former President Jacob Zuma appointed Minister Siyabonga Cwele to the portfolio.</p>
      <p>But in 2011, Shaik and head of the national intelligence agency Njenje were ousted from the agency.</p>
      <p>It is believed the pair had planned to investigate the influence of the Gupta family on the state.</p>
      <p>The pair will now tell their side of the story at the commission.</p>
