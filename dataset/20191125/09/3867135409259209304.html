      <p>Criticism of the Israeli government is not anti-Semitism. Trump would have us believe otherwise. He is now saying that Israeli settlements in the occupied territories are legal. In doing so our government is being complicit to a noxious land grab consistent with the U.S. government’s recognition of Jerusalem as the Israeli capital.</p>
      <p>I recently read an article reported by BBC News about a U.S. citizen, James Strauss, being denied citizenship by Germany. That country is saying that his father left Germany voluntarily and thus his son does not qualify. I won’t get into the specifics of his situation. Suffice it to say here that Mr. Strauss is Jewish and his father left Nazi Germany in fear for his life.</p>
      <p>It is ironic to see the Israeli government doing the same thing to the Palestinians as the German government is now doing to Mr. Strauss. And Trump is helping the Israeli government do this. I believe that I am correct in saying that Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu has never enjoyed leading a majority in his parliament. A large number of Jewish Israelis object to his treatment of Israelis of Arab descent and of Palestinians in the occupied territory. By siding with Netanyahu, Trump is abandoning America’s place as arbitrator and facilitator for peace and justice as determined by Israelis and Palestinians. Thanks to him the U.S. government is losing its reputation for honesty and objectivity.</p>
