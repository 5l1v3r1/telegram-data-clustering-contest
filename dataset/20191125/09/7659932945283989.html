      <p>An Egyptian official, described as a “high-level and close to Egyptian intelligence,” blamed the Islamic Jihad and the Israeli government for obstructing advanced efforts to reach a truce agreement represented by a prisoner swap between Hamas and Israel.<br/><br/>He said that the latest round of escalation in the Gaza Strip postponed the completion of this deal.<br/><br/>He told Israeli authorities that the prisoner exchange deal was on its way to a breakthrough had it not been for the latest escalation by Israel against the Gaza Strip, which began with the assassination of Jihad field commander Bahaa Abul Atta.<br/><br/>On Sunday, right-wing Israel Hayom newspaper quoted an Egyptian official as saying that the swap deal was a result of a series of understandings and agreements on the establishment of calm in Gaza in return for a comprehensive plan for the coastal enclave.<br/><br/>He added that the United Nations has also exerted its influence to promote understandings between Israel and Hamas. The UN saw it as a practical opportunity to significantly improve the difficult humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip.<br/><br/>According to the official, the UN envoy, Nickolay Mladenov, rushed to Cairo a few hours after the assassination of Abul Atta and participated in extensive efforts to reach a ceasefire, fearing that the achievements made in the recent rounds of negotiations between Israel and Hamas would collapse.<br/><br/>The newspaper said that “senior Palestinian sources in Gaza confirmed the authenticity of the details provided by the senior Egyptian official.”<br/><br/>But Hamas officials denied any progress in a prisoner swap deal with Israel. A source told Asharq Al-Awsat that Israeli claims about an agreement on a deal were baseless. The source added there was “a price that Israel has to pay before starting any talks.”</p>
