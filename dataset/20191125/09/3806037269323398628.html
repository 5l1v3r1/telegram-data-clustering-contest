      <p><a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/size">size?</a> has continued its ongoing archive partnership with <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/adidas-originals">adidas Originals</a> with the exclusive release of the BC Trainer in its original 1970s colorway. The sneaker was originally launched to mark the Baltic Cup handball tournament, which saw the sport rise in popularity across Europe, and is set to return in an almost identical design.</p>
      <p>Constructed from blue suede, the sneaker’s upper is complemented with bold yellow leather on the 3-Stripe branding and heel counter, before being finished with golden embossed branding on the lateral side. This upper all sits a top a classic gum rubber outsole. The BC Trainer is similar to other handball-themed sneakers from adidas, although it is a rare design in that it features no T-shaped toe overlay.</p>
      <p>Take a look at the adidas Originals BC Trainer in the gallery above, and expect it to arrive at <a href="https://www.size.co.uk/mens/footwear/brand/adidas-originals/">size? stores</a> on November 29.</p>
