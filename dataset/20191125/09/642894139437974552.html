      <h1>Tesla fans line up for new Cybertruck</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T09:48:41+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 09:48</time> by <a rel="author">Sibahle Malinga</a></address>
      <p>Electric car company Tesla has received 200 000 pre-orders for its electric Cybertruck, which was unveiled last week.</p>
      <p>The pickup truck, launched at an event in Los Angeles, California, has a starting price of $39 900, with a prospective owner required to pay a refundable $100 “pre-order fee”.</p>
      <p>According to Tesla, the “futuristic” truck can out-pace a Ford F-150 and outperform a Porsche 911.</p>
      <p>While the Cybertruck won’t officially be available until late 2021, pre-orders have been flooding in via the <a href="https://www.tesla.com/cybertruck">Tesla Web site</a>, according to Tesla and SpaceX founder Elon Musk, who took to <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1198788116372344832?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnbc.com%2F2019%2F11%2F23%2Felon-musk-says-tesla-has-received-146000-orders-for-its-cybertruck.html">Twitter</a> a few hours ago to announce the latest pre-order tally.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, Musk tweeted: “146k Cybertruck orders so far, with 42% choosing dual, 41% tri &amp; 17% single motor.”</p>
      <p>On Sunday, he wrote Tesla had received “187 000 orders” for the Cybertruck.</p>

      <p>The launch of the vehicle kicked off with a rocky start last week, after Tesla’s chief of design, Franz von Holzhausen, hit the door of the truck with a sledgehammer to demonstrate its bullet-proof capabilities, unexpectedly resulting in shattered windows.</p>
      <p>The “cyberpunk” styled truck promises mind-blowing performance, with the ability to tow items weighing more than six tons, and carrying a payload of nearly 1.6 tons, a greater load capacity than the average diesel truck, while costing significantly less to maintain, according to Tesla.</p>

      <p>Musk says with an unpainted wedge-shaped, steel exoskeleton, its design draws influences from two movies, James Bond's "The Spy Who Loved Me" and "<a href="https://www.space.com/38389-blade-runner-2049-review-eerie-awesomeness.html">Blade Runner 2049</a>" (2017).</p>
      <p>“Blade Runner” art director Syd Mead has praised the vehicle, saying it is <a href="https://www.businessinsider.sg/blade-runners-syd-mead-says-cybertruck-exceeds-expectations-2019-11/">“stylistically breath-taking”</a> and has “completely changed the vocabulary of personal truck market design”.</p>
      <p>The Cybertruck has the ability to go off-road, has enough space for six adults, and features a futuristic steering wheel and 17-inch touch-screen.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.tesla.com/cybertruck">Tesla</a>, a single motor rear-wheel drive will cost $39 900, a dual motor all-wheel drive is priced at $49 900, and the tri motor all-wheel drive will go for $69 900, although there may be additional costs depending on the features selected by the purchaser.</p>
