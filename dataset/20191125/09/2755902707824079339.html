      <p>Excessive love of beer landed two Victoria Falls behind bars after they violently ganged up on a  security guard for closing a bar while they were still drinking.</p>
      <p>Kasanga Ndlovu (32) and Clive Ndlovu (22)beat up Mr Daniso Ncube (32) at Chinotimba bar.</p>
      <p>This follows after Mr Ncube ordered them out as it was time to close the bar but <a href="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/imbibers-beat-up-guard-for-closing-bar/">the furious duo bashed him with fists and broken empty beer bottles.</a></p>
      <p>Kasanga will serve  an effective seven months in jail after the magistrate invoked another suspended month from a previous case where he bashed his wife,</p>
      <p>The magistrate sentenced Clive to six months in prison before suspending two months on condition of good behaviour.</p>
