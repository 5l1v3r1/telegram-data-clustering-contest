      <p>Nollywood actress Juliet Ibrahim seemed to have experienced more hardship before she reached adulthood than many do their whole lives.</p>
      <p>The 33-year-old lived through three civil wars, was molested as a child and encountered frequent rejection in the film industry because of how she spoke, she said.</p>
      <p>“My life has been one hell of a rollercoaster ride,” Ibrahim penned in the introduction to her new <a href="http://atoasttolifebook.com/">autobiography</a>, “A Toast To Life.”</p>

      <p>Still, amid all the destruction she witnessed, she dreamed of being a star.</p>
      <p>“I just saw myself on stage,” she said.</p>
      <p>Now an award-winning actress, film producer and singer, Ibrahim went on to be featured in more than 100 productions, according to her book.</p>
      <p>She also founded her own eyelash line, launched a music video production company and started the nonprofit Juliet Ibrahim Foundation to eradicate several diseases in Ghana and other African countries. </p>
      <p>Ibrahim was born in Ghana to a Lebanese father and a Liberian mother, and the starlet was raised in Liberia, the Ivory Coast, Ghana and Lebanon, with most of the moves representing different conflicts she and her family had to flee.</p>
      <p>The first forced her out of her home when she was only 6 years old, Ibrahim said. Another sent her fleeing rebels and jet bombers along an Ivory Coast border.</p>
      <p>Ibrahim said people don’t truly understand what it means to be a refugee.</p>
      <p>“We don’t understand how they feel,” she said. “People are dying in front of you.”</p>
      <p>Ibrahim said fireworks still scare her.</p>
      <p>“I’m thinking, ‘Oh God, what’s happening,'” she said.</p>
      <p>The actress decided she needed to share her story.</p>
      <p>“I just feel like a lot of people can relate to these stories,” she said.</p>
      <p>After falling short of a fundraising goal to pay for a movie chronicling her life, the actress decided to write a book instead.</p>
      <p>“It took me two years to actually put the book together,” she said.</p>

      <p>When she did, she revealed more than she was even prepared to share with her closest relatives.</p>
      <p>Ibrahim wrote in her book that she was about 8 years old when her mother sent her to her favorite uncle’s room to retrieve something and he molested her.</p>
      <p>He told Ibrahim to close the door, unzipped his trousers and forced her to touch his genitals, the author said.</p>
      <p>She added that her mom only found out about the encounter after reading the book.</p>
      <p>“I couldn’t bring myself to tell her,” she said.</p>
      <p>She also changed her uncle’s name in print.</p>
      <p>“She had so much love for him. I just didn’t know how to break her heart,” Ibrahim said of her mother.</p>
      <p>The author admitted part of what took so long writing her book was gaining the courage to reveal her story.</p>
      <p>“It’s not easy to be vulnerable to the world and let everybody into your space,” she said.</p>

      <p>So instead of writing about her life in a negative light, she chose to pen her story as a celebration of her journey and the strength she gained.</p>
      <p>“I can survive in any situation,” Ibrahim said.</p>
      <p>Her road to acting wasn’t smooth and perfectly paved either. After getting lucky initially, a dry period followed in Ghana, Ibrahim said.</p>
      <p>Producers told her her accent was not a typical Ghanaian accent. She admitted it wasn’t. It was a mix of dialects from all the regions she had lived in, but the rejection hurt.</p>
      <p>“I was really down,” she said. “I was depressed.”</p>
      <p>Ibrahim didn’t catch another break until she met with a Nigerian director in Ghana who told her he had one scene in a movie for her.</p>
      <p>“I just took a leap of faith,” Ibrahim said.</p>
      <p>She did the scene, and someone who saw her made a phone call to a director on her behalf.</p>
      <p>It led to a lead role in Lagos, Ibrahim said.</p>
      <p>“They didn’t care about accent,” she said.</p>
      <p>The Nigerian film industry is so diverse actresses didn’t need to sound the same, Ibrahim said.</p>
      <p>“And I became so popular in Nigeria that the Ghanaians started requesting me for acting,” she said.</p>
      <p>The takeaway for Ibrahim was to keep going.</p>
      <p>“Every story, whether of triumph or failure, is one I celebrate because I am alive,” she penned.</p>
