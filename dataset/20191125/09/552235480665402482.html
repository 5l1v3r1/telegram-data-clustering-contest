      <h1>7 questions for the Rangers AGM as Dave King prepares to meet the shareholders</h1>
      <h2>It's been a positive year for the Govan outfit on the pitch but the board will still face scrutiny over a number of key issues.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T09:30:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 09:30</time> by <a rel="author">Gary Ralston, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/gary-ralston/</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> AGM takes place at the Clyde Auditorium in Glasgow tomorrow and is expected to pass positively.</p>
      <p>Steven Gerrard has his team riding high in the league, the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/betfred-league-cup">Betfred Cup</a> final is looming and the last 32 of the Europa League is within touching distance.</p>
      <p>However, some important and intriguing questions are still likely to be asked of Dave King and the Ibrox board by the shareholders in attendance.</p>
      <p>Here, <b>Gary Ralston</b> runs the rule over the topics that are set to dominate when King and his directors take centre stage at the Armadillo.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Mike Ashley and commercial activity</b>
      </p>

      <p>Rangers have made one of its shrewdest and most impressive appointments with the addition of commercial and marketing director James Bisgrove.</p>
      <p>However, the full commercial worth of the club will continue to be under exploited until the dispute with Ashley and Sports Direct is resolved.</p>
      <p>Rangers have already spent more than £2 million in legal fees in its ongoing courtroom battle with Newcastle United owner Ashley.</p>
      <p>Fans will be keen to know if there is light at the end of the tunnel, although the complex nature of the case has made it difficult for Rangers to comment in the past.</p>
      <p>Bisgrove, a former UEFA executive, has formed some impressive alliances already and recently headed to the States with managing director <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/stewart-robertson">Stewart Robertson</a> to extend the reach of the club.</p>
      <p>He will be keen to bring more blue chip partners to the fold in the next 12 months and supporters are likely to question the board on the commercial future.</p>
      <p>
        <b>HMRC</b>
      </p>

      <p>Rangers reacted with caution to recent reports that an HMRC “blunder” effectively forced the sale of the club by Sir David Murray to Craig Whyte in 2011.</p>
      <p>HMRC said around £70m was owed for the club’s use of EBTs from 2001 to 2010 as part of an overall tax claim of more than £90m.</p>
      <p>However, that figure was cut by £26 million, with claims the EBT part of the debt could yet fall to as low as £20m.</p>
      <p>No evidence has yet emerged to suggest Rangers would only have faced an EBT liability of £20 million, with HMRC taking the rare step of publicly dismissing the reports published by The Times.</p>
      <p>Dave King, who invested £20 million in Oldco, has yet to comment. Does he have any evidence to suggest the liability will eventually drop to £20 million and does he believe the HMRC “blunder” theory?</p>
      <p>Rangers said a fortnight ago they would study the report in finer detail before making comment. King may break his silence and give shareholders his point of view if asked from the floor.</p>

        <b>Fresh Investment</b>

      <p>Rumours are rife that <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/dave-king">Dave King</a> may step down as chairman, but if that’s the case he has yet to tell anyone on the Ibrox board.</p>
      <p>King has always maintained he would not be at Ibrox for the long term, but stepping down in the middle of the season when the club is finally mounting a title challenge would surely be too de-stabilising.</p>
      <p>King has done everything he promised for Rangers financially and has incurred significant losses for the last five years in a bid to play catch up with Celtic.</p>
      <p>However, the days of ad hoc spending are nearing an end - Rangers have over invested in players and facilities since 2015 and the time is fast approaching for a sustainable business model to be put in place.</p>
      <p>King has underwritten losses until the end of the season and, by then, a new shares issue - which has long been mooted - is likely to put the club on a firmer financial footing.</p>
      <p>It won’t be a fund for widows and orphans. Rather, King and his board are likely to use their powers as directors to nominate new investors.</p>
      <p>Rangers have strong links to Hong Kong and the Far East, in particular, via directors such as Julian Wolhardt, Barry Scott and George Taylor.</p>
      <p>It’s not unreasonable to suggest they will look to that part of the world again where many business figures, including several ex-pat Scots, have watched developments at Ibrox with interest.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Alfredo Morelos and transfer policy</b>
      </p>

      <p>Only around seven per cent of the Rangers annual turnover comes from player sales, a quarter of the total it should be for a club of its size.</p>
      <p>Expect the Rangers board to reiterate <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/alfredo-morelos">Morelos</a> will be going nowhere in January - and neither will any player Steven Gerrard reckons is vital to their championship ambitions.</p>
      <p>However, there is an acknowledgement that significant offers for their players in the summer will be looked at seriously.</p>
      <p>It’s believed Mark Allen’s failure to bring buyers to the table undermined his authority and ultimately led to his departure from the club as director of football.</p>
      <p>Celtic turned a potential £15 million loss last season into an £11 million profit on the back of player and manager sales that raked in more than £26 million.</p>
      <p>That’s the model Rangers must follow - questions will likely be asked about the importance of the role of Ross Wilson as director of football and the impact he’ll be expected to make in the months ahead.</p>
      <p>Don’t be surprised to hear a frank admission from King that the failure of previous managerial teams, Mark Warburton and Pedro Caixinha, has been financially disastrous.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Ibrox expansion</b>
      </p>

      <p><b><i>Record Sport</i></b> revealed earlier this year Rangers were considering expanding Ibrox to an arena with a capacity of around 55,000.</p>
      <p>A feasibility study has been undertaken these last few months and the board could be quizzed about the viability of modernisation.</p>
      <p>Will it be undertaken in time for the club’s 150th anniversary in 2022, or will the costs prove too prohibitive in comparison to the likely return?</p>
      <p>Expect updates on the club’s plans for 2022, including the development of Edmiston House and the Ibrox Community Complex, which will shortly come under the control of the Rangers Charity Foundation.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Disabled Facilities</b>
      </p>
      <p>Quite frankly, they’re appalling. Former chief executive Martin Bain promised to improve facilities more than a decade ago at a previous AGM and did nothing.</p>
      <p>It is unacceptable in the 21st century for fans with additional needs to be exposed to the elements in the west enclosure, with poor sight lines and inadequate pre and post match facilities.</p>
      <p>Rangers have made many improvements to the Ibrox matchday experience these last two years, but their ongoing disregard for disabled fans reflects poorly on them.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Catering</b>
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article1369967.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/pies%201.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Yes, the old ‘pies are too cauld’ questions will surely arise, but increasingly fans are looking for more from their matchday experience.</p>
      <p>Rangers could be quizzed about the availability of an app to order half-time food and the possibility of paying by phone or contactless card.</p>
      <p>It’s expensive to introduce the technology, especially with Ibrox only in use for up to 30 times a year, but football has to find a way to best service its foot fall.</p>
