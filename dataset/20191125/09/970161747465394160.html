      <p>A beautiful collection of fabrics has been launched across the world to highlight the plight of women surviving violence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).</p>
      <p>The clothes have been showcased by the women they were made for – the women of the City of Joy, survivors of the catastrophic, ongoing conflict in the DRC.</p>
      <p>The DRC is said to be one of the worst places in the world to be a woman. City of Joy is a leadership community for women who live there; survivors of brutal rape and mutilation by soldiers and civilians.</p>

      <p>Located in Bukavu in the Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, it provides a place for them to overcome pain and stigma to emerge as confident leaders, teaching the message that power can come from pain.</p>

      <p>During a visit to the City of Joy, Gabriela Sanchez, designer for specialist fabric maker Vlisco, was asked by the women there if she would design prints for them that would honour the work of Nobel Peace Prize winner Dr Denis Mukwege, the surgeon who, with his team of doctors, has helped to heal them.</p>
      <p>Awed by the strength of the women she met there, she created <a href="https://www.vlisco.com/">the City of Joy Collection</a>, which tells the story of the women who have made the journey from suffering to a place of love and hope.</p>
      <p>The fabrics are marked by the words ‘Love’, ‘Respect’ and ‘Strength’.</p>
      <p>The collection is made up of five printed super-wax fabric patterns in bold, bright patterns, with 100 different, vivid colours, created using the old techniques of wax printing.</p>

      <p>Five female African designers have been working with 15 graduates of the City of Joy to create empowering, personalised garments using the new fabrics.</p>
      <p>The collection will be showcased to a global audience by the women of the City of Joy at a gala event in Kinshasa on 25 November. The event aims to put an international spotlight on the issue of sexual violence against women.</p>
      <p>‘The first thought that came to mind when I met the women of the City of Joy was; “Is there anyone stronger than you?”‘ says Gabriela Sanchez, the Vlisco designer behind the collection.</p>
      <p>‘The collection aims to capture their journey from the darkest of places to a place of hope and love. It also portrays the great strength that comes from sisterhood.</p>

      <p>‘The designs suggest the beauty of the vagina and the respect it deserves, and they depict the forests and rivers and wildlife of the Eastern Congo – a place of fear but also joy.’</p>

      <p>The five fabrics each represent a different story inspired by the City of Joy:</p>
      <p><b>Sisterhood</b>: The knotting of the flowers represents inner turmoil. Further up the pattern the colours are brighter, illustrating the journey from pain to power. The intertwined flowers show the bond shared by the women of the City of Joy.</p>
      <p><b>The Orchid</b>: The base of the fabric represents the waves of turmoil experienced by the women. Moving upwards, the striking orchid in full bloom showcases the beauty of the vagina.</p>
      <p><b>Bouquet</b>: This fabric depicts the vagina in a beautiful but stark way. The fabric behind the florals represents the dark past but the flowers bring to life the splendour, inner beauty and strength of the women of the City of Joy.</p>
      <p><b>The Congo River</b>: The jungle represents the Congo’s bountiful, lush and green landscape. The abundance of life is depicted, and hope is shown through the opening in the clouds.</p>
      <p><b>The Congo</b>: The lion sitting on his perch represents Dr Mukwege, providing strength and hope to his beautiful country and the people in it.</p>
