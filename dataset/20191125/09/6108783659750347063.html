      <h3>Integrated with Twitch and running off Amazon's AWS cloud service.</h3>
      <p>An <a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/amazon/">Amazon</a> game streaming service will be intertwined with Twitch and will launch in 2020, a new report suggests.</p>
      <p>An initial report from <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/amazon-developing-game-streaming-service">The Information</a> has been supported by a new report from <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/google-stadia-wants-to-be-the-future-of-gaming-so-do-microsoft-sony-and-amazon/">CNET</a> which suggests that amazon will announce the streaming service ahead of launch next year.</p>
      <p>The report furthers that Amazon’s AWS cloud service will power the streaming service, and that it will be integrated with Twitch like Google’s Stadia service is with YouTube.</p>
      <p>The reports also reference Amazon’s own admissions that it is working on a streaming service.</p>
      <p>“We believe the evolution that began with arcade communities a quarter at a time, growing to the live streams and e-sports of today, will continue to a future where everyone is a gamer and every gamer can create, compete, collaborate and connect with others at massive scales,” one Amazon job posting this month read.</p>
      <p>We’ll have more on <a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/amazon/">Amazon’s</a> game streaming service as news becomes available.</p>
