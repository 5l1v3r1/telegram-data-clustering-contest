      <p>Amir H H Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani will meet with the President of the Republic of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, today at the Amiri Diwan.</p>
      <p>H H the Amir and President Erdogan will co-chair the fifth session of the Qatar-Turkey Higher Strategic Committee.</p>
      <p>The two leaders will also witness the signing of a number of agreements and memorandums of understanding between the two countries in different areas.  </p>
      <p>The meetings of the Committee are part of the growing partnership and strategic relations between Doha and Ankara; they are of great interest to both parties, especially as there are many goals that the two countries aspire to achieve and accomplish in various sectors.</p>
      <p>The establishment of the Qatar-Turkey Higher Strategic Committee dates back to December 2014 when HH the Amir and the Turkish President signed the agreement to establish it. Large number of ministries, as well as several governmental and private institutions from both sides, participated in the preparation of bilateral cooperation agreements.</p>
      <p>The first session of the Committee, which was hosted by Doha in December 2015, placed the bilateral relations between the two countries on an institutional path that ensures the consolidation of the previous achievements and the expansion of their horizons beyond political excellence to other fields, especially trade, investment, culture and security. </p>
      <p>The Higher Strategic Committee held four meeting so far, alternating between the two countries, during which more than forty-five agreements have been signed-in various fields. That number is expected to increase to 55 with the fifth meeting of the Committee.</p>
      <p>The two leaders’ summit in Doha today is the 26th between President Erdogan and H H the Amir in 60 months, which is a record in the history of relations between the two countries, according to Anadolu Agency. </p>
      <p>The agency said that the relations between Doha and Ankara are developing and diversifying at all levels, and the fifth meeting of the Higher Strategic Committee is the culmination of those distinguished relations that provide a model for regional relations. </p>
      <p>The Turkish-Qatari relations are an integrated model of cooperation and coordination between partners and brothers in various political, economic, cultural and military fields, the economic relations have witnessed rapid growth since the imposition of the unjust blockade on Qatar, represented in increasing the volume of trade exchange between the two countries; which promises a prosperous future for these relations and their continued development and growth for the benefit of the two countries and their peoples.</p>
      <p>On many occasions, the two countries have shown that their friendship is true and solid, that was reflected in their stand by each other in the difficult days, in particular, Turkey’s efforts to lift the unjust blockade imposed on Qatar, as well as Doha’s strong position and support for Ankara during the failed coup attempt in the summer of 2016, and then Qatar’s position in the crisis of the Turkish lira last year, where H H the Amir paid a visit to Turkey and directed to provide a package of economic projects, investments and deposits of approximately QR55bn ($15bn) in support of the Turkish economy.</p>
      <p>Qatar and Turkey have strong economic relations based on trade exchange. In recent years, these relations have witnessed great prosperity in various fields and economic activities, these relations also culminated in many agreements in various fields.</p>
