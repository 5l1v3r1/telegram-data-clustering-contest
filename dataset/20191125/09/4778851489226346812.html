      </p>
      <p>Hibs hit back at Motherwell on social media on Saturday night after the club's 3-1 victory in the Ladbrokes Premiership.</p>
      <p>In the aftermath of the game - won thanks to goals from Christian Doidge, Florian Kamberi and Daryl Horgan after Liam Polworth had given the visitors the lead - Motherwell sent out their match report with a caption which suggested they felt hard done by.</p>
      <p>It read: "A dominating Motherwell performance brings nothing as Hibernian win in the capital."</p>
      <p>Hibs seemed to disagree with the summary of their opponents, as they soon released their own tweet a short time afterwards that looked suspiciously like a mimic of the original.</p>

      <p>It read: "A dominant Hibernian performance brings three points as the Hibees win in the capital."</p>
      <p>The tweet also contained the exact same photo as the Motherwell one - Martin Boyle battling away defender Jake Carroll for possession - while the bit.ly link to the match report had been altered to read 'bit.ly/DominantHibs'.</p>
