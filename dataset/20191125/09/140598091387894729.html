      <h1>Jofra Archer claims he was racially abused by a spectator during New Zealand Test</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T09:19:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 09:19</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/telegraph-sport/" target="_blank">Telegraph Sport</a></address>
      <p>The England and Wales Cricket Board is looking into Jofra Archer's claim that he was racially insulted while batting against New Zealand in the first Test.</p>
      <p>Archer scored a second-innings 30 as England failed to bat out the final day in Mount Maunganui, losing by an innings and 65 runs.</p>
      <p>The 24-year-old bowler said on Twitter: "A bit disturbing hearing racial insults today while battling to help save my team.</p>
      <p>"The crowd has been amazing this week except for that one guy. The Barmy Army was good as usual also."</p>
      <p>Archer, who was born in Barbados and represented West Indies at Under-19 level, has been fast-tracked into the England side and made an impressive test debut during the Ashes series against Australia.</p>
      <p>New Zealand Cricket said they plan on "apologising to Archer" in a statement released on Monday.</p>

      <p>"New Zealand Cricket will be apologising to English fast bowler Jofra Archer, who was racially abused by a spectator as he left the field at the conclusion of the first Test at Bay Oval, Mt Maunganui," the statement read.</p>
      <p>"Although security providers at the venue were unable to locate the perpetrator, NZC will be examining CCTV footage and making further inquiries tomorrow in an endeavour to identify the man responsible.</p>
      <p>"NZC has zero tolerance towards abusive or offensive language at any of its venues and will refer any developments in the case to police.</p>
      <p>"It will contact Mr Archer tomorrow to apologise for the unacceptable experience, and to promise increased vigilance in the matter when the teams next meet in Hamilton."</p>
      <p>On the field, New Zealand cruised to an innings and 65-run win over England on the final day to take a 1-0 lead in the two-match series.</p>
