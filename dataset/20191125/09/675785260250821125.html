      <p>Harry plays Sysselman in the North who could turn out to be as annoying as Harry Potter's cousin Dudley.</p>
      <p>His Dark Materials is another epic fantasy based on a book series which sees two children go on a spell-binding adventure.</p>
      <p>Also based on the book of the same name, The War Of The Worlds tells the narrative of martians who wage war against the human race.</p>
      <p>Harry's appearance in both series didn't go unnoticed by hard-core fans.</p>
      <p>Others added: " <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/HisDarkMaterials?src=hashtag_click">#HisDarkMaterials</a> When your 14 yr old points out that Dudley Dursley is in His Dark Materials."</p>
      <p>"Am I going crazy or is that Dudley Dursley in His Dark Materials?!"</p>

      <p>"Watching His Dark Materials. I've got no idea what's going on. My heart's not really in it. I keep thinking about Escape to the Chateau on Channel 4, and getting my phone out to do shit like this, although I did just recognise the actor that played Dudley Dursley in Harry Potter."</p>
      <p>"Is Dudley Dursley in His Dark Materials? Asking for two excited children who may have just spotted him?"</p>
      <p>"Excuse me did i just see dudley dursley in ‘his dark materials’ ?!?!??!?!?"</p>
