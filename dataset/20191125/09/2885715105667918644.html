      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T09:47:06+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 09:47</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/pti/" target="_blank">PTI</a></address>
      <p>Attributing his recent success to a tweaked bowling grip, India speedster <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/umesh-yadav/">Umesh Yadav</a> said it has helped him achieve better control and more consistency in delivering out-swingers.</p>
      <p>Yadav finished with match figures of 8/81, which included a five-wicket haul in the second innings, to set up India’s innings and 46-run win in their first ever day-night Test against Bangladesh on Sunday.</p>
      <p>“Tweaking my bowling grip helped immensely,” Yadav said during a conversation with India opener <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/rohit-sharma/">Rohit Sharma</a> on ‘bcci.tv’.</p>
      <p>“My grip was different earlier so one or two balls would swing while a couple of them would either get deflected from the legs or run down the leg side for boundaries as byes. So it was difficult to control with this grip.</p>
      <p>“So I spoke to my coaches and also while discussing within ourselves, I felt when I hold the ball properly, I have more control and chances of moving the ball. So my outswinger became consistent and I could also throw in a few inswingers after making that change.”</p>
      <p>Fellow pacer <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/ishant-sharma/">Ishant Sharma</a>, who claimed five wickets in Bangladesh’s first innings and four in the second, said changing his wrist position helped him create angles which made life difficult for batsmen, especially left-handers.</p>
      <p>“I created angles in my bowling on the basis of my wrist position. If I come round the wicket to the left-hander, it would be more difficult for the batsman,” Ishant said.</p>
      <p>“Before that, I used to bowl but I couldn’t get the edge because it would land on the off stump and would go out. Now, I bowl at the stumps, so it becomes difficult for the batsman.”</p>
