      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, November 25 — Apart from promoting its pristine beaches and exotic islands, Indonesia is looking to become a hub for alternative treatment and attract more medical tourists.</p>
      <p>From soothing an aching back to treating mental and even spiritual illnesses, the country’s traditional or unconventional healing method seems to have the answer to nearly every sort of ailment.  </p>
      <p>In a bid to boost the country’s medical tourism, Indonesia’s Health Minister Terawan Agus Putranto announced recently that his country should capitalise on their “penis enlargement” massage.</p>
      <p>Known locally as Mak Erot, the massage is believed to be an alternative treatment to enlarge a person’s manhood.</p>
      <p>According to Vice Indonesia, Terawan has referred to Mak Erot as a national asset with high potential to attract medical tourists from abroad.</p>
      <p>“We must popularise the idea of traditional medicine for tourism.</p>
      <p>“We have an incredible herbal medicine industry that no one knows about outside Indonesia,” he said.</p>
      <p>He also cited Tongkat Ali (a leaf that is said to boost athletic performance and muscle mass), Purwaceng (a Viagra-like substance), and Mak Erot as potential services to boost medical tourism.</p>
      <p>“If we package it correctly, foreigners will be interested,” he said.</p>
      <p>Terawan also specifically brought up Kerok, coin and ointment treatment, as a worthy attraction for medical tourism.</p>
      <p>Known its varied benefits among the locals, Kerok is a method of treating a variety of ailments by rubbing a coin against the skin of the back with menthol ointment, which is believed to increase blood and oxygen circulation.</p>
      <p>“Don’t underestimate kerok. If we had 100 rooms and it takes 20 minutes per person, imagine how much revenue that would generate.</p>
      <p>“There are many other cultural gems that we have not exploited because we take them for granted, but to foreigners, it’s something intriguing,” he added.</p>
