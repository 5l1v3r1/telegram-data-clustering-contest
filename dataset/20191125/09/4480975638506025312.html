      <p>The buying interest around the British pound picked up some additional pace in the last hour and lifted the GBP/USD pair to fresh session tops, around the 1.2875-80 region.</p>
      <p>The pair caught some fresh bids on the first day of a new trading week and recovered a major part of the previous session's downfall to over one-week lows, triggered by the dismal UK flash <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/economic-calendar">PMI</a> prints for November and resurgent US dollar demand.</p>
      <h3>Focus remains on UK political, trade developments</h3>
      <p>The UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson's pledge to get the <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/macroeconomics/events/brexit">Brexit</a> done and bring a deal to leave the European Union back to the Parliament before Christmas was seen as one of the key factors that underpinned demand for the <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/currencies/gbpusd">British pound</a>.</p>
      <p>This comes on the back of the incoming UK election polls, which have been indicating a majority for the Conservative Party and led to a modest weekly bullish gap opening for the major amid a subdued US dollar price action.</p>
      <p>Despite a goodish intraday pickup in the US Treasury bond yields and remained US-China trade optimism, the greenback struggled to gain any meaningful traction and remained supportive of the pair's uptick through the early European session.</p>
      <p>The US President Donald Trump increased hopes of a trade deal on Friday and said that a deal with China was “potentially very close” and also indicated that he might not sign a bill passed by the Congress that supports Hong Kong.</p>
      <p>Moving ahead, the incoming UK political/Brexit-related headlines might continue to play a key role in influencing the pair's momentum on Monday amid absent relevant market-moving economic releases, either from the UK or the US.</p>
