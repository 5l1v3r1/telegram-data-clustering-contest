      <p>Last month Vancouver’s Donnelly Group <a href="https://www.vancouverisawesome.com/2019/10/04/donnelly-group-new-pub-marine-building-vancouver/">went public with the news</a> they’d taken over the pub space vacated by Elephant &amp; Castle inside the city’s historic Marine Building. Now Donnelly has revealed the name and concept for what they’re launching there.</p>
      <p>Called Brass Fish Tavern, the pub-restaurant takes its name from the art deco creatures that adorn the entrance to what was at one time the tallest building in Vancouver.</p>
      <p>Renovations to the space are being led by designer Ricky Alvarez, and will find the layout of the room somewhat reshaped.</p>
      <p>Brass Fish Tavern will align for the most part with what Donnelly patrons have come to know from their multiple ventures in Vancouver. The menu will offer a mix of “considered takes on pub classics with fresh dishes inspired by international culinary travels and exploration.”</p>
      <p>From the bar, guests will find a full cocktail program and local craft beers.</p>
      <p>The Donnelly Group says they are hoping to have Brass Fish Tavern open in the Marine Building in early January 2020.</p>

        <i>Brass Fish Tavern is located at 385 Burrard Street in Vancouver</i>
