        <b>Real Madrid manager Zinedine Zidane has called on the Spanish club's fans to stop booing Gareth Bale.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Wales forward received a <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/50530376">mixed reception</a> coming on as a substitute in a 3-1 win over Real Sociedad.</p>
      <p>It was his first Real appearance in seven weeks after his controversial <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/50478378">'Wales. Golf. Madrid'</a> flag celebration in Cardiff.</p>
      <p>"There is too much noise with Bale. He wants to be with us and do it well," said Zidane.</p>
      <p>"I hope this doesn't carry on for the rest of the season.</p>
      <p>"We want the fans to be with us from the beginning to the end, but we cannot control that."</p>
      <p>Zidane added: "I have not spoken to him [about the jeers], I have only congratulated him.</p>
      <p>"I can't tell you if it's unfair or not. Everyone can say what they want."</p>

      <p>Bale has endured a difficult relationship with the Bernabeu crowd since joining from Tottenham for a then world-record fee of Â£85m in 2013, despite helping the club win four Champions League trophies.</p>
      <p>In July he came close to joining Chinese side Jiangsu Suning, with coach Zidane saying his exit would be "best for everyone".</p>
      <p>The move was called off at the last minute when Real demanded a transfer fee.</p>
      <p>Bale seemed to re-establish himself in the club but returned to Spain injured in October after scoring <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/49949349">Wales' equaliser against</a> Croatia.</p>
      <p>He didn't play again until Wales' games against Azerbaijan and Hungary, a comeback labelled by the Spanish press as the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/50378786">'Miracle in Wales'</a>.</p>
      <p>Bale was jeered by supporters when his name was announced before kick-off on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The 30-year-old received a similar response when introduced from the bench after 67 minutes for his first Real appearance since 5 October, though by full-time Bale appeared to have earned back some support.</p>
      <p>He was applauded for the part he played in Modric's third goal and also for his defensive efforts as Real closed out the game.</p>

      <p>"He is integrated into the group and wants to play, just like everyone else," said Zidane.</p>
      <p>"The public has the right to do what they want, but I ask that they applaud everyone. I'm happy with the game and the victory and Bale came into the game well."</p>
      <p>Attention now turns to the Champions League for Zidane's side, who host Paris St-Germain on Tuesday (20:00 GMT).</p>
