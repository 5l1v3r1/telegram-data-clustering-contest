      <h2>A new study states, having avocadoes may help in keeping diabetes at bay. Read on to know how this fruit can be your best buddy in crusade against diabetes.</h2>

      <p>Avocado has already made a place for itself in the good book of nutritionists, thanks to its healthy monounsaturated fatty acids, vitamin D, vitamin E, and other major nutrients. Starting comes with a improving the function of your digestive system, alleviating depression and strengthening your vision to reducing your risk of osteoporosis and healthy cholesterol regulation, this stony fruit does it all for you. Now, it turns out  that avocados can help in diabetes prevention too. According to a study published in the journal Molecular <b>Nutrition and Food Research</b>, Avocation B (AvoB), a fat molecule found only in avocados, counters incomplete oxidation in skeletal muscle and the <a href="https://apc01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thehealthsite.com%2Fdiseases-conditions%2Fnew-ray-of-hope-for-migraine-treatment-714385%2F&amp;data=02%7C01%7Cparas.hemrajani%40zee.esselgroup.com%7C89f3683b880e472684aa08d77181a012%7C56bd48cdf31249e8b6c77b5b926c03d6%7C1%7C0%7C637102673875577304&amp;sdata=ez%2FpmZRu3ti7PBXFiJS3K18wkaFhCzW7ZqAmLoAt3FU%3D&amp;reserved=0">pancreas to reduce insulin resistance.</a> Incomplete oxidation is a state where your body is unable to burn fats due to obesity or diabetes.  Insulin resistance in diabetic patients doesn’t allow their to properly remove glucose from the blood. Diabetes has been linked with increasing the risk of heart disease, stroke and kidney disease.</p>
      <p>Here are the details of the study, that were given to ANI, by the researchers.</p>
      <p>For the first time, new research led by Prof. Paul Spagnuolo has shown how a compound found only in the fruit can inhibit cellular processes that normally lead to diabetes.In safety testing in humans, the team also found that the substance was absorbed into the blood with <a href="https://www.thehealthsite.com/diseases-conditions/type-3-diabetes-insulin-resistance-in-brain-causes-alzheimers-disease-684916/">no adverse effects in the kidney</a>, liver or muscle. Those complications can arise when mitochondria, or the energy powerhouses in the body’s cells, are unable to burn fatty acids completely. Normally, fatty acid oxidation allows the body to burn fats. Obesity or diabetes hinders that process, leading to incomplete oxidation. In their study, the team fed mice high-fat diets for eight weeks to <a href="https://www.thehealthsite.com/photo-gallery/diseases-conditions-want-to-tackle-obesity-inflammation-sip-on-green-tea-655720/obesity-depression--655740/">induce obesity and insulin resistance</a>. For the next five weeks, they added AvoB to the high-fat diets of half of the mice. The treated mice weighed significantly less than those in the control group, showing slower weight gain.</p>
      <p>More important, said Spagnuolo, the treated mice showed greater insulin sensitivity, meaning that their bodies were able to absorb and burn blood glucose and improve their response to insulin.</p>
      <p>In a human clinical study, AvoB given as a dietary supplement to participants eating a typical western diet was absorbed safely into their blood without affecting the kidney, liver or skeletal muscle. The team also saw reductions in weight in human subjects, although Spagnuolo said the result was not statistically significant. Having demonstrated its safety in humans, they plan to conduct clinical trials to test AvoB’s efficacy in treating metabolic ailments in people. Spagnuolo said the safety trial helped the team to determine just how much AvoB to include in the supplement formulation.</p>
