      <p>Kilmarnock winger Chris Burke admits that he is still loving life as a footballer.</p>
      <p>He has pointed to the likes of Jermain Defoe, Scott Brown and even tennis stars Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal as his inspiration to keep playing.</p>
      <p>He has insisted that he will give the game up when he loses the love for it, but there's no signs of that any time soon.</p>
      <p>He bagged a double at the weekend against Hearts, with an assist thrown in for good measure during Killie's wonderful 3-0 win.</p>
      <p>Burke said: “I don’t eat meat every day and I go to bed early.</p>

      <p>“I was fortunate enough to play with top players and my biggest influence was probably Arthur Numan because I used to be up against him in training.</p>
      <p>“However, there are so many guys, right across sport, who are still performing at the highest level in their 30s.</p>
      <p>“A lot of players still performing don’t need to play, it’s because they want to play. Look at Scott Brown – he still has the desire and is arguably Celtic’s best player.</p>
      <p>“Defoe is another one. He has just turned 37 but he still has the desire loves scoring goals.</p>
      <p>“In tennis there are guys such as Nadal and Federer, athletes at the top of their game.”</p>
