      <p>While the forward still has over two-and-a-half years remaining on his existing deal, interest in the 20-year-old's signature means that PSG feel the need to speed up negotiations.</p>
      <p>According to <i>L'Equipe</i>, sporting director <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/leonardo/"><b>Leonardo</b></a> is focused on trying to reach a positive conclusion in discussions with the France international.</p>
      <p>Given his desire to take on a new challenge, there have been previous claims that the World Cup winner intends to reject any offers from the Ligue 1 leaders.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/real-madrid/"><b>Real Madrid</b></a> are currently regarded as the favourites to sign Mbappe, while <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/liverpool/"><b>Liverpool</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/juventus/"><b>Juventus</b></a> have also been linked with a big-money approach for his signature.</p>
