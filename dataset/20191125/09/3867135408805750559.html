      <p>EdCC rocketeers see how high they can go in Pasco</p>
      <p>Edmonds Community College Rocketry Society members recently joined other rocket enthusiasts from Central Washington University and the Tri-Cities Rocketeers for a high-powered launch near Pasco.</p>
      <p>EdCC’s team of students launched five rockets on Nov. 9. Experienced rocketeer and past club president Brie Hall made the launch process look easy when launching her rocket that created stunning visual effects as it lifted off with a redline motor. Club member Tony Chuang was able to achieve National Association of Rocketry Level II Certification by launching his rocket to an estimated 4,000 feet and utilizing a dual deploy recovery chute system.</p>

      <p>“The Rocketry Society gives our students the opportunity to take STEM education outside of the classroom and to challenge themselves in ways that build their engineering portfolio,” said Will Hamp, Edmonds CC engineering faculty and club advisor. He achieved National Association of Rocketry Level I Certification by launching a PML Ariel rocket 1,029 feet into the air and reaching a top speed of 180 mph.</p>

      <p>Other rockets didn’t fare as well: Club president Trixie Teng’s rocket got caught in a tree, and Ryan Maxwell’s rocket is nowhere to be found.</p>
      <p>“But,” Hamp said, “we know exactly where the valuable knowledge and experience is — it resides in these talented students.”</p>

      <p>Scown has many hobbies, including cars, music and camping. He’s also a hard-working student who takes rigorous courses, such as Advanced Placement Government, and has an interest in going into politics. He’s also entertaining the idea of becoming a mechanic or engineer.</p>
      <p>Mizerski is an ASB officer who volunteers for the school, beautifying the grounds, helping out with events and serving on the district’s nutrition and wellness committee. In college, she wants to study to become a veterinarian. One teacher said Mizerski is “hard working and serves as a role model for other students in her class.”</p>
      <p>A successful book sale</p>
      <p>The 37th Friends of the Edmonds Library annual book sale in October didn’t disappoint, as the Frances Anderson Center gym played host to a wide assortment of books, DVDs and CDs.</p>
      <p>The sale raised more than $9,000, which will go toward the library and the services, resources and programs it provides.</p>
      <p>“I want to congratulate and thank the Friends for a well-organized and successful book sale,” said Richard Suico, managing librarian at the Edmonds Library. “Their hard work in raising funds and their advocacy help raise the community’s awareness of the library’s mission to be a community doorway to reading, resources and lifelong learning, and a center for people, ideas and culture. The FEL book sale contributes to fund programs, expedite facilities-related projects, and supports staff so we can focus on implementing our core services and strategic priority work.”</p>
      <p>A lifetime of achievement</p>
      <p>The Edmonds Community College Foundation honored Diana Clay with the Cornerstone Lifetime Achievement Award at its Oct. 24 Foundation Scholarship reception, where more than 200 scholarship recipients and donors recognized Clay’s service. Clay recently retired from her many volunteer roles at the college and will be greatly missed.</p>

      <p>The lifetime achievement award recognizes long-serving, devoted supporters of the community college and the college foundation as giving truly significant and meaningful support through their financial or volunteer efforts. The award honors the recipient as a legend in helping make the college and the foundation what they are today.</p>
      <p>“For over two decades Diana Clay has dedicated herself to transforming lives through her work with the Edmonds Community College Foundation,” said Douglas Fair, Foundation board member and Snohomish County District Court judge. “As chair of critical committees such as finance and special events, she provided steady guidance that allowed the Foundation to flourish.”</p>
      <p>Clay joined the Foundation’s Board of Directors in 1997 and served as its treasurer from 1999 to 2017. She served on numerous committees during her tenure, most notably on the Development Committee; chair of the Finance Committee; and chair and co-chair of the Gala Committee for 15 years. She was appointed by the Washington state governor’s office as an Edmonds Community College Trustee in 2011 and served for eight years.</p>
