      <p>Almost 1000 South Lanarkshire residents are waiting to see if they will be granted permanent residency after Brexit.</p>
      <p>In total, 2150 citizens of other EU countries have applied for settled status so that they can continue to call the region home once the UK leaves the EU.</p>
      <p>However, figures released by the Home Office last week revealed only 1200 had received settled status by September 30.</p>
      <p>The temporary pre-settled status had been offered to 600 people while the other 350 people are still waiting to find out the outcome of their application.</p>
      <p>That means 950 EU citizens currently have no legal right to remain permanently in the UK at the end of the Brexit process.</p>
      <p>Labour, the Lib Dems and the SNP in South Lanarkshire have all hit out at the “concerning” figures.</p>
      <p>Councillor Mark McGeever (Hamilton West and Earnock), deputy leader of the Lib Dem group, lambasted the failure. He said: “This is a disgraceful way to treat people.</p>
      <p>“Almost half of the applicants from our communities are being forced to live without the certainty they will be able to stay in the country they made home.</p>
      <p>“I can only imagine how anxious some will feel. Not even the hardest of Brexiteers could think it fair.</p>
      <p>“Many of these EU nationals do absolutely vital jobs in the NHS or in local businesses.</p>
      <p>“It will be a huge loss to communities in places like Hamilton, Blantyre, Cambuslang and Rutherglen if Boris Johnson’s reckless right-wing government drives them away.”</p>
      <p>He added: “These figures are a stark warning that the Tories’ failures really could create another crisis like the Windrush scandal.</p>
      <p>“This is yet another example of why we need to stop Brexit, stay in the European Union, protect the rights of British and EU citizens, and build a brighter future for our country.</p>
      <p>“With every day that passes it becomes more-and-more clear that Boris Johnson’s hard Brexit will have terrible consequences, and Jeremy Corbyn’s refusal to support remaining in the EU proves he cannot provide the leadership Britain needs.”</p>
      <p>Cllr Joe Fagan (East Kilbride Central North), leader of the Labour group, added: “Across the country, EU citizens in the UK have reported issues with the government settled status scheme and the application process.</p>
      <p>“It is deeply concerning that EU citizens who have lived here and contributed to our economy for many years could lose out of their right to settled status because of circumstances entirely outwith their control.”</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for the SNP group said: “These figures are concerning and another reason why the chaos and uncertainty of Brexit must be called to an end.</p>
      <p>“The fact that the UK Government are making EU nationals register to remain in the country they call home is appalling and shows just how out of touch they are.</p>
      <p>“The upcoming elections on December 12 are an opportunity to send Boris Johnson a message; Scotland wants no part of his Brexit Britain and we deserve a say over our future.”</p>
      <p>Conservative group leader Cllr Alex Allison (Clydesdale East) had more belief in the Home Office than his colleagues.</p>
      <p>He said: “With the figures that we have received, 1810 settled status applications of 2150 received from South Lanarkshire have been concluded and I am confident that the remainder will be concluded.</p>
      <p>“I strongly value the contribution EU nationals make to South Lanarkshire and I am pleased that the UK Government has guaranteed the status of EU nationals in the UK.</p>
      <p>“I appreciate the settled status scheme may not appear ideal to some; however, as freedom of movement comes to an end, it is entirely necessary to ensure there is no confusion over any EU nationals’ status.</p>
      <p>“I would encourage any EU nationals who have not yet signed up to the scheme to do so.”</p>
