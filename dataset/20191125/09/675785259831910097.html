      <h2>Roman Abramovich isn’t seen at Stamford Bridge as often these days but the Chelsea owner is still more involved than ever, says Blues chairman Bruce Buck</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T09:55:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 09:55</time> by <a rel="author">Dan Gibbs</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> owner <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/roman-abramovich">Roman Abramovich</a> has no plans to sell the club at a ‘bargain’ price, according to chairman Bruce Buck.</p>
      <p>The Russian chief has owned the Blues since 2003 but in recent years there have been doubts over his long-term commitment to the west London club.</p>
      <p>Abramovich has reportedly not been to a home match since the spring of 2018 when the British government delayed renewing his vida.</p>
      <p>The 53-year-old subsequently withdrew his UK visa application prompting speculation from fans he could be ready to walk away from his commitments to the club.</p>
      <p>But Buck insists that’s not the case and when prompted for a response on whether Abramovich may be planning to sell he told the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/24/roman-abramovich-no-plan-sell-chelsea-bruce-buck">Guardian</a> : “So far as I know, absolutely not; to the contrary.</p>

      <p>“I have never heard a word from Mr Abramovich: ‘Let’s get this ready for a sale,’ or something.</p>
      <p>“Because of the political situation, there are people who think they might want to buy <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> football club at a bargain.</p>
      <p>“We do get inquiries and we really have nothing to say to these people.</p>
      <p>“In terms of being involved, in looking at new players, talking about whether to extend players’ contracts, do we buy this player, do we sell this player, [Abramovich] was always intimately involved in that from day one and is just as intimately involved now.</p>
      <p>“He talks to Marina [Granovskaia] – the board member who supervises the football operation – several times a day, every day.</p>
      <p>“Marina has been doing that for seven or eight years; that hasn’t let up or changed at all.”</p>

      <p>Abramovic has also cancelled plans for a new 60,000 seat stadium that has not helped his case when trying to prove to fans he has no intention of selling up.</p>
      <p>Chelsea are currently under a transfer ban but expect to find out in mid-December whether their appeal against UEFA’s punishment is successful.</p>
      <p>If that’s the case, Frank Lampard will be allowed to sign players in January to bolster his ranks.</p>
      <p>But Buck reminded coy on whether funding would be available for the club legend as he responded to suggestions the club appears to be on hold.</p>
      <p>“I understand what you are saying and it is hard to disprove it, except to say: ‘Let’s see what happens in the next transfer window.’” he said.</p>
      <p>“The point I am making – it’s a glib one – if we go out in the next window and spend a zillion, it’s pretty hard to argue that things are on hold.</p>
      <p>“The transfer ban has led to more opportunities for the young players.</p>
      <p>“I can’t deny that if there wasn’t a transfer ban we might have splurged out on one or two or three players.</p>
      <p>“So, yes, it was some of that; it was Frank Lampard, the players that were ready, a whole collection of things that resulted in where we are now.</p>
      <p>“It makes Mr Abramovich very happy, because he is very interested in the academy.</p>
      <p>“I would guess he’s one of the very few owners that have been to lots of academy matches.”</p>
