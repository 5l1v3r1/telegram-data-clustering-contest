      <p>Vivo will reveal the Vivo X30 in the next month, right before the end of the year. After a couple of rumors, we finally have a good look at the phone’s rear thanks to a new video teaser. The 30-second video reveals a vertical camera setup in the upper left corner inside a rectangular island. Thanks to the <a href="https://www.weibo.com/1809745371/IhOskoSf0">teaser</a>, we also have a good look at the beautiful neat gradient finish.</p>

      <p>Interestingly enough, the video teaser also reveals some details about the camera specs. It confirms 16mm to 135mm focal length and F/1.8 to F/3.0 apertures. Moreover, it confirms that fact the Vivo X30 will ship with an ultrawide angle camera and a long F/3.0 telephoto. The latter should adopt a periscope-like that ends in the aforementioned rectangular aperture.</p>

      <p>According to rumors, the X30 will be the first smartphone to feature Samsung’s Exynos 980 chipset. This is the first Samsung SoC to come with an integrated 5G modem. The phone will be able to operate both on standalone and non-standalone networks. Besides the 5G variant, we expect to see Vivo X30 coming in an LTE-only flavor. It should fit as a budget offering of the Vivo X30.</p>
      <p>The phone will be the first of the X series to come with 5G connectivity. Also, it will be Vivo’s second device after the NEX 3 5G. It will join the competition lead by Xiaomi Mi 9 Pro 5G, Honor V30 5G and Huawei Nova 6 5G on the domestic market of China.</p>
