      <h1>Sharon Strzelecki has a new buddy called Kim, and it’s very ‘noice’ indeed</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T09:37:38+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 09:37</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/author/newdaily/" target="_blank">The New Daily</a></address>
      <p>Comedian Magda Szubanski has reprised her famous role as keen netballer and all-round doormat Sharon Strzelecki in a TV turn that is already proving a massive hit with fans.</p>
      <p>Strzelecki plays a leading role in the latest Uber Eats ad, which starts with her on the couch in her netball uniform discussion dinner options with her buddy Kim.</p>
      <p>Moment later, it’s revealed that Kim is not <i>Kath and Kim</i>‘s Gina Riley but US reality star and entrepreneur Kim Kardashian West.</p>
      <p>The pair discuss what they will have for dinner – Strzelecki decides on pesto gnocchi and garlic bread to keep her “carbed up”, while Kardashian West opts for a “chicken schnitty with chips and chicken salt”.</p>

      <p>The commercial finishes with Strzelecki trying to teach Kardashian West how to pronounce “nice” (actually, it’s “noice”) and other elements of “the Queen’s English”.</p>
      <p>The ad, which was filmed in Los Angeles and reportedly took 12 hours to shoot, was unveiled on Sunday night. It’s part of Uber Eats’ often cheeky “Tonight I’ll be eating” campaign, which has previously starred Sophie Monk, Beau Ryan, Ryan Maloney, Naomi Watts and Boy George.</p>
