      <h1>Equinor's Johan Sverdrup Offshore Oilfield Turns Around Norway's Production Slide</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T09:16:48+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 09:16</time> by <a rel="author">Robert Boslego</a></address>
      <p>Summary</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Johan Sverdrup began producing early October.</li>
        <li>Production expected to reach 400,000 b/d in December and 440,000 b/d ahead of schedule.</li>
        <li>Ultimate production capacity will be 660,000 b/d with &lt; $2/b operating cost.</li>
        <li>After sliding, Norway's oil production will add to non-OPEC production in 2020 and thereafter.</li>
        <li>Equinor is also a leader on offshore wind projects.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Norway’s oil production, including condensates and natural gas liquids, rose to 1.83 million barrels per day in October. Production had been sliding over the past few years, but Equinor (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EQNR">EQNR</a>), formerly Statoil, started production on the giant Johan Sverdrup offshore oilfield on October 5<sup>th</sup>, two months ahead of schedule and underbudget. The field was already producing well over 300,000 b/d and loading volumes are <a href="https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/oil/111919-norways-johan-sverdrup-oil-giant-producing-well-over-300000-b-d-six-weeks-from-start-up">expected</a> to average around 400,000 b/d in December. All 8 production wells drilled are now on-stream, ahead of schedule.</p>

      <p>Phase one production had been scheduled to ramp-up to 440,000 b/d in the summer. But the company plans to begin drilling 2 to 4 additional wells that would bring production up to phase one capacity.</p>
      <p>The field is named after the father of Norwegian parliamentarism. After reaching plateau production of the first phase, operating costs are projected to be under $2/b. The field will be powered from shore to run the platforms, instead of local supply, which reduces carbon emissions. Norway’s electric grid is 95% supplied by hydropower from 937 dams.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Phase two will ramp-up production to 660,000 b/d by late 2022. The oil will be piped to the Mongstad refinery, processed and sold as products.</p>
      <p>According to the U.S. Energy Dept., Norway’s production is projected to exit 2020 at 2.17 million barrels per day. Production for the year is projected to rise 360,000 b/d from 2019, but as indicated above, Equinor is ahead of schedule.</p>

      <p>In addition to producing almost all of its electricity from renewable energy, electric vehicles accounted for 58 percent of all new car sales last March. Tesla's (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSLA">TSLA</a>) mass market Model 3 accounted for nearly 30 percent of new passenger vehicle sales, the Norwegian Information Council for Road Traffic, or OFV, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/04/02/709131281/electric-cars-hit-record-in-norway-making-up-nearly-60-of-sales-in-march">reported</a>.</p>
      <p>Equinor is also a leader in renewable energy. It has an <a href="https://www.equinor.com/en/what-we-do/new-energy-solutions.html">offshore wind portfolio</a> that includes three wind farms off of UK, and is involved in large-scale wind projects off of the UK, Germany and the US. Empire Wind, off of Long Island, New York, is projected to power one million homes starting in 2025.</p>

          <b>Conclusions</b>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Equinor had planned the offshore production project in 2015, when oil prices had cratered. It is another testimony to the notion that the major oil companies basically ignore price cycles in their planning. Shell (NYSE:<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RDS.A">RDS.A</a>) (NYSE:<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RDS.B">RDS.B</a>) also began producing first oil in the Gulf of Mexico this year when it planned the project back during the price collapse.</p>
      <p>Production in Norway and other non-OPEC countries is projected to rise in 2020 by about 800,000 b/d, in addition to gains in the US. And Equinor is running ahead of schedule.</p>
      <p>Equinor and Norway are prime examples of what the future holds. Though not every country can be like Norway, India, China and the US have their own unique renewable energy sources. This is not to say that fossil fuels will not be used at any time for the rest of this century. It's more a degree of use and the oversupply which will push oil and gas prices down to the marginal costs of the lowest cost producers around the globe.</p>
