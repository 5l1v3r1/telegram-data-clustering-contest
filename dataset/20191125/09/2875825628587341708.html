      <h2>Crystal Palace footballer Ciara Watling reckons that I'm A Celebrity fans should still vote for Jacqueline to do the bushtucker trials</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T09:43:19+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 09:43</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Jacqueline Jossa's cousin has said that the bushtucker trials are "giving her a reason to cry" and wants I'm A Celebrity viewers to continue voting for her to do them.</p>
      <p>Crystal Palace footballer Ciara Watling said that Jacqueline didn't want to be known as a crier on the show and that she misses her children a lot.</p>
      <p>But Ciara disagrees with Jacqueline's partner <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/who-dan-osborne-towie-fame-13054898">Dan Osborne</a> , who is calling for the public to stop voting for her to do the trials.</p>
      <p>Speaking on Lorraine today via video link, Ciara said: "It's when she's crying I don't know whether she's scared of what people are thinking of her which I know does affect her a bit.</p>

      <p>"But deep down it gives her a reason to cry instead of looking like she's crying over the kids all the time because when she was going in she was saying, 'I don't want people to think I'm the crier and I don't want to be seen as that person'.</p>
      <p>"She definitely is missing the girls a lot."</p>
      <p>Earlier, host Lorraine Kelly also probed her about the reason why she thought the public kept voting for her to do the trials.</p>

      <p>"I think she didn't help herself scaring the world how scared she is," Ciara said.</p>
      <p>But when asked whether Jacqueline should be given a break, Ciara said that she was "there for a reason" and that she "knew what she was doing".</p>
      <p>"I think we should keep on voting," she said.</p>
      <p>Ciara also said that her cousin was an "honest person" and she couldn't wait for the public to see the "real her".</p>
      <p>"I can't wait for that to come out," she said. "We're all so proud of her"</p>
