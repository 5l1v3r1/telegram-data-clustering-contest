      <p>"Watching His Dark Materials. I've got no idea what's going on. My heart's not really in it. I keep thinking about Escape to the Chateau on Channel 4, and getting my phone out to do shit like this, although I did just recognise the actor that played Dudley Dursley in Harry Potter."</p>
      <p>"Is Dudley Dursley in His Dark Materials? Asking for two excited children who may have just spotted him?"</p>
      <p>"Excuse me did i just see dudley dursley in ‘his dark materials’ ?!?!??!?!?"</p>
