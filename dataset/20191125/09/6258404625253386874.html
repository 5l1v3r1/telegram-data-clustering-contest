      <p>Earlier this month, we reported that our suspicions about a 64-core/128-thread Ryzen Threadripper 3990X processor had been <a href="https://hothardware.com/news/msi-ryzen-threadripper-3990x-amd-zen-2">confirmed by an MSI leak</a>. And now, AMD has confirmed the existence of the Threadripper 3990X, and it will be an absolute performance beast.</p>
      <p>AMD is just giving us a high-level look at what the processor will offer, but we can confirm 64 physical cores and 128 threads. In addition, AMD says that the <a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/threadripper-3990x">Threadripper 3990X</a> will feature a total of 288MB of cache (L2+L3), while operating within a 280W TDP. </p>
      <p><a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/amd">AMD</a> already has bragging rights with its 24-core/48-thread Threadripper 3960X and 32-core/64-thread <a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/threadripper-3970x">Threadripper 3970X</a> compared to the newly released 18-core/36-thread <a href="https://hothardware.com/reviews/intel-core-i9-10980xe-cascade-lake-x-review">Intel Core i9-10980XE</a>, but the Threadripper 3990X is just the icing on the cake in the high-end desktop (<a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/hedt">HEDT</a>) market.</p>

      <p>At this time, AMD hasn't doled out any specifics on clock speeds, but given the sheer number of cores available, we'd expect specs might be pared back slightly from the 3.7GHz/4.5GHz base/boost clocks of the Threadripper 3990X.</p>
      <p>At this time, AMD is only indicating that the Threadripper 3990X will be available in 2020 – no other specific timeframes have been given. The company is also not divulging any details on pricing, although we'd expect that it won't come cheap. The Threadripper 3960X is priced at $1,399, while the Threadripper 3970X comes in at $1,999. Given its core count, we wouldn't be surprised to the see the Threadripper 3990X debut with a price tag of $2,999 or higher.</p>
