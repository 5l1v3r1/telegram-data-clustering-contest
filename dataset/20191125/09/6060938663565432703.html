      <p>Despite mixed reviews from the critics, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Anees-Bazmee">Anees Bazmee</a> multi starrer comedy action drama which features John Abraham, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Ileana-D-Cruz">Ileana D'Cruz</a>, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Anil-Kapoor">Anil Kapoor</a>, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Pulkit-Samrat">Pulkit Samrat</a> and Kriti Kharbanda, their film 'Pagalpanti' has managed to grow at the domestic box office.</p>

          <b>Pagalpanti Movie Review : A hotchpotch of bumbling characters</b>
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>According to the latest report on Boxofficeindia.com, 'Pagalpanti' has collected another Rs 8.25 crore after opening to Rs 5 crore on its first day. A good word of mouth has helped the film grow at the weekend and saw a good jump since its first day. With Rs 5 crore and Rs 6.25 crore respectively from its first and second day, the film has reached a total of Rs 19.50 crore by minting in Rs 8.25 crore on its first Sunday.</p>
      <p>John and Ileana's multi-starrer has been facing strong competition from <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Hollywood">Hollywood</a> fantasy film '<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Frozen-2">Frozen 2</a>' as well as Ayushmann's 'Bala' and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Sidharth-Malhotra">Sidharth Malhotra</a>'s 'Marjaavaan' in the domestic circuit.</p>
      <p>The entire cast had been promoting the film vigorously since the past few weeks and their camaraderie has left everyone in splits. Not only that but Kriti's confession about being in a relationship with co-star Pulkit too has got the film a lot of attention.</p>
