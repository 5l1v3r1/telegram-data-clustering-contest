      <p>A young waitress is fighting for her life in hospital after she was caught in the crossfire of a gangland <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/shooting">shooting</a> that left two mafia bosses dead.</p>
      <p>Mum-of-one Dominika Akirtava, 22, had brought drinks to an outside table at a restaurant when gunmen Kalashnikov rifles opened fire in the double assassination of a local 'godfather' and another mob figure.</p>
      <p>Ms Akirtava took cover near a table but was hit in the head by a ricocheting bullet in the Georgian breakaway region of Abkhazia, say reports.</p>
      <p>A woman inadvertently filmed the shooting as she recorded video of her daughter walking in the street.</p>

      <p>Local ‘godfather’ Astamur Shamba, nicknamed Astik, aged 38, was gunned down while he was eating lunch at an outside table at a restaurant in regional capital Sukhumi, say reports.</p>
      <p>Another crime boss, Alkhas Avidzba, nicknamed Khasik, 38, was shot dead.</p>

      <p>Two relatives of the local barons, who were members of the Gudauta criminal gang, were wounded in the gun attack, which so far has led to no arrests.</p>
      <p>The waitress - the mother of a two-year-old boy called Alan - was in a “grave” condition in hospital.</p>
      <p>A hospital source said the young woman was in a coma as doctors wait for her condition to change before performing surgery.</p>
      <p>Eyewitnesses described a chaotic and distressing scene as the gunmen attacked.</p>

      <p>An eyewitness said of the young mother: "She was in the wrong place at the wrong time.</p>
      <p>“She is in a coma,” said a hospital source.</p>
      <p>“Her <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/lifestyle/health/ten-ways-banish-high-blood-9621402">blood pressure</a> constantly drops, so they cannot start the surgery.”</p>
      <p>Ms Akirtava had worked at the restaurant for just two months, said locals.</p>

      <p>Officers launched a search of the area after the shooting.</p>
      <p>A burned-out Toyota car was found with four Kalashnikov rifles.</p>
      <p>It is believed the mob bosses were attacked as part of a gangland war.</p>
      <p>Rival criminal gangs are battling for control of the de facto sovereign state, which borders Russia in the South Caucasus on the eastern coast of the Black Sea.</p>
      <p>There were fears the gunmen had fled to Georgia.</p>
      <p>The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has told Britons not to travel to the Russian-occupied breakaway region of Abkhazia or to areas immediately adjacent to the Administrative Boundary Lines due to the situation there.</p>
      <p>It said: "The British government does not recognise the unilateral declarations of independence made by the de facto authorities in the breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia."</p>
      <p>Following the Georgian-Russian war in 2008, the Kremlin recognised the region as an independent state and Georgia declared Abkhazia "occupied" by Moscow forces.</p>
