      <p><b>Mumbai: </b>Congress-NCP-Shiv Sena leaders on Monday, submitted a letter staking claim to the officials at Raj Bhavan to form the government in Maharashtra, saying that the present government doesn't have the numbers.</p>
      <p>Earlier, MLAs from the three parties -- Cong-Sena-NCP also submitted a letter supporting the alliance.</p>

      <p>Solicitor General Tushar Mehta during the SC hearing said, ''Shiv Sena has 56, NCP -- 54 and INC -- 44 seats. There was talk about horse-trading but Guv possibly felt that the entire stable is stolen. I'm seeking time to file reply as there are questions that need to be discussed.''</p>
      <p>The three-party alliance has been asserting that they have the numbers to form a government in Maharashtra.</p>
      <p>The SC is likely to take a call on a floor test in Maharashtra.</p>
      <p>The SC on Sunday asked the Centre to produce two letters by Monday--- one from the Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis to prove majority and another from the Governor inviting him to form the government.</p>
      <p>Early on Saturday morning, in a major political twist, BJP’s Devendra Fadnavis took oath as Chief Minister of Maharashtra and Ajit Pawar as his deputy. The move came just hours after NCP-Shiv Sena-Congress had sealed a deal to form the government in the state.</p>
      <p>The NCP won 54 MLAs in the 288-member Maharashtra assembly, finishing third after the BJP (105) and Shiv Sena (56).</p>
