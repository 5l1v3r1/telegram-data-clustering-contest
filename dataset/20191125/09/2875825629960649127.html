      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/sport/gaa/hurling/">Hurling</a> star Padraic Mannion reckons Ireland is a tough place in which to grow up – despite witnessing the hardships of the Third World.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/galway">Galway</a> defender revealed volunteering for a charity in Sierra Leone had exposed him to the great distress people there face.</p>
      <p>But the teacher also believes social media has had a negative impact on young people in Ireland.</p>
      <p>He said: “I don’t know does it sound the right thing to say, but growing up in Ireland is a very tough place to be too – mentally.</p>
      <p>“Maybe not physically like it is here [Sierra Leone] but definitely mentally, it’s a tough place to be growing up with social media and everyone kind of being really self-conscious.</p>

      <p>“Whereas out here, you’re outside. If you’re bored you just go out and play. There’s no phones, there’s no Instagram, no Facebook.”</p>
      <p>The 26-year-old is a goodwill ambassador for charity Sightsavers and got to experience the work being done by the group during a trip to the African country.</p>
      <p>Speaking to the Sunday Independent Life magazine, he hailed the people of Sierra Leone for their ability to stay positive and strong-willed despite facing such adversity.</p>
