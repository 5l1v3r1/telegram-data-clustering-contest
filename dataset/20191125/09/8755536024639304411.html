      <p>Caitlyn Jenner has revealed that she “grew breasts” in the ’80s, but removed them to marry her ex-wife, Kris Jenner.</p>
      <p>The 70-year old is currently starring on ITV’s I’m A Celebrity, Get Me Out Of Here.</p>
      <p>Last night, she opened up to her fellow campmates, Jacqueline Jossa and Nadine Coyle about her transition, by confessing she began gender reassignment in the ’80s.</p>

      <p>When Jacqueline asked her about her surgeries, Caitlyn said she had a lot over the years.</p>
      <p>“Over many many years I had a lot but then near the end, it went pretty quickly because you can do your face and your chest all at the same time which they did.”</p>
      <p>“Actually for guys, if they go on oestrogen, they will grow boobs ok.”</p>
      <p>“And in my case, I was on oestrogen back in the ’80s and had a little 36/38B and then I met Kris and had them chopped off,” she confessed to Jaqueline.</p>

      <p>“I’m so confused in my life, and then the second time around 25 years later I was back on oestrogen obviously and they [breasts] came back some but not much.”</p>
      <p>Caitlyn said that she had her breasts enhanced once they grew back.</p>
      <p>“So I really had to have them done so it is kind of past the point of no return.”</p>

      <p>Jaqueline later complimented how strong Caitlyn was to share her story so “openly” with her camp mates.</p>
      <p>Speaking in the Bush Telegraph, she said: “I love the fact that she talks so openly and she feels like she can trust us and speak to us so openly and she puts everything into perspective as well.”</p>
      <p>“Like everybody goes through something. She’s like the amount of strength that woman has is amazing.”</p>
