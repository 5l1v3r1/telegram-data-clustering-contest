      <p>TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Costco kicked off its third annual Black Friday event in Taiwan at all 13 of its branches in the country on Monday (Nov. 25).</p>
      <p>Inspired by Black Friday, the traditional start of the Christmas shopping season in the U.S. that begins the day after Thanksgiving, Costco Taiwan is holding its third annual "Black Shopping Festival" (黑色購物節) from Nov. 25 to Dec. 1 this year. Due to the promotion having set off a mad buying frenzy across Taiwan over the past two years, the chain's various branches have this time set up pre-arranged parking lanes in an attempt to minimize traffic jams.</p>
      <p>To accommodate the anticipated hordes of Costco shoppers, opening hours from Nov. 25 to Nov. 28 will be changed to 9 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. and again modified to 8 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. from Nov. 29 to Dec. 1. This year's event will be extended from three days to seven days in the hopes of better distributing the crowds to provide a more comfortable shopping environment.</p>
      <p>Last year's discount bonanza included gold and diamond jewelry, a variety of popular 3C products, and home appliances, successfully attracting consumer attention. This year's shopping festival is expected to include discounts on more than 100 limited items, including packaged foods, home appliances, and consumer electronics, especially new Apple products, representing a total NT$200,000 (NT$6,500) in savings off original sticker prices.</p>
      <p>In addition, this year, some preferential items will be made public on the official Costco app the day before a promotion. Costco Taiwan Vice President Wang Yu-mei (王友玫) said that the seven-day shopping festival will include different discounts every day and that the longer the festival runs, the greater the discounts will be.</p>
