        <b>The two artists' new records will do battle for the top spot this coming Friday (November 29)</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/Coldplay">Coldplay</a>‘s <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/chris-martin">Chris Martin</a> has responded to <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/robbie-williams">Robbie Williams</a>‘ admission that he would be “crushed” if his new album <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/robbie-williams-the-christmas-present-album-review">‘The Christmas Present’</a> was prevented from topping the UK charts this week by the band’s <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/coldplay-everyday-life-review">‘Everyday Life’</a>.</p>
      <p>Williams <a href="https://www.metro.news/robbie-williams-ill-be-crushed-if-coldplay-beat-me-to-christmas-no-1/1805693/">reportedly</a> made the comments on stage during <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/robbie-williams-performs-surprise-gig-london-2570712">his Winter Wonderland performance in London’s Hyde Park on Thursday night (November 21)</a>.</p>

      <p>The singer told the crowd that he’d be “really happy” if ‘The Christmas Present’ took the top spot, but added: “And if not, I will be crushed. I don’t mind saying I want nice things to happen to me.”</p>
      <p>Speaking to <i>NME</i> in Jordan this weekend <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/watch-coldplay-perform-their-new-album-everyday-life-under-a-beautiful-sunrise-in-jordan-2570695">during Coldplay’s album launch gig in the country</a>, Martin said that he “didn’t mind” about the outcome of the chart battle.</p>
      <p>“Robbie Williams, I don’t mind… we don’t mind,” Martin said. “Honestly, we’re cool with that.</p>
      <p>“He can have it, all power to Robbie. Really he was around first, too.”</p>

      <p>Williams’ last three albums have all reached number one in the UK, while Coldplay have yet to fail to reach number one with each of their seven album releases to date.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/robbie-williams-tyson-fury-yes-really-poke-fun-christmas-parties-new-song-bad-sharon-2568605">Williams shared ‘Bad Sharon’ from his Christmas record — which contains an unlikely guest appearance from boxer Tyson Fury.</a></p>
      <p>The collaboration, which stemmed from the pair meeting in Las Vegas last year when Fury was set to face German boxer Tom Schwarz, hears Williams and Fury rattle through the highs and lows of drunken Christmas festivities.</p>
      <p>It transpires that ‘Bad Sharon’ is the woman “from the office” – elsewhere, the pair sing about stealing “the champagne” and getting “off your face’.</p>
