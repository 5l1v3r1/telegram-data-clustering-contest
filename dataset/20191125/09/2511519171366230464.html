      <p>As winter looms and most of us prepare for seasonal hibernation, the biggest stars of the music industry gathered in their glad rags in Los Angeles for the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/american-music-awards">American Music Awards</a> (<a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/amas">AMAs</a>). </p>
      <p>Providing an early dose of award season excitement, the AMAs celebrates the standout songs, artists and albums of the year, with 2019’s winners including Taylor Swift, Billie Eilish and Halsey.</p>
      <p>But much of the evening’s action unfolded outside the event on the red carpet, which saw swathes of celebrities arriving in custom designer garb.</p>
      <p>Many guests took their sartorial cues from the brightest corners of the colour wheel, with <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/selena-gomez">Selena Gomez</a> in a vibrant green mini dress by Versace and Dua Lipa posing alongside boyfriend Anwar Hadid in a silk fuchsia gown by Miu Miu.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, sparkles were scattered across the ensembles of Carrie Underwood and Taylor Swift, who chose an asymmetrical seaweed-coloured gown that came complete with a thigh-high slit.</p>
