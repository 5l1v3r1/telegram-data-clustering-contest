      <p>In response to the incident, New Zealand Cricket (NZC) released a statement, saying they will be apologising to Archer and increase vigilance in the stands for the upcoming Test in Hamilton.</p>
      <p>"Although security providers at the venue were unable to locate the perpetrator, NZC will be examining CCTV footage and making further inquiries tomorrow in an endeavour to identify the man responsible.</p>
      <p>"NZC has zero tolerance towards abusive or offensive language at any of its venues and will refer any developments in the case to police."</p>
