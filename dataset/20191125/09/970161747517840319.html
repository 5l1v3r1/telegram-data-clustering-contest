      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/the-x-factor/">X Factor</a>: Celebrity’s <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/louis-walsh/">Louis Walsh</a> has addressed his rollercoaster friendship with Simon Cowell ahead of the show’s hotly-anticipated final on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Joined by his only remaining act Megan McKenna on Lorraine, the infamous judge explained that he often falls out with the music mogul in public, but right now they’re in a good place.</p>
      <p>‘Your relationship [with Simon Cowell] intrigues me,’ began Lorraine. ‘You’re like best pals and you fall out and you fall back in again…’</p>

      <p>‘Yeah,’ Louis agreed. ‘We do it in public. He’s been really good to me. He’s a great, great person and he’s got his mojo back, big time.’</p>
      <p>Louis, who recently revealed <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/09/louis-walsh-reveals-he-only-quit-x-factor-after-simon-cowell-paid-him-off-it-was-a-lot-of-money-10886515/">Simon ‘paid him off’ to leave X Factor</a>, then pointed at Megan and added: ‘And he loves this one.’</p>
      <p>‘And I love Simon,’ Megan enthused. ‘He’s a really nice guy.’</p>

      <p>‘He can make or break people, he really can,’ Louis continued. ‘He usually makes them, if he likes them.’</p>
      <p>Last month, the 67-year-old presenter claimed that Simon paid him to leave the X Factor judging panel in 2012.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/tv/x-factor-louis-walsh-simon-20542099">Daily Star Online</a>, Louis explained: ‘I was paid off if you really want to know the truth.</p>
      <p>‘I’m back, listen, you would take it if you were offered it… it was a lot.’</p>

      <p>‘Simon has tried this before and it didn’t work but this feels like a completely new show and he may not want to admit it but deep down he knew he needed me back,’ the star said.</p>
      <p>‘He always realises in the end. I think he doesn’t like the fact I’ve had less plastic surgery than him, and me being on the panel is a constant reminder.’</p>
