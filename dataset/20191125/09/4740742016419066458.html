      <h2>The library will be closed for a week from Monday (November 25)</h2>

      <p><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/fishponds">Fishponds</a> Library will close for a week from Monday (November 25) while improvement works are carried out.</p>
      <p>The library service is removing a wall and getting rid of the old Citizen Service Point counter.</p>
      <p>It follows community library conversations which took place at the start of the year, where local people mentioned they would like to see a better layout and more space within the library.</p>
      <p>Deputy mayor Asher Craig, cabinet member with responsibility for libraries, said: “We are committed to making sure our library service meets the needs of the community and the city as a whole, and we are working with local people and organisations to make this happen.</p>
      <p>“The feedback from the people who use Fishponds Library is that they wanted more space, so we are making that happen.</p>
      <p>“We are sorry for any inconvenience caused during this closure, but we hope that the work will help improve the library experience for the local community.”</p>
      <p>Bristol Libraries recently launched a new fund to help community groups develop innovative ideas for their local library.</p>
      <p>The Library Innovation Fund will see just over £100,000 split between the city’s 27 libraries, and will enable communities to take the lead on putting the ideas they have about their local library and the library building into action.</p>
      <p>Projects could range from buying furniture or equipment to funding activities such as creative writing workshops. It could also be used as match funding for a larger project.</p>
