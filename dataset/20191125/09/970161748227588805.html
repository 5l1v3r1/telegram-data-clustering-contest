      <p>The follow-up to Death Stranding could end up being a horror game in the vein of P.T. and Silent Hills, according to a new hint form Kojima.</p>
      <p>It’s very common that when a developer leaves a larger company to set up their own studio they end up making something very similar to the games they’re already known for. But while <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/01/death-stranding-review-delivering-the-goods-11022052/">Death Stranding</a> did have a similar open world to Metal Gear Solid 5 the two games don’t really have much else in common.</p>
      <p>But the game Hideo Kojima was working on before he left Konami wasn’t anything to do with Metal Gear, but was instead horror game revival <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/06/norman-reedus-glad-silent-hills-cancelled-11052496/">Silent Hills</a>, which got as far as the infamous P.T. demo.</p>
      <p>He was even working on it with Death Stranding stars Norman Reedus and Guillermo del Toro, and now it seems his thoughts may be returning to making a new survival horror game of his own.</p>

      <p>The tweet above is somewhat ambiguous, especially given Kojima’s broken English, but it seems to suggest that he is thinking about making a new horror title.</p>
      <p>The movie he’s talking about is 2002 film <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eye_(2002_film)">The Eye</a>, which is set in Thailand. There was also an American remake in 2008 starring, Jessica Alba, which was, predictably, terrible.</p>
      <p>Although Kojima doesn’t specifically say that he wants to make a horror game next that’s certainly the implication, although the chances of Konami subcontracting him to make a Silent Hill title seems remote.</p>
      <p>Whether Reedus and del Toro would also work on Kojima’s next game is hard to say but more recently it was revealed that acclaimed manga artist Junji Ito, known for the likes of Gyo and Hellstar Remina, was also to be involved in Silent Hills.</p>
      <p>If Kojima could manage to enlist him again then that would be even more interesting, although when we might hear about his next game – whatever it is – is impossible to guess.</p>
