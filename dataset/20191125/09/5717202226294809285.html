      <h1>Weekend double takes Joselu to six goals since leaving Newcastle last summer</h1>
      <h2>The Spaniard is back scoring goals after leaving St James’ Park during the transfer window.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T09:15:06+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 09:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/sam-preston/" target="_blank">Sam Preston</a></address>
      <p>Former Newcastle hitman Joselu scored twice for his new club Alaves last night as they won 2-0 over Eibar in La Liga.</p>
      <p>The Spaniard now has three goals in his last two games and six in 13 overall (<a href="https://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/joselu/leistungsdaten/spieler/81999">Transfermarkt</a>) for his new employers, having left St James’ Park during the summer under Steve Bruce.</p>
      <p>Joselu never looked good enough for Newcastle but their own scoring woes have continued while he has come out of his shell somewhat and got back on the goal trail in different surroundings.</p>
      <p>He has played the majority of matches and looks to be fully enjoying life away from the north east, while Joelinton toils to carry the goalscoring burden.</p>

      <h3>TBR’s View – Joselu was never good enough for Newcastle and the move was right for all parties</h3>
      <p>There was respect for the way Joselu gave his all for Newcastle but he was never the man to lead the line for the Magpies with enough quality.</p>
      <p>The move back to Spain was right for all parties and that’s been shown by the way he has started hitting the net back in a country where he is more comfortable and at a club where expectations are lower.</p>
