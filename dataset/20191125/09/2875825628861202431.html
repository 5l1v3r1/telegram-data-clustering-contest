      <h2>Coronation Street star Andy Whyment 'hasn't laughed like that in so long' as his long-suffering wife watches him in the I'm A Celebrity jungle</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T09:31:55+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 09:31</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>While <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/im-celebrity-screaming-fight-ends-20952715">Andrew Maxwell and Ian Wright</a> are butting heads, there's one I'm A Celebrity star who seems to be lapping up every single minute - cockroaches and all.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/coronation-street">Coronation Street</a> star Andy Whyment was a late arrival to the jungle camp, but has never been happier, says his long-suffering wife Nicola.</p>
      <p>"Andy is living his best life in the jungle," she told <a href="https://www.ok.co.uk/celebrity-news/andy-whyment-wife-nichola-kids-20938809">OK!</a> magazine.</p>
      <p>"I think he just showed everyone how excited he is to be there. I've not seen him laugh that much in so long. I hope he doesn't struggle too much in the jail camp as he loves his food and sleep."</p>
      <p>Andy went in at the same time as Cliff Parisi, and was in paroxysms of laughter as the pair did their first Bushtucker trial in Ol' Dingo Town.</p>

      <p>And while some of his I'm A Celebrity campmates have already grown weary of the lack of food and sleep, Andy's had a smile on his face ever since he arrived.</p>
      <p>"I think the hardest part will be the hunger," he had said before jetting Down Under.</p>
      <p>"My co-star Jennie [McAlpine] did the show in 2017 and warned me about how hungry you get when you're on basic rations. Antony Cotton also did the show in 2011 and he said I was going to feel starving."</p>
      <p>He added to OK!: "I just love my food! There's a joke on the Corrie set that as soon as they announce it's lunchtime, I bomb it straight to the canteen. Sometimes the cast have physically held me back to stop me getting to the queue first!</p>

      <p>"I've got a little pot belly, so maybe it'll be good for getting rid of that. As for the gross eating challenges, I think that's a lot about mindset. When you want to do well for your camp and you’re starving, I'm sure you find a way to power through it."</p>
      <p>But Andy admitted the hardest part of his jungle stint would be the time away from his family.</p>
      <p>"Even when I work away from home, I can call Nic and FaceTime the kids," he added.</p>
      <p>Andy, who plays Kirk Sutherland on the ITV soap, has previously opened up about the horrific bullying he experienced as a child.</p>

      <p>He began ballet aged eight, but other kids at his Bolton school were jealous and would relentlessly tease him.</p>
      <p>"It was ­verbal rather than physical, but once one started a few of them would join in," Andy said.</p>
      <p>"It was jealousy more than anything else. I was ­doing something with my life and they were just hanging about the street corners getting hammered every week.</p>
      <p>"At one stage my dad was thinking of pulling me out of the school.</p>
      <p>"But I told him I didn't want him to, because if I left then they'd have won. So I stayed and got on with it."</p>
      <p>Andy has been on TV since he was a teenager, starting with roles on shows including Where The Heart Is and The Royle Family.</p>

      <p>He also sang in a rock band and busked in Manchester for three years so he didn't have to "sponge off" his parents.</p>
      <p>Andy only entered the jungle camp on Thursday, but he's already become the new favourite to win the show.</p>
      <p>He won the hearts of the viewers with his rolling commentary during a Bushtucker Trial which saw Cliff Parisi try to avoid buffaloes, and lucky dipped his way through fish guts to find his five stars.</p>
      <p>Whyment's commentary and comparing it to "just like watching it on the telly" had hosts Ant and Dec in stitches throughout before he was sent to Jungle Jail by the sherif.</p>
