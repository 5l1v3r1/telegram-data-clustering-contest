      <p>A 61-year-old woman had to be evacuated from her home during the incident.</p>
      <p>Cops closed one lane on the road as they probed the crash.</p>
      <p>It is believed the car involved was a blue Vauxhall Zafira, which reportedly caught fire as it left the road before smashing into the house.</p>
      <p>Three fire crews battled the flames, which had taken hold in the house, before extinguishing the blaze and leaving the scne around 3.20am.</p>
      <p>The Police Investigations and Review Commissioner (Pirc) is now probing the involvement of officers in the lead up to the smash.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for the force said: "We can confirm the vehicle was involved in an earlier pursuit that morning.</p>
      <p>“As such, in line with the standard procedure, the incident has been reported to Pirc.”</p>
      <p>A spokesman for Pirc’s investigation team said: “We are carrying out an assessment to determine whether a full investigation is required.”</p>
      <p>At the weekend, Sergeant Donald Sinclair, of Stornoway’s Church Street station, said: “Our enquiries into the circumstances of the crash are ongoing and I am appealing for anyone who saw the alleged crash or who saw a blue Vauxhall Zafira being driven on the A857 before 1.30am to come forward.</p>
      <p>“I’m particularly keen to speak to anyone who may have dash-cam footage which could help with our enquiries.”</p>
      <p>Those with information can contact police on 101, quoting reference number 0366 of 23 November 2019.</p>
