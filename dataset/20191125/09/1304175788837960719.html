      <p><b>insurance4carhire</b>, analysed Google search data to reveal that Tallinn, Estonia is Europe’s most sought-after Christmas city, followed by Vienna, Strasbourg and Krakow – suggesting they’re popular choices for a festive trip. The car hire excess insurance provider combined a list of search terms following the format ‘Christmas in…’ to reveal which of Europe’s cities and countries were most Googled by people in the UK in the last year.</p>
      <p>Between October 2018 and September 2019, over 42,000 people searched for ‘Christmas in Spain’ awarding Spain the title of the most-Googled country, followed by France, Germany and Iceland. With over 600 searches a year for ‘Christmas in Tallinn Estonia’, Tallinn is the most popular city indicating it’s a favourite for people in the UK to visit over Christmas.</p>
      <p>Tallinn, Estonia, is also claim to a European Best Destinations award for Best Christmas Market in Europe 2019<sup>1</sup>. This year the market is open from 15th November 2019 to 7th January 2020.</p>

      <p>However, research by insurance4carehire showed that, despite ‘fly and drive’ holidays being a common choice, one-in-four people are still being caught out by ‘compulsory’ excess insurance at the car rental desk.</p>
      <p>insurance4carhire compared car hire excess cover prices from five well-known car rental companies to reveal that for a weeklong trip to Spain in December, consumers can expect to pay an average of £104 more<sup>4</sup> for single-trip excess cover than if they’d bought an annual policy from insurance4carhire in advance.</p>
      <p>To help travellers get the most out of their car hire and avoid hidden costs, insurance4carhire has written a guide to car hire in Europe which highlights the most common concealed costs.</p>
      <p><b>Claire Gardner </b>from insurance4carhire commented “<i>With Spain, France and Germany being only a short trip from the UK, offering beautiful Christmas markets, bustling cities and endless culture – it’s unsurprising these countries are a firm favourite for Brits, - particularly with interest around Christmas. Spain is also a popular choice for UK expats which could be another reason for its popularity with Brits potentially visiting family or friends over the festive period.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>European Christmas markets are world-famous and with Tallinn’s being voted home to Europe’s Best Christmas Market 2019, it’s unsurprising that the city is of interest to us – which is great to see considering it’s further afield than other popular Christmas market destinations.” </i>
