      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T09:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 09:00</time> by <a rel="author">Shirley Bartynek, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/shirley-bartynek/</a></address>
      <p>A group of generous women have donated £1500 to support the ongoing work of Hamilton Churches Drop-in Centre.</p>
      <p>The volunteer team have been in Beckford Street for 20 years and open their doors each evening to provide a safe place for anyone who needs a hot meal, warm environment and friendly smile.</p>
      <p>Reverend Malcolm Anderson, of Blantyre Congregational Church, helps to run the centre and visited the ladies of Blantyre Bowling Club to talk about the work they do.</p>
      <p>June Houldsworth began a savings club to raise money for the centre and she said: “Throughout the past year we have been putting some money by month by month, which was supplemented by the sale of cards to help a local charity, and this year we agreed to support the drop-in centre after hearing about the wonderful work that is done within our local community.”</p>
      <p>The ladies handed the cash over to Rev Anderson, who said: “On behalf of the trustees, I am overwhelmed to receive a cheque for £1500 to support the ongoing work of the drop-in centre.</p>
      <p>“The thoughtfulness and generosity of the ladies from Blantyre Bowling Club have reminded me, that there are people who genuinely care about the plight of others, especially those who are dependent upon our centre.”</p>
      <p>He continued: “In the centre we also have a clothes store, shower facilities and washing facilities if our guests require further help and support. The centre is opened each night at 7pm and is supported by an army of volunteers who give of their time and generosity freely.</p>
      <p>“The drop-in centre is a registered Scottish charity and is solely dependent upon the financial support and generosity of the local community.</p>
      <p>“On behalf of everyone associated with the work of the drop-in centre, we warmly and sincerely thank all the ladies for their generosity and their ongoing support.”</p>
      <p>If you would like to support the work of centre, then Rev Anderson can be contacted on 01698 427209.</p>
