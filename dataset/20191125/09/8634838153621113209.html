        <b>During Deputy President William Ruto’s visit at PCEA Makongeni church in Thika on November 24, an unknown woman braved her way to the podium to present her grievances, despite the heavy presence of security personnel attached to the DP.</b>
      </p>
      <p>In a video shared on Facebook, the unprecedented incident saw the woman run from her seat and knell at the DP’s feet where Ruto gave her a hand urging her to stand.</p>
      <p>“You may stand up, I see there is a problem and I will solve it shortly,” Ruto urged the woman.</p>

      <p>The woman went forward to hand over some written documents to Ruto who gladly received them.</p>
      <p>In the video, plainclothes security officers are seen charging towards the woman and attempt to pull her back to her seat before the deputy president orders them to give her a seat next to him</p>
      <p>“Don’t take her to the back, let her stay next to me. The woman has made a lot of effort to brave her way here. We will solve her problems immediately,” urged DP Ruto.</p>
      <p>It only took a few seconds after the woman got a seat next to the second in command for another woman to approach the Dp from the other side of the congregation, also holding some papers.</p>
      <p>The woman’s papers were well received too after which she was whisked away, but with an achievement.</p>
      <p>Earlier on November 24, the deputy president attended a church service at the AIPCA Maguguni church in Thika East. </p>
