      <p>Science and engineering studies took on a delicious twist for students from Woodmans Hill Secondary College and St Patrick's College when the core subject was chocolate.</p>
      <p>Like Charlie in the chocolate factory, 20 students learned all about the chocolate manufacturing process and the work involved in creating a new product during a STEM in Manufacturing Day.</p>
      <p>Mars partnered with Ballarat Tech School to showcase the breadth of careers and pathways in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics fields within food manufacturing.</p>

      <p>While making new chocolate products was a highlight, students learned about manufacturing processes, cutting, weighing, food waste, packaging design, took part in a quality taste test panel and pitched their product to the Mars panel.</p>
      <p>Ballarat Tech School director Sofia Fiusco said Mars employees involved in everything from product research and development to waste management mentored the students as they tested their creativity to come up with innovative new chocolate products.</p>

      <p>"They shared their journeys within Mars so students got an idea of what they learned, what they enjoyed in school and where it led to with a particular focus on engineering and manufacturing," Ms Fiusco said.</p>
      <p>With making new chocolate products on the agenda the event was always going to be popular, especially with the prize being a 'golden ticket' tour of the Mars factory, which was won by a team from Woodmans Hill Secondary College.</p>
