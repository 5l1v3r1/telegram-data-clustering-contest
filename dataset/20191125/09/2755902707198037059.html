        <b>WATCH: This Is Why Zimbabweans Are Crazy</b>
      </p>
      <p>On Saturday morning, <a href="https://iharare.com/vp-chiwenga-back-in-zim-welcomed-by-chinese-ambassador/">Vice President Chiwenga who was being treated in China returned to the country after being absent for 4 months</a>. His arrival was unannounced and <a href="https://www.zimlive.com/2019/11/23/healthy-looking-vice-president-chiwenga-returns-home-after-4-months-in-china/">he was received at Robert Mugabe International Airport by close family members no government officials raising speculations of tensions</a> in the echelons of power in ZANU PF. <a href="https://iharare.com/mnangagwas-spokesperson-clarifies-on-vp-chiwengas-return/">However, this narrative of tensions was proven to be false</a>.</p>
      <p>President Mnangagwa was among the first VIPs to visit Chiwenga at his Chisipite home with the video of the encounter being shared on social media. What excited Zimbabweans was the way Chiwenga, Mnangagwa embraced each other and How First Lady Auxillia Mnangagwa knelt down and greeted the General by his Soko totem.</p>
      <p>Zimbabweans being crazy as they have started making parodies of the whole affair and so far the video below tops the list.</p>

      <p>We now have The Auxilia Mnangagwa Challenge. You wonder what Zimbabweans will think of next.</p>
