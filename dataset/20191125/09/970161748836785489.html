      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/chelsea-fc/">Chelsea</a> chairman Bruce Buck insists Roman Abramovich is as committed to the club as ever and teased the possibility of a big splurge in the next transfer window.</p>
      <p>The Russian billionaire has not been to a home game at Stamford Bridge since 2018 after the British government delayed renewing his visa, with Abramovich opting to withdraw his application entirely.</p>
      <p>There have been suggestions that he is open to selling the club, but Buck says the Chelsea owner is still focused on winning titles and, if their transfer ban is reduced, will look to invest.</p>

      <p>Asked if Chelsea are essentially on hold during Abramovich’s exile, Buck told <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/24/roman-abramovich-no-plan-sell-chelsea-bruce-buck">The Guardian</a>: ‘I understand what you are saying and it is hard to disprove it, except to say: “Let’s see what happens in the next transfer window.”</p>

      <p>‘The point I am making – it’s a glib one – if we go out in the next window and spend a zillion, it’s pretty hard to argue that things are on hold.’</p>
      <p>He continued: ‘In terms of being involved, in looking at new players, talking about whether to extend players’ contracts, do we buy this player, do we sell this player, [Abramovich] was always intimately involved in that from day one and is just as intimately involved now.</p>
      <p>‘He talks to Marina [Granovskaia] – the board member who supervises the football operation – several times a day, every day. Marina has been doing that for seven or eight years; that hasn’t let up or changed at all.’</p>
      <p>With Chelsea unable to make signings in the summer, manager Frank Lampard has instead relied on the club’s thriving academy to strengthen the first team.</p>

      <p>While Abramovich is happy to see so many of the club’s youngsters involved, Buck admits they probably would have brought in several new faces had the transfer ban not been in place.</p>
      <p>He added: ‘The transfer ban has led to more opportunities for the young players. I can’t deny that if there wasn’t a transfer ban we might have splurged out on one or two or three players.</p>

      <p>‘So, yes, it was some of that; it was Frank Lampard, the players that were ready, a whole collection of things that resulted in where we are now. It makes Mr Abramovich very happy, because he is very interested in the academy. I would guess he’s one of the very few owners that have been to lots of academy matches.’</p>
