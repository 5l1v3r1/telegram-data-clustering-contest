      <h1>Paul Merson suggests he’d take Nuno at Arsenal</h1>

        <b>Paul Merson <a href="https://www.skysports.com/">has told Soccer Saturday (broadcast on Sky Sports; 23/11; 13:31)</a> that he is a massive fan of Wolverhampton Wanderers boss Nuno Espirito Santo, and insisted that he would happily have the Portuguese at Arsenal.</b>

      <p>Wolves are flying once again this season. Plenty wondered how they would get on this term. There have been plenty of teams who have struggled in their second season following promotion, particularly if they have exceeded expectations during that first year.</p>

      <p>Plus, Wolves also have a Europa League campaign to factor it. It appeared inevitable that Nuno’s men would find life a lot tougher this time around.</p>
      <p>But Wolves now sit fifth in the Premier League. And they now have one foot in the knockout stages in Europe. And Merson suggested that it is a matter of time before Wolves face a fight to keep Nuno.</p>

      <p>“I like the manager. I think they’re fortunate to have this manager, Wolves,” <a href="https://www.skysports.com/">he told Soccer Saturday</a>. “I don’t mean that disrespectfully. I think he could manage one of the top six teams, no worries at all. I’d take him at Arsenal tomorrow morning.”</p>
      <p>It would be no surprise to see plenty of Arsenal fans agree with Merson. Unai Emery continues to come under serious pressure at the Emirates. They have not won a league game since early October.</p>
      <p>From the outside, it is becoming increasingly difficult to see Emery remaining with the Gunners for much longer.</p>
      <p>But Wolves fans may argue that they cannot see why Nuno would want to leave if Arsenal did come calling in the near future anyway.</p>
