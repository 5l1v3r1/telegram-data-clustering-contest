        <b>Zurich is the most successful city in the world for social and economic inclusivity, according to a new study.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Prosperity &amp; Inclusion City Seal and Awards (PICSA) Index defines inclusive prosperity “as a measure of economic productivity that reflects how far all sectors of the population are empowered to contribute to the economy and share in its benefits”</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.picsaindex.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Creating-an-Inclusive-Prosperity-Cities-Index-final-PICSA-report_Nov2019.pdf">survey</a> is based on criteria such as per-capita GDP, quality of life, as well as the residents’ safety, education, housing, environmental quality, access to healthcare, and to internet.</p>
      <p>“The cities that ranked on the top of the index have demonstrated world-leading projects and policies that have created inclusive urban centres for all their citizens”, said Bruni Lanvin, founder and CEO of D&amp;L Partners, the consulting firm that conducted the survey on behalf of two Basque institutions.</p>
      <p>Zurich scored strongly in all categories, followed by Vienna and Copenhagen in second and third places. Geneva ranks in the 10<sup>th</sup> place.</p>
      <p>Switzerland’s largest city “scored impressively for work, housing, leisure, education, and safety", Lanvin said.</p>
      <p>He added that Zurich is “a modern, global city planning for the future”.</p>

      <p>Only two non-European cities were ranked in the top 10: Taipei, Taiwan and Ottawa, Canada took sixth and eighth place respectively.</p>
      <p>Luxembourg (4), Helsinki (5), Oslo (7), and Kiel (9) are the other European towns that made it to the top 10. Paris is in the 32<sup>nd</sup> place, followed by London in the 33<sup>rd</sup>.</p>
      <p>Rome, Turin, and Krakow have the lowest rating among cities in Europe. </p>
      <p>Globally, two Chinese metropolises, Tianjin and Chongqing, as well as Egypt’s Cairo scored the lowest.</p>
