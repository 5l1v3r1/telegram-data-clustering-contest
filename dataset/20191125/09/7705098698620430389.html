      <p>Back in 1966, <a href="http://www.superherohype.com/tag/ultraman">Ultraman</a> became one of Japan’s most prominent superheroes. For over 50 years, various incarnations of Ultraman have lived on TV, manga, and video  games. But now, Ultraman is coming to Marvel with brand new stories in 2020.</p>
      <p>Via <a href="https://www.marvel.com/articles/comics/all-new-ultraman-stories-to-arrive-in-2020?linkId=77551342">Marvel.com</a>, Tsuburaya Productions and Marvel will team up for Ultraman comics and graphic novels. According to the announcement, the new comics will also “expand that iconic era of the Ultras through the lens of Marvel’s art and storytelling.”</p>
      <p>“Ultraman has brought together some of the most passionate fandoms in pop culture today, and we can’t wait to bring his story to even more fans around the globe,” said Marvel’s Editor-in-Chief, C.B. Cebulski. “Like Marvel, Ultraman captivated generations by telling spectacular stories grounded in the real world, and it continues to be a beloved classic through its television shows, movies, toys, games, comics, and more. We are so thrilled to introduce new chapters to the Ultraman Multiverse next year.”</p>
