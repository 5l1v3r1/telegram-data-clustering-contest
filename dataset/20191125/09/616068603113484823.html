      <p>Heavy snow is falling on Highway 3 in Manning Park, with Environment Canada issuing a snowfall warning for the area Monday morning.</p>
      <p>A total of 15 to 25 centimetres is expected to fall on the Allison Pass as several bands of moisture move over the area.</p>
      <p>“Between these bands the snow will taper off. Periods of heavy snow are expected on and off through today and tonight,” the weather alert states. </p>
      <p>As of 8 a.m., nine centimetres of snow had already fallen at Allison Pass. </p>
      <p>“Prepare for quickly changing and deteriorating travel conditions,” Environment Canada says. “Rapidly accumulating snow could make travel difficult over some locations.</p>
