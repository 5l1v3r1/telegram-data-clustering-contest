      <h1>The only six Welsh rugby clubs who admit paying players as WRU urge teams to shop rivals to HMRC</h1>
      <h2>Clubs must annually complete the ‘Statement of Truth’</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T09:55:20+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 09:55</time> by <a rel="author">Anthony Woolford</a></address>
      <p>Welsh Rugby Union chiefs have reminded clubs over making illegal payments to players after revealing six sides have opted out of signing their 'Statement of Truth' this season.</p>
      <p>Clubs must annually complete the ‘Statement of Truth’ form to receive funding from the Union and in a letter circulated to clubs from John Howells, the WRU Group business and commercial development manager, named the clubs who have chosen not to sign up.</p>
      <p>The letter said: "If a member club decides that it wishes to pay its players for the forthcoming season, the club does not need to complete the Statement of Truth.</p>
      <p>"However, failure to complete the Statement of Truth will result in the forfeiture of the core grant element.</p>
      <p>"Any club that decides to pay its players must notify the WRU of its intention to pay players and confirm to the WRU of its compliance, in full, with all PAYE and other tax obligations."</p>
      <p>"I’d like to update you on the clubs that informed us they would not be signing the said document.</p>
      <p>"The clubs informing the Welsh Rugby Union Group of their intent to not sign the Statement of Truth for season 2019/2020, and thus, relinquishing their eligibility to receive the core grant payment are: Blackwood; Brecon; Glamorgan Wanderers; Narberth; Newbridge and Tata Steel (Port Talbot)."</p>
      <p>Five of the six opted out of signing the statement last season with the new club in 2019-20 being Brecon.</p>
      <p>Clubs who hold an A licence are exempt from signing the document meaning Indigo Premiership outfits and some leading Championship sides are not governed by the ruling.</p>
      <p>And the WRU have told clubs to report rivals who receive Union funding but they suspect of paying players to HMRC.</p>
      <p>"The Welsh Rugby Union is committed to ensuring that the Payment to Players policy is promoted and adhered with, so that players in the community game are not paid to play rugby, either directly or indirectly," the letter added.</p>
      <p>"The WRU actively promotes a non-paying policy in the Community game in Wales, and where required will impose conditions on any funding that it provides to its member clubs.</p>
      <p>"The WRU is keen to incentivise a club that complies with the Payment to Players policy by awarding funding through a rugby grant.</p>
      <p>"If in the event a Member Club has suspicion of another club not adhering to this act, then the club should report any suspicions they have around the payment to players directly to HMRC.</p>
      <p>"I need to advise that in 2018, HMRC performed extensive negotiations on the tax affairs and improper payment to players at sports clubs in English Rugby.</p>
      <p>"In addition to the 2018 investigation, HMRC has recently contacted the WRU regarding PAYE arrangements and has further met with several WRU member clubs to discuss these obligations.</p>
      <p>"When players register online, they are reminded of their obligations in relation to the Payment to Players policy, which forms part of the Player Registration and Transfer Regulations.</p>
      <p>"Any breaches of this policy will lead to disciplinary proceedings being commenced in accordance with the WRU Disciplinary Regulations."</p>
