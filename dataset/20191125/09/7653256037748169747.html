      <p>Pune: <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/World-Wide-Technology">World Wide Technology</a> (<a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/WWT">WWT</a>), a US-headquartered technology solutions provider and systems integrator, is strengthening its India presence following the launch of a new global integration centre in the country.</p>
      <p>The $11 billion company has increased its headcount to 60 from 20 people a year ago and would continue to invest in its local operations, Matt Horner, SVP, <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Global-Enterprise-Sales">Global Enterprise Sales</a>, WWT told ET.</p>
      <p>“We will continue to grow with our operations and intend to grow to twice the current size in the next 12-18 months,” he said.</p>
      <p>The new centre will provide application development and testing services to other companies. Additionally, the India centre also offers support to WWT’s global customers, said Horner. “We are also developing new tech solutions which help build applications in a pre-production scenario,” he added.</p>
      <p>WWT is the largest global partner to Cisco, providing solutions for network, employee experience and collaboration. This is another important avenue of growth for WWT in India. “There are only three-four Cisco solution providers here as opposed to dozens in the US,” said Horner. India, he said, is a very attractive market for the company. Cloud providers are another segment where it’s seeing significant growth, apart from pharmaceuticals and manufacturing.</p>
      <p>Globally, WWT works primarily with the top 1,000 enterprises. In India too, it has been working with large tech integrators, said Horner.</p>
