      <p>OSLO, Nov 25 — Norway’s sovereign wealth fund and property investment group Prologis Inc have agreed to jointly buy a US$1.99 billion logistics real estate portfolio, Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM) said in a statement.</p>
      <p>“The portfolio consists of 127 properties located across multiple US markets, including Southern California, San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle and Dallas,” it added.</p>
      <p>NBIM, which manages the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund with assets of some US$1.1 trillion, paid US$896 million for a 45 per cent stake in the portfolio, while Prologis will own the remaining 55 per cent and manage the properties.</p>
      <p>The Norwegian fund invests in foreign bonds, stocks and real estate.</p>
      <p>In real estate, it concentrates on two types of investment: logistics centres near major cities which benefit from the growth in online shopping, and office buildings in the centre of major cities such as New York, Tokyo, London and Paris.</p>
      <p>The acquisition is part of Prologis Inc’s merger agreement to acquire Industrial Property Trust, Inc, NBIM added. — Reuters</p>
