      <p>Their 7-0 triumph on Saturday was the Island club’s biggest win of the campaign so far, as they batted their mid-table rivals aside with ease at Springfield.</p>
      <p>Campbell admitted it was a stroll for the hosts as they maintained their 100% record with their 16th consecutive league win, but when asked if the Bulls could win every game this season, the defender said: ‘We haven’t played everyone yet, so it is hard to say. We will just take every game as it comes and go from there.</p>
      <p>‘For me it is eight or nine goals now, which is a lot more than I expected.</p>
      <p>‘It was a stroll. I wasn’t sure if they had lads missing, because we expected a tougher test.</p>
      <p>‘We said at half time not to get complacent and we didn’t – we kept going and got a few more.</p>
      <p>‘And credit to the boys who came in, we have a big and quality squad and it was good for them to come in and do well.’</p>
      <p>Following a minute’s silence in memory of former Muratti captain Mo Vowden, who passed away on Friday, Harry Cardwell fired in an early warning shot before the Bulls got themselves in front on seven minutes.</p>
      <p>A defence-splitting pass from Jake Baker with the outside of his boot found Daryl Wilson, who touched it around visiting goalkeeper Craig Atkinson and fired into the roof of the net.</p>
      <p>Jay Giles and Campbell both converted penalties, with Cardwell, Jules Gabbiadini, Ruben Mendes and Baker also finding the net.</p>
