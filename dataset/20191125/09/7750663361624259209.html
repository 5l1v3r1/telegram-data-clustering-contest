      <h1>Wolverhampton Wanderers showing interest in Southampton's Cedric Soares?</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/wolves/"><b>Wolverhampton Wanderers</b></a> have reportedly identified <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/southampton/"><b>Southampton</b></a> defender <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/cedric-soares/"><b>Cedric Soares</b></a> as a potential January signing.</h2>

      <p>While the West Midlands outfit are well stocked for options at wing-back, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/nuno-espirito-santo/"><b>Nuno Espirito Santo</b></a> has recently moved <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/adama-traore/"><b>Adama Traore</b></a> further up the pitch due to a change in formation.</p>
      <p>With that in mind, it appears that Wolves may look to bring in a defensive player in that area at the midway point of the campaign.</p>
      <p>According to <i>TEAMtalk</i>, there is an interest in Soares, who has less than a year remaining on his contract at St Mary's.</p>
      <p>The report adds that the 28-year-old has already indicated that he wishes to leave the Saints, which could lead to the south-coast side cashing in on his services at the beginning of 2020.</p>
      <p>The Portugal international has made seven starts in all competitions this season.</p>
