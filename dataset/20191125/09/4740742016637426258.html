      <h1>North Somerset nurseries more likely to be rated outstanding than Bristol's</h1>
      <h2>But all three local authorities were above the average for England</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T09:18:06+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 09:18</time> by <a rel="author">Emma Flanagan, Claire Miller</a></address>
      <p>Childminders and nurseries in Bristol are less likely to be rated as outstanding, compared to both South Gloucestershire and North Somerset.</p>
      <p>According to the latest data on Ofsted inspections a fifth of early years childcare providers in Bristol (19.9 per cent) were rated as outstanding at the end of August. This is down from 2018 when 25.5 per cent of childcare providers in Bristol were rated as outstanding.</p>
      <p>While childcare providers in <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/north-somerset">North Somerset</a> were among the most likely in England to be rated as outstanding at 30 per cent, with 21.1 per cent rated as outstanding in <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/south-gloucestershire">South Gloucestershire</a>.</p>
      <p>But all three local authorities were above the average for England, as 19.8 per cent of childcare providers across the country are rated outstanding.</p>
      <p>There were no providers rated as inadequate in Bristol at the end of August, down from two a year before.</p>
      <p>The number of childminders in Bristol has dropped by 15 per cent since 2015, when Ofstedâ€™s figures begin.</p>
      <p>At the end of August 2015, there were 442 childminders registered in the local authority area. By 2019, that had fallen to 377.</p>

      <p>However, the number of childcare places available has risen by two-fifths over the same period - up from 7,680 to 10,811 - due to an increase in places in childcare on non-domestic premises.</p>
      <p>Childcare on non-domestic premises includes nurseries, pre-schools, holiday clubs and other group-based settings.</p>
      <p>However, it does not include early years provision in schools, for children aged two and up, which is inspected as part of the overall rating for the school.</p>
