      <p>Turkish F-16 warplanes will fly over the country's capital Ankara on Monday to test its new Russian S-400 missile defenses, Turkish media said, despite pressure from Washington for Turkey to drop the system.<br/><br/>Ankara's purchase of the S-400s and its subsequent delivery in July has been a major source of friction with the United States, which says the system is not compatible with NATO defenses and poses a threat to Lockheed Martin's F-35 stealth fighter jets.<br/><br/>The provincial governor's office announced on Sunday that the Turkish Air Force F-16s and other aircraft will conduct low- and high-altitude flights over Ankara on Monday and Tuesday to test an air defense system project.<br/><br/>Broadcaster CNN Turk and other media said specifically that the flights were to test the S-400 radar system. <br/><br/>Dealers said the reports had a negative impact on the lira, which weakened to 5.7380 against the dollar from a close of 5.7140 on Friday. <br/><br/>Tensions in US-Turkish relations played a major role in a near 30 percent slide in the lira's value last year.<br/><br/>As recently as last Thursday, a senior State Department official told reporters Turkey needed to "get rid of" the system. Those comments came after President Tayyip Erdogan met US President Donald Trump at the White House.<br/><br/>Trump said afterwards that Turkey's controversial acquisition created "serious challenges" for Washington as he added officials would "immediately" get to work on resolving the issue. <br/><br/>Washington has suspended Turkey from the F-35 program, which it was a buyer and producer of, to punish it for the S-400 purchase. It has warned of possible US sanctions over the deal but has not yet imposed them.<br/><br/>Trump has told Erdogan that Washington is ready to sell Ankara US Patriot systems if it drops the Russian system.</p>
