The Bronx, New York producer, MC, and DJ and the Brooklyn, New York MC, entrepreneur, and show host have some history together, including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7dyxsBd_AI">“The Truth”</a> on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/4tAVbKbYeZ4fJ3jT5i3LQS?si=Y56t5V_pR1q1iIgB2fYuHA">Pharoahe Monch’s <i>Internal Affairs</i></a>, which also had Common as a guest.

      <p>This morning (November 25), Diamond confirmed with <i>Ambrosia For Heads</i> that he and Kweli are creating a collaborative project. Revealing that the two are already eight songs deep, the D.I.T.C. veteran shared a two-minute video that shows Talib listening to the playback of one of the tracks. It features Kweli using wordplay to big up Diggin’ In The Crates.</p>
