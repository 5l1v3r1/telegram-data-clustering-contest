        <b>T.I. has now backtracked on his controversial admission that he takes his daughter Deyjah to the doctor to have her hymen checked, claiming he ‘exaggerated’ the story.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 39-year-old, real name Clifford Harris Jr, sparked outrage when he said that he took his 18-year-old daughter to the gynaecologist every year to check whether her hymen was still intact.</p>
      <p>It was his way of making sure Deyjah hadn’t had sex.</p>
      <p>But in his new Red Table Talk interview with Jada Pinkett Smith, T.I. says his words were ‘misconstrued’.</p>
      <p>‘I came to clear up any misconceptions there have been surrounding how we parent and what is appropriate and inappropriate,’ T.I. explained to Jada, Willow Smith and Adrienne Banfield-Jones.</p>
      <p>‘I think all of this comes from a conversation I was having in a very joking manner when asked how I deal with parenting in this day and age.’</p>

      <p>The Live Your Life rapper continued: ‘From a place of truth, I began to embellish and exaggerate and I think a lot of people took it extremely literal because if you put any of my reputation, who I am as a father, who I’ve been, I honestly thought people knew me better than that.’</p>

      <p>When asked he is understood the sensitivity towards the issue, T.I. replied: ‘No, I did not. I understand it now, absolutely.’</p>
      <p>‘However, I think my intentions have been terribly misconstrued and misconceived.’</p>
      <p>According to T.I., he was not present in the exam room and has not taken Deyjah to the doctor since she was 18 – his wife Tiny Harris who was also in the interview, stated she was 15 and 16.</p>
      <p>‘Let me set this record straight. I never said I was in any exam room, that was an assumption. That is a falsity. I never said it was being done present day as an 18 year old,’ he stated.</p>
      <p>‘I never said that her mother wasn’t present. She was present every time. All of this false narrative has just been sensationalised.’</p>
      <p>Addressing Deyjah’s feelings about the check-ups, T.I. continued: ‘There was never any objection. She did have a problem with me talking about it, however, and I understand that. And I am incredibly apologetic to her for that.</p>
      <p>‘Not to any of these other strangers, or any other weirdos who just tossed lies around for fun.</p>

      <p>‘She understands my intentions, who I am and who I’ve always been.’</p>
