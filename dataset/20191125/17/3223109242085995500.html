      <h1>Watch: Stormtroopers ‘Fly’ in New ‘Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker’ Clip</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T17:00:02+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 17:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.geek.com/author/genevieve_scarano/" target="_blank">Genevieve Scarano</a></address>
      <p>Rey and the gang are fleeing from a group of “high-tech” stormtroopers in a new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCPiBWrIaSI"><i>Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</i> clip</a>.</p>
      <p>When Rey, Poe, Finn, C-3PO, Chewbacca, and BB-8 are on the run in the desert, a bunch of stormtroopers detect the “fugitives,” and they immediately go after them. This time, the squad of stormtroopers has jetpacks…and that could be a MAJOR problem for <a href="https://www.geek.com/movies/whats-next-for-star-wars-after-the-rise-of-skywalker-1811582/">Rey &amp; Co.</a></p>

      <p>“Oh, they fly now!” C-3PO yells to the group in the thrilling, yet hilarious footage.</p>
      <p>Finn turns to Poe and unbelievingly asks him “They fly now?!”</p>
      <p>Poe also looks concerned and replies “They fly now!”</p>
      <p>It’s unclear if Rey and her friends escape from the “flying” stormtroopers, but hopefully, they figure out a plan and leave the area ASAP.</p>
