      <h3>Donald Trump Takes Lying To ‘New’ And ‘Very Complex’ Scale In Ukraine Scandal, Says Biographer</h3>

      <p>The impeachment probe into <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a> continues to shed light on his alleged pressure campaign on <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/ukraine/">Ukraine</a>. The president is accused of using foreign aid as leverage to push the country to dig up dirt on his Democratic rival, <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/joe-biden/">Joe Biden</a>, and <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/5752579/donald-trump-quid-pro-quo-gordon-sondland-giuliani/">testimony thus far</a> has suggested that many in Trump’s orbit were aware of the purported plan.</p>
      <p>According to Trump biographer Michael D’Antonio, an important part of the Ukraine scandal is the president’s lying, <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-biographer-ukraine-scandal-lies-1473834?utm_campaign=NewsweekTwitter&amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_source=Twitter"><i>Newsweek</i></a> reports.</p>
      <p>“We’re seeing lying at a scale that is somewhat new and is very complex,” he said in a CNN special report titled <i>All The President’s Lies</i>.</p>
      <p>D’Antonio noted that Trump looks to others for hints when it comes to making decisions, pointing to his co-opting of the theory that Ukraine — not Russia — interfered in the 2016 election.</p>
      <blockquote>“He looks for hints from others. ‘Oh, Ukraine was to blame for interfering in the 2016 election, not Russia.’ This is all crazy talk and all of it is a lie.”</blockquote>
      <p>CNN commentator and historian Douglas Brinkley echoed D’Antonio’s statements and suggested Trump is unique as a president due to his ability to lie “as if it were a form of breathing” — a habit he believes “diminishes” Trump’s “credibility.”</p>

      <p>Trump has frequently taken heat for his false or misleading claims. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/22/politics/fact-check-trump-fox-and-friends-november/index.html"><i>CNN</i></a> reports that Trump’s <i>Fox &amp; Friends</i> rant on Friday contained “at least 18 false claims.” Although the show’s co-hosts pushed back somewhat on some of the claims Trump made, he appeared to avoid questions that probed the accuracy of his comments.</p>
      <p>At one point during the call, Trump suggested that House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff was the whistleblower, which CNN called “simple nonsense.”</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/20/20974999/trump-is-lying-about-the-new-apple-factory"><i>The Verge</i></a> reports that Trump isn’t just lying about things relating to the impeachment inquiry either. Recently he took a tour of a purported Apple factory and lied when describing his support for the company.</p>
      <p>“We’re seeing the beginning of a very powerful and important plant. Anybody that followed my campaign, I would always talk about Apple, that I want to see Apple building plants in the United States,” Trump said at his factory tour.</p>
      <p>According to <i>The Verge</i>, the factory isn’t new and it doesn’t belong to Apple. The plant is owned by a contractor called Flex Ltd that has been making Mac Pros since 2013. In addition, the report notes that Apple is not building a manufacturing plant but a new Austin campus with jobs more aligned with white-collar design and engineering work.</p>
      <p>Although <i>The Verge</i> noted that there is a debate over whether politicians are technically lying when they make false statements or are just merely unaware of their inaccuracy, the report suggested Trump knew he was being untruthful.</p>
