      <h1>Miami Insider Has Update On Hurricanes QB Tate Martell</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T17:25:28+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 17:25</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/alekarend" target="_blank">Alek Arend</a></address>
      <p>Tate Martell’s collegiate journey has been a whirlwind, almost to the point of disaster. The quarterback was absent from the Hurricanes’ contest against FIU on Saturday. Speculation was brewing that Martell might have left the team.</p>
      <p>But <a href="https://thespun.com/college-football/tate-martell-is-not-at-miamis-game-tonight">according to the latest report</a>, the Miami QB remains on the roster. Yet, there’s still the possibility Martell is moving on from the Hurricanes.</p>
      <blockquote>“Tate Martell remains on UM roster at this moment, but that is fluid,” <a href="https://twitter.com/flasportsbuzz/status/1198997040925163520?s=21">Barry Jackson of the Miami Herald said</a>. “One player said he has left briefly multiple times this year, and Enos has said he’s going through stuff. Not at game Saturday.”</blockquote>

      <p>It looks like Martell is going through some personal matters. But the question remains – has the Miami QB played his last game in a Hurricanes uniform?</p>
      <p>Martell has moved on before. The dynamic athlete started his collegiate career with Ohio State. But as he slipped down the depth chart, Martell wanted a new start elsewhere.</p>
      <p>Miami appeared to be a perfect fit as the Hurricanes started to slip back into national relevance in 2017. But things haven’t gone Martell’s way as he once again struggled to earn first-team reps, sparking an eventual position change to receiver.</p>
      <p>That position change didn’t bring the anticipated results, as a move back to QB came just a few weeks ago.</p>
      <p>Are Martell’s days at Miami over? Or will the dual-threat QB remain with the Hurricanes? Looks like this new chapter of Martell’s career is just getting started.</p>
