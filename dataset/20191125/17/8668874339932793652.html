      <h1>Huw Jones might not be heading to the Stormers after all</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T17:36:35+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 17:36</time> by <a rel="author">Online Editors</a></address>
      <p>Reports of a possible ‘influx’ of international stars to the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/stormers">Stormers</a> has been greatly exaggerated – report <a href="https://rugby365.com/tournaments/super-rugby/news-super-rugby/media-jumped-the-gun-on-stars-move-to-stormers">Rugby 365</a>.</p>
      <p>Weekend media reports suggested that Scottish centre <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/glasgow/players/huw-jones/">Huw Jones</a> would like to seal a ‘short-term’ move back to the Stormers.</p>
      <p>The report, by Netwerk24, follows last week’s media briefing when new Stormers coach John Dobson said midfield is one of two ‘flash points’ for the Cape Town-based franchise.</p>
      <p>The 25-year-old Jones, who played a combined 50-odd matches for the Stormers and Western Province, has reportedly had a fall-out with <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/glasgow">Glasgow</a> Warriors’ Australia-bound coach Dave Rennie and wants to move to the English Premiership.</p>
      <p>In the interim, he reportedly wanted to return to the Stormers and play <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby">Super Rugby</a> next year.</p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>However, Jones’ agent Dane Galley denied the report.</p>
      <p>“Huw is not coming back to South Africa,” Galley told<i> Rugby 365’s</i> Jan de Konig, when asked for comment. “Whoever wrote that article jumped the gun.”</p>
      <p>He also poured cold water on the suggestion that Jones is leaving the Scottish franchise.</p>
      <p>“He is contracted to Glasgow for this season and next,” Galley added.</p>

      <p>Jones, who surprisingly failed to make Scotland’s World Cup squad, was born in Leith, Edinburgh, and schooled at Millfield in Somerset.</p>
      <p>After school he moved to Cape Town for a ‘gap year’ and played club rugby for False Bay in 2013. He followed the False Bay coach Kevin Musikanth to the University of Cape Town the next year and played for the Ikey Tigers Varsity Cup side and was a member of the team that famously came from behind to beat NWU Pukke in sensational fashion in the Final in Potchefstroom.</p>
      <p>He made his <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/currie-cup/teams/western-province">Western Province</a> debut in 2014 and was included in the Stormers squad in 2015.</p>

      <p>Jones was called up by <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/scotland">Scotland</a> in 2016 and moved to Glasgow in 2017 – making 17 appearances for the Test team, before this year’s shock axing.</p>
      <p>The Warriors star is not the only midfielder linked to a move to Cape Town – with Netwerk24 also suggesting that British &amp; Irish <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/lions">Lions</a> centre <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/bath/players/jamie-roberts/">Jamie Roberts</a> has also expressed interest in a move to Newlands for the 2020 <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby">Super Rugby</a> season.</p>
      <p>The 33-year-old is believed to want to stay in top fitness to stand a chance of being a part of the 2021 Lions tour to South Africa.</p>
      <p>However, given the dire financial situation at Newlands, it is unlikely the move – if rumours are true – would ever materialise.</p>
