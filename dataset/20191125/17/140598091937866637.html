      <h1>Rugby World Cup player says man he rescued from burning building ran away without saying thanks</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T17:19:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 17:19</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/telegraph-reporters/" target="_blank">Telegraph Reporters</a></address>
      <p>An international rugby player rescued a man from a burning building, who then ran away.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rugby-union/2019/03/13/gordon-reid-scotland-remember-embarrassed-twickenham-2017/">Prop Gordon Reid</a>, 32, pulled the man from a house in the village of Coylton, South Ayrshire, early on Sunday morning.</p>
      <p>The Scotland international, who featured at the rugby world cup in Japan, later posted on Twitter: "I am really angry because I put my life at risk."</p>
      <p>Police confirmed they believe the fire was started deliberately and have launched an investigation.</p>
      <p>Reid dialled 999 before breaking into the house. Firefighters arrived and put out the blaze, while also giving oxygen treatment to Reid, who had suffered from smoke inhalation.</p>
      <p>The rugby player said on Twitter: "Just a normal day. Wake up, have breakfast, save a guy's life by pulling him out of his house, which was on fire.</p>
      <p>"Then the p---- ran off - didn't even say thanks.</p>
      <p>"Now am stuck here sucking on air. Thanks to the firemen for the back up."</p>

      <p>Describing how he pulled the man from the building, he said: "I smashed in the back door and crawled through a broken panel and saw the man half sitting and half lying down.</p>
      <p>"He was coughing and spluttering from the thickening smoke and seemed in a bad way.</p>
      <p>"I grabbed him round his chest and hauled him outside - his face was black, like a miner in the old days."</p>
      <p>Police Scotland stated: "The fire is believed to have been started deliberately and inquiries are now ongoing."</p>
      <p>A Scottish Fire and Rescue Service spokesman said: "We were alerted at 9.57am on Sunday to reports of a fire at a property at Hillhead, Coylton.</p>
      <p>"Operations Control mobilised two fire appliances to the scene, where crews extinguished a fire within the single-storey property.</p>
      <p>"Firefighters administered oxygen therapy to one casualty who had assisted another member of the public at the scene.</p>
      <p>"Crews left after ensuring the area was made safe."</p>
      <p>Reid currently plays for the newly-established semi-pro team Ayrshire Bulls, who compete in the Super6 league.</p>
      <p>He previously starred for Glasgow Warriors, London Irish and has 37 Scotland caps.</p>
