        <b>Paras Chhabra gets the whip from Shefali Jariwala's husband Parag Tyagi for linking her up with Asim Riaz inside Bigg Boss 13 house</b>
      </p>
      <p>Parag Tyagi has risen in defence to condemn Paras Chhabra for linking up his wife Shefali Jariwala with Asim. SpotboyE.com had a long chat with Parag this evening around 8 pm. Parag was rather unwell, but just one or two questions into out chat- he laid out his hurt. At no stage did Parag raise his voice, the man is rather dignified.Â </p>
      <p>Excerpts:</p>
      <p>
        <b>Felt bizarre when Paras linked up your wife with Asim Riaz...</b>
      </p>
      <p>Anybody sensible will feel bizarre. Character assassination karna is the easiest thing to do.</p>
      <p>Shefali is my wife and I am very hurt by whatever Paras said. I can say the same for Mahira Sharma and him, but will I? No, I won't. I am not that type of man to start doubting every second person who gets along with the opposite sex.</p>
      <p>Imagine we did a show together. We had become friends. He refers to me as a brother in the show. And this is what he does!</p>
      <p>In fact, he has character-assassinated many others on the show.</p>
      <p>I really pity him, especially when I see the way he's trying so hard to get close to every girl. Except Mahira nobody is giving him time and attention.</p>
      <p><b>He has a steady girlfriend...<br/></b>Yes, I know you're talking about Akanksha Puri who else! I feel sorry for her. Kya beet rahi hogi uspe?</p>

      <p><b>But she told us that he has a script, like I guess she meant, strategy. Or, is it that she's maintaining a brave front?<br/></b>I really don't know much about her. I think Paras usko kuch cheezen rata kar gaya hai, woh wahi cheezi baar baar repeat karti rehti hai.</p>

        <b>Do you know he ridiculed his ex, Pavitra Punia?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Yes, I heard about that. Doesn't he know that har ladki ki ek izzat hoti hai?</p>
      <p>Anyway, thank God I got to know Paras' true colours soon.</p>

      <p><b>Will you confront him when you meet him?<br/></b>Of course. I am Shefali's husband and it's my duty. Above all, as I said, I am very hurt- but yes, initially I was angry too.</p>

        <b>What does this attack on Shefali speak about Paras?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Every man is known by his character. I think I have answered your question.</p>
      <p>Seriously, bhagwan usko buddhi de. He can go to any extent. Gandagi phaila raha hai. Even Salman has criticised him. I don't think he'll go too far in the game.<br/><br/><br/><i>Image Source:- instagram/paragtyagi/</i><i>shefalijariwala/colorstv/voot/</i><i>newsjizz/headlinez/</i></p>
