      <p>Nov. 25 (UPI) -- The U.S. <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/supreme-court/?tps=1">Supreme Court</a> declined Monday to consider an appeal for a new trial sought by <i>Serial</i> podcast subject Adnan Syed, who is serving a life sentence for the 1999 slaying of a former girlfriend.</p>
      <p>The Supreme Court's <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/supreme-court-denies-appeal-trial-serial-podcast-case/story?id=67293061">decision</a> not to take up Syed's appeal means a Maryland appellate court's decision in March denying him a new trial will stand.</p>
      <p>The high court issued no explanation for <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/11/25/782575176/u-s-supreme-court-wont-hear-adnan-syed-s-appeal-keeping-serial-subject-in-prison">its decision Monday</a>.</p>
      <p>In 2000, a jury convicted Syed of the murder of 18-year-old former girlfriend Hae Min Lee. The case drew national attention in 2014 when it became the subject of the podcast <i>Serial</i>, hosted by Sarah Koenig.</p>
      <p>The case against Syed seemed to reach a turning point in March 2018 when the Maryland Court of Special Appeals voted 2-1 for a new trial. It said his first lawyer, Cristina Gutierrez, provided insufficient counsel by failing to call an alibi witness at trial.</p>
      <p>The Maryland Court of Appeals, the state's highest court, <a href="https://www.courts.state.md.us/data/opinions/coa/2019/24a18.pdf">ruled 4-3</a> in March that Syed was not entitled to a new trial -- finding that although his counsel was deficient, it did not result in any prejudice.</p>
