      <h1>Best Help to Buy ISAs - last chance for savers to get £3,000 Government bonus</h1>
      <h2>If you open a tax-free Help to Buy ISA, the government will chip in an extra 25% of what you stash away - but the account is closing to new savers on November, 30. If you want to take advantage, these are the best accounts online and in branch</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T17:41:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 17:41</time> by <a rel="author">Emma Munbodh, https://www.facebook.com/EmmaMunbodh</a></address>
      <p>The clock is ticking for savers to open a Help to Buy ISA account for a <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/martin-lewis-warns-open-help-20765418">£3,000 Government bonus on their first home</a> anywhere in the UK.</p>
      <p>Anyone over the age of 16 can apply for one - but you only have until Saturday, November 30, when the scheme closes to new savers for good.</p>
      <p>The account allows you to save up to £200 a month, after an initial deposit of up to £1,200 - but you can open one with just £1.</p>
      <p>And you can earn interest on top - with banks offering up to 3% a year on the cash you stash, on top of the 25% state reward.</p>
      <p>Once you've then built up £1,600 savings, you can cash the money in, apply for the bonus, and then use it to buy a home worth up to £250,000 across the UK, or £450,000 in London.</p>

      <p>This money can be put towards your deposit or legal fees for your first home - but you won't actually 'see' the reward. Your solicitor will have to apply for it around 30 days before completion - in other words, they'll have to unlock the bonus on your behalf.</p>
      <p>Help to Buy ISAs will be on sale until November 30, 2019. If you've opened one before then, you can keep it running until 1 December 2030.</p>

      <p>You can open a Help to Buy ISA account with most well-known high street banks and lenders but the right one for you will depend on the accounts you’re eligible for, what you need and even where you live.</p>
      <p>Bear in mind it's also not just the big banks that offer them - regional building societies and even some credit unions have Help to Buy ISA options.</p>
      <p>It's important to look at details such as the rate of interest you can earn and how flexible the Help to Buy ISA is.</p>
      <p>Right now, Help to Buy ISA accounts can generate interest at a rate of between 2.5% and 3%, although this could change at any time.</p>
      <p>You won’t earn interest on your government bonus because you don’t actually get the money until you buy your property.</p>
