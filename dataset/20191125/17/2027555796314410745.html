      <h1>Sri Lanka's top investigator flees to Geneva</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T17:05:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 17:05</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/pti" target="_blank">PTI</a></address>
      <p>A Sri Lankan police officer, who handled the top-level investigations against the members of the previous Rajapaksa government between 2005 and 2015, has fled to Geneva following a regime change here.</p>
      <p>A statement from the police headquarters said that investigations as to how Inspector Nishantha Silva left the country on Sunday without obtaining formal approval are underway.</p>
      <p>Silva was the top sleuth in many corruption and other investigations against members of the Rajapaksa family and top officials since 2015.</p>
      <p>Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who was elected the country's new president after the November 16 polls, told a gathering yesterday that the chief investigator in all politically-motivated investigations against them had fled the country.</p>
      <p>Sri Lanka's controversial Rajapaksa clan tightened its grip on political power after President Gotabhaya Rajapaksa swore-in his elder brother Mahinda as the prime minister.</p>
      <p>Silva is thought have to flee the country fearing reprisals from the new regime.</p>
      <p>"All police officers when leaving the country must obtain approval from the ministry secretary. This officer has not done so," the police statement said.</p>
      <p>It said that Silva’s "bias conduct" in carrying out investigations has been highlighted and many parties have asked for investigation against him.</p>
      <p>The current government when in the Opposition had charged that all investigations carried out by Silva were politically-motivated.</p>
      <p>Police Headquarters instructed the CID Director to immediately conduct an investigation and report back, News 1st reported.</p>
      <p>Citing Silva’s overseas travel as a breach of Police discipline, SSP Ruwan Gunasekera said disciplinary action will also be instituted against him, it reported.</p>
      <p>Shani Abeysekera, the most reputed official in the police’s criminal investigations department, was also transferred from the capital to the southern province. </p>
