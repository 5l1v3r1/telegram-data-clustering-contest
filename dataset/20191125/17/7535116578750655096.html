      <p>At the same time, IU, another K-pop artist who was close to both Sulli and Goo Hara, was performing at her Day 2 concert in Seoul when she heard the news. Fans who were present at the concert said that halfway through the concert, IU<a href="https://twitter.com/calicocatxxx/status/1198870694819315713"> broke down and cried</a>.</p>
      <p>Videos and pictures of the event do not exist as the fansites are working very hard to keep them from being spread out.</p>
      <p>On Day 1 of her concert, IU dedicated a special song towards the late Sulli, whom she was friends with as well. If thatâ€™s not enough, IU was also very tight with the late Jonghyun of Shinee, who passed away in 2017.</p>

      <p>This is definitely a really tough time for IU, and her fans are worried about her as she lost 3 best friends in the short span of 2 years. So, they are now collectively sending her positive messages to make sure that she feels loved and stays strong. She hasnâ€™t made any postings on social media as of the time of writing.</p>
