      <h1>Week 13 Fantasy WR Rankings: DeAndre Hopkins, Amari Cooper among matchup worries</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T17:21:11+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 17:21</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Lutovsky</a></address>
      <p>The fantasy football playoffs are right around the corner, so what better time to have a stacked set of fantasy WR rankings? Week 13 should hopefully see the returns of several key injured wide receivers (Adam Thielen, JuJu Smith-Schuster, Alshon Jeffery, Tyreek Hill),but obviously we won't know for sure until the games kick off. At this point in the season, you can't take anything for granted, and every start-or-sit decision should be scrutinized.</p>
      <p>This week, that even includes DeAndre Hopkins (vs. Patriots) and Amari Cooper (vs. Bills). Cooper, who's clearly not 100 percent, was held without a catch in Week 12 by Stephon Gilmore and the Patriots. The wet weather didn't help, but Cooper has now turned in two duds in a row and gets Tre'Davious White, who just shut down Courtland Sutton. Hopkins faces Gilmore this week, and while it's always tough to sit one of football's best receivers when he's fully healthy, New England's numbers speak for themselves. Golden Tate is the only WR to catch a touchdown or top 78 receiving yards against the Pats this year. JuJu Smith-Schuster (6-78, aided by garbage time), Terry McLaurin (3-51), Odell Beckham Jr. (5-52), Jarvis Landry (5-65), Hollywood Brown (3-48), and Cooper have all been held in check. However, Hopkins is having a better year than all of those players, and he plays with the best passing QB of the bunch (apologies to healthy Ben Roethlisberger). He'll also be at home, something JuJu, the Browns, and Cooper didn't have the advantage of.</p>

      <p>Can you really sit Hopkins? You can. It's possible you have three wide receivers better. Will you? Probably not, but Will Fuller is another story. You can argue he actually has more upside because he won't have Gilmore on him and he has more big-play potential. That might be true, but, again -- only one receiver has caught a touchdown against the Pats all year. Perhaps they're due to get burned, especially when you factor in the bad QBs/mediocre WRs they've faced, but Fuller is the definition of a boom-or-bust risk this week.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Fortunately, there are plenty of potential sleepers. Russell Gage (vs. Saints), Tre'Quan Smith/Ted Ginn (@ Falcons), and Taylor Gabriel/Anthony Miller (@ Lions) could get your week started off right on Thanksgiving if you're willing to take a risk, while Demarcus Robinson/Mecole Hardman are boom-or-bust flierson Sunday against the Raiders, especially if Tyreek Hill (hamstring) is out. Dede Westbrook/Chris Conley (vs. Buccaneers) are also solid options, while Kelvin Harmon (@ Panthers) is a deep play in a favorable matchup. Green Bay's secondary receivers are worth a look against the Giants, and New England's Nos. 2 and 3 -- whatever the combination is of Mohamed Sanu (ankle), Phillip Dorsett (concussion), Jakobi Meyers, and N'Keal Harry) -- have potential value against the Texans.</p>
      <p>Suttron (vs. Chargers), Keenan Allen/Mike Williams (@ Broncos), OBJ/Landry (@ Steelers), Hollywood Brown (vs. 49ers), Kenny Golladay/Marvin Jones (vs. Bears), Cooper/Michael Gallup (vs. Bills), and John Brown/Cole Beasley (@ Cowboys) aren't in great spots, but most are worth starting. Hollywood is the riskiest, with Williams and Beasley also having relatively low floors and ceilings.</p>
