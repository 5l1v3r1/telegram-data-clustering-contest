      <h1>Hotel pardons turkey named after Trump from 'getting his head chopped off and from any impeachment process’</h1>

      <p>A New York hotel <u><a href="https://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/in-the-know/471877-ny-inn-to-pardon-turkey-named-trump">named</a></u> its Thanksgiving turkey “Trump” and planned to grant the bird a pardon from the dinner table and the House impeachment.</p>
      <p>The Milleridge Inn, a hotel that has been operating in Long Island for more than 80 years, announced that Trump the turkey will be pardoned. The "red-orange headed turkey” was named after the 45th president because the two share the same June 14 birthday.</p>
      <p>Butch Yamali, the owner of the hotel, said the name referenced the impeachment chaos in Washington, D.C., in his statement about the annual turkey pardoning: “Trump will be spared from getting his head chopped off and from any impeachment process as he is loved by everyone.”</p>
      <p>Like the president, Trump the turkey, will leave the New York area to reside near Washington, D.C.</p>
      <p>Yamali explained, "[Trump the turkey] will be spared this Thanksgiving holiday to spend the rest of his days on a turkey farm in Virginia, several miles from the White House.”</p>
      <p>Trump the turkey will likely have a much more relaxing holiday season than President Trump, who is battling impeachment. The House Intelligence Committee is working to conclude its impeachment report to hand off to the <u><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/congress/here-comes-the-circus-raucous-judiciary-panel-set-to-reclaim-impeachment">House Judiciary Committee,</a></u> which could begin its impeachment process in early December.</p>
      <p>Construction of the Milleridge Inn began in 1672. The building, which was owned by a Quaker family, survived the Revolutionary War and the population expansion in New York.</p>
