      <p>Being the only Kardashian-Jenner daughter without a baby is a lot of pressure, and on Sunday, <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1096711/kendall-jenner-s-famous-friends-really-want-her-to-start-a-family">Kendall Jenner joked about starting a family</a> with longtime friend Fai Khadra. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5RRQCgjCEH/">Jenner posted photos with Khadra</a> and nephews Psalm West and Saint West on Instagram, asking followers if the two should have a family of their own. Khadra, who is a musican and a model, has been a <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/kendall-jenners-date-to-the-biebers-wedding-is-a-longtime-friend-18840498">close friend of the reality star</a> for years, but the two have denied any romantic relationship.</p>
      <p>On Instagram, Jenner captioned the slideshow of photos with a joke about having her own baby, writing, "everyone in favor of Fai and i starting a family say 'I'." Friends and family responded enthusiastically, with Kim Kardashian commenting, "I!!!!!!!!!," and Kris Jenner writing, "I" with a heart eyes emoji. Hailey Bieber responded with several enthusiastic comments, writing, "I DOOO" and "I SAY YES," while Gigi Hadid commented with an eye emoji.</p>
      <p>Jenner is currently the only Kardashian-Jenner daughter not to have a baby, as of April of 2018, when <a href="https://people.com/parents/khloe-kardashian-daughter-true-photos/">Khloe Kardashian gave birth to daughter True Thompson</a>, as per <i>People,</i> making her the second-to-last daughter to start family<i>. </i>Meanwhile, Kylie Jenner, Kourtney Kardashian, and Kim Kardashian, are all mothers as well.<i> </i>But despite her sisters love of motherhood, <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/does-kendall-jenner-want-kids-her-answer-will-make-you-stop-comparing-her-to-her-sisters-8520740">Jenner has been candid about not wanting kids</a> anytime soon, but that hasn't stopped her from joking about the baby fever.</p>

      <p>Back in April, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Bwuc88uj0qb/?utm_source=ig_embed">Jenner posted a family photo</a> on Instagram, posing with her sisters and their kids, and it included a funny joke about the rapidly growing family. In addition to the family picture, the post included a meme of a woman with a bag over her head, which was captioned "Pregnancy is in the air. Me."</p>
      <p>In March of 2018, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckS1F3mJzb0">Jenner discussed having kids</a> during an interview on <i>The Ellen DeGeneres Show, </i>saying, "I have moments where I'm like, 'Do I have baby fever? Like, do I want a baby right now?' But I don't. I don't." She added, "But I'm good. I can wait for a little while longer." <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/does-kendall-jenner-want-kids-her-answer-will-make-you-stop-comparing-her-to-her-sisters-8520740">Jenner reiterated her desire to wait to have kids</a> in an interview with <i>Vogue </i>in April of 2019, stating, "I want to have kids, but at, like, 28 or 29."</p>

      <p>Back in May of 2018, <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a20634325/kendall-jenner-lana-del-ray-june-cover-interview/">Jenner opened up about her growing family</a> in an interview with <i>Elle, </i>joking, "It’s forever growing. Every time I think it’s eased up, someone’s popping out a baby." That someone just won't be Jenner, not anytime soon, anyways.</p>
