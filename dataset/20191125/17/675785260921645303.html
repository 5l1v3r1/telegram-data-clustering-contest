      <h3>Dear Coleen</h3>
      <p>I’m in a fantastic relationship, or so I thought.</p>
      <p>I’m 35, my girlfriend is 37, and has a seven-year-old daughter from a previous marriage. We have been together for three years and I love her daughter like my own.</p>
      <p>However, while clearing a room prior to decorating, I found an old file of ­paperwork.</p>
      <p>I asked my ­girlfriend if she needed it, and she told me to have a look through it.</p>
      <p>I was dumbfounded when I found a Clare’s Law check [the right to ask police if a partner poses a risk] carried out on me at her request.</p>
      <p>I asked her to explain it and she said it was “nothing” and tried to laugh it off.</p>
      <p>That was a week ago and I’m ­struggling to understand it all. I’ve told her I feel offended and now I’m making excuses not to be near her. I’m even considering leaving the relationship.</p>
      <p>When we talked about it she ­apologised, but I’m still seriously considering walking out. If she doesn’t trust me, why should I stay?</p>
      <p>I’ve never been in trouble, I’m a serving soldier, and just cannot get over this.</p>
      <p>She is concerned about my behaviour now because I’ve shut myself off, and I’m so close to telling her we’re over. Am I reacting rationally?</p>
      <h3>Coleen says</h3>
      <p>I actually admire your girlfriend – she was going into a new relationship as a single parent with a young daughter. She didn’t know your past and, we have to accept that if someone does have a criminal record, they might not admit to it.</p>
      <p>I don’t think it’s a case of her not trusting you, she was just making sure everything would be OK for her daughter – she was being a responsible parent.</p>
      <p>Putting myself in your shoes, if a new partner asked me if it was OK to get me checked out, I’d say “absolutely” because I’d know they wouldn’t find anything.</p>
      <p>So I think it would help you to get over this by putting yourself in her shoes and putting your pride or ego to one side.</p>
      <p>Many women have got into ­relationships and only find out when it’s too late that their partner has a domestic violence conviction.</p>
      <p>This law protects potentially vulnerable people, and I think it’s a great thing.</p>
      <p>If you love her and her daughter as you say you do, then be honest about your feelings, but then move on. Throwing in the towel now wouldn’t make any sense.</p>
      <p>I understand how you feel but, from her point of view, I also understand it’s quite hard to tell your partner upfront that you want to get them checked out.</p>
      <p>Think about how devastated you’d be if you broke up and she went out with someone else she hadn’t checked out and something awful happened to her or her daughter.</p>
      <p>Try not to take it personally because you shouldn’t.</p>
