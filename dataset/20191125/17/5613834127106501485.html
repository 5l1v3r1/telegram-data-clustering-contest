      <h1>Watch A24 and ‘Under the Skin’ Director Jonathan Glazer’s Unsettling New Short Film ‘The Fall’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T17:54:43+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 17:54</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/author/john-squires/" target="_blank">John Squires</a></address>
      <p>Running just under six minutes long, the nightmarish new film from <i>Under the Skin</i> director<b> Jonathan Glazer</b> has made its way online today, presented by BBC Films and A24.</p>
      <p>The official plot synopsis for the short film reads:</p>
      <blockquote>“A masked mob cruelly punish a lone masked man.”</blockquote>
      <p>With no clear explanations as to precisely what is going on, <i>The Fall</i> presents itself like a terrifying nightmare captured on film as an angry mob besieges one of their own and forces him down to the deep, dark depths of a seemingly bottomless hole in the ground. It’s a simple but deeply unnerving setup, armed with a foreboding vibe that’s hard to shake.</p>
      <p>What does it all mean? Talking about the short film, Glazer explained to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/27/jonathan-glazer-the-fall-nazism">The Guardian</a> back in October: “<i>I think fear is ever-present. And that drives people to irrational behaviour. A mob encourages an abdication of personal responsibility. The rise of National Socialism in Germany for instance was like a fever that took hold of people. We can see that happening again</i>.”</p>
