        <b>Ibrahim Ali has been charged with first-degree murder in the death of Marrisa Shen</b>
      </p>
      <p>The trial for the man charged in the killing of a Burnaby teenager will skip the preliminary inquiry and head straight to trial next September.</p>
      <p>Ibrahim Ali, born in 1990, is charged with first-degree murder in the death of Marrisa Shen, 13, in a Burnaby park in 2017. Shen’s body was found in Central Park in the early morning hours of July 18, 2017.</p>
      <p>BC Prosecution Service spokesperson Daniel McLaughlin told Black Press Media Monday that the BCPS filed a request for a direct indictment in B.C. Supreme Court on Oct. 19.</p>
      <p>Ali’s trial is scheduled to begin at B.C. Supreme Court on Sept. 21, 2020. He will be tried by jury.</p>
