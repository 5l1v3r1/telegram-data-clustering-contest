      <p>The decision comes as Liverpool are set to play two games in two continents within less than a 24 hour period, with the quarter-final on December 17 preceding Club World Cup semi-final duties in Qatar the next day.</p>

      <p>The team is set to mirror the schedule and practices that Klopp’s senior side undertake for a regular first-team match, and Critchley and fellow academy staff members have been spending more time at Melwood to learn and absorb as much information as possible ahead of the fixture.</p>
      <p>Pepijn Lijnders had been mooted as the man to take over the mantle in Klopp’s absence before linking back up with Liverpool’s senior contingent in Qatar.</p>
      <p>But Liverpool’s under-23s manager will now get the nod, but the senior figures at his disposal are to be limited as the likes of <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/james-milner/">James Milner</a>, <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/joe-gomez/">Joe Gomez</a> and <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/adam-lallana/">Adam Lallana</a> are expected to be in Qatar instead of Villa Park.</p>
      <p>However, the report does state that Liverpool do not need to take a full 23-man squad to the tournament.</p>
      <p>It would enable them to utilise players across both games, but, while “it would seem unlikely” a final decision on players flying to Qatar after the Villa tie “has still yet to be taken.”</p>
