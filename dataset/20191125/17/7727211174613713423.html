      <p>Updates are expected to be made to the water park, which opened in the Merseyside town over 12 years ago.</p>
      <p>When is reopens, Splashworld visitors will be able to enjoy updated facilities and potentially some new ones.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/sefton-council">Sefton Council</a> said: "This is incredibly welcome news which will see Splashworld benefit from updated facilities, and potentially the addition of some new facilities for people to enjoy for many years to come.</p>
      <p>"Splashworld has been open since 2007 and, like many well used facilities, is now in need of refurbishment.</p>
      <p>"During the closure we will also be carrying out some remedial works.</p>
      <p>"The winter months are the perfect opportunity to do this as they are naturally quieter and we will be using this time to engage with our residents, centre users and the local community to garner ideas for how the refreshed facility can change."</p>
