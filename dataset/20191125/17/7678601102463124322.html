      <p>Former communications and information minister Rudiantara has been appointed to be the director of state-owned electricity firm PLN, according to Cabinet Secretary Pramono Agung.</p>
      <p>“I hope he will be inaugurated soon,” Pramono said at the Presidential Palace in Jakarta on Monday, as quoted by <i>kompas.com</i>.</p>
      <p>He said the Final Assessment Team had agreed on Rudiantara for the top post at PLN.</p>
      <p>“The Final Assessment hearing has finished. Now the ball is on the State-owned Enterprises [SOEs] Ministry’s field,” he said.</p>
      <p>The hearing was attended by President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo, Pramono, SOEs Minister Erick Thohir and several other ministers.</p>
      <p>However, Arya Sinulingga, an aide to Minister Erick, said he had yet to receive any confirmation from the palace regarding Rudiantara’s appointment.</p>
      <p>“We haven’t received any information from the palace. <i>Pak </i>Erick usually receives [a letter from the palace], but he is still on an overseas trip. He’ll return on the 29<sup>th</sup>, so we’ll just have to wait until the minister is here,” Arya said.</p>
      <p>He said Rudiantara was picked as one of the candidates because of his experience as a minister in the communications sector, which spoke to his ability to command a large corporation like PLN.</p>
      <p>Rudiantara served as the communications and information minister during Jokowi’s first presidential term. In October, Johnny G. Plate replaced Rudiantara in the post. <b>(rfa)</b></p>
