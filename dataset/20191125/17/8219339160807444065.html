      <h1>Apple’s new ‘Make Someone’s Holiday’ ad uses the iPad to create a moment out of memories</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T17:16:15+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 17:16</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5mac.com/author/michaelpotuck/" target="_blank">Michael Potuck</a></address>
      <p>Apple has shared its heartfelt holiday ad on YouTube today. This year’s release follows a family as they deal with the loss of their grandma/mother and the creative way that the grandkids show love and appreciation for their grandpa as he remembers his wife with the help of iPad.</p>
      <p>In keeping <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2018/11/20/apple-share-your-gifts-ad/">with tradition</a>, Apple has shared its longer-form holiday ad, this year called “The Surprise.”</p>
      <blockquote>Sometimes, the best gifts can come from the most unexpected places.</blockquote>
      <p>The story follows a family through the hustle and bustle of holiday travel to grandpa’s house. He’s still mourning the loss of his wife.</p>
      <p>Wanting to help, the grandkids take time to look back at some home videos, capture new content, and put together a beautiful video celebrating the love of their grandparents (and parents).</p>
      <p>The most heartfelt moment is when a shot of grandma waiving moves grandpa to wave back and the video ending with “But we are still together.”</p>
      <p>The soundtrack is <a href="https://apple.co/2O50rYZ"><i>Married Life</i></a> by Michael Giacchino from the movie <i>Up</i>. Check out the new ad below:</p>
