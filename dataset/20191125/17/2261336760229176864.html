      <h1>Michael Bisping on Ben Askren’s retirement: ‘I scoff at a hip replacement’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T17:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 17:00</time> by <a rel="author">Milan Ordoñez</a></address>
      <p>Last week, Ben Askren announced second retirement from mixed martial arts competition. “Funky” also <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/11/18/20970995/ufc-ben-askren-announces-retirement-mma-retiring-hip-replacement-mma-news">cited hip issues</a> as one of the primary reasons for his decision to hang it up.</p>
      <p>Many lauded the 35-year-old Askren for his accomplishments and how he <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/11/21/20974390/ufc-mma-news-social-media-twitter-chris-weidman-ben-askren-retirement-fight">inspired former UFC champions</a>. Hall-of-Famer Michael Bisping, however, found his hip replacement reason a bit laughable.</p>
      <p>“Anyone out there, you ask any doctor, they will tell you, hip replacement/knee replacement, not even in the same category,” Bisping said during a recent episode of his <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/believe-you-me/id1212985132?mt=2">Believe You Me podcast</a> (via <a href="https://www.mmanews.com/michael-bisping-scoffs-at-a-hip-replacement-leading-to-retirement/">MMA News</a>). “Not even anywhere close in the same category as recovery, rehab, pain endured through said process.</p>
      <p>“Any doctor will tell you. People are coming up to me going, ‘Oh, yeah, that’s right. I had a hip replacement,’ and I just want to go, ‘Ohhh, don’t talk to me about your hip replacement, OK? I had a knee replacement, knee replacement!</p>
      <p>“Hip replacement is nothing. I scoff at a hip replacement,” he continued. “I laugh at a hip replacement. I have no sympathy. Quick operation. My mom recovered from one, no problem. My dad had one, doesn’t even mention it.”</p>
      <p>“The Count” went on to mock Askren’s condition, but did give props afterward.</p>
      <p>“It’s probably a good idea if he’s retiring because my mom has stronger hips than Ben Askren,” Bisping said. “Simple as that. My old, frail, flailing mother has stronger hips, can sprawl better than Ben Askren.</p>
      <p>“I’m a big fan of the guy. I’d like to still see him fight. I’m sure he could earn some money. But I think from a competitive standpoint, he came over and it wasn’t a good year. And he’s like, ‘You know what? I’m gonna move on.’”</p>
      <p>Askren did admit that his two losses against Jorge Masvidal and Demian Maia was because he “<a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/11/18/20971629/ufc-ben-askren-lost-because-wasnt-good-enough-retirement-hip-injury-mma-news">wasn’t good enough</a>.” He retired with a record of 19-2 (with 1 NC and 12 wins by stoppage).</p>
