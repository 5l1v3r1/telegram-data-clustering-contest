      <h1>Young man in court over defilement</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T17:36:21+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 17:36</time> by <a rel="author">Joyce Danso, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Accra, Nov. 25, GNA - A 25 year-old unemployed Nigerian is facing prosecution at an Accra Circuit Court for defiling a nine year-old girl.</p>
      <p>Festus Ogun, who has no legal representation, however, denied the offence, when he appeared before the Court on Monday.</p>
      <p>The Court, subsequently, admitted him to bail in the sum of GHÂ¢20,000.00 with three sureties and adjourned the matter to December 17.</p>
      <p>Mrs. Rita Abrokwa-Doko, who presided, stated that two of the sureties should be Ghanaians, with one of them coming from the Greater Accra Metropolis.</p>
      <p>In his narration, the Prosecutor, Chief Inspector Kofi Atimbire, stated that the mother of the girl was the complainant, while the parties in the case resided at different locations in Nungua and Accra.</p>
      <p>On November 4, this year, when the girl returned home from school, her mother detected that she was unwell, so enquired about her problem.</p>
      <p>She then told her that on her way from school for sometime, a man had been luring her into a bathroom to repeatedly have sex with her.</p>
      <p>According to the Prosecutor, the offender warned her not to disclose his actions to anyone otherwise she would die.</p>
      <p>However, she told her mother that she could identify him.</p>
      <p>Consequently, the following day, the mother went with her daughter to ambush the alleged perpetrator.</p>
      <p>Fortunately, at the expected time, Ogun emerged at the location for the victim to identify him; following which her mother mobilised some witnesses, who nabbed him and sent him to the Police Station in Nungua.</p>
      <p>A medical form was, thereafter, issued to the complainant to seek medical care for the victim.</p>
