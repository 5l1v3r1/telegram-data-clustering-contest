      <p>PlayStation 5 is expected to hit next year, and it’s meant to be faster than ever.</p>
      <p>Sony’s next console could use Samsung SSD to load games faster, according to Samsung during a presentation in Tokyo today – as reported by Niko Partners senior analyst <a href="https://twitter.com/ZhugeEX/status/1198968173762162690">Daniel Ahmad</a>.</p>
      <p>The tech company revealed it is currently working on an NVMe SSD – that’s Non-Volatile Memory Express – which will be used on an upcoming game console next year. While Samsung doesn’t explicitly name the PlayStation 5, an accompanying slide features a picture of a PlayStation DualShock controller.</p>
      <p>Samsung claim the new SSD will introduce a new “era in game consoles,” with reduced load times when loading games or booting up your system. It is estimated that a standard hard drive takes just under 50 seconds for a system boot, an SSD takes around 29 secods, while an optimised NVMe will take a lot less. However, exactly how long isn’t clear just yet.</p>
      <p>As was previously confirmed, PlayStation 5 is said to <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/10/08/ps5-hardware-accelerated-gpu-ray-tracing-4k-blu-ray-media/">sport a custom AMD GPU with support for ray tracing</a> and <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/05/24/ray-tracing-explained-ps5-xbox-next-gen/">8K resolution – although it will continue compatibility with the PSVR headset.</a> Sony already stated its new console will greatly reduce loading time in games, but it wasn’t confirmed what technology was in place to do that. The company <a href="https://twitter.com/mochi_wsj/status/1130645990627631105">showed how quickly the PS5 can load PS4 games earlier this year</a>, with a PS5 gameplay reveal booting Marvel’s Spider-Man in 0.8 seconds.</p>
