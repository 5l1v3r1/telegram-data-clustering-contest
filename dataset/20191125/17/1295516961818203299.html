      <h1>Lil Nas X Knows You Think He Dressed like a Jojo Character for the AMAs</h1>

      <p>The American Music Awards aired Sunday night, and although artist Lil Nas X won for Favorite Rap/Hip-Hop Song for his hit "<a href="https://screenrant.com/old-town-road-lil-nas-x-lyrics-meaning/">Old Town Road</a> (Remix)," it was his bold, bright fashion choice that has most people talking.</p>
      <p>With a lime green tuxedo and a zebra-print top with matching green gloves, it wasn't long before Twitter users started drawing comparisons between Lil Nas X's outfit and <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/jojos-bizarre-adventure/"><i>JoJo's Bizarre Adventure</i></a>, the popular anime series with a very distinct color palette and style.</p>

      <p>The feedback got to the point where Lil Nas X even had to set the record straight himself, asking people to please stop in their comparisons to certain <i>JoJo's Bizarre Adventure</i> characters.</p>
      <p>This isn't the first time Lil Nas X has turned heads with his fashion choices, as the artist has become known for his eclectic taste in fashion. However, his most recent look has already brought with it its own series of fan art and drawings.</p>
      <p><i>JoJo's Bizarre Adventure </i>follows the strange and wacky adventures of the Joestar family across multiple generations. The most recent anime adaptation started in 2012 and has aired four seasons.</p>
