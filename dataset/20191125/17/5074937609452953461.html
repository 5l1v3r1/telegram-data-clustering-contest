      <h1>SOVRAE urged to show leadership in engineering endeavours</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T17:07:57+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 17:07</time> by <a rel="author">Bertha Badu-Agyei/ Benjamin Akoto</a></address>
      <p>Akuse (E/R), Nov 25, GNA - The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Volta River Authority (VRA), Mr Emmanuel Antwi-Darkwa, has advised the Society of Volta River Authority Engineers (SOVRAE) to show leadership in innovation and research needed for development of the energy sector.</p>
      <p>He called on them to lead the discourse in energy matters and have a voice in policy and regulation to address the challenges in the energy sector in Ghana.</p>
      <p>Mr Antwi-Darkwa said this at the opening of the 2019 annual General conference and banquet of SOVRAE at Akuse on the theme “The BRAISE strategy-the Engineer’s contribution towards the new VRA”</p>
      <p>The conference discussed among other things practical engineering case study, process approach and possible potential actions going into the future of the energy industry.</p>
      <p>The SOVRAE was established in 1982 through the initiative of some engineers within the VRA who saw the need to support engineering practices within the organisation and to provide advisory role to VRA management.</p>
      <p>Mr Antwi-Darkwa encouraged the engineers to be interested in the sector issues such as the availability and reliability of power, affordability and access to electricity so as not to leave the issues to the politicians alone.</p>
      <p>He explained that research will allow for the development of solutions that will help to improve existing practices, redefine traditional theories and propose solutions to address perennial problems.</p>
      <p>The VRA boss noted that the survival and prosperity of institutions were determined by their investments into research, ability to innovate and the quest to push existing boundaries and urged the association to focus on research activities to develop their capacities.</p>
      <p>SOVRAE President, Mr Darlington Ahuble said the theme for the conference was chosen at time that VRA was poised for a paradigm shift in its business strategy to achieve financial recovery in all aspects of its operations.</p>
      <p>He said the challenges confronting the environment called for a new understanding and indicated that engineers were trained to find solutions, and there should be an effort to make great impact and significant contribution within their respective communities.</p>
      <p>The President said the frontiers of engineering practices could be better deepened in the VRA, with a well-structured monitoring and coaching approach for the senior colleagues to mentor the young engineers through their experiences in the practice over the years.</p>
      <p>The Managing Director of Northern Electricity Development Company (NEDCo) Mr Osmani Aludiba Ayuba said NEDCo had reached a point, where it had to do some introspection and asked some relevant questions about the business attitudes and achievements to lead the organisation in its initiative drive</p>
      <p>He explained that the new direction would call for some radical re-alignment and a paradigm shift in attitudes adding ‘’we must brace ourselves for change because that is the only way forward’’.</p>
