      <p>Officials urged Americans not to eat the leafy green if the label doesn't say where it was grown. They also urged supermarkets and restaurants not to serve or sell the lettuce, unless they're sure it was grown elsewhere.</p>
      <p>The warning applies to all types of romaine from the Salinas region, including whole heads, hearts and pre-cut salad mixes.</p>
      <p>"We're concerned this romaine could be in other products," said Laura Gieraltowski, lead investigator of the outbreak at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
      <p>Officials said their investigation led to farms in Salinas and that they are looking for the source of E. coli tied to the illnesses. Salinas is a major growing region for romaine from around April to this time of year, when growing shifts south to Yuma, Arizona.</p>

      <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced the recall Monday, Nov. 18.
