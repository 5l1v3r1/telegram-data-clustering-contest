      <p>Two anti-Brexit campaigners claim they were pulled over by police and told the remove a slogan from their car.</p>
      <p>The side of the car had been printed with the words ‘Bollocks to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/brexit/">Brexit</a>’, and officers allegedly took issue with the swear word.</p>
      <p>Passenger Peter Cook said he and a friend were ‘minding their own business’ on the M25 when they were signalled to pull over.</p>
      <p>An officer he described as appearing angry told him the sign was a public order offence, Mr Cook <a href="https://www.theneweuropean.co.uk/top-stories/eu-flag-mafia-bollocks-to-brexit-1-6392585">told</a> the New European.</p>
      <p>In a video he tweeted from the scene, he said: ‘I think he’s just trying to trump up a charge … he’s probably a Brexit person. This is absolutely shocking.</p>
      <p>‘Here we have the long arm of the law being used to shut down any form of protest.’</p>

      <p>He said the car was stopped around 2.30pm yesterday on the motorway near Brentwood.</p>
      <p>Initially, he claimed he was asked to remove the slogan on the hard shoulder but was allowed to drive into a services to remove it.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for Essex Police said: ‘We are trying to identify the officer from the video footage to establish the circumstances around what happened.</p>
      <p>‘In the meantime, we would encourage the driver to get in touch with us.’</p>
      <p>In 1977,  a judge ruled ‘bollocks’ was not obscene after a record store manager was prosecuted for displaying the record Never Mind The bollocks, Here’s The Sex Pistols.</p>
