      <h1>Brits 'thought internet would never catch on and was like something off Star Trek'</h1>
      <h2>A study from Smart Energy GB claims younger adults were mistrustful of the internet and thought it would pass them by - but now those aged between 48 and 65 are the 'Dot-com Adopters'</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T17:48:03+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 17:48</time> by <a rel="author">Joseph Wilkes, Gemma Francis, https://www.facebook.com/dailymirror/</a></address>
      <p>Millions of Brits thought the internet was 'just a phase' and would never take off, a study claims.</p>
      <p>A poll of 4,000 UK adults found nearly one in 10 of those aged between 18 and 35 at the dawn of the web thought it would simply 'pass them by'.</p>
      <p>Nearly a fifth thought it would only benefit big businesses, with frustrations during the early years including slow speeds and not being able to use the landline at the same time.</p>
      <p>However, despite the initial hesitation, nearly half of this age group say they went on to embrace the new technology.</p>
      <p>The research was commissioned by Smart Energy GB to investigate how the different generations adapt to new technology such as smart meters.</p>
      <p>It identified a generation currently aged between 48 and 65 - dubbed the Dot-com Adopters - who are surprisingly willing and able to embrace new technology.</p>

      <p>This generation is also the most multi-skilled, as they are just as comfortable wiring plugs and bleeding radiators as they are using satnav or a smartphone.</p>
      <p>Psychologist Donna Dawson said: "Contrary to what many of us assume about the older generations being more set in their ways, the Dot-com Adopters have spent most of their adult lives adapting to the huge changes that the internet has made in our society.</p>
      <p>"And they are leading the charge in learning and adapting to new technology for the benefits that it brings in the long term.</p>
      <p>"Also, the Dot-Com adopters, having general life-experience of what works and what doesn't, have understood better than many the ways that technology can be harnessed for the greater good in society and our planet, and have adapted accordingly."</p>

      <p>The research also found nearly half of those aged 48 and over recognise that the nation needs to keep an open mind and adapt to new technologies which may help the environment.</p>
      <p>In fact, many have already implemented energy efficiency technologies to their homes including LED bulbs, double glazing and having a smart meter installed.</p>
      <p>More than half are adopting energy efficiency measures because they recognise that they are good for the environment - more than any other generation.</p>
      <p>In addition, 52 per cent of Dot-com Adopters, polled via OnePoll, believe we need to upgrade Britain's energy infrastructure - more than younger generations.</p>

      <p>Robert Cheesewright, director of corporate affairs for Smart Energy GB, said: "Since British pioneer Tim Berners-Lee kick-started the digital era 30 years ago, technology has moved on beyond all expectations.</p>
      <p>However, our energy system has been left behind. We want to take this opportunity to celebrate and recognise the forward-thinking Dot-com Adopters who embraced the world wide web at its inception, and are now driving the change our energy system needs to meet the challenges of the future.</p>
      <p>"In fact, they are already setting an example for other generations, simply by getting a smart meter installed.</p>
      <p>"And those aged 48 to 65 are the generation most likely to install energy efficiency measures, like smart meters, because they're good for the environment."</p>

      <p>Carol Vorderman who is supporting the campaign, added "As a Dot-com Adopter myself, I'm not at all surprised to hear that it's not just the younger generations who are adapting to new tech - and I'm delighted to be able to be a champion for the Dot-com Adopters.</p>
      <p>"We know what life was like before the internet and the smart technologies it has led to, and so I think we have a pragmatic approach to it.</p>
      <p>"I worked as an engineer on a major power generation construction site when I was young and grew up needing coins for the immersion heater meter which I suppose was its own kind of electricity conservation, although we didn't see it like that at the time.</p>
      <p>"Smart meters take the new generation of energy usage to an intelligent level, and will update our energy system.</p>
      <p>"The data that smart meters are able to generate allows our energy system to understand how much energy is being used, when and where. It's exciting."</p>

      <p>Robert Cheesewright added: "Only thirty years ago, we were preparing to lay the foundations of this digital revolution by adopting the internet in our own homes.</p>
      <p>"We're now laying the foundations of a smart energy system - adapting to smarter home technology - with smart meters at the heart of this."</p>
      <h3>'It was something like you'd seen on Star Trek'</h3>
      <p>Michael Graham, 66, from Leeds, confessed he wasn't sure about the Internet in its early days and thought it was something more likely to be seen on sci-fi programmes like Star Trek, than in the homes of the nation.</p>
      <p>He wasn't convinced it could be 'trusted' and lacked confidence the system would actually catch on.</p>
      <p>Michael, who was 35 in 1989 - the year the internet as we know it was introduced - said: "I was nervous to trust it. Internet banking, when that was introduced a little later, in particular was something that everybody was cautious about, being scammed out of money.</p>
      <p>"For the majority of people, I think they thought the concept was alien. It was something like you'd seen on Star Trek."</p>
      <p>At first, Michael only really saw it as something which would be used by governments, rather than in homes, and didn't ever imagine it getting to the stage where it is now, so heavily relied upon.</p>
      <p>However, after getting used to the internet and everything it could do, Michael saw the future in it and recognised how it was going to change the world as he knew it.</p>
      <p>Now, he admits he spends 'far too much' time online.</p>
      <p>He added: "People didn't understand it and thought it would pass us by - they just didn't know what it was.</p>
      <p>"They didn't see the extent of what it could do and a lot of people couldn't see the point of it."</p>
      <p>Since adapting to modern technology and learning to embrace something new like the internet, Michael is convinced the future is about embracing future smart technology- especially when it comes to energy efficiency.</p>
      <p>He was an early adopter of solar panels, is a big advocate for smart meters and also believes that fuel cells for vehicles will be the next big thing - and perhaps even as central to every day life as the internet in 30 years' time.</p>
      <p>He said: "I got solar panels ten years ago. I monitor them on an app. Solar is a good thing for us - and guess what, I researched it on the internet.</p>
      <p>"Once people get familiar with smart meters, I think they get on board. I know people are wary - but it's a positive thing."</p>
