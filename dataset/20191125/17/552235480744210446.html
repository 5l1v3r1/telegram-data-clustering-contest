      <p>Our regional sports writers are bringing together a list of some of the players who have had the biggest impact in Lanarkshire over the past decade.</p>
      <p>From <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/local-sport/hamilton-accies-pals-battle-derby-20921943">Albion Rovers to Hamilton Accies, to Airdrieonians</a> to East Kilbride, from Motherwell to Clyde - with your help we can pick the best side from the past decade.</p>
      <p>Vote for your favourite below as our team profile their picks for the best Lanarkshire goalkeeper of the decade</p>
      <p>
        <u>Tomas Cerny</u>
      </p>
      <p>Tomas joined Accies on loan from Sigma Olomouc in 2007 and helped them achieve promotion to the then-SPL in 2009.</p>
      <p>Following his successful loan, Cerny opted to stay and Hamilton made a deal to sign him permanently. Although there weren't too many notable games in that period, Tomas was outstandingÂ as a goalkeeper and was the club#s player of the year in 2008-09.</p>
      <p>He left by mutual consent in February 2012, following the club's relegation to the First Division. Tomas has since played for Hibs, Partick Thistle and is currently at Aberdeen, but is very fondly remembered.</p>

      <p>
        <u>Darren Randolph</u>
      </p>
      <p>Having now hit the heights of the English Premiership and establishing himself as Ireland's number one, Randolph made a huge impact during his stint at Fir Park.</p>
      <p>In his first season he broke John Ruddy's clean sheet record of 15 and reached the Scottish Cup final in 2011. He was also between the sticks as Motherwell made their Champions League debut against Panathanikos, before playing in the Europa League play-off against Levante.</p>
      <p>Before leaving in 2013, he helped Well to second and earned his second consecutive Team of the Year gong.</p>
      <p>
        <u>Matt McGinley</u>
      </p>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/local-sport/east-kilbride-keeper-plays-down-13088787">two-time Lowland League winner</a> with East Kilbride, it's been a decade to remember for the 30-year-old keeper.</p>
      <p>McGinley - who also had spells with Morton and Albion Rovers - enjoyed an inspired display in February 2016 to restrict Celtic to just a 2-0 victory in their Scottish Cup last 16 tie.A solid shot-stopper and a regular for the last four years, he has lifted five cup trophies with Kilby in the Lowland ranks.</p>

      <p>
        <u>Neil Parry</u>
      </p>
      <p>A keeper loved on both sides of the Monklands divide, Parry made his mark on Lanarkshire at Albion Rovers with his Scottish Cup heroics.</p>
      <p>He was crucial in the win over Motherwell in 2013, and the run to the quarter finals against Rangers - where Parry was controversially bundled out of the way for the Ibrox sides equaliser to secure a replay.</p>
      <p>Parry was also a key figure as Rovers won the League Two title in 2015, before making the switch to boyhood club Airdire. He left the Diamonds for Allloa as he opted to remain part-time, with <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/local-sport/it-gives-opportunity-full-time-14477392">Airdrie ushering in a full-time era.</a></p>

        <u>Michael McGovern</u>
      </p>
      <p>'Magic Mike' joined Accies from Falkirk in June 2014 and was part of their first side in the Premiership following the play-off win over Hibs.</p>
      <p>Mike was part of a side who beat Celtic 1-0 at Celtic Park and Aberdeen 3-0, and thumped Motherwell 5-0 in a New Year's Lanarkshire derby at New Douglas Park.</p>
      <p>Manager Alex Neil moved to Norwich City in January 2015, and Mike followed in the summer of 2016, after playing a blinder for Northern Ireland against Germany at Euro 2016, restricting their illustrious opponents to just a 1-0 win.</p>
      <p>
        <u>PJ Morrison</u>
      </p>
      <p>There may not be an Albion Rovers going into 2020 had it not been for the exploits of the Motherwell loan kid last season.</p>
      <p>Drafted in with little fanfare at Cliftonhill originally on a emergency loan, Morrison would stay until the end of the campaign and rescue the languishing Rovers on several occasions.</p>
      <p>His saves kept Rovers within touching distance of Berwick Rangers and his saves helped Kevin Harper's side pull off <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/local-sport/watch-highs-lows-albion-rovers-14979573">The Great Escape and keep SPFL football in Coatbridge.</a></p>
