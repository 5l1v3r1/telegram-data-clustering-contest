      <p><b>ROANOKE RAPIDS, N.C. (WITN) â€”</b> Multiple people are claiming they've seen a person in costume clowning around one Eastern North Carolina city.</p>
      <p>Roanoke Rapids police say someone reported seeing a person dressed in a clown suit with a mask around 8:45 p.m. Sunday night on Sam Powell Dairy Road and Hwy 48. Officers say they were told the clown was jumping in and out of traffic and throwing things at cars.</p>
      <p>The second sighting happened about a half-hour later in the same area. Police say someone reported that a clown was staring at him through the window of his home. Officers went to the home to investigate, but no one was located.</p>
      <p>At 10 a.m. on Monday, officers say they were able to identify the clown. The person's name has not been released and it's unclear if any charges will be filed.</p>
      <p>Back in 2016, multiple clown sightings were reported around the country.</p>
