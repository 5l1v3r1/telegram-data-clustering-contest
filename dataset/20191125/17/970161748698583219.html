      <p>Law and order is a key priority for many voters during elections.</p>
      <p>The parties have been keen to tackle voters’ concerns in their election manifestos, so here’s what their plans are on crime and justice.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Conservative</b>
      </p>
      <p>The <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/conservative-party/">Conservative Party</a> has pledged to recruit 20,000 new police officers and create 10,000 more prison places.</p>
      <p>Boris Johnson has also set out plans to make it easier for police officers to stop and search those convicted of knife crime.</p>

      <p>The Tories also say they will introduce tougher sentencing for the worst offenders and end automatic halfway release for serious crimes.</p>
      <p>The party has also said it will pass the Domestic Abuse Bill, which will legally require councils to provide secure homes for those who are fleeing domestic violence.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Labour</b>
      </p>

      <p>The Labour party says it will recruit 2,000 more police officers than the Conservatives and restore prison officer numbers.</p>
      <p>It also vowed to end the disproportionate targeting of black and ethnic minority communities in police stop and search.</p>

      <p>The Labour manifesto also says it will review the controversial Prevent programme, which aims to prevent radicalisation, but which critics have called a blunt tool that disproportionately targets Muslims.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Liberal Democrats</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Lib Dems say they will set aside £1 billion to restore community policing and will develop a public health approach to serious violence.</p>
      <p>Jo Swinson says her party will also invest £500 million in youth services to help prevent crime and will recruit 2,000 more prison officers.</p>
      <p>A major policy announcement is the legalisation of cannabis, which the party says will bring in £1.5billion in duty and savings through sale in licenced shops to those over 18.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Green Party</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Green Party says it will boost police powers to tackle hate crime, end the war on drugs and halve the prison population.</p>

      <p>The party says it is also committed to restorative justice and will significantly reduce the number of short-term prison sentences, in the hope of reducing reoffending.</p>
      <p>According to the party’s manifesto, it will also ‘invest in youth services and centres, to help turn at-risk children away from crime’,</p>
      <p>
        <b>Brexit Party</b>
      </p>
      <p>Nigel Farage says his party will focus on increasing police numbers, with a particular focus on tackling violent crime.</p>

      <p>The party says it is committed to more visible policing, focusing on violent crime, robbery and burglary, rather than ‘enforcing restrictions on free speech’.</p>
