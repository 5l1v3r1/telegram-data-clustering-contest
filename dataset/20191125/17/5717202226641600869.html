      <h1>West Ham have reportedly held talks with Manuel Pellegrini over his job security</h1>
      <h2>They apparently worry he hasn’t quite grasped how serious the club’s issues are.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T17:45:08+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 17:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/sam-preston/" target="_blank">Sam Preston</a></address>
      <p>West Ham have had talks with manager Manuel Pellegrini over his future at the club, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/25/west-ham-hold-talks-under-fire-manuel-pellegrini-slump-form/">according to a report by the Telegraph.</a></p>
      <p>The Hammers were abject in the 3-2 weekend home defeat against bitter rivals Tottenham and the report <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/25/west-ham-hold-talks-under-fire-manuel-pellegrini-slump-form/">says</a> that Pellegrini has been told in no uncertain terms that matters must improve.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/25/west-ham-hold-talks-under-fire-manuel-pellegrini-slump-form/">report</a> also outlines that there is a fear at the club that Pellegrini doesn’t accept how serious the club’s problems are, after a slump in form which has seen them drop to 16th in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>That may worry some supporters, but the report says that West Ham want to keep and back Pellegrini, so long as they see immediate improvement.</p>

      <h3>TBR’s View – Pellegrini must acknowledge the need for swift improvement</h3>
      <p>Is Pellegrini the kind of manager who can be relied upon to produce a reaction when the chips are down? His casual demeanour would perhaps suggest not.</p>
      <p>His languid style may well have proved useful for cutting through the noise which surrounds West Ham initially, but at times of struggle, it can feel that he lacks the feeling and passion the fans demand.</p>
      <p>If he doesn’t acknowledge the severity of the loss of form and danger of being in a relegation fight, then his days may well be numbered.</p>
