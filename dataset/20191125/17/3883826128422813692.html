        <b>A 29-year-old Belfast woman had to have her left breast removed after contracting an infection following breast reduction surgery in Turkey.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Amanda White travelled to a clinic in the country on 6 November, but when she returned she became ill and had to have surgery at the Ulster Hospital.</p>
      <p>Despite doctors' efforts to save her breast, she had to have a mastectomy.</p>
      <p>Ms White has spoken out because she wants to warn others of the potential dangers of having surgery abroad.</p>
      <h3>'Severe back pain'</h3>
      <p>The mother of two young boys, who lives in south Belfast, spoke to BBC News NI from her hospital bed.</p>
      <p>"I had always wanted surgery from I was about 18," she said.</p>
      <p>"My chest made me very uncomfortable and I had severe back pain but I had no idea it would turn out like this.</p>
      <p>"The doctor told me if I'd left it any later before getting treatment I wouldn't be here."</p>

      <p>Ms White said alarm bells began to ring as soon as she arrived at the clinic in Turkey.</p>
      <p>"They just wanted my passport and cash," she said.</p>
      <p>"I had to sign a consent form which wasn't in English and the surgeon was only in the room for a few seconds."</p>
      <h3>'Stained'</h3>
      <p>A few hours after surgery, she was taken to a villa where she stayed for three nights in a sparsely-furnished room with no windows.</p>
      <p>"The beds weren't changed and when I asked for the corset they gave me to wear to be washed, it came back and it was still stained," Ms White said.</p>
      <p>She is far from alone. The Ulster Hospital has recently treated six other patients who travelled to foreign countries for their operations with terrible consequences.</p>
      <p>Alastair Brown, a consultant plastic surgeon at the Ulster Hospital, said there had been a worrying increase in what he described as cosmetic surgery tourism.</p>

        <figcaption>Alastair Brown said the NHS is dealing with "disastrous consequences" in some cases</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>"To me it's just ludicrous. I don't know why someone would subject their body to that sort of thing, I just can't understand it," he said.</p>
      <p>"I can understand them trying to save a little bit of money and the cost saving, but really over the long term, is that cost saving?</p>
      <p>"If it goes well then brilliant and some of the cases do go well, but when it goes wrong it goes very wrong and that's where we're just seeing these disastrous consequences.</p>
      <p>"And we cannot emphasise enough the importance of getting this message across to the public - please be very, very careful before subjecting yourself to this."</p>
      <h3>Celebrity endorsements</h3>
      <p>Ms White did her research before going abroad and said she was heavily influenced by a number of celebrities who said they had used the same clinic.</p>
      <p>"All the celebrities are saying 'this place is great' and you trust that," she said.</p>
      <p>The surgery would have cost about £7,000 in Northern Ireland but Ms White spent £3,250 to have the operation in Turkey and that included flights and the extra cost of hotels.</p>
      <p>When she came home the wound on her left side became infected and when she went to her doctor she was told to go to the emergency department.</p>
      <p>Then, last Wednesday, she had to have more surgery.</p>
      <p>"When they opened me up they realised they had to remove my nipple and then had to remove most of my left breast, there was nothing they could do."</p>

        <figcaption>Ms White told reporter Tara Mills that celebrity endorsements had influenced her choice of clinic</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>She will be able to have reconstruction surgery in about nine months.</p>
      <p>"The doctors here have been amazing but it's not okay to go away and I think we have to let girls know - don't go away, save the extra couple of pound and get it done at home."</p>
      <h3>'Free corrections'</h3>
      <p>Mr Brown also wants the public to be aware of the dangers.</p>
      <p>"Think about the establishment and the aftercare," he said.</p>
      <p>"Anybody can get complications but what is in place if something does go wrong?</p>
      <p>"Our surgeons are highly skilled and trained and have ongoing assessment. Does that happen in other countries? We just don't know.</p>
      <p>"We had another case today but from what I'm told it wasn't so severe but it will require a lengthy period of care in the NHS."</p>
      <p>BBC News NI contacted the Comfort Zone Surgery in Turkey where Amanda had the operation.</p>
      <p>In a statement, they said: "As with any surgical procedure, the biggest risk is infection and this can happen to anyone in any country.</p>
      <p>"We are obviously very sad to hear this and are more than happy to make any free corrections that she may need in the short near future."</p>
