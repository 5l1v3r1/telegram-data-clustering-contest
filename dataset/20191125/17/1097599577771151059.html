      <p>Followed by music from the Cashel brass band and the Cashel Dr Diarmuid O’Hurley Pipe Band.</p>
      <p>There will be street entertainment with fire eating and juggling to get everyone into the festive spirit. The Chamber of Commerce has invested in a number of new light displays for the town and this will be your first chance to see them when they come on stream around 7pm.</p>
      <p>The Chamber would like to thank Tipperary County Council for financial help with the Christmas lights in 2019.</p>
