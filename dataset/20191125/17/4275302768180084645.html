      <p>A police probe was launched when a man was found dead in Drummonds Hotel, Markinch, last Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Part of the hotel was cordoned off as detectives investigated.</p>
      <p>It is understood the man was found in a fire escape stairwell by a member of staff at the Balbirnie Street hotel, which is part of the OYO franchise group.</p>
      <p>A police spokeswoman said on Monday: “There are no suspicious circumstances surrounding the death.</p>
      <p>“The Procurator Fiscal has been informed.”</p>
      <p>The hotel’s owners and OYO decided to close the premises for a week and guests were relocated.</p>
      <p>However, the restaurant and lounge reopened on Friday.</p>
      <p>The hotel said: “We are deeply shocked and saddened by what has happened and offer our deepest condolences to the family of this guest.</p>
      <p>“We are assisting the authorities however we can with their investigation and are also doing everything possible to support our staff.”</p>
      <p>It added: “We thank everyone for their patience and understanding through these sad times.”</p>
