      <p><a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/sport/403705/cricket-black-caps-vs-england">Look back at how the match unfolded here</a>.</p>
      <p>The victory at Bay Oval in Mount Maunganui gives New Zealand a one-nil lead in the two Test series.</p>
      <p>Going into the final day of the Test, England were 207 runs behind New Zealand's first innings total and three wickets down.</p>
      <p>England needed to bat the entire fifth day to save the match.</p>
      <p>However, after tea New Zealand pace bowler Neil Wagner claimed his fourth and fifth wickets to wrap up the England innings and the win.</p>
      <p>Wagner took three wickets in 17 balls for just one run as England collapsed from 132-5 to 138-8 before tea, then broke a 59-run ninth-wicket partnership between Jofra Archer and Sam Curran after they had threatened to thwart the hosts.</p>
      <p>The left armer then trapped Stuart Broad in front for a first ball duck to end England's resistance at 197 and end with figures of 5-44 from 19.2 overs.</p>
      <p>The last time the two sides faced each other in a Test series was two summers ago, back during England's tour of Australia and New Zealand between 2017/18. New Zealand won that series 1-0.</p>
      <p>The final Test of the this summer's series starts on Friday at Seddon Park in Hamilton.</p>
      <p>The two-match series is not part of the ICC World Test Championship so no points will go towards the competition.</p>
