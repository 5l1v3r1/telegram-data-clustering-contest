      <p>Perfectly imperfect tousled beach waves can make you look (and feel) like you spent the morning with your toes in the sand — even if you're stuck at the office. But to create them, you've got to have the right tools. The <a href="https://www.elle.com/beauty/hair/g28640/best-curling-iron-wand/">best curling irons for beach waves</a> usually consist of a wave plate, multiple barrels, or a rotating wand that leaves you with loose waves that look perfectly casual instead of seriously polished. While it's true that you'll benefit most from applying a styling product like mousse or sea salt spray first, there's no denying that a quality curling iron is the holy grail where beachy waves are concerned.</p>
      <p>To <a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/beauty/how-to/a8624/how-to-get-beachy-waves/">get the perfect beach waves</a>, start with damp hair that has been towel-dried, apply the styling product of your choice, and decide if you want to dry your hair with a hair dryer or diffuser or let it dry naturally. Once your hair is dry (and only when it's dry — never use a curling iron on wet hair <a href="https://www.self.com/story/curling-iron-mistakes">or you risk breakage and split ends</a>), curl one 1 to 2-inch sections of hair. For the most natural results, be sure to vary the direction of the curls. When you're finished, set your hair with a light hairspray — and you're done.</p>
      <p>Now that you're armed with a few key tips, scroll on the shop the <a href="https://www.byrdie.com/best-curling-wands-4160040">best curling irons and wands</a> for easy, beachy waves. From automatic styling tools that do the work for you to tiny, travel-sized wavers that are easy to pack, you're bound to find a tool that suits your hair type and styling skills, ahead.</p>

      </p>
      <p>This <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003AKHQG8?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=bustle6011-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;creativeASIN=B003AKHQG8">Hot Tools deep waver</a> uses tourmaline and ceramic plates to create glossy, frizz-free waves while minimizing the risk of damage. The brand's Hot Tools Professional Pulse Technology ensures the tool stays at a consistently hot temperature for as long as you use it. This tool heats up to 430 degrees and has multiple temperature settings and an 8-foot cord. Despite its reasonable price point, Hot Tools is a go-to brand for professional hair stylists and beauty bloggers alike.</p>
      <p>One reviewer raved, "This is my GO TO hair tool! If you want beach waves get this product. I bought my first in 2010 and it lasted until 2018 and it was used daily!" Another customer, who described their hair as fine and straight, wrote, "This gives me instant beach waves in less than 15 minutes. It gives me volume no product ever has."</p>
      <h3>2. Best Clampless Wand: The Bed Head Rock N' Roller Curling Wand</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2018/8/14/5b74ed84-4cc1-4dd8-a478-23daebbc5ce4-328ec87f-cb64-4d72-89e8-7524cf6049b9-bed-head-iron.jpg?w=450&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=faces&amp;auto=format&amp;q=70"/>

        <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0092MCQZ4?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=bustle6011-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;creativeASIN=B0092MCQZ4&amp;th=1">Bed Head Rock N' Roller Curling Wand$29.99$24.86|AmazonSee On Amazon</a>
      </p>
      <p>Another styling tool that uses ceramic and tourmaline to reduce damage and frizz, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0092MCQZ4?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=bustle6011-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;creativeASIN=B0092MCQZ4&amp;th=1">Bed Head Rock N' Roller Curling Wand</a> comes at a great price. Create either loose curls or beachy waves using the wand's innovative, round barrel shape, as opposed to a tricky-to-maneuver clamp, all while enhancing your hair's natural volume. For loose curls, wrap sections of hair around the balls — slightly tighter and more structured curls can be achieved by placing hair <i>in between </i>each of the balls. This iron also comes with a bonus mitt to keep your hand safe from burns.</p>
      <p>One reviewer commented, "The big bumps make the clampless curling iron much easier to use. I have a tapered clampless one as well and it is a nightmare to use. This is much easier and the curls you get are not uniform and I think that makes the overall result look much better and more natural."</p>

      </p>
      <p>This three-barrel <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00W4TZU7S?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=bustle6011-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;creativeASIN=B001AFIPP6">hair waver</a> boasts triple ceramic coating to minimize damage and increase shine. It creates slightly tighter-looking waves than a wand, so it might be a better choice if your hair struggles to maintain a curl. One reviewer wrote, "My hair cannot hold a curl. Even with product, it goes flat by the end of the day [...] I had given up on giving my ramrod straight hair any texture for a good 5 years. [With] this product, my hair can hold the waves for a good two days with no product and I find that remarkable!" Other reviewers rave about how easy it is to use, noting that you "literally can't screw this up."</p>

      </p>
      <p>A cult-favorite styling tool created by celebrity hair stylist Sarah Potempa, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07Q9516Z2?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=bustle6011-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;creativeASIN=B00S28DKO0">the Beachwaver</a> literally changed the game upon its launch a few years ago.

      </p>
      <p>One <a href="https://www.elitedaily.com/p/the-3-best-professional-flat-irons-18219947">hair hack according to pro stylists</a> is to invest in a flat iron with rounded tips so you can straighten hair <i>and</i> create loose waves using the same tool. (That's a money-saving tip, too.) That's where <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07VW5RB2G/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=bustle6011-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B07VW5RB2G&amp;linkId=a2086f480481e387cdac47fba69dd461">this two-in-one styler</a> from Kipozi comes in. Using 3-D, nano-titanium floating plates, it efficiently straightens hair with one pass <i>or </i>creates beachy, natural looking waves with a slight twisting motion.</p>
      <p>Impressively, this tool has a rare 4.9-star overall rating on Amazon. One fan commented, "I've been using a straightening iron to create waves for a long time, but the waves were never as nice as with this iron. The curvature of a regular straightening iron is almost non existent so it's easy to unintentionally create kinks, but with this it's almost impossible to do so. This is such a well made tool, everything about it is well thought out from material to dust bag and packaging."</p>
