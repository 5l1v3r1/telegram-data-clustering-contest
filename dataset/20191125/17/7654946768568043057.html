      <h1>Man dies from rare skin-rotting disease after being licked by dog</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T17:28:17+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 17:28</time> by <a rel="author">Ben Cost</a></address>
      <p>It was the kiss of death.</p>
      <p>A friendly smooch from his pooch cost a German man his life, according to the report featured in the <a href="https://ejcrim.com/index.php/EJCRIM/article/view/1268">European Journal of Case Reports in Internal Medicine.</a></p>
      <p>The 63-year-old man reported to Germany’s Rotes Kreuk Krankenhaus hospital with flu-like symptoms after being licked by his dog several weeks prior. The unidentified man was “previously healthy” with no evidence of infection, according to the researchers.</p>
      <p>However, a subsequent medical diagnosis revealed he had contracted <i>Capnocytophaga canimorsus</i>, a gangrenous bacterial infection caused by germs in the mouths of dogs and cats, according to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/capnocytophaga/index.html">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>.</p>
      <p>The infection is generally transmitted by a dog <i>bite </i>rather than a kiss — but the man’s condition rapidly deteriorated over the next 30 hours. He developed severe sepsis and a vicious rash, as well as blotching and bruising.</p>
      <p>Despite intensive care, the condition metastasized to his kidneys, causing liver failure along with skin rotting and blood clotting, <a href="https://7news.com.au/lifestyle/pets/dog-owner-dies-after-contracting-rare-infection-that-rotted-his-skin-after-being-licked-c-573262">7 News reports</a>. Eventually, he suffered cardiac arrest.</p>
      <p>Although the patient was “successfully resuscitated,” his condition eventually deteriorated to the point that his family shut off life support, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/man-dies-after-contracting-rare-20943567">reports the Mirror.</a> He died 16 days after his admission to the hospital.</p>
      <p>Doctors found the man’s case particularly vexing as he didn’t present the “immunodeficiency, splenectomy or alcohol abuse” associated with a fatal infection of Capnocytophaga canimorsus, the science journal reports.</p>
      <p>Plus, the infection is so rare it infects less around four in 1 million people annually, <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/24/12/17-2060_article">according to the CDC</a>.</p>
      <p>But this is far from the first case of a life-threatening illness incurred by kissing canines.</p>
      <p>Over the summer, an Ohio woman was forced to <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/08/01/dog-saliva-infection-leaves-ohio-woman-without-arms-legs/">have her arms and legs amputated</a> after being infected by her pup’s saliva.</p>
      <p>In 2018, two different Wisconsinites contracted the infection from their pet dogs’ saliva — one man required <a href="https://nypost.com/2018/07/31/man-has-all-limbs-amputated-after-dogs-lick-leads-to-infection/">all of his limbs amputated</a> as a result, and <a href="https://nypost.com/2018/08/10/woman-dies-from-infection-after-shes-nipped-by-new-puppy/">the other died</a>. And a mother of two <a href="https://nypost.com/2014/08/04/mom-dies-because-pet-dog-licked-her-hand/">died from septic shock</a> in 2014 after her pet terrier infected her via a small cut on her hand.</p>
      <p>Alas, the<a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/24/12/17-2060_article"> CDC advises</a> that these rare cases don’t mean you have to to fear your dogs — but researchers do warn “pet owners with flu-like, symptoms to urgently seek medical advice when symptoms are unusual.”</p>
