      <p>Forget the Coca Cola truck because tonight the Cadbury bus has rolled into Bristol offering chocolate fans a chance to send a surprise gift to a special someone for free.</p>
      <p>The Cadbury Secret Santa Postal Service has come to our city as part of its UK tour covering 10 places.</p>
      <p>Lines of people are queueing in the city centre, on <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-city-centre">St Augustine's Parade,</a> for their chance to post a treat.</p>
      <p>People can pick between Cadbury Dairy Milk, Cadbury Dairy Milk Whole Nut, Cadbury Dairy Milk Caramel, Cadbury Dairy Milk Fruit and Nut or Cadbury Dairy Milk Oreo.</p>

      <p>But you'll have to rush because the service is only there until 7pm tonight (November 25).</p>
      <p>A spokesperson said: "Cadbury Secret Santa Postal Services will be springing up to spread festive cheer across the country. Pop along to post a free Cadbury treat to your favourite person at our Cadbury Secret Santa Postal Service."</p>
      <p>For anyone who misses out today, if you purchase a Cadbury bar from WHSmith you will be able to post the gift for free.</p>
