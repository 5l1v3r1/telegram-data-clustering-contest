      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/nicole-kidman">Nicole Kidman</a> shared a rare photo of her 11-year-old daughter Sunday Rose over the weekend.</p>
      <p>The Oscar-winning actress, 52, tends to keep her personal life away from social media, but took to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> on Sunday to share a glimpse at her spending quality family time with her daughter.</p>
      <p>The adorable snap shows the mother and daughter enjoying some quality bonding time during a cold, wintry walk through the park.</p>
      <p>The sun appeared to be gleaming through the trees as Nicole and Sunday Rose explored the wintry outdoors and colourful, falling autumnal foliage.</p>
      <p>She captioned the sweet photo: "Sunday walk with Sunday #MotherDaughter #Happiness."</p>

      <p>Nicole married Mission Impossible star Tom in 1990, a year after the pair met on the sets of ‘Days of Thunder’.</p>
      <p>They split in 2001, with their adopted children choosing to stay with Tom and within the Scientology faith.</p>
      <p>Tom is an outspoken advocate for the Church of Scientology, having become involved with the faith through his first wife, Mimi Rogers.</p>

      <p>Nicole last spoke of her two eldest children back in 2018, amid rumours of a rift after she snubbed them in an Emmys acceptance speech thanking her family, when she addressed their commitment to Scientology.</p>
      <p>A-lister Nicole has a busy work schedule at the moment with new movie Bombshell set to hit cinemas in December and three other acting projects which Nicole is producing.</p>
