      <p>When she was just one day old, Maddy Hopson's parents were told to prepare for her funeral. She was born three months prematurely, with sepsis, and a bleed on the brain resulted in her having cerebral palsy-a group of lifelong conditions that affect movement and co-ordination.</p>
      <p>Amazingly, baby Maddy defied the odds- but the challenges for her and her family continued throughout her early years.</p>
      <p>Now 22 years old, Maddy who lives in Sheepstor, said: "When I was two years old my parents were told I'd never walk or talk."</p>

      <p>When her parents eventually moved from her birth place of Munich, to the UK, Maddy became increasingly interested in sport- something that would put her on a path to becoming a UK diving trailblazer.</p>
      <p>Maddy had been horse-riding since the age of seven, but it wasn't until her family moved to Devon when she was fourteen, that she began to compete in regional and national dressage events.</p>
      <p>She attended Stover School in Newton Abbot, where she also took part in the Ten Tors Jubilee hiking challenge.</p>
      <p>But it was in 2012, that Maddy saw world champion diver, Tom Daley on TV, and was inspired. She said: "I was watching him train and thinking, 'I could do it."</p>

      <p>Maddy met Tom in 2013 and said: "I was really starstruck but he was really nice."</p>
      <p>Due to a lack of confidence, it took Maddy 10 years to learn how to swim, but she just kept on going. She said: "I was like, 'I'm going to do this,' and obviously, it's a life skill."</p>
      <p>Maddy's determination paid off, she is now the UK's first diving coach with cerebral palsy, and has her sights set on paralympic glory.</p>
      <p>She said: "My main aim is to get diving in the paralympics and see what happens."  </p>
      <p>Maddy currently teaches children to dive, and has had interest in her skills around the world. She said: "I went to San Diego for a month to teach other disabled divers.</p>

      <p>"In the future, I'd like to work in Austria or Germany, because they have the Paralympic Committee." She is currently learning German to be able to do so.</p>
      <p>In the mean time, the determined young diver has been proving yet more people wrong. At the age of seven, Maddy's parents were told she'd never go to university, but this year she graduated in sports development from Marjon University.</p>

      <p>She said: "It was amazing. I found uni really hard academically."  Maddy's family and friends were behind her all the way, and her university tutor, Phil Brown. She said: "Marjon was really supportive, and my coach- everyone at uni was just amazing."</p>
      <p>Maddy also worked as a student ambassador at Marjon, hoping to inspire others, she said: "I was asked to be a student speaker- that I never dreamed of. Speaking in front of 500 people is daunting, but I really enjoyed it. I was the first student to receive a standing ovation.</p>
      <p>"If someone says you can't do anything don't be put off- try and go for it- you can adapt so many things. I think everyone is amazed how well I've done."</p>
