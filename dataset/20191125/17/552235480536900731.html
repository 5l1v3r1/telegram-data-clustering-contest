      <p>An iconic Kilmarnock pub has closed its doors to the public.</p>
      <p>The Howard Arms at Glencairn Square, on the corner of West Shaw Street and High Glencairn Street, had its final night operating in its current form last night.</p>
      <p>The current lease agreement has not been renewed, and the brewers in charge of the building are still looking for new management.</p>
      <p>As it stands the pub will remain closed for the foreseeable future, with no estimated reopening date.</p>
      <p>The pub is advertised 'to let' on <a href="https://www.starpubs.co.uk/pubs/howard-arms-kilmarnock">Star Pubs and Bars.</a></p>
      <p>The advert says: "The newly refurbished Howard Arms will appeal to a broad range of customers in the local area, establishing itself as a community hub.</p>
      <p>"Located on a prominent main road just outside of Kilmarnock town centre and in close proximity to supermarkets and a variety of shops, the Howard Arms benefits from high passing footfall.</p>
      <p>"Its position next to the local Kilmarnock Football Club ensures great trading on match days, whilst the improved offer will extend its appeal throughout quieter periods. <br/><br/>"A wide variety of premium drinks including beer, cider, coffee and soft drinks will make the Howard Arms indispensable to the local area.</p>
      <p>"The new, improved food offer, supported by the attractive lounge and dining area, and family-friendly covered beer garden will see the pub become a welcoming and versatile venue for the entire community."</p>
