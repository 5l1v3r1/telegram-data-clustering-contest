      <p>A Simon Fraser University student has started a fundraiser to hire a charter bus to take people to the Burnaby campus ahead of a full shutdown of Metro Vancouver’s bus and SeaBus system Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The shutdown is set to run Wednesday to Friday this week and comes as negotiations between the Coast Mountain Bus Company and the union representing its workers remain broken down.</p>
      <p>Grayson Lee created the fundraiser after his post in a SFU carpooling group on Facebook received traction.</p>
      <p>“I’m thinking of renting a 50 seater bus to go from production up and down the mountain on Wed – Fri between school hours, if there’s enough interest. It’d cost between 3-4$ per trip (much cheaper than the $15 cab ride). If you are interested please comment below,” Lee wrote on Nov. 21.</p>
      <p>The post had 28 comments and 79 likes as of Monday morning, and <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/donate-for-a-bus-up-to-sfu-from-sky-train">a GoFundMe page</a> was set up Sunday.</p>
      <p>The fundraiser aims to raise $3,000 for the charter bus, which Lee said the company would require upfront.</p>
      <p>“I do not have the funds to make that payment by myself. I’m hoping for SFU alumni’s, students, and anyone who this impacts, if they could pitch in whether $2, $5, any donation counts to cover the expenses of the bus, as otherwise we not able to make this a reality,” Lee wrote.</p>
      <p>The bus would run from Wednesday to Friday at peak school hours, which Lee defines as 7:30 a.m. to 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. to 6 p.m.</p>
      <p>As of Monday morning, $150 has been raised.</p>
