      <p>Boris Johnson yesterday stood by a Tory manifesto claim to increase numbers of nurses by 50,000 despite a Cabinet minister admitting that there had been some "confusion" over the figure.</p>
      <p>The party's general election manifesto committed the Conservatives to funding "50,000 more nurses" over the next five years, one of two headline announcements in the policy document.</p>
      <p>The pledge will increase nursing numbers from 280,000 to 330,000 by 2024/5. But the "new" figure is just 31,500 new posts comprising 14,000 newly trained nurses, 5,000 nursing apprentices and 12,500 nurses from overseas. </p>
      <p>The remaining 18,500 will be nurses who have been persuaded not to leave the profession or have returned to practice after a career break.</p>
      <p>Pressed on the figure, Nicky Morgan, the Culture secretary, admitted that some people had thought the pledge meant 50,000 new nurses will be hired.</p>
      <p>Unveiling a campaign poster in Westminster, Ms Morgan said: "I think there's been a confusion sometimes, people reading that as 50,000 new nurses.</p>
      <p>"I think sometimes that's a deliberate confusion and sometimes that's just a genuine misreading of the manifesto."</p>
      <p>Unveiling the Tories' Welsh manifesto in Wrexham, Mr Johnson said: "Those nurses who would otherwise not be retained will be retained - that is a great thing."</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson also faced the embarrassment after telling activists at them manifesto launch on Sunday that "we will ensure" Telford hospital's accident and emergency department would be stay open.</p>
      <p>This was almost immediately contradicted by Health Secretary Matt Hancock, who confirmed the A&amp;E would in fact be closing and will be replaced by an A&amp;E Local - only operating during 'core hours'.</p>
