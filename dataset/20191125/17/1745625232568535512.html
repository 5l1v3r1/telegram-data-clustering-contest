      <h3>Lais Ribeiro Shows Off Plenty Of Skin In Throwback Photo Shared By ‘Maxim’</h3>

      <p><i>Maxim</i> magazine shared a throwback photo of Lais Ribeiro from her cover shoot to its verified <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/instagram/">Instagram</a> page, and her fans are loving it.</p>
      <p>Over the weekend, the magazine took to the popular social media app to post the black-and-white snapshot in which Ribeiro flaunts quite a bit of skin in a sexy outfit that showcases her insane figure. In the photo, Ribeiro — who was featured on the cover of <i><a href="https://www.maxim.com/women/lais-ribeiro-september-october-cover-girl-2018-8">Maxim</a></i> for its September/October 2018 issue — is posing against a dark backdrop in a studio in New York, as the geotag included with the post indicates. The photo was captured for world-renowned fashion photographer Gilles Bensimon.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/5745042/lais-ribeiro-neon-orange-bikini/">Ribeiro</a> rocked a white top with thick straps that go over her shoulders and plunging sides that bare most of her ribcage and back. The top also leaves quite a bit of sideboob on display. The tank also boasts a textured fabric that gives the top a semi sheer quality, though it is still solid enough to cover her chest. Ribeiro teamed her top with a pair of denim bottoms that feature different textures, buttons and straps.</p>
      <p>The Brazilian bombshell — who is best known for her work as a Victoria’s Secret Angel and as a <i>Sports Illustrated</i> swimsuit model — posed with both of her arms by her head, which further showcases her torso.</p>

      <p>Within about a day of being published, the post – which <i>Maxim</i> shared with its 925,000 Instagram followers — has garnered more than 8,700 likes, as of the time of this writing. The same time period also brought in upwards of 30 comments to the photo.</p>
      <p>Users of the social media platform who are fans of the magazine — and of the model — took to the comments section to praise Ribeiro’s beauty and to compliment Bensimon’s aesthetics.</p>

      <p>“So Yummy,” wrote one fan, including a sunflower, a fire and a 100 mark emoji at the end of the comment.</p>
      <p>“Simple &amp; sexy!” said another fan, following the words with the OK hand sign.</p>
      <p>In the accompanying interview for <i>Maxim,</i> Ribeiro opened up about leaving her small town in northern Brazil to pursue a career in modeling in New York without knowing any English and having to leave her son behind temporarily.</p>
      <p>“I saw the whole entire world when I first came here,” she told <i>Maxim</i>. “I saw snow, taxis, how to take the train. It was incredible.”</p>
