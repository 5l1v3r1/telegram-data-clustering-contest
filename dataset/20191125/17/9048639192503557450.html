      <p><b>CALDWELL PARISH, La. (KNOE) - </b>The Caldwell Parish Sheriff's Office has a warning for local businesses.</p>
      <p>They say counterfeit bills are being passed in the area.</p>
      <p>They published the warning Monday afternoon along with some example counterfeit bills.</p>
      <p>Many of the counterfeit bills have words like "motion picture use only" or have Chinese characters on them, but some words or characters can be hard to spot.</p>
      <p>If someone passes you counterfeit money, the sheriff's office asks that you safely obtain any information about the individuals passing the bills and contact them at 649-2345.</p>
      <p>It's important to note that if you lose real money and wind up with counterfeit money, you will be stuck with the counterfeit money. The Federal Reserve says they will not replace your lost money.</p>
