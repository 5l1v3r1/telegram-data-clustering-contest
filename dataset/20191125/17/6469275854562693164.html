      <p>Two of Myers’ victims were women from the Preston area, and another was from Radcliffe, Manchester.</p>
      <p>Lancashire Trading Standards launched a probe after the complaints came to light.</p>
      <p>Examples of his offending include describing the need for work to window lintels at a home on Greenbank Street, Preston, as “urgent” - even though the work was later found to be unnecessary.</p>
      <p>The 48-year-old also failed to give his customers information about their right to cancel their contracts with him.</p>
      <p>In addition, he admits providing fake business addresses on ‘invoices’.</p>
      <p>In another case, Myers committed fraud by false representation by saying he would replace a woman’s gate and supply a chiminea for £695.</p>
      <p>The case comes a year after he was jailed for 24 weeks in St Helens, Merseyside, for similar trading offences.</p>
