      <p>Rachel Harris, Alderman of Dudley, passed away at the weekend after a short illness.</p>
      <p>She served as a councillor for 25 years before stepping down this year.</p>
      <p>She last served the Brierley Hill ward, and before that represented Belle Vale and Hasbury, and Kingswinford South.</p>
      <p>Alongside being an alderman - which is next in line to being a mayor - she was a cabinet member with a portfolio for procurement, transformation and commercialisation, as well as health and wellbeing.</p>
      <p>Paying tribute, Dudley Council leader Patrick Harley said: "Our thoughts are with Rachel’s family and friends at this very sad time.</p>
      <p>"Today we are grieving the loss of a colleague who brought great energy and passion to Dudley Council and I would like to personally pay tribute to Rachel and everything she gave to this borough."</p>
      <p>Councillor Qadar Zada, Labour group leader at Dudley Council, said: "I worked very closely with Alderman Harris when she was a councillor, as we had a mutual concern for health inequalities, and I often found myself tapping into her wealth of knowledge and spent several hours debating health policy.</p>
      <p>"There is much to say about Rachel’s many achievements over the years she served as a councillor, but I was particularly proud to have campaigned for her as Parliamentary Candidate in Dudley South in 2010.</p>
      <p>"She was a community campaigner and public servant and retained her interest in issues affecting Dudley people after her retirement from the council and throughout her illness. It was for this dedication, beyond the call of duty, that I recommended that she be made an alderman.</p>
      <p>"Everyone in the group will miss her and we are sad to have lost a friend. Our condolences go to husband Phil and her family."</p>
