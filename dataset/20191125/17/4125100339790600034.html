      <p>“Not too pretty, sieg heil, pfannkuchen (pancake),” he said, using the Nazi German salute.</p>
      <p>“It was not my intention at all to shock people. I only wanted to ‘explain’ Hans’ German,” a contrite Van Basten said.</p>
      <p>Fox said his pay for the week “will be paid to the Netherlands Institute for War Documentation, in order to promote knowledge of the history of the Second World War.”</p>
