      <h1>King’s Cross is getting a New Orleans-themed food hall and hangout</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T17:43:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 17:43</time> by <a rel="author">By El Hunt</a></address>
      <p>At first glance, <a href="https://www.timeout.com/london/things-to-do/kings-cross-area-guide">King’s Cross</a> doesn’t have a lot in common with the American South: the closest you’re likely to get is the barbecue sauce aisle in the truly humungous branch of Waitrose. But from early next year, the area will have a new food market and bar with a Deep South feel courtesy of Ben Lovett, whom you may know as one quarter of Mumford &amp; Sons.</p>
      <p>The musician opened Southwark music venue <a href="https://www.timeout.com/london/music/omeara">Omeara</a> back in 2016, and also runs the neighbouring <a href="https://www.timeout.com/london/things-to-do/flat-iron-square">Flat Iron Square</a>. Continuing a running theme, his new creation Goods Way will be tucked underneath <a href="https://www.timeout.com/london/news/just-announced-lafayette-is-a-new-live-music-venue-opening-in-kings-cross-100219">Lovett’s second live venue, Layfette</a>. It looks like your pre-gig grub is about to get a serious upgrade, thanks to The Courtyard: a glass-fronted food hall hosting a revolving line-up of top-notch nosh. The first wave of traders includes <a href="https://www.timeout.com/london/restaurants/breddos-tacos-1">Breddos Tacos</a> and <a href="https://www.timeout.com/london/restaurants/duck-truck">The Duck Truck</a>.</p>
      <p>On top of that, King’s Cross is also getting its own Deep South-inspired saloon, in the shape of Sweetwater: a dimly lit watering hole that aims to channel the Mississippi Delta vibe. The whole complex is set to open next February and will be just across the canal from <a href="https://www.timeout.com/london/attractions/granary-square">Granary Square</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.timeout.com/london/blog/33-sweet-things-youll-see-when-you-walk-along-regents-canal-082416">Regent’s Cana</a>l might be a far cry from Louisiana, but who knows – with a chilled Sazerac in hand, you might just be transported.</p>
