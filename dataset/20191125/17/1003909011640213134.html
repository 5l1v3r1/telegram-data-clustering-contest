      <h1>Promoter of 'hyperloop' between Calgary and Edmonton hopes to get province on board</h1>

      <p>Proponents of a privately funded magnetic tube link that could zip passengers from Calgary to Edmonton in 30 minutes hope the province comes on board with the concept.</p>
      <p>They say the previous NDP government had offered up land to host a 10-kilometre test line along the west side of Highway 2 between Olds and Didsbury for the so-called hyperloop, something their UCP successors have ignored.</p>
      <p>“We can’t get any traction or interest from the province,” said Sebastien Gendron, CEO of France-based TransPod.</p>
      <p>When he presented the proposal to Alberta’s premier while he was stumping for federal Conservative candidates in Ontario earlier this fall, Jason Kenney rolled his eyes, said Gendron.</p>
      <p>But there’s nothing pie-in-the-sky about the concept that could fulfill an<a href="https://calgaryherald.com/pmn/business-pmn/canadian-hyperloop-company-says-governments-need-to-support-innovation/wcm/90e84b2e-980f-46e2-8180-bd84f0472208"> oft-recurring dream in Alberta</a> to link its two major cities with a high-speed rail connection, he said.</p>
      <p>A letter of support from the provincial government would unleash $100 million to $200 million in private investment funds to build the test line, the success of which could lead to the construction of the entire $6 billion to $8 billion system before 2030, said Gendron.</p>

      <p>“It’s a fair deal. We’re not asking for public money from the province … There’s no risk,” he said, adding he’s headed to Alberta next week to drum up backing for the idea.</p>
      <p>“We’re only looking for a letter of support from the provincial government.”</p>
      <p>While the NDP government showed some interest in the concept, TransPod and its investors balked when the province demanded the test line be dismantled after its use — infrastructure the company wants to incorporate into any finished network, said Gendron.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The technology — first brainstormed by futurist entrepreneur Elon Musk in 2013 — would consist of two steel tubes elevated on concrete footings that would propel magnetically-levitated pods at speeds rivalling those of jet airliners, said Gendron.</p>
      <p>“It’s essentially an aircraft without wings,” he said.</p>
      <p>The line would shave five hours off of the six-hour round trip between the two cities, says TransPod.</p>

      <p>Its blueprint calls for stations in downtown Calgary, the city’s airport, Red Deer and Edmonton International Airport, he said.</p>
      <p>The Edmonton-to-Calgary corridor represents an ideal route for such a line, given the flat, thinly-populated landscape, said Gendron, but one with a large enough population to make it economically feasible.</p>
      <p>“It would require a minimum of 5 to 6 million passengers a year but the ridership’s there; it would be filled immediately,” he said, adding the hyperloop would supplement its revenue by moving specialty and e-commerce cargo.</p>
      <p>All told, it would boost a struggling provincial economy by directly creating 14,500 jobs when fully operational, said TransPod.</p>
      <p>But while Gendron said the concept has shown promise in a lab, it’s yet to be proven on a real scale.</p>
      <p>To that end, the European Union has offered $30 million CDN for research and development, while the Alberta project would be funded partly by the Canada Infrastructure Fund and pension funds, said Gendron.</p>
      <p>In 2018, the company suggested the city’s $100 million economic development fund would have been a natural fit for the proposal but nothing came of that.</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman for Alberta Transportation said the department hasn’t received a proposal from TransPod, but added, “We look forward to reviewing it if and when we receive it.”</p>
