      <h1>Tony Cascarino takes aim at Roberto after West Ham’s weekend loss to Tottenham</h1>
      <h2>Cascarino can’t understand why David Martin hasn’t been handed a chance.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T17:15:27+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 17:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/sam-preston/" target="_blank">Sam Preston</a></address>
      <p>Tony Cascarino criticised West Ham goalkeeper Roberto after another nervous display in the 3-2 home defeat against London rivals Tottenham.</p>
      <p>Cascarino says he will be asking reserve stopper David Martin’s dad Alvin what his son needs to do to get into the Hammers team, as per the <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/sport/weekend-talking-points-unai-emery-speaks-in-riddles-how-can-he-motivate-arsenal-team-ztmdrncpz">Times</a>.</p>
      <p>He <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/sport/weekend-talking-points-unai-emery-speaks-in-riddles-how-can-he-motivate-arsenal-team-ztmdrncpz">said</a>: “I’m doing a gig with Alvin Martin on Thursday and I’ll be asking him what on earth his son David has to do to get in the West Ham team. With Lukasz Fabianski out injured, Martin is on the bench. He’s been kept out by Roberto and I’m not sure I’ve ever seen a worse goalkeeper in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>“Game after game he’s making mistake after mistake. He’s been so poor I don’t know why he’s keeping his place. Martin may be 33 and he may have spent most of his career away from the top flight with MK Dons, but he must be a more solid option.”</p>

      <h3>TBR’s View – Martin would surely offer West Ham more confidence right now</h3>
      <p>It’s not often that a goalkeeper as lacking in Premier League experience as Martin could be viewed as an improvement in terms of confidence but that’s the case now.</p>
      <p>Roberto is now a liability, spreading panic through the fans and his team-mates and opponents are now targeting in the hope of forcing a mistake.</p>
      <p>Martin has to come into the frame, at least to ease some of the pressure on the Spaniard at the moment.</p>
