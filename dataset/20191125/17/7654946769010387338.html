      <p>A Texas woman found dead in a front yard may have been killed by wild hogs, according to a report.</p>
      <p>Christine Rollins’ body was discovered Sunday morning outside of an Anahuac home, where she was the caretaker for an elderly couple, according to the Chambers County Sheriff’s Office.</p>
      <p>When Rollins, 59, didn’t show up for work, her employer went outside and found her body in the front yard, officials said.</p>
      <p>Rollins had animal-related injuries, as well as ones consistent with a fall, Sheriff Brian Hawthorne said in a statement.</p>
      <p>“At this time detectives are unable to determine if she collapsed due to a medical condition and the fall caused the head injury, or if the animals may have caused the fall and contributed to her death,” Hawthorne said. “But, at this time, we have no reason to believe that there is any foul play involved in her death.”</p>
      <p>Neighbors have complained about wild hogs in the area, and the homeowners’ Corgis are also being eyed, according to <a href="https://abc13.com/possible-animal-attack-leaves-woman-dead-in-chambers-county-yard/5716849/">news station KTRK-TV.</a></p>
      <p>An autopsy was ordered to determine her cause of death, officials said.</p>
