      <p>Without revealing anything specific about Maggie's future, Kang said, "I’m just excited to kind of write her next chapter because she’s just a lovely human being and a really compelling character, too, I think."</p>

      <p>Kang also spoke about Dani Gurira's last season playing fan favorite character Michonne and what this means for the future of the show. She promised there is still more to come for Michonne in the second half of the show, and her departure is the result of careful mapping on the part of Kang and the show's writers.</p>
      <p><i>The Walking Dead</i> stars Norman Reedus, Danai Gurira, Melissa McBride, Josh McDermitt, Christian Serratos, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Seth Gilliam, Ross Marquand, Khary Payton, Cooper Andrews, Avi Nash, and Samantha Morton. The midseason finale will air Sunday at 9 p.m. ET/PT on AMC.</p>
