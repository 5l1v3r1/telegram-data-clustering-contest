      <h1>OnePlus Confirms a Second Data Breach in as Many Years</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T17:00:33+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 17:00</time> by <a rel="author">Shabana Arif</a></address>
      <p>OnePlus warns customers that their personal details "may have been exposed" but that payment details, passwords, and accounts are safe.</p>
      <p>The company confirmed the news in a <a href="https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/security-notification.1144088/">forum post</a>, although affected users were reportedly contacted before it went public with the announcement. The data breach saw names, phone numbers, email, and shipping addresses accessed by a hacker, and as such, OnePlus has warned  customers that they may get an influx of spam and phishing emails as a result.</p>
      <p>If you're a OnePlus customer and haven't received an email saying your details are out in the world, you're just fine by the sounds of things. For now, there are no steps to be taken. Just try not to fall for any scams or give away your bank details to every Tom, Dick, and Harry who asks for them.</p>
      <p>"While monitoring our systems, our security team discovered that some of our users' order information was accessed by an unauthorised party," explained the OnePlus security team, adding that "immediate steps" were taken to "stop the intruder and reinforce security, making sure there are no similar vulnerabilities."</p>
      <p>The last time this happened was January 2018, although it was worse than this instance, with as many as <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2018/01/oneplus-says-hack-exposed-credit-cards-of-up-to-40000-customers/">40,000 customers having their credit card information stolen by hackers</a>.</p>
      <p>OnePlus has apologised and said that it's "partnering with a world-renowned security platform next month, and will launch an official bug bounty program by the end of December," so fingers crossed, that's the last of it.
