      <p>While there are many wonderful things to look forward to as winter approaches, it can also bring with it a lot of ailments. As we move into the colder months, the threat of coughs, colds and flu, and viruses like the winter vomiting bug are always on the horizon! It’s important to prepare yourself for the winter season by keeping your energy levels charged and your immunity boosted.</p>
      <p>And as the dark evenings approach and the days get cooler, we start to feel a little sluggish because we’re inclined to stay in, move less and eat more. As a result, you might also notice your gut health beginning to suffer, as well as your skin.</p>
      <p>However balance is key and there are numerous ways to ensure your family stay happy and healthy throughout winter. Here are our top winter wellness heroes to keep your mind, body and soul nourished and in peak condition.</p>

      <h3>MorEPA Platinum</h3>
      <p>At Meaghers Pharmacy, one of the staff’s top recommended Omega 3 fish oils is MorEPA Platinum. Containing 1,000mg of EPA &amp; DHA per capsule, it’s one of the most potent fish oils on the market, while the pleasant orange flavour helps to prevent any fishy aftertaste commonly associated with conventional fish oil supplements. While Omega 3 is always recommended for heart, brain and eye health, it can also help promote healthy skin, especially during the winter months when the weather can be more extreme and lead to skin irritation and dryness. MorEPA Platinum also contains a high dose of Vitamin D which is important at this time of year with the absence of sunlight, making it a perfect supplement for overall health.</p>

      <h3>LifeLine Hangover Defence</h3>
      <p>There’s nothing like a good Christmas party, but let’s face it the festive season can get the best of us, especially when we’ve indulged in one too many glasses of bubbly.

LifeLine Hangover Defence is a unique supplement taken the night before; simply take two capsules, within one hour of your first drink, to defend against the hangover before it kicks in. It contains activated charcoal which is highly effective in absorbing the toxins and impurities found in alcoholic beverages, while Vitamins B and C reduce tiredness and fatigue, improve energy release and mental performance to support your body in its attempts to combat the effects of alcohol consumption.</p>
