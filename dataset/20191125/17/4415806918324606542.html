      <p>If you like your sneakers and you know your luxury fashion, you’re going to love the new Adidas x Prada collaboration.</p>
      <p>After weeks of teasing a joint project together, the Italian fashion house and German sportswear giant have unveiled a brand new pair of ‘Prada Superstar’ trainers – Adidas’ trademark shell toe trainer with a navy Prada logo stitched onto the sides.</p>

      <p>As well as the super minimal pair of limited edition sneakers, the two-piece collection also features a white Prada for Adidas bowling bag with navy piping.</p>
      <p>The Superstar sneaker, originally launched in 1969, has long been a firm favourite of the style set – everyone from Kylie Jenner to Gigi Hadid has been spotted wearing them.</p>

      <p>The launch of the collaboration coincides with the trainer’s 50th anniversary  – it was originally designed as a low-top basketball shoe.</p>
      <p>Only 700 of each have been produced, with both having been embossed with a unique serial.</p>

      <p>Prices haven’t yet been released, but if you’re keen to get your hands on the duo, you’ll have to act fast. They will retail online through <a href="https://www.adidas.co.uk/">adidas.com</a> and <a href="https://www.prada.com/gb/en.html">prada.com</a>, and at selected Prada stores worldwide from December 4.</p>
      <p>One thing’s for sure, these are not trainers you wear on a muddy dog walk…</p>
