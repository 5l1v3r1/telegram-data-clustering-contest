      <h1>Les Miles puts faith in his Jayhawk offense</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T17:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 17:00</time> by <a rel="author">Berry Tramel</a></address>
      <p>Les Miles is known as the Mad Hatter for good reason. He has made unorthodox calls for two decades. Saturday, the Kansas coach made another one. Facing 4<sup>th</sup>-and-5 from the Jayhawk 37-yard line, trailing Iowa State 34-31 with 5:03 left in the game, Miles disdained a punt.</p>
      <p>Iowa State’s Anthony Johnson broke up a pass by KU quarterback Carter Stanley, and the Cyclones drove to a game-sealing touchdown in their 41-31 victory.</p>
      <p>“I felt like our quarterback and our receivers and the offense was in gear,” Miles said. “Very manageable fourth down, and I believed in our kids. The way for us to win that game was to take that drive down the field, with plenty of time, with the opportunity to kick (or) to score six … I think that was the way to win it.”</p>
      <p>Miles said he watched Texas A&amp;M-Georgia on Saturday – the Aggies punted, down six, with 4:26 left in the game from the Georgia 43-yard line, on a 4<sup>th</sup>-and-11. A&amp;M never got the ball back.</p>
      <p>“I just could not fathom not putting the ball in our hands one more time,” Miles said.</p>
