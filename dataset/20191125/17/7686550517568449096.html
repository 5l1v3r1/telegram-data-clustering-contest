      <p>Here are your latest rugby evening headlines.</p>
      <p>
        <b>All Black greats call for Super Rugby to be scrapped</b>
      </p>
      <p>New Zealand legend Andrew Mehrtens has called for the current Super Rugby format to be scrapped in order for New Zealand and Australia to explore the Asian market.</p>
      <p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.espn.com.au/rugby/story/_/id/28151804/super-rugby-dump-south-africa-look-asia-andrew-mehrtens-says">ESPN</a> , Mehrtens said he had a solution for New Zealand to prevent their star players from signing lucrative deals in Europe.</p>
      <p>"Going forward if we push into Asia, if we can develop a competition that's in the same time zone I think it's going to be a better product," Mehrtens said.</p>
      <p>"I've said for a long time, we need to drop South Africa - as much as I love South Africa - logistically it's a pain in the a***, same with Argentina. Argentina needs to go up their time zone with the USA; South Africa probably start developing franchises in Dubai or somewhere there, but I think our push is into Asia."</p>

        <b>Australia chasing England attack guru</b>
      </p>
      <p>England coach Eddie Jones is facing a battle to hold on to attack specialist Scott Wisemantel, with new Australia boss Dave Rennie reportedly keen on his services.</p>
      <p>Wisemantel has been working with England since May 2018, being involved in the turnaround in form that saw them reach the World Cup final. His contract with the RFU is now up and, according to <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/news/england-attack-guru-wisemantel-now-talking-with-rugby-australia-reports">RugbyPass</a> , the Wallabies are interested in nabbing him.</p>
      <p>The report claims that Australia's director of rugby Scott Johnson has made it clear that he wants a group of Australian coaches to support Rennie - with Wisemantel potentially one of them.</p>

        <b>Brian Moore condemns 'dross' served up at Welsh European encounter</b>
      </p>
      <p>Brian Moore has hit out at the <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/rugby/rugby-news/brian-moore-condemns-dross-served-17310979">“dross served up”</a> at the Arms Park over the weekend amid a damning assessment of the second-tier European Challenge Cup.</p>
      <p>Leicester put out a second string for <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/rugby/rugby-news/cardiff-blues-leicester-live-score-17306224">the clash with Cardiff Blues</a> , while the region were not allowed to field World Cup stars Josh Adams, Tomos Williams and Dillon Lewis due to the WRU rest policy. The end result was a poor quality contest which saw the English club edge out 14-11 victors.</p>
      <p>And former England hooker Moore used that match to make a bigger point about the problems with the Challenge Cup.</p>
      <p>"If you had the misfortune to watch that game, you will have seen a handful of Cardiff’s best and almost none of the Tigers’ star players,” he said in his <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rugby-union/2019/11/25/something-needs-done-europes-secondary-cup-clubs-view-irritant/">Telegraph column</a> .</p>
      <p>“If you bill this as a bona fide European Cup tie, you are short-changing paying fans, sponsors and broadcasters, all of whom pay to support rugby, when you produce the sort of dross served up last Saturday night at the Arms Park.</p>
      <p>“If one of these games is your first experience of rugby, as a fan and especially a sponsor who has invited customers, you are going to think long and hard about repeating the venture."</p>

        <b>Alun Wyn Jones nominated for Sports Personality of the Year</b>
      </p>
      <p>Wales captain Alun Wyn Jones has been nominated for <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/sports-personality-of-the-year-17310383">BBC Sports Personality of the Year</a> .</p>
      <p>Jones finds himself on a shortlist with the great and the good of British sport after a year that saw him lead Wales to a Grand Slam and World Cup semi-final.</p>
      <p>England cricket star Ben Stokes, British sprinter Dina Asher-Smith, England footballer Raheem Sterling, F1 world champions Lewis Hamilton and heptathlon world champion Katarina Johnson-Thompson are the other nominees.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Scotland international considering move to South Africa</b>
      </p>
      <p>Scotland centre Huw Jones is reportedly contemplating a return to South Africa with Super Rugby franchise Stormers.</p>
      <p>The 25-year-old has struggled for minutes with club Glasgow Warriors, while he has slipped down the national team pecking order in the last 18-months.</p>
      <p>And, according to <a href="https://scrummagazine.com/jones-linked-with-return-to-south-africa/">SA Rugby Mag</a> , Jones is looking to move away from Scotstoun - likely to the Gallagher Premiership - but would be keen to spend some time back in South Africa with the Stormers in the meantime.</p>

        <b>The perfect analysis of Dan Biggar's moment of magic</b>
      </p>
      <p>Far be it from Brian O'Driscoll to miss a moment of pure skill on the rugby field.</p>
      <p>The former Ireland captain provided his fair share during a glittering career and is now making a living pointing them out as a pundit.</p>
      <p>So it's little surprise that O'Driscoll was suitably captivated by <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/rugby/rugby-news/brian-odriscolls-perfect-analysis-how-17311803">Dan Biggar's back-door pass</a> to set up winger Tom Collins in Northampton's Champions Cup win over Benetton.</p>
      <p>And the former centre recognised that this was merely more than just trickery from Biggar.</p>
      <p>“It’s the line that he runs," he said on BT Sport.</p>
      <p>“Rather than fading on the pass and inviting the defence to drift with him, what he did was attack it short.</p>
      <p>“He invites the defender in, making him think he’s going to challenge to the line himself.</p>
      <p>“As soon as he takes it to the line, that defender feels as though he’s going to carry.</p>
      <p>“That’s when he’s able to play it out the back and create a simple two-on-one.</p>
