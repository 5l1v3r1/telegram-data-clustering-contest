      <h2>Aston Villa meet Liverpool in the final eight of the Carabao Cup, with AVFC looking to spring a surprise against the league leaders</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T17:12:24+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 17:12</time> by <a rel="author">Ben Husband, https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/authors/ben-husband/</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool have confirmed that U23 coach Neil Critchley will take charge of a much changed squad when they take on <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa</a> in the Carabao Cup quarter final.</p>
      <p>The Reds are splitting their squad into two, with the more senior players flying out to Qatar to play in the Club World Cup.</p>

      <p>Villa face Liverpool in B6 on December 17, with Klopp leading out the rest of his players in the semi final of the Club World Cup 24 hours later.</p>
      <p>Crithcley will be in charge of a young squad, who have managed to navigate their way to the last eight of the domestic cup competition.</p>
      <p>A number of youngsters are expected to be involved against Villa, with Rhian Brewster, Caoimhin Kelleher, Sepp van den Berg, Curtis Jones and Harvey Elliott all set to be involved.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/liverpool-confirm-carabao-cup-manager-20958096">The Mirror</a> has claimed that Jurgen Klopp was keen to put some senior players in the squad for the Villa game, but the consensus from the playing squad was they would rather play in the ‘bigger’ competition.</p>
      <p>The side will be reminiscent of the one that beat Arsenal on penalties in the previous round after a remarkable 5-5 draw.</p>
      <p>Crfitchley has been shadowing Klopp in recent weeks in order for their preparations to be as close as normal.</p>
      <p>Villa also faced a very young Wolves team in the previous round. Nuno Espirito Santo made a whole host of changes, with Dean Smith’s men coming out as 2-1 winners.</p>
