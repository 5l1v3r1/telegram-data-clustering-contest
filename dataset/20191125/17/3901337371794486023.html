      <p>Griezmann was substituted off in the 57th minute of <a href="https://www.soccerladuma.co.za/news/articles/international/categories/laliga/laliga-report-leganes-v-fc-barcelona-23-november-2019/668050">Barca's 2-1 win at Leganes</a> on Saturday as the new signing once again failed to make an impact.</p>
      <p>During the off-season, it was claimed that Messi would have preferred Neymar's return to the Camp Nou over the signing of the France star, but the club favoured a move for Griezmann, who has since struggled to form a fruitful partnership with Luis Suarez and the Argentine.</p>
      <p>"I'm really shy and I'm not very good at talking to people," the former Atletico Madrid forward told <i>UEFA.com</i>.</p>
      <p>"I'm not the type of person to start conversations. But Leo, Luis and I are getting to know each other, and we've already gone for dinner together.</p>
      <p>"Our relationship will only improve over time, and it's clear that what happens will only make us feel more comfortable on the pitch."</p>

      <p>Griezmann also took the opportunity to praise Messi, saying he is a generational talent.</p>
      <p>"We won't see a player like him in the next 40 years," he added.</p>
      <p>"What he does is incredible.</p>
      <p>"It's a real delight to see him play."</p>
