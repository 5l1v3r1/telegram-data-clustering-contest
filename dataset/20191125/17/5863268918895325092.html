      <p>ISLAMABAD (Dunya News) – Former military ruler and Interior ministry on Monday requested the Islamabad High Court to stop a special court from announcing its verdict in a high treason case against Pervez Musharraf.</p>
      <p>The special court had reserved its verdict on November 19 and said that it will be announced on November 28.</p>
      <p>In its petition, the interior ministry requested that the verdict in the high treason case by special court be stopped until a new prosecution team is formed.</p>
      <p>It further asked IHC to annul the announcement of verdict in high treason case by special court.</p>
      <p>Former military dictator Pervez Musharraf has separately asked the court to suspend the special court’s reserved verdict until his lawyer is given the opportunity to submit his stance.</p>
      <p>Musharraf was indicted in the case in March 2014 for suspending the Constitution in 2007. In 2016, he left to seek medical treatment in Dubai and hasn’t returned since.</p>
      <p>In October, the government had sacked the entire prosecution team formed by the previous PML-N government.</p>
      <p>On October 24, the interior ministry de-notified the prosecution and constitutional teams, as well as the research assistant working on the high treason case against Musharraf. The notification said that the step was taken under Section 4-A of the Central Law Officers Ordinance, 1970, which deals with appointments made by the president. It says that the services of the teams have been “disengaged”.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, IHC has set application to postpone the verdict for hearing.</p>
      <p>Full bench if IHC comprising Chief Justice Athar Minallah, Justice Amir Farooq and Justice Mohsin Akhter Kiani would hear the case on Tuesday at 12:30 PM.</p>
