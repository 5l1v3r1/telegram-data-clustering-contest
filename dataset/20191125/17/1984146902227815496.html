      <h1>Freddie Woodman reveals the condition Newcastle demanded for him to go on loan</h1>
      <h2>Newcastle United goalkeeper Freddie Woodman is impressing on loan at Swansea and is even targeting an England call</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T17:05:07+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 17:05</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Douglas</a></address>
      <p>Freddie Woodman has spoken of his desire to play for England – and get a call-up from godfather Gareth Southgate – as his impressive form for Swansea continues to catch the eye.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/swansea-boss-confident-newcastle-united-17188239">Woodman has been in fine form for Swansea</a> , who are in the top six in the Championship despite a loss to Millwall on Saturday. He played six times for England under-21s but at 22, he is now focusing on a potential senior call-up and honing his skills while out on loan in the Championship.</p>
      <p>Having missed out on a big loan move last season as the club blocked a transfer after failing to agree a contract extension, a resolution was agreed this close season which saw him move to Swansea. That came as a relief to Woodman, who found himself a frustrated bystander for long spells last term.</p>
      <p>Although he played in FA Cup games against Watford and Blackburn, he needed regular football to progress. The agreement this summer means he’s contracted to Newcastle until 2021 and Woodman told BBC Sport he is delighted with that.</p>
      <p>“In order to get the loan move I signed an extension,” he says. “I am happy with that. Newcastle are a massive club and they have looked after me.”</p>
      <p>Woodman told the BBC that he got a message of support from Southgate after making the move.</p>
      <p>“He was delighted like everyone,” Woodman said.</p>
      <p>“I don’t speak to him as much these days but I would see him when I was away with England Under-21s. It was strictly professional - he helped me with my game.</p>
      <p>“I think you can see that with all the young players in the England team. They all speak very highly of him and you can see how much he wants to improve players.”</p>
      <p>Woodman is the man seen as Martin Dubravka’s heir apparent at Newcastle.</p>
      <p>“That is the ultimate goal,” he said.</p>
      <p>“If you end up playing for England, it means you are a good player and you have done something well. Hopefully I can get there in the end.”</p>
