      <p>This Friday, November 30, The Dome in Tufnell Park, London and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/IsengardPromotions/">Isengard Productions</a> are going to be host to a night of extreme metal infamy as three legendary bands from across the globe – <a href="https://www.facebook.com/OfficialBlasphemy/">Blasphemy</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/VULCANOMETAL/">Vulcano</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/adorior/%20">Adorior</a> – come together for a tempestuous show of profane and piledriving aggression.</p>
      <p>Hailing from British Columbia, Canada, and having existed in various forms since 1984, Blasphemy were one of the key drivers – along with bands such as Von, Beherit Sarcófago and Mystifier – in pushing the nascent, still death-steeped black metal scene to primitive and brain-warping new extremes. Proudly Satanic, swathed in bullet belts sporting names such as Nocturnal Grave Desecrator And Black Winds and 3 Black Hearts Of Damnation And Impurity, Blasphemy were determined to uphold the uncompromising ethics of black metal’s first wave. Their 1990 debut album, <i>Fallen Angel Of Doom....</i> lashed its chaotic, transgressive energy to a ritualistic and atonal tumult whose sense-overwhelming storm still blows through today’s occult-minded underground. Despite only having released one other full-length album, 1993’s <i>Gods Of War</i>, since the bands unholy blast has lost none of its all-ravaging power.</p>

      <p>Equally essential, Brazil’s Vulcano were one of the country’s first bands to embrace the black metal wave. Their 1986 debut album, <i>Bloody Vengeance</i>, set the scabrous tone for the prolific black/thrash movement, all crazed, bug-eyed momentum, convulsive, electricity-overload lead breaks and a production that made it sound like a lo-fi field recording of cannibals on the loose.</p>

      <p>Having left a trail of destruction through the late 90s and early 00s, notorious British mace-in-the-face black metallers Adorior have returned from a long live hiatus, and fronted by the fearsome Melissa – Jaded Lungs, their full live comeback is a cause for celebration and outright moshpit carnage.</p>
