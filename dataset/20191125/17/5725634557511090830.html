        <b>IPO Details</b>
      </p>
      <p>GTH has filed to raise $100 million in gross proceeds from an IPO of ADSs representing underlying ordinary shares, although the final figure will likely differ.</p>
      <p>Per the firm’s latest filing, the firm plans to use the net proceeds from the IPO as follows:</p>
      <blockquote>40% to further invest in technology and product development; 30% to expand our sales and marketing efforts; and 30% to meet working capital needs and other general corporate purposes. Management’s presentation of the company roadshow is not available.</blockquote>
      <p>Listed underwriters of the IPO are Credit Suisse and CICC.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Commentary</b>
      </p>
      <p>GTH is attempting to obtain U.S. public market investment at a very challenging time in U.S. markets and for Chinese companies in particular.</p>
      <p>There has been a veritable ‘deluge’ of Chinese firms seeking investment on U.S. capital markets in recent months.</p>
      <p>Few firms have succeeded in completing an IPO transaction and most of those have performed poorly since IPO.</p>
      <p>GTH’s financials show the firm is growing revenue and gross profit, but at a decelerating rate of growth.</p>
      <p>Sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue are trending lower but are still high.</p>
      <p>The company is producing large losses and cash burn, so I don’t see a reasonable path to profitability any time soon.</p>
      <p>The market opportunity for providing cancer diagnostic services in China is large and growing, with an aging population increasing demand through growing incidence of cancer.</p>
      <p>The industry is promising and GTH has grown admirably, but the firm is producing increasing losses so I’m not sanguine about the prospects for a successful IPO.</p>
      <p>I’ll provide a final opinion when we learn more IPO details.</p>
      <p><b>Expected IPO Pricing Date:</b> To be announced.</p>
