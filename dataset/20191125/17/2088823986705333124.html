      <p><b>Matchup: <a href="https://www.nhl.com/sabres/stats/">Buffalo Sabres</a></b> (11-9-3) vs. <b><a href="https://www.nhl.com/lightning/stats">Tampa Bay Lightning</a> </b>(11-7-2)</p>
      <p><b>Where</b>: Amalie Arena, Tampa</p>
      <p><b>When:</b> 7 p.m.</p>
      <p><b>TV:</b> MSG.</p>
      <p><b>Radio:</b> WGR 550.</p>
      <p><b>Roster change:</b> Ralph Krueger opted to not reveal his lineup following a light morning skate Monday in Amalie Arena. The Sabres recalled forward Jean-Sebastien Dea because Evan Rodrigues suffered a lower-body injury Sunday in Sunrise, Fla. Rodrigues will be evaluated Tuesday in Buffalo, but his injury is thought to be "day to day," Krueger said.</p>
      <p>Dea's arrival gives the Sabres 12 forwards, eight defensemen and two goalies. The lineup won't be revealed until pregame warmup. Krueger also declined to say if Carter Hutton will start in goal.</p>
      <p>Linus Ullmark made 43 saves in the win over the Florida Panthers on Sunday and has started three consecutive games. Hutton has played only one of the past five games, allowing four goals on 27 shots in a 4-1 loss at Chicago on Nov. 17.</p>
      <p>Krueger could opt to use Dea and Curtis Lazar, or the Sabres could use seven defensemen with 11 forwards for the second time in as many nights.</p>
      <p><b>Another recall:</b> The Sabres have lost Vladimir Sobotka (lower body), Kyle Okposo (concussion), Marcus Johansson (upper body) and Tage Thompson (upper body) to injury this month. Johan Larsson also missed time with an upper-body injury. That led General Manager Jason Botterill to recall Lazar, Thompson, Dea and Rasmus Asplund from Rochester.</p>
      <p>Dea, 25, played a career-high 23 games between the New Jersey Devils and Pittsburgh Penguins last season, scoring four goals among six points. He had seven goals among 13 points with Rochester. Krueger explained to reporters that the Sabres chose Dea because of the NHL experience and the fact he's a right-handed center like Rodrigues.</p>
      <p>"They’ve been very competitive in adversity, and I think that Dea, on his NHL experience, is somebody we felt good to pull up at the moment," Krueger said. "We feel that he’s been outstanding on faceoffs, a right-hand center with Evan out, and has the option of playing wing, too. He’s got good foot speed and seems to be in a confident place right now.”</p>
      <p>Dea on his progress with the Amerks: "First couple games, obviously, trying to take the time to kind of get adjusted with everything, a new system and stuff. The last couple of weeks have been really good. Trying to build on that and hopefully I can bring what I did down there, here."</p>
      <p><b>Captain Jack:</b> Sabres center Jack Eichel has six goals among 10 points in his last five games, and his five games of at least three points rank third in the NHL behind Edmonton's Leon Draisaitl and Connor McDavid. Eichel's three games of at least four points were tied with McDavid for the league lead entering Monday.</p>
      <p>Eichel has scored 14 goals in 23 games, half his total from 77 games last season. He's on pace to score 50 goals among 103 points, which would be the highest goal and point totals by a Sabre since Pat LaFontaine and Alexander Mogilny in 1992-93.</p>
      <p><b>Stamkos missing:</b> The Lightning will be without center Steven Stamkos (lower body) for a second consecutive game. Stamkos has seven goals among 20 points in 19 games this season. He has 18 goals among 35 points in 41 career games against the Sabres. Lightning coach John Cooper told reporters that Stamkos' injury is not thought to be long-term.</p>
      <p><b>Difficult matchup:</b> This is the Sabres' third of four games against Tampa Bay this season. They lost both games to the Lightning during the NHL Global Series in Stockholm and haven't had much success over the past five seasons.</p>
      <p>The Sabres are only 5-16-2 against the Lightning since the start of the 2014-15 season. This won't be an easy matchup this time, either.</p>
      <p>Tampa Bay entered Monday with the league's top-ranked power play and has a plus-13 goal differential in the first period of games this season. The Lightning have scored 12 power-play goals in their last seven games, though five occurred in a 9-3 win over the New York Rangers on Nov. 14.</p>
      <p>Buffalo, on the other hand, has allowed a power-play goal in eight consecutive games and has a negative-10 goal differential in the first period this season.</p>
      <p>“With Stamkos out of the lineup, it’s a different look, but the skill in their lineup all the way through, I mean it was their fourth line – supposed fourth line – that actually did the damage in Stockholm in those two games," Krueger said of the Lightning. "So, you have to respect everything they do on the offense and power play’s just a finished product where they get to shine. We need outstanding discipline today, No. 1. We took too many penalties through the mid-stretch of the game yesterday. That has to be eliminated. But when they do have the power play, we need to work very, very hard to keep them under pressure, not to give them too much space. They will use it and they will hurt you quickly if you give them too much room.”</p>
