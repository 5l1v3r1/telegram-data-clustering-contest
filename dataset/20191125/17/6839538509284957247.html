      <p>An Australian commodities trader has cut years from his US jail sentence for trying to manipulate markets by agreeing to work with investigators.</p>
      <p>Zhao was facing 10 years prison but under a plea deal he is set to spend 12 months behind bars in the US.</p>
      <p>“The defendant is co-operating with the government’s investigation and the government anticipates needing additional time to evaluate the defendant’s co- operation,” prosecutors told District Court Judge John Tharp Jr in a court filing.</p>

      <p>Zhao’s sentencing was scheduled for December 17 in Chicago but has been pencilled in for January 28.</p>
      <p>Zhao admitted placing thousands of spoof orders for E-mini S&amp;P 500 futures contracts on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange between 2012 and 2016 “in an effort to deceive other market participants and enrich himself”.</p>
      <p>He would cancel the orders before they were executed, with his goal to induce other market participants to trade against his primary order, prosecutors said.</p>

      <p>Zhao, who was working for a Sydney trading firm, was charged by US prosecutors in January 2018.</p>
      <p>Under the plea deal he entered a guilty plea to one charge of spoofing.</p>
      <p>He was one of eight individuals charged by American law enforcement around the globe for alleged deceptive trading practices on US commodities markets.</p>
