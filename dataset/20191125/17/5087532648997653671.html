      <h1>Apple Card Guide: All of the 3% Cash Back Merchants (Update)</h1>

      <p>Apple is treating Apple Card as a service, not just a physical product. The company will continue to add merchants to its 3% Daily Cash back program as a way to entice customers to use it. We will continually update this list as new merchants are added.</p>
      <h3>3% Apple Pay Merchants</h3>
      <p>In order to actually get 3% cash back, you still need to use Apple Pay with your Apple Card as the main payment option. Putting your Apple Card number into one of these services will only get you the 1% physical card cash back.</p>
