      <p>The first sod was turned on the Canberra city development on Monday morning by Morris Property Group director Barry Morris and senator Zed Seselja.</p>
      <p>The construction is for the first stage of the project and includes 325 residential apartments, 750 public car spaces, 500 resident car spaces and 600 square metres of retail space.</p>
      <p>Prior to the sod turning, the site served as a car park.</p>
      <p>It is estimated to cost $500 million, as per the development application submitted to the National Capital Authority.</p>
      <p>"This is a significant milestone for the project. We're thrilled to formally mark the commencement of works in what will be one of Canberra's most iconic residential developments," said Mr Morris.</p>
      <p>Mr Seselja described the development as "really significant for Canberra".</p>
      <p>"It is great that we are seeing the growth of our city," he said.</p>
      <p>"This is going to be an amazing precinct and I'm sure over the coming years we are going to see some extraordinary things here."</p>
      <p>The Section 100 site, formerly known as Block 12 Section 63, sat in limbo for more than 10 years before Morris Property Group purchased it for $85 million in 2018.</p>

      <p>Mr Morris highlighted the "tumultuous history" of the site in his speech.</p>
      <p>In 2007, the ACT government sold the 2.6-hectare site to Mirvac for $93 million. The site was to be developed over seven years in a joint venture with Leightons.</p>
      <p>The companies planned a $755-million development for the site, <a href="https://www.canberratimes.com.au/story/6021791/morris-property-group-set-to-snap-up-key-canberra-city-block-on-section-63/">but it was reported in <i>The Canberra Times </i>that plans were delayed in the wake of the global credit crisis</a>.</p>
      <p>In his speech at the ceremony, Mr Morris took aim at the ACT government's tax reforms.</p>
      <p>"No commercial property owner that I know of or land developer will shy away from making their contribution to the city, and their contribution towards schools, health and education," he said.</p>
      <p>"However, a 200 per cent increase which is then only coupled with a 30 per cent reduction in stamp duty is somewhat of a big ask in my opinion.</p>
      <p>"Certainly a lot needs to be said for leakage out of the ACT government coffers."</p>
      <p>The development has one, two, three and four-bedroom apartments. The entire site could yield up to 1200 apartments.</p>
