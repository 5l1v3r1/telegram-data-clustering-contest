      <p>Sports Direct International, the retail business founded by tycoon Mike Ashley, has announced a plan to rebrand as Frasers Group.</p>
      <p>The FTSE 250 company has tabled a shareholder vote to change its company name to Frasers Group as the business attempts to improve its image.</p>
      <p>Shareholders will vote on the proposed rebrand on December 16.</p>
      <p>The move follows a recent announcement that the retailer will launch a new lifestyle store chain called Frasers on the high street within the new financial year.</p>
      <p>Sports Direct said the rebrand has been proposed to “reflect the changing profile and consumer proposition of the group”.</p>

      <p>The company said it was once “solely a leading international retailer in sports apparel”, but is now “equally as successful in the lifestyle and luxury markets”.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, Mr Ashley signalled that his recent acquisition drive had been placed on hold.</p>
      <p>The company has faced a series of challenges in its retail portfolio, including efforts to turn around the “terminal” problems at House of Fraser, which Sports Direct bought out of administration last summer.</p>
