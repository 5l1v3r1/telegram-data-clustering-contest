      <p>Students in a history class at a private school in Argentina fulfilled a class assignment in which they appeared in a sick video as singing Nazis, according to a report.</p>
      <p>The video, a parody of the song “Barbie Girl” by Aqua, features a student who changed the lyrics to “I’m a Nazi girl in a Nazi world” — and includes swastikas, as well as other Third Reich symbols, <a href="https://www.jta.org/quick-reads/history-students-in-argentina-create-music-video-featuring-singing-nazis-for-class-assignment">the Jewish Telegraphic Agency reported</a>.</p>
      <p>It received zero out of 10 points from the teacher at the Escuela Modelo of San Juan, or Model School, whose website says that “we mold people with integrity, solidarity and entrepreneurship.”</p>
      <p>The faux Nazis, one of whom appeared as Hitler, humiliated other students dressed as Jews and homosexuals.</p>
      <p>They belted out such lyrics as “Come on Jews, let’s go (to the) camp” and “Come on Joseph, let’s make soap.”</p>
      <p>In a statement, the school has expressed “apologies to the representative of the Sociedad Israelita de San Juan,” the local JCC, as well as other groups insulted in the video, including blacks and homosexuals.</p>
      <p>The teacher has also been canned and a representative of the national Jewish political umbrella DAIA planned to meet with officials from the Education Ministry of San Juan province.</p>
