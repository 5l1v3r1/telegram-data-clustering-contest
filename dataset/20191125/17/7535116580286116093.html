      <p>Malaysians have always been making us proud. But this Malaysian has only shone brighter and brighter since he first burst into the public eye as part of the iconic 8TV Quickie crew. Yes, itâ€™s Henry Golding!</p>
      <p>First, he was in one of the biggest movies of 2018, Crazy Rich Asians, then he was named as one of Top 100 Most Handsome Faces of 2019. In case youâ€™ve been in a cave somewhere, his latest movie, Last Christmas, was just released â€“ and he stars alongside Emilia Clarke of Game of Thrones fame and his Crazy Rich Asians co-star Michelle Yeoh.</p>
