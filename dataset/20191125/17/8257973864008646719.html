      <h1>Report links Russian agents with 2015 poisoning in Bulgaria</h1>

      <p>Nov. 25 (UPI) -- The Russian government is again facing accusations tied to a poisoning case on foreign soil -- this time involving a Bulgarian man who survived the attempt four years ago.</p>
      <p>Investigative watchdog Bellingcat said in a report over the weekend at least eight Russian intelligence agents traveled to Bulgaria in 2015, around the time arms dealer Emilian Gebrev was sickened by poison. Gebrev survived the attempt.</p>
      <p>The report is titled "<a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2019/11/23/the-dreadful-eight-grus-unit-29155-and-the-2015-poisoning-of-emilian-gebrev/">The Dreadful Eight</a>" and says all eight members belonged to the Russian GRU intelligence agency. Bellingcat said it partnered with media outlets Der Spiegel and The Insider in its investigation.</p>
      <p>The new accusations come 21 months after the poisoning of former Russian agent Sergei Skripal and his adult daughter in Britain -- a plot Moscow also received the blame for. Both Skripals survived.</p>
      <p>A Bulgarian prosecutor said this year one of the accused in the Skripal case had visited Bulgaria's capital Sofia in 2015.</p>
      <p>The Bellingcat report says Gebrev asked authorities to reopen his case when the Skripals were poisoned, believing the same agent may have been used in his case.</p>
      <p>The Kremlin didn't immediately respond to the report.</p>
