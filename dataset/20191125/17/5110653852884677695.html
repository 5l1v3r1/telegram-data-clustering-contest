      <p>Let the offseason of uniform reveals continue.</p>
      <p>The Twins wanted to get in on the fun that the Padres and Brewers were having, so they decided to reintroduce aclassic uniform, and they are <i>so, so pretty.</i></p>

      <p>The powder blues, which were first introduced in 1973, were used until the 1986 season. The Twins are bringing them back to celebrate the 60th year of the franchise's existence. Interestingly enough, those alternates were used during some of the leaner years in franchise history.</p>
      <p>The baby blues will pair nicely with the other unis in the Twins' closet, including arguably the best alternate uniforms in the league, the navy blue with red lettering and gold trim outline.<i>*Fanning himself.* </i>Hot.</p>
      <p>All in all, what better time to do introduce new throwbacks than now? Fresh off a101-win season and a Manager of the Year award for Rocco Baldelli, the Twins are primed for a stretch run of good baseball inthe coming years. They have a lot of work to do this offseason, but hopefully these sexy new-old uniforms bring some free agents — and goodwill from fans — their way.</p>
