        <b>Hollyoaks is hot off its <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/30/dies-hollyoaks-deadly-stunt-airs-11005670/">stunt week</a>, ‘<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/04/hollyoaks-spoilers-new-pictures-reveal-the-moment-before-mercedes-mcqueen-is-shot-11037881/">Who Shot Mercedes</a>?’ and the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/11/hollyoaks-spoilers-ste-hay-murdered-as-far-right-storyline-reaches-its-shocking-climax-11025770/">end of the far-right extremism storyline</a>, but things are showing no signs of slowing down as we head into the final chapter of the year, as the soap has dropped a brand new trailer previewing all of the drama that’s to come — and things are well and truly going to explode.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Yes, the nights might be getting colder, but things are only beginning to heat up down in Chester — which is really saying something given the incredible year the Channel 4 soap has already had — as the festive season is set to be truly unmissable.</p>

      <p>The village residents are set to see in the New Year in an epic fashion, and the winter trailer has previewed what viewers can expect as the soap finishes out it’s sublime year in style.</p>
      <p>With Breda’s (Moya Brady) storyline set to culminate, and the returns of some of familiar faces, it all going on in the short snippet, so let’s take a look at everything we’ve got to look forward to!</p>
      <h3>Breda’s killer exit</h3>
      <p>Breda has murdered just about anyone she can get her hands on, but her reign of terror is set to come to a tremendous end in the coming weeks, as <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/20/hollyoaks-spoilers-late-night-episode-returns-killer-breda-mcqueens-story-reaches-shocking-end-10774879/">acclaimed spin-off series Hollyoaks Later is being revived to allow the storyline the unfiltered ending it deserves</a>.</p>
      <p>In the trailer, Breda can be seen preparing to put an end to Tony (Nick Pickard) — whom she’s been keeping prisoner for months — once and for all. Whether she’ll succeed in doing so remains to be seen, but with the narrative seemingly set to end in a fire of some sorts, it’s unknown whether he — or Breda — will make it out alive!</p>
      <h3>John Paul’s return</h3>

      <p>We already know that fan favourite character John Paul (James Sutton) is set to return in the coming weeks, and now we’ve caught our first glimpse of his comeback, as he comes face-to-face with the man who raped him, Finn O’Connor (Keith Rice) as a shocked Diane (Alex Fletcher) looks on.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>What brings the character back to the village remains to be seen, but there’s no doubt that this is one showdown you’re not going to want to miss!</p>
      <h3>The identity of Mercedes’ shooter revealed</h3>
      <p>Since being shot by an unknown assailant, Mercedes (Jennifer Metcalfe) has been in a coma. However, we now know that The Dog landlady will wake up, and — upon doing so — is desperate to spill all about the night in which she was shot.</p>
      <p>With <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/15/hollyoaks-spoilers-every-suspect-revealed-as-mercedes-mcqueen-is-shot-and-left-to-die-10923146/">seven suspects</a> — <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/28/hollyoaks-spoilers-full-suspect-list-revealed-for-who-shot-mercedes-10944141/">all with incredibly compelling motives to their name</a> — who is responsible for pulling the trigger?</p>
      <h3>Mitchell comes out?</h3>
      <p>Mitchell’s (Imran Adams) relationship with Scott (Ross Adams) came to light several weeks back when Cleo (Nadine Mulkerrin) <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/30/hollyoaks-spoilers-special-three-hander-episode-reveals-mitchell-deverauxs-romance-with-scott-drinkwell-revealed-as-cleo-mcqueen-exits-11014010/">discovered the truth following the crane collapse</a>, but her departure from the village means that the pair’s dalliance is still a secret.</p>
      <p>During the trailer, Mitchell makes a huge decision when he decides to come out so that he and Scott can stop hiding their love for one another, as they kiss in a very public place.</p>
      <p>Whether he does so remains to be seen, but given Walter’s (Trevor A Toussaint) previous comments, the young man is no doubt going to be incredibly scared.</p>
      <h3>Sid finds a home</h3>

        <img src="https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Screenshot-2019-11-25-at-16.33.21-5e69.png?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;zoom=1&amp;resize=540%2C284&amp;ssl=1"/>

      <p>Sid (Billy Price) has had an incredibly difficult few months, and he’s struggled to come to terms with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/15/hollyoaks-spoilers-billy-price-promises-journey-for-sid-sumner-after-he-kills-dad-stuart-in-far-right-climax-11162990/">him having been responsible for the death of dad Stuart</a> (Chris Simmons). However, in spite of his heartache, it appears as if he finally finds love and acceptance, as Leela (Kirsty-Leigh Porter) agrees to foster him.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>With a romance to Juliet also on the horizon, things are looking up for Sid — but he’s not out of the woods yet, as he seemingly comes into possession of drugs. Will he sacrifice it all?</p>
      <h3>The ground-breaking flash-forward</h3>
      <p>Soaps are the one genre of television that don’t really partake in different narrative techniques due to the genre’s requirement to follow linear day-to-day storylines.</p>
      <p>However, much like it’s done several times before, Hollyoaks is proving to be ground-breaking once more, as the show is <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/20/hollyoaks-spoilers-soap-skips-forward-a-whole-year-in-most-ambitious-move-ever-10774834/">set to flash forward one year into the future</a>, before returning to the present and building up to those future events.</p>
      <p>We caught a glimpse of this in the trailer, as Juliet and Sid get close this New Year’s Eve, before a flash-forward takes us to the end of 2020, when an older Juliet tells an out-of-sight character that she loves them. Is it Sid she’s speaking to? Or someone else?</p>
      <h3>Liberty and Brody betray Sienna?</h3>
      <p>With viewers having already seen Liberty (Jessamy Stoddart) learn that Sienna’s (Anna Passey) last egg is no longer viable, she’s left with the difficult task of telling her sister the truth. However, it would appear as if Liberty has a plan to rectify the situation as — determined to make Sienna’s wish come true — she suggests that her and Brody (Adam Woodward) could sleep together!</p>
      <p>While her heart’s in the right place, Sienna would no doubt see this as the ultimate betrayal — but will Brody agree to Liberty’s plan?</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <h3>Warren’s returns</h3>

        <img src="https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Screenshot-2019-11-25-at-16.17.30-72f9.png?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;zoom=1&amp;resize=540%2C280&amp;ssl=1"/>
        <figcaption>(Picture: Lime Pictures)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Liberty’s potential betrayal may not be the only heartache Sienna might endure this festive season, as the villainous Warren (Jamie Lomas) returns to the village once more — and he’s got Sienna’s babies, Sophie and Sebastian in tow!</p>
      <p>Will Warren reconnect with Sienna? What’s more, will he catch up with son Joel (Rory-Douglas Speed)?</p>
      <h3>Toby and Celeste arrive in the village</h3>
      <p>Last week it was revealed that newcomers Toby and Celeste Faroe (Bobby Gordon and Andrea Ali) <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/hollyoaks-spoilers-mysterious-new-couple-toby-and-celeste-arrive-in-the-village-with-a-sinister-plan-11196817/">are on their way to the village</a>, and the trailer has provided our first look at the sophisticated newbies.</p>
      <p>The couple have more to them than meets the eye, as they begin to befriend quite a few villagers — but they’ve seemingly got dark motives in store.</p>
      <h3>Nancy reveals all to Mandy</h3>
      <p>Nancy (Jessica Fox) and Darren’s (Ashley Taylor Dawson) secret sexual encounter in the tunnels is set to be revealed, as Nancy comes clean — leaving Mandy (Sarah Jayne Dunn) and Kyle (Adam Rickitt) devastated.</p>
      <p>We’re not sure of what leads to Nancy’s revelation — or how Darren figures into this equation — but it looks like there’s going to be plenty of heartache ahead.</p>
