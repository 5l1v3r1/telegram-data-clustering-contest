      <h1>Engineering giant Renishaw making redundancies amid 'difficult economic conditions'</h1>
      <h2>Profits have plummeted from £32.6m to just £4.3m</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T17:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 17:00</time> by <a rel="author">Alexander Brock</a></address>
      <p>A major engineering company  in the West Country which employs around 3,000 people in the UK has made redundancies in the face of "challenging" circumstances.</p>
      <p>Renishaw, which has its headquarters in Wotton-under-Edge, is cutting 22 jobs across its manufacturing sites in Woodchester, Gloucestershire, and Miskin, South Wales.</p>
      <p>It comes on the back of "difficult <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/economy">economic</a> conditions" which have led to profits plummeting from £32.6m to just £4.3m in the space of a year.</p>
      <p>As well as the redundancies, operations will also be reviewed by the company which has nine sites in the UK, including five in the West Country; three in and around Wotton-under Edge, one in Stonehouse and one in Woodchester.</p>
      <p>A spokesman said: "The company does not comment on the circumstances of individual employees, but we are currently in a challenging period that requires us to look closely at our operations and reorganise the business where required to achieve cost reductions.</p>
      <p>"In our manufacturing operations, the reduced global demand for Renishaw products has led to reduced activity.</p>
      <p>"To date this situation has been managed by not replacing people leaving the company and not renewing some of the contracts of manufacturing staff who joined us on a fixed-term basis.</p>
      <p>"However, with the continuing challenges faced, it has now become necessary to take further measures.</p>
      <p>"Therefore, this week, a total of 22 employees working in manufacturing operations at our Woodchester site in Gloucestershire and Miskin site in South Wales, have been made redundant.</p>
      <p>"Whilst any decision to make redundancies is regrettable, it is important that the company adapts to the current economic climate and focuses very strongly on targeting its resources upon initiatives that will deliver profit and improve productivity, whilst also controlling expenditure, including salary costs."</p>
