      <h1>Google copies Microsoft Photos app: Google Photos now lets you draw, highlight, and add text on top of your photos</h1>

      <p>We had <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/google-photos-app-will-soon-be-as-good-as-microsofts-photos-app-when-it-comes-to-caption-and-draw-on-photos/">reported</a> that Google is working towards adding a new editing tool to the Google Photos app to let users draw, highlight and caption on photos. The good news is this new editing tool is no longer in testing.</p>
      <p>Google has started rolling out this new editing tool to the Google Photos app. Starting today, you’ll now be able to draw, highlight, or add text on top of your photos right from the Google Photos app. This new markup tool is already available in Microsoft’s Photos app on Windows 10. It is also very similar to the ‘Markup’ screenshot editor tool that shipped with Android Pie.</p>

      <p>This new feature appears in the editing UI within the Google Photos app, it’ll let you pick a handful of new colors to draw lines. Once you’re done, tap on Done and then Save the edited photo, much like you do on Microsoft’s Photos app.</p>
      <p>While these new features are expected to work on every Android smartphone, experiences are expected to be a lot better on smartphones like Samsung Galaxy Note series, the reason being the fact that it comes with a stylus.</p>
