      <p>Selena Gomez rocked several looks at the American Music Awards Sunday night and that includes several hairstyles. While the singer stunned everyone with long hair in her new music video for “Lose You To Love Me” she arrived at the AMAs Red Carpet wearing a <a href="https://celebrityinsider.org/selena-gomez-stuns-in-acid-green-versace-mini-dress-as-she-walks-the-american-music-awards-red-carpet-344479/">Versace mini dress</a> and a sleek-straight bob. Fans loved the new, shorter length that celebrity hairstylist Marissa Marino styled curled under and referred to as a “faux bob” most likely based upon the length of Selena’s hair. Selena opened the show and performed her new two singles “Lose You To Love Me” and “Look At Her Now” and wore different outfits and wavy hair in each.</p>
      <p>Selena Gomez shared a series of photos with her 162.2 million Instagram followers showing her AMAs Red Carpet look and the photos went viral and have more than 8 million likes and over 74,000 comments from fans who were thrilled that Selena has returned to the music scene after undergoing plenty of personal emotional turmoil and struggles in her life.</p>
      <p>She is drawing praise across the board for her glamorous looks and many fans have told Selena they love the bob on her.</p>

      <p>By the time Selena Gomez came out on stage to open the American Music Awards, she had underwent a clothing change and wore her hair in a wavy bob. Hairstylist Marissa Marino shared a video clip of Selena before she hit the stage and you could see a closeup of Selena’s eye makeup as well.</p>

      <p>Celebrity makeup artist Hung Vanngo did Selena’s makeup and he also showcased two videos showing Selena modeling both looks. You’ll notice that not only did her hairstyle change for the performance but her makeup as well.</p>
      <p>When Selena’s hair was styled in a straight bob, Hung did Selena’s eyes in shades of golden brown with a soft, brown lip color. Her eyebrows were perfectly arched  and the look was beautiful and perfect for the AMAs Red Carpet.</p>

      <p>Hung used darker, bolder colors for Selena’s second look and the results were fabulous. Selena continued wearing the Roberto Coin diamond necklace for both looks, but in the second, Hung used matching glitter on her eyes that not only made them sparkle but complemented the necklace.</p>
