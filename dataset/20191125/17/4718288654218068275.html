      <p>KOLKATA: West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday announced that all refugee colonies on central government and private lands up to 3 acres will be regularised The displaced people will also be given land rights by the Trinamool Congress government, Banerjee said.</p>
      <p>Her statement came in the backdrop of the <a href="https://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2019/nov/20/nrc-different-from-citizenship-bill-will-cover-everybody-across-country-irrespective-of-religion-a-2064487.html">Centre's announcement that the National Register of Citizens</a> (NRC) process would be carried out across the country.</p>
      <p>Alleging that the TMC is protecting illegal immigrants from Bangladesh as they are the party's votebank, senior BJP leaders have asserted that NRC would be implemented in the state.</p>
      <p>The state government had earlier regularized 94 refugee colonies which were on state government land, she said after a Cabinet meeting.</p>
      <p>"But there are several refugee colonies on the land owned by the central government and private parties.</p>
      <p>We have been saying this for a long time asking them to regularise these refugee colonies and provide them with land possession.</p>
      <p>However, they have sending eviction notices," Banerjee said.</p>
