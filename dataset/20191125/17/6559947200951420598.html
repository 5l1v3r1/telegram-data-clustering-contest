      <h4>Nintendo Switch Bundles and Deals</h4>
      <figure>

      <p>The Switch dominated a good portion of the Black Friday sales last year, and came out as one of the best sellers on sites like Currys PC World. We're already starting to see a few Switch deals appear, with plenty of bundle offers already available.</p>
      <p>The new edition to the Switch family is the Switch Lite, a slimmer, less expensive version of the standard Switch, and one of the best handheld systems to date. Lacking any docking capabilities, the <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/nintendo-switch-lite/122713/nintendo-switch-lite">Switch Lite</a> is purely a handheld system, and a <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/nintendo-switch-lite/122713/nintendo-switch-lite">great one at that</a>.</p>
      <p>At only £199, getting this console for any cheaper would be a great deal, and we'll have to wait and see what happens. If you do see either console discounted, snap it up quick, because stocks never last for long.</p>
      <h4>Xbox One Bundles and Deals</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://sm.pcmag.com/pcmag_uk/photo/default/xbox-one-x-cnslcntlr-hrz-anrtlt-grdbg-96ppi-v2-rgb-1_yuzp.jpg"/>

      <p><b>UPDATE:</b> <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/store/b/black-friday">Xbox UK</a> recently announced that Black Friday deals on the Xbox Store will start on November 22.</p>
      <p>Xbox One hasn't had the easiest ride in this console generation, but has made back some ground with the <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/microsoft-xbox-one-s/83447/review/microsoft-xbox-one-s">Xbox One S</a> and One X. The <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/microsoft-xbox-one-x/89807/review/microsoft-xbox-one-x">Xbox One X</a> is the most powerful consoles on the market, with stunning HDR and 4K capabilities, while the <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/microsoft-xbox-one-s/83447/review/microsoft-xbox-one-s">Xbox One S</a> is a great entry point and very cheap at this stage in the console cycle, normally selling for less than £225 on most sites.</p>
      <p>As previously mentioned, this will be the last year that Microsoft focuses on the Xbox One in Black Friday. Sure, next year the console will definitely get plenty of discounts and will be incredibly cheap, but the focus will be on Project Scarlett.</p>
      <p>Microsoft has also released its new <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/store/collections/xboxaccessories">Xbox One Elite Controller</a> in November, so the older model may get a discount on Black Friday. Xbox also has its very own <a href="https://xboxdesignlab.xbox.com/">'Design Lab'</a> for its controllers, so there could be a deal on the cards there as well.</p>
      <h4>PlayStation 4 Bundles and Deals</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://sm.pcmag.com/pcmag_uk/news/w/want-to-te/want-to-test-new-ps4-features-sony-needs-beta-testers_xees.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Sony has recently released details of the next PlayStation console, and it will be called PlayStation 5. Sony, unlike Microsoft, like to keep it simple.</p>
      <p>Similarly to Microsoft however, this will be the last year that the PS4 gets any focus during the Black Friday sales. It will likely be even cheaper next year, but that's simply because the PS5 will be getting all the attention.</p>
      <p>PlayStation has less consoles to decide from in comparison to Xbox, and you can either pick up the PS4 Slim or the PS4 Pro at the moment. The Pro has 4K capabilities, and is only slightly less powerful than the Xbox One X. Specs aside, the Pro is a great console will plenty of incredible games to back it up.</p>
      <p>We expect more bundle deals will occur during Black Friday, and we could see the DualShock 4 controllers get partnered with games, or discounted alone.</p>
      <h4>Where to shop on Black Friday</h4>
      <hr/>
      <p>Black Friday is fast approaching, and it is very likely this will be the last year the Xbox One and PS4 share any of the spotlight.</p>
      <p>Black Friday will start on November 29 this year, with the best of deals concentrated here and over the weekend into Cyber Monday. This doesn't mean there won't be any good deals prior to Black Friday, though.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>We're expecting retailers to start slashing prices from the very beginning of November, with the likes of Amazon and Currys poised to have another great Black Friday showing.</p>
      <p>Other retailers to watch out for include GAME, Argos, and John Lewis.</p>
      <h4>What to expect on Black Friday</h4>
      <hr/>
      <p>The Nintendo Switch sold incredibly well last year during Black Friday. There's no way of knowing, but if a Switch sale does pop up, it's bound to be popular again.</p>
      <p>With the expected release of the next Xbox and the PS5 in 2020, Black Friday next year will have a new focus for gaming retailers. In 2019 however, we can still expect the Nintendo Switch, alongside Xbox and PlayStation, to feature in plenty of sales.</p>
      <p>There are always significant discounts on games consoles and various other bundles during Black Friday. We predict the current trend of console bundles to continue into November, with prices falling heavily in the Black Friday weekend.</p>
      <p>Considering Microsoft and Sony are set to release the next generation of consoles in 2020, this year will be filled to the brim with PS4 and Xbox One sales. Xbox is currently already pushing out a large number of Xbox One bundle deals on its One S, One X, and all-digital editions. It's likely these deals will continue into Black Friday.</p>
      <p>Until then, we've rounded up a few extra deals for you to look over. It's a good idea to keep these in mind when looking at Black Friday deals, so you have a good idea of how much you're actually saving in reality. Try not to impulse buy and get overwhelmed by all the Black Friday hype.</p>
      <p>Check into PCMag before and during the Black Friday sales to ensure you're getting the very best deals. Make sure you bookmark this page and any other relevant Black Friday pages along the way.</p>
      <p>November 22 seems to be a key date for many retailers, as the likes of Amazon and Microsoft will be starting to push out initial offers a week before Black Friday and Cyber Monday.</p>
