      <h1>Cowboys Star’s Tweet About The Tripping Penalty Is Going Viral</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T17:51:05+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 17:51</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>The Dallas Cowboys didn’t lose to the New England Patriots <i>because </i>of an embarrassing penalty call by the officials, but it certainly didn’t help.</p>
      <p>Dallas was called for a ridiculous “tripping” penalty on the penultimate drive of the game. The call came on a third down conversion by the Cowboys, who were trailing 13-9 with a little more than two minutes to play. The first down was negated, Dallas was pushed back 10 yards, and Jason Garrett’s team ended up turning it over on downs.</p>
      <p>The penalty was nothing short of terrible:</p>

      <p>Dallas Cowboys linebacker Jaylon Smith reacted on Twitter to the penalty a couple of hours after the game.</p>
      <p>His reaction was simple:</p>

      <p>Unsurprisingly, Cowboys fans have already retweeted this more than 2,000 times and liked it nearly 10,000 times.</p>
      <p>Cowboys star pass rusher DeMarcus Lawrence had a more blunt response.</p>
      <p>“I get tripped up every time, but it’s cool. I ain’t gonna sit here and cry about it. If the refs want to call bulls—-, let them call bulls—-,” <a href="https://twitter.com/jonmachota/status/1198939450723708930">Lawrence said</a>. “It’s all about what we do. Everybody knows it was no such thing that a foot was thrown out or anybody was tripped.”</p>
      <p>Dallas fell to 6-5 with the loss to New England, which improved to 10-1 with the win.</p>
