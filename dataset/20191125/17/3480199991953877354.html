      <p>Elon Musk has said hitting the door of Tesla’s new CyberTruck with a sledgehammer damaged its armoured glass which then broke during a failed demonstration of the new vehicle.</p>
      <p>The unveiling of Tesla’s first electric pick-up truck was marred by the incident, which saw two supposedly armoured glass windows shatter when hit with a metal ball.</p>
      <p>Mr Musk had spent some time during the live unveiling in Los Angeles last week detailing how robust the new vehicle would be.</p>
      <p>Responding to comments on Twitter about the incident, he said the windows had broken because a previous demo of the vehicle’s steel doors – in which they had been hit with a sledgehammer – had damaged the glass.</p>

      <p>“Sledgehammer impact on door cracked base of glass, which is why steel ball didn’t bounce off,” he said in response to one commenter.</p>
      <p>“Should have done steel ball on window, *then* sledgehammer the door. Next time…”</p>
      <p>Mr Musk also tweeted a video of the same window test being carried out backstage before the incident during the live unveiling.</p>
      <p>As had been the case on stage, it showed Tesla head of design Franz von Holzhausen throwing a metal ball at the window from close range.</p>

      <p>After the glass cracked during the on-stage demo, a clearly shocked Mr Musk told the audience “at least it didn’t go through” and admitted there was “room for improvement”.</p>
      <p>Despite the embarrassing incident, he also claimed Tesla has already received 200,000 orders for the CyberTruck.</p>
      <p>The futuristic-looking vehicle will be released at the end of 2021, with a range of up to 500 miles.</p>
      <p>Tesla has said the top of the range, triple electric motor version will be capable of going from zero to 60mph in 2.9 seconds – comparable with many sports cars.</p>
      <p>The truck will start at 39,900 dollars (£31,000) for the single motor version.</p>
