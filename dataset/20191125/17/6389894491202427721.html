      <h1>Race To Dubai winner Jon Rahm gets better each year – his first Major is a matter of when not if</h1>

      <p>Many a man would have buckled in the situation Jon Rahm found himself on Sunday afternoon at the European Tour’s season finale, the DP World Tour Championship.</p>
      <p>Chasing a victory that would also earn him the Race To Dubai title and a combined windfall of £4m, the Spaniard made the perfect start, holing five birdies in seven holes to go six shots clear.</p>
      <p>On commentary duty, I remarked that he was turning the final round in Dubai into an exhibition.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Then the wheels soon came off. Rahm dropped shots at the eighth, ninth, 13th and 15th – the latter after a bad three-putt – to allow Tommy Fleetwood back into the hunt for the tournament and order of merit.</p>
      <p>Fleetwood, meanwhile, was playing a phenomenal back nine in five under par to set his rival a target of 18 under.</p>
      <p>But Rahm rallied in adversity, making a birdie at the last after a magnificent drive and chip out of the bunker to win the whole kit and caboodle by one shot.</p>
      <h3>Wonderful machine</h3>
      <p>All credit to the 25-year-old, who won the Spanish Open on his previous appearance, took six weeks off and then performed like that.</p>
      <p>He is a wonderful machine, very fit and strong, seemed to have slimmed down a little during his time off, and now looks more accomplished when playing shots under pressure.</p>
      <p>Rahm also seems to get better with every year. Having won three titles in his previous two full seasons as a professional, he has now won four in 2019 and, on top of all that, the Race To Dubai.</p>
      <p>He spoke on Sunday of his pride at emulating his idol Seve Ballesteros, the only other Spaniard to top the European money list.</p>
      <p>While he has some way to go to matching Seve’s six order of merit titles, 90 career wins and five Majors, he has started extremely well.</p>
      <p>You have to think that Rahm will win a Major sooner or later, so the only question is: when?</p>
      <p>There’s no doubt he is ready and not scared at all – just look at the way he won at the weekend against a very strong field. The Masters is a dream for big hitters like him, so that would seem a good chance.</p>
      <h3>Fabulous finish to the year</h3>
      <p>For his part, Fleetwood couldn’t have done much more. He made a huge putt at 17 and a glorious chip at 18 to finish with two birdies as he sought back-to-back wins and a second Race To Dubai crown in three years.</p>
      <p>It hadn’t been a great season for the Englishman until last week’s win at Sun City, but it has been a fabulous finish to the year.</p>

        <figcaption>Fleetwood put pressure on Rahm with a superb back nine but the Englishman missed out by one shot</figcaption>

      <p>I also have to mention Mike Lorenzo-Vera, who was one shot behind Fleetwood in third place.</p>
      <p>The 34-year-old, still waiting for his first European Tour title, did everything except win and paid for a three-putt at the last.</p>
      <p>For a season finale, it had almost everything, although I expected Rory McIlroy to be challenging Rahm, expecially after his opening 64 and a 65 on Saturday.</p>
      <p>He was undone by a second round of 74 and Sunday’s 73, although no matter how many mistakes he makes Rory still seems to finish in the top five, as he did again here.</p>
      <h3>MacIntyre caps whirlwind 2019</h3>
      <p>Rahm aside, the other player crowned on Sunday was Bob MacIntyre, who clinched the Rookie of the Year award.</p>

      <p>MacIntyre, 23, is the first to do it without winning a title since Chris Wood in 2009, while fellow rookies Guido Migliozzi and Kurt Kitayama both won multiple events.</p>
      <p>But he’s had a fantastic year, banking €2m in prize money and playing magnificently, and it’s great to see a young Scottish player win this prize – after all, you only get one chance.</p>
