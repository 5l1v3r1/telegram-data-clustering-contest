      <h1>Kojima Watching Horror Movies in Preparation For Next Game?</h1>

      <p><a href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3594365/hideo-kojima-teases-whats-next-death-stranding/">Last week,</a> it was reported that Hideo Kojima is in the process of getting started with the genesis of his next game. And for those lamenting the loss of <b><i>P.T.</i></b> and <b><i>Silent Hills</i></b> (which is pretty much everyone), Kojima’s recent tweet (in amongst the constant stream of retweets over <b><i>Death Stranding</i></b>) should have you cautiously giddy.</p>
      <p>While nothing is set in stone as to just what Kojima will be working on next, the fact that he’s watching horror films “to awaken [his] horror soul” is reason enough to raise an eyebrow.</p>
