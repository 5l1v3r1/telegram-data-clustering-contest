      <p>Can't quite face another air bed on the floor as you stay with relatives this <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/christmas">Christmas</a> ?</p>
      <p>Then you might want to check out <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/the-premier-inn">Premier Inn</a> 's latest sale. That's because the hotel chain has slashed prices on 100,000 rooms to £35 or less for December stays - including the Christmas dates.</p>
      <p>The company is offering up the cheap rooms for stays between the 1st December 2019 through to Monday 6th January 2020, so it's perfect if you're planning to be away from home for Christmas or even looking for somewhere to stay for New Year's Eve.</p>
      <p>Oh, or of course it can also be a great excuse to book in a mini break to explore some of the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/travel/uk-ireland/best-christmas-markets-uk-guide-20861147">UK's best Christmas markets</a> .</p>
      <p>The deals are already live on the <a href="http://tidd.ly/99709e4c">Premier Inn website</a> but they are subject to availability, so if you do spot the right stay for you it's worth booking in to secure the deal.</p>

      <p>There are hotels to be found in destinations from Birmingham to Glasgow, while the sale also includes hotels in London with rooms for £79 and under up for grabs.</p>
      <p>There are two rates you can opt for; there's the Non-Flex rate which is often the best value, but if you do need a bit of flexibility, then you may want to opt for the Flex Rate option (prices may vary).</p>
      <p>Don't be disheartened if you can't quite make the offer work for you.</p>
