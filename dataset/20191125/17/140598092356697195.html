      <h1>John Lewis Black Friday 2019 deals: today's best offers in the early sale, from Dyson vacuum cleaners to KitchenAid stand mixers</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T17:40:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 17:40</time> by <a rel="author">Lela London, Katie Russell</a></address>
      <p>As one of the big dogs of the high street, John Lewis tends to offer a wider range of <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/black-friday/2019/11/25/black-friday-2019-deals-date-do-uk-sales-start-find-best-available/">Black Friday deals</a> than its competitors — and they haven't let us down for 2019. </p>
      <p>Last year the store cut prices on a range of sought-after items from coffee machines to Mulberry handbags, home speakers to games consoles, as well as two of its most searched-for products – Apple Airpods and the Applewatch Series 3.</p>
      <p>As an added bonus, John Lewis' Never Knowingly Undersold policy means the company price matches the promotions of its competitors, making it no-brainer for deal-hunters who have spent hours shopping around in years past.</p>
      <p>While the deals have kicked off a whole week before Black Friday (technically, November 29), we expect to see a number of new products reduced as the week goes on, so will update with the very best deals as and when they do.</p>
      <h4>Best John Lewis Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals 2019</h4>
      <h3>1. Philips Sonicare Healthy Smile Gift Set with ExpertClean and Airfloss Pro</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>For almost half of the gift set's recommended retail price, you can get your hands on both the pro-quality Philips ExpertClean Electric Toothbrush <i>and </i>the AirFloss Pro Power Flosser. The duo are something of a dental godsend;  the toothbrush's smart sensor lets you know when to adjust pressure (helping you keep gums and teeth in good nick) and comes with multiple cleaning modes, while the AirFloss Pro blasts trapped food and plaque (up to 99.9%, according to the brand's scientific studies). </p>

      <p>Home chefs, rejoice! KitchenAid's cult favourite – the Artisan stand mixer – has been reduced by a massive £150 this year. If you have yet to experience one in person, don't judge this book by its cover; under a chic retro exterior you can take advantage of its culinary-quality craftsmanship to whip up cakes, breads, eggs, buns, creams and everything in between. It makes light work of the heaviest loads.</p>

      <p>The Dyson V8 Animal Complete Cordless vacuum cleaner is one of the best vacuum cleaners around, tackling carpets, hard floors and tiny nooks with incredible power. Thanks to Dyson's hygienic dirt ejector, you can remove trapped dust and debris (think pet hair, door mats, et al) without getting your hands dirty. </p>

      <p>If you're looking for a nifty little tablet that you can use to watch programmes on the train, and then do some work on in the evening, the Microsoft Surface Pro 7 tablet might be the right fit for you. The tablet, with its Intel Core i5 processor, is particularly apt to everyday tasks, like word processing, image editing and web browsing. Even better, this tablet comes with an attachable keyboard, so you can type with ease. </p>

      <p>Exclusive to John Lewis, this is a television with a difference. When you're not watching a programme on its vivid QLED screen, The Frame will display a piece of artwork. Given the television's no-gap wall mount, and near-invisible cables, it will looklike you have a 49 inch picture hanging on your wall — which you can choose yourself. </p>

      <p>It might not be the hugest Black Friday discount, but any new Apple product that features in the sales is a veritable bargain. These Apple Airpods, new for 2019, are still a huge trend, given their ease of use, cool aesthetic and smart features. As well as listening to music, you can ask Apple's voice assistant, Siri, any number of questions, meaning you no longer need to reach for your phone.</p>

      <p>This is one of the newest Samsung Galaxy models (upstaged only by the S10+), so it's a fairly surprising addition to the John Lewis Black Friday sales. With its three ultra-wide and ultra-zoom rear cameras and Ultra HD front camera, you'll never have a blurry family photo again. Aside from taking excellent photos, the phone can be used to catch up on some work on the train home, as it incorporates Microsoft Excel, Word, Powerpoint and more.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>For new home buyers, this will be a gift that keeps giving. While video doorbells are nothing new, the developing tech has long out-priced their widespread use, making this £80 discount on Google's Nest a rare treat. The device has a wide view in crystal-clear quality, a microphone (meaning you can speak to visitors/the postman from anywhere in the world), and sends optional movement alerts to your smart device (even if someone doesn't ring the doorbell). A home security saviour. </p>

      <p>This incredible little device can be used to heat up or cool down any space (and, thanks to Air Multiplier technology, does so more effectively than any fan or space heater you've come across before). The long-ranged Dyson Hot + Cool fan can be used year-round and controls the temperature of an entire room with a single click, rather than pushing out a single stream of hot or cool air like its competitors.</p>

      <h3>How to shop at John Lewis on Black Friday</h3>
      <p>If you're not brave enough to elbow your way through the crowds in store, don't worry: you can get the same (and often, <i>better</i>) deals by shopping online from the comfort of your bed. </p>
      <p>But it's not quite as easy as it sounds. Systems can time out, and you can lose out on deals if you're not fast enough. Below, therefore, are our top tips for shopping online at John Lewis on Black Friday.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Get online early. </b>Last year, the busiest shopping hour on the website was between 6am and 7am on Black Friday itself, so you might need to set your alarm a little earlier if you want to get the best deals.</li>
        <li><b>Use your Bookmarks. </b>It's worth adding your wish-list products to your Bookmarks (if you create a new folder, this will make your life even easier). Then, on the day, you can quickly find out whether your dream purchases are on sale.</li>
        <li><b>Register as a member. </b>It can be worth registering as a member before Black Friday, as you will get email alerts from the retailer (which could include any deals from that day) and it will speed up your check-out process.</li>
        <li><b>Follow on social media</b>. If you're poised for flash deals, you may want to follow John Lewis on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram so you can find out about new deals first.</li>
        <li><b>Read The Telegraph's live coverage. </b>We will be publishing our pick of the best Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals as soon as they become available, so be sure to <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/black-friday/">follow our Black Friday page</a> for live updates. </li>
      </ul>
