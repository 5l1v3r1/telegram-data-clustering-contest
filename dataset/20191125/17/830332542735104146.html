      <p>(CNN) - All Charlie Brown knows how to make is "cold cereal and maybe toast," but that's not going to stop him from cooking up Thanksgiving for the Peanuts crew this year.</p>
      <p>With Thanksgiving days away, it's time to watch the classic Thanksgiving TV special, "A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving," the animated half-hour adventure of Charlie Brown and his motley group of friends.</p>
      <p>As the story goes, Peppermint Patty has (a little bit rudely) invited herself and all her friends over to Charlie Brown's house for Thanksgiving and the ever-beleaguered Charlie Brown, along with Linus, Snoopy and Woodstock, must scramble to put together a holiday feast.</p>
      <p>The TV special was originally broadcast in November 1973. Here's how you can watch the holiday classic this year.</p>
      <h3>Watch it on ABC</h3>
      <p>View it the good old-fashioned way by switching on the TV at 8 p.m. ET this Thursday and <a href="https://abc.com/news/insider/watch-a-charlie-brown-thanksgiving-free-online-111716">catching it on ABC</a>. As a bonus, ABC plans to air "This is America, Charlie Brown: The Mayflower Voyagers" after the special.</p>
      <p>You can also watch the full movie for free on ABC.com and on the ABC app the day after the movie airs.</p>
      <h3>Rent or buy the movie</h3>
      <p>If you don't have cable or are just itching to get your hands on the movie now, you can <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Charlie-Brown-Thanksgiving-Jimmy-Ahrens/dp/B018GVH09I/ref=tmm_aiv_swatch_1?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=">purchase it for $9.99</a> on Amazon Prime Video and stream it instantly.</p>
