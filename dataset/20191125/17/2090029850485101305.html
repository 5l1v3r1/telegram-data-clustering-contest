      <p>Recall, Osei was in October attacked on social media by some former employees of Divergent and accused alongside Muyiwa Folorunsho of fraud and maltreatment of employees.</p>
      <p>At the time, Osei denied the allegations but added that she was responding via an “unofficial press release”.</p>
      <p>However, she returned to Twitter on Monday, November 25 to respond fully to her critics.</p>
      <p>She began by saying that she thought of making her lengthy write-up into a book, referring to her attackers as a mob.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>“The collective intelligence of a mob is less than that of a toddler or the early man or a tadpole” You know, I thought of making this into a book. I mean….</i>
      </blockquote>
