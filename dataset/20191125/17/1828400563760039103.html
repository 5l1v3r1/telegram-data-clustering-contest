      <p>In the Bathroom Solutions Blackpool and Fylde Sunday Football Alliance, New Albert advanced to the last eight of the Gledhill Cup.</p>
      <p>They eased to a 7-0 win over the previous round’s giantkillers, Blackpool Elite, thanks to goals from Luke Noble (2), Karl McCloud (2), Lee Barker , John Solanki and Ash Casey.</p>
      <p>FY United also advanced as they beat Cleveleys Town 3-0 thanks to Arran Fleming, Quad Henderson and Lee Hastie.</p>
      <p>Division two side Little Black Pug pulled off the shock of the round as they defeated Premier Division side Clifton Rangers 8-4.</p>
      <p>Layton Seniors and Westview FC also reached the quarter-finals, Layton beating AFC Jacinta 5-2 and Westview seeing off Appletree 4-1.</p>
      <p>The quarter-final draw is: Layton Seniors v Westview; Sandcastle Care or Anchy Belle Vue Rangers v FY United; New Albert v Highfield Social or Newton Arms; Little Black Pug v Bloomfield FC or Lancashire Double Glazing. The matches are due to be played on January 19.</p>
      <p>In the Premier Division, Highfield Social came from three goals down with 20 minutes remaining to draw 3-3 with Ma Kelly’s.</p>
      <p>Dan Morris, Adam Heaney and Corey Harrison put Ma Kelly’s in the lead with Luke Robinson, Pete Tabener and Kieran Trainer responding for Highfield.</p>
      <p>Salon One moved into second place in division one as they defeated Belle Vue 3-1.</p>
      <p>Luke Gunnis put Belle Vue in front as they led 1-0 at half-time, after which Salon One came out fighting.</p>
      <p>It paid off as Ben McKay got his side back into the game with the equaliser before Cameron Greenhall and Keith Hulme added further goals to take all three points.</p>
      <p>21st Century Windows continued their poor run of form as they lost 5-3 to AFC Lane Ends.</p>
      <p>Division two saw Anchy Belle Vue Rangers post a convincing 8-0 win against Highlands.</p>
      <p>Clarence and Marshal Court drew 3-3, while Freckleton ran riot against Fylde Rangers as it ended 8-3.</p>

      <p>SUNDAY’S FIXTURES</p>
      <p>Premier Division: Clifton Rangers v New Albert, FY United v Exceptional Kitchens</p>
      <p>First Division: 21st Century Windows v Westview, AFC Lane Ends Blackpool v Newton Arms, Belle Vue v Appletree Finance, Layton Seniors v Cleveleys Town.</p>

      <p>Lytham Town kept up the pressure on the league leaders in the West Lancashire Football League Premier Division following a 3-2 win at Euxton Villa.</p>
      <p>Danny Thompson played a leading role for Lytham, scoring two of their three goals in what was a topsy-turvy encounter.</p>
      <p>Tom Watson gave them the lead from the penalty spot after just seven minutes, but it was a lead that lasted just seven minutes with Ian Billington levelling for the home side.</p>
      <p>Thompson bagged his first of the afternoon on the half-hour mark but again Euxton hit back soon after, Patrick Bibby equalling just eight minutes later.</p>
      <p>But Thompson completed his brace shortly after the interval to restore Lytham’s lead, and that’s how the scoreline remained for the rest of the match.</p>
      <p>The victory leaves Lytham in second place, level on points with Slyne with Hest who have a superior goal difference.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, Thornton Cleveleys climbed up to eighth with an impressive 1-0 win at fifth-placed Hurst Green.</p>
      <p>Dom Lawson was their goalscorer, finding the back of the net midway through the opening half.</p>
      <p>Thornton overtook local rivals Poulton in the table after they found themselves on the wrong end of a 3-1 defeat to high-flying Fulwood Amateurs.</p>
      <p>Jonty McDonald did the damage for Fulwood with a hat-trick, while Nick Webster ran in Poulton’s solitary effort.</p>
      <p>In Division One, Wyre Villa went down to a 4-0 defeat at Stoneclough, who leapfrog them in the league table.</p>
      <p>Jay Mannion got the first of three goals on 22 minutes, before Jon Stephenson doubled their lead 10 minutes after the break.</p>
      <p>Mannion then ran in another two to round off the scoring for the home side, who are now fifth and one place above Wyre.</p>
      <p>In cup action, meanwhile, Blackpool Wren Rovers exited the Richardson Cup at the first round stage with a heavy 7-2 defeat at Southport Hesketh.</p>
