      <p>This year's Survivor Series pay-per-view featured a traditional Triple Threat Match between the top women from SmackDown Live, Monday Night RAW and WWE NXT. As seen during the show, Team RAW was captained by 10-time WWE Women's Champion <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/charlotte-flair">Charlotte Flair</a>, who during the match had a fallout with one half of the current WWE Women's Tag Team Champions, <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/asuka">Asuka</a>.</p>
      <p>Despite being on the same team, 'The Empress of Tomorrow' and 'The Queen' engaged in a heated argument midway through the match, as the former once again used her traditional green mist on Flair and walked away from the match. <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/wwe/asuka-makes-a-statement-against-charlotte-flair-following-wwe-survivor-series">Asuka later took to social media and sent a message to Flair</a>, to which the latter has now finally responded.</p>
      <h3>Charlotte Flair responds to Asuka</h3>
      <p>Flair and Asuka have had quite the rivalry against each other over the past few months in WWE. Flair was the very first superstar on the WWE roster to defeat 'The Empress of Tomorrow' when she ended the latter's unbeaten streak at WrestleMania 34, and since then the tussle has refused to cool down.</p>
      <p>With WWE now teasing another feud between the two arch-rivals in the aftermath of Survivor Series, Flair has taken to her official Twitter handle in order to respond to Asuka. She has claimed that despite the usage of the green mist, the current WWE Women's Tag Team Champion hasn't been able to defeat 'The Queen' in a WWE ring.</p>
      <p>Here is what Flair replied:</p>

      <blockquote>"Spitting green nonsense out of your mouth doesn’t change the fact that you can’t beat me. However, to your credit, it makes the extensions more expensive," Flair said.</blockquote>
      <p>It remains to be seen how Asuka responds now.</p>
