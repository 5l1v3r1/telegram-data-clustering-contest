      <p>Staffers of the University of Benin on Monday waited several hours for officials from the office of the Accountant-General of the Federation to get enrolled in the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System (IPPIS).</p>
      <p>Some members of the Academic Staff Union of Universities, UNIBEN chapter, said they would participate in the exercise against directive of its national body.</p>
      <p>It was gathered that some UNIBEN staff were still skeptical about the importance of IPPIS.</p>
      <p>They said they were not properly briefed on the exercise.</p>
