      <p><b>LONDON — </b>Jack Grealish shone on his comeback from injury for Aston Villa as Newcastle manager Steve Bruce's return to his former club ended in a dreadful 2-0 Premier League defeat on Monday.</p>
      <p>Goals from Villa's Conor Hourihane and Anwar El Ghazi in the space of four first-half minutes eased their recent woes after a run of three straight defeats.</p>
      <p>Grealish, sidelined for the 2-1 defeats at home to Liverpool and at Wolves with a thigh strain, again provided the spark Villa had been missing in those games.</p>
      <p>Left-back Targett was the victim of a bizarre 20th-minute incident when he vomited on the pitch just after he had taken a throw-in - but after treatment and water the £15.6million summer signing from Southampton was able to continue.</p>
      <p>Villa were always the more threatening side.</p>
      <p>The first arrived in the 32nd minute as Grealish raced onto a raking through ball, only for the attacking midfielder to be blatantly pushed in the back by the covering DeAndre Yedlin a yard outside the area.</p>
      <p>Four minutes later Villa doubled their lead, with Grealish again drawing a foul, although it appeared as if he had deliberately caught the outstretched leg of Federico Fernandez.</p>
      <p>On this occasion, Hourihane curled a piercing low ball into the six-yard box, and with Newcastle's defence leaden-footed, El Ghazi easily stabbed home his fourth goal of the season from three yards.</p>
      <p>It prompted cries from the Villa fans of 'Brucey, Brucey what's the score?' as the home faithful teased their former boss.</p>
      <p>Despite Bruce playing all three substitutes, including strikers Andy Carroll and Dwight Gayle, his side were unable to find a way back into the game.</p>
