      <p>A five-year-old boy who was thrown from the third floor of one of America’s biggest malls by a stranger is now back in school and ‘walking perfectly,’ the youngster’s family said.</p>
      <p>Landen Hoffman’s relatives wrote about the boy’s miraculous recovery on their <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/Landonprayers">GoFundMe page</a> on Friday.</p>
      <p>In the post, family spokesman Noah Hanneman said: ‘He came home with a limp and uneven legs from a two-time broken femur, an open wound on his belly we were taking care of every night, and many follow up appointments and medications.’</p>
      <p>‘Since then he has had many physical therapies to work on his walking…He is now walking PERFECTLY with even legs AMEN.’</p>

      <p>The post continues: ‘The wound has finally scabbed over and new skin is growing, and we are still optimistic he will be off some of his medications soon.’</p>

      <p>Landen suffered gruesome injuries after Emmanuel Aranda, 24, threw him approximately 40 feet onto a marble floor at the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota on April 12.</p>
      <p>Aranda was sentenced to 19 years in jail in July after telling police he had been ‘looking for someone to kill’ after he had been rejected numerous times by women at the mall.</p>
      <p>Landen required more than 15 medical procedures after the attack including: ‘surgeries for two broken arms and a broken leg, removal of his spleen, procedures for fluid in his lungs and stomach, as well as for facial and skull fractures,’ according to his family.</p>
      <p>Doctors also placed a stent in the veins in his liver because of internal injuries.</p>
      <p>The Hoffmans have remained quiet about the horrific incident, asking for privacy, but they have given updates on their GoFundMe campaign, which has raised more than $1 million.</p>
      <p>In Friday’s update, the Landen’s family said: ‘He’s a strong, happy boy. When his mommy asks him if she can look at his wound or asks how he’s doing, he always responds with “Mom, I’m healed, you don’t need to ask me anymore.”‘</p>
      <p>He spent months recovering in the hospital before he was released in August.</p>
