      <p><b>New Delhi:</b> Upon the order of the Delhi High court, the Delhi University has postponed the first semester School of Open Learning (SOL) examinations to May-June 2020, on the dates fixed for the second-semester exams, stated a report.</p>
      <p>Initially, the first-semester exams were scheduled to be conducted in November-December 2019. However, as per the Delhi High Court order dated November 21, the first semester exams will be held in May-June next year. The SOL has also released an official notification in this regard on Monday.</p>
      <p>The HC order was based on the hearing of a plea filed by students seeking the implementation of the semester system from 2020, stated news agency <i>PTI.</i></p>
      <p>The institute has also formed a committee to examine the grievances of the students and to suggest remedies.</p>
      <p>The students have been agitating against the implementation of the Choice Based Credit System (CBCS) in SOL after the varsity took a decision in August.</p>
      <p>Under the CBCS, the school of open learning was asked to switch from annual mode to semester mode to bring it on par with other DU colleges.</p>
      <p>Harish Gautam, a third year student of SOL and a member of Krantikari Yuva Sangathan (KYS), welcomed the notification.</p>
      <p>The KYS has been a frontrunner in demanding that the semester mode be implemented from next year to allow more time for students to get acquainted with the system.</p>
