      <h1>University staff launch 8-day strike across UK</h1>
      <h2>Dispute over pensions, wages and conditions may spread to other institutions next year, union warns</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T17:51:33+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 17:51</time> by <a rel="author">Andrew Jack</a></address>
      <p>Thousands of staff at 60 universities across the UK began <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b60f4328-0d1c-11ea-bb52-34c8d9dc6d84">eight days of strike action</a> on Monday in a dispute over pensions, wages and conditions, as their union raised the prospect of extending action to other institutions early next year.</p>
      <p>The University and College Union (UCU), which represents the 43,500 academic and non-academic employees who voted earlier this month to go on strike, said it had enrolled 3,500 new members since the ballot and would consider holding votes to extend its protests in the coming weeks. </p>
      <p>It called on employers to launch fresh negotiations on improved conditions, and to pull back from “strong-arm” tactics in docking strikers’ pay and issuing warnings to students who refused to turn up for lectures or cross picket lines. </p>
      <p>UCU members at 60 universities voted for eight consecutive work days of industrial action and reported widespread disruption across the country. However, the Universities and Colleges Employers Association, which represents university leaders, played down the impact of the strikes. It said institutions had stepped up efforts to limit the cancellation of lectures and had distributed materials to students. </p>
      <p>It stressed that no action had taken place at 90 universities and Helen Fairfoul, its chief executive, said in a statement: “Early reports from universities are of some low and some medium levels of disruption to teaching.” Universities UK, which represents 136 higher education institutions, said less than 10 per cent of university staff were on strike.</p>
      <p>The University of Liverpool warned in a letter to staff and students that international students who did not cross picket lines risked jeopardising their visas and any who did not attend lectures for which they were registered would be noted as absent and would not receive any special consideration in exams. </p>
      <p>That sparked seven external examiners to the university’s school of law and social justice to resign their roles, accusing the administration <a href="http://warwickucu.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Liverpool-letter-1.pdf">in a letter</a> of the “weaponisation of the UK’s immigration system” and saying to support a picket was “entirely lawful”. </p>
      <p>Several universities, including Stirling and Lancaster, warned that striking staff — including any not in the UCU who did not cross picket lines — would have their pay deducted. Some, including Sheffield, cautioned that there could also be deductions for those who worked only their contracted hours and failed to carry out duties such as marking and giving students feedback. </p>

      <p>While some institutions said pensions as well as pay would be deducted from strikers, others, including Queen Mary University of London, said they would continue to make employer contributions to the pension fund. Birmingham said picket lines on university land would be regarded as trespassing. </p>
      <p>The UCU called on universities to limit the impact of docked pay on striking staff by staggering any deductions over more than a single month. </p>
      <p>Jo Grady, UCU general secretary, called the Liverpool statement a “new low”, while Angela Raynor, Labour’s shadow education secretary, campaigning ahead of the general election in Manchester, told strikers that she would fight the “extortionate” pay of senior administrators and the “marketisation” of higher education. </p>
      <p>In addition to pickets and strikes, some academics who regularly comment on Twitter pledged a “digital picket” in solidarity. A number offered students “teach-outs” with unofficial lectures on subjects including industrial action, the Italian Communist Antonio Gramsci and “picket line dancing”.</p>
