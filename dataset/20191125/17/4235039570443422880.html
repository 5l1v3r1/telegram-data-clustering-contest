      <p>Prime Minister <b>Boyko Borissov</b>'s words to journalists on his way to the US that he would not allow a <b>NATO</b> Black Sea military base on the territory of Bulgaria have drawn criticism from the <b>Atlantic Council</b> in Bulgaria, <a href="http://bnr.bg/en/post/101196225/atlantic-council-boyko-borisov-s-statement-he-would-not-allow-nato-black-sea-military-base-is-bad-signal">BNR</a> reported.</p>
      <p>They said that such a statement did not fit what a prime minister of a <b>NATO</b> Member should say. Only a neutral country trying to balance between <b>NATO</b> and Russia could say such a thing, but not Bulgaria, whose commitments to the allies require it to be a secure, worthy and reliable member of the Alliance. With that said, the Prime Minister's to the US actually began with a mistake, the <b>Atlantic Council</b> is convinced.</p>
