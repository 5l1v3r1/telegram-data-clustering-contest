      <p>A man who refused an oral fluid test after being pulled over by police has been disqualified from driving for four years.</p>
      <p>Casey Cini pleaded guilty at the Ballarat Magistrates Court on Monday.</p>
      <p>Police prosecutor Senior Constable Steve Repac told the court Cini was intercepted by police for driving a trailer without a number plate on the Western Highway near Bungaree in May.</p>
      <p>He said police detected Cini driving at 125km/h in a 110km/h zone.</p>
      <p>Senior Constable Repac said an initial test indicated an illicit substance in Cini's oral fluid.</p>
      <p>When taken to the police oral fluid testing vehicle, Cini said he wished to refuse the oral fluid test because he had his children in the car.</p>
      <p>Senior Constable Repac said Cini was informed of the consequences of refusing the test.</p>
      <p>A Ballarat defence lawyer said Cini had not used drugs since his previous offending but misunderstood the requirements of the testing, believing he would have to wait on the roadside with his children for three hours.</p>
      <p>The defence lawyer said Cini was the sole income earner for his partner and five children and would need to find alternative employment due to his loss of licence.</p>
      <p>The lawyer asked Ms Torres to take into account the role the licence loss would play in deterrence and the effect it would have on him and his family.</p>
      <p>Ms Torres told the court she took into account Cini's situation in sentencing, but the mandatory minimum for a subsequent offence of refusing an oral fluid test was a four year licence cancellation.</p>
      <p>"I accept from your discussion with police you didn't realise the incredible impact of the decision you made that day," she said.</p>
      <p>In addition, Cinni was convicted and fined $250, an amount Ms Torres said was reduced because of the considerable impact of his loss of licence.</p>
      <p>The court heard a number of other unrelated driving matters on Monday resulting in fines and loss of licences.</p>
      <p>Scott Trezise, 57, received a mandatory minimum 12 month licence cancellation for a blood alcohol reading of 0.091, three months disqualification for speeding and a $1000 fine.</p>
      <p>Ms Torres sentenced Edwin Uthenwoldt, 44, to a mandatory six months licence cancellation and a $200 fine for driving with cannabis detected in his oral fluid.</p>
      <p>Wayne Black, 59, received a six month licence cancellation and a $250 fine for recording a 0.060 blood alcohol reading after being caught in Avoca.</p>
      <p>In another unrelated case, the court heard 56-year-old Stephen O'Loughlin lost his licence for 19 months and was fined $400 for recording a high blood alcohol limit.</p>
      <p>Police prosecutor Senior Constable Steve Repac said police intercepted O'Loughlin just after 11pm at Snake Valley and recorded a blood alcohol reading of 0.193 at the police station.</p>
      <p>O'Loughlin told police drank eight cans of Wild Turkey at the Snake Valley Hotel.</p>
      <p>When police asked his reason for driving, O'Loughlin said he did not think he was over the limit.</p>
      <p>Representing himself, O'Loughlin told the court choosing to drive home was a 'stupid decision' he would 'regret for the rest of his life'.</p>
      <p>Ms Torres convicted and fined O'Loughlin $400 and cancelled his licence for 19 months.</p>
      <p>"I can't believe you would think you would not be over," she said.</p>
      <p>"I am sure you know now what you did was very dangerous. You could have killed yourself or somebody else."</p>
