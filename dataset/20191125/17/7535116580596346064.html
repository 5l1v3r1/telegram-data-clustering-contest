      <p>An adorable moment was recorded on video where a baby koala bear tried to â€˜hitch a rideâ€™ from a doggy it met in a backyard and refused to get off!</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7545049/Miniature-schnauzer-looks-bemused-koala-joey-hitches-ride-Adelaide-Hills.html">Daily Mail</a>, Henry from Adelaide Hills in South Australia took his miniature schnauzer, Tony, for a walk into the backyard on 6th October. This was when they stumbled upon a baby koala bear that seemed to have lost its mama bear.</p>

      <p>The koala then latched itself onto Tonyâ€™s fur as Tony walked around a little startled at why this tiny creature was on his back.</p>
      <p>The koala then climbed up onto Tonyâ€™s back and clung on tightly, not wanting to let go even though Tony tried to gently shake it off.</p>

      <p>Eventually, Tony sat down and rolled around in an attempt to get the baby koala to let go, but the marsupial just held on even tighter.</p>
      <p>In the end, the koala finally got the hint and let go of Tony before climbing back up into the trees.</p>

      <p>Henry said that it wasnâ€™t uncommon to see koalas in the area but this is first time he had seen one get so up close and personal.</p>

        <i>Aiyo, this is the cutest thing Iâ€™ve ever seen! Hopefully the little koala bear was reunited with his mama bear again.Â </i>
