      <p>Travala, a service that allows its users to pay for hotel stays with cryptocurrency, will now let its customers reserve any hotel that is bookable through Booking.com.</p>
      <p>Travala announced in a <a href="https://blog.travala.com/travala-com-booking-com-strategic-partnership-targets-massive-crypto-adoption/">press release</a> on Nov. 25 that it has already integrated Booking’s accommodations to its platform. The new feature will purportedly allow users to book 90,000 different destinations using cryptocurrencies. </p>
      <h3>Pay for your stay with crypto</h3>
      <p>Travala’s customers can pay with its proprietary AVA token and 20 major crypto assets including Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price-index">BTC</a>), Ether (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price-index">ETH</a>), Dash (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/dash-price-index">DASH</a>), Bitcoin Cash (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price-index">BCH</a>), Litecoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/ltc-price-index">LTC</a>), <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/eos-price-index">EOS</a>, Stellar (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/stellar-price-index">XLM</a>), Cardano (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/ada-price-index">ADA</a>), Binance Chain (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/binance-coin-price-index">BNB</a>), Monero (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/xmr-price-index">XMR</a>), Tron (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tron-price-index">TRX</a>), <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/xrp-price-index">XRP</a> and Dai (<a href="https://coin360.com/coin/dai-dai">DAI</a>). The firm’s CEO Matt Luczynski commented:</p>
      <blockquote>“This partnership allows our users to access Booking.com’s accommodation listings, as well as the listings from several other leading travel suppliers, which is a fantastic use case for our own AVA token and another huge step towards mass cryptocurrency adoption.”</blockquote>
      <p>Also on Nov. 25, Travala <a href="https://twitter.com/travalacom/status/1198919076388560896">announced</a> that its proprietary token was listed on the decentralized exchange Binance DEX and is currently trading against Binance Coin on the platform.</p>
      <h3>Crytpo expands into tourism</h3>
      <p>Different travel and tourism companies worldwide have begun adding support for cryptocurrencies as payment options. Earlier this month, Alternative Airlines, a travel company based in the United Kingdom, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/travel-company-allows-customers-to-book-flights-with-bitcoin">partnered</a> with cryptocurrency service Utrust to facilitate payments with crypto.</p>
      <p>Earlier this summer, the co-founders of Scandinavian air carrier Norwegian Air <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-payments-priority-for-norwegian-air-says-senior-executive">announced </a>plans to launch their own cryptocurrency exchange, which will subsequently facilitate the airline’s acceptance of cryptocurrency payments.</p>
