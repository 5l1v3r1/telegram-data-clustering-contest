      <h1>Bliss on the Bosphorus: The best luxury hotels in Istanbul</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T17:10:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 17:10</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/terry-richardson/" target="_blank">Terry Richardson</a></address>
      <p>Istanbul has a long history of luxurious living, with a succession of Byzantine emperors and Ottoman sultans living life to the max in their well-appointed, labyrinthine palaces. The Byzantine royal dwellings have crumbled to virtual ruin, but the Ottoman Topkapı Palace has been beautifully preserved and draws millions of visitors each year. For visitors with the means, it’s easy to emulate the opulence of this glorious past by staying in one of the stylish hotels below, all bar one located in an historic and/or Bosphorus waterfront location.</p>

      <p>8 Telegraph expert rating</p>
      <p>The hotel is located just a few waterfront lots up from the famous Dolmabahçe Palace, home of the last Ottoman sultans. From the terrace at the front, complete with grandiose fountain, guests can admire the stunning views across the Bosphorus strait to the hills of Asia. The large outdoor pool is great for a proper swim, the adjacent whirlpool tub and decking are ideal for lounging – especially with that fabulous vista. If you want some real Ottoman style go for a room in the Palace building – those looking onto the water have large, keyhole shaped floor-to-ceiling windows, high ceilings, chic tubs in the gleaming marble bathrooms, and more. <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/turkey/istanbul/hotels/four-seasons-hotel-istanbul-at-the-bosphorous//">Read expert review</a> From £ 271 per night <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/tr/four-seasons-istanbul-at-the-bosphorus.html?aid=839822;label=TMG-1travel1destinations1europe1turkey1istanbul1articles1best0luxury0hotels0istanbul-Four2Seasons2Hotel2Istanbul2at2the2Bosphorous">Check availability</a> Rates provided by Booking.com</p>

      <p>They don’t come more history-filled or atmospheric than this. The elegant, restrained Neo-Classical façade of the seven-storey building does little to prepare you for the opulence of the perfectly preserved interior, which looks very much like it must have done in the 1920s when Agatha Christie stayed. The Kubbeli Lounge on the ground floor is a real focal point, with its six glass domes, a grandiloquent crystal chandelier, Moorish-style arches and walls clad in bands of marble of contrasting colours. The hotel is ideally placed for visitors who value eating out and enjoying Istanbul's vibrant nightlife. The spa is as luxurious as one would expect from a hotel that once hosted Greta Garbo. <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/turkey/istanbul/hotels/pera-palace-hotel//">Read expert review</a> From £ 124 per night <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/tr/pera-palace.html?aid=839822;label=TMG-1travel1destinations1europe1turkey1istanbul1articles1best0luxury0hotels0istanbul-Pera2Palace2Hotel">Check availability</a> Rates provided by Booking.com</p>

      <p>9 Telegraph expert rating</p>
      <p>The St Regis brings a splash of New York chic to the upmarket district of Nişantaşı. Noted Turkish architect Emre Arolat went for a long, low and linear design, and art of the the charm here is that it isn't a tourist bubble (locals pop by for afternoon tea or a cocktail in the smart ground floor bar, and dine in the excellent rooftop restaurant). Butler service comes as standard, so guests feel well-looked after from the start. Muted tones, veneered furniture, plain upholstery, curtains and plush carpets in the rooms are enlivened by signature artwork and potted plants – all set-off by floor-to-ceiling windows that run the entire width. <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/turkey/istanbul/hotels/st-regis-istanbul-hotel//">Read expert review</a> From £ 198 per night <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/tr/the-st-regis-istanbul.html?aid=839822;label=TMG-1travel1destinations1europe1turkey1istanbul1articles1best0luxury0hotels0istanbul-The2St.2Regis2Istanbul">Check availability</a> Rates provided by Booking.com</p>

      <p>Istanbul, Turkey</p>
      <p>9 Telegraph expert rating</p>
      <p>Built in Turkish Neoclassical style in 1919, the hotel is all pointed arched windows, heavily overhanging eaves and decorative tile panels. Rooms knock you out in terms of interior design, but immediately make you feel at home and want to spend time there: subtle, contrasting hues, with soft carpets, full-length curtains, traditional-style wooden furniture and art that gives a nod to Istanbul's Ottoman past. For superb sunset views try the rooftop A'ya Terrace, which has great cocktails and 'finger food' menu, and elsewhere there's also health club offering Balinese massage treatments. The gardens are heavy with the scent of jasmine and bougainville add a splash of vibrant colour. <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/turkey/istanbul/hotels/four-seasons-hotel-istanbul-at-sultanahmet//">Read expert review</a> From £ 231 per night <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/tr/four-seasons-istanbul-at-sultanahmet.html?aid=839822;label=TMG-1travel1destinations1europe1turkey1istanbul1articles1best0luxury0hotels0istanbul-Four2Seasons2Hotel2Istanbul2at2Sultanahmet">Check availability</a> Rates provided by Booking.com</p>

      <p>9 Telegraph expert rating</p>
      <p>Unlike the majority of luxury hotels in Istanbul, Raffles does not pay homage to the city’s bygone eras, but stands instead as a symbol of a modern, self-confident Turkey. From the outside the hotel is that rarest of things, a beautifully designed tower block, saved from international-modern blandness by the irregularly shaped balconies segmenting it; Inside it is quite a different beast, with all the public spaces adorned with an eclectic mix of Turkish and international art. All guests are assigned a personal butler. Service is attentive without being obsequious. Though the décor of the rooms is restrained, with neutral hued walls, floors and ceilings, there are enough opulent splashes of pattern, texture and colour to give them a comfortable feel. <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/turkey/istanbul/hotels/raffles-istanbul-hotel//">Read expert review</a> From £ 329 per night <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/tr/raffles-istanbul.html?aid=839822;label=TMG-1travel1destinations1europe1turkey1istanbul1articles1best0luxury0hotels0istanbul-Raffles2Istanbul">Check availability</a> Rates provided by Booking.com</p>

      <p>The views from the front rooms and restaurant terrace are superb at this former tobacco warehouse, virtually hugging the waterfront on the European side of the historic Bosphorus Strait. Step through into the glittering marble, gilt and lacquer work of the impressively spacious lobby running the full depth of the building and you'll struggle to imagine its origins. The majority of the 17 suite rooms have their own private terrace, with the most expensive on the corners of the hotel with panoramic views of the waterfront and Asia. Service is extremely good and surprisingly personal for what is a large hotel, with everyone from housekeeping to bar staff greeting guests by name. <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/turkey/istanbul/hotels/shangri-la-bosphorus-hotel//">Read expert review</a> From £ 217 per night <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/tr/shangri-la-bosphorus-istanbul.html?aid=839822;label=TMG-1travel1destinations1europe1turkey1istanbul1articles1best0luxury0hotels0istanbul-Shangri0La2Bosphorus%2C2Istanbul">Check availability</a> Rates provided by Booking.com</p>
