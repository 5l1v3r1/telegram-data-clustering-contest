      <p>“There’s certain things about raising a man that I can’t know,” she explained. “I would tell [Will], ‘Love your daughter, let me teach her,’ because there’s certain sensitivities that you might not understand and have just because of your relationship in the world is different than a woman’s relationship.”</p>
      <p>And according to Pinkett-Smith, Willow, 19, has corrected Smith when he says something wrong.</p>
      <p>“I understood that because I’m in this house with Will and he be saying the craziest stuff. He don’t understand the level,” she said. “And thank God he has me and he’s got Willow … we educate that joker before he leaves this house. You know what I mean?… He’s one of those that likes to tell stories and sometimes goes too far.”</p>

      <p>Adding, “Willow has gone at her dad several times for very insensitive comments, whether it’s around menstruation or, you know, ‘You must be PMS-ing,’ and she’s like, ‘That right there, we not gon’ do that.’”</p>
      <p>New episodes of “Red Table Talk” air on Facebook Watch every Monday.</p>
