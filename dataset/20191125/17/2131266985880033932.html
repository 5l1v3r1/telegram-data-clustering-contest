      <p>A jewellery heist in Germany has seen thieves nab cultural treasures worth as much as 1 billion euro (NZ$ 1.7 billion).</p>
      <p>The jewellery - which has "immeasurable worth" - was taken from the Grüne Gewölbe (Green Vault) in the city of Dresden on Monday (local time).</p>
      <p>Thieves entered the museum at dawn after a fire at an electrical distribution point nearby led to power being cut in the area and the museum's alarm being deactivated.</p>
      <p>They smashed a window and cut through a fence before entering the museum's Jewel Room, where they broke open a display cabinet and nabbed three diamond jewellery sets.</p>

      <p>Police arrived on the scene just before 5am, but it was too late. A burning car found early on Monday may have been the crooks' getaway vehicle, police believe.</p>
      <p>Roadblocks have been set up on motorways around the city but the thieves remain on the loose.</p>
      <p>The value of the lost treasures has been called "priceless".</p>
      <p>"We cannot give a value because it is impossible to sell," Marion Ackermann, director of Dresden's state art collections told <i>The Guardian</i>. "The material value doesn’t reflect the historic meaning."</p>
      <p>German media have put the value as high as 1 billion euro.</p>
      <p>"The items cannot be sold on the art market legally - they're too well known," Ackerman told the BBC.</p>
      <p>She said there were fears the thieves would break the collection into pieces.</p>
      <p>The collection was created in 1723 by the ruler of Saxony, Augustus the Strong.</p>
      <p>"Three out of 10 diamond sets have gone," said Ackermann. </p>
      <p> The Grüne Gewölbe is one of the oldest museums in Europe.</p>
