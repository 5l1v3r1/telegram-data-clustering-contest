      <p>After showing remarkable sportsmanship in a frustrating year, Kiwi Shane van Gisbergen has been rewarded with the Barry Sheene Medal as Supercars' best-and-fairest driver.</p>
      <p>Van Gisbergen endured a testing 2019 season, finishing a distant second in the drivers' championship behind fierce compatriot Scott McLaughlin, who claimed back-to-back titles.</p>
      <p>But the Holden star didn't walk away empty-handed, securing the best-and-fairest gong for the first time at the Supercars end-of-season awards in Sydney on Monday night.</p>
      <p>The award - named after the late motorcycle world champion and popular Supercars commentator - is decided by votes from motorsport journalists.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Despite finishing 562 points shy of Ford driver McLaughlin in the standings, van Gisbergen was still impressive behind the wheel, with five race wins, four poles and 12 podiums.</p>
      <p>But van Gisbergen arguably won the most fans for his actions out of the car, showing unprecedented chivalry at the Gold Coast 600 last month.</p>
      <p>Van Gisbergen stunned onlookers, when he dramatically jumped out of his Holden to help McLaughlin, after his rival sensationally crashed in Gold Coast 600 qualifying.</p>

      <p>The act revealed a different side to van Gisbergen, who had appeared to cut a bitter figure, as he tried to reel in McLaughlin's series lead.</p>
      <p>Van Gisbergen was particularly frustrated by his Bathurst 1000 finish, where he looked set to make a dent in McLaughlin's championship buffer and claim a maiden Great Race in early October.</p>
      <p>But McLaughlin's DJR Team Penske teammate Fabian Coulthard infamously held up the Bathurst field during a late safety-car period - in which cars can't overtake - eliminating the fuel advantage of a fast-finishing van Gisbergen.</p>
      <p>Van Gisbergen eventually placed second, just 0.68 seconds behind McLaughlin.</p>
      <p>DJR Team Penske copped the heaviest penalty available to officials - a $250,000 fine and deduction of 300 championship points.</p>
      <p>McLaughlin kept the Bathurst win, even after his team were later penalised again, when officials discovered DJR Team Penske had also committed an engine rule breach at Mount Panorama.</p>
      <p>Rival drivers sledged McLaughlin, with Holden's <a href="https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/sport/2019/11/supercars-kiwi-scott-mclaughlin-compared-to-disgraced-cyclist-lance-armstrong.html">Scott Pye even comparing the Kiwi to disgraced cyclist Lance Armstrong on social media.</a></p>
      <p>But McLaughlin, who won a record 18 races in 2019, was still popular with fans, earning the Favourite Driver Award, decided by public vote, for the second straight year.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Bryce Fullwood was officially crowned Super2 champion, while rookie Tyler Everingham won the Mike Kable Young Gun Award on Monday night.</p>
