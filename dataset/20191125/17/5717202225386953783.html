      <h1>Mourinho’s snub should convince Whiteman to seek January Tottenham exit</h1>
      <h2>Brandon Austin was named on the bench.</h2>

      <p>Tottenham Hotspur goalkeeper Alfie Whiteman should seek an exit in the January transfer window – either on loan or permanently.</p>
      <p>The young goalkeeper is a boyhood Tottenham fan and he will want to make it with the North London club. But for the sake of his own career, he should think about his options. Here’s why.</p>
      <h3>Mourinho’s snub</h3>
      <p>Spurs goalkeeper Hugo Lloris has been injured for a while but Mauricio Pochettino brought in Michael Vorm as cover. However, the Dutchman recently picked up an injury in training and he will be out for a while.</p>
      <p>Paulo Gazzaniga gets the starting spot but with Vorm out, Whiteman would have been eyeing a place on the bench. But Jose Mourinho had other ideas, naming Brandon Austin as his second-choice goalkeeper on Saturday.</p>
      <h3>Whiteman drops down the pecking order</h3>

      <p>For the past few years, Whiteman has been a regular in Tottenham’s youth teams. He started this season as the U23 starting goalkeeper and he has been on the first-team bench before.</p>
      <p>But Austin and Jonathan De Bie have been sharing the goalkeeper duties recently. Whiteman might be injured but there is no word from the club. He might just be out of favour instead.</p>
      <h3>Loan or permanent move</h3>
      <p>If Whiteman has now dropped behind Austin and De Bie, he is not even likely to get games in the academy. The 21-year-old should now be looking for a new club in January.</p>
      <p>At this stage of his career, he needs to think about getting some senior minutes under his belt. If that’s a loan spell, he could convince Mourinho to give him a chance next season. But if that means leaving permanently, it might just be a sacrifice that has to be made.</p>
