      <p>Gold Cup winner Al Boum Photo is likely to follow the route that was so successful for him last season – and bid for another triumph in the Savills Chase at Tramore on his reappearance.</p>
      <p>The Listed contest, over two miles five and a half furlongs on January 1, was the seven-year-old’s only run before his Cheltenham glory – and trainer Willie Mullins is inclined to stick to that tried-and-tested path.</p>
      <p>The alternative is the Grade One of the same name at Leopardstown on December 28.</p>
      <p>“He’ll be out at Christmas or the new year,” said Mullins.</p>
      <p>“He’ll go to one of the Savills Chases – either Leopardstown or back to Tramore.</p>
      <p>“I’ve found following the same successful path as the year before is often good.</p>
      <p>“While it might not be fashionable to go to Tramore, it worked for him, so I wouldn’t rule that out.</p>
      <p>“I’d say it’s probably a better chance he’d go to Tramore – especially if the ground at Leopardstown stays good.”</p>
