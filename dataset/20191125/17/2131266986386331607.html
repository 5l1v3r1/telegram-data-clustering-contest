      <h1>Rugby league: NRL considers golden point tweak for 2020 season</h1>

      <p>NRL boss Todd Greenberg has confirmed the golden-point system may receive a shake-up next season, with a competition point given to the losing team.</p>
      <p>But Greenberg was adamant the under-fire golden-point concept would not be scrapped, saying he was no fan of drawn games.</p>
      <p>Introduced for the 2003 season, the golden-point format has been criticised in recent years, with critics claiming teams that lost a game lasting more than 80 minutes did not deserve to walk away empty-handed.</p>
      <p>Greenberg said that was a possibility for 2020, with a golden-point tweak to be discussed at the December 5 independent commission meeting.</p>
      <p>The topic has already been spoken about at the NRL's competition committee a fortnight ago and at last Friday's NRL coaches conference.</p>

      <p>If introduced, it may also shake up how competition points are awarded.</p>
      <p>Under the proposed change, the NRL may adopt the AFL system, winning teams earn four points, while teams winning golden-point games would earn three points and the loser one.</p>
      <p>Greenberg said the golden-point tweaks had been a major talking point at the competition and coaches meetings.</p>
      <p>"At the moment, it is simply an idea," he said. "It is a proposal and, ultimately, the commission will talk about that, when they meet at the end of next week."</p>
      <p>Asked if teams should get a point after losing a golden-point fixture, Greenberg said: "I am not sure if they should, but they certainly could under this proposal.</p>
      <p>"It's been talked about a lot in recent times, about when you get to the end of 80 minutes, whether there should be just reward for that [losing] team.</p>
      <p>"It is a discussion and a proposal at the moment."</p>
      <p>Greenberg said reverting to a system where teams finish with a draw if scores are locked up after 80 minutes was not on the table.</p>
      <p>"No, there has been no discussion with me and certainly I have been a strong proponent for supporting the concept of golden point," he said.</p>
      <p>"The numbers speak for themselves. When you get to the end of 80 minutes, our ratings numbers on both broadcast partners go through the roof, when we hit that [golden point] period.</p>
      <p>"We understand what business we are in. We are in the entertainment business, and we are going to continue to find ways to innovate the game and make sure fans are fully engaged with us."</p>
