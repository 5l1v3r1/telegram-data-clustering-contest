          <b>Cork City Council has issued a tidal flood warning as the remnants of Storm Sebastien look set to hit Ireland this week.</b>

      <p><a href="https://www.buzz.ie/news/sebastien-risk-flooding-met-eireann-344058"><b><i>Tropical Storm Sebastien</i></b></a> is moving north-east from the Atlantic and is set to land in Ireland on Monday and continue into Tuesday, possibly bringing heavy rain and a risk of flooding.</p>
      <p>The US National Hurricane Centre (NHC) confirmed the Atlantic’s 18th named storm of 2019, which formed last week, had suddenly intensified in strength after it had initially been predicted to weaken quite quickly.</p>
      <p>Due to the impending arrival of Storm Sebastien, the Cork City Council (CCC) say that there will be a period of very high astronomical Spring Tides from Tuesday until Wednesday.</p>

      <p>A tidal surge and periodic strong southerly/south-easterly winds are also predicted over the next few days. These factors combined will result in tide levels higher than the natural tide levels.</p>
      <p>From Tuesday morning until Wednesday evening, prior to and after these tides, the CCC says there is a significant risk of tidal flooding in the City.</p>
      <p>Householders and Businesses have been advised to take Precautionary Measures to protect property.</p>
      <p>It is likely that flooding will occur in the low lying areas of the City Centre in particular on Morrison’s Quay, Fr. Mathew Quay, Fr. Mathew Street, Union Quay, Trinity Bridge, South Terrace, Lavitts Quay, Kyrls Street, Kyrls Quay, Crosses Green, Sharman Crawford St and Wandesford Quay.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>There is also a risk of flooding along Lapps Quay, McSwiney Quay, Albert Quay, Kennedy Quay, Proby’s Quay, French’s Quay, Lancaster Quay, Sullivan’s Quay, South Mall via side streets onto Oliver Plunkett St., St. Patrick Street, Grand Parade, Washington Street, and Lower Glanmire Road.</p>
      <p>The situation will continue to be monitored and further advice will be issued, the CCC said.</p>
      <p>Cork City Council have a limited stock of gel-bags and sand-bags available for collection between 12pm and 6pm today, and 8am and 6pm tomorrow.</p>

      <p>A number of road closures and traffic restrictions will be put in place. These will be introduced prior to flood events in order to reduce any negative impact of traffic movements through standing water. Any restrictions will be eased as appropriate.</p>
