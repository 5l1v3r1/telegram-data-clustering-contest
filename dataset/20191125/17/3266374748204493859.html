      <h1>Transfer Rumour: Leeds United, Aston Villa eyeing January loan move for Liverpool striker Rhian Brewster</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T17:22:13+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 17:22</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.thehardtackle.com/author/varun-madhav/" target="_blank">Keshav Awasty</a></address>
      <h3>Liverpool teenage sensation Rhian Brewster is reportedly on the radar of two of English football’s iconic clubs, Leeds United and Aston Villa.</h3>
      <p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/football/liverpool-sanction-rhian-brewster-loan-20951160">Daily Star</a>, Rhian Brewster is primed to leave Liverpool on a temporary basis in the January transfer window. Leeds United and Aston Villa are among the clubs showing an interest in the teenager, who is also the subject of interest from Crystal Palace and Swansea City.</p>
      <p>Brewster came through the ranks at Chelsea before choosing to finish his youth career at Liverpool, joining them in 2014. However, since graduating from the Liverpool academy, the 19-year-old has had to bide his time, thanks also in part to a long-term ankle injury.</p>
      <p>Now back to full fitness, Brewster has understandably played second fiddle to Roberto Firmino, <a href="http://www.thehardtackle.com/opinion/roberto-firmino-the-red-fermenter-with-the-samba-flavour">who is an indispensable player for Jurgen Klopp</a>. In fact, his only appearances for Liverpool this season have come in the Carabao Cup, which ought to be rather frustrating after Klopp blocked a loan move in the summer, citing the possibility of a bigger role in the Reds’ first-team setup.</p>

      <p>With game-time hard to come by, it appears as if Klopp is now finally set to sanction a temporary move away from Liverpool for Brewster, and there are plenty of clubs interested in the teenage sensation. In particular, two iconic English clubs are keen on the player, namely Leeds United and Aston Villa.</p>
      <p>At Leeds, Marcelo Bielsa currently has Patrick Bamford and Eddie Nketiah as the only strikers at his disposal. But, Nketiah could reportedly be set to have his loan deal cut short by Arsenal after starting just twice till date this season.</p>
      <p>Should Nketiah indeed make his way back to Emirates, Bielsa would be in need of a striker, making Brewster a viable short-term target. So, after <a href="http://www.thehardtackle.com/news/2019/08/07/transfer-news-leeds-united-closing-in-on-7-million-ryan-kent-capture">targeting Ryan Kent in the summer</a>, Leeds have their sights set on another Liverpool player ahead of the January window.</p>
      <p>Aston Villa, on the other hand, have struggled for goals this season, with Wesley the only player finding the back of the net on a consistent basis. But, therein lies a potential problem for Brewster, who might be behind another Brazilian in the pecking order, albeit at Villa Park.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, for Aston Villa, the Liverpool striker is an attractive option. Brewster, meanwhile, is also courting interest from Swansea City and Crystal Palace, meaning a transfer battle to secure his services in the January transfer window could be brewing.</p>
      <p>The report suggests that Liverpool are happy to let Brewster leave on loan in the winter window to resume his progress. It now remains to be seen which club ends up landing the teenage prodigy, as a January move beckons.</p>
