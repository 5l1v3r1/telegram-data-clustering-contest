      <p>Dez Bryant took a swipe at Jason Garrett late in the fourth quarter as the Dallas Cowboys tried desperately to come back against the New England Patriots at Gillette Stadium.</p>
      <p>Immediately after Garrett elected to kick a field goal instead of going for it on 4th down with about six minutes to go in the game, Bryant took to Twitter and casually ripped Jason Garrett and the entire coaching staff.</p>

      <p>I mean, he’s not wrong here.</p>
      <p>The Cowboys boast one of the most talented teams in the league, yet they can’t put it together to defeat a single team that’s above .500 in 2019.</p>
