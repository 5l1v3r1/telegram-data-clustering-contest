      <p><b>(CBS) —</b> According to a report from <a href="https://newyork.cbslocal.com/2017/12/18/most-popular-holiday-greeting/">CBS New York</a>, most Americans choose to say "Merry Christmas" rather than Happy Holidays," yet most adults say they believe the religious aspects of Christmas are less emphasized than they used to be.</p>
      <p>"Christmas is on everybody's tongue," said Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute. "Supposedly a war against Christmas, but 67 percent say that at this time of year, 'Merry Christmas' is the greeting that they tend to use."</p>
      <p>Only 25% said they prefer "Happy Holidays," and 4% say they don't use any holiday greetings at all.</p>
      <p>The report cites a poll conducted by <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/MonmouthPoll_US_121417/">Monmouth University</a> which also asked respondents about their favorite holiday movie.</p>
      <p>“Rudolph gets 32 percent of the vote, Charlie Brown gets 25 percent, the Grinch comes in third at 14 and Frosty the Snowman at 12,” Murray said.</p>
