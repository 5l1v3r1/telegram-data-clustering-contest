      <h1>Two turkeys named Bread and Butter will battle for White House pardon</h1>

      <p>Two turkeys named Bread and Butter will duke it out to be the toast of the town at this year’s presidential pardoning.</p>
      <p>The names of the bulbous butterballs were unveiled Monday during a press conference at the Willard InterContinental Hotel in the nation’s capital — where the duo will be crashing before learning their fate at the White House on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>“What a wonderful start of the Thanksgiving week,” the hotel’s general manager, Markus Platzer, said as he opened the naming ceremony. “As far as you can see, they’re very comfortable. Had a wonderful night’s stay with us. They’re very white, so they had a shower.”</p>
      <p>The two North Carolina birds were hand-selected to be part of the annual White House tradition that saw President Trump <a href="https://nypost.com/2018/11/20/trump-makes-recount-joke-during-turkey-pardoning/">pick Peas over Carrots</a> last year.</p>
      <p>This year’s fowls got their names from Trump and first lady Melania, who picked from 15 pairs of names submitted by the National Turkey Federation. The first couple also had the choice of selecting their own monikers, but they went with two of the submitted names, Kerry Doughty, the federation’s 2019 chairman, said Monday.</p>
      <p>“It’s a real honor and a privilege for me to be here doing this event and representing the turkey industry,” said Doughty, who worked for Butterball for 40 years. “This is the 72nd year we’ll be presenting turkeys to the White House through 13 administrations.”</p>
      <p>A hefty 47 pounds, Butter loves sweet potato fries, bagpipes and watching NASCAR, while his carb-friendly counterpart Bread, who’s two pounds lighter, enjoys guzzling Cheerwine soda, listening to bluegrass and watching college hoops, according to the White House.</p>

      <p>The presentation of a turkey to the White House began in 1947 when President Harry Truman was in office. But it wasn’t until 1989 that the tradition of pardoning the birds began, starting with a proclamation signed by President George H.W. Bush.</p>
      <p>It’s now up to the public <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/gobble/">to vote on who gets plucked for the pardon</a> this year. The results will be announced at the pardoning ceremony Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Fortunately for the lucky turkeys, neither will be on the dinner table for Thanksgiving — pardon or not. Both birds will be shipped off to retirement at Gobblers Rest at Virginia Polytechnic Institute, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/23/us/turkeys-presidential-pardon-thanksgiving-trnd/index.html">CNN said</a>.</p>
