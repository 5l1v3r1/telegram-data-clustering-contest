      <p>More than 200 charities and voluntary organisations are set to receive in excess of £200,000 thanks to the efforts of thousands of Sutton Coldfield fun runners.</p>
      <p>Collectively, participants at this year’s Great Midlands Fun Run in June had raised £229,685 event director Tracey Spare revealed at the event’s annual autumnal presentation night held at Duke Street Church on Sunday (November 24).</p>
      <p>Since 2003 those taking part in the 8.5 mile run around Sutton’s streets and Sutton Park have raised an amazing £3.58 million to help others.</p>

      <p>Tracey paid tribute to Don Edmond who was chairman of the Royal Sutton Fun Run for its first 10 years from 1982 who he described as an ‘incredibly kind, warm-hearted individual and a gentleman in every sense of the word’.</p>
      <p>He spoke of the ‘five side effects of kindness’ – making people happier, good for the heart, slowing ageing, improving relationships and kindness being contagious and said the fun run was the ‘perfect example’ of that.</p>
      <p>He said: “I and others have developed lifelong relationships as a result of the fun run. There does seem to be a degree of moment in the country to support a little more kindness.”</p>
      <p>And the fun run is in challenging times, competing with a number of new events for people’s attention – which has led to fewer entrants this year and a drop in sponsorship money.</p>
      <p>In 2020 the 13km Great Midlands Fun Run will compete for entrants with Birmingham’s 10k event – which organisers have booked on the same day – May 31! The fun run having been long-established on the end Sunday of the May half term week.</p>
      <p>But the event is there for its fundraising – and some of the organisations set to benefit were highlighted on the night.</p>
      <p>Each year the team that raises the most money is honoured and this year The Streetly Academy scooped the Cookes Storage Service Team Challenge Award having raised a stupendous £14,258 for Teenage Cancer Trust.</p>

      <p>The school rallied behind pupil Tianna McManus, who was diagnosed with bone cancer in her left wrist, before going in to Year 10 and took a year away from school to battle the condition.</p>
      <p>Teacher Jonny Boyes who organised the school’s team and said the idea ‘snowballed’ when they decided to raise money for the Teenage Cancer Trist.</p>
      <p>Tianna’s mum Tina said: “The support the Teenage Cancer Trust gave to not only Tianna but all the teenagers in this region, I can’t thank them enough. The units make children feel like they are at home. The support staff stay in touch with them even after all the treatment’s done and help them on their journey.” On the night Tianna received a ‘rare’ Excitable Edgar dragon, star of the new John Lewis ad!</p>
      <p>Former Sutton Coldfield Observer photographer, Paul Johnson, spoke about The Friends of Alfie Johnson, set up to help his son, and which now helps disabled children and families across the Black Country. As well as the £1,200 raised by fun runners the charity also raised £13,000 through a summer ball.</p>
      <p>The Good Hope Hospital Charity had more than 100 people take part this year, raising £7,200 for the Sutton site.</p>
      <p>Comedienne, turned counsellor, Sheila McMahon, appearing as her alter ego, Aunty Betty, danced on to the stage, enlisting the help of Tracey Spare and Yaz Benson from Footsteps Counselling and Support, for an impromptu performance, before receiving £1,300 for the Sutton-based charity.</p>

      <p>Patricia Gardiner received a cheque for £3,600 for The Motor Neurone Disease Association, and said its main aim is to ‘find a cure’ for the debilitating and life-limiting condition. Patricia did say there were ‘positive whispers’ from an Australian research team looking in to a cure.</p>
      <p>St Giles Hospice, based in Whittington, is always well supported and this year a video message from Roger Stocks outlined the help the charity gives. He spoke of his mum’s dying wish was to see her first great, great granddaughter.</p>
      <p>Baby Amber was born on September 21, and Roger’s mum saw her, before passing away at the hospice on October 11. Roger said: “Nothing was too much trouble for staff at St Giles. They regularly checked on me and that was important for them as checking on mum.” St Giles received £4,000.</p>

      <p>Ataxia sufferer, Patricia Castledine, described the condition as ‘similar to motor neurone disease’ – a neurological condition with no cure. This year fun runners raised £730 to help the Ataxia UK charity.</p>
      <p>Our Place Support – a community interest company which provides a host of services from financial help to unemployment advice, from mentoring to legal assistance – secured £4,439 from fun runners, including £2,750 from Phil Dunn’s Beating Brain Cancer team in memory of his daughter Marie Hunter. Phil backed Our Place this year – as his daughter used to volunteer there.</p>
      <p>The Cancer Support Centre in Sutton Coldfield received a bumper cheque for £8,600, thanks in no small part to serial fun runner Andy Perks who raised around £6,000 of that sum!</p>

      <p>While a big team from Webasto – a manufacturing firm which fits sunroofs to cars in Minworth, took to the fun run route to raise cash for the Mad Hatter’s Children’s Charity which provides fun experiences for children with special educational needs and disabilities. The charity received £3,250.</p>
      <p>Florian Hellmeier from the firm quipped: "I don’t know why it’s called a fun run after puffing around the route behind ‘a few people older than me and with more weight than me’. He added: “I learned a few lessons! Do we do it next year as well!</p>
      <p>“It’s something bigger to be part of the community. Even if manufacturing is not sexy, but it’s creating value and helping other people to have good lives.”</p>
      <p>Smaller charities – something the fun run can make all the difference to – were also showcased.</p>

      <p>The Tamworth Monday Blind Club received £1,200, while Black Country Women’s Aid received £1,545 to help domestic abuse victims – both men and women. It receives 14 calls an hour and supported more than 9,000 adults last year, at its six refuges. It has a new refuge helping modern day slavery victims. The charity this year was backed by Central Tai Chi.</p>
      <p>The ubiquitous Royal Mail van pulling team delivered another bumper sum - £4,200 for Birmingham Children’s Hospital, which scooped £20,169 from fun runners in total.</p>
      <p>While the night concluded with a poignant message from Velma Troko, whose husband, Dave Troko was a doctor at Good Hope Hospital. Velma and Dave came to England initially so Dave could train in orthopaedics for five years. But war broke out in their homeland and they stayed. Dave sadly died in 2011 but two charities were set up in his name.</p>

        <figcaption>The wife of Good Hope Hospital doctor, Dave Troko, Velma (centre) spoke of the work the charity set up in her husband's name does in Liberia, pictured with supporter Margaret Warner and Tracey Spare</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Dave Troko Eden Projects has helped pay for a school in Liberia, while the Liberty Project pays for reusable sanitary products for women in the country – as the average annual income is 1,000 dollars and women cannot afford disposable products.</p>
      <p>Velma’s charity was supported by Margaret Warner, who at 86 years young, returned to the fun run this year raising £1,000 and adding to her £10,000 fundraising total over the years.</p>
      <p>Sponsors and volunteers who help make the fun run tick were thanked and in a matter of weeks it will be all eyes on the 2020 event.</p>
      <p>After the event Tracey Spare said: "Tonight is what the event is all about. It's why it's put on every year. <br/>"When I hear some of the stories, particularly from some of the small, local organisations, a few hundred pounds to them will make all the difference."</p>
      <p>Next year’s Great Midlands Fun Run will be on May 31 and registration will open on February 8.</p>
