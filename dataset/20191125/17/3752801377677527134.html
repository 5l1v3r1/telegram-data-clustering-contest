      <p>Nine people have been arrested in Darling after around 1 500 people protested over housing and service delivery, police said on Monday.</p>
      <p>Police were initially called to monitor a public residents meeting after the protests erupted on Sunday night.</p>
      <p>"According to information, a group of about 1 500 people participated in the protest last night," said Western Cape police spokesperson Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana.</p>
      <p>"Nine people, aged between 19 and 33, were arrested after they burned tyres and threw stones at the police. They will appear in court once charged."</p>
      <p>Community leader Archie Mbele told <a href="https://www.netwerk24.com/Nuus/Algemeen/inwoners-van-darling-ruk-op-oor-behuising-20191125">Netwerk24</a> that the protests turned violent when police handled protesters harshly.</p>
      <p>Public Order Police and other law enforcement agencies were monitoring the area.</p>
      <p>There were no reports of violence on Monday, but "police will remain in the area until law and order is restored", Rwexana said.</p>
