      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T17:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 17:00</time> by <a rel="author">Brian Dick, https://www.facebook.com/blueswriterbriandick/?fref=ts</a></address>
      <p>Huddersfield Town hopeful Reece Brown insists he has learned lessons from his time at <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/birmingham-city-fc">Birmingham City</a> .</p>
      <p>The talented midfielder came through the system at Blues, making his debut at just 17-years-old but then struggling to stay in the team.</p>
      <p>Lee Clark handed him eight appearances in the 2013/2014 season but Gary Rowett’s arrival saw the play-maker’s opportunities severely limited.</p>
      <p>Indeed Brown ended up being briefly suspended under Rowett before being allowed to leave on a free transfer in the summer of 2017.</p>
      <p>Two solid years at Forest Green tempted Huddersfield to hand him a second chance in the second tier - although he has only played once this season.</p>

      <p>He was <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/huddersfield-town-birmingham-city-report-17303390">not involved in Saturday’s 1-1 draw</a> between his current and former clubs - but told the match-day programme how he has learned how to deal with that situation.</p>
      <p>“After my debut I tried to kick on but the Championship is a difficult league. There was a little stage where I was playing a few games, then later on in the season I didn’t really feature that much,” Brown told The Terrier.</p>
      <p>“Of course, I can’t speak for everyone but for me it was mentally hard. You get in there, play, I didn’t play badly I don’t think and then to come out of the first team, it’s not nice.</p>
      <p>"It’s about having a good mindset really, to fight and get back into is as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>“If you do make your debut, then come out of the team, you just have to stay focused and keep grafting and soon it’ll come again.</p>
      <p>“Since, I’ve been here, I haven’t really featured so far this year, but I’ve kind of been through it before. When I was at Birmingham, I might not have dealt with it in the best way.</p>
      <p>“I’ve learned that’s not the way to get what you want, you have to stay focused, work even harder and when the opportunity comes, try and take it. “</p>
      <p>Brown joined Blues from Sedgley White Lions as a ten-year-old and spent more than a decade at the club.</p>
      <p>“Being there was everything to me,” he continued. “When you’ve been there for ten or 11 years, you’re going to feel every emotion at the club. There were fun times, lots of fun times.</p>
      <p>“When I was 14 or 15 years old, I started getting the opportunity to play on the pitch at St Andrew’s...at that point you’re around older boys in the changing room so it all starts to become real.</p>
      <p>“It was just another game to me. Obviously, you think abot the bigger boys but football is just football to me. From a kid I’ve played with people older than me. so it wasn’t all that new.”</p>
