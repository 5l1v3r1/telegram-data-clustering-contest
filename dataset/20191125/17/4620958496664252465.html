      <p>Earlier today, TransLink offered a <a href="https://www.vancouverisawesome.com/2019/11/25/translink-strike-prepare-vancouver/">number of suggestions for its customers who typically ride the bus or SeaBus to work</a>, as well as a credit as a credit for monthly passholders who do not use their Compass accounts during the three-day transit strike.</p>
      <p>The transit authority notes that customers will automatically have pro-rated Stored Value credit applied to their Compass accounts. However, they might not see them right away.</p>
      <p>“Customers won’t see the credit until they tap in again,” notes Ben Murphy, Senior Media Relations Advisor, TransLink. “Once they do, they’ll be able to see it.”</p>
      <p>Murphy stated that customers will be credited back the value of a day’s fare relative to the type of pass they purchased. For example, a one zone pass, which costs $98, would be divided by 30 days to get the per diem credit value. This value is roughly $3.27, which the customer would be automatically credited if they don’t use their card.</p>
      <p>“The credits work on a daily basis, so as soon as someone taps in, they’ll be able to see the previous day’s credit.”</p>
      <p>The ‘complete transit shutdown’ is slated to last for three days commencing Wednesday. With this in mind, Coast Mountain Bus Company and Unifor will return to the bargaining table tomorrow.</p>
      <p>Gavin McGarrigle, Unifor’s lead negotiator, <a href="https://www.vancouverisawesome.com/2019/11/25/last-minute-talks-unifor-coast-mountain-bus-strike-vancouver-wednesday/">says the union is prepared to negotiate until midnight Wednesday</a> and if no agreement is reached, a three-day strike will begin, affecting about 350,000 transit users.</p>
