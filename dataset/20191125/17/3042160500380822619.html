      <h1>Racist Snapchat Message Mocking Black Student Group Leads to Suspension of Wisconsin University Football Players</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T17:44:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 17:44</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://atlantablackstar.com/author/tanasia/" target="_blank">Tanasia Kenney</a></address>
      <p>Five <b>University of Wisconsin-Eau</b> <b>Claire</b> football players behind a racist Snapchat post mocking a Black student organization have been suspended and now face an investigation by the university.</p>
      <p>Screenshots of their chat thread were circulated among students last week, sparking outrage across campus. The conversation started with one player mentioning a meeting put on by the <b>Black Male Empowerment </b>club<b>,</b> and included a black-and-white photo of a <b>Ku Klux Klan</b> cross burning.</p>

      <p>“For all who cannot make the BME meeting, (name of student) and I are holding WME tonight at 7,” the message reads, seemingly playing off the acronym, replacing black with white.</p>
      <p>In another message, one of the players joke about the other being “the grand wizard.”</p>
      <p>“I’ll be there in like five minutes,” another wrote. “Think the cross will still be burning? Don’t wanna miss that again.”</p>
      <p>The thread continues with the players poking fun over their fictional cross burning, with one questioning why they were wasting their time burning wood.</p>
      <p>“Honestly just find someone who doesn’t have the same views as you or looks a little different and burn them,” they wrote.</p>
      <p>UW-Eau Claire Chancellor <b>Jim Schmidt</b> addressed the incident Wednesday, saying he was “thoroughly disgusted” and angered by the messages.</p>
      <p>“These symbols and pictures [and] comments harken back to some of the darkest days in our country’s history,” Schmidt told the <a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/education/2019/11/20/5-uw-eau-claire-students-under-investigation-racist-messaging/4252384002/">Milwaukee Journal Sentinel </a>in an interview.</p>
      <p>He also released a statement on social media, saying the university would not tolerate such racism.</p>

      <p>“I have asked the Dean of Students Office to investigate and take appropriate action,” he added.</p>
      <p><b>Dennis Beale</b>, a founder of Black Male Empowerment, said he was equally “appalled” by the post and called for justice to be served in the incident. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/blackmaleempowerment/">On Facebook</a>, he explained, “[BME] was designed to help change the perception of African-American males on a predominately white campus — along with exemplifying the black excellence that these young men display on a daily basis.”</p>
      <p>“It’s very disturbing to see the backlash we get from the people in our own backyard,” he added.</p>
      <p>Schmidt said he anticipates the investigation into the incident will wrap up quickly, adding that the players responsible could face a range of punishments — though he didn’t give specifics.</p>
      <p>Stats from the<a href="https://www.wisconsin.edu/accountability/access/"> UW System</a> show racial minorities accounted for just 10 percent of the campus’ student body in 2018, with African-Americans comprising just 2.4 percent of that. As the university recruits more non-white students to its campus, Schmidt said inclusivity training is a must for all students at orientation.</p>
      <p>“We are not naive enough to think that we’re going to wipe out racism on our campus, because we are a reflection of society,” he told the newspaper. “I would hope through the efforts of so many on our campus, that we could be a better reflection of society.”</p>
      <p>The University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire didn’t return requests for comment.</p>
