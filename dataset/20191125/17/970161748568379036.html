      <p>Les Dunes Electroniques is a dance music festival held in an area of the Tunisian desert which you might know better as Tatooine – the home planet of both Luke and Anakin Skywalker. A key filming location for both the original <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/star-wars/">Star Wars</a> trilogy and the much-maligned prequels, it has seen such iconic moments as Luke returning to find his aunt and uncle murdered by Storm Troopers, Luke learning to use a Lightsaber for the first time, and, uh, Liam Neeson explaining that the Force is actually made up of ‘midi-chlorians’, or whatever was going on there.</p>
      <p>Incidentally, the latter scene is commemorated on-site by a plaque which featured the phrase: ‘The characters are portrayed by the comedians Liam Neeson and Natalie Portman’ – I’m glad my favourite comedians are finally getting the recognition they deserve!</p>

      <p>As well as hosting these timeless cinematic moments, the desert is now also the setting for a techno-heavy rave which sees thousands of revellers partying for 36 hours straight.</p>

      <p>Just four years ago, a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/dec/03/star-wars-abandoned-tunisian-locations-in-pictures">Guardian article</a> described these Star Wars sets as ‘neglected, slowly being consumed by the desert,’ and questioned their viability as a place people would continue to visit. Now in its third year, the festival marks an attempt to reverse this process, and judging by how many people were there, it just might be working.</p>

      <p>Throughout the festival, the one thing that never lost its novelty was the fact that we were <i>in the Sahara desert.</i> It really is impossible to over-state how breathtakingly beautiful it is: the closest thing I can compare it to would be standing on a boat in the middle of the ocean and seeing nothing but water in every direction… but with sand.</p>
      <p>At times the view was so expansive that it was almost slightly frightening. It inspired a kind of agoraphobia, staring out into nothing and knowing it continued for longer than your mind could possibly comprehend; into Egypt, Sudan, Chad, all these places you’ve only seen on maps, in films, or your childhood imagination. It was also like being in a Star Wars film, which was pretty cool.</p>

      <p>Although the festival wasn’t pitched as Star Wars-<i>themed</i> exactly, the films definitely exerted a noticeable influence: while, to my bitter disappointment, I did not see anyone raving in a Chewbecca costume, there were plenty of people swaggering around in Jedi robes and Darth Vader masks.</p>

      <p>It seemed as though the international attendees cared more about the Star Wars side of things while the Tunisians were mostly there for the music.</p>

      <p>Dancing to some really good techno at 6am as the sun began to blaze over this landscape is something I won’t forget as long as I live.</p>
      <p>One thing I <i>do</i> remember is losing my balance at the top of a sand dune and tumbling downhill so farcically I might as well have been in a Chuckle Brothers skit, before landing directly into a tent where a formal dinner was being held. Had he been there, Qui-Gon Jin would have given me a right bollocking.</p>

      <p>The line-up at Les Dunes featured some impressively big names, given the remote location – not least Ibiza legends Luciano and Apollonia.</p>
      <p>Luciano’s style of expansive, big-room techno was a perfect match for the wide-open spaces of the desert; while German DJ Stimming’s set was characteristically inventive, sampling interesting and unusual instruments.</p>
      <p>As well as these internationally-renowned artists, there were also a good variety of Tunisian DJ’s playing, such as Ghassen Ghazouani and Hazem Berrabah – whose set mixed contemporary house with Arabic singing and traditional instruments to great effect.</p>
      <p>As night turned into day, I have to admit I lost track of exactly who I was watching, but the calibre of the music throughout the 36 hours was impressive – there wasn’t a cheesy EDM banger in sight. Thankfully, at no point did anyone drop an electro-swing version of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHD-knhS6es">Cantina band song</a>.</p>

      <p>There were a bunch of camels hanging around the festival which was great, but ruined my vibe at one point: on the first night of the festival, a shaman guided us through a meditation on a hill overlooking the site, banging a drum to hypnotic effect and telling us to imagine that we ourselves were sand dunes. I was really getting into this and felt like I was on the verge of achieving some kind of transcendence until a nearby camel made a funny noise and I burst out laughing. Despite this act of spiritual sabotage, I maintain that camels are great lads and I won’t hear a word said against them.</p>

      <p>One of my favourite things about the experience was the range of activities on offer outside of the festival, which was handy when the relentless Star Wars puns got too much (although that might have just been the people I was with). The nearby city of Tozeur was great: perhaps my mind has been poisoned by too many Hollywood films but its dense alleyways felt like the kind of place you could imagine Jason Bourne or James Bond having an absolutely banging chase, maybe scattering some unfortunate merchant’s wares in the process.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>All in all, Les Dunes Electroniques was a unique festival experience: the dance music was surprisingly interesting and forward-thinking, the setting was stunning, and, best of all, I got to roam around the desert wearing a floor-length robe and pretend I was on my way to knock the stuffing out of a Sith Lord.</p>
