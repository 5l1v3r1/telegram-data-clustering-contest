      <h3>COMIC LEGEND:</h3>
      <p>Sabrina the Teenage Witch came to television due to Filmation's inability to get the rights to make a Bewitched cartoon.</p>
      <h3>STATUS:</h3>
      <p>Basically True</p>
      <p>A while back, <a href="https://www.cbr.com/sabrina-archie-show/">I wrote about how Sabrina the Teenage Witch</a> was a relatively minor character in Archie Comics that had basically fallen into limbo (she had no regular feature) when she was suddenly thrust into stardom with a feature on an expanded Archie cartoon series (the show went to an hour as The Archie Comedy Hour and so had to come up with more features to make it last that long).</p>

      <p>That launched in September 1969, so Sabrina got her own series where she would interact with the rest of the Archie Universe called Archie's TV Laugh-Out....</p>

      <p>She proved so popular that Filmation spun her into her own series the following year. Archie soon followed suit and gave her her own comic book series...</p>

      </figure>
      <p>And what's hilarious is that she was called to the attention of Filmation's Lou Scheimer only after they had tried and failed to get the rights to make a Bewitched animated series!</p>
      <p>Bewitched, of course, was a popular sitcom in the 1960s starring Elizabeth Montgomery as a witch married to a regular guy...</p>

      <p>Scheimer explained it to Andy Mangels in the great <a href="https://twomorrows.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;products_id=662">Lou Scheimer: Creating the Filmation Generation</a> from TwoMorrows about how Scheimer had been trying to get the rights to Bewitched and even tried negotiating with the show's executive producer, William Asher (husband to the star of the show, Montgomery) before learning that they did not have the rights. At the same time, though, Scheimer was trying to think of characters that he could use to expand the Archie television series.</p>
      <p>The two pursuits were tied together when Fred Silverman, then the head of daytime programming at CBS, called up Scheimer and let him know that Silverman had been flipping through some Archie Comics while on vacation (presumably looking for ideas for cartoons, but maybe just killing time) and saw that they had their own teenage witch character and that is how Sabrina found her way on to television and through her television success, became a comic book success, as well.</p>
      <p>By the way, eventually Hanna-Barbera got the rights to Bewitched, but their choice of what to do with it was...bizarre, to say the least...</p>
