      <p>Between Black Friday 2019 and Cyber Monday, Apple is offering up to US$200 gift cards with certain product purchases.</p>
      <h3>Black Friday Gift Cards</h3>
      <p>In an email sent to customers, as well as a <a href="https://www.apple.com/us/shop/gifts/shopping-event">web page</a>, Apple announced the return of its four-day shopping event. Gift card values will be different depending on what product you buy, and Apple hasn’t shared those details yet.</p>
      <p>Most Macs come with a US$200 gift card, while iPhones and iPad could include a US$100 card, respectively. Other products like the Apple TV could get you a US$50 card.</p>
