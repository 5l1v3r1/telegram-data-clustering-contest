      <blockquote>Wiki’s last album, 2017’s <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/brooklynvegans-top-50-albums-of-2017/">great</a> <i>No Mountains In Manhattan</i>, was a carefully constructed concept album that channeled the sounds and feelings of Wiki’s home city, serving both as a proper introduction to Wiki as an artist and as a portrait of the madness of New York City. It’s an <i>Illmatic</i> or a <i>good kid, m.A.A.d city</i> kind of album, and like those two albums did for their respective authors, <i>NMIM</i> put Wiki on the map as a force to be reckoned with. Now, two years later, he’s back with a followup album that he only announced last week and only revealed the guests and tracklist for yesterday. It’s out on his own Wikset Enterprise label (<i>NMIM</i> came out on XL), and though it’s peppered with some of the same bodega scenes as <i>NMIM</i>, it’s got less of an overall concept and it’s more just a collection of badass rap songs; more of a <i>DAMN.</i> than a <i>good kid, m.A.A.d city</i>. Once again, he made the album with a handful of fellow New York artists, including frequent collaborator Your Old Droog, Princess Nokia, Lansky Jones of World’s Fair, and R&amp;B singer Duendita, and as you’d probably expect, they all fit perfectly into Wiki’s world. The best guest appearances, though, are the ones from the two non-New Yorkers, Lil Ugly Mane and Denzel Curry, who both appear on album highlight “Grim.” Lil Ugly Mane already formed chemistry with Wiki in their former supergroup, who <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/secret-circle-break-up-actions-have-consequences-says-wiki/">broke up</a> after group member Antwon was accused of sexual assault, and I don’t think Wiki and Denzel Curry ever did a song together before this one (though Denzel and Lil Ugly Mane <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJPf8rMaab4">have</a>), but I hope this isn’t the last. They’re kindred spirits — both are highly skilled, in-your-face rappers who know how to flirt with the mainstream while remaining distinctly underground — and on “Grim,” they and Lil Ugly Mane all bring out the best of each other.</blockquote>
