      <p>Huawei has launched <a href="https://consumer.huawei.com/cn/tablets/matepad-pro/">the MediaPad Pro</a>, the world’s first tablet with a punch-hole display, in China. The MediaPad Pro is a high-end Android tablet designed from the ground up to take on the likes of the <a href="https://www.republicworld.com/technology-news/gadgets/with-new-ipad-os-desktop-class-web-browsing-download-manager-and-usb-support-come-to-ipad.html">iPad Pro</a> and <a href="https://www.republicworld.com/technology-news/gadgets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s6-launched-in-india-specs-price-and-all-details.html">Samsung Galaxy Tab S6</a> with a premium design and flagship specs. Sadly, Huawei’s <a href="https://www.republicworld.com/technology-news/gadgets/huawei-in-hot-soup-as-arm-cuts-ties-effectively-killing-the-hisilicon-chip-report.html">current “situation” with the US government</a> makes the MediaPad Pro’s foray into global markets challenging – since Huawei can’t outfit the thing with the Google Play Store and Google services.  </p>
      <h3>Huawei MatePad Pro specs and features</h3>
      <p>Be that as it may, <a href="https://www.republicworld.com/technology-news/mobile/huawei-mate-30-pro-mate-30-launched-with-halo-ring-40mp-quad-cameras.html">much like the Mate 30 Pro launched recently</a>, the MatePad Pro also has a lot going for itself. The tablet, as mentioned earlier, has a punch-hole display cutout which when coupled with its 4.9mm slim bezels entails in a screen-to-body ratio of nearly 90 per cent. The tablet also comes in a slew of fancy colours including White, Black, Green and Orange. Much like any other high-end tablet, the MediaPad Pro also supports a smart keyboard and M-Pen stylus accessories.  </p>

      <p>Speaking of core specs, the MediaPad Pro has a 10.8-inch IPS LCD display with a QHD+ resolution and 16:10 aspect ratio. The tablet is powered by Huawei’s top-tier Kirin 990 processor paired with up to 8GB RAM and up to 256GB storage. Software inside is Android 10-based EMUI 10. As is usually the case with such tablets, Huawei also offers a laptop-like mode and multi window support among other software quirks for productivity.  </p>
      <p>The tablet is further backed by a sizeable 7,250mAh and supports 40W fast wired, 15W wireless and 7.5W reverse wireless charging. This one also gets quad speakers. For optics, the MediaPad Pro has a 13MP rear camera and an 8MP front camera. </p>
