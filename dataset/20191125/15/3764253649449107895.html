      <p>His words: <i>“The involvement of the academia in our electoral process is premised on the assumption that academics are people of proven integrity, who cannot be compromised.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“However, our scholars should know that they bear the responsibility of justifying the trust placed on them by other members of the society in the management of elections.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“Any member of the academia who compromises what he stands for, by getting involved in the manipulation of elections, betrays that trust.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“Like parents, lecturers and teachers should always bear in mind that the important part they play in nurturing and guiding of younger ones project them as consequential role models.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“It is dangerous for members of the academia to get involved in election malpractices because of its wider implication for the future of our country.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“Our universities should produce rational beings that will be able to distinguish between good and bad.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the role played by Jonathan to back the All Progressives Congress and help influence their victory at the just concluded governorship election in Bayelsa <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1278285-bayelsa-election-pdp-splits-jonathans-role-poll.html">has divided the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the state.</a></p>
      <p>While some PDP chieftains in Bayelsa say Jonathan should not be blamed for the defeat of their party, others believe that the former president should be held responsible for the ruling party's defeat.</p>
      <p>Other party leaders, however, said that the alleged selfishness and autocratic leadership style of the state governor, Seriake Dickson, compelled Jonathan to take a back seat in the affairs of the PDP before and during the election.</p>
