      <p>The singer revealed few hours ago that he’s going come to Ghana this December perhaps as part of the Year of Return initiative.</p>
      <p>But his motive for coming is clearly not proportional to what other African Americans are coming to Ghana to do as part of the Year of Return program.</p>
