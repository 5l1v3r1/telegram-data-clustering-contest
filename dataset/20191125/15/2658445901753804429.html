      <p>An Ikorodu Magistrates’ Court on Monday remanded a 25-year-old prophet, Adebowale Obaloluwa, in Correctional custody over alleged defilement of a 14-year-old girl (names withheld).</p>
      <p>The defendant, who is an interpreter of tongues at a branch of Cherubim and Seraphim Church, is facing a lone charge of child defilement before Magistrate, Mrs C. K Tunji-Carrena.</p>
      <p>When the charge was read, the court did not take his plea.</p>
      <p>Magistrate Tunji-Carrena ordered his remand correctional custody pending legal advice from the Director of Public Prosecution (DPP).</p>
      <p>Prosecuting Sgt. Mary Ajiteru, told the court that the defendant committed the offence on November 15, at 1.30a.m. at No. 1, Oduolu Street, Baiyeku, Igbogbo, Ikorodu.</p>

      <p>Sgt. Ajiteru told the court that Obaboluwa lured the girl, who went with her friend to the church, to his sleeping quarters during a prayer vigil and allegedly defiled her.</p>
      <p>she said that when the girl got home from the vigil, she told her mother what the prophet did to her.<br/>She said incident was reported at the Police station and the prophet was arrested.</p>
      <p>Magistrate Tunji-Carrena has adjourned the case until January 30, 2020 .</p>
