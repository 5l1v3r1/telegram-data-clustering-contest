      <h1>Fragtime Buries Interesting Ideas Under a Weird Premise</h1>

      <p><a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/fragtime"><i>Fragtime</i></a>, an hour-long OVA based on Sato's two-volume yuri manga, is an <a href="https://screenrant.com/most-underrated-anime/amp/">anime</a> that requires the viewer to accept certain things at the start. First off, there's the unexplained sci-fi phenomenon in this otherwise realistic setting in which the main character Misuzu Moritani is somehow able to freeze time for three minutes. Once your suspension of disbelief has been held, next comes the suspension of moral outrage: in the first scene of the movie, Misuzu uses her powers to sneak a peek up her classmate Haruka Murakami's skirt.</p>
      <p>Mysteriously, Haruka is immune to Misuzu's time-freezing powers, so she is fully aware she's being creeped on. Misuzu is extremely apologetic, and as penance agrees to do whatever Haruka wants... which includes a relationship. Clearly, this isn't the wholesome and unproblematic romance of <i>Kase-san and Morning Glories</i>, director Takuya Sato's previous more successful yuri anime. Romance blossoming out of an act of sexual harassment will certainly turn off some viewers right from the start.</p>

      <p>Stick with the story, though, and it does some interesting things with this off-putting premise. Most significantly, it's concerned with the consequences of bad actions. Misuzu's whole storyline is all about the process of apologizing, which is probably the only story path that could keep her a likable character after her big misdeed early on.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, if Haruka's willingness to push Misuzu towards a romance after their uncomfortable first interaction seems a little bit unbelievable, there's a psychological explanation for Haruka's behavior that ends up resulting in the most emotionally affecting part of the movie. Without spoilers, let's just say it's fascinating the ways Haruka and Misuzu's problems play off each other, and those who had social difficulties growing up might find some of their foibles uncomfortably relatable.</p>

      <p>In the absolute worst-case scenario for the future, Haruka and Misuzu will exacerbate one another's issues, creating a toxic relationship dynamic. In the best-case scenario, their mutual awareness, dedication to self-improvement and true love will help each other get better. Which future seems more likely for the high school couple is up to the viewer to decide. This short movie doesn't delve so far into their relationship progression.</p>

      <p><i>Fragtime</i> is not an impressive production from an animation standpoint. While the time-freezing premise comes from the manga, it does seem like this manga was chosen to adapt in part because it offers an easy excuse to avoid animating anything except the two main characters for multiple stretches of time. It, unfortunately, does not use this sci-fi concept as creatively and artfully as <i>The Girl Who Leapt Through Time</i> did. Too often there's hardly any animation even in scenes where time isn't frozen. The character designs by Tomoko Sudo are easy on the eyes and some of the manga-inspired compositions are appealing, but this was overall not a stand-out visual showcase for the recently formed Tear Studio.</p>
      <p>Fans of the yuri genre who want something slightly raunchier than usual and aren't instantly put off by the opening scene will find things to enjoy in <i>Fragtime. </i>They might even be moved by its emotionally compelling climax. The combination of its odd set-up and weak production values, however, makes it a hard sell for the general viewing public.</p>
      <p>
        <i>Fragtime was released on November 22 in Japan. Sentai Filmworks will release it in America sometime after.</i>
