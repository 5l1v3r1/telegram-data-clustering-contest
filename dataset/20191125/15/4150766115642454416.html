      <h1>Victory on hold as Uruguay vote too close</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T15:38:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 15:38</time> by <a rel="author">AFP</a></address>
      <p>Uruguay's presidential election is too close to call and the result will not be known for several days pending a recount, the South American country’s electoral court said late on Sunday.</p>
      <p>“The court is not going to give a winner tonight,” Electoral Court president Jose Arocena told reporters after a night of drama in Montevideo.</p>
      <p>The announcement came after unofficial results showed centre-right candidate Luis Lacalle Pou only around 30,000 votes ahead of the ruling party’s Daniel Martinez – turning opinion poll predictions of a comfortable victory on their head.</p>
      <p>The court said the number of provisional or contested ballots – around 35,000 – exceeded the margin between the two candidates.</p>
      <p>The recount of ballots, which could take two or three days, will begin on Tuesday, meaning the result may not be known before Friday.</p>
      <p>Lacalle Pou said he was confident his victory would be confirmed.</p>
      <p>Opinion polls since last month’s first-round had indicated that the 46-year-old former senator would comfortably win the run-off.</p>
      <p>But with almost all the votes counted, his lead over Martinez, a 62-year-old former Montevideo mayor, was just more than one per cent.</p>
      <p>If confirmed, the result would mean defeat for the long-dominant leftist ruling Broad Front coalition after 15 years in power.</p>
      <p>“They tried to bury us, but what they didn’t know is that we are seeds,” Martinez told his supporters.</p>
      <p>Thousands of flag-waving Lacalle Pou supporters massed around the headquarters of his conservative National Party had earlier been ordered to hold back on celebrations as it became clear the result was on a knife-edge.</p>
      <p>“Everybody knows it and they don’t accept it,” Lacalle Pou said when he addressed them after midnight, saying Martinez “has not called me and has not conceded a result that we believe irreversible”.</p>
      <p>“<i>Presidente! Presidente!</i>” chanted the crowd regardless.</p>
      <p>Officials at the headquarters of the Broad Front, which has won Uruguay’s last three general and presidential elections, were similarly reserved about conceding defeat, sparking celebrations among their supporters.</p>
      <p>National Party leader Lacalle Pou, a senator, trailed Martinez in last month’s first round, but a pact with centre-right and right-wing parties following simultaneous legislative elections gave him a majority in Congress as well as a significant lead heading into the run-off.</p>
      <p>A win for the right would “reflect a trend in the region of voters rejecting the incumbent party over disappointing results”, said Robert Wood, Latin America specialist with the Economist Intelligence Unit.</p>
