      <p>MILAN (Reuters) - The leader of Italy’s 5-Star Movement Luigi Di Maio said again on Monday that the motorway concession of infrastructure group Atlantia should be revoked.</p>
      <p>In a post on his Facebook account, Di Maio also said that the country needed to carry out a nationwide monitoring of its motorway infrastructures.</p>
      <p>On Sunday a motorway bridge operated by SIAS collapsed in Italy’s northwestern region of Liguria, but caused no casualties.</p>
      <p>The incident happened more than a year after another viaduct, operated by Atlantia’s Autostrade unit, collapsed, killing 43 people.</p>
