      <h1>Sam Allardyce claims he could have managed Man Utd during managerial heyday</h1>
      <h2>The former Premier League and England boss believes British managers need to get more credit, with the elite clubs tending to look abroad</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T15:46:55+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 15:46</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Milne</a></address>
      <p>Sam Allardyce, who has managed the likes of Newcastle, Blackburn and West Ham, claimed he could have been <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> boss if he had a foreign-sounding surname.</p>
      <p>The 65-year-old has not been involved in coaching since he left <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/everton-fc">Everton</a> last year and has turned to punditry while he awaits another offer.</p>
      <p>A number of Premier League managers are under pressure at the moment and Allardyce believes their clubs should look to the likes of Burnley's Sean Dyche rather than a foreign boss, and dismissed the idea you need to win trophies to prove yourself.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://talksport.com/football/634477/sam-allardyce-trophies-allardicio-man-utd-celtic/">talkSPORT</a> Allardyce said: "Sean Dyche has taken <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/burnley-fc">Burnley</a> from obscurity to Europe.</p>

      <p>"Europe, over a consistent level of games is much harder to achieve than winning a piece of silverware, where you play six or seven games and get to a cup final.</p>
      <p>"I don’t understand the logic, it just isn’t logic whatsoever; you cannot work at a smaller club and expect to get a bigger job by winning trophies… it’s an absolute nonsense."</p>
      <p>It remains to be seen whether Allardyce does eventually get a move to a new club, but he has claimed he had the ability to take charge of arguably the biggest club in the world in the past.</p>
      <p>"The best way to get a Premier League job if you are British is to change your name to a foreign name," he added.</p>

      <p>"I have always said if I was 'Allardicio' I could have managed Manchester United."</p>
      <p>Allardyce never won a major honour during his time as a manager, although he did help save numerous teams from relegation and also won the Championship playoffs with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> .</p>
      <p>He also took charge of England in 2016, but oversaw just one game before leaving the role by mutual consent following allegations of malpractice.</p>
