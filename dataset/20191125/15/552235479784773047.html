      <h1>Hearts Scottish Cup draw is a fantastic opportunity for Airdrie players says boss Ian Murray</h1>
      <h2>After Monklands Derby victory the New Broomfield faithful have a trip to the capital to look forward to next year.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T15:48:28+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 15:48</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Pirie, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/mark-pirie/</a></address>
      <p>Delighted <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/local-sport/boss-ian-murray-sends-airdrieonians-20912874">Airdrie boss Ian Murray</a> reckons his players will be relishing a <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/local-sport/lovering-family-feud-airdrie-hero-20913590">Scottish Cup</a> glamour tie against Hearts.</p>
      <p>The Diamonds will travel to Tynecastle on either January 18 or 19 after dispatching Albion Rovers on derby day.</p>
      <p>The gaffer told the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/local-sport/boss-ian-murray-sends-airdrieonians-20912874">Airdrie and Coatbridge Advertiser:</a> “It’s a big game in front of a big crowd.</p>
      <p>“After the Old Firm it’s probably the biggest game we could have got. It’s a really decent draw but the players will have to get back to their football after the Albion Rovers result. It’s a fantastic opportunity for the players.”</p>

      <p>As a former Hibs captain Murray can expect a hostile reception when he visits their Edinburgh rivals but he says that will only add to a great atmosphere.</p>
      <p>He added: “There are tonnes of connections between Airdrie and Hearts. You look at Alex MacDonald who had good spells managing both clubs, and we have three ex-Hearts players in the team.</p>
      <p>"Colin [Cameron, assistant] will also be going back to where he won the Scottish Cup. It should be a great day.”</p>
