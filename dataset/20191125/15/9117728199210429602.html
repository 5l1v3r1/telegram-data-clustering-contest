      <h1>Steiner admits he should've listened to the drivers more after Barcelona upgrade</h1>

        <b>It has been a frustrating season for the <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/haas-f1">Haas F1 team</a> with the constructor sitting second bottom of the Constructors' Championship. If there was one thing Guenther Steiner would do differently this season, it would be to listen to his drivers more after the Spain upgrade.</b>

      <p>Having been one of the standout teams in 2018, Haas were expected to challenge for the best of the rest this season, and were many people's favourites to do so. However, they have languished near the bottom of the standings, with their race pace failing to match that of their qualifying.</p>
      <p>Steiner admits that after the <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/grandsprix/spanish-grand-prix">Spanish Grand Prix</a>, where both drivers scored points, he should've listened to them more. </p>

      <p>“One thing I would do is to just do something different after we introduced the upgrade in Barcelona. I would listen a little bit more to the drivers and be a little bit more self-critical," Steiner said in <a href="https://www.haasf1team.com/news/abu-dhabi-grand-prix-preview">Haas' Abu Dhabi preview</a>.</p>
      <p>Despite a tough season, the Haas boss is looking to the future and starting a new fresh in 2020.</p>

      <p><i>“It was obviously a tough year for us in our fourth season. You learn and, overall, we’re pretty strong anyway," </i>he added.</p>
      <p>
        <i>"We had to learn some lessons to get better. Next year will be a new book and, hopefully, we go back to the kind of performances we had in 2018.”</i>
