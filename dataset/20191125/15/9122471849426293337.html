      <h1>ESPN Analyst Thanks Tom Herman For Not Taking The LSU Job</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T15:18:32+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 15:18</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>LSU pursued then-Houston head coach Tom Herman back in 2016 after firing Les Miles. The Tigers expressed interest in Herman, <a href="https://www.si.com/college/2019/09/02/tom-herman-texas-lsu-ed-orgeron">though he said no to a potential meeting</a>, as he was leaning toward the Texas job, which he ended up getting.</p>
      <p>Three years later, LSU is being led toward the College Football Playoff by Ed Orgeron. Texas is 6-5, barely making a bowl game.</p>
      <p>ESPN analyst Ryan Clark, an LSU alum, had a message for Herman following Saturday’s game. The message is a simple one: Thank you.</p>
      <p>“As a LSU alum I would like to thank you Tom Herman. A few years back you made the decision I never knew I wanted you to make. You chose Texas &amp; for that I am grateful,” he tweeted.</p>

      <p>Welp, he’s not wrong.</p>
      <p>Many questioned LSU’s decision to go with Coach O back in 2016, though he’s proven to be a massive success. Herman, meanwhile, was arguably the hottest name in coaching at Houston. He’s been at Texas for three seasons and has yet to elevate the Longhorns to an elite level.</p>
      <p>LSU beat Texas earlier this season, 45-38. The Tigers will host the Longhorns in a rematch in Baton Rouge next September.</p>
