      <p>Nigeria’s Supersand Eagles have crashed out of the FIFA Beach World Cup following their 5-6 loss to Oman in Group D of the competition.</p>
      <p>Oman jumped into a two-goal lead thanks to Eid Al Farsi’s left-footed, curling rocket into the far corner from distance and Jalal Al Sinani’s impressive scissor kick.</p>
      <p>Emeka Ogbonna responded to the early letdown by scoring two goals and bringing the Super Sand Eagles level early in the second period.</p>
      <p>However Oman just had too much for Nigeria as goals from Mushel Al Araimi, Al Farsi and Sami Al Bulushi had them 5-2 up at the end of the second period.</p>
      <p>Ogbonna added another to complete his hat-trick before Adams Taiwo scored with a low drive into the bottom corner to bring the Super Sand Eagles back to within one.</p>
      <p>Oman captain Khalid Al Oraimi scored once again to build a two-goal cushion before Godspower Igudia finished off a well-worked team move to score for Nigeria.</p>
      <p>However it wasn’t enough and Oman were the ones letting out a sigh of relief and putting three crucial points on the board in Group D.</p>
      <p>Nigeria would hope for a win in their final group game against Brazil on Tuesday, having lost two group games in the series.</p>
