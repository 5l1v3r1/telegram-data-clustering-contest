      <h1>Week 13 Fantasy RB Rankings: Derrick Henry bullies his way into top five</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T15:10:04+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 15:10</time> by <a rel="author">Billy Heyen</a></address>
      <p>The best fantasy football owners can do sometimes is react. Heading into Week 13, we're able to assess guys like Rashaad Penny, Bo Scarbrough and Benny Snell Jr. with some accuracy. Sure, it would've been nice to know last week that Penny and Snell should be in all our lineups, but it's never that simple. There was a case to be made for Scarbrough-- he already placed near RB2 territory a week ago. But you've surely opened the Week 13 fantasy RB rankings to see if what happened last week can happen again.</p>
      <p>With Snell, the answer is contingent on the health of James Conner (shoulder). There's no reason Snell can't put up solid numbers on heavy volume against the Browns in Week 13if he gets to be the lead back. If Conner returns, Snell will be relegated to the sideline and not have a chance at big numbers -- so, essentially, we can't really know much about Snell until late in the week. Penny seems more likely to continue his production, although he's still got to compete with Chris Carson. Penny's usage Sunday wasn't injury-related, though, and Chris Carson has pushed himself toward the doghouse because of fumbles multiple times. Penny's a former first-rounder and probably someone you can trust as a FLEX.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Scarbrough might be the easiest to trust in terms of continuing his workload going forward, but his Week 13 Thanksgiving matchup against the Bears is the trickiest to want to play him in. Two weeks of dominating the Lions' carries suggest that the former Alabama back has made the starter's job his, so he should definitely be rostered, but starting him this week might be just as risky as the others.</p>
      <p>Other than those waiver wire targets, it's another week of anticipating good and bad matchups. David Montgomery (@ Lions) and Jordan Howard (@ Dolphins) have two of the best. Carlos Hyde (vs. Patriots) and Mark Ingram (vs. 49ers) have two of the worst. In the middle, you have a guy like Jonathan Williams, who saw nearly 30 touches on Week 12 Thursday Night Football but had really never been heard from much in his career. We'd take the relatively unproven Williams with seemingly lots of volume over two veterans in tough situations like Hyde and Ingram.</p>
      <p>And at last, with no bye weeks, you may actually be able to sit guys like Hyde and Ingram in matchups that you had no choice but to play them in before. Don't forget, too, to check your lineup before 12:30 p.m. ET on Thanksgiving to make your early decisions.</p>
