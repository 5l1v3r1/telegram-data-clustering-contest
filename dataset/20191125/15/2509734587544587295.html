      <h1>Staying Strong Despite Our Parkinson’s Challenges</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T15:00:04+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 15:00</time> by <a rel="author">Sherri Woodbridge</a></address>
      <p>This column is about strength and how we endure despite our challenges with Parkinson’s.</p>
      <p>As politician and actor Arnold Schwarzenegger <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/35835-strength-does-not-come-from-winning-your-struggles-develop-your">once said</a>, “Strength does not come from winning. Your struggles develop your strengths. When you go through hardships and decide not to surrender, that is strength.”</p>
      <p>We often feel weak and tired. Our bodies can’t move in the ways they once could. We can’t exert ourselves the way we used to. Though physically we may feel that we are losing ground with Parkinson’s disease, we persevere, putting one foot in front of the other as we keep moving forward.</p>
      <h3>Our abilities are stronger than our disabilities</h3>
      <p>When we have Parkinson’s disease, we are considered disabled. Our movements, our senses, and our abilities to engage in the activities we once enjoyed may be limited or impaired. We can feel that we are powerless against a force that seeks to destroy us.</p>
      <p>However, we are strong despite this disease. Though our physical strength might wane, we summon our mental and emotional resources to push onward. We are resilient and unrelenting in our determination to win our battle with this disease.</p>
      <p>I believe that people with a chronic disease such as Parkinson’s often have a greater tendency than others to exhibit a positive attitude. We have been forced to face our mortality, and as a consequence, we can be more open and see clearly the daily blessings bestowed upon us.</p>
      <h3>A positive attitude brings life into a room</h3>
      <p>Negativity is replaced with optimism and laughter. Having a positive attitude is a sign of strength of character. When things are on the downturn, we are looking for a way up and out. A positive attitude is a frame of mind that says “I can” instead of “I can’t.” We believe that “it’s possible” rather than “impossible.”</p>
      <p>Strong people are grateful despite their circumstances and know how to encourage others because of what they have been through. They continue on their journey, <a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/2019/11/13/rainmaker-hope-share-story-empathy/">bringing hope to others</a> and light to the dark places.</p>
      <p>Do you shine light into the lives of others? I hope that I do.</p>
