          <b>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater remains one of the most beloved skating series despite the game having a massive fall from grace since the lofty days of the originals 1999 release.</b>

      <p>Eight annualized sequels took its toll on the series which quickly lost not only appeal but quality too.</p>
      <p>A 32% Metacritic score for the last entry in the series, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5, shows just how far the game fell by 2015.</p>
      <p>Now it appears Activision and Tony Hawk's Pro Skater series could be making an unexpected return, according to a variety of rumours swirling around the internet this past weekend.</p>

        <figcaption>PlayStation and Xbox fans get excited, it sounds as though Tony Hawk Pro Skater remakes could be coming in the not too distant future</figcaption>

      <p>The news originates from industry insider Sabi , who in the past has been something of a fairly trustworthy source of information and leaks.</p>
      <p>Speaking on Twitter, Sabi told follows that Activision had more recently developer several prototypes of the skateboarding classics Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 and 2.</p>
      <p>This isn't to say something is in development right now, but rather, some demos have been passed around internally, potentially with a view to remaking the games in the future.</p>
      <p>Sabi went on to explain that he was aware of these demos but didn't shared the information because " I wasnt sure if they were being remade as full games, or just a test."</p>
      <p>However, a similar report byÂ <i><b><a href="https://twitter.com/Doctor_Cupcakes">Liam Robertson</a></b></i>, another journalist with heavy ties looking into the long lost series and IP's, appears to confirm that something is indeed going on behind the scenes.</p>

      <p>Given the remarkable success of both Crash Bandicoot and Spyro the Dragon, it shouldn't come as too much of a surprise that Activision could once more be looking internally at their past successes as possible avenues for new games.</p>
      <p>That said, it's not clear in what capacity Tony Hawk would be involved, having parted ways with Activision following the abysmal Tony Hawk 5 release.</p>
      <p>Writing in 2018, Hawk told fans on Twitter: "To anyone asking me to 'remaster" old games, or complaining about THPS servers being down: Activision owns the THPS license but I am no longer working with them. If I had the skills / authority to reboot servers or code games for newer systems on my own, I would be happy to..."</p>
      <p>Despite launching his own mobile game, Tony Hawk's Skate Jam, a year ago, we wouldn't be surprised if Activision were to at least consult Hawk if they were looking to remaster the original games that proved so popular.</p>
      <p>With Skate 4 seemingly never coming out, a new Tony Hawk game could prove incredibly popular with fans.</p>
      <p>We doubt this will be one of the many announcements expected at The Game Awards 2019 in December, but you never know.</p>
