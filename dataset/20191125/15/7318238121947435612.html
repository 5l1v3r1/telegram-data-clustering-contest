      <p>Tokyo provides a real journey into art for visitors searching for a different perspective of Japan's huge capital.</p>
      <p>Internationally renowned Japanese artist, <a href="http://ly-m.net/">Ly</a>, for example, has created a world by painting on walls.</p>
      <p>In Japan street art is illegal. So Ly works for private clients who ask her to paint on their buildings, offices and shops.</p>

      <p>The main character of her works is LUV, a little monster, inspired by herself.</p>
      <p>"The world I had in my mind was very big and I thought that the wall was the most appropriate way to represent it on a life size-scale," she says, "And i decided to start with street art."</p>

        <b>The teamLab universe</b>
      </p>
      <p>TeamLab is a group of artists whose aim is to break the barriers between art and the public.</p>
      <p>"We believed that art or creativity is something that we cannot explain by words but is more like to be inside of art," says teamLab artist Takashi Kudo.</p>

      <p>There are two teamLab Museums in Tokyo: Borderless and <a href="https://planets.teamlab.art/tokyo/">Planets</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://borderless.teamlab.art/">Borderless</a>, at the Mori Building Digital Art Museum in Odaiba, a district of Tokyo, you can find art blended with technology.</p>

      <p>Even in <a href="https://en-tea-house.teamlab.art/odaiba/">its cafeteria</a>, the En Tea House, this theme continues with flowers blooming inside the cup, as long as there is tea in it.</p>
      <p>"In Borderless some people are confused. Some people are impressed. Some people are taking their Instagrams. We donâ€™t force anything. There are no right answers: this is like life," says Takashi Kudo.</p>
      <p>"The planets is like a more immersive experience. You are gonna take off your shoes and you are gonna be barefoot. Is like an unusual experience. It also makes you discover something in real life."</p>
