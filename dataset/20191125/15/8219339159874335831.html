      <h1>Apple Card 3% cashback offer expands to Nike stores</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T15:52:47+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 15:52</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5mac.com/author/benjaminmayo/" target="_blank">Benjamin Mayo</a></address>
      <p>Joining <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/08/20/apple-card-united-states-live/">Uber</a>, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/09/19/t-mobile-3-percent-cashback-apple-card/">T-Mobile</a>, and <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/09/12/apple-card-cashback-walgreens/">Walgreens</a>, Nike is the latest partner to sign up for the 3% cashback offer with its Apple Card credit card.</p>
      <p>Any purchase from Nike retail stores, Nike’s online store, SNKRS, Nike Running Club and the Nike app. The offer is limited to retail stores in the United States.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-card/#section-cash-back">Apple says</a> that Apple Pay support for Nike.com is coming soon, which would then also qualify for 3% cashback.</p>
      <p>Any purchase from Apple on the Apple Card qualifies for 3% Daily Cash but — like the other third-party partners — you must buy your Nike shoes using Apple Pay to get the 3% back.</p>
      <p>Apple and Nike have a long history of working together, including creating Nike-branded Apple Watch models and watch bands as well as previous <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2018/12/18/apple-pay-nike-promo-holiday/">Apple Pay offers</a>.</p>
      <p>Apple says that the list of brands that participate in the 3% cashback can change at any time, but so far no company has left the program once inducted.</p>
      <p>The standard Apple Card cashback rates are 1% for purchases made with the physical titanium card, 2% for Apple Pay transactions and 3% for Apple hardware and services purchases.</p>
