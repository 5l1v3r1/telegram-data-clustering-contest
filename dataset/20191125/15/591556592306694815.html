        <b>The AMD Ryzen Threadripper 3990X will be an absolute beast of a processor... but you'll have to wait until 2020 for it to land.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Looking for the ultimate CPU to be at the heart of your monster desktop workstation? I suggest holding off until 2020 for AMD to release the new Ryzen Threadripper 3990X.<br/><br/>We don't have a whole lot of information yet -- this is more of a tease by AMD -- but the information we have so far is just amazing -- you might want to be sitting down before reading this:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Name</b>: AMD Ryzen Threadripper 3990X</li>
        <li><b>Cores/Threads</b>: 64/128</li>
        <li><b>Total cache</b>: 288 MB</li>
        <li><b>TDP</b>: 280W</li>
        <li><b>Availability</b>: 2020</li>
      </ul>
      <p>And that's all we have.<br/><br/>This is at totally the other end of the spectrum to the <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/amd-releases-first-unlocked-zen-based-athlon-processor-priced-at-49/">$49 unlocked Athlon</a> that AMD unveiled the other day -- this Threadripper 3990X chip is going to be substantially more than $49. The 32-core Ryzen Threadripper 2990WX currently retails for around $1,800.<br/><br/><b>See also:</b></p>
