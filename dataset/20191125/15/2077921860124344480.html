      <h1>Watch Jonathan Glazer's Disturbing New Short Film, The Fall</h1>

      <p>After screening in front of <i><a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2019/09/the-lighthouse-review.html">The Lighthouse</a></i> in select cities earlier this month, <i><a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2019/11/jonathan-glazer-a24-short-film-the-fall.html">The Fall</a></i>, the new short film from <i><a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2019/11/best-movies-2010s-decade.html?p=4">Under the Skin</a></i> director Jonathan Glazer, has made its way to the web. The surprise BBC Films/A24 production, previously only available online in the U.K., is now available for U.S. viewers to watch on <a href="https://us.thefall.film/">its website</a>.</p>
      <p>The dialogue-less, seven-minute short, reportedly inspired by Francisco Goya’s <i><a href="https://bit.ly/2O8IxVe">The Sleep Of Reason Produces Monsters</a></i>, finds a sinister masked mob pursuing a lone, similarly masked figure through the woods, where they’ve trapped their poor quarry in a tall tree. The hunted one is shaken loose from its branches and photographed like a hunting trophy, then hanged, taking the film’s titular fall. We won’t spoil the proceedings from that point forward except to say they move in a downward, distinctly Glazer-esque direction, with a big assist from Mica Levi’s (<i>Under the Skin</i>) mesmeric music.</p>
      <p>Glazer is currently <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2019/10/jonathan-glazer-under-the-skin-new-movie.html">readying his next feature film</a> for A24, an untitled Holocaust drama that shoots in 2020. It will be the director’s first new film in seven years.</p>
