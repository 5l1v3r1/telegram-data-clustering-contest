      <p>In an interview with State House correspondents after the meeting, Dr. Adedoyin said that the visit was to invite the Vice President to the university’s forthcoming convocation.</p>
      <p>He said that the delegation had a productive discussion with Osinbajo.</p>
      <p>According to him, “We have our convocation ceremony coming up on Nov. 27 and No. 28 and we have come to invite the vice president to grace the occasion.</p>
      <p>“That is precisely why we are here and to pay him a courtesy visit too.</p>
      <p>“We charted with him and it was very fruitful.’’</p>
      <p>On the role of educationists in reshaping the society, Adedoyin said he believed that education could be used in building worthy citizens who would be impactful to society.</p>
      <p>He said he had deployed what God endowed him with towards the growth of society as Oduduwa University had produced professors, medical doctors among others</p>
      <p>On the role of the traditional institution in ensuring security, he said that traditional rulers knew the grassroots and should be engaged in maintaining security.</p>
      <p>Adedoyin, who is the Maye of Yorubaland, said that the council of kings administered the nation before the advent of civilisation.</p>
      <p>“So, I believe that the role should still continue because they are the people who know the grassroots.</p>
      <p>“If you look at it very well from the scratch, if you take care of your child from the scratch, apart from the school that he goes; I think you have done very well.</p>
      <p>“So, the traditional institution is playing a very vital role in this country,’’ he said</p>
