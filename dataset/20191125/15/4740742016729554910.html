      <h1>Inside axe-throwing attraction Whistle Punks as it opens in Bristol city centre</h1>
      <h2>It's the first of its kind in Bristol</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T15:36:52+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 15:36</time> by <a rel="author">Robin Murray</a></address>
      <p>A former nightclub in <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-city-centre">Bristol city centre</a> has been transformed into an axe-throwing attraction.</p>
      <p>Once upon a time shapes were thrown on the dance floor of Panache on All Saints Street, <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/whats-on/music-nightlife/old-bristol-nightclubs-venues-closed-962839">which closed in 2011</a>, but following the launch of Whistle Punks last week they have been replaced with hatchets.</p>
      <p>Whistle Punks' fourth and largest venue in the UK boasts six lanes, a lively soundtrack, a well-stocked bar and food supplied by one of <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/whats-on/food-drink/best-pizza-bristol-national-day-10146">Bristol's best pizza purveyors</a>, Pizzarova.</p>
      <p>Founded in 2016, Whistle Punks is the first brand to bring axe throwing to the UK high street and has sites in London, Manchester and Birmingham.</p>

      <p>A spokesperson said bookings at the Bristol site are already filling up fast, with members of the public keen to be among the first to try out this new competitive socialising activity.</p>
      <p>Jools Whitehorn, co-founder of Whistle Punks, said: "Bristol was a natural choice in which to build the first of our next generation of venues.</p>
      <p>"Having just officially launched and opened our doors to the public, we’ve already been blown away by the reception that we’ve received.</p>
      <p>"It’s great to get a real sense of the atmosphere and see the new space in full swing, literally, with axes being thrown and plenty of delicious pizzas being baked."</p>

      <p>Whistle Punks axe throwing sessions last for 70 minutes and take place on a lane consisting of two targets, with up to 10 players per lane.</p>
      <p>Sessions begin with tips and coaching on how to safely and successfully sling an axe, with expert instructors who stay with the group for the duration of the session.</p>
      <p>Once the practice is over, a tournament takes place in each lane and as soon as the winner is crowned, it’s celebration time in the venue's on-site bar.</p>
