        <b>In an interview ahead of the Champions League game between Real Madrid and Paris Saint Germain (PSG), PSG star Idrissa Gueye has sent a strong message to his teammates, asking them to be prepared so as to finish above the Spanish giants in the group stage table.</b>
      </p>
      <p>“We’ve already qualified, so now we have to do all we can to keep top spot in the group, which is important for the club,” Gueye told the <i><a href="https://en.psg.fr/teams/first-team/content/idrissa-gueye-keep-top-spot">club’s official website</a></i>, on Monday.</p>
      <p>He further added: “We’re going to do everything to prepare well for the game and above all keep the top spot, which could be important for the rest of the competition.”</p>
      <p>Reflecting on the reverse fixture which was held in Paris, Gueye described it as “special”.</p>
      <p>“It was good, but in the same way as all the other games. It’s true that the match against Real was a bit special for me because it was my Champions League return and it was my first game for my new club in the competition,” he said, before concluding:</p>
      <p>“It was important for me to play well and for the whole team. We needed to win to start the group stage well. So, things went well.”</p>
