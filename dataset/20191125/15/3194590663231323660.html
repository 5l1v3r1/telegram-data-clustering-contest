        <b>Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, Nigeria’s award-winning novelist and feminism activist, has been honoured with the United Nations Foundation Global Leadership Award.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 42-year-old author was honoured with the prestigious prize at ‘We the Peoples’, the UN Foundation’s 2019 global leadership dinner held in New York.</p>
      <p>The award celebrates outstanding individuals whose work “brings to life the goals enshrined in the UN Charter to promote peace, justice, and fundamental human rights for all people.”</p>

      <p>It also recognizes her use of literature and storytelling to “connect with people across generations and cultures” when it comes to issues bothering on gender and racial equality as well as her “being a leader on the frontlines of global progress.”</p>
      <p>Adichie has earned prestigious awards through her works ‘Purple Hibiscus’, ‘Half of a Yellow Sun’, and ‘The Thing Around Your Neck’, all of which have been translated into several languages — delivering two acclaimed talks at the TED conference.</p>
      <p>She was recently <b><a href="https://lifestyle.thecable.ng/national-geographic-celebrates-chimamanda-adichie-michelle-obama/">named alongside Oprah Winfrey</a> </b>and Melinda Gates who will be celebrated in National Geographic’s forthcoming book ‘Portrait of Power’.</p>
      <p>On the heels of her waxing career masterstrokes and social influence, Adichie had made the New African’s list of “100 Most Influential Africans”, the New Yorker’s “20 under 40”, and Time Magazine’s “100 Most Influential People”.</p>
      <p>With this, the prominent author becomes the first Nigerian honoree to receive the award.</p>
