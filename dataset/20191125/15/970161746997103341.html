      <p>There’s nothing quite like a steamy mug of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/24/fancy-a-hot-chocolate-these-are-the-best-places-to-get-one-in-london-this-winter-11208687/">hot chocolate</a> when the weather gets colder.</p>
      <p>And with these amazing treats, you can create a cup, complete with cream and marshmallows in under 20 seconds.</p>
      <p>Created by Wildflower Cakes, based in Glen Parva, Leicestershire, the bombes are spheres of chocolate, with fillings inside.</p>
      <p>Pop the ball in a mug and pour hot milk over the top.</p>
      <p>When the milk melts the chocolate, the fillings burst out and float to the top.</p>
      <p>The balls are available in a range of flavours including dark chocolate, milk chocolate, white chocolate, mint chocolate, orange, Caramac and even Baileys.</p>

      <p>A standard chocolate bombe is £1.50 and one of the luxury flavours is £2.50.</p>
      <p>You can also get a vegan version for £2.50.</p>
      <p>The bombes come in individual boxes, tied with twine, so would make a great gift.</p>
      <p>The bakery posted a video of the process on Facebook and people loved it, with over 1.7 million people watching over the weekend.</p>

      <p>The bombes have proven to be so popular, the small bakery has had to promise to set up a website for all their new customers.</p>
      <p>Initially, they were only going to sell them locally but they are now looking to set up a service to post them across the UK, so keep an eye on their <a href="https://www.facebook.com/wildflowercakesandbakes/?tn-str=k*F">Facebook page</a> for your chance to buy.</p>
      <p>Lots of fans were excited to get their hands on one for the festive period and many said they would be keeping them for their <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/make-perfect-christmas-eve-box-11193917/">Christmas Eve boxes.</a></p>
      <p>The bakery said their new website would go live this week so be prepared to get your order in.</p>
