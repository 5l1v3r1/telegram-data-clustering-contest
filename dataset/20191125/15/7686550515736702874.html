      <h1>Brian O'Driscoll's perfect analysis of how Dan Biggar pulled off the sublime moment that has rugby fans drooling</h1>
      <h2>'He knew exactly what he was doing', says O'Driscoll</h2>

      <p>It’s the pass everyone has been talking about and now one of the legends of the game has provided a fascinating insight into exactly how Dan Biggar pulled it off.</p>
      <p>The Wales outside-half produced one of the moments of the weekend during Northampton’s <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/rugby/rugby-news/dan-biggar-northampton-wales-rugby-17305898">dramatic Champions Cup victory</a> over Benetton.</p>
      <p>His flicked pass behind his back to set up a try for winger Tom Collins was a thing of absolute beauty and a masterful piece of skill.</p>
      <p>But, according to Ireland and Lions great Brian O’Driscoll, it was more than just showboating.</p>
      <p>Analysing the incident on BT Sport, O’Driscoll outlined precisely what Biggar was thinking.</p>
      <p>“It might seem full of trickery, but there’s a little bit more to it than meets the eye,” he said.</p>
      <p>“It’s the line that he runs.</p>
      <p>“Rather than fading on the pass and inviting the defence to drift with him, what he did was attack it short.</p>
      <p>“He invites the defender in, making him think he’s going to challenge to the line himself.</p>
      <p>“As soon as he takes it to the line, that defender feels as though he’s going to carry.</p>
      <p>“That’s when he’s able to play it out the back and create a simple two-on-one.</p>
      <p>“He knows exactly where his support player - Tuala - is, then it’s straight to Collins, great try.</p>
      <p>“It’s not just showboating. He knew exactly what he was doing.</p>

      <p>“He sucked the defence into thinking he didn’t have that pass on and a player of his calibre is able to deliver those sort of plays.</p>
      <p>“So it might look fantastic, you might think it’s a box of tricks, but it’s really great play from a very, very smart footballer.</p>
      <p>“We’ve seen him do these sort of things for Wales and the Ospreys over the years.</p>
      <p>“He’s a really smart footballer with great vision.”</p>
      <p>Not content with that piece of magic, Biggar went on to land a nerveless match-winning penalty with the final kick of the game.</p>
      <p>That gave him a 15-point haul to go with the 20 points he contributed during a Man of the Match performance against Lyon the week before.</p>
      <p>“He’s been excellent so far this season,” commented O’Driscoll.</p>
