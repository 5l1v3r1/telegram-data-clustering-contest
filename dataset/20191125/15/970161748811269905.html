      <h1>Taylor Swift needs to call off her fans after they threatened Scooter Braun</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T15:38:47+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 15:38</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://metro.co.uk/author/mel-evans/" target="_blank">Mel Evans</a></address>
      <p>Fans can be both the best and worst of things to come out of superstardom. They’ll support their favourite star to the top, but they’ll also step on the bodies of said favourite star’s enemies if it calls for it.</p>
      <p>And when <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/taylor-swift/">Taylor Swift</a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/22/scooter-braun-begs-taylor-swift-talk-sickening-death-threats-remains-silent-11203564/"> encouraged her fans to go after Scooter Braun</a> to try and convince him to change his mind about their ongoing feud over her musical masters, the singer knew exactly what she was doing by getting her fans involved, even if she didn’t intend the extreme reactions of some. But now, now things are getting dark, she needs to call them off.</p>
      <p>Pleading with fans, she said in her lengthy statement over a week ago: ‘Please let Scott Borchetta and Scooter Braun know how you feel about this. Scooter also manages several artists who I really believe <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/15/shawn-mendes-branded-coward-taylor-swift-fans-stays-silent-scooter-braun-row-11163783/">care about other artists and their work</a>.’</p>

      <p>History will tell her that her fans are hardly going to enthuse a conversational, honest discussion and instead, as prophesied, they bombarded the mogul and his family with death threats.</p>
      <p>In turn he was forced to beg Taylor to call off the hounds so they could have a less-public rhetoric about something that was, ultimately, a professional discussion, after a Swift supporter said they’d buy a gun to kill his family.</p>

      <p>‘I assume this was not your intention but it is important that you understand that your words carry a tremendous amount of weight and that your message can be interpreted by some in different ways,’ he said.</p>
      <p>‘While I am frustrated with your accusations and respectfully disagree with many of your statements, it is important that I am clear—no artist should ever feel cornered or bullied.’</p>
      <p>He then posted a screenshot of a message he received that read: ‘Hi, why dont you just die withyour children??? I will buy a gun tmr and them shoot you allin the head [sic].’</p>
      <p>I do believe Taylor would have attempted to have a chat with the big wigs behind closed doors and it all fell flat. I don’t think her game was a malicious ploy to air her dirty laundry on social media. What’s a girl to do when she’s not being heard, right? She was well within her rights to bring to light the injustices she was facing – but the line has to be drawn when you’re actively calling on your fans to reap revenge.</p>

      <p>While I also do believe this fan had no intention of buying a gun, stars need to know the power they wield over impressionable youngsters who want to avenge a perceived disrespect before someone is hurt or have irreparable damage caused for an innocent message, or a miscommunication.</p>

      <p>The fandom fighting on behalf of their hero is not a new thing, with the likes of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/04/25/justin-bieber-ariana-grande-lash-journalist-mocking-coachella-lip-syncing-9316008/">Ariana Grande refusing to apologise</a> after her masses of fans bombarded a journalist, some going so far as to make horrendous comments about the writer’s previous sexual assault, and, more recently,<a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/lizzo/"> Lizzo being sued by a Postmates delivery person</a> who was threatened after the Juice singer accused her of stealing her food en route and naming and shaming her to her millions of fans.</p>
      <p>Lizzo ended up apologising to the Postmates employee ‘for putting that girl on blast’.</p>
      <p>She added: ‘I understand I have a large following and that there were so many variables that could’ve put her in danger. Imma really be more responsible with my use of social media and check my petty and my pride at the door.’</p>
      <p>Now she’s being sued by the woman for ‘libel, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and invasion of privacy’.</p>
      <p>These superstars have a loyal fandom who will stop at nothing to make sure their idol is happy. It’s not necessarily cool when it happens to someone famous (just because you’re famous doesn’t mean you’re not human) and it’s deplorable when a non-famous person cops such wrath and threats for no reason in particular.</p>

      <p>The ability to hide behind a computer, a finsta, or egg Twitter profile means nothing is sacred online and even your simple, run of the mill writers like little old me aren’t immune.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>I’ve had to take cover, remove social media apps from my phone, have my boyfriend look through my notifications in case I need to alert my work to any threats – and I’m a flippin’ entertainment journalist who largely fawns over these stars. Hardly public enemy number one in the grand scheme of things, fam.</p>
      <p>I’m not trying to unravel some top-secret secrets or infiltrate government networks – yet once when I voiced a tongue-in-cheek lol about <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/01/25/adults-like-disney-need-grow-7257238/">adults who like Disney</a>, I received death threats, with those who disagreed with me tagging their networks to heap shit on my Twitter mentions.</p>
      <p>It’s always weird to receive a message from someone in Minnie Mouse ears, posing in the ‘happiest place in the world’, telling me to ‘delete myself’.</p>
      <p>Or there was that time I wrote about another celebrity’s quotes about wanting to sleep with Harry Styles. Not even my thoughts! Nek minit and I’m being sworn at by probable-teenagers for daring speak about the sex life of their Harry, like it was me who proclaimed I wanted to de-robe and throw myself at the altar of their God.</p>
      <p>The worst was that time I wrote about BTS by quoting other Army members’ thoughts on a mixtape. Soon I was receiving messages from my bosses, who, in turn, were being deluged with calls for my resignation because I dared quote a fan who they didn’t agree with.</p>
      <p>I know I walk this weird line between being a member of the public and being a member of the media, but at the crux of it, these are ridiculous battles to be in the middle of.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>Plus, it all dies down after a few days (mostly) but what happens when one day it doesn’t?</p>
      <p>I’ve not been hit with the full brunt of toxicity, I’m old news in 48 hours and I quite like that; I don’t feel the fear a fan may turn up at my door while I’m watching His Dark Materials after threatening my family with a gun.</p>
      <p>Please, fandom, know this isn’t a diss at your favourite celebrity Tay-Tay, despite what you might think this piece is about (I’m just asking for uproar, aren’t I?).</p>
      <p>I’m merely asking stars – like they’ll be reading this, pah! – to think more carefully before they incite their loyalists to enter the Gladiatorial ring in their millions on their behalf.</p>
      <p>And if you don’t agree, that’s fine. But let’s not threaten death, ok?</p>
