      <h1>Colombia expels 59 Venezuelans who took part in protests</h1>

      <p>Bogota (AFP) - Colombia said Monday it is expelling 59 Venezuelans for taking part in street protests, as another big march was planned despite the launch of a national dialogue to address corruption, economic inequality and other woes.</p>
      <p>The Venezuelans have been classified as a threat to public order and national security, the governmentâ€™s migration agency said.</p>
      <p>Since last Thursday Colombia has been hit by unprecedented mass protests against the government of unpopular conservative President Ivan Duque, thus joining a wave of grassroots anger that, for different reasons, has swept through Ecuador, Chile and Bolivia.</p>
      <p>Colombians want Duque to fight harder against corruption, improve public education and provide for more equitable economic growth. They are also concerned about management of a 2016 peace deal with leftist FARC rebels, which is unpopular with many Colombians.</p>
      <p>Duque's administration also has to deal with hosting 1.4 million refugees fleeing neighboring Venezuela's economic meltdown,</p>
      <p>Christian Kruger, the director of Colombia Migration, said the country had welcomed the 59 Venezuelans now due for expulsion as it did so many people from their beleaguered country.</p>
      <p>"But we will not tolerate a group of misfits coming to threaten the safety of our streets," Kruger said in a statement.</p>
      <p>He said the actions of these Venezuelans triggers "outbreaks of xenophobia" that hurts the reputation of good hardworking Venezuelans.</p>
      <p>Police had earlier reported that during a night of curfew on Friday 29 Venezuelans were arrested in Bogota and Cali for violating that order.</p>
      <p>Duque took part Sunday in the launch of a national dialogue with mayors and other government officials to address the gripes of the protesters, who were not represented in that initial session.</p>
      <p>People marched again Sunday and another big procession has been called for Monday by a major trade union.</p>
