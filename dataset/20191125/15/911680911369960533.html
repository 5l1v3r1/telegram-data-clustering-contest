      <h1>Supreme Court declines to hear appeal of Adnan Syed, subject of season 1 of 'Serial'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T15:06:17+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 15:06</time> by <a rel="author">Scripps National</a></address>
      <p>The Supreme Court has <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/serial-podcast-subject-syeds-appeal-rejected-by-supreme-court">declined</a> to hear the appeal case of Adnan Syed, the subject of the popular podcast <i>Serial</i>.</p>
      <p>Syed was asking the Supreme Court to reconsider his life in prison sentence after he was convicted of killing his ex-girlfriend, Hae Min Lee.</p>
      <p>Syed was appealing for a new trial, arguing ineffective counsel. Syed was granted a new trial in 2016 following a hearing in 2015. That ruling was upheld by Maryland's Court of Special Appeals in 2018, but was reversed on a 4-3 count in by Maryland's highest court, the Maryland Court of Appeals, in March.</p>
      <p>The Supreme Court's decision not to hear Syed's appeal effectively keeps the Maryand Court of Appeals ruling in place.</p>
      <p>The first season of <i>Serial</i> debuted in 2014. The podcast focused on specific pieces of Syed's case that could spark grounds for an appeal.</p>
