      <p>If you decide to bet on the upcoming Combate Americas mixed martial arts (MMA) event, which takes place Sat., Dec. 7, 2019 inside Payne Arena in Hidalgo, Texas, and lay $100 on Tito Ortiz, you’ll walk away with about seven bucks in profit.</p>
      <p>That’s because the former UFC light heavyweight champion recently swelled to a massive -1386 betting favorite over at <a href="https://www.bookmaker.eu/">BookMaker</a>. Probably because his opponent, former WWE superstar Alberto Del Rio, hasn’t competed in nearly a decade.</p>
      <p>A $100 bet on the 42 year-old PRIDE veteran, however, will net you $700.</p>
      <p>In case you’re wondering ... yes, that’s the biggest betting line Ortiz, 44, has enjoyed in his combat sports career. The second closest came against Chuck Liddell ahead of their Golden Boy laugher in late 2018, a fight <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2018/11/25/18110753/watch-chuck-liddell-vs-tito-ortiz-3-full-fight-video-highlights-mma-ppv-fite-tv-golden-boy-knockout">Ortiz won by first-round knockout</a>.</p>
      <p>Keep in mind we’re still roughly two weeks away from fight night, so that line will continue to shift in both directions. But if you’re thinking of taking Del Rio for the bookie-busting upset, best to strike while the iron is hot.</p>
