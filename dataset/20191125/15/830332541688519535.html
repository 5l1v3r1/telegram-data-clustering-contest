      <p>(CNN) - A man broke into the Rochester, New York, home of an 82-year-old woman. It didn't end well -- for him.</p>
      <p>Willie Murphy said she was getting ready for bed Thursday night when a man began pounding on her door, urging her to call an ambulance for him, <a href="https://13wham.com/news/local/he-picked-the-wrong-house-82-year-old-beats-up-break-in-suspect">CNN affiliate WHAM reported</a>.</p>
      <p>Murphy told WHAM she called the police but wouldn't let the man in her house. Then, she said, he became angry and broke through the door.</p>
      <p>"It's kind of semi-dark and I'm alone, and I'm old. But guess what, I'm tough," she said, bearing her muscular arms. "He picked the wrong house to break into."</p>
      <p>Murphy is an <a href="https://www.espn.com/espnw/life-style/story/_/id/24200181/at-81-willie-murphy-competitive-powerlifter">award-winning bodybuilder</a> who said she works out at her local YMCA almost every day.</p>
      <p>As Murphy tells it, she used a barrage of household items to attack the intruder, beginning with her own table.</p>
      <p>"I took that table and I went to working on him," she said. "And guess what? The table broke."</p>
      <p>Unphased, Murphy said, she used the metal legs of the table to keep hitting him.</p>
      <p>After jumping on him a couple times, Murphy ran to the kitchen, grabbed a bottle of baby shampoo and squirted it on the man's face as he tried to get up.</p>
      <p>It didn't end there. Next, she said, she took a broom and whacked him some more.</p>
      <p>By that time, the intruder was ready to leave. Though Murphy said she can deadlift 225 pounds, she struggled to drag the man out of the house.</p>
      <p>"He wants to get the heck out of there. And I'm trying to help him get out of the house, but he's too heavy. I can't move him. He's dead weight."</p>
      <p>At that point, the police arrived in response to Murphy's earlier call.</p>
      <p>"So they come in," she said. "He's laying down already because I had really did a number on that man. I'm serious."</p>
      <p>The man was put in an ambulance. Murphy thinks he was probably relieved to be out of the house.</p>
      <p>"I think he was happy when he went in the ambulance because I sent him in the ambulance. Yes, I did."</p>
