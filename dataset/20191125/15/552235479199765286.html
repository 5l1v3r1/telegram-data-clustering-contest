      <h1>Traffic wardens could be set for Dumbarton High Street return</h1>
      <h2>West Dunbartonshire Council is planning to take back control of parking from Police Scotland.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T15:58:52+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 15:58</time> by <a rel="author">Lennox Herald, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/lennox-herald/</a></address>
      <p>Dumbarton could be set for the return of the yellow peril, if new plans to enforce parking restrictions go ahead.</p>
      <p>Parking wardens could be pounding the pavements of the High Street once more, if council chiefs push on with a move to have control of parking enforcement handed back from Police Scotland.</p>
      <p>If they move forward with the bid to seek an order decriminalising parking violations on Dumbarton’s main thoroughfare, it could lead to the recruitment of council-sanctioned parking attendants.</p>
      <p>Councillors on the West Dunbartonshire authority rubber-stamped a move which could see them petition the Scottish Government for decriminalised parking enforcement permissions.</p>
      <p>They fear it is necessary to tackle the scourge of parking breaches which result in congestion.</p>
      <p>Councillors say having control of parking provision returned from the auspices of the police, will help improve the vitality of the area.</p>
      <p>Members of the infrastructure, regeneration and economic development committee, backed measures to regain control after hearing that effective parking management is known to improve access to town centre businesses and facilities, boost the economy and reduces frustrations.</p>
      <p>Councillor Iain McLaren, convener of the committee, said: “I am interested to hear more about any potential benefits we could see if we take over the powers for parking enforcement. I am aware that, particularly in Dumbarton town centre at the moment, we are experiencing safety issues due to illegal parking on junctions and pedestrian crossings, as well as illegal long-stay parking which reduces the availability for everyone else.</p>
      <p>“We want our town centres to be a place our residents and visitors want to come, and a build up of traffic or lack of parking can be extremely frustrating, so I look forward to seeing the findings of the report at the next committee.”</p>
      <p>Council officers will now be tasked with examining the feasibility of the proposals.</p>
      <p>Most of Scotland’s councils have applied for the power transfer from Police Scotland.</p>
      <p>A total of 21 local authorities have made the bid to manage their own parking affairs.</p>
      <p>The powers enable parking attendants to issue penalty charge notices to drivers breaching parking regulations in controlled areas.</p>
      <p>Councillors fear there has been an increase in traffic flow in the town, due to construction work on housing and shopping developments.</p>
      <p>Councillor Marie McNair, vice convener of the committee, added: “Inconsiderate parking is a problem all over West Dunbartonshire and I believe what is required is a change in driver behaviour, which could be achieved through enforcement. I welcome to opportunity to find out whether the council taking control of this can be of benefit to our communities.”</p>
      <p>More than 700 public car parking spaces are provided in Dumbarton town centre.</p>
      <p>Fears that additional traffic would be created and competition for spaces increased, if West Dunbartonshire Council moved to a town centre base from the former Garshake offices, were previously dismissed.</p>
      <p>The authority has also previously come in for criticism over controversial one-way provisions imposed on the High Street - a known congestion hotspot.</p>
