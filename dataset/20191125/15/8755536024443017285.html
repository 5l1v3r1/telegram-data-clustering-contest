      <p>The chef highlighted that baby Archie’s diet would be wholly “organic.”</p>
      <p>It is also said to be “seasonal and very simple” with “everything made fresh.”</p>
      <p>“There’s so much pre-made food available but I’m sure they would like doing everything themselves” they added.</p>
