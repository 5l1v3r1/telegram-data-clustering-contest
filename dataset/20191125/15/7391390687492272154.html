      </p>
      <p>The Moon finishes out her transit in all-or-nothing Scorpio today, teaming up with no-nonsense Saturn and powerful Pluto in Capricorn during the first half of the day. If we have pending projects or responsibilities to take care of, this cosmic combo can give us the perseverance and resolve needed to achieve our goals.</p>
      <p>Since Scorpio is a sign that also helps us to purge or release what we no longer need, today could also be a good day for cleaning house, literally and figuratively speaking. The urge to purge may be especially strong now as tomorrow's New Moon in Sagittarius approaches.</p>
      <p>By the evening, love planet Venus leaves happy-go-lucky Sagittarius for committed and hardworking Capricorn. With Venus in Capricorn, our values, relationships, and source of pleasure take on a more practical, tangible, and security-oriented means of expression.</p>
      <p>Read below to see what the stars mean for your sign today, and make sure to check out your <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/your-november-2019-monthly-horoscope-17894181">November 2019 monthly horoscope</a>.</p>
