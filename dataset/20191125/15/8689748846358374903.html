      <p>Former presenter with United Television (UTV), Maame Yeboah Asiedu has finally broken her silence on her unexpected departure from Despite Group Limited which was shrouded in so much controversies.</p>
      <p>The media personality and marriage counsellor told the hard-hitting host of the Delay Show, Deloris Frimpong Manso that <b><a href="https://www.ghbase.com/do-i-look-like-someone-who-can-be-sacked-maame-yeboah-asiedu-brags/">she wasn’t sacked as the rumour wind blew during that time.</a></b></p>
      <p>She then responded to claims that she had an intense rivalry with her colleague Adwoa Yeboah Adjei prior to her departure from UTV.</p>
      <p>”You know, I was the star of UTV during my days as a TV presenter at UTV so many Ghanaians just don’t understand why I left and that is why you always find such rumors circulating in the media but one thing you should know is that I never for once had a conversation with Adwoa with exception of exchanging pleasantries.</p>
      <p>She was never a friend nor a sister and you can ask her, we shared only a professional relationship,” she said.</p>
      <p>So clearly something went on ‘behind the scenes’ which culminated in her strange exit from the reputable media firm.</p>
