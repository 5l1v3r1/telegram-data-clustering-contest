      <h1>Pakistan to vaccinate stray dogs in a bid to stamp out rabies</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T15:45:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 15:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/ben-farmer/" target="_blank">Ben Farmer</a></address>
      <p>A province in Pakistan aims to vaccinate and sterilise half a million stray dogs in a bid to curb rabies deaths.</p>
      <p>Officials in Sindh said they would <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/0/mumbai-sees-record-low-number-deaths-rabies/">stop poisoning street dogs</a> to try to control the terrifying disease and instead attempt to catch, vaccinate and neuter them.</p>
      <p>Hospital doctors in the city of Karachi have said they see dozens of dog bite cases each day and the media in recent months have carried horrific reports of young children dying from rabies because of a lack of vaccine used to treat the disease.</p>
      <p>Rabies kills around 60,000 people a year and is present in more than 150 countries, but is considered a neglected disease, mainly affecting the rural poor. </p>
      <p>Gavi, the alliance trying to increase access to life-saving vaccines, said in November that its strategy for the next decade will include investment in rabies treatment.</p>
      <p>Both <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/rabies-fear-stalks-pakistan-hospitals-run-short-lifesaving-vaccine/">Pakistan and neighbouring India have this year reported shortages of rabies vaccine</a>, which can be given to people after they have been bitten.</p>
      <p>In the vast majority of cases the virus is spread by dog bites and once it reaches the nervous system and victims start to display symptoms, the disease is nearly always fatal. Survival can depend on prompt washing of the wound and vaccination after a bite.</p>
      <p>“Stray dog bites are an old and serious issue across the country and for the past few years we have found it serious in Karachi,” said Roshan Ali Shaikh, secretary of Sindh's local government department.</p>
      <p>Bites increased during the winter months, he said.</p>
      <p>“We were working on this issue for the past several months. The traditional method to kill stray dogs is not scientific. That is why we are bringing this project.”</p>
      <p>He said dogs would be tagged as well as vaccinated and then neutered to try to control the population. He said there would also be new animal shelters set up. The three-year project would cost £4.5m.</p>
      <p>As alarm has grown over the number of dog bites in Sindh, more than 34,000 of the animals have been culled in recent months. Rabies deaths have continued however. Many of those infected have been bitten in rural areas and are then brought to Karachi as relatives seek treatment.</p>
      <p>The incubation period between being infected and showing symptoms is between three and 12 weeks, depending on the site of the initial infection. Once symptoms have developed, rabies is almost always fatal. Rabies first symptoms can include anxiety, headaches and fever.</p>
      <p>Later there can be hallucinations and respiratory failure. Spasms of the muscles used for swallowing make it difficult for the patient to drink.  </p>
