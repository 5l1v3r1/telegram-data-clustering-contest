      <p>Kolkata: The Calcutta High Court on Monday directed state-owned telecom major <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/bsnl">BSNL </a>Ltd to settle unpaid wages of contractual workers within five weeks.</p>
      <p>Moving the court on behalf of a trade union, advocate Arunabha Ghosh submitted that workers under contractors for <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/bsnl">BSNL </a>have not received their wages since December last year.</p>
      <p>Ghosh submitted before the court that as per law, it is the onus of the principal employer to ensure that a contractor engaged by it is paying the wages of workers.</p>
      <p>He further said if a contractor fails to pay the workers' dues, it is the liability of the principal employer to settle the wages.</p>
      <p>Opposing the prayer, the lawyer representing the telecom major submitted that it is not possible for the company to furnish the amount left unpaid by the contractors.</p>
      <p>Justice Shekhar B Saraf, after hearing both the parties, directed <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/bsnl">BSNL </a>to pay the wages due of the contractual workers within five weeks.</p>
