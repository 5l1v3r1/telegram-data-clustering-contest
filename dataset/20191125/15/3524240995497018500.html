      <h1>Real Madrid ‘not looking for revenge’ against PSG, says Zidane</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T15:17:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 15:17</time> by <a rel="author">Agency Report</a></address>
      <p>Zinedine Zidane said that his Real Madrid side is “not looking to get revenge” when they host Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League on Tuesday after a 3-0 defeat in France earlier in the group stage.</p>
      <p>Pressure mounted on Zidane after that loss at the Parc des Princes in September, but the 13-time European champions have since enjoyed an upturn in fortunes and sit behind leaders Barcelona only on goal difference in La Liga.</p>
      <p>Real can join PSG in securing a last-16 place with victory at the Santiago Bernabeu, or if Club Brugge fails to win at Galatasaray in the other Group A match.</p>
      <p>“We aren’t looking to get revenge after what happened earlier in the group,” Zidane said on Monday.</p>
      <p>“But we want to play a good game of course and maintain our form.</p>
      <p>“It’s the kind of game where you can confirm you’re on a good run. We want to win because we’re at home and we want to play good football.</p>
      <p>“I want to see my side play 90 minutes at their best.”</p>
      <p>Frenchman Zidane was rebuked by PSG sporting director Leonardo earlier this month for comments about a possible move for his compatriot Kylian Mbappe, when he said the Paris forward’s “dream is to play for Real Madrid”.</p>
      <p>The 47-year-old made clear again his admiration for Mbappe ahead of Tuesday’s encounter.</p>
      <p>“You know that I’ve known Mbappe for a long time and that I’m in love with him as a person because of when he came here on trial a long time ago,” said Zidane.</p>
      <p>“Having said that, he’s our opponent and there’s no more to it.”</p>
      <p>Real have recovered in the Champions League after also being held to a 2-2 home draw by Brugge in their second game, beating Galatasaray home and away including a 6-0 thrashing in Madrid last time out.</p>
      <p>Goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois is hoping the Spanish giants can show how far they have come since the loss in Paris.</p>
      <p>“The first meeting with them helped us learn a lot — it wasn’t a good game but we’ve improved a lot lately,” said the Belgian.</p>
      <p>“It’s not revenge, more wanting to get one over on another big team who have aspirations to win the Champions League and we need to show how good we are.”</p>
      <p>PSG lead Real by five points with two matches remaining and can secure top spot in the group by avoiding defeat.</p>
