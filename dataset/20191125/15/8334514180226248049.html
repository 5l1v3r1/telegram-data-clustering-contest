      <p>MILAN (Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/FCHA.MI">FCHA.MI</a>) has already started 90% of the investments earmarked for Italy, the auto maker’s Chief Operating Officer for the EMEA region Pietro Gorlier said on Monday.</p>
      <p>FCA - which is finalizing merger talks with France’s Peugeot owner PSA (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/PEUP.PA">PEUP.PA</a>) to try to create the world’s fourth-largest carmaker - announced last year it would spend 5 billion euros ($5.5 billion) in Italy up to 2021.</p>
      <p>The plan is aimed at helping the group launch its first electric and hybrid models and to fill capacity utilisation at its Italian plants.</p>
      <p>Gorlier said that despite unfounded speculation, FCA has “consistently confirmed the plan through action, with no delays”.</p>
      <p>“Around 90% of investments have been kicked off,” he said, according to the text of a speech he gave at the Italian car industry association ANFIA assembly, in the FCA plant in Melfi, southern Italy.</p>
      <p>As part of its 5 billion euro plan, FCA will launch form next year its full-electric 500 small car and hybrid and electrified models of its Maserati, Jeep and Alfa Romeo brands.</p>
