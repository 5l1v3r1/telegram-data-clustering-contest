      <p>Baby Yoda, the informal name given to a tiny unnamed creature in the Star Wars universe, has unquestionably been the breakout star of the flagship Disney Plus show, “The Mandalorian.”</p>
      <p>GIFs of Baby Yoda <a href="https://www.eff.org/takedowns/saga-disappeared-baby-yoda-gifs">disappeared</a> from Giphy last week, with a message saying they were “removed from giphy for copyright reasons.” Some fans speculated that either Disney made a copyright claim about the GIFs, or that Giphy preemptively removed them.</p>
      <p>A Giphy spokesperson told <a href="https://gizmodo.com/baby-yoda-gifs-are-back-online-and-giphy-has-apologized-1840028385?utm_source=gizmodo_twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=socialflow&amp;amp;utm_campaign=socialflow_gizmodo_twitter">Gizmodo</a> “Last week, there was some confusion around certain content uploaded to GIPHY and we temporarily removed these GIFs while we reviewed the situation,” a Giphy spokesperson told Gizmodo via email. “We apologize to both Disney and Vulture for any inconvenience, and we are happy to report that the GIFs are once again live on GIPHY.”</p>
      <p>Now, the GIFs have returned. Here are some great picks to send your friends.</p>
