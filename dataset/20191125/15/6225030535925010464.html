      <p>New York-bred <b><a href="https://www.horseracingnation.com/horse/Dugout_1">Dugout</a></b>, a two-time state-bred stakes winner as a juvenile last year, added to the resume Monday with a narrow victory in the $250,000 <b><a href="https://www.horseracingnation.com/stakes/Steel_Valley_Sprint">Steel Valley Sprint </a></b><b><a href="https://www.horseracingnation.com/stakes/Steel_Valley_Sprint">Stakes</a> </b>for 3-year-olds at Mahoning Valley Race Course.</p>
      <p>With Jareth Loveberry in the irons, Dugout stalked the pace while three-wide through fractions of :21.53 and :44.56 set by Dare Day, with odds-on favorite Call Paul pressing between horses. Dugout reeled in the pacesetter and surged past Call Paul in midstretch, then held off a bold late rally from Manny Wah by about a neck. Longshot Olympic Village completed the trifecta.</p>
      <p>Trained by Larry Rivelli, Dugout completed six furlongs in 1:11.19 and paid $21.80.</p>
      <p>“He’s a real nice horse and we always thought he was this kind,” said Rivelli. “He can run on the lead, he can come from off the pace and is just a real nice horse. One more jump and we might have gotten beat, but the rider rode him good and we got lucky.”</p>
      <p>A gelded son of Adios Charlie, Dugout is owned by Richard Ravan and Rivelli, who were also co-breeders, along with Patricia's Hope LLC.</p>
      <p>Last season, he won the Funny Cide Stakes at Saratoga and New York Breeders' Futurity at Finger Lakes. He had a pair of optional-claiming wins, including most recently at Hawthorne on Nov. 2, in four previous starts this year.</p>
      <p>Dugout boasts a record of 6-2-0 in nine starts with earnings in excess of $450,000.</p>
