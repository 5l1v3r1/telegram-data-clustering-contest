      <h2>He's coming for the infamous Katie Hill's seat.</h2>

      <p>Former Trump campaign aide George Papadopoulos announced Monday morning during “Fox &amp; Friends” that he is officially running for Democrat Katie Hill’s former House seat.</p>
      <p>Papadopoulos spent 12 days in prison in 2018 after being convicted of lying to investigators about his <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/07/politics/george-papadopoulos-prison/index.html">contact with</a> Russians during the 2016 campaign. He <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/30/us/politics/george-papadopoulos-congress.html">filed</a> for a House run at the end of October and officially launched his bid Monday for the California House seat.</p>
      <p>“When I go and talk around the districts, the state, the country, they tell me we need a candidate to represent the community that has an ‘America First’ agenda at heart that supports the president,” <a href="https://dailycaller.com/2019/05/19/gowdy-papadopoulos-transcripts/">Papadopoulos</a>, a Republican, said.</p>
      <p>The 32-year-old added that he will be looking to “enact legislation that has real-life consequences for the American people and my constituents.”</p>
      <p>“I’m speaking to you from Los Angeles today,” Papadopoulos continued. “And this is a state with tremendous potential. Unfortunately, the governing apparatus and the party in this state has driven it right into the ground.”</p>
      <p>Hill <a href="https://dailycaller.com/2019/10/28/katie-hill-sorry-imperfections-weaponized/">resigned</a> at the end of October after reports accused her of sleeping with a campaign staffer and a congressional staffer. It is against House ethics rules to sleep with a congressional staffer. A committee investigation was launched after the reports that ended when she resigned.</p>
      <p>The Democrat has called the allegations a “smear campaign” led by her “abusive” husband, whom she is in the midst of a divorce from.</p>
