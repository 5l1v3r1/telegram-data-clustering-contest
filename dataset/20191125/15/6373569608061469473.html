      <h1>Plymouth's new KFC restaurant has opened - but there's a difference</h1>
      <h2>The new KFC outlet is now open and is the first Small Box takeaway in the city</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T15:39:36+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 15:39</time> by <a rel="author">William Telford</a></address>
      <p>It’s opened with an archway of balloons to greet customers and founder Colonel Harland Sanders' portrait gazes down on them as they order their fried chicken via the latest tech.</p>
      <p>Yes, Plymouth’s new KFC outlet is out to show it is “finger lickin’ good”.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/news/plymouth-news/exactly-plymouths-first-small-box-3558941">“Small Box” outpost, in Old Town Street</a>, has opened just a week after the chain closed its branch in New George Street, on the other side of the city centre.</p>
      <p>The new outlet started frying on Monday, November 25, and will be open seven days a week, has created 15 jobs and the firm stressed no redundancies will result from closure of its other takeaway.</p>

      <p>A KFC spokesperson said: “We’re excited to continue serving KFC fans in our new home on Old Town Street. Opening on November 25, we‘ve created 15 new roles for future team members.</p>
      <p>“All our hen-tastic team from New George Street we’ve offered other roles in the area – see you soon Plymouth.”</p>
      <p>The global fast-food chain is now ensconsed in the unit once the home of clothing chain Salt Rock and only yards from the new £53million Drake Circus The Barcode cinema and leisure complex.</p>

      <p>The new chicken shop is part of the KFC brand’s “Small Box” roll-out, which means that instead of being a full-sized eatery with a large amount of seating it will only occupy a small footprint, as the concept is usually only found in busy pedestrian areas.</p>
      <p>KFC continues to be a shining star among food retailers, and, alongside Taco Bell, is the main growth brand for global parent Yum! Brands, with growth of 3% during the third quarter of 2019.</p>

      <p>As of December 2013, there were 784 KFC outlets in the UK, with British turnover at £684.5million. About 70% of outlets are run by franchisees, with the remainder company owned. The business employs 24,000 people.</p>
      <p>KFC may have closed in Plymouth’s West End but it may not be the end of KFC in the “bottom end of town” as speculation is continuing that an outlet will be housed in the new Plymouth Cross development, in what was once the Derrys department store.</p>

      <p>Plymouth Live has also reported that the company is planning to open five near restaurants and a drive-thru in Plymouth, one in Exeter, three in Cornwall, and four in South Devon, all in 2020.</p>
      <p>The chain has been offering £20,000 for those who find a new site in target areas.</p>
      <p>Plymouth already has KFC outposts in Union Street, Mutley Plain, Tavistock Road, Wolseley Road, and in late 2018 opened a large drive-thru at the Plymouth Gateway out-of-town shopping centre at Marsh Mills.</p>
