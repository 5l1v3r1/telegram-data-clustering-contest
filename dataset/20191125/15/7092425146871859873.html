          <b>A spectacular new live experience based on the hit Netflix documentary <i>Our Planet</i> is coming to Dublin's 3Arena next year.</b>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Our Planet Live in Concert will reimagine the Emmy Award-winning series as a live experience, combining highlights from the series with some brand new arrangements to create an immersive journey across Our Planet.</p>
      <p>Specially developed by the series producers Silverback Films, and Oscar-winning composer Steven Price, <i>Our Planet Live in Concert</i> is narrated on screen by legendary broadcaster, David Attenborough. Combining the outstanding natural world visuals of Our Planet with creative innovations in live production, this concert will be a live experience like no other.</p>
      <p><i>Our Planet Live in Concert</i> will tour international arenas with the Irish premiere being held in Dublin at 3Arena on October 16, 2020. Tickets for Our Planet Live in Concert go on sale at 9am, Friday, November 29 2019. Tickets will cost from €67 including booking fee.</p>

      <p>The landmark eight-part <i>Our Planet</i> documentary series is being reimagined into a two-hour arena show with beautiful visual and sound effects and will be accompanied by a 66-piece orchestra and live vocalist, Lisa Hannigan. Three giant screens will present the incredible cinematography of <i>Our Planet</i> on a scale that has never been seen before, allowing audiences to be fully immersed into the wonders of the Earth’s wildlife and their habitats. Intelligent lighting will heighten the visual experience beyond the screens and around the arena, programmed to run in sync with the footage.</p>
      <p><i>Our Planet</i> took the world by storm when it was released in April 2019. Taking viewers on a spectacular journey of discovery, showcasing the beauty and increased fragility of our natural world, the series explores the fact that humans have become the greatest threat to the survival of our planet, and all the species that inhabit it. The series also highlights the fact that there is still time to address the challenges that we have created, if we act now. It helped people to understand what is at stake and realise how imperative it was to lobby businesses and governments to start paying attention.</p>
      <p>All net profits from the Our Planet live project will be donated to WWF’s global Our Planet education and awareness initiatives. These include providing a wealth of educational materials for schools and young people, based on the series, with the aim to inspire and motivate the next generation to protect our planet.</p>
