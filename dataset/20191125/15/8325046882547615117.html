      <p>The “<a href="https://www.insider.com/category/black-panther">Black Panther”</a> sequel is not slated to come out until May 2022, but Angela Bassett – aka Queen Mother of Wakanda – is not wasting any time when it comes to getting into shape.</p>
      <p>“I have to stay ready, because I don’t know the day or the hour they’re going to call and say, ‘We’ve written the script, and we’re ready to start,” she told Insider. “So that you don’t have to get ready, it’s smarter to stay ready, or stay close to ready to your fighting weight.”</p>
      <p>Bassett, now an ambassador for the <a href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/angela-bassett-joins-know-diabetes-by-heart-calling-those-living-with-type-2-diabetes-and-cardiovascular-disease-to-share-their-stories">Know Diabetes by Heart</a> initiative from the American Heart Association and American Diabetes Association, lost her mother to congestive heart failure five years ago. Now, she’s encouraging everyone to make short <a href="https://www.insider.com/black-panthers-angela-bassett-diet-sweet-potato-brownies-and-bison-2019-11">bouts of activity part of their own daily routines</a>.</p>

      <p>She has mentioned before that she might like the Queen Mother to be ready to fight in “Black Panther 2.”</p>
      <p>“I would kid when we were working, saying, ‘When we come back for [“Black Panther 2″], [Queen Mother] is going to really get into the game,'” Bassett told <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Culture/angela-bassett-shes-ready-throw-black-panther-sequel/story?id=56780043">ABC News last year</a>. “She’s going to throw down.”</p>
      <p>In order to stay camera-ready for any eventual action scenes, Bassett says she likes to do cardio workouts, and she prefers the treadmill to the great outdoors.</p>
      <p>“I’m not a run outside type of person, because I just get too distracted,” she said. “I like to see how far I’m going and how long, I love the numbers, I love the numbers!”</p>
      <p>She also does not tend to brave the gym alone.</p>
      <p>“I have to be held accountable, so I will pay a trainer,” Bassett said. “If you can’t pay a trainer, then you got a friend, I’ll take a friend with me, and as it’s been said, we go further together.”</p>
      <p>Studies suggest that <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/couples-lose-weight-together-partner-ripple-effect-weight-loss-2018-2">this kind of partnering technique really works.</a> Your healthy (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17652652">or unhealthy) behaviors</a> can have a “ripple effect” on the people you <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20813952">live, work, and play</a> around.</p>
      <p>Plus, moving more often is great for your heart, and in partnership with a good diet, can <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/genomics/famhistory/famhist_diabetes.htm">help prevent</a> or improve a diabetes diagnosis.</p>
