      <p>Ricky Gervais has hinted at the release date for <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/after-life/">After Life</a> season two.</p>
      <p>Ricky had a hit on his hands with the black comedy After Life so naturally he’s coming back for more.</p>
      <p>He’s currently working away on new episodes and hopes to be done and dusted with everything by the end of the year.</p>
      <p>After filming and then letting <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/netflix/">Netflix</a> work its magic with subtitles, we should see season two in the first half of 2020.</p>
      <p>Asked about the release date on The Graham Norton Show, he said: ‘That will be next spring. I’m editing now and I’ll finish that after Christmas.</p>
      <p>‘Then it takes two months to put it into, like, 120 languages. That’s why it takes so long.’</p>
      <p>The Derek star also spoke about how warmly viewers had received After Life.</p>
      <p>He explained: ‘I’ve never had a reaction like it and with social media now, you hear about it. It has been overwhelming and it’s the type of reaction as well.</p>
