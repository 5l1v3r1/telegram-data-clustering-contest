      <h1>Fantasy football injury report for Week 12: Dwayne Haskins, Carson Wentz</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T15:14:50+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 15:14</time> by <a rel="author">Samantha Previte</a></address>
      <p>Dwayne Haskins, Carson Wentz and Julio Jones were among those injured Sunday during Week 12 of the NFL season.</p>
      <p>Here’s a recap of the injuries to players across the league and how it could impact fantasy football:</p>
      <h3>Dwayne Haskins, QB, Washington Redskins (wrist)</h3>
      <p>Haskins was spotted in a sling after the game after he picked up his first career win against the Lions in Week 12. He told the media that he played with an injured wrist and he was banged up. He finished the day completing 13 of 29 passes for 156 yards, zero touchdowns and an interception along with three rushes for 28 yards. If Haskins’ wrist injury continues to bother him, the Redskins may switch back to Case Keenum.</p>
      <h3>Carson Wentz, QB, Philadelphia Eagles (hand)</h3>
      <p>Wentz went to the medical tent and into the locker room briefly during the second half of Sunday’s 17-9 loss to the Seahawks. He was evaluated for a hand injury, but determined he was okay to finish the game. He ended the day completing 33 of 45 passes for 256 yards, one touchdown, two interceptions and three fumbles (two lost).</p>
      <p>The Eagles quarterback underwent X-rays after the game, which were negative, but he left the stadium with his hand heavily wrapped. He is set to undergo additional tests this week to rule out any additional issues. While it does not seem serious at this time, backup Nate Sudfeld would start if Wentz misses time.</p>
      <h3>Julio Jones, WR, Atlanta Falcons (shoulder)</h3>
      <p>The Falcons receiver suffered a shoulder injury during the second quarter of Sunday’s 35-22 loss to the Buccaneers. He stayed in the locker room to have the shoulder evaluated, came back briefly, but then exited again. Jones finished the day with five catches on nine targets for 68 yards. It’s encouraging that Jones was able to return after the initial injury, but if he were to miss time, Calvin Ridley would have an even bigger role in an offense that is already shorthanded without Devonta Freeman and Austin Hooper.</p>
      <p>Russell Gage and Christian Blake are names to keep an eye on. Gage caught eight of 10 targets for 76 yards and Blake caught two of nine targets for 16 yards on Sunday.</p>

      <h3>D.J. Moore, WR, Carolina Panthers (arm)</h3>
      <p>Moore was carted off the field after an attempted two-point conversion to close out the first half. It appeared he had a serious arm injury after taking a hit from Saints defensive back C.J. Gardner-Johnson and was taken to the locker room.</p>
      <p>Panthers quarterback Kyle Allen said, “it looked gross.”</p>
      <p>Miraculously, Moore returned after halftime and picked up a huge fourth-quarter touchdown to tie the score at 31-31. He finished the day with six catches on nine targets for 126 yards and two touchdowns. The young wideout is averaging 110 receiving yards over the last four games.</p>
      <p>Hopefully, Moore will be healthy enough to take advantage of the Panthers’ Week 13 matchup against the Redskins.</p>
      <h3>Hunter Renfrow, WR, Oakland Raiders (ribs)</h3>
      <p>Renfrow suffered a rib injury in <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/24/jets-completely-dominate-raiders-for-third-straight-win/">Sunday’s 34-3 blowout loss to the Jets</a>. First, he was crushed between two defenders and was sidelined briefly. He returned, but then suffered the ribs injury in the second half and did not return. Renfrow caught three of five passes for 31 yards in a game in which quarterback Derek Carr sat down the stretch with the game out of reach. The severity of the injury is unknown, but Tyrell Williams would likely step up if Renfrow were out.</p>
