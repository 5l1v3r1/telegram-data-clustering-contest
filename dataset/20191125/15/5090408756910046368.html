      <h1>Michael Bloomberg has a new weapon in his $100 million ads offensive against Trump: a former Facebook executive, Business Insider - Business Insider Singapore</h1>

          <b>Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/mike-bloomberg-running-for-president-billionaire-former-nyc-mayor-2019-11">announced his presidential bid</a> over the weekend. He’s running as a Democrat against Sen. Elizabeth Warren, former Vice President Joe Bide, and Sen. Bernie Sanders, among several others.</b>
        </li>
        <li>Before announcing his presidential bid, he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/15/us/politics/michael-bloomberg-2020-ads.html">announced a $100 million TV advertising offensive</a> aimed squarely at President Donald Trump.</li>
        <li>
          <b>For his digital ads, Bloomberg’s campaign is turning to former Facebook executive Gary Briggs. He announced as much on his Facebook page over the weekend.</b>

      <p>In January 2018, when Facebook’s chief marketing officer Gary Briggs left the company after five years of working at the social-media giant, he indicated a vague interest in politics.</p>
      <p>“I plan to help the Democratic Party on some efforts leading up to the US midterms this year through to 2020,” <a href="https://www.facebook.com/garybriggs/posts/10154946712571106">he said on his Facebook page at the time</a>.</p>
      <p>Nearly two years later, Briggs is joining Michael Bloomberg’s presidential campaign as its digital director. He’s the man in charge of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/15/us/politics/michael-bloomberg-2020-ads.html">the candidate’s new $100 million digital-ads offensive</a>.</p>
      <p>Briggs confirmed his new role in a Facebook post on Sunday:</p>

      <p>His role in the campaign has him working the other side of his previous role – he’ll work with Facebook and other digital services to promote Bloomberg’s presidential bid.</p>
      <p>Briggs brings a familiarity with Facebook’s ad policies to the Bloomberg campaign.</p>
      <p>He started with Facebook back in 2013 and stayed with the social-media giant for five years. Having been the chief marketing officer of one of the world’s most successful companies certainly won’t hurt, either, to say nothing of his prior achievements: He did marketing at Google and ran marketing at PayPal, with stints at Motorola and Pepsi before that.</p>
      <p>Despite increasing scrutiny on Silicon Valley, especially on Facebook, hiring Briggs indicates that the Bloomberg campaign isn’t afraid of being associated with the tech industry.</p>
      <p>The ads for Bloomberg’s presidential campaign began rolling out this weekend, the first of which you can see right here:</p>
