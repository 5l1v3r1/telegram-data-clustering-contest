      <p>It’s once again <a href="http://www.gizchina.com/tag/ebay">Ebay</a> o’clock, so we have for you some chinese products available from this giant marketplace for very favourable prices. This time we will be looking at two vastly different products from different categories, but hopefully we can please some eager buyers. We will be taking a closer look at the Xiaomi QCY T3 wireless earphones or the interesting SKMEI Fortitude mens watch. So let’s get down to it.</p>
      <p>Xiaomi QCY T3 earphones are a TWS model with dual ear design for channel separation, semi in-ear deasign for good fit and wearing comfort and the stable Bluetooth 5.0 waireless connection. With 6 mm bio-disphragm the sound is pretty good (after all the same is used in for example Sony MDR E888) and with dual microphones and CVC 6.0 noise cancellation your headset experience is complete. Throw in the IPX5 waterproof certification or 60 mAh battery for each earphone paired with 600 mAh charging case and you have great earphones to get. And available in white or black<a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=254428816565"> for only $26.80 on Ebay in global version</a>.</p>

      <p>And if you want to take a break from the real smart products, then you could maybe take a glimpse at the SKMEI brand watches. Like the SKMEI 1426 model with all the practical functions, 5ATM waterproofing, EL lamp for lighting the dial in the dark, clear resin mirror, ABS case build, PU strap and more. Available in four different colors <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=383272301458">and you will spend only $6.98</a>.</p>
