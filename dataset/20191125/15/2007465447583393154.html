      <h2>Arriving at a dealership near you, the 2020 Jeep Gladiator</h2>

      <p>Always wanted to get an all-new Jeep Wrangler but preferred it with a bed at the back? Your only choice for that conundrum is to get the <a href="https://www.autoindustriya.com/auto-industry-news/2020-jeep-gladiator-is-a-wrangler-with-a-pick-up-s-bed.html">Jeep Gladiator</a>. Sadly, it has not arrived in the Philippines...yet.</p>
      <p>Those that have been eagerly awaiting its arrival in the country rejoice as Jeep Philippines recently announced that it will be arriving in mid-2020. That's right, the pick-up version of the Wrangler will soon be available in the Philippine market starting in the middle of next year.</p>

      <p>But what variants will we get exactly? Looking at what the US market gets, the Gladiator is available in four trim models; Sport, Sport S, Rubicon, and Overland. If we take a look at the current Wrangler range offered here, the PH-spec Gladiator might also come in either Sport or Rubicon. This could mean the Gladiator may go from mild to wild.</p>

      <p>There is also no word as to what engine will power the PH-spec Gladiator. What we do know is that it is available with either gas or diesel power. First up is the 3.6-liter Pentastar V6 which doles out 288 PS and 352 Nm of torque. Last but not the least is the 3.0-liter EcoDiesel V6 which puts out 263 PS and a whopping 600 Nm of torque. Both can be mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission.</p>

      <p>In true Jeep fashion, the Gladiator will come with the Command-Trac 4WD system as standard, as well as a two-speed transfer case with a low-range transfer box, and heavy duty Dana 44 front and rear axles. Front and rear locking differentials could also be available to help in better traction through off the beaten path.</p>
