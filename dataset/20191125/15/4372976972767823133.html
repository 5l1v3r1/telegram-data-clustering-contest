      <h1>Nissan offers Leaf buyers $250 EVgo charging credit</h1>
      <h2>'Nissan Energy Perks by EVgo' replaces 'No Charge to Charge'</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T15:05:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 15:05</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.autoblog.com/bloggers/tony-markovich/" target="_blank">Tony Markovich</a></address>
      <p>In the past, <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/tag/evgo/">EVgo</a> offered two years of free charging to <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/nissan/leaf/">Nissan Leaf</a> electric hatchback buyers in certain markets, but that deal expired on July 7, 2019. This week, <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/nissan/">Nissan</a> announced the replacement incentive, "<a href="https://usa.nissannews.com/en-US/releases/nissan-and-evgo-launch-nissan-energy-perks-by-evgo">Nissan Energy Perks by EVgo</a>." Starting November 1, 2019, Leaf buyers and lessees are given a $250 credit to use at EVgo's chargers.</p>
      <p>Thanks to a new partnerships with Chargepoint and <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2019/08/22/electrify-america-evgo-ev-charging-interoperability-agreement/">Electrify America</a>, EVgo's charging network is about 30,000 chargers strong. About 750 EVgo stations account for 1,200 fast chargers. The announcement comes only a few months after Nissan and EVgo committed to building 200 new 100-kW DC fast charging stations around the U.S.</p>
      <p>EVgo has numerous ways to pay for charging. For those who are not members, DC fast charging is between $0.27-0.35, depending on the region. An $8 monthly membership reduces DC fast charging prices a few cents and includes some perks such as longer charging sessions. Level 2 charging costs $1.50 per hour for everybody. By EVgo's estimations, that means the $250 credit is worth about 30 fast charging sessions, if you factor an average fast charging session length of 30 minutes. </p>
      <p>The deal is available on Nissans Leaf and Leaf Plus models now. We reached out to Nissan to see if this would be offered across to all Leaf customers. A Nissan spokesperson told <i>Autoblog </i> that the $250 credit "is depending on participating markets, however there are over 60 participating markets which cover the large majority of Leaf markets."</p>
