      <p>A TikTok video of an Ariana Grande look-alike is circulating on Twitter – and even caught the attention of the singer herself, who called the imitation “bizarre.”</p>
      <p>The TikTok was created by Paige Niemann, who often recreates Grande’s outfits and photos <a href="https://www.instagram.com/paigeniemann/">on her Instagram</a>. In the video, she mouths along to dialogue from <a href="https://www.insider.com/victorious-cast-then-and-now-photos-2019-3">Grande’s former role as Cat on Nickelodeon’s “Victorious.”</a>With her plump lips, pink jacket, high ponytail, and winged eyeliner, Niemann looks shockingly similar to the “Thank U, Next” singer.</p>
      <p>People are unnerved by the resemblance: “I just know Ariana is terrified,” one fan wrote on Twitter, while another added, “I’m really disturbed that this isn’t Ariana Grande.”</p>

      <p>“i just wonder whyyyy the cat voice / dialogue,” Grande replied. “i am sure she is the sweetest sweet sweetheart forreal !! but it’s definitley [sic] bizarre seeing people blend the two worlds lmao.”</p>
      <p>“literally every vid i see of someone trying to somewhat ‘mimic’ u it’s ALWAYS a connection w cat valentine instead of the actual you,” a fan wrote in response to Grande.</p>
      <p>“oof,” she replied.</p>

      <p>Indeed, Niemann has imitated Grande on TikTok using “Victorious” dialogue before.</p>

      <p>Grande was just 16 years old when she filmed the first season of “Victorious” as the bubbly, spacey, red-haired Cat Valentine. She reprised the role for four seasons and one season of its spinoff show, “Sam &amp; Cat.”</p>
      <p>She began her career in the music industry as her time on Nickelodeon was coming to a close. She released the lead single from her debut album in 2013, one year before “Sam &amp; Cat” was cancelled – and <a href="https://www.insider.com/ariana-grande-fashion-style-evolution-2019-6">slowly evolved into the sleek-haired pop icon she is today</a>.</p>

      <p>“I want to thank Dan Schneider for allowing me to play such a special, beautiful character who I hid behind for so long,”<a href="http://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1s2fke0">Grande wrote when “Sam &amp; Cat” was cancelled in 2014</a>. “What I mean by that is when I was younger, people loved Cat so much I used to pretend to be more like her. It took me a long time to be brave enough to separate myself and show people how different we actually are.”</p>
      <p>Although Grande has said she loved the role and <a href="https://www.insider.com/ariana-grande-victorious-costars-reunite-perform-concert-2019-11">remains close with many of her former costars</a>, she has also gently mocked the voice she used to play Cat.</p>
      <p>“some people think I’m like Cat &amp; they’re shocked when they meet me &amp; I’m actually not demented &amp; my voice isn’t strange and high,” she <a href="https://twitter.com/ArianaGrande/status/419460772943495168?s=20">wrote on Twitter in 2014</a>.</p>

      <p>Back in July 2018, Grande responded to another video of a fan, YouTuber Gabi DeMartino, who imitated Grande in a video titled,<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BX41qvpKbBs&amp;amp;t=382s">“i lived like ariana grande for a day parody.”</a></p>
      <p>In the video, DeMartino wears outfits similar to Grande’s style and imitates the way she used to laugh as Cat on “Victorious.” A fan noticed and posted the clip on Twitter, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHxM3vDVxDc">which prompted Grande to reply, “yeah this ain’t it.”</a></p>
      <p>She later deleted that tweet and <a href="https://twitter.com/ArianaGrande/status/1021068378293743616?s=20">apologised to DeMartino</a>: “i was just being funny i knew they’d laugh at that my bad babe. it’s all love here, u know that. ayo but next time can u wear more neutral tones and not do the cat laugh. jk.”</p>

      <p>DeMartino subsequently <a href="https://www.insider.com/ariana-grande-thank-u-next-music-video-mean-girls-legally-blonde-13-going-on-30-bring-it-on-2018-11">starred in Grande’s “Thank U, Next” music video</a> as one of her many obsessive admirers.</p>
