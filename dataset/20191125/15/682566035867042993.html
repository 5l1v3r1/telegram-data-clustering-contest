      <p>Cape Town - <b>Valtteri Bottas</b> admits <b>Red Bull </b>have made notable gains in recent weeks, saying they are "even stronger" than <b>Mercedes</b> expected.</p>
      <p><b>Max Verstappen </b>won the penultimate race of the season from pole to flag and Red Bull only missed out on a second podium spot after Alex Albon was taken out by Lewis Hamilton during the closing stages.</p>
      <p>Worryingly for Bottas and company is the fact that Red Bull are now "better than Mercedes" on the straights.</p>
      <p>"We knew they would be strong, but I think they were even stronger than we expected," the Finn toldÂ <i>Racefans.net</i>. "Especially in a straight line.</p>
      <p>"They have a good car in the corners now but in a straight line, they are better than us now. It used to be pretty similar to us."</p>
      <p>Mercedes had a big advantage over the rest of the field at the start of the year, but Ferrari eventually narrowed the gap and now Red Bull have also caught up.</p>
      <p>Asked if this will make for a more competitive start to the 2020 season, Bottas replied: "If you look at the beginning of the season to the end of the season, I think Red Bull has made some solid progress. So if you would draw that graph till next year, yes.</p>
      <p>"But obviously it's a completely new season with a new car. I'm sure every team has made progress, including us, with their new car that is going to be there in testing.</p>
      <p>"So it's impossible to predict, really. Everyone starts from zero, even though there's not many regulation changes it's still new cars."</p>
