        <figcaption>The drunken mishaps of Christmas drinkers at railway stations</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>British Transport Police and Network Rail have released shocking footage urging people to stay safe at railway stations when drinking over Christmas. <br/><br/>As part of a new campaign, the video <b>- which can be viewed above -</b> shows boozy Christmas passengers falling under trains, stumbling onto rail tracks and flying down escalators in genuinely astonishing footage. <br/><br/>It ends by saying: "Stay safe around the railway...or you might regret it." Incredibly none of the people suffered serious injuries.<br/><br/>The warning comes as new figures show a 30 per cent increase in alcohol-related incidents on the railway over the last decade. <br/><br/>Incidents rise to an average of 25 a day over Christmas- double the amount compared to previous months, and figures show there were 5187 alcohol-related incidents last December – compared to 4004 in 2010/11.</p>
      <p>These drunken mishaps can also result in misery for rail passengers.</p>

      <p>More than 4,300 hours of delays nationally were attributed to alcohol-related incidents last year.</p>
      <p>The British Transport Police and Network Rail are hoping to raise awareness of drink related railway injuries and what can be done to stay safe over the festive period. <br/><br/>Allan Spence, head of public and passenger safety for Network Rail, said: “The increase in alcohol-related incidents on the railway is a major concern, which is why we have joined with our colleagues at the BTP to urge passengers to stay safe over the festive period. <br/><br/>“Many of us would admit to doing things we regret after a few drinks, but the consequences of unsafe behaviour near the railway could last for much longer than just the morning after.”</p>
      <p>British Transport Police Inspector Becky Warren, explained: “We want everyone to enjoy the festivities and whilst it’s the party season, we don’t want you to have any next day regrets. <br/><br/>“We’ve seen first hand that alcohol can really affect your judgement and after a few drinks people often take greater risks, which can lead to people getting hurt or even killed. <br/><br/>“We also see people behave in ways they wouldn't when sober, so please be mindful of other passengers and rail staff who will be doing their best at this busy time of the year. <br/><br/>“We’ll have extra patrols in place to keep rail users and the network safe – always remember that though you may not see us – we’re looking out for you.” <br/><br/><b>Passengers are advised to stay safe by:</b><br/><br/>• Standing back from the platform edge, behind the yellow line <br/>• Holding onto the handrail on stairs and escalators <br/>• Walking – not running <br/>• Staying off the railway tracks <br/>• Using level crossings safely <br/>• Speaking to staff if help is needed.</p>
