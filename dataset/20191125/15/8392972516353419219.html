      <h1>The Queen 'won't strip Prince Andrew of title as he's favourite son'</h1>
      <h2>She won't take away his HRH</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T15:34:18+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 15:34</time> by <a rel="author">Richard Bell</a></address>
      <p>Prince Andrew won't be stripped of his royal title because he's the Queen's favourite son, Paul Burrell claimed on <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/daytime-tv/good-morning-britain/">Good Morning Britain</a>.</p>
      <p>The former butler to Princess Diana was on the programme today (25.11.19) to debate the issue, following the Duke of York's <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/prince-andrew-steps-back-from-royal-duties/">disastrous Newsnight interview</a> about his <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/prince-andrew-let-side-down-over-friendship-with-paedophile/">relationship with billionaire paedophile Jeffrey Epstein</a>.</p>
      <p>Presenter <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/piers-morgan/">Piers Morgan</a> asked Paul: "Once you set a precedent for removing an HRH title from somebody who's had it bestowed upon them, whatever the reason, why shouldn't Andrew now lose his, given that Diana had to lose [hers]?"</p>

      <p>His co-host <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/tag/susanna-reid/">Susanna Reid</a> quickly argued that the two - Andrew and Diana - represent completely different cases.</p>
      <p>But Piers continued: "Andrew's own wife, Sarah Ferguson, had hers removed..."</p>
      <p>Paul said: "Yes, because she's divorced from the royal family. Diana was divorced from the royal family. They were not part of the institution.</p>

      <p>"Andrew's a member of the royal family. He cannot lose his prince's title, he was born with that. He cannot lose his duke title, the queen bestowed that upon him."</p>
      <aside>This is her son, her favourite son.</aside>
      <p>Piers argued: "But the Queen can take away a title, she has that power. It has happened to other people."</p>
      <p>"But this is her son, her favourite son," Paul said, adding: "She's a 93-year-old mother, as well as being our monarch."</p>
      <p>Piers responded: "She just fired him from civil duty!"</p>

      <p>Journalist Eve Pollard, who was also on the show, then pointed out: "That must have hurt her quite a lot."</p>
      <p>It follows reports over the weekend that Prince Andrew's big 60th birthday bash had been cancelled, in the wake of him being 'sacked' from his royal duties - a decision in which Prince William <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/prince-william/prince-william-was-involved-in-decision-to-sack-prince-andrew/">was reportedly involved</a>.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/">Sunday Times</a> reported that, as the party had been cancelled, Her Majesty would be <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/the-queen-cancels-prince-andrews-60th-birthday-party-following-newsnight-interview-fallout/">organising a small family dinner for his birthday</a> on February 19 instead.</p>
