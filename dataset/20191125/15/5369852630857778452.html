      <p>LIVERPOOL ARE REPORTEDLY willing to allow Caoimhin Kelleher to leave on loan when the January transfer window opens. </p>
      <p>The Ireland U21 goalkeeper has played two Carabao Cup games for the Reds’ first team this season, while also featuring on the bench six times in the Premier League. </p>
      <p>He proved the hero against Arsenal last month <a href="https://www.the42.ie/arsenal-liverpool-penalties-report-4872980-Oct2019/">by saving Dani Ceballos’ penalty before Curtis Jones scored to win the shootout after the game had finished 5-5</a>. </p>
      <p>And while the Cork native is set to get another opportunity when they take on Aston Villa in the quarter-finals of the League Cup on 17 December — a day before their Fifa Club World Cup semi-final in Qatar — he is behind Alisson Becker and Adrian in the pecking order. </p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/liverpools-plan-rhian-brewster-revealed-17310894">the Liverpool Echo</a>, Jurgen Klopp could be open to farming Kelleher out on loan so he can gain experience, with Championship club Preston North End reportedly interested in the 21-year-old’s services. </p>
      <p>The piece adds that teenage striker Rhian Brewster is in a similar situation and that moves for the pair will depend on whether clubs can guarantee them first-team football. </p>
