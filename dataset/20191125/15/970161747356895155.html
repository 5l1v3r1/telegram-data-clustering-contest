      <h1>Bill Cosby gives interview from behind bars after conviction for sexual assault</h1>

      <p>Bill Cosby has said he will not show remorse after being jailed for three counts of aggravated indecent assault.</p>
      <p>The 82-year-old is <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/09/25/bill-cosby-81-sentenced-to-3-to-10-years-in-state-prison-and-deemed-sexually-violent-predator-7978524/">serving from three to 10 years in a Pennsylvania prison</a> for the sexual assault of Andrea Constand, and if he serves his full sentence, he will be 91 when he is released.</p>
      <p>But the comedian has said he will never admit wrongdoing to help him get parole, speaking in his first interview from behind bars.</p>
      <p>Via a series of 15 minute prison phone calls, Cosby told <a href="https://atlantadailyworld.com/2019/11/25/bill-cosbys-tell-all-exclusive-from-prison-listen-to-interview/">National Newspaper Publishers Association’s BlackPressUSA.com</a>: ‘I have eight years and nine months left. When I come up for parole, they’re not going to hear me say that I have remorse.</p>

      <p>The former The Cosby Show star then claimed that his trial was unjust, saying: ‘It’s all a set up. That whole jury thing. They were imposters.’</p>
      <p>Since his incarceration, the star has been a featured speaker on numerous occasions at the Mann Up Association reform programme in prison, which strives to ‘encourage and empower African American men to strive for self-respect and dignity’.</p>
      <p>Cosby referred to his cell <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/02/08/bill-cosby-moved-general-population-prison-unit-four-months-sentence-8481171/">in general population</a> as ‘the penthouse’, before adding: ‘I am a privileged man in prison.’</p>
      <p>At his sentencing in October 2018, Judge Steven T Judge O’Neill deemed it appropriate to classify Cosby as a sexually violent predator.</p>
      <p>Dozens of women have accused Cosby of sexual misconduct, with allegations spanning from 1965 to 2008.</p>
      <p>However, Constand’s allegations are the only ones that have resulted in criminal charges.</p>
