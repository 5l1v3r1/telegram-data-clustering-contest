      <p>German car maker <b>BMW</b> is expected to finally roll out <b>Apple Car Play across its entire range</b> and <b>scrap costly subscription fees</b> from next year – and introduce <b>Android Auto for the first time</b>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/bmw/">BMW</a> is the only car company to charge a hefty $479 over three years for the Apple Car Play smartphone mirroring technology – on models it is available – even though it’s standard on a $15,990 Kia Picanto.</p>

      <p>BMW says its Apple Car Play system is more costly to integrate into its iDrive infotainment network, even though other car brands with similarly complex systems such as <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/audi/">Audi</a>, <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/mercedes/">Mercedes</a> and <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/mazda/">Mazda</a> don’t charge extra for it.</p>
      <p>Speaking at the Australian media preview of the new <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/bmw/1series/">BMW 1 Series</a>, the boss of BMW Australia, Vikram Pawah said: “We always listen to our customers. What we heard until now was that only 50 per cent of people use Apple, it’s not everybody. We believe you should charge only people who are going to use it, not everyone.”</p>
      <p>When asked if BMW would ever make Apple Car Play and Android Auto freely available on any or all of its models, Mr Pawah said: “I would love to make all the options to be free, but it always depends on what the technology is for the future. Over time the cost of technology becomes affordable for everyone.”</p>
      <p>When pressed further on timing, Mr Pawah said: “There is nothing to share at the moment, hold on for a month. We will talk about it again after a month, but as for now this (car) is being launched with a one year subscription.”</p>

      <p>As with other recent BMWs, the new generation 1 Series hatch has Apple Car Play included in the first 12 months for free, but customers will be charged $479 for a three-year subscription at the end the first year. It is the only car company to do so.</p>
      <p>BMW says in addition to its infotainment being more complex, its Apple Car Play system has a more expensive wireless connection, which eliminates the need to connect smartphones via a USB port.</p>
      <p>Apple Car Play and Android Auto are almost universally standard on new cars these days. The smartphone mirroring tech aims to improve road safety by eliminating the need – and the temptation – for drivers to handle their phones while driving.</p>
      <p>It brings key functions from the phone to the car’s built-in infotainment screen and streamlines vice-activated functions.</p>
