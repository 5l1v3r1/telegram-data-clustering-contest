      <p>Marseille reclaimed second spot in Ligue 1 when they won 2-0 at 10-man Toulouse who cracked in the final 15 minutes.</p>
      <p>Earlier on Sunday, Bordeaux edged in-form Monaco 2-1 at home to briefly climb into third and Saint-Etienne drew 0-0 at home against Montpellier.</p>
      <p>In Toulouse, the home team were reduced to 10 men when right-back Steven Moreira drove his studs into Bouna Sarr’s knee and received a red card after a video review.</p>
      <p>Marseille dominated a scruffy match but struggled to break down Toulouse. The home team defended in-depth and even had a chance to take the lead in the 70th minute but goalkeeper Steve Mandanda saved Ibrahim Sangare’s header with his foot.</p>

      <p>Marseille responded with a decisive moment of inspiration in the 76th minute.</p>
      <p>Dimitri Payet drew defenders then threaded a clever reverse pass to the darting Dario Benedetto who danced past Baptiste Reynet and coolly slid the ball into the goal.</p>
      <p>Three minutes later, Toulouse presented Marseille with a second. Left-back Issiaga Sylla drove a clearance into Valere Germain. The ball bounced to Nemanja Radonjic, who advanced into the penalty area and curled a shot into the net.</p>
      <p>“We played a good game and the victory is deserved,” said Marseille coach Andre Villas-Boas.</p>
      <p>Toulouse “closed up the game after the red card,” said Villas-Boas. “Don’t forget Mandanda’s decisive save before we opened the scoring. We knew that the first goal would be very important.</p>
      <p>“We keep our second place and we have to keep going like this.”</p>
      <p>Marseille climbed to 25 points from 14 matches, eight behind leaders Paris Saint-Germain but one ahead of Angers. Bordeaux and Saint-Etienne are fourth and fifth on 22. Toulouse remain second from bottom.</p>
      <p>Depleted Bordeaux, already deprived of defenders Mexer and Vukasin Jovanovic who were both suspended, midfielder Youssef Ait Bennasser, who could not play because he is on-loan from Monaco, lost centre-back Laurent Koscielny to injury on Sunday morning and winger Jimmy Briand during the warm-up.</p>
      <p>Monaco, who had climbed away from the relegation zone with three victories in their previous four league games, took the lead against Bordeaux with a goal by Islam Slimani on 15 minutes.</p>
      <p>After that, even though the hosts’ fans fell silent in the first half as part of a protest against their owners, the visitors failed to exploit the makeshift home defence.</p>
      <p>Instead, Brazilian Pablo levelled with a powerful header from a corner after 29 minutes.</p>
      <p>In the 67th minute, Slimani handled while standing in the wall at a free kick, conceding a penalty and incurring his second yellow card.</p>
      <p>Nicolas de Preville converted the spot-kick to give Bordeaux victory.</p>
      <p>“There were a lot of players from the starting XI who were not here,” Bordeaux midfielder Aurelien Tchouameni said.</p>
      <p>“This shows the strength of character of our team. Some of them didn’t have much playing time this season. They stood up.”</p>
      <p>Later on Sunday, Saint-Etienne drew 0-0 at home against Montpellier as the sides managed just two shots on target.</p>
