      <h1>Huge new baby goods store to open in Nottingham on Black Friday</h1>
      <h2>Yes, there will be offers available for customers</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T15:21:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 15:21</time> by <a rel="author">Matthew Bunn</a></address>
      <p>A huge new baby goods store filled with prams, car seats and nursery furniture will open in Nottingham later this week.</p>
      <p>Offers and goodie bags are being promised to customers as Little Angels prepares to launch in the city on Black Friday, November 29.</p>
      <p>It will be located in a 5,000 sq ft site in Prospect Street, next to the <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-castle">Castle</a> Retail Park, and will become the company's second branch.</p>
      <p>It comes just weeks after national retailer Mothercare announced it was closing down, including its Nottingham branch.</p>
      <p>Kelly Carter, 31, who set up the company in <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/ilkeston">Ilkeston</a> five years ago, said: "I am super excited. We have been looking to move to Nottingham for the past two years. It is such a big area so we always aimed to move here."</p>
      <p>Little Angels will stock brands including iCandy and Silver Cross and there will be games and colouring books to keep children busy while parents are shopping.</p>
      <p>Mrs Carter believes the store could potentially boast the biggest range of pushchairs in the UK, with more than 80 expected to be on display.</p>
      <p>On the day of the opening, there will be offers on products in-store, while goodie bags will be on offer and representatives from suppliers will also be on hand to help.</p>
      <p>Ahead of the first day, she added: "It is a bit overwhelming because it is just me.</p>
      <p>"We are either going to sink or swim and we will soon find out. Every time you open a new business you take a massive chance and I have put my blood, sweat and tears into this, so I am really looking forward to it."</p>
      <p>The move comes at a difficult time on the high street, which has seen national retailer Mothercare announce it will close all its stores.</p>
      <p>The retailer has a branch at Nottingham's Castle Marina Retail Park.</p>
      <p>Mrs Carter said: “It’s so sad to see such a household name disappearing, and devastating for all the staff.</p>
      <p>"As an independent business, we aim to provide a professional and personal service for Nottinghamshire’s parents and parents-to-be.”</p>
      <p>The Ilkeston branch will remain open but is expected to become more of a factory retail outlet.</p>
      <p>Since opening five years ago, Little Angels has a most recent turnover figure of more than £2 million.</p>
