      <p>West Lothian College is offering a free course to help get more men involved in early learning and childcare careers.</p>
      <p>The Scottish Government is increasing the number of hours that children can access funded childcare by August 2020 and wants to diversify the workforce and recruit more men into careers in early years.</p>
      <p>There is no formal interview for the course and all applicants will be able to meet tutors to discuss career pathways before starting.</p>
      <p>Claire Glen, head of childhood practice, said: “We are delighted to be able to offer this course to men across West Lothian who may be considering a change of career as the early years workforce expansion continues.</p>
      <p>“There are many career opportunities and working with children and young people is very rewarding. Every day is different and every practitioner can make a difference. We would love to hear from any men who think they could be inspiration and a positive role model.”</p>
      <p>Former HNC childhood practice student, Matthew Clark said: “I know in the past childcare has been seen as women’s work but that didn’t put me off applying for the course. Once I decided that’s what I wanted to do I went for it and never looked back.</p>
      <p>“There’s absolutely no reason why men aren’t able to do this job just as effectively as women and I haven’t been treated any differently just because I am a guy.”</p>
      <p>Recent HNC graduate, Scott Farmer said: “I want to be a primary school teacher and for me HNC Childhood Practice seemed like a logical way to take my first steps toward that goal. The idea of being a positive influence and making a difference to someone’s life is so rewarding.”</p>
      <p>On successful completion of the course participants will be offered an interview for the HNC Childhood Practice.</p>
      <p>This is offered full time or part time in the evening to fit around employment commitments.</p>
      <p>Over the 12-week course participants will cover units on Child Development and Play.</p>
      <p>They will gain an insight into the development of children from birth. They will also learn about the importance of play on a child’s learning and development and how learning outdoors benefits children’s health and wellbeing.</p>
