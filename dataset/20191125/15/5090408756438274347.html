      <p>Selena Gomez has one more tattoo than she used to.</p>
      <p>The 27-year-old singer took to Instagram on Sunday to share some behind-the-scenes photos from the 2019 American Music Awards after opening the show with a performance of her two <a href="https://www.insider.com/every-number-one-song-billboard-chart-this-year-2019-11">newest songs, “Lose You to Love Me”</a> and “Look at Her Now.”</p>
      <p>Her post contained four Polaroid pictures that showed off details of the outfit she wore during the part of her performance dedicated to “Look at Her Now.”</p>
      <p>In one of the images, Gomez can be seen lifting her skirt and pointing to a new tattoo on her thigh. The tattoo appeared to be of a set of hands clasped together with a rosary wrapped around them. “AMAs day.. more to come..” Gomez captioned the post.</p>

      <p>A fan account shared the news, and reported that <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5Oitxzh7bl/?utm_source=ig_embed">this marks Gomez’s 14th tattoo</a> to date. The former “Wizards of Waverly Place” star recently <a href="https://www.insider.com/selena-gomez-julia-michaels-kissed-surprise-performance-video-2019-11">got a matching tattoo with Julia Michaels</a>. Earlier this month, the two singers <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a29783635/selena-gomez-julia-michaels-matching-tattoo-meaning/">each got an arrow on their hands</a>, that, when clasped together, point toward each other.</p>
      <p>During the AMAs, Gomez performed her two newest singles off her forthcoming second studio album, scheduled to be released on January 10, 2020.</p>
      <p>“This album is my diary from the past few years and I can’t wait for you to hear it,” Gomez wrote about the project <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5I0YUWjWj8/">on Instagram</a>, promising that the she’ll drop the album’s title, cover art, and track list “soon.”</p>
      <p>After she released “Lose You to Love Me” and <a href="https://www.insider.com/selena-gomez-look-at-her-now-lyrics-justin-bieber-reactions-2019-10">“Look at Her Now,”</a> fans immediately began speculating that the tracks were about the <a href="https://www.insider.com/selena-gomez-lose-you-to-love-me-lyrics-justin-bieber-video-2019-10">aftermath of her relationship with Justin Bieber</a>, which ended for good in March 2018.</p>
