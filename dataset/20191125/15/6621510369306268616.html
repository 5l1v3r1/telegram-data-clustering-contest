      <p><b>ISLAMABAD:</b> Prime Minister Imran Khan on Monday said that opposition parties were misleading the people on foreign funding case.</p>
      <p>Addressing a meeting of his spokespersons here, the premier said that the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) had submitted all relevant details to the Election Commission of Pakistan (PTI) and it will get a clean chit in the foreign funding case.</p>
      <p>The prime minister alleged that both the Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) and Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) raised funds through money laundering.</p>
      <p>Imran directed his spokespersons to update the masses about all the aspects of the foreign funding case.</p>
      <p>Talking about the opposition’s protest and APC, Imran said the people have rejected the opposition’s protest call.</p>
      <p>He said that the opposition has lost the people’s confidence and it will have to wait for four more years.</p>
      <p>Earlier on November 23, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Information and Broadcasting, Dr Firdous Ashiq Awan had said the opposition parties had become an example of political hypocrisy.</p>
      <p>Firdous, in a tweet, had lamented the opposition parties were hurling political threats to the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) under a new guise.</p>
