      <h1>Week 13 Fantasy TE Rankings: All eyes on possible Austin Hooper, Evan Engram returns</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T15:08:41+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 15:08</time> by <a rel="author">Billy Heyen</a></address>
      <p>There's not much better than seeing your starting tight end have a big game on Thanksgiving. Our Week 13 fantasy TE rankings aren't anything too out of the ordinary -- we've come to be used to the usual studs and busts. But can't you just picture a sleeper like Dawson Knox or Jason Witten eating a hefty, early Thanksgiving dinner and then heading on the field to dominate? Knox could do it, too, since the matchup with Dallas is so tight end friendly.</p>
      <p>Speaking of Thanksgiving tight ends -- there are a few TE injuries to watch in the coming week, and it starts with Austin Hooper (knee), whose Falcons play in the nightcap Thursday. His initial timeline suggests we'll still be waiting a bit longer to see him back on the field. Evan Engram (foot) could be closer to a return, and the Giants don't play until Sunday. In a friendly tight end matchup with Green Bay, an Engram absence would thrust either Rhett Ellison (if he's back from concussion) or Kaden Smith into a potential role as a DFS sleeper.</p>

      <p>For those of you just catching up on news as the holiday season starts to take over your lives: The Colts have placed Eric Ebron (ankle) on Injured Reserve. He can be dropped in all non-keeper formats. The absence of Ebron should mean an increase in red-zone targets for Jack Doyle, who becomes a top-20 tight end the rest of the way. In deeper leagues, Mo Alie-Cox moves in playbecause Indianapolis should continue to run a lot of its two-TE sets.</p>
      <p>The best part of Week 13, besides all the turkey and pie, is that bye weeks are over. Any of you who've relied on a star tight end all season can probably just do so the rest of the way. Those of you who need a streamer to sneak into the fantasy playoffs came to the right place.</p>

      </p>
      <p>For a totally unowned sleeper option, you could go with Jacksonville's Nick O'Leary against Tampa Bay, the second-worst defense against fantasy tight ends. David Njoku (wrist) might be back for the Browns. Ryan Griffin gets another good matchup, this time traveling to Cincinnati coming off another touchdown catch in Week 12. Dallas Goedert gets to face the Dolphins, and of course, there's also the aforementioned Knox. Enjoy your Thanksgiving, and we'll be rooting for you to make your fantasy playoffs.</p>

It's probably the worst miss Russell Wilson will have all season. Hollister remains a big piece of the Seattle offense. </td>
