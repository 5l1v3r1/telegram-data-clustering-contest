      <p>Nov. 25 (UPI) -- <i>Sex Education</i> Season 2 is coming to Netflix in January.</p>
      <p>The streaming service announced Monday on Twitter that the new season will be released Jan. 17.</p>
      <p>Netflix shared the news alongside a mural of Otis Milburn (Asa Butterfield), Jean Milburn (Gillian Anderson), Eric Effiong (Ncuti Gatwa), Maeve Wiley (Emma Mackey), Ola Nyman (Patricia Allison) and other characters.</p>
      <p>"Get in losers, the new term is starting. Sex Education s2 streaming 17 January 2020," the <a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixUK/status/1198947058583056384">post</a> reads.</p>
      <p>Netflix previously <a href="https://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/TV/2019/11/11/Sex-Education-Asa-Butterfield-Gillian-Anderson-return-in-Season-2-first-look/6021573493269/">shared first look photos</a> for Season 2 showing Otis and Eric on an excursion in the woods and Maeve and Aimee Gibbs (Aimee Lou Wood) in a police station.</p>
      <p>Season 2 will follow Otis as he navigates his relationships with his mom, Jean, his girlfriend, Ola, and friend and classmate Maeve.</p>
      <p>Anderson said in an <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/sex-education-season-2-gillian-anderson-video/">interview</a> with The Wrap published Friday that Otis and Jean's complicated relationship makes for "good comedy and good drama" in the new season.</p>
      <p>"When we start Season 2, we're pretty much starting where we left off," the actress said. "And I think she's still trying. They've made some headway together in terms of levels of communication. But, as with anything with parenting, you think you've taken a few steps forward and then you take a few steps back."</p>
      <p><i>Sex Education,</i> created by Laurie Nunn, had its Netflix debut in January.</p>
