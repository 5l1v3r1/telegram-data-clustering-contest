      <h1>Mitrovic, Brewster &amp; Bowen - every player linked with January transfer to Aston Villa</h1>
      <h2>Aston Villa transfer news | Speculation is starting to ramp up ahead of the re-opening of the transfer window in January</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T15:35:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 15:35</time> by <a rel="author">Ben Husband, https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/authors/ben-husband/, Richard Cusack</a></address>
      <p>January could be a crucial month for Aston Villa's hopes of surviving relegation back to the Championship.</p>
      <p>After 12 matches - and ahead of a crucial Premier League clash with Newcastle United on Monday night - <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/dean-smith">Dean Smith</a>'s side sit in 17th place in the table and three points ahead of Watford in the final relegation spot.</p>
      <p>The New Year represents a chance for Smith and <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa</a> to improve on their current squad and ship players out who are not needed. Although it's not expected to be as busy as the summer window, where 12 new players arrived.</p>

      <p>Nevertheless, a number of players have been touted with possible moves to Villa Park as speculation begins to ramp up ahead of the re-opening of the transfer window.</p>
      <p>Here's every player linked with a move to Villa...</p>
      <h4>Christian Luyindama</h4>
      <p>Villa have been lining up a January swoop for Galatasaray defender Christian Luyindama, according to reports in Turkey.</p>
      <p>But a potential move has gone out of the window after the centre-back suffered a serious injury on international duty which could rule him out for the rest of the season.</p>
      <p>According to Turkish publication Sabah <a href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/aston-villa-pull-plan-sign-e14m-target-board-unhappy-situation/">(via Sport Witness),</a><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa</a> were exploring a €14m (£12m) push for Luyindama when the window re-opens having first been linked in the summer.</p>
      <p>But the 25-year-old tore a cruciate ligament playing for DR Congo against the Gambia in an Africa Cup of Nations qualifier.</p>
      <h4>Rhian Brewster</h4>
      <p>Although it is understood that Villa don't plan to splash the cash to the same extent as in the summer, a loan move could be viable.</p>
      <p>According to our sister title the Mirror, Villa are keen to take the 19-year-old striker on loan.</p>

      <p>Dean Smith is among a host of Premier League and Championship managers said to be keeping tabs on Brewster.</p>
      <p>Villa fans will be able to get a close look at Brewster later this month with the forward expected to feature in a second string Reds side in the Carabao Cup quarter final at Villa Park.</p>
      <h4>Aleksandar Mitrovic</h4>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa</a> are scouring the market for a new forward to support Wesley Moraes as January draws nearer and Darren Bent thinks Mitrovic could be the answer.</p>
      <p>The 25-year-old has been in stunning form for Fulham this season, scoring 12 goals in 16 appearances in the Championship.</p>
      <p>He’s also enjoying an impressive run for Serbia, bagging 17 goals in his last 15 outings.</p>
      <p>Former Villa frontman Bent told talkSPORT: “Come January, Mitrovic might be gone. I can see a few Premier League teams (taking an interest), like Aston Villa whose centre forwards aren’t scoring many goals.</p>
      <p>“These teams should look at him because he’s too good for the Championship. He’s a big, strong powerful target man who scores goals when given the service.”</p>

      <h3>What reception should Steve Bruce get from the Villa Park faithful on Monday?</h3>
      <h4>500+ VOTES SO FAR</h4>
      <p>Applause Boo him to the rafters Ignore him completely - we're better off now</p>
      <h4>Emiliano Buendia</h4>
      <p>Sky Sports report the 22-year-old Norwich City forward has attracted the attention of Villa boss <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/dean-smith">Dean Smith</a> ahead of the January transfer window.</p>
      <p>Argentine Buendia has started all 12 of Norwich's matches in the Premier League so far this season, having played a key role in their promotion to the top flight as champions of the Championship last season.</p>
      <h4>Said Benrahma</h4>
      <p>Villa boss <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/dean-smith">Dean Smith</a> knows the Algerian winger very well, having signed him for Brentford from Nice when he was in charge at Griffin Park.</p>
      <p>Smith was eager to bring the 24-year-old to Villa Park during the summer, as he prepared his squad for a return to the Premier League, but the club failed to agree a deal with the Bees, who are said to value him at £20m.</p>

        <img src="https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/incoming/article16715116.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_GettyImages-1125896850.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Sky Sports suggest Smith could make a fresh bid for Benrahma, who has scored 12 goals in 51 Championship matches for Brentford, when the January transfer window opens for business, although the price tag might once again prove a stumbling block.</p>
      <h4>Nico Gaitan</h4>
      <p>Reports in The Guardian on Thursday claimed the Argentina international is on the radar of Villa and Premier League rivals West Ham United and Sheffield United.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>It <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/nicolas-gaitan-aston-villa-transfer-17293882">is said the Hammers hierarchy have held preliminary talks</a> with Gaitan's representatives about a move, with the 31-year-old most recently of MLS side Chicago Fire.</p>
      <p>He will be a free agent when his contract is up in December and there is an option to stay with Chicago for the 2020 season.</p>
      <h4>Christoph Monschein</h4>
      <p>Reports on the continent suggested the Austria international <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/aston-villa-monitoring-international-striker-17294200">could be in line for a move to Villa</a> for a cut-price €5 million fee.</p>
      <p>He has scored 13 goals in 18 games this season for Austria Wien - and it is claimed that Dean Smith's side have sent scouts to watch him in action.</p>
      <h4>Alfredo Morelos</h4>
      <p>Morelos has been heavily linked with a move to Villa, his impressive performances north of the border highlighting a goal threat that Villa currently lack up front.</p>
      <p>Rangers are desperate to keep hold of him, though, with boss Steven Gerrard and recruitment chief Ross Wilson issuing a firm 'not for sale' warning.</p>
      <h4>Glen Kamara</h4>
      <p>Villa are one of a number of clubs linked with the Finnish international. After arriving at Ibrox in January for £50k, the midfielder has flourished under Gerrard's leadership and they are expecting a major profit on their investment.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Along with Villa - Brighton, Burnley, Crystal Palace and Leeds United have all been credited with an interest.</p>
      <h4>Jarrod Bowen</h4>
      <p>A transfer rumour that could only happen in the 21st century.</p>
      <p>The Hull City forward got tongues wagging, when he followed the club on Instagram last week.</p>
      <p>The Leominster-born 22-year-old has been linked with big-money moves to Tottenham Hotspur, Newcastle United and Southampton.</p>

      <h4>Omar Elabdellaoui</h4>
      <p>Reports in the Daily Mail state that <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/aston-villa-omar-elabdellaoui-transfer-17082421">Villa are among a number of clubs chasing the Olympiacos defender,</a> along with Leicester City, Watford, Bournemouth and Burnley.</p>
      <p>Elabdellaoui's contract with the Greek top flight side is running out in the summer and the 27-year-old will be a free agent when it expires.</p>
      <p>As things stand, the Norway international can sign a pre-contract agreement at the turn of the year with an English side.</p>
      <p>Elabdellaoui left Manchester City to join Olympiacos in 2014 without making a single appearance for the current Premier League champions in a five-year stay.</p>
      <h4>Sam McCallum</h4>
      <p>The young full-back has impressed for Coventry City this season and has admitted to being 'flattered' by speculation linking him with a move out of League One.</p>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>(Image: TIM EASTHOPE/BIRMINGHAM MAIL)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Villa, Leeds United and West Bromwich Albion are all rumoured to be interested in the 19-year-old.</p>
      <h4>Eric Dier</h4>
      <p>Dier has been linked with Villa after Smith's side were placed among the favourites to sign him by the bookies.</p>
      <p>The midfielder has struggled for minutes at Tottenham this season, making just three Premier League appearances so far.</p>
      <p>Amid suggestions he could be made available for transfer, former Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino told <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/09/23/eric-dier-set-first-spurs-appearance-season-dele-alli-nears/">the Telegraph</a> in September: "It has been difficult [for Dier]. Of course it is tough for him.</p>
      <p>“He has to wait through training and then of course he has the opportunity. He has to try to fight for his place.</p>
      <p>“We have a big squad, I need to take the decision performance by performance. The plan is the plan. We are going to assess the player and then make the decision.”</p>
      <p>Manchester United are said to be Dier's most likely destination, followed by Everton, with Villa rated as third favourites to sign him.</p>
      <h4>Ben Chrisen</h4>
      <p>Chrisen is one for the future.</p>
      <p>The 15-year-old midfielder, currently with Exeter City, <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/aston-villa-transfer-news-club-17194865">is also said to be wanted by Chelsea</a> , Liverpool and Bayern Munich.</p>
      <h4>Dennis Politic</h4>
      <p>Villa have been keen to sign young players with the potential to grow and <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/aston-villa-scouting-one-time-17050985">19-year-old Politic is on the radar according to Football Insider.</a></p>
      <p>The former Manchester United academy talent has been catching the eye in League One this term for troubled Bolton, who are rooted to the bottom of the table.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The Trotters signed nine new players after their ownership crisis with the Romanian among the very few to have kept a place in the starting XI.</p>
      <p>He has previously represented Romania at under-17 level and spent six years at United before joining Bolton's under-15s.</p>
      <p>Politic has two goals to his name so far this campaign having played on both wings.</p>
      <h4>Olivier Giroud</h4>
      <p>Not a player linked with Villa necessarily, but the claret and blue faithful want to bring the Chelsea striker to Villa Park <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/aston-villa-transfer-news-giroud-17254658">after hearing he will be available for a cut-price fee of £6m</a>.</p>
      <p>He would certainly be a good back-up to Wesley and bolster the forward department, but a move to Inter Milan and a reunion with former Chelsea coach Antonio Conte looks most likely.</p>

      <h3>RUMOURED DEPARTURES</h3>
      <h4>John McGinn</h4>
      <p>McGinn's excellent early-season form saw calls for Manchester United and Liverpool to sign the Scotland international.</p>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>John McGinn of Scotland celebrates after scoring (Image: Getty Images)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>He has taken to the Premier League well, scoring three goals in 12 games including Villa's first back in the Premier League in the 3-1 defeat to Tottenham Hotspur.</p>
      <h4>Jack Grealish</h4>
      <p>All the talk about Grealish now is whether he will be able to shake off a calf injury in time for the Newcastle United match on November 25.</p>
      <p>He was in fine form until he suffered the injury against Manchester City in October.</p>
      <h4>Jonathan Kodjia</h4>
      <p>Besiktas have been linked with a move for the out-of-favour striker.</p>
      <p>The forward has seen his game-time limited upon Villa's return to the Premier League, the 30-year-old playing just 20 minutes of League football this season.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/incoming/article17122857.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_GettyImages-1177456911.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>He's spent most of 2019-20 out injured with a cheekbone problem, but he returned to full fitness last month and managed just four minutes in two games.</p>
      <h4>Lovre Kalinic</h4>
      <p>Smith has been given the green light to sell Lovre Kalinic this summer, according to reports.</p>
      <p>It is less than a year since the Croatia international made the move to B6, but he has endured a nightmare spell at Villa Park, with both parties now willing to cut their losses.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.footballinsider247.com/smith-gives-green-light-for-aston-villa-to-sell-his-signing/">Football Insider</a> have reported that Smith is planning to shift the 29-year-old, who Villa signed for £7m last January.</p>
      <h4>WHEN DOES THE TRANSFER WINDOW OPEN?</h4>
      <p>The window opens again on Wednesday, January 1 2020.</p>
      <h4>WHAT IS VILLA'S RECORD TRANSFER FEE PAID?</h4>
      <p>This is a bone of contention because of the way transfers are structured with add-ons and the like. In terms of an up-front payment, Wesley's move from Club Brugge is the current record fee paid by Villa at £22m.</p>
      <h4>WHAT IS VILLA'S RECORD TRANSFER FEE RECEIVED?</h4>
      <p>The reported £32.5m that Liverpool paid for Christian Benteke is by far and away the most the claret and blues have received for a player.</p>
