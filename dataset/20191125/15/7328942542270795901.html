      <p>Everyone has a special sport that they enjoy, both doing and watching. And if it's archery for you, then you'll like this video a lot. </p>
      <p>If you're an archer, or you like archery, you must be familiar with the difficulty of taking arrows out from the quiver every time you shoot an arrow. It actually can be pretty time-consuming or motivation-killing, and something to blame when you shoot the arrow poorly.</p>
      <p>So, here's a great innovation for you which will make your archery process much easier and enjoyable. This guy created a bow, and you don't have to carry a quiver with you anymore.</p>
      <p>Also, pulling a bow can also be a difficult process, especially for beginners. This new bow that the guy created has a different mechanism; it has a handle that you can pull, and it makes the whole archery thing more fun and easier.</p>
      <p>So if you enjoy this old sport or you're a big Legolas fan, watch this video to see a modern bow.</p>
