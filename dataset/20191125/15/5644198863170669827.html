      <p>LONDON: Britain's Just Eat advised shareholders not to accept a 710 pence-a-share cash offer from Prosus , saying it was inferior to its agreed deal with Takeaway.com to create the largest food delivery player outside China.</p>
      <p>"Your Board believes that the Takeaway.com combination provides Just Eat shareholders with greater value creation than the Prosus offer," it said in a letter to investors on Monday, adding that the Prosus offer also significantly undervalued Just Eat on a standalone basis.</p>
