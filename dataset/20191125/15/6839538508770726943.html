      <p>Economy is still the number one concern among Australians but climate change worries have climbed ten per cent in the past year.</p>
      <p>Researchers for the latest Mapping Social Cohesion Report asked Australians to name their biggest concern off the top of their heads, with 19 per cent saying climate change.</p>
      <p>This has jumped up from 10 per cent last year, with the economy still being our number one concern in 2019.</p>
      <p>Professor Andrew Markus said when they first started asking people about their concerns in 2011, climate change hovered around six per cent.</p>

      <p>In 2019 the economy was the number one concern at 28 per cent, followed by climate change at 19, then social issues at eight per cent.</p>
      <p>“The only other time where we’ve seen such a big jump was in 2015,” Professor Markus said.</p>
      <p>That year the country watched the Lindt Cafe siege, on top of the news of more Australians joining ISIS in the Middle East.</p>
      <p>“In that year concern about terrorism and security went from one to 10,” Professor Markus said.</p>
      <p>“So this time we’ve gone from 10 to 19 (on climate) in one year. So I think that’s quite significant.” Climate concerns were the highest in young adults, with 43 per cent of 18 to 24 year olds naming it as their number one issue.</p>
      <p>But it was lowest among 35 to 44 year olds and over-75s at 12 per cent and eight per cent respectively.</p>

      <p>The survey of more than 3500 Australians was taken shortly after the federal election in May, with Professor Markus pointing to the heightened debate of environmental issues.</p>
      <p>It also found while the majority of Australians felt immigration was a good thing for economy, views on intake or the impacts on infrastructure were negative.</p>
      <p>But the majority of Australians would reject a return to the racist White Australia policy.</p>
      <p>Professor Markus also pointed to a growing “social desirability bias”, with huge differences in the types of answers given on immigration between respondents over the phone and online.</p>
      <p>Australians’ trust in the federal government’s ability to do the right thing by people has remained flat, having hovered around 30 per cent since 2017.</p>
      <p>“The level of trust is at a low level but it has not gone down further,” Professor Markus said.</p>
