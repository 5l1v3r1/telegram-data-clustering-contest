      <p>Huawei detailed plans to launch a 5G tablet in early 2020, as it vies to be among the first vendors to put a unit compatible with the next-generation technology on sale, <i>Global Times</i> reported.</p>
      <p>During a launch event for its MatePad Pro, Yu Chengdong, CEO of Huawei’s consumer business, said it planned a 5G version of the model which would be released in the first quarter of 2020. The move pitches the vendor into competition with big-name rival Samsung, in particular, which <i>GSMArena</i> noted is developing a 5G edition of its tablet Galaxy Tab S6.</p>
      <p>Analyst Xiang Ligang told <i>Global Times</i> Huawei’s pace of research and development is faster than Samsung’s, and tipped the Chinese vendor to be ready to release a 5G tablet in January.</p>
      <p>The MatePad Pro uses Huawei’s latest flagship chipset, Kirin 990, which is also expected to be included in the 5G version. The model also features a 10.8-inch screen, dual rear cameras, and offers content synchronisation between Huawei devices.</p>
      <p>Huawei plans to initially sell the device in China from 12 December, with prices starting at CNY3,299 ($469).</p>
      <p>Yu added Huawei led the Chinese tablet market in Q3 2019 with a market share of 37.4 per cent and 2.1 million units shipped.</p>
      <p>Restrictions on Huawei imposed by the US appeared to contribute to a broader <a href="https://www.mobileworldlive.com/devices/news-devices/huawei-woes-add-to-android-tablet-shipment-drop/">decline in tablet shipments</a> during Q3 due to an associated impact on Android-powered models, Strategy Analytics figures showed.</p>
