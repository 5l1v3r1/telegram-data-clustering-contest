      <p>It's not always easy to keep up with the relationship statuses of famous couples - one day they're in love, the next they are over and dating other people.</p>
      <p>Justin Timberlake was recently snapped holding hands with Alisha Wainwright, his co-star in upcoming film Palmer, without his wedding ring on his finger.</p>
      <p>Rumours started going around that Justin and his wife, Jessica Biel, have separated despite them looking happy and in love recently.</p>
      <p>They've both still got photos of each other on their social media accounts; one of the first signs that something's up in Tinseltown is when they get removed.</p>

      <p>According to Metro, Justin and Alisha were seen having a cosy time as they drank and had fun with a group of other people. Alisha was apparently seen with her hand on Justin's thigh at one point.</p>
      <p><b>Legit.ng </b>gathered that Justin and Jessica have been married since 2012 and have a son together.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, <b>Legit.ng</b> earlier reported that though Tristan Thompson knows he messed up, <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1276035-tristan-thompson-khloe-kardashian-s-love.html">he is still very much in love with Khloé Kardashian</a>.</p>
      <p>The Canadian professional basketball player was caught cheating on Khloé with her sister, Kylie Jenner's bestie.</p>

      <p>It was after that encounter that Khloé decided enough was enough. It should be noted that it would not be the first time Tristan was unfaithful.</p>
      <p>But the sportsman has not given up and is constantly sending an uninterested Khloé gifts and complimenting her.</p>
