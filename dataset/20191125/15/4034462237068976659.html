      <h1>We Finally Know When The Mercedes-AMG One Will Arrive</h1>
      <h2>After numerous delays, AMG's F1-inspired hypercar is finally coming.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T15:00:32+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 15:00</time> by <a rel="author">Jared Rosenholtz</a></address>
      <p>Mercedes-AMG revealed its upcoming hypercar, the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/mercedes-benz/amg-one">AMG One</a>, way back in 2017. The car only <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/mercedes-amg-officially-renames-project-one-hypercar">received an official name</a> (previously called the Project One) in late 2018 but over one year later, it has yet to reach customers' hands. Mercedes has <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/what-s-wrong-with-the-mercedes-amg-one">reportedly had issues certifying</a> the One's 1.6-liter F1-inspired V6 engine for emissions while also maintaining its incredible 671 horsepower output. The car also features four electric motors, boosting the total output to over 1,000 hp.</p>
      <p>While customers wait to receive their cars, some have even<a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/mercedes-amg-must-act-fast-and-stop-this-nonsense"> attempted to flip their build slot</a> for the $2.7 million hypercar for as much as $4 million. Perhaps some of the AMG One's wealthy buyers have grown tired of waiting for the car but <a href="https://www.roadandtrack.com/new-cars/future-cars/a29877916/mercedes-amg-one-hypercar-deliveries-2021/">according to Road &amp; Track</a>, Mercedes has finally announced a delivery time.</p>

      <p>Speaking with Michael Knöller, AMG's global head of product management and sales, at the 2019 Los Angeles Auto Show, R&amp;T was told, "When you make F1 technology street legal you have to go through a journey with the customers. We had some challenges, but now we've reached a tipping point." Mercedes struggled to bring the engine's idle rpm down from 5,000 to just 1,200 in order to meet WLTP emissions standards. Meeting European sound regulation has also proven to be difficult because this is a racing engine after all.</p>

      <p>Knöller says these issues are finally starting to be resolved and that deliveries are set to begin in 2021. Only 275 examples will be built globally and as you'd expect, they are all sold out. The AMG One is also expected to be a one-and-done from Mercedes, meaning there likely won't be an AMG Two any time soon. Just like the Ferrari LaFerrari, McLaren P1, and Porsche 918 Spyder, the AMG One is expected to appear in a trio of next-generation hypercars including the Aston <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/aston-martin/valkyrie">Martin Valkyrie</a> and <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/lotus/evija">Lotus Evija</a>.</p>
