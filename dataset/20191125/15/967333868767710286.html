      <p>The Polish monument restoration organisation 'Commonwealth of Kursk' is leading an effort to achieve the reconstruction of a demolished memorial to 56 Red Army soldiers at a mass burial ground in the city of Trzcianka in the country's West.</p>
      <p>The chairman of the organisation Jerzy Tyc <a href="https://sputniknews.com/analysis/201911101077273359-comrades-in-arms-book-tells-untold-story-of-unlikely-wwii-alliance-between-stalin-and-churchill/">is helping the descendants of the fallen soldiers</a> to contest the decision of the local authorities to tear down the historical monument in court. 'Commonwealth of Kursk' is citing violations of post-war agreements obliging Poland and Russia to preserve the graves of allied soldiers.</p>
      <p>In September 2017, the authorities of Trzcianka ruled to demolish the mausoleum and greenlighted the construction of a public garden in this spot, claiming that the territory of the memorial was not a mass grave. The city officials did not present any evidence to support the allegation. However, the 'Commonwealth of Kursk' conducted a private independent examination that confirmed that the memorial was indeed a burial ground.</p>
