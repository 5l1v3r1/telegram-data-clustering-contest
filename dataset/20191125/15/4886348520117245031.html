      <ul>
        <li>Research from Crescat Capital suggests now is the ideal time to buy gold.</li>
        <li>The critical 70% inversion threshold has preceded all six of the last recessions.</li>
        <li>Bitcoin has outperformed gold in every respect over the last ten years, although there is no data relating to recessions.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>According to an in-depth analysis from Otavio Costa at Crescat Capital, now is the time to start accumulating gold.</p>
      <p>Costa, a portfolio manager at the firm, observes that when average Treasury yield curve spreads exceed a critical 70% threshold, <a href="https://www.crescat.net/the-impending-end-of-a-mania/">gold will outperform stocks over the ensuing two years</a>.</p>

      <p>The dreaded inverted yield curve reared its ugly head in August. And historically speaking, the leading indicator almost always reveals that a <a href="https://www.ccn.com/u-s-yield-curve-devastating-recession-unavoidable/">devastating recession is just around the corner</a>.</p>
      <p>Market tops are obviously incredibly difficult to time. But Costa shows that buying gold based on its ratio to the S&amp;P 500 immediately after a yield curve inversion will net you somewhere in the region of 100% profit.</p>
      <h3>Recession – It’s Not a Matter of if But When</h3>
      <p>The current state of global economic troubles did not get its ‘Everything Bubble’ title for nothing. As Costa explains:</p>
      <blockquote>There is a laundry list of dangerous assets bubbles in the global financial markets today that have built up over a record long US economic expansion</blockquote>
      <p>Costa rattles off an exhaustive list of macro imbalances that would make any investor run for the hills. From a purely U.S. perspective, that key 70% level has preceded each of the last six recessions, without fail.</p>

      <p>Of course, as mentioned previously, precisely timing such a shift from stocks to gold is either pure genius or sheer dumb luck.</p>
      <p>Credit Suisse, for example, contends that <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/13/after-yield-curve-inverts-stocks-typically-have-18-months-before-doom.html">18 months is the actual sweet spot before stocks rollover</a>. Their calculation, however, only appears to take into account the 2-10 curve.</p>
      <p>Crescat’s analysis, on the other hand, calculated the average of all 44 yield curve spreads. And in all but one of the subsequent recessions, there was a stock market decline, three of which cratered by almost 50%.</p>
      <h3>Bitcoin Still a Massive Asymmetric Buying Opportunity</h3>
      <p>But what about bitcoin? Well, like most global macro asset management firms, the big boys are still reluctant to make any significant allocation into crypto.</p>
      <p>As a result, Costa advocates that investors allocate not more than one to two percent of their portfolio to bitcoin.</p>
      <blockquote>Bitcoin is limited in supply like precious metals and in that sense could be a valuable call option on inflation.</blockquote>
      <p>Unfortunately, its short lifespan means there is no conclusive ratio we can call upon in the wake of an inversion.</p>
      <p>Some have also argued that crypto is practically uncorrelated to traditional markets. Unless you call <a href="https://www.ccn.com/avocado-bitcoin-price-correlation/">avocado price correlation</a> a thing.</p>
      <p>Despite a centuries-long fascination with gold, bitcoin still provides a massive asymmetric buying opportunity because of its potential parabolic returns.</p>
      <p>In a mere ten years, the safest blockchain on the planet has already commanded a 4.5x premium on the yellow metal.</p>

      <p>In the short-term, though, the flagship cryptocurrency continues to bleed out thanks to a recent <a href="https://www.ccn.com/sub-7000-bitcoin-price-bloodbath-could-spiral-4000-warns-analyst/">sub $7,000 plunge</a>.</p>
      <p>That should nevertheless be good news to <a href="https://www.ccn.com/bitcoin-price-will-rip-to-50000-but-only-after-a-nauseating-purge/">more sophisticated investors just waiting for the market to purge weak bulls on its way to $50,000</a>.</p>
