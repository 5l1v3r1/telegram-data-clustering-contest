      <h1>Mark Hunt says he ‘sure as hell won’t be the last’ fighter to sue the UFC after having lawsuit dismissed</h1>

      <p>While the class action lawsuit brought against the UFC for their alleged monopsony control of the MMA landscape looks to be nowhere near ending, one notable legal battle facing the promotion seems to be over. ZUFFA LLC has successfully had the lawsuit brought against them by former heavyweight top contender Mark Hunt dismissed. Sports economist and former Bloody Elbow contributor <a href="https://twitter.com/MMAanalytics/status/1198047019241103362">Paul Gift tweeted out the Nevada District Court’s ruling</a> on Friday, November 22nd.</p>

      <p>In the original lawsuit, the ‘Super Samoan’ claimed that the UFC had conspired with Lesnar, to keep his PED use under wraps until after his UFC 200 bout against Hunt. That assertion largely centered around the fact that the UFC granted Lesnar an exemption from the otherwise required four-month drug testing window, ahead of his return to competition on the 2016 fight card. After defeating Hunt, USADA reported that Lesnar had failed drug tests leading up to, and on the day of the fight. Lesnar’s victory was later overturned to a ‘no contest.’</p>
      <p>Not about to head quietly into legal defeat, Hunt posted the court ruling on Saturday – to his Instagram account – along with a pointed message for the UFC.</p>
      <blockquote>“I tried to make things even on the battlefield of Mma,” Hunt wrote, “but again the cheating company <a href="https://www.instagram.com/danawhite/">@danawhite</a> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ufc/">@ufc</a> with all its billions they ripped everyone off win again someone will die against a steroid using cheater and your shit rip off company will be at fault <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ufc/">@ufc</a> I hope all u fuckers burn filthy dog cunnnniesss u can go and get fuuuuuaaaaaarrrkkkkeddd Uwonthisbattlebutthewarwillcontinue <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/aliactmotherfuckers/">#aliactmotherfuckers</a> I am not the first to sue this rip off company and sure as hell wont be the last to sue the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ufc/">@ufc</a> u can’t keep ripping fighters off and run monopoly on the market someone’s going to put u motherfuckers down <a href="https://www.instagram.com/danawhite/">@danawhite</a> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ufc/">@ufc”</a></blockquote>

      <p>The New Zealand born former K-1 Grand Prix champion last fought in December of 2018, dropping a unanimous decision to Justin Willis in Adelaide, Australia. The bout was reportedly the last on his UFC contract. While Hunt has been rumored in connection to several fighting promotions over the last year, no definite return to competition has been reported.</p>
