      <h1>Taylor Swift's AMAs Performance Had Subtle Shade Towards Big Machine Records</h1>

      <h3>LIVING for this outfit choice</h3>
      <p>Taylor Swift was able to perform pre-<i><a href="https://nylon.com/horniest-lyrics-taylor-swift-lover">Lover</a> </i>era music after all at the 2019 American Music Awards on Sunday, and she definitely made the occasion count. The recipient of the inaugural Artist of the Decade award performed a medley of her biggest hits, despite worries earlier this month that <a href="https://nylon.com/taylor-swift-amas-scooter-scott">Big Machine Records</a> would put a stop to her plans. The pop star was joined by supporters, friends, and a large squad of dancers to cap off her 2010s reign, and it was major.</p>

      <p>Swift started out her performance center stage with <i>Lover </i>hit "The Man", joined by a crew of young girls in matching white button-down shirts to dance alongside her to the feminist anthem. Her costume was an obvious nod to the drama she's still currently entangled in with Big Machine Records: Swift's shirt bore the titles of her six albums released with BMR — the six albums she is fighting to own the masters of — from her self-titled debut to <i>1989. </i>The fact that the track's subject matter parallels her current public battle for her masters made the performance even more satisfying.</p>
      <p>Later in the medley, Swift was joined onstage by Halsey and Camila Cabello for <i>1989 </i>single "Shake It Off". Of course, she tossed aside the boxy white shirt to show off a glittery gold bodysuit for the rest of her show-stopping performance. Watch clips from the medley below.</p>
