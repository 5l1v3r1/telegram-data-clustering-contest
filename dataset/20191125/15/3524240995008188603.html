      <p>He said that the offences contravened Sections 269, 276 and 411 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015 (revised).</p>
      <p>The Chief Magistrate, Mrs B. O. Osunsanmi, admitted the defendants to bail in the sum of N200,000 each with two sureties in like sum.</p>
      <p>She ordered that the sureties must be gainfully employed and have evidence of two years’ tax payment to the Lagos State Government.</p>
