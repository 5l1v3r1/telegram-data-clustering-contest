      <p>Every year, two turkeys are selected to receive a presidential pardon in one of America's most bizarre holiday traditions. As a result, they avoid a trip to the slaughterhouse and are sent, instead, to live out their lives in the country.</p>
      <p>On the surface, it all sounds heartwarming, but the reality is quite different.</p>
      <p>The chosen birds tend to die prematurely despite their plush new surroundings, due to being bred for their ability to gain muscle mass quickly, rather than for long-term good health.</p>
      <p>In 2010 and 2012, for example, both pardoned turkeys died within 12 months.</p>
      <p>Dean Norton, who is in charge of livestock at Mount Vernon, where until recently the turkeys were sent, told CNN: "The bird is bred for the table, not for longevity... Some of the pardoned turkeys have been pretty short lived."</p>
      <p>The National Turkey Federation has previously said: "They're not pets. They're not workhorses. They don't live that long."</p>
      <p>The tradition goes back to 1947, when President Harry Truman "pardoned" the first holiday bird. For a few years, the turkeys were sent to a farm called Frying Pan Farm Park, then it switched to Walt Disney World and Disneyland, where they would appear in parades and be gawped at by tourists.</p>
      <p>Mount Vernon, the former plantation home of George Washington, was used for a time, before Morven Park in Virginia was finally chosen.</p>
      <p>In the run-up to Thanksgiving, the two birds are chosen based on appearance and temperament, then sent to a hotel near the White House for media events leading up to the event. One of them is chosen for the Rose Garden ceremony, while the other sits in reserve.</p>
      <p>At their new home, the turkeys will be cared for by veterinarians and students of Virginia Tech’s Animal and Poultry Sciences Department.</p>
      <p>This year's pardoned turkeys will join last year's animals, Peas and Carrots.</p>
