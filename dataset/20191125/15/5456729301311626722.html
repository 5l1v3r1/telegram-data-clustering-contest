      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T15:30:58+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 15:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/more-news/365144-buhari-demands-urgent-rehabilitation-of-idps.html" target="_blank">Press Release</a></address>
      <p>The rehabilitation of internally displaced persons (IDPs) in the country is urgent and imperative, if it would not constitute a big problem for the country in future, President Muhammadu Buhari has said.</p>
      <p>The president spoke Monday at the State House, Abuja, while receiving in audience the President of the 74th United Nations General Assembly, Nigeria’s Professor Tijjani Muhammad-Bande.</p>
      <p>“Most of the displaced children do not know their parents, or where they come from. We have to look at the issue now, properly rehabilitate them, otherwise, we will have a problem on our hands in the future,” President Buhari said.</p>
      <p>He urged the UN General Assembly President to make Nigeria’s challenges glaring to the world, while commending him for what he calls “your hard work and competence” so far.</p>

      <p>President Buhari said Nigeria was committed to education, and providing health care to the young and old, among other welfarist policies.</p>
      <p>Mr Muhammad-Bande said he was at the State House to express appreciation to President Buhari for the support given, leading to his emergence as <a href="https://www.un.org/en/ga/">UNGA</a> President, and the continued cooperation from Nigeria.</p>
      <p>“Everything I have requested for, in terms of personnel and funds, has been delivered. I thank President Buhari very much. I also thank other member states for the support I am getting,” he said.</p>
      <p>Mr Muhammad-Bande also appreciated Nigeria for rebuilding the UN building in Abuja destroyed by Boko Haram.</p>
