      <p>The Chairman, Northern Governors’ Forum and the Governor of Plateau State, Simon Bako Lalong, has stated the need for the government to come out with practical and effective ways on how to tackle insecurity manifesting in insurgency, banditry, kidnapping,</p>
      <p>farmer-herder clashes, ethno-religious crises and other violent conflicts.</p>
      <p>Lalong made this call when he addressed stakeholders during the Third Federal Government and the All Progressives Governors Forum Parley on Policy Synergy.</p>
      <p>The forum, with the theme: “Stregthening Public Service Delivery,” holding in Jos, the Plateau State capital, had Governor Lalong stating that it is their desire to work with the Federal Government and indeed the Local Government system to ensure the protection of lives and property of citizens.</p>
      <p>He said: “This parley should also enable us to discuss what we are doing in our States about Primary Health Care, Health Insurance, Social Protection for the vulnerable and ensuring that there is quality and compulsory education for our citizens.</p>
      <p>“It is also expected that this parley should provide more insight on how we have fared so far in our synergy with the Federal Government through the Universal Basic Education, National Social Investment Programme, Humanitarian Crises Management and the National Primary Healthcare Strategy among other programmes that the APC-led Federal Government has rolled out.</p>
