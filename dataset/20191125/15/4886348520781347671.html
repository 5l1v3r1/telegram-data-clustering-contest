      <ul>
        <li>The stock market reaction to every piece of U.S.-China trade deal news is ludicrous.</li>
        <li>Phase one of the trade deal does nothing to address the underlying issues of the trade war.</li>
        <li>Even more significant obstacles than those that started the trade war are on the horizon.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Talk of a U.S.-China trade deal has sent the markets into a land of panic and exaltation. The on-again, off-again nature of the trade deal has the market caught in a yo-yo where the slightest hint of good news sends stocks surging, and any mention of lousy news ignites a panic.</p>

      <p>As CCN’s Sam Bourgi <a href="https://www.ccn.com/us-china-trade-war-new-normal-global-equities/">has reported previously</a>,</p>
      <blockquote>Stocks have rallied under the assumption that a trade deal is coming.</blockquote>
      <p>This latest stock rally comes just a day after the <a href="https://www.ccn.com/dow-dives-as-impeachment-drama-compounds-trump-china-deadlock/">Dow Jones fell more than 150 points</a> on Wednesday after the U.S. Senate approved a pro-Hong Kong bill.</p>
      <p>Loads of people are getting rich in the short term off this constant yo-yo, “buy the rumor, sell the news,” but in no way does this tit for tat trade war between lend itself to long-term stability.</p>
      <h3>Underlying U.S.-China Trade Deal Issues</h3>
      <p>The biggest problem with the current trade deal speculation is that it does nothing to address the underlying issues that sparked the trade war in the first place. Stephen Roach, a senior lecturer at Yale University’s Jackson Institute, has <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/22/us-china-phase-one-trade-deal-hollow-and-ridiculous-yale-academic.html?&amp;qsearchterm=yale%20academic">echoed this sentiment</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>(The deal) is a ridiculous effort to fix a trade problem, and it doesn’t address any of the structural issues that the US was so adamant about in launching the tariffs over a year-and-a-half ago.</blockquote>
      <p>One of the more important underlying issues perpetuating the trade war is the Chinese theft of intellectual property.</p>

      <p>Keith B. Alexander, former director of the National Security Agency, <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2012/07/09/nsa-chief-cybercrime-constitutes-the-greatest-transfer-of-wealth-in-history/">has said</a> it is:</p>
      <blockquote>The greatest transfer of wealth in history.</blockquote>
      <p>Lips have been tight regarding the exact details for the trade deal’s first phase, but all signs point to it not addressing the intellectual property crisis.</p>
      <p>Conventional thought assumes phase one of the trade deal is primarily a farce designed to prop up the stock market. It would also give Trump a much needed political win before the contentious <a href="https://www.ccn.com/trump-stock-market-blunder-could-cost-2020-election/">2020 U.S. presidential elections</a>.</p>
      <p>Roach has also noted this, saying:</p>
      <blockquote>It’s politically expedient, especially for the U.S. President, who’s feeling a lot of political pressures for other reasons at home.</blockquote>
      <h3>More Significant Obstacles Ahead</h3>

      <p>Besides phase one of the trade deal failing to address the most critical issues, other concerns are soon to present even more significant obstacles.</p>
      <p>A recent <a href="https://www.ccn.com/dow-trade-deal-hopes-disintegrate-after-horrific-china-report/">New York Times article revealed</a> China’s barbarous treatment of its Muslim minority population. Furthermore, regarding the <a href="https://www.ccn.com/hong-kong-bill-could-be-nail-in-coffin-for-us-china-trade-deal/">Hong Kong bill</a> mentioned at the beginning of the article, there is not a single known universe where this bill does not massively enrage the Chinese. Whether it derails phase one of the trade deal, if not U.S.-Chinese relations entirely, remains to be seen.</p>
