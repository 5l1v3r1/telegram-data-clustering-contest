      <h3>Rebellion Acquires The Bitmap Brothers Brand and Entire Portfolio of Games</h3>
      <p>By <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/author/Sean+Carey">Sean Carey</a>, 25 Nov 2019<br/>Comments<br/>Rebellion has announced that they have acquired the brand and portfolio of The Bitmap Brothers. Now, that name might be a bit lost on you unless you're an avid retro videogame fan or happened to play some of The Bitmap Brothers titles on the Commodore Amiga or Atari ST.</p>

      <p>The Bitmap Brothers were responsible for some of the stand-out games of the late 80s and early 90s, Xenon, Z Steel Soldiers, Chaos Engine and Speedball, to name a few. Now Rebellion has bought the brand and portfolio rights and plans to create new titles based on The Bitmap Brothers previous games as well as re-release some of those titles too.</p>
      <p>“We’re delighted with the addition of The Bitmap Brothers to the ever-growing Rebellion portfolio,” said Rebellion CEO and Co-founder Jason Kingsley OBE. “The Bitmap Brothers are renowned for making great games and for bringing gaming into the mainstream with inimitable style. We’ve known Mike Montgomery for many years, and we’re honoured by the faith and trust that he has shown in us by passing on the torch. We’ll strive to be vigilant custodians of one of gaming’s great names.”</p>
      <p>Rebellion themselves started off developing games for the Atari Jaguar in the early 90s with the likes of Eye of the Storm and Alien vs Predator and even bought Battlezone off Atari back in 2015 and re-released that as a launch title for the PlayStation VR. It's probably safe to say that The Bitmap Brothers titles are secure in the hands of Rebellion. Rebellion also co-developed the original Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six and is perhaps most well known for the <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/series/Sniper-Elite">Sniper Elite series</a> and <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/Strange-Brigade/achievements">Strange Brigade</a>.</p>
      <p>Hopefully, we could see some more retro games getting a refresh and making their way to Xbox consoles. Are there any games from the early 80s and 90s that you want to see remastered or remade?
