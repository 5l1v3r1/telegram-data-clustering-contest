      <p>But <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/10-facts-about-mikey-north-the-actor-who-plays-gary-windass/">Gary's</a> right to be paranoid as <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/a-short-history-of-coronation-streets-nick-tilsley/">Nick</a> and Sarah secretly meet with Derek. What are they up to?</p>
      <p>Viewers know Gary and Sarah split up months ago and she has become increasingly suspicious of his behaviour.</p>
      <p>After it was revealed <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/corrie-fans-slam-obvious-twist-gary-was-behind-factory-collapse/">Gary was the one responsible for the factory roof collapse</a> that <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/coronation-street-fans-distraught-as-rana-dies-in-factory-collapse/">killed Rana Habeeb</a>, Gary ended up murdering loan shark Rick Neelan.</p>
      <p>To get back in with construction at the factory, Gary hired Derek to pose as a contractor to <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/10-facts-about-ben-price-the-actor-who-plays-nick-tilsley/">Nick</a>.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Derek offered to buy the land, build the factory and lease it to Nick - however Gary is the one behind the scenes pulling the strings.</p>
      <p>Gary soon got fed up with Derek when he signed a short-term rental agreement with Nick behind his back.</p>
      <p>To make things worse, he began seeing Gary's ex-girlfriend and mother of his son, Izzy.</p>

      <p>Although Derek wasn't initially afraid of Gary, when he saw the damage Gary did to Ryan he fled the street and hasn't been seen since.</p>
      <p>Since Derek's absence, Gary has started seeing Maria but she has no idea how dangerous Gary really is.</p>
      <p>Are Sarah and Nick about to learn the truth about Gary and Derek's partnership?</p>
