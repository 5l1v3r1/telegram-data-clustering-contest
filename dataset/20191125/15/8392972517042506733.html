      <h1>I'm A Celebrity viewers slam Richard Madeley for calling Caitlyn 'he' in 'toe-curling' Extra Camp interview</h1>
      <h2>He heaped praise on the American reality star</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T15:43:14+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 15:43</time> by <a rel="author">Richard Bell</a></address>
      <p>Fans of <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/">I'm A Celebrity</a> have called out TV's Richard Madeley for referring to Caitlyn Jenner as a 'he' during an interview on Extra Camp.</p>
      <p>The former GMTV fave, 63, was on the spin-off show last night (24.11.19) to chat about I'm A Celeb and offer his take on the latest jungle drama.</p>
      <p>After they watched a clip of transgender reality star Caitlyn having a friendly chinwag with fellow <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/im-a-celebrity-jacqueline-jossa-fears-shell-break-if-public-keep-voting-for-her-to-do-the-trials/">campmate Jacqueline Jossa</a>, host Joel Dommett said: "Caitlyn really seems to be taking on the motherly role in the camp. Everyone's really looking up to her."</p>

      </p>
      <p>His co-host Emily Atack said: "Even though Jacqueline's a mother herself, it's quite nice to see her being mothered as well."</p>
      <p>Richard then said: "He was saying, wasn't he, in one of the earlier exchanges, they said, 'What do your kids call you?' and he said, 'They call me dad. But they call me she'.</p>
      <p>"So I think it's an interesting blend, actually, of paternalism as well as maternalism."</p>

      <p>Pronouns aside, Richard had nothing but positive things to say about Caitlyn, adding: "He's such an intelligent, thoughtful, sensitive person. Really is."</p>
      <p>But as the conversation continued, Richard started using the pronoun 'she' instead.</p>

      <p>He said on the programme: "I think she's discovered that honesty, and being open, is actually the way to peace of mind.</p>
      <p>"Not holding anything back, you're opening up. And she doesn't, she isn't holding anything back, it's amazing."</p>
      <p>ED! has contacted Richard's reps for comment.</p>
      <aside>How many times does Richard have to call Caitlyn a he!</aside>
      <p>He might have heaped praise on Caitlyn and switched to her chosen pronoun in the latter half of the conversation, but that didn't stop some viewers rushing to Twitter to call Richard's words "disrespectful".</p>
      <p>One said: "Oh no, I cringed so hard at Richard Madeley misgendering Caitlyn 2/3 times."</p>
      <p>Another wrote: "How many times does Richard have to call Caitlyn a he! Very disrespectful #ExtraCamp."</p>

      <p>A third tweeted: "Richard Madeley referring to Caitlyn Jenner as 'he' on #ExtraCamp - not cool!"</p>
      <p>Someone else put: "Richard Madeley needs to stop saying 'he' when talking about #CaitlynJenner #ImACelebrity2019 #ExtraCamp."</p>
      <p>"Richard Madeley repeatedly misgendering Caitlyn Jenner was toe curling," said a fifth.</p>
