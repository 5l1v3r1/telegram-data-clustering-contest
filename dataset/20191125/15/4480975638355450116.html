      <h1>US: Dallas Fed Manufacturing Index improved to -1.3 in November vs. -11.3 expected</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T15:38:04+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 15:38</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fxstreet.com/author/eren-%C5%9Fengezer" target="_blank">Eren Sengezer</a></address>
      <p>The economic activity in Texas' manufacturing sector recovered in November with the General Business Activity Index rising to -1.3 from -5.1 in October, the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas' latest Texas Manufacturing Outlook Survey revealed.</p>
      <p>Although this reading came in better than the market expectation of -11.3, the US Dollar Index failed to capitalize on it and was last seen flat on the day at 98.27.</p>
      <p>"Perceptions of broader business conditions worsened slightly in November. The general business activity index remained negative but moved up from -5.1 to -1.3," the publication read. "The company outlook index fell 11 points to -2.1. Both indexes have oscillated between positive (expansionary) and negative (contractionary) territory this year, with the latest barely-negative readings suggesting modest contraction."</p>
      <p>"The index measuring uncertainty regarding companies’ outlooks moved up to 17.1, a reading well above average," the Dallas <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/macroeconomics/central-banks/fed">Fed</a> added. </p>
