      <p>HONOLULU (AP) - The University of Hawaii is seeking additional funds for student mental health services, scholarships and other items.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.staradvertiser.com/">The Honolulu Star-Advertiser</a> reported the Board of Regents approved the fiscal year 2020-2021 supplemental operating budget request of about $28 million Thursday.</p>
      <p>The request will be submitted to the state Legislature and Democratic Gov. David Ige.</p>
      <p>Officials say the university is seeking $2.6 million to hire 19 psychologists for the 10-campus system.</p>
