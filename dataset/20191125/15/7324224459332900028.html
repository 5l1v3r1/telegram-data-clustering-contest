      <p>A Labour General Election candidate has apologised for an old Twitter post referring to Israel which used the word “gassed”.</p>
      <p>In 2012, Peymana Assad tweeted: “Some man I just met thought I was Israeli so I cracked the 10 lost tribes of Israel joke to him and he got gassed.”</p>

      <p>The tweet was highlighted on Monday by @GnasherJew, a Twitter account dedicated to “exposing left-wing anti-Semitism” which claims to be run by Jewish journalists and former Labour Party members.</p>
      <p>The account said it was not sure what Ms Assad meant by the post, but described it as “exceptionally distasteful”.</p>
      <p>Others criticised Ms Assad for the tweet, with Times columnist Daniel Finkelstein responding: “This is the person Labour is asking my family &amp; neighbours to vote for in my constituency.”</p>
      <p>Mr Finkelstein later thanked Ms Assad for her apology and said he accepted her explanation.</p>
      <p>In a statement shared on Monday afternoon, Ms Assad apologised and said she used the word “gassed” as a “common slang term for being happy and excited”.</p>
      <p>“It didn’t occur to me at all that it would have other connotations and I’m completely mortified that I didn’t realise this. I unreservedly apologise,” she wrote.</p>

      <p>The candidate for Ruislip, Northwood and Pinner shared examples of other posts from 2012 and 2013 in which she used the term.</p>
      <p>She also posted Urban Dictionary’s definition – which describes the word as “when one is overwhelmed or cannot hold your excitement any longer”.</p>
      <p>She added: “I said I was Afghan but that there’s a theory that Afghans descend from one of the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel, we laughed about it being a kind of strange theory that’s never been proved</p>
      <p>“He was really intrigued by it and said he’d look it up when he got home.”</p>

      <p>Ms Assad continued: “I’ve been outspoken against any pro-Palestinian campaigners blaming Jewish people for Israel’s actions and about anti-Semitism in our party and calling out those who seek to deny and downplay it.</p>
      <p>“I am absolutely committed to standing in solidarity with Jewish people and to fighting anti-Semitism.”</p>
