      <p>When the little girl, who has behaviour problems, asks for a firework party, Fiz puts her foot down worrying that her daughter's love of flammable objects is getting out of hand.</p>
      <p>Although Tyrone is also worried he suggests they have the party to keep Hope happy.</p>
      <p>But things soon get out of hand when Fiz notices the back garden is on fire and Hope is standing nearby watching the flames in amusement.</p>

      <p>Fiz and Tyrone are horrified to realise Hope must've started the fire, but Jack soon reveals the fire had already started when he and Hope entered the back garden.</p>
      <p>Did Hope start the fire, or could it of been home tutor Jade?</p>
      <p>With the evidence pointing to Hope, Fiz admits to Tyrone she thinks her daughter was behind the fire in the factory building site.</p>

      <p>Tyrone is shocked when his girlfriend admits she's been thinking the worst about Hope for weeks but didn't want to admit the truth out of fear he would leave her.</p>
      <p>The pair eventually make up and take a stand against the little girl, deciding to be tougher on her.</p>
      <p>But Jade is already stirring drama and suggests to Evelyn that Fiz's parenting skills aren't up to scratch.</p>
      <p>And Jade's point seems to be confirmed when Fiz smashes Hope's iPad in a fit of rage after finding a lighter hidden in her doll.</p>

      <p>However it's not all bad as Fiz soon receives a letter from Hope's old school saying there's space for her and she can return.</p>
      <p>But with Hope returning to school, it means the family no longer need Jade.</p>
      <p>Fiz is forced to break the news to the live-in tutor that her services are no longer needed. How will she take the news?</p>
