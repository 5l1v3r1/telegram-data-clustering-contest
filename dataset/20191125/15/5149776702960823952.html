      <p>Notts County manager Neal Ardley believes there are people "around the club and area" who want Notts County to fail this season and says he finds it "sad".</p>
      <p>During the preview to tomorrow night's clash against Boreham Wood, the <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/notts-county-fc">Magpies</a> boss was responding to a question about riding the emotions of social media.</p>
      <p>And he claimed that while he does not scour it himself, he says there are people who do want the club to succeed which he found disappointing.</p>
      <p>"I don't go on social media, but people make you aware of bits and bobs that are going on," he said.</p>
      <p>"It's tough. One week everything is brilliant and great. Then in the following week you are the worst manager, worst team in the world etc.</p>

      <p>"That's life.</p>
      <p>"But probably the most disappointing thing with it all is there are people out there, around this club, around this area, that want Notts to fail for whatever reason.</p>
      <p>"That's sad. I am not going to mention names. You can go on social media sites and work it out for yourselves.</p>
      <p>"But I've got a driven group of lads. We've got a team spirit and above all we are trying to bring success."</p>
