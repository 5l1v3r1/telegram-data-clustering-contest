      <h1>Photographer Captures Seattle Lined Up with Mt. Rainier</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T15:33:25+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 15:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://petapixel.com/author/michaelczhang/" target="_blank">Michael Zhang</a></address>
      <p>Seattle-based photographer <a href="https://www.timdurkan.com/">Tim Durkan</a> captured this beautiful aerial photo of Mt. Rainier lined up with the city of Seattle, Washington.<br/><br/>Durkan is Seattle’s Chief Photographer, a position he has held for 16 years. He’s also the brother of Seattle mayor Jenny Durkan.</p>
      <p>“I was coming home from a fun trip to Vegas with friends,” Durkan tells PetaPixel. “They had all been seated in first class for helping a passenger with medical issues on the flight down. There weren’t any more upgrades available but I did get my own row in the middle of the plane and facing Mount Rainier on the flight back!</p>
      <p>“As we made our final approach into SeaTac Airport, the city lined up perfectly with Mt. Rainier and I got a shot with my new iPhone 11 Pro! I did a quick edit on Adobe Lightroom mobile and posted it before I got off the plane.”</p>
      <p>Mount Rainier, an active 14,411-foot volcano, is nearly 60 miles away from Seattle as the crow flies. Seattle is the cloudiest major city in the continental US with <a href="https://www.currentresults.com/Weather-Extremes/US/cloudiest-cities.php">an average of 226 days a year of cloudy skies</a>, so Durkan definitely got lucky weather-wise with this photograph.</p>
