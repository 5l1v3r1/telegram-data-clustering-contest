      <h1>US calls back ambassador from S.Sudan</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T15:40:12+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 15:40</time> by <a rel="author">AFP</a></address>
      <p>The United States, a key supporter of South Sudan, said it was calling back its ambassador for consultations as it shows frustration with dueling leaders' failure to form a government.</p>
      <p>Secretary of State Mike Pompeo wrote on Twitter that he called back the ambassador "as we re-evaluate our relationship with the government of South Sudan."</p>
      <p>"We will work with the region to support efforts to achieve peace and a successful political transition in South Sudan," he said.</p>
      <p>The United States, which contributes about $1 billion a year in mostly humanitarian aid for the young country, has been especially vocal in its exasperation over the lack of progress in South Sudan.</p>
      <p>South Sudan President Salva Kiir and rebel chief Riek Machar fell out in 2013 -- two years after the largely Christian nation won independence from Sudan with strong US support -- sparking a conflict that has left hundreds of thousands dead.</p>
      <p>The two leaders missed a November 12 deadline to form a unity government. African mediators gave them another 100 days, the second extension.</p>
      <p>The US ambassador in Juba, Thomas Hushek, will hold talks in Washington on the re-evaluation of the relationship, State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said.</p>
      <p>Tibor Nagy, the assistant secretary of state for African affairs, said earlier this month that he believed Kiir and Machar had grown content with the status quo.</p>
      <p>"The international community is providing the food, the medicines, basically all of the human needs that are the responsibilities of governments to do. They're basically sitting back," he said.</p>
