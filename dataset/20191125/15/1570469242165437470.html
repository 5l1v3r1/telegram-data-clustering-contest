      <p>It's a landslide victory for pro-democracy lawmakers in the Hong Kong district council elections, which is being seen as a de-facto referendum on the city's Beijing-backed government to which China responded by saying no matter what the outcome is Hong Kong will always remain its part.</p>
      <p>Counting is almost over and the pro-democracy camp has gained a majority in 17 out of 18 districts by winning 390 of total 452 seats.</p>
      <p>The results are being attributed to young voters who participated in the anti-government protests.</p>
      <p>The recent development sends a strong message to China and the city's Chief Executive Carrie Lam, as the pro-establishment camp won all the council seats in the last elections, held in 2015.</p>
      <p>Earlier, the establishment had a majority in the district council with 292 seats.</p>
      <p>Kelvin Lam, the candidate backed by activist Joshua Wong has won a seat from the South Horizons district.</p>
      <p>Wong who was barred from contesting the polls for violating Hong Kong's basic law has said that pro-democracy movement won't stop at the local polls and will surge ahead.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has said that all camps in Hong Kong are pro-democracy and that the city will always remain a Chinese territory.</p>
      <p>Beijing has also said that it supports Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam's leadership for Hong Kong.</p>
      <p>In a statement released online, Carrie Lam has said that the government respected the verdict and will "seriously reflect" on the results.</p>
      <p>Lam also noted that the results pointed to the people's dissatisfaction with the current situation and the deep-seated problems in society.</p>
      <p>However, it is worth noting that these are local polls and do not impact Lam's position but they have certainly undermined her government's authority.</p>
      <p>These are also the first public elections in Hong Kong since the mass protests broke out in June.</p>
