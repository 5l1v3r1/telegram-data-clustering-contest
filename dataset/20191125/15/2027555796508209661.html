      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T15:15:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 15:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/sagar-kulkarni" target="_blank">Sagar Kulkarni</a></address>
      <p>Congress and few other parties have decided to boycott the Constitution Day celebrations in the Central Hall of Parliament on Tuesday which would be addressed by President Ram Nath Kovind.</p>
      <p>Lawmakers of the Congress, Trinamool, Left parties and the DMK have decided to boycott the function, a senior Congress leader said.</p>
      <p>He said the lawmakers of the Congress and other like-minded parties will protest at the same time as the function near the statue of Babasaheb Ambedkar in the Parliament premises.</p>
      <p>Congress has accused the Modi government of "murdering democracy" by installing Devendra Fadnavis as the chief minister of Maharashtra by stealth after poaching a section of the NCP.</p>
      <p>Congress and other like-minded parties stalled proceedings in both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha and forced repeated adjournments.</p>
