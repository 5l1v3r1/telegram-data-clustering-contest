      <p>Danielle Kay, 35, picked up stockings for her two kids but was upset when she realised they had nowhere to hang them.</p>
      <p>The care worker lived in a house without a fireplace – but that didn’t stop the thrifty mum creating one for just £2.</p>
      <p>She spent three nights and £2 making her own temporary fireplace at their home in Chester, for Jess, eight, and Poppy, four,</p>
      <p>The fireplace is made from cardboard, a piece of wood and brick effect wrapping paper which she found in her house and only had to spend £2 to buy glue to put it together.</p>
      <p>Danielle said: ‘We didn’t have a fireplace to hang the stockings up and my daughters really wanted to have stockings this year.</p>
      <p>‘I had seen a few ideas online and took inspiration from, but I love crafts anyway so it seemed like a no brainer to make my own.</p>

      <p>‘The sides are made from old Christmas tree boxes and a third for the mantle piece, then I got a piece of old wood and used it as the base.</p>

      <p>‘I used a glue gun to assemble it all, I went through a whole pack of glue but it was needed because the fireplace needs to stay up until Christmas day.’</p>
      <p>She says that her two daughters love what she’s done and they are excited for the festive season.</p>
      <p>She adds: ‘It was just a nice bit of fun to get them in the mood for the big day.</p>
      <p>‘I think they were worried that Santa wouldn’t be able to get down the chimney this year but they’re reassured now that he’ll be able to pop down and deliver their presents.’</p>
      <p>Danielle posted the picture in a Facebook group and it was so realistic, some people even got a bit confused and thought they were real bricks.</p>

      <p>‘I hilariously had comments saying I had laid the bricks wonky so I had to politely let them know it was wrapping paper.’</p>
      <p>The pictures online racked up thousands of likes and comments from people impressed with how real the fireplace looks.</p>

      <p>She did however get a couple of worried parents comment on the air filter behind the fireplace and claimed she would get carbon monoxide poisoning because it was covered up.</p>
      <p>Danielle said: ‘There are holes poked in the cardboard just to reassure anyone who thought we may end up being poisoned.</p>
      <p>‘It was much cheaper than buying a fireplace, so I think we’ll do the same again next year!’</p>
