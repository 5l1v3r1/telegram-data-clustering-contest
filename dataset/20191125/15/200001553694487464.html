      <h1>From Spain: Leeds United could look to sign player on loan in January window</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T15:35:45+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 15:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/author/annie/" target="_blank">Sport Witness Team</a></address>
      <p>Over the weekend, it was reported in England that Matej Vydra could move to Leeds United in the January window.</p>
      <p>The former Derby County striker was a serious option for Leeds before he moved to Burnley in 2018, but things haven’t gone so well for him at the Premier League club.</p>
      <p>With just 58 minutes in the league so far this season, Vydra has still managed to find the back of the net once, yet it didn’t do him much benefit and he’s further slipping out of the picture at Burnley.</p>
      <p>Perhaps strangely, Spanish website <a href="https://www.todofichajes.com/matej-vydra-podria-salir-cedido-al-leeds-united/">TodoFichajes</a> say they’ve received information that Leeds could loan the 27 year old in January, rather than signing him on a permanent basis. They insist this is from their own sources and the article is from the website’s editor.</p>
      <p>There’s no obvious reason why this news would pop up in Spain, Vydra is represented by a Czech agency and hasn’t played in La Liga, with there being no recent reports of interest from there either.</p>
      <p>When he was close to a move to Leeds, there were repeat reports about the potential transfer in the Czech media, with sources close to the player often speaking.</p>
      <p>That isn’t the case at the moment, and until it is maybe there’s not a great deal in this.</p>
