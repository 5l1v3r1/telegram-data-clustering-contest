      <p>The French Prime Minister, Edouard Philippe, on Monday, promised a series of new measures to prevent spousal murders.</p>
      <p>The announcement came two days after tens of thousands of protesters marched in Paris and elsewhere, demanding an end to what activists have termed “femicide” or the killing of women.</p>
      <p>Government figures show that 121 women and 28 men were killed by their partner or ex-partner in 2018.</p>
      <p>Closing a two-month consultation process on tackling domestic violence, Philippe denounced what he said was the silence “of those, who want to see and hear nothing so as not to have problems”.</p>
      <p>There was also a “collective silence about failures that we have until today, not wanted to be aware of,’’ he said.</p>
      <p>“These forms of silence, kill.’’</p>
      <p>“The way our whole society looks at this must change,’’ Philippe said, promising education on the topic in schools and compulsory sexual equality training for teachers.</p>
      <p>But he admitted that “everyone is aware that this will be a slow process,’’ promising a range of more immediate measures, including extra social workers to support police and centres across France for rehabilitating those guilty of domestic violence.</p>
      <p>Also, among the 30 measures announced are changes to facilitate doctors in passing on information about women at immediate risk, despite patient confidentiality requirements.</p>
      <p>Philippe said that the recent focus on the issue has raised awareness, with calls to a hotline for victims rising from an average of 150 to 600 days since the consultation process started.</p>
