      <p>Another small-screen project is coming from 'The Wire' actor.</p>
      <p><b>(AllHipHop News)</b> Two British stars are joining forces to bring Derek Owusu’s <i>Teaching My Brother To Read</i> to television. Idris Elba’s Green Door Pictures production company is adapting the forthcoming book from Grime artist Stormzy's #Merky Books publishing company.</p>
      <p>“Derek’s book will be an inspiring exploration of brotherhood and how literature can influence and transform lives. We are genuinely excited about adapting this book as a work of fiction and non-fiction," <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/idris-elbas-green-door-pictures-to-adapt-stormzy-published-teaching-my-brother-to-read-for-tv-1202794374/">said Elba</a> (<i>The Wire</i>, <i>Thor: Ragnarok).</i></p>
      <p>Green Door Pictures is responsible for Sky One's <i>In The Long Run,</i> Netflix’s <i>Turn Up Charlie,</i> and Discovery’s<i> Idris Elba: Fighter. </i>#Merky Books launched with Stormzy’s first book, <i>Rise Up</i>, in 2018. <i>That Reminds Me </i>by Owusu was also published through the Penguin Random House-backed imprint.</p>
      <p>“I know too many talented writers that don’t always have an outlet or a means to get their work seen, and hopefully #Merky Books can now be a reference point for them to say ‘I can be an author’, and for that to be a realistic and achievable goal,”<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/mar/13/stormzy-launches-search-for-best-writer-of-a-new-generation-merky"> said Stormzy</a> in March.</p>
