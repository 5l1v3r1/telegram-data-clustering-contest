      <h1>General election - what do the polls say will happen in the West Midlands?</h1>
      <h2>Here are the seats that could change hands in the West Midlands if the opinion polls are right</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T15:16:17+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 15:16</time> by <a rel="author">Jonathan Walker, https://www.facebook.com/JonWalkerPolitics?pnref=story</a></address>
      <p>Opinion polls show the Conservatives firmly in the lead - although there's still almost three weeks to go until the general election on December 12.</p>
      <p>What will happen if they're right? It's possible to make a guess about which seats would change hands in the West Midlands, and there could be a number of gains for the Conservatives.</p>
      <p>Of course, any prediction is nothing more than a rough guide as to what could happen. The polls may be wrong, or opinions might change before the election takes place.</p>
      <p>And the prediction assumes that there is a uniform "swing" across the country. This refers to voters switching between the different parties. In practice, it may be that people behave differently in some constituencies to others.</p>
      <h3>What do the polls say?</h3>
      <p>The most recent "poll of polls" from the <a href="https://britainelects.newstatesman.com/">Britain Elects</a> website, which brings together results from all the recent polls, says this is how people plan to vote:</p>
      <p>Conservatives 42.4%</p>
      <p>Labour 29.6%</p>
      <p>Liberal Democrats 14.7%</p>
      <p>Brexit Party: 4.6%</p>
      <p>Green Party: 3.3%</p>
      <h3>What would this mean for the West Midlands?</h3>

      <p>The prediction tool on website <a href="https://www.electoralcalculus.co.uk/">Electoral Calculus</a> suggests that this could mean the Tories gain a number of seats from Labour, including:</p>
      <p>Birmingham Northfield</p>
      <p>Dudley North (which Labour won in 2017, although the MP later became an independent)</p>
      <p>Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire</p>
      <p>Stoke Central</p>
      <p>Stoke North</p>
      <p>Warwick and Leamington</p>
      <p>West Bromwich West</p>
      <p>Wolverhampton North East</p>
      <p>Wolverhampton South West</p>
      <h3>What would it mean nationally?</h3>
      <p>Nationwide the Conservatives would win 362 seats, giving them a majority of 74</p>
      <h3>Is this good news for the Conservatives?</h3>
      <p>It's worth pointing out, once again, that the polls can be wrong - and even if they are right, then things might change before the December 12 election.</p>
      <p>Labour supporters might not welcome predictions of a Conservative majority. But strange as it may sound, a lot of Conservatives won't welcome it either. That's because they believe, rightly or wrongly, that one of the best ways of winning support in this election is to convince voters that Jeremy Corbyn will become Prime Minister unless people vote Conservative. Tories think - and they might be wrong - that there are voters who wouldn't normally support them, but might do so in this election in order to stop Mr Corbyn gaining power.</p>

      <p>So any suggestion that the Tories have the election in the bag might actually hurt their chances, because it could lead voters to think they can safely vote for a different party.</p>
      <h3>How does this election compare to 2017?</h3>
      <p>The "poll of polls" puts the Conservative share of the vote on 42.4%. It may come as a surprise, but that's exactly what the Conservatives actually got in the 2017 election.</p>
      <p>Of course, in 2017 the result was a hung Parliament. But what's different - according to the polls - is that Labour is set to do much worse this time than in 2017.</p>
      <p>So, if the polls are right, the Conservatives could actually win a reasonable majority in Parliament even though their share of the vote is no better than it was in 2017. It would mean Boris Johnson was seen as a great success - despite doing no better than Theresa May the election two years ago.</p>

      <p>Perhaps it's worth noting that the Conservatives led by Theresa May actually got far more votes in 2017 than they got when the party was led by David Cameron in the 2010 election and the 2015 election.</p>
      <p>However, Mr Cameron appeared to be very successful in elections while Mrs May appeared to be a failure. The difference is that Labour won far more votes in 2017 than in the past, which meant the gap between the two parties was very narrow.</p>
      <p>If Boris Johnson matches Theresa May's share of the vote in 2017 - but Labour's share goes down - the Tories could appear to have won a major victory, despite doing no better than last time.</p>
