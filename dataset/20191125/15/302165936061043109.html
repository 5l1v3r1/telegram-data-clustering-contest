      <p>NOVEMBER 25 — Stories about the mob have become offers that Hollywood cannot seem to refuse.</p>
      <p><i>The Irishman</i>, Martin Scorsese’s new movie arriving on Netflix on Wednesday about the Bufalino crime family and famed union boss Jimmy Hoffa, marks the latest entry in a genre that has fascinated audiences and filmmakers for decades.</p>
      <p>Pop culture watchers say that is hardly surprising given the combination of crime, family, violence and the American Dream that Hollywood tales about the Mafia offer.</p>
      <p>“It’s a genre that really hits that sweet spot between a fascination with crime and a set of relatable family dynamics,” said David Schmid, editor of “Violence in American Popular Culture” and an associate professor of English at the University at Buffalo.</p>
      <p><i>The Irishman</i>, starring Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci, follows offerings ranging from <i>Little Caesar</i> in 1931 to <i>The Godfather</i> and <i>The Sopranos</i> that have reaped rewards both at the box office and at awards.</p>
      <p>After strong reviews, Scorsese’s return to the kind of Italian-American territory he explored in <i>Goodfellas</i> and <i>Casino</i> is expected to be a leading contender at next year’s Oscars.</p>
      <p>“In many ways, the Mafia took over from the Western as the great American epic,” said Robert Thompson, pop culture professor at Syracuse University.</p>
      <p>“It’s about the settling of the urban frontier as opposed to the geographical frontier, and it’s also a great immigration story,” he said.</p>
      <p>Large Italian-American families, often gathered around dinner tables heaving with pasta, give audiences strong characters to root for, even if they are on the wrong side of the law.</p>
      <p>Mafia films also give a twist to the classic American immigrant story of arriving in a new country, having to fend for one’s self and working hard to achieve goals, Thompson said.</p>
      <p>When HBO’s TV series <i>The Sopranos</i> ushered in the notion of an emotionally conflicted mob boss, it deepened the morally ambiguous territory that mobsters inhabit on screen, but which helps make them so appealing.</p>
      <p>“The reason these neurotic Mafiosi resonate with us is that we can all relate to being in a job that we don’t want to do,” said Schmid.</p>
      <p>Yet, while violence is a key part of the package, there is often less blood-curdling violence than other action movies.</p>
      <p>“If you were to make a really explicitly violent Mafia movie, that wouldn’t be so popular with the audience,” said Schmid.</p>
      <p>“The audience would prefer to be carried away by the romance of the quintessentially immigrant narrative where a person goes from nothing to becoming a godfather.” — Reuters</p>
