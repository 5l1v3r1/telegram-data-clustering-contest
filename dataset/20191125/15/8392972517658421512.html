      <p>Ofcom has received complaints from viewers over last night's live <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/">I'm A Celebrity</a> Bushtucker trial.</p>
      <p>James Haskell, Roman Kemp, Ian Wright, Caitlyn Jenner, Andrew Maxwell, Jacqueline Jossa and Adele Roberts took part in a <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/reality-tv/love-island/">Love Island</a> themed trial to win a roast dinner for each campmate.</p>
      <p>However, one challenge in particular left viewers infuriated as they claimed it was "impossible" for James and Roman to do.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The last trial saw James and Roman lying in a bed filled with snakes.</p>
      <p>They had to try and unscrew three stars in the blue boxes, which were on James' side and filled with a crab, spiders and cockroaches, and move it to the corresponding yellow box on Roman's side, which were also filled with critters, in just 90 seconds.</p>
      <p>The pair didn't manage to complete the trial, meaning Ian, Cliff Parisi and Andy Whyment weren't going to be getting their roasts.</p>
      <p>Viewers were fuming and some even claimed the trial was "fixed".</p>

      <p>Some were so angry that they complained to watchdog Ofcom about the episode.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson confirmed that 48 people complained.</p>
      <p>They said: "We are assessing these complaints against our broadcasting rules, before deciding whether or not to investigate."</p>
      <p>It comes after hosts <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/ant-mcpartlin/">Ant McPartlin</a> and <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/declan-donnelly/">Dec Donnelly</a> defended the show after viewers insisted the trial was "unfair".</p>
      <p>One person had tweeted: "There was no way anyone on this earth could have completed James &amp; Roman's trial in 90secs! Be fair and feed the last 3 will you #ImACelebrity2019. Shouldn't have had less than 3 mins on that."</p>
      <p>The duo replied: "The stand ins did it when we tested it."</p>

      </p>
      <p>Following the trial, James even vented his frustration after Dec asked him: "That was unlucky. What was it James?"</p>
      <p>James hit back: "What was it? It was the very fact there was a giant crab in the way that you wanted me to carefully caress in a different direction as I tried to unscrew a star in its face."</p>
      <p>Dec exclaimed: "Alright someone's getting prickly!"</p>
      <p>I'm A Celebrity continues tonight at 9pm on ITV.</p>
