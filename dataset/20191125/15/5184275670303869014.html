      <p>Jennifer recently confirmed that <i>Beyhadh 2</i> will be replacing Amitabh Bachchan’s Kaun Banega Crorepati’s season 11. Talking about her character with a daily, Jennifer Winget talked about how her character in <i>Beyhadh 2</i> will be different from the previous installation. “I am completely in love with my character. So much so, it called for a do-over! But no, in all seriousness, the show gave me a blank canvas to chart the course of my character. Being out of the box, you have the opportunity to get creative.”</p>
      <p>She further added, “Not very often do roles like this fall into your lap, so for an actor, it really gets you to push your limits, whilst working within your resources. The show and character are both close to heart. The whole team has put in a lot of thought and effort to come up with the final look for Maya in Season 2 of <i>Beyhadh</i> so, I hope the audience shows the same amount of appreciation and love, if not more.”</p>
