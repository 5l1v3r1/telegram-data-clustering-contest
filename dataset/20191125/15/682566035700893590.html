      <p>Cape Town - More than <b>5 200 </b>spectators attended the Cape Derby between the <b>Cape Town Blitz </b>and <b>Paarl Rocks</b>Â at Newlands on Sunday morning.</p>
      <p>The spectators were treated to a nail-biting finish as Paarl Rocks claimed a narrow 2-run victory, with the game going down to the last ball.</p>
      <p>"We are obviously disappointed with the loss (against Paarl Rocks) because we really wanted to give the fans who came out in their numbers a good win," Cape Town Blitz captain, Quinton de Kock said.</p>
      <p>"On behalf of the team, I want to thank the 'Blitz Brigade' for turning up, the atmosphere from even when we were warming up was amazing, right until the last ball of the game. I've played at Newlands many times and the Cape Town crowd is one of the most passionate in the country and it's fantastic to see how they have embraced the new Cape Town Blitz brand.</p>
      <p>"We had over 5 000 people at the ground yesterday and I'm hoping now that we are coming to the end of the work year, Universities and schools are starting to wrap up, that we can pack out Newlands for our remaining 3 home games over the next couple of weeks."</p>
      <p>As the competition enters the business end, Cape Town Blitz remain in the running.</p>
      <p>"In an effort to make the competition accessible to all cricket lovers, we have taken the step to ensure the magic of the Mzansi Super League is affordable to all," Cape Town Blitz CEO Nabeal Dien noted.</p>
      <p>The Blitz also confirmed that all tickets for all remaining home games in the MSL this year would be R30 per ticket, regardless if it's a seated ticket or in the grass embankment.</p>
      <p>"We want families to attend and enjoy some of the best cricket in South Africa. We also call on corporates to come to Newlands for their year-end functions," communications manager David Brooke said.</p>
      <p>The Cape Town Blitz hosts Durban Heat on Thursday, 28 November at 17:30 before taking on the Tshwane Spartans on Sunday, 1 December at 14:00. Their final home match is against the Nelson Mandela Bay Giants on Friday, 6 December at 17:30.</p>
