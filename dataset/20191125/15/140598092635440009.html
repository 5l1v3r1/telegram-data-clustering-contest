      <p>New York undoubtedly offers an indulgent side. But while you can dress to the nines and mingle in the city’s chicest cocktail lounges, spoil yourself dining in some of the world’s best restaurants and watch Broadway’s talented performers command the stage, pampering with food, drink, and entertainment is only the beginning. For the ultimate splurge, book a room and schedule a Swedish massage, an ayurvedic facial, or a full day of wellness at one these incredible properties in our pick of New York’s top spa hotels.</p>

      <p>This swanky hotel is tucked in One57, one of the city's tallest and most talked about residences. The 13,000 feet of space in Spa Nalai feels otherworldly and not like Manhattan at all. That is until you notice the views. On the 25th floor, this wellness retreat consists of a state-of-the-art fitness centre with Technogym equipment, and a heated indoor pool with speakers crooning Carnegie Hall music under water. Opt for a massage or time in the steam room, and you'll leave rejuvenated and ready to take on whatever the city throws your way. <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/north-america/united-states/new-york/hotels/park-hyatt-new-york//">Read expert review</a> From £ 505 per night</p>

      <p>The MO's Asian accents – fresh orchids, exotic purple and gold tones – merge with retro elements such as Art Deco chairs and tiled walls. Sleek restaurant Asiate, with its cityscape views and glittering tree-branch ceiling sculpture, has a sumptuous seasonal menu. Don’t miss a treatment in the huge spa set over two floors on the Hudson River side. Highlights are its crystal steam rooms, VIP spa suite with fireplace, and an Oriental Tea Lounge. Ask spa director Heather Hannig about where to go in the city for beauty products, healthy eating and further pampering. <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/north-america/united-states/new-york/hotels/mandarin-oriental-new-york-hotel/">Read expert review</a> From £ 409 per night <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/us/mandarin-oriental.html?aid=839822;label=TMG-1travel1destinations1north0america1united0states1new0york1articles1best0hotel0spas0in0nyc-Mandarin2Oriental2New2York">Check availability</a> Rates provided by Booking.com</p>

      <p>Blingy in a wonderful way. The interiors of this hotel glisten from head to toe. French design team Gilles &amp; Boissier fancied drama here, opting for plenty of mood lighting, herringbone wood flooring, tons of crystal, and sumptuous, drapey fabrics. Alongside the basement pool is Spa de la Mer, offering bespoke treatments created by the eponymous skincare brand. Beauty rituals are the main focus for those who venture into any of its four treatment rooms, although spa-seekers can also opt for a deep tissue massage, aromatherapy session, or body scrub. <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/north-america/united-states/new-york/hotels/baccarat-hotel/">Read expert review</a> From £ 595 per night <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/us/baccarat-and-residences-new-york.html?aid=839822;label=TMG-1travel1destinations1north0america1united0states1new0york1articles1best0hotel0spas0in0nyc-Baccarat2Hotel">Check availability</a> Rates provided by Booking.com</p>

      <p>Sophistication and glam are the essence of this boutique hotel, a 1905 Stanford White-designed building, once the home of the iconic Lambs Club, the first Thespian club in the United States. The Mynd Spa &amp; Salon is a suitably theatrical space with moody lighting and stunning visuals to bring a sense of nature to this subterranean urban setting. Facilities include a saltwater lap pool, a whirlpool plunge bath, and steam showers in the changing rooms. The team of therapists covers everything from massages and body treatments to nail care and make-up. <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/north-america/united-states/new-york/hotels/the-chatwal-hotel/">Read expert review</a> From £ 340 per night <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/us/the-chatwal.html?aid=839822;label=TMG-1travel1destinations1north0america1united0states1new0york1articles1best0hotel0spas0in0nyc-The2Chatwal">Check availability</a> Rates provided by Booking.com</p>

      <p>Luxury hits a high note at the canopied entrance of this sleek high-rise that feels like a chichi Manhattan apartment building. An 11,000 square foot full-service spa is one of the hotel’s highlights (a heavenly aromatherapy massage is bound to melt your troubles away), but the spa also features New York’s first Turkish hammams – one for men and one for women – and other luxury services including anti-aging facials, exfoliating body treatments, deep-tissue massages, and salons for manicures and pedicures. <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/north-america/united-states/new-york/hotels/the-dominick-hotel//">Read expert review</a> From £ 259 per night <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/us/trump-soho.html?aid=839822;label=TMG-1travel1destinations1north0america1united0states1new0york1articles1best0hotel0spas0in0nyc-The2Dominick">Check availability</a> Rates provided by Booking.com</p>

      <p>The Plaza exudes confidence, history and timeless elegance; an eternally classic hotel in a historic Beaux-Arts building. From the moment you cross the threshold, it’s easy to imagine you’re living in a film. The on-site Guerlain Spa is a haven of tranquility amidst the bustle of Midtown Manhattan: trained 'aestheticians' are on hand to deliver a fulsome menu of treatments, from honey-based facials (sourced from Guerlain's 'signature bees') and expert make-up application to body polish therapies and specialist services for men. <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/north-america/united-states/new-york/hotels/The-Plaza//">Read expert review</a> From £ 507 per night <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/us/the-plaza.html?aid=839822;label=TMG-1travel1destinations1north0america1united0states1new0york1articles1best0hotel0spas0in0nyc-The2Plaza">Check availability</a> Rates provided by Booking.com</p>
