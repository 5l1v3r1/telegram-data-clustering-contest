      <p>You can see what Adrian thought of Red Dead Redemption 2 below:</p>
      <blockquote>The hype being created for Red Dead Redemption 2 and the expectations of the passionate fan-base made a part of me believe that Rockstar Games could never deliver on all of their many promises. They did, and then some. From the feeling of a realistic living world they’ve created to the emotional bonds you build, Red Dead Redemption 2 is the video game experience of this generation.</blockquote>
