      <p>This is the heartwarming moment a ‘extremely’ color blind boy broke down in tears as new glasses allow him to see color for the first time.</p>
      <p>Jonathan Jones, 12, was overcome with emotion after his principal, who is also color blind, let him borrow his unique glasses during science class in Cottonwood, Minnesota last week.</p>
      <p>As soon as Jones puts the glasses on, he appears to be immediately taken aback. He initially smiles and laughs immediately after putting the glasses on, but he breaks down moments later.</p>

      <p>He then walks around the classroom with a huge smile on his face, exploring the now-vivid hues around him.</p>
      <p>‘I was feeling joy and happiness that I could finally see all this color…and a little bit of sadness I couldn’t see color my whole life,’ Jonathan told ABC news.</p>

      <p>The boy’s mother, Carole Walter Jones, posted the video online and started a GoFundMe to buy a pair of the unique glasses for Jonathan, who she said is ‘extremely’ color blind. The glasses reportedly cost $350.</p>
      <p>However, so many people were moved by Jones’ video, her <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/sp7m4-color-blind-glasses">GoFundMe</a> campaign actually ended up amassing more than $25,000 as of Monday morning.</p>
      <p>She wrote: ‘After posting a video on social media of Jonathan seeing color for the first time, we have been overwhelmed by how many kind, generous people have wanted to help him get a pair of his own color blind glasses.’</p>
      <p>‘We’ve had multiple pairs donated to Jonathan and will use 100% of donated funds to purchase color blind glasses for those who can’t afford them.’</p>
      <p>‘The wonderful Enchroma company will be matching every pair we purchase with a free pair, which double the number of people we can help,’ she continued.</p>
      <p>For Jonathan, with a new pair glasses comes a new view of the world. He said his favorite color is now blue and he is excited to visit the Bahamas with his family this winter so he can see the ocean.</p>
