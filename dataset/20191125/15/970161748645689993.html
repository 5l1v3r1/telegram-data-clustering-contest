      <p>A man has lost an appeal after a family court judge ruled that he raped a woman during their date.</p>
      <p>The man was previously questioned by police and not charged any criminal offence – but Judge Jennifer Scully made a rape finding after analysing evidence at a private family court hearing.</p>
      <p>She was asked to make a finding as a prelude to decisions being made about what contact the man should have with a child, conceived during the date.</p>
      <p>The judge heard that the woman had allegedly told the man to ‘stop, stop, stop, stop’ while they engaged in a ‘sexual act’ on the night.</p>
      <p>However the man denied that she had ‘ever asked him to stop’, instead claiming that she had ‘consented throughout’.</p>
      <p>Mr Justice Cobb dismissed the man’s appeal and said evidence showed that Judge Scully had been entitled to reach the conclusion she reached.</p>

      <p>Details of the case have been outlined in the ruling which has now been published online.</p>
      <p>Neither of the man or woman can be published in media reports of the case.</p>
      <p>Mr Justice Cobb said the pair had met at a fast food outlet in Newcastle upon Tyne, where the man worked, and had exchanged texts which led to their date.</p>
      <p>The messages suggested that the date could lead to a ‘sex session’ and it was deemed ‘common ground’ that they had sex after eating together.</p>
      <p>It was then that the woman claimed she had told the man to stop.</p>
      <p>Mr Justice Cobb heard that the pair had gone on to have sex at least once more, and possibly twice, during the date.</p>
      <p>The man, who represented himself at the appeal hearing, said Judge Scully’s rape finding was unsound.</p>
      <p>He said Judge Scully had failed to consider ‘all the inconsistencies’ in the woman’s accounts of events, in particular that they had gone on to ‘further sexual activity’ after the ‘alleged rape’.</p>
      <p>The news comes a week after a woman who had been sentenced to seven years behind bars for fracturing her son’s skull was cleared by a senior judge in separate family court proceedings.</p>

      <p>Elizabeth Wilkins, 25, was found guilty of assaulting her child causing grievous bodily harm with intent on 22 September 2016.</p>
      <p>Lord Justice Baker then analysed evidence after council social services bosses responsible for the boy’s care asked him to make findings of fact on the balance of probabilities.</p>
      <p>He concluded that the baby’s father, Erick Vanselow, not Wilkins, had inflicted a ‘series of injuries’ to the baby’s head.</p>
      <p>Mr Vanselow had been acquitted after prosecutors withdraw charges against him, while jurors said they were sure Ms Wilkins had injured her son.</p>
      <p>Wilkins has not appealed against her conviction or sentence, with her barrister stating that she had experienced difficulties raising funds for lawyers to act on her behalf.</p>
