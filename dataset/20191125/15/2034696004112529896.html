      <p>A <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/wu-tang-clan">Wu-Tang Clan</a> theme park in South Korea is in the early stages of development.</p>
      <p>Jimmy S. Kang, the vice president of the legendary hip-hop group’s Wu-Tang Management organisation, is driving the ambitious project and confirmed the plans in a new interview in the US.</p>

      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.masslive.com/news/2019/11/from-his-worcester-storefront-jimmy-kang-is-helping-plan-a-wu-tang-theme-park-in-korea-while-working-as-vp-of-wu-tang-management.html"><i>MassLive</i></a>, Kang said he was currently negotiating for the theme park to open in Seoul, where his family emigrated to the US from when he was four years old.</p>
      <p>The feature on Kang also mentions that he showed the publication plans for the park on his laptop screen. No further details were provided, though.</p>

      <p>While Kang didn’t expand on the details behind his Wu Tang theme park plan, he did credit his father with fuelling his desire to follow through on ambitious projects.</p>
      <p>“[My father] always told me: ‘If you’re going to do something, do it to your fullest potential. Don’t half-ass it or you’re just wasting time.'”</p>
      <p>Wu-Tang’s last full music release came in 2017 with the compilation ‘The Saga Continues’. The sole copy of the group’s last official studio album, ‘Once Upon a Time in Shaolin’, was infamously sold to <a href="https://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-blogs/11-times-martin-shkreli-looked-like-a-comic-book-villain-761156">the controversial entrepreneur Martin Shkreli</a> in 2015.</p>
      <p>Last week, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/joe-rogan-says-wants-buy-long-lost-wu-tang-album-from-martin-shkreli-2568964">podcast host Joe Rogan said that he was willing to buy Shkreli’s copy</a> of ‘Once Upon a Time in Shaolin’.</p>
