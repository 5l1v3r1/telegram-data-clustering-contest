      <p>Black Friday deals are coming in thick and fast now, and this offer at Very.co.uk, combined with a voucher for new credit account holders, has blown away every other price being offered at competing retailers.<br/><br/>If you have never placed an order at Very using an option to pay later (using a credit account), you can use the voucher “PAQ96” to knock £50 off the already decent prices. That means you can get a PS4 Pro or an Xbox One X along with a top game for the exceedingly good price of £253, delivered to your door (£250 if you collect from store).</p>

You have the option to pay the full amount of the item at any point within the buy now, pay later time window. The £50 will be credited to your account a few days after the purchase.</p>
