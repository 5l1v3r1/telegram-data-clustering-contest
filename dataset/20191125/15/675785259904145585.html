      <p>Police are hunting a hit and run driver who ploughed into a woman at speed as she walked along a pavement.</p>
      <p>Victim Ellemae Fitzgerald, a mother-of-two, was walking with friends in Leeds after a night out when she was struck down by a female driver following an altercation.</p>
      <p>A West Yorkshire Police spokesman said: "A 24-year-old woman pedestrian was knocked down by a silver Vauxhall Corsa that appeared to have been deliberately driven at her and two friends following an altercation with the occupants shortly before. The car left the scene."</p>
      <p>Police are treating the incident as “suspected attempted murder” and are appealing for witnesses.</p>
      <p>Ellemae heroically pushed a friend she was walking with out of the path of the car before taking the full force herself and being catapulted along the pavement.</p>

      <p>In horrifying CCTV footage, the first moment Ellemae enters the frame she is ricocheting off the side of the vehicle as it drags her along at what appears to be more than a metre off the floor.</p>
      <p>The horrifying CCTV shows how she is flung towards the floor and skids for some time before coming to a halt.</p>
      <p>The driver doesn’t appear to slow down at any point and continues to speed off into the distance.</p>
      <p>The driver had two other occupants in the silver Vauxhall Corsa vehicle.</p>

      <p>Ellemae was taken to hospital for treatment but was discharged later that morning with only slight injuries.</p>
      <p>A friend said: ”She was a real heroine, pushing a mate out of the way of the car. I just hope the driver is caught soon.”</p>
      <p>West Yorkshire Police confirmed that a 22-year-old man and a 21-year-old woman were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder but were later released.</p>
      <p>The incident happened at 1.35am on Saturday 23 November in Leeds, West Yorkshire.</p>
