      <p><a href="https://www.magneticmag.com/tag/galcher-lustwerk/">Galcher Lustwerk</a> has released his new album <i>Information</i> via <a href="https://www.magneticmag.com/tag/ghostly/">Ghostly<i> </i>International</a>.</p>
      <p>The Cleveland, Ohio native, but Brooklyn-based producer has come a long way this decade. He first broke through with <i>100% Galcher</i> in 2013 and has since refined his mesh of deep house and mellowed 80’s hip-house. With <i>Information</i>, he finds the right niche as we end the decade.</p>
      <p>The album is music for your bedside, to study to or to put in your headphones as the sun goes down on a sunny winter day. It is vibey, calming and still a kick of energy to keep it interesting and engaging.  </p>
      <p>The core of the record is subtle deep house basslines, while Lustwerk coos over the top with a hazy vision of the club and relationships with others. Swirling melodies help create smoke fantasies of the world around him.  </p>
      <p>The album isn’t entirely subdued and mellow beats – there is a funky bassline on “Bit,” some hard-hitting 808s carry “Fathomless Ire” and the instrumental interlude “Thermonics” plays on some jazzy elements. </p>
      <p><i>Information</i> catches Lustwerk at his best. This sort of calm deep house is becoming more and more popular with the likes of <a href="https://www.magneticmag.com/tag/channel-tres/">Channel Tres</a> also offering his own take on the sub-genre. The album is top heavy with the songs that may stick around in your playlists the longest, but it does find a nice groove in the middle, carrying it to the end. It is a perfect album for the cold winter months to warm you in a mellow, soothing embrace.</p>
