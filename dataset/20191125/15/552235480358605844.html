      <h1>McGill's bus strike called off after 11th-hour crisis talks</h1>
      <h2>Unite said they were confident that a settlement could be reached and axed three planned days of 24-hour strikes.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T15:36:31+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 15:36</time> by <a rel="author">Andrea Lambrou, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/andrea-lambrou/</a></address>
      <p>McGill’s staff halted strike action planned for today after 11th-hour crisis talks with company bosses.</p>
      <p>Unite called off three days of industry action expected today, December 2 and December 9, after emergency talks started to show progress.</p>
      <p>Drivers, shunters and labourers were due to walk out over a pay dispute affecting the company’s ex-Arriva staff.</p>
      <p>Union reps said former Arriva workers were being paid eight to 14 per cent less than their McGill’s counterparts.</p>
      <p>The Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (Acas) facilitated a meeting with the union and McGill’s bosses yesterday in an effort to resolve the pay row.</p>
      <p>They will now take part in further discussions in the hope of reaching a settlement.</p>
      <p>Kenny Jordan, Unite regional industrial officer, said: “Following discussions through Acas, Unite are confident that a settlement can be reached.</p>
      <p>“This, therefore, removed the need for industrial action.”</p>
      <p>The dispute comes as a result of a transfer in 2011.</p>
      <p>Around 50 transferred members have remained on Arriva Scotland West contracts and been subjected to successive pay freezes, while the pre-existing McGill’s workers, through several pay increases, have now shot ahead of the ex-Arriva staff.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, Unite told the Express members had requested a review but the firm was “adamant” that parity would only be achieved if ex-Arriva staff changed their contracts.</p>
      <p>However, staff were unwilling to give up agreements in their current contracts, including a better sick pay scheme.</p>
      <p>The union maintains that former Arriva staff have been lagging behind on pay.</p>
      <p>After voting for strike action, Mr Jordan told the Express: “Unite’s members who previously worked for Arriva have been extremely patient and accepted that McGill’s rates had to catch up.</p>
      <p>“However, this position has been used as a cover by management to suppress the wages of around 50 of our members for eight years which is not acceptable.</p>
      <p>“The strong mandate we have received for industrial action is a reflection of the anger and injustice felt by the workers.”</p>
      <p>McGill’s management would not comment at this stage but a spokesman told the Express that bus services were expected to run as scheduled.</p>
