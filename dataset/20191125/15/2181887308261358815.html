      <h1>Huawei launches French legal action over government link claims</h1>
      <h2>Hopefully practice for suing Trump</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T15:06:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 15:06</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theinquirer.net/author/profile/2960/chris-merriman" target="_blank">Chris Merriman</a></address>
      <p><b>HUAWEI HAS HAD</b> all it can stand, and it can't stand no more.</p>
      <p>After months of defending itself against the world's barbs, suggesting that it is <a href="https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/3078094/huawei-staff-accused-of-working-with-china-military-on-ai-comms-research">in league with the Chinese government</a>, the embattled Chinese tech firm has decided to roll out a new product using France as a test market.</p>
      <p>The product in question is called "Sue the b*stards!" and is rolling out now to three unwitting beta testers (aka media commentators) who have seen fit to accuse Huawei of being a security nightmare - a journalist, a telecoms expert and a researcher.</p>
      <p>The news was first broken earlier this week by investigative journalists as<i> La Lettre A</i>, and later confirmed by Huawei itself.</p>
      <p>Apparently, the court filing was made back in March, nearly three months before the company was added to the so-called ‘Entity List' in the US, triggering an effective ban on trading with US companies.</p>
      <p>Huawei said that the court case will "concern only statements that Huawei is a company controlled by the Chinese State and the Chinese Communist Party, led by a former member of the ‘counter-intelligence' and using its technological expertise in telecom networks to commit acts of espionage against the Western world."</p>
      <p>"These statements are false," it added, just in case you were getting lost as to what its stance is.</p>
      <p>At a time when Huawei is still on a charm offensive as it finds a way to be a part of the 5G rollout across the world, it seems slightly odd to go after critics in just one country (though it is making us fact-check even more stringently than usual), especially given that the country in question actually agreed to let Huawei supply non-core parts of the network.</p>
      <p>It's not quite clear why Huawei has chosen France to take action, given the amount of <a href="https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/2203005/huawei-denies-chinese-espionage-claims">smack that has been spoken about it</a> over the past year following the arrest of Chief Financial Officer and daughter of founder, Meng Wanzhou, last December on espionage charges.</p>
      <p>Further accusations about Huawei's links to the Chinese authorities were made in France as recently as this week. μ</p>
