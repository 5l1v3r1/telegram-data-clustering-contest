      <h1>Strictly Come Dancing's Amy Dowden had a 'tearful meltdown backstage' after slumping into bottom two</h1>
      <h2>She reportedly had to be consoled backstage after 'bursting into tears'</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T15:32:11+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 15:32</time> by <a rel="author">Robert Leigh</a></address>
      <p>Strictly pro Amy Dowden was reportedly "utterly devastated" to find herself in the bottom two of <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/strictly-come-dancing/">the BBC One dancing competition</a> on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>Amy and her celebrity partner Karim Zeroual survived the Sunday evening dance off <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/strictly-come-dancing/strictly-come-dancing-aj-pritchard-and-saffron-barker-begged-bosses-to-let-them-skip-the-samba/">opposite Saffron Barker and AJ Pritchard</a>, who were booted off the show.</p>
      <p>But, according to a tabloid report, 28-year-old Amy had to be consoled backstage after 'bursting into tears' when the cameras weren't pointed at them.</p>
      <p>An unnamed TV insider is reported to have told <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/">the Mirror</a>: "Amy was utterly devastated that they were in the dance off. Karim had to reassure her and was rubbing her back while they were waiting to perform.</p>

      <p>"After they were voted through and the cameras were off them, Amy burst into tears and was comforted by fellow pro dancer Neil Jones, who kept telling her 'It's not your fault'.</p>
      <p>"She seemed to be blaming herself a lot for the situation they were in."</p>

      <p>The slump into the elimination spots represented a dramatic fall for the dancing couple, who were joint top of the leaderboard the week before in Blackpool.</p>
      <p>Amy looked downcast as they waited for the judges’ verdict - and had hugged Karim tightly just moments earlier as they put in the dance off performance they hoped would save them from the chop.</p>

      <p>In an Instagram post shared with her fans last night, Amy admitted their limits had been tested - and hinted the dance off had taken a toll.</p>
      <p>However, she also noted she "loved every second" of the past week.</p>
      <p>"Emotional weekend for myself and lovely partner @karim__zeroual," Amy captioned an image of them both.</p>
      <p>She continued: "Karim you couldn’t have done anymore, you were YOU on that floor and I’m so proud.</p>

      <p>Amy added: "Being in a dance off is so tough and I’m so proud of your focus and emotional but determined performance.</p>
      <p>"Thank you to the judges for saving us, we are so grateful to be back performing In the quarter final."</p>
