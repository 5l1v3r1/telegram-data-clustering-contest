      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/category/finance-news-microfinance-1030104.htm">Microfinance </a>industry's gross loan portfolio (GLP) grew by 47.85 per cent to Rs 2.01 lakh crore in the quarter ended September 30, 2019, compared to that of Rs 1.36 lakh crore in the year-ago quarter, says a report.</p>
      <p>In the second quarter ended September 2019, the total number of <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/category/finance-news-microfinance-1030104.htm">microfinance </a>loan accounts were at 9.79 crore as compared to 7.43 crore account in the year-ago period, according to a quarterly report by <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/category/finance-news-microfinance-1030104.htm">Microfinance </a>Institutions Network (MFIN).</p>

      <p>"In the last thirty months, an additional 18.3 million women have taken microfinance loans. This growth in unique borrowers is an endorsement of the unstinted trust that small borrowers have reposed on all RBI-regulated microfinance institutions," MFIN's chief executive Harsh Srivastava said.</p>

      <p>The top 10 states constitute 82.7 per cent in terms of GLP.</p>

      <p>Banks hold the largest share of the portfolio in micro-credit with a total loan outstanding of Rs 80,570 crore, which is 40 per cent of the total micro-credit universe.</p>
      <p>NBFC-MFIs are the second largest provider of micro- credit with a loan amount outstanding of Rs 62,960 crore, accounting for 31 per cent to total industry portfolio.</p>
      <p>Small <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/finance">Finance </a>Banks (SFBs) have a total loan amount outstanding of Rs 34,829 crore with a total share of 17 per cent, NBFCs 11 per cent with a total loan outstanding of Rs 21,381 and other MFIs account for one per cent share in the microfinance universe.</p>
