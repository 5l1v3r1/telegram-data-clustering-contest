      <h1>Club to make contact with Arsenal in January – Transfer fee proving to be issue</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T15:35:16+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 15:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/author/nihat-emre-kocaaslan/" target="_blank">Nihat Emre Kocaaslan</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.fanatik.com.tr/besiktasta-devre-arasi-operasyonu-2104147">Fanatik</a> claim Besiktas are already starting to plan for next season and they want to keep Arsenal loanee Mohamed Elneny.</p>
      <p>The Turkish side’s form has improved dramatically in the past two months, and they’ve picked up 16 points from a possible 18 in their last six games.</p>
      <p>They’ve conceded just one goal during this period, which has been helped by Elneny’s partnership with Atiba Hutchinson in the heart of midfield.</p>
      <p>The Egyptian has formed a great partnership with the Besiktas veteran and subsequently Fanatik report the Black Eagles are looking to keep him beyond this season.</p>
      <p>It’s reported Besiktas will make contact with Arsenal in January with regards to loaning him for another season because they don’t have the funds to activate the €16m redemption clause.</p>
      <p>The 27 year old’s contract with Arsenal will expire at the end of June 2022, but it’s likely he’ll struggle to get games with the Gunners if he returns next summer.</p>
