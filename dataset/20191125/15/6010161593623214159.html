      <h1>Myterious sci-fi MMO Project C now has a new name: Life Beyond</h1>

      <p>Darewise Entertainment’s Project C got a name change.</p>
      <p>Life Beyond is the official name of the upcoming sci-fi MMO <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2018/08/01/project-c-mmo-preview-spatialos-improbable/">once known only as Project C</a>.</p>
      <p>Described as a combination of Eve Online, a third-person action game, and an immersive sim, in Life Beyond players explore a planet called Corvus where they develop new societies and make individual and collective decisions that impact the game.</p>
      <p>Life Beyond will be a cross-platform title available on PC, mobile, Xbox One and PS4. The game uses Improbable’s SpatialOS to enable an “unprecedented level of simulation in the game world,” according to the independent studio Darewise.</p>
