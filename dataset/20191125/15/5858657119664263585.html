      <p>SURREY (NEWS 1130) — The Surrey Board of Trade doesn’t see any benefits for implementing a canal in the city.</p>
      <p>CEO Anita Huberman says a new canal in Bridgeview won’t help local businesses or the economy.</p>
      <p>“There needs to be a business plan and what the implications will be or won’t be to either residents or businesses in terms of their taxes, and we’ve heard nothing of that,” she says.</p>
      <p>On top of that, she raises doubts a canal will be built within the next five years, as there is no mention of the project in the capital budget.</p>
      <p>“It’s very difficult to come up with a concept that has no business plan,” she explains.</p>
      <p>Huberman adds there are many complexities of large infrastructure projects including the environmental impacts on climate change and sea levels along with impacts to existing infrastructure.</p>
      <p>“[The Surrey Board of Trade] is actually calling for more art and culture investments to make Surrey a music city destination – an art and culture destination. We need that infrastructure as well,” she says, adding business plans exist for these ideas.</p>
      <p>Huberman points towards building a new performing arts centre and a convention centre instead since Surrey is on track for being the largest city in the province.</p>
