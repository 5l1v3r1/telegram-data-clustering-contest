      <h1>Week 13 Fantasy PPR Rankings: Tight end</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T15:09:39+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 15:09</time> by <a rel="author">Billy Heyen</a></address>
      <p>Mark Andrews was the biggest question mark for me as I altered our Week 13 fantasy PPR TE rankings. The Ravens take on the 49ers in Week 13, a team that just shut down Aaron Rodgers and the Packers. As Lamar Jackson showed against New England, this Baltimore offense isn't easy to shut down, but there are reasons to worry about Andrews. Some of his most crucial fantasy volume comes in the red zone, andif the Ravens aren't there as much, maybe he doesn't do much. Add that to the fact that he comes off the field on a lot of plays, and Andrews could truly be a Week 13 bust. You almost certainly aren't sitting him, but in a stacked week at tight end, there are other options.</p>
      <p>Andrews might've been a guy you picked up off the waiver wire earlier in the season, so maybe he's not your only tight end. Some of you are surely waiting for the injury returns of Austin Hooper (knee) and Evan Engram (foot). Thanksgiving night looks like it might be too soon for Hooper, but Engram probably has a chance to be back Sunday for a great tight end matchup with the Packers.</p>

      <p>If you've been holding on to Eric Ebron (ankle), you can cut ties with him. The Colts placed him on Injured Reserve, a maneuver which frees Jack Doyle up for a boost in fantasy value, especially in PPR leagues where he already had a bit more use than in standard leagues.</p>
      <p>Two of the best tight end matchups this week come from players with Buffalo ties. Former Bills TE Nick O'Leary is in Jacksonville now and looks like the Jags' first-choice tight end. When the Jaguars take on Tampa Bay in Week 13, the only player with a better fantasy matchup is widely owned Rams TE Gerald Everett. We also like the current Buffalo tight end this week, as Dawson Knox takes on a fantasy-friendly Cowboys defense in the middle game on Thanksgiving.</p>

      <p>Speaking of Thanksgiving -- tight ends seem to just fit the holiday, don't they? They're thekind of offensive player you invite to your gathering only to have them eat basically all the turkey. Surely one or two will go off on Thursday (we're looking at you with a lot of longing but not a lot of belief, T.J. Hockenson), but either way, there are plenty of possibilities this week.</p>
