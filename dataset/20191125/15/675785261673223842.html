      <h1>Jose Mourinho's reaction to Roy Keane bluntly telling Man Utd to sign Harry Kane</h1>
      <h2>Back in October Red Devils legend Roy Keane bluntly announced in the Sky Sports studio that Manchester United should go out and sign the Premier League's best forward, Harry Kane</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T15:55:39+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 15:55</time> by <a rel="author">Jake Polden, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/jake-polden/</a></address>
      <p>Jose Mourinho looked on with a grin in October when Roy Keane bluntly announced in the Sky Sports studio that <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> should "just go and get Harry Kane".</p>
      <p>The Red Devils were struggling in front of goal at the time, and Gary Neville and Graeme Souness became embroiled in a row over the club's decision to offload Romelu Lukaku.</p>
      <p>"[Mason] Greenwood at 17? That's how desperate Man United are," said Sounnes. "Go and get goalscorers who will win you games."</p>
      <p>Neville responded: "He had a goalscorer in Lukaku - he's a proven goalscorer at the highest level - he didn't want him." And Souness replied: "So that's been a smart decision to start the season without a replacement for him, wasn't it? Gary, it's Man United!"</p>

      <p>Former United right-back Neville hit back once more: "That's fine, but you're saying just get anyone in." And Souness concluded: "I'm saying a goalscorer, I'm not just saying anybody."</p>
      <p>Listening to the debate in front of him, Keane then piped up.</p>
      <p>He responded with a simple solution to the problem: "Go and get [Harry] Kane.</p>
      <p>"Just go and get Kane from Spurs, easy. He'll score 20 goals a season with his eyes shut. They're in disarray, so go and get him."</p>
      <p>His comment was met with silence as the rest of the room looked at him, prompting Keane to say: "I don't know what are you all staring at," which drew laughter from the pundits.</p>
      <p>Mourinho was sitting closest to Keane, and looked at the Irishman with a smirk on his face.</p>

      <p>Of course he had no idea he would seen become the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> boss, but his reaction to Keane hailing Kane the league's best striker speaks volumes following his Monday press conference.</p>
      <p>Ruling out signing Zlatan Ibrahimovic in January, Mourinho said: "Amazing player, amazing guy, but I would say no chance.</p>
      <p>"We have the best striker in England. It doesn't make sense to sign him when we have Harry Kane."</p>
