      <p>Fees for simpler and less formal cremations in <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/rhondda-cynon-taf">Rhondda Cynon Taf</a> will be cut to help people on low incomes struggling with funeral costs.</p>
      <p>Cabinet has approved a year-long pilot of a reduced cremation fee for funeral directors offering a “direct” or “simplicity” cremation in Rhondda Cynon Taf.</p>
      <p>The fee will be reduced to £560 from its current level of £710 and come into force from December 1 this year.</p>
      <p>Many funeral directors are now offering alternative options to families that are lower in cost and allow for those who wish to have a simpler, less formal funeral and these are known as “direct” or “simplicity” cremations.</p>
      <p>These involve a funeral director arranging a service with no mourners and bringing the body directly to the crematorium with no religious service or attendees.</p>
      <p>The cabinet report says funeral costs have increased substantially and are becoming increasingly unaffordable to those on the lowest incomes.</p>
      <p>The fees and charges to the family are significantly less with direct or simplicity cremations making the service more affordable, particularly for those on low incomes.</p>
      <p>Councillor Rhys Lewis, the cabinet member for well-being and cultural services, said at the cabinet meeting on Thursday, November 21: “We are offering a greater choice to residents.</p>
      <p>“There are often prohibitive costs and this will assist in that. There is an increasing demand [for direct cremations] which reflects changing tastes.”</p>
      <p>Research has shown that the cost of a funeral will come to nearly 40 per cent of the annual expenditure of someone on the lowest income.</p>
      <p>The option would be available at both Glyntaff and Llwydcoed crematoria.</p>
      <p>These services are already available at crematoria in <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/cardiff">Cardiff</a> , Margam, <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/swansea">Swansea</a> , <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/narberth">Narberth</a> , St Asaph, <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/colwyn-bay">Colwyn Bay</a> and the privately-run crematoria in the <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/vale-of-glamorgan">Vale of Glamorgan.</a></p>
      <p>The average cost of the essential elements of a funeral in the UK was estimated to be nearly £4,300 in 2018 with the costs coming in at £3,744 for a cremation and £4,798 for a burial.</p>
      <p>On average another £2,000 was spent on discretionary items such as flowers and catering.</p>
      <p>In Wales the average cost of a burial is £3,934 and the average cost for a cremation is £3,142.</p>
