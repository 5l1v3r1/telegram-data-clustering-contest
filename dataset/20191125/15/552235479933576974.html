      <h1>Wrestling stars ready to rumble in Dumbarton showdown</h1>
      <h2>PBW are returning to the Concord Centre for a second action-packed event of the year.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T15:32:12+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 15:32</time> by <a rel="author">Fraser Clarke, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/fraser-clarke/</a></address>
      <p>Some of Scotland’s biggest wrestling stars come to Dumbarton this weekend, as the Concord Centre hosts its second action-packed event of the year.</p>
      <p>PBW are organising Saturday’s showdown, which will see BBC star Jack Jester take on the High Flying Dylan Angel, whilst Stevie Xavier - just back from a try out with WWE – will defend his PBW title against Bad Boy Liam Thomson.</p>
      <p>BT Gunn, another former PBW champion, will also be in action - taking on the 2019 King of Crusiers Leyton Buzzard.</p>
      <p>However aside from the headlines PBW owner Ross Watson is looking forward to seeing two young guns in action.</p>
      <p>He told the Lennox Herald: “We’ll have a lot of experienced wrestlers there but we also have a lot of the younger guys from the academy to see how they do; I’m really looking forward to seeing how Alex Parker and Danny Edwards get on.</p>
      <p>“I’m excited to see how the fans take to the new wrestlers, we’ve had other wrestlers like Noam Dar and Kenny Williams who have been involved with us when they were younger and are now signed with WWE.</p>
      <p>“It’s in the name of the competition. I like to push the young, homegrown talent.”</p>
      <p>And it’s the opportunity to meet potential WWE stars of the future that Ross believes helps to make PBW events so appealing to wrestling mad families.</p>
      <p>He continued: “If you go to one of those bigger shows at the Hydro or if you see the shows on TV then it lacks the intimacy, the show ends and everyone is away quickly to get out of the car park.</p>
      <p>“I pride myself on our shows not being like that.</p>
      <p>“At the end we do a meet and greet for the kids to meet the wrestlers, get a picture or get a poster signed - that sort of thing.</p>
      <p>“We’ve been a gateway for some of the stars of the future so it could be an opportunity to meet people before they’re famous.”</p>
      <p>And he reserved special praise for the Dumbarton crowds.</p>
      <p>Ross added: “Since PBW started coming to Dumbarton in 2008 we’ve had two shows a year here and it’s one of the towns that I enjoy going to most.</p>
      <p>“The atmosphere was incredible and we knew it had to come there from now on.”</p>
      <p>The doors to Saturday’s event open at 7pm, with tickets £14 for adults and £10 for children and available on the door.</p>
