      <h1>Dean Smith epitomises the new positive feeling at Aston Villa after years of instability</h1>
      <h2>The popular manager led his side into the top flight last season after a three year absence and there is hope that the good times can continue at Villa Park</h2>

      <p>A very successful football club has its constituent parts working in harmony.</p>
      <p>Like a fine male-voice choir – ­supporters, players, the manager and owner – all need to be singing off the same hymn sheet.</p>
      <p>If one of those is flat, then the whole sound is distorted.</p>
      <p>Until very recently, something had been distinctly out of tune for a very long time at Aston Villa.</p>
      <p>For instance, a number of ­managers had been at loggerheads with the club’s late owner, Doug Ellis (Ron ­Atkinson and John Gregory).</p>
      <p>Or else the owner himself was ­clueless (Randy Lerner and Tony Xia).</p>

      <p>Or else the players weren’t good enough (this list is WAY too long).</p>
      <p>Or the manager wasn’t (Tim ­Sherwood and Remi Garde).</p>
      <p>Or else the supporters didn’t really like the manager (Alex McLeish and Steve Bruce).</p>
      <p>Or... well, you get the picture.</p>
      <p>Very fleetingly, such as when ­Martin O’Neill was being allowed to benefit from the size of Lerner’s ­wallet, has Villa Park been a haven of peace and tranquility.</p>
      <p>Just over one decade ago, the ­manager was at the top of his game.</p>
      <p>The players were at the top of theirs. The chairman of the day was enthusiastic, monied – gullible – and the supporters lapped it up.</p>

      <p>When the Irishman walked out on the eve of the 2010 season, the club imploded – and it’s only thanks to the generosity of the current owners that it is back on the radar once again.</p>
      <p>Since Nassef Sawaris and Wes Edens rode into Birmingham on their white chargers 16 months ago, more than £250million was spent on Aston Villa. Yet this morning Villa sit on the fringes of the relegation zone after more than one-third of the season.</p>
      <p>But this time, it’s different.</p>
      <p>There are no calls for the owners to dig deep, as there were with Ellis.</p>
      <p>The manager isn’t agitating with the owner. The players are finding their feet and will improve – and the supporters are back onside.</p>
      <p>Yet the sight of the top-flight table will be unsettling the owners and chief executive Christian Purslow.</p>
      <p>But what they must be told from the lessons of history is that changing the manager isn’t the way forward.</p>
      <p>They tried that once with Garde. It didn’t end well.</p>
      <p>Villa play Newcastle tonight, then a rapidly improving ­Man United and upwardly mobile Leicester City.</p>

      <p>It could get worse before it gets ­better. But keeping faith with the manager who earned them their crack at the big time is imperative.</p>
      <p>Dean Smith is one of Villa’s own.</p>
      <p>Sure, there are one or two social media moaners who are agitating, but the rank and file have someone in this manager they can warm to.</p>
      <p>He took over at a difficult time, ­improved on-field results, carried the fans with him and oversaw a tricky transition in constructing a team that can hold its own in a higher league.</p>
      <p>Smith also has a commitment to playing football on the front foot and knows exactly what the fans want – after all, he is one.</p>
      <p>For the first time in a long time, Aston Villa is stable. The only way that it can be shaken is by a knee-jerk reaction in the boardroom.</p>
      <p>And, in that respect, forget the choir and the singing – silence has to be golden.</p>
