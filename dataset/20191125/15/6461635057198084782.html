      <h3>Barcelona may secure Borussia Dortmund superstar Jadon Sancho after the forward was left feeling “humiliated and frustrated”</h3>
      <p>Barcelona along with other European giants, such as Liverpool, Real Madrid and Manchester United, are keeping an eye on the player’s situation at BVB.</p>
      <p><a href="https://theathletic.com/1403402/2019/11/24/exclusive-jadon-sancho-feels-humiliated-and-scapegoated-by-dortmund-amid-interest-from-barcelona-liverpool-united-and-real/"><b>The Athletic</b></a> claims that the English international is frustrated with his situation at the German club. The winger was fined by the club for arriving late from his international duties.</p>
      <p>The 19-year-old was recently substituted in the first half of the clubs clash with domestic rivals, Bayern Munich, due to his performance. Borussia’s sporting director Michael Zorc has also publically criticized the Englishman.</p>
      <p>The clubs executive Hans-Joachim has reportedly asked the youngster about a possibility of a transfer in the January transfer window, and the forward has insisted that he wants to remain with the club. However, it possible the player’s mentality towards the transfer has changed with recent events coming to light.</p>
      <p>Regardless of the current situation, the forward has managed to score 4 goals in 10 appearances this Bundesliga season along with providing another six. Manchester United and Liverpool are keeping a close eye on the youngster’s situation, and the two Spanish giants have also showed their interests.</p>
      <p>Barca can use the 19-year-old’s services to strengthen their attack as they are looking for a long term replacement for the aging frontline at Catalonia. If Kylian Mbappe or Neymar transfer speculations do not go in the favor of the Spanish Champions, then Sancho is surely a cheaper and great alternative for the duo.</p>
      <p>Jadon’s arrival could see the struggling Dembele lose his spot in the attacking trio but also creates a possibility of a swap deal between the two clubs. Dembele being a former Dortmund player might push this idea into a reality.</p>
      <p>Could Jadon Sancho solve Barcelona’s attacking problems?</p>
