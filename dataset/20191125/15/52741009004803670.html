      <p>Montreal's archdiocese has hired a former Quebec Superior Court justice to investigate the case of a priest found guilty of sexually abusing two boys.</p>
      <p>Pepita G. Capriolo will conduct the independent investigation into Rev. Brian Boucher, a priest who was sentenced in March to eight years behind bars.</p>
      <p>The archdiocese says in a statement it wants to get to the bottom of how the complaints and concerns about Boucher were handled.</p>
      <p>Boucher worked in 10 Montreal-area churches between 1985 and 2015.</p>
      <p>The abuse took place at two churches, between 1995 and 1999 in the case of one victim and between 2008 and 2011 in the other.</p>
      <p>Capriolo will need to determine a timeline of who knew what and come up with recommendations to improve procedures.</p>
      <p>The diocese also says it is looking for a someone to conduct an audit of its archives after another retired judge appointed to do so in March died in July.</p>
      <p>But it elected to name Capriolo to the Boucher probe so as not to delay it further.</p>
      <p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published Nov. 25, 2019.</p>
