      <h1>Iran online dissident shot dead in Istanbul</h1>

      <p><b>ISTANBUL: </b>An Iranian man who ran an opposition social media site was gunned down earlier this month in Istanbul, local media reported on Monday.</p>
      <p>Massoud Molavi, said to be in his mid-30s, was murdered on the street while walking with a friend in the Sisli district of Istanbul on November 14, according to the DHA news agency.</p>
      <p>Bullet casings were found at the scene. CCTV footage, released by another agency, IHA, appeared to show the moment of the killing.</p>
      <p>Molavi helped run a channel on Telegram called “Black Box”, which published corruption allegations against members of the government, judiciary and intelligence services, and claimed to have contacts within the Revolutionary Guards.</p>

      <p>Turkish police told DHA that investigations were ongoing, and that they had no information at present on Molavi’s background.</p>
      <p>Iran’s intelligence services are known to have a sizeable presence in neighbouring Turkey, where many exiled Iranians live, and many more come on vacation.</p>
      <p>In April 2017, the owner of a leading Persian-language satellite entertainment channel, GEM TV, was shot dead in his car by unknown individuals in Istanbul.</p>
      <p>Said Karimian was a British citizen of Iranian origin, and ran GEM TV from Dubai, offering Western programmes to Persian-speaking audiences, including US game shows and Turkish soaps.</p>
