      <p>Maura Higgins became an absolute icon when she starred on ITV’s Love Island earlier this year.</p>
      <p>The Longford beauty became a beloved personality by fans in the U.K and Ireland alike.</p>
      <p>Today, the model celebrates her 29th birthday, and to mark the occasion, Goss.ie have put together a list of the star’s best moments so far.</p>
      <p>

      <p>When Maura Higgins from Longford made her entrance to the Love Island villa, we were all in awe.</p>
      <p>As she was introduced to us for the first time, the model strutted her way onto the show and into our hearts.</p>
      <p>Entering as a bombshell, she was set to be a fiesty addition to the series from the get-go.</p>
      <p>
        <b>When she became a feminist icon</b>

      <p>With praise from Amy Schumer and Lena Dunham, Maura’s status as a feminist icon was secured when she spoke openly about sexuality.</p>
      <p>But, she also stuck it to the man when her love interest on the show Tom Walker tried to slut-shame her.</p>
      <p>“It’ll be interesting to see if she’s all mouth or not,” Tom uttered to the rest of the boys when Maura invited him for a night in the hideaway.</p>
      <p>Maura, understandably, told Tom where to go.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Her magazine cover debut on Grazia </b>

      <p>Maura landed her first magazine cover when she featured in Grazia Magazine.</p>
      <p>The Love Island star stripped back her make-up for her debut magazine interview.</p>
      <p>Speaking on her villa experiences, Maura opened up to the publication about being misjudged her whole life.</p>
      <p>Maura said: “I think people look at my Instagram and think of me as a completely different person – because when I meet people out, they always say, ‘You’re so much nicer than I expected.'”</p>
      <p>
        <b>Her debut appearance on The Late Late Show</b>

      <p>Presenter of the show, Ryan Tubridy was thrilled with himself when he bagged his dream guest for The Late Late Show.</p>
      <p>Appearing alongside fellow Islander Greg O’Shea, Maura gave the nation what they wanted when she was interviewed on the show.</p>
      <p>Her adoring public lapped up every second of the interview and were thrilled when her beau Curtis Pritchard also made an appearance on the show.</p>
      <p>

      <p>We bet Tom is just fuming with himself that he ruined things with our Maura, and we wouldn’t blame him.</p>
      <p>But that’s his loss, Maura not only bagged the man she had her eye on from the start of the show, but she’s also now his girlfriend.</p>
      <p>When she left the show in 4th place, Maura and Curtis Pritchard really took things slow and kept fans on the edge of their seat when it came to wondering if they had made their relationship official.</p>
      <p>Eventually, the couple revealed they were finally together, during a very romantic photoshoot for OK! Magazine.</p>

        <b>When she gave representation to rural accents</b>

      <p>Maura Higgins has a really distinct accent, one which is not usually heard in mainstream media.</p>
      <p>And every time the Longford girl opens her mouth, she’s representing for those who don’t hear their local lilts on TV and radio.</p>
      <p>The star is unapologetically herself and has even landed a role presenting a podcast called Get The Scoop for Boohoo.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Coining the iconic term Fanny Flutters</b>
      </p>

      <p>Maura Higgins brought the term “fanny flutters” to a wider audience when she used it to describe how she felt upon meeting hunky Islander Tommy Fury.</p>
      <p>And let’s be honest, the second she said it, we all knew what she meant.</p>
      <p>While she tried her best to woo him with her sultry eyes, it was not to be as Tommy already had eyes on Molly-Mae Hague.</p>
      <p>It worked out ok in the end though, as Tommy and Molly and Maura and Curtis are the only remaining couples from this year’s show.</p>

      <p>When the 29-year-old announced she would be starring on Dancing on Ice in early 2020, fans were delighted.</p>
      <p>The show will not only propel the Irish star even further into the limelight, but it will also give us the opportunity to see her back on our television screens.</p>

      <p>Not only has Maura announced a fashion edit with Boohoo, but she has also launched a sexy campaign with Ann Summers.</p>
      <p>The Be More Maura campaign encourages women to be more like Maura, when it comes to their confidence and sexuality.</p>

      <p>With so many people showing up to meet her, the shopping center was flooded with people.</p>
