      <h3>Barcelona set to go with makeshift defense ahead of crucial Champions League clash.</h3>
      <p>Barcelona find themselves in a precarious situation defensively ahead of their match against Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League.</p>
      <p>The Catalan side is set to be without a number of their first-choice defenders and concerns whether others will be able to recover from their injuries in time.</p>
      <p>Gerard Pique is set to miss the game serving a suspension for accumulation of yellow cards.</p>
      <p>Nelson Semedo suffered an injury a few weeks back and is still has a few weeks left until he returns. Same for <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2861488-jordi-alba-reportedly-facing-month-out-after-injury-in-barcelona-vs-slavia"><b>Jordi Alba</b></a> who suffered an injury in their match against Slavia Prague.</p>
      <p>With both starting fullbacks out, Junior Firpo and Moussa Wague played in Barcelona’s win over the weekend against Leganes.</p>
      <p>Fortunately for Ernesto Valverde, Sergi Roberto will be back as he missed the Leganes match due to suspension. Expect Roberto to be deployed as the starting right-back midweek.</p>
      <p>Besides the fullbacks, the other concern has to do with the center-backs.</p>
      <p>As mentioned, Pique is suspended but the other question mark has to do with the availability of Clement Lenglet.</p>
      <p>He, too, missed their last fixture after picking up a calf injury. The team got some good news with regards to Lenglet as the Frenchman was <a href="https://www.mundodeportivo.com/futbol/fc-barcelona/20191125/471846936710/lenglet-vuelve-a-entrenarse-con-el-grupo.html"><b>back in training</b></a>. Whether he’ll start will be up to Valverde.</p>
      <p>Samuel Umtiti was able to take advantage of Lenglet’s injury and started against Leganes and had a good performance. Ability has never been a question for Umtiti. Rather the knee injury is what’s kept him sidelines. If he stays healthy, he should play against Dortmund regardless of whether Lenglet is deemed fit.</p>
      <p>Should he be deemed fit, the likely partnership should be Lenglet and Umtiti. But Jean-Clair Todibo and Ronald Araujo are also options. Araujo was called up to the first team and was preferred over Todibo who has been rumored with a <a href="https://www.sport-english.com/en/news/barca/barca-are-looking-to-sell-todibo-to-bayer-leverkusen-in-january-7744445"><b>move away</b></a> to Bayer Leverkusen.</p>
      <p>With the draw against Slavia Prague, Barcelona have put themselves in a less than envious position.</p>
      <p>Had they won, Lenglet would not need to be rushed back and the younger defenders could have received playing time.</p>
      <p>Now, because they are only a point in front of Dortmund, Valverde will need to field a strong line-up. The defense has long been a concern this season. Considering how poor Barcelona have looked in the Champions League, expect the defense to once again be under a microscope.</p>
