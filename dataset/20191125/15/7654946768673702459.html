      <p>Forty-two people – including actor Sam Waterston – were charged with disorderly conduct after a climate change protest during Saturday’s Ivy League football showdown between Yale and Harvard.</p>
      <p>Waterston, 79, was among the hundreds of students and alumni from the two universities who <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/23/ivy-league-climate-activists-break-up-harvard-yale-football-game/">took over the field at halftime during the Yale Bowl</a> in New Haven, Connecticut, prompting a 40-minute delay, <a href="https://www.ctpost.com/politics/article/Sam-Waterston-among-42-arrested-at-Yale-football-14859076.php">the Connecticut Post reported.</a></p>
      <p>Some of those who rushed onto the field with Waterston, meanwhile, noticed the “Law and Order” star and praised his activism in real time.</p>
      <p>“He’s really cool — unlike those other BOOMERS,” one protester, Dhilan R., <a href="https://twitter.com/DhilanR/status/1198347613441069056">tweeted</a> from midfield.</p>
      <p>The Academy Award-nominated actor graduated from Yale in 1962 and is believed to be the oldest person who was cited with misdemeanor disorderly conduct during the demonstration, according to Nora Heaphy, a junior at the university who helped organize the event.</p>
      <p>“We reached out to him ahead of time because he had been involved in the Green New Deal protests,” Heaphy told the Connecticut Post.</p>
      <p>Waterston was also arrested at a climate change protest last month in Washington, where he was <a href="https://pagesix.com/2019/10/25/jane-fonda-ted-danson-arrested-during-climate-change-protest/?_ga=2.251873417.1085129587.1574682648-2.156247803.1926118688.1559045588-275125024.1556107745">detained by police alongside his “Grace and Frankie” co-star Jane Fonda</a>.</p>
      <p>The actor said he hoped his participation would “give some heart to the great majority of us who know we are in the middle of a climate emergency,” <a href="https://www.facebook.com/FossilFreeYale/photos/a.139150042913785/1413775362117907/?type=3&amp;theater">according to a statement posted on Facebook by Fossil Free Yale</a>, one of the groups behind the protest.</p>
      <p>“You don’t get to have the facts, the truth, and the right on your side every day,” Waterston’s statement read. “This is one of those days.”</p>
      <p>The protesters held banners calling on both universities – which have combined endowments of $70 billion — to divest their holdings in companies that produce and sell fossil fuels.</p>

      <p>Other students and alumni also called on Yale and Harvard to divest from private prisons and Puerto Rican debt, <a href="https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2019/11/23/yale-and-harvard-students-delay-second-half-of-the-game/">the Yale Daily News reported.</a></p>
      <p>“Students are tired of Harvard and Yale profiting off of climate destruction and neocolonial investments in Puerto Rico’s debt,” a statement by student group Divest Harvard read.  “It’s time for more than lip service and greenwashing from academic leaders. Harvard and Yale must address the climate emergency at the scale and with the urgency it demands. This action is only the beginning.”</p>
      <p>Yale officials said the university “stands firmly for the right to free expression,” <a href="https://news.yale.edu/2019/11/23/statement-yale-regarding-yale-harvard-game-disruption">according to a statement released Saturday</a>.</p>
      <p>“It is regrettable that the orchestrated protest came during a time when fellow students were participating in a collegiate career-defining contest and an annual tradition when thousands gather from around the world to enjoy and celebrate the storied traditions of both football programs and universities,” the statement read.</p>
      <p>Harvard declined to comment on the protest, as well as the police activity during the event, a university spokeswoman told the Yale Daily News.</p>
      <p>Yale went on to defeat Harvard, 50-43, in double overtime to clinch the Ivy League championship after Saturday’s delay.</p>
