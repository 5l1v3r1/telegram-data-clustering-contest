      <p>Like several of its department store peers, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/kohls">Kohl’s</a> is struggling to regain traction in an uncertain retail landscape.</p>
      <p>The Wisconsin-based retailer reported disappointing earnings this week, missing Wall Street expectations with meager comparable sales growth of just 0.4%, while profits dropped by 24%, causing shares to tumble. Though the company hasn’t been shy to innovate – including testing off-price store models and teaming up with Amazon on an in-store return program – it seems it hasn’t been enough to stave off the ongoing retail apocalypse.</p>
      <p>“Department stores have been struggling for a long time, but they still generate billions of dollars,” Sucharita Kodali, vice president and principal analyst at Forrester, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/kohls-struggles-prove-department-store-model-dying-2019-11">told Business Insider earlier this week</a>. “That’s not going to evaporate overnight, but we’re still seeing this slow chipping away. Sometimes a well-executed program can help stave off the decline. Every quarter they have to pull a rabbit out of a hat.”</p>
      <p>While there may still be time for Kohl’s to turn the business around, it may never regain its early 2000s glory days of bustling stores and events brimming with notable celebrities. Still, the store has a significant national presence, with more than 1,100 stores in 49 states.</p>
      <p>Will Kohl’s overcome its struggles? Only time will tell. In the meantime, we took a look at Kohl’s rise from a small Midwestern chain started by a Polish immigrant to a national retail powerhouse.</p>

      <h3>Kohl’s was started in Brookfield, Wisconsin, by Maxwell Kohl in 1962.</h3>

      <p>Kohl <a href="https://www.ilctr.org/entrepreneur-hof/maxwell-kohl/">was a Polish immigrant</a> who had worked in factories in the US for several years before starting his first company, a small grocery store, at just 26 years old in 1927. The store included “modern-style supermarket” fixtures, like a bakery and deli. Kohl later went on to open 48 supermarkets in Wisconsin before selling the chain in 1970.</p>
      <p>Later, he was inspired to transition from the grocery industry to the department store business after experiencing difficulty buying a shirt.</p>

      <h3>Kohl modeled his department store after his grocery store chain, with a particular focus on customer service and finding efficiencies to help lower prices for shoppers.</h3>
