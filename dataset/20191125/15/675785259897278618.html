      <h1>Sky Sports and BT TV fixtures causing problems for clubs during mid-season break</h1>
      <h2>Premier League clubs are not yet able to plan for the mid-season break in February due to Sky Sports and BT still deciding on TV fixtures</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T15:52:17+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 15:52</time> by <a rel="author">Dan Gibbs</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/premier-league">Premier League</a> clubs face disruptions to proposed warm weather training camps with the TV fixtures for mid February still up in the air.</p>
      <p>For the first time in Premier League history there will be a winter break with a set of fixtures in February split over two weekends.</p>
      <p>That means teams will get a fortnight without playing a match.</p>
      <p>If you play on February 8, you don’t play the weekend after and so the next match will be on the 22nd.</p>
      <p>Currently, all 10 matches are listed as being played on February 8.</p>
      <p>But according to <a href="https://theathletic.co.uk/1398545/2019/11/25/ornstein-on-monday-raiola-complicates-united-pursuit-of-haaland-adidas-gives-mourinho-special-treatment-rogue-firms-exploit-premier-league-clubs-bruce-shelves-new-book/">The Athletic</a> , five of them won’t be moved to the weekend after following Sky and BT’s request to show them on TV.</p>

      <p>While the extended break is to ensure players are given a rest following a busy festive schedule, most managers opt to take their squads abroad for a training camp.</p>
      <p>However, because the clubs are still waiting on the TV broadcasts to agree a decision on which games will be shown, sides aren’t able to plan a destination for their trips.</p>
      <p>The fixtures are due to be announced in mid-December that will then lead to a frantic scramble to snap up the best facilities and accommodation.</p>
      <p>The likes of Dubai and Spain have been popular with managers in the past and the lack of planning is said to be frustrating managers who like to plan months ahead.</p>
      <p>The Athletic state that <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> vs <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> , Aston Villa vs <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> vs <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> will very likely play on the first weekend.</p>
      <p>Those sides taking part in Champions League should be given plenty of time to prepare for their last 16 first legs which are on the 18, 19, 25 or 26 February.</p>
      <p>Broadcasters then have the decision of who to show on live TV for the second weekend with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> vs <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Newcastle</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> vs <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> looking strong possibilities.</p>
