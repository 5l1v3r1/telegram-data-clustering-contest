      <p>Few super-villains are as sadistic and cruel as Carnage. The Marvel villain has recently made waves due to the <i>Absolute Carnage</i> event, but even leading up to that, Carnage was notorious for his intense sadism and cruelty. As a physical manifestation of anarchy and nihilism, this particular villain genuinely enjoys causing pain. With the events of <i>Absolute Carnage</i> pushing him to new plateaus of evisceration, however, something peculiar happened with Carnage: namely, that he might have gotten turned on by another man.</p>

      <p>That is not to say that Carnage is sexually attracted to Clayton Cortez, AKA Weapon H, but rather the he appreciates the way Hulk/Wolverine hybrid deals with pain. It's almost to the point where he enjoys it -- or at least can deal with being sliced open over and over again. And we know this because, in <a href="https://www.cbr.com/absolute-carnage-weapon-plus-1/"><i>Absolute Carnage: Weapon Plus</i></a>, the two cross paths, and Carnage admits he's "turned on" by how Weapon H seems to practically relish being shredded by him.</p>

      <h3>The Fight</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Who-Is-Weapon-H.jpg?q=50&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=963&amp;h=503&amp;dpr=1.5"/>
      </figure>
      <p>The fight takes place before the main events of <i>Absolute Carnage</i>. Weapon H is brought on by the rest of Weapon V's Mars Team to help fight off Carnage, who has started ripping out the spines of all who have ever come in contact with a symbiote in order to collect their Codexes, which are markings left behind on every former symbiote host.</p>
      <p>Weapon H serves as the muscle against Carnage when he comes to collect. The two are evenly matched in terms of sheer power -- a frightening possibility considering Weapon H possesses the strength of the Hulk. When Carnage manages to rip Weapon H open, however, he finds that his adversary is able to heal. This ability -- to experience pain over and over again without any lasting impact -- serves to sexually excite Carnage, who is a well-known sadist.</p>
      <p>The fight ultimately ends with Weapon H getting away with his life and Carnage almost allowing it so he can focus on his goals. However, this begs a question: was Cletus Kasady turned on by the bloodshed or was his symbiote attracted to the Hulk?</p>

      <h3>Cletus or Carnage?</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/carnage.jpg?q=50&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=963&amp;h=481&amp;dpr=1.5"/>

      <p>On one hand, Carnage's attraction to pain and suffering makes sense. Many serial killers get a sexual thrill from violence. In his early appearances, Cletus deliberately ripped his own flesh open to make graffiti on the walls from his blood. So it would follow that he would find gore and violence sexually arousing.</p>
      <p>At the same time, this is just one of many instances where symbiotes express an attraction toward Hulks. <a href="https://www.cbr.com/venom-ate-the-hulk/">In <i>What-If...?</i> #4</a>, Venom's symbiote merges with the Hulk. Venom manages to overtake the Hulk's will and actually undoes the gamma-radiated rage monster's influence over Bruce. He, in a very literal sense, consumes what makes the Hulk the Hulk. Then, in <i>Absolute Carnage</i>, Venom merges with the Hulk in order to assume a new, more powerful form. While Eddie retrieves the symbiote eventually, it clearly had a desire for the Hulk.</p>
      <p>So this opens the door to the possibility that Carnage's desire for Weapon H isn't solely the result of Cletus' sadism. It's entirely possible that the non-binary symbiote also affected Carnage, drawing him toward the new Hulk because of some genetic longing for his powerful gamma-irradiated body.</p>
      <p>Whatever the case, Carnage's declaration of arousal toward Weapon H will probably fuel some fan theories about Carnage's sexuality. Of course, that is ignoring the big elephant in the room: Carnage is drawn less by people and more by blood. It doesn't matter what gender you are. When Carnage slices you open, you'll lookÂ just as <i>gore</i>-gous to him.</p>
