      <h1>Texas backs out of the lawsuit to stop the T-Mobile and Sprint merger</h1>
      <h2>Fifteen attorneys general still hope to block the deal.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T15:07:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 15:07</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.engadget.com/editors/christine-fisher" target="_blank">Christine Fisher</a></address>
      <p>Texas no longer stands in the way of the T-Mobile and Sprint merger. The state has reached a settlement with T-Mobile, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton <a href="https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/news/releases/ag-paxton-announces-settlement-agreement-t-mobile-sprint-merger#.XdvwUsxDfKE.twitter">announced</a> today. In exchange for T-Mobile's commitment to build a 5G network throughout Texas, Paxton will drop the lawsuit he filed in August in an attempt to block the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/04/29/t-mobile-and-sprint-merger/">$26.5 billion deal</a>.</p>
      <p>The Federal Communications Commission <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/05/fcc-approves-t-mobile-sprint-merger/">formally approved</a> the T-Mobile-Sprint merger earlier this month, and it's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/07/26/t-mobile-sprint-merger-approved-department-of-justice/">been approved</a> by the Department of Justice. But attorneys general from 14 states and the District of Columbia still oppose the deal.</p>
      <p>As many as 25 attorneys general have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/18/t-mobile-sprint-pennsylvania/">filed similar lawsuits</a>, citing fears that the merger could hurt competition. But that number has been dropping. In addition to Texas, <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/t-mobile-and-sprint-win-over-another-state-but-their-merger-still-faces-its-biggest-hurdle-51570719690">Mississippi</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20925150/tmobile-sprint-merger-dish-network-colorado-attorney-general-lawsuit-fcc-doj">Colorado</a> are two of the most recent states to settled with T-Mobile.</p>
      <p>A trial is set to begin on December 9th in a Manhattan federal court, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sprint-m-a-tmobile/texas-settles-with-t-mobile-sprint-over-merger-statement-idUSKBN1XZ1VG"><i>Reuters</i></a> reports. It's likely T-Mobile will attempt to get the remaining AGs to change their minds, and it will be interesting to see who remains until the end.</p>
