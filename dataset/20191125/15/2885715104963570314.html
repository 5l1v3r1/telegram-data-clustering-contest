      <p>Austin’s first guest was Mark Calloway, (The Undertaker) and the two of the biggest stars in the history of wrestling spoke at length on a variety of topics, from how the the Undertaker saved his career during the Attitude Era, to whom he went for advice and the decision to end his WrestleMania streak.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Attitude Era</b>
      </p>
      <p>According to Undertaker, he wouldn’t have “made it through” to the Attitude Era if he hadn’t changed his gimmick in 2000. At a time when Undertaker’s dark character became a huge hit, The Phenom decided to take a risk and transform into the American Bad**s gimmick, which saw him performing as a tough and sadistic biker.</p>

      <p>Reflecting on it, Calloway said,””I always felt like, if I started feeling stale, my audience is probably feeling it before me. You get wrapped up in what you’re doing.”</p>
      <p>“So, the small changes, the breaks at the right time — but I don’t think I would had made it through if I hadn’t changed when I did to go to the American Badass,” he added.</p>
      <p>“The character — I don’t think — would have lasted through the Attitude Era,” the former World Heavyweight Champion noted.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Whom did the Undertaker go for advice?</b>
      </p>
      <p>“There was one guy… Jake [Roberts]. Not so much my delivery or what I said, but he had such insight into character. Jake ‘The Snake’ Roberts, man — brilliant mind. Unbelievable insight on how to put that character together and he would tell me like he would listen to Pink Floyd or he would listen to Black Sabbath which, you know that got me, ‘Okay I’m gonna get some heat for this’ I would look in the Bible for different verses. Back then it didn’t bother me as much to alter it around a little bit, you know who am I tell?,” Ringside News quoted Undertaker as saying.</p>

      <p>“So I started looking outside the box on how to put this character together and he would — he didn’t even tell me this, but I heard him tell ‘Once the music starts you are that person,’ you know I probably took it a step further because I stayed that person for the first five or six years, but he had so many good innovative ways to put things together and to look at different aspects of the business that no one got.”</p>
      <p>“Jake never was a screamer and that was something I knew I wasn’t gonna be. I knew it was gonna be a slow, methodical promo and then when Paul Bearer came along it was easy because he had that high-pitched creepy thing that got people and then I would come in with you know, ‘Rest In Peace.’”</p>
      <p>
        <b>The Streak</b>
      </p>
      <p>In a shocking revelation the Undertaker revealed he has no memory of the match against Brock Lesnar. ”What most people don’t know is that I got concussed during that match… I don’t remember anything about that night.” The last thing he remembered are incidents from 3:30 pm that afternoon. His next memory is 4:30 am at the hospital when nurses were asking for his name and if he knew where he was.</p>

      <p>Taker also revealed that he had seen the match so he knows what happened. However, no matter how many times he watches it back, he still can’t pinpoint when the concussion took place. The Deadman also said that it wasn’t Brock Lesnar’s fault but from that point on, he knew his career was on borrowed time.</p>
