      <h1>Mets hire Hensley Meulens as their bench coach</h1>

      <p>Carlos Beltran has his right-hand man.</p>
      <p>MLB Network reported on Monday <a href="https://twitter.com/JonHeyman/status/1198979363787747331">the Mets have hired Hensley Meulens as their bench coach.</a> The Post reported last Wednesday that <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/20/mets-interview-hensley-meulens-for-bench-coach-job/">the Mets interviewed Meulens</a> for the job.</p>
      <p>Meulens spent 10 years as Bruce Bochyâ€™s bench coach with the Giants, but moved on when Bochy stepped down and was replaced by Gabe Kapler this offseason. Meulens won three World Series championships alongside Bochy in San Francisco.</p>
      <p>Meulens, 52, will play a crucial role next to Beltran, who is in his first year managing after spending time in the Yankees front office.</p>
      <p>Meulens, like Beltran, was a candidate for the Yankees managing job when it went to Aaron Boone two seasons ago. Meulens, once a top Yankees prospect, played five of his seven major-league seasons in The Bronx.</p>
      <p>Jerry Narron and Fredi Gonzalez were the other known candidates for the position.</p>
