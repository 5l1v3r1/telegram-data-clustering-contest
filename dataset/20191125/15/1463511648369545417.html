      <p>The N1.2 billion fraud trial of Prof. Maurice Iwu, a former Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission, was on Monday stalled because Justice Nicholas Oweibo of the Federal High Court in Lagos, was not available.</p>
      <p>The News Agency of Nigeria reports that Iwu is facing a three-count charge  of fraud and money laundering brought against him by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission.</p>
      <p>He was first arraigned on Augernor 8 before Justice Chuka Obiozor, also of the Federal High Court in Lagos, who  granted him bail in the sum of N1 billion.</p>
      <p>Iwu pleaded not guilty before Obiozor.</p>
      <p>Following the transfer of the case to Oweibo, the former INEC chairman was re-arraigned by the anti-graft commission on October 24.</p>
      <p>He also pleaded not guilty.</p>
      <p>Oweibo adjourned until Monday (November 29) for commencement of trial.</p>
      <p>Due to the absence of the judge on Monday, the case was again adjourned until February 27, 2020.</p>
      <p>According to Rotimi Oyedepo, lead counsel to EFCC, Iwu committed the alleged offences from December 2014 to March 27, 2015.</p>
      <p>“The defendant aided the concealment of N1.23 billion in the account of Bioresources Institute of Nigeria Ltd. with number 1018603119, domiciled in the United Bank for Africa.</p>
      <p>“He ought to have reasonably known that the N1.23 billion formed part of the proceeds of fraud,” Oyedepo said.</p>
      <p>NAN reports that the alleged offences contravene Sections 15(2) and 18(a) of the Money Laundering (Prohibition) Act, 2011, and is punishable under Section 15(3) of the Act. </p>
