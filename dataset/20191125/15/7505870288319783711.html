      <p>While working from your laptop can be such a luxury, because you can take it anywhere you need, sometimes that screen just isn’t enough. If you’re someone who has to multitask a lot throughout the day and multiple screens would help you do your job more effectively, you’re going to want more visual power. Whether you want to hook your laptop up to an external monitor or just use more than one monitor with your PC, you’ll need a way to coordinate and connect them all. Thanks to the latest innovations from j5create, you’ll be able to drag your cursor across multiple screens without a problem.</p>
      <p>The JCD543 and JCD543P are two <a href="https://en.j5create.com/collections/full-docking-stations?utm_source=bgr&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=jcd543">Triple Display Docking Stations</a> that provide extra connectivity for your devices. These are super easy to connect your devices too, as you’re able to extend your desktop to up to three monitors through HDMI™, DisplayPort™ and VGA. This is an ideal product for people who work in finance, writers and editors who are reading over multiple documents, people who work in customer service and need to process applications, and many others who prefer more than one monitor.</p>
      <p>These docking stations are looking out for you and your equipment as each has a heat dissipating notebook stand for your laptops. They also feature a flexible USB-C™ cord that engineers created while actually thinking about where the USB-C™ port is on your devices, so you’ll have an easy time connecting. They didn’t only think about your computers. They also thought about your smartphones, as one of the USB™ Type-A ports supports fast charging for a phone or tablet. The USB-C™ supports power delivery 3.0, meaning you can charge your devices while you’re using them.</p>
      <p>More features that are built into these fantastic devices are the SD™/microSD™ card slots that can boost the external memory access and the combo audio jack/microphone adapter. Both of these docking stations are compatible with Microsoft® Windows® 10/8.1/7 as well as macOS® 10.8 or later, covering a wide range of computers. Higher processors are recommended for multiple displays to get the best possible performance out of the docking stations. The main difference between the <a href="https://en.j5create.com/products/jcd543?utm_source=bgr&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=jcd543">JCD543</a> and the <a href="https://en.j5create.com/products/jcd543p?utm_source=bgr&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=jcd543p">JCD543P</a> is that the latter comes with a 90W USB-C™ Power Adapter cable, making connectivity that much easier.</p>
      <p>As we’ve seen with previous j5create deals, these docking stations will be <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/searchpage.jsp?_dyncharset=UTF-8&amp;id=pcat17071&amp;iht=y&amp;keys=keys&amp;ks=960&amp;list=n&amp;sc=Global&amp;sp=-displaydate%20skuidsaas&amp;st=j5create&amp;type=page&amp;usc=All%20Categories&amp;utm_source=bgr&amp;utm_medium=j5create&amp;utm_campaign=jcd543">on sale</a> at Best Buy from November 25 through November 30, as the store is once again hosting a sale on them. Head over to your local store to get the terrific deal and make your working life easier by connecting your laptop and monitors with the JCD543 or the JCD543P.
