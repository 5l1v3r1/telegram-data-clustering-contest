      <p>Everybody is going to be heading to their local stores or, even better, their computers this week as Black Friday is close enough to smell (or that might be the Thanksgiving leftovers you’re smelling). Cyber Monday is also right around the corner, so it’s the best time of year to shop. If you’re scouting the best deals for this Black Friday, you better be ready for the days leading up to the 29th, because Woot! is rolling out the red carpet with a ton of deals leading up to the big day.</p>
      <p>First things first, every day from November 24 to December 4, our favorite deals website is going to be unveiling various promotions and sales. So no matter what day during this time period you head over to Woot’s <a href="https://www.woot.com/">website</a>, you’ll find special deals. For example, today’s daily deals feature some amazing products like <a href="https://www.woot.com/offers/amazonbasics-premium-hardside-luggage-8">AmazonBasics Premium Hardside Luggage</a> (2 piece and 3 piece) for a fraction of what it would normally cost, starting at $34.99! You can also save over $100 on an <a href="https://sellout.woot.com/offers/omega-juice-extractor-and-nutrition-center-1">Omega Juice Extractor and Nutrition Center</a> with an industry-leading 15-year warranty!</p>
      <p>Not only can you get those today, but there are plenty of other goodies to unpack. Also part of the daily deals are the <a href="https://www.woot.com/offers/camelbak-skyline-10l-crux-lumbar-reservoir-hydration-pack-2">CamelBak Skyline 10L Crux Lumbar Reservoir Hydration Pack</a> for only $87.10, an XtremePro Dual screen 4K camera immensely discounted at or a <a href="https://sport.woot.com/offers/teeter-lx9-fitspine-inversion-table-1">TeeterLX9 FitSpine Inversion Table</a> for $299.99! These are just the Daily Deals portion of this massive sale.</p>
      <p>Another promotion Woot! is running right now is called <a href="https://sellout.woot.com/plus/wootbusters">Wootbusters</a>. These fantastic deals are offered on limited quantities of items that are available each day, so you’ll have to move fast if you want to participate. Today’s offers are for the <a href="https://sellout.woot.com/plus/wootbusters">Turtle Beach Stealth 350VR Virtual Reality Gaming Headset</a> for only $29.99, the <a href="https://sellout.woot.com/plus/wootbusters">Wallet Ninja 18-in-1 Credit Card Sized Multi-Tool</a> for $9.99 and the <a href="https://sellout.woot.com/plus/wootbusters">AmazonBasics Alexa-Enabled 700W Microwave</a> for only $24.99. You’ll also be able to buy Woot! apparel before anyone else can.</p>
      <p>We know we’ve hit you with deal after deal because there are so many, but we are excited to tell you about even more of them! This week’s special promotion runs through Thanksgiving, so it’s perfect for you to hit up before and after you’ve had turkey. If you’re new to Woot!, you can make your first purchase with them and you’ll receive a $10 coupon that you can use between December 1 and December 14. The first purchase must be $25 or more in order for you to get the coupon, which is totally worth it since that means you can use it on Cyber Monday!</p>
      <p>Finally, there’s the Woot! Deal-o-meter challenge, which is an awesome feature that is interactive for consumers and gets you better deals on select items. The way it works is customers can vote to unlock better pricing for a deal the following day. Today’s offer launch is for the <a href="https://tools.woot.com/offers/bond-smart-home-automation">BOND Smart Home Automation</a> for only $67.99. You can vote on the next deal starting on the 26th and then every few days, there will be new offers to vote on.</p>
      <p>The best part about all of this is knowing that you’re able to get fantastic products in great condition, whether they’re new, refurbished, used, or factory-reconditioned. Throughout the last weeks of November and during all of December, make sure to come back each day to Woot! and check out their daily deals, Wootbusters, the Deal-o-meter challenge, and their special promotions. Upcoming ones include low prices on men’s shoes, luggage, laptops, tools, toys, games and so much more. Be ready for the holidays, thanks to Woot!</p>
