      <p>‘I’m still in awe of my baby girl @blazetucker! I just wanna say thank you sooooo much to @therealdrjackie &amp; @shadinablunt for helping us bring our beautiful baby girl in the world. There are no words that can express our gratitude! @shadinablunt is normally a super private person so helping us in this journey has been different for her. Please send love &amp; light to her &amp; @therealdrjackie! They mean a lot to our family. ❤️❤️ &amp; Make sure to watch #RHOA tonight &amp; see a part of the journey on tonight’s episode,’ Kandi captioned her photo in which she’s together with her hubby, Todd Tucker, the surrogate and the doctor as well.</p>
