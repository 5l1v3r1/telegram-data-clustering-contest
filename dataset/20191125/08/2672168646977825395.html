      <p>Hepatitis outbreak is on the increase in Myanmar with over 6 percent of the population suffering from hepatitis B and over 2 percent hepatitis C, according to a survey jointly conducted by the Public Health Department, Medical Research Department and Myanmar Liver Foundation. </p>
      <p>The Ministry of Health and Sports has adopted a national hepatitis control project and is providing free medical treatment to hepatitis C patients by opening hepatitis C centers at seven public hospitals in Yangon, Mandalay and Nay Pyi Taw in 2017 and public hospitals in Myitkyina and Mawlamyine in 2018. </p>
      <p>"We have opened hepatitis B treatment centers at some people's hospitals. Till May 2019, we provided medical treatment to 5,000 hepatitis C patients. The result is good because over 90 percent of the patients were cured. We are planning to open more centers at other hospitals," said an official from the Public Health Department. </p>
      <p>The Public Health Department, Medical Services Department and National Health Laboratory started a plot program in June 2017 to provide free treatment for hepatitis C patients. Starting from April 2018 treatment continued to be provided. Now, treatment for hepatitis C costs far less than the past. </p>
