        <b>Jose Mourinho has been told by pundit Garth Crooks that he should consider retiring from football permanently if he can’t succeed under such favourable conditions at Tottenham.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Portuguese tactician is back in Premier League management after being announced as Spurs’ replacement for Mauricio Pochettino last week, and got off to a winning start over the weekend.</p>

      <p>Mourinho’s Tottenham side ended a poor recent run away from home with a 3-2 victory at West Ham, and it will be intriguing to see how he can continue with the north London club.</p>
      <p>Despite Spurs not being as big a name as some of the other teams he’s managed, Crooks feels this could be a great set-up for the Special One as he looks to his his career back on track.</p>
      <p>Things ended badly for Mourinho in each of his last three jobs at Manchester United, Chelsea and Real Madrid, and Crooks has made it clear he thinks the 56-year-old may just need to pack it all in if he can’t get it right this time.</p>
      <p>“The new Tottenham manager has been handed one of the best squads in the country, the best stadium in the world and one of the best academies in the game – and that is all accompanied by state-of-the-art training facilities,” Crooks wrote in his column for <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/50539143">BBC Sport</a>.</p>
      <p>“If Mourinho can’t win trophies at this club, he should consider retiring from football permanently.</p>
      <p>“Let’s face it, that’s why he’s been hired – to win trophies. He can be rude and truculent. However, what he can do is win silverware.</p>
      <p>“Regular readers will know that I have been one of Mourinho’s biggest critics over the past two years but Spurs are a very different club to Manchester United and this relationship might work.”</p>
