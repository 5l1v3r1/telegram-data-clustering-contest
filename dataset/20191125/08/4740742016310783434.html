      <h1>Leeds United and Nottingham Forest will be hoping this heartbreaking Bristol City prediction comes true</h1>
      <h2>The race has been predicted to go down to the wire</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T08:45:43+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 08:45</time> by <a rel="author">David Byrom</a></address>
      <p>Bristol City's draw with Nottingham Forest could have a big impact on the race for the play-offs.</p>
      <p>That is according to leading data analyst Nate Silver's <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/soccer-predictions/championship/">Five Thirty Eight</a> website, which has predicted <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-city-fc">the Robins</a> to heartbreakingly finish one place outside the play-offs.</p>
      <p>In what would be a big blow, Nottingham Forest would finish two points above the Robins to secure the final play-off spot, where they would face Fulham in the semi-finals.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-city-fc">The Robins</a> were unable to beat 10-man Forest on Saturday, with both sides having to settle for a point in a goalless draw which now could have big implications for the play-off race.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-city-fc">City</a> have been given a 25 per cent chance of reaching the play-offs and an 11 per cent chance of getting promoted.</p>
      <p>Silver's website has predicted the outcome of the Championship based on a data model which analyses current form and how teams are playing in both defence and attack.</p>
      <p>The prediction sees Leeds United crowned champions of the division - they are said to have a 44 per cent likelihood of finishing top of the table - with West Brom in second.</p>
      <p>Brentford and Preston North End would contest the other play-off semi-final.</p>
      <p>At the other end of the division, Barnsley, Luton Town and Wigan Athletic have all been tipped to go down.</p>
