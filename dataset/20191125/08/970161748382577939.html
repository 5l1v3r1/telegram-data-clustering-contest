      <p>Dan Osborne has defended his wife <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jacqueline-jossa/">Jacqueline Jossa</a> after James Jordan accused her of being ‘fake’ on <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a> Get Me Out Of Here.</p>
      <p>The ex <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/strictly-come-dancing/">Strictly Come Dancing</a> star sat down to watch Sunday night’s episode, and felt Jacqueline was ‘acting the whole time’.</p>
      <p>He tweeted: ‘I’m normally a great judge of character. I don’t know if it’s just me but I feel Jacqueline is acting the whole time on @imacelebrity.</p>
      <p>‘Everything she does seems a little fake &amp; trying to be what she thinks the public want to see. Only my opinion guys.’</p>
      <p>Dan, who married Jacqueline in 2017, called him out tweeting: ‘Coming from someone who is married to her and lives with her, she isn’t being fake at all mate &amp; she isn’t acting.</p>
      <p>‘She is dramatic and can be emotional but she would say that herself… but fake, ABSOLUTELY not.’</p>

      <p>James, who is expecting his first child with wife Ola Jordan, is yet to respond to Dan’s comment.</p>
      <p>The Towie star also posted a further loving message of support on Instagram, saying: ‘Smashing it in there girl!! 🐊 ❤️ this is when she had her fitting, trying on her jungle clothes, I’d just got out of bed.. it’s come around so quick, now a week in and she’s doing great in there!</p>
      <p>‘Really appreciate all the support you guys are giving her, literally had hundreds, possibly thousands of messages 🙌🏼 thank you.’</p>

      <p>The former EastEnders star has been struggling with the trials lately, recently bursting into tears after the public voted for her to take part.</p>
      <p>Her husband recently <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/24/dan-osborne-begs-im-celebrity-fans-give-jacqueline-jossa-break-bushtucker-trials-star-breaks-jungle-11208473/">pleaded with fans to ‘give her a break’</a> by not putting her forward for so many trials.</p>
      <p>In an Instagram Stories video, he said: ‘I know I said to you all vote for Jac because she ain’t here to change light bulbs. I didn’t mean every single trial. Give her a break now. Come on.</p>

      <p>‘She keeps smashing them all. She’s worried about it but she’ll smash it. She’ll keep proving everyone . And she’s doing it with Ian Wright as well which is good. He’ll look after her.</p>

      <p>Jacqueline has <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/im-celebrity-get-star-jacqueline-jossa-tears-facing-worst-fear-spiders-11185078/">smashed trials in the past</a>, facing her worst fear of spiders and doing it in record time.</p>
