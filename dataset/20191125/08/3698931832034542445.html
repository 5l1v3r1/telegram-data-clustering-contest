      <p>The new Oppo Flagship store is located at Lot T-230 on the 3rd Floor, The Gardens Mall. At the moment, the official price isn’t revealed yet but we reckon it should be priced above RM3,000. The Reno 10X Zoom with 8GB RAM was originally launched in Malaysia at RM3,399 but the price is <a href="https://www.soyacincau.com/2019/11/11/oppo-reno-10x-zoom-malaysia-price-cut/">now reduced</a> to <a href="https://www.oppo.com.my/products/Reno-10x-Zoom/37">RM2,999</a>.</p>
