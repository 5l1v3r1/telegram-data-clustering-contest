      <p>The Chinese smartphone maker posted a short video teaser on its official Weibo social platform. The teaser shows a user clicking selfie shots with her pet cat. At the end of the video, the brand reveals the presence of a 32MP selfie shooter on the front. Furthermore, the entire teaser ad touts the selfie capabilities of the device. Teased previously, the upcoming Nova 5 5G will feature a punch-hole display housing two selfie sensors.</p>
      <p>With the help of a new dual-camera module, users will be able to click 105-degree ultrawide selfies without using any selfie stick. Sadly, the teaser doesn’t reveal anything else about the front camera module. The phone will see its official unveiling on December 5 i.e. next month. We’re expecting more similar teasers to come forward in the coming days.</p>
