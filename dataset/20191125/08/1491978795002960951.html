        <i>Young people are exploited for years before getting support. Social care, schools and police need to know the warning signs</i>
      </p>
      <p>Josh* had just turned 15 when the police caught him with more than £100 worth of cannabis and £200 in cash. They seized the drugs, took him home and gave the money to his mum. No referrals were made, or support offered. His mum, unaware of what was going on, simply gave the money back to Josh and left it at that.</p>
      <p>He was a scared kid caught up in a world he didn’t know how to get out of. But rather than getting the help he desperately needed, he was given a slap on the wrist and a pep talk to shape up his act.</p>
      <p>County lines drug dealing – the process of drug dealing gangs from cities expanding their operations to other areas of the country – has increased dramatically in recent years. The National Crime Agency says it <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-50081696">has fuelled an 807% increase</a> in the number of child victims of modern slavery since 2014. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.childrenscommissioner.gov.uk/2019/02/28/childrens-commissioner-for-england-warns-the-same-mistakes-that-led-to-child-sexual-exploitation-failings-are-being-repeated-with-gangs/">the Children’s Commissioner estimates</a> “27,000 children in England identify as a gang member, only a fraction of whom are known to children’s services”.</p>
      <p>I work for the drug and alcohol charity Addaction, and manage a young person’s substance misuse team on the frontline of this issue. Many services working with young people, such as schools, social care or the police, miss the signs of exploitation. Too often the young people we work with have been exploited by manipulative adults for years before being offered support. This is due to a lack of awareness rather than individual mistakes, but leaves many children vulnerable.</p>
      <p>The most common way gangs groom young people is through cannabis. They will give groups of teenagers free weed, building a supposed friendship with them. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/youngpeople">Young people</a> rarely start drug dealing by selling heroin or crack. Instead, gangs will give them a small amount of cannabis to sell: the stakes are not so high if caught and many young people enjoy the money and respect. At this stage they often feel in control of the situation, but the tables turn quickly as gang members use debts and violence to push them into selling class A drugs.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jun/17/teens-county-lines-gangs">The trauma of being involved in county lines</a> can leave deep scars. Young people drop out of school, become alienated from their peers, and witness and execute extreme violence. Many enter the criminal justice system once they turn 18, often becoming locked into a revolving door of criminality, their chances of living a normal life reducing with the passing of time.</p>
      <p>This is why seeing the signs of exploitation early is crucial. Finding a young person with a large amount of cannabis and money is a big clue. It’s also true that cannabis is the most commonly used drug among under 18s, with the majority using it for enjoyment. That’s why services must try to look for signs such as a young person suddenly having new expensive clothes, a second phone, regularly getting in trouble at school or becoming alienated. Once young people start selling class As, they may stay out all night and be prone to violent mood swings.</p>
      <p>But in our age of tight budgets, it’s tough to ask stretched services to dig deeper. The charity St Giles Trust recently <a href="https://www.stgilestrust.org.uk/article/new-hospital-work-tackles-violent-crime-in-the-midlands">started a brilliant project</a> in partnership with West Midlands police, placing youth workers in hospitals to support victims of knife crime. This should be happening in pupil referral units and custody suites in known county lines hotbeds.</p>
      <p>Organisations also need to increase awareness closer to home. Parents tell me they wished they’d known more about county lines so they could have better supported their child. Without understanding the signs of exploitation, they can’t take action.</p>
      <p>Eventually, Josh’s school referred him to our service. At first he didn’t understand the danger he was in and worshipped the man who had been exploiting him. But over time the stress of his double life began to show. He opened up about violence he had witnessed and been forced to inflict, and the sense of fear that had come to define his existence. He felt comfortable telling his support worker this because they had built a relationship over many months. She offered Josh an emotional connection free of judgment or blame, allowing him to rebuild a sense of pride in who he was.</p>
      <p>Josh is now excelling in an apprenticeship, but, sadly, is one of the lucky ones. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/county-lines">County lines</a> can impact any child. Remaining blind to the signs of exploitation means support services and parents don’t see the grip it has on young people until it’s too late. As young people get older, the way people perceive them shifts from being the victims of crime to perpetrators. As a society, we need to do more to recognise exploitation before the offer of support turns to punishment.</p>
