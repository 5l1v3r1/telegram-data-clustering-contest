      <p>The area is full of history. When invading armies marched on Galway City in the 12th century, their objective was to oppress the local population into submission and this included the local villages that are now the suburban communities of Galway, now a modern and vibrant cultural hub. All the neighboring villages fought hard, however, and battled until they finally won and retained control.</p>

      <p>The invading armies would have marched on the ground where Galway Manor proudly stands today, in the Galway suburb of Athenry. The property was constructed in 1890 on a small hill overlooking the castle. Galway Manor has a fantastic history and many stories are told of the house and goings on from the past century. The 1916 Easter Rising saw many gun battles in the area as local boys held their ground well, and the house was used as an Irish freedom fighters refuge and stronghold.</p>

      <p>The properties are known as Banba House and Banba Cottage for a very special reason. The Book of Kells historically quotes “banba” as meaning Ireland in the olde archaic Irish language. As it was slightly raised above the village, Banba was used to give vantage and warning of further attacks.</p>

      <p>Now, Galway Manor sits on a secluded tree-lined avenue, on a corner lot, in a beautiful part of town. It is on the main train and bus routes, and just a few minutes from the cultural center of Galway city's main street. From here, you can see all of Ireland.</p>
