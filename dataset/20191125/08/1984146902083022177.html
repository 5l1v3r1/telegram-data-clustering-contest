      <h1>How Newcastle 'flop' Joselu has turned his career around in Spain by matching his league goal tally ALREADY</h1>
      <h2>Joselu headed for La Liga in July after a frustrating spell on Tyneside but he can't stop scoring at the moment</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T08:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 08:00</time> by <a rel="author">Lee Ryder</a></address>
      <p>Former Newcastle United striker Joselu has found himself in a rich vein of form back in La Liga.</p>
      <p>The 29-year-old left the club shortly after Rafa Benitez's departure in July to sign for Alaves in Spain for a fee of Â£2.5million.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/joselu">Joselu</a> netted <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmdsZ5zWoKE&amp;feature=onebox">two goals</a> in a 2-0 away win at Eibar with a sweeping finish in the box with five minutes to go on Sunday before following up with a well-taken curling effort in stoppage time.</p>
      <p>It means the number 9 has now scored three in his last two matches and has a tally of six goals in 13 appearances since leaving Newcastle.</p>
      <p>Joselu, who <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/rafa-benitez">Benitez</a> signed from Stoke City was branded a flop by some fans, but has taken just four months to match his tally of league goals for <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Newcastle</a> at Alaves - and is just one behind his overall tally of seven which took him two years.</p>
      <p>The centre-forward will get a crack at his old club Real Madrid this weekend as Alaves look to pull off a scalp on home turf.</p>
