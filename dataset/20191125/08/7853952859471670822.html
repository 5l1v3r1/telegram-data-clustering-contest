      <h1>PolyU siege must end, allowing remaining students to leave</h1>

      <p>On Nov. 17, fierce clashes erupted between police and protesters who had gathered at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) and adjacent areas.</p>
      <p>By nightfall, over a thousand people, including students and others, were encircled and trapped inside the campus by police.</p>
      <p>The siege of the PolyU raised widespread concerns among society, with citizens wondering if a tragedy of immense proportions was in the making.</p>
      <p>Fortunately, through the untiring efforts of many people – including some secondary school principals and a group of lawyers — in mediation and negotiating between the law enforcement personnel and the students, the standoff saw a major de-escalation, with hundreds of people allowed to leave the besieged campus peacefully.</p>
      <p>After having earlier fired dozens of tear gas canisters into the PolyU compound and deployed an armored water cannon vehicle to disperse the crowd, the police eventually agreed to open up a designated exit for students and others trapped inside the university to leave.</p>
      <p>Yet as it turned out, whoever attempted to escape through that exit was immediately arrested by the police, an action that prompted the rest of the crowd to retreat back into the campus.</p>
      <p>Worse still, while the police deployed a large number of officers to lay siege to the PolyU, it also declared that all those who were inside the university compound would be charged with rioting. As one can imagine, the atmosphere both inside and outside the PolyU was extremely tense.</p>
      <p>Here, we feel compelled to point out that many of those who were trapped inside the PolyU last Monday night were not protesters, but rather, teaching staff and students of the university, as well as some unsuspecting secondary school students who were visiting the campus the day before.</p>
      <p>After the failed bid of Joseph Ha Chi-shing, the Auxiliary Bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Hong Kong, a number of lawmakers, including myself, sought to offer assistance at the scene. The following day I received a lot of messages from principals, teachers, parents and citizens expressing grave concern about a pending all-out attack against the campus by the police, and outlining fears that some students might take their own lives out of panic or desperation.</p>
      <p>The concerned citizens asked me to rescue those trapped inside the university as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>It is against such backdrop that I immediately got in touch with the government and a few high school principals in order to line things up for an emergency press conference in the afternoon last Monday, during which we called upon students not to hurt themselves, and urged the police to exercise restraint.</p>
      <p>I was glad to see that over 30 secondary school principals eagerly agreed to join the press conference at less than two hours’ notice.</p>
      <p>After watching our press conference, administration officials immediately contacted Teddy Tang Chun-keung, chairman of the Hong Kong Association of the Heads of Secondary Schools (HKAHSS) to explore possible assistance.</p>
      <p>Eventually, at the suggestion of some school principals, we decided to directly go to the PolyU campus, along with barrister Linda Wong and her voluntary legal support team, to look for the secondary school students who were still under siege and get them out of harm’s way as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>Luckily, sometime after 10pm on that night, some 50 high school principals, lawyers and I reached an agreement with the police, under which we were allowed to enter the PolyU and accompany more than 100 school kids out of the besieged university.</p>
      <p>I have to stress that all the secondary school students aged under 18 who were allowed to go home in our company on that night didn’t turn themselves in to the police.</p>
      <p>Instead, all the law enforcement did was record the students’ identities and take pictures of them, except in a few special cases where the police said it reserved the right to pursue future legal action.</p>
      <p>As teachers, what we care about most is definitely the personal safety as well as mental and physical well-being of our students. The last thing we want to see is our students getting hurt or hurting themselves.</p>
      <p>Now, speaking of the handful of protesters who are still holding out against the police and remaining inside the PolyU, I hope they are allowed to leave in a safe and dignified manner as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>The government, meanwhile, should address public grievances and meet the demands that have resonated within society in recent months.</p>
