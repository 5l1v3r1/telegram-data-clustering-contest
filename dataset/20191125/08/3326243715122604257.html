      <p><a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/black-friday/">Black Friday</a> is right around the corner. Before the huge shopping event arrives, Apple is announcing its annual perk for choosing to shop directly from the company.</p>
      <p>As is par for the course, Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/us/shop/gifts/shopping-event">is including</a> a gift card with the purchase of select Apple-branded products. However, the company isn’t going out of its way to reveal the details just yet. In its announcement today it simply states it will offer a gift card up to $200 with the purchase of select items.</p>
      <p>The shopping event is four days long: Friday, November 29, through Monday, December 29. It’s a surprise until Friday rolls around, though.</p>
      <p>Of course, Apple <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/2019/11/20/apple-2019-holiday-gift-guide/"><i>did</i> reveal</a> its 2019 holiday shopping guide last week, and that probably gives us a pretty solid indicator of which products will be included in this deal. It’s also worth noting that Apple isn’t going to give a $200 gift card for <i>every</i> purchase made. The value of the gift card will correlate to the price of the product you’re buying.</p>
      <p>Apple also has a link to add the event to your calendar if you’re so inclined and want the reminder.</p>
      <p>Black Friday will see a host of deals from a variety of retailers, as usual. So while Apple’s $200 gift card deal might be worthwhile to some, a discount on the up front cost on one of those Apple-branded products might be more worthwhile to others. Still, it’s better than nothing.</p>
      <p>Are you planning on buying any Apple products for the holidays? Let us know what you’re shopping for this year in the comments below.</p>
