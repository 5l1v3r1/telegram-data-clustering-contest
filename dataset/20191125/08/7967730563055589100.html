      <h1>'Poisonous rats': Sky rail workers threatened if they didn't steal copper</h1>

      <p>A sky rail tradesman who stole more than $100,000 worth of copper from the taxpayer-funded project as part of an organised racket has been jailed for six months.</p>
      <p>New Zealand-born Hayden Tarawa, the first to be jailed over the thefts, was also slapped with a two-year community corrections order after pleading guilty to stealing nearly 4500 kilograms of copper from the $1.6 billion Caulfield-to-Dandenong sky rail project.</p>

      <p>The sentence came as the judge noted that tradesmen who refused to steal huge spools of copper were called "poisonous rats", had their livelihoods threatened and were singled out for abuse on the job site.</p>
      <p>Tarawa's boss, former Lendlease building supervisor Kory Oxley, earlier pleaded guilty to falsifying time sheets on the sky rail project.</p>
      <p>Oxley has not been charged over copper theft but Tarawa's defence counsel Sophie Parsons said her client carried out the crime under Oxley’s instructions, and would not otherwise have been involved.</p>
      <p>She said Oxley was also responsible for introducing Tarawa to methamphetamines.</p>

      <p>Tarawa’s offending was a consequence of a "toxic workplace" on the sky rail project, Ms Parson's said.</p>
      <p>In his sentencing remarks, County Court judge Peter Wischusen said Oxley appeared to have "infected" the sky rail project and was involved in "corrupt practices".</p>
      <p>However, the judge found Tarawa could have been in no doubt that he was involved in a "serious criminal enterprise".</p>
      <p>The court heard that Oxley and Tarawa met while working on the Optus Stadium in Perth. Tarawa moved to Melbourne at Oxley's suggestion and began working long hours on the sky rail project under Oxley.</p>

      <p>On the night of September 9 last year, Tarawa and another labourer entered the sky rail contractors’ Clayton South warehouse and stole six giant spools of copper wire, each worth about $19,000.</p>
      <p>The duo was granted access to the building after Tarawa told a night-shift security guard they were on site to pick up other materials.</p>
      <p>The two men loaded the copper spools onto a borrowed truck and took them to Tarawa’s home.</p>

      <p>Over the next two weeks, Tarawa sold the copper to two scrap metal dealers for more than $27,000.</p>
      <p>Victoria Police was contacted once the missing copper spools were detected during a stocktake, the court heard.</p>
      <p>Tarawa clasped his hands as he was sentenced while his wife – who he married just weeks ago and who is pregnant with their fourth child – sobbed quietly.</p>
      <p>A government spokesman declined to comment on the case saying: "This matter is being dealt with by police and the courts. We’re getting on with removing dangerous and congested level crossings."</p>
