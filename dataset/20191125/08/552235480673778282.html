      <h1>Atlanta United president acclaims Aberdeen as further details of big money tie-up emerge</h1>
      <h2>The deal offers huge opportunity for both clubs according to their management.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T08:13:34+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 08:13</time> by <a rel="author">Scott Burns, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/scott-burns/</a></address>
      <p>Atlanta United president Darren Eales has claimed that their tie-up with <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/aberdeen-fc">Aberdeen</a> will be a win-win for both clubs.</p>
      <p>Soon-to-be Dons chairman Dave Cormack has confirmed that he will be taking over from <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/stewart-milne">Stewart Milne</a> at the Pittodrie helm next month and it will signal sweeping changes.</p>
      <p>He will also be bringing in a further £5 million investment and tie up with the Major League Soccer outfit.</p>
      <p>The AMB Sports and Entertainment Group, who own Atlanta United, have agreed to take a small shareholding (less than 10 per cent) in Aberdeen.</p>

      <p>They will put in around £2 million after group after United owner Arthur Blank – who is valued at £5.5 billion - sanctioned the deal.</p>
      <p>It will also see a tie up between the two clubs at first-team, where the Dons currently have Jon Gallagher on-loan, and youth levels, along with sharing scouting information over both continents.</p>
      <p>Eales, who will will take a seat on the Pittodrie board as part of the deal, said: “We’ve always gone in with the intention of win-win for both clubs.</p>
      <p>“For Atlanta United, it’s really important that this is Aberdeen, already a well-run club.</p>
      <p>“We aren’t taking our eye off the ball on Atlanta United, which 100% remains our focus.</p>
      <p>“It builds our scouting network, our ability to share best practices across the board from academy right through to sports science.</p>
      <p>“Everything we try to do Atlanta United is trying to get that little edge in every area.</p>

      <p>“A chance for us on the performance side to help boost, whether it’s by 1% or 2%, our technical side so that we can compete to be a club that’s pushing the competitions year over year.”</p>
      <p>Eales confirmed talks had been on-going for more than six months and came about because <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/dave-cormack">Cormack</a> is a season ticket holder at United and also stays in Atlanta.</p>
      <p>Eales has twice visited Aberdeen during the due diligence period and knows it will help the Major League Soccer side.</p>
      <p>Atlanta United vice-president <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/carlos-bocanegra">Carlos Bocanegra</a> and Jonathan Spector, recently hired to oversee international scouting, will communicate and coordinate with counterparts at Aberdeen over European signing scouting and targets, while they will also offer the Dons an insight into the American and South American markets</p>
      <p> “You’ve got to walk before you run,” Eales said. “We’re still only just finished our third year. We’ve done our due diligence. We so feel like this is something that’s going to be a helpful tool for Atlanta United.”</p>
      <p>Gallagher came in on-loan in the summer from United.  He has made a positive impact and a deal has already been agreed to extend his deal for the rest of the season.  Eales admitted there could be further switches between both clubs over the coming months.</p>
      <p>Eales, speaking in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, admitted: “Like anything, if it’s successful, who knows what we might do down the line?”</p>
