      <h2>Nuno Espirito Santo has heaped praise on his Wolves squad for keeping up their unbeaten run hot on the heels of an international break.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T08:44:14+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 08:44</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.expressandstar.com/news/authors/joe-edwards/" target="_blank">Joe Edwards</a></address>
      <p>Nuno's side, after having several travel across the globe with their countries, made it eight without defeat in the Premier League by winning 2-1 at Bournemouth.</p>
      <p>Joao Moutinho – who had played for Portugal against Lithuania and then Luxembourg – was on the scoresheet, as was Raul Jimenez – after playing in Panama and then against Bermuda in his home nation of Mexico.</p>
      <p>And Nuno said: "That's what it is about. When you come back from an international break, knowing the players have been all around the world, it's about getting together and keeping to your tasks.</p>
      <p>"You have to try to make the things you've been doing all the time – reproduce it on the pitch."</p>
      <p>Wolves had a knack of failing to deliver on the back of international breaks last season, and earlier this term, they suffered a humiliating 5-2 home loss to Chelsea following the one in September.</p>
      <p>But they put in a scintillating first-half performance at the Vitality Stadium on Saturday, despite the fact Ruben Neves, Rui Patricio and Diogo Jota (Portugal), Matt Doherty (Ireland), Romain Saiss (Morocco) and Leander Dendoncker (Belgium) – as well as Moutinho and Jimenez – only had a couple of days to prepare at Compton after representing their nations.</p>
      <p>Moutinho opened his account for the campaign with a perfectly-executed free-kick, and Jimenez finished calmly from close range for his 14th Wolves goal of the season in all competitions.</p>
      <p>Bournemouth were resilient in the second half, despite having Simon Francis sent off, and scored through Steve Cook.</p>
      <p>Nuno, though, despite the less-impressive second half, was delighted with all of his players' displays.</p>
      <p>"I think all of the players performed really well," he said.</p>
      <p>"As a team, we performed very, very good. It was very good."</p>
      <p>As well as coming up with the opener, Moutinho had a big hand in Wolves' second as he found Adama Traore with a clever through-ball before the Spaniard set up Jimenez.</p>
      <p>And while he did not wax lyrical about Moutinho's goal or his part in Jimenez's, Nuno added on the man who has signed a new contract until 2022: "Joao is an important player as he has the experience to know what the game requires in each moment."</p>
