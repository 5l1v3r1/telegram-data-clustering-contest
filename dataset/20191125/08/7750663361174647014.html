      <h1>England vs. New Zealand day five: Joe Root's side fold under pressure again</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/cricket/england/"><b>England</b></a> were unable to negotiate batting out the final day against <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/cricket/new-zealand/"><b>New Zealand</b></a> as a series of injudicious strokes saw the tourists hammered by an innings and 65 runs at Mount Maunganui.</h2>

      <p>Neil Wagner's five for 44 included two wickets in as many balls to bring an abrupt conclusion to proceedings as the Black Caps took a 1-0 lead in the two-Test series, but a number of England batsmen were culpable in their own downfall.</p>
      <p>With seven wickets in hand and needing to bat out the day to guarantee the series stayed level heading to Hamilton later this week, England captain <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/joe-root/"><b>Joe Root</b></a> and deputy Ben Stokes were among those out to puzzling shot selections.</p>

      <p>England's heavy loss on a sluggish pitch – albeit one that offered turn and bounce out of the footholes for Mitch Santner, who took three for 53 – was all the more galling given Trent Boult was only able to send down one over on Monday because of a rib injury that leaves him doubtful for the second Test.</p>
      <p>But the hosts found their opponents in charitable mood as the only batsman to last more than 100 balls was Joe Denly, who received scant support elsewhere in his 35 from 142 deliveries as England were all out for 197.</p>
      <p>A draw had seemed distinctly remote once they had lurched from 121 for four to 138 for eight before tea and there were still 21.4 overs remaining when Stuart Broad was the last man out for a golden duck in the final session.</p>

      <p>Ashes 2005-winning captain Michael Vaughan makes the point that England can console themselves that this two-match series against the Kiwis is outside the remit of the World Test Championship.</p>

      <p>Having been kept in the field for 201 overs, bowling 33 of them himself, Broad can perhaps be pardoned for being so bullish about England's prospects before the start of play on day five. Penny for his thoughts as he walked out to bat in the final session, though.</p>

      <p>Any local fans who took up New Zealand's hospitality for free admission were treated as the hosts claimed their 11th win in their last 16 home Tests.</p>
      <h3>Bowled over</h3>

      <p>New Zealand's left-arm enforcer Wagner showed he is not just a one-trick pony who bangs it into the surface. Having just taken the new ball, and coming round the wicket, Wagner fired in a hooping in-swinger that Jos Buttler left alone to his cost as the delivery clattered into the base of leg stump.</p>
