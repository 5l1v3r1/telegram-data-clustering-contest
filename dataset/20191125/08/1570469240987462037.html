      <p>Romania's centrist <a href="https://www.wionews.com/world/romania-votes-for-president-with-liberal-incumbent-favoured-261170">President Klaus Iohannis</a> won a presidential election runoff on Sunday as expected, crushing his socialist challenger with a pledge to resume judicial reforms slowed down by successive Social Democrat (PSD) governments.</p>
      <p>Two separate exit polls showed Iohannis garnered 64 per cent-67per cent of the vote, with former prime minister Viorica Dancila of the left-leaning PSD taking 33-36 per cent. </p>
      <p>"The winner today is modern Romania, European Romania, normal Romania," Iohannis told reporters in his victory speech.</p>
      <p>Under a succession of PSD governments, Romania, a European Union member state, has rolled back anti-corruption measures in recent years. Along with ex-communist peers Poland and Hungary, it has been heavily criticized by Brussels for its actions.</p>
      <p>However, 60-year-old Iohannis has been credited by Western allies and the European Union with trying to protect the rule of law, in particular by challenging attempts to limit judges' independence.</p>
      <p>The president's powers are mostly limited to nominating a prime minister on the basis of who can command a majority, challenging laws in the Constitutional Court, and appointing some chief prosecutors.</p>
      <p>Lohannis is expected to install anti-graft and anti-mafia prosecutors who are serious about tackling endemic corruption with the backing of<a href="https://www.wionews.com/world/romanias-liberals-present-minority-government-258012"> Prime Minister Ludovic Orban</a>, who became head of a liberal minority government by winning a parliamentary vote of confidence three weeks ago.</p>
      <p>Teacher Andreea Mihai, 50, said "things should slowly return to normality. Both Orban and Iohannis will work together in the same direction."</p>
      <p>Dancila's PSD had increased the burden of proof in corruption cases, reorganized panels of judges and set up a special unit to investigate magistrates for potential abuses, a move widely seen as an instrument of political coercion.</p>
      <p>Romania's judicial reforms have been monitored by Brussels since it joined the EU in 2007; in October, Brussels said the reforms were going backward.</p>
      <p>Lohannis, a soft-spoken ethnic German and former mayor of Sibiu, became president in 2014.</p>
      <p>He helped to secure popular approval in a referendum last May that called for the government to be banned from altering legislation by emergency decrees and advocated a ban on amnesties and pardons for graft-related crimes.</p>
      <p>Data from Romania's election commission, which is expected to announce partial official results on Monday, showed a turnout of about 50 per cent, with a record 920,000 voters from the country's diaspora taking part.</p>
