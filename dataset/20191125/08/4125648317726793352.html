      <p>BEIRUT, LEBANON (12:40 P.M.) – The jihadist rebels reportedly suffered heavy losses in the southeastern countryside of the Idlib Governorate these past 24 hours, a source from the military told Al-Masdar News.</p>
      <p>According to a field source, the jihadist rebels suffered over 20 casualties during the fierce clashes at the towns of Umm Al-Khalakhil and Musharifah Al-Shmaliyah this week.</p>
      <p>The source said the majority of these casualties were jihadist rebels from the terrorist group Hay’at Tahrir Al-Sham.</p>
      <p>He would add that the Syrian Arab Army has since consolidated their gains around Umm Al-Khalakhil and Zarzour, as they prepare to launch another round of attacks against the jihadist rebels.</p>
      <p>Over the last 24 hours, the Syrian Arab Army’s 25th Special Mission Forces (formerly Tiger Forces) have captured the towns of Umm Al-Khalakhil and Musharifah Al-Shmaliyah, while also securing nearby Zarzour.</p>
      <p>Since resuming their offensive in Idlib, the Syrian Arab Army has mostly concentrated their attacks on the southeastern axis of the governorate; this is likely due to their desire to reach the southeastern flank of Ma’arat Al-Nu’man.</p>
      <p>Ma’arat Al-Nu’man is next major town that is located along the Damascus-Aleppo Highway (var. M-5 Highway); however, it is not clear if the army plans to capture the town or just surround the militant forces there.</p>
