      <p>It is essentially an open secret that the 24-year-old son of billionaire <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/formula-1/mclaren/"><b>McLaren</b></a> co-owner Michael Latifi will replace <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/robert-kubica/"><b>Robert Kubica</b></a> at Williams.</p>
      <p>In Brazil, where he drove the Williams in Friday practice, he said: "I hope to announce my plans for 2020 very soon."</p>
      <p>2019 was Latifi's fourth consecutive season in F2, and he looks set to finish this year's championship as runner-up.</p>
      <p>He is quoted by La Gazzetta dello Sport as announcing that he will not return to the feeder category in 2020.</p>
      <p>"Right from the start of the season I knew it would be my last year, whether it was good or bad," Latifi told the Italian newspaper.</p>
      <p>"I am happy to have done a good season. We will see what the plan will be for next year."</p>
