      <h1>Westpac bosses should resign</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T08:42:50+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 08:42</time> by <a rel="author">The Age's View</a></address>
      <p>When Westpac CEO Brian Hartzer fronted the banking royal commission, he admitted that its collaborative style of working had resulted in a lack of individual accountability â€“ something he was very keen to point out was being rectified. The recent accusations of gross financial incompetence levelled at Westpac should provide Mr Hartzer, and the bank's chairman Lindsay Maxsted, with the perfect opportunity to lead by example.</p>

      <p>The bank's shortcomings under scrutiny are surprisingly straightforward. Westpac has financial ties with numerous overseas banks so customers can make payments outside of Australia. In return, customers of the overseas banks use Westpac for payments in Australia. Unchecked, it's a seamless system for rampant illegal activities. That is why banks are required by law to put in place rigorous checks to make sure the payments are legitimate. That is why the government has AUSTRAC, which monitors these types of financial transactions to identify money laundering, organised crime, tax evasion and the like. That is the way it's supposed to work.</p>
      <p>Last week, AUSTRAC made clear that was a long way from how Westpac was operating. It accused the bank of failing to do thorough checks on more than 23 million occasions, involving billions of dollars. AUSTRAC said the root cause was hardly one-off lapses, pointing the finger at complete systemic failures. Those shortfalls alone would be an enormous embarrassment to the bank, but among those breaches were failures to monitor international payments linked to child trafficking and child pornography. AUSTRAC detailed how over a number of years, 12 Westpac customers repeatedly made frequent low-level transactions, a pattern of behaviour the bank knew since 2013 posed a high risk of being linked to child exploitation. That transformed the lapses from a damaging oversight issue into an appalling failure opening the way for individuals to partake in abhorrent behaviours.</p>
      <p>And Westpac's response? The CEO was "disgusted and appalled", with an apology thrown in. Two days later the board surfaced, with the chairman offering an "unreserved apology" but also giving full backing of the CEO, and strongly hinting that he was going nowhere. The closest thing to accountability came with short-term bonuses being put on the chopping block.</p>

      <p>This was never going to be enough. Those in Canberra still tarnished by not initially backing the banking royal commission were keen to be seen, with Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Treasurer Josh Frydenberg talking up the need for accountability. Banking watchdog APRA and corporate regular ASIC are launching inquiries. The grilling will continue, with Westpac facing its annual general meeting in just over two weeks, giving its shareholders the opportunity to vent.<br/>The odds are things will get worse for Westpac. Scandals that hit National Australia Bank and Commonwealth Bank were soon followed by departed CEOs, and the chairman in the case of NAB.<br/>Mr Hartzer and and Mr Maxsted were in charge while Westpac became a clearing house for the dirtiest of money. The buck stops with them now, while the bank endures one of the worst scandals of a sector that has endured quite a few lately. It's under their watch. They should resign.</p>
