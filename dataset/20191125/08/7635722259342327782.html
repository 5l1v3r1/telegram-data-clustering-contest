      <h1>Spending habits by Irish consumers on Black Friday revealed</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T08:05:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 08:05</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.newstalk.com/author/jack-quann" target="_blank">Jack Quann</a></address>

        <b>The most popular time for shopping online on Black Friday is 10.00am.</b>
      </p>
      <p>That is according to a new survey from AIB, which examined people's shopping habits.</p>
      <p>It found shoppers in Monaghan spent the most on clothing on Black Friday - while those in Tipperary spent the most (€118) on jewellery.</p>
      <p>And shoppers in Sligo spent their money on electrical goods.</p>
      <p>The data was compiled from over one million debit card transactions from Irish consumers, and has been anonymised and aggregated.</p>
      <p>Speaking about the data, AIB's chief digital and innovation officer Fergal Coburn said: "These insights give us a real understanding as to how Irish consumers are spending their money.</p>
      <blockquote>"More recently we are seeing an increase in digital wallet usage, with more shoppers using Apple, Google or FitBit Pay to carry out their transactions.</blockquote>
      <p>"This year we have seen a trend in consumers using their digital wallets more as they reach for their phone over their card."</p>

      <p>Apple, Fitbit and Google Pay allow shoppers to spend up to €5,000 with a tap of their device.</p>
      <p>These accounted for 4% of all transactions last Black Friday and is expected to increase this year.</p>
      <p>The spending data reveals that brick and mortar stills wins out - with 69% of us spending in store versus 31% online.</p>
      <p>However, there is an increase in the volume of online spending during Black Friday compared with the previous Friday.</p>
      <p>On Black Friday, online spend is up 216% and in store spending is up 46% compared with the previous week.</p>
      <p>The data also reveals that 36% of us are shopping online on so-called Cyber Monday.</p>
