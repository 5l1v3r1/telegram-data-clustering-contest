      <h2>“An old Sarries colleague used to say, how do you eat an elephant? It’s piece by piece. We can’t look further than we can see at this point. If we are too focused on what happens in May or June, we are going to get ourselves into trouble" Brad Barritt</h2>

      <p>Brad Barritt admits relationships at Saracens will be “tested like no other year” as the club tries to dig itself out of the deepest hole in Premiership rugby history.</p>
      <p>But the captain of the crisis-hit English champions says they can not only avoid relegation but retain their European title.</p>
      <p>Saracens are 26 points adrift at the foot of the Premiership after being penalised for breaching salary cap regulations over three seasons. They have 18 games to save themselves.</p>
      <p>Barritt does not sugar coat the size of the challenge but after seeing the way his side demolished Champions Cup opponents Ospreys 44-3 in their first home game since the scandal broke, is adamant they can survive.</p>

      <p>“An old Sarries colleague used to say, how do you eat an elephant? It’s piece by piece,” said the former England centre. “We can’t look further than we can see at this point.</p>
      <p>“If we are too focused on what happens in May or June, we are going to get ourselves into trouble.</p>
      <p>“But it has always been about the process here at Saracens, the day-to-day experiences, wanting to get better as players and it is the same mentality now with this.”</p>

      <p>Saracens were without Owen Farrell, Maro Itoje and Billy Vunipola but still scored six unanswered tries in a performance highlighted by a sparkling debut from Elliot Daly, their latest star recruit.</p>
      <p>The England fullback’s acquisition late last season raised eyebrows among critics bewildered at how Sarries were able to fit a squad already awash with international talent under the salary cap.</p>
      <p>It turns out it was not possible and club chairman Nigel Wray has taken responsibility for “arrangements” between himself and certain players, which broke the rules.</p>

      <p>In his programme notes on Saturday he quoted an extract from Rudyard Kipling’s poem ‘If’ about treating triumph and disaster in the same way.</p>
      <p>Saracens then turned in a display which left Barritt purring: “Europe is still an incredible focus for us. Make no mistake, this Saracens team wants to win this trophy.</p>
      <p>“There’s going to be adversity throughout the season. This is going to be as unique a challenge as any club’s going to face.</p>

      <p>“The relationship between players and staff is going to be tested like no other year. But it is going to be the true sign of our culture and the resilience of this group.</p>
      <p>“We have invested a huge amount of pride into those relationships and they are going to stand the test of time. We are a hugely resilient bunch and a team that’s going to fight to the end.”</p>
