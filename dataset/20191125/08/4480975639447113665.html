      <p>These are the main highlights of the latest <b>CFTC Positioning Report</b> for the week ended on November 19<sup>th</sup>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Speculations of a positive outcome from the US-China protracted trade war continued to sustain the exodus from the Japanese safe haven for yet another session, taking <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/currencies/usdjpy"><b>JPY</b></a> net shorts to the highest level since June 11<sup>th</sup>. In the meantime, President Trump recently reiterated that a deal looks ‘close’ in spite of the stagnant negotiations around the ‘Phase One’ deal.</li>
        <li>Speculators kept scaling back their gross longs in <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/currencies/us-dollar-index"><b>USD</b></a>, taking the net longs to the lowest level since mid-July amidst alternating risk-appetite trends. In addition, market participants seem unconvinced by the ‘wait-and-see’ stance from the Fed and could be anticipating further rate cuts in the next months, leaving the buck somewhat vulnerable.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/currencies/eurusd"><b>EUR</b></a> net shorts climbed to fresh multi-week highs as investors shifted their focus to the region’s weak fundamentals. This view was also reinforced by the dovish tone from ECB’s C.Lagarde early last week.</li>
      </ul>
