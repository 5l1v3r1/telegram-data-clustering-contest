      <p>Since making his senior debut for Barca in 2004, Messi has become the club's all-time leading goalscorer and arguably one of the greatest players in football's history.</p>
      <p>The 32-year-old is synonymous with the Catalan giants' recent success, but he had to overcome a number of challenges in order to achieve stardom<i>.</i></p>
      <p>"I was in Barcelona for about 15 days and then I returned to Argentina," Messi said in an interview with <i>OTRO</i> when speaking about his trial at the club.</p>
      <p>"After a few months, they called me and I said yes, that I was willing to come. Let me come here and start my dream in Barcelona. It was a happiness for me and my family." </p>

      <p>The Argentina international then explained that the move across continents was hard on his family, but added that he never thought of turning back.</p>
      <p>"They were hard times, but it never crossed my mind to go home," Messi continued.</p>
      <p>"My brothers had gone to Argentina, my sister's adaptation was the toughest of all, she was the smallest and it was hard for them, with school and everything.</p>
      <p>"They decided that my mother would go to Argentina with her.</p>
      <p>"I was alone, and they asked me what I wanted to do, if we stayed or left, that the decision was mine and that they would support me. I was always clear that I wanted to stay."</p>
