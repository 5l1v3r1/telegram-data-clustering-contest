      <p>A Spanish woman, identified by her initials RPL, was stabbed multiple times with a machete during an alleged robbery attempt near Padang Padang beach in Uluwatu last week. According to reports from local media, the police are still looking for the suspect. </p>
      <p>As reported by <i>Bali Post</i>, an integrated team of officers from South Kuta, Denpasar and the Regional Bali Police are currently investigating the case. </p>
      <p>“We’re still looking into this case. We hope we can solve it soon,” <a href="http://www.balipost.com/news/2019/11/24/93178/Wanita-Spanyol-Ditebas-Perampok.html">Wayan Arta Ariawan from the Denpasar Police said yesterday. </a></p>

      <p>As laid out on the public post, Stela FP said the incident took place around 7pm on Nov. 21 in the parking lot of Padang Padang beach, which is also known as Thomas beach among local residents. </p>
      <p>RPL was heading back to where she parked her motorbike with another girl when an Indonesian man approached her with a machete to steal her bag. According to Stela, RPL’s bag was tied to the motorbike and therefore couldn’t be snatched easily and RPL was instead stabbed six times before the perpetrator ran away from the scene. </p>
      <p>“She is badly injured and the wounds are really deep. She is in the hospital,” Stela wrote, warning people to take care and stay cautious especially during nighttime.</p>
