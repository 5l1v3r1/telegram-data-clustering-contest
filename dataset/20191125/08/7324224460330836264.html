      <p>Without the 24-year-old old midfielder Dean Smith’s Villa side average just a point a game.</p>
      <p>And after losing their last two Premier League games since Grealish limped off with a calf injury at Manchester City last month, Smith is keen to have him back.</p>
      <p>Smith said: “He’s a top player. I stand with (assistant boss) John Terry sometimes and we go ‘Wow!’ at some of the things he does.</p>
      <p>“When top players are playing you have a better chance of winning, when top players aren’t playing, you’ve less chance of winning. It’s the same with any top player at any club.”</p>
      <p>It will be Bruce’s first return to Villa Park since cabbage-gate.</p>
      <p>A disgruntled fan threw the vegetable at the-then Villa boss in the October 2018 defeat to Preston North End.</p>
      <p>It would be his last game in charge and Smith, who took over later that month, condemned the incident.</p>
      <p>He said: “I thought it was a disgrace. You don’t want to see that in the ground. I said that at the time.</p>
      <p>“I was just embarrassed for the person who was bringing a cabbage in there.”</p>
      <p>Smith steered Villa back to the Premier League with Bruce joining them after swapping Sheffield Wednesday for Tyneside.</p>

      <p>And Smith is expecting the fixture to have some bite. He said: “We have played Steve before at Sheffield Wednesday last season.</p>
      <p>“I said when I took the job I have an awful lot of respect for what he has done in management but, more importantly, for how he is as a man as well.</p>
      <p>“If you look at Newcastle at the start of the season there were a lot of questions about the club and where it was going. But Steve has gone in and done what he does best – got them organised. They’ve got pace and power up front. They are winning games – they’ve won the last couple – they beat Manchester United at home as well. They are in a good run of form at the moment.”</p>
      <p>Smith could have Grealish back with keeper Tom Heaton back in training and centre-half Bjorn Engels also in contention.</p>
      <p>And with Villa keen to bounce back from back-to-back 2-1 defeats to Liverpool and Wolves, Smith is keen for them to pick up their third home league win of the season. He said: “Every game we play in this league at Villa Park is big.</p>
      <p>“I said at the start of the season that home form is going to be the most important thing this season.</p>
      <p>“We’ve performed well so far at home. We were unfortunate against Liverpool in our last home game but our last performance away wasn’t so good and the players certainly got a reminder of that.</p>
      <p>“Playing under the lights at Villa Park is always a great evening, especially with a full house and the fans fully behind us.”</p>
      <p>Villa are four points behind Newcastle in the bottom half of the table.</p>
      <p>And Smith was impressed with their victory at West Ham last time out.</p>
      <p>He said: “I watched their game with West Ham and they were outstanding in their counter-attacking. They went 3-0 up and it could have been five or six, such is the pace and power they’ve got in their team. They’ve got a really good organisation as well. Tough to break down but a real threat on the counter.”</p>
