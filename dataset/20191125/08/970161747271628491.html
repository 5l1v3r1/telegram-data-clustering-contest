      <h1>Debt Diaries: I racked up 13k of credit card debt from shopping</h1>

      <p>I always thought I was OK at managing my money before credit was available to me. I spent what I earned, and that was that.</p>
      <p>Then soon after I turned 18 I received a call from my bank. The guy wanted me to come in for a financial health check.</p>
      <p>We met and he told me it would be for the best if I took out a credit card ‘for safety reasons – as you should never shop online using a debit card’.</p>
      <p>I dutifully signed all the forms and when my card arrived in the post I felt flush with all of the ‘money’ suddenly available to me. I had no real idea what an APR was – but I now had the means to treat myself.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>I started buying slightly more expensive makeup, or a new outfit for a night out, confident that I could pay it back over a few months and not overdo it.</p>
      <p>But during that time I was in a pretty dark place. My relationship was unstable, I was suffering from severe anxiety and depression and my self-worth was at an all-time low. Buying things was my go-to pick me up, which quickly spiralled into a full-blown shopping addiction.</p>
      <p>I’d pop into town several times a week and spend between £50 and £100 on clothes, make-up and anything that made me feel pampered. It wasn’t unusual for me to drive to the Trafford Centre and drop £200 just because I needed cheering up.</p>
      <p>Soon my card was maxed out, as was my overdraft. The same guy from the bank called again. This time he told me that I needed a consolidation loan to pay off my credit card and my overdraft, and he’d even throw in an extra £500 ‘because it’s nearly Christmas, so you’ll want to be able to buy good presents’.</p>
      <blockquote>I had a wardrobe full of clothes and a make-up collection to rival James Charles, but it wasn’t worth the stress I felt.</blockquote>
      <p>I fully trusted that this man had my best financial interests at heart and was completely naive to the possibility that this wasn’t the advice I needed.</p>
      <p>This cycle continued. I jumped into an even worse relationship and by the time I was 23 I had amassed around £13,000 of debt and was on my second consolidation loan.</p>

      <p>I had a wardrobe full of clothes and a make-up collection to rival <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/james-charles/">James Charles</a>, but it wasn’t worth the stress I felt.</p>
      <p>Although I’d never once missed a payment, I’d also never made more than the minimum payments either. I knew that missing payments had consequences and I knew I had to do something before things got out of control. </p>
      <p>I googled whether or not I could declare myself bankrupt and spent every spare minute researching interest rates and finance until I actually understood the situation.</p>
      <p>I was able to shop around for the best interest-free credit cards and shift most of my debt to those while concentrating on paying off the rest as quickly as I could.</p>
      <p>The addiction I’d once had to shopping suddenly transformed into an addiction to seeing my debt go down. I sold everything I could on eBay, started mystery shopping around my full-time job and set myself a challenge to have as many no-spend days in a row as I could.</p>
      <p>I’ve experienced a few setbacks, such as losing my job in the same week everybody in my block of flats got evicted so that they could develop it.</p>
      <p>I signed on to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/universal-credit/">Universal Credit</a>, but the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) wouldn’t give me a penny before my rent was due – only an emergency loan, which of course charged interest. I used a 0 per cent credit card instead, which meant I got nothing as I ‘had access to money’. Luckily I wasn’t out of work for long. </p>

      <p>In five years, I’ve paid off around £10,000 and am due to be completely debt-free in 11 months time. Since 2014, I haven’t paid a penny in interest and I have considered every purchase carefully.</p>
      <p>One of my biggest financial milestones was building up an emergency fund so that I never have to fall back on credit again. I did this through selling things, switching bank accounts and using apps that offer different types of cashback for minimal effort. </p>
      <p>The one good thing to come out of all of this is that I am now the friend who knows about money. I can advise my pals on how to avoid making the same mistakes I did, how to properly manage their debt and what on earth compound interest is. </p>
      <p>I can’t wait to be completely debt-free, and hopefully in another five years I’ll have loads of money in the bank instead.</p>
