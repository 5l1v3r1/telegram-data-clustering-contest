      <h2>Aaron Rai secured another big payday – despite finishing well down the field at the season-ending DP World Tour golf Championships.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T08:54:16+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 08:54</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.expressandstar.com/news/authors/dave-cooper/" target="_blank">Dave Cooper</a></address>
      <p>The Wolverhampton-born former Shropshire &amp; Herefordshire junior finished with a tie for 40th spot – which was enough to earn him almost £26,000.</p>
      <p>He finished with a three-under par round of 69 for a total of one-over at the big money event.</p>
      <p>Jon Rahm birdied the final hole to win in Dubai on 19-under-par and clinch the European Tour’s season-long Race to Dubai title and £4m.</p>
      <p>Rahm holed a three-foot putt to finish one ahead of England’s Tommy Fleetwood and win the event for the second time. And it meant the 25-year-old Spaniard also pipped Fleetwood, 28, to be the No1 in Europe.</p>
