      <p>You know the urban legend that says everyone has a doppelgänger out there somewhere in the world? Welp, Ariana Grande finally found hers, and if I am quite honest...it’s crazy how alike these two ladies look!</p>
      <p>Enter in <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@paigeniemann">Paige Niemann, a teen TikTok star</a> who decided one day that she was going to start dressing up like Ariana Grande. And BOY, did homegirl do the work!!! When I tell you that Paige looks like Ariana head to toe, I am not kidding. Which is why when a Twitter user posted a video of Paige impersonating Ariana and Ariana saw the footage for herself, she was SHOOOOOK.</p>

      <p>“I just wonder whyyyy the cat voice / dialogue. I am sure she is the sweetest sweet sweetheart forreal !! but it’s definitely bizarre seeing people blend the two worlds lmao,” Ariana replied to the vid.</p>
      <p>While some fans were concerned for Ariana (I mean, wouldn’t you be if you found out you basically had a secret twin?), others were LIVING for Paige. “She’s actually so sweet! she’s 14-15 (i can’t remember which one), and she was always told that she looks like you, so she just learned how to do makeup like yours!” a user wrote. “It’s not like she has gone out of her way to get surgeries and such. it’s sad how much hate she gets.”</p>
