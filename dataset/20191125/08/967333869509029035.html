        <b>New Delhi (Sputnik): Despite the popularity of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, during his visit to the southern state of Tamil Nadu in October to receive Chinese President Xi Jingping at an informal summit, there was a trending campaign on Twitter saying #GobackModi.</b>
      </p>
      <p>A Twitter backlash rallying around the hashtag <a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201910111077020315-gobackmodi-trending-on-twitter-ahead-of-indian-pms-chennai-meeting-with-chinas-xi-jinping/">#GoBackModi</a> has erupted during Modi’s election campaign in the eastern state of Jharkhand, where elections are scheduled to kick off on 30 November. </p>
      <p>The present trending hashtag is also a protest against failure of the ruling <a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201911241077383202-as-maharashtrapolitics-surprises-indians-in-overnight-coup-netizens-troll-losers-in-battle---/">Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) government</a> to fulfil the promises it made during the provincial legislature elections in 2014.  The affiliation of the twitter users of this campaign, however, was not known.</p>
