      <p>NEW DELHI/BENGALURU (Reuters) - Indian digital payments company Paytm said on Monday it has raised fresh funds from a group of investors including existing backers SoftBank’s (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/9984.T">9984.T</a>) Vision Fund and China’s Ant Financial Services in a deal valuing the firm at $16 billion.</p>
      <p>Paytm did not officially disclose details of the funding, but a source said the Indian company raised $1 billion in the latest round.</p>
      <p>SoftBank’s fresh investment in Paytm comes as the Japanese investment firm’s founder Masayoshi Son battles to restore his reputation after an ill-fated investment in office-sharing firm WeWork.</p>
      <p>New investment deals by SoftBank are also under growing scrutiny after the group reported its first quarterly loss in 14 years, dragged down by an $8.9 billion hit at Vision Fund.</p>
      <p>Paytm said on Monday it will expand into insurance, lending, stockbroking and investments and invest 100 billion rupees ($1.4 billion) over the next three years to bring in more users to its services.</p>
      <p>“This new investment by our current and new investors is a reaffirmation of our commitment to serve Indians with new-age financial services,” Paytm founder and chief executive Vijay Shekhar Sharma said in the statement.</p>
      <p>Other investors include Discovery Capital and funds advised by T. Rowe Price Associates.</p>
