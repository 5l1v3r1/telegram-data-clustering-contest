      <h2>A 170-year-old Dundee footbridge which collapsed during heavy rain earlier this year will be rebuilt in the spring, according to the council.</h2>

      <p>Finlathen Bridge, one of the main pedestrian routes between the communities of Fintry and Linlathen, has been out-of-action since the incident in July.</p>
      <p>Council workers have been investigating the cause and ttrying to figure out its future and have now confirmed it will be rebuilt to the same original design.</p>
      <p>Part of the existing bridge, including a leaning section of the parapet wall, will be torn down in the next few weeks due to safety concerns.</p>
      <p>Ron Neave from Fintry Community Council welcomed the update but said he was still fearful that further structural issues could be found.</p>
      <p>He said: “In just the past few weeks the tarpaulin that covered the collapsed section was torn off.</p>
      <p>“I believe this was vandalism and may have weakened the structure further from all the subsequent heavy rain.</p>
      <p>“We were told just recently that there was no update so I wonder if the council has decided to take action after the vandalism.</p>
      <p>“I do think there is a chance that because it’s so old, there could be further cracks found within it. That’s my main fear. I have also been worried about people walking or cycling underneath it.”</p>
      <p>The aqueduct collapsed on July 19 this year following a spell of prolonged heavy rain, just a few weeks after it was closed.</p>
      <p>Safety barriers had been erected after the walls began to bulge at one side.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for Dundee City Council said: “In the next few weeks engineers will de-construct a section of the bridge including the parapet wall which is currently leaning.</p>
      <p>“That, along with the section that collapsed will be re-built in spring next year as the lime mortar that has to be used is not suitable for low temperatures.</p>
      <p>“The appearance of the new constructed bridge will be the same as it was before.</p>
      <p>“Meanwhile we are continuing to keep movement at the bridge under review.”</p>
      <p>Built in 1846, the 500ft long bridge was originally constructed by the Dundee Water Company to carry the first water pipeline from Monikie over the Dighty valley to Dundee.</p>
