      <h3>Steve Bruce: ‘Aston Villa job was toughest of my career’ ahead of Newcastle’s trip to Villa Park</h3>
      <p>Meanwhile, as Steve Bruce returns to Villa Park with his Newcastle team tonight and, having been told about the animosity that has developed between two of the great underachievers of English football, bitterness sparked when Villa fans gleefully mocked Newcastle’s relegation to the Championship in 2008, Bruce could not resist joining in.</p>
      <p>“I knew they were bitter and twisted down there,” he laughed. “I didn’t get them promoted, we almost got there but lost the play off final.</p>
      <p>“When I arrived it was a mess, they hadn’t won away from home for something like 20 months. They’d won four games or something, it had the stench of relegation.</p>
      <p>“The players all had the pet lip because they had lost half their money [after relegation]. It was really really difficult, the morale was really low.  I said to [director of football] Steve Round, never mind getting promoted, we need to avoid another relegation first.</p>
      <p>“When we lost the play-off final, we were told there was a £30m hole in the finances. It was the worst and probably the most difficult six weeks after the play-off game, it unravelled we didn’t know if we would be paid, we almost sold Jack Grealish to Spurs just to keep the club going.”</p>
