        <b>NAIROBI, Kenya, Nov 25 – Mövenpick Hotel &amp; Residences Nairobi is lending a hand to those with limited life resources with the launch of its CSR Initiatives dubbed ‘Big Hearts Unwrap Big Smiles’</b>
      </p>
      <p>The newly launched CSR Initiative is in partnership with Feed the Children; one of the world’s leading anti-hunger organization.</p>
      <p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
      <p>According to Mehdi Morad, General Manager of Mövenpick Hotel &amp; Residences Nairobi, Mövenpick Nairobi is aiming to create a new and broader smile through daily food giveaway initiatives to those less fortunate in the society.</p>
      <p>“As part of our daily event planning, we prepare enough food to ensure all guests leave happy and the non-consumed food is well packaged and distributed daily to those in need,” said Morad.</p>
      <p>“We at Accor are deeply committed to giving back to the community and making a better life for them. We are encouraging all to join us in this initiative so that we can collectively continue to make a difference in the lives of many,” he added.</p>
      <p>“I am delighted we found this partnership. Together, we will realize our vision of a hunger-free childhood throughout the many acts of kindness”, added Seintje Veldhuis – Regional Director for Feed the Children Kenya.</p>
      <p>The campaign calls on guests who wish to take part to contribute by adding extra numbers to their event, and all the additional food goes to charity.</p>
