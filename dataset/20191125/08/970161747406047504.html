      <p>Owen Hargreaves has slammed <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/manchester-united-fc/">Manchester United</a>’s performance in their 3-3 draw with Sheffield United, while he felt <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/ole-gunnar-solskjaer/">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a>’s final sub handed the initiative back to the hosts.</p>
      <p>After going two goals down, the Red Devils enjoyed a frantic 10-minute spell that saw Brandon Williams, Mason Greenwood and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/marcus-rashford/">Marcus Rashford</a> all get on the score sheet – though the Blades recovered to net a last-gasp equaliser in a thrilling contest.</p>
      <p>United had been abject in the first half and there was little improvement after the break, and Hargreaves felt it was the worst he has seen the side play this season.</p>

      <p>‘Good luck making sense of that. For 70 minutes they were dreadful, they really were dreadful – that was probably their worst performance of the season,’ Hargreaves told the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/premier-league/">Premier League</a>.</p>

      <p>‘The first half was a disaster, nothing short of. Sheffield United should have been up by more goals, but he [Solskjaer] made changes.</p>
      <p>‘The one thing you can take from it is that the young kids stepped up, so almost kind of out with the old, in with the young guys. That’s what you’ll get from today. Because his team shape and the inclusion of Phil Jones did not work.’</p>
      <p>After taking the lead late on, Solskjaer used his third and final sub to take off Anthony Martial for Axel Tuanzebe, playing the defender in holding midfield, but Hargreaves felt it was the wrong call.</p>
      <p>He continued: ‘If you think back to the last goal from Sheffield United, Tuanzebe is a centre-back, he came on the pitch and played in midfield to shore it up. Really you would do that with a more experienced player, to come in.</p>

      <p>‘That’s not even his natural position, but he wanted someone in there to protect and essentially it didn’t really work. Really, under the philosophy of Man United and Sir Alex, you probably would have thought with the game as it was, there was a fourth goal in it for United.</p>

      <p>‘Get the fourth and kill it off. But because he didn’t have that experience in there he put on Tuanzebe to protect and it went the other way. I really like him, but that last sub maybe didn’t go the way Ole wanted.’</p>
