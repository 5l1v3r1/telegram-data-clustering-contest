      <p>The tourism sector calls on the Members of the <b>European Parliament</b> to vote within their political groups in support of the re-establishment of the <i>Sustainable Tourism Intergroup</i>. Due to its horizontal nature, its positive impact in the EU economy, and its many challenges, tourism deserves to be heard through a dedicated intergroup.</p>
      <p>In economic terms, tourism is the 3rd largest socio-economic activity in Europe and the backbone of the EU economy. It supports 27,3 million jobs, including 13 million direct jobs to the European economy, in 2 million enterprises and contributes by 10% to the EU GDP.</p>
      <p>The 2014-2019 Tourism Intergroup proved to play a valuable role to help coordinate all policy areas impacting tourism, therefore contributing to Europe’s growth and jobs. The Intergroup covered diverse topics, including visa and border management, sustainability, digitalisation, platform economy, food, health, consumer protection, tourism tax, accessibility, amongst others. By voting for its re-establishment, the Intergroup will foster a constructive and coordinated exchange of views between MEPs from various committees and other EU stakeholders on key topics, which will lead to balanced policy recommendations. The Intergroup will enable the joined up thinking between transport, energy, tourism, regional policy, allow engagement with broader sustainability discussions (e.g. emission targets).</p>
      <p>Tourism counts with the support of Commissioner-elect for the Internal Market, <b>Thierry Breton</b>, who referred to tourism in his written replies to the European Parliament and its many challenges: mass tourism which is hardly sustainable; the emergence of new actors such as platforms and the necessity to have a skilled workforce. The diversity of these challenges require a dedicated platform for discussion, such as the Intergroup.</p>
