      <p><b>Parliament Winter Session LIVE Updates:</b> The <a href="http://www.financialexpress.com/tag/congress/">Congress</a> has claimed that party MPs were pushed out of Lok Sabha by Marshals while they were protesting against the recent political developments in Maharashtra. Congress MP Hibi Eden alleged that party leaders were protesting inside the house in a ‘democratic’ manner but they were taken out of the House forcefully. “They tried to get banners from us and our colleagues tried to resist it, our women colleagues were manhandled too,” Eden said.</p>
      <p>Earlier, speaking in Lok Sabha amid sloganeering by the Opposition benches, Congress leader <a href="http://www.financialexpress.com/tag/rahul-gandhi/">Rahul Gandhi</a> accused the Centre of murdering democracy in Maharashtra. “Democracy has been murdered in Maharashtra,” Rahul Gandhi said in Lok Sabha as the Opposition created an uproar in the Lower House over Maharashtra politics. Both Houses of Parliament were adjourned amid protests by the Opposition against the manner in which Devendra Fadnavis took oath as Maharashtra CM and Ajit Pawar as his deputy last Saturday.</p>
      <p>The Congress had earlier said it will stall proceedings in both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha over the manner in which <a href="http://www.financialexpress.com/tag/bharatiya-janata-party/">BJP</a>’s Devendra Fadnavis was sworn in as Maharashtra CM in an early morning ceremony last Saturday. The Congress parliamentary strategy group, which includes Ghulam Nabi Azad, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury and K C Venugopal, met at party chief <a href="http://www.financialexpress.com/tag/sonia-gandhi/">Sonia Gandhi</a>’s residence in New Delhi.</p>
      <p>After Fadnavis returned as the chief minister on Saturday, the Shiv Sena claimed that the Sena-NCP-Congress combine has a support of 165 MLAs and can comfortably prove its majority in the Assembly. The BJP has claimed that Fadnavis had the support of 170 MLAs. The majority mark in a House of 288 is 145. Meanwhile, the government will celebrate ‘Constitution Day’ or ‘Samvidhan Diwas’ on Tuesday, November 26, in the Central Hall of Parliament to mark the 70th anniversary of adoption of the Constitution by the Constituent Assembly. President Ram Nath Kovind, Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu, Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla and Prime Minister <a href="http://www.financialexpress.com/tag/narendra-modi/">Narendra Modi</a> will address the MPs on the occasion.</p>
