      <p>A 23-year-old woman has given birth to a boy with two heads and three hands at a hospital in Madhya Pradesh’s Vidisha district, an official said on Monday.</p>
      <p>Babita Ahirwar on Saturday delivered the baby, weighing 3.3 kg and having conjoined heads, three hands and four palms, Vidisha district hospital’s civil surgeon Sanjay Khare said.</p>
      <p>Soon after birth, the child was kept in the hospital’s Intensive Care Unit (ICU) as he was unwell, the woman’s husband Jaswant Ahirwar said.</p>
      <p>But, after his condition deteriorated, he was shifted to a hospital in Bhopal for advanced health care, he said.</p>
      <p>Jaswant Ahirwar, a labourer who is a resident of Suja village, located around 60 km from here, said he got married to Babita last year and the boy was their first child.</p>
