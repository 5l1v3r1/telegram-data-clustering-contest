      <p>EY has put about 100 jobs in its financial consulting unit at risk of redundancy after a decline in work and a drop-off in fees made from regulatory advice.</p>
      <p>The Big Four accounting firm, which last week revealed revenues generated by its advisory business had shrunk 3 per cent in 2019, initially earmarked 350 roles that could be axed, according to one person close to the company.</p>
      <p>The staff affected work at EY’s office in London’s Canary Wharf and the departures will include a small number of salaried partners, the person said.</p>
      <p>EY’s UK revenues grew 1.5 per cent to £2.45 billion (€2.86 billion) in 2019, its slowest rate in several years, although profits increased by £5 million to £477 million. The average pay received by EY’s partners dropped from £693,000 to £679,000 after the number of partners rose from 681 to 702.</p>
      <p>One person close to the company blamed the redundancies in part on a lack of business from Lloyds Banking Group. EY has previously provided a number of advisory services to the UK bank, including reviewing its environmental, social and governance annual investor report.</p>
      <p>In 2012 EY’s Big Four rival <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=PwC">PwC</a> claimed in a submission to the <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=Competition+Commission">Competition Commission</a> that EY was targeting a takeover of its audit of Lloyds. PwC’s 153-year role as Lloyds’ auditor ended last year when it was replaced by <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Deloitte">Deloitte</a>.</p>
      <h3>Routine review</h3>
      <p>EY denied the redundancies were linked to any single client.</p>
      <p>“We routinely review our business and staffing structures to ensure they can best meet client demand and market conditions,” it said. “The proposed redundancies are not linked to any one client - it is in response to the change in the mix of our business.”</p>
      <p>It is the latest cost-cutting measure being implemented by a Big Four accountant as the grouping faces a major overhaul in the UK. The government is considering recommendations from the competition watchdog to force a separation of audit and consulting businesses.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=KPMG">KPMG</a> has launched Project Zebra to save £100 million in costs through restricting the use of staff mobile phones, axing a third of its personal assistants and selling the lease of its Mayfair members’ club, Number Twenty.</p>
      <p>EY has been investing heavily in its UK audit practice by about £25 million a year and has sought to gain more banking clients. It won its first major banking audit for the <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Royal+Bank+of+Scotland">Royal Bank of Scotland</a> in 2014. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2019</p>
