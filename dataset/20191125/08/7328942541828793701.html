      <p>Also, the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/elon-musk-again-tries-impress-his-cybertruck-time-without-sledgehammer-n1090381">glass</a> of Cybertruck is said to be "bulletproof" but the testing went completely wrong. Two steel balls were thrown by the company's chief designer which broke the glass of the vehicle. Elon Musk's comment on the situation was "Ah man, it didn't go through." </p>

      <p>Even though some funny comments were made about the Cybertruck and it's the biggest material for memes nowadays, Elon Musk is pretty proud of his new vehicle and never stops to promote the best and the coolest sides of the new Cybertruck.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, a new experiment was done with the Cybertruck. In the video, you can see the Cybertruck pulling an F-150 vehicle, and doing it pretty smoothly. </p>

      <p>I guess it's the way of Elon Musk to say "On your face, Cybertruck haters!" </p>
      <p>After the video, there was a conflict between Cybertruck lovers and Cybertruck haters. </p>
