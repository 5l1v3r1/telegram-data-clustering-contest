      <h1>US Police Already Using 'Spot' Robot From Boston Dynamics In the Real World</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T08:50:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 08:50</time> by <a rel="author">BeauHD</a></address>
      <p>Massachusetts State Police (MSP) has been quietly <a href="https://gizmodo.com/u-s-police-already-using-spot-robot-from-boston-dynami-1840029868">testing ways to use the four-legged Boston Dynamics robot known as Spot</a>, according to <a href="https://data.aclum.org/public-records/use-of-robotics-in-law-enforcement/">new documents</a> obtained by the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts. And while Spot isn't equipped with a weapon just yet, the documents provide a terrifying peek at our RoboCop future. Gizmodo reports: <i>The Spot robot, which was officially made available for lease to businesses last month, has been in use by MSP since at least April 2019 and has engaged in at least two police "incidents," though it's not clear what those incidents may have been. It's also not clear whether the robots were being operated by a human controller or how much autonomous action the robots are allowed. MSP did not respond to Gizmodo's emails on Monday morning. <br/><br/>The newly obtained documents, first reported by Ally Jarmanning at <a href="https://www.wbur.org/news/2019/11/25/boston-dynamics-robot-dog-massachusetts-state-police">WBUR in Boston</a>, include emails and contracts that shed some light on how police departments of the future may use robots to engage suspects without putting human police in harm's way. In one document written by Lt. Robert G. Schumaker robots are described as an "invaluable component of tactical operations" that are vital to support the state's "Homeland Security Strategy." [...] The question that remains is whether the American public will simply accept robocops as our reality now. Unfortunately, it seems like we may not have any choice in the matter -- especially when the only way that we can learn about this new robot-police partnership is through records requests by the ACLU. And even then, we're still largely in the dark about how these things will be used.</i></p>
