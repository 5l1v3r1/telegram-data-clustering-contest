      <p>Is there any bigger mood than Post Malone living his best life to Shania Twain?</p>
      <p>Because if so, we’ve yet to find it.</p>
      <p>The rapper was serving majorly relatable vibes as he owned his prerogrative to have a little fun at the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/american-music-awards/">American Music Awards</a> while country legend Shania performed an epic medley.</p>
      <p>Marking her upcoming Las Vegas residency – side note, booking flights to Sin City ASAP – Shania, 54, returned to the AMAs stage for the first time since 2003 to bless us with a medley of her own classics and other chart hits.</p>
      <p>The pop-country star first delivered a medley of Twenty One Pilots’ Stressed Out, Taylor Swift’s Shake It Off and Drake’s God’s Plan – played on a glittering pink guitar – before seguing into her slow-set classic, You’re Still The One.</p>

      <p>But the tempo soon ramped up, as Shania – dressed in a ruffled pink dress and an orange bodysuit and surrounded by line-dancing cowboys – then performed Any Man Of Mine, That</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>Don’t Impress Me Much and girl power anthem Man! I Feel Like A Woman.</p>
      <p>And it was the final tune that Post Malone, 24, was living for, as video from inside the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles showed the Sunflower star dancing and singing every world as if he were at a particularly glitzy hen do.</p>
      <p>The star, real name Austin Richard post, ditched his seat to dance around with a beer in hand, and you can practically feel the joy radiating off the screen.</p>

      <p>While Shania’s medley was obviously the highlight of the night for Post, the rapper had a pretty great evening elsewhere too.</p>
      <p>Post took to the stage with fellow rapper Travis Scott and rock legend Ozzy Osbourne for an epic performance of Take What You Want which saw the stage bathed in smoke and flames.</p>
      <p>Then the Rock Star rapper made it back on stage as he beat Travis and Meek Mill to win Favourite Album – Rap/Hip-Hop for Hollywood’s Bleeding – and he gave a rather random speech to celebrate his win.</p>
      <p>Post said: ‘Thank you very very very very much. I’m not too good at talking in front of people. But I just want to say thank you so much to everybody who’s shown love and support.</p>

      <p>‘Honestly, words cannot express how grateful and thankful I am for everything that y’all show me.</p>
      <p>‘Thank you to all the camp and the team. Thank you for all the fans for showing love and support. We busted our a** for it.’</p>
      <p>He concluded: ‘We love you very much and I love grapes.’</p>
      <p>Don’t we all, Post, don’t we all.</p>
