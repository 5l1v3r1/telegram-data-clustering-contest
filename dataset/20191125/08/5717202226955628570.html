      <h1>Everton should swoop on Rafael Leao in January if loan reports come true</h1>
      <h2>Everton failed to sign the Portuguese talent in the summer, according to reports.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T08:45:56+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 08:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/mathewcoull/" target="_blank">Mathew Nash</a></address>
      <p>A report in Italy is suggesting what the impact of Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s move to AC Milan could mean for two of the club’s younger attacking talents. </p>
      <p>One of Krzysztof Piatek or Rafael Leao could be loaned out if the Swedish veteran returns to the Rossoneri, <a href="https://www.calciomercato.com/news/milan-ibrahimovic-fa-fuori-piatek-o-leao-ipotesi-prestito-le-str-27174">according to Calciomercato.</a> </p>
      <p>If that is the case, it should be of particular interest to Everton. </p>
      <p>Leao was a reported summer target for Everton. The Portuguese talent was identified as a potential future star and, <a href="https://www.lavoixdunord.fr/613379/article/2019-07-15/ligue-1-quatre-clubs-envisagent-de-mettre-40-millions-sur-rafael-leao">as reported by La Voix du Nord</a>, Everton made an offer worth €40 million (£36 million) for the player in the summer.</p>

      <p>However, Leao ended up joining Milan. In fact, as reported by Fabrizio Romano, Leao turned down a potential Everton move in order to join the Italian giants. </p>
      <p>Everton went on to sign Moise Kean from Juventus in a deal that has failed to take flight. Leao, who can play in a number of attacking positions, could certainly help Everton add some intensity to their currently tepid attack. </p>
      <p>If the 20-year-old does become available for loan in January then Everton should surely be interested in finally getting their hands on the 6ft 2ins powerhouse.</p>
