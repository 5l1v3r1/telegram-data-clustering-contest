      <p><pic src="https://www.guru3d.com/news_teaserimage/14738"/>The electric pickup truck presented by Tesla on Friday (that caused quite a big of commotion) was reserved nearly 187,000 times after just a day and a half, writes Tesla CEO Elon Musk on Twitter. According to him, his company has not spent a penny on advertisements and other promotions.</p>
      <p>Although Tesla's Cybertruck is not as successful in terms of reservations as the Model 3, for which there were around 180,000 reservations within the first 24 hours, the company recorded at least 146,000 non-binding reservations during this period.</p>
      <p>The Cybertruck is available in three variants and will be put into production from 2021, Tesla reports. Two of these variants have multiple engines. The first shared figures from Musk show that these versions are the most popular. Eight out of ten customers choose one of these more expensive options. The more expensive versions draw more weight than the pick-up truck with one engine and can also cover more kilometers on a single battery charge (480 and 800 kilometers compared to 400 kilometers). In addition, both vehicles accelerate faster than the cheaper option.</p>
      <h3>Details about the Cybertruck released by Tesla</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>5.88 meters long, more than 2 meters wide.</li>
        <li>Cheapest variant can pull more than 3,400 kilos.</li>
        <li>Car can park itself and can accommodate six people.</li>
        <li>2,831 liters of luggage space available.</li>
        <li>Multiple sockets of 110 and 240 volts on board.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>The presentation did not go smoothly</h3>
      <p>Incidentally, the presentation of the Cybertruck was not entirely flawless. Musk claimed that a blow with a large hammer would not leave a scratch and that the car was bulletproof to a certain extent. As part of the presentation, a metal ball was thrown against the car, which nevertheless left a large crack in the window. Musk later tweeted another video in which the windows passed the test.</p>
      <p>On social media, however, there was mainly debate about the futuristic design of the car. Initially, Tesla seemed to have to swallow a financial setback, after the company's share in a short time worth 6 percent less. The Tesla CEO has been talking about a potential Tesla pick-up truck for years. In 2012 he played with the idea of delivering such a vehicle with a futuristic design for the first time. Now the brand has to compete with Ford, which has had the best-selling pickup truck in the US for years with the F-150.</p>
