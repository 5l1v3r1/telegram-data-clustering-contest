      <p>In case James Argent needed any more of an idea – Gemma Collins wants you to put a ring on it. And fast.</p>
      <p>The Towie star made it absolutely clear she wants to get married and she wants to get married soon, as she made a rather pointed statement to her on/off boyfriend with whom she is very much ‘on’ with right now.</p>
      <p>As she joined Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid on Good Morning Britain on Monday, Gemma enthused her usually rather dramatic relationship with Arg is ‘good’ as Piers attempted to get some tea from the reality star.</p>

      <p>‘It’s very much on – James are you up out of bed?’ she joked to the telly screen, later adding she knew full well her boyfriend was still asleep. It was the crack of dawn, after all.</p>

      <p>After Piers pressed her for more information as to whether they were on, GC replied: ‘Yes, well…yes. Last time I spoke to him [last night] we were.</p>
      <p>‘But you never know, things may be different this morning.’</p>
      <p>It was recently claimed the two were on rocky shores yet again, having not been spotted together since a trip to Italy earlier this year.</p>
      <p>Fast forward to now and not only is the pair back in love but, Gemma, 38, taunted 31-year-old Arg’s matrimonial tendencies as she teased: ‘I’m waiting [for wedding bells] aren’t I?’</p>

      <p>Well, it’s clear what Gemma is after!</p>
      <p>The pair have been dating for the better part of a decade, albeit with several breaks over the years, and Piers felt the approach to Christmas was the perfect time to get on bended knee and bling up the GC with a diamond sparkler.</p>
      <p>‘I can’t wait much longer,’ Gem said in her iconic drawl.</p>
      <p>‘It’s either soon or I’m out of there.’</p>
      <p>She added: ‘I am getting a little older now I need the big bling on my finger. If it’s meant to be…I don’t lose sleep out of it.</p>

      <p>‘I need to be made an honest woman.’</p>
      <p>Speaking directly to the camera, the podcaster demanded: ‘Call De Beers diamonds now James, wakey wakey!’</p>
      <p>Declaring she wanted a ring ‘like Elizabeth Taylor’s’ – which one of Liz’s engagement rings wasn’t made clear – Piers laughed: ‘It can’t get more direct than that, James.’</p>
      <p>You heard the woman, Arg.</p>
      <p>The GC and James recently reunited during a romantic trip to Dubai <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/14/gemma-collins-james-argent-vow-diet-together-getting-married-starting-family-11147282/">amid claims they’re keen to have a family pronto.</a></p>
      <p>They’ve had a tough few months after the Celebrity Big Brother icon was <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/20/james-argent-embarrassed-gemma-collins-calls-emergency-services-concerns-welfare-10949850/">reportedly forced to call the police</a> over fears her boyfriend had overdosed.</p>
      <p>The lovebirds hit the headlines after it was stated that Mark Wright’s best pal failed to answer messages from those closest to him, prompting the GC to ring the emergency services. But an insider claimed they are ‘more in love than ever’ after working through the drama.</p>
      <p>Best of luck to ‘em.</p>
