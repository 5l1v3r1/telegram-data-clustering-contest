      <p>Winning on the lottery is all about luck - and trying to make sure you had you had your share of good fortune was a big deal for the Romans.</p>
      <p>As part of events at Tyne Wear Museums to mark the 25th anniversary of the National Lottery, archaeologist Alex Croom will lead a tour and object-handling session looking at the themes of luck and fortune in the Roman Gallery exhibition at Segedunum fort in <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/wallsend">Wallsend</a> .</p>
      <p>The 11am event tomorrow is free to Lotto players aged 16 and over who have a ticket which is valid for draws up until December 1. This applies to all events in the TWAM lottery anniversary programme.</p>

      <p>The Segedunum tour will examine items excavated at the fort, including a statue to the goddess Fortuna, dice, a small shrine to the gods used to ask their protection, and the charm centrepieces of rings.</p>
      <p>“Fortuna was one of the most popular deities who covered luck in all aspects of life, from soldiers in battle to merchants in business,” said Alex, keeper of archaeology at Tyne Wear Museums.</p>
      <p>“Luck and good fortune were especially important because of the uncertainties of life and you needed the co-operation of Fortuna.”</p>
      <p>There will also be two sessions for people to hear the latest sound recordings that have been digitised in a museums project.</p>
      <p>The “Unlocking Our Sound Heritage” project is delving into North East and Yorkshire recordings which include people talking about their home, social, wartime and working lives, classical and popular music, Northumbrian dialect, radio programmes, wildlife recordings, speeches, and the sounds of industry.</p>

      <p>The British Library venture has been backed by a £9.5million National Lottery grant, with Tyne &amp; Wear Archives &amp;amp; Museums (TWAM) the lead partner for the project in the North East and Yorkshire.</p>
      <p>It will save almost half-a-million recordings that are threatened by physical degradation, or stored on formats that can no longer be played.</p>
      <p>The first session is today from 10am-12.30pm at South Shields Museum, when visitors will be the first to hear digitised items such as tapes used by Catherine Cookson, the South Shields Ladies football Club song and oral histories recorded by local people.</p>
      <p>The second session is on Thursday from 1pm-4pm at Newcastle Discovery Museum, which will include oral histories by local people, music, news reports and the first ringing of the carillon at Newcastle Civic Centre.</p>

      <p>There’s also a chance to handle a selection of items covering local and social history and art at South Shields Museum on Wednesday from 11am-noon and 2pm-3pm; free entry to the Planetarium at the Great North Museum until December 1, plus 20% discount on admission to The Enchanted Interior exhibition at the Laing Art Gallery until November 30.</p>
      <p>Iain Watson, director at Tyne &amp; Wear Archives &amp;  Museums, said: “Funding from the National Lottery has enabled us to achieve truly great things over the years, from refurbishing museums to delivering community engagement projects.</p>
      <p>“That is why we are offering these treats to people who visit our venues with a Lotto ticket – it’s a way of saying thank you to the people have helped fund us.”</p>
