      <h1>This Is Our Last Week In Sa, Say Foreigners Who Plan To Walk To Nearest Border</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T08:44:47+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 08:44</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.iafrica.com/author/suzziegitau/" target="_blank">SG Editor</a></address>
      <p>Foreign nationals who have sought shelter at a church in Cape Town’s city centre said they would walk to the nearest border this week.</p>
      <p>The group has been living at the Methodist chapel for several weeks after being removed from outside the UN Refugee Agency offices.</p>
      <p>They’re calling for help to leave South Africa as they fear xenophobic tensions.</p>
      <p>Refugee activist JP Balous said they plan to leave the country by walking to the nearest border.</p>
      <p>“We are tired and we want to leave South Africa. We have this week and this week is our last.”</p>
      <p>For weeks, hundreds of foreign nationals have been urging the UN Refugee Agency to assist them to leave the country.</p>
      <p>In response the UN said they cannot do group resettlement. But Balous said they have had enough.</p>
      <p>About a week ago, they were also told to leave the church where they’ve been staying for just less than a month.</p>
