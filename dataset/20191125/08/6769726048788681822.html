      <p>THE demise of the Australian built Holden Commodore was a sad day for Commodore fans everywhere. As we mourned the loss of an Australian icon new cars began to pop up on the horizon that could fill this void, albeit some more successfully than others.</p>
      <p>One that has been successful is the Skoda Octavia RS.</p>
      <p>The sporty Octavia comes in both sedan and wagon with different variants on offer.</p>
      <p>We hit the road in the Octavia RS Wagon to see how well she performed in real life.</p>
      <p>A first impression, the Octavia is a smart looking car. The dual LED headlights guide your eyes in and across the aggressive black grille with the RS badge glinting out from the corner, a nice stylish touch. The Rims are impressive and dark enough to complement the grille yet light enough to allow the bright red calipers underneath to shine through. I mean if it doesn’t have red calipers you need to ask yourself, is it even a sports car? The back looks just as good with the exhaust leaving me reminiscent of a Lamborghini’s tail lights.</p>
      <p>Enough about the looks, how did she drive?</p>
      <p>The Octavia RS has the heart of a VW Golf GTi one of the many perks of being owned by the Volkswagen Group.</p>
      <p>City driving was a breeze but something that we all know I love that the RS has buckets of – power.</p>
      <p>There’s a special place in hell for people who sit 10km under the speed limit even more so for those who do 60 in a 100 zone (you know who are).</p>
      <p>Overtaking was so easy and precise it’s like the Octavia had a mind of its own and rolled its eyes for you as the overtaking lane merges back into one.</p>
      <p>All of this coupled with a comfortable and well-appointed interior makes for a car I’d happily add to the garage.</p>
      <p>It’s so versatile it would keep Mum and Dad happy doing the Saturday morning sport run or cruising up the freeway to the office in style. It’s simply clever.</p>
      <p>Head into Mandurah Skoda at 146 Pinjarra Road let the friendly staff fix you a cuppa and check out the Skoda Octavia RS.</p>
