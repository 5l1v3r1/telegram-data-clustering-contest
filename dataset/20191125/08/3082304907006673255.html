        <b>According to reports, La Liga giants Real Madrid have been dealt a major blow as Paris Saint Germain (PSG) expressed “optimism” in Kylian Mbappe’s contract situation.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 20-year-old is all set to agree on a new contract at the Parc des Princes, says <i><a href="https://www.marca.com/en/football/real-madrid/2019/11/24/5ddb0971ca47418b278b45a7.html">Marca</a></i>. This is amidst reports that Real Madrid is genuinely interested in him, and was looking to bring him over to the Santiago Bernabeu next summer, ahead of the 2020-21 season.</p>
      <p><i>Marca</i> reports that things are “moving slowly” between PSG and Mbappe, but at the same time, it cannot be said that the French club have not been clear with the forward.</p>
      <p>As per the Spanish news agency’s claims, PSG’s Sporting Director Leonardo has prioritised renewing Mbappe’s contract over that of his teammate Neymar Jr.</p>
      <p>The 2018 FIFA World Cup winner’s current contract with the Parisians is set to expire in 2022. Meanwhile <i>L’Equipe</i>, a French publication, also reports that the “atmosphere” at PSG is a lot better now compared to a few months ago, and that recent talks make PSG more “optimistic” that he will extend his contract.</p>
      <p>Both newspapers, however, also add that despite the air of optimism surrounding Mbappe’s supposed contract extension with the Ligue 1 defending champions, no concrete steps to ensure the deal have been taken yet.</p>
