      <p>President of the Omega Fire Ministries Worldwide Apostle Suleman Johnson says when a believer is broke, God is “not happy”.</p>
      <p><a href="http://concisenews.global/news">Concise News</a> reports that at a church service recently, the fiery preacher stressed that God promises the believers riches.</p>
      <p>“Scarcity worries God. Your scarcity troubles him. When your are broke; you are stranded, God is not happy. When that Landlord is throwing out your things because you have not paid your rent, God is grieved.</p>
      <p>“You can’t serve The Most High and be most low,” Suleman states.</p>

      <h3>Apostle Suleman Fulfills Promise To Nigerians In South Africa</h3>
      <p>Meanwhile, Apostle Suleman days ago <a href="https://www.concisenews.global/2019/11/16/apostle-suleman-fulfills-promise-to-nigerians-in-south-africa/">fulfilled his vow of airlifting 20 Nigerians from South Africa</a>.</p>
      <p>Recall that the televangelist had made the<a href="https://www.concisenews.global/2019/09/12/xenophobia-apostle-johnson-suleman-to-airlift-nigerians-from-south-africa/"> vow to finance the return of 20 Nigerians</a> residing in South Africa, following renewed xenophobic attacks.</p>
      <p>The clergyman had in a tweet said “Just heard 900 Nigerians want to return home from SA,” he said. “I asked the flight tickets be bought for 20 Nigerians in South Africa who want to return home.</p>
      <p>“I will take care of the cost; please, register at out church in Johannesburg; We will airlift more by God’s grace. God keep you all alive.”</p>
      <p>In a tweet on Friday, November 15, Apostle Suleman announced that the 20 Nigerians are back to the country.</p>
      <p>He also stated that they received N1.3 support, just as he apologised for his absence at the airport to receive them.</p>
      <p>“God helped us to bring back 20 South African returnees who were eager to come home and gave them N1.3m little support. Sorry I wasn’t at the airport to receive you. @RAyemoba our able servant of God, thanks for standing in for me,” apostle Suleman tweeted.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.concisenews.global/2019/09/02/xenophobia-again-south-africans-attack-loot-burn-foreign-owned-businesses/">South Africans on September 1 begun fresh attacks</a>, looting and burning of businesses and properties belonging to foreigners and in the process killed three people, while another is still receiving treatment for smoke inhalation.</p>
      <p>This platform earlier reported that the <a href="https://www.concisenews.global/2019/09/12/xenophobia-187-nigerians-return-from-south-africa/">first batch of 187 Nigerians in South Africa returned to Nigeria on September 11.</a></p>
      <p>The Nigerian government, <a href="https://www.concisenews.global/2019/09/05/air-peace-offers-to-lift-nigerians-for-free-from-south-africa/">with the support of Air Peace,</a> aided the return of the Nigerians.</p>
