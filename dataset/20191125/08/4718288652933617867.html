      <p>PUNE: The widow of Vasantdada Patil, who was bested 41 years ago in a cloak-and-dagger power struggle for the post of chef minister by a young Sharad Pawar, on Sunday claimed Ajit Pawar's volte face was poetic justice.</p>
      <p>Ajit Pawar, in a dramatic turn of events early Saturday morning, walked into Raj Bhavan with a handful of NCP MLAs and was sworn in as deputy to chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, leaving Pawar senior defending his flock by sequestering them in a suburban hotel.</p>
      <p>Speaking on the political developments precipitated by Ajit Pawar, Shalini Patil, widow of Vasantdada, said, "The way Sharad Pawar behaved with Vasantrao, he must have got a similar experience from his family when Ajit Pawar aligned with the BJP."</p>
      <p>Ajit Pawar is nephew of the NCP supremo and there has been often talk of the party being in the midst of a familial power struggle also involving Baramati Lok Sabha MP and Pawar senior's daughter Supriya Sule.</p>
      <p>Shalini Patil called Pawar's 1978 move to grab power an "act of betrayal and stabbing in the back".</p>
      <p>Pawar could have told Vasantdada directly instead of breaking away clandestinely, she said.</p>
      <p>Patil was expelled from the NCP in 2006 for her "anti-party stand" on the issue of social justice.</p>
      <p>In the state Assembly polls held in February 1978, the Congress (S) won 69 seats as against 65 of Congress (I).</p>
      <p>The Janta Party had won 99 seats.</p>
      <p>No party got a full majority.</p>
      <p>The two Congress factions got together to form the government headed by Vasantdada Patil from Congress (S) with Nashikrao Tirpude from Congress (I) as the Deputy Chief Minister.</p>
      <p>As the government floundered amid daily bickering, Pawar walked out with 38 Congress MLAs to form a new government called Samantar Congress (Parallel Congress), becoming the youngest chief minister of the state at the age of 38.</p>
      <p>The government lasted for less than two years.</p>
