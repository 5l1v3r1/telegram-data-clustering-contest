        <figcaption>What is Storm Sebastian?</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Storm Sebastien is set to bring gale-force winds and torrential rain to the UK for days on end this week, according to the latest forecast.</p>
      <p>Waves could by 22ft in places as the remains of the tropical storm lash the UK.</p>
      <p>Three weather warnings have been issued by the Met Office for the first three days of the week, forecasting heavy rain across parts of the country.</p>
      <p>The first, which ends at 10am today, was for up to 25mm of rain across the South West and South Wales.</p>
      <p>The second, tomorrow, covers South Wales, the South West and the South East and lasts until 3pm on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>We could see up to two weeks of rain in a few hours.</p>
      <p>And a final warning will be in place in Yorkshire from midnight on Tuesday to 6pm on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>As much as 60mm of rain could hit parts of the region, almost half of the 121mm average total for November.</p>
      <p>Met Office forecaster Marco Petagna told <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10413776/uk-weather-forecast-flood-rain-britain-flooding/">The Sun</a> : “Remnants of Tropical Storm Sebastien mean it will be windy on Tuesday into Wednesday with gales in the South and South-West, and high spring tides.</p>
      <p>“It's not a pretty picture, with warnings for rain for the next few days after some places had three times their normal rain in the first half of the month."</p>
      <p>Tropical Storm Sebastien was feared to be on the verge of becoming a hurricane, with swirling 60mph winds.</p>
      <p>It has broken up as the last storm of the season crossed the Atlantic, but will still bring foul weather to the country over the next few days.</p>
