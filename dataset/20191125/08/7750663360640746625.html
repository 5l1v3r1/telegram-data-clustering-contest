      <p>Often, major regulations changes lead to utter dominance. Indeed, since the 'power unit' era began in 2014, Mercedes has won every single title.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/formula-1/ferrari/"><b>Ferrari</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/formula-1/red-bull/"><b>Red Bull</b></a>-Honda have arguably now caught up, but former team boss and owner Jordan told the Gulf News that the top drivers will continue to shine in 2021.</p>
      <p>"I think great drivers attract great teams," he said.</p>
      <p>"I wouldn't worry too much about the regulations going forward. Lewis will have a good car, Verstappen will have one too, Leclerc will also have a good car."</p>
      <p>But he thinks Hamilton deserves to still be regarded as the favourite, even though young chargers like <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/max-verstappen/"><b>Max Verstappen</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/charles-leclerc/"><b>Charles Leclerc</b></a> are on his heels.</p>
      <p>"Honestly, he doesn't need to get much better. He just needs to continue because there is nobody really out there to challenge him," said Jordan.</p>
      <p>"Perhaps he took his eye off the ball against Nico Rosberg. Nico is a clever one as he decided to retire as he would have never won another championship if Lewis continued the way he has just done.</p>
      <p>"Having said that Lewis is in his own realm. He can dominate the way he wants."</p>
