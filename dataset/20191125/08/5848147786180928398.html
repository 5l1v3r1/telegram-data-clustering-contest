      <h1>Jacqui Lambie close to deal on refugee transfers</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T08:56:08+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 08:56</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/author/daniel-mcculloch/" target="_blank">Daniel McCulloch</a></address>
      <p>Refugee medical transfer laws imposed against the federal government’s will could be unwound by the end of this week.</p>
      <p>Parliament resumes on Monday for the last sitting fortnight of the year, with the government intending to put its medevac repeal bill to a vote in the Senate this week.</p>
      <p>Tasmanian independent senator Jacqui Lambie will ultimately cast the deciding ballot.</p>
      <p>Senator Lambie will meet with Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Monday to discuss amendments that could ease her concerns about dismantling the medevac regime.</p>
      <p>The Senate crossbencher is also expected to meet with Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton.</p>
      <p>“Anything that’s got to do with humanity is always really, really difficult to have to take a vote on, so that’s why I’m taking a little bit longer than I know that many people would have hoped,” Senator Lambie said on Sunday.</p>
      <p>“Hopefully, over the next few days, between myself and Peter Dutton, we can get this sorted and certainly get a vote taken.”</p>
      <p>Senator Lambie has indicated she wants to land a deal that amends the system, without giving the government the full repeal that it wants.</p>
      <p>“I think what you’ll find with medevac is it may not look like it does today,” she said.</p>
      <p>More than 150 refugees and asylum seekers have come to Australia under the medevac laws.</p>
      <p>The government claims the scheme weakens border protection, because it limits the discretion of the minister to rule on each transfer.</p>
      <p>“From our point of view it is very important that the medevac legislation is repealed,” Finance Minister Mathias Cormann told ABC radio.</p>
      <p>“Labor, in the lead up to the last election, forced legislation through the parliament that essentially outsourced our migration system and a key feature of our national security arrangements to advocates who happen to also be doctors.</p>
      <p>“Medical transfers were available before the legislation, they will be available after the legislation has been repealed, but subject to more appropriate safeguards.</p>
      <p>“The current arrangements are putting our national security arrangements at risk.”</p>
