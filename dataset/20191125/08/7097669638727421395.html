      <h1>British man and wife rescued from Islamic State militants in the Philippines after being held for two months</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T08:09:48+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 08:09</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/" target="_blank">Jamie Johnson</a></address>
      <p>A British man and his wife have been rescued from Islamic State-linked jihadists nearly two months after being taken  from their beach resort in the nation's south, authorities have said.</p>
      <p>Allan Hyrons, 70, and his wife Welma Paglinawan-Hyrons were abducted from a beach resort in Mindanao on October 4, but were freed after a gun fight between their captors and government soldiers.</p>
      <p>Filipino troops recovered the pair after overwhelming gunmen from the Abu Sayyaf group on the southern island of Jolo, which is a stronghold of the kidnap-for-ransom gang that has been behind some of the worst attacks in the Philippines.</p>
      <p>"There was a brief exchange of fire, but they later abandoned the couple after being overwhelmed by pursuing government forces," Lieutenant General Cirilito Sobejana told AFP, adding the hostages were unharmed.</p>
      <p>Regional army spokesman Arvin Encinas said no ransom was paid.</p>

      <p>Pictures released by the armed forces showed Mr Hyrons and his wife talking with troops after the rescue mission.</p>
      <p>Foreign Secretary praised the "tremendous efforts" of officials in the Philippines.</p>
      <p> "I am pleased to confirm that both Alan and Wilma Hyrons are safe and well, and being looked after by the Philippine authorities," he said.</p>
      <p>"We worked closely with the Government of the Philippines on Alan and Wilma's case over the last two months. I am very grateful for their tremendous efforts.</p>
      <p>"We are in particular grateful to their Armed Forces for their courage throughout a difficult operation which resulted in Alan and Wilma's release.</p>
      <p>"Foreign Office officials have been in close contact with Alan and Wilma's family throughout this ordeal. We request their privacy during this emotional time."</p>
      <p>The British embassy in Manila confirmed the rescue of Alan and Wilma Hyrons, saying in a statement "we extend our gratitude to the government and authorities of the Philippines".</p>
      <p>Armed men abducted the couple on October 4 at their beach resort on the southern island of Mindanao, which makes up the southern third of the Philippines.</p>
      <p>Witnesses reported seeing them being taken from a hut at nightfall and dragged to a motorboat.</p>
      <p>Their abduction sparked a massive search in the region, which is located approximately 1,500 kilometres (932 miles) south of Manila.</p>
      <p>British Ambassador to the Philippines, Daniel Pruce, tweeted: "Fantastic news! My sincerest thanks to all involved."</p>
      <p>Muslim separatists have led a decades-long insurgency in the south of the Catholic-majority Philippines, which has led to the death of tens of thousands of people.</p>
      <p>While the government has negotiated peace with the largest group, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, hardline factions allied with the Islamic State group are not part of the accord.</p>
      <p>IS claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing of a Sunday mass in January at a Catholic cathedral on Jolo which killed 21 in the country's worst attack in years.</p>
      <p>Authorities blamed the bombing on Abu Sayyaf, which in part funds its violence with ransom payments.</p>
      <p>Dutch birdwatcher Ewold Horn, who was kidnapped in 2012 in the southern Philippines, was killed in May during a firefight between his Abu Sayyaf captors and the military.</p>
