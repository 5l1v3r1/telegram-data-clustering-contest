      <p>A model railway exhibition that was destroyed by vandals earlier this year has now been rebuilt thanks to more than £107,000 in donations.</p>
      <p>Members of The Market Deeping Model Railway Club had been left in tears after four teenagers trashed the display as part of a ‘pre-exam night out’ earlier this year.</p>
      <p>Exhibits which had taken as long as 25 years to make were thrown against walls, smashed and stamped on, including a locomotive unit worth about £8,500.</p>
      <p>It has now taken 30 members of the club around 1,000 hours to restore their displays, remaking everything by hand.</p>
      <p>The sets are now on display at the Warley Show, at the Birmingham NEC, after a fundraising page was backed by singer Sir Rod Stewart.</p>

      <p>Sir Rod donated £10,000 towards the club, telling them he ‘felt their pain’ after taking <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/13/rod-stewart-unveils-epic-model-railway-26-years-11091484/">23 years to build his his own model railway</a>.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>Altogether, the page raised more than £107,000 from 5,500 people across the world.</p>
      <p>Club chairman Peter Davies, 70, described Sir Rod’s donation as ‘absolutely amazing’, adding that he was pleased to see the club up and running once more.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘We could have just easily walked away. That’s not the thing to do, we’re a club, we work together and it’s been satisfying getting it back again.’</p>
      <p>Mr Davies previously described how the teenagers had caused ‘total devastation and destruction’ by wrecking the exhibition.</p>

      <p>Three 16-year-old boys and one 15-year-old boy had broken into Welland Academy in Stamford, Lincolnshire at around 3.50am on May 18.</p>
      <p>They then shared a bottle of vodka, before going on a ‘rampage’, overturning tables and throwing models across the room.</p>
      <p>The boys were later found hiding in the toilets after setting off an alarm.</p>
      <p>In August, they all admitted criminal damage at Lincoln Youth Court, and three of them were handed 12-month referral orders.</p>
      <p>Their parents were also ordered to pay £500 in compensation.</p>

      <p>At the time Mr Davies, a grandfather-of-five, said: ‘We are devastated and distraught. It’s heartbreaking.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘There were grown men there in tears because of what had been done, and I admit I was one of them.</p>
      <p>‘Can you imagine your life’s work wrecked? One guy spent 25 years on his and it’s wrecked, it’s just horrendous. They left it like a bomb site.</p>
      <p>‘There were many different models of locomotives across the hall that were smashed, trodden and kicked about.’</p>
      <p>The club have now made a Sir Rod an honorary member and he has his own t-shirt waiting for him to pick up.</p>
      <p>The Warley National Model Railway Exhibition, open on Saturday and Sunday, includes 90 model railway layouts and a full-size locomotive display.</p>
