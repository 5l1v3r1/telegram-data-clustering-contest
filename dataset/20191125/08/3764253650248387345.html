      <p>The first period of this encounter ended 2-2 but Oman led 2-1 after the end of the second period before sealing the victory with a 2-2 scoreline after the third period.</p>

      <p>And while speaking after Nigeria's defeat against Oman, Nigerian striker Victor Tale explained that luck worked against them in this championship.</p>
      <p>
        <i>''At times when something happen, we just have to sit down and look at what is happening. It’s just like the luck is not there.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>''It’s not about the training, it’s just like something left us. The trust, the hope, the believe and everything.</i>
      </p>
      <p><i>''The confidence everything just went off even when we are still trying to but everything is just not coming,''</i> Victor Tale told Brila.</p>
