        <b>Commonwealth Bank of Australia is installing lockers at several Sydney branches where customers can pick up their Amazon parcels.</b>
      </p>
      <p>With customer branch visits on the decline thanks to the rise of digital channels, banks are looking for new ways to utilise their expensive real estate.<br/><br/>Following in the footsteps of Barclays in the UK and BBVA Compass in the US, CBA has decided to team up with Amazon to test out a click and collect service.<br/><br/>When online shopping, customers can choose to have their parcels shipped to an Amazon Locker at a CBA branch. Once their package is ready for pick up, they will receive an email along with a barcode to use to pick it up, 24/7.<br/><br/>Angus Sullivan, CBA, says: "In the lead up to Black Friday, Cyber Monday and Christmas trade, we know many of our customers are jumping online to do their shopping. Our latest Retail Insights Report shows consumers want more control over their deliveries, with 67% of customers rating choice as an important factor, while 49% felt fast and flexible delivery times were essential.<br/><br/>"We have the largest branch network in Australia and weâ€™re thrilled to work with Amazon to deliver innovative technology-led solutions to our customers that help make their lives easier."</p>
