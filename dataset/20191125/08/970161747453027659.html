      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/billie-eilish/">Billie Eilish</a> is one in a million and a new breed of superstar, as the singer emotionally accepted her American Music Award gongs on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Gongs, plural.</p>
      <p>The 17-year-old was named new artist of the year at the annual event, beating the likes of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/lizzo/">Lizzo</a>, Luke Combs, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/lil-nas-x/">Lil Nas X</a> and Ella Mai to the top spot. She then went on to take home the favourite artist – alternative rock award.</p>
      <p>Not like she didn’t realise the monumental feat she’d just achieved though, as she took to the stage to thank her fans and admitted she was ‘shaking’.</p>
      <p>She said of her alternative rock plaudit: ‘I feel like I can’t say more to the fans and supporters, because, like, you made it all happen, man. I can’t believe I’m, like, standing in front of, oh, my god, I’m, like, shaking. Sorry.</p>

      <p>‘To be in this category is insane to me. I grew up being in love with all of you, everybody in that row, everyone in that row, in this room.</p>

      <p>‘The fact that you’re looking at me right now, I can’t believe this. Thank you to the fans. Thank you, guys. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Thank you, I love you.’</p>
      <p>She beat Imagine Dragons and Panic! At The Disco for that one.</p>
      <p>As she headed to the stage for another award, she said: ‘I’ve tried to pull myself together for this one.</p>

      <p>‘I want to thank the AMAs for even thinking of me in the slightest. Thank you to my creative team, thank you for letting me do whatever I want, pretty much all the time. Thanks to the fans, because that’s the only reason I’m even alive.’</p>
      <p>As she stood on stage, Billie – who performed her hit All The Good Girls Go To Hell on a fire-laden platform – heaped praise on her brother and producer, Finneas O’Connell, hailing him her ‘best friend’, and went on to pay tribute to her fellow nominees.</p>
      <p>‘Thank you guys so much, I love you, I’ve grown up watching you all. I love you, I love you, thank you,’ she chimed.</p>
      <p>Making her musical debut at the ceremony, with her pyrotechnic-filled performance, Billie was introduced by Tyler, the Creator.</p>

      <p>The rapper joked: ‘Waddup, earlier this year my album IGOR was #1 in the country and then a 17-year-old girl who dressed like a quarterback decided to change that.</p>
      <p>‘Everybody please give it up for Billie Eilish.’</p>
