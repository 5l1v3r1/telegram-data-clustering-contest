        <i>Reliance is firing on all cylinders. It has spent about $60 billion in capital expenditure across sectors and all that capex is now beginning to result in significant revenue and profit growth, says <b><a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Jal-Irani">Jal Irani</a></b>, Senior V-P- wholesale capital <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/definition/markets">markets</a>, <b><a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/edelweiss-financial-services-ltd/stocks/companyid-19100.cms">Edelweiss Financial Services</a></b>. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.</i>
      </p>
      <p><b>The telecom sector has been on a subscriber gaining spree in September. Reliance has been looking at creating the largest digital service platform company. What is your outlook in terms of target for RIL as it is knocking on the Rs 10 lakh crore market cap as well?<br/></b>There are two things that I would like to highlight in the telecom space. We have seen a very significant consolidation taking place in the industry. We have seen Reliance gaining a very significant market share with nearly 360 million subscribers.Reliance and the industry is in a position to capitalise on operational leverage. This is when you start to see tariff increases which then adds exponentially to bottom line.</p>
      <p>The second thing is that I do not believe that Reliance has completed its process of acquiring market share and at the feature phone level, this is a process which is poised to get a significant impetus because the Jio phone has cut prices at the entry level very significantly. That allows it to capture those feature phone customers and then upgrade to the smartphone level. This business is poised at a very strong position and Reliance is now in the process of capitalising on it.</p>
      <p><b>We are just points away from the Rs 10-lakh crore market cap. What is your 12-month price target on Reliance?<br/></b>Our target price is over Rs 1,700. Think beyond telecom. Reliance is firing on all cylinders. It has spent about $60 billion in capital expenditure across sectors and all that capital expenditure is now beginning to result in significant revenue and profit growth.</p>
      <p>For all practical purposes, with the current capex spend largely done, that itself is going to drive earnings growth by 12% to 15% over the next five years. That means roughly a doubling in earnings and this is going to be the case across the board. Even in the refinery business, a petcoke gasifier, which is a $6-billion project, is going to be announced as commercial production by either this December quarter end or March quarter end.</p>
      <p>Similarly, it starts $6 billion production from the upstream oil and gas sector by the middle of next calendar year. Each of these two projects would add about Rs 10,000-14,000 crore per annum. It is not just telecom, it is bread and butter traditional businesses which are going to materially add to profitability.</p>
      <p><b>Valuations have expanded. What would you attribute it to primarily?<br/></b>Obviously, there is an earnings growth, but there has been a lot of risk mitigation and that is driving valuations ahead of earnings growth being assured. Let me give you an example. We had the same conversation about two and a half years back. The question everybody used to ask is will the VoLTE technology work? Do they have enough infrastructure? How will they get customers? At that stage, we were giving a 30-50% discount on invested capital.</p>
      <blockquote>Personally, I would be happy if Reliance retains some debt on the balance sheet rather than goes on to be a zero-debt company.<br/>-Jal Irani</blockquote>
      <p>Everybody was giving a huge risk weightage to projects and this is the most extreme. Now the fact of the matter is, it has got its customers and it has also got its technology fully in place. Those are not questions and as a result, you are getting a valuation rerating ahead of significant earnings growth.</p>
      <p><b>We are still watching out for the possible stake sales in the various businesses. The kind of risk you see on this front, the market seems to have already priced in to a large extent. What could be expected with regards to asset monetisation? , how are you seeing this play out?<br/></b>In 2005-06, in roughly similar circumstances, the stock had rallied about 40% under a similar restructuring perspective. We are yet to see that sort of a rally currently. Secondly, the magnitude of the restructuring is very significant and across the board and in this case the restructuring is not just about stake sale and monetising the true value of assets and therefore trigger, but also a very material debt reduction.</p>
      <p>In the current environment, unlike 2005-06, debt is a four letter bad word. That is simultaneously resulting in risk decreasing. Our analysis shows that we are on target to have debt going to zero within a couple of years. I am of the view that some amount of debt is beneficial to all companies because the cost of debt capital is low and of course, if you have got a modest amount of debt, then that reduces your weighted cost of capital and enhances your equity value.</p>
      <p>Personally, I would be happy if Reliance retains some debt on the balance sheet rather than goes on to be a zero-debt company.</p>
      <p><b>Is the BPCL divestment the best in terms of a stock price move? We at <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/ET-Now">ET Now</a> are picking up that BPCL is going to monetise its holdings in <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/indraprastha-gas-ltd/stocks/companyid-751.cms">IGL</a>, <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/petronet-lng-ltd/stocks/companyid-4495.cms">Petronet LNG</a> before the government exits the PSU major? <br/></b>The divestment as a whole is a good thing. Global majors on an average, quote at about 7.5 times EV to EBITDA. The BPCL score business is at about 5 or 5.5 times EV to EBITDA. There is a potential value trigger if the divestment happens. Now, the government is spinning out investment in IGL etc. I have also read that from the press and my thought is it is a good thing because firstly a potential buyer who wants to buy into refining and fuel retailing asset does not necessarily want to buy into an energy conglomerate. Therefore to that extent, it makes it easier to attract buyers.</p>
      <p>Second, under the current circumstances, the ticket size could be a very large $9-$10 billion in addition to that a potential open offer. Then the ticket size becomes extremely large and by reducing these bits and pieces by $2-$3 billion here and there, it makes the ticket size more affordable. I would think that this is the right way of doing it.</p>
