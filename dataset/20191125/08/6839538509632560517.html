      <p>A Sydney father is warning other parents about the dangers of dodgy ‘henna tattoos’ overseas, after his daughter’s leg became severely infected following an application in Bali.</p>
      <p>Daniel Worley-Nunn says his family will be lucky if the infection doesn’t leave his daughter Amelia with a scar, after the 11-year-old got what they thought was a ‘henna tattoo’ done on holiday in Bali in October.</p>
      <p>Traditional henna involves dye prepared from a plant applied to skin in intricate patterns. As a form of body art, ‘henna tattoos’ do not involve penetrating the skin and are only meant to temporarily stain the body for anywhere between 12 days to around two months.</p>
      <p>While henna dye is usually reddish-brown in colour, made from a mixture of powder derived from the Hina tree and a combination of liquids (including water, lemon juice and tea), overseas travellers are known to be exposed to black henna.</p>

      <p>The black appearance of the dye is a result of a mixture containing paraphenylenediamine (PPD) - a toxic substance used in black hair dye - that the Western Australian Department of Health warn is illegal in Australia, but likely to be available overseas.</p>
      <p>The Department of Health warn PPD can cause permanent scarring, oozing blisters, sensitisation dermatitis and nausea.</p>
      <p>Balinese henna artists have also been known to mix powder with unsafe ingredients like dirty water and chemicals to make henna dye, which poses the risk of severe infections when it’s applied to the skin.</p>
      <p>Mr Worley-Nunn told The Daily Mail Australia his daughter Amelia’s ‘tattoo’ was “very dark black”, unlike henna she had received in the past.</p>

      <p>“Please don’t let your kids get them done,” Mr Worley-Nunn wrote in a Facebook post, sharing graphic photos of his daughter’s infected leg to warn other travellers.</p>
      <p>The post prompted other Australians to share their experiences with the practice, with one woman stating it took 12 months for her niece’s skin to heal following an application.</p>
      <p>Others said it is common knowledge that getting ‘henna tattoos’ done overseas were risky and warnings about ‘fake’ henna often circulated in Australia, to which Mr Worley-Nunn replied: “In all the times I’ve been to Bali, I’ve never heard anything.”</p>
      <p>“Definitely won’t be happening again,” he said.</p>
