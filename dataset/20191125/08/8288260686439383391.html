      <h1>Cat shot in head by thug 'hanging out of the window'</h1>
      <h2>Herbie was partially blinded - leaving his owners with a massive vets' bill (Warning: Graphic content)</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T08:30:14+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 08:30</time> by <a rel="author">Jordan Coussins, https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/authors/jordan-coussins/</a></address>
      <p>A much-loved cat lost an eye when it was shot in the head by a cruel thug – leaving his devastated owners with a vets' bill for nearly £1,000.</p>
      <p>Herbie was partially blinded after the pellet became lodged millimetres from his brain in the wicked attack close to Abbey Square, Walsall, on Friday, November 21.</p>
      <p>Emily Benton said medics were unable to remove the shot.</p>
      <p>She told Black Country Live: “My mother heard him meowing and leaned down to fuss him.</p>
      <p>"She saw a trickle of blood down his nose and went to clean him up after thinking he had scratched himself. But when she saw him properly, she screamed and practically sobbed.</p>
      <p>“His left eye was protruding from his face, dilating, it wasn't following any movement with the other eye, and as more time passed, it seemed to swell, and hang out of his face more. We instantly knew someone had done this deliberately.”</p>
      <p>Emily said she believed the culprit must have ‘hung out of a top floor window’ and ‘aimed to kill’ the cat.</p>
      <p>A £700 fundraising bid, more than doubled its target, with £1,500 pledged on Monday morning, November 25.</p>
      <p>Emily said: “We knew straight away that we were paying it, there is no way we couldn't save out poor boy, but that was all the money that was left for Christmas.</p>
      <p>“So I'm asking this, could you PLEASE spare anything as little as £1 to help towards Herbie's vet bill? We will be ever so grateful for any help our Herbie will receive! He did not deserve this, nor will any other animal in the world.  Please share this to let everyone know that there are evil people like this in the world! This little man hasn't got a voice, so we will speak for him!”</p>
