      <p>It is unusual for the teen not to be in contact with her family - who are extremely concerned for her safety.</p>
      <p>As she left her home in the Kirkwood area of the Lanarkshire town around 4.30pm, she said she was going for a run and did not imply she would be out overnight.</p>
      <p>Her devastated mum, Lynne, shared a photo of her daughter on Facebook, saying she was "going out of [her] mind with worry."</p>
      <p>Lynne added that there had been sighting of Bobbi in Baillieston, Glasgow, around 10pm.</p>
      <p>She is described as white, with pale skin and freckles, 5ft3in tall, of medium build with long, mousy brown hair and glasses.</p>
      <p>When she vanished, she was wearing black sports leggings, a bright orange hoody and a red waterproof jacket.</p>
      <p>Cops have been in touch with her family and launched a bid to trace her - and have urged anyone with any information or who may have seen her to come forward.</p>
      <p>Inspector Gail Struthers from Motherwell Police Office, said today: "Bobbi is thought to have left her home address around half past four on the afternoon of Sunday 24th November 2019 in the Kirkwood area of Coatbridge.</p>
      <p>“We have been speaking to her family who say that her being out of touch for this time is not like her, hence the cause for their concern. We all just want to know that Bobbi is safe and well.</p>
      <p>“It is hoped that someone will have observed Bobbi in the area.</p>
      <p>“I would appeal to anyone who knows Bobbi, or who may have seen her since Sunday afternoon, to call officers at Coatbridge via 101, quoting incident number 3957 of 24 November."</p>
