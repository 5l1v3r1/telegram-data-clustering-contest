      <h1>Arsenal: Are we really making managerial suggestions based on banter?</h1>
      <h2>Arsenal fans are oddly warming up to the idea of Mauricio Pochettino replacing Unai Emery, but apart from the banter, how is this a good idea?</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T08:00:26+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 08:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://paininthearsenal.com/author/joshsippie/" target="_blank">Josh Sippie</a></address>
      <p>Okay, so <a href="https://paininthearsenal.com/category/arsenal-news/">Arsenal</a> did the somewhat unthinkable and didn’t manage to beat Southampton at the Emirates, after an international break that many fans and players alike were hoping would rejuvenate the club a bit. Meanwhile, Jose Mourinho guided Spurs to a win over West Ham in his Spurs debut, so Gooners are out here wondering—<a href="https://fbref.com/en/players/92c5faee/Mauricio-Pochettino?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-">Mauricio Pochettino</a>?</p>
      <p>If you haven’t caught on to my opinion yet, it’s a big, hearty “no.” Not even “no thank you,” just a whopping “no.” Absolutely positively not, if you need more than just “no.”</p>
      <p>To this point, the only argument I’ve heard in his favor is that it would be good for the banter. Teehee, yes it would be. How fun. But when has it ever been a good idea to make a managerial decision based on the banter?</p>
      <p>Pochettino had five years to play with at Spurs and he plateaued at second place. He proved he doesn’t have what it takes to push his team into trophies, seeing as how he has yet to ever win a trophy, and that should be enough of a deal breaker right there.</p>
      <p>What is our biggest complaint as fans? It isn’t getting into a Champions League place. We did that for how long under Wenger? The problem is trophies. Even if Unai Emery gets us into the top four, fans won’t be satisfied. I guarantee you of that. They are going to ask for more and if Emery can’t do it, if Emery plateaus at second place, he won’t be good enough.</p>
      <p>So then why is Pochettino good enough? He’s not. This is just another friendly neighborhood snap decision that desperate fans are turning to in an attempt to find salvation.</p>
      <p>I’m not going to argue that Emery shouldn’t be fired. I <i>will</i> argue that he should be fired for Pochettino though. <a href="https://fbref.com/en/players/d934d1e6/Mikel-Arteta?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-">Mikel Arteta</a>? Could be fun. Max Allegri? Yes please. Julian Nagelsmann? Absolutely. They have either won things or they have bonafide experience to believe that wins will be in their near future.</p>
      <p>Pochettino doesn’t have that.</p>
      <p>Sure, it’d be hilarious if we win the league under him. But the prerequisite to the hilarity is actually winning the league and he has yet to show any signs that he could manage that.</p>
