      <p>VAN NUYS, LOS ANGELES (KABC) -- Fire crews responded to a blaze that broke out in a vacant five-story commercial building in Van Nuys Sunday afternoon.<br/><br/>Sepulveda Boulevard was shut down between Vose Street and Sherman Way.<br/><br/>The fire broke out at 4:35 p.m. in the 7100 block of N. Sepulveda Boulevard. Over 120 firefighters from the Los Angeles Fire Department were assigned to battle the blaze.<br/><br/>LAFD requested assistance from police to help move a group of homeless people that were adjacent to the building to prevent them from being injured by falling debris.<br/><br/>Smoke from the fire could be seen across the San Fernando Valley. No injuries were reported.<br/><br/>Firefighters said it was immediately clear the blaze was suspicious.<br/><br/>"We have a five-story building with heavy fire and smoke on all five floors, not a normal occurrence, especially in broad daylight, busy day like this," LAFD Asst. Chief Patrick Butler said.<br/><br/>Firefighters continued battling the blaze late into the night to extinguish hot spots inside the building.<br/><br/>Investigators are piecing together what sparked the blaze.</p>
