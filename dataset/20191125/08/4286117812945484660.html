      <h4>HIGHLIGHTS</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Who is missing, tell me, will take you to them: Scindia</li>
        <li>Jyotiraditya Scindia is seen a rival to MP CM Kamal Nath</li>
        <li>Scindia lost from his Guna seat in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Madhya Pradesh Congress leader Jyotiraditya Scinida rubbished rumours of some Congress MLAs being "missing" or "untraceable" in the state. "This [the rumour] is utter rubbish. Who is missing, tell me the name, I will make you talk to him or her," Scindia told India Today TV when asked about the reports.</p>
      <p>Scindia's statement came after speculation spread that certain Madhya Pradesh Congress MLAs had gone missing in the state. The MLAs in question were apparently those close to Scindia.</p>
      <p>It all began with a tweet from the lucknow resident editor of a national Hindi daily who wrote on Twitter, "Breaking news: 20 Congress MLAs of Madhya Pradesh close to Jyotiraditya Scindia missing and unreachable since two days, chaos inside Congress party"</p>
      <p>This tweet was deleted within an hour but not before sending almost everyone in the state Congress into a tizzy.</p>
      <p>The opposition BJP was quick to jump on to the controversy that was not to be. "Scindia and his loyalists are not happy the functioning of the Kamal Nath government and their anger can go to the level of difiance at any stage," party spokesman Dr Hitesh Vajpayee said while reacting to the 'news' of Scindia supporters going missing.</p>
      <p>Earlier, a <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/jyotiraditya-scindia-removes-congress-identity-becomes-public-servant-cricket-lover-twitter-1622343-2019-11-25">purported change in Jyotiraditya Scinida's Twitter bio</a> raised eyebrows with many wondering what was happening in Madhya Pradesh's politics.</p>
      <p>However, Scindia had a clarification for this Twitter bio change as well. "I don't know why this being pulled out now. I had changed it [the Twitter bio] almost a month back. That too because I was getting constant feedback that it was very long," Scindia said in response to reports of him changing the bio from 'Former Member of Parliament, Guna (2002-2019) | Former Minister for Power (I/C); MoS Commer &amp; Industry; MoS Communications, IT &amp; Post' to 'Public servant, cricket enthusiast'.</p>
      <p>Madhya Pradesh is currently ruled by the Congress with Kamal Nath as chief minister. In Madhya Pradesh's politics, Jyotiraditya Scindia is seen as a rival to Kamal Nath. What also sets the two apart is Scindia being close to former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi while Kamal Nath being part of the Congress 'old guard' whose influence in the party Rahul Gandhi had attempted reducing.</p>
      <p>Jyotiraditya Scindia, the nephew of the BJP's Vasundhara Raje, contested the 2019 Lok Sabha from his stronghold of Guna. However, he lost to the BJP's Krishna Pal Singh Yadav, a shock defeat in a constituency that he had represented since 2002.</p>
