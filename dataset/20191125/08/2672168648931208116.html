      <p>Myanmar Geosciences Society is going to implement the conservation of Papa Mount and its environs to be a new site for Global GeoPark of UNESCO, said Chairman Than Tun of Myanmar Geosciences Society.<br/>The aim of Global GeoPark is that local people should value and conserve geo-diversity and geological heritages. We have formed a team to implementation of conservation of Mount Papa and its environs to be a new site for Global GeoPark of UNESCO. It was formed with scholars and professors of the university. We have started work with our own expenses, said Than Tun.<br/>Mount Papa experienced landslides in 2018. There is growing concern about further possible landslides. Main currents get blocked. Constructions cause deterioration in original geological diversities. There is still concern that possible landslide would occur, said Sayadaw U Yuzana, patron of Mount Popa Lovers Association.<br/>“Mount Popa is back to greening. New trees have been planted on the mountain and they have become into young ones. If we conserve the trees with united efforts and carry out reforestation, Popa Mount will be back to being lush and green, said Sayadaw U Yuzana.<br/>We hope Mount Popa to be a new site for Global GeoPark of UNESCO, but we have to do many of researches. Geological heritages such as cultures and natures of plants and animals will have to be observed, said Thant Zaw Oo, Director of Archaeology, National Museum and Library.<br/>Mount Popa is situated Kyaukpadaung Township, Mandalay Region and there are green forests on Mount Popa and its environs. There are more than 200 springs and streams. Moreover, there are about 350 herbal plant species. There are about 40 orchid species, 70 bird species and more than 30 foreign bird species. It has an area of 31,763 acres and home to 295 wildlife species including macaque monkey.     </p>
