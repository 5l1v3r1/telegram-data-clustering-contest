      <h1>‘Vibrant’ town centre planned around Eglinton station</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T08:42:35+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 08:42</time> by <a rel="author">Lucy Jarvis</a></address>
      <p>THE town centre around Eglinton station is set to include shops, businesses, high density housing and a private school.</p>
      <p>An activity centre plan, tabled at the November Wanneroo Council meeting, outlined the vision for the development site beside Pipidinny Road.</p>
      <p>Urbis submitted the plan on behalf of landowner Eglinton Estates to fast track development of the town centre so it could accommodate the train station.</p>
      <p>The station, bus interchange and parking will be built as part of the <a href="https://www.communitynews.com.au/wanneroo-times/news/yanchep-rail-extension-clears-milestones-with-green-bridges-for-epa-approval/">Yanchep rail extension</a>, with the first train services expected to run in 2022.</p>
      <p>Wanneroo Council recommended the WA Planning Commission approve the plan subject to modifications after raising concerns there would not be enough residential development within a 400m walking distance of the station.</p>
      <p>The City also said the school should not be located within that walkable catchment area.</p>

      <p>The plan proposed having 27,000sq m of retail floor space and 243 to 365 dwellings in the town centre, with a pedestrian-focused main street.</p>
      <p>It said the vision for the town centre was a “coastal urban community which is convenient, connected and provides diversity in both people and housing choices”.</p>
      <p>“The Eglinton train station facilitates a central core of activity that will flow through to a vibrant high street and shopping centre catering for a variety of needs,” the plan said.</p>
      <p>“It is the largest and most vibrant in Eglinton and the main focus of community life during day time and extending into the evening.”</p>
      <p>It said there would be parks, plazas and other meeting spaces in the town centre, as well as amenities.</p>
      <p>According to the council report, the school would be built in two stages with the primary school facilities expected to be developed by 2030.</p>
