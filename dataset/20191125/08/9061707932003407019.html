      <h1>Stapleford Park country house hotel: you'll struggle to find a finer place to stay</h1>
      <h2>How could anyone resist what awaits at this faultless country house hotel?</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T08:43:09+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 08:43</time> by <a rel="author">Julie Bayley</a></address>
      <p>There's a wishing well set in the grounds of <a href="https://www.staplefordpark.com/">Stapleford Park.</a></p>
      <p>And after having spent a couple of days here I'm certain the number one wish from guests is, quite simply, to return as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>The reason? This is a very special country house hotel.</p>
      <p>A colleague of mine married here recently. Not knowing Leicestershire too well, the pride in her eyes as she revealed her choice of venue was lost on me.</p>
      <p>Now I get it.</p>
      <p>This is a place that wedding dreams are made of. And the place to spend the most memorable of weekends.</p>
      <p>Stapleford Park is a fine example of a fine country house but without an ounce of stuffiness.</p>
      <p>A classy glow permeates every room and it is resolutely old-fashioned, in a good way.</p>

      <p>But you only have to check out the row of muddy, upturned wellies in reception to realise making guests feel right at home - amid all the splendour - is paramount.</p>
      <p>Even your pet dog will be welcomed with open arms.</p>
      <p>The hotel is just four miles from Melton Mowbray (an hour from Derby) and set in 500 acres of spectacular grounds designed by Capability Brown, of Chatsworth House fame.</p>
      <p>This is a hotel with history - its inception dates back to Norman Times. It boasts what are considered to be some of the finest Jacobean features in Leicestershire.</p>
      <p>The estate has 13 listed features including the 19th century thatched North Lodge and the Victorian stables.</p>
      <p>You won't be surprised to discover the sporting estate has a rich hunting heritage.</p>
      <p>If you plan to stay over, there are rooms to suit all budgets from state rooms, grand rooms, house rooms, manor rooms and even cottages.</p>
      <p>For unparalleled decadence go for a suite where you'll find original fireplaces and four-poster beds. There are swags and tails in abundance and opulence comes as standard whichever you choose.</p>

      <p>Each individually designed bedroom has unlimited wifi, a decanter of moreish sloe gin - what a great touch - coffee and tea making facilities and Noble Isle toiletries.</p>
      <p>Our stunning suite was a study in interior design perfection. Honeymooners often choose it. The Hypnos beds and good linen guarantee a great night's sleep.</p>
      <p>The room price includes full access to many facilities including the swimming pool, sauna, Jacuzzi, steam room, gymnasium and tennis courts.</p>
      <p>A dog-loving couple we got chatting to in the Jacuzzi were regulars, drawn back to the hotel again and again by the fact they could bring their beloved four-legged family member to "a place of such quality".</p>
      <p>You can also have family fun playing croquet, pétanque, miniature golf and giant chess.</p>
      <p>Many rooms enjoy soothing views over the countryside or golf course.</p>
      <p>The golf course, incidentally, is championship standard. It's been voted one of National Club Golfer's most favourite courses in the East Midlands. And Justin Rose is among its fans. He said: "It's the whole set up here that attracted me to Stapleford Park I can't think of anywhere more relaxing to come, to get away from the pressures of everyday life on the tour.”</p>
      <p>If you love the great outdoors but golf's not your thing then Stapleford Park excels in countryside pursuits (hence the wellies in reception).</p>
      <p>You can try your hand at archery, clay pigeon shooting and even falconry.</p>
      <p>If you do venture out by car there's plenty to do on the doorstop including the rural delights of Rutland water and Twin Lakes theme park, which is perfect for younger families and only five miles away. A little further afield is Langar's Go Karting and Quad Biking Centre.</p>
      <p>However, it's highly possible you'll not want to leave the estate.</p>
      <p>There are simple pleasures to be enjoyed at every turn. Hire a bike and whizz around the stunning grounds or hunker down on a comfy sofa beside a roaring log fire, warming your cockles while admiring the endless artwork and impeccably decorated state rooms with their sumptuous fabrics and furnishings.</p>
      <p>Afternoon tea is a delight. It's taken, naturally, in the drawing room. In fact you can visit the hotel for this experience without being an overnight guest. Be warned, the pastry chef is a generous type and waste lines will be stretched!</p>

      <p>The spa, which has been carefully converted from the original stable block, sits alongside a state-of-the-art gym. Treatments here are popular and Karina delivered a wonderful back massage to background sounds of birdsong and gently lapping water.</p>
      <p>The massage bed was heated - and it's these thoughtful little luxuries that make your time here memorable.</p>
      <p>Dining in Stapleford's 2 AA Rosette Grinling Gibbons restaurant is first class. Expect exceptional food.</p>
      <p>The chef has a lightness of touch we've seldom experienced, particularly evident in a fabulous mackerel starter (served with chicory, tarragon, raisin and horseradish).</p>

      <p>It's the sort of place you'd want to eat your Last Supper, with every dish a culinary work of art and served on candlelit tables under sparkling crystal chandeliers and an ornate ceiling.</p>
      <p>Our other starter - squab pigeon with pancetta and sweetcorn pearl barley - was faultless and our mains of Hereford beef fillet and loin of venison were perfectly excuted.</p>

      <p>But I've saved the best until last.</p>
      <p>All the splendour in the world, the finest food, those little luxuries are nothing without good staff to bring them to life.</p>
      <p>And Stapleford Park's staff are its best asset. We have never felt so welcomed. Attentive but unobtrusive, they made our stay what it was: unforgettably good.</p>
      <p>And I'm hopeful of getting my wishing well wish of a return visit, sooner rather than later...</p>

      <p>Of the 1170+ reviews on TripAdvisor, almost 900 of them class Stapleford Park at either excellent or good.</p>
      <p>"The hotel is in a beautiful, picturesque location surrounded by beautiful scenery. We were very warmly welcomed &amp; shown to our room which was delightful and spacious. Once we had unpacked we headed to the pool area and enjoyed using the warm pool, sauna, steam room and jacuzzi. We then walked to the leisure building for our full body massages; wow! Amazing treatment. Pre-dinner drinks by the fire in the drawing room were enjoyed before a delicious three course dinner."</p>
      <p>"Fantastic! Beautiful house, warm and courteous staff. Lovely elegant but warm feeling! The food is gorgeous and well presented! The rooms are of a high standard in a traditional style in keeping with the overall historic feel of the house. Fantastic service. Loved it."</p>
      <p>"Our first time here for afternoon tea, and will definitely return. Helpful, polite staff, good service, beautiful surroundings, comfortable &amp; well-maintained with a nice relaxing atmosphere. The afternoon tea was very good. Generous fillings on lovely soft bread, with the offer of extra sandwiches if we wanted, and delicious cakes &amp; scones. A very enjoyable afternoon!"</p>
      <p>"My husband booked this hotel for our wedding anniversary and it was just fabulous. The place is stunning inside and out and I adored the attention to detail in the decor. The staff were fabulous and nothing was too much effort. I had a great experience at the spa in the afternoon and the meal was of a very high standard. The card and gift left in our room to mark our anniversary was a very unexpected wonderful surprise. We will definitely be going back."</p>
