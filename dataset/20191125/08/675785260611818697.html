      <h2>England cricket star Jofra Archer claims he suffered racist abuse while batting during the defeat to New Zealand on the fifth day of the first Test</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T08:09:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 08:09</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Maltby, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matt-maltby/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jofra-archer">Jofra Archer</a> has claimed that he was racially abused by spectators during England's Test against New Zealand.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/cricket/england-lose-first-test-innings-20953956">England were crushed by New Zealand as the tourists lost the first Test by an innings and 65 runs</a> at the Bay Oval in Mount Maunganui, Tauranga.</p>
      <p>The game, however, was overshadowed after Archer alleged that he was the subject of racial abuse while batting for England.</p>
      <p>He wrote on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a>: A bit disturbing hearing racial insults today while battling to help save my team.</p>
      <p>"The crowd has been amazing this week except for that one guy. The Barmy Army was good as usual also."</p>

      <p>Neil Wagner's five for 44 included two wickets in as many balls to bring an abrupt conclusion to proceedings as the Black Caps took a 1-0 lead in the two-Test series, but a number of England batsmen were culpable for their own downfall.</p>
      <p>There was some brief resistance from Sam Curran (29no) and Jofra Archer (30), both of whom rode their luck in a 59-run stand that was England's highest of the second innings.</p>
      <p>But Archer strangely hooked to deep backward square-leg off Wagner, whose low full toss trapped Stuart Broad plumb in front, leaving the Kiwis buoyant.</p>
