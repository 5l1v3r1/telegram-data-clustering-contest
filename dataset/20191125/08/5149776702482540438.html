      <p>Loved ones of a popular rugby player who died after a short battle with cancer have spoken of how they are keeping his memory alive.</p>
      <p>Ben Hallam had been club captain at Nottingham Casuals, where he was one of the top try scorers, and was known among teammates as "The Beeston Bullet".</p>
      <p>Ben grew up up in Attenborough and returned to the area to live permanently after studying away at university.</p>
      <p>The Rolls-Royce worker was diagnosed with cancer in Spring 2018 but died just a few months later. He was 41.</p>
      <p>Club chairman Oli Mott, 40, said: "It just happened really, really quick.</p>
      <p>"We wanted some way to keep his memory alive, so we renamed an award after him.</p>
      <p>"The Ben Hallam Clubman of the Year award will be given annually to anyone who helps throughout the year.</p>
      <p>"It's perfect for Ben as he did so much for the club.</p>
      <p>"We considered retiring his number 15 shirt as he played in the full back position. But instead, it will now carry his name as a lasting tribute to him."</p>

        <figcaption>Ben Hallam was described as "very loyal and a great uncle".</figcaption>

      <p>Oli described Ben as "naturally quiet but still very social".</p>
      <p>"He did some really good work for the Casuals especially as club captain. He had a friendly face and was easy to approach," he said.</p>
      <p>"He was a great guy and a very good friend."</p>
      <p>Speaking about the funeral and the wake that followed back at the club, Oli said people were all "sharing stories about Ben".</p>
      <p>He said: "It ended up inspiring an event because it ended up being such an enjoyable day."</p>
      <p>On the anniversary of Ben's death, July 13, 2019, Ben's family and friends held the first ever Hallam Fest, combining his three loves of rugby, rock music and fancy dress.</p>
      <p>Oli added: "We had live bands on an open air stage, held a touch rugby tournament and used ticket sales and a raffle to raise money.</p>
      <p>"It was really well received and went on late into the night. We have now considered it as a regular event.</p>
      <p>"It was designed as something Ben would have enjoyed and it couldn't have been done without the support of his family.</p>
      <p>"It has been a great way to keep us connected."</p>

      <p>Ben's sister, Tori Hallam, 44 worked with Oli and the club to organise the festival event as a way to remember her brother.</p>
      <p>She said: "A year on I just thought let's turn this awful day into something nice and raise some money.</p>
      <p>"It was so nice to pull people together to remember Ben and to see how much he meant to people.</p>
      <p>"There is such a long history at the Nottingham Casuals for Ben and they've all been so lovely and supportive.</p>
      <p>"We're all really grateful to the club and it's been great to see how much Ben meant to people.</p>
      <p>"He was good humoured and as someone else said, 'predictably joyful and joyfully predictable!'</p>
      <p>"Family and friends meant everything to him. He was very loyal and a great uncle to my children.</p>
      <p>"I grew up just thinking he'd be around forever. Losing him has left a big hole in our family."</p>
      <p>Hallam Fest managed to raise a total of Â£1,945 which will be split between Cancer Research UK and the Nottingham Casuals rugby club.</p>
      <p>A presentation to hand over the money will be taking place on Saturday, 14 December.</p>
