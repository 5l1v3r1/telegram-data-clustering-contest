      <p>The <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/dodge/journey/">Dodge Journey</a> is neither fast nor agile, but it has proved a hard-to-hit target for everyone trying to figure out what the next generation will hold, including <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/fiat/">Fiat</a> Chrysler. In 2014, the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2014/05/06/dodge-srt-dart-new-challenger-charger/">automaker's five-year plan for Dodge</a> included an all-new <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/dodge/journey/">Journey</a> in 2016, and a hotted-up SRT version of the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/crossover/">crossover</a> come 2017. In 2016, <a href="https://www.autonews.com/article/20160620/OEM/160619881/is-dodge-taking-journey-to-italy?">"supplier sources" told <i>Automotive News</i></a> a new Journey on rear-drive <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/alfa+romeo/">Alfa Romeo's</a> Giorgio platform would show for the 2019 model year, and production would be moved from Mexico to Italy, Those prognostications came to naught, the 11-year-old Journey riding on its <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2019/09/08/2020-dodge-journey-overview/">Mitsubishi-based platform into 2020</a> with fewer options. <a href="https://moparinsiders.com/dodge-is-working-on-a-new-performance-uv-to-replace-journey/?amp">Now <i>Mopar Insiders</i> says</a> the next-gen Journey could come in 2022 as an early 2023 model, still on the Giorgio platform and given a performance-focused brief.</p>
      <p>According to <i>MI</i>, the new Journey — and it's not clear if the name will be retained — comes in strict two-row, five-seater guise. It "will be around the size of the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/alfa+romeo/stelvio/">Stelvio</a>," the Alfa Romeo coming in at 184.5 inches. Previous reports have said the Journey will be shorter than the current 192.4-inch model, but longer than the Stelvio. The <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/dodge/charger/">Dodge Charger</a> is said to donate major styling cues, and there will supposedly be a Scat Pack trim. Under the hood, the entry-level engine will be the same GME 2.0-liter four-cylinder in that makes 276 horsepower and 306 pound-feet of torque in the Stelvio. MI believes a Hemi V8 will make the options list, hence the Scat Pack. Previously, other <a href="https://www.roadandtrack.com/new-cars/future-cars/a12267107/dodge-journey-alfa-romeo-stelvio/">outlets have figured a turbo V6</a> like that in the Alfa Quadrifoglio models will stand in as the upgrade, although the model is "<a href="http://www.allpar.com/news/2017/05/views-the-next-dodge-journey-37540">being developed with V8s in mind</a>." Any engine choice is expected to be paired with an eight-speed transmission. All of those options far outdo the 2.4-liter four-cylinder with 172 hp and 165 lb-ft, shifting through a four-speed automatic, which is the only powertrain possible for the 2020 Journey.</p>
      <p>The platform switch and the change to rear-drive will greatly enhance on-road manners and performance, but MI believes an all-wheel-drive option should make the transition.</p>
      <p>If Journey production moves to Italy from Mexico, Fiat Chrysler will open up capacity in North America for big-profit crossovers and trucks, and get more from its underutilized European operations. Rumor says the Journey would roll down the same lines as the Stelvio in the Cassino Assembly Plant; the crossover is still sold in Europe and other markets as the Fiat Freemont. The latest timeline puts the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/dodge/">Dodge</a> on arrival in 2022, perhaps as a 2023-model-year offering.</p>
