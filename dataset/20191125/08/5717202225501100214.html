      <h1>Report details impending Bruno Fernandes contract and Tottenham’s potential price-tag</h1>
      <h2>Bruno Fernandes has long been linked with a move to Tottenham.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T08:45:40+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 08:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/mathewcoull/" target="_blank">Mathew Nash</a></address>
      <p>Long-term Tottenham Hotspur target Bruno Fernandes is all set to sign a new contract at Sporting Lisbon, according to reports. </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.ojogo.pt/futebol/1a-liga/sporting/noticias/aumento-para-vencer-bruno-fernandes-saiba-todos-os-pormenores-11547704.html">O Jogo report</a> that Fernandes is set to sign a new deal at Sporting with a €700,000-a-year wage increase. The new deal will also include a release clause of €100 million (£85.8m) and a requirement to negotiate clause of €70 million (£60m). The new deal will be announced next week after a successful meeting on Friday. </p>
      <p>However, that should not put Tottenham off of their reported interest in the player. The report claims the wage increase is simply a contractual reward for Fernandes’ decision to remain at Sporting in the summer despite heavy interest from around Europe. </p>

      <p>It appears that if Tottenham do meet that negotiation clause, Sporting will be obliged to inform Fernandes and talks will be underway over a potential deal for the player. </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7709867/Jose-Mourinho-wants-Spurs-make-Manchester-United-target-Bruno-Fernandes.html">The Daily Mail rounded</a> up the Portuguese reports that suggested Jose Mourinho wanted to bring his countryman to London as soon as possible, carrying on the previous interest from predecessor Mauricio Pochettino.</p>
      <p>Tottenham fans will certainly welcome such a deal, considering the quality of the player and his recent form in the Portuguese capital.</p>
