      <h1>Dublin City Councillors warn of "difficult challenges" ahead of its 2020 budget</h1>

        <b>Dublin City Councillors are meeting on Monday to try and agree a budget for 2020.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ahead of the meeting at City Hall, its chief executive Owen Keegan says this will be a difficult budget.</p>
      <p>To achieve a balanced budget, Mr Keegan is proposing increases in business rates, residential tenants' rents, toll charges and parking charges - together with cuts to community funding.</p>
      <p>He says: "Despite a relatively benign economic environment, the city council faces difficult challenges in preparing a balanced budget for 2020.</p>
      <p>"Significant additional income must be raised if services are to be maintained.</p>
      <p>"The draft budget points to a local government funding system that does not provide the required financial resources to sustain Dublin City Council services."</p>
      <p>The Government has informed Dublin City Council that it will take Irish Water-related rates income of €8.4m from its budget in 2020 and every subsequent year.</p>
      <p>This is despite Government, it says, committing that the transition to Irish Water would be revenue neutral.</p>
      <p>Dublin City homeowners pay €80m a year in Local Property Tax (LPT) - but the council says it typically receives only €4m.</p>
      <p>It says €16m is distributed to other counties and the remaining €60m is used to fund central government programmes.</p>
      <p>"Dublin homeowners are in effect subsidising national Government spending", a voting block on the city council says.</p>
      <p>Dublin City Council and the Government have agreed targets to refurbish vacant housing units and re-let them.</p>
      <p>Dublin Agreement City Councillors say there is a "significant cost" associated with achieving current high standards, but that the Government only contributes 45% of the cost that Dublin City Council incurs to upgrade and refurbish these units.</p>
      <p>It is calling on the Taoiseach and Ministers for Finance and Housing to reverse the decision to take €8.4m in Irish Water related rates - and to fully fund the vacant residential refurbishment.</p>
