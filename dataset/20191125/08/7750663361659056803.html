      <p>Binotto and Ferrari chairman John Elkann were admittedly furious after <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/sebastian-vettel/"><b>Sebastian Vettel</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/charles-leclerc/"><b>Charles Leclerc</b></a> collided in Brazil.</p>
      <p>Reports had indicated that the drivers were summoned to Maranello for crisis talks, but a Ferrari spokesperson says "no official summit nor video conference" was held.</p>
      <p>But the spokesperson revealed: "Since last Sunday, Mattia and the drivers have spoken every day, as they would normally do anyway.</p>
      <p>"The air is now fully cleared and we are focusing on Abu Dhabi."</p>
