      <p>The great thing about Apple hardware is that it ages in the best possible manner. Software support keeps on coming in for years and you don't have to worry about being left in the fog. Take the 2017 MacBook Air for example, it runs the latest macOS Catalina update and packs enough juice to keep you ticking throughout the day thanks to its great battery life.</p>
