      <p>The initiative aims at improving the overall outlook of Pakistani cities by kicking off competition amongst them on various indicators.</p>
      <p>The PM said that much like the one billion tree tsunami initiative in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P), this initiative will also require widespread participation and will make the entire country green with particular focus on cities where specific areas will be identified for plantation.</p>
      <p>The prime minister further said the government will gradually increase funds for this campaign.</p>
      <p>He added that an efficient local bodies system is also being introduced in Punjab and K-P provinces for the empowerment of people at the grassroots level. PM Imran added that the elected representatives at the village level will also be made part of the regional level competitions on environmental indicators.</p>

      <p>PM Imran regretted that Lahore has lost seventy per cent of its green belts in the past decade and has become the second or third most polluted city in the world as no effort was made in the past to protect its environment, as he described pollution as the silent killer.</p>
      <p>Also addressing the ceremony, Adviser to Prime Minister on Climate Change Malik Amin Aslam said the government is committed to make Pakistan a clean and green country.</p>
      <p>Aslam said the first phase of this drive, a competition on healthy cleanliness will be conducted in 19 cities, in which students from schools and universities are encouraged to take part. He also urged the general public to make this drive success.</p>
