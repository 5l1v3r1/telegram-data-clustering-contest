        <b>Mason Greenwood and Brandon Williams both scored for <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/manchester-united-fc/">Manchester United</a> on Sunday and their attacking intentions epitomise what the club is about, according to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/marcus-rashford/">Marcus Rashford</a>.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Red Devils found themselves 2-0 behind against Sheffield United in the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/premier-league/">Premier League</a> before Williams, Greenwood and then Rashford scored to give them an unlikely lead.</p>
      <p>A late Oli McBurnie goal saw the spoils shared at Bramall Lane, which was the least the South Yorkshire side deserved after dominating much of the match.</p>
      <p>Rashford is thoroughly impressed with his fellow academy graduates and how they play the ‘Man Utd way’ although saying that full-back Williams only knows how to attack may be damning with faint praise.</p>
      <p>‘For Brandon, he has done brilliantly since he’s come up with us and obviously for Mason, for any forward, it’s beautiful to score a goal,’ Rashford told <a href="https://www.manutd.com/en/news/detail/rashford-praises-uniteds-powers-of-recovery">MUTV.</a></p>

      <p>‘All they know is how to attack and play forward-thinking football and you can see with the way they attack they just bring that into their game and that is Man United.’</p>

      <p>The draw leaves Manchester United ninth in the Premier League with just four wins from their opening 13 games in the competition this season.</p>
      <p>The Red Devils have not won back-to-back Premier League games since 3 March and are really struggling to find any consistency under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.</p>
      <p>Goalkeeper David de Gea was to thank for the score only being 1-0 to the Blades at half-time on Saturday in an appalling first half display from the Red Devils, which Rashford admits was unacceptable.</p>
      <p>‘We know that we didn’t play well enough in the first half,’ said the striker.</p>
      <p>‘But we managed to find it inside us to get back into the game and get in a good, strong position in the game.</p>
      <p>‘It’s important that we understand the bigger picture and the current situation we’re in and to show the fight that we did today.</p>
      <p>‘Credit to the team and to the manager and to the fans, it was a good spell to get back into the game.’</p>

      <p>Solskjaer could not defend his team’s first half performance, although he was keen to point out that it was not his tactics that were to blame.</p>
      <p>‘I was angry, disappointed, you had to wake them up,’ Solskjaer said. ‘You had to do something about it. I could have changed every player at half-time, apart from the keeper.</p>
      <p>‘It wasn’t about tactics. It was about the desire first half, getting first to the ball, tackling, winning challenges. Sometimes tactics go out of the window.</p>
      <p>‘You have to earn the right to win a game and we didn’t have any right to win the game after 70 minutes. We were nowhere near a Man United team.’</p>
      <p>United are back in Europa League action on Thursday away to Astana before hosting Aston Villa in the Premier League on Sunday.</p>
