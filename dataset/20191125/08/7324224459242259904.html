      <p>Vue today defended its decision to pull gangland film Blue Story from all its cinemas after violence broke out at Birmingham's Star City.</p>
      <p>Bosses claim there were 25 "significant incidents" within 24 hours of the film's release in 60 of its cinemas last Friday.</p>
      <p>Gangs of youths, some armed with machetes, clashed at the Nechells entertainment complex on Saturday evening and seven police officers were injured in the violence.</p>
      <p>Police last night confirmed a sixth teenager had been arrested in connection with the violence that broke out.</p>

      <p>Showcase Cinemas today became the second chain to pull the film from its 21 UK outlets including Dudley's Castlegate Park and Bentley Mill Way, Walsall.</p>
      <p>Vue claim the decision to remove the film from its screens was 'not taken lightly' but was taken following a spate of similar incidents.</p>
      <p>“The decision to withdraw Blue Story was not one taken lightly or without careful consideration of our experience across the country," a Vue spokesperson said.</p>
      <p>"The film opened in 60 of our sites across the UK and Ireland on Friday 22nd November, but during the first 24 hours of the film over 25 significant incidents were reported and escalated to senior management in 16 separate cinemas.</p>
      <p>"This is the biggest number we have ever seen for any film in a such a short time frame."</p>

      <p>Vue added: "Despite a range of precautionary measures in place, including increased security, removal of late-night showings and reduced screenings of the film, the decision to withdraw Blue Story in its entirety was made on Saturday evening on grounds of safety alone.</p>
      <p>"While we are disappointed that these are the actions we have had to take, we hope it is understandable that we cannot, and will not, take any risks with regard to the welfare and safety of our staff and our customers.</p>
      <p>"Unfortunately, the actions of a significant few have spoiled the opportunity for others, but we stand by our decision to withdraw the film from our schedule indefinitely."</p>
      <p>Some reports, including comments from social media, have hit out at the decision claiming the ban is discriminatory.</p>
      <p>But Vue defended its move, saying: "This decision is not, as some have alleged, based on biased assumptions or concern about the content of the film itself.</p>
      <p>"At Vue, we believe passionately in bringing people together and using the power of the big screen experience to entertain, educate and inspire all of our audiences. Blue Story is a fantastic film and one with a very powerful message.</p>

      <p>"It is a film that has the opportunity to change lives. We hope that Blue Story achieves the success it deserves and importantly its message does not get lost.”</p>
      <p>The move came as Blue Story's writer and director, Andrew Onwubolu, condemned the incident and said that his film was about "love not violence".</p>
      <p>Blue Story follows the life of Timmy who lives in Lewisham but goes to school in Peckham and is set against the backdrop of gang rivalry.</p>
      <p>Onwubolu, also known as Rapman, described the incident as "truly unfortunate".</p>
      <p>Writing on Instagram, he said: "Sending love to all those involved in yesterday's violence at Star City in Birmingham.</p>

      <p>"It's truly unfortunate that a small group of people can ruin things for everybody. Bluestory is a film about love not violence."</p>
      <p>The film focuses on two friends from different south London postcodes, on rival sides of a street war.</p>
      <p>It is rated 15 for very strong language, strong violence, threat, sex, and drug misuse.</p>
      <p>Onwubolu added: "I pray that we can all learn to live with love and treat each other with tolerance and respect."</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for Showcase said: "Due to the recent incidents tied to screenings of the film "Blue Story", after careful consideration with the film's distributor, Showcase Cinemas has immediately removed the film from our all of our participating cinemas.</p>
      <p>"Any guests that have purchased tickets in advance can receive a full refund at the cinema box office.</p>
      <p>"We remain in discussions with the distributor with regards to the possibility of re-introducing the film in due course.</p>
      <p>"We apologise for any inconvenience but guest safety remains our top priority."</p>

      <p>The boy, aged 14, was arrested on suspicion of violent disorder after an image circulated on social media showed a number of youths with one carrying a machete.</p>
      <p>It followed earlier arrests of youths including that of a 13-year-old girl.</p>
      <p>Four teenagers who were arrested on Saturday night on suspicion of assaulting police, and a fifth held for obstructing police, have now been released on bail with strict conditions.</p>
      <p>While in custody, the five, aged 13 to 19, were further arrested on suspicion of violent disorder.</p>
      <p>Their bail conditions ban them leaving home at night, and banning them from Star City and any cinema in the UK.</p>
      <p>Breach of bail conditions can lead to further arrest, said West Midlands Police</p>
      <h3>Safety was 'police priority'</h3>
      <p>Seven officers were injured in the course of quelling trouble among the group of around 100 youths on Saturday.</p>
      <p>A dispersal order was put in place allowing officers the power to move crowds on and arrest those who refused.</p>
      <p>By 9pm, the area was largely clear, said West Midlands Police.</p>
      <p>The officers hurt during the trouble had minor facial injuries.</p>

      <p>In addition to the machetes, a knife was recovered from a roundabout near to the venue.</p>
      <p>Many families, some of those attending the cinema to watch Disney film Frozen 2, were caught up in the melee.</p>
      <p>Supt Ian Green, from Birmingham police, said: “This was a major outbreak of trouble which left families who were just trying to enjoy a night out at the cinema understandably frightened.</p>
      <p>“We worked quickly to move the crowds on, but were met with a very hostile response and officers had to draw Tasers to restore order.</p>
      <p>“Thankfully, the injuries to our officers were very minor.</p>

      <p>"We’ve also recovered two machetes and a knife, and it’s clear that some of those who went to Star City were intent on causing trouble.</p>
      <p>“We’ve had a great response from the public who have been very supportive of our officers.</p>
      <p>"We understand that families with young children will have been left upset by what they saw, but we urge people to appreciate that our aim last night was to protect the public and restore order, and that’s what we achieved.</p>
      <p>“We’re aware of a number of images and videos circulating on social media which appear to show those involved in last night’s violence.</p>
      <p>“We are assessing those and have already had a number of phone calls from members of the public giving us the names of people they believe were involved last night.</p>
      <p>“I’d ask anyone with images or video who has not yet got in touch already to do so that we can make further arrests.”</p>
      <p>Anyone with information can call police via 101, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.</p>
