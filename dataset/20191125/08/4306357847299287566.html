      <h1>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer gives bleak Man United transfer update</h1>
      <h2>Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer plays down the likelihood of any new signings in January</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T08:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 08:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thesportreview.com/topics/football-transfers/" target="_blank">Transfer Agent</a></address>
      <h3>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has played down the likelihood of Manchester United landing any top targets in the January transfer window.</h3>
      <p>The Red Devils have made a mixed start to their first full Premier League season under the Norwegian head coach following his appointment almost 12 months ago.</p>
      <p>Solskjaer’s side have struggled to score goals after they sold Romelu Lukaku in a big-money deal to Inter Milan before Alexis Sanchez followed the Belgian striker to the San Siro on loan.</p>
      <p>Manchester United signed off for the international break with a 1-0 loss to Bournemouth at the Vitality Stadium to leave the Red Devils with 16 points after 12 games.</p>
      <p>The Red Devils were linked with a number of players throughout the international break, including Red Bull Salzburg striker Erling Haaland, Leicester City midfielder James Maddison and Sporting Lisbon’s Bruno Fernandes.</p>
      <p>Speaking at his pre-match media conference ahead of Manchester United’s clash against Sheffield United on Sunday, Solskjaer said:</p>
      <p>“It is not about ‘x’ amount of money [we have to spend], it is about who do we think will be good for the club in the long-term, not just three or four months,” Solskjaer said.</p>
      <p>Asked about potential arrivals, he replied: “Probably not because that is the thing – it is in January.</p>
      <p>“Not many clubs want to sell players that they would otherwise want to keep in January.</p>
      <p>“Maybe one or two could be a loan deal but that is not a big money thing, it is just to help the team. But we are getting players back and we are looking at what can be available for us.”</p>
      <p>Manchester United signed Leicester City defender Harry Maguire, Crystal Palace full-back Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Swansea City winger Daniel James in the summer transfer window.</p>
      <p>The Red Devils haven’t won the Premier League title since Solskjaer’s former manager Sir Alex Ferguson was in charge back in 2013.</p>
      <p>Manchester United finished in sixth place in the Premier League table last term.</p>
