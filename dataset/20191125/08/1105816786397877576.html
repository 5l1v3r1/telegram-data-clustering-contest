      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T08:31:13+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 08:31</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/7761/news-2/" target="_blank">News Desk</a></address>
      <p>Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari has decided to join an all-parties conference called by Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman.</p>
      <p>The conference will reportedly take place on November 26.</p>

      <p>The JUI-F chief had called the opposition moot last week to deliberate over the future course of action against the government.</p>
      <p>According to a PPP spokesperson, the PPP chairman decided to join the APC.</p>
      <p>“A PPP delegation, comprising senior party leaders, led by Bilawal will attend the conference,” said the spokesperson.</p>
      <p>Faz had telephoned opposition leaders, including Bilawal and Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leader Ahsan Iqbal and had invited them to attend the APC.</p>
      <p>However, PML-N Vice-President Maryam Nawaz decided not to attend the APC, said reports.</p>
      <p>The JUI-F chief recently held the ‘Azadi March’ series of protests, urging Prime Minister Imran Khan to resign, a demand rejected by the premier.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The protest started with a days-long sit-in in the federal capital. The sit-in was eventually called off and the opposition parties, led by JUI-F, moved onto ‘Plan B’.</p>
      <p>However, the plan to block major thoroughfares of the country did not last long and the party then decided to approach the Election Commission of Pakistan.</p>
