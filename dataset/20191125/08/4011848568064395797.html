      <p>
        <b>1. Samsung Notebook 7 Spin 2-in-1</b>
      </p>
      <p>This is the 13.3-inch edition of the larger Notebook 7 Spin. Worthy at its <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/black-friday-2019-best-black-friday-laptop-deals-available-right-now/">discounted price</a> of $600 available at Best Buy, this device can be converted into a 2-in-1 laptop with a touchscreen feature. It can also be rotated at 360 degrees and switch it to tablet mode. Moreover, the Samsung Notebook 7 Spin 2-in-1 features a typical midrange lineup of components with an 8GB memory and Intel Core i5 CPU. However, it goes outside the standard 256GB SSD you usually see on most midrange devices and twice the storage capacity of 512GB.</p>
      <p>
        <b>2. LG Gram 14</b>
      </p>
      <p>This is one of the Amazon Black Friday 2019 featured products. At a discounted price of $1200, the LG Gram 14 is also available at Best Buy. Like the Samsung Notebook, this also comes as a 2-in-1 laptop, living up to its pedigree, providing tremendous battery life and excellent performance, which is lighter in weight compared to the other products. This 14-inch laptop-cum-tablet features a 16GB of RAM, an Intel Core i7 CPU, and a 512GB SSD. </p>
      <p>
        <b>3. MacBook Air</b>
      </p>
      <p>If you get this high-end laptop at Best Buy, you'll be treated to a $200 discount. At present, the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2019/11/24/costco-black-friday-2019-iphone-galaxy-s10-note10-xbox-ps4-macbook-surface-pro-dell-xps-tv-deals/#2413c1be245c">MacBook Air</a> costs $899. And, if you buy the brand-new 16-inch MacBook Pro, you can save $100 from its regular price as Best Buy is slicing the price with that amount for a discount. There's one condition, though, to avail of the marked-down price. You need to be a My Best Buy program member. For non-members, signing up for the program is free.</p>
      <p>
        <b>4. HP Pavilion Gaming Laptop </b>
      </p>
      <p>Now for only $499 at Walmart, this device ideal for <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/black-friday-laptop-deals">laptop gaming deals</a> as it has impressive features at a reasonable cost. The HP Pavilion Gaming Laptop runs on Nvidia GTX GeForce 100 and Core i5 CPU.</p>
