      <p>Mini Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid joined Good Morning Britain today and met grown-up Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid and they were seriously cute.</p>
      <p>Millie Peake, aged six, and Jack <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/good-morning-britain-christmas-ad-rival-john-lewis-features-baby-piers-morgan-susanna-reid-11176409/">starred in the show’s viral Christmas advert to rival John Lewis</a> and melted hearts as they confessed to the OGs that they wanted to take over from the presenters as stars of the show.</p>
      <p>‘Do you want my job, Jack?’ asked Piers, to which the youngster shamelessly replied: ‘Yes’.</p>

      <p>Susanna then asked: ‘And what about you, Millie. What do you want to be?’</p>
      <p>‘I want to be on Good Morning Britain,’ she enthused.</p>

      <p>Susanna and Piers then challenged their mini-double act to a live audition by getting them to read the auto-cue.</p>
      <p>‘There is a possibility that Piers might not be here in the New Year,’ Susanna began. ‘Should we do an on-air audition?’</p>
      <p>The pair then read through the lines without hesitation, much to the delight of Pies who branded them ‘naturals’.</p>
      <h3>Viewers loved mini Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid and branded them ‘adorable’</h3>

      <p>Thrilled by their efforts, Susanna jokingly commented that it was nice to meet her replacement and wished them good luck for taking over the Good Morning Britain role on Monday.</p>
      <p>Viewers loved Jack and Millie’s appearance on the programme, with some remarking they were even better than Piers and Susanna themselves.</p>

      <p>Elsewhere on today’s show,<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/25/piers-morgan-slams-utter-nonsense-netflix-vegan-documentary-joking-try-sex-changing-diet-gemma-collins-11212997/"> Piers branded the Netflix vegan documentary The Gamechangers ‘utter nonsense’</a> as his co-host suggested he goes plant-based for a while to see whether it would enhance his performance in the bedroom.</p>
      <p>As Piers shut down the idea as he asked ‘who’s going to try me out?’ Gemma Collins, who was sitting in for entertainment reporter Richard Arnold, emphatically replied: ‘Me!’</p>
