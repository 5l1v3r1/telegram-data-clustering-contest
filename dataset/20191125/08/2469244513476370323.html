      <p>We all dream about it, though it seldom happens - but could this be the year for a white Christmas?</p>
      <p>Some forecasters have predicted the coldest winter in 100 years could be on the way, so surely that could mean a flurry of snow?</p>
      <p>The Exeter-based Met Office has released its first look at what the weather could be in the days running up to Christmas - with parts of the country more likely than others to see some of the white stuff.</p>
      <p>The Met Office never releases a detailed forecast until five days ahead, but is has today revealed its long-range forecast running up to Sunday, December 22 - just days ahead of December 25.</p>
      <p>However, at present forecasters at the Met Office say there is no evidence to support the evidence of snow on December 25th - yet.</p>

      <p>It says temperatures for the near future look set to be at or above average - after an icy start to December.</p>
      <p>But Met Office forecasters say long-range forecasts show that mid December is set to be a cold one across the country, with wintry showers in the north and south.</p>
      <p>There is also frost and ice. Things will then change as we head towards Christmas.</p>
      <p>The forecast released on Monday morning reads: "The period is likely to begin on the cold side for most regions, with wintry showers at times in the north, and perhaps over high ground in the south.</p>
      <p>"Widespread frosts and ice are also likely. There looks to be a change around mid-month to milder conditions, although the timing is very uncertain.</p>

      <p>"This change looks likely to bring milder and wetter conditions across most parts of the UK, allowing temperatures to recover to around average, or perhaps slightly above.</p>
      <p>"The wettest conditions are likely to be in the north and west, with an increased likelihood of drier spells in the south and southeast. Colder interludes are still possible, mainly in the north."</p>
      <p>Bookmakers have released their latest odds on it being a White Christmas.</p>
      <p>A Ladbrokes spokesman said: "Generally the odds will be around the 5/1 or 11/2 mark.</p>
      <p>"But we're strapping ourselves in for a potentially record-breaking cold winter so have already trimmed the odds accordingly."</p>
      <p>The last official White Christmas in the UK was 2010 - and while snow also fell in 2015 at 10 places across the UK it didn't settle.</p>
