      <p>Grealish was not called up for Gareth Southgate’s last England squad.</p>
      <p>And as the 24-year-old prepares to return from a calf injury against Newcastle United, Smith says all his man can control are his own performances.</p>
      <p>He said: “We’ve had three international periods now and each time there has been speculation about him getting in there and he hasn’t.</p>
      <p>“So the message has been: ‘Just keep playing’.</p>
      <p>“You saw in October he was nominated for October player of the month, such was his form, so he all he can do is that.</p>
      <p>“If he does that then he will make the people who make the decisions eventually pick him.</p>
      <p>“He’s not in control of whether they pick him.</p>
      <p>“All he can control is his own performance.”</p>
      <p>Grealish picked up that calf injury in the 3-0 defeat at Manchester City last month.</p>
      <p>Villa lost 2-1 to Liverpool late on and suffered a 2-1 reverse at Wolves without the midfielder.</p>
      <p>And Smith explained what he felt they missed without him.</p>
      <p> He said: “He’s a top player, against Liverpool we lost his ball retention. I have no doubt that had he been on that pitch being 1-0 up with 10 minutes to go, he’d have bought some fouls and would have retained the ball in the top-half of the pitch for us.</p>
      <p>“He didn’t and we ended up losing the game.</p>
      <p>“Wolves? Listen, if he’d have played like the others we would have got nothing out of it.”</p>
      <p>And when he returns Smith wants to see him add goals to his assist tally.</p>
      <p>He said: “He’s a top player, bringing goals to his game as well as assists now and that’s all he can keep doing.”</p>
