      <p>The 48-year-old became the first female team boss and owner until the takeover of the Sauber team in 2016.</p>
      <p>Germany's Auto Bild now reports that she is supporting Martin Bruckner's bid to become president of the Austrian football club SK Rapid Wien.</p>
      <p>The election will be held on Monday.</p>
      <p>Indian-born Austrian Kaltenborn said: "Both Formula 1 and football are team sports, where every wheel has to move in order to succeed.</p>
      <p>"Every child plays with cars, and every child has a football," she added.</p>
      <p>Kaltenborn added that she has memories of being taken by her father to watch the club play football in Vienna as a child.</p>
      <p>She now thinks she can play an important role in SK Rapid Wien's future.</p>
      <p>"I have a lot of contacts in Formula 1 and I am active in management, so I can also help with sponsorship," said Kaltenborn.</p>
      <p>"I want to help to make Rapid a top brand not only in Austria."</p>
