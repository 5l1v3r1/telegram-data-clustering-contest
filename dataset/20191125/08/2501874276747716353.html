      <p>"Ready to Hang" is the latest pop-up art show this season. At the Community Arts Workshop (CAW) which is better known as "The Solstice Workshop" at the corner of Ortega Street and Garden Street.</p>
      <p><a href="http://swt.org/events/readytohang2019/">Here</a> are all of my photos from the pre-show reception.</p>
      <p>My wife Merlie had already sold two of her four pieces before the show even officially opened. Here we posed with her floral art:</p>

      <p>The event was especially designed for new artists like her to break into the local art scene. But plenty of more experienced artists were displaying their pieces as well. A wide range of art genres was welcomed with just one rule: They must fit into a 12" x 12" wall space.</p>
      <p>The event was the creation of Michael Evan Long who kindly posed with one of his wonderful "Dream Box" creations:</p>

      <p>He got plenty of help with hanging the art and with other logistics. But he deserves credit for making this event happen to benefit local artists.</p>
      <p>Here is a detail of his Frame Shop creation. Notice the Visa and Mastercard stickers along with a poster for the Ready to Hang event in the shop windows!</p>

      <p>Diane Stevenett is well known as the creator of some of the biggest Solstice ensembles for many years. Here she posed with some of her more modest art pieces:</p>

      <p>Here I photographed just one piece of Diane's memorable Zebras ensemble before the 2011 Solstice parade:</p>

      <p>My friends Rebecca, Matthew and Morgan posed for a family photo:</p>

      <p>I have known Matthew for decades from juggling and other circus arts. Rebecca had three of her artistic creations on display at the show. I have done a photo series of them at the Isla Vista Juggling Festival almost every year since Morgan was born. Since Rebecca missed the Juggling Festival this year, this was a chance to make the 2019 family photo!</p>
      <p>Here was my first photo in the series, from the 2002 Isla Vista Juggling Festival</p>
