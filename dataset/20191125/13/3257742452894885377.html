      <p><a href="https://appleinsider.com/topic/Apple">Apple</a> has previously been reported to be expecting to <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/10/30/apple-gearing-up-to-sell-80-million-5g-iphones-in-2020">sell 80 million 5G iPhones</a> in 2020. However,, Apple has allegedly advised its supply chain that it is forecasting a sharp rise in demand for the <a href="https://appleinsider.com/topic/5G+iPhone">5G iPhones</a> that it is due to release in September 2020.<br/><br/>Specifically, <i>Digitimes</i> <a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20191125PD200.html">says</a> that sources within the Taiwanese supply chain, have been told to expect Apple will sell 100 million of the new iPhones.<br/><br/>Also according to <i>Digitimes</i>, Apple has been expecting to sell between 70 and 80 million of the 2019 range of the <a href="https://appleinsider.com/topic/iPhone+11">iPhone 11</a>, <a href="https://appleinsider.com/topic/iPhone+11+Pro">iPhone 11 Pro</a> and <a href="https://appleinsider.com/topic/iPhone+11+Pro+Max">iPhone 11 Pro Max</a>.<br/><br/>It's true that the iPhone 11, in particular, has <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/10/24/the-iphone-11-was-20-of-all-us-iphone-sales-last-quarter-in-just-two-weeks">been selling well</a>. However, <i>Digitimes</i> has a particularly mixed track record when it comes to hardware sources. <br/><br/>Recently, it claimed that Apple had <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/07/11/editorial-apple-is-not-cancelling-its-ar-glasses">abandoned its AR glasses</a> project and then had to <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/11/04/apple-said-to-partner-with-valve-to-make-ar-headset">walk that back</a>. <br/><br/>Apple has yet to officially reveal that 5G will be included in the 2020 iPhones, although <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/11/06/qualcomm-hints-5g-iphone-coming-in-2020-analysts-say">Qualcomm has hinted</a> at it. The technology is expected to <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/11/03/apples-brawny-5g-iphone-family-will-require-larger-pricey-motherboards">impact the manufacturing cost</a> of the iPhones, but it's expected that despite being late to 5G, these next iPhones will become <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/11/14/new-iphone-to-catapult-apple-to-head-of-5g-smartphone-market-in-2020-analyst-says">market leaders</a>.</p>
