      <h1>Gang of yobs terrorising residents in Victoria Park</h1>
      <h2>A public meeting is to be held</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T13:54:12+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 13:54</time> by <a rel="author">Tristan Cork</a></address>
      <p>Police are stepping up patrols in and around one of Bristol’s biggest urban parks following a spate of violent attacks, muggings and robberies over the weekend.</p>
      <p>The attacks took place in Victoria Park, between <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bedminster">Bedminster</a>, Windmill Hill and <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/totterdown">Totterdown</a>, and are being linked by local residents to a growing number of incidents over the past couple of months involving what they claim are the same gang of young men or teenagers.</p>
      <p>The incidents appear to have begun in September and escalated since the clocks went back and brought darker evenings.</p>
      <p>People living around Victoria Park said they have been reporting a rise in incidents of robberies and assaults, and many have said that it appears the same gang of around four or five young men or teenagers are responsible.</p>

      <p>In the latest attack, a man reported to police that he and a friend were accosted by a group of young men, who demanded their phones and wallets, on Sunday evening at around 5.30pm, and who then hit him with a metal strip and punched him when they refused and ran off.</p>
      <p>He has <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/man-whacked-metal-strip-teen-3576519">now told Bristol Live of his ordeal</a>.</p>
      <p>On Friday evening, another local resident reported they were attacked by a group of youths.</p>
      <p>Police said they were aware of the issue, and were acting.</p>
      <p>“We have had a number of robberies in the park reported to us over the weekend, which we are investigating,” a <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/avon-and-somerset-police">police spokesperson</a> said.</p>
      <p>“There have been other incidents including assaults in the park since September, which we are aware of.</p>

      <p>“We have already stepped up patrols in the area to provide community reassurance and receive information. We’d like to thank the public for being our eyes and ears on the ground and reporting incidents to us, so that we can take positive action,” he added.</p>
      <p>Other reports on social media in the Victoria Park area have been from residents seeing a group of youths smashing car wing mirrors and damaging vehicles.</p>
      <p>Volunteer members of the Victoria Park Action Group, which normally meet to discuss improvements and changes in the park’s facilities, are now including the issue in their next meeting, which takes place next Monday, December 2, at 7.30pm. The group meets at the bowls club in the park.</p>
      <p>Organisers said they have contacted the police, and the police told Bristol Live they would welcome the opportunity.</p>
      <p>“We will be looking for opportunities to meet with members of the community to discuss  concerns within the next week,” said a police spokesperson.</p>
      <p>Local councillor Jon Wellington, whose Windmill Hill ward covers the park, said he was concerned.</p>
      <p>“I have just spoken to the local police area manager PC Sue Coates who has told me that there will be a visible police presence in the park tonight and this week and that they are actively seeking to identify the perpetrators as we speak,” he said.</p>
      <p>“This is the local team's main priority and they are very much aware and taking action. “Obviously this could involve covert as well as visible operations so expect to see more activity in general in the park,” he added.</p>
