      <p>Inspiration for Swimply, the online marketplace for pool sharing, struck founder Bunim Laskin one hot New Jersey summer.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old entrepreneur has 11 siblings and the family watched with rapt attention when a neighbour built a swimming pool for her grandkids to use.</p>

      <p>"We struck a deal my family would help cover the costs so we would have access whenever the grandkids weren't over," Laskin says. "She was actually making a profit and I thought I can bring this community driven solution to as many people as possible."</p>
      <p>Swimply, the online marketplace for pool sharing that he started in 2017 is launching in Australia on Tuesday and Laskin says the startup will "democratise" pool ownership in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane.</p>
      <p>The startup has raised $1.7 million from private investors after Laskin got his start using Google Earth to discover which houses in his neighbourhood had pools and knocking on their doors to ask them to sign up to Swimply.</p>
      <p>"I knocked on 80 doors and got four to sign up," he says. "I entered the scene a rejection veteran literally having the door slammed on me 76 times."</p>

      <p>Swimply's launch in Australia will be the first international market for the startup.</p>
      <p>It has entered into a partnership with pool maintenance supplier Poolwerx giving Swimply access to a database of over 70 per cent of all pools.</p>
      <p>Poolwerx will also undertake compliance checks of all pools to make sure they meet Swimply's hygiene and safety standards.</p>
      <p>"We saw Australia as an opportunity since day one," Laskin says. "Australians do love a pool and it is a country of 2.7 million pools with the highest pool ownership per capita in the world. Australia is also very adaptable to the sharing economy model."</p>

      <p>Laskin says Swimply will offer three pricing tiers of $25 an hour, $50 an hour or $75 an hour depending on the location and the features of the pool.</p>
      <p>The startup makes its money by taking 15 per cent of the commission paid to hosts and charging users a 10 per cent service fee.</p>
      <p>Laskin won't reveal the startup's turnover but says in the United States Swimply's app was downloaded 15,000 times in the first two weeks of launch.</p>
      <p>"It has slowed down since then," he says.</p>
      <p>Swimply is raising a further $3 million to drive its global expansion and to help it address crucial issues like insurance and where to go to the toilet.</p>
      <p>Laskin says Swimply "encourages" its hosts to offer toilets to Swimply users.</p>
      <p>"We do incentivise our hosts," he says. "If you don't offer a restroom we don't allow over a one hour reservation."</p>
      <p>He says safety is "100 per cent" a concern for Swimply.</p>

      <p>"I have a lot of younger siblings so it is something that strikes home for me, it is something we approach incredibly cautiously," he says.</p>
      <p>Users under the age of 18 are not able to make a booking without supervision.</p>
      <p>"At this point we have done thousands and thousands of hours booked with zero incidents to date," he says. "Our goal is to certify these pools and provide the safest experience possible and use that data to create an insurance policy that can kick in."</p>
      <p>Laskin is also undeterred by competition from the many public swimming pools in Australia.</p>
      <p>"We are not just an alternative to getting wet," he says. "We are trying to replicate the pool ownership experience. Until now the only way to achieve this was to be very economically privileged."</p>
