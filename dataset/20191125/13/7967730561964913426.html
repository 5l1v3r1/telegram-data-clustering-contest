        <b>Aries</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>March 21- April 19</i>
      </p>
      <p>As the Sun moves into your sector of adventure and travel you’ll tire of the tried and true and will crave unique experiences. Familiar company will frankly become boring – you want new sights, sounds and people in your world! Use this wave of intrepidness you to take the road less travelled and do things you’d only dreamt of.</p>

        <b>Taurus</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>April 20-May 20</i>
      </p>
      <p>Your sector of intimacy and joint resources gets some cosmic TLC courtesy of the Sun. Starting today focussing on your partner’s desires as well as your own, will produce wonderful, lasting results. It’s also a good time to define or redefine your status and what it means to be a couple to ensure you’re both on the same path.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Gemini</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>May 21-June 21</i>
      </p>
      <p>Over the next few weeks you may feel as though things aren’t quite coming together as you’d planned. No, this isn’t a bad sign of things to come, rather a lesson on the rewards that come from being patient and flexible. If you plan ahead and try not to overextend yourself you’ll be fine.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Cancer</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>June 22-July 22</i>
      </p>
      <p>You’ll have a lot more time and energy to focus on a fun or important creative endeavour. This will not only be the perfect distraction (because you’ll be feeling rather mischievous) but it will also be highly therapeutic. It’s also a good time to infuse your love life with a bit of romance and laughter.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Leo</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>July 23-August 22</i>
      </p>
      <p>If you’ve been ignoring something in the vain hope that it will simply go away today you will need to face the music. This is a good day to deal with problems rather than swept under the carpet, especially in regards to family and home. Productive conversations and new patterns of positive behaviour can also be established.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Virgo</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>August 23-September 22</i>
      </p>
      <p>It’s not like you to make waves but with the stars making you feel rather bold, brave and rebellious you’ll be fighting an almost incessant urge to rock the boat! Your usual need for approval will suddenly dissipate and you’ll feel very happy with the decisions you make and course of action you take.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Libra</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>September 23-October 22</i>
      </p>
      <p>Your need for mental stimulation is becoming a driving force as the Sun moves into your sector of intellect and communication. Ensure you have plenty of highbrow books to read, brain apps and crosswords to challenge your mind. As your memory retention is also enhanced this is an ideal time to study or learn something new.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Scorpio</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>October 23 – November 22</i>
      </p>
      <p>Normally you don’t like change. However, with Mars, the pioneering planet, in your sign you’ll feel intrepid, bold and up for new experiences. Say yes more than no. Mingle with different crowds and face a fear. Your charisma will also be at an all-time high so if you’re single this is the time to make a good impression.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Sagittarius</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>November 23-December 20</i>
      </p>
      <p>End the month with a new you! With the Sun and Venus joining forces in your sign you’re likely to take a more strategic approach towards your direction instead of flying by the seat of your pants. It’s also the perfect time to reassess where you’re heading, what you wish to accomplish and how to do it.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Capricorn</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>December 21-January 19</i>
      </p>
      <p>Your social life will be positively manic and not just because it’s that time of year. Silly season or not, Mars is invigorating your friendship sector so there’ll be plenty of fun in store! If you’ve been pondering a pivotal move, holiday or course of study this is the best time to plant the seeds.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Aquarius</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>January 20-February 18</i>
      </p>
      <p>Xmas might be just under a month away but the stars are already getting the jump on the silly season. Your social life is on overdrive and although for the most part, enjoy every minute it could also prove exhausting. Don’t say yes to the opening of an envelope and be discerning about how you divide your time.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Pisces</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>February 19-March 20</i>
      </p>
      <p>When was the last time you gave yourself a makeover? With the Sun and stylish Venus in your image sector this is the perfect time to change your hair, invest in some quality wardrobe items and revamp your look. While you’re at it, a positive attitude adjustment will also make you look and feel great.</p>
