      <h1>“He takes them all” – Chelsea player on Lampard’s training corners, and what Mourinho taught him</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T13:52:28+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 13:52</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/author/annie/" target="_blank">Sport Witness Team</a></address>
      <p>Kurt Zouma joined Chelsea in 2014 from Saint Etienne and was immediately sent back to the French club on loan.</p>
      <p>During the defender’s period with the Blues he’s also been out on loans to Stoke City and Everton, with the Toffees keen to get the player back for this season.</p>
      <p>Frank Lampard wanted to keep him around for this campaign and has used the Frenchman as one of his key players, a position that Zouma has wanted to be in for some time.</p>
      <p>The defender has given a lengthy interview to <a href="https://www.francefootball.fr/news/A-lire-dans-france-football-l-interview-de-kurt-zouma-chelsea-je-suis-un-autre-homme/1083596">France Football</a> and talked about various periods of his career.</p>
      <p>Given Jose Mourinho is once again strong in the news, he was asked to comment on his former Chelsea manager: <i>“It was he who opened the gates of England for me. I’m only 19 when I arrive there. It’s young. It is also him who gave me confidence by making me play big games with a lot of intensity. He was the one who showed me what football was like in England. The coach is a man who hates losing. He taught me to hate defeat. Thanks to him, I was able to flourish at Chelsea. He gave me a lot of things and taught me a lot. I thank him.”</i></p>
      <p>Zouma is one of a large number of players to have credited Mourinho with helping their career, and Chelsea fans will hope the same is said of Lampard in years to come.</p>
      <p>On his latest Chelsea manager, the 25 year old was also glowing, explaining how he takes a hands-on role in training:<i> “He is a coach who is really close to us. It shows that he was still a player recently. He talks to us a lot, participates a lot in training. When we work defensively on corners, it is he who kicks them all. You should see the precision he has… It’s amazing. He has so many qualities with his feet.”</i></p>
