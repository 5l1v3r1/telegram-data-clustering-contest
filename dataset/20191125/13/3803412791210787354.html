      <p>Even at its regular price, the Hisense 4K TV is considered an entry-level budget option. The best kind of budget TV is the budget TV on sale because then it's even more budgetier. Plus, despite its cost, the Hisense has a ton of excellent features that help make life a little more convenient for you.</p>
      <p>For example, it has Bluetooth. That expands your entertainment options tremendously. You can connect the TV to Bluetooth audio through speakers or a sound bar. Or you can enable your own private listening by using Bluetooth earbuds. Other features include 120 motion rate for fast-moving action and high-intensity gameplay, an LED panel for rich colors, and DTS Studio Sound to help create a virtual surround sound system in your living room.</p>
      <p>The TV also has Google Assistant built right in. Talk to Google and control your entire smart home from the couch. Check on the kids or see who's at the door by viewing smart cameras attached to your network right on the screen. Search for your favorite shows using your voice. Order a pizza or check out sports scores without pulling out your phone.</p>
      <p>You can also use the Android TV smart platform to binge all your favorite content. Get access to Netflix, Hulu, YouTube, and other video platforms. You can also stream music through Spotify, Pandora, and others. You'll find live sports, news, and more.</p>
      <p>Connectivity options include three HDMI ports and a USB input for connecting a flash drive or something like that.</p>
