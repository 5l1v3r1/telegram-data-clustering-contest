      <p>It is evident that Australia is developing a siege mentality with China. Rather than keeping on sniping at China over matters of political interference, Hong Kong, trade and security, there is one way to eradicate the problem. Stop buying Chinese imports and cease exports to China. Problem solved. It may create bigger problems but the China threat will cease. There is the choice.</p>

      <h4>It's not a free lunch with Mandarin in it</h4>
      <p>Wake up, Australia, and especially Victoria. Chinese influence is invading all levels of our country and society ("China revelations a major wake-up call", Editorial, 25/11). It starts before most of our youngest generation can even read. The Confucius program, run by the Chinese government, funds and chooses its staff for the embedded Mandarin programs in some of our state schools.</p>
      <p>There are many good reasons to teach the Mandarin language in our schools, but there are no good reasons for this teaching to be totally controlled by the Chinese government in some schools. Remember there is no such thing as a free lunch.</p>

      <h4>Take-over observation is preposterous</h4>
      <p>What a preposterous assertion from former ASIO boss Duncan Lewis that Australia is under assault from the Chinese government trying to "take over" Australia's political system. What a sad indictment of the level of intelligence in our senior officials. What inflammatory rubbish.</p>

      <h4>Treatment of Uighurs parallels Stalin</h4>
      <p>Xi Jinping's treatment of the Uighurs places him in the same category as monsters such as Stalin for his liquidation of the Kulaks and Hitler for his treatment of the Jews. The world must condemn China for what is happening in its Xinjiang province.</p>
      <p>However, the manner in which Australia responds to Xi's cruelty needs to be sensitively handled. In today's world the concept of governance integrity is increasingly important. This refers to the extent to which the values shaping a nation's domestic policies are also reflected in its global posturing.</p>
      <p>Before Andrew Hastie, James Paterson and others self-righteously megaphone their critiques of China to the world, they need to reflect on their own government's treatment of Indigenous Australians and asylum seekers.</p>

      <h4>Appeasement is not a moral policy</h4>
      <p>A little over two years ago, I visited Xinjiang province in far western China as a tourist. This was before details emerged about concentration camps for Chinese Muslims. Walking around Kashgar, the main Uighur city, was uncomfortable. Why were there tanks stationed on most major intersections and helmeted soldiers sitting beside them, with bayonets drawn, glaring at passers-by?</p>
      <p>The Uighurs I met and saw were friendly, colourful, sociable, family people. The feeling I had was of being in Nazi Germany circa 1936 and substituting the Uighurs for Jews. Reading lately about actual concentration camps and slave labour, the parallels are chilling.</p>
      <p>There are 52 Islamic nations or Muslim-majority nations whereas the Jews in 1936 had no nation. When are they and the West going to do something?</p>
      <p>History taught us that appeasing tyrants merely emboldens them.</p>

      <h3>FORUM</h3>
      <h4>Spin cycle</h4>
      <p>Unfortunately a lot of what John Pesutto writes about is ancient history (Comment, 25/11). I have recently retired after 47 years in the public sector and have experienced the creeping politicisation of the sector from both sides of government.</p>
      <p>Senior appointments to departments are routinely approved by the minister's office, policy branches are hollowed out in favour of advice from thinktanks, corporate boardrooms and a small army of ministerial advisers.</p>
      <p>In fact, fear and frank advice are often interpreted as "pushback" by both ministers and their staff. Pesutto is correct in noting that communications branches are increasingly peopled by social media experts, who tweet, Facebook and Instagram messages approved by ministerial offices. It's about getting political messages out into cyberspace. The Westminster system is long dead in this country, replaced by a hybrid American/British system, a kind of Washminster approach to governing.</p>

      <h4>Act, minister</h4>
      <p>If, as Aged Care Minister Richard Colbeck asserts, "up to 30 per cent of aged care services are not up to scratch", we cannot afford to wait for what comes back from the royal commission in 12 months.</p>
      <p>And if he truly wants some "attitudinal and cultural change in the industry", could I strongly suggest that instead of resorting to meaningless rhetoric, he takes the concrete step of urgently revisiting the foolish staffing requirements of the 1997 Howard/Bishop Aged Care Act under which providers now operate. This might at least signal to the frail aged residents in those "below par" facilities that this government is serious about finally improving their care.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Glenda Addicott, Ringwood East</b>
      </p>
      <h4>Care before profit</h4>
      <p>The elephant in the room in many aged care facilities is in the conflict of interest between making large profits and providing high-quality comprehensive care with nutritious diets. All aged care facilities should be run on a not-for-profit basis. Only then will we eliminate the problems highlighted in the royal commission. The present system is morally corrupt and cannot be sustained in the longer term.</p>
      <p>It will take bold action by government to radically shift the emphasis to providing real care for our ageing population.</p>

      <h4>The untouchables</h4>
      <p>If the unions, not the banks, had been the target of the royal commission that uncovered so much wrongdoing, we'd never hear the end of it until the perpetrators were all safely locked up. Why should the banks be so untouchable?</p>

      <h4>Trump the lame</h4>
      <p>While I agree with much of Nick Toovey's letter (25/11) regarding Donald Trump's unfitness to perform the job he does, I take issue with his description of Trump as a "lame duck".</p>
      <p>A lame duck can still fly, and could even swim (albeit probably only in circles). A lame racehorse, however, can't run or walk, and is always euthanised, often on the track (in Congress, if you follow the analogy). Therefore, we should describe the president as a lame-horse leader.</p>

      <h4>The risk is real</h4>
      <p>The wellbeing of the Richmond West Primary School children is not a political game. It's great to hear some locals have been positively affected by the opening of the supervised drug-injecting facility, however this does not nullify or invalidate the many negative and traumatic experiences of other residents, health centre users and school families.</p>
      <p>As a RWPS parent, I want to see the facility moved to reduce the risk of my children being harmed by a drug-affected driver on Lennox Street, a public drug deal gone wrong and/or the violent and unpredictable actions of an ice user near the school (my children and I have already experienced one violent and unprovoked attack on Lennox Street last April), to name just a few reasons.</p>
      <p>The Police Association has proposed moving the facility. It could continue to save lives in a non-residential location â€“ we have seen the honeypot effect. Does a child have to be physically hurt before it is recognised that the risk is real?</p>

      <h4>Children come first</h4>
      <p>Perhaps the saddest indictment yet on the minority arguing to keep the Richmond injecting room at its current site can be found in a suggestion that the everyday exposure of children to rampant drug dealing, public injecting and other antisocial behaviour be seen as an "educational opportunity".</p>
      <p>This is absurd and, to the best of my knowledge, is in complete contradiction to research in relation to childhood development and wellbeing.</p>
      <p>In response to those who would make such suggestions, there is a very clear message: our community refuses to accept the normalisation of this behaviour as part of our children's environment. It is the responsibility of all adults to provide them with a safe and nurturing environment, the first step of which must be relocation of the injecting room as a priority.</p>
      <p>
        <b>David Horseman, Richmond</b>
      </p>
      <h4>Lives are being saved</h4>
      <p>I worked in a solicitor's office in Victoria Street in Richmond for about a year before the injecting room opened and there was a lot of drug dealing and using going on in plain sight. There were also many people overdosing and collapsing in the streets and needles and syringes everywhere. I had to stop on my way to work one day and give CPR to a young woman who had stopped breathing and collapsed after overdosing in a toilet near Victoria Street.</p>
      <p>There were ambulances racing around the area regularly and people were dying on the streets. The injecting room is saving lives and providing a safe and clean place for those who need to inject. It also provides assistance if people want to stop using drugs, and counselling, so is a very important place for them.</p>
      <p>There are always going to be people who don't want it near them no matter where it is, but it's sensible to have it in an area where drug dealing and using have been rife for years. From my observations of Victoria Street over many years, the trading has slowed down on occasions, but people still go there to dine at the good places.</p>

      <h4>Not holding breath</h4>
      <p>James Ricketson's appeal to the Prime Minister to intervene on behalf of Julian Assange is both timely and praiseworthy ("Ricketson to PM: Free Assange", 25/11). However, I'm not holding my breath. Scott Morrison has declared that Assange will receive no special treatment in spite of evidence of mounting support for his case, not to mention the pleas of his father. If it was appropriate for one PM to intervene on behalf of a fellow Australian citizen, then surely our present PM can do the same for Julian Assange.</p>

      <h4>Change must come, now</h4>
      <p>Recent discourse on global warming and its impact on the Australian continent has encouraged urgent action to avoid further damage. This implies that the position can be turned around. This is either misleading or ignorant. The lead time to reverse warming is decades and while we continue pumping out greenhouse gases the situation becomes increasingly intractable.</p>
      <p>Because of Australia's particular vulnerability we should be global advocates and lead the world in decarbonisation. Instead our government is encouraging further development of fossil fuel capacity as if a magic solution to this wicked problem will emerge.</p>
      <p>Our hope for a sustainable living environment in much of Australia rests with an immediate and sharp decrease in the burning of fossil fuels. This means change on a massive scale in all fields of human activity. And it requires courageous leadership. Is there someone with those qualities and the moral courage to lead the country from disaster?</p>

      <h4>One summer's day</h4>
      <p>So, what to do about Australia Day? A mature nation would not wish to select a day that deeply upsets its First Nation brethren. January 26, only relatively recently designated as our national day, can easily be seen as "Invasion Day". Personally, Australia Day should be in summer. So, let's pick a day in January or February. How hard is that?</p>

      <h4>Surely he must go</h4>
      <p>Surely Westpac chairman Lindsay Maxsted must resign. His statements "we accept we have fallen short of both our own and regulators' standards" and "we just don't know ... where the accountability lies" are simply mind-boggling.</p>
      <p>Despite those admissions he says, "This chairman, and the board, fully understands that we're here to act in the best interests of the company". If that is the case, and they do understand they are responsible for the bank's culture, financial, human and reputational wellbeing, how is it they managed to miss an extraordinary 23 million breaches of the anti-money-laundering laws and failed to investigate thousands of payments apparently related to child exploitation?</p>
      <p>The breaches experienced by Westpac are not the result of the actions of a few malcontents or saboteurs. Rather they have arisen directly from the failure of the board to address its responsibilities. Indeed, not only should the chairman resign, the rest of the Westpac board should also give serious consideration to their position.</p>
