      <p>Friday Olokor, Seme Border</p>
      <p>A delegation of the Federal Government led by the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, on Monday visited the Seme Border to assess the state of affairs following the closure of the borders.</p>
      <p>The Minister said over 296 illegal immigrants have been arrested while some cache of arms and ammunition have been recovered from illegal importation,</p>
      <p>The government delegation was welcomed by protesters lamenting the loss of over N5 billion by businessmen whose goods were affected by the closure.</p>
      <p>Mohammed at a press briefing after the tour said the closure has halted the smuggling of foreign rice to the country.</p>
      <p>According to him, while farmers are expanding their farms, the closure has increased revenue generation just as monthly import revenue has increased by 50 per cent</p>
      <p>He said, “I thank all the stakeholders who have come here to receive us and I want to assure you that the Federal Government has sent this very high-level ministerial delegation to ensure exactly how important the issue of national security has had on the economy.”</p>
