      <p>Kimberley Walsh admitted that she and Cheryl had "cried their eyes out" over Nadine Coyle on I'm A Celebrity.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/tv/cheryls-swipe-itv-im-celebrity-17278467">The Girls Aloud star</a> said her reaction to seeing her former bandmate on the ITV show had really surprised her.</p>
      <p>Kimberley is close to her former girl group members Cheryl and Nicola Roberts - but the trio rarely see other members Nadine and Sarah Harding, sparking rumours of a feud.</p>

      <p>"I couldn't believe the reaction I had to her jumping out of the plane, you realise how much you care for someone in that moment.</p>
      <p>"I'm so impressed that she did it, she's doing great."</p>
      <p>The panel asked her about the feud reports and Kimberley admitted that she and the girls didn't see Nadine as much.</p>
      <p>She said: "There was a genuine connection between us three (her, Cheryl and Nicola), whereas with Nadine and Sarah it was more of a work relationship.</p>

      <p>"But it's completely untrue that we are voting for her to do trials, I spoke to Cheryl the other day when she was doing a task and she said 'I'm crying my eyes out, this is awful'.</p>
      <p>"We want her to do well."</p>
      <p>In the jungle Nadine has been <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/tv/im-celebritys-nadine-coyle-tells-17289078">speaking about her former bandmates,</a> also denying there was a feud between them.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/tv/im-celebritys-nadine-coyle-opens-17283071">Nadine spoke about the band</a> and how she doesn't really see them any more because "everyone gets on with their lives."</p>

      <p>Jacqueline asked Nadine if she could ask her a question and Nadine said: “Of course.”</p>
      <p>Jacqueline asked Nadine what it was like being in a girl band.</p>
      <p>Nadine said: “Really good, really good, I like being in a girl band.  I am one of three sisters and went to an all-girls grammar school so I’m used to being around girls.”</p>

      <p>Jacqueline asked if Girls Aloud were put together like Little Mix.</p>
      <p>Nadine said: "The public had voted, it was ITV’s Popstars the Rivals so a girl band and a boy band and the public put us together.”</p>
      <p>Jacqueline asked Nadine if she got on with everyone in Girls Aloud, Nadine said: “Yes.”</p>
      <p>Jacqueline said: “I’d heard you didn’t get on with Cheryl" and Nadine said: “Fake news.”</p>
