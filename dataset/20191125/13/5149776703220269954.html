      <p>Staff and students have kicked off eight days of strikes at the <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/university-of-nottingham">University of Nottingham</a> after disputes about pay, working conditions and pensions failed to be resolved.</p>
      <p>Picketers labelled staff conditions a “disgrace” as <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/education">students</a> stood in solidarity with the university’s workers who said they saw the action as a “last resort.”</p>
      <p>Around 50 protesters stood at the University Park west entrance, with pickets also taking place at the east, north and south entrances, as well as on the Jubilee and Sutton Bonington campuses.</p>
      <p>The decision was <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/staff-university-nottingham-strike-eight-3566180">announced to begin eight days of strikes on November 22</a> after officials from the University and College Union (UCU) stated that they felt they had no alternative.</p>
      <p>The university have said they are working to improve how they support the workload and wellbeing of staff, and are recruiting more female staff to senior roles.</p>
      <p>But one staff member said he felt the University had "abused" the trust and good faith of its staff.</p>

      <p>Adam Sharman, a 56-year-old senior lecturer in modern languages, said: “Above all, it was about the pension disputes for me, which began 18 months ago. We were going to go on strike then but we called it off because a panel was set up with half its members from the university and half from the union.</p>
      <p>“They published a report on these issues but that has been ignored and that’s why we are willing to lose eight days of pay.</p>
      <p>“There’s also the fundamental issue of how trust and good faith has been abused. The turnout shows the depth of feeling.”</p>

      <p>Glenn Lees, a 42-year-old teaching associate with the University's chemistry department, added: "I am picketing because of the fixed term contract I have to work. It means I never know where I would be working in a year or so and that affects things like not being able to get a mortgage.</p>
      <p>"It's frustrating when you think that the training and studying for these jobs takes around seven to 10 years."</p>
      <p>UCU says the changes to the pension scheme - called the Universities Superannuation Scheme - mean "a typical member will pay around £40,000 more in to their pension, but receive almost £200,000 less in retirement."</p>
      <p>Anna Rich-Abad, a lecturer with the history department, said she had to start working at the university on 'hourly pay', creating uncertainty for her too, and agreed that in her 14 years at the university she has seen staff work in poor conditions.</p>

      <p>Chris Lanyon, 29, and a PhD maths student at the university, is also a member of UCU and added: "I'm here in solidarity with the staff.</p>
      <p>"The fact that they feel ignored is bad enough and things like casualisation are making peoples working conditions worse.</p>
      <p>"These things can really affect the learning of undergraduates who have a lot of contact with staff."</p>
      <p>Casualisation is where a workforce moves from being employed mainly on permanent contracts to one engaged on a short-term basis.</p>
      <p>Sarah Wilson, a 29-year-old member of the university's administration staff, said: "Casualisation and pensions affect administration staff just as much as lecturers so that's why I'm here."</p>
      <p>Another student, 22-year-old Alice Smith who studies French, said: " I think it's a disgrace that staff have to go through things like casualisation. They deserve better than having to deal with racial and gender inequality. If they're stressed, it will impact our ability to learn too."</p>

      <p>Matt Green, UCU's University of Nottingham branch president, said: "We hope that by protesting, the university will live up to their assurances made to us. It's fantastic to see the students here too."</p>
      <p>Dr Paul Greatrix, registrar at The University of Nottingham, said: “The University will be open and we are doing everything possible to minimise disruption for our students. The majority of teaching is proceeding and students should assume that classes will take place unless notified otherwise."</p>
      <p>A total of 60 universities and colleges in the UK were due to be affected by today's strikes. However, Nottingham Trent University is not one of them.</p>
