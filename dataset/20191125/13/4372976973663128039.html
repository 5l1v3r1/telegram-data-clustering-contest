      <p><a href="http://www.autoblog.com/ford/">Ford</a> has joined with three other automakers in siding with California’s ability to determine its own automobile emission standards, taking sides in a key fight with the Trump administration, which has sought to overrule those standards. The new <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2019/11/17/2021-ford-mustang-mach-e-revealed-la-auto-show/">Mustang Mach-E it just unveiled</a> is a key reinforcement of <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/ford/">Ford</a>’s commitment, and it may help explain why it threw its cards in with the Golden State.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2019-11-24/the-electric-mustang-is-a-key-part-of-fords-plan-to-average-51-mpg-in-six-years"><i>Los Angeles Times</i> reports</a> that Ford would need to boost its fleet wide average <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/tag/fuel+economy/">fuel economy</a> to nearly 50 miles per gallon by 2026 under the California rules at a time when it’s sunsetting all of its fuel-efficient small cars, like the <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/ford/focus/">Focus</a> and <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/fiesta/">Fiesta</a>. The company has established a goal of having full-<a href="http://www.autoblog.com/electric/">electric vehicles</a> comprise a third of its overall sales by 2030, up from zero today.</p>
      <p>The White House is currently fighting in court to revoke California’s right to establish its own strict tailpipe emissions regulations and zero-emissions vehicle mandates. Twenty-two states joined California in suing the Trump administration over the issue. Ford has sided with <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/honda/">Honda</a>, <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/bmw/">BMW</a> and <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/volkswagen/">Volkswagen</a> in supporting California’s position.</p>
      <p>That position was underlined, the <i>Times</i> reports, when Ford Chairman Bill Ford Jr. <a href="https://twitter.com/MaryNicholsCA/status/1196273071121817601">posed for a photograph</a> with Mary Nichols, the chairwoman of the California Air Resources Board, at the Mach-E launch event on Nov. 17.</p>
      <p>It makes sense that Ford, which has <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2019/11/21/ford-mustang-mach-e-origin-story-naming-controversy-film/">sunk years of development work and second-guessing of itself</a> into its forthcoming battery-electric <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/crossover/">crossover</a>, would want to preserve the regulatory certainty. Left unsaid in the story is the role that the stricter regulations could play in juicing demand for <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/electric/">electric vehicles</a>, which still comprise only about 2% of the overall U.S. vehicle market. California is the biggest U.S. market for <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/electric/">EVs</a>; the <i>L.A. Times</i> <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2019-09-10/ev-electric-car-sales-california-tesla">previously reported</a> that EV sales rose nearly 64% during the first half of 2019 and accounted for almost half of all electric vehicles sold nationwide, though they’re still only 5.5% of the state's auto market.</p>
      <p>Ford is also working on <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2019/01/16/electric-ford-f-150/">hybrid and full-electric versions of its best-selling F-150</a> pickup <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/truck/">truck</a>, the former due late next year, and it has also pledged a <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/tag/plug-in+hybrid/">plug-in hybrid</a> version of the <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/ford/escape/">Escape</a> <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/crossover/">crossover</a> next year. For now, it also offers the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/ford/fusion+energi/">Fusion Energi PHEV</a>.</p>
