      <p>Zinedine Zidane has admitted he is a big admirer of PSG forward Kylian Mbappe ahead of Real Madrid's game against the French giants on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Mbappe is regarded as one of the world's best forwards and was instrumental in helping France win the World Cup in 2018 despite being just 19 years of age at the time.</p>
      <p>Mbappe has long been linked with a move to Madrid, and Zidane said he had always been a great admirer of the player.</p>
      <p>"I've known him for a long time," Zidane said. "I'm in love with him, firstly as a person, because he came to do a trial here a while ago.</p>

      <p>"He is a rival, and that's it. I cannot say anything else."</p>
      <p>Mbappe has made a stunning start to the season, scoring nine goals in 11 appearances in all competitions, including a hat-trick in PSG's last Champions League game, a 5-0 thrashing of Club Brugge.</p>
      <p>He was forced to miss out with injury during the reverse fixture against Madrid, which PSG won 3-0 in Paris, and will no doubt be desperate to make his mark in his first appearance at the Bernabeu.</p>
      <p>Mbappe's current contract with PSG runs until 2022, meaning it would likely cost a world-record breaking sum if Madrid were to try to prise him away.</p>

      <p>Los Blancos star <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/eden-hazard-outlines-plan-convince-20952386">Eden Hazard recently admitted he would love to play alongside the Frenchman</a> , and said he wanted to try to convince him to make the move to Spain.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <i>Le Parisien</i> he said: " "In a few years he will be the best player in the world. He is a great talent. If he continues like this, Kylian will go down as one of the best players in history.</p>
      <p>"A footballer always dreams of playing with the best and if tomorrow I was able to help bring him to <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> , I would try.</p>
