      <h2>A vegan woman has sparked a heated debate after revealing she was "riled up" with her mum for cooking bacon in her house while staying with her</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T13:00:19+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author">Courtney Pochin, https://www.facebook.com/courtneypochinmirror/?modal=admin_todo_tour</a></address>
      <p>A woman, who follows a <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/vegan">vegan</a> lifestyle has recently had her mother over to stay.</p>
      <p>Things were all going well, until she discovered that her mother had been frying <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/food">bacon</a> in the kitchen one morning.</p>
      <p>The unnamed woman, who lives in Australia, said she was left feeling "riled up" by her mum's actions.</p>
      <p>In case you were unaware, vegans don't eat any animal-based products, including items such as meat, cheese and honey.</p>
      <p>The woman explained the situation in a post on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> , reports <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-7721759/Vegan-woman-sparks-debate-online-discovering-mother-frying-bacon-house.html?ito=social-facebook&amp;fbclid=IwAR1gQWMKjQqekJQb3uYVi7bjtCtUe7vIifwqyurPKNL-oYAjMn8sucm5wlc">Femail,</a> where many people agreed her mum was being "disrespectful".</p>
      <p>However not everyone had sympathy to give.</p>

      <p>She wrote: "Mother is staying with me and currently frying bacon in my kitchen.</p>
      <p>"I feel so mad and riled up. Please send love and sympathy."</p>
      <p>Some people replied with absolute outrage at the mother's disregard for her values.</p>
      <p>"It's your house," said one user. "Ask your mother to stop doing that as it goes against your values. Ask her to respect those values by not cooking animal flesh in your house."</p>
      <p>Another person commented: "Just because she's your mother does not entitle her to do whatever she pleases. You are an adult, you need to set boundaries.</p>
      <p>"Just have an honest conversation with her. Hopefully she'll come around."</p>
      <p>A fellow vegan said she'd be "puking" from the smell of the bacon and would have set down "no bacon" as a rule from the start.</p>
      <p>"I'd be pretty p***ed off too to be honest," added someone else. "I hope you're able to have an adult conversation as to why you don't like it and I hope she respects your wishes."</p>
      <p>But some people didn't think it was a big deal.</p>
      <p>A different user told her bluntly to have a conversation with her mum and then "move on".</p>
      <p>They continued: "It's not worth feeling upset over something like that."</p>
      <p>A second wasn't very impressed by the post and told her simply to "be nice" to her mother.</p>
      <p>A third asked: "What's your mother meant to eat and how is she meant to cook?"</p>
      <p>It's not clear whether the woman and her mother had a conversation and what the outcome was.</p>
