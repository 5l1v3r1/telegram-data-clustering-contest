      <p>Director: Ashutosh Gowariker</p>
      <p>Release Date: December 6, 2019</p>
      <p>Panipat is an upcoming 2019 historical war film directed by Ashutosh Gowarikar. Based on the Third Battle of Panipat, it stars Arjun Kapoor, Sanjay Dutt, and Kriti Sanon. It is the time when the Maratha Empire had reached its zenith and their grip on Hindustan reigned supreme with no one to challenge them until an invader set his eyes on the throne of Hindustan. It is a period drama and we all are excited to see Arjun Kapoor as Sadashiv Rao Bhau who is the commander in chief of the Maratha Army and antagonist Sanjay Dutt as Ahmad Shah Abdali, who hails from Afghanistan, while Kriti is playing the role of Parvati Bai, wife of Sadashiv Rao.</p>

      <p>Director: Mudassar Aziz</p>
      <p>Release Date: December 6, 2019</p>
      <p>Pati Patni Aur Woh is an upcoming romantic comedy film directed by Mudassar Aziz and produced by Renu Ravi Chopra. The film is a remake of the 1978 film of the same name, and the stars Kartik Aaryan, Bhumi Pednekar, Ananya Panday, Rajesh Sharma and Aparshakti Khurana. Pati Patni Aur Woh shows Kartik two-timing his wife but soon getting deeper into the mess as the lies pile up. Bhumi plays a convincing sari-clad ‘emotionally high-maintenance’ wife who is a teacher. Ananya adds glamour as Kartik’s love interest Tapasya.  </p>

      <p>Director: Gopi Puthran</p>
      <p>Release Date: December 13, 2019</p>
      <p>Mardaani 2 which is a sequel of Mardaani stars Rani Mukerji as a fiery cop, Shivani Roy, who is in charge of arresting a serial rapist. The trailer of the film hit the screens not so long ago and was appreciated for not compromising on dealing with reality. Rani has transformed herself into one of the finest actors in Bollywood when it comes to portraying such characters. Over the last several years, Rani Mukerji has consciously changed her girl-next-door persona that we saw in the early 2000s. From Tina in Kuch Kuch Hota Hai or Naina in Kabhie Khushi Kabhie Gham, she's moved on to playing maturer roles in Mardaani and Hichki.</p>

      <p>Director: Jeethu Joseph</p>
      <p>Release Date: December 13, 2019</p>
      <p>The Body starring Emraan Hashmi, Rishi Kapoor, Vedhika and Shobhita Dhulipala is all set to hit the silver screen on December 13. It’s a remake of the Spanish film El Cuerpo (2012) and offers a healthy dose of drama, suspense, and thrills. It revolves around a police officer’s search for a body gone missing from a morgue. We can't wait for this mystery to get solved and find out who is the actual culprit.</p>

      <p>Director: Prabhu Deva</p>
      <p>Release Date:  December 20, 2019</p>
      <p>While we saw many action dramas in Bollywood during the ’80s and ’90s where the protagonist was playing a police officer, Salman brought the trend back to the big screen. Following the success of Dabangg, we saw characters like Singham, Simmba, and Sooryavanshi emerge. We will continue to see Salman Khan as Chulbul Pandey and Sonakshi Sinha as Rajjo in the upcoming Salman Khan film. The previous two instalments of the upcoming Salman Khan film had different directors as well so it’ll be interesting to see how Prabhu Deva takes the franchise forward.</p>

        <b>6. Good Newwz</b>

      <p>Director: Raj Mehta</p>
      <p>Release Date: December 27, 2019</p>
      <p>Good Newwz brings a humorous situation to the fore. Directed by Raj Mehta, the film features Akshay Kumar, Kareena Kapoor, Kiara Advani and Diljit Dosanjh as couples who have opted for IVF to become parents. While Akshay, Kareena, and Diljit impress with their entertaining ways, Kiara adds her unique flavour to the film. The trailer of Good Newwz was released recently and has been getting a positive response. Good Newwz is going to be the last release of 2019 and we are sure it is going to break all records.</p>
