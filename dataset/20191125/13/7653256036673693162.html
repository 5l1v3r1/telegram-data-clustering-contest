      <p>NEW DELHI: <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Maharashtra">Maharashtra</a> Deputy Chief Minister <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Ajit-Pawar">Ajit Pawar</a> on Monday told the Supreme Court that he is from the real Nationalist <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Congress">Congress</a> Party (<a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/NCP">NCP</a>) and has been authorised by 54 of the party's MLAs to take a decision on their behalf on government formation in the state.</p>
      <p>Pawar, who is the nephew of veteran NCP leader <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Sharad-Pawar">Sharad Pawar</a>, told the top court that "the quarrel in the family will be resolved soon".</p>
      <p>A bench of Justices N V Ramana, Ashok Bhushan and Sanjiv Khanna was told by senior advocate Maninder Singh, representing Ajit Pawar, that the letter of support given to <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Governor">Governor</a> Bhagat Singh Koshiyari for government formation along with the <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/BJP">BJP</a> is "factually and legally correct".</p>
      <p>"I am the NCP. The letter I gave is factually correct. There is nothing to contradict the letter. I was authorised as a legislative party leader by 54 MLAs of my party to take a decision on their behalf on government formation, on the day I gave that letter. The quarrel I have within my family will be resolved soon but this petition must end now." Singh said.</p>
      <p>He said that even the petition filed by <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Shiv-Sena">Shiv Sena</a>, NCP and Congress combine in the apex court said that he is a NCP leader and "even they have impleaded me as party".</p>
      <p>The top court asked Singh what he has to say on the question of floor test in the assembly for proving the majority.</p>
      <p>Singh replied that on the issue of floor test he will adopt the arguments of senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for Chief Minister <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Devendra-Fadnavis">Devendra Fadnavis</a>, that the court cannot interfere with the discretionary exercise of power by the governor in asking the government to prove its majority on the floor of the house.</p>
      <p>Rohatgi said Fadnavis had Ajit Pawar's letter of support of 170 MLAs and thereafter he staked claim to form the state government.</p>
      <p>"It is nobody's case that the documents submitted by Fadnavis to the governor are forged," he said.</p>
      <p>Rohatgi said that some kind of a feud was going on in the Pawar family.</p>
      <p>"One Pawar is with me, another Pawar is with them in the Supreme Court," he said and added that the combine was unnecessarily alleging that some kind of horse-trading was going on."In fact, till Friday, they were indulging in horse trading," he added.</p>
      <p>The top court said it will pass an order at 10.30 AM on Tuesday on the issue of floor test for the Maharashtra government led by Devendra Fadnavis whose swearing-in has been challenged by the Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress combine.</p>
      <p>The order by the top court is keenly awaited as the combine has sought advancement of the floor test for which the BJP-led government was granted 14 days on November 23 by the Governor.</p>
