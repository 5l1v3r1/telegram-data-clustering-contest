      <h1>Fiat Chrysler has now sold over 15 million minivans</h1>
      <h2>That’s a lot of minivans</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T13:18:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 13:18</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.autoindustriya.com/author/jose-altoveros.html" target="_blank">Jose Altoveros</a></address>
      <p>If there’s one thing Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) is good at, it's building minivans. Despite FCA’s numerous ups and downs throughout the years, their minivans have continued to be a hit in various markets all over the world. This holds especially true for the US market. Since their first minivan, the Plymouth Voyager, rolled off the production line in November 1983, FCA has now sold over 15 million minivans throughout the globe.</p>
      <p>“Reaching 15 million minivans sold isn’t just about hitting a number, it’s about the memories families have made and the children who have grown up driven to school or practice or on a family road trip in a Chrysler Pacifica or Pacifica Hybrid, Dodge Caravan or Grand Caravan, Chrysler Town &amp; Country or Voyager over the past three and a half decades,” said Tim Kuniskis, Global Head of Alfa Romeo and Head of Passenger Cars – Dodge, SRT, Chrysler and FIAT, FCA – North America. </p>

      <p>Though they’re not as popular here, minivans, in general, have been a staple model in most North American homes. If you visit either Canada or the US, you’ll likely see one around a corner no matter wherever you go. Most kids probably grew up riding in one. </p>
      <p>Today, FCA’s minivan lineup is composed of the Chrysler Pacifica, Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid, Chrysler Voyager and Dodge Grand Caravan. However, it was the original Dodge Caravan that cemented the automaker’s name in minivans. In fact, it is even said to be America’s best selling minivan of all time.</p>
      <p>With 15 million minivans sold and counting, expect to see FCA’s popular people carrier model to continue for the years to come. With a hybrid version of the Chrysler Pacifica already on sale, it is possible a pure electric version could debut in the not-so-distant future.</p>
