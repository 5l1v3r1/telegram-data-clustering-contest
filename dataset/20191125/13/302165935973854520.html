      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 25 — The sinkhole along Jalan Maharajalela here is caused by a burst underground pipe.</p>
      <p>Kuala Lumpur City Hall Corporate Planning Department director Khairul Azmir Ahmad in a statement today said the repairs works of the burst pipe and the affected road had been completed by Syarikat Bekalan Air Selangor Sdn Bhd contractors.</p>
      <p>“The situation has recovered at mid-day today and the affected car had been removed with the help of the police,” he said.</p>
      <p>In the last night incident, a car driven by a woman fell into a three-metre square sinkhole at Jalan Maharajalela heading towards Jalan Loke Yew at about 11.35 pm.</p>
      <p>The 42-year-old victim was however unhurt.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia geologist Prof Madya Dr Tajul Anuar Jamaluddin said sedimentation could also occur when there were limestones under a surface.</p>
      <p>“The natural characteristic of limestone which is soluble makes it easy to form underground or subsurface cavities.</p>
      <p>“When there are heavy loads on the surface, the cavities (empty spaces) will collapse and form a sinkhole. The size of the sinkhole depends on the size of the cavity itself,” he said when contacted by Bernama.</p>
      <p>Tajul Anuar said other factors that could cause a sinkhole were changes in underground water levels and shocks or vibrations.</p>
      <p>“Therefore, it would be best for the relevant agencies to conduct detailed geophysics studies prior to building physical infrastructure to identify the underground cavities,” he said. — Bernama</p>
