      <p><a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=Met+%C3%89ireann">Met Éireann</a> has issued a weather advisory for Wexford, Cork and Waterford on Tuesday as the remnants of an Atlantic storm passes along the south coast of <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/news">Ireland</a>.</p>
      <p>A combination of high tides, strong winds and heavy bursts of rain will impact the south coast, bringing a risk of flooding during Tuesday.</p>
      <p>More generally, strong to gale force easterly winds and heavy rain are forecast for much of Munster and Leinster tomorrow.</p>
      <p>Met Éireann said the powerful winds were coming from weather system in the mid-Atlantic which is moving towards Ireland.</p>
      <p>While the winds will be powerful they have not prompted a weather warning.</p>
      <p>For the rest of the week the weather is set to remain unsettled, cloudy and showery until Friday when dry, sunny spells should develop and continue into the weekend.</p>
      <p>The cloudy conditions for the early part of the week will see daytime temperatures around normal for this time of year, in the region of 9 degrees to 12 degrees, with mostly frost free nights.</p>
      <p>On Thursday night temperatures will fall to between minus 2 to 3 degrees overnight with a risk of frost.</p>
      <p>Temperatures will remain lower on Friday and into the weekend.</p>
