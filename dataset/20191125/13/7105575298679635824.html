      <ul>
        <li>Jenna Dewan was caught on camera saying "She's always extra!" about Camila Cabello during her AMAs performance with Shawn Mendes.</li>
        <li>Fans wondered if it was shade, but Jenna hit Instagram Stories to deny it, saying she has nothing but love for Camila and "Señorita."</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Last night, Camila Cabello and Shawn Mendes hit up the American Music Awards and performed—you guessed it—their hit song "Señorita." The performance was about as sexy as you'd anticipate (read: very sexy!), but things got a little awkward when the cameras flashed to Jenna Dewan. Jenna leaned over to her friend and stylist Brad Goreski, rolled her eyes, and appeared to say "She's always extra."</p>
      <p>Here's the video:</p>

      <p>Jenna shut down the drama on her way home from the AMAs, hitting Instagram Stories and saying “I’m getting a lot of text messages from people wondering if I was shading Camila. No! I love her, I love her so much. I’m such a big fan of hers. I don’t understand what that’s about but no, I love her, love her, love her.”</p>
      <p>Brad was also in the car, and said, “Guys, we were bumping and grinding so hard to ’Señorita.’ We’re obsessed.”</p>

      <p>I mean, "always extra" could be seen as a compliment, especially when it comes to Camila (extra, in the best way!). Watch this and tell me it isn't a <i>little</i> extra:</p>
