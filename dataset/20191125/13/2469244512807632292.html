      <p>The death of Sean Haslegrave, at the age of only 68, has seen Torquay United lose one of the key figures in the transformation of the club after their 'Great Escape' from Football League relegation in 1987.</p>
      <p>Haslegrave was about to celebrate his 36th birthday when new Gulls manager Cyril Knowles invited him to become player-coach at Plainmoor, in the wake of the dramatic 1986-87 season and the last-day 'police dog bite' relegation-beating 2-2 draw with Crewe Alexandra.</p>
      <p>Haslegrave had already enjoyed a distinguished career with his hometown club Stoke City, Nottingham Forest where Brian Clough signed him, Preston North End, Crewe Alexandra and York City.</p>
      <p>Knowles and midfielder Haslegrave, who played as if he was a teenager, galvanised the side and the club.</p>
      <p>Haslegrave was a regular as United reached the Fourth Division Play-Offs in 1988, but he was concentrating more on coaching when the pair took the club to Wembley for the Sherpa Van Trophy Final 12 months later, after plotting a huge upset win over Wolves in the Semi-Final.</p>
      <p>Haslegrave, whose 599 career appearances included 49 for Torquay, left along with Knowles after two-and-a-half years at Plainmoor and became youth coach and then Centre Of Excellence Director at his old club Preston.</p>
      <p>He later worked at the nearby Cardinal Newman College and coached the English Colleges FA Side.</p>
      <p>He had been ill for some time before he died in Preston at the weekend.</p>
