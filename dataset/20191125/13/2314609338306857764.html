      <h1>Give 10 regional towns 'priority status' to power the economy: Business Council</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T13:30:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 13:30</time> by <a rel="author">Eryk Bagshaw</a></address>
      <p>The Morrison government must select 10 regional towns to power the economy outside of Sydney and Melbourne, Australia's top business lobby has warned, calling for a list of cities with airports, universities and industry to be given special status to stimulate economic growth.</p>
      <p>Geelong, Ballarat, Newcastle, Wollongong, Toowoomba and Busselton would be among the top contenders for priority status, which would see infrastructure delivered to funnel workers into the key areas at the expense of other towns and cities.</p>

      <p>Business Council of Australia chief executive Jennifer Westacott will on Tuesday tell the National Press Club "Australia has become stuck in a pattern of projects, rather than places" and that a top-10 list needed to be drawn up immediately to "get the ball rolling".</p>
      <p>Ms Westacott will say the top 10 should be chosen on the basis of having nearby gateway infrastructure such as an airport or major transport routes, two successful industries, strategic importance, proximity to major power grids, a university and a TAFE, and available housing and health services.</p>
      <p>"We cannot spend twelve months arguing about which places should be chosen. Using my criteria, the places select themselves," she will say.</p>
      <p>"Not every place can be selected, and we cannot make decisions based on electoral politics."</p>

      <p>She will call on business to match the government's commitment to the regions, which have been stuck with above-average levels of unemployment, skills shortages and a lack of private investment amid the economy's worst overall performance since the global financial crisis.</p>
      <p>"Business should do the maths on what it would take to go to Bathurst, not Bangalore," she will say.</p>
      <p>"We need to identify the places around Australia that can make the greatest economic contribution to their regions, their states or territories, and the whole country."</p>
      <p>Ms Westacott will also take a jab a the Morrison government's research and development policies which have been criticised by economists for failing to lift productivity.</p>

      <p>"Companies who have a very big focus on research and development tell me the tax incentive is not driving collaboration between universities and government, the spending cap is too low and we are running the risk that big companies will go somewhere else to innovate," she will say. "We have to fix the system if it is not working."</p>
      <p>Ms Westacott, who led a failed campaign to cut the company tax rate from 30 to 25 per cent under the Turnbull government, will also accuse the country of cowardice for not delivering billions of dollars in tax relief to businesses.</p>
      <p>She notes UK business leaders and economists are "expressing absolute horror" at Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's plan to lift the UK's corporate rate from 19 per cent to 26 per cent.</p>
      <p>"Even with a hike, it would still be 4 percentage points lower than ours at 30 per cent," she will say.</p>
      <p>"Instead of being aghast at our globally uncompetitive rate, Australia chose to walk away from attempts to bring it in line with other countries."</p>
      <p>In its place she will call for the Morrison government to deliver a broad-based investment allowance that would give businesses a bonus deduction on all new investments.</p>
