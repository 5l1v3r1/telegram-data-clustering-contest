      <p>Get your pooches ready, because Sainsbury’s has just announced a Christmas restaurant dedicated to our four-legged friends.</p>
      <p>For three days only, from 13 to 15 December, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/dogs/">dogs</a> will be able to feast like no pups have ever feasted before, with all the seasonal delights on the menu.</p>
      <p>The event, hosted at the Hus Gallery near Regent Street, will include ‘silver service’ with doting waiters bringing out bowls of snacks such as Sainsbury’s Festive Dinner for Dogs – a drool-worthy mix of turkey, carrots and sage or chicken, duck and turkey.</p>
      <p>And of course, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/11/sainsburys-launches-mince-pies-dogs-pooches-deserve-feel-festive-10899623/">Sainsbury’s mince pies for dogs</a> – released last month – will also be served, and there will be lots of other snacks available for purchase, for both felines and pooches.</p>
      <p>Humans will have their own treats, in the form of Sainsbury’s On The Go Christmas sandwiches and a glass of bubbly.</p>

      <p>Other activities in the restaurant include the chance for your pet to ‘get pupped’, with a professional dog photographer, perfect for those Insta doggies looking for new snaps for the feed.</p>
      <p>If you want to make the photo extra snazzy, why not <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/15/sainsburys-launches-adorable-collection-christmas-jumpers-dogs-11151699/">dress him or her in a festive jumper</a>?</p>
      <p>After all, the pop-up’s opening date is Christmas Jumper Day.</p>
      <p>Tickets cost £5 for one owner and one dog, while two owners and one dog is slightly more expensive at £7.50.</p>
      <p>This will cover one 45-minute session, as well as the dog treats, a Christmas sandwich and a glass of fizz – so it’s a pretty great deal overall (and your pooch deserves to be spoiled).</p>

      <p>Are you a dog lover without a dog?</p>
      <p>You’ll be delighted to know that Sainsbury’s will be hosting three ‘I have no dog’ sessions on 14 December, where you can meet friendly pups and hang out with them while they nibble on treats.</p>
      <p>To make the event even better – there are dogs, how’s that even possible, you ask? – the supermarket will donate all proceeds from the pop-up to Guide Dogs UK, its charity partner.</p>
      <p>The pop-up will be open from 12pm to 7.45pm on the Friday, and open from 9.30am on the remaining two days and closing slightly earlier on both days.</p>
