      <h1>Tottenham boss Jose Mourinho won't end Adidas sponsorship deal despite Nike conflict</h1>
      <h2>The new Spurs manager is reportedly paid around €250,000 per season by Adidas to wear their brand but with Spurs sponsored by Nike it proved a problem for the manufacturer</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T13:10:35+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 13:10</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Milne</a></address>
      <p>It has been revealed that German manufacturing giants Adidas will continue to maintain Jose Mourinho as an ambassador in spite of his move to Nike-sponsored <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> .</p>
      <p>Mourinho has long been associated with Adidas, and in the past has regularly managed clubs who were sponsored by the company, such as <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> .</p>
      <p>He is thought to earn around €250,000 a year from the company, and even after being dismissed by United last year he continued to wear the brand in public and in advertising campaigns, and is seen as one of their most valuable ambassadors.</p>
      <p>And according to <a href="https://theathletic.com/1398545/2019/11/25/ornstein-on-monday-raiola-complicates-united-pursuit-of-haaland-adidas-gives-mourinho-special-treatment-rogue-firms-exploit-premier-league-clubs-bruce-shelves-new-book/?source=shared-article#_=_">The Athletic</a> Adidas will continue their association with the 56-year-old despite the fact he will now regularly be wearing Nike gear due to his move to Spurs.</p>

      <p>The north London club announced a lucrative 15-year deal with the sportswear giant last year, and all their kits and training wear is sponsored by the brand, meaning Mourinho will often be seen in Nike clothing.</p>
      <p>However, it was allegedly decided that due to the publicity and attention the self-proclaimed 'special one' attracts, he was too important a figure to drop, meaning he will be free to wear both Adidas and Nike clothes.</p>
      <p>Adidas are not the only deal which Mourinho has with companies. In the past he has appeared in adverts for Heineken, Hublot and Jaguar, while he most recently starred in an advert for betting company Paddy Power.</p>

      <p>Add all that to his reported £288,000-a-week contract with Spurs and it is fair to say that Mourinho appears to be doing rather well for himself.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/jose-mourinho-gets-down-work-20955818">Mourinho continued to get to know his squad in training</a> today ahead of Tottenham's Champions League clash with Olympiacos on Tuesday and he appeared to be enjoying himself in the session, and was pictured joining in drills with the likes of Harry Kane.</p>
