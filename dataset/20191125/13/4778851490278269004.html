        <b>Whisky producer Isle of Arran Distillers has benefited from a £25 million funding package provided by banking giant Barclays.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The financing has helped the firm to develop its second distillery on the island, in the village of Lagg, which officially opened its doors earlier this year.</p>

      <p>Founded in 1994, the company revived the tradition of whisky distilling on Arran when it built its operation in Lochranza. When a three-year old cask was opened by actor Ewan McGregor in July 1998, the first legal dram of Arran whisky in more than 160 years was served.</p>
      <p>Next year, the distiller will release its first 25 year-old single malt in new packaging.</p>
      <p>The structure of the financing deal lends against the company’s inventory, the value of which will increase as the whisky matures.</p>
      <p>Euan Mitchell, managing director of Isle of Arran Distillers, said: "Times have never been more exciting for our company. With the re-branding of our Arran single malt and the opening of Lagg distillery, it has been a busy year and expansion and change has been at the forefront of our minds."</p>
      <p>Jamie Grant, head of corporate banking for Barclays in Scotland, added: "Isle of Arran Distillers is a perfect example of a business harnessing the power of Scottish provenance, contributing to the global success of our food and drink industry.</p>
      <p>"We have made a significant commitment to the whisky sector by investing both time and money to become industry experts, ensuring we are able to provide bespoke solutions specific to the sector."</p>
