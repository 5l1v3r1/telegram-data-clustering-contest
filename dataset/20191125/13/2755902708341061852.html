      <p>NBA star Patrick Patterson of the  Los Angeles Clippers  has sparked controversy after he referred to black women as bulldogs. Patterson who is married to a white woman, Sarah Nasser, referred to black women as bulldogs when someone questioned his choice of women. The incident happened 2 months ago but gained much prominent this weekend when the comments went viral.</p>
      <p>The issue started when Patterson posted a romantic picture of Sarah as he wished her a Happy Anniversary. After posting the image, one of his followers questioned why he had married a white woman. The follower suggested that Patrick only managed to marry a white woman because he was a millionaire from playing in the NBA.</p>
      <p>This did not go down well with Patterson who asked if he should “settle for a bulldog” when he was asked why he had chosen to marry a white woman.</p>
      <p>Below is part of the exchange,</p>
      <aside><b>Patterson (pdpatt)</b>: true, If I never made it to the nba I would have never met her while playing for Toronto. But why’s it matter? Love is love at the end of the day.<br/><i><b>mafiamaterial_bwa</b>: but it’s not tho bro you grew up loving our woman why wait till you get some real money for your perspective and even if you wasn’t in the nba worked at a Walmart in Toronto you wouldn’t stand a chance bro you just became another statistic. I bet she’s the only one in her family history to date a black. Stay woke my guy.<br/></i><b>Patterson (pdpatt)</b>: so I should settle for a bulldog and act like I’m happy with my life and preach “keep it in your race” to the world as if Dr King didn’t fight/die for equality, acceptance, all cultures loving one another, and no hate? no thanks. That may be your life but I don’t want for mine or my family. Colour doesn’t matter. Wake up.</aside>

      <p>It did not end there, however. Another woman also repeated that had Patterson not been in the NBA making millions, his wife would not have even looked at him, to begin with. Patterson responded by questioning if he should go blind by looking at her instead. This did not go down well with the woman who called him out for disrespecting black woman including his own mother.</p>
      <p>The exchange went as follows:</p>
      <aside><i><b>natnice:</b> If these guys we’re not in the NBA these white woman would not even look at them…<br/></i><b>Patterson (pdpatt):</b> @natnice, so I should go blind by looking at you instead? No thank you.<br/><i><b>natnice:</b> @pdpatt, my point proven…your mama is a black queen…I hope my other black queens put there will see how disrespectful you are.<br/></i><b>Patterson (pdpatt):</b> @natnice, we are all kings and queens at the end of the day. Colour doesn’t matter. Wake Up.</aside>

      <p>However, after being crucified on social media when the comments went viral, Patterson later apologised for the bulldog comment insisting that he had let his emotions get the better of him. He claimed that he was only defending his family after someone made some derogatory comments about his wife.</p>
      <p>Said Patterson,</p>
      <aside>I want to address my use of the word “bulldog” during a conversation with someone who I felt was making disrespectful remarks about my wife and our relationship. I responded with the same, making a cruel comment on his wife’s physical stature. I know that two wrongs don’t make a right, but I let my emotions get the better of me in the heat of the moment. For that, I apologize to him, his wife, and the rest his family for the hurtful and crude comments made on that day.<br/>As I did in the rest of the conversation thread multiple times, I will clarify again that I was not using the term as a reference to black women. That is not at all how I feel, but I do not need to justify to the world that I love my black people. I have no animosity or bitterness towards any race. I believe in love and equality.</aside>
