      <h1>Airbnb hosts in Bristol face being placed on public register for the first time</h1>
      <h2>The San Francisco-based company is coming to the city next year to discuss its proposal</h2>

      <p>Bosses at Airbnb are to meet community leaders in Bristol over plans to place short-term rental hosts on a register for the first time.</p>
      <p>It can be revealed the San Francisco-based property rental platform is planning a visit next year which will form part of a six-month nationwide roadshow.</p>
      <p>The company, which generated more than £1 billion of revenue from July to September, wants to discuss proposals for a “clear, modern and simple registration system” for its hosts.</p>
      <p>A register could shed light on Airbnb hosts who currently only face vetting from the company and few restrictions.</p>

      <p>The company has picked Bristol, as well as <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bath-and-north-east-somerset">Bath</a>, where community leaders and politicians have seen a rise in short-term rentals; blamed for damaging business and <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/rise-airbnb-making-bristols-homeless-845309">reducing the amount of available housing</a>.</p>
      <p>There have also been concerns the short-term lettings are <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/airbnb-bristol-brothel-police-warning-3439733">being used for pop-up brothels.</a><br/><br/>A company spokesman said: “We’ll be taking our roadshow to key cities around the UK and are currently finalising dates for each visit in partnership with local authorities. I can confirm that we’ll be engaging local authorities in both Bath and Bristol.”</p>
      <p>The hundreds of Airbnb listings in Bristol have been accused of squeezing out business for established hotels and bed and breakfasts which pay business rates.</p>
      <p>In some cases, they have also resulted in disruption for surrounding communities.</p>

      <p>They have become so popular that a new type of firm has emerged which advertises several properties in the city, as well as in Bath, London and even Europe, on behalf of out-of-city owners. <br/><br/>A look on its platform for homes for six people or more on New Year’s Eve in Bath provided 109 places to stay with many hosted by the same person or company.</p>
      <p>One host, which provides a popular girl’s name for its profile. has two apartments in Bath while also listings for flats in Leicester Square, Marble Arch and even Lisbon in Portugal. <br/><br/>In her profile she states: “I’m just someone who enjoys opening up my home.” <br/><br/>And then there are companies like Leeds-based Pass the Property which lists four homes in Bath and eight in Bristol. <br/><br/>The individuals and companies are doing nothing wrong as Airbnb allows hosts to manage the listing process on behalf of a number of different property owners. <br/><br/>In London, Airbnb agreed to restrict hosts to a 90-day limit each year. But in Bristol and Bath there are no such restrictions.</p>
      <p>Announcing the roadshow, Patrick Robinson, director of public policy at Airbnb, said: “We want to be good partners to cities and work together on a host registration system that is easy to follow, gives authorities the information they need to regulate home sharing effectively, and that ultimately makes communities stronger. <br/><br/>"Airbnb has long led the way on home sharing rules in London and we want to extend that collaboration across the UK, based on our experience of working with more than 500 governments across the world. <br/><br/>“We hope that other industry players will join us in this important work.”</p>
