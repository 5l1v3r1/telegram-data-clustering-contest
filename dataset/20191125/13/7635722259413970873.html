        <b>The United Nations has confirmed one of its workers was killed, and two people injured, when their vehicle was attacked in the Afghan capital Kabul on Sunday.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Press reports suggest that the vehicle was heavily damaged after being hit by a grenade attack.</p>
      <p>The UN says it happened on a road "frequently used by UN workers", travelling between central Kabul and the headquarters of the UN Mission in Afghanistan, UNAMA.</p>
      <p>The car had UN markings.</p>
      <p>A statement released by UNAMA on Sunday condemned the attack, and called on the Afghan authorities to swiftly investigate and bring the perpetrators to justice.</p>
      <p>The UN Secretary-General Ant√≥nio Guterres also called on authorities to "spare no effort in identifying and swiftly bringing to justice" those responsible.</p>

      <p>The attack comes at a time when Afghanistan has seen record-high levels of civilian casualties.</p>
      <p>In October, UNAMA published a report showing that - in the first nine months of the year - more than 8,000 civilians were victims of violence.</p>
      <p>July was the bloodiest month on record.</p>
      <p>October also saw 85 people killed, and another 373 injured, in election-related violence.</p>
      <p>It is part of what the head of UNAMA, Tadamichi Yamamoto, called a "deliberate campaign of violence intended to undermine the electoral process".</p>
      <p>The UNAMA statement said that neither the identity of the UN worker who was killed, nor those injured, will be released at this time.</p>
      <p>No group has claimed responsibility for the attack.</p>
