      <p>Bill Cosby was sentenced to 3 to 10 years in prison and has been pretty silent beyond maintaining his innocence. Now, Cosby has spoken out in his first interview since being in prison and noted he wouldn’t show any remorse when he is up for parole.</p>
      <p>In the interview, he said, “I have eight years and nine months left. When I come up for parole, they’re not going to hear me say that I have remorse. I was there. I don’t care what group of people come along and talk about this when they weren’t there. They don’t know."</p>
      <p>He also noted that he feels the trial that put him in prison was a “set up,” saying it was a “pay off.” Cosby said, “Look at the woman who blew the whistle. Then she went in and came out smiling, it’s something attorneys will tell you is called a payoff."</p>
