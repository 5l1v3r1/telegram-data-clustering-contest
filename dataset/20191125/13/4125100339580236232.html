      <p>Authorities in Greece say two people have died and hundreds of homes have been flooded following an overnight storm that affected areas west of Athens.</p>
      <p>The bodies of the two men believed to be tourists were recovered late Sunday and early Monday near the port of Antirio, 250 kilometers (155 miles) west of Athens after a sailboat they were using was caught in the severe weather.</p>
      <p>Torrential rain and mudslides caused the closure of the highway linking the Greek capital to the western port city of Patras.</p>
      <p>The worst flooding occurred at the seaside resort of Kineta, where mudslides came from a nearby fire-damaged hillside. Several dozen people trapped in their cars and in flooded homes were rescued by the Fire Service, the agency said.</p>

      <p>Officially say at least five people died as heavy rain slammed the Riviera coasts of France and Italy, trapping travellers in their cars.</p>
      <p>Some roads remained closed Monday on the French Riviera, and rivers are still rising in Italy after the weekend flooding.</p>
      <p>The administration for France’s Var region said four people died, including a couple in their 70s from the perfume capital of Grasse whose car got submerged. Another died after a French rescue boat sank in the Mediterranean and another was found dead in a car.</p>
      <p>In northern Italy, a woman was found dead after the Bomida river swept away her car. Rescuers are also searching for possible victims after a landslide caused the collapse of a stretch of an elevated highway near the flooded city of Savona.</p>
