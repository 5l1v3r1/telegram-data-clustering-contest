      <p>Subhash Chandra has resigned as Chairman of ZEE Entertainment Enterprises Limited, with immediate effect.</p>
      <p>In a filing with the Bombay Stock Exchange, the company said, “In light of the changes in shareholding, Mr. Subhash Chandra has expressed his intention to resign as Chairman of the Board with immediate effect. The Board accepted his resignation and noted that this is in line with the requirements of Regulation 17 (lB) of SEBI Listing Regulations, which inter alia mandates that the Chairperson of the Board shall not be related to the Managing Director or the Chief Executive Officer of the Company.”</p>
      <p>Chandra will continue in the capacity of non-executive director of Essel Group.</p>
