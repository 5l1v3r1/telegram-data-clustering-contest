      <p>Mark Wright has backed up his long-distance relationship with Michelle Keegan with the findings of a recent survey which suggests that time apart could be the key to a happy marriage.</p>
      <p>The celebrity couple – who have been married for four years – are often plagued with rumours that their marriage is on the rocks due to their busy work schedules, which often sees them working in different countries and communicating via FaceTime.</p>
      <p>But the presenter announced on his Heart radio show that couples who frequently work abroad are said to have happier relationships than those who are constantly together.</p>

      <p>‘Today it has finally been revealed, the secret to a happy marriage – regular business trips,’ the former Towie star proclaimed to listeners over the weekend.</p>
      <p>‘Couples where one person sometimes works away claim to have happier relationships than those who are always together, 90% of us. Big number by the way.’</p>

      <p>He continued: ‘90% of us have said having time apart makes us realise how much we love our partner and three-quarters of us think that working away makes their relationship more passionate.’</p>
      <p>Addressing the speculation that he and Keegan are often subjected to talk about the stability of their relationship, Wright added: ‘So when you next go to say, “oh they’re always away from each other, their relationship must be on the rocks, there’s no way it can work, they spend so much time away from each other”.</p>
      <p>‘You know who I’m talking about, yeah you. Don’t surmise it, ’cause this survey proves that time apart makes the heart grow fonder. That’s all I’m saying.’</p>

      <p>The pair spent the first couple of years of their marriage apart as Keegan filmed BBC series Our Girl in Malaysia and Wright took on a presenting job in LA for E!.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, Wright returned to the UK to live full-time with former Corrie star Keegan, telling <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/8438437/mark-wright-returns-uk-michelle-keegan/">The Sun Online</a>: ‘It just feels like the right time to come back to the UK and live here with my wife and family.</p>
      <p>‘I loved my time at Extra and I love my bosses, who I’ve left on great terms with, so I look forward to working with them more in the future.’</p>
