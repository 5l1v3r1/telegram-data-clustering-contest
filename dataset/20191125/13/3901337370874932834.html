      <p>The month of November was a great month for local football. Just this past weekend, we saw our Telkom Knockout finalists revealed and the South African U23s making us proud by qualifying for next year’s Olympic Games in Tokyo.</p>
      <p>In the Absa Premiership, we saw Kaizer Chiefs extend their lead at the top of the table and in December, we will see if they can maintain their grasp at the summit of the log.</p>
      <p>Selections are based on the performances of players in fixtures that have taken place in the preceding month of football action.</p>
      <p>The Soccer Laduma journos are currently in deliberation over this month’s selections. In the meantime, we want to hear from you as to who you think should be the Soccer Laduma ‘Team of the Month’.</p>
      <p>This Monday you get the chance to post your ‘Team of the Month’. See how close you get to the one which will appear in Soccer Laduma this Wednesday.</p>
