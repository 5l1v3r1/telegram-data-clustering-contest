      <p>Dennis Quaid has defended his relationship with fiancée Laura Savoie, who is 39 years his junior.</p>
      <p>The 65-year-old <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/22/dennis-quaid-65-engaged-laura-savoie-26-even-parent-trap-co-star-throwing-shade-10960110/">popped the question to Laura, 26,</a> last month in a romantic proposal in Hawaii, after <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/06/07/dennis-quaid-65-dating-phd-student-26-less-six-months-split-girlfriend-santa-auzina-32-9854102/">first being pictured with the University of Texas PhD student in May.</a></p>
      <p>The age gap between the pair raised many an eyebrow – with even Dennis’s The Parent Trap co-star Elaine Hendrix, who played Quaid’s then 26-year-old fiancée in the film, throwing shade at the engagement.</p>
      <p>However, Dennis isn’t fussed about the reaction to his and Laura’s engagement, calling the coverage ‘wonderful’.</p>

      <p>The Day After Tomorrow star <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/nov/25/dennis-quaid-i-didnt-go-looking-for-someone-younger-on-his-new-love-and-new-roles">told the Guardian</a> that the criticism doesn’t bother them, and said: ‘I didn’t go out looking for an age gap or someone really younger than me. I met her at a business event and then the relationship developed. You have no control over who you fall in love with.’</p>

      <p>Quaid added: ‘I don’t fall in love easy. But I can’t let what a few people think control all that. I’ve been married three times and this is the final one, I know it is.</p>
      <p>‘I feel like I have a real partner in life.’</p>
      <p>The father-of-three was married to actress PJ Soles from 1978 until 1983, and he famously married Meg Ryan in 1991.</p>

      <p>The couple had a son, Jack, in 1992 before they announced their separation in 2000 and divorced the following year.</p>
      <p>After dating model Shanna Moakler for eight months in 2001, Quaid began dating real estate agent Kimberly Buffington and they married in 2004, welcoming twins Thomas Boone and Zoe Grace via surrogate in 2007.</p>
      <p>Kimberly and Dennis split several times over the next few years, with both parties filing for divorce on separate occasions, but in 2016, they split for good, with their divorce being finalised last April.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Laura was previously dating Entourage star Jeremy Piven.</p>
      <p>Quaid also told the Guardian that he and Laura will be embracing their Parent Trap vibes by marrying at the Staglin Family Vineyard, where the film was set.</p>
      <p>Hopefully there’ll be no meddling twins around.</p>
