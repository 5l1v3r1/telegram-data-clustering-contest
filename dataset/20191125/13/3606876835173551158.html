        <p>The actress also opened up on the tough times she went through last year after suffering a miscarriage.</p>
        <p>Njambi disclosed that the unfortunate incident not only broke her and her boyfriend but also their relationship, which had a lot of unresolved issues and a lot of baggage.</p>
        <p>"<i>I previously had a miscarriage and that also gave me the anxiety of sharing this news of this pregnancy..... I remember after the miscarriage on April 2018 everyone told us that everything happened for a reason. We didn't quite understand that it wasn't the right time for us....</i> " Read part of Njambi's post.</p>
        <p>She went ahead to add that the show, Real Househelps of Kawangware, was on a long break and it felt like when the baby died, she (the baby) had gone with all their blessings.</p>
        <p>“<i>And it felt like when our baby died, she went with all our blessings. That was the time TRHK went on a long break, and after that no doors were opening, no opportunity was coming our way. I felt like I was being punished, like God had forgotten about us. I was jobless, stressed, dying inside and lonely”</i> Said Njambi.</p>

          <p>Despite of the darkness she went through, the gorgeous actress came out of it strong and at the beginning of the year, she got pregnant.</p>
          <p>“<i>But look at God, the beginning of this year we were blessed and this time it was the right time. We were ready emotionally, physically mad even spiritually. We had lost our way.... But everyday I keep on saying this is our miracle. It came at the right time with it's own blessings. Am telling you this Lord is an amazing God. I keep telling people that am a living testimony of what the Lord can do". She said.</i></p>
          <p>We wish the family the best of luck.</p>
