      <h1>Compound That Protects Mitochondria May Be Possible Therapy Candidate for Parkinson’s, Study Suggests</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T13:00:56+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author">Catarina Silva, MSc</a></address>
      <p>A small molecule that can protect the function of mitochondria — known as the powerhouses of cells — and prevent cell death can also prevent brain damage in a rodent stroke model, highlighting its potential as a possible therapeutic candidate for neurodegenerative disorders such as <a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/what-is-parkinsons-disease/">Parkinson’s disease</a>, a study has found.</p>
      <p>The results were published in an article, “<u><a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/116/46/23332">A small molecule protects mitochondrial integrity by inhibiting mTOR activity</a></u>,” in the <a href="https://www.pnas.org/"><i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</i></a><i>.</i></p>
      <p>Although the exact trigger for Parkinson’s disease remains to be identified, research indicates that its causative mechanism involves genetics, problems in the mitochondria, and oxidative stress — an imbalance between the production of harmful free radicals and the ability of cells to detoxify, which results in cellular damage.</p>
      <p>Taken together, these molecular and cellular changes eventually lead to the death of dopamine-producing neurons, the type of nerve cell that is gradually lost in Parkinson’s disease.</p>
      <p>Mitochondrial dysfunction can lead to many diseases including neurodegenerative ones. Damage in the cell’s powerhouse triggers a natural process inside the cell, known as <a href="https://science.howstuffworks.com/life/cellular-microscopic/apoptosis.htm">apoptosis</a> (or programmed cell death), with the ultimate goal of killing that same cell.</p>
      <p>Using a lab model that mimicked the activation of damaged mitochondria-induced apoptosis, researchers at <a href="https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/thu2018en/index.html">Tsinghua University</a>, in China, were able to screen and identify compounds that could block cellular death by protecting mitochondrial integrity and function.</p>
      <p>One small molecule, which scientists called compound R6, was found to block apoptosis by inhibiting the release of cytochrome c and protect both mitochondrial integrity and function.</p>
      <p>Cytochrome c is a protein that is released by the mitochondria and initiates apoptosis following the reception of an apoptotic stimulus, functioning like a “go” signal for the cell to initiate its own destruction.</p>
      <p>In addition to inhibiting the release of cytochrome c, Compound R6 also prevented apoptosis by inhibiting another major cellular signalling pathway, called mTOR. This induced the activation of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2990190/">autophagy</a>, a process by which the cell removes unnecessary or dysfunctional components and, in contrast to apoptosis, does not result in cell death.</p>
      <p>Scientists then tested Compound R6’s therapeutic potential in a rat model of stroke. A stroke occurs when a blood vessel that carries oxygen and nutrients to the brain is blocked by a clot or it bursts. As a result, the part of the brain that is irrigated by that vessel cannot get the blood (and oxygen) it needs, resulting in the death of nerve cells.</p>
      <p>Compound R6 was able to cross the blood-brain barrier after being administered via an intraperitoneal (through the abdominal wall) injection. The blood-brain barrier is a semipermeable membrane that protects the brain against the external environment, and is a major barrier for the efficient delivery of certain therapeutics that need to reach the brain and central nervous system.</p>
      <p>Animals that were given Compound R6 showed significantly less neuronal injury than rats without such pre-treatment after a stroke was induced in them. These neuroprotective effects were dose-dependent, with higher (25 mg/kg ) doses having a bigger protective effect than smaller ones (12.5 mg/kg).</p>
      <p>“Given increasing appreciation that mitochondrial damage affects the etiology [cause] of several common and devastating neurodegenerative diseases, Compound R6’s ability to pass the blood-brain barrier and confer strong anti-apoptotic effects should encourage preclinical and medicinal chemistry research efforts, perhaps even extending (…) into evaluation of possible anti-aging effects,” the researchers wrote.</p>
      <p>Compound R6’s molecular and cellular benefits make it a promising potential therapeutic candidate for age-related diseases, such as stroke and Parkinson’s, where mitochondrial damage plays a key role, the researchers said.</p>
      <p>This is not the first time that they have found a molecule able to block cell death. Three years ago, they found a molecule, named Compound A, that could halt the death of dopamine-producing neurons by a different mechanism than that of R6, in a rat model of Parkinson’s disease.</p>
