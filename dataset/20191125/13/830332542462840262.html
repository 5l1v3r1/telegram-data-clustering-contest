      <h2>Site houses one of largest collections in Europe</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T13:45:29+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 13:45</time> by <a rel="author">Bianca Britton and Stephanie Halasz, CNN</a></address>
      <p>(CNN) - Thieves have stolen around 100 pieces of priceless treasure from a castle vault <a href="http://www.cnn.com/style/article/dresden-green-vault/index.html">in the German city of Dresden</a>, the site of one of the largest collections of masterpieces in Europe.</p>
      <p>Several criminals gained access to the Green Vault in Dresden Castle on Monday, according to Roland Woeller, a local politician. He said the perpetrators had stolen artifacts of "immeasurable value."</p>
      <p>"This is an attack on the cultural identity of all Saxons and the state of Saxony," Woeller added. State Police also confirmed the break-in.</p>
      <p>The vault features an astounding collection of historical jewelry and precious ornaments -- from <a href="http://www.cnn.com/style/article/dresden-green-vault/index.html">shimmering bowls carved out of crystal and agate</a> to jeweled gold figurines and goblets fashioned from gilded ostrich eggs.</p>
      <p>Police received a call early Monday morning at 4.59 a.m. saying that a break-in was taking place, Dresden police president JÃ¶rg Kubiessa said during a press conference on Monday.</p>
      <p>"Two suspects were seen on CCTV," Dresden police Chief Criminal Director Volker Lange said. "The suspects came in through a window, and walked towards a glass vitrine, smashed it and left, they disappeared."</p>
      <p>Among the pieces stolen were diamonds and pearls, police said.</p>
      <p>Marion Ackermann, director of Dresden's State Art Collection, said "Incalculable" treasures dating back to the 18th century had been stolen from the vault.</p>
      <p>She added that the value of the heist was difficult to determine, because the work is considered unsellable.</p>
      <p>Ackermann said because the Green Vault's treasures are so well known, she is hoping there will not be a market for them.</p>
      <p>She added that security personnel monitor the museum 24 hours a day.</p>
      <p>Police said they had no information as to whether the thieves had "insider knowledge," but added they were investigating that possibility.</p>
      <p>Saxony's Prime Minister Michael Kretschmer <a href="https://twitter.com/MPKretschmer/status/1198897664273850368">tweeted</a> that the heist meant all Saxons had been "robbed."</p>
      <p>"The valuables found here have been hard-won by the people of our Free State for many centuries," Kretschmer wrote.</p>
      <p>The <a href="http://www.cnn.com/style/article/dresden-green-vault/index.html">collection housed in the Green Vault was established in the early 18th century</a> by Augustus the Strong, ruler of Saxony. He worked to establish Dresden as a major center for the arts, inviting talented sculptors, goldsmiths and painters to take up residence and commissioned a series of magnificent rooms to showcase his valuables as a way of advertising the city's cultural prominence in addition to its wealth.</p>
      <p>The museum said it was closed Monday due to "organizational reasons" and a special police commission has been established following the heist.</p>
