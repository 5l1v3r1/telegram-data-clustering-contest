      <p><a href="https://www.zynga.com/">Zynga Inc.</a>, a global leader in interactive entertainment, announced today a new, holiday-themed activity in its ongoing collaboration with Oklahoma native and Country Music Hall of Famer Garth Brooks and its flagship mobile game, "Words With Friends."</p>

      <p>In celebration of the holidays, Brooks and "Words With Friends" are releasing the first collaboratively designed tile style, featuring a vinyl record. Representing his record-toppling career and the release of his <a href="https://oklahoman.com/article/5645919/video-garth-brooks-plays-callin-baton-rouge-on-ellen-degeneres-show-releases-vinyl-legacy-collection">career-spanning, comprehensive "Legacy" box set</a>, Brooks' vinyl record tile style features his familiar "g" logo overlaid on a classic vinyl LP, according to a news release.</p>

      <p>“Getting to connect with my fans on tour is a truly humbling experience,” says Brooks in a statement. “You learn so much about a day in the life of these folks and you see that we really aren’t all that different. Music, art, games – they bring people together for a great shared experience. Being able to gift 'Words With Friends' players like me with a cool tile style is such a great thing – it’s a real source of joy for me.”</p>
      <p>Players who are 18 and older in the U.S. can also enter to win their own copy of the newly released, seven-disc vinyl box set, "The Legacy Collection," by visiting <a href="https://words2.app.link/WordsWithGarth">zynga.com/WordsWithGarth</a> on or before Dec. 8, according to the news release.</p>
      <p>“Meeting Garth Brooks is every fan’s biggest dream; to get to actually work with him on 'Words With Friends,' a game that has united millions across the world, has been extraordinary,” said Bernard Kim, president of publishing at Zynga, in a statement. “'Words With Friends' players love Garth, and our platform has given them the chance to connect with one of country music’s biggest idols.
