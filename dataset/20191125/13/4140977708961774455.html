The report claims that Pogba has recovered from his injuries. He is not playing to avoid injuries and hamper his dream move to the Spanish Capital.</p>

                            <p>Paul Pogba has only played 5 league matches this season. His last appearance was the 1-1 draw vs Arsenal on September 30.  United have struggled without the player. Although, by the looks of it, the club appears to have come to terms with the players wishes to move on.</p>
                            <p>However, they are still looking for a fee in the range of €150 million. If Real Madrid agree to pay the amount, United will look to use the money to replace the midfielder. While both Pogba and Zidane will finally have their wishes come true.</p>
