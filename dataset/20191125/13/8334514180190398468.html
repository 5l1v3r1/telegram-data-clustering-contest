        <figcaption><b>Musk suggests 200,000 orders for Cybertruck<br/></b>Just days after its "armored windows" got broken at a launch event, Tesla's Cybertruck had received 200,000 orders, according to a Tweet by Tesla boss Elon Musk. David Pollard reports.</figcaption>

      <p>Musk, who has been regularly tweeting about the Cybertruck’s features since its launch late Thursday, has also been updating his followers with the number of orders the company has received.</p>
      <p>In an earlier tweet, Musk said the company had received 146,000 orders for Cybertruck, and tweeted again on Sunday saying “200K” - an apparent reference to the number of orders.</p>
      <p>The company’s website shows that an immediate payment of $100 is required to reserve an order for the Cybertruck, which has a starting price of $39,900.</p>
      <p>The launch of its futuristic pickup on Thursday suffered a setback when the electric vehicle’s “armored glass” windows shattered in a much-anticipated unveiling. The overall look of the electric vehicle had worried Wall Street on Friday, driving the automaker’s shares to close 6.1% lower.</p>
      <p>During the launch, Musk had taken aim at the design, power and durability of mainstream trucks, only to be shaken when his boast about his new vehicle’s windows backfired.</p>
      <p>Separately, Musk said the Cybertruck is Tesla’s last product unveil for a while.</p>
      <p>Tesla plans to start manufacturing the Cybertruck around late-2021.</p>
