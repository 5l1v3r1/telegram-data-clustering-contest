      <p>Actor Vipin Sharma also took to social media to share his condolences.</p>
      <p>“Many techs work over time n rarely get paid for that. Its terrible. Afraid to loose work they stay quiet n keep working. Many times they may not get fully paid as well while they already accept to work for less money in the first place. Rest in Peace Nimish Pilankar,” he wrote on Twitter.</p>

      <p>Inside Edge 2’s Richa Chadha shared on Twitter, “Tragic! Condolences to family. Technicians ARE the backbone. But they aren’t treated at par with others, even though their jobs are both technical and creative! Even ‘technical awards’ are held sooner, or on another date, as though they should be grateful for them. Sigh.”</p>
      <p>Censor Board member and director Mrunalinni Patil posted on Twitter, “Sound technician, Nimish Pilankar, aged 29, has passed away…of high blood pressure leading to brain haemorrhage. Point is; does anyone care? Technicians contribute silently n immeasurably to Bollywood cinema. They work long hours coz they love cinema. Do they get credit?”</p>
