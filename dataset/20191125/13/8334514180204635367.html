      <p>JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia’s human rights commission condemned on Monday the attorney general’s office for barring LGBT people from applying for posts it did not want people with what it called “sexual orientation deviations”.</p>
      <p>Indonesia, the world’s most populous Muslim-majority country, has seen growing state and public hostility towards the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community.</p>
      <p>The AGO’s website listed criteria for applicants and said they could not have “physical or mental disorders, including sexual orientation deviations and behavioral deviations”.</p>
      <p>“We just want the normal ones,” said Mukri, a spokesman at the attorney general’s office, who uses one name.</p>
      <p>“All religions still prohibit that kind of act,” he said, adding that candidates who intended to become prosecutors needed to be tough and professional.</p>
      <p>The agency also said applicants should not be colour blind, or have tattoos or piercings and put limits on their weight.</p>
      <p>Indonesia’s 74 ministries and state agencies, alongside 467 local administrations, started hiring for new civil servant candidates this month.</p>
      <p>The National Commission on Human Rights (Komnas HAM) said the restrictions were a violation of human rights.</p>
      <p>“Everyone should be able to do their jobs without paying mind to their sexual orientations or gender identities,” Beka Ulung Hapsara of Komnas HAM, said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Homosexuality is not a crime in Indonesia, except in the ultra-conservative Islamic province of Aceh, but some religious groups have called for it to be banned. Many members of the LGBT community are not open about their sexual orientation.</p>
      <p>In September, Arus Pelangi, an LGBT advocacy group, reported more than 1,800 cases of persecution of gay Indonesians happening between 2006 and 2017.</p>
      <p>Police have taken high-profile actions against gay clubs and parties in the last few years including detaining scores during raids on gay saunas in Jakarta.</p>
      <p>In May, a police brigadier filed a legal complaint after he said he was fired in Central Java for being gay.</p>
      <p>An Indonesian city in West Sumatra also approved a bylaw last year to fine gay and transgender people up to 1 million rupiah ($70) for behaviour that could “disturb public order” or be considered immoral.</p>
