      <p><b>Eskom said on</b> Monday that it will switch off power in Bloemfontein and other areas in the Free State between 6am and 8pm daily until outstanding municipal arrears are settled.</p>
      <p>The state-owned utility, which is labouring under R450-billion in debt, said in a statement that electricity supply to three Free State municipalities will be cut due to “contravention of the payment conditions concluded with Eskom”.</p>
      <p>The power will be cut during the daytime starting on 3 December, for 14 hours a day, Eskom said.</p>
      <aside>Despite numerous demands, the municipalities have failed to honour payment of their electicity accounts to Eskom</aside>
      <p>Notices of Eskom’s intention to terminate services have been issued to Centlec (delivering a service to the Mangaung municipality, which includes Bloemfontein); the Mafube local municipality; and the Mantsopa local municipality.</p>
      <p>Other areas served by Mangaung include Botshabelo, Thaba Nchnu, Dewetsdorp, Wepener and Van Stadensrus. The Mafube municipality includes the towns of Cornelia, Frankfort, Tweeling, Villiers and parts of Namahadi, while the Matsopa municipality includes the towns of Dawiesville, Excelsior, Ladybrand and Tweespruit.</p>
      <p>“Despite numerous demands, the municipalities have failed to honour payment of their electricity accounts to Eskom.”</p>
      <p>The power cuts will take place every day, including weekends, until payment is made.  — <i>(c) 2019 NewsCentral Media</i></p>
