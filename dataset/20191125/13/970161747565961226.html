      <p>Gregg Wallace’s wife is getting a full hysterectomy next year in her battle with endometriosis.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/05/27/gregg-wallace-dad-wife-anna-gives-birth-baby-boy-9696357/">Anna, 33, gave birth to her and Gregg’s first child together, Sid,</a> back in April after struggling to conceive for two years.</p>
      <p>However, Anna will be having her womb removed ‘early next year’, as well as having part of her intestine removed, after her endometriosis returned ‘severely’ following Sid’s birth.</p>
      <p>Endometriosis is a condition where the lining of the womb starts to grow in other places, such as the ovaries and fallopian tubes, and can cause severe pain, heavy period and difficuly getting pregnant.</p>

      <p>While there is no cure, a hysterectomy lessens the chance of the condition returning.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.ok.co.uk/celebrity-news/gregg-wallaces-wife-anna-reveals-20938675">Speaking to OK!,</a> Anna explained: ‘ My endometriosis, which I’ve suffered with all my adult life, returned severely after I had Sid. It’s so bad I also have to have part of my intestine removed, as it has attacked my bowel too.</p>

      <p>‘It causes me a lot of pain.’</p>
      <p>Anna has suffered with endometriosis since she was 16 but wasn’t diagnosed for years.</p>
      <p>She said: ‘Thankfully I’ve got Sid.</p>

      <p>‘If I had to have this operation without having a child it would have been horrendous. I’ll be on HRT permanently afterwards, so that I’m not up and down with hormones.’</p>
      <p>Gregg, 55, and Anna confirmed they were expecting last year when <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/11/05/gregg-wallace-reveals-baby-joy-as-wife-falls-pregnant-naturally-before-turning-to-ivf-8104157/">Anna fell pregnant naturally as they were due to start IVF treatment</a> – with a doctor calling it a ‘miracle’.</p>
      <p>Anna gave birth to Sid Massimo Wallace in May this year.</p>
      <p>MasterChef star Gregg and Anna started their relationship over Twitter after she reached out to him to help her prepare duck.</p>
      <p>Responding to her privately, the pair then struck up a friendship, and as a result, bonded over their love of cooking and overcame their 21-year age gap to fall for each other.</p>
      <p>Foodie Gregg has two grown children – Tom, 24, and Libby, 21 – from his marriage to Denise, his second wife.</p>
      <p>He and Anna had already agreed to have just one child together due to Gregg’s age.</p>
