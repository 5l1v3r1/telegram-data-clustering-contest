      <p>Tim Rudge's side had started the league season with two straight defeats, but got going at the third attempt at home.</p>
      <p>The Black Country side got off to a good start in the encounter with Captain Cash Evans leading the way in the opening period, scoring 10 of his team-high 16 points as the hosts took a hold of the game early on.</p>
      <p>An even second quarter saw Aston Manor rally slightly, but they could only chip into West Brom's margin by a solitary point as both sides laboured into the half time break, with West Brom leading 38-32.</p>
      <p>Following the break, Aston continued to struggle against West Brom's steadfast defence, and whilst the host's were dominating at their own end, they themselves were also failing to convert shots of their own.</p>
      <p>They did manage to extend their lead however, going into the fourth quarter with a nine-point cushion, with the scores at 55-46 in their favour.</p>
      <p>The visitors mounted a comeback charge as they hoped to break West Brom's resolve in the final period, but despite bringing the score to within three, Rudge's side were not to be denied as they eventually held on to secure their first win of the campaign.</p>
      <p>Evans was delighted to secure the first win of the campaign, but admitted the focus now has to be on the next challenge:</p>
      <p>"We showed spells of our potential throughout the game, I think." he said.</p>
      <p>"Things are starting the click as we grow more comfortable as a unit. With some of the new additions to the team, naturally it takes some time to learn how everyone plays and can contribute.</p>
      <p>"I think Stefan [Artzrouni] and James [Tweedale] have really helped us, and their contribution on the day was clear to see on and off the scoresheet.</p>
      <p>"It's nice to get our first win, but for us the feeling is short-lived. We're completely focused on the next game and performance.</p>
      <p>"Each game we play we grow as individuals and a collective. We're looking forward to the next game and the rest of the season."</p>
      <p>West Brom's premier division side will next face a trip to Birmingham Mets on Monday November 25.</p>
