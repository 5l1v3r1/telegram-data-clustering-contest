      <p>Astronaut Snoopy, Olaf and the rest of the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade balloons may not fly high during this week's spectacular. </p>
      <p>They may not fly at all, multiple media outlets are reporting.</p>
      <p>The 16 massive character balloons may have to stay grounded because of expected windy conditions in New York City, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/24/weather/macys-thanksgiving-day-parade-balloons-trnd/index.html">CNN reported</a>.</p>

      <p>The balloons cannot be flown when sustained winds are more than 23 mph and guests are higher than 34 mph according to laws in the city.</p>
      <p>The rules were set after an incident with the Cat in the Hat balloon, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/24/weather/macys-thanksgiving-day-parade-balloons-trnd/index.html">CNN reported</a>. The balloon was blown around by the wind and crashed into a street light, injuring four people in 1997, <a href="https://apnews.com/432411d8fae22a7334b9ad88400a1033">The Associated Press reported then</a>.</p>
      <p>As of Sunday, the National Weather Service has predicted sustained winds of 22 mph and gusts of 39 mph, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/24/weather/macys-thanksgiving-day-parade-balloons-trnd/index.html">CNN reported</a>. </p>
      <p>Parade officials will make the decision Thursday morning if the balloons will either make an appearance or be scrapped from the parade. </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/28/nyregion/parade-balloons-take-shape-but-flight-is-iffy-depending-on-wind.html">The New York Times reported</a> that the last time the balloons were not allowed to appear in the parade was in 1971.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, the parade's balloons were inflated for a test run held at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, <a href="https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Macy-Parade-Test-Balloons-564290471.html">WNBC reported</a>. </p>
      <p>They will be inflated near the Museum of Natural History on 77th and 81st streets Wednesday afternoon through evening, <a href="http://www.playbill.com/article/playbills-guide-to-the-2019-macys-thanksgiving-day-parade">Playbill reported</a>.</p>
