      <p>The Maharastra government has been a stunner of late, the political scenario giving shocks and surprises to everyone. Days after swearing in as the deputy Chief Minister, NCP leader Ajit Pawar got cleared of charges in the Rs 70,000 crore irritation scam.</p>
      <p>However, the ACB DG Paramvir Singh stated that there was no role whatsoever of Ajit Pawar in the scam and investigations are going on in related other cases. He added that they have been around 3000 tenders in the irrigation related complaints which are not related to the deputy CM.</p>
      <p>The cases which were closed down on November 25 were conditional and can be reopened if they gather more additional information about the case or the courts order another enquiry into them.</p>
      <p>About the scam:</p>
      <p>Ajit Pawar was among the other NCP ministers who were leading the irrigation department at different times between the years 1999-2014. It was during that time that the Congress and the NCP were a part of the coalition government in Maharashtra state. The scam charged on the ministers related to corruption and irregularities in approval and execution of different irrigation based projects during this rule.</p>
