      <p>BERLIN (Reuters) - Thieves who robbed an east German museum in the early hours of Monday stole three “priceless” ensembles of early 18th century jewelry in diamond, ruby and emerald, Dresden police and museum officials said.</p>
      <p>Security camera footage showed two men breaking into the Green Vault museum in the baroque palace of Dresden via a grilled window. They then smashed three display cases, removing the ensembles, or parures, kept in them.</p>
      <p>Describing the stolen works as “priceless”, museum director Marion Ackermann said it would be impossible to sell them on the open market.</p>
      <p>“We are talking here of objects of immeasurable cultural value,” said her colleague Dirk Syndram. “It’s almost world cultural heritage. There is nowhere else a collection of jewelry in this form, quality and quantity.”</p>
