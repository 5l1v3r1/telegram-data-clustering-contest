      <p>Dublin murder victim Eoin Boylan "knew his life was in danger" before he was gunned down in Coolock yesterday, the Irish Mirror understands.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old died a short time after the shooting at Clonshaugh Avenue housing estate on Sunday evening.</p>
      <p>Armed <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/an-garda-siochana">gardai</a> and emergency services rushed to the scene after he was blasted six times by two hitmen at 5.15pm.</p>
      <p>He was shot in the upper body, arm and chest.</p>

      <p>Boylan was treated at the scene by paramedics before being taken to <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/beaumont-hospital">Beaumont Hospital</a>, where he was pronounced dead a short time later.</p>
      <p>It is understood at least two gunmen, who escaped in a Renault Clio, were involved in the shooting.</p>
      <p>Gardai were last night searching for the getaway car.</p>

      <p>The latest murder is the fifth of the ongoing Coolock feud, which has so far claimed the lives of four men in their early twenties.</p>
      <p>Boylan was well-known to gardai and it is understood he knew his life was in danger.</p>
      <p>The Coolock feud kicked off as criminal gangs tried to wrestle control of the drugs trade in the north Dublin area.</p>
      <p>The death of Zach Parker, 23, who was was gunned down outside a gym in <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/swords">Swords</a> last January, ignited the murderous killing spree.</p>

      <p>A neighbour said: “My sister-in-law heard the shot and she couldn’t believe it. He used to work as a milkman.</p>
      <p>“There is a feud around the area. But his mother is a lovely woman and it’s terrible for something like this to happen.”</p>
      <p>The area around Clonshaugh Avenue was sealed off last night as forensic evidence was preserved and detectives combed the area for clues.</p>
