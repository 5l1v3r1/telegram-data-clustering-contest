      <p>With the advent of <a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/news/2020-mercedes-benz-glb-prices-announced-starts-at-eur37700-136723.html">the GLB</a>, the three-pointed star had to rethink the positioning of the GLA within the lineup. The designers have also decided to take <i>‚Äúone and a half centimeters‚Äù </i>off the overall length while adding <i>‚Äúmore than ten centimeters‚Äù</i> to the overall height. More surprisingly, clever packaging and a longer wheelbase helped Mercedes-Benz free up more space for the rear passengers‚Äô knees and feet.</p>
      <p>The shadowy teaser provided from Stuttgart also reveals a boxier silhouette than before, complemented by shorter overhangs for better approach and departure angles. On the other hand, don‚Äôt forget that a crossover such as the GLA is more suited to the blacktop instead of the trail, mud, and other off-road scenarios.</p>
      <p>Protective cladding all around and the upright front fascia help the GLA look more like an <a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/auto-glossary/s.html#ge-sport-utility-vehicle"><u>SUV</u></a> than the outgoing model, and as far as the rear section is concerned, there‚Äôs no denying there are similarities with the GLB.</p>
      <p>Chairman Ola K√§llenius and chief designer Gorden Wagener will take the veils off the second generation, and so far, we know that Mercedes-Benz will use augmented reality in the streamed presentation.</p>
      <p>Augmented reality also happens to be a feature of the GLA, taken from other compact models as part of the satellite-navigation system. Turn-by-turn navigation with augmented reality is complemented by many other technologies such as Active Brake Assist as well as cornering, exit warning, and emergency lane functions.</p>
      <p>What hides under the hood should be obvious to everyone. The W177 generation A-Class features a 1.3-liter turbo four-cylinder and a six-speed manual as standard. Seven- and eight-speed DCTs, a 1.5-liter turbo diesel, and various 2.0-liter options are also available, including the M139 engine from Mercedes-<a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/auto-glossary/a.html#ge-aufrecht-melcher-grossaspach"><u>AMG</u></a> for the 45 series. At the uppermost part of the spectrum, the A 45 S 4Matic+ develops 310 <a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/auto-glossary/k.html#ge-kilowatt"><u>kW</u></a> (421 PS; 416 horsepower) and 500 Nm (369 pound-feet) of torque. üèÅ</p>

        <summary>PRESS RELEASE</summary>
        <p>25 NOVEMBER 2019</p>
        <p>For the first time in its history, Mercedes-Benz is presenting a car as a purely digital world premiere: the new Mercedes-Benz GLA will celebrate its first presentation to the world public on the communication platform Mercedes me media. Those interested can view the world premiere from 2.00 p.m. CET on 11 December at https://media.mercedes-benz.com/gla, wherever they happen to be at the time. Afterwards the world premiere will be available on the website as an on-demand video.</p>
        <p>Against the background of its corporate transformation, Mercedes-Benz is also taking new departures in communication. For example, augmented reality is not just a feature in the new GLA, but also plays an exciting role in the presentation of the new model by Ola K√§llenius, Chairman of Daimler AG and Mercedes-Benz AG, and Gorden Wagener, Chief Design Officer Daimler Group.</p>
        <p>The new GLA, the eighth model rounding off the current compact car generation of Mercedes-Benz, is also the entry-level into the brand's SUV model family. The height of the new GLA exceeds that of its predecessor by more than ten centimetres. This allows a higher, characteristic SUV seating position and more headroom in the first row. Legroom in the rear is also much more generous ‚Äì although the GLA is now one and a half centimetres shorter. Hallmark off-road design features include the upright front section, short overhangs at the front and rear, and protective cladding all-round.</p>
        <p>When it comes to safety, the new GLA has also undergone further development thanks to its driving assistance systems with cooperative support for the driver. Extended functions of the Driving Assistance package include Active Brake Assist, the cornering function, the emergency lane function, the exit warning function alerting the driver to approaching cyclists or vehicles, and a warning when pedestrians are detected near zebra crossings.</p>
