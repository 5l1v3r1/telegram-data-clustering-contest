      <p>"We have shown restraint ... we have shown patience towards the hostile moves of America, the Zionist regime (Israel) and Saudi Arabia against the Islamic Republic of Iran ... but we will destroy them if they cross our red lines," said Hossein Salami.</p>
      <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned Sunday that Iran was planning "additional attacks" and called on the international community to pressure Iran and to "support Israel when it is acting against this aggression."</p>
      <p>Netanyahu also discussed Iran while on a military tour of Israel's north. Israel works to thwart "deadly weapon transfers from Iran to Syria" and "Iran's attempts to turn Iraq and Yemen into bases for launching rockets and missiles at Israel," he said while touring Mt. Avital, accompanied by Defense Minister Naftali Bennett. </p>
      <p>"We are implementing all the necessary activities in order to prevent Iran's entrenchment in the area," Netanyahu said</p>
      <p>Netanyahu's remarks followed those of U.S. Central Command chief General Kenneth McKenzie  over the weekend, <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/iran/top-u-s-commander-warns-of-another-major-attack-by-iran-in-the-middle-east-1.8167512">who spoke about the probability</a> of a large-scale attack by Iran in the Middle East. “My judgment is that it is very possible they will attack again,” General McKenzie said in an interview ahead of an international security conference on Saturday.</p>

        <b>Iranian protests</b>
      </p>
      <p>Thousands of supporters of Iran's clerical establishment rallied in Tehran on Monday, accusing the United States and Israel of instigating the most violent anti-government protests for a over a decade in the Islamic Republic.</p>
      <p>Thousands of young and working-class Iranians took to the streets on Nov. 15 after gasoline price hikes of at least 50% were announced, voicing outrage at a further squeeze on living costs compounding hardships imposed by renewed U.S. sanctions.</p>
      <p>Protesters quickly expanded their demands to include a removal of leaders seen as unaccountable and corrupt. Violence erupted with at least 100 banks and dozens of buildings torched, the worst disturbances since unrest over alleged election fraud was crushed in 2009, with dozens killed by security forces.</p>
      <p>On Monday, state television carried live footage of demonstrators chanting "Death to America," and "Death to Israel", while marching toward Tehran's Revolution Square to hear a speech by a commander of the elite Revolutionary Guards.</p>
      <p>State television and the foreign ministry had promoted the government-organised rally since Sunday in response to Western statements of support for the fuel price protests.</p>
      <p>"I recommend they (foreign countries) look at the marches today, to see who the real people in Iran are and what they are saying," Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi said.</p>
      <p>The Islamic Republic has accused "thugs" linked to exiles and foreign foes - the United States, Israel and Saudi Arabia - of stirring up the street unrest, during which Amnesty International said around 115 protesters were killed.</p>
      <p>"Death to the dictator. Time for you to step down!" chanted protesters in social media videos posted by Iranians from inside the country. The images could not be verified by Reuters.</p>
