      <h1>The Verge Guide to Black Friday</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T13:07:08+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 13:07</time> by <a rel="author">Cameron Faulkner</a></address>
      <p>If you’re like us, Black Friday is the time of year that you wish never came to an end. Not because of the packed parking lots or the lack of sleep, but solely because it’s when you can get the absolute best deals on tech like big 4K TVs, gaming consoles, phones, laptops, and more.</p>
      <aside>only a fraction of the deals are worth your attention and money</aside>
      <p>Alas, Black Friday is only here for a little while, and since it only makes up just a few short days, you want to make the best of it. That’s where we come in. We’ve been tracking all of the deals that you need to know about from leading retailers like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2019/10/29/20936280/black-friday-walmart-deals-apple-watch-ipad-nintendo-switch-xbox-tvs">Walmart</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2019/11/7/20953208/black-friday-best-buy-deals-tech-gadgets-ipad-surface-laptops-sony-headphones">Best Buy</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2019/10/31/20936195/black-friday-sams-club-deals-sale-membership-4k-tvs-xbox-ipad-apple-watch-vizio">Sam’s Club</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2019/11/22/20974909/black-friday-gamestop-deals-cyber-monday-games-xbox-one-ps4-pro-nintendo-switch-lite">GameStop</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2019/11/6/20951404/black-friday-target-deals-ipad-xbox-one-x-google-nest-gopro">Target</a>, as well as online stores like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2019/11/6/20952250/black-friday-amazon-deals-devices-fire-tv-kindle-tablet-echo-smart-speaker-display">Amazon</a>, Newegg, B&amp;H Photo, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2019/11/4/20943937/black-friday-cyber-monday-microsoft-deals-galaxy-surface-laptops-xbox">Microsoft Store</a>, Samsung, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2019/11/8/20955411/black-friday-google-deals-cyber-monday-pixel-4-3a-xl-nest-hub-wifi-pixelbook">Google Store</a>, and more. There are thousands of deals available to you, but only a fraction of them are worth your attention and money.</p>
      <p>Black Friday officially kicks off at some retailers on Thanksgiving Day, November 28th, and most of them will keep the deals going until the following Monday, December 2nd. Of course, that’s not just any Monday — that’s Cyber Monday, when a whole new slew of deals will begin.</p>
