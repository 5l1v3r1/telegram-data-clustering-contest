        <b>Data miners have leaked all the challenges and the loading screen for Week 8 of Fortnite Chapter 2: Season 1 – called Dive – and there’s a hidden message in the loading screen as part of your challenge set.</b>

      <p>Should tradition being anything to go by, we’re already well over halfway through the first season of Fortnite Chapter 2!</p>
      <p>Going off the same format used in Season 1-10, there should only be two weeks of Season 1 remaining, however, Epic Games have confirmed that the season has been extended to cover the holidays.</p>

      <p>Throughout the first season, players have had to search for a hidden letter in each loading screen as a ‘bonus’ challenge as part of that week’s mission.</p>
      <p>Week 8 looks to be no different, as players will have to complete eight out of the eleven water-themed challenges in order to unlock the loading screen. </p>
      <h3>Leaked week 8 Dive! mission challenges</h3>
      <p>Leaked by <a href="https://twitter.com/Lucas7yoshi">Lucas7yoshii</a>, the challenge set will require players to head over to Lazy Lake and Hydro 16 to complete the swimming trials, alongside completing the usual damage-based tasks. </p>
