      <p><b>154 pounds of 'prohibited bologna' </b>from Mexico was seized by U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents at a Texas border crossing point, according to a zesty CBP news release that's making the news rounds today.</p>
      <p>U.S. Customs and Border Protection said in a news release a man told U.S. agents Thursday at the El Paso border crossing that his pickup truck was hauling a load of frozen turkey ham, made from turkey.</p>
      <p>Agents inspected the load and discovered that it was instead 154 pounds of Mexican bologna, which is made of pork.</p>
      <p>The driver was released by CBP, but the bologna was seized and destroyed by CBP, the agency says.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/local-media-release/cbp-seizes-154-pounds-prohibited-bologna">Here's the full news release</a>.</p>
      <blockquote>CBP Seizes 154 Pounds of Prohibited Bologna<br/>Release Date:<br/>November 22, 2019 <br/><br/>EL PASO, Texas -- U.S. Customs and Border Protection Office of Field Operations Agriculture Specialists working at the El Paso area port of entry seized 14 rolls of Mexican bologna on Thursday morning. Bologna is a prohibited product because it is made from pork and has the potential for introducing foreign animal diseases to the U.S. pork industry.<br/><br/>The seizure was made shortly after 9 a.m. at the Bridge of the Americas international crossing after a Chevrolet pickup with a Texas license plate entered the port from Mexico. A CBP officer performing a primary inspection spotted red rolls behind the rear seat of the truck. The officer asked the driver what he was bringing from Mexico and the driver advised he had frozen rolls of turkey ham.<br/><br/>CBP officers selected the vehicle for a secondary exam during which they located 14 rolls of Mexican bologna behind the rear seat. The weight of the contraband meat was 154 pounds. The meat product was seized and destroyed. The driver was released.<br/><br/>"It is important that travelers understand they should declare all items they are transporting from abroad to avoid fines and penalties. A properly declared prohibited item can be abandoned at the port without consequence," said CBP El Paso Port Director Beverly Good.<br/><br/>BP has been entrusted with enforcing hundreds of laws for 40 other government agencies, such as the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. These agencies require that unsafe items are not allowed to enter the United States. CBP officers are always at ports of entry and assume the responsibility of protecting America from all threats. <br/><br/>While anti-terrorism is the primary mission of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the inspection process at the ports of entry associated with this mission results in impressive numbers of enforcement actions in all categories.<br/><br/>U.S. Customs and Border Protection is the unified border agency within the Department of Homeland Security charged with the management, control and protection of our nation's borders at and between official ports of entry. CBP is charged with securing the borders of the United States while enforcing hundreds of laws and facilitating lawful trade and travel.<br/><br/>Last modified:<br/>November 22, 2019</blockquote>
