      <p>While most of Realme fans are currently excited for the <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/11/25/realme-reveals-coloros-7-and-android-10-update-roadmap/">arrival of ColorOS 7</a>, the company is working hard to deliver the best performance on the current ColorOS 6 branch. Today, the company is rolling out a camera-focused update for the Realme 5 Pro in Europe. That’s the exact same update that reached the 5 Pro units in India last week, now, the European customers are receiving the same treatment.</p>
      <p>Bearing the RMX1971EX_11_A.13 serial, the update brings Nightscape mode for the selfie camera. In addition, it also improves the overall performance of the rear camera setup in darker environments. The clarity of pictures is also improved, and users who have been experiencing red tinting in some pictures will be happy to know that this issue is fixed in this update.</p>

      <p>Moreover, Realme brings additional tweaks to the gaming experience. At least when it comes to the game Arena of Valor. After this update players should notice fewer frame drops while playing the game. The update also reduces power consumption while watching videos. Last but not least, it moves the Realme 5 Pro to November’s 2019 security patch.</p>
      <p>The update is rolling out in a gradual form and should reach eligible devices in the coming day. If you’re an impatient person, you can check the <a href="https://www.realme.com/eu/support/software-update">source link</a> where you will find manual download and instructions.</p>
