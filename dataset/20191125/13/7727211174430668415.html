      <h2>Pep Guardiola has been speaking about Sergio Aguero's injury suffered against Chelsea</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T13:04:33+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 13:04</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/paul-clarke/" target="_blank">Paul Clarke</a></address>
      <p>Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has offered an injury update on star striker Sergio Aguero amid the club's title battle with <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> .</p>
      <p>The Reds' 3-1 win over City earlier this month put Jurgen Klopp's men nine points clear of the two-time reigning champions, a gap they extended briefly after beating Crystal Palace on Saturday.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Man City</a> cut it back to nine thanks to their 2-1 victory over Chelsea shortly after Liverpool's win in the capital but it was a costly success for Pep Guardiola's side.</p>
      <p>Aguero suffered a thigh injury in the clash and Guardiola speculated after the game that the Argentine could be set for some time on the sidelines.</p>
      <p>Now that fact has been confirmed by Guardiola in his pre-match press conference ahead of facing Shakhtar Donetsk in the Champions League tomorrow night.</p>
      <p>"He’ll be out for a few games, a few weeks. Exactly I don’t know," Guardiola told the <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/man-city-news-aguero-live-17309115">MEN</a>.</p>
      <p>"He has a tendon problem in front - will be a few games out.</p>
      <p>"We will miss Sergio. We have had some problems with injuries but we will wait for him and meanwhile we have Gabriel Jesus and Raheem Sterling who can play in that position."</p>
      <p>The blow is a big one for City ahead of a date against Manchester United in the Premier League on December 7 which Guardiola has already ruled Aguero out of, something that would make it at least three league matches without the 31-year-old.</p>
      <p>Guardiola added: "He’ll miss the derby.”</p>
