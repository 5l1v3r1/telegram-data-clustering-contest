      <p>Support for the Tories has slipped in a new election opinion poll released after the party’s official manifesto launch.</p>
      <p>The Survation poll put the prime minister’s party one point down on its previous result, with 41% of respondents saying they would vote Conservative compared with 30% for Labour.</p>
      <p>It means the gap between the top two parties has narrowed by three points according to Survation, who polled voters between November 20 and 23.</p>
      <p>Survation surveyed 1,010 adults by telephone, asking for their voting intention in the poll conducted for Good Morning Britain.</p>
      <p>Labour rose by two points from the company’s first poll one week earlier, with the pro-EU Liberal Democrats up one point at 15% and the Brexit Party unchanged on 5%.</p>
      <p>According to the Britain Elects live tracker, which calculates an average based on data from various polling companies, the Tories still have a comfortable 13 point average lead in the polls.</p>

      <p>A key policy in the Conservative party manifesto – launched by Boris Johnson in Telford on Sunday – has been slammed as ‘deceit’ by Labour.</p>

      <p>The PM has promised to deliver 50,000 more nurses for the NHS but it has been revealed that nearly half of them are already working for the health service.</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson’s recruitment pledge was questioned when it emerged 18,500 of the 50,000 promised jobs are existing nurses who the government hopes to persuade to remain in the workforce.</p>
      <p>The pledge also included hiring 12,500 foreign nurses who will be recruited from abroad to help plug the existing vacancy gap, which currently stands at more than 43,000.</p>
      <p>Labour pointed out only 19,000 posts would actually be filled by brand-new nurse trainees.</p>
      <p>Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: ‘The Conservatives’ claim on nurses is frankly deceitful – the sums simply don’t add up.</p>

      <p>‘First we had Johnson’s fake 40 new hospitals, now we have his fake 50,000 extra nurses.’</p>
      <p>Meanwhile Labour have been criticised for promising to spend vast sums of money while only hiking taxes for the top 5% of earners.</p>
      <p>The party has been criticised by the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies over its promise to compensate Waspi women.</p>
      <p>The pledge did not feature in the party’s manifesto and would have to be paid for by adding to the UK’s £1.8 trillion debt, shadow chancellor John McDonnell revealed on Sunday.</p>
      <p>It takes Labour’s annual spending splurge to more than £97 billion and means their manifesto promises spending £32 for every £1 extra spent by the Tories.</p>
      <p>Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today Programme, Paul Johnson said the policy’s estimated cost is ‘a very, very large sum of money indeed’.</p>
