      <h1>'It's what we asked for!' Former referee stands firm on VAR after Man City vs Chelsea decisions</h1>
      <h2>The VAR decision in Man City's win over Chelsea have been analysed</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T13:30:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 13:30</time> by <a rel="author">Paul Clarke</a></address>
      <p>Former Premier League referee Dermot Gallagher has offered his view on the key decisions in the game between Manchester City and Chelsea on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Chelsea led in the first half thanks to N'Golo Kante's goal but Kevin de Bruyne soon hit back for the hosts, before Riyad Mahrez put City in front before the break.</p>
      <p>But there was a fair bit of controversy in the game as City had a goal disallowed which chalked off an effort by Raheem Sterling.</p>
      <p>Sterling was adjudged to be offside, something which led to criticism aplenty for the marginal nature of the decision.</p>
      <p>Gallagher, however, has given a strong frank and honest response to the decision in his regular appearance on Ref Watch on Sky Sports.</p>
      <p>"It's so close but when you see that, offside is offside. You see the lines," Gallagher told Sky Sports. "It's the VAR we asked for.</p>
      <p>"That's how difficult it is for the guy on the day."</p>

      <p>There was also a moment in the game when Fikayo Tomori looked to have brought down Sergio Aguero in the penalty box but Gallagher again insisted that the no penalty decision was correct.</p>
      <p>"I don't think even Sergio Aguero thinks it's a penalty," Gallagher added. "Players are entitled to use their body to protect themselves."</p>
