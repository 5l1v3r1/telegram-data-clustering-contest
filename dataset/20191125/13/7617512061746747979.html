      <h1>Fundraising page started for Sidney family that lost everything in fire</h1>

      <p>A fundraiser has been started for a Sidney family whose house was extensively damaged in a Saturday evening fire.</p>
      <p>Janine Taverner and five-year-old daughter Georgia were at home at the time of the fire, but escaped without injury. Janine’s husband, Bob, arrived minutes later.</p>
      <p>“You never expect what you hear on the news could happen to you,” says a message posted on the Taverner Fire Fund webpage.</p>
      <p>“This GoFundMe page has been set up to help get this wonderful family [started] from scratch, cover any wage loss and ensure Christmas can be celebrated.”</p>
      <p>Bob works as a long-haul truck driver and Janine is a stay-at-home mom who runs her own illustration business.</p>
      <p>Sidney firefighters could see the blaze from the fire hall, the page said.</p>
      <p>“By the time they arrived and were able to contain the fire it was quickly determined that anything that wasn’t burnt was either ruined by water damage or smoke damage.”</p>
      <p>The blaze started just before 4 p.m. in the home on Beacon Avenue West, said fire chief Brett Mikkelsen of the Sidney Volunteer Fire Department.</p>
      <p>Crews arrived to find large flames coming from the garage area of the one-storey home.</p>
      <p>Firefighters extinguished most of the fire from the outside, before entering to put out flames in the attic.</p>
      <p>They rescued a hamster, and retrieved passports and Christmas gifts.</p>
      <p>The fundraising page is online at gofundme.com/f/taverner-fire-fun.</p>
