      <p>The Metro Vancouver weather forecast calls for some decidedly chilly temperatures this week as the nights are expected to be completely clear.</p>
      <p>A cold weather system is moving into the Lower Mainland, which Matt MacDonald, a meteorologist from Environment Canada, said is bringing “cold maritime air streaming down from Alaska.”</p>
      <p>Starting on Monday, Nov. 25, Environment Canada calls for sunshine and a high of 7°C during the day. Following this, the evening is expected to be mainly cloudy with a low of 2°C.  Tuesday’s forecast calls for a chance of showers during the day, but the evening is expected to be clear with a low of 0°C.</p>
      <p>Wednesday through Sunday are expected to be sunny and bright, and, as a result, the evening will be clear. Since cloud coverage tends to keep temperatures warmer, the daily lows will be increasingly chilly as the week progresses. Wednesday will reach a low of -1°C, but by Friday, temperatures are expected to dip down to a frigid -6°C.</p>

      <p>Back in September, The Weather Network predicted that British Columbia <a href="https://www.vancouverisawesome.com/2019/09/16/vancouver-weather-network-bc-fall/">would have a milder winter, but that December was a “wild card.”</a></p>
      <p>Since then, <a href="https://www.vancouverisawesome.com/2019/11/18/vancouver-weather-winter-forecast-bc/">the winter forecast has been updated</a> to include the most recent prediction, which calls for milder temperatures along the B.C. coast and across much of Northern B.C. While northeastern B.C. to the southern interior will see near normal temperatures.</p>
      <p>While the north coast region is, “expected to see above average rainfall and alpine snow,” the south coast region is expected to be drier than normal. With this in mind, the forecast adds that this dry pattern may break at times during the season. During these breaks, the Lower Mainland could have the, “potential to see several weeks’ worth of precipitation in just 5 to 10 days.”</p>
