      <h1>Juventus remain keen on Chelsea defender Emerson Palmieri?</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/chelsea/"><b>Chelsea</b></a> defender <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/emerson-palmieri/"><b>Emerson Palmieri</b></a> has reportedly remained as a transfer target for <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/juventus/"><b>Juventus</b></a>.</h2>

      <p>While the left-back has found himself in and out of the starting lineup during his time at Stamford Bridge, the Italy international is currently regarded as first choice by manager <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/frank-lampard/"><b>Frank Lampard</b></a>.</p>
      <p>However, despite the 25-year-old still having over two-and-a-half years remaining on his contract, <i>Corriere dello Sport</i> claims that Juventus are still making a play for the former Roma man.</p>
      <p>Having worked with the player during his time at Chelsea, Maurizio Sarri wants Palmieri to provide competition for <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/alex-sandro/"><b>Alex Sandro</b></a>.</p>
      <p>Regardless of whether the Blues hierarchy are successful during contract negotiations with Palmieri, they are unlikely to consider any offers in January.</p>
      <p>The full-back has made eight starts in the Premier League this season.</p>
