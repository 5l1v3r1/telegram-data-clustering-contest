      <p>A stray dog was found by the side of the road keeping a family of abandoned kittens warm.</p>
      <p>The dog, since named Serenity by shelter workers, was discovered guarding the five baby cats by the side of a road in Ontario, Canada, last week. It is unclear whether the kittens were dumped by their owner, or abandoned by a feral mother cat.</p>
      <p>Pet and Wildlife Rescue wrote on Facebook: ‘I have been getting A LOT of attention on social media, but let me fill you in just in case you don’t know my name and my story!</p>
      <p>‘My name is Serenity and I was found last week on the side of the road keeping 5 kittens warm.</p>
      <p>‘A good citizen called the shelter, a kind Animal Control Officer picked the 6 of us up and we’ve been living our best lives ever since!’</p>

      <p>A shelter spokesman said the kittens Serenity rescued are currently in a foster home, and will be put up for adoption as soon as they are old enough.</p>

      <p>They have said that while they would like to offer the dog and kittens together, doing so would mean Serenity has to wait several months to find her forever home.</p>
      <p>Serenity’s good deed has also seen the shelter flooded with offers from prospective new owners keen to rescue the dog.</p>
      <p>The shelter said she is ‘obviously great with cats’ and would happily live in a home with kitties.</p>
      <p>Serenity, who is believed to be around two years old, also loves playing outside, but is a little too boisterous to live with children, or other dogs with dominant personalities.</p>
