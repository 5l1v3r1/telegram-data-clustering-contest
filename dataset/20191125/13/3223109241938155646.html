      <h1>Tesla Cybertruck Already Has More Than 200K Pre-Orders</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T13:16:09+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 13:16</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.geek.com/author/stephanie_m/" target="_blank">Stephanie Mlot</a></address>
      <p>Tesla fans are nothing is not loyal.</p>
      <p>Four days after its <a href="https://www.geek.com/tech/elon-musk-unveils-teslas-futuristic-cybertruck-1811532/">unveiling</a>, the Cybertruck has racked up more than 200,000 pre-orders.</p>
      <p>Applications are coming in hot: The <a href="https://www.geek.com/tech/tesla-teases-customizable-horn-movement-sounds-1806499/">automaker</a> on Saturday reported a whopping 146,000 requests for its electric pickup—a majority opting for the middle- and top-tier models.</p>
      <p>That number quickly rose to 187,000—”with no advertising [and] paid endorsement,” CEO Elon Musk pointed out—before <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1198344195317985280">hitting the 200K mark</a> this morning.</p>

      <p>Each pre-order requires a $100 (refundable) deposit, which means <a href="https://www.geek.com/tech/officer-forced-to-abandon-pursuit-as-tesla-patrol-car-runs-out-of-juice-1805339/">Tesla</a> just banked a cool $20 million in less than a week.</p>
      <p>Musk on Thursday revealed Tesla’s first—and, fingers crossed, only—pickup truck.</p>
      <p>The Cybertruck looks like a 1970s concept of the future, with its wedge-shaped design, stainless-steel skin, “unbreakable” glass, and companion ATV.</p>
      <p>Standing 231.7 inches long, 79.8 inches wide, and 75 inches tall (at its pointiest), the vehicle falls in line with basically every other pickup on the market.</p>
      <p>But unlike every other pickup on the market, Tesla’s truck has polarized the Internet:</p>

      <p>Nearly half of all reported bookings (so far) are for either the $49,900 dual-motor option (300-mile range, 7,500-pound towing capacity) or $69,900 tri-motor version (500-mile range, 14,000-pound towing capacity).</p>
      <p>Fewer than 20 percent chose the single-motor Cybertruck, which starts at $39,900.</p>
      <p>Production on the single- and dual-motor <a href="https://www.geek.com/tech/software-engineer-embedded-tesla-model-3-key-fob-in-arm-1799750/">models</a> won’t begin until “late 2021,” with the $70,000 pickup expected to roll out a year later.</p>
      <p>Thursday’s bungled unveiling with be Tesla’s last “for a while,” <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1198723473708699648">Musk tweeted</a>, teasing “some (mostly) unexpected technology announcements” in 2020.</p>
      <p>After all, the manufacturer still has some kinks to work out.</p>
      <p>Last week’s event went from slightly uncomfortable to positively cringeworthy when lead designer Franz von Holzhausen attempted to demonstrate the strength of Tesla’s “Armor Glass” by throwing a baseball-sized metal ball at the driver-side window.</p>
      <p>“Oh my f***ing God,” Musk can be heard muttering. “Well, maybe that was a little too hard.”</p>
      <p>If at first you don’t succeed, try, try again—on the rear passenger window.</p>
      <p>“It didn’t go through,” the entrepreneur, always looking on the bright side, said of the second failed attempt. “Room for improvement.”</p>
