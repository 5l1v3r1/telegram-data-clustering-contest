      <p>Deputy Health Minister Yakov Litzman (UTJ) sharply criticized the public Sabbath desecration in various cities in Israel.</p>
      <p>"This trend of Sabbath desecration in different cities is a gross act of defiance used by unashamed politicians who do not hesitate to harm the State's Jewish character," he said.</p>
      <p>"It's clear that we will not allow this serious trend to expand, because this is a systematic change to everything that has been preserved in the Jewish character throughout the years."</p>
      <p>On Twitter, Blue and White's MK Yair Lapid shot back, "No one appointed you, sir, to determine what the Jewish character of the State of Israel is."</p>
      <p>Last week, public transportation ran on Shabbat (the Sabbath) in Tel Aviv, Givatayim, Kiryat Ono and Ramat Hasharon. Additional cities <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/272201">are expected to join the initiative</a> soon.</p>
