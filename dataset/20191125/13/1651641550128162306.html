      <p>Apple reportedly expects an increase in iPhones, a per a new report from DigiTimes. The firm has reportedly told its partners to expect a sharp uptick in iPhone sales, with the 12 predicted to drive sales over the 100 million mark to the probable delight of everyone involved.</p>
      <p>The iPhone 12 is reportedly going to be one of the first iPhones to ditch the controversial notch with made its entry two years ago with the iPhone X. It is also said to adopt an iPhone 4 like design, and ship with new camera updates, iOS 14 and 5G support.</p>
      <p>While the iPhone hasn’t yet debuted with 5G yet, devices from other OEMs like Samsung, OnePlus and Huawei are setting the stage for Apple’s eventual adoption of the standard. By the time the firm rolls in, it likely expects that these other devices would have helped carriers and consumers alike adapt to the reality of 5G. The report anticipates that the 5G iPhone is going to be what fuels consumer interest over the iPhone 11 which is expected to sell well, but not that well.</p>
      <p>As always, the iPhone 12 is coming next September, so a lot could change between now and then.</p>
