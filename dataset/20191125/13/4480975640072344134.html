      <h1>GBP/JPY Technical Analysis: Set-up seems tilted in favour of bullish traders</h1>

          <b>Regains traction and reverses the previous session’s dip to over 1-month lows.</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Any meaningful fall towards 200-day might still be seen as a buying opportunity.</b>

      <p>The GBP/JPY cross stalled its recent pullback from multi-month tops, levels just above mid-141.00s, and managed to regain some positive traction on the first day of a new trading week.</p>
      <p>The positive move helped the cross to reverse the previous session's downfall to near one-month lows and reclaim the key 140.00 psychological mark, albeit lacked any strong follow-through.</p>
      <p>Looking at the technical picture, the cross remains well within its recent consolidative trading range held since mid-October, around the 61.8% <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/support-resistance/fibonacci">Fibonacci</a> level of the 148.88-126.54 downfall.</p>
      <p>Given that the cross has been consolidating above the very important 200-day SMA, the near-term set-up seems tilted in favour of bullish traders and support prospects for additional gains.</p>
      <p>Moreover, technical <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/indicators">indicators</a> on the daily <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/chart">chart</a> have managed to hold in the positive territory and further reinforce the near-term constructive outlook amid the UK political optimism.</p>
      <p>Hence, any meaningful dips below the 139.00 handle might still be seen as buying opportunity, though bulls are likely to wait for a sustained move beyond mid-141.00s (recent swing highs).</p>
