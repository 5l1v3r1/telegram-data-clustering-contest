      <p>The fire was first reported on Thursday at 3 a.m. in the Shining Rock Wilderness area in Pisgah National Forest, and as many as 30 firefighters have worked to contain the fire since then, officials said.</p>
      <p>The forest service posted video footage Thursday that showed orange flames and white smoke rising from the mountain’s ridge. Aerial footage from a day later continued to show flames dotting the mountain and heavy, billowing smoke.</p>

      <p>Forest Service officials haven’t released details on what might have caused the fire or where it started. Firefighters have remained on the scene to monitor the conditions, officials said.</p>
      <p>The Shining Rock Wilderness area, along with its 53 miles of trails, has remained closed due to the fire, the forest service said.</p>

      <p>The mountain was featured in Charles Frazier’s best-selling book “Cold Mountain,” which tells the story of a Confederate soldier’s journey through western North Carolina to reunite with the woman he loves. The book was later adapted into a 2003 movie starring <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/internet-explodes-over-photos-of-jude-law-in-tighty-whities-for-filming-in-the-new-pope">Jude Law</a>, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/nicole-kidman">Nicole Kidman</a> and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/renee-zellweger-humiliating-tabloids-breakup">Renee Zellweger</a>, who won an Oscar for best supporting actress.</p>
      <p>Many of the movie’s scenes, however, were actually shot in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/europe">Romania</a>, according to <a href="https://www.romanticasheville.com/coldmountain.htm">Romantic Asheville</a>.</p>
