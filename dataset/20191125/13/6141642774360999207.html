      <p>Jose Mourinho returns to the Champions League on Tuesday as his first home game in charge of Tottenham is a group game with Olympiacos.</p>
      <p>Mourinho is well-versed to European glory nights, having won the competition twice, as well as a Europa League and a UEFA Cup.</p>
      <p>Here, the PA news agency takes a look at five memorable Champions League matches for the 56-year-old.</p>
      <h3>Introducing Jose Mourinho</h3>

      <p>Having followed up the win at Chelsea with another slaying of Barcelona in the semi-finals, Mourinho was able to complete the fairytale at the Bernabeu, a place he would go on to call his home a couple of months later after joining Real Madrid. A goal in each half from Diego Milito against Bayern Munich gave the Italians a first European Cup success in 45 years and an historic treble. It also confirmed Mourinho as one of the elite managers in the game.</p>
      <h3>Incensing the locals in Turin</h3>

      <p>This was a game that was more memorable for Mourinho’s actions at full-time, even though it was a fine win for Manchester United at Juventus. United’s group stage looked in trouble after falling behind to Cristiano Ronaldo’s first-half goal, but the Red Devils turned it around in the final five minutes. Juan Mata levelled and then, with one minute of normal time remaining, a Leonardo Bonucci own goal the visitors the win. It also provided Mourinho with the power to gloat as, after being abused for much of the game, he walked around the Allianz Stadium cupping his ear towards the crowd.</p>
