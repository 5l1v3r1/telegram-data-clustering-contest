      <h1>Marcelo Bielsa delivers verdict on January window that will encourage Leeds fans</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T13:47:10+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 13:47</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/will-butcher/" target="_blank">Will Butcher</a></address>
      <p>Marcelo Bielsa has told his pre-Reading press conference – <a href="https://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/sport/football/leeds-united/latest-leeds-united-news/marcelo-bielsa-press-conference-recap-leeds-united-head-coach-reading-expected-goals-and-transfer-window-1321375">as per the Yorkshire Evening Post</a> – that Victor Orta is “working” on plans for the January transfer window as Leeds United continue to push for promotion to the Premier League.</p>
      <p>The Whites currently sit in second place after three league wins in a row over Queens Park Rangers, Blackburn Rovers and Luton Town. The Whites needed a last-minute goal from Patrick Bamford to seal all three points.</p>
      <p>Bielsa’s men now travel to the Madjeski to take on Reading, a side they dismantled 3-0 away from home in a midweek clash last season. Reading are struggling this season too, sitting in 18th place with just five league wins all season.</p>
      <p>Leeds will be expected to make it four in a row but Bielsa was asked about the January window, which is almost only a month away. The Argentine manager responded by stating that director of football Orta is working on it.</p>
      <p>“Victor Orta is working on that,”<a href="https://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/sport/football/leeds-united/latest-leeds-united-news/marcelo-bielsa-press-conference-recap-leeds-united-head-coach-reading-expected-goals-and-transfer-window-1321375"> Bielsa said.</a> “I am sure Victor and his group are prepared to bring solutions to us. It has always been that way. They will bring us one option for one problem, they always make good recommendations. If any needs appear, they have possible solutions.”</p>

      <h3>TBR’s view – So Leeds need any so-called ‘solutions’ in January?</h3>
      <p>The feeling among the Leeds fans is that there is a lot more cover in Bielsa’s squad this season, than there was during 2018-19. The Whites have been a lot luckier with injury, too, this time around.</p>
      <p>If any new players are needed, it is probably if a player leaves. A new centre-back could be eyed as cover for Ben White and Liam Cooper – especially with Gaetano Berardi’s contract expiring in the summer.</p>
      <p>Eddie Nketiah and Jack Clarke’s loan deals could both be cancelled by their parent clubs but it remains to be seen. If they are, then replacements will be needed – especially for Nketiah.</p>
