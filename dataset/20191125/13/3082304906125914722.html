        <b>Gareth Bale’s display against Real Sociedad proves he is prepared to give his all for Real Madrid, according to Thibaut Courtois.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Thibaut Courtois has no doubt that Gareth Bale is committed to Real Madrid following the Wales star’s controversial return to LaLiga action on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Bale was introduced as a second-half substitute in the 3-1 win over Real Sociedad and was greeted by a mixture of boos and applause from the Santiago Bernabeu faithful.</p>
      <p>It marked Bale’s first appearance for Madrid since October and came at the end of a week in which he celebrated Wales’ Euro 2020 qualification behind a banner that read: “WALES. GOLF. MADRID…IN THAT ORDER”.</p>
      <p>The slogan originates from a chant by Wales supporters that pokes fun at perceptions of Bale among the Spanish press, who have accused the former Tottenham player of pushing Madrid down his list of priorities.</p>
      <p>Courtois would not be drawn on whether he believes the reception that greeted Bale was harsh, but is confident the 30-year-old remains committed to playing for the Spanish giants.</p>
      <p>Speaking at a media conference ahead of Tuesday’s Champions League clash with Paris Saint-Germain, the Belgium international said: “You love your country and that comes before where you are playing, but he is involved every day and is a professional.</p>

      <p>“He was very involved when he came on and generated a lot of danger. [Luka] Modric’s goal came from a cross of his. If he wasn’t committed, he wouldn’t play like that.</p>
      <p>“We are here to win games. What has happened, has happened. He gives everything in training and matches to help us win. The Bernabeu has its opinion and I am not in a position to comment on that.”</p>
      <p>Madrid suffered a humbling 3-0 defeat to PSG in their opening Group A game in September, but Courtois insists Los Blancos will not have revenge on their minds during Tuesday’s fixture.</p>
      <p>“I wouldn’t say revenge,” he added. “The match helped us to learn. We have improved a lot lately and we will see where we are.</p>
      <p>“We have to be strong and not make mistakes. It will be a great game from the first second until the last.”</p>
