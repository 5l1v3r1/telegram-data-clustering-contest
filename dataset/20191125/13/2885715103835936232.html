      <p>Owner of two pet dogs, industrialist Ratan Tata has often been vocal about his love for animals. While last year he won hearts after dedicating a part of his Mumbai residence to street dogs, recently his attempt to find a home for an abandoned dog has left netizens emotional.</p>
      <p>Requesting people to find a home for a 9-month old abandoned Labrador, Ratan Tata wrote, “Of all the different sufferings that animals today have to go through, my heart truly breaks for the ones that get abandoned by families.”</p>
      <p>“I cannot imagine what must go through their minds when one day they have a home, and the next they don’t. The kindness in 9-month-old Myra’s eyes still stays after being abandoned, and I could really use your help in finding her a family,” Tata further said while empathising the pain the animal must be feeling after being left alone.</p>
