      <h1>Justin Bieber Has Bubblegum Pink Hair Now</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T13:45:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 13:45</time> by <a rel="author">Alyssa Bailey</a></address>
      <p>Justin Bieber was over having dirty blond hair, so he decided to go bubblegum pink for Thanksgiving. Why not? The singer was photographed out in Los Angeles with the new hue yesterday, and wore matching dark pink Drew House pants. This is the Biebs' most dramatic hair change since he <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a24455567/justin-bieber-buzzed-all-his-long-luscious-hair-off/">got a buzz cut</a> last year after growing his hair as long as possible.</p>

      <p>Bieber's hair change yesterday came amid rumors he could be making a surprise appearance at last night's American Music Awards. There was chatter on Twitter that he would join Dan + Shay on stage to <a href="https://twitter.com/yourbiebernews/status/1196892018766536704">perform their song "10,000 Hours."</a> He also would've been in the same room as his ex-girlfriend Selena Gomez on the night she <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/music/a29803298/selena-gomez-amas-performance-2019/">performed her two new songs</a>, believed to be about their breakup, live on stage. But the Biebs ultimately did not attend. His wife Hailey Baldwin <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a29933140/hailey-baldwin-selena-gomez-amas-photo-like/">did show her support of Gomez</a> on Instagram when she liked a photo Gomez's makeup artist shared of the singer's AMAs performance look.</p>
      <p>A source told <i><a href="https://people.com/music/justin-bieber-super-excited-about-new-music-album-source/">People</a> </i>on November 14 that Bieber is working on new music and is preparing to tour again. “A new album will be released very soon. Hopefully in time for the holidays,” the source said. “Justin is also preparing for a tour next year. He is in intense dance rehearsal.”</p>
      <p>The Biebs is hyped for his new music. “He can’t wait to share it all with fans,” the source said. His wife Baldwin “is, of course, supportive and plans on touring with Justin. It’s all very exciting.”</p>
