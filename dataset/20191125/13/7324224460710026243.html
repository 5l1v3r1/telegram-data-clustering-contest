      <p>The Black Country side put in one of their most balanced performances of the season in Staffordshire, with six of their eight players notching in double figures to help secure the comfortable victory.</p>
      <p>West Brom set their stall out early on in the clash, quickly opening up a 10-4 lead after just four minutes before growing their lead to nine by the end of the quarter.</p>
      <p>With the visitors rolling, Stafford struggled to handle West Brom's stingy defence, with top scorer Stefan Artzrouni triggering a 22-4 midway through the period, effectively ending the game as a contest.</p>
      <p>Leading 51-24 at the half, it was a simple matter of remaining professional for West Brom - and they maintained their quality through the third quarter, as they continued to rack up the points to further stretch their lead.</p>
      <p>The final quarter proved little more than a formality, as West Brom cruised to the 87-55 win to ensure their journey back to the Black Country was a happy one.</p>
      <p>West Brom Men's Basketball B team captain Liam Sheridan was delighted to notch such a commanding result.</p>
      <p>"It was great to pick up our third straight win." he said.</p>
      <p>"Seeing Ziggy [Cameron] return to the court after injury and the addition of Demarnay [Graham] will be big for us.</p>
      <p>"Despite the comfortable win I think we can still take things up a notch, so we will work on making a few adjustments before our next game.</p>
      <p>"Most of our away games in this league require travelling to places like Stoke and Stafford, so it's important that we travel well and perform on the road, if we can do that I think we could compete for the title this season."</p>
      <p>West Brom's B team next face third-placed Walsall 99ers on Sunday November 24 at West Brom Leisure Centre - tip-off is scheduled for 6pm.</p>
