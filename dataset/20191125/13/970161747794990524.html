      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/prince-charles/">Prince Charles</a> won applause from crowds in the Solomon Islands after addressing guests <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/25/prince-charles-speaks-pidgin-solomon-islands-visit-11212923/">with a speech conducted in pidgin English.</a></p>
      <p>Charles, who has also visited India <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/prince-charles-camilla-touch-noses-maori-group-new-zealand-11179730/">and New Zealand on his tour,</a> was presented with a chupu – a traditional offering involving a live pig tied up – when he arrived at the Lawson Tama in Honiara, before delivering his speech which spoke of the importance of the environment and his welcome there.</p>
      <p>His use of the language was met with laughter and applause – but just what is pidgin English and where is it spoken?</p>
      <p>Here’s what you need to know…</p>
      <h3>What is pidgin as spoken by Prince Charles in the Solomon Islands?</h3>
      <p>A pidgin language is a grammatically simplified means of communication which develops between two or more groups who do not share a common language.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>It is often used in situations where vocabulary and grammar are limited and often drawn from several other languages.</p>

      <p>The word is taken from a Chinese pronunciation of the word ‘business’, and it used to refer originally to Chinese pidgin English – but has since been generalised to refer to any form of pidgin.</p>
      <p>Some pidgins may start out as ‘trade languages’ – such as Tok Pisin, spoken in Papua New Guinea – and eventually evolve into actual languages in their own right, with Swahiliu being an example of this.</p>

      <p>The official language of the Solomon Islands is English – used in government and local media – but it is only spoken by around two per cent of the population.</p>
      <p>Instead, the local form of pidgin – the lingua franca – is more widely spoken on the island, with the language closely related to Tok Pisin and Bislama, a creole language spoken in nearby Vanuatu.</p>
      <p>In total between 60 and 70 different languages are spoken in the Solomon Islands archipelago, as opposed to the nation state.</p>
      <p>Prince Charles speech was a hit with the crowds, as he spoke about the Queen and Prince Philip, telling them: Queen blong yumi and Duke blong Edinburgh telling me such a good memories blong time algeter visitin this islands.’</p>
