      <p>The Vernon Fire Department has been growing moustaches to raise money and awareness for men's health through the Movember campaign. This is the last week in November, which means they are in the final push for fundraising.</p>
      <p>"We haven't done Movember the past few years since it seemed like there was a bit of tailing off happening," says Vernon firefighter John Doorman. "But this is the first year we've been doing it through the fire department and City Hall simultaneously."</p>
      <p>The fire department, as of the publication of this article, has raised $620 for men's health, which is a good number for the size of the department.</p>
      <p>"I've looked up what bigger departments are doing, and our donation total per capita is quite a bit higher," says Doorman. "Our donation totals are stacking up quite well compared to the rest of the country considering our size."</p>
      <p>The campaign has also boosted morale throughout the fire hall, with some playful jabs being thrown around between firefighters.</p>
      <p>"There's always fire hall banter no matter what you're doing, nothing is sacred," laughs Doorman. "There's definitely some moustache envy from some people, but they're definitely going to hold out in the end."</p>
      <p>There is still time to donate to the fire department's Movember campaign, you can go online to make your contribution <a href="https://ca.movember.com/mospace/14036807?utm_medium=share&amp;utm_source=dynamic&amp;utm_campaign=copy-clipboard#">here</a>.</p>
