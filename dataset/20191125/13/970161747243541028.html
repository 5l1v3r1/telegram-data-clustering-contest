      <p>When you are suffering with a cold, you’ll do anything to get relief – including spending a fortune on over the counter remedies.</p>
      <p>But save your pennies because shoppers say this new candle from discount retailer B&amp;M has been helping their sniffles.</p>
      <p>It’s based on the smell of Vicks VapoRub and it costs just 59p.</p>
      <p>It’s not made by the same company but rather by a brand called Vapowax and is described as a Vapor Candle, but people have compared it to the original minty ointment.</p>
      <p>One eagle-eyed shopper spotted the quirky candle in-store, and quickly shared the news on Facebook group, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/ExtremeCouponingAndBargainsUK/permalink/892928484453784/">Extreme Couponing and Bargaining UK.</a></p>
      <p>They wrote: ‘I don’t know if I’m the only one who didn’t know this was a thing? Like Vicks vapour but as a candle – 59p at B&amp;M. Perfect for this time of year with all the coughs and colds going about. If it doesn’t help, at least my house smells nice.’</p>

      <p>The post had over 3,000 likes and over 1,500 comments.</p>
      <p>People were excited to try it and some said that it has already been a help to them.</p>
      <p>One user said ‘Both my children have had a horrible cold these last few weeks so I have had the candle lit for about an hour before they went to bed and shut the door and when I have put them to bed blown it out and the vapour smell still fills the room through the night.’</p>
