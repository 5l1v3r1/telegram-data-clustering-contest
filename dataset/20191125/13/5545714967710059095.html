      <p>I've burned through too many PlayStation 4 controllers over the years to be paying full price for replacements. What can I say? We get <i>really</i> into co-op over here.

        <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/DualShock-Wireless-Controller-PlayStation-Magma-4/dp/B07FQ74V4Z/?th=1">Crystal</a> (my personal favorite â€“ it's translucent)</li>

        </li>
        <li>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>You don't even need to leave the house, which is great, because it's officially Too Cold outside.</p>
      <p>I was torn between getting either a Glacier White, Magma Red, or Titanium Blue controller, and my gut told me to go with the latter option. I'm expecting buyer's remorse to kick in any second now.</p>

      <p><b>Disclosure-bot:</b> Just in case the editor neglected to mention it, we have zero control when deals start and end. Deals can sometimes be gone within minutes (please don't shoot the messenger). Trying deal links even hours after this article's time stamp may lead to self-punching, so maybe bookmark our <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/index-huge.phtml?t=deals">video game deals</a> if you're on the hunt. Also, it goes without saying, but some shopping links do directly support the author. If you've spotted any inaccuracy please let us know asap.</p>
