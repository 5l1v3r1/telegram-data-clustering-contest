      <h2>The band's latest single 'The Last Time' has proved very popular</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T13:01:19+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 13:01</time> by <a rel="author">Robin Murray</a></address>
      <p>The Script are playing an intimate gig in Bristol - just months before embarking on a huge arena tour.</p>
      <p>The Dublin rockers will perform at SWX this Wednesday (November 27) to mark the release of their new album, <i>Sunsets &amp; Full Moons</i>.</p>
      <p>Hosted by record shop Rough Trade, the event will see the three-piece play a stripped-back set to a crowd of around 1,000 people - far smaller than the venues they will play throughout February and March 2020, including Manchester Arena and the O2 Arena in London.</p>
      <p>The Script rose to fame following the release of their eponymous debut album in 2008, which included hit singles <i>The Man Who Can't Be Moved</i> and <i>Breakeven</i>.</p>

      <p>In total they have four number one albums, six billion streams, 30 million single sales and 10.8 million album sales.</p>
      <p>And the release of their aforementioned sixth album finds them back at the top of their game.</p>
      <p>Its lead single <i>The Last Time</i> has already soared over 16 million streams and its profile has been assisted by an appearance on BBC Breakfast, a performance on The Jonathan Ross Show and extensive radio support.</p>
      <p>A Rough Trade spokesperson said: "Sunsets &amp; Full Moons sees the band embracing the unifying power of music’s biggest traits - killer hooks, insistent melodies and stirring sentiments.</p>
      <p>"It could be seen as a sequel to their much-loved debut album, as both emerged from emotionally turbulent times: frontman Danny O’Donoghue lost his father around the time of the release of their debut and ten years later, he lost his mother as they worked on this album.</p>
      <p>"Naturally the songs began to reflect the band’s own experiences - and those are themes sure to resonate with their fans, too. Yet hope is its overriding theme."</p>
