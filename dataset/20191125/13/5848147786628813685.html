      <h1>PM pumps $537m into improving aged care</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T13:24:24+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 13:24</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/author/daniel-mcculloch/" target="_blank">Daniel McCulloch</a></address>
      <p>Scott Morrison has committed more than $500 million towards fixing problems in aged care, weeks after a royal commission investigating the scandal-prone sector released a damning interim report.</p>
      <p>The Prime Minister has promised $537 million to increase home care packages, reduce the use of chemical restraints and get younger people out of residential aged care.</p>
      <p>“We can and must do better in providing improved support for our older Australians,” Mr Morrison said on Monday.</p>
      <p>“Like every Australian, we were appalled by <a href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/national/2019/10/31/aged-care-royal-commission-interim-report-system-failing/">the revelations of the interim report</a>, however we will do everything we can to build an aged care system of the highest quality.”</p>
      <p>His three-pronged plan hinges on increasing the number of home care packages by 10,000 places.</p>
      <p>It also involves providing better medication management and dementia training for nursing home staff, and introducing new targets to remove younger people with disabilities from residential facilities.</p>
      <p>“I want to stress again that what we really need to establish above and beyond everything else is a culture of respect for older Australians,” Mr Morrison said.</p>
      <p>The additional 10,000 home care packages will be rolled out from next month, with a particular focus on those with higher levels of need.</p>
      <p>From the start of next year, there will be much stronger restrictions placed on the use of anti-psychotic medicines.</p>
      <p>A timeline has also been set for removing younger Australians from aged care:</p>
      <p>* Nobody under the age of 65 entering residential aged care by 2022;</p>
      <p>* Nobody under the age of 45 living in residential aged care by 2022; and</p>
      <p>* Nobody under the age of 65 living in residential aged care by 2025.</p>
