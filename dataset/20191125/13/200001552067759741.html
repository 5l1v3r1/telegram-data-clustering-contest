      <h1>Club go on ‘English mission’ to sign Leicester City player – Probably get a shock</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T13:33:48+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 13:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/author/annie/" target="_blank">Sport Witness Team</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.lanazione.it/firenze/sport/calcio/mercato-fiorentina-praet-leicester-1.4902820">La Nazione</a> is a Florence based newspaper, so when it comes to Fiorentina they’re the local media to take notice of.</p>
      <p>However, they have some strange claims on the club’s pursuit of Dennis Praet. It’s reported that on Friday, Viola officials travelled to London for an ‘English mission’, with the Belgian footballer being a player they want to sign.</p>
      <p>It’s reported Fiorentina would look to loan the player and then potentially sign him on a permanent deal next summer. Here comes the problem: They think Sampdoria still own him and he’s only on loan at Leicester.</p>
      <p>Praet is said to have spoken to Sampdoria about ending his Foxes loan because of a lack of playing time.</p>
      <p>A quick Google brings up the Premier League club’s press release from when they signed the player, and it couldn’t be clearer: <a href="https://www.lcfc.com/news/1303660/dennis-praet-signs-for-leicester-city-on-permanent-deal/press-release">‘Dennis Praet Signs For Leicester City On Permanent Deal’</a></p>
      <p>That would throw the whole story into a confusing mess. If Fiorentina do want to loan the player then they’re going to have to deal with Leicester, which will almost certainly be more expensive and throw doubt on their hopes.</p>
      <p>Praet has 310 Premier League minutes so far this season, and a further 217 in the EFL Cup, so the 25 year old is certainly a used member of Brendan Rodgers’ squad.</p>
      <p>It’ll be interesting to see what comes next from the Florence end on these claims.</p>
