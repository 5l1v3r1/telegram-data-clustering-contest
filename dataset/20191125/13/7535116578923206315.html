      <p>Well, eight months and 60,000 job applicants later, it seems like Lepre finally has found his ideal PA. On 28th October, <a href="https://www.ladbible.com/news/news-instagram-model-lands-coolest-job-and-travels-the-world-with-a-milli-20191028">LADBible</a> announced that 27-year-old Tyanna De Assis landed the dream job!</p>
      <p>Despite titling her application, ‘Most entertaining PA you will ever have”, the 27-year-old still admitted that she was stunned to receive the news that she had been picked.</p>
      <p>“It’s crazy, even my family and friends wonder how I got it – but they said it’s perfect for me.”</p>

      <p>Sydney Instagram model and influencer, Tyanna, was described as the perfect fit for the rewarding role as she checked off all the boxes.</p>
      <p>Some of the requirements Lepre detailed in his job ad were:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Above 18 years old</li>
        <li>Can arrange travel itineraries</li>
        <li>Strong knowledge of social media channels</li>
        <li>Able to handle business admin tasks</li>
        <li>Computer-literate</li>
        <li>Have great management skills</li>
      </ul>
      <p>“I’m used to travelling and working from different locations and different time zones”, said the 27-year-old.</p>
      <p>“I applied because it was already what I was doing – office and PA roles, social media content strategies. The role was perfect because I could travel, which I do a lot of anyway and have the best of both worlds.”</p>

      <p>Tyanna will join inspirational e-commerce revolutionary, Matthew Lepre, who started from the bottom, being raised by a single mother while living off food donations from the Salvation Army.</p>
      <p>He then dropped out of a dentistry degree to start the business eCommerce Warrior Academy and rose to success, now making an average of $120,000 (RM487,257) a month.</p>
      <p>“Tyanna will be travelling the world with my team and I, as we educate people that there is a better way than just working the 9-5 lifestyle.”</p>
