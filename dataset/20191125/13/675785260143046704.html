      <h1>Tottenham boss Jose Mourinho opens up on talks with Mauricio Pochettino’s son</h1>
      <h2>Jose Mourinho has doubled down on his invite for Mauricio Pochettino to come back to the Tottenham training ground whenever he wants to by speaking to his son</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T13:50:35+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 13:50</time> by <a rel="author">Dan Gibbs</a></address>
      <p>Jose Mourinho has once again insisted Mauricio Pochettino is always welcome at the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> training ground.</p>
      <p>The Portuguese boss was appointed as Pochettino’s replacement the morning after the Argentine was sacked on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>Mourinho says he hasn't been in contact with him but would welcome his visit.</p>
      <p>He's also spoken to Pochettino's son, Maurizio, who plays for the Under 18’s and Under 23’s.</p>
      <p>“I haven’t spoke to him. I’ve been there and I know what he’s going through,” he said.</p>

      <p>“I spoke to his son, in our academy, and I will call him.</p>
      <p>“I told the players here to tell him he’s free to come here whenever, to have a meal with the players, if he wants me here or not that’s fine.”</p>
      <p>Mourinho took charge of his first game on Saturday as he oversaw a 3-2 win against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> at the London Stadium.</p>
      <p>He now turns his attention to the Champions League - a competition he is no stranger to having achieved success with Inter Miland and Porto.</p>

      <p>Tottenham face Olympiakos tomorrow evening and the Portuguese is looking forward to experiencing the atmosphere in their stunning new stadium.</p>
      <p>“I love this competition as much as everyone in football. It’s something that everybody dreams of winning.</p>
      <p>"Not everyone has the privilege of being a Champions League winner which I was happy enough to do.</p>
      <p>"I can imagine [the atmosphere], because I’ve been at the new stadium as a football lover, watching Spurs v <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Newcastle</a> and I felt it.</p>
      <p>"The game was not good but I felt the connection between the fans and the team.</p>
      <p>"When you move home but you get a better home you don’t miss it so much.</p>
      <p>"I hope tomorrow can be the restart of the empathy between the fans and the team.”</p>
