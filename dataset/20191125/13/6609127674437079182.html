        <b>FAKE vodka laced with a potentially lethal antifreeze ingredient has been seized in Fife.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Bottles of the counterfeit Smirnoff are believed to contain isopropanol, which is used in anti-freeze and some fuels.</p>

      <p>It can lead to blindness and even death.</p>
      <p>The fake vodka bottles were found in a shop and a pub in the Levenmouth area as part of an investigation by Fife Council’s food safety and trading standards teams.</p>
      <p>The shop and pub have not yet been named but both premises will have their licences reviewed and may face prosecutions.</p>
      <p>Officers visited 30 licensed premises earlier this month, following tip-offs from the community.</p>
      <p>Douglas Hardaker, from Fife Council’s environmental health, said: “One of the vodkas was found to be dangerous and had things in it which could be seriously harmful.</p>
      <p>“These are things where you are not getting what you paid for, you are getting a little bit extra and it’s not good for you.”</p>
      <p>He said customers should follow the recommendations of the DrinkAware campaign, which advises buying alcohol from a reputable supermarket, off licence or shop, avoiding products sold at very cheap prices and looking out for poor quality labelling or unfamiliar brands.</p>
      <p>It’s thought the fake vodka may have contained isopropanol, which is used in anti-freeze and some fuels. The substance has been detected in counterfeit alcohol seized by police elsewhere in the UK.</p>
      <p>It can mimic the effects of regular alcohol, but also causes side effects including abdominal pain, sickness and dizziness.</p>
      <p>Investigations are under way to determine whether it was made locally or shipped in from elsewhere.</p>
      <p>Mr Hardaker urged people to be vigilant at Christmas and new year celebrations.</p>
      <p>Paul Madill, NHS Fife consultant in public health, said consumers needed to be able to trust shopkeepers and licensees.</p>
      <p>“People need to have confidence they are getting what they thought they were getting,” he said.</p>
      <p>Licensing forum member Paul Smith, the managing director of Castle Leisure Group who represents the licensed trade, said it was disappointing to see people flouting the law.</p>
      <p>“We would all like to see those people who peddle that type of illicit alcohol, while the rest of us comply with the rules and regulations, taken to task,” he said.</p>
