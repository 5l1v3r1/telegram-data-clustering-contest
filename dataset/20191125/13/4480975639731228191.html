      <p>Canopy Growth Corporation (<b>NYSE: CGC</b>) is kicking off the last week of November at a share price of $18.41, as per the close on Friday, substantially better than the previous week's close and the November 18 trough of $14.22.</p>
      <p>The Smiths Falls, Ontario based firm has been enjoying the <b>high tide affecting the cannabis sector</b> in addition to its massive, $2.7 billion war chest. Contrary to other companies such as <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/news/acb-stock-price-aurora-cannabis-incset-to-end-week-on-high-note-as-federal-legalization-advances-201911221442">Aurora Cannabis</a> (ACB), CGC's finances play in its favor. </p>
      <p><b>That may help it top the $20</b> per share mark that it topped in early November during the short Thanksgiving week.</p>
      <h3>Canopy Growth Corporation Stock Developments</h3>
      <p>CGC has been struggling with multiple issues.</p>
      <p>The firm led by <b>Mark Zekulin</b> – who is just in an interim capacity – has reported a <b>worrying decline of 15% in revenues</b> to $77 million, and an uninspiring increase of 2% in cannabis sales in its fiscal 2020 quarter. </p>
      <p>Zekulin has announced that he will <b>leave Canopy</b>, perhaps by the end of the year. The earlier departure of <b>Bruce Linton</b>, one of its founders, may have left a void in CGC's leadership and weighed on its growth prospects. </p>

      <p><b>Pot stocks such CGC</b> have been on the rise in the past week as the US House Judiciary Committee voted in favor of promoting the <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/news/marijuana-stocks-price-more-act-lifts-prices-from-lows-financials-still-weigh-201911201155"><b>MORE Act</b></a> that sets a pathway for <b>legalizing marijuana at the federal level</b>. Canadian weed stocks have made inroads in the US, via states where cannabis is legal. However, changing legislation for the whole of the world´s largest economy is already a game-changer.</p>
      <p><b>It is still unclear if the Senate would take up the bill</b> as majority leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican from Kentucky, is a lifelong opponent of legalizing marijuana. However, the veteran politician met with executives of cannabis companies.</p>
      <p>Once the dust settles from the political headlines, CGC's price will likely move in response to company-related news rather than the broader cannabis sector.</p>
