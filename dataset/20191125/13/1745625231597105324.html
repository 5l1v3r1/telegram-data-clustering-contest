      <h3>NBA Rumors: Bulls Could Acquire LaMarcus Aldridge For Package Centered On Zach LaVine, Per ‘Fadeaway World’</h3>

      <p>Partly owing to the fact that the <a href="http://inquisitr.com/tag/san-antonio-spurs">San Antonio Spurs</a> are currently struggling, with their 6-11 record putting them at a tie for 10th place in the Western Conference, power forward LaMarcus Aldridge has been mentioned in a number of trade rumors in recent weeks. The latest such rumors suggest that there are several teams that could benefit by making a deal for the veteran big man, including the same team that originally picked him second overall in the 2006 NBA Draft — the Chicago Bulls.</p>
      <p>In a report published on Monday, <a href="https://fadeawayworld.net/2019/11/25/nba-trade-rumors-top-5-best-destinations-for-lamarcus-aldridge/"><i>Fadeaway World</i></a> wrote that the Spurs might need to start the rebuilding process by trading Aldridge, who, as shown on his <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/a/aldrila01.html"><i>Basketball-Reference</i></a> player page, has seen his stats decline in the 2019-20 season. While still averaging a decent 18.1 points, 6.8 rebounds, and 2.5 assists for San Antonio, the 34-year-old power forward appears to have read the “writing on the wall” regarding his future with the team, per <i>Fadeaway World.</i> According to the publication, the Spurs might be better off at this point trading Aldridge for a combination of young prospects and players on expiring contracts.</p>
      <p>Toward the end of its list of five potential destinations for Aldridge, <i>Fadeaway World</i> discussed the Bulls and explained how the team could benefit from the 14-year veteran, noting that Chicago could use someone like him to “keep competitive” in the “top-heavy” Eastern Conference. To acquire him, however, the outlet recommended a trade package that would have Chicago moving its top scorer — shooting guard Zach LaVine — as well as a pair of promising youngsters in wingman Chandler Hutchison and center Wendell Carter Jr.</p>

      <p>“[T]he Bulls could start a very effective lineup with the likes of Aldridge, [Lauri] Markkanen, [Otto] Porter, and [Coby] White all starting,” <i>Fadeaway World</i> wrote. “This is a good lineup that is a certain playoff contender if they play well together.”</p>

      <p>Regarding how the Spurs could benefit from such a deal, it was pointed out that LaVine and Carter — the latter of whom is now starting at center in just his second NBA season — are both “very good” players at this point in their careers. Specifically, LaVine was described as a player who could step in and replace Aldridge’s contributions as a top offensive option, assuming he and Carter get shipped to San Antonio and join forces with young players like Derrick White and Dejounte Murray.</p>
      <p>Quite notably, the <i>Fadeaway World</i> report did not mention shooting guard DeMar DeRozan as a key member of the Spurs’ core in any of the suggested trades. Like Aldridge, DeRozan has also been the subject of <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/5742818/magic-demar-derozan/">various trade rumors</a>, including one linking him to the Orlando Magic.</p>
