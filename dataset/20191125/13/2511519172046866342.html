      <h1>Tory candidate gets friend to pose as 'fake swing voter' as party's disinformation campaign continues</h1>
      <h2>Ashfield Tory candidate's ruse is latest in string of Tory 'fake news' incidents </h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T13:51:33+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 13:51</time> by <a rel="author">Jon Stone</a></address>
      <p>A <a href="http://independent.co.uk/topic/conservatives">Conservative</a> candidate has been caught getting one of his friends to pose as a fake swing voter, raising further questions about the party's use of disinformation and "fake news".</p>
      <p>Lee Anderson, who is standing for the Tories in Ashfield in Nottinghamshire, forgot he was wearing a live microphone while he phoned his friend to set up the fake encounter to impress a journalist</p>
      <p>"Don't make out that you don't know who I am... you know I'm the candidate, but not a friend, alright?" Mr Anderson was recorded saying as he spelled out instructions to his friend minutes before bringing a journalist to his door. </p>
      <p>The candidate also appeared to lie about the content of the phone call, commenting to the reporter as he hung up that it was about "some leaflets that have just come for me".</p>
      <p>Upon arriving at the doorstep, the supposed swing voter told the Tory candidate "There's no way Labour are ever going to get my vote again!"  before heartily endorsing Mr Anderon's policy proposal to send problem tenants to labour camps.</p>
      <p>It was only afterwards that production staff at the <a href="https://www.mailplus.co.uk/tv/the-michael-crick-report/653/caught-in-the-act-how-hot-mic-exposed-would-be-mps-fake-news-ruse">Daily Mail's video team</a> realised that had recorded the Tory setting up the meeting. </p>
      <p>The fake encounter is the latest in a string of incidents of disinformation emanating from the Conservative party's campaign.</p>
      <p>Last week the party set up a fake website, labourmanifesto.co.uk, which purported to contain the Labour manifesto but which actually presented voters will Tory attack lines. It paid Google to push the website to the top of search results.</p>
      <p>Earlier in the week the Conservatives set up a fake fact-checking service "factcheckUK" on social media that was actually controlled by its press office and was used to pump out Tory messaging and endorsements of Boris Johnson. The move was branded "dystopian" and condemned by bone fide fact-checking services.</p>
      <p>The Ashfield candidate Mr Anderson made headlines earlier in the week when he said that 'nuisance' housing tenants should be made to live in tents and pick vegetables. Ashfield is a key Tory target seat, currently held by Labour MP Gloria de Piero, who has stood down at this election. The Labour candidate in the seat is Natalie Fleet.</p>
      <p>The Conservative party had not responded to a request for comment on this story at the time of publication.  </p>
