      <h1>Game Dev Story and Other Kairosoft Titles Are Coming to PS4</h1>
      <h2>Starting in Japan</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T13:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.pushsquare.com/users/Quintumply" target="_blank">Stephen Tailby</a></address>
      <p>Of all the time-wasters available on smartphones, none have hooked this author quite as much as Game Dev Story. It's a management sim about building up a development team, creating and releasing games, and expanding to keep up with demand. It's simple, but incredibly addictive. We've no doubt that this could also describe other games made by Japanese studio Kairosoft, such as Hot Springs Story and Dungeon Village. Fortunately, the developer is branching out onto console platforms, and <a href="https://gematsu.com/2019/11/game-dev-story-hot-springs-story-and-dungeon-village-coming-to-ps4-on-december-5-in-japan">it's bringing these three titles to PlayStation 4 soon</a>.</p>
      <p>In Japan, Game Dev Story, Hot Springs Story, and Dungeon Village will release on Sony's console on 5th December 2019. There's no word on whether we'll see more of Kairosoft's back catalogue arrive on PS4, or whether these ports will come to the West. However, the developer has ported a whopping 18 games to Nintendo Switch in Western territories, so it seems pretty likely that PS4 will get similar treatment in the future.</p>
      <p>What do you think of this news? Do you want to play Kairosoft's miniature management sims on PS4? Let us know in the comments below.</p>
