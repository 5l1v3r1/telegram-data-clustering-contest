      <p>Dewan <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/jenna-dewan-channing-tatum-divorce-decision">split</a> from <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/channing-tatum-talks-therapy-astrology-app">Channing Tatum</a> in 2018 after 10 years of marriage. In her new book, “Gracefully You, How to Live Your Best Life Every Day,” Dewan spoke on why the couple got a divorce.</p>
      <p>“I’d come to realize the dynamic I was in wasn’t serving me nor was it serving my daughter,” the actor-dancer wrote, according to <a href="https://people.com/movies/jenna-dewan-says-she-and-channing-tatum-split-when-the-dynamic-had-moved-into-hurting/">People</a>. “First and foremost I had to accept the realization this isn’t working and had moved into hurting.”</p>
