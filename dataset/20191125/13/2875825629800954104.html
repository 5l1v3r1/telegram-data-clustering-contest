      <h1>Worst ever overcrowding recorded at University Hospital Limerick as 85 patients wait for a bed</h1>
      <h2>A total of 631 patients are waiting for beds across the country, including 22 children</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T13:47:32+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 13:47</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/authors/edel-hughes/" target="_blank">Edel Hughes</a></address>
      <p>Ireland's worst ever overcrowding figures have been recorded at University Hospital Limerick (UHL) this morning as 85 patients wait for beds.</p>
      <p>The highest figure ever for a single day, it breaks the previous record of 82 at the same hospital last month.</p>
      <p>Patients without beds are typically on chairs and trolleys, often in corridors.</p>
      <p>Of the 85 waiting for a permanent bed in <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/limerick">Limerick</a>, 55 patients are in the emergency department while 30 are in wards elsewhere in the hospital.</p>
      <p>A total of 631 patients are waiting for beds across the country, including 22 children, according to figures provided by the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation (INMO).</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/cork-university-hospital">Cork University Hospital</a> is the second worst-hit by overcrowding with 52 patients waiting for beds, followed by Letterkenny University Hospital with 47 people, Tallaght University Hospital with 36 and 33 in University Hospital Galway.</p>
      <p>The INMO are calling on senior HSE management to implement a number of measures to alleviate the pressure at UHL.</p>
      <p>These include:</p>
      <p>Cancellation of non-essential elective work</p>
      <p>More home care packages to move patients out of the hospital</p>
      <p>Emergency funding for extra agency staff</p>
      <p>An immediate end to the recruitment ban for nurses and midwives</p>
      <p>Extra support for GPs and Public Health Nurses to allow more home/community treatment</p>

      <p>INMO Assistant Director of Industrial Relations for the region, Mary Fogarty said:“Despite the best efforts of local staff, the situation in Limerick continues to escalate. The hospital is breaking records in the worst possible way.</p>
      <p>“Promises of future improvement will not suffice. Real action is needed today.</p>
      <p>“We simply do not have sufficient capacity. Without an increase in beds and the professionals to staff them, this problem will continue to escalate.</p>
      <p>“Our members are on the frontline providing the best care they can – but the situation is intolerable for them and unsafe for patients.”</p>
