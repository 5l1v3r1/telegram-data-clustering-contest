      <h1>Canucks’ Alex Edler dodges injury bullet, plans to play vs. Flyers</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T13:38:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 13:38</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.sportsnet.ca/author/iain-macintyre/" target="_blank">Iain MacIntyre</a></address>
      <p>PHILADELPHIA – As unlucky as they’ve been with injuries at forward, the <a href="https://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/teams/vancouver-canucks/">Vancouver Canucks</a> continue to be favoured on defence by the hockey gods.</p>
      <p>Top defenceman Alex Edler skated this morning with teammates and plans to play Monday night against the Philadelphia Flyers, two days after abandoning the Canucks’ win in Washington when he sustained an undisclosed first-period injury.</p>
      <p>“I felt good yesterday, so going into today I felt good and the skate went well,” Edler told reporters. “I’ve had a lot of injuries, so I feel like I know my body really well. Today the skate went well.”</p>
      <p>Edler, whose average ice time of 24:48 before the Washington game easily led the Canucks, missed 26 games last season due to injuries and 52 over the last three years.</p>

      <p>Longest-serving teammate <a href="https://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/players/chris-tanev/547709">Chris Tanev</a> has missed 96 games over the last three seasons.</p>
      <p>The health of Edler and Tanev is imperative to the Canucks.</p>
      <p>While they continue to play without five forwards from the bottom half of the lineup, Quinn Hughes is the only defenceman this season who has missed a game – one game. And even that seemed lucky because the superb rookie’s ankle and leg buckled dangerously during a Nov. 1 fall in Anaheim.</p>
      <p>Tanev, meanwhile, left a Nov. 7 game in Chicago, reappeared in the lineup the next night in Winnipeg and then survived another injury scare when he was drilled in the knee by Patrik Laine’s slapshot.</p>
      <p>“I guess it depends on the injury,” Edler said. “When you break your bones or someone falls on your leg, I don’t know what you can do about it. Maybe you can change the way you play, but I don’t think me or Tanny is going to be very effective if we do that. Some of it is definitely bad luck.”</p>
      <p>The luck among bottom-six forwards is starting to turn.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/players/jay-beagle/447212">Jay Beagle</a> will miss Monday his fifth game out of seven with an undisclosed injury, but coach Travis Green insists the centre remains “day-to-day.” Another key centre and penalty-killer, <a href="https://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/players/brandon-sutter/392952">Brandon Sutter</a>, who has missed five games with a groin injury, rejoined teammates in Philadelphia, skated Monday morning and will practise with the team Tuesday in Pittsburgh.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/players/antoine-roussel/594801">Antoine Roussel</a>’s rebuilt knee, which has kept him out since last spring, is well enough that the winger has been sent on a conditioning assignment to the American League. And rugged winger Michael Ferland will meet the Canucks in Pittsburgh and could practise for the first time since suffering a concussion Oct. 30 in a staged fight with Los Angeles Kings’ Kyle Clifford.</p>
      <p>Penalty-killing winger <a href="https://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/players/tyler-motte/744828">Tyler Motte</a> (foot) is expected to miss another couple of weeks. He has played only six games this season.</p>
