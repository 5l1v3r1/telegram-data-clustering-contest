      <p>It's that time of year when at least one house in every street goes ALL OUT with the Christmas lights and decorations.</p>
      <p>But one home in North Devon has taken things to quite an extreme this year.</p>
      <p>What started as a small idea to light up their house has turned into a huge fundraising event for partners Dave Tucker and Hayley Watson.</p>
      <p>Their home at Trent Close in Bideford was last night lit up by more than 60 illuminated features - plugged into 47 household sockets.</p>

      <p>More than 200 people are believed to have turned up to witness the switch on, which also featured a Santa's Grotto in the families garage.</p>
      <p>Dave has previous when it comes to Christmas lights, but even he says this is the biggest and best display he's ever organised.</p>
      <p>He said: "I've been doing it for years but never on this scale.</p>
      <p>"Last year was the first time we decided to do it for charity, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/donate/621879485012948/10217677121254636/">raising money for Stepping Stones pre-school</a> where my partner Hayley works.</p>
      <p>"It was a bit last minute in 2018 but this year we have been planning and setting up for weeks - other than work, we've literally done nothing else for the past two months."</p>
      <p>Dave, who works at the Royal Marines base in Instow, roped in an electrician colleague to help him wire up the house.</p>

      <p>He said: "All the lights are LEDs so they don't use a huge amount of power.</p>
      <p>"Last year I estimated that the whole six week display cost us about £40 in total.</p>
      <p>"Having said that, we try not to use anything else electrical in the house while the display is on, which is between 5pm and 9pm each night from now until New Year's Day."</p>
      <p>Initially the plan was to just light up the house, but as more ideas came to the couple, the event just grew and grew.</p>
      <p>Dave said: "For the switch on last night we decided to turn the garage into a Santa's Grotto and even managed to rope in the former Santa from the Big Sheep - he was fantastic.</p>
      <p>"At first we thought we'd offer free sausage rolls, then we added free drinks and gifts for any children, then we decided to get some reindeer food to give out, then we bought loads of tins of Quality Street to hand out - it's just got absolutely massive."</p>

      <p>And the crowd that turned up was massive too, with around 200 people coming to witness the switch on last night (Sunday, November 24).</p>
      <p>Dave said: "I was holding my breath around the switch on, I was just praying that everything worked. </p>
      <p>"Paul Mugford from the North Devon News Facebook page came to flick the switch, which was great.</p>
      <p>"It's definitely the biggest and best display we've ever done."</p>
      <p>As well as Dave and Hayley, their six-year-old son Denny also lives at the house with them.</p>
      <p>Dave added: "He was so excited, it's a magical place to be at Christmas."</p>
      <p>Dave and Hayley had initially set a fundraising target of £1,000 - but have already taken more than £750 so far.</p>
