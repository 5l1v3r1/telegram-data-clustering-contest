      <h1>Shed Seven celebrate Rick Witter's birthday at Rock City</h1>
      <h2>His band present Rick with a birthday cake</h2>

      <p>It’s Rick Witter’s birthday, but it’s hard to tell if he’s in a good or a bad mood from the early exchanges with the crowd. After rousing opener Room in my House wets the whistles of the sold out, predominantly male audience, first Rick has a pop at someone for holding up a sign and then lambasts someone else for asking for an autograph during the set.</p>
      <p>Is it banter? Is Rick ok with being 47? The crowd’s chants of Happy Birthday don’t land well either, and the band make ‘slitting throat’ gestures in a bid to stop the chants.</p>
      <p>Despite this, he sounds great. In this two-hour set there’s a real mixture of old and relatively new, and the songs are bolstered by an organ and a brass section. Then, prior to the first chord of On Standby, his band present Rick with a birthday cake and thankfully there are wide smiles.</p>

      <p>It’s a ‘phew’ moment, Rick’s OK, he’s embraced it. Play ball. And indeed, they do, and play it well. Formed in 1990, there’s no signs of fatigue or gigging for gigs’ sake. They love it.</p>
      <p>They have an arsenal of songs to choose from, and it’s a pleasure to hear first album songs Mark, Dolphin and Ocean Pie.</p>
      <p>But without doubt, it’s the songs from their scintillating sophomore record, A Maximum High, that are met with the most gusto, not least the anthemic Going for Gold, which sees the brass section trio don sparkling gold jackets.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, Disco Down is a pulsing, throbbing dance floor filler. Rock City is bouncing.</p>
      <p>But if it’s an anthem you want then it’s an anthem you shall get when Chasing Rainbows closes their immense set in climactic fashion, its every word changed back at them like a terrace favourite. It is sublime.</p>
      <p>Rick, it turned out, was OK with being 47, and this birthday bash is some party.</p>
