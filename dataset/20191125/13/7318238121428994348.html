      <p>Thieves have carried out a heist at a museum in Germany in what could be the largest museum theft in post-Second World War history.</p>
      <p>Jewels and other treasures worth up to a billion euros from Dresden's Gruenes Gewoelbe - or Green Vault museum - were seized, according to Germany’s Bild newspaper.</p>
      <p>"Priceless" diamonds were stolen, according to police, who said at a press conference two people are wanted in connection with the burglary, but so far no arrests had been made.</p>
      <p>Police did not rule out the possibility of other suspects being involved.</p>
      <p>Security camera footage showed the perpetrators entering through a window, shattering the glass of a display case and taking the contents, before going back out the window and fleeing.</p>
      <p>The thieves stole three "priceless" ensembles of early 18th century jewelry in diamond, ruby and emerald, Dresden police and museum officials said.</p>
      <p>Two fires in the city centre may also be associated with the escape, police said.</p>
      <p>Investigators have sealed off the museum, which houses one of Europe’s largest collections of jewellery.</p>
      <p>The museum confirmed the burglary, which was at the historic part the collection in the Grünes Gewölbe.</p>
      <p>The collection was founded in the 18th century by August the Strong, Elector of Saxony and later King of Poland.</p>

      <p>The thieves couldn’t get hold of its best known treasure - the 41-carat Dresden "Green Diamond" - which is currently on loan to New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art.</p>
      <p>Museum director Marion Ackermann said it would be impossible to sell the stolen works on the open market.</p>
      <p>"We are talking here of objects of immeasurable cultural value," said her colleague Dirk Syndram. "It's almost world cultural heritage. There is nowhere else a collection of jewelry in this form, quality and quantity."</p>
      <p>Michael Kretschmer, the head of Saxony, said: "The works in the Green Vault and the Palace were built up by the people of Saxony with many centuries of hard work," adding the theft was a blow for the whole state.</p>
