      <p>A grandmother and her two grandsons were killed after a train collided with their SUV, authorities say.</p>
      <p>Valery Jo Rintamaki, 58, Trystan Prestano, 10, and Skyler Prestano, 8, were killed in the crash as they drove to a campground near the JW Corbett Wildlife Management area in Jupiter, Florida on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Police said Rintamaki failed to yield to a northbound Amtrak train that struck her 2018 Subaru Outback and dragged it a half-mile down the tracks. The family’s deaths are being treated as a tragic accident.</p>
      <p>David Peat, the boys’ grandfather and caretaker, told the <a href="https://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/20191124/crash-at-rail-crossing-claims-lives-of-two-wellington-boys-grandmother">Palm Beach Post</a> that the train crossing did not have any guard gates or flashing lights to warn of approaching trains.</p>
      <p>Peat said he was shocked by the lack of safety precautions and added that the crossing was marked with a yield sign instead of a stop sign.</p>

      <p>‘There’s no drop-down gates, no lights, no signal,’ he said.</p>
      <p>Peat brought his concerns to state Representative Matt Willhite, who promised to investigate the incident further.</p>
      <p>Willhite said: ‘We just lost three members of our community, and young kids.’</p>
      <p>‘I’m going to look into why we don’t have more than just a yields sign at a rail crossing where a train is going.’</p>
      <p>Donna Cumella, Rintamaki’s childhood friend called the lack of warning signals at the railroad crossing ‘upsetting,’ and said she now fear for other drivers in the area.</p>

      <p>‘I mean this was a senseless act to happen…Here’s someone that was a mother, a grandmother, that was taking her grandchildren camping for their Boy Scouts,’ Dona Cumella told <a href="https://cbs12.com/news/local/friend-of-amtrak-train-crash-victim-says-senseless-tragedy-could-have-been-avoided">CBS 12.</a></p>
      <p>‘(Her grandchildren) meant the world to her. (They) were the center of all the things she has done,’ she continued.</p>
      <p>An Amtrak spokeswoman told <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/woman-two-boys-killed-after-their-suv-collides-amtrak-train-n1090311?cid=sm_npd_nn_tw_ma">NBC News</a> that none of the train’s passengers or crew members were injured.</p>
