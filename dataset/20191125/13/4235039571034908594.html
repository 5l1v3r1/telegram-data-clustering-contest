      <p>The composition of the new <b>European Commission</b>, chaired by <b>Ursula von der Leyen</b>, has been approved by the Council of the European Union. The new EC now needs to be voted on by the European Parliament. That will happen on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The new 25 EU Commissioners and High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security were approved at today's <b>EU Council</b> meeting. This decision paves the way for an EP vote.</p>
      <p>The European Parliament will have to vote on the entire composition of the committee. It is expected to be approved, but with a minimal majority. Once approved, the <b>European Commission</b> will be operational on 2 December.</p>
      <p>Each Member State has nominated a representative to the <b>European Commission</b> responsible for a specific area. Bulgaria is represented by Mariya Gabriel, who will be responsible for innovation and youth.</p>
      <p>The UK, which is in the process of leaving the EU, has not nominated a candidate. Brexit is due on January 31, 2020.</p>
