      <p>HBO's <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/watchmen/"><i>Watchmen</i></a> star Louis Gossett Jr. has pulled back the curtain on what it's like to play Will Reeves in the series, which is based on the world of Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons' lauded graphic novel.</p>
      <p>Having escaped the Tulsa Race Massacre of 1921 and survived to present day, Reeves has slowly revealed his mysterious history with each passing episode. While the show has teased his connection to his old hometown as well as characters like Angela Abar, Gossett Jr. has now addressed the connection that exists between his character and Bass Reeves, the first black deputy U.S. marshal west of the Mississippi River.</p>

      <p>"Well, I have to connect the dots, because that brilliant brain of Damon's [Lindelof], I couldn't hang on to a lot of the stuff," Gossett Jr. told <a href="https://tv.avclub.com/louis-gossett-jr-on-watchmen-erasure-and-why-he-d-re-1839867702">AV Club</a>. "I actually made the decision to read the story, then put it aside, and focus on what my contribution would be -- what I could add to the character. I became connected to the most successful marshal in the West, Bass Reeves. I grew up on the different elements of that character and then created this thing, this person. I don't think they even realized that it would fit. I didn't realize it would fit! I just did the best I could, and it turns out that my contribution to the story lent to the mysteriousness of it. It was a wonderful challenge to be involved with a character that kept my attention 24/7. I like to stretch like that."</p>
      <p>Gossett Jr. admitted that he had grown up learning the stories of Bass Reeves, noting, "He was the most successful marshal in the West. I'm very familiar with his story. A lot of the cowboys were based on Bass Reeves' adventures, including all kinds of the marshals. Wyatt Earp was second to Bass Reeves, but there's other characters that Bass Reeves made famous. Events from his life were taken and used to create other Western heroes. Because he was a legend -- he never lost a man except for one guy he didn't catch. And that was probably his son. But he had the most successful career in the history of all the Western stories."</p>
