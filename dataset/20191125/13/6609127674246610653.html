        <b>AN AMERICAN clothing brand has caused a stir in Scotland after promoting it's newest item, modelled by Blink 182 drummer Travis Barker.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The tattooed rocker is the face of F*** The Population's latest offering - a white zip hoodie.</p>

        <figcaption>Blink 182 rocker Travis Barker caused a stir with his latest brand modelling</figcaption>

      <p>But across the front it is emblazoned with the brand's initials - FTP.</p>
      <p>The letters are sometimes used in a vile slur about the Pope.</p>
      <p>And eagle-eyed Rangers and Celtic were quick to highlight this after the clothing line shared the preview snap of their hoodie online.</p>

      <p>F*** The Population posted the seemingly-innocent pic of Barker on Twitter, promising the new gear will be available to buy from Saturday.</p>
      <p>But the comments under the post were flooded with Scots, quick to point out the issue with the branding.</p>
      <p>One user replied: "This does not translate well in Glasgow.</p>
      <p>"@TravisBarker, I wouldn't wear this on tour in Scotland if I were you."</p>
      <p>Another agreed, adding: "I wouldn't wear this in Scotland."</p>
      <p>But a third user took the opposite view, saying: "This will go down well in Glasgow."</p>
      <p>And a fourth replied: "If you released a Union Jack emblazoned jacket with your logo on it, sales would spike in Glasgow."</p>
      <p>Another was less sure, jokingly asking: "What could possibly go wrong wearing this round toon?"</p>
      <p>One user had a fashion tip, saying: "Would go perfect with a pair of Brown shoes."</p>
      <p>Someone else referred to a famous Ibrox chant, asking: "Are you going to bring out 'we are the population - WATP' next?"</p>
      <p>And one fan linked it to Blink 182's famous tune All The Small Things, commenting: "All the staunch things."</p>
