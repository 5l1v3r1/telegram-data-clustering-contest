      <h1>Tesla may attach frigging lasers to their Telsa CyberTruck according to a new patent</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T13:33:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 13:33</time> by <a rel="author">Surur</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/tesla-cybertruck-revealed-offers-better-utility-than-a-truck-with-better-performance-than-a-sports-car/">Tesla Cybertruck</a> is a bit over the top, and many have compared it to a warthog from Halo, or as <a href="https://earther.gizmodo.com/the-cybertruck-is-a-vision-for-a-dystopian-climate-futu-1840003595">Gizmodo notes</a>, “<i>a  vision for a dystopian climate future</i>” which “<i>not only replicates past failures, but weaponizes them for an increasingly hot, dangerous future</i>.”</p>
      <p>I suspect even Gizmodo did not suspect Tesla was planning to add lasers to their truck, but this may be exactly what Tesla is set to do.</p>
      <p>To be fair, the lasers are unlikely to target living beings, unless they happen to be attached to the front windscreen (which may happen in the course of a collision of course).</p>
      <p>A new patent for “PULSED LASER CLEANING OF DEBRIS ACCUMULATED ON GLASS ARTICLES IN VEHICLES AND PHOTOVOLTAIC ASSEMBLIES” suggests its about time we do away with wipers to clear away debris from a screen, and turn to lasers instead.</p>

      <p>The patent notes:</p>
      <blockquote>Cleaning apparatus and methods for pulsed laser cleaning of deposits that have accumulated on glass articles in vehicles and photovoltaic systems are shown substantially in at least one of the figures and / or described in connection with this, as set forth more fully in the claims.<br/>The following described implementations may be found in the disclosed method and apparatus for pulsed laser cleaning of debris accumulated on glass articles in vehicles and photovoltaic assemblies. In one implementation, the cleaning apparatus may be installed as a modular device in a vehicle and may provide a contactless means to clean different glass articles, for example windshields, in-vehicle camera lenses, side windows, rear-view mirrors, and the like, in the vehicle by a pulsed laser beam. The cleaning apparatus provides a fast, robust, and chemical-free solution to clean different glass articles in vehicles and solar photovoltaic facilities</blockquote>
      <p>The patent notes dirty glass may impede the line of sight for drivers, but also importantly, for self-driving vehicles, the view of cameras and other sensors.</p>
      <p>The solution may be combined with other methods such as wipers, but there is one vehicle in particular which may demand this technology – the Tesla Cybertruck, which completely lacks a windshield wiper.</p>
      <p>Now the only question remains is whether the Tesla Cybertruck wipers lasers are on turrets and if they can turn 180 degrees…</p>
