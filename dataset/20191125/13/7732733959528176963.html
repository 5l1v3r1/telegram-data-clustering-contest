      <h1>Tesla receives over 200,000 pre-orders for the Cybertruck in less than a week</h1>
      <h2>A cracking start despite the cracked windows</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T13:06:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 13:06</time> by <a rel="author">Humza Aamir</a></address>
      <h4>What just happened? Tesla's Cybertruck unveiling wasn't without its faults, but it did manage to garner a lot of interest from early adopters, over 200,000 of whom placed pre-orders for the electric pickup over the weekend.</h4>
      <p>It's fairly easy to imagine the hype when Elon Musk gets onstage with an <a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/82887-tesla-cybertruck.html">electric pickup</a> nearly as divisive as the man himself. Although Tesla's stock price dipped by 6 percent after the Cybertruck's recent unveiling, pre-orders continued to pile up over the weekend and reached an impressive 200,000 as of Sunday night.</p>
      <p>The pickup is still a few years away, but the company's marketing and the lower price of admission have resulted in a healthy number of prospective buyers. Keeping them as such would be a challenge for Tesla, as the company's track record of actually delivering its cars on schedule has run into various issues in the past, leading many to <a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/74923-23-percent-tesla-model-3-reservations-have-refunded.html">cancel their reservations</a> last year after running out of patience for the Model 3 to make it to their driveways.</p>

      <p>Nevertheless, the pickup truck remains a favorite class of vehicle among US buyers, most of whom are likely behind these pre-order figures. It also helps that the $100 refundable fee needed to reserve the Cybertruck is Tesla's lowest price yet, as compared to the $1,000 deposit required for the Model 3 and the $2,500 fee for the Model Y SUV.</p>
      <p>Reaching such a high number of pre-orders for the Cybertruck was made possible "with no advertising &amp; no paid endorsement" boasted Musk on Twitter, but then that duty was taken over by the internet itself, which unleashed a sea of Cybertruck memes over the weekend and made sure the electric pickup remained a hot topic of most discussions, online and offline.</p>

      <p>Highlighting the Cybertruck's utility and speed, Musk compared it to America's current favorite pickup and one of the world's best sports cars, calling it a "better truck than an F-150 [and] faster than a Porsche 911." For what it's worth, he also shared a brief clip of the Ford pickup being pulled uphill by the supposedly more powerful and heavier Cybertruck.</p>
      <p>Although Tesla's latest product might not be to everyone's taste, the company can certainly do with the $20 million or so which it has generated through the Cybertruck's pre-orders in such a short period. The company has only managed to record five profitable quarters to date, including its <a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/82187-tesla-delivers-record-number-cars-q3.html">latest Q3'19</a>, and the Cybertruck could potentially provide a much needed, if temporary, financial relief.</p>
      <p>Also, unlike the Model 3 that was touted as the cheapest Tesla but launched with its most expensive trim, the Cybertruck will be made the other way round. Its cheaper single and dual-motor versions will be produced initially in the latter part of 2021, followed by the flagship tri-motor spec that's expected to arrive no sooner than late 2022.</p>
