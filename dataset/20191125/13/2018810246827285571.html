      <p>If you like your gaming sales big, then you're in luck. Black Friday is coming and with it, a bunch of PC titles are being slashed on Green Man Gaming including <i>The Outer Worlds</i>, <i>Red Dead Redemption 2</i> and <i>Mordhau</i>.</p>
      <p>It's actually the early bird offers that are available now with even more titles to be added when Black Friday actually comes around. To continue the good times, GMG is also giving away <a href="https://greenmangaming.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360003830617">five <i>free</i> games</a> with certain purchases. Look for games with the '+5' tag in the corner to be eligible for that promotion. Just make sure you get in before December 3 when the sale finishes.</p>
      <p>That list, which is subject to change, includes these titles as of writing:</p>
