      <p>West Ham goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski looks to be back in light training judging by a video posted by teammate Albian Ajeti on Monday afternoon.</p>
      <p>The reigning Hammer of the Year has been sorely missed since tearing a hip muscle in the first half of the 2-2 draw at Bournemouth on September on September 28 - West Ham haven't won a game since.</p>
      <p>Second string goalie Roberto has stepped in since the Pole was injured and underwent surgery on his injury.</p>
      <p>The Spanish stopper has been a disaster since replacing Fabianski, shipping 15 goals in six games and one against Bournemouth after coming on for the keeper midway through the first half.</p>
      <p>Results have completely tumbled since Fabianski was ruled out as the Hammers have failed to win in their last seven and Manuel Pellegrini's expensively-assembled squad have been dragged into a relegation fight they should never have been a part of.</p>
      <p>Fabianski is still expected to be out until January 2020 and despite the video emerging on Ajeti's Instagram account, there has been no news of a quicker return to action for the keeper.</p>
      <p>The video shows goalkeeper coach Xavi Valero working with Fabianski by firing footballs at him from a machine at an indoor facility at the Rush Green training ground, which you can see above.</p>
      <p>Speaking about his injury last week, Fabianski said: "I'm all good.</p>

      <p>"I'm feeling like the rehab is going in the right direction, in the right way. I think I’m getting better and I’m doing more things, so hopefully it will continue like that and it will be successful.</p>
      <p>"I [have] started to move around a little bit more. When you do surgery on that kind of muscle, you have to be very careful, according to the specialist, for the first six weeks, and this was my fifth week. You have to feel like everything is in the proper way and not go crazy when you feel like you are able to do a little bit more.</p>

      <p>"This week will be steady but then hopefully I will be able to kick on a bit more after that six weeks are up."</p>
      <p>Pellegrini has a decision to make ahead of the game against Chelsea as to whether to stick with the hapless Roberto in goal or give third-choice keeper David Martin the nod. U23s stopper Joseph Anang could also come into the equation as the Hammers manager searches for answers on their dismal form, something he has yet to find.</p>
      <p>Roberto was ironically cheered whenever he touched the ball during the 3-2 defeat to Spurs at the weekend, punched Angelo Ogbonna in the shoulder instead of the ball when making a clearance, shanked two early clearances awry and allowed Harry Kane's header to go through his hands and into the net.</p>
      <p>Son Heung-min's opener was almost straight at the stopper as well but he failed to keep it out. Pellegrini was asked about his calamity keeper post-match but refused to discuss Roberto's performance.</p>
      <p>Pellegrini himself is a man under pressure having overseen some dire performances in the last couple of months and is expected to turn things around in the next couple of games or he could find himself well and truly on the hotseat.</p>
