      <p><a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/tsla-stock">Tesla’s</a> rebounding after its Cybertruck disaster sent shares slipping last week.</p>
      <p>Shares of the electric-vehicle maker were up as much as 5% in early trading Monday after <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1198788116372344832">Elon Musk tweeted Sunday</a> that 200,000 people had pre-ordered the electric pickup.</p>
      <p>The tweet followed <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1198344195317985280">an earlier message from Saturday</a> in which Musk said that only 48 hours after the Cybertruck reveal event – where the <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/tesla-stock-price-falls-electric-cybertruck-windows-break-live-demo-2019-11-1028711470">vehicle’s “shatterproof” windows were accidentally smashed in a demonstration</a> – as many as 146,000 people had pre-ordered the truck.</p>
      <p>The glut of orders also comes after Wall Street’s <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/tesla-cybertruck-analyst-reaction-live-demo-wall-street-puzzled-appearance-2019-11-1028712126">less-than-rosy reaction to the Cybertruck’s futuristic design</a>. Analysts wrote Friday that the truck looked “weird” and that it could keep consumers from purchasing it.</p>
      <p>So far, it seems that the more expensive options are the most popular. Musk tweeted Saturday that 41% pre-ordered the triple-motor option, which starts at $US69,900, and 42% have ordered the dual-motor option at $US49,900. Only 17% have pre-ordered the single-motor option, which starts at $US39,900.</p>

      <p>The pre-orders are coming in even with “no advertising and no paid endorsement,” <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1198347240785338368">according to Musk</a>.</p>
      <p>Customers can pre-order a Cybertruck on <a href="https://www.tesla.com/cybertruck">Tesla’s website</a> for a $US100 “fully refundable” deposit. And, they will be able to complete their configuration “as production nears in late 2021,” the website reads.</p>
      <p>Tesla shares are up <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/tsla-stock">0.2% year-to-date</a> through Friday’s close.</p>
