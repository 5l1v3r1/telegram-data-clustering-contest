      <h1>Sergio Aguero injury: Pep Guardiola says Manchester City will be without star striker for a few weeks with injury</h1>

        <b>Pep Guardiola says Sergio Aguero will be out for "a few weeks" after picking up an injury during Manchester City's win against Chelsea at the weekend.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The nature of the injury was not made clear by Guardiola in his pre-match press conference for their midweek Champions League game, but he confirmed Aguero would be out for a few games.</p>
      <p>That timescale would appear to rule him out of the Manchester derby against United, which takes place on December 7, and even Guardiola admitted that it would be a miracle if Aguero recovered in time.</p>
      <p>The Argentinian limped out of <b><a href="https://www.sportinglife.com/football/news/man-city-end-chelsea-run/174354">Saturday's 2-1 win against Chelsea</a></b>, and he will definitely miss Tuesday night's Champions League clash with Shakhtar Donetsk, but his return date is unknown.</p>

      <p>"Sergio will be out for a few games, a few weeks. I don't know exactly," said Guardiola. "(The injury) is at the front."</p>
      <p>Asked about the United game, the Spaniard added: "Maybe we will have a miracle but I don't think so."</p>
      <p>City will qualify for the last 16 of the Champions League if they avoid defeat against Shakhtar, and Guardiola added: "The position we have is good but we have not qualified yet.</p>
      <p>"Tomorrow is a chance."</p>

      <h3>Jesus to step in for Aguero</h3>
      <p>Gabriel Jesus will be the man to step into Aguero's shoes up front, and the Brazilian added: "I am not happy Sergio is injured.</p>
      <p>"I don't like it when my friends are injured, but every day I work hard and I am ready."</p>
      <p>Guardiola's assistant Mikel Arteta has been linked with the Arsenal job should Unai Emery leave, while Everton could also be in the hunt if Marco Silva is sacked.</p>
      <p>Guardiola backed his fellow Spaniard to be a successful manager when it happens, saying: "For sure he will be a manager.</p>
      <p>"I want him to stay here as long as possible but personal life is personal life, professional desire is professional."</p>
