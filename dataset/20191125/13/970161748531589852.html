      <p>Showcase Cinemas has become the second chain to pull gangland movie Blue Story from its venues after a mass brawl broke out in Birmingham.</p>
      <p>Over the weekend Vue Cinemas decided to remove the film from 91 of their outlets, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/24/vue-accused-blatant-racism-banning-blue-story-machete-attack-11210857/">sparking accusations of ‘blatant racism’</a> on social media.</p>
      <p>The company said they wanted to protect the ‘safety and welfare’ of customers after a mass brawl broke out in the Star City entertainment complex on November 23.</p>
      <p>Around 100 people were involved in the incident, with Birmingham Police seizing two machetes and a knife.</p>
      <p>Five teenagers were arrested, including a 13-year-old girl, while seven officers sustained injuries at the scene.</p>

      <p>The film is rated 15 and warns of very strong language, strong violence, threat, sex, and drug misuse.</p>
      <p>Writer and director Rapman, real name Andrew Onwubolu, said on Sunday: ‘It’s truly unfortunate that a small group of people can ruin things for everybody.</p>
      <p>‘Blue Story is a film about love not violence.’</p>
      <p>Yesterday the phrase ‘No Blue No Vue’ began trending on Twitter as social media users voiced their outrage at the film’s ban.</p>

      <p>Adefolahan Oshinloye, a business professional in corporate law, described the ban as ‘institutional racism in practice’.</p>
      <p>He told Metro.co.uk: ‘The fact that the perpetrators of the violence were not even from the Black British community – although annoying – is less important than the fact that for some reason Vue has seen fit to punish the creators of Blue Story for the actions of others.</p>
      <p>‘Had the violence been committed by black children, it would still not be a good enough reason to issue a blanket ban of a film that promotes an anti-gang violence message at its core.</p>
      <p>‘There are clearly issues with youth violence in Birmingham, as there are across the country. It is clearly not race specific, but largely denotes the socio-economic problems across the nation.’</p>
      <p>A Vue spokesperson has refuted allegations of racism, stating: ‘The safety and welfare of our customers and staff is always our first priority.</p>

      <p>‘We are saddened to have had to take this step, which is not made lightly, particularly as the film itself seeks to strike a strong message against violence.’</p>

      <p>A spokesperson for Showcase confirmed that Blue Story has been removed from ‘all of participating cinemas’.</p>
      <p>They continued: ‘Any guests that have purchased tickets in advance can receive a full refund at the cinema box office.</p>
      <p>‘We remain in discussions with the distributor with regards to the possibility of re-introducing the film in due course.</p>
      <p>‘We apologise for any inconvenience but guest safety remains our top priority.’</p>
