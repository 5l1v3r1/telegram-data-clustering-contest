      <p>BTS V's China Fan Site,<a href="https://twitter.com/KIMTAEHYUNGBAR_">@KIMTAEHYUNGBAR_</a>is making history again.</p>
      <p>On November 23, Baidu V Bar revealed the second part of the lavish birthday support they have planned for BTS V from the Project Vionysus series,called <b>"City of a Thousand Stars"</b>  and the mammoth-scale event is absolutely jaw dropping. </p>
      <p>The project involves a total of<b> 1,899</b> individual birthday supporting ads for<b> BTS V </b> that will completely cover <b>ALL</b> of <b>Seoul's Subway systems</b>-and all of these will light up like thousands of stars in December where<b> </b><b>millions of passengers</b> will be able to see and resonate with the feeling of the celebration and, just like their previous projects, will be done <b>for the first time in history. </b></p>
      <p><b>The Seoul Subway</b> is the <b>heart</b> of the city having 9 major lines  which possesses one of  the <b>world's largest railway systems</b> with <b>maximum capacity of passengers</b>; <b>400 shops</b>, and nearly 2,000 screens that will display  their heartfelt wishes  for the multi-talented artist's birthday. </p>

      <p>The  <b>birthday support ad</b>s will contain the <b>most visible displays with the highest frequency</b>, and the<b> best publicity effect</b> for this luxurious celebration. From the entrance, up and down the escalators, from the landing to the exit, passengers and shoppers won't be able to escape it. The ads will start from <b>December 21-January 3</b>,  with an average running time of <b>20 seconds for each display.</b></p>

      <p>It's unbelievable that this <b>colossal project</b> is only the second part of what they have in store for<b> BTS V's</b> birthday. But what's not surprising is the <b>love</b> that <b>@KIMTAEHYUNGBAR</b> holds in their hearts and the <b>dedication</b> they have shown tirelessly for him over the years which is far more capacious than any other birthday surprises they have held so far.  On Twitter, they sincerely expressed the meaning of this project  for <b>BTS V,</b> the <b>brightest star in the universe.</b></p>
