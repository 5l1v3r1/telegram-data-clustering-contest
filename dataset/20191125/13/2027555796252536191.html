      <h1>Bangladesh prove inadequate to the Test task again</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T13:18:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 13:18</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/reuters" target="_blank">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>Few expected Mominul Haque and his men to upset India on their home soil, but the tourists' back-to-back defeats, both inside three days, underlined just how much Bangladesh have stagnated in the long format.</p>
      <p>Since debuting as a test nation in 2000, Bangladesh have played 117 matches and won 13, six of them against Zimbabwe who are currently 11th in the official test rankings.</p>
      <p>The 2-0 drubbing they received in India follows similar losses in South Africa, West Indies and New Zealand.</p>
      <p>Over-reliance on spinners, lack of quality pace bowlers and technical inadequacy of their batsmen bred on low and slow pitches are often blamed for their struggles abroad.</p>
      <p>Mominul accepted the progress has been tardy though he expected a turnaround.</p>
      <p>"You need quality pace bowlers to improve in test cricket," the 28-year-old said after beginning his captaincy tenure with a 2-0 loss against India.</p>
      <p>"But we're now getting sporting wickets and quality pace bowlers are coming through the ranks. So I'm optimistic of improvement."</p>
      <p>Regular exposure against strong opponents was necessary if the ninth-ranked test team wanted to move up the ladder, he said.</p>
      <p>"We don't play top teams regularly, it's definitely one of the reasons...We have around 10 tests coming next year, so I think we can overcome these issues."</p>
      <p>India counterpart Virat Kohli felt Bangladesh players possessed skills but needed frequent test experience to get better.</p>
      <p>"If you play two test matches and then you play after an year-and-half, you won't really understand how to figure out situations or play under pressure," Kohli said.</p>
      <p>"The board and the players have to figure out what test cricket means to them and that's the only way you can go forward."</p>
      <p>Prioritising test cricket and offering financial security to players were crucial in the era of Twenty20 cricket, Kohli said.</p>
      <p>"I'm not sure how test cricket is discussed in the Bangladesh board, how much importance it is given."</p>
      <p>"If test cricketers are not kept at a good financial level, after a while their motivation goes down because some player, who plays 20-over games and is bowling four overs, is making 10 times what you make."</p>
      <p>He said India benefited from central contracts which prioritised test cricket.</p>
      <p>"You see why Australia, England, New Zealand have been strong for years - because their contract structure starts from tests and then everything else follows...That's something we figured out and now we can see the results."</p>
