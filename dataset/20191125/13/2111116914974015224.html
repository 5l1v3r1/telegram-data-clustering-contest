      <h3>Snap up the full-frame Sony A7 II for just £999 in this Black Friday camera steal</h3>
      <p>Full-frame classic dips under a grand for the first time</p>
      <p>Been waiting for a full-frame camera bargain to pop up during <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/black-friday/best-2019-black-friday-deals">Black Friday</a>? This £999 offer on the Sony A7 II is the best one we've seen yet, as it gives you one of the best full-framers of recent years for its lowest price yet.</p>
      <p>Sony's A7 series have rightly been hailed as trailblazers for mirrorless full-frame cameras in the past few years. Their combination of high-end features, compact design and seriously competitive pricing have left rivals like Canon, Nikon and Panasonic playing catch-up.</p>
      <p>Although it's been succeeded by the Sony A7 III, the A7 II remains an excellent full-frame camera thanks to an all-rounder feature set that remains competitive with today's rivals, plus a host of recent firmware upgrades.</p>
      <p>The A7 II combines a 24.3MP full-frame CMOS sensor, in-body image stabilization and a sharp 2.4-million dot electronic viewfinder to help frame your scenes. It also uses Sony's E-mount, which means it's compatible with both full-frame and APS-C format E-mount lenses, giving you a fantastic range of glass across all price points.</p>

      <p>Still trying to decide whether or not to go full-frame? While every camera is a compromise in some way, full-frame cameras like the Sony A7 II are a particularly good choice if you like to shoot regularly in low light, due to their superior dynamic range and image quality at high ISOs.</p>
      <p>They're also great for landscapes and portraits due to their shallower depth of field, which can produce some beautiful bokeh (or background blur).</p>
      <p>The Sony A7 II packs these traditional full-frame advantages and, thanks to Sony's firmware update, now offers phase detection AF for Alpha-mount lenses and improved raw files too.</p>
      <p>Considering it originally went on sale for £1,599 (body only), this is an unmissable deal if you've been considering going full-frame and taking your snapping to the next level in 2020.</p>
