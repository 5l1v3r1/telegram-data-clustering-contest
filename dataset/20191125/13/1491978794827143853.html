        <i>Well-preserved image of Leda and the swan was found during excavations last year</i>
      </p>
      <p>A fresco depicting an erotic scene from the Greek myth Leda and the Swan has been unveiled to the public for the first time in the ancient Roman city of Pompeii.</p>
      <p>The well-preserved fresco of the figure of Leda being impregnated by the Roman god Jupiter, disguised as a swan, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/19/take-me-to-your-leda-sensual-pompeii-bedroom-art-uncovered">was found last year during excavations of Regio V</a>, an area of the archaeological park <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/31/new-discoveries-at-pompeii-come-amid-renaissance-at-site">that has yielded several surprises</a>.</p>
      <p>Via del Vesuvio, the road on which the upper-class townhouse, or <i>domus</i>, containing the fresco is located, is also being reopened. Archaeologists believe the domus belonged to a rich merchant who wanted to reflect his high level of culture by adorning his home with myth-inspired frescoes.</p>
      <p>The image was fairly common in homes in Pompeii and the nearby Herculaneum, which were both destroyed when Mount Vesuvius erupted in AD79.</p>
      <p>Leda is an important figure in Greek mythology. She was said to have borne children fathered by Zeus, the Greek version of Jupiter, and by a mortal king of Sparta. According to myth, her children included the beautiful Helen of Troy and the twins Castor and Pollux.</p>
      <p>The restored Central Baths and House of the Golden Cupids are also being opened on Monday.</p>

      <p>It is unclear when Regio V, a 21.8-hectare (54-acre) site to the north of the archaeological park that was excavated as part of the EU-funded Great Pompeii Project, will be fully accessible to the public. The dig, which got under way early last year, was the most intensive at the site since the 1960s.</p>
      <p>One of the last discoveries was of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/11/pompeii-dig-unearths-fighting-fresco-gladiators-tavern">a fresco depicting fighting gladiators</a>. The fresco was found on a wall beneath the stairwell of what was probably a tavern frequented by gladiators and which provided accommodation on a higher floor for them to sleep with sex workers.</p>
      <p>Human remains have also been found, including the skeletons of two women and three children huddled together in a villa, as well as the remains of a harnessed horse and saddle.</p>
