      <p>Following their shock exit from the Telkom Knockout over the weekend, a Kaizer Chiefs official has apologised for the ‘shocking performance’ in Nelspruit.</p>

      <p>The Glamour Boys were beaten 2-1 by Maritzburg United on Sunday at Mbombela Stadium in the TKO semi-final, although it could have been more if it wasn’t for some heroics from young goalkeeper, Bruce Bvuma.</p>
      <p>Chiefs’ defeat means that the longest trophy drought in their history will be extended into 2020 and is likely to reach five years as they wait for their first piece of silverware since May 2015, and the club’s digital manager, Kaizer Motaung’s daughter, Kemiso, has admitted that the Amakhosi faithful ‘deserve better’.</p>
      <p>In a post on her Instagram account after the game, the club official said, “I apologize to all our supporters, people who travelled, our entire Amakhosi Family for the shocking performance today, u (sic) all deserve better.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, in a reply to South African personality, Sizwe Dhlomo, Motaung added, “We made some bad tactical decisions and we clearly underestimated them. Never get arrogant, this is something we should always remember. Normally we should have beaten them 10-0, but today could have been more embarrassing. We were just not ourselves!” </p>

      <p>Chiefs may be out of the TKO but are still 10 points clear at the top of the table following their fine start to the 2019/20 season, and have a chance to extend that lead this week when they take on Stellenbosch on Wednesday night as Ernst Middendorp looks for an immediate response. </p>
