      <h3>The Congress of Aboriginal Peoples wants the federal government to release demographic information of people placed under peace bonds, expressing concern that they are disproportionately applied to Indigenous people.</h3>
      <p>Section 810 orders — commonly known as peace bonds — are often used to <a href="https://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/cj-jp/victims-victimes/factsheets-fiches/peace-paix.html">protect victims of crime or members of the public in cases where there is reason to believe</a> that a person could cause physical harm or commit a sexual offence or an offence related to organized crime. They can have conditions attached, such as abstaining from drugs and alcohol or a prohibition on contact with certain people. Violating the conditions is a criminal offence.</p>
      <p>Peace bonds can last up to one year. Anyone who refuses to enter into a peace bond could be jailed for up to a year.</p>
      <p>The CAP intends to take the issue to the Canadian Human Rights Commission if its concerns are supported by data. The organization has also asked the Correctional Service of Canada and federal Department of Justice for information regarding the conditions under which the orders are signed, as well as the nature of the orders.</p>
      <p>“I fully believe that the majority of people are Indigenous people who fall under this Section 810,” CAP Vice Chief Kim Beaudin said in an interview.</p>
      <p>As examples, the CAP cites the case of a Saskatoon man who was placed under a peace bond after he was convicted of multiple violent offences. It also refers to what it says is criminalization of addictions and compulsive behaviours without adequate supports being provided.</p>
      <p>Curtis McKenzie is nearly finished his second federal sentence — two years plus one day — for two counts of breaching a recognizance to keep the peace, as well as breaking and entering and mischief. McKenzie was granted statutory release in 2017, then was returned to custody for breaching his release conditions and committing a new offence. He was released again in 2018 and signed a peace bond soon after, which he breached while intoxicated on methamphetamine.</p>
      <p>As an infant, McKenzie was placed in foster care, where he was physically and emotionally abused, parole board documents note. Older cousins introduced him to drugs and alcohol. The parole board commented that his history of mental health issues “remain unaddressed.” At one point, while in solitary confinement, he cut off his own nose with a razor blade and flushed it down a toilet.</p>
      <p>McKenzie said his time on the peace bond was stressful and overwhelming to the point that some of the conditions had to be removed.</p>
      <p>“When I was walking around, I felt like I was always being watched. I didn’t feel like I was free,” he said in an interview.</p>
      <p>“They did work with me, I’ll say that. They tried everything they could to keep me from getting in trouble with my issues.”</p>
      <p>Beaudin noted McKenzie was already staying at a halfway house, had a curfew and was subject to drug testing during his first release. He feels that adding the peace bond on top of this was essentially targeting McKenzie, he said.</p>
      <p>“They set him up for failure.”</p>
      <p>Beaudin said the CAP understands the orders’ use for protecting victims, but its use has been stretched to the point that it becomes unclear in some cases who is being protected.</p>
      <p>In a prepared statement, the Correctional Service of Canada (CSC) said that prior to the release of an offender at the end of a sentence, it must provide police all available information relevant to a perceived threat if there are reasonable grounds to believe the person poses a threat to any individual or the public. Police can then apply to the courts for a peace bond.</p>
      <p>The CSC’s statement said it can’t provide information about peace bonds and their application since the people subject to peace bonds are no longer in its jurisdiction. The decision to publicly disclose information or apply to the court for a peace bond rests with police, CSC said.</p>
      <p>The Department of Justice, in its own prepared statement, said it is not aware of a formal request from the CAP and that it does not collect data on peace bonds.</p>
      <p>In 2017, McKenzie was granted what he referred to as a “one-shot stat” — a statutory release from the Saskatchewan Penitentiary.</p>
      <p>While in provincial jail starting in 2013 on a 15-month sentence for assault causing bodily harm, he picked up a three-year sentence for aggravated assault with a weapon. He acknowledged that most of the charges he faced were violence-related.</p>
      <p>While out of custody, <a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/news/local-news/man-who-assaulted-officer-during-river-rescue-was-high-on-meth">he was high on meth and was found swimming in the South Saskatchewan River, calling for help and trying to get away from Saskatoon police.</a> He hit an officer in the face in the process. His lawyer told The StarPhoenix in August 2017 that McKenzie had been doing well during his release and had a job, but coped with stress by using alcohol and meth.</p>
      <p>He was returned to custody, then released again with one month left until his sentence expired. While subject to the bond he signed, in May 2018 he was found intoxicated by meth, breaching his conditions. The new charges resulted in the sentence he has nearly completed.</p>
      <p>McKenzie received statutory release in September with a residency condition. Speaking with the StarPhoenix that month, he said he was about to start a new job and was living at a halfway house in Saskatoon.</p>
      <p>He said he decided to speak out because of his concern that others don’t know much about peace bonds or their effects.</p>
      <p>“I hope they don’t do it to me again,” he said.</p>
