      <h1>Westpac must plan a staged exit for chairman Lindsay Maxsted and CEO Brian Hartzer</h1>

      <p>Oh to be a fly on the wall this week in meetings between Westpac chairman Lindsay Maxsted and the bank’s major shareholders.</p>
      <p>The outcome of these meetings will provide not only a test for Westpac’s board and management it will also test the reputations of these enormous money managers who we entrust with our retirement funds.</p>

      <p>Based on discussions with angry shareholders we should expect to see the bank go back to the drawing board and devise a staged exit plan for both its chairman Lindsay Maxsted and its chief executive, Brian Hartzer. Plus a board renewal plan.</p>
      <p>Just how far Westpac needs to go will become clearer this week when each of the major proxy firms (who advise major shareholders on how to vote) release their recommendations.</p>
      <p>Maxsted made it clear enough over the weekend that if shareholders are happy to retain the executive and board status quo that there will be no repercussions at senior levels for thecompany's egregious corporate governance breaches.</p>
      <p>Neither he nor the chief executive, Brian Hartzer are going to fall on their swords. They are going to battle it out for survival as long as they have a choice.</p>
      <p>Faced with the backlash Maxsted has assured stakeholders the bank has responded to the lack of compliance with Australian anti money laundering laws. Westpac will establish a new board committee, review executive bonuses, hire additional staff to deal with the problem and close the LitePay system that was linked to child exploitation.</p>
      <p>Indications to date suggest shareholders won't view this as sending a sufficiently strong message will require more than Westpac currently has on offer.</p>
      <p>Bear in mind that most of these major institutional investors undertake governance screening as a major part of their investment criteria. They make much of their responsible investment credentials.</p>
      <p>And even before the AUSTRAC scandal came to light last week some large investors were said to be unhappy with Westpac’s remuneration report.</p>
      <p>Westpac's only bargaining chip is that investors don’t want to take any action that will devalue their investment in Westpac. Last year they were happy enough to send board a message by, for example, voting down remuneration reports. But they would be less likely to push for a board spill.</p>
      <p>As Maxsted noted over the weekend he doesn’t want to destabilise the bank - a possible outcome if the board sacked the chief executive Brian Hartzer.</p>
      <p>But he is prepared to do it if retaining Harzter is more destabilising - in other words if investors decide to vote down the remuneration report and against all directors up for election at next month’s annual meeting unless Hartzer goes.</p>
      <p>But there are other destabilising events that are potentially coming down the pike. On Monday the Australian Securities and Investments Commission confirmed it had begun its own investigation into Westpac arising from Austrac’s actions.</p>
      <p>And theAustralian Prudential Regulation Authority will be looking at its own Westpac inquiry according to federal treasurer, Josh Frydenberg.</p>
      <p>His comments form only part of the mounting pressure on Westpac coming out of Canberra.</p>
      <p>Westpac has a problem because there is no internal candidate ready to seamlessly take over from Hartzer. Nor is there an obvious candidate to replace Maxsted as chairman.</p>
      <p>David Lindberg was generally considered to be the heir apparent inside the bank. However he took charge of the consumer bank in April this year and with only nine months under his belt he would be seen as a little green.</p>
      <p>The general consensus is that Maxsted was slated to retire from the board this time next year and would have been replaced by Peter Marriott - a trusted veteran banker.</p>
      <p>As the new chairman Marriott would have been charged with taking control of chief executive succession. In two years it Hartzer could have comfortably retired with $21 million in long term performance rights.</p>

      <p>But AUSTRAC’s explosive allegations (most of which have been accepted by Westpac) will surely disrupt this well designed succession plan.</p>
      <p>It would be surprising if Hartzer will survive at the helm of Westpac for another couple of years.</p>
      <p>Additionally there is a risk that shareholders will vote down Marriott’s re-election to the board next month if he is considered tainted by the AUSTRAC allegations.</p>
      <p>And it isn’t just governance concerns that will occupy the minds of major investors. Shareholders that just pumped $2 billion into Westpac’s coffers, via a placement at $25.32 are now under water based on Monday’s share price of $24.42.</p>
      <p>And it now seems likely that a large portion of those funds will be needed to pay for the Austrac fine. And some of the leftover change will be used to clean up the mess.</p>
