      <p>It’s not been a good week for animals all over the world. At first, we heard about Iman the last Sumatran Rhino was on her deathbed, before she passed away yesterday, officially marking the extinction of the Sumatran Rhino in Malaysia. And today, due to massive bush fires that are happening in Australia which caused the deaths of hundreds of koala bears, this species is now considered to be functionally extinct.</p>

      <p>“Functionally extinct” means that currently so few pairs of koala that it’s almost impossible for them to produce a new generation. Despite the efforts by the Australian government, they couldn’t do anything to save hundreds of koala bears who lost their lives in the fire. <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Brushfires-ravage-Australia-s-fragile-koala-14837447.php#photo-18608150">SFGATE</a> reported that volunteers who went through the forests in the hopes of finding for any survivors only found dead koalas.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <b>“As many as 350 koalas have already been killed but more will most probably die due to dehydration or they will starve to death.”</b>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Koalas rely on eucalyptus leaves for their water source but the fires have destroyed their habitat alongside their food and water sources. Koala bears were already considered “vulnerable to extinction”  as us humans have been clearing their forests, and their numbers were below 20,000. Previous estimates had them going extinct by 2050 but after this devastation, they could be reclassified as endangered in the state of New South Wales.</p>
      <p>Koala Conservation Australia President Sue Ashton had a simple yet heartbreaking statement in response to this event,</p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>“I don’t know how we are going to come back from this “</b>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>Should we be disappointed? Should we be sad? The main thing here is that these animals had no one but us to protect them, and sadly, we have let them down.</i>
