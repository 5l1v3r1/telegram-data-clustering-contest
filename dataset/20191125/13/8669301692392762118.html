      <p>The Indian archers overcame all odds to ensure two medals in the recurve and compound mixed event of the Asian Archery Championships in Kolkata on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Competing under a neutral flag with the Indian federation being suspended, the Indian archers opened their account with a bronze medal in the recurve mixed pair event, where Atanu Das and Deepika Kumari defeated Yichai Zheng and Shaoxuan Wei of China 6-2 without breaking a sweat.</p>
      <p>But, it was the compound mixed pair team of Abhishek Verma and Jyothi Surekha Vennam who produced a stunner, ousting Korea 159-154 in a one-sided affair to set up a gold medal clash with Chinese Taipei, slated for Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The team eliminations are also scheduled to start on Wednesday while Indian women will also vie for Olympic quotas in the qualification round on Thursday.</p>
