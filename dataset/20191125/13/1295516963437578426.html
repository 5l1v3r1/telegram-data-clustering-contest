      <h1>Thanos Wears Different Armor in Rejected Avengers: Endgame Concept Art</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T13:11:16+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 13:11</time> by <a rel="author">Berek Bigos</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/avengers-4/"><i>Avengers: Endgame</i></a> concept artist Jerard Marantz has unveiled new concept art showing off several unused versions of the Mad Titan Thanos' armor.</p>
      <p>"Here’s my early design pass on Warrior Thanos for <a href="https://screenrant.com/thanos-name-avengers-infinity-war-endgame/amp/"><i>Avengers Endgame</i> and </a><i>Infinity War,</i>" Marantz wrote. "In this design I went a bit more spartan and got some good traction with the Russo Brothers. Though I do like this version, I am very proud of the final armor design. I feel like it was a good call and that the armor I designed in film matched Thanos’s character much more than in this pass. You can catch this work and more in the art of <i>Endgame</i> book. So many incredible pieces in there from so many insanely talented artists."</p>

      <p>In a separate post, Marantz revealed updated armor with a bulkier look, writing, "Close to final design for Thanos’s warrior armor in [<i>Endgame</i>] and [<i>Infinity War</i>]. From the waist up the design is what showed up in the film. I changed up the armor on the legs and the loincloth and swapped out the weapon. This was an incredible challenge."</p>
