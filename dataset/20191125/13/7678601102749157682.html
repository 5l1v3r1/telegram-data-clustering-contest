      <h1>Starting today, rented e-scooter users face US$17 fine for riding them on Jakarta's roads</h1>

      <p>Starting Monday, people who rent electric scooters and ride them on roads and bicycle lanes outside the area designated for micromobility vehicles in Jakarta will face a fine of up to Rp 250,000 (US$17.69).</p>
      <p>Jakarta Police spokesperson Sr. Com. Yusri Yunus said electric scooters could only be used in several designated areas such as the Gelora Bung Karno (GBK) sport complex in Senayan, Central Jakarta, and Soekarno-Hatta International Airport in Tangerang, Banten.</p>
      <p>"Violators could face a one-month jail sentence and a maximum fine of Rp 250,000." Yusri said as quoted by <i>kompas.com.</i></p>
      <p>The penalty is in accordance with articles 282 and 104 of Law No. 22/2009 on traffic and transportation.</p>
      <p>The sanction, however, so far only applied to those who rented electric scooters from GrabWheels ─ managed by ride-hailing company Grab Indonesia ─ as people who had their own micromobility vehicles could use them on the capital city’s bicycle lanes, Antara news agency reported.</p>
      <p>The restriction has been implemented amid the Jakarta administration’s ongoing process in drafting a regulation for the use of electric scooters following the deaths of two riders in a traffic accident on Nov. 11.</p>
      <p>The proposed regulation includes, among other things, that users should ride the scooters at a maximum speed of 20 kilometers per hour, that they should be 17 years or older to be able to ride the vehicles, that the scooters may not be used on sidewalks and footbridges, and that users must also comply with safety rules such as wearing helmets.</p>
      <p>Electric scooters have gained immense popularity in the capital city ever since Grab Indonesia launched the electric scooter sharing service in Greater Jakarta several months ago.</p>
      <p>The vehicles, however, have come under public scrutiny, mainly due to riders’ behavior while using the scooters.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month a footbridge over Jl. Sudirman in Central Jakarta was damaged after several e-scooter riders went over the bridge. Many riders have also reportedly ignored safety measures by using the scooters without a helmet and having more than one person on a scooter . (nal)</p>
