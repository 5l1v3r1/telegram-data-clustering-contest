      <h1>Crackdown feared amid Malaysian Shiite arrests</h1>

      <p>Dozens of Shiites have been rounded up recently in Sunni Muslim-majority Malaysia, including several foreigners, fuelling fears that religious authorities are stepping up a crackdown on adherents of the minority sect.</p>
      <p>Around the world, Shiite Muslims – who are far outnumbered by Sunnis, and follow some different doctrines and rituals – say they face discrimination from authorities and others who accuse them of being deviants.</p>
      <p>About 60 per cent of Malaysia’s 32 million people are Muslim and the country is also home to substantial minorities of Hindus and Christians, and the different communities have largely co-existed harmoniously.</p>
      <p>Critics, however, say that a traditionally moderate brand of Islam is being eroded as vocal conservatives gain ground, and the small Shiite community – whose teachings have been banned in Malaysia for over two decades – complain of ever-greater pressure.</p>
      <p>In September religious enforcement officers and police raided a series of clandestine gatherings by Shiites commemorating Ashura, which marks the seventh-century killing of Prophet Mohammed’s grandson.</p>
      <p>Syed Mohamad said that a 20-strong raiding party scaled a fence and burst into their rented premises in southern Johor state while a small group of Shiites prayed on the holy day.</p>
      <p>“It sparked fear among the worshippers. The women and children began crying,” he said.</p>
      <p>“There were four men with face masks . . . One of them had a gun and they accused me of not cooperating and threatened to assault me.”</p>
      <p>Syed was handcuffed and held overnight, along with seven other worshippers including a Singaporean and a Yemeni, and he now fears being charged in an Islamic court.</p>
      <p>He could face up to three years in jail and a fine under Islamic law for practising the Shiite form of Islam. Malaysia operates a dual-track legal system, with Islamic courts handling some religious and family matters for Muslim citizens.</p>
      <p>In another raid near Kuala Lumpur, community leader Kamil Zuhairi Abdul Aziz and 21 other Shiites were rounded up at the centre he runs while prayer books and speakers were seized.</p>
      <p>Such raids, which have been happening on and off since 2010, have “created a climate of fear among the Shiite community”, the 53-year-old said.</p>
      <p>Shiites say they have faced frequent persecution in Malaysia since a top Islamic body issued a fatwa against them in 1996, and religious authorities regularly denounce them as “deviant”.</p>
      <p>There is no official estimate for the numbers of Shiites in the country, with many too frightened to identify themselves, but observers believe there are between 100,000 and 500,000.</p>
      <p>There had been a lull in substantial raids for some time until this year, however, with some attributing the spike to tensions between Shiites and Sunnis in the Middle East, which can spill over to other Muslim countries.</p>
      <p>“We do not want any misunderstanding among Muslims in Malaysia or for fights to break out [between Sunnis and Shiites],” said Mohamad Zawawi Ahmad Mughni, a member of the official Islamic religious council in Selangor state. “Shiite activities cause discomfort among Sunnis in Malaysia.”</p>
      <p>Mohamad Faizal Musa, a Malaysia-based associate with Harvard’s Weatherhead Centre for International Affairs and an expert on the minority, predicted the country’s Shiites and Sunnis would not be able to overcome their differences any time soon.</p>
      <p>“I doubt that can be done with the amount of vilification and harassment [against the Shiites],” he said.</p>
