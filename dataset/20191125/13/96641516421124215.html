      <p>Fighting a crowd the day after Thanksgiving isn't for everyone. If you'd rather avoid the chaos and shop from the comforts of home, we've got you covered. Walmart <a href="https://www.walmart.com/store/3520/secaucus-nj/weekly-ads">revealed its Black Friday deals</a> already, a mix of gadgets for gaming, TV streaming and more. There are also lucrative gift card offers when you buy a new phone, and that amount can increase if you have a worthy trade-in. We've listed the links to current product pages below. The deals go live online at 10PM ET on Wednesday, November 27th and they'll be available in-store on Thanksgiving Day at 6PM local time (except for the phone offer).</p>
      <h3>Oculus Go</h3>

      <p>The standalone VR headset <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/05/01/oculus-go-review/">impressed us when we reviewed it in May</a>, and now it's an even more affordable way to get into virtual reality. The Oculus Go is typically $199, but will be <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Oculus-Go-Standalone-Virtual-Reality-Headset-32GB-Oculus-VR/296029684">on sale this week for $149</a>. This is for the 32GB model and remote. The Go is more comfortable than other "self-contained" VR headsets like the Gear VR, and it's able to tap into Oculus' large library of VR apps. Both performance and battery life could be better, but the Oculus Go is a solid deal at $149.</p>

      <p>If you're looking to add some connectivity and voice control to your phone, the Google Smart TV Kit is an easy way to do just that. The "kit" includes <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/07/24/google-chromecast-at-five/">a Chromecast</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/10/13/google-home-mini-review/">Google Home Mini</a> so you can harness the power of Google Assistant in your living room. This duo typically goes for $64, and has been $55, but Walmart <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Google-Smart-TV-Kit-Google-Home-Mini-and-Chromecast-Walmart-Exclusive/719650769">is offering it for $35</a> this week.

      <p>We aren't shy about our love for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/07/15/instant-pot-guide/">the Instant Pot</a> here at Engadget, and for good reason. It's a versatile home appliance that's capable of a lot of things. And it's even more attractive when it's on sale. Walmart will have <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Instant-Pot-DUO60-6-Qt-7-in-1-Multi-Use-Programmable-Pressure-Cooker/45918917">the 6-quart Instant Pot Duo for $49</a> this week.

The 6-quart version has enough capacity for families of 4-6 people, according to the spec sheet.</p>
