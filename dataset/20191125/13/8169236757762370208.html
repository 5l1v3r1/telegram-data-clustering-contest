      <p>This is shocking for a player of Jones’ experience at the highest level, and surely shows he just cannot be trusted by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer again.</p>
      <p>Jones has played 220 games for Man Utd and has 27 England caps, and glaring mistakes like this surely just mean he’s unlikely to come back from the dramatic decline he’s suffered in the last few years.</p>
