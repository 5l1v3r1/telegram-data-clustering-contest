      <p>A Labour supporter has been hospitalised with a suspected broken jaw after he was attacked on a doorstep.</p>
      <p>The 72-year-old was out canvassing in Hellaby, Rotherham, when he was assaulted.</p>
      <p>A man, 51, has since been arrested on suspicion of grievous bodily harm.</p>
      <p>Tony Griffin, 62, said the man suffered injuries to his jaw and teeth during the incident.</p>
      <p>“I don’t know exactly what this other person did apart from he punched him and damaged his jaw to the point where he can’t eat properly at the moment and needs dental work to a couple of teeth that have been chipped," Mr Griffin told <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/labour-campaigner-assault-arrest-election-hellaby-rotherham-yorkshire-a9216646.html">The Independent.</a></p>

      <p>“I’ve stood on doorsteps quite close to him while he’s been saying what he says, he’s just a nice old bloke really.</p>
      <p>"He’s the sort of person you can’t imagine saying something difficult or offensive.</p>
      <p>“I sent him a message last night and he said he was determined to be back out canvassing today, depending on how it fitted in with his dental appointment. That’s just the sort of person he is.</p>
      <p>“I can’t imagine him saying ‘boo’ to a goose. He is over six foot tall but a gentle giant.</p>
      <p>“His vision is not fantastic and he doesn’t walk with a stick all of the time but we are not talking about someone who can run away very easily.”</p>

      <p>Mr Griffin, who knows the man from the campaign trail, has been canvassing since the 70s during the first EEC referendum.</p>
      <p>He said he's noticed a change in people's attitudes towards campaigners since the Brexit referendum in 2016.</p>
      <p>Sarah Grant, chair of Rotherham constituency Labour Party, tweeted on Sunday evening: “My 72 year old comrade, who has a walking stick, was assaulted today door knocking in Hellaby in the Rother Valley constituency.</p>
      <p>“He is currently at Rotherham District General Hospital undergoing treatment for facial injuries.”</p>
