      <h1>EU countries back tough line on 5G suppliers in potential blow to Huawei</h1>
      <h2>Including vetting the domestic legal framework to which they are subjected.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T13:43:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 13:43</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.itnews.com.au/author/foo-yun-chee-348634" target="_blank">Foo Yun Chee</a></address>
      <p>EU countries on Friday endorsed a tough line for selecting 5G suppliers, including vetting the domestic legal framework to which they are subjected, potentially dealing a blow to telecoms equipment market leader Huawei Technologies.</p>
      <p>Ambassadors meeting in Brussels agreed to the approach, a spokeswoman for Finland, which currently holds the rotating EU presidency, said in a tweet.</p>
      <p>EU countries should consider non-technical factors such as the legal and policy framework to which suppliers may be subject in third countries, a draft document seen by Reuters ahead of the meeting said. The document did not mention any specific countries or companies.</p>
      <p>EU governments should also diversify their suppliers and not depend on one, the document said. EU ministers will give the green light to the approach at a meeting next month.</p>
      <p>The United States has urged the EU to ban Huawei equipment, saying that its gear could be used by China for spying. Concerns have focused on a Chinese law on domestic companies' cooperation with the government on security matters, with critics saying that these could compel them to be a vehicle for Chinese spying.</p>
      <p>The Shenzen-based company, which competes with Finland's Nokia and Sweden's Ericsson has denied the U.S. charges and dismissed the concerns as groundless.</p>
      <p>Last month, the EU warned of the risk of increased cyber attacks by state-backed entities but did not name any company or country. The bloc sees 5G networks as key to boosting economic growth.</p>
      <p>The EU is now looking into a so-called toolbox of measures by the end of the year to address cyber security risks at national and bloc-wide level. The European Agency for Cybersecurity is also finalising a map of specific threats related to 5G networks.</p>
