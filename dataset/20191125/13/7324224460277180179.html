      <p>A last-minute surge in people registering to vote is expected ahead of the deadline on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>Applications can be submitted until 11.59pm on November 26.</p>
      <p>Nearly three million people have applied to register to vote in the past month, according to Government figures.</p>
      <p>More than a third of those applications (35%) have come from people under the age of 25.</p>

      <p>A further 30% have come from people aged 25 to 34.</p>
      <p>By contrast just 4% have been submitted by people aged 65 and over.</p>
      <p>Of the 2.98 million applications submitted between October 24 and November 24, the biggest spike was on November 22 when nearly 308,000 were recorded.</p>
      <p>An increase in applications is not direct evidence of an increase in the number of people able to vote.</p>
      <p>At previous elections there have been applications from people below the legal age to vote or who are already on the electoral register.</p>

      <p>Nonetheless, the volume of applications suggests a growing interest in participating in the election.</p>
      <p>To be able to vote in the General Election on December 12, a person must be registered to vote, aged 18 or over on polling day, and also be either a UK or Irish citizen or a qualifying Commonwealth citizen resident in the UK.</p>
      <p>Applications to register to vote can be made online at gov.uk/register-to-vote.</p>
