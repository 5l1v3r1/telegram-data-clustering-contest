      <p>The driver of the UK truck that was <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/23/police-find-39-bodies-in-the-back-of-a-truck-in-southern-england/">found with 39 dead bodies</a> in the back pleaded guilty Monday to helping an illegal immigration ring.</p>
      <p>Maurice Robinson, 25, appeared at the Old Bailey in London via video link from Belmarsh prison, where he pleaded guilty to plotting with others to assist illegal immigration and acquiring criminal property.</p>
      <p>He was not asked to enter pleas on the most serious charges â€” <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/27/uk-death-truck-driver-charged-with-39-counts-of-manslaughter/">39 counts of manslaughter</a>. He was remanded into custody until his next court hearing on Dec. 13.</p>
      <p>Robinson, who is known as Mo, was arrested shortly after the bodies of eight females and 31 males were found in a trailer attached to his Scania cab in Essex on Oct. 23.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/08/uk-officials-name-all-39-truck-death-victims-including-10-teens/">victims were identified as Vietnamese</a> nationals, including two 15-year-old boys and eight other teens.</p>
      <p>Eamonn Harrison, 22, has also been charged with 39 counts of manslaughter, one count of a human trafficking offense and one count of assisting unlawful immigration. He is currently in custody in Ireland as Essex police try to get him extradited for trial in the UK.</p>
      <p>On Friday, police announced that Christopher Kennedy, 23, was <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/24/third-man-charged-with-human-trafficking-over-39-found-dead-in-uk-truck/">charged with conspiracy</a> to arrange or facilitate the travel of people with a view to exploitation and conspiracy to facilitate the commission of a breach of UK immigration law.</p>
