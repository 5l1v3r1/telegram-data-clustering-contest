        <b>Manchester City are expected to be without striker Sergio Aguero for "a few weeks", according to boss Pep Guardiola.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Argentine sustained the injury during Saturday's 2-1 win against Chelsea, with Guardiola unclear as to the exact nature of the problem.</p>
      <p>In his press conference to preview Tuesday's Champions League clash with Shakhtar Donetsk, Guardiola said: "Sergio will be out for a few games, a few weeks. I don't know exactly.</p>
      <p>"(The injury) is at the front."</p>
      <p>Gabriel Jesus can expect to feature more prominently in Aguero's absence, and he said: "I am not happy Sergio is injured.</p>
      <p>"I don't like it when my friends are injured, but every day I work hard and I am ready."</p>
      <p>Manchester CityÂ will be through to the knockout phase of the Champions League if they avoid defeat against Shakhtar or if Dinamo Zagreb do not beat Atalanta.</p>
      <p>City will be confirmed in top spot if they win, or if they draw and Dinamo do not win.</p>
      <p>Guardiola said: "The position we have is good but we have not qualified yet. Tomorrow is a chance."</p>
