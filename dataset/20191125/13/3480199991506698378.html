      <p>Nigel Richards won the Mattel World Scrabble Championship for the second year running after a 140-point score helped him across the finish line.</p>
      <p>Mr Richards, from New Zealand, beat Australian-born David Eldar 3-1 in a best-of-five match to claim the title and the 8,000-US dollar (£6,200) prize money.</p>
      <p>The world number two, who has more than 20 years of Scrabble experience, competed against opponents from more than 15 countries to land the trophy.</p>
      <p>The titanic tussle took place at Torquay Riviera Centre on Sunday, with the defending champion playing ‘GHOSTIER’ for 140 points en route to victory.</p>
