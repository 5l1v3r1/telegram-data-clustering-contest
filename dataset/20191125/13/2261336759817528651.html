      <h1>Video: Nick Diaz refuses to groin kick a guy for money, reveals he’s ‘fighting again soon’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T13:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author">Anton Tabuena</a></address>
      <p>Nick Diaz’s Instagram has been very active — and pretty crazy — during his hiatus from mixed martial arts. What he shared Sunday night was just a tad bit weirder, as the former Strikeforce champion was roaming the streets of New York.</p>
      <p>It started out from Diaz selling four jiujitsu gis online for $50 each, to eventually being asked to kick a fat guy in the balls for money.</p>
      <p>He refused, and instead paid part of the sum to a bouncer, who would do the kicking instead. In the middle of all the madness, Diaz revealed that he is going to fight again soon.</p>
      <p>Watch the clip below.</p>

      <p>“That’s really not my thing. I don’t want to hurt people,” Diaz said as he refused the offer. “I could, but also, I don’t want to hurt myself. I’ve got big news coming up. I’m about to be fighting again soon.”</p>
      <p>In a separate Instagram Story, Diaz explained the financials of the groin kicking fiasco, before saying he will be going back to Las Vegas to meet with the UFC soon.</p>

      <p>After a <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/11/12/20961532/ufc-mma-news-interview-nick-diaz-president-dana-white-comeback-fight">pretty concerning interview on ESPN</a>, Diaz went on <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/11/16/20967784/nick-diaz-to-jorge-masvidal-give-fans-that-real-s-t-they-want-to-see">to call out Jorge Masvidal again </a>on social media. The “BMF” champ then responded to say that <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/11/18/20970636/ufc-mma-news-social-media-instagram-jorge-masvial-nick-diaz-fight">it would be an “honor” to fight the older Diaz brother</a>.</p>
      <p>Both parties seem to want that fight, but honestly, <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/11/12/20961051/hope-springs-eternal-the-nick-diaz-delusion">it might not be a very good idea to book that </a>match up.</p>
