      <p>The National Bureau of Statistics’ (NBS) report, showed that GDP grew by 2.28 per cent (year-on-year) in real terms in the third quarter of 2019.</p>
      <p>The financial expert said that with this development, he expected the committee to be firm in what would make the country sustain or improve its current GDP.</p>
      <p>He said the partial border closure by the Federal Government must have contributed to this significant increase in the GDP.</p>
      <p>Eohoi said he was not surprised because if there was an increase in domestic production as a result of high demand, it would boost GDP.</p>
      <p>According to him, the lending rate should remain as it is and the committee should continue to observe the inflation rate.</p>
      <p>Eohoi added that inflation should be a determinant whether there was a need to review it or not.</p>
