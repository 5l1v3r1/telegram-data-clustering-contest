      <p>Dell's seasonal sales have started to roll out, and these XPS Black Friday deals offer up to $250 off the incredibly powerful laptop range. For as little as $999 you're getting one of the year's most popular laptops (we recently rated it as the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/mobile-computing/laptops/best-laptops-1304361">best laptop of 2019</a>), with a specification that can take on anything a power user could throw at it. With the week leading up to <a href="https://www.techradar.com/black-friday/best-2019-black-friday-deals">Black Friday</a> already underway, here's a closer look at the amazing laptop you could be picking up at an even better price. </p>
      <p>The XPS range offers a rarely lightweight design for a laptop of this caliber. That means all that power under the hood won't leave you with house-bound laptop. Instead you've got the best of both worlds with anything up to a 10th generation i7 processor, 16GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD all sitting in an ultra-thin shell. </p>
      <p>The display really is something to behold, as well. An InfinityEdge design keeps bezels skinny but a number of laptops are also offering such full-screen features. Where the XPS shines is in its 4K Ultra HD resolution options, packing 8 million pixels onto your display with an anti-reflective screen and 400-nit brightness. </p>
      <p>At up to $250 off, these Dell XPS Black Friday deals are not to be missed, but in case you're looking for something a little different, you can check up on our regularly updated <a href="https://www.techradar.com/black-friday/black-friday-laptop-deals-the-best-prices-this-year">Black Friday laptop deals</a> selection.</p>
