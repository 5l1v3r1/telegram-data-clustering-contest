      <h1>Ranbir Kapoor and Alia Bhatt's 'Brahmastra' to have an 'Avengers' connect?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T13:04:41+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 13:04</time> by <a rel="author">TIMESOFINDIA.COM</a></address>
      <p>Ayan Mukerji’s '<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Brahmastra">Brahmastra</a>', fronted by <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Ranbir-Kapoor">Ranbir Kapoor</a> and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Alia-Bhatt">Alia Bhatt</a>, and features <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Amitabh-Bachchan">Amitabh Bachchan</a>, Nagarjuna and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Dimple-Kapadia">Dimple Kapadia</a> in central roles is one of the most awaited films of 2020. The fantasy adventure that has its roots in <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Hindu-mythology">Hindu mythology</a>, has had fans brimming with excitement to see how this one unfolds on the big screen. Considering that the film will be nothing short of a visual spectacle, with its state of the art VFX, the latest reports doing the rounds reveal what may be the underlining plot.</p>
      <p>According to reports, the first part of the trilogy will revolve around the mythological weapon called Brahmastra. Said to be much like the Avengers, where the good guys battle it out with the villains to piece together this source of power, the film will reportedly see its lead protagonist discover the fire within him, much like Lord Shiva.</p>
      <p>As we have heard before, the film takes a lot of references from Indian mythological tales and has its principal characters meeting for the first time in Varanasi.</p>
      <p>High on VFX, the film will also see <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Shah-Rukh-Khan">Shah Rukh Khan</a> making a cameo for which he shot over 7-8 days.</p>
      <p>Initially set to release in December 2019, the film will now hit screens in the summer of 2020.</p>
