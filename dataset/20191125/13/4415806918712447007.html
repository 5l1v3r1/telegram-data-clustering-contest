      <h1>Amazing pictures show firefighters tackle blaze in emergency exercise at Cork airport</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T13:34:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 13:34</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/digital-desk-staff/" target="_blank">By Digital Desk staff</a></address>
      <p>Cork airport held an emergency exercise with multiple first response agencies as part of the airport's preparedness to respond in the event of an emergency in the dark.</p>
      <p>As part of the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) requirements, emergency services must be conducted at regular intervals and reflect the operational hours of the airport, including hours of darkness.</p>
      <p>It is also required by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and the Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) airport licencing regulations to conduct a twice yearly exercise to test its response to a major aircraft incident.</p>
      <p>The exercise took place between 7pm and 10pm but had no impact on any commercial flight operations.</p>
      <p>The exercise involved a scenario where a Boeing 737-800 had developed a technical issue with the plane's undercarriage hydraulic system. The aircraft's captain advised air traffic control that they suspected a significant hydraulic leak and were declaring an emergency.</p>

      <p>Cork Airport's emergency plan was initiated, while the aircraft upon landing, suffered an undercarriage collapse of the port side landing and gear causing an uncontained engine fire.</p>
      <p>Airport fire and rescue operations began, backed by colleagues from the Cork city and county fire services, the HSE Ambulance Services and An Garda Síochana.</p>
      <p>Chief Fire Officer at Cork Airport, Ken Roberts said: "“We carry out exercises to test contingency plans and the co-ordination of the response to a major incident on a regular basis with key stakeholders.</p>
      <p>"This exercise is one of a number of routine exercises within our Business Continuity Exercise Programme at Cork Airport, organised to test our response and that of the Emergency Services and other partners with our Crews.</p>
      <p>"I am deeply appreciative of the inter-agency response and co-operation we enjoy on an ongoing basis."</p>
