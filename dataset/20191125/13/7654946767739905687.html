      <p>This flight was a real high-wire act.</p>
      <p>A pilot in Minnesota is lucky to be alive after crashing his Piper Cub into power lines and remaining suspended upside down until rescuers freed him, <a href="https://www.scottcountymn.gov/civicalerts.aspx?AID=623">officials said</a>.</p>
      <p>“This incident could have been much worse,” Scott County Sheriff Luke Hennen said. “We are grateful the pilot was able to walk away without any injuries.”</p>
      <p>The pilot and sole occupant, identified as 65-year-old Thomas Koskovich, was flying south near Shakopee in rural Minnesota about 4 p.m. Saturday when his single-engine plane struck the wires.</p>
      <p>Emergency responders deactivated the power to the lines and brought the pilot safely to the ground.</p>
      <p>The FAA said it was investigating the mishap, which occurred about 25 miles southwest of Minneapolis.</p>
