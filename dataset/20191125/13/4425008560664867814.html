      <h2>Over damage to country's cybersecurity standing and investment.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T13:39:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 13:39</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.itnews.com.au/author/ry-crozier-149259" target="_blank">Ry Crozier</a></address>
      <p>IBM Australia has issued a rare critique of Australian government policy, urging a review of anti-encryption laws framed by the damage they are causing to the country’s security investment and image.</p>
      <p>In a submission to Home Affairs’ 2020 cyber security strategy consultation [<a href="https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/reports-and-pubs/files/cyber-strategy-2020/submission-96.pdf">pdf</a>], IBM said the Telecommunications (Assistance and Access) Act 2018 had “created concerns about Australia’s ability and commitment to embrace the most effective cybersecurity policies and technologies.”</p>
      <p>In particular, IBM said the laws had “undermined” previous work by the government to create a “regulatory environment that promotes strong cybersecurity without constraining innovation or digital commerce.”</p>
      <p>“Strong encryption represents a critically important cyber security technology,” IBM Australia said.</p>
      <p>“It underpins data security identity management and protection of devices against unauthorised access. It also plays a crucial role in defending critical infrastructure systems.</p>
      <p>“Security experts around the world recognize that empowering law enforcement agencies to build technology to counter encryption will result in a weakening of the encryption technology in use.”</p>
      <p>IBM specifically criticised the existence of Technical Assistance Notices, which compel providers with <a href="https://www.itnews.com.au/news/crypto-bill-adds-pub-test-for-warrants-drops-revenue-justification-512886">an “existing means to decrypt”</a> communications to use it to aid law enforcement.</p>
      <p>The vendor urged a review of the notice regime.</p>
      <p>“To position the Australian Government to embrace technologies that will best protect Australia from malicious cyber attacks, IBM urges the government to review the provisions of the … Act to clarify the important and potentially damaging consequences for cyber security investment in Australia, particularly those that arise from the current operation of Technical Assistance Notices,” it said.</p>
      <p>IBM said that encryption would be important to 5G as well as to ongoing development of the internet of things. </p>
      <p>“As Australia embraces 5G technology for example, encryption - and end-to-end encryption, particularly - will take on even greater importance as a way to protect massive volumes of data traversing increasingly decentralized potentially untrusted network infrastructure,” IBM said.</p>
      <p>IBM has previously been a constituent to industry group submissions that criticised the anti-encryption laws, but hasn’t previously weighed in by itself.</p>
