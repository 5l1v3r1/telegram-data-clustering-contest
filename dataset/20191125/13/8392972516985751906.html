      <h1>Gemma Collins trolled over make-up disaster as GMB viewers ask why she's 'painted her nose brown'</h1>
      <h2>They're calling for her make-up artist to be sacked</h2>

      <p>Diva Forever star <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/gemma-collins/">Gemma Collins</a> has been targeted by trolls following her appearance on <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/daytime-tv/good-morning-britain/">Good Morning Britain</a>.</p>
      <p>The star – who is set to make a return to <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/dancing-on-ice/">Dancing On Ice</a> for the show's Christmas special – chatted about the latest showbiz stories as she appeared on the show.</p>
      <p>However, while she did let slip that she "can't wait much longer" for on-again boyfriend James Argent to propose, viewers only had one thing on their minds.</p>

      <p>Appearing on the show before 7am, it appears Gemma's make-up artist could've been feeling a little sleepy as they got to work on the star.</p>

      <p>They missed a crucial bit of blending when it came to Gemma's contouring.</p>

      <p>Others called for the make-up artist in question to be "sacked".</p>

      <p>Some also wondered if Gemma had done her make-up "in the dark".</p>

      <p>Gemma has yet to respond to the comments, but we expect the star is too busy to even notice she's been trolled.</p>
      <p>It was recently revealed Gemma had <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/gemma-collins/gemma-collins-axes-plans-to-release-christmas-single-with-producer-pal/">ditched plans to release a Christmas single</a> after not having any time to finish it.</p>
