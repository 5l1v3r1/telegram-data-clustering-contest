      <p>Cyberpunk 2077 is a forthcoming role-playing game from the house of CD Projekt Red, the developers of the famous Witcher series. As the developer has been working on this game for over half a decade now, we are in a better position to know what the players in this game can do. The announcement of the game came about as early as 2012 and during the last seven years, news about <a href="https://www.technobezz.com/cd-projekts-cyberpunk-2077-release-date-features-rumors-and-news/">Cyberpunk 2077</a> projected it as a leviathan of a game, which is bigger than their previous game, The Witcher 3. Finally, in the E3 2018, the hour-long demonstration showed a myriad variety of systems of Cyberpunk, the combat and the progression of the characters.</p>
      <p>The same demo was also shown elsewhere and was opened for the public only to be picked from one frame to another. It is an open-world game, which is set in the technologically-driven metropolis of Night City in Northern California. The year of the game is 2077 and is based on the pen-and-paper tabletop Cyberpunk, the brainchild of Mike Pondsmith.</p>
      <h3>Cyberpunk 2077 Release</h3>
      <p>CD Projekt Red, the developer of the game, is yet to come out with a rock-solid confirmation regarding the release date of the game. Although the developers have provided a range of time for the release of Cyberpunk 2077 between 2017 and 2021 along with another unannounced role-playing game, the exact date seems to be a far cry. In short, we have to still wait to get the confirmed date. For now, we can keep guessing that Cyberpunk 2077 is probably going to release in 2019 as a tweet from a Turkish publisher showed the 2019 release date.</p>
      <p>We are already aware that CD Projekt Red is focusing on the present generation of consoles apart from PC offering the team of developers more time to get it out of the door. The guesswork about the 2019 release of Cyberpunk 2077 is substantiated by the comments from the financial results conference of March 2017 during which the developers CD Projekt Red announced that the progress of the game is at the advanced level.</p>
      <p>While going into behind the scenes of Cyberpunk, based on the latest video from PlayStation, the mystery may no longer remain as work on the game is nearing its end although it is not exactly clear whether Cyberpunk 2077 is slated for 2019 release or we can expect it much later.</p>
      <p>The other point of speculation is that the head writer of CD Projekt Red left for Blizzard in early 2019, meaning the story is complete at this point although nothing is guaranteed. Apart from this, there are rumors that Cyberpunk 2077 is going to be at E3 2019. The hopes are that it is going to be a playable and public demo this time, and if it is true, we can expect the release to come in late 2019 or during the early next year.</p>
      <h3>Exploring the world of Cyberpunk 2077</h3>
      <p>For those who are familiar with Blade Runner series of the films, you can think about all things modern and futuristic such as the technologically advanced computer systems, the cybernetic plants, an array of future stuff and relate it with the world of CyberPunk 2077.</p>
      <p>Night City, the venue of the game is going to get a fresh lease of life with the busy crowd technologies that the developer has created even though it might not be as gregarious as the postcards appear. There is no exact procedure in the city, and the world here is likely to be large with a plethora of vehicle areas to explore especially the buildings. Certain areas of the Night City may require diplomacy and wit if you do not want the enemies to engage in a war.</p>
      <p>Corporations seem to have taken over and are in open combat while the gangs who are believers of implants may be shown fighting over territory. With the collapse of the government, the men, women, and children in Night City are left to themselves in the war zone that is segmented into different sectors. Our journey in Cyberpunk 2077 begins in the aftermath scenario of the Fourth Corporate War.</p>
      <h3>Latest news of Cyberpunk 2077</h3>
      <p>According to the recent tweets from the Cyberpunk Twitter account, there are a few shocking tidbits about the game and the first one is that Cyberpunk 2077 is going to make its appearance in E3 2019 and we have already mentioned this before. It is not going to be exclusive to the Epic Games Store. Further revelations of the Twitter account is that the players cannot join gangs while playing Cyberpunk 2077.</p>
      <p>While the game is not probably going to be in the multiplayer mode, Jackie, one of the sidekicks of 2077 is a male character regardless of your gender, and there are going to be female companions in the game as well. If the Jerry Seinfeld GIF is considered an indication, micro-transactions in the game is going to be absent. During a conversation with a Polish publication in January 2019 with CD Projekt Red about the departure of the creative director and writer Sebastian Stepien, the developers revealed that it has not affected the game as the entire team comprises over 400 people. It is a huge jump for the developer from the mere 250 staff of Witcher 3.</p>
      <h3>Your role in Cyberpunk 2077</h3>
      <p>Wondering what to do in Cyberpunk 2077? You are going to control the character, also called V, either a female or a male customized to fit your temperament. You can even name V and use a surname or a forename for that and dive into the dystopian world, thinking it to be the blank canvas. You may also come across plenty of options for tattoos and hair.</p>
      <p>Your job is to carve out a niche for yourself while starting as someone making money at the expense of ethics and gradually climbing the ladder of a criminal.Â  You may have a lot of strengths and other characteristic traits and may abstain from locking yourself into a strict class system. Eventually, you may become a fearful heavy gun wielder or a technologically advanced ninja assassin. Several classes can be seen from the tabletop version of Cyberpunk although the only thing in control of the player is V for maximizing the skills of Techie, Netrunner, and Solo. Depending on your approach towards the combat, dialogue, and quest, Cyberpunk is generally going to determine the path on which you move.</p>

      <p>The developer of Cyberpunk 2077 has a reputation for the creation of immersing worlds that are filled with unique storylines, exciting experiences, and unique characters. Due to the enormous amount of time taken by the team of developers, it can hint that we are in for something that takes us into the Cyberpunk Universe. You may have weapons that can be used for eliminating the enemies, vehicles that are fit to be driven, and people in romantic relationships as well.</p>
      <h3>Cyberpunk 2077 is an FPS</h3>
      <p>Cyberpunk 2077 is undoubtedly an FPS game as it includes a chunk of first-person shooting even though the cutscenes and driving often switch to the third person. There are several actions involving the guns, and everything moves with blazing speed although the scenes appear less expensive when compared with Doom. During the opening moments of the demo, the firefight shows the primary character V bent quickly around the cover only to shower bullets on a gang of organ scavengers. Similar to Destiny 2, the numbers indicate how the damage explodes with each shot, although the enemies do not feel like the bullet sponges. The agility of V is an added attraction.</p>

      <p>There is a lot of versatility to be noticed in the potential of V in the demo that shows her as a talented and fast-paced cyber ninja. While she could slide and run to cover besides triggering a slow-motion bullet-time mode. A quick dash allowed her to burst into a targeted direction, and with the amalgamation of the dash and the bullet time, she could put the enemies on to one side and deliver those deadly shots. In the demo, we have also encountered some damn cool weapons apart from the guns even though the guns are in plenty. With a Tech Shotgun that is street-modified, it is easy to penetrate through the enemies and the cover that appear to be a deadly combination when paired with the upgraded optic implant of V that showed her the enemies through the objects. Another one is a Smart Rifle that exhibits its ability to shoot by firing bullets that track the enemies. When you aim into a general direction, it will automatically lock multiple targets for firing the rounds on the tracked targets.</p>
      <h3>Romantic relationships in Cyberpunk 2077</h3>
      <p>Yes, you can pursue romances as the main character V as Cyberpunk goes into character creation, so there is likely to be diverse romance option exceeding the feel you got in the Witcher series.</p>

      <h3>Maturity rating of Cyberpunk 2077</h3>
      <p>Cyberpunk 2077 is certainly not going to be for the kids and has a high maturity rating. During the first few minutes of the demonstration, V is shown rescuing a woman who was kidnapped by the organ scavengers, and she was found completely naked in the bathtub, although the game did not pull back or shrunk from here while showing full nudity. What was shown as swearing appeared to be those masturbation jokes? The game resembles the style of those cable shows that show a lot of nudity and swearing.</p>
      <h3>Gameplay adapted to tabletop</h3>
      <p>As an FPS and RPG game, Cyberpunk 2077 focuses on shooter mechanics and Cyberware offers the players with the potential to employ enhanced abilities for performing crazy moves such as sending the projectiles around the corner.</p>
      <p>It appears that CD Projekt Red is trying to connect all the aspects of the game together. For those who intend to customize the user interface, which is powered by the operating system, they need to buy an upgrade. The ad display you encounter during the travel can allow you to download the questline. The attempt of the developer to include exploration in Witcher 3 is likely to be seen in Cyberpunk 2077 as well. Instead of taking the Roach everywhere, the experience of driving in Night City brings a new lease of life.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Due to the setting, gunplay in Cyberpunk 2077 is a prominent aspect instead of the swordplay. However, the development of V depends entirely on the gamers and will dictate the enjoyment in the RPG game. You are granted the ability to choose situations, missions, enemies. Whether to enter quietly or move in with the guns, the experience is completely amazing.</p>
      <h3>Cyberpunk 2077 characters</h3>
      <p>A lot is known about the character creation from the demo which begins from selecting your sex and thereafter you can customize tattoos, clothing, and hair. However, you may not be able to change the bone structure of the character. Apart from this, the stats can also be changed as the basics are Intelligence and Strength another stat that measures the ability to handle stress. The backstory can also be changed, which affects the way in which the characters regard you and opens a wide choice and story moments.</p>

      <h3>Working of the dialogue</h3>
      <p>Even though we are not sure, the dialogue in Cyberpunk 2077 is likely to happen in real-time. While you can move and look around, the dialogue options appear on the screen when you focus back on the camera. With three to four options in the other RPG games, this system may not be as robust as expected.</p>
      <h3>Unlocking the abilities of Cyberpunk 2077</h3>
      <p>The implants in Cyberpunk 2077 are cool with ricochet bullets for killing the enemies behind the cover. Apart from this, the user interface element can show you the path of the bullet so that the shots can be lined up perfectly. Besides this, there are mantis-like sword arms of V that can be used for removing the internal organs of the enemies. There are robots to be remotely controlled and Spiderbot that can climb the ceiling and the walls.</p>
      <h3>Cyberpunk 2077 environment</h3>
      <p>Whether in or out of the combat, there are several ways in which one can mess with the environment. In the open world, you can touch the advertisements for the products. During combat, there are destructible elements in different areas. In one of the fighting scenes, V was shown to shot the lift while holding a car to drop it down at the ground level.</p>
      <h3>Feel and look of the Night City</h3>
      <p>Due to the impressive crowd technology, the Night City in Cyberpunkâs 2077 seemed to be bustling and alive. The scene is which V walks through the streets while watching the activities of hundreds of other characters is quite impressive.</p>

      <h3>Multiplayer or not?</h3>
      <p>It seems now that the game might feature multiplayer as the developer CD Projekt Red has created a partnership with a multiplayer-focused studio for technology in Cyberpunk 2077 and no micro-transactions in Cyberpunk 2077 as the little Easter egg confirms in<a href="https://www.technobezz.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-to-launch-at-e3-2018-possible-trailer-and-hd-screenshots/"> E3 2018</a>.</p>
      <h3>Driving cars in Cyberpunk 2077</h3>
      <p>Yes, for sure, you can drive vehicles in the first and third person. The fictional metropolis called Night City featured in this games includes six districts with no leading screens between them. According to the developers, the game is likely to include plenty of vehicles.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The final take</b>
      </p>
      <p>Now, that is quite an optimistic description of the game, and more updates are likely to come in the future as well. Whether it is to find out new approaches about the game, you must not miss the hidden catches. Plenty of things are likely to come and go, but it is the spirit of the game that is going to keep you on your feet right now until the actual, and the confirmed date of release is out.</p>
