      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T13:08:42+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 13:08</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/regional/north-central/365098-lg-polls-police-redeploy-officers-in-niger.html" target="_blank">Agency Report</a></address>
      <p>The police command in Niger State has redeployed divisional police officers across the 25 Local Government Areas of the state to ensure neutrality in the November 30 local government elections.</p>
      <p>The Commissioner of Police in the state, Adamu Usman, made this known in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Minna on Monday.</p>
      <p>Mr Usman said that the police and other security agencies would maintain neutrality to enable eligible residents to elect leaders of their choice through a democratic process.</p>
      <p>He said that already, an effective operational order to provide security at each of the polling units had since been issued to the officers deployed for that purpose.</p>
      <p>He said that other sensitive security measures had since been taken to enable eligible residents participate in the electoral process.</p>
      <p>“We have mobilised sufficient armed personnel to provide security cover at all the polling units and collections centres during and after the elections,” Usman said.</p>
      <p>The commissioner also said that the command had already embarked on “Operation Show Force’’ with other security agencies to show preparedness for the elections.</p>
      <p>He explained that the measures were aimed at giving the residents of the state the opportunity to exercise their civil rights without threat to lives and property.</p>
      <p>The commissioner advised leaders of political parties in the state to impress it on their supporters to shun all forms of violence and thuggery before, during and after the election.</p>
      <p>Mr Usman said: “We will not tolerate any act capable of bringing confusion before, during and after the elections”.</p>
      <p>He warned that any person or group found sponsoring political violence and thuggery would be arrested and prosecuted.</p>
