      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T13:36:29+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 13:36</time> by <a rel="author">Leena Sidat</a></address>
      <p>This Black Friday weekend, Devonshire Living is offering fantastic deals on furniture and home accessories at its Bideford showroom.</p>
      <p>From Friday, November 29 to Monday, December 2, 2019, the retailer will have additional discounts on various selected ranges and products that you really won't want to miss out on.</p>
      <p>Popular existing clearance ranges, Como and Coniston, will have extra discounts on the whole range over the weekend, as well as amazing special offers on the current ranges, Hanover and Copenhagen.</p>
      <p>The Black Friday sale prices on Devonshire's current ranges, particularly, will be at its best and lowest to date - so head down to the showroom to take full advantage before the sale ends on Monday.</p>
      <h3>Continued growth</h3>
      <p>Over the past year, rapid evolution means Devonshire Living is now better placed than ever to meet the market's needs.</p>
      <p>The solid wood furniture specialist ceased manufacturing in Devon, opting instead to focus attention on the business' sourcing, importing and wholesaling operations, while maintaining its finishing plant, enabling it to maintain the delivery of superior finishes for which it is known across the country.</p>

      <p>After 27 years of service, Devonshire Living's owner, Peter Hockin, retired, handing the baton to his daughter Nicolle, who has big plans for the business.</p>
      <p>Nicolle said, "The change at Devonshire has only just begun. I'm spearheading a new strategy designed to make us fit for the future, while preserving our rich legacy."</p>
      <p>Visitors to the Bideford showroom in the coming months will see a whole new upgraded and refurbished layout, as well as new living, dining and bedroom ranges.</p>

      <p>Exclusively created by award-winning designers, the new ranges feature solid woods, veneers and high-quality paint finishes, and will join other ongoing developments that employ on-trend materials such as concrete, marble, rattan, metals and other timbers.</p>
      <p>Nicolle added, "We're working with multiple designers to produce our new ranges. We're not aiming to compete with the low-end market; we pride ourselves on supplying our customers with great quality furniture that's built to last, and exceptional service. Although, we will of course still be offering factory seconds and end of line clearance furniture at incredible bargain prices."</p>

      <p>The company has also introduced a brand upgrade, a new website with the option of buying clearance furniture online, and is constantly searching for new ways to improve service to customers, such as adding a new coffee machine for customers, and looking to add music to the store.</p>
      <p>Nicolle concluded, "I'm looking forward to driving the business forward even further in 2020. Devonshire Living deserves to be in pole position."</p>
      <p>Devonshire Living's showroom is located at Caddsdown Industrial Park, Clovelly Road, Bideford, Devon, EX39 3DX.</p>
