      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/halsey/">Halsey</a> might not have been nominated for any awards at the 2020 Grammys, but she did pick up a prize at the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/25/selena-gomez-looks-fierce-neon-prepares-support-taylor-swift-american-music-awards-11212671/">American Music Awards</a> on Sunday night.</p>
      <p>The 25-year-old won the award for Favourite Song Pop/Rock with her track Without Me and on thanking fans for voting for her, Halsey pretty much threw shade at the Grammys for their snub.</p>
      <p>On picking up her gong, she launched into a huge speech about how she used to think winning awards gave artists validation for all the hard work they put in to writing music, but actually she doesn’t think they’re ‘what they seem’ now she’s older.</p>
      <p>She explained: ‘The truth is I am older now and I’m also an artist… most of these awards really aren’t what they seem at all. But that’s OK and I’m up here right now and I’m so thankful for the AMAs because they are the world’s largest fan voted award show.’</p>

      <p>She went on: ‘I’m thankful to the fans because they are the people who really give a sh*t about music. And I’m thankful to the AMAs for giving those people a voice. I’m going to keep making music for them and for us.</p>
      <p>‘Sometimes you grow up and the stuff that you believed in starts to lose its magic, but the music never does because real fans, real artists and real stories keep that magic alive.’</p>
      <p>Fans were quick to tweet about her speech and decided that Halsey was pretty much dragging the Grammys.</p>

      <p>The nominations for next year’s Grammy Awards were revealed last week and Halsey was noticeably absent from the list, despite Without Me becoming a Billboard Hot 100 number one.</p>
      <p>Halsey’s fans were kicking off about her snub on Twitter, prompting her to respond herself and she admitted not being nominated had left her pretty upset.</p>

      <p>She tweeted: ‘my fans please do not waste your anger or frustration. i see a lot of you are upset. of course im sad too. none of it matters. literally none of it.</p>
      <p>‘you’re here. im here. + everything is gonna stay exactly the same and without me is still a super tight, record breaking song.</p>
      <p>‘congrats to the nominees. so much great music nominated this year. definitely see a lot of my friends and colleagues missing from the nom lists, but the music speaks! this is how it goes every year right?’</p>
