      <p>Bwire felt the game was tough for both sides. Contrary to what the official claimed, Simba secured a comfortable 3-0 win thanks to a brace by Miraji Athuman and one goal by Tyrone Santos.</p>
      <p>The Msimbazi Street-based club have reclaimed their top spot in the process in the ongoing league season.</p>
      <p>Miraji beautifully flicked header from Shomari Kapombe’s cross gave Simba, nicknamed the Msimbazi Reds, the lead on the 37th minute.</p>
      <p>Brazilian defender Santos doubled his side's advantage two minutes after the restart, powering home from Francis Kahata’s corner kick delivery that was not well dealt by Ruvu Shooting defense.</p>
      <p>Miraji grabbed his brace and his sixth goal of the season when he connected home another good delivery from Kahata 16 minutes from stoppage time.</p>
      <p>The results extended Ruvu Shooting’s winless run against Simba to 17 games since September 2010 which is a run of 16 losses and one draw.</p>
      <p>In a post-match interview, Bwire was left feeling hard done by after the results. He expressed his belief that luck has played a huge part in Simba's latest victory.</p>
      <p>“It is true we have lost against Simba. The game was tough for both sides, not just Ruvu Shooting. I don’t think they have been much better than us. It’s a fortunate result for Simba,’’ Bwire noted.</p>
      <p>“Was there any beauty? Did you see any build up in their goals? They scored through counter attacks, I think we matched them in every department but we were unfortunate to lose.’’</p>
      <p>The Coast Region-based side has 72 hours to dust themselves off and regroup for Monday’s fierce derby against JKT Tanzania, who also lost their Friday’s match against Young Africans (Yanga).</p>
