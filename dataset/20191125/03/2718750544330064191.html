      <p>There are some moments that truly render a person speechless: a gorgeous sunset, a toddler’s first words, and [<i>checks notes</i>] <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/camila-cabello-romance-new-album.html">Camila Cabello</a> and <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/taylor-swift-lover-remix-featuring-shawn-mendes-listen.html">Shawn Mendes</a> almost making out at the 2019 American Music Awards. The pop couple took to the AMA stage to perform their duet “Señorita,” soon to be crowned Best Collaboration, and one moment toward the end of performance proved <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EKLqc0fWsAIF5wn.jpg">particularly jaw dropping for seatmates Billy Porter and Taylor Swift</a>. Porter and Swift, obviously besties after <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/06/taylor-swift-you-need-to-calm-down-video-easter-eggs.html">filming the music video for “You Need To Calm Down,”</a> simply could <i>not</i> believe the heat that emanated from Cabello and Mendes and <a href="https://twitter.com/MTVNEWS/status/1198779254969905153">did not try to hide it</a>.
