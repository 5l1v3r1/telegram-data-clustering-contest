      <p>Mirielle, a five-year-old spayed cat who came to the SPCA as a stray, is looking for her new home.</p>
      <p>"This girl is a spunky calico cat who's looking to find a family as adventurous as she is," said Chelsea Taylor, Vernon SPCA branch manager. "Affectionate and charming, Mirielle is one of a kind. She's not a big fan of other cats and would much rather be the only queen of the castle."</p>
      <p>For more information about Mirielle and other animals available for adoption, <a href="https://spca.bc.ca/locations/vernon/">visit the Vernon SPCA online</a>.</p>
