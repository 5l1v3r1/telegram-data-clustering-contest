      <p>A nurse and a psychiatrist have been disciplined after convincing a vulnerable patient to sell his house to one of them.</p>
      <p>The man was admitted to hospital and underwent a five-day medical detoxification programme.</p>
      <p>During a post-stay medical assessment, the nurse and psychiatrist discussed the man needing to sell his house due to a relationship break-up.</p>
      <p>The man and his ex-wife later sold their house to the psychiatrist, with the nurse staying in frequent contact with the man to organise the sale of the property.</p>
      <p>Afterwards, the man said he felt manipulated and pressured into selling his house and that the staff took advantage of when he was in a vulnerable situation.</p>
      <p>A report released Monday from Mental Health Commissioner Kevin Allan has found the psychiatrist and a nurse failed to maintain professional boundaries with their patient.</p>
      <p>"This case has reinforced the importance of professional boundaries in a clinician-patient relationship and demonstrated how engaging in financial transactions with a patient can compromise the therapeutic relationship," Allan says.</p>
      <p>He says the psychiatrist and nurse should both apologise to the man and complete relevant training.</p>
      <p>He also advised that the Medical Council consider whether a review of the psychiatrist's competence was appropriate and that the Nursing Council do the same in regards to the nurse.</p>
