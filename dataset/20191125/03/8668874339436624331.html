      <h1>'How do you eat an elephant? It's piece by piece' - Saracens want European success despite survival scrap</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T03:16:48+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 03:16</time> by <a rel="author">By Online Editors</a></address>
      <p>Brad Barritt insists <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/saracens">Saracens</a> are capable of retaining the Champions Cup alongside succeeding in their desperate fight for <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership">Gallagher Premiership</a> survival.</p>
      <p>The double winners are reeling from the 35-point deduction received for being in breach of salary cap regulations and enter Friday’s clash with <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/bath">Bath</a> 26 points adrift of 11th-place Leicester.</p>
      <p>Director of rugby Mark McCall must prioritise the Premiership while contending with the loss of a host of players to the Six Nations, but after sweeping aside the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/ospreys">Ospreys</a> 44-3, Barritt insists continental glory remains a viable objective.</p>
      <p>“Europe is still an incredible focus for us,” said the club captain and former <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/england">England</a> centre, who made his comeback from six weeks out with concussion at Allianz Park on Saturday.</p>
      <p>“We are still going into this competition wanting to win it. If we can get into a quarter-final, all bets are off.</p>
      <p>“If there are three or four guys who can’t play on a weekend, so be it. But make no mistake, this Saracens team wants to win this trophy.</p>

      <p>“The challenge now is different in that the last three or four years, Europe has been a priority.</p>
      <p>“If players were available, we were trying to position them for Europe. This time we have got to unearth some new talent, other players not exposed to that level before.</p>
      <p>“What will result from this is being a really unified and together bunch. There’s going to be adversity throughout the season.</p>
      <p>“We’ve had challenges along the way over the last 12 years that I’ve been here. This is going to be as unique a challenge as any club’s going to face.</p>
      <p>“But what I can say of my playing group and the leadership group around me is we are a hugely resilient bunch and a team that’s going to fight to the end.”</p>
      <p>Barritt insists Saracens must take a pragmatic approach to securing top-flight survival.</p>
      <p>“An old Sarries colleague used to say, how do you eat an elephant? It’s piece by piece,” he said.</p>
      <p>“We can’t look further than we can see at this point. If we are too focused on what happens in May or June, we are going to get ourselves into trouble.”</p>
