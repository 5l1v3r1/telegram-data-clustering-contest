      <h1>Australia: Mining capex to offset non-mining capex weakness - ANZ</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T03:56:40+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 03:56</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fxstreet.com/author/dhwani-mehta" target="_blank">Dhwani Mehta</a></address>
      <p>Analysts at Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ) offer a sneak peek at what to expect from Wednesday’s Australian Q3 Capex data that will drop in at 0030 GMT.</p>
      <h3>Key Quotes:</h3>
      <p>“When the Q3 private new capex data comes out on Thursday 28 November, we expect there will have been a small (0.3%) q/q rise. This would follow a cumulative fall of 1.8% over the previous two quarters.</p>
      <p>We could see a downward revision to non-mining firms’ investment growth plans for 2019-20, with the weakness in business conditions worsening in Q3. This would be consistent with our Capex Leading Indicator (Figure below).</p>
      <p>In more positive news, mining recorded its strongest quarterly capex result in five years in Q2. We expect mining firms’ plans for a significant expansion in capex in 2019-20 will be largely unchanged in Q3, with a number of multi-billion-dollar iron ore projects locked in.</p>
      <p>This would see total capex plans (including both mining and non-mining) upgraded to AUD121bn in Q3, which would imply a 6.1% y/y increase.</p>
      <p>A new estimate of AUD125bn or above would signal that firms remain optimistic about capex plans, despite headwinds. However, a new estimate of AUD118bn or below would raise concerns that the weakness in business investment may be more entrenched.”</p>
