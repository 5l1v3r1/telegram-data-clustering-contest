      <p>In addition to the new entertainment venues and guest room enhancements, the resort is expected to feature a myriad of premier facilities and amenities.</p>
      <p>The premier facilities include a 110,000 sq ft casino complete with slots, table games, high-limit gaming areas, private gaming salons, dedicated poker room, and a 14,000 sq ft entertainment zone, which includes a race and sports book and features live entertainment; two resort towers housing 3,500 guest rooms; 350,000 sq ft of meeting and banquet space; a 27,000 sq ft world-class spa; a 220,000 sq ft pool complex with seven unique pool experiences including a 1,800 sq ft infinity pool with spectacular views of the Las Vegas Strip; a 100,000 sq ft West Tower LED screen (one of the largest LED building displays in the world), and 19,000 sq ft East Tower LED screen; and an extensive food and beverage portfolio featuring a wide range of cuisine from authentic street food to Michelin star dining, including concepts new to the Las Vegas Strip.</p>
      <p>The portal said Resorts World Las Vegas will seamlessly blend the technology and luxury appeal of an urban contemporary resort with the traditions and time-honoured details of the Resorts World brand.</p>
      <p>"From a lush outdoor pool oasis with bold accents and rustic textures, to an interior colour palette of warm gold and cream hues, each space will have its own identity and will be equally as inviting and immersive as it is unique," it said.</p>
      <p>Resorts World Las Vegas is being developed by Genting, which has been registered as a publicly traded corporation by the Nevada Gaming Commission. Resorts World Las Vegas has affiliated integrated resorts in the Americas, Malaysia, Singapore, the United Kingdom and the Bahamas.</p>
