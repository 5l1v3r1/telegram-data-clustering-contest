      <p>After announcing that Underwood had earned her sixth career trophy in the Favorite Album - Country category, Cobie Smulders and Michael Ealy, stars of the TV series "Stumptown," surprised the Oklahoma native with news that she had also been named Favorite Female Artist - Country.</p>
      <p>"So, it's a good surprise. OK, I was worried for a second," Underwood said with a laugh.</p>

      <p>She tearfully accepted her 14th and 15th career AMA trophies, fervently thanking her husband and their two sons, her team, her label and especially fans. The American Music Awards is billed as the world’s largest fan-voted awards show.</p>
      <p>"Thank you, God, for the talents that you give people, the gifts that you give people, and not just the people that are up here on this stage. For every single person, we all have gifts, and thank you for them. We hope we use them to make the world a better place," she said.</p>
      <p>With her win in the Favorite Album - Country category, Underwood earned the unique honor of having all her studio albums win that prize.</p>
