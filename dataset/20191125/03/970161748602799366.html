      <p>Jenna Dewan looked simply divine as she stepped out, with her baby bump in tow, to attend the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/american-music-awards/">American Music Awards</a>.</p>
      <p>The pregnant star was spotted showing off her growing bump on her arrival and was a total vision in a fitted, floor-length, fuchsia pink dress that made sure to highlight her mumma-to-be glow.</p>
      <p>Wearing a lip colour to match her red carpet outfit choice, Jenna left her hair down in cool waves and posed by cradling her stomach.</p>
      <p>She joined a whole host of stars at this year’s awards, including the likes of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/dua-lipa/">Dua Lipa</a> and boyfriend Anwar Hadid, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/lizzo/">Lizzo</a>, Taylor Swift, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/25/shawn-mendes-camila-cabello-cant-keep-hands-off-amas-performance-arriving-solo-red-carpet-11212778/">Shawn Mendes and Camila Cabello</a> and Selena Gomez.</p>

      <p>Jenna announced her pregnancy news back in September and has since revealed how her daughter took the news she’s set to become an older sister.</p>
      <p>Speaking on The Ellen DeGeneres show, Jenna said: ‘I knew [Everly] would be happy because she’s been asking for this. ‘But as soon as she found out she started crying. She was like, “This is the best day of my life!”’</p>

      <p>Jenna and Everly’s dad Channing split after nine years of marriage in April 2018. She began dating Steve just months after, while Channing has moved on with singer Jessie J.</p>
      <p>Nearly two years after their split, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/channing-tatum-jenna-dewans-divorce-finalised-almost-two-years-split-11192741/">the former couple’s divorce has now been finalised</a>. A judge has reportedly granted their request to legally separate while they discuss custody agreements and a property settlement.</p>
      <p>Channing, meanwhile, has allegedly been <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/24/jenna-dewan-told-ex-channing-tatum-about-pregnancy-before-announcement-as-he-supports-baby-news-10802430/">nothing but supportive of Jenna’s pregnancy news. </a></p>
      <p>Jenna had told her Step Up co-star she was expecting before publicly announcing she was having another baby.</p>
      <p>‘Jenna told Channing that she was pregnant and wanted to make sure he knew before she announced it,’ an insider claimed to E! News. ‘He is happy for her and was very supportive.’</p>
