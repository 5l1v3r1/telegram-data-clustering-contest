        <b>Ekta Kapoor has just dropped the most-awaited promo of Naagin – Bhagya Ka Zahreela Khel where Nia Sharma and Jasmin Bhasin are seen playing the vicious game, even as Vijayendra Kumeria gets stuck between the ‘icchadari naagins.’ Are you excited to watch Naagin 4?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ekta Kapoor’s supernatural show, Naagin has always been one of the most favourite shows in the Television industry. The show is no less than a Bollywood big-budget film. Be it Mouni Roy, Ada Khan, or Anita Hassanandani and Surbhi Jyoti, these Naagins have already mesmerized us with their zahreela beauty and charm, now, it’s Nia Sharma and Jasmin Bhansin’s turn to do the same. On that note, here’s the new promo of the Naagin 4 or Naagin – Bhagya Ka Zahreela Khel which was recently shared by Ekta Kapoor on her Instagram handle, making us impatient about the show.</p>
      <p>Nia Sharma and Jasmin Bhasin are gearing up to play a vicious game while Vijayendra Kumeria gets stuck between the ‘icchadari naagins.’ In the promo, Nia is seen in the market when a goon tries to touch her. On seeing this, Vijayendra comes to her rescue and smashes the goon’s face. However, when he finds Nia missing and her dupatta on the ground, the moment he lifts up the dupatta, he is shocked to see a serpent popping out of it. Seeing the snake running into an old mansion, he follows and finds the two Naagins Nia and Jasmin approaching towards in order to harm him. Watch the promo below:</p>

      <p>As the promo reveals the two Naagins, we also see another serpent in the promo, leaving us to wonder if there is going to be a third Naagin as well. Nevertheless, after the promo was uploaded, previous Naagin Anita Hassanandani was the first to comment on it where she was all heart. While the first Naagin, Mouni Roy who was a little nostalgic too commented on it by saying, “Reminded of season first. Mythical magical. Can’t wait!” We also saw the OG Naagin, Sayantani Ghosh who found it ‘superb.’</p>
