      <p>Mto-wa-Mbu Police Station has hosted the event.</p>
      <p>The two teams that are to face each other during the forthcoming ‘Usalama Derby Cup’ in Mto-wa-Mbu will be made of commercial cyclists, the three wheeled and two-wheeled motorcycle taxi operators.</p>
      <p>“The target is reinforce peace and harmony among local residents of this valley which previously suffered serious crimes against humanity including robbery, rape and mysterious murders of women,” the event’s organizer, Peter Ngollo, said.</p>
      <p>Motorcycles, coming in both the two-wheeled (Boda boda) and three-wheeled (Bajaj) types, are the common modes of transport in Mto-wa-Mbu area and now these riders will be pitched for the soccer competition on November 29.</p>
      <p>The event will be played at Barafu grounds in Mto-wa-Mbu Township, and ward mapped within the Monduli District. The green valley area is also famous for rice, banana and potatoes’ faming.</p>
      <p>Ngollo, the Officer in Charge of the Mto-wa-Mbu Police Station (OCS), is of view that sports will help bring people together because they intend to form ‘citizen on patrol’ strategy to ensure that the precinct remains a safe haven.</p>
      <p>“Meeting on informal grounds, makes it easy for residents to divulge sensitive information to the police, people do not want to report matters to police stations but when they come into contact with officers in friendly environment they tend to open up easily,” he pointed out.</p>
      <p>Kuruthum Hassan, the Ward Executive Officer, disclosed that the youths who work as motorcycle riders have managed to form groups that will also assist in maintaining peace in the locality.</p>
      <p>“I also take this chance to praise the police officer for bringing young people together, creating a very united group of youths who will assist in divulging sensitive information should anything sinister occur,” she stated.</p>
      <p>Mdachi Hassan, the chairperson of the Bajaj riders in the precinct, said that crime cases have been reduced since the riders started organizing community based events.</p>
      <p>On his part, Kelvin Michael, the leader of Boda-Boda riders’ group, said his team is mostly made up of young people which means they are more energetic than the three-wheeled motorcycle riders’ lot.</p>
      <p>“We shall trash them black and blue,” he boasted.</p>
