      <h1>Why Cann, Collection House, Nufarm, &amp; Wagners shares are tumbling lower</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T03:07:41+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 03:07</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fool.com.au/author/jamesmickleboro/" target="_blank">James Mickleboro</a></address>
      <p>The S&amp;P/ASX 200 index has given back a portion of its early gains, but remains on course to start the week with a gain. In afternoon trade the benchmark index is up 0.3% to 6,732 points.</p>
      <p>Four shares that have failed to follow the market higher are listed below. Here’s why they are tumbling lower:</p>
      <p>The <b>Cann Group Ltd</b> <a href="https://www.fool.com.au/company/Cann+Group+Ltd/?ticker=ASX-CAN">(ASX: CAN)</a> share price has crashed 22.5% lower to 57 cents. Late last week the cannabis company revealed that it would be staging the commissioning of its Mildura facility in response to weaker demand. Investors appear concerned that Cann Group may never generate the level of revenue it forecast previously.</p>
      <p>The <b>Collection House Limited</b> <a href="https://www.fool.com.au/company/Collection+House+Limited/?ticker=ASX-CLH">(ASX: CLH)</a> share price is down 6% to $1.14. Investors have been selling the receivable management company’s shares after it <a href="https://www.fool.com.au/2019/11/25/why-the-collection-house-share-price-is-sinking-lower-today/">announced</a> the sudden departure of its managing director and chief executive officer, Anthony Rivas. Collection House revealed that it has promoted CFO Doug McAlpine to the top job with immediate effect.</p>
      <p>The <b>Nufarm Limited</b> <a href="https://www.fool.com.au/company/Nufarm+Limited/?ticker=ASX-NUF">(ASX: NUF)</a> share price is crashing lower on Monday and is down 18% to $5.07. Investors have been selling its shares due to a costly <a href="https://www.fool.com.au/2019/11/25/why-the-nufarm-share-price-has-plummeted-18-today/">accounting error</a>. When reconciling accounts with German customers for the 2019 calendar year, Nufarm identified additional sales rebate claims from customers. This is expected to result in a $9 million impact to its first half EBITDA. In addition to this, it warned that trading conditions have been difficult in FY 2020.</p>
      <p>The <b>Wagners Holding Company Ltd</b> <a href="https://www.fool.com.au/company/Wagners+Holding+Company+Ltd/?ticker=ASX-WGN">(ASX: WGN)</a> share price is down 7% to $2.04. This morning the building supplies company provided an update on its dispute with <b>Boral Limited</b> <a href="https://www.fool.com.au/company/Boral+Limited/?ticker=ASX-BLD">(ASX: BLD)</a>. According to the release, Wagners was expecting a resolution of its dispute with Boral in court this week. However, the trial has been adjourned until February.</p>
