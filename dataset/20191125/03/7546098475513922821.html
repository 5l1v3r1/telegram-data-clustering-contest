      <h1>How I would spend $20,000 on ASX shares this week</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T03:31:35+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 03:31</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fool.com.au/author/sbowen/" target="_blank">Sebastian Bowen</a></address>
      <p>Happy Monday! With the <b>S&amp;P/ASX200</b> <a href="https://www.fool.com.au/company/S%26amp%3BP%2FASX200/?ticker=ASX-XJO">(ASX: XJO)</a> index opening higher this morning, it seems the share market has grasped the new week with an optimistic tone. After last week’s sell-off, it’s certainly a welcome change to have the index in the green today.</p>
      <p>With this enthusiasm taken on board, here’s how I would spend $20,000 on ASX shares this week.</p>
      <h3>National Australia Bank Ltd <a href="https://www.fool.com.au/tickers/ASX-NAB/">(ASX: NAB)</a></h3>
      <p>NAB shares have been caught up in the AUSTRAC disaster that has engulfed <b>Westpac Banking Corp</b> <a href="https://www.fool.com.au/company/Westpac+Banking+Corp/?ticker=ASX-WBC">(ASX: WBC)</a> over the last week, with the bank losing nearly 4% off the top of its share price. Still, there is nothing out there linking Westpac’s misfortunes with NAB and so I think this dip might be a good buying opportunity.</p>
      <p>With NAB’s new annual dividend of $1.72 per share, this bank is offering a starting yield of 6.55% (or 9.36% grossed-up). For this yield alone, I think NAB is a solid buy today, despite the ongoing pressures the banking sector is facing.</p>
      <h3>Pact Group Holdings Ltd <a href="https://www.fool.com.au/tickers/ASX-PGH/">(ASX: PGH)</a></h3>
      <p>Pact Group shares are up 9% today to $2.72 (at the time of writing), despite no official news coming out of the company. PGH shares have spent most of 2019 trending lower, not helped by a series of earnings downgrades that the company has been forced to endure.</p>
      <p>However, these downgrades have primarily been caused by higher input costs, which I expect Pact will be able to pass on to its customers in time. Therefore, I think this stock was oversold, and now may be returning to a fair share price. Thus, today might be a good time for any value investors out there to pick up some Pact shares.</p>
      <h3>iShares S&amp;P 500 ETF <a href="https://www.fool.com.au/tickers/ASX-IVV/">(ASX: IVV)</a></h3>
      <p>Another option worth considering today is this S&amp;P 500 ETF. The S&amp;P 500 index follows the largest 500 companies on the US markets, and with this ETF you are getting a small slice of each.</p>
      <p>Warren Buffett himself advocates this particular index, calling it a piece of America, so who am I to argue. I also think it’s a great choice for the tiny fee IVV charges – just 0.04%. With last week’s sell-off, adding to an index fund like IVV could be a prudent choice this week.</p>
      <h3>Foolish takeaway</h3>
      <p>With these 3 shares, I think we are getting some of the best deals the markets are offering as we start another week off. I’m tempted by NAB’s share price today, but IVV is such an easy share for diversification, so I think that’s looking attractive too!</p>
