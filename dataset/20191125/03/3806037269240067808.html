      <p>According to <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/11/23/floyd-mayweather-2-fights-2020-ufc-crossover/">reports</a>, <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/floyd-mayweather">Floyd Mayweather</a> is currently looking to set up two fights in 2020. Last week the undefeated champion <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/11/floyd-mayweather-return-to-boxing-dana-white">took to social media to note plans to come out of retirement</a>.</p>
      <p>Fight insiders are speculating that Mayweather could be setting up a rematch with <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/manny-pacquiao">Manny Pacquiao</a>. Talks of a bout between the two have been increasing as the Filipino boxer is now represented by Al Haymon, who also manages Mayweather. As for rumors of a match with a <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/ufc">UFC</a> superstar, Mayweather isnâ€™t looking to fight in the octagon and is instead looking to find another <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/mma">MMA</a> fighter with impressive striking skills to enter the ring with him.</p>
      <p>If all talks work out and matchups get set, Mayweather could be set to enter the ring again May 2020 and again in September. Stay tuned for more details.</p>
