      <h1>An Injured Ranbir Kapoor And His Girlfriend Alia Bhatt Zoom Off To An Unknown Destination - PICS HERE</h1>

        <b>Last night, our shutterbugs spotted lovebirds Alia Bhatt and Ranbir Kapoor at the Mumbai airport. They looked pretty in casuals, however, Ranbir Kapoor was sporting a sling supporting his injured arm. We wonder what happened</b>

      <p>Alia Bhatt and Ranbir Kapoor are indeed inseparable. They are so much in love that wherever they go, they are together. Be it on holidays or work trips, Alia and Ranbir are generally glued to each other. And now it seems the couple has jetted off to another holiday. Alia and Ranbir were clicked at the Mumbai airport last night. Though they came in separately, it was pretty clear that they were together. But one thing that caught our attention is the arm sling sported by Ranbir. When did he injure himself?</p>
      <p>At the airport, Ranbir Kapoor looked pretty handsome in his casuals. He was wearing black cargos, a full sleeves t-shirt and a beanie cap. He had a light-grey sling on supporting his injured arm. On the other side, Alia Bhatt looked average in her airport look. She was wearing a sky-blue shirt with white loose-fitting pants. She teamed it with white sneakers and was seen dragging her own luggage. Her bag in shiny pink is so girly, we would say. Check out their pictures below:</p>

      <p>One wonders where the couple has jetted off to now. Ranbir and Alia over the past one year have taken many trips together. The recent one being a trip to Kenya. The couple explored the wildlife of Kenya and the pictures serve as proof that they had a great time. Even when Ranbir's parents Neetu Singh and Rishi Kapoor were in New York for the latter's treatment, Alia used to often accompany her beau to meet his parents. Their bond seems pretty tight, huh!
