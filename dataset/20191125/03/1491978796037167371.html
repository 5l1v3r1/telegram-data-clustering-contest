        <i>Demonstrators chant ‘Venice resist’ amid anger over waves caused by ocean liners and flawed flood-proofing project</i>
      </p>
      <p>Thousands of Venetians have taken to the streets to protest over frequent flooding and the impact of giant cruise ships.</p>
      <p>In heavy rain between 2,000 and 3,000 people answered the call of environmental groups and a collective opposed to the ships. Critics say the waves cruise ships create are eroding Venice’s foundations.</p>
      <p>Chanting “Venice resist” and calling for the resignation of the mayor, Luigi Brugnaro, the marchers also appealed for a massive project, Mose, to be mothballed.</p>
      <p>The multi-billion euro infrastructure project has been under way since 2003 to protect the city from flooding but has been plagued by cost overruns, corruption scandals and delays.</p>
      <p>The protest follows <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/17/venice-closes-st-marks-square-as-high-water-threatens-again">unprecedented flooding</a> that devastated the city, submerging homes, businesses and cultural treasures. “Venetians have just endured a deep wound. The flooding … brought this city to its knees and revealed its extreme fragility to the world,” said activist Enrico Palazzi.</p>
      <p>Venice saw yet another <i>acqua alta</i> (high water) event on Sunday with levels reaching 1.3 metres. The Unesco world heritage city is home to 50,000 people while about 36 million more visit each year.</p>
