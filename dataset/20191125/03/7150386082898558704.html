      <p>While Daulat Daroda is MLA from Shahapur, Anil Patil represents Amalner. The former had gone missing since Friday night, when he left his constituency, in the neighbouring Thane district, to reach Mumbai. Yesterday, he had released a video <a href="https://www.india.com/news/india/maharashtra-politics-i-am-safe-no-question-of-changing-party-says-missing-ncp-mla-daulat-daroda-3854936/">pledging support to party</a> <a href="https://www.india.com/news/india/maharashtra-politics-i-am-safe-no-question-of-changing-party-says-missing-ncp-mla-daulat-daroda-3854936/">supremo Sharad Pawar</a>, hours after a ‘missing’ complaint was filed for him.</p>
      <p>Also on Sunday, Sinnar MLA <a href="https://www.india.com/news/india/maharashtra-crisis-advantage-coalition-as-rebel-manikrao-kokate-reaches-hotel-where-ncp-mlas-staying-3855309/">Manikrao Kokate returned to the NCP fold</a>, while Nitin Pawar, the MLA from Kalwan, too, pledged his loyalty to Sharad Pawar.</p>
      <p>“With this, the number of MLAs who have come back to the NCP is 52,” said party spokesperson Nawab Malik, who also further said that one more MLA is in touch with the party.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, amid fears of poaching by the BJP, the NCP shifted its MLAs from the Renaissance Hotel in Powai to Hotel Hyatt near the Mumbai Airport. Hotel Lalit, where Shiv Sena MLAs are holed up, and JW Marriott, where the Congress has put up its MLAs, are also in the vicinity.</p>
