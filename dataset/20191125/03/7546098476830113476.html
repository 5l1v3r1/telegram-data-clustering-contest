      <h1>2 ASX growth shares I’d buy this week</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T03:48:36+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 03:48</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fool.com.au/author/sbowen/" target="_blank">Sebastian Bowen</a></address>
      <p>ASX growth shares can play an important role in a capital-building portfolio. The ASX as a whole has proved to be a phenomenal wealth-building machine over the past century, but aiming even higher for above-market growth is a more difficult yet potentially lucrative strategy.</p>
      <p>Choosing the right ASX growth shares is of course essential, so here are 2 such growth shares that I think are looking hot this week.</p>
      <h3>Magellan Financial Group Ltd <a href="https://www.fool.com.au/tickers/ASX-MFG/">(ASX: MFG)</a></h3>
      <p>Magellan shares had a shaky start this morning, but at the time of writing are up 1.14% to $50 on the dot. This famous fund manager has had a phenomenal year so far, going from around $23 in January to over $60 by late July – almost tripling in value in just 8 months.</p>
      <p>Although MFG shares have settled around their current share price, I think the ongoing appeal of Magellan’s outperforming funds and the launch of the new <b>Magellan High Conviction Trust</b> <a href="https://www.fool.com.au/company/Magellan+High+Conviction+Trust/?ticker=ASX-MHH">(ASX: MHH)</a> will continue to be a positive tailwind. Thus, I think Magellan is looking appealing today as a growth share.</p>
      <h3>Afterpay Touch Group Ltd <a href="https://www.fool.com.au/tickers/ASX-APT/">(ASX: APT)</a></h3>
      <p>Afterpay shares have once again taken off this morning – rising by over 7.6% at the time of writing to $32.83. Investors have been fighting over APT shares after the company released a final update to AUSTRAC from its independent audit. Afterpay has noted some historical breaches of anti-money laundering laws, but notes these resulted from incorrect legal advice given and now “the majority of these matters have been addressed”.</p>
      <p>With some of the regulatory uncertainty now behind Afterpay, a lot of bullish sentiment has clearly returned to the BN-PL player and I think this makes Afterpay a good company to consider today. This is a stock that not too long ago was knocking on $38 a share, so there might be some momentum to capitalise on yet.</p>
      <h3>Foolish takeaway</h3>
      <p>I think these 2 ASX growth shares are well worth considering for investors today. Both Magellan and Afterpay are top notch companies that I expect will continue to deliver market outperformance well into the future.</p>
