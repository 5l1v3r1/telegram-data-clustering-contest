      <h1>Fans divided after Sunil Gavaskar accuses Virat Kohli of sycophancy towards BCCI chief Sourav Ganguly</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T03:58:49+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 03:58</time> by <a rel="author">JKR Staff</a></address>
      <p>India beat Bangladesh by over an innings in the second Test at Kolkata’s Eden Gardens and won the <a href="http://www.jantakareporter.com/sports/india-beat-bangladesh-by-innings-and-46-runs-in-pink-ball-test-create-world-record/273581/">series 2-0.</a> Virat Kohli’s men also created a world record by securing a fourth successive win by more than an innings. However, the day’s event triggered a huge controversy after Kohli credited former India captain Sourav Ganguly for starting the winning culture.</p>

      <p>In his post-match assessment, Kohli said, “The idea is to establish yourself in the middle and we have learnt to stand up and give it back. It all started with Dada’s team and we are just carrying it forward.”</p>
      <p>Kohli’s praise for Ganguly assumed significance in light of the second Test being held in Kolkata, the latter’s home town. His comments, however, did not go down well with another Indian legend, Sunil Gavaskar. Reacting to Kohli’s praise for Ganguly, Gavaskar implied that the Indian captain was indulging in sycophancy since Ganguly was now the BCCI chief.</p>
      <p>He said, “The Indian captain said that this thing started in 2000 with Dada’s (Ganguly’s) team. I know Dada is the BCCI President, so maybe Kohli wanted to say nice things about him. But India were also winning in the ’70s and ’80s. He wasn’t born then.”</p>
      <p>Gavaskar also said sarcastically that many people felt that cricket in India began only in 2000s. He said, “A lot of people still think that cricket started only in 2000s. But the Indian team won overseas in the ’70s. The Indian team also won away in 1986. India also drew series overseas. They lost like other teams did.”</p>
      <p>Soon, Gavaskar began to trend as fans reacted to this new controversy. But they appeared to be divided. While some found nothing wrong in Kohli’s praise for Ganguly, others appeared to side with Gavaskar.</p>
