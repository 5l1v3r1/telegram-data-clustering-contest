      <p>If we could see tomorrow, what of your plans?<br/>No one can live in sorrow, ask all your friends<br/>Times that you took in stride, they're back in demand<br/>I was the one who was washing blood off your hands<br/>Don't you cry tonight<br/>I still love you, baby<br/>Don't you cry tonight<br/>Don't you cry tonight<br/>There's a heaven above you baby<br/>And don't you cry tonight<br/>I know the things you wanted, they're not what you have<br/>With all the people talking, it's driving you mad<br/>If I was standing by you, how would you feel<br/>Knowing your love's decided, and all love is real?<br/>Don't you cry tonight<br/>I still love you, baby<br/>Don't you cry tonight<br/>Don't you cry tonight<br/>There's a heaven above you baby<br/>And don't you cry tonight<br/>I thought I could live in your world<br/>As years all went by, with all the voices I've heard<br/>Something has died<br/>And when you're in need of someone, my heart won't deny you<br/>So many seem so lonely with no one left to cry to, baby<br/>Don't you cry tonight<br/>I still love you, baby<br/>Don't you cry tonight<br/>Don't you cry tonight<br/>There's a heaven above you baby<br/>And don't you cry tonight<br/>Don't you cry tonight<br/>I still love you, baby<br/>Don't you cry tonight<br/>Don't you cry tonight<br/>There's a heaven above you baby<br/>And don't you cry tonight<br/><br/>Songwriters: Duff Rose McKagan / Izzy Stradlin / Matt Sorum / Saul Hudson / W.
