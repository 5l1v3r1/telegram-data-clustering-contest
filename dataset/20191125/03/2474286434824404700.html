      <p>Students from Moree and surrounds were among those from across drought-ravaged NSW who were treated to a special weekend away in Sydney to see the 2019 Schools Spectacular.</p>
      <p>More than 150 students from across the state travelled to Sydney as part of Wish Upon a Star, a joint initiative of the Department of Education and the Office of Sport and Transport NSW, supported by a generous sponsorship from RDE Microphones and REX Airlines.</p>
      <p>A coach-load of students from the New England North West, including from Moree Secondary College, Moree Public School and Moree East Public School, spent the weekend at the Broken Bay Sport and Recreation Centre on the Central Coast, where they enjoyed games and other seaside activities prior to the show.</p>
      <p>"Through the magic of the Schools Spectacular we wanted to lift these kids' spirits and offer them a time of happiness away from the tough grind as their families battle the ravages of drought," co-executive producer of Schools Spectacular, Rosemary Davis said.</p>

      <p>"Schools Spectacular with its colour, variety and vitality captures everyone's hearts and on top of that, these kids will have the chance to enjoy two hours of free entertainment and excitement at SpecFest before the show. The activities at the Sport and Recreation Centre over the balance of the weekend will be the icing on the cake.</p>
      <p>"Thanks to the goodwill and generosity of the Department of Education, Office of Sport, Ministry of Transport and RDE Microphones, we hope that these youngsters will not just have a weekend to remember, but one that will boost the spirits of their families and friends when they return home and share their joy."</p>
      <p>Minister for Education Sarah Mitchell joined the visitors at the Saturday matinee of Schools Spectacular after they had enjoyed a day at the surrounding Sports and Recreation Camps, and said it was fantastic to see students whose communities are struggling from the impacts of drought able to relax and see a world-renowned show.</p>
      <p>"Our rural communities are doing it tough, so being able to give a break to 150 students from these areas makes a difference," Ms Mitchell said.</p>
      <p>"Teachers and parents have told me that this opportunity will be the highlight of the year for many of these students."</p>
      <p>The initiative was for students from drought-ravaged schools, whose principals selected them as a reward for their good behaviour and merit.</p>
