      <p>Growers are using fertiliser and extension services supplied by Yara</p>
      <p>The company is the local branch of a Norwegian Yara multinational that supplies fertiliser worldwide.</p>
      <p>“I have grown paddy for the last one decade and a half in this area.</p>
      <p>The average harvest per acre has been 15 bags. Now I am harvesting between 30 and 35 bags in an acre. Inconceivable,” Anneth Moshi said excitedly.</p>
      <p>She was talking to journalists who visited the area to investigate on reported positive change in paddy growing in that area.</p>
      <p>Lekitatu is one of the major paddy growing areas in Arusha Region with emerging confident peasant cereal growers.</p>
      <p>She attributed the sharp rise in productivity to the type of fertiliser supplied by Yara company and the extension services to the growers.</p>
      <p>The latest World Bank report has named Tanzania, Uganda and Egypt as African countries with steady growing economies, on the verge of becoming middle-income economies.</p>
      <p>“I am hopeful and confident now that this trade (farming) is paying and I will be part of those (Tanzanians) in the middle-income,” Moshi said adding that growers were anxious to see a small agro-industry being established in the area.</p>
      <p>“This crop will take us into the industrial economy,” she said.</p>
      <p>Joel Msangi also echoed Moshi’s views but said in the past growers were using fertilisers ignorantly. “Lack of education on the use of right fertilisers and when to use them; lack of knowledge on applying fertiliser on right soils undermine greatly our efforts. We were getting small harvests,” he said.</p>
      <p>He also says that agronomists from Yara teach growers proper rice husbandry and guides them on the use of right fertiliser for their crops.</p>
      <p>“Yara fertilisers have nutrients for paddy from a tender seedling to harvesting,” he adds.</p>
