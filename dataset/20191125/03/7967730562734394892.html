      <p>Crews have widened their search area for a missing Bundaberg man who failed to surface after going for a dive off Elliott Heads.</p>
      <p>A search resumed at first light on Monday for the 38-year-old, who was reported missing by the skipper of a six-metre vessel, 14 nautical miles off the coast on Saturday.</p>

      <p>The initial search area covered about 100 nautical miles off the Bundaberg coast but has now been extended to 350 nautical miles, Senior Constable Mark Gardiner said.</p>
      <p>"We have a helicopter up in the air doing a search along the shoreline," he said.</p>
      <p>"At this stage, conditions are very favourable for a search.</p>
      <p>"As the days progress, we will have our search assets spreading further out."</p>
      <p>The 38-year-old man was returning from an overnight trip with two mates when police believe he decided to have one last descent into the water.</p>
      <p>He has been described as a competent diver and spear fisherman.</p>

      <p>"From all the information we have received, he has done this trip a few times," Snr Const Gardiner said.</p>
      <p>"It is all assumptions at this stage, what has caused him not to come up."</p>
      <p>Shallow-water blackout, which occurs when a diver does not have enough oxygen for a dive, is one possible reason given for the disappearance.</p>
