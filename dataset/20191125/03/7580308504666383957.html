      <p>The Lagos State government has said it will begin the remittance of 18 per cent contributions into its workers’ Retirement Savings Accounts.</p>
      <p>The Director-General, Lagos State Pension Commission, Folashade Onanuga, disclosed this at the 17th Retirement Benefits Documentation seminar in Lagos.</p>
      <p>She said the commission had received approval from the state government to commence the new rate.</p>
      <p>The Pension Reform Act 2014 increased the rate of contributions for employees and employers to a minimum of eight per cent and 10 per cent, respectively rising from 7.5 per cent formerly contributed by employers and the employees.</p>
      <p>According to her, all was set to commence the deductions of the new rate signed into law in 2014.</p>
      <p>She also disclosed that as of May 29, 2019, a total of N5.79 billion had been credited into the RSAs of 1,542 retirees.</p>
      <p>She noted that the state government under the leadership of the Executive Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, was committed to improving the welfare of retirees.</p>
      <p>According to her, the governor who started the Contributory Pension Scheme, in the state when he was a commissioner at the Ministry of Establishment and Pension, understood the pains of retirees when their entitlements are not paid on time.</p>
      <p>The administration of Sanwo-Olu had continued to show commitment to the welfare of its workforce, both in and out of the office, she said.</p>
      <p>Onanuga explained that the governor was putting plans in place to ensure that retirees got their payments promptly.</p>
      <p>She said: “We remain resolute in our commitment as a commission to the welfare of retirees from the state’s public service.</p>
      <p>“We have continued to upgrade our operations to ensure a seamless interface between us, the contributors and our service providers.”</p>
