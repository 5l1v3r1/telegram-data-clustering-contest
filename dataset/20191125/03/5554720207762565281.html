      <p>Salman Khan on Sunday night made a stunning admission when he revealed that Siddharth Shukla would have been beaten up if it was someone else in place of Asim Riaz inside the <i>Bigg Boss </i>house. The revelation by Salman came during an interaction with the friends and family members of a few housemates. Salman was brutal in his analysis when he held Siddharth responsible for the fight with Asim.</p>

      <p>Shefali Jariwala’s husband Parag Tyagi said that Siddharth was responsible for starting the fight. To which, Salman agreed that it was Siddharth who first provoked by uttering ‘<i>Gadhe Ke Bachche Ko Samajh mein nahi aata </i>(This son of a donkey doesn’t get it.)” Salman then added that Asim had only pushed Siddharth ‘politely,’ adding that ‘Siddharth pushed Asim with more force.’</p>
      <p>Salman also agreed with Parag and Umar that ‘Asim’s frustration level had reached a tipping point.’ Salman also said that he had warned Siddharth about his aggression and arrogance all through the show. “I had been telling Siddharth from the first week that arrogance won’t work. Asim hadn’t pushed him that hard. If there was someone else in place of Asim, Siddharth would have been thrashed,” Salman added.</p>

      <p>Shefali Jariwala’s husband expressed his displeasure over some objectionable comments made by Paras Chhabra for his wife. He said, “I am hurt. I was ready to sacrifice my life for Paras. I had considered him like my younger brother. But the way he made personal comments about Shefali (linking him with Asim), this was not acceptable.”</p>
      <p>Paras’s girlfriend Akansha Puri felt that Paras had resorted to some dirty games in the house but defended him saying that he was playing his game beautifully. She also said that she had warned him about his behaviour with girls inside the house before he entered the competition.</p>
      <p>Salman had earlier dared Siddharth<a href="http://www.jantakareporter.com/entertainment/salman-khan-lashes-out-at-siddharth-shukla-dares-him-for-physical-fight-either-inside-or-outside-bigg-boss-house/273389/"> for a fight</a> with him either outside the house or inside the reality show house.</p>
