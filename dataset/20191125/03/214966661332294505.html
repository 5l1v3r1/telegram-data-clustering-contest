      <h1>Titans re-sign young gun AJ Brimson </h1>

      <p>The Gold Coast Titans have received another boost ahead of next season, locking in young gun AJ Brimson.</p>
      <p>The local junior has today signed a new deal which will keep him at the club until the end of 2022.</p>
      <p>Brimson has racked up 36 NRL games after making his debut for the Titans in round 10 of 2018.</p>
      <p>The Keebra Park product now has a chance to establish himself as the side’s number one fullback following the retirement of Michael Gordon.</p>
      <p>New Titans coach Justin Holbrook says Brimson’s re-signing is important for the club.</p>
      <p>“AJ is a perfect example of the Titans production line in action – a local junior who came through the Club’s development system to play NRL in his hometown,” Holbrook said</p>
      <p>“AJ’s story is not unique to the Club, because we are lucky to have a lot of local juniors here who have followed that path.</p>
      <p>“But certainly AJ is another example of the template that we will use to take the Titans forward on the back of the best talent produced in the Gold Coast and Northern Rivers region.</p>
      <p>“AJ is an exceptional young player as we all know, highlighted by the fact he is now on the radar of representative selectors. But importantly he is also an impressive young man, a quality human being who has a passion for this club and his community.”</p>
