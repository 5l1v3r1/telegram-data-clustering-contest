      <p>NEW YORK: A hyper-industrious billionaire, a three-term mayor of New York and a climate change activist, Michael Bloomberg is now eyeing one last prize: the US presidency.</p>
      <p>The 77-year-old giant of the financial world officially announced that he was joining the race for the 2020 Democratic nomination Sunday, but he has some catching up to do.</p>

      <p>He becomes the 18th candidate in the pack that includes three others in their 70s, plus a fellow billionaire, Tom Steyer.</p>
      <p>Bloomberg will count on leveraging his fortune - Forbes ranks him as the 15th richest person in the world currently - to make up ground on the favorites.</p>
      <p>They included fierce Wall Street critics Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, both of whom he sees as "extremists."</p>
      <p>Bloomberg will be working for a long-awaited chance to take on fellow New York tycoon Donald Trump, with whom then-mayor Bloomberg often rubbed shoulders at social events, occasionally even offering words of praise, before turning his back when Trump entered politics.</p>
      <p>
        <b>'I KNOW A CON ...'</b>
      </p>
      <p>"I'm a New Yorker, and I know a con when I see one," he said dismissively of Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign.</p>
      <p>Bloomberg had toyed with the idea of running as an independent, before finally - fearful of dividing Democratic voters - throwing his support behind Hillary Clinton.</p>
      <p>In March, Bloomberg said he would not run this time around and could do more good by supporting the eventual nominee than by taking on the "incompetent" Trump.</p>
      <p>But he has changed his mind.</p>
      <p>As a successful businessman who shuns political labels, economically conservative but liberal on gay rights and abortion, he has grown increasingly worried by left-wingers Warren and Sanders running Joe Biden close.</p>
      <p>But can Bloomberg win over Democratic voters?</p>
      <p>He points to his successes as an executive who helped revitalise post-9/11 New York, his advocacy and financial support for gun control and his work on climate change.</p>
      <p>Bloomberg has been a special UN envoy for climate action since 2014 and has helped several US states, counties and cities finance emissions-reducing projects.</p>
      <p>The divorced father of two daughters has joined other billionaires in signing the so-called Giving Pledge, which commits them to contribute more than half their wealth to good causes.</p>

      <p>He supports cultural organisations, advocates against smoking and vaping and last year donated US$1.8 billion to his alma mater Johns Hopkins University to help poorer students pay tuition.</p>
      <p>In 2018, he spent US$100 million to help Democratic candidates regain control of the US House of Representatives.</p>
      <p>
        <b>AGAINST THE TIDE?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Still, Bloomberg will have to contend with his image as an elitist swimming against a Democratic orthodoxy that has moved left on taxation and immigration.</p>
      <p>And as mayor, Bloomberg - who travels in private jets - was accused of turning New York into a playground of the rich while backing tough police tactics that discriminated against minorities.</p>
      <p>No one denies his business acumen, which took him from a middle-class early life north of Boston to his exalted status as one of the world's most powerful media moguls.</p>
      <p>Born Feb 14, 1942 into a Jewish family - his father was an accountant at a dairy - Bloomberg excelled in electrical engineering at Johns Hopkins before earning a Harvard MBA.</p>
      <p>He went to work at the Salomon Brothers investment bank in 1966 and rose quickly to the rank of partner before leaving with a US$10 million bonus in cash and bonds.</p>
      <p>He and partner Matthew Winkler founded financial news firm Bloomberg LP, revolutionizing stock exchanges with its innovative computer terminals that financiers could access data far quicker than before.</p>
      <p>
        <b>'GOING RIGHT IN'</b>
      </p>
      <p>Bloomberg is fond of pointing out that his amassed fortune dwarfs Trump's, even though the president started in business with millions of dollars from his father.</p>
      <p>And Trump clearly chafes at the comparison, dismissing his physically smaller rival as "little Michael" on Friday and positing that Bloomberg "doesn't have the magic to do well."</p>
      <p>Bloomberg does share one concern with Trump: what would he do with his business should he become president? Would he hang on to the purse strings, knowing that doing so could raise conflicts of interest?</p>
      <p>When New Yorkers picked him for mayor, Bloomberg did not give up company ownership, but he did step away from day-to-day management.</p>
      <p>He is not known for his modesty.</p>
      <p>In 2017, he suggested that he felt he had earned a place in heaven for having saved "millions of lives" through his charitable work and anti-tobacco campaigning.</p>
      <p>"When I get to heaven, I'm not sure I'm going to stand for an interview," he quipped on CBS's "60 Minutes."</p>
