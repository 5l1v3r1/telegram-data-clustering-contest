      <h1>KUWK: Kris Jenner Reportedly ‘Anxious’ Over What Caitlyn Jenner Might Spill On ‘I’m A Celebrity’ After Possibly Revealing Kylie Is Pregnant Again!</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T03:13:44+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 03:13</time> by <a rel="author">Ashley Mitchell</a></address>
      <p>After Caitlyn Jenner stated that she is going to have no less than 20 grandkids pretty soon, people started actually counting the young ones and they came a bit short! From there on, the rumors that Kylie Jenner is expecting again started going around.</p>
      <p>That being said, one insider report claims to know that momager Kris Jenner is a little anxious over what her ex might end up revealing after what she supposedly hinted at during an episode of I’m a Celebrity…Get Me Out of Here!</p>
      <p>As far as she is concerned, Kris thinks any such details being spilled may not really be in her family’s ‘best interest.’</p>
      <p>So, even though things are good between Kris and Caitlyn, the source tells HollywoodLife that the momager is keeping a close eye on her ex while she’s on the show.</p>
      <p>The reason why is that she wants to make sure Caitlyn will not accidentally reveal any private details about the reality TV clan, especially when it comes to new additions.</p>
      <p>That is why she was especially ‘anxious’ when the transgender icon talked about grandkids during the latest episode of I’m a Celebrity, dishing that by December, she will have ’20 grandchildren!’</p>
      <p>‘Kris has gotten to a much better place with Caitlyn, but that does not mean she is not still nervous that Caitlyn will say something that won’t be in the best interest of the family. Kris knows that Caitlyn would never do or say something intentionally at this point, but sometimes she says things that are not in the best interest of the family,’ the insider told the news outlet.</p>
      <p>They went on to explain that ‘She hates to see everybody wondering if Kylie’s pregnant again after Caitlyn’s comments on ‘I’m A Celebrity.’ She truly wants the very best for Caitlyn always, but she gets nervous with Caitlyn, that she will accidentally say something she does not want her sharing.’</p>
