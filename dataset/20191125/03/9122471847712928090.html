      <h1>Here’s What Greg Schiano Was Reportedly Demanding From Rutgers</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T03:46:39+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 03:46</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>Greg Schiano will not be the next head coach of Rutgers’ football program. The Scarlet Knights were unable to agree to terms on a deal with their former head coach.</p>
      <p>It had been reported that Schiano was making some notable “demands” that needed to be met in order for him to take the job. Rutgers has been a Big Ten basement dweller for years and the program needed sizable upgrades, he felt.</p>
      <p>Those “demands” have since been revealed.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nj.com/sports/2019/11/heres-greg-schianos-complete-list-of-demands-4m-a-year-a-25m-guarantee-and-a-private-jet.html">From NJ.com</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>The list of demands included a $4 million-a-year salary over eight years, a $25.2 million guarantee on Day 1 of his contract and unlimited use of a private jet.<br/><br/>In the end, one source said, it was too high a price to pay for Greg Schiano.</blockquote>
      <p>Now, this might seem like a lot to those unfamiliar with the college football landscape – and they might be a lot for <i>Rutgers</i> – but in order to be a competitive college football program, they really are not.</p>
      <p>The $4 million/year salary would rank in the bottom third of the Big Ten; the $25.2 million guarantee is large but nothing crazy; the private jet is often critical for recruiting.</p>
      <p>NJ.com columnist Steve Politi summed it up best:</p>

      <p>He added: “I was prepared to write that Schiano’s demands were too much. Rutgers isn’t Auburn. I get that. But this is Illinois-level s–t, folks.”</p>
      <p>Rutgers has been arguably the worst Power 5 program in college football over the last couple of years. It doesn’t look like the Scarlet Knights are that willing to that it anytime soon.</p>
