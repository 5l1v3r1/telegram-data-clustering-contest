      <p>A 25-stone Britain's Got Talent semi-finalist who ate three McDonald's meals a day spent £10,000 on a weight loss operation.</p>
      <p>Kieran Sutcliffe, who performed on the ITV show with his girlfriend Sarah in 2014, used the money he'd stashed away for a house deposit to have 80% of his stomach removed.</p>
      <p>But he decided things had to change after a friend broke down in tears in fear for Kieran’s health.</p>
      <p>After finding out he would have to wait a long time for NHS treatment he opted to go private, spending £10,500 he had saved for a house deposit on an operation that removed 80 per cent of his stomach.</p>
      <p>Since then Kieran, who is now 30 and lives in Loughborough, Leicestershire,has shed 10 stone and is now living an active life full of cricket matches and 5km runs.</p>
      <p>He told <a href="https://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/news/local-news/25-stone-britains-talent-singer-3568451">Leicestershire Live</a> : “When you’re 30 and reach 25 stone it’s a real worry and my friends and family had always been saying I needed to be more careful about what I eat.</p>
      <p>“I was at a pub one day watching a football match with a good friend of mine when the conversation turned to weight.</p>

      <p>“He’s a really jokey bloke but he broke down in front of me because he was getting so emotional about my weight.”</p>
      <p>Kieran had never been overweight as a youngster.</p>
      <p>He said: “I was captain of the cricket and football teams and always pretty slim.</p>
      <p>“When I went to Melton College I was busy all the time and I’d pick the unhealthy foods because that was just easier to do when I was on the go.</p>
      <p>“It was there I started to gain weight. I think I just got stuck in a rut.</p>
      <p>"At one stage I’d sometimes eat three McDonald’s meals in one day and it was spiralling out of control.</p>

      <p>“I was a big lad when we went on Britain’s Got Talent but over the next couple of years I got even bigger.</p>
      <p>“You honestly don’t realise at the time what you’re doing to yourself.”</p>
      <p>Going under the knife in the summer of 2018, Kieran had keyhole surgery that cut out most of his stomach and stapled together the remaining part – instantly reducing his ability to eat large amounts of food.</p>
      <p>But while it might sound unpleasant, there have been nothing but positive outcomes – apart from having to start saving for a house deposit again.</p>
      <p>Kieran, who continues to work as a singer, performing on cruise ships and at various functions, said: “A house can wait – it was more important to get my health sorted and it’s added 15 to 20 years to my life.</p>

        <figcaption>His BMI plunged from an obese 47 to a healthy 28</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>“I had about three days after the operation with some chest wind but since then it’s been fine and I lost the weight rapidly.”</p>
      <p>Because his smaller stomach needed time to heal after the surgery, Keiran spent weeks on nothing but liquids and further weeks on soft foods only, helping him adjust to his new diet, which is now full of fruits and other healthy treats.</p>
      <p>“I’m now 10 stone lighter and able to lose more weight easily when I want to,” he said.</p>
      <p>“I’ve gone from a BMI of 47 to 28, which isn’t quite in the green but it’s a lot lower.</p>
      <p>“I’m playing cricket again and going to the gym and enjoying running.</p>
      <p>“It’s nice to be back to the sporty lifestyle. And other people have made very positive comments about my weight loss and been inspired to try it, too.”</p>
