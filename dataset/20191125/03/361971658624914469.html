      <h1>Watch Taylor Swift Perform a Career-Spanning Medley at the 2019 AMAs</h1>
      <h2>She played “Shake It Off,” “Love Story,” “I Knew You Were Trouble,” and more despite recent controversy over Swift’s old material</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T03:52:43+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 03:52</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://pitchfork.com/staff/allison-hussey/" target="_blank">Allison Hussey, Madison Bloom</a></address>
      <p>Following reignited controversy in mid-November, <a href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/28495-taylor-swift/">Taylor Swift</a> took the stage at <a href="https://www.theamas.com/">the American Music Awards</a> earlier tonight to perform a career-spanning medley of hits celebrating her title of Artist of the Decade. Tay was introduced by legendary songwriter Carole King, before she performed “Love Story,” “I Knew You Were Trouble,” “Shake It Off,” and more. Watch her performance and acceptance speech below.</p>
      <p>It was uncertain whether or not Swift would be able to perform any of her pre-<i><a href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/taylor-swift-lover/">Lover</a></i> material tonight, as she took to social media earlier in the month <a href="https://pitchfork.com/news/taylor-swift-accuses-scooter-braun-and-scott-borchetta-of-blocking-her-from-performing-her-old-music/">stating that her ex-label boss Scott Borchetta and Scooter Braun were preventing her from doing so</a>. As it turns out, Taylor was able to perform songs old and new.</p>
      <p>Her full setlist included “Lover” and “The Man” from <i>Lover</i>, “Love Story,” from <i>Fearless</i>, “I Knew You Were Trouble” from <i>Red</i> as well as “Blank Space” and “Shake It Off” from <i>1989</i>. Halsey and Camila Cabello joined Swift for “Shake It Off,” while Tay performed “Lover” solo on a gilded piano, accompanied by ballet dancers.</p>

      <p>In the beginning of her set, Taylor wore a simple white button-down with the names of her older albums screen-printed on the front in black block letters. During Swift’s acceptance speech, she thanked the dancers and artists that accompanied her onstage. She also praised Carole King and went on to discuss how King has influenced her.</p>
      <p>Speaking to her fans and prospective artists, she added: “I guess what I’m trying to say is that all anyone in this room wants is to create something that will last, whatever it is in life, and the fact that this is an award that celebrates a decade of hard work and of art and of fun and memories—all that matters to me is the memories that I’ve had with you the fans over the years. you guys we’ve had fun, incredible, exhilarating times together, and may it continue.”</p>
      <p>Earlier in the evening, Taylor’s most recent LP <i><a href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/taylor-swift-lover/">Lover</a></i> won the favorite pop/rock album award. In her acceptance speech, Tay thanked the people who helped her make the record, including Jack Antonoff, St. Vincent, Dixie Chicks, and others. “I didn’t think I was going to win this one. This album really felt like a new beginning.” She also pointedly thanked her new labels, Universal and Republic. Taylor also won artist of the year. Swift’s wins caused her break the all-time AMAs win record. Watch Taylor’s speeches below.</p>
      <p>On November 14, Swift claimed that former manager Scooter Braun and Big Machine Label Group head Scott Borchetta were <a href="https://pitchfork.com/news/taylor-swift-accuses-scooter-braun-and-scott-borchetta-of-blocking-her-from-performing-her-old-music/">blocking her from performing her older songs</a> on the AMAs and a forthcoming Netflix documentary. Borchetta responded through Big Machine, which <a href="https://pitchfork.com/news/taylor-swifts-ex-label-denies-her-tv-licensing-claims/">insisted that Swift was not banned</a> from playing her old music on TV. “At no point did we say Taylor could not perform on the AMAs or block her Netflix special. In fact, we do not have the right to keep her from performing live anywhere,” the statement read.</p>
      <p>Braun <a href="https://pitchfork.com/news/scooter-braun-addresses-taylor-swift-feud-for-the-first-time/">first addressed the feud</a> on November 22 during an interview with <i>Variety</i>’s Shirley Halperin at the 2019 Entertainment Industry Conference, and again in <a href="https://pitchfork.com/news/scooter-braun-addresses-taylor-swift-controversy-in-lengthy-instagram-post/">a long Instagram post</a> on Sunday. “This is a world filled with toxic division where people express their opinions over social media instead of having conversations in person. I want no part in that,” he wrote on Instagram, claiming that he and his family had received death threats over the situation. The award show’s <a href="https://pitchfork.com/news/taylor-swift-allowed-to-play-old-songs-at-2019-american-music-awards-ex-label-claims/">producers denied</a> having anything to do with the controversy.</p>
      <p>The AMA-related incident is the latest in Swift’s ongoing legal saga over her old music, which began in June when Braun’s company Ithaca Holdings LLC <a href="https://pitchfork.com/news/taylor-swift-slams-scooter-brauns-acquisition-of-her-back-catalog-accuses-him-of-bullying/">had purchased Swift’s masters</a> from her former label Big Machine. In August, Swift said that she <a href="https://pitchfork.com/news/taylor-swift-says-she-plans-to-re-record-her-back-catalog-to-regain-control-of-her-masters/">plans to re-record</a> all six of her pre-<i><a href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/taylor-swift-lover/">Lover</a></i> albums in order to reclaim control of her masters. Swift said that Braun and Borchetta were preventing her from performing at the AMAs because it qualified as a re-recording, which she’s not allowed to do until next year per their pre-existing agreement over her masters.</p>
