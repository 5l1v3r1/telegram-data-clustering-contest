      <p>Speaking during the Indonesia–Tanzania Industrialisation forum held in Dar es Salaam over the weekend, he said the embassy also applies the same facility to Tanzanian brothers and sisters who need any information about Indonesia.</p>
      <p>He said the idea of organising the forum was derived from the idea on how Indonesia could take part in fulfilling Tanzania’s aspiration of becoming semi industrialised and middle income country by 2025.</p>
      <p>“The idea of having this forum is inspired from the Indonesian government determination to transform good historical relations with Tanzania into beneficial economic cooperation for the people of both countries,” he said.</p>
      <p>Prof Pardede said the idea of having the forum is also originated from his findings after traveling to 9 regions in Tanzania during the period of 2017-2018.</p>
      <p>“ I am convinced that Tanzania holds a great potential to be an economic power house in the regions just like Indonesia in South East Asia. As such, it is only natural for Indonesia to jump in to grab that boundless opportunities in Tanzania”, he said.</p>
      <p>More importantly, he said the idea of having the meeting comes from the desire to ensure that regardless of any challenges Indonesia and Tanzania are currently or will be facing, they always get each other’s back.</p>
      <p>According to him, this is the very first time for the Embassy to organise the forum with the aim to connect more business opportunities between companies from Indonesia and Tanzania.</p>
      <p>“This is the very first time after many years of our two countries relations; we managed to gather companies to discuss on how to collaborate in co-developing industries in Indonesia and Tanzania,” he stated.</p>
      <p>The Envoy said this is also the first time for the Embassy to welcome Indonesian business delegation in one group for one single aim to see the market and investment opportunities in Tanzania.</p>
      <p>He said most of the time, Indonesian companies were arriving in Tanzania as a single fighter, enthusiastic and courageous, but often confused on how to find the right partners and making a follow up.</p>
      <p>He also said that Indonesia as the largest economy in South East Asia depends on its industries to sustain its economic growth. Indonesia manufacturing industry contributed for around 10 percent to our GDP in 2018. This made Indonesia among the top countries that have significant contribution from its manufacturing industry.</p>
      <p>Moreover, Indonesia export also depends on the performance from its industries namely, agriculture, mining, gas, textile and automobile. The value of Indonesia’s export from the manufacturing industry also showed an increasing trend from 153 billion USD in 2017 to 162 billion USD in 2018.</p>
      <p>At the same time, Tanzania as one of the most strategic countries in East Africa that serves as a gateway to the African continent would need to find potential partners to bring forth its vision of becoming a semi industrialised country by 2025.</p>
      <p>“With the gloomy outlook of the global economy next year, he said the establishment of economic and industrial partnership between Indonesia and Tanzania could brush away such difficult outlook. For that reason, the Embassy decided to play its part to initiate more talks between the private sectors and governments of our two countries.”</p>
      <p>In 2017, during the presentation of his credentials before president John Magufuli, Prof Pardede promised that he will try his best to bring investors from Indonesia to Tanzania.</p>
      <p>This year there will be two companies from Indonesia that will open up their factory in Dar es Salaam and Pemba, he said.</p>
      <p>This year also marks a new beginning of Indonesia’s significance in Tanzania through the agreement of Indonesia Exim Bank that will finance the Liquid Gas Terminal in Zanzibar worth approximately 190 million Usd.</p>
      <p>“Currently, we are in the discussion for a joint project to build well established hotel in Dodoma. Should the discussion going well, we are going to have the first five stars hotel in Dodoma,” he concluded.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Minister of State in Prime Minister's Office (Investment) Angellah Kairuki said that Tanzania has as well taken several efforts to improve easy of doing business and investment.</p>
      <p>“We are zealously working on the set of recommendations for reform published in May 2018 through the Blueprint for Regulatory Reforms to Improve the Business Environment; to improve the business climate in Tanzania” she said.</p>
      <p>She said the government is vigorously fighting corruption and improving efficiency of Business institutions including the Tanzania Ports Authority (TPA), Business Registrations and Licensing Agency (BRELA) and Tanzania Investment Center (TIC).</p>
      <p>BRELA, for instance, has completed the development of a modern Online Registration System (ORS) for Companies, Business Names, Trade and Service Marks and their respective post registrations, issuance of Patents and Industrial Licenses.</p>
      <p>The system enables customers to access all BRELA services wherever they are without visiting BRELA premises, at any time of the day.</p>
      <p>TIC has now put in place a system of one stop center where an investor can access and meet all institutions responsible for investment under one roof.</p>
      <p>She further said the ongoing expansion of the port of Dar es Salaam, rehabilitation and expansion of Mtwara port, construction of the main terminal building (Terminal 3) at the Julius Nyerere International Airport, revamping of the National Airline (ATCL), the construction of the 2,100MW Mwalimu Nyerere Hydropower Plant at Rufiji river are not only true examples of putting the Blueprint in operation but will substantially reduce the cost of doing business and investing in Tanzania.</p>
      <p>She also expressed her appreciation to Ambassador Pardede for proposing such an event of interest both for Tanzania and Indonesia.</p>
      <p>Indeed your personal efforts and initiatives in exploring potential opportunities in regions like Simiyu, Kigoma, Mbeya, among others have strengthened Tanzania-Indonesia economic ties.</p>
      <p>“One of the most important objectives of Tanzanian Industrial policy is to foster economic development through Industrialisation. It is also at the heart of our agenda that we become industrial led economy come 2025.”</p>
