      <p>Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed has said that the Federal Government will remove all impediments to the growth of the creative industry.</p>
      <p>The minister gave the assurance in Lagos yesterday at the All Africa Music Awards (AFRIMA).</p>
      <p>“As we head into 2020, the successful commercialisation of the creative industry is our number one priority. It will create jobs, reduce crime, be a major source of foreign exchange and thereby reduce our dependence on oil, rebrand our country internationally and boost the Gross domestic Product (GDP),” he said.</p>
      <p>According to Mohammed, government is providing the necessary framework through the office of the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) to ensure that music consumers pay.</p>
