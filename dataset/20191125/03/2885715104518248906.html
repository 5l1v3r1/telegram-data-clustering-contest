      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T03:45:01+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 03:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/express-news-service/" target="_blank">Express News Service</a></address>
      <p>Gangster Sukhpreet Singh Dhaliwal alias Budda confessed to his role in running the extortion business in the state. Budda, who is in a seven days police custody, told the police that apart from Punjabi singers, he also extorted money from the businessmen of the state.</p>
      <p>Sources in the police told <a href="https://indianexpress.com/elections/chandigarh-lok-sabha-election-results/">Chandigarh</a> Newsline that Budda was running extortion business and most of his victims belonged to Moga district. The officer added that the racket was run by Budda through his Dubai-based accomplice.</p>
      <p>“Not only singers, the businessmen were also his targets. He collected huge amounts of money from some Moga-based businessmen. Rice mill owners were also targeted by the gang. It was an organised business which was being run for the past three to four years by Budda and his accomplices,” the officer added.</p>
      <p>The police are yet to establish Budda’s links with a particular pro-Khalistan group. The officer privy to the investigation told Newsline that they had questioned Budda on his proximity to some pro-Khalistan groups and they were probing whether he had been planning any radical activity in the state.</p>
      <p>“In the past, we have seen that the pro-Khalistan groups were encouraging some notorious criminals to involve them in ant-national activities. Budda too had threatened some Hindu leaders. It could have happened on the insistence of some radical groups. We are investigating the matter,” the officer said.</p>
      <p>During his interrogation, Budda also told the police that he had received Rs 20 lakh extortion money from Punjabi singer Parmish Verma. The later was shot at by Budda’s accomplice Dilpreet Singh Dahan in April last year near Sector 91.</p>
      <p>Police are also probing Budda’s role in threat calls received by Punjabi singer Gippy Grewal for extorting money. Gippy had registered an FIR in Phase 13 police station last year against Dilpreet Singh Baba.</p>
      <p>Budda was also booked in Kharar (city) police station for allegedly threatening <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/shiv-sena/">Shiv Sena</a> (Hindustan) leader Nishant Sharma over phone this year.</p>
