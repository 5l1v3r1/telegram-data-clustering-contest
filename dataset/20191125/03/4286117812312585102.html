      <p>A woman in Haryana's Bahadurgarh was murdered by her estranged husband when she was visiting her in-laws' place for her son's birthday. The couple was living separately for five years and police suspect the husband had planned the murder well in advance.</p>
      <p>Police in Bahadurgarh on Sunday recovered a semi-decomposed body of a married woman from her in-laws' house after neighbours complained of a foul smell emanating from the house.</p>
      <p>After receiving complaints about a foul smell coming from the residence of the deceased, police conducted a search of the house and found the woman's body stuffed inside the divan of a bed.</p>
      <p>Police lodged a murder case against the woman's husband Rajveer based on a complaint by her brother Akshay.</p>
      <p>They recovered the semi-decomposed body from inside the bed. A postmortem will be conducted on Monday.</p>
      <p>"Forensic teams went to the house and recovered the body. There are strangulation marks on the deceased's neck and prima facie it appears that she was strangulated but more will be revealed by the postmortem report," said SHO Asauda Bir Singh.</p>
      <p>According to deceased's brother Akshay, his sister Lalita, who hailed from Chauhan Joshi village of Sonipat, was married to Rajveer of Jasaurkhedi village of Bahadurgarh. She was living in Gurugram for the last five years because of a strained relationship with Rajveer.</p>
      <p>Lalita was visiting her in-laws' house on November 22 to celebrate her son Nishant's birthday.</p>
      <p>The murder seems to have been pre-planned by Rajveer who had sent his son and daughter to a relative's place before killing Lalita. He later dumped the body inside the bed.</p>
      <p>Rajveer is on the run while police officials say he will be nabbed soon.</p>
