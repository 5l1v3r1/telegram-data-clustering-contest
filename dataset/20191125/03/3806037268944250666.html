      <p>Returning off their riotous <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/6/black-pumas-eponymous-debut-album-stream">eponymous debut album</a> as well as their recent <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/11/grammy-nominations-2020-full-list">GRAMMY nomination for Best New Artist</a>, powerhouse Austin duo <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/11/grammy-nominations-2020-full-list">Black Pumas</a> — made up of Eric Burton and Adrian Quesada — have returned with a radiating new visual for their album’s standout hit, <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/4/black-pumas-colors-single-stream">“Colors.”</a></p>
      <p>Directed by Kristian Mercado, who recently won the Best Music Video award at SXSW Film Festival, the visual exemplifies the soul-stirring cut. “I really wanted to capture how powerful the sounds and vocals of Black Pumas are,” he shared via press release. “We explore the idea of the Bronx as a living garden, always growing always moving forward, and finding a cinematic landscape in places people often ignore.”</p>
      <p>The electrifying track remains one of the highlights off the duo’s Black Pumas debut album and has since become widely praised. Their idiosyncratic take on modern Motown soul remains unrivaled, making them one of the top acts to come out of 2019.</p>
