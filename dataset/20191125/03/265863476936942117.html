      <h1>Christian Bale Reveals That His Grandmother-In-Law’s First Movie To Watch Of His Was American Psycho</h1>

      <p>According to a report from People.com, Christian Bale, despite being one of the greatest actors in Hollywood today, he still didn’t manage to impress his in-laws as well as one might think. During an interview with People Magazine, the star sat down with his co-star, Matt Damon, and the two discussed some of their favorite films.</p>
      <p>During the chat, Bale revealed the first time that his in-laws watched one of his films was <i>American Psycho,</i> which was arguably his most controversial role ever. The film starred Christian as Patrick Bateman, a murderous upper-class yuppie living in New York during the 1980s.</p>
      <p>When he first married Sibi, her mother asked her if he had done any famous films, and she told him <i>American Psycho</i>, so she borrowed the copy from her.</p>
      <p>Damon immediately said, “Oh no, oh my god.” Bale recalled that Sibi’s mother didn’t understand just how many crazy moments there would be in the film.</p>

      <p>Sibi and her grandmother ended up skipping through some of the more “inappropriate” parts of the film, thinking it was just an avant-garde scene for the sake of style, however, they ended up getting through the entire film in 15 minutes.</p>
      <p>Bale, who starred as Patrick in the 2000 thriller, portrayed a high-strung and mentally disturbed man in his late twenties. While the movie has since become a massive cult-classic for Bale, it didn’t perform well at the box office.</p>
      <p>Following the conclusion of the film, Sibi’s grandmother said to her that Christian must’ve not been a “proper actor,” and then hoped he would do much “better in the future.” These days, Bale’s roles haven’t been quite as controversial, including his recent box office success, <i>Ford v Ferrari.</i></p>
      <p>Bale admitted he was incredibly proud to star in<i> Ford v Ferrari</i> because there weren’t many films like it being made anymore. The actor added that it was the closest one could get to driving a race car without actually doing so. Damon added that it was definitely the type of movie that is better watched in the theater rather than on one’s phone.</p>
