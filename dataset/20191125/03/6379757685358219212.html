      <p>Deputy Country Director, Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA) Kihyun Baik made the remarks when speaking during the KOICA Alumni Association of Tanzania (KAAT) annual general meeting (AGM) held in Dar es Salaam over the weekend.</p>
      <p>Korea has been able to develop economically following investments in human capital, leadership and cultural habits, he said.</p>
      <p>“We did not have enough natural resources to rely on, we decided to invest more in human capital and embrace the spirit of working hard,” said Baik.</p>
      <p>He added that KOICA through Official Development Assistance (ODA) is implementing nine projects in Tanzania mainland and Zanzibar. He said in Zanzibar the agency implements a US $ 10 million project gearing to enhance provision of secondary education.</p>
      <p>The project which is being implemented in Unguja and Pemba Islands since 2018 will end in 2023.</p>
      <p>Baik noted that KOICA in collaboration with UNICEF are implementing a US $ 7million project that aims to enhance maternal health. Under the project, he said, they are constructing a zonal blood centre in Dodoma as well as capacitating four health centres to offer quality maternal services.</p>
      <p>Dr Robert Suphian, Coordinato, University of Dar es Salaam Korean Studies Centre said Tanzania was almost similar with Korea in economic development in 1970s, but the country has now developed and is assisting other developing countries.</p>
      <p>Dr Sphian suggested for the government to put more emphasis on improving economic activities especially manufacturing sector to create more jobs.</p>
      <p>“We have all the potential to economically grow like Korea, we only need to enhance manufacturing and work tirelessly,” he said adding the country’s economic growing pace is encouraging.</p>
      <p>He said following higher demand for learning Korean language and culture the Korean Studies Centre at UDSM they will introduce classes for Korean language and culture.</p>
      <p>Currently, he said, the language is taught at the University of Dodoma and at the Centre for Foreign Relations. Over 150 people have so far studied the language.</p>
      <p>KOICA Master’s Degree Programme scholar, Evelyne Rwela who is a Lecturer at Tengeru Institute of Community Development (TICD) commended KOICA for initiating the programme insisting it has shaped her into a competent tutor.</p>
      <p>“I was just a tutor teaching Diploma students, but after the Master’s Degree course in Korea, I have been promoted to a Lecturer,” said Rwela noting that staying in Korea have also helped her change her mindset towards development as she has started a home garden where villagers buy vegetables at affordable prices.</p>
      <p>“Koreans taught us to work hard, apart from being a Lecturer, I started a small garden to help surrounding communities to get vegetables since the area also have a good number of stunted children,” Evelyne asserted.</p>
      <p>Earlier, in his opening remarks, KOICA Country Director, Kyucheol Eo, said they established the KOICA Alumni Association of Tanzania (KAAT) in 2003 to contribute to community development activities and to provide an avenue for the alumni to enhance their social and professional cooperation among themselves.</p>
      <p>There are more than 1,800 beneficiaries of the KOICA fellowship programme and 100 KAAT members, he said.</p>
