      <p>Addressing the clients in Dar es Salaam, Mantrac Tanzania’s Managing Director, Medhat Adly said the training was meant to also rewarded loyal customers for their support so that they can successfully use and maintain latest models of CAT equipment.</p>
      <p>Adly said the training was also meant to enable customers manage their worksites and businesses more efficiently and at the same time minimize risks and ensure that employees are safe on site. He said this year, his company has upgraded its customer value agreements which is now allowing them to select the exact type of support they need most.</p>
      <p>“For this training, we have invited engineers, project managers and maintenance planners to meet with our experts led by our Product Support Manager, Mohamad El Demerdash,” he said.</p>
      <p>Speaking about the training session, El Demerdash backed his boss by stating that customers got the chance to meet Caterpillar digital specialists and learn about the power of CAT equipment technology and how to successfully us them in their daily operations.</p>
      <p>He said the training had the objective of helping the clients on how best to manage worksites and business more efficiently through data supported insights and expert recommendations hence minimize risk and avoid possible failures.</p>
      <p>“We also wanted to ensure that employees using our equipment are able to perform their jobs safely, purchase parts, schedule service and generally interact with Mantrac experts on a one on one basis,” he added saying such interaction may also lower costs of operating and maintaining the equipment.</p>
      <p>Among new products on display during the training included Vision Link, which is one of the digital tools used in fleet management. Other products on display were mobile applications that allow customers access mobile equipment management tool that gives them an easy way to monitor their entire fleet, request parts and service and connect with the dealer from anywhere in the world.</p>
      <p>“The exact location of all equipment tracked by the app is displayed on the mobile device, along with the machine’s operating hours, health and utilization data. It enables clients to get the most from their equipment by moving under-utilized assets to precisely where they are needed most,” El Demerdash noted.</p>
      <p>Other benefits, according to the expert, include customizable push notifications alert with CAT application users of machine operating condition, even if they don’t check into the application every day.</p>
      <p>“This application is available on both IOS and Android and can be freely downloaded from Apple and Google play store. Once downloaded, the user can log in by using existing credentials to load previously stored CAT machine data,” the Mantrac Tanzania Product Support Manager explained.</p>
      <p>One of the customers who attended the training, Geoffrey Mtimbange from Twiga Cement Company said that with the new technology, they are able to save operating costs of the equipment while easily knowing areas that need improvement.</p>
      <p>“By using these digital products, we are now able to monitor and know the right time for conducting maintenance services, because the information is currently at our fingertips,” Mtimbange said.</p>
      <p>Mtibange’s observation was seconded by Pradeep Sinha who is a Manager at Mtibwa Sugar who said for many years they have been using machines from Mantrac especially Caterpillar heavy duty equipment. He said the training has helped them learn new ideas and make improvements where necessary. Mantrac Tanzania has been in operation since 1930 as sole authorized dealer for Caterpillar products.</p>
