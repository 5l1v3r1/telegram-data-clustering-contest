      <p>SUNRISE, Fla. – Ralph Krueger's plan was in jeopardy only 1:55 into the game Sunday night, when Evan Rodrigues skated slowly off the BB&amp;T Center ice.</p>
      <p>Rodrigues, one of only 11 forwards dressed for the Buffalo Sabres, did not return after suffering an undisclosed injury at the end of his 40-second shift. That forced defenseman Brandon Montour to play forward, a position in which he had not manned since junior hockey in Ontario.</p>
      <p>The early returns on Krueger's experiment were "erratic." However, goalie Linus Ullmark bought enough time for the Sabres to have a breakout performance that ended with a 5-2 win over the Florida Panthers.</p>
      <p>Montour's one assist as a fill-in at forward helped the Sabres (11-9-3) rebound from a stretch of nine losses in 10 games. Building on what Jack Eichel called a "full 60" could require a similar strategy Monday night in Tampa Bay, though.</p>
      <p>Rodrigues, who is the sixth Sabres forward to suffer an injury this month, will not play against the Lightning. That could force Krueger to again use his seven-defensemen alignment to cap this three-game road trip.</p>
      <p>"The way we play it’s about finding your role in the group," Krueger said. "Sometimes D men will be up in the front and forwards will be back and vice versa. It’s an easy style of play that you can step into that, but we definitely thought it was better to go 11-7 today. ... With Evan going down so quickly, that’s the strength of a player like Brandon Montour. ... He did a great job of filling in and helping us up front because it would have been tough with 10 forwards."</p>
      <p>The Sabres have lost Vladimir Sobotka (lower body), Marcus Johansson (upper body), Kyle Okposo (concussion) and Tage Thompson (upper body) since Nov. 1. Johan Larsson also missed three games with an upper-body injury before returning to the lineup Thursday in Boston.</p>
      <p>Those injuries forced the Sabres to recall Rasmus Asplund, Curtis Lazar and Thompson, who also went down late in the third period of his season debut on Nov. 17. Krueger had 12 forwards available Sunday against Florida but opted to dress defenseman Zach Bogosian, who had yet to play a game this season because he was working his way back from hip surgery.</p>
      <p>The thinking was Bogosian could bolster a penalty kill that had allowed at least one power-play goal in seven consecutive games, and there was some uncertainty how much ice time the 29-year-old would be able to handle. Additionally, Krueger wanted the unorthodox look to make his line changes "unpredictable" and an additional defenseman could potentially neutralize the Panthers' offense, which entered Sunday ranked second in the Eastern Conference with 86 goals in 23 games.</p>
      <p>The change seemed to have a negative impact in the early moments Sunday night. The Sabres struggled to cycle in the puck in the offensive zone, while wingers took turns double-shifting on a line with Larsson and Zemgus Girgensons.</p>
      <p>Their first power play almost crashed and burned when a turnover gave Panthers forward Colton Sceviour a breakaway. Ullmark, though, made a save that Krueger later called "a turning point in the game."</p>
      <p>Less than six minutes later, Krueger's strategy paid off when Jeff Skinner scored on a centering pass from Eichel to give the Sabres a 1-0 lead. Girgensons pushed the lead to two goals when his shot from the left-wing circle deflected off the stick of Florida defenseman Mark Pysyk and into the net with 1:37 remaining in the first period.</p>
      <p>Montour began the game on defense, only to switch to forward following the failed power play.</p>
      <p>"It’s tough," Eichel said of the Sabres having only 10 forwards following Rodrigues' exit. "Obviously, we’re a little banged up right now. We’re short up front, but I thought Monty stepped in and did a great job up on the wing. He caused a lot of havoc in their zone. He was good on the cycle, he was moving his feet, skating, so I thought it helped us out."</p>
      <p>Eichel, who finished with one goal among three points, pushed the lead to 3-0 with a remarkable individual effort 3:42 into the second period. The Sabres' 23-year-old captain skated a circle around Panthers forward Brian Boyle before firing a wrist shot into the net for his 14th goal in 23 games this season.</p>
      <p>Buffalo quickly lost momentum, though. Following a failed power play, Florida center Noel Acciari collected a loose puck in the slot and beat Ullmark with a wrist shot to cut the Panthers' deficit to two goals.</p>
      <p>The Panthers' onslaught continued with defenseman Aaron Ekblad hitting the post. However, Ullmark made 27 through two periods, and he was at his best during a game in which the Sabres were outshot, 45-26. That bought time for the Sabres' offense, which capitalized in transition when Sam Reinhart set up Victor Olofsson's eighth goal of the season during a 2-on-1 for a 4-1 lead late in the second.</p>
      <p>“Everyone can play with anyone," Girgensons said of playing with seven defensemen. "A lot of guys can play different positions. I think it’s a tougher job for Ralph to get the lineup together. He did a good job throughout the game mixing and matching together different guys. It was good.”</p>
      <p>Though the Sabres allowed a power-play goal for an eighth consecutive game, Girgensons' second goal with 6:35 remaining gave them the insurance they needed to pull away for their first road win over Florida since Nov. 12, 2015.</p>
      <p>"It wasn’t a perfect game and it was a strange game somehow," Krueger said. "I thought it was a little erratic. Some ups and downs during the game, but we definitely managed the game in a way that we’d like to see as far as finishing on opportunities, creating opportunities and then managing the lead right through."</p>
      <p>Krueger's 12-forward lineup had an impressive performance Thursday night in Boston, and the Panthers were playing their second game of a back-to-back. Additionally, only two Sabres forwards had scored over their previous five games.</p>
      <p>Seven defensemen seemed to be an unusual strategy for a struggling offense. However, as Krueger explained during his pregame availability, the key for the Sabres is to play within his system. Doing so will allow any lineup combination to succeed, he said.</p>
      <p>The goal now is to follow that blueprint Monday in Tampa Bay, regardless of who is on the ice for the Sabres.</p>
      <p>"It’s big to get a win here against a good hockey team and just build some confidence in our group that if we do the right things over and over we’ll get rewarded," Eichel said.</p>
