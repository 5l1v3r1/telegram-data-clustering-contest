      <p>Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham blocked a House resolution that would formally recognize the Turkish slaughter of Armenians during the first World War as a “genocide,” a report said.</p>
      <p>The South Carolina lawmaker <a href="https://www.axios.com/erdogan-turkey-kurds-movie-oval-office-trump-gop-senators-b9acd411-19f3-4de6-9003-0525a43114bd.html?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axiosam&amp;stream=top">told Axios</a> in a Saturday phone call that a White House official asked him to block the resolution — which <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/29/ilhan-omar-one-of-three-house-reps-to-vote-present-on-armenia-genocide-bill/">passed the House on Oct. 29</a> — following a Nov. 13 Oval Office meeting between Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and Trump.</p>
      <p>Graham told the outlet that a White House legislative affairs official asked him to “please object” to the resolution, which was going to be introduced in the Senate by Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez.</p>
      <p>“I said sure,” Graham said. “The only reason I did it is because he [Erdoğan] was still in town. … That would’ve been poor timing. I’m trying to salvage the relationship if possible.”</p>
      <p>“I’m not going to object next time,” Graham added.</p>
      <p>Moments before the dialogue between Graham and the White House staffer, Graham, who was present at the Oval Office meeting, butted heads with Erdoğan.</p>
      <p>After Erdoğan <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/14/turkeys-erdogan-showed-propaganda-film-about-kurds-in-the-oval-office-report/">played a propaganda video</a> portraying Kurdish fighters as terrorists, Graham asked the Turkish leader, “Do you want me to go get the Kurds to make one about what you’ve done?”</p>
      <p>Graham then got into a heated dispute with the Turkish leader over his country’s invasion in Syria, sources told Axios.</p>
      <p>Erdoğan took issue with Graham for his use of the word “invasion,” while Graham fought back against the Turkish leader for claiming that Turkey had helped fight ISIS.</p>
      <p>Axios also reported that last week the Armenian genocide resolution was again blocked by another Republican Senator, David Perdue, after Sen. Ted Cruz introduced it.</p>
      <p>“Senator Perdue objected due to concerns that passage of the resolution would jeopardize the sensitive negotiations going on in the region with Turkey and other allies,” Perdue’s spokesperson told the outlet.</p>
