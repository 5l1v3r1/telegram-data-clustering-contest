      <p>NEW YORK, Nov 25 — Computer and printer maker HP yesterday reiterated its rejection of Xerox’s US$33 billion (RM137.8 billion) takeover bid, saying the sum “significantly undervalues” the company.</p>
      <p>A tie-up would unite two firms with storied histories: Xerox was founded in 1906 and became a household name with its copy machine.</p>
      <p>HP, which traces its history back to 1939, began making audio equipment but ended up as one of the early leaders of the Silicon Valley tech industry.</p>
      <p>“We reiterate that we reject Xerox’s proposal as it significantly undervalues HP,” the HP board of directors said in a letter.</p>
      <p>“There continues to be uncertainty regarding Xerox’s ability to raise the cash portion of the proposed consideration.”</p>
      <p>Xerox last week said it was “very surprised” by HP’s first rejection of the cash-and-stock offer, which sets a value of US$22 per share for the computing firm.</p>
      <p>The offer represents a 29 per cent premium to HP’s recent average trading price, Xerox chairman and chief executive John Visentin said.</p>
      <p>Activist investor Carl Icahn recently told The Wall Street Journal that the tie-up was a “no-brainer” that would increase returns for shareholders of both companies.</p>
      <p>In the absence of a deal, Xerox said it would “take its compelling case to create superior value for our respective shareholders directly to your shareholders.” — AFP</p>
