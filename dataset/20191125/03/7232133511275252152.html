        <i>Ethereum price is facing an increase in selling versus the US Dollar, similar to <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/24/bitcoin-weekly-forecast-btc-aiming-key-6-5k-support/">bitcoin</a>. ETH remains at a risk of a drop towards the $125 support area.</i>

      <h3>Ethereum Price Analysis</h3>
      <p>In the weekly forecast, we discussed the chances of another breakdown below $145 in Ethereum against the US Dollar. ETH price remained in a bearish zone, failed to climb above the $155 resistance, and settled well below the 100 hourly simple moving average.</p>
      <p>As a result, there was a downside break below the $145 support area. The decline was such that the price broke the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the recent recovery from the $138 low to $155 high.</p>
      <p>Moreover, the price spiked below the $138 low and it is <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/24/ethereum-price-weekly-forecast-eth-at-risk-of-further-declines/">currently struggling to recover</a>. An immediate support is near the $135 level. It represents the 1.236 Fib extension level of the recent recovery from the $138 low to $155 high.</p>
      <p>If there are more downsides, the price is likely to test the $130 support area. Any further losses may perhaps push Ethereum towards the $125 support area in the near term. An intermediate support is near the 1.618 Fib extension level of the recent recovery from the $138 low to $155 high.</p>
      <p>On the upside, there are many resistances, starting with $142. Additionally, there is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $147 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.</p>
      <p>To start a decent recovery, the price must clear the $142 and $147 resistance levels. However, the main resistance is still near the $155 level and the 100 hourly simple moving average, above which there are high chances of a trend change from bearish to bullish.</p>
