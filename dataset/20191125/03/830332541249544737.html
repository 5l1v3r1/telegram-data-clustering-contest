      <p>(CNN) - Asian stocks advanced Monday, boosted by positive signals about a potential US-China trade deal.</p>
      <p>Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index opened up 1.1% and widened the gains to 1.9% in early trading. It's the top performer so far among major indexes in the region.</p>
      <p>Investors may also be paying attention to election results in Hong Kong. Pro-democracy candidates appear to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/24/asia/hong-kong-district-council-elections-intl/index.html">have made major gains</a> in the city's District Council elections. The elections have been framed as a de facto referendum on the almost <a href="https://www.cnn.com/specials/asia/hong-kong-protests-intl-hnk">six months of ongoing protests</a> in the semi-autonomous Chinese city.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, South Korea'sKospi index gained 1.2%. Japan's Nikkei 225 also rose 0.9%, while China's Shanghai Composite Index improved 0.7%.</p>
      <p>On Friday, President Donald Trump told Fox News that the United States and China <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/trump-us-china-trade-deal-very-close">were "potentially very close"</a> to reaching a deal.</p>
      <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping also said Friday in Beijingthat he wanted to work out an agreement based on "mutual respect and equality," according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-22/china-s-xi-stresses-need-for-equality-in-phase-one-trade-deal">news re</a><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-22/china-s-xi-stresses-need-for-equality-in-phase-one-trade-deal">ports</a>.</p>
      <p>The Chinese government on Sunday calling for <a href="http://www.china.org.cn/china/2019-11/25/content_75442345.htm">stronger protections of intellectual property rights</a>. That kind of action, though, would address <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2018/03/23/technology/china-us-trump-tariffs-ip-theft/index.html">a key concern</a> by the United States as the two countries negotiate a trade deal.</p>
      <p>US futures rose during Asian trading hours Monday following a higher close at the end of last week. Futures for the Dow, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq were up between 0.2% and 0.4%.</p>
