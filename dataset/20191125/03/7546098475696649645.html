      <h1>Is the Rio Tinto share price good value in November?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T03:06:35+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 03:06</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fool.com.au/author/kennethhallau/" target="_blank">Kenneth Hall</a></address>
      <p>The <b>Rio Tinto Limited </b><a href="https://www.fool.com.au/company/Rio+Tinto+Limited/?ticker=ASX-RIO">(ASX: RIO)</a> share price has had an up and down year in 2019. </p>
      <p>The Aussie miner’s shares are up 25.37% to be marginally ahead of the <b>S&amp;P/ASX 200 Index </b>(INDEXASX: XJO) this year.</p>
      <p>The benchmark index has gained 20.73% year to date after hitting a new record higher earlier in 2019.</p>
      <p>But is Rio Tinto cheap at its current price of $96.10 per share, or should you be steering clear?</p>
      <h3>Why the Rio share price is up in 2019</h3>
      <p>The Rio Tinto share price has climbed higher alongside many of the ASX miners in 2019.</p>
      <p><b>BHP Group Ltd </b><a href="https://www.fool.com.au/tickers/ASX-BHP/">(ASX: BHP)</a> and <b>Fortescue Metals Group Limited </b><a href="https://www.fool.com.au/company/Fortescue+Metals+Group+Limited/?ticker=ASX-FMG">(ASX: FMG)</a> shares have also rocketed higher as commodities have rebounded in 2019.</p>
      <p>The US–China trade war tensions have added volatility in 2019, but the Aussie miners have enjoyed relatively strong earnings.</p>
      <p>The company’s shares climbed higher on the back of <a href="https://www.fool.com.au/2019/08/01/rio-tinto-announces-us4-9-billion-half-year-profit-and-us1-billion-special-dividend/">strong earnings</a> throughout the year. Rio reported underlying EBITDA of US$10.3 billion, up 11% on the prior corresponding period.</p>
      <p>Rio increased its cash flow from operations up 39% to US$7.2 billion with total free cash flow of US$4.7 billion.</p>
      <p>However, the strong start to the year has tailed off as the Rio Tinto share price has fallen 8.71% lower in the last 6 months.</p>
      <h3>Is Rio good value right now?</h3>
      <p>The Rio Tinto share price currently trades at 8.23x earnings, making it relatively good bang for your buck right now.</p>
      <p>Fortescue shares (6.42x earnings) are marginally cheaper on a relative value basis, while BHP shares trade at 15.43x earnings.</p>
      <p>However, <a href="https://www.fool.com.au/2019/10/22/is-the-bhp-share-price-an-asx-dividend-buy/">BHP shares are yielding 5.07% per annum</a> compared to Rio’s 4.16% dividend yield.</p>
      <p>On balance, I’d say that Rio is marginally better value than BHP right now, despite the trade-off for dividend income.</p>
      <p>The BHP share price has climbed just 10.42% higher in 2019 while Fortescue shares are up 128.92% since the start of the year.</p>
