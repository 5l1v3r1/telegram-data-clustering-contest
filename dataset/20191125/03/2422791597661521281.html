      <h1>North Korea conducts artillery firings at Kim's order</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T03:27:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 03:27</time> by <a rel="author">The Associated Press, Staff</a></address>
      <p>SEOUL, Korea, Republic Of - North Korea says leader Kim Jong Un has visited a frontline island and ordered troops there to practice firing artillery.</p>
      <p>The North's Korean Central News Agency said Monday that the firing happened when Kim inspected a military unit on Changrin Islet near the disputed sea boundary with South Korea.</p>
      <p>It was Kim's first known visit to frontline troops since he entered nuclear talks with the United States last year.</p>
      <p>Those talks remains stalled since Kim's second summit with President Donald Trump in February.</p>
      <p>KCNA says Kim ordered artillery troops to fire before indicating the target for them. It says the troops "fully showed their gun firing skills" and "delighted the supreme leader."</p>
      <p>Seoul's Defence Ministry expressed regret over the drills, saying they violated last year's tension-reduction deals between the Koreas.</p>
