      <h1>Ant McPartlin's ex-wife Lisa Armstrong's new dig with cosmetics collection name</h1>
      <h2>The former couple clashed over who got to keep pet dog Hurley so the chocolate lab splits his time between their two homes - but now she is making her point</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T03:59:55+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 03:59</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Elliott, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/sam-elliott/</a></address>
      <p>Lisa Armstrong appears to have taken a swipe at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/ant-mcpartlin">Ant McPartlin</a> with the name of her new cosmetics collection.</p>
      <p>His ex-wife has reportedly called the products after their pet dog who they share amid a custody feud.</p>
      <p>Make-up artist Lisa will name range “Lisa Loves Hurley”, report <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10414593/ant-mcpartlin-dig-lisa-harley/">The Sun</a> .</p>
      <p>She wanted to keep the labrador full-time - but Ant is determined to spend half the time with the pup.</p>
      <p>“It’s a way for her to say ‘F*** you’ to Ant, and a declaration of how much she loves Hurley," said a source.</p>

      <p>"He’s been there by her side through all the mess Ant created.</p>
      <p>“She has always been upset that Ant couldn’t just let her have custody of Hurley who she sees as her baby.</p>
      <p>“She knows that Ant loves Hurley as well but she really hoped he would be the bigger man and let her at least have custody of him after all she has been through."</p>
      <p>It comes as Lisa has rejected a proposed settlement of £31million - half of Ant's £62million fortune - as well as their former marital home in London's upmarket Chiswick.</p>

      <p>Instead, Lisa's said to be wanting her day in court and has so far refused to sign Ant's non-disclosure agreement (NDA) that would be part of any financial settlement her legal team thrashes out with his.</p>
      <p>Last week she savagely liked several tweets slating Ant and his new girlfriend - Lisa's former friend and personal assistant - Anne-Marie Corbett, and begged followers: "Don't believe the lies."</p>
      <p>Dog behaviourist and trainer <a href="http://www.dog-ease.co.uk/">Adem Fehmi</a> told us: "Dogs can deal with change like we can.</p>
      <p>"They can be very tolerant, although it does depend on the individual dog...</p>

      <p>"[Often divorce can be better for the animal] as stressful environments and arguments can cause problems [for the dog].</p>
      <p>"After splits that's decreased... Chocolate Labs tend to be very robust, they don't tend to be stressy. They're a very good breed."</p>
