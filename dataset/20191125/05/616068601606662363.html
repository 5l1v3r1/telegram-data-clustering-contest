      <p>Marking its 75th year in business,  the Summerland Credit Union has made a $75,000 donation to the Community Foundation of the South Okanagan.</p>
      <p>One of the credit union’s largest donations ever, the funds will go into a “legacy fund” to be used on community projects. </p>
      <p>“The Community Foundation is excited to partner with Summerland Credit Union in its 75th year. The credit union has made a huge contribution to Summerland over the years, and this donation will ensure that its impact continues into the future,” says CFSO executive director Aaron McRann.</p>
      <p>A committee comprised of Summerland Credit Union directors, along with the Community Foundation, will distribute grants annually from the fund.</p>
      <p>“The donation is for the benefit of all people in our credit union community. It is our hope that in 75 years we can look back at this initial seed money and wonder if we could have imagined how many lives it could touch, and what it could become,” says Summerland Credit Union CEO Kelly Marshall.</p>
      <p>The Summerland Credit Union was founded by 10 members in 1944. It is now the second-largest single branch credit union in Canada, with more than 7,200 members.</p>
