      <p>78 TNBC biopsies from patients with different responses to chemotherapy were analysed for <a href="https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000166181-API5/pathology">API-5 expression before any treatment.</a></p>
      <p>Further studies on API-5 expression and inhibition were performed on patient-derived TNBC xenografts, one highly sensitive to <a href="https://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatments-and-side-effects/treatment-types/chemotherapy/how-chemotherapy-drugs-work.html">chemotherapies</a> and the other resistant to most tested drugs.</p>
      <p>Clinical analyses of the 78 TNBC biopsies revealed that API-5 was more markedly expressed in endothelial cells before any treatment among patients with chemoresistant TNBC, and this was associated with greater micro-vessel density.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Melanie_Di_Benedetto">Dr. Melanie Di Benedetto</a> and Dr. Guilhem Bousquet said, "<i>Apoptosis Inhibitor-5 (API-5) also called Anti-Apoptosis Clone 11 (AAC-11) is a 58-kDa nuclear protein highly conserved across species.</i>"</p>
      <p>API-5 was originally identified as an <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/cdd201730">anti-apoptotic protein</a> in mouse fibroblasts and in human cervical carcinoma cell lines, in which API-5 significantly enhanced cell survival after serum deprivation or ultraviolet sensitization.</p>
      <p>In vitro, a decrease in API-5 expression sensitized human cancer cell lines to apoptosis, and increased their sensitivity to anticancer drugs.</p>
      <p>In human <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/osteocarcinoma">osteocarcinoma</a> cells, API-5 promotes survival through the inhibition of an E2 promoter-binding factor, and the integrity of the leucine zipper domain is required for the anti-apoptotic functions of API-5.</p>
      <p>Previous authors engineered an anti-API5 peptide composed of the LZ domain fused with the Antennapedia/Penetrating protein domain since the integrity of this domain is essential for the function of API-5. This LZ peptide is able to penetrate cells in vitro, and to cancel the API-5/acinus interaction.</p>
      <p>In this pre-clinical study, the authors studied the expression of API-5 in patients with chemotherapy-resistant <a href="https://www.nationalbreastcancer.org/triple-negative-breast-cancer">TNBC</a> and the inhibition of API-5 in a resistant TNBC xenograft model.</p>
      <p>The Benedetto/Bousquet Research Team concluded that Hypoxia is associated with drug resistance and they have previously demonstrated a link between <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3496019/">cancer stem-cells</a>, hypoxic niches and resistance to sunitinib in renal cell carcinoma.</p>
      <p><i>In vivo</i>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxia_(medical)">hypoxia</a> has been shown to induce resistance to apoptosis in human cervical cancer cell lines through a selection of p53-mutated cells.</p>
