      <p>Lev Parnas, an associate of President Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, has given photographs and audio and video recordings to the House Intelligence Committee, several people with knowledge of the matter <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/house-intelligence-committee-possession-video-audio-recordings-giuliani/story?id=67276448&amp;cid=clicksource_4380645_null_hero_hed">told ABC News.</a></p>
      <p>Parnas and his business partner Igor Fruman were arrested in October and charged with campaign finance law violations; they have pleaded not guilty. Last year, Parnas and Fruman were sent to Ukraine by Giuliani to find damaging information on Democrats, and they both received congressional subpoenas for their records. Initially, Parnas said he would not comply, and Fruman still has not cooperated.</p>
      <p>Some of the recordings and photographs Parnas turned over include Giuliani and Trump, ABC News reports, and he also submitted documents in English and Ukrainian. The House Intelligence Committee only received the material last week, and some of the requested items are currently in the possession of federal investigators with the Southern District of New York.</p>
      <p>Joseph A. Bondy, an attorney for Parnas, released a statement on Sunday saying Parnas "has vociferously and publicly asserted his wish to comply" with the subpoena and his "evidence and potential testimony is non-partisan, and not intended to be part of a battle between the left and the right, but rather an aid in the determination of our government of what is in the best interests of our nation."</p>
