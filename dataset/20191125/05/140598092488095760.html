      <h1>Green card law change will push up Britons’ wait</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T05:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 05:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/olivia-rudgard/" target="_blank">Olivia Rudgard</a></address>
      <p>British tech and finance workers will find it harder to get jobs in the US under proposed green card law changes.</p>
      <p>A divisive bill, backed by big tech companies, is designed to clear a backlog of Indian applicants, some of whom have to wait decades to get permanent permission to live and work in the US.</p>
      <p>But it would also push up waiting times for immigrants from other countries, including the UK. Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, IBM and Facebook have all pushed for it to pass, and it has support from both Democrats and Republicans. </p>
      <p>Genie Doi, a Los Angeles-based lawyer and founder of immigration firm immigrate.la, said: “It’s extremely beneficial both for Indian and Chinese nationals because their green card waiting times will be reduced from 20, 30, 40, 50 years down to seven years.</p>
      <p>For everybody else, currently the green card waiting time is maybe one to two years. So a British national [who] would previously have had to wait two years, would now have to wait seven.”</p>
      <p>Andrew Johnson, a New York immigration lawyer, said the measure ­“destroys British employment” in the US because it stops people being able to settle down long-term, instead ­trapping them on visas which must be renewed every few years.</p>
      <p>Silicon Valley lawyer Gabriel Jack, of MJ Law which has dealt with many ­Indian and Chinese clients, said: “You are essentially going to put a massive burden now on people who are not from India and China.”</p>
