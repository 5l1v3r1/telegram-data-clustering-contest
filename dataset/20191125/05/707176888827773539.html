      <h2>Financial Reporting Council hires white-collar crime specialist Jamie Symington</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T05:00:42+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 05:00</time> by <a rel="author">Tabby Kinder, Caroline Binham</a></address>
      <p>The Financial Reporting Council has hired an enforcer with a formidable record as the “toothless” watchdog ramps up its powers over UK audit firms.</p>
      <p>Jamie Symington, a partner at law firm Brown Rudnick and former director of investigations at the Financial Conduct Authority, will join the FRC in February as deputy executive counsel. </p>
      <p>The white-collar crime specialist is the most recent appointment aimed at beefing up the capabilities of the FRC before it transforms into a new, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/84d1b2c0-0077-11ea-b7bc-f3fa4e77dd47">more powerful regulator</a> called the Audit, Reporting and Governance Authority.</p>
      <p>Last year the FRC hired Elizabeth Barrett, former head of dispute resolution at law firm Slaughter and May, to run its enforcement division, which is responsible for investigating and prosecuting accountants. Mr Symington will report directly to Ms Barrett. </p>
      <p>The FRC has also appointed ex-GlaxoSmithKline finance director Simon Dingemans as its new chairman, and Sir Jon Thompson, previously head of HM Revenue &amp; Customs, as its chief executive. The FRC’s previous management was forced to step down after a <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d6580162-4416-11e9-b168-96a37d002cd3">damning report</a> into the watchdog’s effectiveness.</p>
      <p>Mr Symington will join the FRC at the start of the third year of the watchdog’s biggest ever investigation as it looks into why KPMG repeatedly signed off the accounts of outsourcing giant <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/1368cd9a-58cf-11e8-bdb7-f6677d2e1ce8">Carillion</a> in the years before its collapse in January 2018. </p>

      <p>He will also add more force to the FRC as it investigates the audits of Thomas Cook, Patisserie Valerie, Mitie, BT Group and Rolls-Royce.</p>
      <p>The FRC has been criticised for being too soft on accountants and too slow to investigate potential misconduct. It was branded “toothless” by MPs during a parliamentary inquiry into the failure of Carillion.</p>
      <p>Under its new leadership — and following the introduction of legislation to cement ARGA as a statutory regulator — the watchdog will have more powers to sanction company directors and auditors, including the Big Four: PwC, Deloitte, EY and KPMG.</p>
      <p>The UK government has faced criticism in recent months for <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/42e27cee-ef6c-11e9-ad1e-4367d8281195">delaying</a> the necessary legislation to create ARGA, including by Sir John Kingman, the architect of the new regulator.</p>
      <p>The FRC levied £32m of <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/594c8bf2-b2e8-11e9-8cb2-799a3a8cf37b">fines</a> against UK accountants last year, almost three times more than in the previous year, as it attempted to combat accusations that it has been too lenient.</p>
      <p>Mr Symington joined the London office of <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/da1e4900-e571-11e7-97e2-916d4fbac0da">Brown Rudnick</a>, which is headquartered in Boston, in late 2017 after almost two decades at the FCA. At the City regulator he was one of three deputies to Mark Steward, the FCA’s head of enforcement. He started at the Financial Services Authority, the FCA’s predecessor, in 1999, after serving as a legal adviser at the Foreign Office.<br/><br/>As well as helping to set up the FCA’s criminal division, Mr Symington has worked on high-profile investigations during his time at the regulator, including that into Barclays’ arrangements with <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/dadda8fa-0d58-11e7-a88c-50ba212dce4d">Qatar</a> during the financial crisis. Mr Symington was also in the team that tried to fine <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/7c9b86be-0eb6-11e1-9dbb-00144feabdc0">John Pottage</a>, a former UBS senior director, for alleged inadequate supervision rather than for personal failings.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for Brown Rudnick said: “We would like to thank Jamie for his work whilst he has been with us and for helping to further establish our contentious financial regulatory practice. We understand that he sees the role at the FRC at this stage of its development as an exciting opportunity and we wish him all the best for the future.”</p>
