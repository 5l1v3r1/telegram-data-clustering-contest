      <p>The track featured on Malone’s latest album ‘Hollywood’s Bleeding’ and reportedly inspired Osbourne to begin working on new music.</p>
      <p>The performance saw Osbourne seated in a white throne at the back of the stage, while Malone and Scott performed from a podium in front of him. It was the <a href="http://nme.com/artists/black-sabbath">Black Sabbath</a> frontman’s second appearance <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/ozzy-osbourne-postpones-2020-uk-and-european-dates-2555689">since postponing his ‘No More Tours 2’ tour earlier this year</a> after suffering a series of health problems, including a staph infection and pneumonia. <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/ozzy-osbourne-makes-surprise-live-return-post-malone-collaboration-take-want-watch-2571149">He made a surprise appearance at Malone’s LA concert earlier this week</a> (November 22) to join him for the collaboration. </p>
