      <h1>KT links 5G network with satellite</h1>

      <p>South Korean operator KT transferred data between its 5G network and a satellite, claiming a world first using a hybrid transmission.</p>
      <p>In a statement, KT said the transmission enables more reliable data communication than existing 5G services by using a communication protocol which connects different networks. The operator plans to use satellite transmission for backhaul.</p>
      <p>KT added the core technology is a hybrid router, jointly developed by the KT Convergence Technology Institute and KT SAT, which allowed a 5G terminal to transmit and receive data simultaneously from the network and the satellite, or from each one if either service is disrupted.</p>
      <p>The test was conducted using the Mugunghwa 6 satellite, one of five operated by its affiliate KT SAT.</p>
      <p>KT said it will submit the results to 3GPP in 2020 to contribute to setting the global standard for the 5G-satellite technology.</p>
      <p>The operator, along with rivals SK Telecom and LG Uplus, <a href="https://www.mobileworldlive.com/featured-content/home-banner/korea-operators-set-consumer-5g-tariffs/">launched 5G service</a> in early April.</p>
