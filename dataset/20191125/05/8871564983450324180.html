      <h1>Court clears Thaksin’s son in Thai bank money laundering case</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T05:22:25+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 05:22</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/Coconuts%20Bangkok" target="_blank">Coconuts Bangkok</a></address>
      <p>The only son of fugitive former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra was acquitted today of money laundering charges.</p>
      <p>Panthongtae “Oak” Shinawatra, 39, walked out of the Central Criminal Court for Corruption and Misconduct Cases a free man just before 11am after judges found him not guilty, saying prosecutors had provided insufficient evidence of wrongdoing.</p>
      <p>He had been accused of helping launder money in a scandal involving loans fraudulently approved by a state-run bank amounting to nearly THB10 billion (US$43 million) 13 years ago during his father’s administration.</p>
      <p>Panthongtae had received a THB10 million check from that largesse, but the court determined that there was insufficient evidence that Panthongtae knew where the money came from.</p>
      <p>A billionaire in his own right, Panthongtae struck a more apolitical public stance until late last year when he joined the Pheu Thai Party, which was founded and is still guided by his father’s influence.</p>
      <p>Thaksin was deposed in a 2006 coup d’etat, and Panthongtae’s Voice TV television station frequently ran afoul of the military government which ousted his aunt, Yingluck Shinawatra, from power in 2014. It was ordered to cease broadcasting on several occasions for political commentary the junta objected to.</p>
