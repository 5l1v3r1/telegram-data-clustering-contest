      <h2>Charles Ellis, who abused six children, would brazenly sneak his hands down girls' clothing during lessons</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T05:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 05:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/luke-traynor/" target="_blank">Luke Traynor</a></address>
      <p>A mum told of her horror after her primary school daughter was sexually assaulted in front of other children during lessons by her teacher.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, Charles Ellis, now 60, was <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/paedophile-teacher-abused-six-young-17297550">found guilty of molesting six girls,</a> over an eight-year period, when they were aged eight or nine.</p>
      <p>The teacher, who was employed at a <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/greasby">primary school in Wirral</a>, targeted the pupils during class.</p>
      <p>The abuse happened when the pupils were with Ellis at his desk or at their own desks.</p>
      <p>Several pupils were assaulted on a number of occasions.</p>
      <p>The pervert <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/wirral">touched girls inappropriately by putting his hand on their backs</a> under their clothing, touching bottoms under and over clothing and touching their legs, prosecutors at Liverpool Crown Court said.</p>
      <p>Today, the mum who first blew the whistle on Ellis and whose daughter first complained to the school and police about <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/education">the teacher's conduct,</a> described him as a "danger to children".</p>
      <p>She told the ECHO: "Ellis kept on singling her out.</p>

        <figcaption>Charles Ellis, 60, of Oakfield Drive, Upton in Chester, was convicted of ten offences of sexually assaulting six girls, who were just eight and nine-years-old at the time.</figcaption>

      <p>"He would ask why she was not going to after school club.</p>
      <p>"I would have regular arguments with him in the playground about his behaviour.</p>
      <p>"I went to the headteacher with my concerns."</p>
      <p>Her daughter confessed to her mum years later what Ellis had done.</p>
      <p>The teacher would approach her in class, putting his hand down the back of her dress and inside her knickers.</p>
      <p>But the child was too young to understand what was happening, so she remained silent.</p>

      <p>The parent added: "Ellis is not getting away with what he did to those children.</p>
      <p>"How dare he do these things?</p>
      <p>"I want everyone to know what he has done."</p>
      <p>Ellis, of Oakfield Drive, Upton, Chester, was warned to expect a jail sentence when he returns for his sentencing next month.</p>

        <figcaption>Six children were sexually abused by teacher Charles Ellis</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>He was employed at the school since 2002.</p>
      <p>One of the victims complained to her mum about his behaviour and in 2013 he was spoken to by police.</p>
      <p>But no prosecution was brought and he was given further training about not touching children inappropriately.</p>
      <p>The paedophile was "motivated by sexual gratification” and "abused his position of trust", the trial heard.</p>
      <p>A member of staff had also twice reported feeling uncomfortable about his touching some of the girl pupils.</p>
      <p>He was suspended by the school in April 2017.</p>

      <p>Charlotte Kenny, prosecuting, said that Ellis, who has no previous convictions, was “a man who appears not to be able to control himself”.</p>
      <p>The mum added: "If it wasn't for my daughter coming forward, Ellis would still be abusing children now.</p>
      <p>"She finally found the courage to speak out when she saw Ellis outside our house, talking to the caretaker, and she blurted out 'I can't believe he's still a teacher at that school'."</p>
      <p>The girl confided in her mum, who says she was "devastated" by the allegations.</p>
      <p>She added: "How can Ellis live with himself, knowing what he's done to these kids?</p>
      <p>"If he had those urges, he should have never become a teacher.</p>
      <p>"He should be taken out of society.</p>
      <p>"My daughter has had to go to counselling and she has self-harmed.</p>
      <p>"She's on anti-depressant tablets.</p>
      <p>"How can he sleep at night?"</p>
