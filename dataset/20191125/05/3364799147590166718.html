      <p><a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/uber-stock?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest">Uber's</a> stock was set to sink Monday morning after the ride-hailing firm <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/uber-loses-london-licence-2019-11?r=US&amp;IR=T?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest">lost its license to operate in London</a>.</p>
      <p>The stock was down 6.3% in premarket trading as of 10:30 a.m. in London (5:30 a.m. ET) after the regulator Transport for London said it found a "<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/uber-loses-london-licence-2019-11?r=US&amp;IR=T?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest">pattern of failures</a>" that put the safety of passengers in the city at risk. </p>
      <p>The stock drop would wipe $3 billion off the $50.4 billion market cap Uber closed with on Friday. </p>
      <p>TfL said it found that 14,000 trips had been conducted by unauthorized drivers who were using approved Uber driver accounts to pick up passengers.</p>
      <p>Uber has 21 days to appeal the decision, and in a statement emailed to Business Insider it said it planned to appeal, calling Tfl's decision "extraordinary and wrong."</p>
      <p>Neil Wilson, the chief markets analyst at Markets.com, said the London license removal would "unnerve investors."</p>
      <p>"It sends a worrying signal to the market about the regulatory overhang the company faces — if London goes this way there is a risk that other cities could follow," he said.</p>
      <p>"London is one of five cities that combined account for about a quarter of revenues — so it's a big deal in terms of raw revenues," he added. "The problem Uber faces is that there is no shortage of competition to step in, so once gone it could be forgotten pretty quickly."</p>
