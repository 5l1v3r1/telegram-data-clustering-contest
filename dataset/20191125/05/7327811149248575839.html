      <p>SUNSET PARK, Brooklyn (WABC) -- A major water main break caused quite a mess in a Brooklyn neighborhood Sunday morning.</p>
      <p>It happened at about 4:20 a.m. near 5th Avenue and 44th Street in Sunset Park.</p>
      <p>The break sent thousands of gallons of water shooting out of the ground and pouring down the street, flooding 4th Avenue as well as 5th Avenue.</p>
      <p>Pieces of pipe, broken pavement and other debris were scattered for blocks.</p>
      <p>Police have been re-directing traffic around the area, with about five blocks closed.</p>
      <p>Drivers were advised to avoid the area of 4th and 5th Avenues from 39th Street to 44th Street.</p>
      <p>The Department of Environmental Protection responded to the scene, along with the NYPD and FDNY.</p>
      <p>Utility crews were able to locate the source of the break and turn off the water. The cause of the incident is not yet known.</p>
      <p>There are no reports of injuries.</p>
      <p>The water main break also affected some subway service in the area.</p>
