      <h1>Vikings Raiders def. Undisputed ERA and The New Day</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T05:00:05+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 05:00</time> by <a rel="author">WWE.com</a></address>
      <p>The Viking Raiders have built an impressive résumé in 2019, and the reigning Raw Tag Team Champions strengthened their budding legacy with a victory over their counterparts on NXT and SmackDown — Undisputed ERA and The New Day, respectively — at Survivor Series.</p>
      <p>The championship squads showed why they’re considered three of the greatest ever assembled, with cohesive offenses like Big E and Kofi Kingston teaming up for a powerbomb–double stomp combination. </p>
      <p>That move seemingly gave momentum to The New Day, but instead led to Kyle O’Reilly &amp; Bobby Fish and Erik &amp; Ivar taking out the 7-time champions, leaving it down to just the squads from Raw and NXT. </p>
      <p>Ivar showcased amazing athleticism by cartwheeling to avoid Total Elimination, then dropping O’Reilly &amp; Fish with a back handspring double clothesline. Erik then tagged in, setting up the Raw champions for their Viking Experience maneuver to give Raw its first victory of the night.</p>
