      <p>HOUSTON (AP) — Luka Doncic scored 41 points, Tim Hardaway Jr. added a season-high 31 and the Dallas Mavericks never trailed in a 137-123 victory over the Houston Rockets on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The Mavericks scored 45 points in the first quarter and were up 78-60 at halftime. Hardaway had 19 in the half, Doncic 17 and Kristaps Porzingis 15.</p>
      <p>The Mavericks has won five straight, scoring at least 137 in the last three. Houston has lost three straight after winning eight in a row.</p>
      <p>James Harden had 32 points for Houston but was just 2 of 15 on 3-pointers in a game where the Rockets made 10 of 44 3-point attempts.</p>
      <p>CLIPPERS 134, PELICANS 109</p>
      <p>LOS ANGELES (AP) — Montrezl Harrell tied a career-high with 34 points and had 12 rebounds, Kawhi Leonard added 26 points and Los Angeles beat New Orleans for its fifth straight victory.</p>

He was 13 of 14 from the foul line, where the Nets had a whopping 27-9 advantage in makes.</p>
