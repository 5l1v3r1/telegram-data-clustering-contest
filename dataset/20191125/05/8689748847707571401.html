      <p>Poaching and defection are very common in the media landscape and it’s something that will continue for a long time.</p>
      <p>Just recently, the likes of Berla Mundi, Giovanni Caleb, Vim Lady, Captain Smart and other great media personalities have crossed carpet to the opposing end, a situation which was trailed by so much controversies.</p>
      <p>And it’s like Nana Aba Anamoah, who is one of the hottest cakes in the media fraternity, could follow suit.</p>
      <p>How is it possible that Nana Aba Anamoah who is still with GHOne TV congratulated a competitor for winning an award over them?</p>
      <p>That’s what she did and although some might think it’s harmless, it sends loads of signals from our perspective.</p>
      <p>She sent a congratulatory message to United TV (UTV) for emerging as the TV station of the year (Akan) at the just ended 24th Ghana Journalists Association Awards on her Instagram page.</p>
      <p>She wrote;</p>
      <p>“Congratulations to the @utvghana team too for emerging as the TV station of the year (Akan). Mo y3 gam!”</p>
