      <h1>I am what I am today because of my dad: Dhruv Vikram</h1>

      <p>“If you like my performance, all the credit must go only to my dad. I am what I am today because of him. Also, when a film does well, everybody talks about the ‘hero’, but my contribution is just 20 percent,” said Dhruv Vikram at the success meet of Adithya Varma, which was held in the city on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Dhruv added, “My dad is the best actor according to me, but he is even a better father. For the last 10 months, he has not been working on his films. He was by my side, helping me throughout. Had he got a project like Adithya Varma when he was 22, his career would have been entirely different.”</p>
      <p>Dhruv Vikram said he believed in his dad Vikram’s intuition. “He has always been right in a lot of things. So, when he chose Arjun Reddy remake to launch me, I knew it was going to work,” the actor said.</p>
      <p>Adithya Varma director Gireesaaya added, “Without Vikram sir, there is no Adithya Varma. So far, we have got excellent feedback about Dhruv’s performance and he deserves all the love that comes his way.”</p>

      <p>It was equally an emotional moment for Vikram. “Nothing can make a father more proud. The entire media fraternity has appreciated Dhruv and the film. I am immensely thankful to all of you. All of you have been a big strength. I am touched and honoured,” he said.</p>
      <p>Further, Vikram went on to thank Sandeep Vanga, the director of Arjun Reddy. “His story is so wonderful. I love you Sandeep for this. Thank you for creating such a wonderful script,” he said. In addition, the actor said he would be indebted to producer Mukesh, who had cast Dhruv after seeing a dubsmash video.</p>
      <p>Vikram also extended his heartfelt thanks to cinematographer Ravi K Chandran. “Ravi’s aesthetic sense is the film’s biggest strength!”</p>
      <p>Director Bala was initially roped in to direct the Tamil remake of Arjun Reddy titled Varmaa. But, the project was scrapped and reshot as the producers weren’t happy with the output. The heroine was changed as well.</p>
