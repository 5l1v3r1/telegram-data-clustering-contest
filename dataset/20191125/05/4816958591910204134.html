      <p>Freshman Isaiah Stewart’s 25 points led hot-shooting No. 25 Washington to an 88-69 win over San Diego on Sunday night in Seattle.</p>
      <p>Stewart added seven rebounds, fellow McDonald’s All-American Jaden McDaniels scored 20 points on 7-of-10 shooting and Nahziah Carter had 16 points and seven rebounds for the Huskies (5-1). Quade Green dished off 10 assists.</p>
      <p>Six games into their college careers, Stewart and McDaniels set career highs in points. Stewart has scored in double figures in every game this season.</p>
      <p>The Huskies won their third straight game and achieved their highest point total in a game this season, hitting 32 of 56 shots for the game for a field goal percentage of 57.</p>
      <p>Marion Humphrey’s 13 points led San Diego (2-5). Jared Rodriguez scored 12 points and Alex Floresca added 10, but the Toreros lost their third straight game and second to a top-25 opponent this season.</p>
      <p>San Diego has also lost to another No. 25 team, Colorado, when the Buffaloes were ranked there last weekend.</p>
      <p>Washington turned a six-point lead into a 66-43 lead in less than six minutes. The Huskies knocked down four 3-pointers in a 23-6 run, two for McDaniels, and put the game well out of reach.</p>
      <p>Stewart took a pass from Green and spun for a two-handed dunk for a 68-43 Washington lead with 11:07 to go.</p>
      <p>The Toreros took a 23-21 lead on a Rodriguez layup with 5:37 left in the first half. It was the last lead they had in the game, as the Huskies scored 20 points over the final 5:27 of the half to take a 41-30 lead into halftime.</p>
      <p>Stewart had 14 of his points in the first half, McDaniels had 11 and Carter 10 as Washington went 16 for 28 (57 percent) from the floor.</p>
