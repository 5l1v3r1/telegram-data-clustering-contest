      <h1>Victoria power bills to increase in 2020</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T05:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 05:00</time> by <a rel="author">Noel Towell</a></address>
      <p>More than 120,000 Victorian households can expect their electricity bills to increase nearly 8 per cent - or about $110 - next year.</p>
      <p>The state's energy regulator signed off on Monday to an increase in the "Victorian Default Offer", which is supposed to act as a price-cap for electricity customers who do not shop around for a better deal.</p>
      <p>The picture is even more grim for small businesses on the default offer, which will see average bills soar from $5900 to $6400 next year.</p>
      <p>From January, the average domestic bill will jump from around $1410 to about $1520, an increase nearly four times the rate of inflation.</p>
      <p>Despite the increases, the Essential Services Commission insists the default offer, which was introduced in July, is saving customers money.</p>

      <p>"We estimate that the annual bill for a typical domestic customer on the VDO in 2020 could be around $200 to $330 per year lower than prior to the introduction of the VDO," the commission wrote in its decision.</p>
      <p>"The annual bill for a typical small business customer could be around $1000 to $1600 lower than prior to the introduction of the VDO."</p>
      <p>The commission said the VDO is often not the best deal and encouraged customers to shop around, or at least read their electricity bill, because retailers are now required by law to tell their customers if there is a better offer out there.</p>
      <p>"The VDO does not necessarily reflect the best offer available to customers. Customers may be able to access a market offer with better prices than the VDO," the commission wrote.</p>
      <p>"We note that under recent reforms implemented by the commission, a retailer must regularly tell customers whether they are on the retailer's best energy plan, and how much the customer could save by switching."</p>
