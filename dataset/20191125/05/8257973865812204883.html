      <p>Nov. 25 (UPI) -- Philippine troops on Monday rescued a British businessman and his Filipino wife who were abducted last month from a beach resort by gunmen linked to the <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Islamic-State/?tps=1">Islamic State</a>.</p>
      <p>Maj. Gen. Corleto Vinluan Jr., commander of the Joint Task Force Sulu, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/KutaHeneralTeodulfoBautistaALAKDAN/posts/1254984658038501?__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARAshmhqmWfaczm3O3kCQEVmyye9YdTVKT7VqYu1hoK55lNlIX5f1aN6GPbduxt8ydDG36mm-Adfg_9stBtsRz4LXqMmXMHVNwZsH5ZYhPRJRRcoJiq22peSxgOPfwy8zRtDlJO8pGHbeIiwAMnBGwvgXWAhn1cUoglkNjjBDI7iQcA4gSe1DDQHzuYG2tet2hhjEVB7VWtZa4j_NB2l9tvRQnx36ar7Ur1QhPuIK49_KKe_0J2BlJumYLM-h7wVZPOGxDzzrV8Wn7IwNlMZQTCHwys7TMRwqKwQOy6rOd7FhXa2td-mYJyuvajW__7ufaaqUchbD9Cau_IWV6qwIBgGtAfB&amp;__tn__=-R">said troops</a> of the 2nd Special Forces Battalion rescued Allan Hyrons, 70, and his wife, Wilma Paglinawan-Hyrons, from the Abu Sayyaf militant group in Parang, Sulu Province, following several days of armed conflict.</p>
      <p>"Our troops were able to close in on the Abu Sayyaf group and engaged them in a 20-minute firefight," Vinluan said in a statement. "Overwhelmed by our forces, they withdrew from the site, allowing our soldiers to rescue the couple."</p>
      <p>Vinluan said pressure from the Philippine military forced the Islamic militant group to hide their hostages with the protection of only a few guards in order to avoid detention.</p>
      <p>However, their movements were monitored by the military, who had driven them to a "designated constriction area."</p>
      <p>"Our unrelenting efforts to flush out these terrorists allowed our troops to pinpoint the location of the enemy and finally free the kidnap victims," Vinluan said.</p>
      <p>The couple was abducted Oct. 4 by six armed men from a beach resort in Tukuran, Zamboanga del Sur Province, prompting the police and military to launch search-and-rescue operations.</p>
      <p>Lt. Gen. Cirilito Sobejana said troops were still on the ground and in <a href="https://www.rappler.com/nation/245709-military-says-kidnapped-couple-allan-wilma-hyrons-rescued-abu-sayyaf">"hot pursuit"</a> of the militant group to rescue three Indonesians who had been abducted by the group known for attempting to extort ransom for kidnappings in the area.</p>
