      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T05:01:55+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 05:01</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/profile/author/raakhi-jagga/" target="_blank">Raakhi Jagga</a></address>
      <p>For the fifth Sunday in a row, unemployed teachers protested outside the residence of Punjab Education Minister Vijayinder Singla in Sangrur forcing a crackdown by the police. Protesters and cops clashed at the site and six protesters were hospitalised after police used water cannons and lathi-charged those trying to gherao the minister’s residence.</p>
      <p>Farmer leader Manjeet Singh Dhaner, who was recently pardoned by the Governor after being sentenced for life in a murder case, was also part of this Sunday’s protest.</p>
      <p><i><a href="https://indianexpress.com/">The Indian Express</a></i> explains the reason behind the protest that refuses to die down.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Who are the protesters?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Unemployed Teacher Eligibility Test (TET) pass BEd teachers from 28 different associations in the state. Apart from them Elementary Trained Teachers (ETT) and farmer unions are also part of the protest.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Where are they protesting?</b>
      </p>
      <p>TET teachers are on indefinite dharna outside the DC office since September 8. Elementary trained teachers are sitting atop a water tank on Sunam road since September 8. There are hundreds at these spots every day. But every Sunday, the number swells as they approach the Education Minister’s residence for protest.</p>
      <p>At 6 pm on Sunday teachers ended their day’s protest after SDM Sangrur said their demand will be raised in the first Cabinet meeting after CM Capt Amarinder Singh returns from his Europe tour. Dharna was lifted from outside minister’s residence after this assurance, but indefnite dharna will continue, said the teachers.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What is the issue?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Punjab Cabinet had made an amendment in 2018 that for fresh recruitment pass percentage in BA should be 55 per cent for general as well as reserved categories while earlier for reserved categories, it was 45 per cent and 50 per cent for general category. Associations want the amendment to be cancelled. In addition to this, maximum age limit for recruiting a general category teacher is 37 years, while 42 years for reserved category. Protesters want that it should be 42 and 47 years, respectively. For ETT teachers, earlier Class 12 pass student was eligible for ETT while now graduation has been kept as the condition for doing ETT. The protesters want the government to revert to the earlier norm.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What is government’s stand?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Education Minister Vijayinder Singla told The Indian Express said, “We strongly feel that teachers should at least have 55 per cent marks in graduation. However, they want previous percentage to be implemented yet again. I had told them the decision was taken in Cabinet and hence matter will be taken up again in Cabinet. But they want this decision overnight. On November 20, they had a meeting with me and on the 24th, they are staging yet another dharna outside my residence. This is not justified.”</p>
      <p>About age relaxation he said, “This seems to be an unrealistic demand. If a person gets recruited at 47 and retires at 58, state will have to bear all expenses of pension, gratuity etc of him just after 11 years of service. Still, I told them even this demand will be taken up in Cabinet. But their adamant behaviour is uncalled for.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>What do the teachers say?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Randeep Singh Sangatpura, spokesperson of a protesting teachers’ association, said, “We will continue our protest till our demands are not met. A large number of teachers have passed graduation with 45 per cent and 50 per cent marks for reserved as well as general categories, respectively. After that we did B.Ed and even passed TET. Now with this amendment, we are not even eligible to apply. We want age category also to be relaxed. Many students who have done ETT after Class 12,will not be fit for fresh recruitment. We have told them to implement it from fresh admissions in colleges and existing persons should continue with old conditions only.</p>
      <p>“On November 30, we will burn effigies across the state while from December 2-8, we will give memorandums to ministers. Cabinet meeting is expected to happen on December 8…We collect funds from villages and even kisan unions support us to meet expenses,” he added.</p>
