        <b>New Patriotic Party (NPP) Member of Parliament for Effutu constituency, Alexander Afenyo-Markin, has made a disclosure about the disposition of President Akufo-Addo towards Auditor General Daniel Domelovo regarding his work as a Government auditor.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Afenyo-Markin said Saturday on Newsfile on JoyNews monitored by <a href="http://MyNewsGh.com/">MyNewsGh.com</a> that it is not true that “the government doesn’t like him [Domelovo] or some people are after him.”</p>
      <p>According to the MP who doubles as Ghana Water Company Board Chairman, President Akufo-Addo and all senior members of government “respect” Daniel Domelovo.</p>
      <p>“Mr. Domelovo is well respected by senior members of this government and he is respected by the president. Nobody should create the impression that ‘the government doesn’t like him’ or some people are after him. Even if some people don’t like him, he should keep his calm.” Mr. Afenyo Markin said.</p>
      <p>“The systems that are working today, nobody can take him to court and jail him, how?” he added.</p>
      <p>Mr. Afenyo also advised the Auditor-General to remain calm and cooperate with ongoing investigations by the Economic and Organised Crime Office (EOCO).</p>
      <p>“He shouldn’t be emotional, he should not overly be engaging the media [and] he should relax,”</p>
      <p>On Mr. Domelovo’s decision not to cooperate with EOCO, the NPP MP said he doubts a lawyer gave Domelovo that advice. “I don’t think any lawyer will advise him not to go to EOCO. I don’t think Mr. Sory will give him that advice. He never said Thaddeus advised him.”</p>
