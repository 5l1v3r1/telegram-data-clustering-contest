      <p>When Melissa Jacobs' husband passed away in 2015, she thought she was left to care for her children by herself. But the community banded together in support for Jacobs and her family. She originally said no, but one of the parents at her children's school wouldn't take no for answer. Money was raised, food was donated and gifts were given to help the family grieve their loss.</p>
      <p>So when Melissa entered film school and was tasked to make a short film project, she thought this would be a perfect opportunity to give back to the community that supported her so strongly during her time of need.</p>
      <p>"We go out and we seek families through nominations from the community," says Jacobs. "We do fundraisers twice a year for families that might need a little bit of help."</p>
      <p>The short film is called Desiree, centred around a woman with kleptomania. Desiree is played by Sarah Podollan, who has an impressive resume. She has had roles in CSI NY, Austin Powers, That 70s Show and Boy Meets World. This is her first project since Rango in 2011, and she was excited about this short.</p>
      <p>"There's barely any dialogue in the movie which is a change from what I'm used to," says Podollan. "But I'm first and foremost a dancer, so I'm used to expressing emotion with my body and facial expressions. It wasn't too difficult to adjust."</p>
      <p>Desiree will be premiering at the Vernon Towne Cinema on Dec 22. All proceeds from ticket sales will go toward the six families that have been nominated for the kindness bags.
