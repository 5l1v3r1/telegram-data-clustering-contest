      <h1>India Insight: weak macro, resilient markets – ANZ</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T05:48:02+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 05:48</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fxstreet.com/author/anil-panchal" target="_blank">Anil Panchal</a></address>
      <p>Considering the latest concerns surrounding the Indian rupee (INR) and bond yields, seesawing around 71.48 and 6.48% ahead of Monday’s European session, the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ) came out with its own <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/analysis">analysis</a>.</p>
      <h3>Key quotes</h3>
      <p>“A universal question has popped up amongst investors. There has been a slew of bad news on the India macro story – slowing economy, financial sector problems and a worsening fiscal position. And yet, the Indian rupee and bond yields have remained remarkably resilient. What explains this?”</p>
      <p>“Ironically, it is the macro stresses that lie at the heart of this paradox. The associated slowing demand for credit, combined with rising <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/sentiment/risk-appetite">risk aversion</a>, is raising the proclivity of the financial sector to increase its exposure to government bonds.”</p>
      <p>“The rising surplus on the basic balance of payments (BoP) is not only anchoring the rupee, but allowing the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to inject <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies">liquidity</a> through its intervention in the FX markets.”</p>
      <p>“An official acknowledgment of the fiscal slippage may break the current trends in bond yields and the rupee, but only temporarily. A more sustained reversal will need to wait for a durable revival in growth.”</p>
