      <h1>Elderly man allegedly stabbed his wife to death</h1>

      <p>An elderly man accused of the stabbing murder of his wife in their home in Melbourne's north may have dementia and could not consent to having his DNA taken.</p>
      <p>Homicide detectives on Monday had to apply to a magistrate to take DNA from Ernest Fluder, 83, who allegedly killed his wife, Lucia Aurelia Fluder, in their Hadfield home on Wednesday or Thursday last week.</p>
      <p>Defence lawyer Will Collins-Putland told Melbourne Magistrates Court his client may not be capable of providing informed consent and also has problems with his hearing.</p>

      <p>“He ordinarily has a hearing aid ... he doesn’t have that in custody,” Mr Collins-Putland said.</p>
      <p>Homicide investigator Detective Leading Senior Constable Kevin Morgan told magistrate Johanna Metcalf police took photos to check for any defensive wounds or markings on his body.</p>
      <p>There were “slight marks”, Detective Morgan said, but nothing obvious.</p>
      <p>He said they needed his DNA to test against a weapon and blood found at the scene.</p>
      <p>Ms Metcalf granted the application.</p>
      <p>Prosecutor Tara Schultz told the court the family wanted the deceased’s name redacted from documents granted to media, citing privacy concerns, but Ms Metcalf said the Open Courts Act didn’t allow for that.</p>
      <p>The court heard the defendant will be assessed by forensic mental health specialists.</p>
      <p>Mr Fluder, who sat quietly in the dock, was remanded to reappear in court in March.</p>
