      <p>The United Nations Population and Development Organisation (UNFPA) targets at ending all forms of gender based violence and perverted practices against girls and women.</p>
      <p>Speaking in Dar es Salaam during a workshop to empower journalists on gender violence reporting, ahead of the 16 days campaign against gender violence and discrimination to women, girls and children, Seto Ojwando from Ministry of Health, Social Development, Gender, Elderly and Children underscored the need for stakeholders to work together in bringing GBV to an end.</p>
      <p>Ojwando who is in-charge in the department that fights against gender discrimination said, to date, there are some people who have been brutalized but yet unwilling to cooperate with the state organs including police for the culprits to be arrested.</p>
      <p>“The government and stakeholders should work together in providing education and condemn acts of violence although we still have a problem in some communities where people embrace such corrupt practices that lead to continued violence in the country,” said Ojwando.</p>
      <p>“There are those whose cases are brought to court, but they do not come to testify in the court. This has been contributing into presence of perverted acts against women and girls”, he noted.</p>
      <p>UNFPA Resident Representative in Tanzania, Jacqueline Mahon, said the organisation plans to end all forms of GBV by 2030.</p>
      <p>Mahon noted that UNFPA works with the police force, Child Human Rights Forum, TGNP Network and the government in implementing the National Anti-Violence programme against women and children.</p>
      <p>Head of the Gender and Children's Desk Unit from the Police Headquarters, Faiza Suleiman said violence is all over calling upon men to speak out such incidences.</p>
      <p>She said there are many men being abused by women but they never speak out because they are dominated by the patriarchal system.</p>
      <p>“Men are abused but they remain tight-lipped, they feel embarrassed to report to police gender desks,” said Faiza.</p>
      <p>Representative from TGNP Network, Beatrice Ezekiel, said journalists have a role to play in ending GBV calling upon them to properly use the coming 16 days campaign against GBV to educate the public on the negative impacts of such acts.</p>
      <p>The workshop was organised by UNFPA Tanzania and brought together various stakeholders including the police force, TGNP Network and Children's Dignity Forum (CDF).</p>
