      <h1>How To Watch The AMAs Tonight Without Cable</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T05:26:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 05:26</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.lifehacker.com.au/author/emily-price" target="_blank">Emily Price</a></address>
      <p>The American Music Awards are tonight. The action officially kicks off at 8pm ET and will be broadcast on ABC.</p>
      <p>Post Malone leads the pack in terms of nominations this year with seven. Ariana Grande and Billie Eilish are both a close second with six nominations.</p>
      <p>Taylor Swift will also be honoured at this year’s event as “Artist of the Decade.” If she’s able to take home 2 awards tonight she’ll also become the singer with the most AMAs ever. Currently, that title belongs to Michael Jackson who won 23 awards.</p>
      <p>If you have a television, then catching tonight’s ceremony is as easy as tuning in to your local ABC station using a digital antenna. If you don’t have a TV, or don’t have an antenna (why?!), you can also stream the ceremony on a number of popular platforms:</p>
      <p>
        <b>SlingTV</b>
      </p>
      <p>Sling TVs $US25 ($37)/month Orange package includes ABC. This is our cheapest option.</p>
      <p><b>YouTube TV, Hulu with Live TV,</b> <b>DirecTV Now</b></p>
      <p>YouTube TV, Hulu with Live TV, DirecTV Now all offer ABC and cost $US40 ($59)-$US45 ($66)/month.</p>
      <p>All of the streaming services offer free trials, so if you haven’t used them before you can sign up today and watch the games for free and then cancel your account before you’re being charged.</p>
      <p>And worth noting: Not every service offers ABC is every market. Make sure ABC is offered in your particular area before you sign up.</p>
