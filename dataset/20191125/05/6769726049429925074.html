      <p>MANDURAH tennis ace Lesley Hunt has been inducted into the Tennis West Hall of Champions (HOC).</p>
      <p>Four tennis stars made up the inaugural inductees.</p>
      <p>Hunt’s highest World Ranking in the Women’s Singles was number seven.</p>
      <p>She was also ranked third in Australia behind Margaret Court and Evonne Goolagong-Crawley.</p>
      <p>In recognition of her considerable achievements, Hunt was inducted into the WA Sports Hall of Champions in 1993.</p>
      <p>She was a semi-finalist in the Australian Open singles in 1971 and a quarter-finalist in the US Open four times between 1970-1978.</p>
      <p>She was also a regular semi-finalist or quarter-finalist in both singles and doubles in many other Grand Slam events in the 1970s and was notably a member of the winning Federation Cup Team alongside Court and Goolagong-Crawley in Perth in 1971.</p>
      <p>Hunt said she was proud to be inducted into the HOC.</p>
      <p>“It is probably one of the best awards I’ve ever received,” she said.</p>
      <p>“It’s huge for me to be recognised by my home State… and I’m just so happy and grateful to be one of the first nominees.”</p>
      <p>Since retiring from competition, Hunt has been a professional tennis coach for many young Australian players such as Alicia Molik and Lleyton Hewitt.</p>
      <p>She gives the same advice to all young players.</p>
      <p>“Mostly I say to them work hard and be joyful; be glad you’re doing it,” she said.</p>
