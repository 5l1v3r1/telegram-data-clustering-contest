At The Disco to win the Favorite Duo or Group—Pop/Rock. They even performers won against fellow nominees <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Billie-Eilish">Billie Eilish</a>, EXO, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Ariana-Grande">Ariana Grande</a> and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Shawn-Mendes">Shawn Mendes</a> to win Favourite Social Artist.</p>

      <p>They said, "Thank you so much. We are really honoured to receive such an important and meaningful award. BTS has been a group for six and a half years and, throughout those years, we've had so many of our dreams somehow manifest into reality and Army, you guys are the ones who make all this possible and we really couldn't have done it without your love and support from all over the world."</p>
      <p>They concluded, "We will try our best to live up to it, to strive high and work hard and return your love back to you."</p>
