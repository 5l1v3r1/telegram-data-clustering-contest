      <h1>Robert Pires says Arsenal are in 'big trouble' as pressure increases on Unai Emery</h1>
      <h2>Former Gunners midfielder Pires says Unai Emery get Arsenal back into top four or risk losing top stars like Aubameyang and Lacazette</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T05:34:51+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 05:34</time> by <a rel="author">Gareth Bicknell</a></address>
      <p>Robert Pires says Arsenal are in 'big trouble' under Unai Emery - and warned the Gunners must finish in the top four or risk losing their star players.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> legend Pires fears the likes of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Alexandre Lacazette and Mesut Ozil will be off in the summer if Emery's side don't claw their way back into the Champions League spots.</p>
      <p>The Gunners are currently eight points adrift of fourth-placed <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> , after Saturday's disappointing 2-2 draw against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/southampton-fc">Southampton</a> extended Arsenal's winless run to five games in the Premier League - and six in all competitions.</p>
      <p>The result at the Emirates could have been worse for Arsenal - who have won just four of their 13 Premier League games - as Lacazette scored a last-ditch equaliser to avoid an embarrassing defeat.</p>
      <p>Emery's job as Arsenal boss is under increasing pressure, while a fans' group has issued a strongly-worded statement <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/arsenal-fans-issue-statement-outlining-20951283">accusing the hierarchy of “rudderless” leadership</a> which has left the club “floating aimlessly".</p>

      <p>Pires backed former Emery to find a solution to Arsenal's woes - but warned the former Sevilla boss that time is running out.</p>
      <p>"Everybody knows at Arsenal, even Unai Emery, that they are in big trouble," Pires told Omnisport.</p>
      <p>"But [Emery] is a competitor, he knows the high level.</p>
      <p>"He was a great manager with Sevilla, with Paris Saint-Germain, but the situation is not so good.</p>

      <p>"He is a good manager, I think he will make a success with Arsenal. I hope for him anyway.</p>
      <p>"The situation isn’t so good, but him and the players need to find the solution."</p>
      <p>Former Gunners midfielder Pires spoke of his fears for Arsenal if they don't get back into the top four, saying: "The target for Arsenal and for Unai is to finish in the top four because it’s very important for Arsenal to play again in the Champions League next season.</p>
      <p>"I don’t know what will happen at the end of the season, especially for Arsenal.</p>
      <p>"For some players – Aubameyang, Lacazette, or even Mesut Ozil – the first thing for them and all the Arsenal players is to finish in the top four."</p>
