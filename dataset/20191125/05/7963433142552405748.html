      <h1>Amazon Brings Alexa To AWS IoT Core Devices</h1>

      <p>Amazon's annual AWS re:Invent conference in Las Vegas -- where the tech giant reliably announces a host of products heading to Amazon Web Services, its cloud platform -- doesn't kick off officially until next week. But that didn't stop the tech giant from previewing a few of the highlights, the bulk of which relate to the internet of things (IoT). From a report:<i> Why the investment in IoT? Perhaps because AWS maintains pole position in the segment, which is anticipated to be worth $212 billion by the end of 2019. Amazon CTO Werner Vogels told VentureBeat in a recent interview that AWS customers deploy upwards of hundreds of thousands of sensors. First on the list was Alexa Voice Service (AVS) Integration for AWS IoT Core, the managed cloud service that lets gadgets interact with cloud apps and other devices. It's designed to let manufacturers create Alexa built-in devices -- or accessories that connect to Alexa to play music, control smart home devices, and more -- with constrained hardware resources. Alexa built-in devices previously required at least 100MB of RAM and ARM Cortex A-class microprocessors, but thanks to new AWS cloud processing components that offload tasks like buffering and mixing audio, <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/11/25/amazon-brings-alexa-to-aws-iot-core-devices/">the baseline requirement has been reduced to 1MB of RAM and Arm Cortex M-class microcontrollers</a>. Alexa Voice Service (AVS) Integration for AWS IoT Core specifically offloads media retrieval, audio decoding, audio mixing, and state management to a new virtual Alexa-built in device in the cloud. New AWS IoT-reserved MQTT topics allow for message transfer between devices connected to AWS IoT Core and AVS using the MQTT protocol.</i></p>
