      <p>BTS found themselves winning big at the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/american-music-awards/">American Music Awards</a> on Sunday night, as they took home all three awards they were nominated for.</p>
      <p>The K-pop group, made up of V, J-Hope, RM, Jin, Jimin, Jungkook and Suga, were the second biggest winners on the night, along with Khalid, who also won three awards.</p>
      <p>They took home the gongs for Tour of the Year, Favourite Social Artist and Favourite Duo or Group Pop/Rock.</p>
      <p>Not bad boys, not bad.</p>
      <p>Of course, the BTS Army were thrilled with the boyband’s wins and Twitter was flooded with congratulatory messages cheering the group on.</p>

      <p>It will no doubt come as a nice confidence boost for the band, after they were <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/furious-bts-army-send-entire-music-catalogue-itunes-albums-chart-grammys-snub-11193399/">noticeably snubbed by the Grammys. </a></p>

      <p>The nominations for the 2020 Grammys were released last week and BTS missed out on nod, despite their success over the last year which included three number one albums in 11 months.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/bts-army-drags-disgraceful-grammys-k-pop-stars-fail-get-nominated-11189208/">It’s safe to say their fans were <i>not </i>happy with the Recording Academy</a>, with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/halsey-hits-army-bts-miss-grammy-nomination-dont-take-anger-11191287/">fellow singer Halsey commenting on the snub on Twitter</a> and stating that BTS deserved not just one, but many Grammy nominations.</p>
      <p>She too wasn’t included in the Grammys list and tweeted in support of BTS: ‘deleting and ignoring all negativity. BTS deserved many nominations. I am however, unsurprised that they weren’t acknowledged. the US is so far behind on the whole movement. the time will come.’</p>

      <p>Halsey also, not so subtly, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/25/halsey-pretty-much-threw-shade-grammys-not-nominating-amas-winners-speech-11212842/">threw shade at the Grammys during her award acceptance speech</a> at the AMAs.</p>
      <p>She picked up an award for Favourite Song Pop/Rock with her track Without Me and launched into a huge speech about how she used to think winning awards would bring her the ‘ultimate’ validation as an artist, but now she’s older she’s learnt that it’s not true.</p>
      <p>Instead she suggested it’s the approval of fans, not award bodies that validate her.</p>
      <p>Halsey said: ‘The truth is I am older now and I’m also an artist… most of these awards really aren’t what they seem at all. But that’s OK and I’m up here right now and I’m so thankful for the AMAs because they are the world’s largest fan voted award show.’</p>

      <p>Stressing her point that fans are behind who wins the AMAs, she went on: ‘I’m thankful to the fans because they are the people who really give a sh*t about music.</p>
      <p>‘And I’m thankful to the AMAs for giving those people a voice. I’m going to keep making music for them and for us.</p>
      <p>‘Sometimes you grow up and the stuff that you believed in starts to lose its magic, but the music never does because real fans, real artists and real stories keep that magic alive.’</p>
      <p>Other AMAs winners included Post Malone, Shawn Mendes and Camila Cabello and Taylor Swift who dominated on the night with six wins, including Artist of the Year and Artist of the Decade.</p>
