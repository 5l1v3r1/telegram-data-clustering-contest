        <b>Ordinary Kenyans receive special invites from Uhuru</b>
      </p>
      <p>President<a href="https://www.pulselive.co.ke/news/politics/president-uhuru-kenyatta-urges-anti-bbi-politicians-to-read-the-report-well-and-use/788t5p1"> Uhuru Kenyatta has invited 4,700 Kenyans</a> to the unveiling of the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) report at the Bomas of Kenya on November 27, 2019.</p>
      <p>The President ordered the Ministry of Interior to ensure that 100 representatives from each county would be invited and transported to the venue for the <a href="https://www.pulselive.co.ke/news/details-emerge-on-behind-the-scenes-intrigues-that-led-to-the-delay-of-the-bbi-report/fskxk78">public unveiling of the report</a>.</p>

          <b>Politics of BBI report release</b>
        </p>
        <p>Politics have also played out in the plan to unveil the report publicly as MPs allied to Deputy President William Ruto claim to have not received invitations.</p>
        <p>The invites were allegedly sent by the 47 county commissioners with one MP revealing a simple SMS sent to him by the county commissioner reading: <i>"Good afternoon ndugu, kindly attend the BBI launch at Bomas on Wednesday."</i></p>
        <p>National Assembly Minority Leader John Mbadi confirmed to have also received an invitation adding that part of the delegation will include experts who will advise the President on the way forward.</p>
