      <h1>Shania Twain Closing Out the AMAs Does Impress Us Much, Actually</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T05:44:02+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 05:44</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Murphy</a></address>
      <p>How do you end a show filled with <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/watch-lizzo-perform-jerome-on-american-music-awards.html">tiny purses</a>, <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/billy-porter-taylor-swift-react-to-camila-and-shawn-at-amas.html">jaw-dropping moments</a>, and <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/kesha-amas-2019-tik-tok-performance-video.html">girl power</a>? With Shania Twain surrounded by a harem of bare-chested, pink-lipstick-donning, hunky cowboys, that’s how! The 2019 American Music Awards ended the night with a bang by having Shania Twain return in a fluorescent pink gown to perform after a 16-year absence from the AMA stage. Shania took full advantage of the opportunity and gave a performance that truly tested the limits of what we thought she was capable of, opening her set with an acoustic cover of Post Malone’s “Rockstar” (okay!) before serving up a little smattering of Taylor Swift (<a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/taylor-swift-american-music-awards-2019-performance-video.html">it was her big night after all</a>) and ending with <a href="https://twitter.com/erikay84/status/1198818716646924288?s=20">“You’re Still the One” (a classic)</a>.</p>
      <p>While some would have called it a day after that, Shania hopped out of her precariously low stool, brought out a plethora of dancers, and delivered some of her greatest hits, including “Any Man of Mine” and <a href="https://twitter.com/ladygcga/status/1198819775599857664?s=20">“Man! I Feel Like A Woman.</a>” Everything was pink. Everything was cheetah print. It was signature Shania <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=shania+twain+top+hat&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS713US715&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiByuW50ITmAhXhpVkKHU7LBrgQ_AUoAXoECA8QAw&amp;biw=1420&amp;bih=727#imgrc=K6UVvhhT843UxM:">right down to the invocation of top hats</a>. At many points, it felt more like a <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/03/bill-haders-snl-stefon-return-was-as-perfect-as-expected.html">Stefon fever dream</a> than an awards-show performance. And, most importantly, <a href="https://twitter.com/RosesTearsDrama/status/1198821156222099456?s=20">everyone loved it</a> so much that <a href="https://twitter.com/bbrianthelion/status/1198819678417637376">Shania &amp; Co. kept the party going well after the credits stopped rolling</a>. We’re still not exactly sure what it is, but whatever <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/04/shania-twain-apologizes-for-saying-shed-have-voted-trump.html">Shania 2.0</a> has is <i>precisely</i> the type of chaotic energy that we need to usher us into 2020.</p>
