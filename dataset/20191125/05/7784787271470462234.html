      <h3>The international break is over and domestic football resumed meaning our Aussies returned to action for their clubs.</h3>
      <p>Former Socceroos boss Ange Postecoglou is on the verge of becoming the first Australian coach to win a J-League title.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, Australian duo Aaron Mooy and Mat Ryan weren’t able to help Brighton and Hove Albion see off Premier League surprise package Leicester City.</p>

      <p><b>Ange Postecoglou</b> is on the verge of becoming the first Australian coach to win the J-League title after steering his Yokohama F. Marinos team to the top of the standings with two games remaining.</p>
      <p>Former Socceroos coach Postecoglou guided Yokohama to the summit with a 1-0 win at Matsumoto Yamuga on Saturday.</p>
      <p>That result and FC Tokyo’s surprise 1-1 draw with lowly Shonan Bellmare saw the top two change positions.</p>
      <p>Yokohama are on 64 points with Tokyo on 63. Kashima Antlers, the only other team in title contention, are on 60.</p>
      <p>Postecoglou’s man could clinch the title as soon as next weekend if they beat fourth-placed Kawasaki Frontale away and Tokyo lose to 13th-placed Urawa Red Diamonds.</p>
      <p>However, it is more likely it will come down to a final round home showdown with Tokyo on December 7.</p>
      <p>Postecoglou’s side are unbeaten in the league since August 17, a span of nine games.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere in the J-League, shot stopper <b>Mitchell Langerak </b>played 90 minutes in Nagoya Grampus’s 0-0 draw with Sagan Tosu.</p>

      <p>In the Premier League, Socceroos duo <b>Aaron Mooy </b>and <b>Mat Ryan </b>were in action for Brighton and Hove Albion in their 2-0 loss to high-flying Leicester City.</p>
      <p>Ryan made countless world class saves in-between the sticks to keep the Seagulls in the game but it wasn’t enough to stop Jamie Vardy and co in the end.</p>
