      <p>Lawmaker Starry Lee Wai-king was one of the few pro-establishment candidates who survived the brutal onslaught of the pan-democrats in Sunday’s district council elections.</p>
      <p>Lee, chairwoman of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong (DAB), the largest political party in the Legislative Council, was re-elected to her seat in the To Kwa Wan North constituency of the Kowloon City District Council, beating her opponent, disqualified lawmaker “Long Hair” Leung Kwok-hung of the League of Social Democrats, the Hong Kong Economic Journal reports.</p>
      <p>Lee, however, did not win big as huge a margin as she had in the last DC election in 2015, when she garnered as many as eight in 10 votes.</p>
      <p>In Sunday’s election, she obtained 1,881 votes as against Leung’s 1,538 votes.</p>
      <p>Overall, the DAB won only 21 seats, out of the 181 candidates it fielded in the DC race.</p>
      <p>Leading figures of the DAB bowed in apology during a press conference on Monday, admitting that the party has failed in the elections.</p>
      <p>Lee said she has offered to resign as DAB leader but the party’s central committee rejected her offer as the drabbing in the election was the party’s collective failure.</p>
      <p>While apologizing to the DAB supporters, Lee thanked the party’s supporters and hoped that they won’t be discouraged.</p>
      <p>Lee noted that violent incidents during the past few months had affected the party’s campaigning efforts.</p>
      <p>At the same time, she said the party will review its election strategies and work even harder to regain the people’s support.</p>
      <p>On Sunday afternoon, Lee’s press conference was disrupted by Leung, her opponent, who showed up at the event.</p>
      <p>Leung slammed her for opposing all forms of violence except that of the police and demanded that she apologize to the public.</p>
      <p>In response, Lee bewailed Leung’s disruptive acts and called on voters to support DAB candidates to stop violence in society.</p>
      <p>As she was leaving, Leung and his supporters blocked Lee’s car and challenged her to an open debate, which she refused.</p>
      <p>Horace Cheung Kwok-kwan, DAB’s vice chairman, was not so lucky.</p>
      <p>During the campaign, he was backed by DAB founding chairman and former Legislative Council president Jasper Tsang Yok-sing as well as Executive Council member Ip Kwok-him.</p>
      <p>But Cheung still lost in the Sai Wan constituency of the Central and Western district to pro-democracy candidate Jordan Pang Ka-ho, who obtained 3,289 votes against his 2,494.</p>
