      <p><b>Are you a saver or a spender?</b><br/>I am a saver. My mother was a great saver; she bought our clothes in the sales so she could put good food on the table for her family. When I was a child, I saved any money I earned until I had enough for a bar of chocolate or a ’99 ice cream. You had to save before you could spend. I suppose it has always been important to me to be independent when it came to money.</p>
      <p><b>Do you shop around for better value?</b><br/>Yes, it is in my nature – I am not frugal, as it is hard earned. I was reared in the 1950s and 1960s when there was very little money around. Still now, in the business, I want to stock beautiful functional items, but they must also represent value.</p>
      <p><b>What has been your most extravagant purchase and how much did it cost?</b><br/>Years ago, I bought a hot tub for the back garden, for €8,000, which was extravagant for me. I had visions of us sipping champagne under the bright stars. That vision didn’t last, as the tub took time and effort to prepare for use and to clean, and I didn’t like the smell of chlorine in the water. I sold it a few years later for €3,000. Lesson learned.</p>
      <p><b>What purchase have you made that you consider the best value for money?</b><br/>Twenty years ago, we bought a place in Estepona in Spain. It has given us years of pleasure and lovely family memories, and still does.</p>
      <p><b>How do you prefer to shop – online or local?</b><br/>I mostly shop local, except when it comes to buying flights. I also buy books online from an Irish company. I generally like to see and feel what I am buying, especially when it comes to clothes, to get a good fit. Above all I want to support local shops, to ensure enterprise in communities is rewarded, and that we continue to have excellent local retail and service provision.</p>
      <p><b>Do you haggle over prices?</b><br/>Absolutely. My father taught me to be a wheeler-dealer early on. When making a big purchase in a store, I always ask for discount and, more often than not, I get it. When I am abroad too, I haggle. I get a great kick out of getting a discount, although family are sometimes embarrassed.</p>
      <p><b>Has the recession changed your spending habits?</b><br/>Yes, I have become more cautious when spending money. I wonder what will be around the corner for us now, too, especially with Brexit on the horizon. I still treat myself to things that I value and enjoy, though, because I have worked hard over the years and earned my little luxuries.</p>
      <p><b>Do you invest in shares?</b><br/>Not directly. Over the years, my pension has been invested in shares and that has served me well.</p>
      <p><b>Cash or card?</b><br/>I use my credit card most of the time, for safety and convenience, but I still like to have some cash in my wallet, just in case.</p>
      <p><b>What was the last thing you bought and was it good value for money?</b><br/>This year I bought a Toyota Prius hybrid car that I plug in every evening. Mainly, I travel to work so I only spend about €20 a month on fuel. That is good value for me and presumably good for the environment, too. And yes, I haggled, and got a great deal at my local garage.</p>
      <p><b>Have you ever successfully saved up for a relatively big purchase?</b><br/>In my younger days, I saved when we were buying our house and furnishings for it. My salary was very small then.</p>
      <p><b>Have you ever lost money?</b><br/>We had some property investments during the Celtic Tiger days that did not work out. Now I stick to what I know best, which is consumer retail, food and design, and working with incredible Irish designers and makers.</p>
      <p><b>Are you a gambler and, if so, have you ever had a big win?</b><br/>No, I am not. People’s lives can be destroyed through gambling.</p>
      <p><b>Is money important to you?</b><br/>Money is not the be all and end all of everything; it does not bring happiness. I see money as providing a comfortable living for me and my family, but money was never given to me. I worked hard for it from a very young age.</p>
      <p><b>How much money do you have on you now?</b><br/>I have €120 in my wallet right now, and my credit card.</p>
