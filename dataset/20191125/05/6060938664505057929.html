      <p>It was reported earlier by Bombay Times that <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Bollywood">Bollywood</a> hottie <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Evelyn-Sharma">Evelyn Sharma</a>, who got recently engaged to Australian dental surgeon and entrepreneur, Dr. Tushaan Bhindi is all set to buy a new house in Mumbai. Today, the actress took to her social media handle to share this pleasant news with her fans.</p>
      <p>Evelyn Sharma posted a few pictures of her new dream house in Mumbai and thanked her decade long Bollywood career to help her fulfill this dream of having a new house that too in a city like Mumbai. She captioned the post as, "I have cut a lot of ribbons in my life... but none has ever been as special as the one to my own home! ❤️ Thank you, to my 10 years in #Bollywood and this incredible journey that enabled me to fulfill this life long dream to buy a beautiful flat, and that too in Mumbai! 💯💃🏻🎉🍾🥳 #trulyblessed #godisgood #trustthejourney #mondaymotivation #evelynsharma."</p>
      <p>The actress has bought her dream house in Andheri, D.N.Nagar area. Speaking exclusive to BombayTimes, the actress had said, “I had bought the house last year before I met Tushaan, but it took almost a year to complete the paperwork and get other things in place. After we met, I decided that it would be good to have one base in Mumbai. After marriage, we will be based in Mumbai and Sydney. We have a home here, where his family resides, but this is going to be our own space.” One of the reasons Evelyn chose this apartment was the view that it offers. “It’s on the 13th floor, so it has a fantastic view; you can see almost the whole of Juhu from the balcony. Tushaan also likes his space when he works. The place is going to look beautiful. I am looking forward to the monsoon when we will be able to see the rains from the balcony while enjoying a cup of chai."</p>
      <p>Evelyn Sharma is an avid social media user and she makes sure to update her fans with her day to day posts.</p>
