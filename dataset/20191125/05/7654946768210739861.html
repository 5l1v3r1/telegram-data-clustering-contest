      <h1>Braxton Berrios picked right time for his Jets breakout</h1>

      <p>Coming into Sunday’s game against the Raiders, the Jets’ Braxton Berrios had just 30 yards receiving to his name.</p>
      <p>Not just 30 yards this season, but 30 yards throughout his injury-riddled career that began with the Patriots last season before the Jets claimed him off waivers in early September. But the 24-year-old receiver tripled that production on one play — and added an impressive punt return — <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/24/jets-completely-dominate-raiders-for-third-straight-win/">in the Jets’ 34-3 rout of the Raiders.</a></p>
      <p>After barely appearing on the stat sheet in a quiet start to the season, Berrios came alive.</p>
      <p>“It was huge,” Berrios said. “Obviously, football is a game of opportunities. And when they come your way, you try to make the most of them. It honestly felt good to be able to do something on the offensive side of the ball today.”</p>
      <p>The Jets scored on their first three drives to take a 13-3 lead. And Berrios got to work just before halftime, single-handedly giving the Jets an opportunity to add to the score with an electric 26-yard punt return. An unnecessary roughness penalty on punter A.J. Cole brought the Jets to Oakland’s 25, but Sam Ficken missed a 48-yard field goal.</p>
      <p>On the third play of the third quarter, Sam Darnold connected with Berrios right at the first-down mark before the Miami product tapped into another gear for a 69-yard gain to put the Jets at Oakland’s 1-yard line.</p>

      <p>The big plays atoned for an early gaffe when he failed to field a punt, which the Raiders downed at the 4-yard line.</p>
      <p>“That’s that kid,” coach Adam Gase said. “If he makes a mistake, he’s able to put it behind him, move on to the next thing. That’s kind of part of football. It happens. All of us make mistakes. It’s whether or not we can move on to the next part of the game.”</p>
      <p>Darnold lobbed a pass to tight end Ryan Griffin for the touchdown and Ficken converted the extra point to give the Jets a 20-3 and the rout was on.</p>
      <p>Berrios, whom the Patriots selected with the 210th pick in the 2018 NFL Draft, is still finding his footing in the NFL after an undisclosed injury sidelined him for his rookie season. He’s primarily been a punt returner since joining the Jets, collecting 125 yards on 14 returns.</p>
      <p>“We’re clicking right now,” Berrios said. “I think it’s a culmination of things, but the main thing is we’ve been very cohesive as a group. We haven’t listened to much outside of our building and I think everything is starting to really head in the right direction right now.”</p>
