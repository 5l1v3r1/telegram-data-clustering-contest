      <h1>Ding to offer Netflix payment services as it staffs up for major growth</h1>
      <h2>Global mobile phone top-up platform preparing to add 100 new staff by 2021</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T05:01:13+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 05:01</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishtimes.com/profile/mark-paul-7.2443308" target="_blank">Mark Paul</a></address>
      <p>Ding, the global mobile phone top-up platform founded by Irish entrepreneur <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Mark+Roden">Mark Roden</a>, has beefed up its management team including hiring a top human resources executive from <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Facebook">Facebook</a>, as it prepares to add 100 new staff by 2021.</p>
      <p>Ding’s platform, which lets users around the world transfer mobile phone credit to each other, has also struck a partnership to allow its users buy each other <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Netflix">Netflix</a> subscriptions, which will be launched “within weeks”.</p>
      <p>Mr Roden said it will also launch a service to pay utility bills on the platform next year.</p>
      <p>Accounts provided to The Irish Times for <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Ezetop">Ezetop</a>, the unlimited company that owns Ding, also show a 9 per cent increase in overall turnover last year to $424 million (€385 million), although this includes top-up transaction values.</p>
      <p>Net revenue, the slice of turnover used by Ding as a sales yardstick, rose 10 per cent to $38.3 million. The Dublin-headquartered group, which generates its sales in global emigration hotspots such as the Gulf, files its accounts in dollars.</p>
      <p>Its ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) in 2018 was close to $8 million.</p>

      <p>The financial statements also show that shareholders, led by Mr Roden and his wife <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Nicola+Roden">Nicola Roden</a> (who are majority owners), took a $13.5 million dividend in 2017. There was no corresponding dividend payment for 2018.</p>
      <p>Ding was founded in 2006 by Mr Roden, a former EY Entrepreneur of the Year who also helped Denis O’Brien to found <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Esat+Telecom">Esat Telecom</a>. The company’s services are used by immigrants globally to send small amounts of mobile phone credit to relatives back home as a form of cross-border remittance.</p>
      <p>“For a large part of our time, we have been devoted to growing a single service,” said Mr Roden, who added that 300,000 customers use the platform each month.</p>
      <p>“We thought: ‘What other services can we give our users?’ What if a worker in Dubai could use the platform to pay his mother’s electricity bill back home in India? What if he could buy his family a Netflix subscription?”</p>
      <h3>Growth spurt</h3>
      <p>The company, which employs about 220 staff and has offices in nine locations abroad, is gearing up for a major growth spurt in the next two to three years, Mr Roden said.</p>
      <p>The company has just hired <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Fiona+Mullan">Fiona Mullan</a> from Facebook, where she was vice-president of international human resources. At Ding, she will assume the role of chief people officer.</p>
      <p>Ding has also recently hired a new chief technology officer from HubSpot, Barbara McCarthy, and a new chief commercial officer, <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Rupert+Shaw">Rupert Shaw</a>, who joined from DocoMo Digital.</p>
      <p>Mr Roden, who returned to the business in 2018 after a year off, said he had had an “opportunity to look at it from the outside” and he realised he had to overhaul its management structure to drive growth.</p>
      <p>“So we went out and hired people who have grown huge services and large companies before,” he said.</p>
