        <b>Moon Alert</b>
      </p>
      <p>After noon EST today (9 AM PST) avoid shopping or important decisions. The Moon is in Scorpio.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Aries (March 21-April 19)</b>
      </p>
      <p>This is a good day to make plans for future travel or getting further education or training in a discipline that is important to you. However, (important) please check the Moon Alert and make sure you don’t commit to anything during this window of time! Wait until tomorrow.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Taurus (April 20-May 20)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Tomorrow’s New Moon is your chance to think how to reduce your debt and better handle shared property, inheritances, wills and insurance issues. Start today to do your homework; however, commit to your plans tomorrow. (See Moon Alert.)</p>
      <p>
        <b>Gemini (May 21-June 20)</b>
      </p>
      <p>The only New Moon opposite your sign all year will occur tomorrow, which means that today you will start to see ways to improve your closest relationships. However, because today is a Moon Alert, just think about these things. However, make your firm resolve tomorrow.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Cancer (June 21-July 22)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Today you see ways to improve your health as well as improve your job or how you do your job. (Even small ideas will be helpful.) Nevertheless, today is a Moon Alert, think about what you can do – but make your resolutions tomorrow during the New Moon.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Leo (July 23-Aug. 22)</b>
      </p>
      <p>This is a wonderful, creative day! It’s easy to envision imaginative ideas because you’re thinking outside of the box. It’s also a great day to schmooze with others and socialize. Enjoy sports events and fun activities with kids. (Check Moon Alert.)</p>
      <p>
        <b>Virgo (Aug. 23-Sept. 22)</b>
      </p>
      <p>It’s Monday, and you might not feel like going to work because the idea of cocooning at home among familiar surroundings really appeals. (It’s a thumb-sucking day.) Pamper yourself if you can. In any event, be aware of the restrictions of the Moon Alert. (See above.)</p>
      <p>
        <b>Libra (Sept. 23-Oct. 22)</b>
      </p>
      <p>The pending New Moon will trigger new ideas, new possibilities and new ways of doing things. You might meet new people and see new places. Wow! Nevertheless, because today is a Moon Alert day, agree to nothing important until tomorrow during a New Moon day!</p>
      <p>
        <b>Scorpio (Oct. 23-Nov. 21)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Be careful today because there is much activity in your Money House. Therefore, write down your ideas about how to boost your earnings or get a better job. However, do not act on them until tomorrow when the Moon Alert is over. Ka-ching!</p>
      <p>
        <b>Sagittarius (Nov. 22-Dec. 21)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Today the Sun and the pending New Moon are in your sign, which means this is an excellent day to make plans for your future. In particular, take a realistic look in the mirror and ask yourself how you can improve your image. But wait until tomorrow to act on your ideas.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Capricorn (Dec. 22-Jan. 19)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Today you feel vague because tomorrow’s New Moon is in a hidden part of your chart. You might be eager to begin things and in the next moment, you change your mind or feel indecisive. Don’t worry. This is a fleeting thing. Tomorrow it will be all systems go.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Aquarius (Jan. 20-Feb. 18)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Tomorrow’s New Moon might provoke you to think about your friends. (Friendships are important to you.) Never hang out with people who do not have your best interests at heart. Why would you? Life is too short for that. Think about future goals but wait until tomorrow to commit.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Pisces (Feb. 19-March 20)</b>
      </p>
      <p>This is a good day to think about your life direction in general; however, because most of this day is a Moon Alert, wait until tomorrow before you actually commit to an important decision or a goal. Meanwhile, you are high viz. today – people notice you.</p>
      <p>
        <b>If Your Birthday Is Today</b>
      </p>
      <p>Actor Joel Kinnaman (1979) shares your birthday today. You are honest with a visionary outlook on life. You are philosophical and artistically sensitive. Yay! A fun-loving year ahead! Expect to be popular and enjoy warm friendships. This year you will be more grateful for your life and will appreciate the happiness and beauty around you in a daily way. It might be time for an important choice. Choose wisely.</p>
