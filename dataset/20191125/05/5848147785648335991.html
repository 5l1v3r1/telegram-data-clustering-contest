      <p>More than a century ago, on November 25, 1915, scientist Albert Einstein presented his world-changing general theory of relativity for the first time.</p>
      <p>Many great thinkers throughout history have tried to explain gravity, but none have come closer than Mr Einstein.</p>
      <p>The German-born physicist’s geometric theory of gravitation was so impressive that it is still used to describe gravitation in modern physics today.</p>

      <p>His theory of general relativity was important because it implied the existence of black holes – regions of space that have such a strong gravitational pull that anything that gets too close to one will be sucked in, never to be seen again.</p>
      <p>In his presentation, Mr Einstein predicted that massive stars no longer able to sustain their own weight could collapse and deform spacetime to form a black hole.</p>
      <p>His theory also predicted the existence of gravitational waves, which are ‘ripples’ in spacetime caused by violent and energetic processes in the Universe.</p>
      <p>It also explained how the path of light will follow the curvature of spacetime as it passes near a star.</p>
      <p>Mr Einstein shot to international fame in 1919 when a British scientist tested his general theory of relativity by observing a solar eclipse and found it to be correct.</p>
