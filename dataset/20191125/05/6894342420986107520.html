      <h1>unifi TV Plus Box Appears Online: Runs On Android TV, Supports 4K UHD and HDR</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T05:31:12+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 05:31</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.lowyat.net/author/chapree/" target="_blank">Chief Chapree</a></address>
      <p>Aside from some promo here and there, things were awfully quiet for unifi TV especially since TM stops offering unifi TV set-top box as a standard for unifi customers. As it turns out, maybe it is because TM is working behind the scene to refresh its unifi TV offerings.</p>
      <p>Based on several pictures that have made their way online, TM is apparently working to roll out a new set-top box for unifi TV called <b>unifi Plus Box</b>. Equipped with 2GB of RAM and 8GB internal storage, the new box apparently supports 4K UHD and HDR content which is rather interesting given that Astro Ultra 4K UHD box has just made its way into the market.</p>

      <p>Not only that, the new unifi Plus Box is apparently running on Android TV as well. The above presentation slide also claimed that the box will come pre-installed with apps from unifi’s OTT partners such as BBC, dimsum, and YuppTV although there’s also a mention of iflix which seems rather out of place for now.</p>
      <p>From a quick search online, the new box <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v4/cpu/14864302">has appeared on Geekbench</a> and is <a href="https://www.androidtv-guide.com/pay-tv-provider/asia-pacific">apparently manufactured by Skyworth Digital</a> which is another interesting point since the previous unifi TV boxes came from Huawei. The new box will apparently be offered to unifi 300Mbps customers starting from today onwards, before being made available to unifi TV Ultimate Pack subscribers.</p>

      <p>We have reached out to TM for a comment on this matter, but the company replied that it has nothing to announce today. With that, maybe we have to wait a little while to know how real is this unifi Plus Box or otherwise.</p>
