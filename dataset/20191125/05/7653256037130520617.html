      <p>Bengaluru: As chief minister BS Yediyurappa leads the BJP from the front taking a full-fledged plunge into campaigning in all the 15 Assembly seats that are facing bypolls on December 5, it is turning out to be a do-or-die battle for <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Congress">Congress</a> leader <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Siddaramaiah">Siddaramaiah</a> and JD(S) leader HD <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Kumaraswamy">Kumaraswamy</a>.</p>
      <p>A lot depends on the outcome of the byelection for the Congress and the JD(S). Siddaramaiah, who is also the leader of the Opposition, is performing largely a one-man show, fielding barbs from both BJP and JD(S), and silently suffering the non-cooperation from senior leaders in the party.</p>
      <p>Disqualified lawmaker Ramesh Jarkiholi, who is contesting from Gokak in Belagavi district on a BJP ticket, sent a mild shockwave in the Congress on Saturday by announcing that about 35 Congress legislators are in touch with him and he is capable of emptying the Congress legislature party in Karnataka. His remarks have acquired some seriousness because it is he who played a big role in the fall of the JD (S)-Congress reign by engineering a switchover of sections of Congress lawmakers into the BJP fold. He is a new convert into the BJP and hence, is suspected to be still nurturing some relationships in his old party.</p>
      <p>Sections of Congress MLAs may start exploring opportunities in the BJP at a later stage if the Congress were to do poorly. If the BJP were to win below seven seats — the number it requires to retain majority in the Assembly — then some more Congress MLAs may offer to quit in a repeat of the July drama. This prospect is a bit worrisome for the Congress, sources say.</p>
      <p>The resistance Siddaramaiah is facing from within the Congress is well-known. Sections of senior leaders are upset that he had his way in deciding party candidates in all constituencies. They fear if the Congress were to put up a good show, his clout will increase further, and hence, are making a symbolic appearance. The former CM is said to have already brought this to the notice of AICC general secretary KC Venugopal. For quite a few Congress leaders, a setback for Siddaramaiah has become more important than keeping the BJP under check.</p>
      <p>The JD(S), on the other hand, is a boiling cauldron, ready to implode anytime. In Mysuru, senior leader GT Deve Gowda is staying neutral, while it has become Kumaraswamy’s responsibility to win seats in traditional JD(S) backyards. He is training his energy on KR Pet in Mandya district and Yeshwanthpur in Bengaluru, hoping to win these two seats. The party has already backed Sharath Bache Gowda, the BJP rebel in Hoskote.</p>
      <p>In last year’s Assembly polls, JD (S) won all seven seats in Mandya district, but quite a few MLAs stayed away when the party candidate Devaraj filed his nomination at KR Pet.</p>
      <p>The former CM knows if the BJP walks away with the KR Pet seat, his party will invite trouble for sure. That can only weaken the JD(S) base in Mandya district in the weeks to come.</p>
