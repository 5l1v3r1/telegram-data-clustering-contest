      <h2>Karimpur candidate Joy Prakash Majumdar was allegedly attacked by a group of Trinamool Congress supporters</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T05:01:44+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 05:01</time> by <a rel="author">Special Correspondent</a></address>
      <p>West Bengal Bharatiya Janata Party vice-president and candidate from Karimpur Assembly segment Joy Prakash Majumdar was assaulted on November 25 during the bypolls for three Assembly segments Kharagpur Sadar, Karimpur and Kaliaganj.</p>
      <p>Mr. Majumdar who was going around the constituency was assaulted allegedly by a group of Trinamool Congress supporters. Video footage aired by local television channels showed that Mr. Majumdar was pushed and kicked before he fell down. Earlier in the day, Mr. Majumdar faced protest by the Trinamool Congress supporters while visiting different areas in the constituency.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, about 13.81% votes were polled in the three Assembly segments till 9 a.m. on Monday .</p>
      <p>While Kharagpur Sadar located in south Bengal’s Paschim Medinipur recorded 12.60% votes, it was 14.13 % at Kaliaganj in Uttar Dinajpur district and 14.71% in Karimpur in Nadia district</p>
      <p>At Kaliaganj, BJP candidate Kamal Chandra Sarkar was seen in the voting box helping his wife cast her vote. The presiding officer of the polling booth was removed after the incident. The ruling Trinamool Congress has raised questions on the presence of BJP MP and State president Dilip Ghosh in Kharagpur on the eve of the polls.</p>
      <p>There has been considerable deployment of Central armed security forces in the three seats. At Karimpur, 90% of the 261 polling stations will be manned by Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF) as opposed to 70% and 43% in Kharagpur Sadar and Kaliaganj respectively.</p>
      <p>The bypolls, first after the Lok Sabha poll, are crucial for different reasons, including the formal tie-up between the Left Front and the Congress, who have come together after the 2016 Assembly poll. Also, these are the first elections following the Ayodhya verdict and Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s announcement of a countrywide National Register of Citizens.</p>
      <p>The polls at Kharagpur Sadar and Karimganj were necessitated after the MLAs from the respective seats won the 2019 Lok Sabha poll. Dilip Ghosh, MLA from Kharagpur Sadar of the BJP, was elected from Medinipur Lok Sabha seat and Mahua Moitra MLA from Karimpur won the Krishnanagar seat in the Nadia district. The bypoll in Kaliaganj was necessitated after the death of Congress MLA Pramath Nath Roy in May 2019.</p>
