      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 25): theedgemarkets.com highlighted eight stocks with momentum at Bursa Malaysia’s afternoon close today. One stock displayed positive momentum while seven showed negative momentum.</p>
      <p>The stock with positive momentum was:</p>
      <p>Cepatwawasan GroupBhd — up 2 sen at 62 sen</p>
      <p>Stocks with negative momentum were:</p>
      <p>Inch Kenneth Kajang Rubber Public Ltd Co — up 1.5 sen at 61.5 sen</p>
      <p>MHC Plantations Bhd — up 3 sen at 63 sen</p>
      <p>Ornapaper Bhd — up 7 sen at RM1.09</p>
      <p>Rimbunan Sawit Bhd — up 1.5 sen at 21 sen</p>
      <p>Eco World International Bhd — up 11 sen at 93.5 sen</p>

      <p>The list of stocks with momentum is generated using a proprietary mathematical algorithm highlighting stocks with a build-up in trading volume and price. The algorithm differentiates between stocks that exhibit positive (+ve) momentum and negative (-ve) momentum.</p>
      <p>This list is not a buy or sell recommendations. It merely tells you which stocks are seeing higher than normal volume and price movements.</p>
      <p>The share price may move up or down from this point. But the “+ve” (suggesting a rising price trend on volume) and “-ve” (suggesting a falling price trend on volume) indicators should give readers a better idea of what the market is buying and when to sell. Note also that momentum generally persists for a short period of time.</p>
      <p>However, each stock has an accompanying fundamental score and valuation score to help readers evaluate the attractiveness of the stocks, if they want to ride the momentum.</p>
