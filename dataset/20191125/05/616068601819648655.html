      <p>Over 2800 pages of signatures against the non-abstinence-based housing facility under construction at 130 McCurdy Road were handed to Liberal MLA Norm Letnick by a group of Rutland residents on Sunday morning. </p>
      <p>A total of 14,547 individuals signed the petition over the course of 16 days, including more than 13,000 Kelowna residents. </p>
      <p>"This took hundreds of volunteer hours to pull together and get done, many volunteers, and thousands of people standing up for kids and seniors, signing their names, so that OUR government might change course and stop placing our children and seniors at risk... if we don’t stand up for our kids/seniors, who will?" said organizer Audra Boudreau in a Facebook post. </p>
      <p>The petition will be presented by Letnick to the BC Legislature on Monday, Nov. 25 following the question period. </p>
      <p>Boudreau, who started the petition this summer, hopes it will encourage the B.C. government to change the designation of the McCurdy facility which is in close proximity to children, youth and seniors. </p>
      <p>"It is my sincere hope that the BC government changes their course, at least for the facilities here in Rutland. And that I have done right by you all with what I have tried to accomplish here for Rutland. </p>
      <p>"It would be so easy for BC to instead create rehab spaces, or low income seniors/students housing. Or, if they want to continue down this road to nowhere that shreds billions of taxpayer dollars each year, at least have the decency to place these facilities nowhere near other large vulnerable populations and family-oriented neighbourhoods that will be harmed in the process. I hope they hear us."</p>
      <p>The 49-unit housing facility is currently under construction and expected to open in spring 2021. </p>
