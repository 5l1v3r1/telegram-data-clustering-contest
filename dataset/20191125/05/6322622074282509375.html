      <p>Dr Mahathir last visit to South Korea as a prime minister was in 2002.</p>
      <p>"I have always been interested in fighter planes and indigenous planes. I want to see how it perform and advancement of your aircraft industry," he told KAI's CEO Ahn Hyun-ho, who received him at the facility earlier.</p>
      <p>A qualified pilot and an avid follower of aero technology, the Prime Minister arrived at the aerospace and defence facility by helicopter around 10.30am local time.</p>
      <p>Sacheon is located about 100km from Busan, the host city of ASEAN-South Korea Commemorative Summit 2019, which Dr Mahathir is scheduled to attend.</p>

      <p>Malaysia is currently considering its option on LCA and is expected to formally launch a procurement effort to enable the air force to keep up with advanced technology and capability.</p>
      <p>According to defence publication, Jane's Defence Weekly, the Royal Malaysian Air Force's (RMAF) plans to procure up to 36 LCAs with an option for 26 more to complement its current batch of Hawks, Sukhoi SU-30MKM and FA-18D Hornets fighter jets.</p>
