      <p>On the October 11 edition of SmackDown Live, <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/bayley">Bayley</a> debuted a new look and destroyed the Bayley Buddies while coming out for her SmackDown Live Women's title match against Charlotte Flair, signifying a turn to the dark side. The latest edition of "<a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/wwe">WWE</a>Day Of" takes a look at Bayley's heel turn, and shows Vince McMahon's reaction to the same.</p>
      <p>The September 2, 2019 episode of RAW saw Bayley joining forces with Sasha Banks and attacking RAW Women's Champion Becky Lynch. Around a month later, Bayley met Charlotte Flair in a match on SmackDown Live, with Flair's title on the line.</p>
      <p>Bayley shed her old persona on this night, and came out donning a completely new look. She eventually won the match, and berated the WWE Universe to complete her heel turn.</p>
