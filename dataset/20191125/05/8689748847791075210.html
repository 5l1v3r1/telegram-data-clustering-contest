      <p>A new photo of Fantana’s relatively young mother has surfaced online again and people can’t stop admiring her.</p>
      <p>Her mother’s name is Madam Dorcas Affo-Toffey aka Nzema Yaa Asantewaa.</p>
      <p>Recently the singer and her mother stole the show at the 2019 4Syte Music Video Awards which went down live at the Kempinski Hotel in Accra on Saturday evening.</p>
      <p>For once, you might doubt if the woman is truly Fantana’s mum because of her young age. What’s more, her gargantuan assets do not look like one who has given birth before.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.ghbase.com/fantana-flaunts-her-gorgeous-mother-at-the-2019-mtn-4syte-music-video-awards-watch/">The singer was full of smiles as she took her mum by the hand </a>and strolled with her as they headed towards the part of the auditorium which is strictly demarcated for artists.</p>
