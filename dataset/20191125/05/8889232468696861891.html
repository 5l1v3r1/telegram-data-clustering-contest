      <h1>New discovery in C. difficile biology could lead to treatments for dangerous infections</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T05:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 05:00</time> by <a rel="author">The Mount Sinai Hospital / Mount Sinai School of Medicine</a></address>
      <p>New York, NY -- Nov 25, 2019 -- A process called sporulation that helps the dangerous bacterium <i>Clostridium difficile</i> (<i>C. difficile</i>) to survive inhospitable conditions and spread is regulated by epigenetics, factors that affect gene expression beyond the DNA genetic code, researchers at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai report. This is the first discovery that epigenetics regulate sporulation in any bacteria. Their research, published November 25th in <i>Nature Microbiology</i>, opens a new window to developing treatments for this devestating infection.</p>
      <p><i>C. difficile</i> infects nearly half a million people each year, causing severe diarrhea and killing just under 10 percent of those over 65 who contract it. Spores of the bacteria, which are spread through feces, are extremely resilient and can survive outside the body for weeks or months, infecting individuals who come in contact with contaminated surfaces.</p>
      <p>Since the infection is so common and devastating, the <i>C. difficile</i> genome has been well studied, but Gang Fang, PhD, Associate Professor of Genetics and Genomic Sciences at Mount Sinai's Icahn Institute for Data Science and Genomic Technology and senior author of the study, says he and his colleagues took a different approach in their research. "We wanted to study beyond the genetic code of the bacteria and look at what chemical modifications were being made to the genome," said Dr. Fang. While these epigenetic chemical modifications, called methylation, do not alter the sequence of a gene, they can modify a particular gene's activity to render it more or less active, which has profound impacts on the organism's function.</p>
      <p>Dr. Fang's team pioneered the use of third-generation DNA sequencing to map epigenetic factors in bacteria in 2012 and began studying <i>C. difficile</i> epigenetics in 2015. First, the team isolated <i>C. difficile</i> from fecal samples of 36 patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) at Mount Sinai Hospital who had been infected with it. They analyzed the samples and found one particular epigenetic pattern that was highly conserved throughout all the samples. Next, they checked about 300 <i>C. difficile</i> genomes from <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/">GenBank</a>, a databank of genetic sequences run by the National Institutes of Health, and found that all shared the same gene responsible for the epigenetic pattern found in the ICU patients.</p>
      <p>Suspecting this epigenetic pattern was playing a crucial role in the function of the bacteria, Dr. Fang's team collaborated on two further studies of <i>C. difficile</i> sporulation and mice infected with <i>C. difficile</i>, with the lab of Aimee Shen, PhD, Associate Professor of Molecular Biology &amp; Microbiology at Tufts University Medical School and a co-senior author of the study, and with the lab of Rita Tamayo, PhD, Associate Professor of Microbiology and Immunology at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. In one study with mice, the researchers found that when they inhibited the gene responsible for the epigenetic pattern, as much as 100 times less bacteria was present after 6 days compared to unaltered bacteria.</p>
      <p>Dr. Fang says the findings in these studies underscore the significance of epigenetics in the study of bacteria and drug development for infection.</p>
      <p>In addition to offering new epigenetic insights into the study of <i>C. difficile</i> and possible targets for drug development, Dr. Fang hopes this research will encourage further studies of the epigenetic characteristics of bacteria. "This is just the beginning of our understanding of epigenetic regulation in bacteria; there are still so many questions yet to be answered," said Dr. Fang. "We hope this exciting discovery will encourage further interdisciplinary collaborations to investigate epigenetics of bacteria and how we can use these new insights to develop life-saving treatments for infection."</p>

      </p>
      <p>The Mount Sinai Health System is New York City's largest integrated delivery system, encompassing eight hospitals, a leading medical school, and a vast network of ambulatory practices throughout the greater New York region. Mount Sinai's vision is to produce the safest care, the highest quality, the highest satisfaction, the best access and the best value of any health system in the nation. The Health System includes approximately 7,480 primary and specialty care physicians; 11 joint-venture ambulatory surgery centers; more than 410 ambulatory practices throughout the five boroughs of New York City, Westchester, Long Island, and Florida; and 31 affiliated community health centers. The Icahn School of Medicine is one of three medical schools that have earned distinction by multiple indicators: ranked in the top 20 by U.S. News &amp; World Report's "Best Medical Schools", aligned with a U.S. News &amp; World Report's "Honor Roll" Hospital, No. 12 in the nation for National Institutes of Health funding, and among the top 10 most innovative research institutions as ranked by the journal Nature in its Nature Innovation Index. This reflects a special level of excellence in education, clinical practice, and research. The Mount Sinai Hospital is ranked No. 14 on U.S. News &amp; World Report's "Honor Roll" of top U.S. hospitals; it is one of the nation's top 20 hospitals in Cardiology/Heart Surgery, Diabetes/Endocrinology, Gastroenterology/GI Surgery, Geriatrics, Gynecology, Nephrology, Neurology/Neurosurgery, and Orthopedics in the 2019-2020 "Best Hospitals" issue. Mount Sinai's Kravis Children's Hospital also is ranked nationally in five out of ten pediatric specialties by U.S. News &amp; World Report. The New York Eye and Ear Infirmary of Mount Sinai is ranked 12th nationally for Ophthalmology, Mount Sinai St. Lukes and Mount Sinai West are ranked 23rd nationally for Nephrology and 25th for Diabetes/Endocrinology, and Mount Sinai South Nassau is ranked 35th nationally for Urology. Mount Sinai Beth Israel, Mount Sinai St. Luke's, Mount Sinai West, and Mount Sinai South Nassau are ranked regionally.</p>
