      <h1>Staff at four Merseyside universities to strike today in row over pay and pensions</h1>
      <h2>A march and rally is scheduled for Tuesday afternoon when politicians will speak before crowds of students</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T05:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 05:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/luke-traynor/" target="_blank">Luke Traynor</a></address>
      <p>Staff at four Merseyside universities are set to walk out on strike today over a dispute about pay, working conditions and pensions.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/university-of-liverpool">The University of Liverpool,</a> Edge Hill University in Ormskirk,, Liverpool Hope University in Childwall and the Liverpool Institute of Performing Arts (LIPA) will be hit with eight days of industrial action after no agreement could be reached between university representatives and the University and College Union (UCU).</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, after <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/hope-university">today's expected picket lines,</a> protesters will assemble from 12pm at University Square on the corner of Brownlow Hill and Mount Pleasant, before marching through the city centre to the Universities Superannuation Scheme headquarters at the Liver Building.</p>
      <p>The march will be followed by a rally that will feature <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/education">speeches by UCU general secretary Jo Grady</a>, Labour MP candidates for Walton, Wavertree and West Derby - Dan Carden, Paula Baker and Ian Byrne.</p>
      <p>Last week, <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/edge-hill-university">union bosses accused the universities</a> of "playing games" after their representatives refused to even discuss pay, they said.</p>
      <p>The deadlock was also not broken during further talks over changes to the Universities Superannuation Scheme when "no serious offer was made," the union added.</p>

      <p>UCU north west regional official Martyn Moss said: "Strike action is a last resort, but universities’ refusal to deal with these key issues have left us with no alternative.</p>
      <p>"It is staggering and insulting that universities have not done more to work with us to try and find a way to resolve these disputes.</p>
      <p>"We hope students will continue to put pressure on university vice-chancellors to get their representatives back round the negotiating table for serious talks with the union."</p>
      <p>The relevant strike dates are November 25, 26, 27, 28 and 29, and on December 2, 3 and 4.</p>
      <p>These developments come less than two years after 65 universities were brought to a standstill by 14 days of strikes over changes to staff pensions, in an unprecedented wave of industrial action.</p>
      <p>Last month's balloting means that members at 60 UK universities are walking out today.</p>

      <p>Along with the eight strike days, union members will also begin a period of working to rule.</p>
      <p>This involves tactics including working strictly to contract, not covering for absent colleagues and refusing to reschedule lectures lost to strike action.</p>
      <p>UK students are facing disruption to their studies in the last few weeks of term, with lectures and tutorials cancelled and no plans to reschedule lost teaching time.</p>
      <p>Union bosses think pension changes will leave lecturers around £240,000 worse off in retirement, and professors up to £730,000 worse off.</p>
      <p>And, on the issue of pay, UCU officials claimed there'd been a 17 per cent real-terms drop since 2009 and there was concern about pay inequality for women and black and ethnic minority staff.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for Liverpool Hope University said: "We can confirm that The University &amp; College Union has given formal notice that they will be encouraging their members to participate in the planned national industrial action, including both full strike action and action short of strike.</p>

      <p>"They are striking over a national pay offer.</p>
      <p>"All pay withheld from those taking industrial action will be allocated to activities that support students affected by the strikes and we will continue to allocate resources over the course of the next few months as the work to mitigate the industrial action continues.</p>

      <p>"The university is committed to care of its students, both academically and pastorally, in particular ensuring that student opportunities for learning are as disrupted as little as possible.</p>
      <p>"Wherever possible, teaching sessions will run during the period of the industrial action.</p>
      <p>"Where this is not possible replacement learning opportunities will be offered following the industrial action.</p>
      <p>"The university has contacted all of its students individually and provided information on the university's student website."</p>
