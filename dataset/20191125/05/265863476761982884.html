      <h1>Craig Conover Is Having Fun Living The Single Life — Southern Charm Star Took Date To Go See Frozen On Broadway</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T05:07:23+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 05:07</time> by <a rel="author">Ricki Mathers</a></address>
      <p>Craig Conover has gone from lazy law school graduate to a pillow entrepreneur seemingly overnight. His breakup with Naomie Olindo may have been the best and worst thing for the single Southern Charm star.</p>
      <p>Naomie and Craig broke up nearly two years ago after the two seemingly just couldn’t get along. The 30-year-old was unmotivated and not ambitious enough for the fashion line owner.</p>
      <p>He admitted to slipping in a deep depression after trying and failing at repairing his broken relationship with his ex. However, the terrible split served as a catalyst to the Bravolebrity’s metamorphosis who took up sewing and gave up doing Adderall — which has made him flourish ever since.</p>
      <p>Now that Craig is happily single and successful — he is enjoying it all.</p>

      <p>He spoke to Entertainment Tonight where he revealed: ‘I’m happily single. I’m having fun, like, I’m dating and I’ve hung out with some cool people and, you know, went to Frozen [on Broadway] the other night with a girl and stuff … I’m having fun, but it’s kind of, like, nothing too serious and, you know, if I meet the right person, of course, I’m down to settle down.’</p>
      <p>He’s been spending his time in New York now that the show is not taping. It’s also a great place to promote his brand Sewing Down South.</p>
      <p>‘I dated a few girls up here since last year. I kind of like the New York scene right now. I mean, Charleston is my home base, but it’s an easy flight, it’s an hour and 10 minutes. And I don’t know what’s gonna happen, man. I’m married to my pillows right now. And we have a lot of exciting things coming.’</p>
      <p>Conover wants to share his success with his co-star Austen Kroll who recently launched his own beer but it hasn’t pulled together just yet.</p>
