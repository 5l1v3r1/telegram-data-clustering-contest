      <p>Two days after his nephew sprung a surprise and foiled all plans of the NCP to form the government with Shiv Sena and Congress, Sharad Pawar has finally spoken on the delay in staking claim, which gave enough time for Ajit Pawar to orchestrate the coup that left everyone shocked.</p>
      <p>On being asked if he Ajit Pawar's move has his backing, Sharad Pawar said, "I have come much ahead with Shiv Sena. I would have taken my partymen in confidence if I had such plans."</p>
      <p>He added, "I cannot do anything bad with Shiv Sena as I promised them. We have to run the government for 5 years with three parties, we couldn't act in a hurry."</p>
      <p>NCP and Congress leaders held several rounds of meetings over the past week since the President's rule was imposed in Maharashtra on November 12. Soon after BJP refused to form the government, Shiv Sena reached out to NCP-Congress, however, even after almost two weeks, the three parties couldn't stake claim to form the government.</p>
      <p>While insiders from the meetings suggested Congress demanded the Deputy CM's post and consensus on the Common Minimum Programme (CMP), it is clear now that NCP and Shiv Sena too couldn't agree on the power sharing formula.</p>
      <p>Sharad Pawar made the big revelation at the death anniversary event of former Maharashtra Chief Minister Yashwantrao Balwantrao Chavan at Karad on Monday.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, NCP, Congress and Shiv Sena leaders submitted a letter of support to Governor BS Koshyari on Monday morning ahead of the crucial Supreme Court hearing of their petition.</p>
      <p>The parties had moved the court seeking an immediate floor test in the Maharashtra assembly.</p>
