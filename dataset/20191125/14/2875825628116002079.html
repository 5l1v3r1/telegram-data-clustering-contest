      <h1>Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp only saw Vincent Kompany screamer because of his wife</h1>
      <h2>The former Manchester City captain's stunning strike against Leicester City last season effectively won his side the Premier League at Liverpool's expense</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T14:20:45+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 14:20</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp admitted he had not intended to watch Manchester City's crucial game against <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> last season but was convinced to do so by his wife.</p>
      <p>City were two points behind the Reds with a game in hand going into the last week of the campaign, meaning their game against the Foxes was effectively a title-decider.</p>
      <p>Until the 70th minute it looked as though Klopp's side may have been handed the advantage in the race, with the scores level at 0-0.</p>
      <p>But Vincent Kompany then stepped up and smashed in a 25-yard screamer to break <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> hearts, and the 1-0 win coupled with City's 4-1 victory over <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/brighton-and-hove-albion-fc">Brighton</a> on the final day of the season meant the Merseysider's wait for a top flight title was extended to 29 years.</p>

      <p>Klopp attended the Football Writers’ Association northern branch managers’ awards dinner in Manchester on Sunday evening, and according to <a href="https://theathletic.co.uk/1398545/2019/11/25/ornstein-on-monday-raiola-complicates-united-pursuit-of-haaland-adidas-gives-mourinho-special-treatment-rogue-firms-exploit-premier-league-clubs-bruce-shelves-new-book/?redirected=1">The Athletic</a> the German admitted it was the most nerve-wracking game he experienced all season.</p>
      <p>He allegedly only watched the match because his wife had suggested he should do so, and said: "this game, second by second by second I started... hoping."</p>
      <p>Although their title race ended in heartbreak, there was to be a bright side for Klopp and his side as they went on to beat <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> to win the Champions League in June.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/pep-guardiolas-special-request-jurgen-20954261">And at the same awards dinner Pep Guardiola reportedly joked "maybe we can swap?"</a> with regard to the two trophies, with he and his City side known to be desperate for European glory while Liverpool are more focused on winning the league.</p>
      <p>Both Liverpool and City won at the weekend, with Klopp's team overcoming <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> and City beating Crystal Palace, and they are both in action in the Champions League this week against Napoli and Shakhtar Donetsk respectively.</p>
