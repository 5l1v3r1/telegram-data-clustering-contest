      <h1>The fascinating tale of woman who lived in the ruins of her beloved seaside village</h1>
      <h2>Elizabeth Prettejohn refused to leave Hallsalls even while sea wiped away the vast majority of her village</h2>

      <p>This is the story of an incredible woman who lost everything to the elements… but decided to stay and live in the ruins of her seaside village.</p>
      <p>Hallsands was a small fishing village on the Devon coast.</p>
      <p>A community of 79 villagers inhabited the hamlet, made up of a small number of houses, a shop and a tiny pub, the London Inn.</p>
      <p>Elizabeth Prettejohn was born in this pub up on the cliff, <a href="https://www.devonlive.com/news/devon-news/strange-true-life-elizabeth-prettejohn-3517389">reports Devon Live.</a> She had lived a peaceful life of fishing alongside the men, following in the footsteps of generations of women before her.</p>
      <p>But on the fateful night of January 26, 1917, everything fell apart.</p>
      <p>Around 8pm, a terrible storm battered Hallsands and its inhabitants were forced to flee, only to watch their beloved village crumble to pieces, washed out into the ocean.</p>
      <p>By midnight, 37 houses had been destroyed, as well as the shop… and the London Inn.</p>

      <p>Miraculously, all the inhabitants were safe and sound.</p>
      <p>Most of the villagers were relocated by the government, but one stubborn family decided to stay - the Prettejohns.</p>
      <p>Elizabeth, then 33, decided to stay with her family, and to live in the only relatively safe cottage, which she renamed Sea View.</p>
      <p>Old British Pathe footage even described her as the “last inhabitant and keeper of memories [...] refusing to give away to the irresistible advance of the sea”.</p>

      <p>Elizabeth once said: "I have all my memories here, but it's no good sitting down moping.</p>
      <p>“It blew for four days and four nights. The sea was like mountains. I prayed to God that the wind would stop.</p>
      <p>"Once I thought of moving to Dartmouth, but this is where I belong with my memories."</p>
      <p>Even after all her relatives had passed away, the strong woman stayed in the last surviving cottage, living on fish and eggs provided by her hens, until her death in 1964, aged 80.</p>
      <h3>An industrial tragedy</h3>
      <p>Before the Industrial Revolution in the late 19th century, there was a 90 ft wide bank of shingle that protected the village from harsh weather conditions and being battered by the sea.</p>
      <p>But in the 1890s, all of that was removed to expand the naval dockyard at Keyham, near Plymouth.</p>
      <p>More than 1,600 tons of shingle a day were taken by the authorities to make concrete.</p>
      <p>The villagers protested… but they were ignored.</p>
      <p>Inevitably the sea rose up to the cliff on that night in January 1917 and Hallsands became history.</p>
      <p>Only Elizabeth remained.</p>
