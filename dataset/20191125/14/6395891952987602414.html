      <p>This is his first year in the NFL and Dwayne Haskins made a mark in this year's season and it wasn't for something he did on the field for his first career victory. </p>
      <p>His team was on offense, so he should have been getting the snap, but Haskins missed the final play of the game Sunday, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2019/11/24/dwayne-haskins-misses-final-play-redskins-win-while-taking-selfie-with-fans/">The Washington Post reported</a>.</p>
      <p>He wasn't hurt. He wasn't in the locker room.</p>

      <p>Haskins was on the sidelines taking selfies with fans as the game clock ticked down, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2019/11/24/dwayne-haskins-misses-final-play-redskins-win-while-taking-selfie-with-fans/">The Washington Post reported</a>.</p>

      <p>The Redskins were leading the Detroit Lions 19-16 but needed another kneel down to make the game official. It was the team's first win at home this season, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/24/us/redskins-quarterback-selfie-trnd/index.html">CNN reported</a>.</p>
      <p>Coaches were looking for Haskins, but sent his backup Case Keenum in for the final snap. </p>
      <p>Interim coach Bill Callahan said he thinks his QB thought the game was done. </p>
      <p>Haskins admitted he didn't realize that the game wasn't over as he was taking photos.</p>
      <p>While some are cheering for Haskins' faux pas, one former Redskins quarterback isn't having any of it.</p>
      <p>Joe Theismann said that Haskins' missing the final snap was "unprofessional and wrong."</p>

      <p>The fan who distracted Haskins, Jaime López-Verduzco, has taken responsibility for the mistake, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/24/us/redskins-quarterback-selfie-trnd/index.html">CNN reported</a>. It was López-Verduzco's first NFL game in person.</p>
      <p>Callahan wasn't happy either that Haskins missed the final play. He said he would address the issue when he spoke to reporters after the game, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2019/11/24/dwayne-haskins-misses-final-play-redskins-win-while-taking-selfie-with-fans/">The Washington Post reported</a>.</p>
