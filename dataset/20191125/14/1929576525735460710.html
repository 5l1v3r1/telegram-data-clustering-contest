      <p>WINNIPEG -- It will be a party 29 years in the making.</p>
      <p>A Grey Cup celebration will take place in Winnipeg Tuesday to mark the Blue Bombers 33-12 win over the Hamilton Tiger-Cats. It was a matchup dubbed the ‘Drought Bowl’ because both teams had gone decades without a championship win.</p>
      <p>“There will be a parade, and it will be on Tuesday afternoon,” Wade Miller, president and CEO of the Winnipeg Blue Bombers, told CTV Morning Live Winnipeg’s Rahim Ladhani on Monday morning.</p>
      <p>Details on a time and a route for the parade are expected to be released later on Monday. This story will be updated with that information as soon as it becomes available.</p>
      <p>The team is scheduled to arrive at Winnipeg’s airport at around 3 p.m. Monday.</p>
      <p>Speaking over the phone from Calgary, Miller, who first joined the team as player in 1995, called the win great for the team and the city.</p>
      <p>“It felt really good all game,” said Miller of the team’s dominant performance.</p>
      <p>He said even though the Bombers led the scoreboard throughout the game, he wasn’t counting on the win until the end.</p>
      <p>“Not until the clock ticked zero on the fourth quarter, because it’s the CFL so you never know what can happen,” he said. “Never take anything for granted.”</p>
      <p>He described the winning team as a “great locker room.”</p>
      <p>“They play for each other,” he said. “And when you play for each other, special things can happen, and that’s what you saw last night.”</p>
