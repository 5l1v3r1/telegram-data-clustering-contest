      <p>Andrew Favorov, a top Ukraine energy official, told prosecutors that Rudy Giuliani associates Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman tried to recruit him to take over the state oil and gas company.</p>

He said that they asked if he was a Republican and said they wanted him to be “their guy.”</p>
      <p>Favorov said that he told the men he couldn’t help them. Parnas’ lawyer denied his account.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors are investigating after Parnas and Fruman were arrested on campaign finance charges. They are also scrutinizing Giuliani’s involvement in the men’s business interests.</p>
