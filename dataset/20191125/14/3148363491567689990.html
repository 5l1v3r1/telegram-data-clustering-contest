      <p>On November 9, 2019, Breitbart News <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/11/09/michael-bloomberg-gun-control/">reported</a> the depth of Bloomberg’s gun control support.</p>
      <p>He backs criminalizing private gun sales via universal background checks, banning “assault weapons,” banning “high capacity” magazines, expanding the prohibited purchaser’s list, instituting more gun trafficking laws, instituting Red Flag Laws, and placing more regulations on gun shows.</p>
      <p>In addition to supporting gun control, the groups funded by Bloomberg fight to oppose the exercise of Second Amendment rights.</p>
      <p>Everytown for Gun Safety and Moms Demand Action fight against campus carry for self-defense, allowing teachers to be armed to shoot back if under attack, and streamlining concealed carry laws nationally, so concealed carry licenses are recognized state-to-state like driver’s licenses.</p>
