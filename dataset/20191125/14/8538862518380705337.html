      <h1>Rumour: Tony Hawk's Pro Skater Remakes Incoming, Says Infamous Insider</h1>
      <h2>E3 2019 leaker returns</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T14:30:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 14:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.pushsquare.com/users/LiamCroft" target="_blank">Liam Croft</a></address>
      <p>The original <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hawk%27s_Pro_Skater_(video_game)">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater</a> and its sequel are widely considered to be two of the very best games released on the PSone, so imagine our delight when reports began cropping up about potential remakes of the excellent twosome. According to one Twitter insider, who rather unceremoniously leaked almost the entirety of <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/tags/e3-2019">E3 2019</a> earlier this year, the titles are about to be released on PlayStation 4 with a fresh lick of paint.</p>
      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/New_WabiSabi/status/1198399011805261824">According to Sabi</a>, prototypes of the remake have been kicking around Activision for a while now, but now they're about to be released on the current generation of consoles as fully-fledged games. If we take the rumour to be true, which we do with a very large grain of salt, could this be an announcement planned for <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/tags/the-game-awards">The Game Awards</a>?</p>

      <p>The show is only a few weeks out now, so there's not too much time left before all is revealed. It would certainly make up for the dreadful <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/tony_hawks_pro_skater_5">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5</a> at the very least. Do you believe this rumour? Do you hope Tony Hawk's Pro Skater makes its way to PS4? Ollie into the comments below.</p>
