      <p>Nov. 25 (UPI) -- Director <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/J.J._Abrams/?tps=1">J.J. Abrams</a> said on <i>Good Morning America</i> Monday that it would have been impossible to end the Skywalker saga in <i>Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</i> without the late <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Carrie_Fisher/?tps=1">Carrie Fisher</a>.</p>
      <p>Fisher, who <a href="https://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/2019/10/21/Billie-Lourd-pays-tribute-to-Carrie-Fisher-sings-American-Girl/8331571676835/">famously portrayed</a> Leia Organa throughout the <i>Star Wars</i> series, died at the age of 60 in 2016 before filming on <i>The Rise of Skywalker</i> had started.</p>
      <p>"Carrie, whom I loved, we needed to have her in the movie somehow," <a href="https://twitter.com/GMA/status/1198962112590053377">Abrams said</a> before explaining how he is using older footage of the actress to place her into the new film.</p>
      <p>"We realized that there were probably five or six scenes that we never used from <i>The Force Awakens. </i>We went back and looked at the footage and realized we could tell the story, we could create scenes with her," he said.</p>
      <p>"There are some scenes with her that I think are really moving and it's still impossible for me to believe she's not here," the filmmaker said.</p>
      <p>"We've been working with her in the editing room now for almost a year and she's vital, and she's there, she's funny, she's Leia in this movie. It's sort of surreal."</p>
      <p>Abrams also showcased an action scene from the film featuring Rey (Daisy Ridley), Finn (John Boyega), Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo) and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) being chased in the desert by Stormtroopers on vehicles.</p>
      <p>The heroes are shocked to discover that the Stormtroopers can now fly using jetpacks.</p>
      <p><i>Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</i>, is set to hit theaters on Dec. 20.</p>
