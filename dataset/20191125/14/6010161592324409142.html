      <h1>Don’t expect GTA Online content to stop coming anytime soon</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T14:15:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 14:15</time> by <a rel="author">Sherif Saed</a></address>
      <p>Despite its age, and the release of Red Dead Online, Rockstar is not yet done making GTA Online content.</p>
      <p><b>GTA Online</b> has been a massive, enduring success for Rockstar. What started out as a novelty add-on evolved into its own game that <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/08/01/gta-onlines-diamond-casino-launch-record-numbers/">continues to break player records</a>.</p>
      <p>Many assumed things would start to wind down for GTA Online when Read Dead Online first became available. We’re now a year into that, and both games continue to be developed in tandem.</p>
      <p>According to Rockstar North co-studio head, Rob Nelson, this is intentional, and things will continue down that path for the foreseeable future. In fact, Rockstar has plans for at least another year of content for GTA Online.</p>

      <p>“We try to keep plans going roughly a year out, but we want to have the flexibility to be responsive to any changes,” Nelson told <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/the-past-present-and-future-of-rockstars-world-conquering-grand-theft-auto-online/">PC Gamer</a>. “So we choose not to telegraph that entire timeline to players.”</p>
      <p>“That said, players should feel confident that we have a ton of brand new ideas still to come. It’s been six years and we just hit record player numbers and we are all incredibly grateful to everyone who’s been with us along the way.</p>
      <p>In the immediate future, Nelson added that players should look forward to holiday events in GTA Online, and more beyond.</p>
      <p>GTA Online’s most recent major event <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/10/31/celebrate-halloween-week-gta-online/">rolled out around Halloween</a>, bringing a new mode and a new vehicle. In the summer, the game saw the release of the Diamond Casino.</p>
