        <b>Dame Barbara Windsor was left ‘quite emotional’ after she learned that EastEnders will be paying tribute to her.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Viewers of the BBC One soap will know that Louise Mitchell (<a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/tilly-keeper/">Tilly Keeper</a>) — Peggy Mitchell’s granddaughter — is carrying Keanu Taylor’s (<a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/danny-walters/">Danny Walters</a>) baby, and she’s due to give birth in the coming episodes. Upon the child’s arrival, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/24/eastenders-pay-tribute-soap-legend-dame-barbara-windsor-naming-louise-mitchells-baby-peggy-11209700/">Lou will name the baby after her grandmother, Peggy</a>.</p>
      <p>According to Barbara’s husband Scott Mitchell, the legendary actress was rather emotional after learning the news. He told <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10410063/eastenders-bosses-tribute-barbara-windsor-naming-shows-latest-arrival/">The Sun newspaper</a>: ‘She thought what a lovely thing it is Peggy Mitchell will live on in a family member. What a lovely tribute.’</p>
      <p>‘It made her quite emotional and I have been reminding her each time we watch the show every night. Each time her whole face lights up.’</p>
      <p>Longtime EastEnders viewers will know that Barbara played Mitchell matriarch Peggy from 1994 to 2016.</p>

      <p>The actress took over the role from Jo Warne — who briefly portrayed Peggy for a handful of episodes in 1991 — and remained with the soap until she decided to depart in 2010.</p>

      <p>Following her permanent departure, Peggy returned numerous times between 2013 and 2015 — including an appearance to give Phil (Steve McFadden) a much-needed talking to in the hospital, and a one-off return to The Vic for the soap’s 30th anniversary, where she came face-to-face with current landlord Mick Carter (Danny Dyer).</p>
      <p>Peggy <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2016/05/17/eastenders-18-of-the-most-peggy-mitchell-moments-in-dame-barbara-windsors-final-stint-5876539/">returned for a final stint in 2016</a>, when it was revealed that the character was terminally ill.</p>
