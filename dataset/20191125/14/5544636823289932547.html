      <p>Jose Mourinho has ended the rumour of Zlatan Ibrahimovic joining Tottenham after ruling out the possibility.</p>
      <p>The 38-year-old Ibrahimovic helped Manchester United win the Europa League and EFL Cup under Mourinho, and is a free agent after leaving LA Galaxy this month.</p>
      <p>But Mourinho says there is “no chance” of the player signing for Spurs while Harry Kane is at the club.</p>
      <p>“We have the best striker in England,” said Mourinho. “One of the top two, three strikers in the world.</p>
      <p>“It doesn’t make any sense of a striker of Zlatan’s dimensions – a striker in his 30s but that can play at any club in the world – it doesn’t make sense to come to a club where we have Harry Kane.”</p>
