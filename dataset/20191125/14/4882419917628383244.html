      <h1>Arthur &amp; Lenglet set to return for big game against Borussia Dortmund</h1>
      <h2>With Pique suspended, Lenglet will be rushed back from a calf problem</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T14:54:10+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 14:54</time> by <a rel="author">Sport.es</a></address>
      <p>Ernesto Valverde was without Arthur Melo and Clement Lenglet against Leganes. The Brazilian did not play for technical reasons and the Frenchman had a calf problem.</p>
      <p>Both, however, are set to start against Borussia Dortmund on Wednesday. A win will put Barça in the last 16, but anything else is likely to leave them needing a result in Italy against Inter Milan.</p>
      <p>Valverde did not want to risk Lenglet at Leganes with Dortmund in mind. He took advice from the club's medical team and decided to reserve the centre-back.</p>
      <p>A big reason for that is the increased importance Lenglet has this week due to Gerard Pique's suspension. Barça hope -- need -- him fit to partner Samuel Umtiti in the middle of the back four.</p>
      <h3>arthur, KEY IN EUROPE</h3>
      <p>Arthur's case is different. He returned having played two games with Brazil and Valverde preferred to leave him out for the game against Leganes, also with BVB in mind.</p>
      <p>The midfielder has been indispensable in Europe this season, but not so much in La Liga, where he has missed five games. In the Champions League, he only missed the goalless draw against Slavia Prague due to injury.</p>
      <h3>Umtiti BETTER</h3>
      <p>Lenglet's absence against Leganes saw Umtiti partner Pique. It means, for the first time this season, he has completed two full games for Barça, although the first against Celta Vigo came before a two week international break.</p>
      <p>The Frenchman's knee problems, which have been constant since the World Cup in 2018, have denied him minutes but the club have been surprised by his fitness in recent weeks. He's not had any pain, has trained well and completed games. Playing against Dortmund, his second game in a week, is the next big test.</p>
