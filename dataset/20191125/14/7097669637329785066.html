      <h1>Trump boasts of seemingly nonexistent polls showing support for impeachment in the 20s</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T14:17:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 14:17</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://theweek.com/" target="_blank">Brendan Morrow</a></address>
      <p>President Trump is citing impeachment numbers that seem to exist nowhere but his Twitter feed.</p>
      <p>Trump on Monday morning boasted that "support for impeachment is dropping like a rock," claiming that it's "down into the 20s" in some polls.</p>

      <p>But he didn't cite a single example, and no one's sure where he's getting that number from considering virtually every poll has shown support for impeachment in the 40s, with <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/impeachment-polls/"><i>FiveThirtyEight</i>'s poll tracker showing</a> it's at an average of 46.3 percent support.</p>
      <p>Some polls have certainly shown support lower than others, but the <a href="https://twitter.com/dmartosko/status/1198953586652262402"><i>Daily Mail</i>'s David Martosko observes</a>, "the lowest support for impeachment in any public poll since they started coming out in September is 43 percent," meaning Trump apparently shaved off a good 20 points in his tweet.</p>
      <p>It's possible Trump is referring just to support for impeachment among Republicans, but in that case, the number would be an odd one to boast about considering <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/impeachment-polls/">per <i>FiveThirtyEight</i></a>, Republican support for impeachment is actually about 12 percent on average.</p>
      <p>There are plenty of actual findings in real polls that Trump could have easily flagged, including that national support for impeachment on average has indeed <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/471723-independents-souring-on-impeachment-underscores-risk-for-democrats">dropped a few points</a> since October â€” but to the tune of about four percentage points. The nearly 20-point plunge Trump is claiming? Not so much.</p>
