      <p>That is the case of these adorable couple who stood under the sun to protest the punishment laid upon their grandson, Caleb.</p>
      <p>A Twitter user with the handle @kjohnathank took to the micr-blogging platform to share the moment her grandparents took to the open space to protest the punishment her parents gave her brother, Caleb.</p>
      <p>In the photo she shared, her grandparents, apparently old were seen holding placards, with protest words that read;</p>
      <p><i>“Please give Caleb a shorter punishment, 3 weeks</i>,” another reads, “<i>Please give Caleb a lesser punishment release his cell phone”</i></p>
      <p>Her grand parents were not in the best of shapes, as a walking aide could be seen before the elderly man however it did stop them from protesting on behalf of their grandson Caleb.</p>
