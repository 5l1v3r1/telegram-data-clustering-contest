      <h1>Mother of triple murder accused told police not to release her son hours before killings</h1>
      <h2>Alexander Lewis-Ranwell was twice arrested by police in Barnstaple in the days before the deaths</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T14:09:29+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 14:09</time> by <a rel="author">Paul Greaves</a></address>
      <p>The mother of a man accused of murdering three elderly people in Exeter told police not to release her son from custody hours before he went on his killing spree.</p>
      <p>Alexander Lewis-Ranwell was twice arrested by police in Barnstaple in the days before the deaths.</p>
      <p>But despite his mum telling officers she had 'grave concerns' he was allowed back on the streets.</p>
      <p>During his time in custody the 28-year-old defendant, from Braunton, tried to take a taser from an officer, repeatedly shouted and swore at them, urinated in cells, told them he suffered from mental health problems, said he was protecting all animals and had lost his unicorn.</p>
      <p>One officer recorded Lewis-Ranwell presented a 'serious risk to public health'.</p>
      <p>But when a doctor assessed him it was decided he was not psychotic or a suicide risk and did not meet the criteria for a full Mental Health Act assessment which could have included a transfer to hospital.</p>
      <p>A few hours after being released for a second time Lewis-Ranwell killed three people in Exeter.</p>
      <p>The defendant is standing trial at Exeter Crown Court charged with three counts of murder.</p>
      <p>It is alleged that on February 10 he murdered Anthony Payne, 80, at his home in Bonhay Road and then a few hours later twins Dick and Roger Carter, 84, at their house in Cowick Lane.</p>
      <p>He has pleaded not guilty on the basis he was insane at the time he killed.</p>
      <p>The trial has already been told that he used a hammer to kill Mr Payne and a spade to kill the Carter twins.</p>
      <p>On Monday the jury heard further prosecution evidence in the case.</p>
      <p>They were taken through a timeline of events.</p>
      <p>Lewis-Ranwell was first arrested on February 8 for breaking into a farm in Ilfracombe.</p>
      <p>While in custody he told officers he had been sectioned twice for psychotic mental health issues. He told them he was not currently taking any medication. The mental health liaison officer could find no evidence he was engaged with mental health services.</p>
      <p>While in custody Lewis-Ranwell threatened to punch his solicitor and was abusive to his mother on the phone. He also said he would 'like a hen to eat'.</p>
      <p>Prosecutor Mr Richard Smith QC said: "His mother rang asking for the officer in the case as she had grave concerns should he be released."</p>

      <p>Just before 3am Lewis-Ranwell was released from custody for the first time and taken to a homeless shelter in the town called the Freedom Centre. He stayed for a few hours before arguing with a staff member and storming off. The next morning he attacked a farmer, John Ellis, in Goodleigh with a four feet long saw. The farmer suffered a serious wound to his arm and feared he would be killed.</p>
      <p>Lewis-Ranwell was then arrested for a second time and taken back to Barnstaple Police Station - seven hours after his first release. He remained in police care for almost 24 hours, during which time extensive efforts were made to get him assessed by doctors.</p>
      <p>Mr Smith said the defendant's behaviour continued to be abusive. It was decided he needed to see a mental healthcare professional. While waiting for the arrangements to be made he told officers he had lost his unicorn and had to be forcefully restrained when he grabbed an officer's high-voltage taser.</p>
      <p>He also said believed it was his duty to 'protect al animals and sentient beings in the universe'.</p>
      <p>An inspector reviewing his detention recorded: "We are in the process for his mental state to be assessed by an approved mental health practitioner for a serious criminal offence as the detained person presents a serious risk to the public if released."</p>
      <p>Police were told that one mental health liaison worker did not have time to see the suspect in person that day.</p>
      <p>He was eventually seen by a doctor at 6.30pm on Saturday February 9. But it was concluded he did not need a full Mental Health Act assessment. However the doctor did say Lewis-Ranwell should be seen by a mental health nurse before his release.</p>
      <p>Mr Smith QC told the jury Lewis-Ranwell was released on bail at about 9.30am. He was not seen by a nurse before his release.</p>
      <p>He left the town and headed to Exeter.</p>
