        <b>Elgeyo Marakwet Senator <b>Kipchumba Murkomen</b> on Monday, November 25, savagely attacked Interior CS <b>Fred Matiang'i </b>after an unsuccessful mission to West Pokot County.</b>
      </p>
      <p>In a post made on his Twitter account, Murkomen appeared to mock the CS after he was unable to continue with his journey to Kapenguria to meet victims of the deadly West Pokot landslides due to challenging weather conditions.</p>
      <p>"We are [in] Kapenguria to see victims of [the] landslide. Weather not good for Matiangi’s chopper," the senator taunted.</p>

      <p>This c hours after <a href="https://www.kenyans.co.ke/news/46803-cs-matiangis-plane-forced-make-emergency-landing-here">Matiang'i's chopper, heading to Kapenguria was forced to land</a> in Eldoret due to bad weather.</p>
      <p>“It looks like it is very difficult for the helicopters we are using to fly into Kapenguria because it is still raining. It is very foggy, and visibility is not very clear. Because of safety and security considerations, we have been advised to divert to Eldoret,” the Super CS affirmed.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, albeit, owing to rapidly-changing aviation conditions, Deputy President <b>William <a href="https://www.kenyans.co.ke/news/46817-matiangi-no-show-ruto-defies-bad-weather-join-rescue-mission">Ruto's</a></b><a href="https://www.kenyans.co.ke/news/46817-matiangi-no-show-ruto-defies-bad-weather-join-rescue-mission"> chopper was able to access the area</a>, airlifting a number of medical personnel to the area.</p>
      <p>The DP joined jubilee leaders; Murkomen,<b> </b>Kericho Senator <b>Aaron Cheruiyot,</b> footballer-turned-politician <b>McDonald Mariga, </b>and Kapseret MP <b>Oscar Sudi</b> to condole the families of the victims of the deadly landslides that devastated the county following a heavy downpour.</p>
      <p>On Matiang'i's arrival, he had been received by Devolution and Environment Principal Secretaries <b>Micah Pkopus Powon</b> and <b>Charles Sunkuli </b>who opted to meet Matiang'i and CS <b>Eugine Wamalwa</b> in Eldoret.</p>
      <p>Murkomen would go further to attack Matiang'i's entourage of sabotaging the rescue efforts.</p>
      <p>"Meanwhile, PS Powon and Sunkuli have locked the food and clothes for victims inside a store. They have run away with the keys to join [Rift Valley Regional Coordinator] <b>George Natembeya</b> and Matiang'i in planning for the most important Building Bridges Initiative (BBI). Residents to break-in [<i>sic</i>]," he posted.</p>
      <p>He added that Ruto also ordered a chopper to be stationed at Kapenguria for the following couple of days, "to help move medical staff, food, clothes and other needs for the victims until the situation improves."</p>
      <p>Taking to his facebook, Sudi gave damning explanayion as to why Matiang'i had to turn back.</p>
      <p>"On his way to West Pokot, Matiang'i received a call from <b>Raila Odinga </b>who asked him why he was away yet BBI preparation was underway. Matiang'i had to make a quick turn then land in Eldoret Airstrip, give an excuse about 'weather' through a press conference then fly back to Nairobi quickly," Sudi disclosed.</p>
      <p>Matiang'i had earlier indicated that the government had dispatched relief supplies to the affected residents.</p>
      <p>“We have sent some relief supply ahead. I know that because the roads are very difficult to navigate at this time, some of the food and items like blankets may be late to arrive, however, we dispatched some food both from Eldoret and Nairobi and we will continue to support them,” Matiang'i had assured.</p>
