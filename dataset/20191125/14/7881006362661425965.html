      <p><b>New Delhi: </b>Two days after Ajit Pawar was sworn-in as Deputy Chief Minister of Maharashtra, nine irrigation scam cases were closed.</p>
      <p>''None were related to Ajit Pawar,'' said Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) DG Parambir Singh.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Maharashtra Anti Corruption Bureau Sources add that the cases that were closed today were conditional, cases could reopen if more information comes to light or courts order further inquiry.</p>
      <p>The scam with the reported involvement of around Rs 70,000 crore, relates to alleged corruption and irregularities in approval and execution of various irrigation projects in Maharashtra during the Congress-Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) rule.</p>
