      <h1>Rhian Brewster loan will leave Jurgen Klopp and Michael Edwards with key Liverpool transfer decision</h1>
      <h2>The Reds are willing to listen to loan offers for Brewster in the January transfer window</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T14:16:42+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 14:16</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/paul-gorst/" target="_blank">Paul Gorst</a></address>
      <p>Rhian Brewster's Liverpool career so far has been a victim of circumstance.</p>
      <p>Long since tipped as the 'next big thing' at Anfield, a serious and long-term ankle injury shelved the embryonic stages of his Merseyside stay.</p>
      <p>Hard work and long hours were subsequently put in during lengthy spells in the Melwood gym, <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/alex-oxlade-chamberlain-channels-inner-15284103">often with only Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain</a> and thoughts of a senior debut for company.</p>
      <p>Football careers are short; that <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/rhian-brewster">Brewster</a> was robbed of 13 months of his before the end of his teenage years was cruel in the extreme.</p>
      <p>After so much time and admirable effort to get himself fit once more, the striker was rewarded over the summer with more regular involvement in the senior set-up by Reds boss Jurgen Klopp.</p>
      <h3>Pep Guardiola on <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/man-city-boss-pep-guardiola-17310099">when Liverpool could be out of sight</a> in title race</h3>
      <p>Four goals followed during the pre-season programme as Brewster showed flashes of what could be unlocked under the guidance of Klopp.</p>
      <p>Four months into what some thought would be the breakthrough season, the big moment still awaits. Two appearances in the Carabao Cup have offered fleeting glimpses to his predatory talent, but the Premier League debut has not yet arrived.</p>
      <p>Trying to break into the European champions' side is a daunting task for any player, never mind a teenager who is fresh off a year-long lay-off.</p>
      <p>Which is why it is perhaps not surprising to see that <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/liverpools-plan-rhian-brewster-revealed-17310894">Liverpool are willing to listen to loan offers</a> for Brewster when the January transfer window opens.</p>

      <p>Klopp is keen to see Brewster gain some senior exposure elsewhere and will listen to enquiries for the London-born frontman when the window opens.</p>
      <p>"I want to prove to everyone that the boss has kept faith in me for a reason and I want to prove to everyone that I'm good enough to be in the first team," Brewster said earlier this year.</p>
      <p>He will be provided ample opportunity to do just that under Klopp, but, for now, perhaps a short-term switch for regular game-time is a wise ploy.</p>
      <p>Brewster's time will come; he signed a five-year deal with the Reds in the summer of 2018 and the long-term plan remains firmly in place.</p>
      <p>In the more immediate future, however, his potential exit presents Klopp with a couple of posers to ponder when the transfer window opens next year.</p>
      <p>The Liverpool manager is not blessed with reams of options in his frontline at present. Roberto Firmino and Divock Origi remain the only two 'real' centre-forwards in the Liverpool squad.</p>
      <p>Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah have, at times, been asked to play down the middle of Klopp's favoured front three formation, but both are surely more dangerous when darting in from wide areas.</p>
      <p>The question is, if Brewster does complete a loan move away from Anfield in January, will Liverpool feel the need to reinforce their squad up top?</p>
      <p>Xherdan Shaqiri's return from a calf problem bolsters the numbers and provides a significant injection of quality, but like Mane and Salah, the Switzerland international is best suited to the flanks.</p>

      <p>Oxlade-Chamberlain, who <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/match-reports/liverpool-verdict-jurgen-klopps-reds-17306740">started on the left against Crystal Palace</a> on Saturday, is another versatile operator, but the centre of midfield would be his ideal slot.</p>
      <p>At a time when so much could be riding on the months between January and May for Liverpool, leaving themselves short might be foolhardy.</p>
      <p>Anyone suggesting big-money raids for superstar names like Kylian Mbappe or <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/jadon-sancho-interest-ryan-fraser-17308083">Jadon Sancho in the meantime</a> will be disappointed, however.</p>
      <p>Regardless of where you stand on how realistic those moves are, the Reds won't be breaking the bank for anyone in the New Year in the manner of Virgil van Dijk's arrival nearly two years ago.</p>
      <p>Instead, <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/jurgen-klopp">Klopp</a> and sporting director Michael Edwards may be ready to box clever in the market should an acceptable proposition arrive for Brewster in January.</p>
      <p>Brewster's long-term football future, regardless of the next six months, remains at Anfield - but a possible exit may leave <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> with a decision to make.</p>
