      <p>Orange has announced the commercial launch of its mobile banking service in Spain following a <a href="https://www.telecompaper.com/news/orange-spain-to-trial-bank-service-this-summer-ahead-of-november-launch--1291021">trial period</a> and around two years after the platform was rolled out in <a href="https://www.telecompaper.com/news/orange-bank-service-goes-live-in-france--1218702">France</a>. In a statement, the operator said Orange Bank combines the attributes of a traditional bank with a mobile offering delivered via a dedicated app for Android and Apple smartphones.
