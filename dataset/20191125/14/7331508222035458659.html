      <h1>Karabell's first look at Week 13: Julio Jones starving for scores</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T14:06:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 14:06</time> by <a rel="author">Eric Karabell</a></address>
      <p>A much-anticipated Week 13 commences on Thanksgiving Day, when many of us will be stuffing ourselves with turkey, myriad starches and desserts -- while also carving up a trio of NFL games. The night game features the Nos. 2 and 3 wide receivers selected way back when in ESPN average live drafts: <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2976316/michael-thomas">Michael Thomas</a> and <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/13982/julio-jones">Julio Jones</a>. One of them is on pace for record-setting numbers and the other is again struggling to find the end zone.</p>
      <p>Thomas is, incredibly, well on pace to shatter the NFL record for receptions in a season, contributing 10 catches for 101 yards and a touchdown as his <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/no/new-orleans-saints">New Orleans Saints</a> overcame <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3117251/christian-mccaffrey">Christian McCaffrey</a> and the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/car/carolina-panthers">Carolina Panthers</a> for a 34-31 win on Sunday. According to my colleague Tristan H. Cockcroft, Thomas is just the fourth wide receiver to score 15 PPR points in each of his team's first 11 games of a season. He scored 26.1 points on Sunday and now boasts a five-game stretch with 22-plus points. With five games left, he has already surpassed 100 catches and 1,200 receiving yards. He could score double-digit touchdowns in a season for the first time in his fantastic career.</p>
