      <p>INDIANAPOLIS -- The <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/ind/indianapolis-colts">Indianapolis Colts</a> plan to place tight end <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16732/eric-ebron">Eric Ebron</a> on injured reserve due to an ankle injury, a source confirmed to ESPN.</p>
      <p>"It appears so," the source said.</p>
      <p>Ebron played in last week's loss at Houston (four receptions for 44 yards) despite missing two days of practice due to the ankle injury.</p>
      <p>Ebron made the Pro Bowl in his first season with the Colts in 2018, catching 66 passes for 750 yards and 13 touchdowns. But his production dipped this season. Ebron only has 31 receptions for 375 yards and three touchdowns. Ebron, who will be a free agent at the end of the season, has 283 receptions for 3,195 yards and 27 touchdowns in their career.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16504/jack-doyle">Jack Doyle</a> and <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2998565/mo-alie-cox">Mo Alie-Cox</a> will be the top two tight ends for the Colts with the loss of Ebron.</p>
      <p>NFL Network first reported the Ebron news.</p>
