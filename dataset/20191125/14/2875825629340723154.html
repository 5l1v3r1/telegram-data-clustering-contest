      <p>Dele Alli says he blamed himself when Mauricio Pochettino was sacked as <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> boss.</p>
      <p>Pochettino was relieved of his duties at Spurs last Tuesday, after five years at the club, and replaced by Jose Mourinho.</p>
      <p>The Tottenham players went to see Pochettino at his house after the news was announced, and Alli said he and the Argentine sat down and spoke as friends.</p>
      <p>"I think it's so clear what Mauricio meant to the players," said Alli.</p>
      <p>"He helped me grow a lot. I came here as an 18-year-old and had my ups and downs here. When I found out I was upset and I wanted to speak to him. I went to see him.</p>
      <p>"I've seen him more than my family over the past five years. After I heard the news I couldn't wait to see him. I was very upset.</p>

      <p>"It wasn't so much a conversation about football more two friends having a chat."</p>
      <p>Pochettino was sacked following a poor run of results, with Tottenham floundering outside of the top four places having picked up just 14 points in 12.</p>
      <p>Alli featured just five times under Pochettino in the league this season, but says he initially felt partly responsible for the Argentine getting the sack.</p>
      <p>Alli added: "I would be lying if I didn't blame myself when it first happened rather than looking at the bigger picture. We had a great journey. You can't help but feel like you're to blame because you're out there but I realised I gave 110 per cent always.</p>

      <p>"We've worked with Mauricio for so long. It's new to a lot of us. The squad we had was a lot of young players coming in and it's the first time we've had a change in manager.</p>
      <p>"We know where we should be and the talent we have. It's important that we show everyone. This season doesn't show how good we are as a squad and that's why we're not worried.</p>
      <p>"You want to impress but at the same time you just want to win games. We've always given everything to win."</p>
