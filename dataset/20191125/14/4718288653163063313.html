      <p>NEW DELHI: Veteran Indian off-spinner Harbhajan Singh is hoping that BCCI President Sourav Ganguly will "change" the current selection panel and bring "strong people" on board.</p>
      <p>The 39-year-old was reacting to wicketkeeper-batsman Sanju Samson being dropped from the Indian Twenty20 squad without getting a game in the recent home series against Bangladesh.</p>
      <p>"I guess they r testing his heart #selectionpanelneedtobechanged need strong people there. Hope dada @SGanguly99 will do the needful," he tweeted.</p>
      <p>Harbhajan quoted a tweet from Congress MP Shashi Tharoor, who represents Thiruvananthapuram in the Lok Sabha, to make his point.</p>
      <p>Tharoor had expressed disappointment at the 25-year-old Kerala player not getting an opportunity.</p>
      <p>"Very disappointed to see @IamSanjuSamson dropped without a chance. He carried the drinks for three T20Is &amp; has been promptly discarded. Are they testing his batting or his heart?" he asked.</p>
      <p>The current selection panel is headed by MSK Prasad, who played six Tests and 17 ODIs for India, and comprises Devang Gandhi, Jatin Pranjpe, Sarandeep Singh and Gagan Khoda.</p>

      <p>Samson has scored 112 runs from four games he played for Kerala in the ongoing Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy National T20 Championship.</p>
      <p>He played his only T20 International in 2015 against Zimbabwe.</p>
