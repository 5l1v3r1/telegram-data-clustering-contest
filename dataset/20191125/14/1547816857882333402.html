        <b>After Selena Gomez took the 2019 AMAs stage after the gap of two years, fans are convinced that she was anxious. The Singer performed on her two latest singles that depict her break-up and moving on post-Justin Bieber. Was she pressuring herself because of the same just before she went live to perform?</b>

      <p>The 2019 American Music Awards just concluded last night and boy, what a night it was. From celebrating the best from the music world to honouring artists, the 2019 AMA's was as LIT as it could ever be. The highlight of the musical night were performances no doubt by Taylor Swift as she accepted the Artist Of The Decade Award. Jonas Brothers who gave a live performance all the way from their Boston Tour, Camila Cabello and Shawn Mendes' steamy Senorita performance and of course Selena Gomez, who returned to the AMA stage after a gap of two years to live-perform not one but two of her latest singles.  </p>
      <p>As soon as Selena took to the stage and started with her performance on "Lose You To Love Me" and "Look At Her Now" fans were quick to note the singer being anxious and also going off-key at some places. While she sang the lyrics of the two songs that are about heartbreak and moving on, Gomez very evidently got emotional at times which did not go unnoticed thanks to her fans. Talking to E! News, a source suggested, "Selena definitely had anxiety and a panic attack before she went out and was putting a lot of pressure on herself."</p>

      <p>Now, whoever is a fan of Selena Gomez is well aware of her recent emotional upheavals and how she has been battling with her feelings since she and Justin Bieber broke up. In fact, many suggest that the lyrics of the two songs "Lose You To Love Me" and "Look At Her Now", both are a reflection of her difficult times post her break-up with Justin Beiber and where she stands today.</p>

      <p>Selena had also opened up about her thoughts on her recent songs and the support she gets from her fans in an interview with Ryan Seacrest a month ago, where she said, "They've stood by me for years and years and they've walked with me through everything I've gone through. I just wanted to let them know I was good."</p>

      <p>Post her performance, Selena also looked a lot at ease as she joined the audience. The singer also seemed upbeat when Taylor Swift hit the stage. Gomez also ended up lipsyncing to Swift's song!<br/><br/><br/><i>Image Source:- instagram/selenagomez</i></p>
