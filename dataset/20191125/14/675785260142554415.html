      <h2>Deontay Wilder knocked out Luis Ortiz on Saturday night and his performance has seen him earn high praise from boxing legend Muhammad Ali’s ex-wife</h2>

      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/deontay-wilder">Deontay Wilder</a> has been hailed as the ‘greatest of all time’ by none other than Muhammad Ali’s ex-wife.</p>
      <p>Wilder ensured his unbeaten streak continued on Saturday night as he stopped Luis Ortiz with a seventh round stoppage with a stunning right-hander.</p>
      <p>The likes of Mike Tyson and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tyson-fury">Tyson Fury</a> ’s trainer Ben Davison were ringside in Las Vegas with Muhammad Ali’s former wife, Khalilah Ali, also present.</p>
      <p>The pair married in 1967 when Khalilah was aged 17 and they went on to have four children.</p>
      <p>Khalilah saw first hand how special Ali was in the ring with many boxing fans ranking him as the best of all time.</p>

      <p>However, following Wilder’s fight with Ortiz, Khalilah declared the Bronze Bomber as the greatest of all-time.</p>
      <p>“You are definitely the King of the Ring, you don’t have to prove anything, just do your thing,” she said.</p>
      <p>“I told him, I said ‘look at that brother, you’re in trouble’. I knew it.</p>
      <p>“I know the greatest when I see it. You are the GOAT (greatest of all time) brother. Thank you so much.”</p>

      <p>Wilder is now set for a rematch with Tyson Fury early next year and is not short of confidence following his latest victory.</p>
      <p>The American feels he has now started earning respect of those who don’t think he’s the hardest-hitting puncher in history.</p>
      <p>"I think I earned my respect to say I'm the hardest-hitting puncher in boxing history. Period," Wilder said after securing his 42nd win from 43 fights, 41 by knockout.</p>
      <p>"I do what I do time and time again. I give people great fights and great knockouts.</p>

      <p>"You've got to give me my credit," he said. "It's sad that it took me over 40 fights to get the recognition that I truly deserve.</p>
      <p>"When people see me, they have never seen my style. It took them a while to get used to what I display, my talent that I present to boxing.</p>
      <p>"It's different to any other fighter. It's not textbook. You can't really teach it and that's what makes me unique from the rest of these fighters."</p>
