      <h1>Intel and MediaTek To Co-Develop 5G Solution for PC; Available in 2021</h1>

      <p>In a rather interesting move, Intel and MediaTek have partnered together to develop 5G solutions for PCs.While we are aware that the company continue to work on delivering 5G for PCs after selling off its mobile modem business to Apple, we originally expects that the company would work on it internally.</p>
      <p>According to the official announcement from Intel, the company will define the 5G solution specifications which will mainly based on the needs of respective laptop segments. Software and hardware integration will also be under Intel’s responsibilities.</p>

      <p>From there, MediaTek will then develop and manufacture the 5G modem which will be partly based on Helio M70 5G modem. Both companies are also working with Fibocom to come out with M.2-based 5G modules.</p>
      <p>Intel has also revealed that the first wave of products to feature the new 5G solutions co-developed by the company and MediaTek is expected to be available in 2021. Dell and HP apparently already onboard to adopt the new 5G solutions, so expect to hear more about it within the next months.</p>
