      <p>THE HAGUE, Nov 25 — The head of the global chemical weapons organisation today defended the agency’s conclusion that poison was used in a high profile attack in Syria last year, after leaked documents suggested two former employees doubted some of its findings.</p>
      <p>More than 40 people were killed in the April 7 attack in Douma, a town on the outskirts of Damascus that was then held by rebels.</p>
      <p>The United States, Britain and France retaliated a week later by firing missiles at Syrian government targets, the biggest Western military action against the Damascus authorities of the eight year war.</p>
      <p>Inspectors from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons concluded in a report released on March 1 that a toxic chemical containing chlorine was used in an attack. The team was not mandated to assign blame for who used the toxic chemical.</p>
      <p>However, the Syrian government and its Russian allies have rejected the findings, saying they believe the incident was staged by rebels and no attack had taken place.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, anti-secrecy group Wikileaks published an internal email to the former chief of staff at the OPCW in which an unidentified inspector described a report as having been edited to appear more conclusive than the inspectors’ findings.</p>
      <p>“I am requesting that the fact-finding report be released in its entirety as I fear this redacted version no longer reflects the work of the team,” the inspector wrote. An OPCW source told Reuters the June 22, 2018 email was genuine.</p>
      <p>OPCW chief Fernandon Arias said the body stands by the findings it published in March this year.</p>
      <p>“While some of these diverging views continue to circulate in certain public discussion forums, I would like to reiterate that I stand by the independent, professional conclusions” of the report, he told delegates on Monday.</p>
      <p>“The secretariat has, as it always does, considered and taken into account all information submitted,” he said.</p>
      <p>Douma is expected to be a major theme at the annual conference of the OPCW being held in The Hague this week.</p>
      <p>Criticism of the OPCW’s findings over the incident have been circulating since reports on pro-Russian and pro-Syrian media outlets cited another leaked internal document by a former OPCW employee named Ian Henderson in May.</p>
      <p>Henderson, who helped the OPCW’s team collect samples during a field mission to Douma, wrote that two cylinders found at the scene were most likely placed there rather than being dropped from the air.</p>
      <p>The Syrian war has split the OPCW, once largely a technical organisation, along political lines, with Russia and its ally Syria on one side and the United States, France and Britain on the other.</p>
      <p>A United Nations-OPCW Joint Investigative Mechanism (JIM) previously carried out the task of assigning blame for chemical weapons attacks, but Russia vetoed a resolution to extend its mandate beyond November 2017.</p>
      <p>The JIM concluded in a series of reports that the Syrian military used both nerve agent sarin and chlorine as weapons, while Islamic State insurgents had used sulphur mustard gas on the battlefield.</p>
      <p>A new agency unit, the Investigation and Identification Team, is looking into who was responsible for the Douma attack , against the wishes of Moscow and Damascus. — Reuters</p>
