      <p>In case you hadn’t heard, the television rights for <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/premier-league/95244/amazon-and-bt-sport-score-remaining-2019-20-premier-league-games">Premier League games</a> have been split up even further. Previously the rights had been held by <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/deals/82506/compare-the-cheapest-ways-to-watch-the-premier-league-live-on-tv">Sky Sports</a> and <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/deals/82593/the-best-bt-sport-deals-and-tv-packages-for-august-2019">BT Sport</a>, but during recent negotiations, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/44396151">Amazon stepped in</a> and scored a number of games that are set to air at the end of 2019.</p>
      <p>Boxing Day games are events that many football fans enjoy, but if you’re not going to watch a game live this year, you’ll need to take some <a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/bfs8">extra steps</a> to ensure you can catch the best moments during the Christmas period.</p>
      <h4>Watch the Premier League on Amazon Prime</h4>
      <hr/>
      <p>Amazon will be showing <a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/bfs8">20 Premier League fixtures</a> from December 3 to December 27 this year, with nine of these being shown on Boxing Day. These post-Christmas fixtures will be exclusively streamed on the Amazon platform. Therefore, if you want to watch any of these games, you’re going to need an Amazon Prime account, which will grant you access to Prime Video.</p>

      <p>To get access to Prime, you can sign up for <a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/bfs8">£7.99 per month</a>, or partake in a <a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/bfs8">30-day free trial</a> near the beginning of December. If you’re looking to take full advantage of Amazon Prime, you can also sign up for a full year, costing <a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/bfs8">£79</a>. Students can pick up Amazon Prime even cheaper at the moment. This works out at only <a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/bfs8">£3.99 per month</a>, with a six-month free trial thrown in at the start, as well.</p>
      <p>If you’re already a Prime member, you don’t need to do anything. Continue enjoying Prime and get set for a new way to watch Premier League football over Christmas.</p>
