      <p>What's Brown Friday? Only the biggest day of the year for plumbers in the country.</p>
      <p>This Thursday, you're going to have a lot of people cooking a massive feast for the family. You will also have people that have no idea what they're doing in the kitchen, by that I mean the aftermath. The dishes on Thanksgiving pile up and people just want to use the old trusty garbage disposal.</p>
      <p>Hate to break this to you, not everything can go in the garbage disposal. Plumbers say the day after Thanksgiving is known as Brown Friday. It is their busiest day of the year. Plumbers say you need to avoid putting F.O.G. down the drain. This stands for Fats, Oil, and Grease. The city of <a href="https://www.kztv10.com/news/local-news/city-offers-free-grease-containers-for-holiday-cooking">Corpus Cristi</a> is actually giving residents free grease containers to prevent this from happening. Sadly, people will still not listen.</p>
