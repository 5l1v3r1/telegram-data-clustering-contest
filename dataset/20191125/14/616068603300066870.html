      <p>A new report says the British Columbia government gives hundreds of millions of dollars annually in subsidies for fossil fuel, including $830 million in the 2017-18 fiscal year.</p>
      <p>The report by the International Institute for Sustainable Development, an environmental think-tank, says most of the money is provided to fossil fuel producers rather than consumers.</p>
      <p>Co-author Vanessa Corkal says oil and gas companies are supposed to pay royalties meant to provide benefits to B.C. residents, including by helping fund health care and education.</p>
      <p>But she says every year companies claim credits to reduce the royalties they pay and the report estimates B.C. has amassed at least $2.6 to $3.1 billion in outstanding royalty credits.</p>
      <p>Tzeporah Berman of environmental group Stand.earth is urging the province to end subsidies to the oil and gas industry before the next election to ensure it can meet climate targets.</p>
      <p>The B.C. Ministry of Energy, Mines and Petroleum did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
