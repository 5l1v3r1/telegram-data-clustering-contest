        <b><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/saffron-barker/">Saffron Barker</a> posed for a teary-eyed selfie with dance partner AJ Pritchard after falling victim to AJ ‘samba curse’ on <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/strictly-come-dancing/">Strictly Come Dancing</a>.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The YouTuber tried to stay positive on social media despite <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/24/strictly-come-dancings-saffron-barker-eliminated-after-shock-dance-off-against-karim-zeroual-11209872/">getting kicked out after facing </a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/karim-zeroual/">Karim Zeroual</a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/24/strictly-come-dancings-saffron-barker-eliminated-after-shock-dance-off-against-karim-zeroual-11209872/"> in the dreaded dance-off</a>.</p>
      <p>Posting the selfie to Instagram, the 19-year-old wrote: ‘So so many emotions.. I am so sad because my strictly journey is over but smiling because I so proud of myself for how far I’ve come.</p>
      <p>‘Sometimes you’ve got to give yourself a pat on the back and tell yourself you did good and that’s exactly what I’m doing right now. Thank you all for your continued support and to my amazing team (you know who you are) and of course to my incredible partner @aj11ace !!</p>
      <p>‘I couldn’t of wished for anyone else to of been partnered with. When i look back to week 1 &amp; how nervous and scared i was, you always believed in me. Thankyou for your patience and all your laughs [sic].’</p>

      <p>The social media influencer and her partner AJ were voted off the BBC competition show unanimously after performing their Samba for judges Shirley Ballas, Bruno Tonioli, Craig Revel Horwood and Motsi Mabuse one last time.</p>
      <p>The panel all decided they preferred Karim and his partner Amy Dowden’s contemporary routine and saved the children’s presenter from going home.</p>

      <p>AJ, 25, commented on Saffron’s post: ‘Saffron just THANK YOU  Thank You,’ along with a few praying hands and one praising hand emoji.</p>
      <p>The professional dancer also uploaded a photo of his own, but of the two smiling happily for the cameras.</p>
      <p>He captioned it: ‘I’m so Happy &amp; Proud of this young Lady. Saffron has defied my expectations at every turn, attacking each week with Positivity &amp; a lust for life to inspire the nation.</p>
      <p>‘Just Thank You for Creating the most memorable &amp; fanatic Strictly 2019 season for me. You will always be my 2019 Strictly Come Dancing Winner.. @saffronbarker @bbcstrictly’.</p>
      <p>This marks the fourth time AJ lost out during his samba round, and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/24/strictly-come-dancings-saffron-barker-aj-pritchard-begged-bosses-avoid-samba-eliminated-11211722/">we’re starting to believe he actually is cursed</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10414296/aj-saffron-beg-skip-samba-strictly/">Speaking to The Sun</a>, Saffron said: ‘We tried to get out of dancing the Samba but they wouldn’t let us.’</p>

      <p>When asked if he thought the song was cursed, AJ then quipped: ‘You should ask production if they think that.’</p>
