      <p>Siya sources have indicated that a Cape Town City defender has surfaced at Orlando Pirates.</p>
      <p>Kouassi Kouadja who is on the books of the Mother City-based outfit, has surfaced at the Buccaneers with sources revealing that the Citizens were initially not aware about his whereabouts.</p>

      </p>
      <p>However, the Ivorian centre-back has not been registered for the 2019/20 season as the Citizens have already exhausted all their foreign quota spots. Indications are that the 24-year-old is not part of the club’s plans, after struggling to make a full return to fitness following a knee operation, which has kept him out of action for more than a year. </p>
      <p>Although, it seems that the player is already on the hunt for a new club, without any confirmation of his release from the Citizens. </p>
      <p>Sources have revealed that the player has been training with Pirates for the past few days and it remains to be seen whether he will do enough to possibly land himself a contract at the club.  </p>
