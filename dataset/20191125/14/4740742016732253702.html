      <h1>'Waste of a wage' - Bristol City and Derby County fans on Jamie Paterson's Ashton Gate return</h1>
      <h2>He looks set for a January return</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T14:57:04+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 14:57</time> by <a rel="author">David Byrom</a></address>
      <p>Bristol City and Derby County fans have been reacting to the news that Jamie Paterson looks set to return to Ashton Gate in January.</p>
      <p>Paterson moved to Derby on loan from <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-city-fc">City</a> in August but has so far struggled for regular football, and the arrival of Wayne Rooney at Pride Park only lengthens the queue for the first team.</p>
      <p>It means that both player and club may agree to cut their losses in January to facilitate an early return to <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-city-fc">the Robins.</a></p>
      <p>Here are what fans of <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-city-fc">the Robins </a>and the Rams have to say about the news.</p>
      <h3>Bristol City</h3>

        <b> </b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Breathe Robins: </b>Defo want him back. Offers that work rate from the bench. Has quality in him. Need to unlock it. Done reasonably well at Derby, albeit hasn’t had much game time.</p>
      <p><b>Sam: </b>Weird that we let him go in the first place in my opinion.</p>
      <p><b>Matt Street: </b>Runs into culdesacs. Not much end product. No thanks. If he played the ball quicker. Maybe.</p>
      <p><b>Matt: </b>Good decision in my opinion, he’s been doing alright for Derby.</p>
      <p><b>Kingswood Red: </b>Not good enough before and still not good enough. We have better midfielders now than what he was competing with.</p>
      <p><b>Max Rawlings: </b>Would have him in the squad!! Proven Championship quality and maybe give Szmodics a chance to go out on loan and get some football!!</p>
      <p><b>Chris Hall: </b>A lot needs to move on. With Nagy, Brownhill, Massengo, Korey, Szmodics and Palmer already as our centre midfield options and now Paterson coming back. And with Morrell signing a contract and Walsh still at Coventry.</p>
      <p><b>Keith Farrow: </b>Personally, I rate him higher than COD.</p>
      <p><b>Edward Waddell: </b>Thank god. No idea why he was allowed to leave in the first place.</p>
      <p><b>Tom Fielding: </b>It was a bit of a strange move in the first place given his connections with Forest. Not surprised it hasn’t worked out.</p>

      <p><b>Andy Buckley-Taylor:</b> So Paterson is going back, can we send Dowell back too?</p>
      <p><b>Danny:</b> We must be getting someone in then.</p>
      <p><b>Joel Moore:</b> Would be very strange. I've really liked him when he's played. Has made much more of an impact for us than PL loanee Dowell, and we missed him against Forest</p>
      <p><b>Matthew Jones:</b> Need to terminate all the loans depending on Clarke’s injury. They are a waste of wages at the moment. We have an academy that are Champions of England!</p>
      <p><b>Mr Sifter:</b> Makes sense. We can’t afford any passengers.</p>
      <p><b>Stephen:</b> Don't think that would be a terrible idea. We certainly need better.</p>
      <p><b>Jimmy:</b> Sack him off. Sack Dowell off. Get Rooney in. Get Jordan Ibe in. Get promoted.</p>
