      <p>A police officer reportedly forced a driver to pull over and remove a 'bollocks to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brexit">Brexit</a> ' sign from his car.</p>
      <p>Peter Cook, a passenger in the yellow Mini Cooper, said the officer pulled them over on the M25 near Brentwood on Sunday.</p>
      <p>He described the officer as "extremely aggressive" during the 40 minute ordeal.</p>
      <p>Peter said: "He said it (the slogan) was a public order offence, he insisted we remove the signage on the hard shoulder of the M25.</p>
      <p>He said the policeman shouted at him and the driver during the 40 minutes they were pulled over and "bullied" them into removing part of the slogan, reports the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-essex-50544243?ns_source=twitter&amp;ns_campaign=bbc_england&amp;ns_linkname=english_regions&amp;ns_mchannel=social">BBC</a> .</p>

      <p>After the car was pulled over Peter said they moved to Brentwood Services after he dialled 999 fearing for their safety.</p>
      <p>From there, they were made to peel some of the wording off before the police man allowed them to drive away with no further action taken.</p>
      <p>Mr Cook said the policeman had been "bang out of order" slammed his "atrocious behaviour".</p>
      <p>He also said he would be making a complaint to the Police Complaints Commission.</p>

      <p>In 1977, Nottingham Magistrates' Court ruled "bollocks" was not an obscene word during the case of a record store manager who had been arrested for displaying the Sex Pistols' debut album Never Mind The Bollocks, Here's The Sex Pistols.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for Essex Police said: "We are trying to identify the officer from the video footage to establish the circumstances around what happened.</p>
      <p>"In the meantime, we would encourage the driver to get in touch with us."</p>
