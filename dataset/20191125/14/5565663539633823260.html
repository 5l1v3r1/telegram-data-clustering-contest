      <p>Exiled Professor Jonathan Moyo wanted to be ZANU PF Secretary for Administration in 2014 after the removal of Joice Mujuru National Patriotic Front Spokesperson Jealousy Mawarire has alleged. <br/><br/>Said Mawarire, "Zanu-PF collapsed becauseÂ  of Professor Jonathan Moyo through his unbridled quest for kingmaking. He hounded out JTR Mujuru out of the party hoping to be rewarded with Sec for Admin post. When he didn't, he waged war with ED, thru G40 resulting in the birth of Junta-PF, goodluck and MDC where he is now."<br/><br/>Mawarire was commenting after media proprietor Brighton Musonza had accused Mawarire of destroying the <a href="https://bulawayo24.com/index-id-search-keyword-TysonWabantu.html">#TysonWabantu</a> project which is centred on getting Saviour Kasukuwere to come back and lead ZANU PF.</p>

      <p>"Is the G40 project collapsing before it sees the day? The likes of Jonathan Moyo and Patrick Zhuwao are distancing themselves from it because they are enjoying the temporary sanctuary of the MDC. What now for Saviour and Walter Mzembi? Anything that Mawarire touches collapses."<br/><br/>Mawarire further distanced himself from the Kasukuwere project and said it is a peoples project.<br/><br/>I am not part of it, it is a people's movement hence the "wabantu" suffix. My difference with <br/><br/>Jonathan Moyo and Patrick Zhuwao is that am not fighting it or ridiculing it because am not central to its operationalization. Vanhu ngavabvumidzwe kuita zvavanoda no one owns anyone, simple!"<br/><br/>Moyo has not yet responded to the allegation.</p>
