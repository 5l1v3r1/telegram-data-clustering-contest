      <p>The owners of a dog who was trapped for twelve days down a 30-foot shaft on a building site in Bettystown says it's a miracle that the family pooch was found alive. Ten-year-old white Westie, Charlie was rescued last night by passersby who heard the yelps of the terrified terrier much to the shock of owners, Jennifer and Daniel Lynch who believed their cherished family pet who escaped for their home earlier this month had been killed. </p>
      <p>"He is friendly with a neighbour's dog and we thought initially he might have got out and gone there but sadly he didn't," said Daniel, " We looked everywhere for him but couldn't find him anywhere. We rang the council and they told us that a Westie similar to Charlie that had been found dead on the dunes in Bettystown Beach and was already buried so we thought that this must have been him," he added. </p>

      <p>"We had Charlie for nine years, he was a part of the family and we were devastated but had come to accept he was never coming back. We had packed up his toys and bed and put them away. Our six kids were heartbroken."</p>
      <p>Daniel has praised the quick-thinking community in Bettystown who rescued the brave pooch. </p>
      <p>"Yesterday I was shopping in Tesco and got a call to say that a dog resembling Charlie was found trapped in a nearby building site. A number of people came to help, they tied a skip bag to a rope and lowered it down. Charlie climbed into the bag and they pulled him out. I just arrived when it was all over to see him standing there, I couldn't believe it. He was covered in muck and sand but he seemed to be ok. </p>

      </p>
      <p>"We brought him to the vet to get him checked out. A few of his teeth had been knocked out and he has lost half his body weight so the vet is convinced he fell headfirst into the hole and was stuck there the entire 12 days. How he survived we will never know. It's a miracle. He's an older dog as well so we just can't figure how he managed to survive with no food or water.  He's a little warrior. </p>
      <p>"The kids had tears in their eyes when I arrived back with Charlie. We gave him a bath and he is being spoiled and cuddled at home now. We are thrilled to have him back.  We'd like to thank everyone who helped in the rescue. " </p>
