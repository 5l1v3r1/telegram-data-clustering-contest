        <b>Roz Purcell has been praised by followers after sharing a candid post on body confidence.</b>
      </p>
      <p>In a lengthy post accompanied by a picture, Purcell encouraged her followers not to obsess over their bodies and diet culture.</p>
      <p>The former Miss Universe has previously spoken about about suffering from a binge-eating disorder.</p>
      <p>Purcell shared the following message with the unfiltered picture.</p>
      <p>"I was not born to diet my way through life and then die ~ something I had to remind myself of last night when I felt kind of down.</p>
      <p>"Coming into a day where usually I would have felt the need to feed my negative image of myself by restricting, over training and putting myself down. NOT TODAY.</p>
      <p>"I have spent far too many years tied up in diet culture. Today's #contentcontent is a bit different but it's probably more honest to what I felt like I needed myself last night &amp; I'm posting unusually early to catch any of ye who are feeling sh*t about your body today.</p>
      <p>"**ck it, don't be Dick to yourslef, don't restrict your food today, don't punish yourself &amp; let's not waste our time on something so irrelevant to WHO WE ARE."</p>

      <p>A second added: "Thank you for sharing this and making me and so many others feel normal!!!!  All our bodies are so amazing!"</p>
