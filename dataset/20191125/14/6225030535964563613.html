      <p>While the older horse division appears depleted, the current 3-year-old crop poised to join those ranks year has showed promise lately, with returning division leaders such as Maximum Security and Code of Honor to be joined by some talented late developers.</p>
      <p>Here, we'll look at four sophomores who won recently and should be positioned to make more noise soon.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.horseracingnation.com/horse/Bodexpress">Bodexpress</a>
      </p>
      <p>After losing his first seven starts, with the streak culminating with those antics at the start of the Preakness Stakes, Bodexpress took a break until an Oct. 14 maiden at Gulfstream Park West. He won easily by three lengths over a soft field.</p>
      <p>Next, Bodexpress stepped up to an allowance race over the same track. This time, the field contained notable names in Moretti and Union's Destiny.</p>
      <p>Moretti won a maiden race at Aqueduct impressively last December before finishing sixth in the Withers Stakes (G3). Union's Destiny ran sixth in the Fountain of Youth Stakes (G2) and seventh in the Florida Derby, but experienced trouble. On paper, he seemed like a late developer.</p>
      <p>Bodexpress blew the field away, though, by 6 3/4 lengths. He won under a vigorous hand ride, while the others spun their wheels.</p>
      <p>Bodexpress earned a 111 TimeformUS Speed Figure, adjusted from a raw 115 because of the slow pace. It is notable that Bodexpress earned an unadjusted 116 when second to Maximum Security in the Florida Derby (G1), too.</p>
      <p>Given normal growth and maturity, Bodexpress should become even faster next year as a 4-year-old. He is ready for Grade 1 races.</p>

        <b>
          <a href="https://www.horseracingnation.com/horse/Gun_It_1">Gun It</a>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>He returned off a layoff to win an allowance race last week at Churchill Downs by 5 3/4 lengths over a somewhat suspect field.</p>
      <p>Previously, this $2.2 million yearling purchase showed some promise in winning a maiden race at Fair Grounds by 4 1/4 lengths last December. But he went in a downward cycle from there, finishing a disappointing third to Owendale in an optional claimer and then 12th by 17 ¼ lengths in the Risen Star Stakes (G2).</p>
      <p>After another off-the-board finish at Keeneland in April, Gun It went on his break.</p>
      <p>For his comeback victory, Gun It only earned a 110 TimeformUS Speed Figure, with an unadjusted number of 112. Those are slightly lower than Bodexpress, but Gun It is capable of building upon his return.</p>
      <p>Notice he stalked the pace this time, whereas he faded after setting the pace in the Risen Star. And once into the stretch, he continued to run greenly, cocking his head to the stand side of the course. How fast can Gun It be if he runs straight?</p>

          <a href="https://www.horseracingnation.com/horse/Complexity_2">Complexity</a>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Similar to others mentioned already, he won his return race in an optional claimer after a stalking trip over seven furlongs. Complexity was much the best in his Aqueduct flight, winning by 7 1/4 lengths when geared down.</p>
      <p>For the win, Complexity earned a 121 TimeformUS Speed Figure, adjusted upwards from a raw 119.</p>
      <p>This horse is a bit of a different example than those previous. He'd already tried to come back once as a 3-year-old, folding to finish 11th in the Woody Stephens (G1) last June. But a year ago, he looked like a future star when winning Belmont's Champagne (G1) around one turn before fading to 10th in his two-turn debut in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile.</p>
      <p>Complexity is obviously talented, although limited in distance. Pointing to a race such as the Malibu (G1) on Dec. 26 at Santa Anita would suit him.</p>

        </b>
      </p>
      <p>He also hinted at some stamina problems when fading to third in the Curlin Stakes and folding to 11th in the Travers Stakes (G1).</p>
      <p>Previously, Looking at Bikinis won his first two starts over one turn at Belmont with a quick turn of foot. In his second start in an optional claimer, he beat a quality field including stakes winner Not That Brady.</p>
      <p>With those races in mind, it is not surprising Looking at Bikinis returned to his old form in a seven-furlong Oct. 4 allowance at Keeneland, winning by 4 ½ lengths form midpack. He earned a 115 TimeformUS Speed Figure, which matches the unadjusted number. It brought him closer to his second start.</p>
      <p>Like Complexity, Looking at Bikinis is a player in the one-turn miler division, with the Cigar Mile (G1) on Dec. 7 at Aqueduct his next target.</p>
