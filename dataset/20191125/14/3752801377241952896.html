      <p>The search for three missing teenagers near a beach in Sea Point continued on Monday.</p>
      <p>The National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) said on Sunday they had received reports of four people in difficulty in the surf at Rocklands Beach, Sea Point.</p>
      <p>According to NSRI spokesperson Craig Lambinon, they were "friends who were caught in rip currents after entering the water to swim when a wave washed over them".</p>
      <p>"The four casualties who were originally in difficulty were an 18-year-old male from Burundi, a 16-year-old male from the Congo, a 15-year-old male from Burundi and a 15-year-old female from Congo," Lambinon said in a statement late on Sunday evening.</p>
      <p>Three surfers who had been surfing nearby were able to reach the 15-year-old from Burundi and put him onto one of their surfboards.</p>
      <p>"An NSRI rescue swimmer swam out from Rocklands beach and reached the surfers about 200m offshore and CPR efforts were commenced on the surfboard at sea on the teenager," said Lambinon.</p>
      <p>A sea rescue craft arrived shortly after and the 15-year-old, the three surfers and the NSRI rescue swimmer were brought to shore.</p>
      <p>Despite extensive advanced life support and CPR efforts, the boy was declared dead.</p>
