      <p>Trump is getting pardoned this Thanksgiving — by a historic New York inn.</p>
      <p>The Milleridge Inn on Long Island will pardon a turkey named Trump at a ceremony this week, it announced Monday.</p>
      <p>The gobbler bearing the same name as the commander in chief "will be spared this Thanksgiving holiday to spend the rest of his days on a turkey farm in Virginia, several miles from the White House," according to the inn.</p>
      <p>“Trump will be spared from getting his head chopped off and from any impeachment process as he is loved by everyone,” the inn's owner, Butch Yamali, said in a statement.</p>
      <p><a href="https://thehill.com/people/donald-trump">President Trump</a> and his namesake bird — which is described as a "red-orange headed turkey" — both share a June 14 birthday.</p>
      <p>Like the White House, the centuries-old inn has been hosting a turkey pardoning event for years.</p>
      <p>The president is poised to pardon a pair of turkeys this year in a Rose Garden ceremony on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Former President George H.W. Bush started the tradition of pardoning turkeys in 1989.</p>
