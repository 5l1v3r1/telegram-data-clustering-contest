      <p>Our economic and political elites want us to believe that once we get through the rough spot of the moment, it should be possible to revive the Lebanese Miracle economy. A more sober diagnostic is that the ongoing financial difficulties do not reflect a passing liquidity problem, but, instead, the sure signs of the bankruptcy of the post-civil-war model. These signs preceded the October 17 revolution and were actually its driver. How to transition to a new model, without killing the patient, should now be our central concern.Exports of goods and services in the past few years have been annually around $5 billion, and imports around $20 billion. The difference – which Lebanon needs to pay for all its imports - has been financed by external inflows of capital, largely into the country's banks, at the tune of 20% of GDP on average over the past two decades. Lebanon has become dependent on capital inflows like rentier-countries depend on oil sales, and like a heart depends on blood flow. But depositors count on their bank to invest their assets prudently. Instead, our banks have invested massively in public debt, and this ended up being a bad investment, as it is now clear that the economy will be unable to outgrow its debt burden. The Central Bank adopted a Ponzi-like scheme to attract more capital, but this too has run out of steam. New inflows into the system have now dried up - worse, bank depositors are looking for the exits. To continue with the medical metaphor, the sudden stop of capital inflows resembles a heart attack. To repair Lebanon's heart, it will be necessary to remove the fat blocking the arteries - in effect, to clean up the banks' balance sheets so they become solvent again, which will require the recapitalization of banks and the much-dreaded haircut on deposits. To keep heart attacks from recurring, there is also a need to stop producing so much fat, in other words, to normalize Lebanon's metabolism. The recurrent external deficits reflect an excess of spending over income. Not only the state, but also the business sector, and many households have been spending more than they earn, year after year. The country needs to consume less of its income and work harder. For consumption to rise over time, the country will need to invest its savings more judiciously. This requires, in turn, that Lebanon rebuild its productive capacities like a healthy body needs to build up solid muscles. Economic growth is now close to zero. This was partly due to external reasons. Tourism and exports were hit by political instability, and remittances are down with the region-wide fall in oil revenues. But instead of working harder to face the challenging environment, the old model has atrophied our muscles. The artificial rise in wealth has pushed up real wages, making foreign goods cheaper. Displaced from the tradable sectors, more youths had to seek employment abroad. Corruption and poor infrastructure have further increased the cost of doing business. To grow again, Lebanon's productive muscles need to be rebuilt.But there can be no healthy body in the absence of a well-functioning brain - a Polity where decisions about the country's future are made. The massive capital inflows have distorted the country's governance system. The borrowing spree has deepened inequality, producing an economic elite that earns high return on its capital without having to take risks and innovate, because of the high-interest rates policy. It has also allowed a sectarian political elite to get entrenched by building its legitimacy on patronage and clientelism, rather than on performance. The large rents that the political elites drew by milking the public sector, and an increasingly cronystic private sector, have allowed for the formation of an overgrown ruling coalition. This may have delivered some political stability in the midst of a chaotic region. But the coalition has been too unwieldy to be able to even collect garbage or provide electricity effectively, let alone to address the long-term national challenges facing the economy. Now that the regional chaos is subsiding, it is high time to come back to a more competitive political system where ruling parties are disciplined by an active opposition.To move forward effectively, it is essential that we first convince ourselves that the old model cannot be fixed. Its core functions have broken down. The banking sector will not be able to attract large external deposits anymore. Oil prices will not recover their earlier peaks. GCC jobs will not be as plentiful as in the past, and assistance from oil producers will be scarcer. The international community will not offer support if the system is not fixed. But more importantly, the public itself has now irreversibly rejected the old model. The street is denouncing loudly its sectarianism and corruption, its weak state, and its artificial economy.The revolutionaries in the street aspire to build their country rather than be forced to leave it. They believe that it is way below its potential and that they can do much better with their collective energy and skills. They want a state that serves society and business. They want performance to replace corruption, and meritocracy to replace connections. In addition to tourism and finance, they aspire to build a vibrant high-tech industry, an environmentally conscious agriculture, a cultural production powerhouse, and to connect in more synergetic ways with their successful diaspora. They want social justice, not rising inequality. What is increasingly clear, however, is that the Lebanese will inherit a country in near ruin - over-indebted, with an inefficient state, a weak banking sector, and an economy that no longer allows for the importation of even the basic necessities. The birth of the Third Republic will be painful, but revolutionaries rarely inherit a well-functioning country. The magnitude of the needed transition is similar to what Greece went through recently, and the danger along the current path resembles the present situation in Venezuela. It might take a decade before a full recovery is achieved if the full battery of reforms that are by now well known are implemented successfully. In the immediate future, the remaining reserves at the Central Bank need to be carefully rationed to protect the import of basic necessities until exports pick up. To smooth the transition, Lebanon also needs all the external help it can get. In the coming months, not only will private wealth go down as balance sheet losses are distributed, but incomes will also have to fall to constrain imports, and wages to increase exports. The main challenge will be to build up enough social cohesion to avoid getting locked in a destructive distributive fight. The real Lebanese miracle will come to life when the country, starting from a lower-income base, will get solidly onto a rising path that can increasingly fulfill its newly rediscovered creative potential.---<i><b>Ishac Diwan is a professor of economics at the Ecole Normale Supérieure in Paris. </b></i>Related Articles <a href="https://en.annahar.com/article/1069522-lebanons-labor-force-revolts">Lebanon's labor force revolts </a><a href="https://en.annahar.com/article/1066338-recovering-stolen-public-funds-a-priority-for-demonstrators"> Recovering stolen public funds, a priority for demonstrators</a></p>
