      <p>Bob Biswas was a breakout character in Sujoy Ghosh's 2012 thriller "Kahaani".</p>
      <p>Played by actor Saswata Chatterjee, Biswas was an LIC agent who moonlighted as a cold-blooded contract killer.</p>
      <p>However, it is not confirmed if "Bob Biswas" is a spin-off of the character though Sujoy is associated with both the films.</p>
      <p>Diya Annapurna Ghosh will direct the new project.</p>
      <p>Red Chillies announced the project, writing, "Nomoshkar", a hat-tip to Biswas' catchphrase, "Nomoshkar, ek minute," which he used before killing his target.</p>
      <p>Abhishek said he is looking forward to working in the film.</p>
