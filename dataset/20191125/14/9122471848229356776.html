      <h1>Tom Brady’s Message To People Thinking Patriots Get Refs Advantage</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T14:23:18+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 14:23</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>The New England Patriots topped the Dallas Cowboys at Gillette Stadium on Sunday evening, 13-9, in an ugly game affected by some nasty weather.</p>
      <p>There was some officiating controversy late in the game, as an embarrassing “tripping” penalty was called on the Cowboys’ game-winning attempting drive. The call was a massive one, as it came on third down and pushed Dallas back 10 yards. Jason Garrett’s team ended up not converting on 4th down, essentially sealing the win for New England.</p>
      <p>Tom Brady seemed to be OK with that call, of course. He did have a problem with something that happened on the Patriots’ ensuing drive, though.</p>
      <p>New England’s quarterback was upset his home clock operator didn’t run the clock out on his 4th down pass attempt. The clock stopped at 1 second, giving Dallas one final miracle attempt that was stopped easily.</p>
      <p>“I don’t know. I don’t know,” Brady said of the clock not running out. “I couldn’t figure it out. I’ve never seen that before. It was still up in the air when they stopped the clock, so I don’t know. Everyone says a Patriot gets advantages – I don’t know about that.”</p>

      <p>Sure thing, Tom.</p>
      <p>New England improved to 10-1 with the win on Sunday. Dallas, meanwhile, dropped to 6-5 and is just a game up on Philadelphia in the NFC East.</p>
