      <p>Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola is desperately in search of his third Champions League title since he left Barcelona in 2012.</p>
      <p>The Spaniard led the Catalans to European triumph in 2009 and 2011 before parting ways with the club one year after.</p>
      <p>He has however failed to achieve the feat seven years down the lane - with his three-year reign at Bayern Munich gone without an European glory.</p>
      <p>Guardiola joined the Citizens in 2016 and the best he has done was to get to the semifinal of the tournament on two ocassions.</p>

      <p>As it stands, the Reds have a better chance of winning the EPL for the first time in three decades as they currently rank top of the table with 37 points after 13 games - eight points ahead of City.</p>
      <p>While speaking at the Football Writers' Association northern branch awards on Sunday, Guardiola said the pair should hatch a plan.</p>
      <p>With both trophies on stage he joked: “<i>We really want this one (Champions League) and he (Klopp) really wants this one (Premier League), maybe we can swap</i>?”</p>
      <p>The Spaniard added that Liverpool's ability to grab late winners in games is getting him frustrated as the Merseyside outfit is gradually drifting towards EPL glory.</p>
