      <p>Last month I took a look at the rather fantastic SteelSeries Apex Pro Mechanical Gaming Keyboard, which you can check out <a href="https://www.eteknix.com/steelseries-apex-pro-mechanical-gaming-keyboard-review/">here</a>. It’s the flagship gaming keyboard from SteelSeries with their innovative OmniPoint switches. The downside was that it’s pretty darn expensive, so what’s going on a little further down the range? That’s where the Apex 7 comes into play. It’s still the same fantastic design and comes packed full of amazing features. However, it features a more traditional (and less expensive) mechanical switch rather than the more expensive OmniPoint switches.</p>

      <h3>SteelSeries Apex 7</h3>
      <p>I’m a big fan of SteelSeries gaming hardware, as they almost always slap an OLED display on their premium peripherals. The Apex 7 is no exception and features a built-in Smart Display to show you all kinds of cool in-game updates, stats and more. Plus, you get a fully mechanical keyboard, built-in multimedia functions, aluminium construction, and even a detachable magnetic wrist rest. That’s more than enough to compete with anything else in the premium keyboard market, so let’s dive in and take a closer look at what it has to offer!</p>
      <h3>Features</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>OLED Smart Display delivers information straight from games and apps</li>
        <li>Instant notifications from Discord, Tidal, and games</li>
        <li>Durable mechanical gaming switches</li>
        <li>Series 5000 Aircraft grade aluminium frame</li>
        <li>Detachable soft-touch magnetic wrist rest</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>OLED Smart Display</h3>
      <blockquote>“An integrated command centre displays useful information for adjusting settings, changing profiles, and seeing on-the-fly updates. Avoid tabbing out of what you’re doing, and instead let your keyboard show you the important details.” – SteelSeries</blockquote>

      <h3>Specifications</h3>
      <p>For in-depth specifications, please visit the official SteelSeries Apex 7 product page <a href="https://steelseries.com/gaming-keyboards/apex-7">here</a>.</p>

      <h3>What SteelSeries Had to Say</h3>
      <blockquote>“The Apex 7 keyboard has mechanical switches guaranteed for 50 million keypresses. Red switches are known for their consistently smooth movement from top to bottom without any bump, allowing for lightning-fast actuation. An integrated OLED smart display with on-board storage is your command centre for on-the-fly info from your game or discord and provides software-free customization for tweaking and saving your settings. An unbreakable aluminium alloy frame makes it a standout mechanical keyboard.”</blockquote>
      <h3>What’s in the Box?</h3>
      <p>The keyboard comes very nicely packaged in a durable and well-protected box. There’s also a plastic cover to help keep it free from dust and scratches.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191115_125651-880x660.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>The keyboard comes hard-wired with a heavy-duty USB cable, and the only other thing included is the wrist rest. It’s all just plug and play ready, but you’ll want the software suite download to update the keyboard and do your initial customisation.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191115_130356-880x548.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>The wrist rest looks fantastic with its soft matte rubber finish. Plus, there’s just a minimalistic SteelSeries logo stamped into the middle.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191115_130409-880x270.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>On the bottom, there are loads of soft rubber grips ensuring it’ll stay put. However, those two strong magnets on the back will help lock it very firmly to the keyboard too.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191115_130426-880x660.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>A Closer Look &amp; Performance</h3>
      <p>First impressions of the Apex 7 are those of deja-vu as it looks absolutely identical to the Apex Pro. Now, that’s not a bad thing, as this is actually the same keyboard series. The Apex Pro costs £200 because it features the OmniPoint switches, but at <i>just </i>£150 the Apex 7 features a more traditional mechanical switch. Can it really be £50 “worse” than the Pro? I very much doubt it.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191115_130513-880x660.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>The build quality hasn’t been compromised either. It’s still that same premium aluminium exterior with a lightly textured finish. It’s good a really robust feel to it and a sturdy weight too.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191115_130517-880x660.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>The added weight means that the keyboard feels nicely planted on your desktop too. You can really mash away at those keys and it doesn’t feel like it wants to slide around, flex or rattle at all.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191115_130532-880x660.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>Key Caps</h3>
      <p>I really like the keycaps they use too, as they feature a nice and large font. It’s very clear to read even with the RGB lighting off, which is nice. Of course, there’s per-key RGB lighting too, so you can throw out some colour too; I’ll show you that shortly.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191115_130539-880x660.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>Control</h3>
      <p>Just like the pro, you’ll find a bunch of built-in controls for the lighting and macros too. It’s all pretty straight forward stuff, but you’ll find all the more advanced stuff buried in the desktop software too.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191115_130543-880x660.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Down the bottom row, there’s the SteelSeries button, which is basically just the Fn-Shift button. You’ll need this for accessing the multimedia and lighting functions on the F-keys.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191115_130548-880x660.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>There are some presets already, but lighting, macros and other features can be set to the keyboards profiles. These are M1-M6 and allow you to quickly get what you need. You can configure it all through the software, but once done, the software can be closed and settings stored on the keyboard.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191115_130551-880x660.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Plus, you’ll be able to see the selected profile, game, volume and all other kinds of stuff on this display, so it’s not like you’re flying blind. However, as much as I love the OLED display, I really like the scroll wheel and programmable button here even more.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191115_130604-880x660.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>OLED</h3>
      <p>Despite using their own switches, the keycaps are still the usual X-point you’ll find on Cherry MX switches. That means that the keyboard will support custom caps should you desire them. That being said, the quality of the caps here are pretty high, and I’d be more than happy to keep the stock ones.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191115_130555-880x660.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>As you can see, the switches are branding SteelSeries, and do look pretty similar to any other “red” switch. They’re as good as anything you’ll find from Cherry too and feature a 2mm actuation point and are rated for 50 million keypresses.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191115_130707-880x660.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>Pass-Through</h3>
      <p>Around the back of the keyboard, there’s an extra USB port. This is perfect for hooking up a headset, mouse, or some other desktop peripheral. It’s not a high-power port though, so it’s not ideal for charging a phone or anything though.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191115_130733-880x660.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>RGB</p>
      <p>The keyboard has some of the most vibrant RGB lighting on the market. It’s easily configured through the desktop software too, where you can set per-key lighting effects. There are loads of transitions and effects built in too. While it’s not got anything better than the competition, it’ll hold its own against anything from Corsair, Logitech, Razer, etc.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191115_130858-880x660.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>The transitions are silky smooth and bursting with colour. Of course, if that’s all a bit much for you, you can set it to a single colour, turn the brightness down, or even them the lights off if you so desire. It looks great with the RGB on though, but it’s really up to you how you configure it.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191115_130900-880x660.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>One thing I do love, however, is how that aluminium top cover diffuses and reflects the light. It’s got a very warm and soft look to it that takes a lot of the harshness away from some of the stronger colours.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191115_130907-880x660.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>Gaming</h3>
      <p>When it comes down to it, there’s really not a lot to say about this keyboard. It’s a flagship mechanical gaming keyboard with red switches. To that end, it delivers blisteringly fast and smooth performance as one would expect in this price range. The keys are light and fast, and the 2mm actuation point means you can really fire away with confidence. From MOBA to FPS and beyond, it’s pretty much a jack of all trades. I’m sure some may prefer their blue switches or brown, but the reds are easily some the most versatile switch currently available. Well, other than OmniPoint, of course.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191115_130919-880x660.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>Comfort</h3>
      <p>The wrist rest is easily one of the most welcome additions though. Personally, I can’t use a keyboard without one these days, so it’s nice to see this included. It’s massive too, with a full-width and rather long design that can really accommodate my long hands.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191115_131010-880x660.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>It’s not padded, but the soft-touch coating does make it very comfortable to use. Plus, I think it makes the keyboard look even better too.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191115_131112-880x660.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>We’ve already seen this OLED on a bunch of other SteelSeries keyboards, but it’s also cool to see it return. It can be used to show game stats in CS:GO, display track information from Spotify and all other kinds of cool stuff. However, you’ll need the desktop software active for those features.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191115_130933-880x660.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>How Much Does it Cost?</h3>
      <p>The SteelSeries Apex 7 is available right now with an <a href="https://amzn.to/2Db9gLQ">MSRP of £169.99</a>, although I have seen it go as low as <a href="https://amzn.to/2Db9gLQ">£149.99 in some deals</a> here and there. In the US, it’s listed at just <a href="https://amzn.to/33bD7hK">$159.99</a>. It’s available in Blue, Brown and Red switches, as well as multiple layouts for American, English, French, German, Nordic and Turkish regions. Overall, there should be a model for everyone.</p>
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>It’s really like I’m seeing double this month, as this keyboard is basically identical to the SteelSeries Apex Pro I reviewed last month. That’s not a problem for you though, as the Apex Pro is a truly incredible looking and very well made keyboard. By design, the Apex 7 is equally well made and is more than competitive with the best any of their rivals have to offer. Of course, it bloody well needs to be brilliantly made, given the price tag is around £150+ as for that, only the best will do. As I said though, SteelSeries is right on the money, and you won’t be disappointed with quality here.</p>
      <h3>Performance</h3>
      <p>It’s every bit as good as one could hope for really. What’s interesting is that its raw performance isn’t all that unlike the more expensive Omnipoint switch model, the Apex Pro. They’re both linear switch gaming keyboards at the end of the day, and both superb at everything you throw at them. The difference is you can change the actuation point on the Pro model, but that may not be something that appeals to everyone’s needs, or even more so, their wallets.</p>
      <p>For those on Cherry switches, I can understand a lot of brand loyalty may be in play here. However, SteelSeries is one of the top keyboard brands at the moment and their red switches can hold their own all day long. I’d be stumped in a blind test even after the hundreds of Cherry keyboards I’ve tested over the years.</p>
      <h3>Added Value</h3>
      <p>SteelSeries knows that to stand out from all the other similar keyboards, they need something unique. Their RGB engine is every bit as flexible and colourful as the other top name brands. They have a macro engine, onboard profiles, multimedia control and more. So in that respect, they’re very competitive. The aluminium construction is sublime, and the USB pass-through is a welcome addition too. I guess the real unique features are the magnetic wrist rest and the stunning OLED display. Overall though, it’s a pretty complete package that any PC user and gamer can appreciate.</p>
