      <p>Two people who were found dead near popular Suncoast Beach in Durban last week could have been killed in a murder suicide, new police evidence suggests.</p>
      <p>Police spokesperson Brigadier Jay Naicker confirmed that post-mortem examinations were conducted on Chatsworth mother of three, Fathima Muhammad, 50, and 24-year-old Kresen Chandiah, also from the same area.</p>
      <p>Initially, a double murder case was opened, but the investigation has now changed.</p>
      <p>"Police are now investigating an inquest as well as a murder. This is as a result of evidence gathered during the course of the investigation as well as the post-mortem that was conducted last week," Naicker said.</p>
      <p>The two were found dead on the dunes of Suncoast Beach last week, much to the shock of local residents.</p>
      <p>The busy beach is a popular tourist destination which hundreds of thousands flock to at this time of the year.</p>
      <p>Police previously stated that they were investigating two charges of murder. Naicker said police were alerted to the deaths at around 16:00 last Monday.</p>
      <p>There were little signs of theft with just Muhammad's cellphone missing.</p>
      <p>Social media was abuzz when news of the deaths broke. Pictures of the scene which showed the bloody remains of the two went viral.</p>
      <p>The picture showed a knife in Chandiah's abdomen as he lay dead in the sand next to Muhammad.</p>
