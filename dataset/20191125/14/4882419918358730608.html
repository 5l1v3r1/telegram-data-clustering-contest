      <p>Paris Saint-Germain need to renew a lot of the players' contracts and need to prioritise who they deal with first. As is evident, first up is Kylian Mbappe but Neymar will not be second.</p>
      <p>According to Paris United, PSG assume that the Brazilian forward will not continue with the club beyond the end of this season. Therefore, they will not even offer an extension to his terms.</p>
      <p>Neymar's contract runs until 2022 and the French club had planned to renew their star player's terms. However, his reluctance to negotiate, followed by his push for a move to Barcelona in the summer, have seen talks cool down.</p>
      <p>They have cooled down so much, in fact, that sporting director Leonardo has decided not to waste more time making an effort to get him to change his mind.</p>
      <p>Neymar's now-famous words -- "everyone knew that I wanted to leave PSG -- in September made it clear that he was more out than in. His flirting with former club Barça was too much and they no longer want to waste time and money on him.</p>
      <p>Leonardo maintains a delicate relationship with Neymar, who believes the sporting director didn't make it easy for him to leave in the summer.</p>
      <p>It all means that PSG have more money in their budget when not comes to negotiating new deals for Mbappe and Marco Verratti, for example. As for Neymar, the soap opera is served ahead of next summer with a common objective: au revoir.</p>
