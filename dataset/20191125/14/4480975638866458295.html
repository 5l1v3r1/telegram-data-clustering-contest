      <p><a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/markets/commodities/metals/gold">Gold</a> edged lower through the early North-American session on Monday and dropped to near two-week lows, below the $1455 horizontal support in the last hour.</p>
      <p>The precious metal extended last week's pullback from the vicinity of the 100-day SMA and lost some additional ground on the first day of a new trading week. Improving global risk <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/sentiment">sentiment</a>, amid renewed US-China trade optimism, weighed on the commodity's safe-haven status and was seen as one of the key factors that could be attributed to the downtick for the fourth-consecutive session on Monday.</p>
      <h3>Weighed down by receding safe-haven demand</h3>
      <p>In the latest trade-related developments, the US President Donald Trump on Friday said that a deal with China was “potentially very close” and also indicated that he might not sign a bill passed by the Congress that supports Hong Kong. Adding to this, the US National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien told reporters over the weekend that a “phase one” US-China trade deal still appeared possible by the end of the year.</p>
      <p>Fading safe-haven demand was further evident from a modest intraday uptick in the US Treasury bond yields, which further collaborated towards driving flows away from the non-yielding yellow metal. Meanwhile, positive US bond yields helped the US dollar to stand tall near two-week tops and did little to provide any respite to the dollar-denominated commodity amid absent relevant market moving economic releases.</p>
      <p>It will now be interesting to see if the commodity is able to find any support at lower levels or the current pullback marks a near-term bearish breakdown, setting the stage for a slide back towards challenging monthly lows support near the $1445 region.</p>
