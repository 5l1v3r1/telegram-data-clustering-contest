        <li>Perry: ‘God’s used imperfect people all through history’</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Donald Trump met with ridicule when in August he claimed to be “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2019/aug/22/trump-says-he-is-the-chosen-one-to-take-on-china-video">the chosen one</a>”, his apparently messianic self-confidence clashing with a press corps sceptical of the sincerity of his own religious beliefs as well as his behaviour and record in office. He subsequently <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/24/donald-trump-chosen-one-messiah-china-joke">said he’d been joking</a>.</p>
      <p>But his energy secretary, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/rick-perry">Rick Perry</a>, thinks the president should take himself seriously.</p>
      <p>“God’s used imperfect people all through history,” Perry told the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUqNKpjxPTE">Fox News host Ed Henry</a> in a video clip widely shared on Monday. “King David wasn’t perfect, Saul wasn’t perfect, Solomon wasn’t perfect.</p>
      <p>“And I actually gave the president a little one-pager” – a possible reference to the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/01/americas-first-post-text-president/549794/">short and colourful briefing notes</a> Trump is reported to prefer – “on those Old Testament kings, about a month ago.</p>
      <p>“And I shared it with him, I said, ‘Mr President, I know there are people that say, y’know, ‘You said you were the chosen one.’ And, I said: ‘You were.’</p>
      <p>“I said, ‘If you’re a believing Christian, you understand God’s plan for the people who rule and judge over us on this planet and our government.’”</p>
      <p>Discussing the interview on air, Henry said Perry “thinks at this moment and this time, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> was sent by God to do great things”.<br/><br/>Henry said Perry also “pointed out to me he believes Barack Obama was sent by God as well, for that moment and that time”.</p>
      <p>The notion that Trump is a ruler of less-than-perfect Christian values sent to benefit the godly – <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQBIBjbpzoQ">a second King Cyrus</a>, perhaps – is common on the religious right.</p>
      <p>His <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/18/donald-trump-bible-reference-evangelicals-liberty-university">own religious commitment</a> seems questionable in the extreme but the thrice-married, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/18/trump-hope-hicks-stormy-daniels-michael-cohen-fbi">porn star- and Playmate-paying</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/04/of-course-he-said-it-billy-bush-counters-trumps-pussy-tape-claims">pussy-grabbing</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/06/trump-university-court-upholds-25m-settlement-to-give-students-money-back?ref=hvper.com">customer-defrauding</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2015/nov/26/donald-trump-appears-to-mock-disabled-reporter-video">disability-mocking</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/21/trump-race-charlottesville-democrats-ilhan-omar-2020">race-baiting</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/15/donald-trump-press-conference-far-right-defends-charlottesville">Nazi-sympathising</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/02/donald-trump-atlantic-city-casinos-taj-mahal-plaza-bankruptcy">oft-bankrupt</a>, impeachment-threatened president counts evangelical Christians as a key bloc of support.</p>
      <p>Perry, a former governor of Texas and candidate for the Republican presidential nomination who like other senior Trump aides has <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/23/politics/rick-perry-avoids-impeachment-questions/index.html">found himself under the shadow of the impeachment inquiry</a>, will step down as energy secretary in December.</p>
