      <p>BERLIN: Robbers made off with three priceless diamond sets from a state museum in Dresden, police and museum directors confirmed Monday, in what German media have described as the biggest art heist since World War Two.<br/>The thieves broke into the Green Vault at Dresden’s Royal Palace — home to around 4,000 precious objects made of ivory, gold, silver and jewels — after a power cut deactivated the alarm at dawn Monday.<br/>The stolen items included three “priceless” sets of diamonds, the director of Dresden’s state art collections Marion Ackermann told reporters at a press conference on Monday.<br/>Ackermann confirmed the sets included brilliant-cut diamonds which belonged to an 18th-century collection of jewelry assembled by the museum’s founder.<br/>“We are talking here about items of inestimable art historical and cultural-historical value,” she said but declined to give an exact estimate of the financial damages.<br/>“We cannot put an exact value on them because they are priceless.”<br/>Dirk Syndram, another director at the museum, said the sets amounted to “a kind of world heritage,” totalling about 100 jewelry items.<br/>Bild daily said the heist was “probably the biggest art theft since World War Two.”<br/>At dawn on Monday, a fire had broken out at an electrical panel nearby, deactivating the museum’s alarm as well as street lighting, police said, adding the investigations were ongoing to determine if there was a link to the robbery.<br/>Despite the power cut, a surveillance camera kept working and filmed two men breaking in.<br/>The thieves had smashed a window and cut through a fence before “approaching in a targeted manner a showcase, which they destroyed,” head of Dresden police Volker Lange said.<br/>Ackermann said she was “shocked by the brutality of the break-in.”<br/>Founded by Augustus the Strong, Elector of Saxony in 1723, the Green Vault is one of 12 museums which make up the famous Dresden State Art Collections.<br/>One of the oldest museums in Europe, the Green Vault holds treasures including a 63.8-centimeter figure of a Moor studded with emeralds and a 547.71-carat sapphire gifted by Tsar Peter I of Russia.<br/>The museum is now made up of two sections — a historic part and a new part.<br/>And its historic section, which contains around three-quarters of the museum’s treasures, was the one broken into on Monday.<br/>With a strict limit on the number of daily visitors, entrance to the historic vault can only be reserved in advance.<br/>Exhibits are arranged into nine rooms, including an ivory room, a silver gilt room and the central “Hall of Treasures.”<br/>One of its most valuable pieces, the green diamond, is currently on loan to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, where it is a headline attraction in the temporary exhibition “Making Marvels: Science and Splendor at the Courts of Europe.”<br/>After the Royal Palace suffered severe damage in World War Two, the Green Vault remained closed for decades before it was restored and re-opened in 2006.<br/>For Saxony’s state premier, the heist went beyond the value of the artefacts stolen.<br/>“The treasures that are found in the Green Vault and the Dresden Royal palace were hard-earned by the people of Saxony over many centuries,” Michael Kretschmer said.<br/>“One cannot understand the history of our country, our state without the Green Vault and Saxony’s State Art Collections.”<br/>In 2010, the museum hosted a meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and then president of the United States Barack Obama, on the latter’s first state visit to Germany.<br/>Monday’s theft is the second high-profile heist in Germany in recent years, after a 100-kilogramme (220-pound), 24-carat giant gold coin was stolen from Berlin’s Bode Museum in 2017.</p>
