      </p>
      <p>The country’s 16 Days of Activism campaign against Gender-based Violence kick-starts in grisly developments as popular fashion icon was left nursing a blue eye after 16 bouncers, allegedly sent out by the Russian husband- thronged her Cyward Close house, assaulting her, a minor child, two men in the house before ordering them to vacate the property.</p>
      <p>Priscilla Chigariro Gessen (38), the founder of Zimbabwe Fashion Week, is married to a Russian national- Allen Gussen.</p>

      <p>The two’s marriage is reported to have broken down sometime,<a href="https://www.herald.co.zw/model-stuck-in-russia-looters-pounce-on-properties/"> last year</a>. Consequently, Mr Gessen deserted the fashion mogul in Moscow after she gave birth to a baby girl before the child could acquire identity documents. In terms of the Russian laws, Chigariro could not leave Moscow until she acquired identity documents for the baby.</p>
      <p>While she was “entrapped” in Moscow, her estranged husband allegedly took advantage of her absence to sell the property. The matter came to light as Chariro was narrating her ordeal to the police, where she insists, the incident was engineered by her Russian husband whom she accuses of trying to force her out of their premises.</p>
      <aside>” Sixteen bouncers came here aboard two trucks and attacked us, and they did not spare my one-year-old child, and went on to attack my relatives………My life is in danger and these bouncers are baying for my blood, because they were paid money to help Gessen fight me”- Said Chigariro</aside>
      <p>In connection with the matter, two suspects have since been apprehended at Highlands Police Station and are expected to appear in court today.</p>
      <p>It is also reported, Mrs Gessen’s security has been beefed up as she has engaged a private armed security company for protection against any further attacks.</p>
