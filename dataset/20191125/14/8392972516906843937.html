      <h2>Kel groomed Paul Foreman when he was a teenager</h2>

      <p>It looks like the net is closing in on Kel in tonight's <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/">Coronation Street</a> (November 25 2019).</p>
      <p>In a preview for the episodes shared on the soap's official Twitter account, Kel has been arrested for the burglaries, but the police start questioning something else found in his apartment.</p>

      <p>Despite Kel's solicitor telling him that he should reply "no comment" to the questions, Kel completely denies knowing anything about the burglaries.</p>
      <p>When the police tell him they're sending an officer to search Kel's home, the security guard claims he's been set up and if any stolen objects are found at his place, they would have been planted there.</p>
      <p>But the officer quickly changes the subject and shows Kel a photo and asks if they're his Polaroids.</p>

      <p>Surprisingly Kel doesn't deny it and nods, knowing full well the photos belong to him.</p>
      <p>The paedophile begins to get nervous and the policeman tells him they're forensically searching the laptop found at his flat which belongs to Daniel.</p>
      <p>He then says to Kel: "I wonder what we'll find on yours?"</p>
      <p>Kel is clearly worried at what the police will find. Has he finally been caught?</p>
      <p>Viewers know Kel sexually abused Paul Foreman when he was a teenager.</p>

      <p>Kel, who was in a relationship with Paul's mum Bernie, <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/coronation-street-viewers-disgusted-as-kel-tries-to-justify-grooming/">groomed the young boy into believing they were in a relationship</a>.</p>
      <p>A couple of months ago, Kel got back in contact with Bernie and Gemma and he made his way back into their lives. But they had no idea what Kel had done to Paul.</p>
      <p>In Friday night's episodes (November 22 2019) Bernie and Gemma broke into Kel's house suspicious that he was behind the robbery at Daniel's flat.</p>

      </p>
      <p>But when they were searching his home, they were horrified to find not just Daniel's missing laptop, but inappropriate pictures of Paul and other young boys.</p>
      <p>They later asked Paul about the pictures and he told his mum and sister about Kel's abuse.</p>
      <p>Gemma pleaded with Paul to go to the police but he didn't want to go over what happened again.</p>
      <p>However, Bernie reported Kel to the police for burglaries and for the pictures. Will he finally go to prison for his disgusting crimes?</p>
