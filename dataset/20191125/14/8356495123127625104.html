      <p>Glass manufacturer Metro Performance Glass continues to be plagued by issues in its Australian business, as competition heats up at home.</p>
      <p>Its net profit for the six months to September fell 15 percent to $7.7 million.</p>
      <p>Revenue was down 3 percent to $136.7m, with underlying earnings down 6 percent to $14.5m.</p>
      <p>"Market competition has intensified in both countries with several glass processors having introduced new capacity to the market in the last 12 to 18 months," chief executive Simon Mander said.</p>
      <p>He said the Auckland housing market was soft and there has been a fall in commercial glazing.</p>
      <p>The company would continue restructuring its Australian operations to return the business to profitability.</p>
      <p>"Despite our best efforts, New South Wales has continued to be a loss-making business," Mander said.</p>
      <p>"While we continue to see long-term value and opportunity in the NSW market as the penetration of double glazing increases, this will take time.</p>
      <p>"Going forward, Sydney operations will be consolidated and focused on supplying double glazing to window manufacturers, with local production of non-window or processed glass being discontinued."</p>
      <p>The restructure would wipe $5m from its full year result, with underlying earnings now expected to be below the previous year, between $21m and $24m.</p>
