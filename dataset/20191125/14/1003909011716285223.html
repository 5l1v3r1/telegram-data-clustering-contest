      <h1>Parker: New leader and new art for a creative space</h1>

      <p>It’s hard to keep up with all that’s going on at cSPACE, but two significant recent happenings are worthy of celebrating. The first is the appointment of Deeter Schurig as the new president and CEO, and then we have the installation of its latest piece of public art — After Image — erected on the south-facing main entrance of the very successful social enterprise.</p>
      <p>Schurig joined cSPACE almost eight years ago as a project manager, served two years as facility design and operations manager, and earlier this year was made general manager.</p>
      <p>But his relationship with the building — which supports communities of artists, non-profits and entrepreneurs working at the creative edge of change — goes back quite a bit longer.</p>
      <p>Schurig had a passion for the world of theatre and moved to Toronto to take a degree at York University in theatre design. For 10 years, he was an actor, set designer and then teacher at the university. Following that, he freelanced across the country as a set designer, which brought him back to Calgary with Theatre Calgary and Alberta Theatre Projects.</p>
      <p>He says it was his interest in theatre and other disciplines that led him to then take an architectural course through the University of Calgary’s environmental design faculty. For his thesis project, he chose to study the adaptable use of historic buildings.</p>
      <p>He also lives very close to King Edward School — a building that at the time had been vacant and derelict for years, so he soon became involved in the idea of its redevelopment. Schurig was interested in the sandstone structure becoming a beneficial part of the neighbourhood and a possible home for the arts community, so he jointed the cSPACE development team at its feasibility stage in 2011.</p>
      <p>This year — 2019 — has been the facility’s first full year of operation, which has seen the opening of the west wing theatre and a full house of 40 tenants over four floors, ranging from artists using 200 square feet of space to its largest occupier, Alliance Francaise with its 2,000 square feet of office space.</p>
      <p>The well-equipped theatre that seats up to 138 people  is available for rental seven days a week, while the main building is a hive of activity where creative tenants are able to collaborate and socialize with each other, organize exhibitions of their work and hold workshops.</p>
      <p>The main floor is also home to the Calgary location of the Alberta Craft Council, which displays and sells works by more than 400 Alberta craft artists.</p>
      <p>Another popular community engagement piece at the building is the Farmers and Makers Market, held every Saturday in the wide corridors of all the floors.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the sculpture After Image is the result of an Alberta-wide competition that was won by a team of Calgary sculptors: Caitlind Brown, Wayne Garrett and Lane Shordee. They were also successful in being awarded the design for cSPACE’s Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow — a chandelier of 105 kinetic hour glasses. A third piece of public art is a four-storey mural called The Imaginarium, by Calgary artists Daniel J. Kirk and Katie Green.</p>
      <p>Schurig has the responsibilities of keeping operating costs down, leasing and negotiating occupancy rates, and organizing events and exhibitions for his tenants. But, he has a real joy in seeing the fulfillment of a dream to create a collaborative art centre out of an unused piece of Calgary history.</p>
      <p>***</p>
      <p>Wheel Estate — the peer-to-peer RV trailer rental platform founded in Calgary by husband and wife duo of Chad and Cherie Ball in 2017 — has been acquired by Ruckify, the world’s largest community rental marketplace. The platform allows qualified owners to rent their trailers to verified guests.</p>
      <p>The acquisition will provide Wheel Estate access to Ruckify’s entrepreneurial founders who took the company from a $0 to $20 billion market cap, and from 0 to more than 4,000 employees in under six years. Wheel Estate will continue to be operated by the Balls from their Calgary headquarters.</p>
