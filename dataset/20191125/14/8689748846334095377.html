      <p>TV presenter and marriage counsellor, Maame Yeboah Asiedu has disclosed that she has dedicated most of her time to ensure minters of the Gospel also have great time in bed.</p>
      <p>The former United Television (UTV) presenter who is currently with Multimedia Group, said the dedication of pastors towards God’s work becomes detrimental to their sexual prowess to some extent.</p>
      <p>To this end, she told Deloris Frimpong Manso aka Delay in an exclusive interview that she cannot sit down for pastors to lose the power in their manhood and that is why she sells different kinds of medicines aside her journalism career.</p>
      <p>She said, “I’ve been selling medicine for several years, my husband and I import them from abroad, some mainly for the consumption of men, I can’t sit down for men of God to lose the power in their manhood, they really need such power so they can concentrate on the work of God.”</p>
      <p>Typical of Delay, she also sought find out why Maame Yeboah Asiedu left Despite Group of Companies under a thick cloud trailed by rumours.</p>
      <p>Maame did not hold back at all and offered a tangible explanation: “When you are a visionary and you know where you are going, you will not be distracted by hearsays.</p>
      <p>Obviously, at that time I was at my peak, I was the biggest on that TV, so when I left people never expected it, so if I’ve left, people will want to find reasons why I left.</p>
      <p>They may even speculate and wonder if I was sacked or not but the bosses themselves and my colleagues there know I was not sacked. I left, I was not sacked, I resigned.”</p>
