They are mostly used by people who appreciate to do their everyday work with a fast performance. So a laptop for demographic like that should be just like the new Philbook Pro.</p>

      <h3>Design and Screen</h3>
      <p>If I had to describle <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000073796309.html"><u>XIDU Philbook Pro’</u></a>s design in one word, it would be amazing. This model has a high-quality WQHD anti- glare display, alongside with a 277.9mm*199.3mm*16.25mm dimension.</p>

      <p>Most importantly, the screen is exclusively generated by the Sharp Corporation with a LCD display of 11.6″ 2560*1440 IPS. The laptop is very thin and weightless (2.42lbs), which makes it the perfect deal for people who use their laptops pretty much every day. Another feature I should mention is the ability to switch between a laptop and a notebook.</p>
      <h3>Hardware</h3>
      <p>XIDU PhilBook Pro was desined with a good hardware. XIDU PhilBook Pro is provided with the Intel Apollo Lake J3355 as a CPU, with a top frequency of 2.5GHz, which is an overall good CPU, alongside with a 6GB of LPDDR3 Ram. The laptop is powered</p>
