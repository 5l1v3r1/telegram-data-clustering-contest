      <p>The group beat off bids from Shell, which joined with Dutch pension fund manager PGGM for its bid, and private equity firm KKR.</p>
      <p>Eneco said Mitsubishi’s group had “made the best offer for shareholders and all other stakeholders of Eneco, including employees.”</p>
      <p>The firm, which is owned by 44 Dutch municipalities, said it had been convinced by the Japanese group’s plans to let Eneco retain its corporate identity and strategy.</p>
      <p>Eneco’s chief financial officer Guido Dubbeld told reporters that the consortium were planning to invest €1bn in Eneco’s operations across the continent in the next three years.</p>
      <p>He said the investment would be made “mostly in the Netherlands, mostly in wind, somewhat less in solar.”</p>
      <p>In a statement, Mitsubishi chief executive Takeheiko Kakiuchi said: “Eneco fits perfectly with our current energy activities and offers us a platform from which to grow further in the European market.”</p>
      <p>The company already has a presence in the Dutch market with 400 megawatts of offshore wind power, which it will combine with Eneco’s operations.</p>
      <p>The decision to overlook Shell was a setback for the oil supermajor, which has plans to become a major power generator by 2030.</p>

      <p>In a statement, the company said it would “continue to look for opportunities in the energy transition.”</p>
