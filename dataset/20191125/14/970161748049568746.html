      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/lisa-armstrong/">Lisa Armstrong</a> is taking a break from all of the drama in her life by having a ‘me’ moment featuring a cigarette and downtime on her phone.</p>
      <p>The 43-year-old Strictly make-up artist and ex-wife of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/ant-mcpartlin/">Ant McPartlin</a>, was spotted on the streets of central London with a cigarette in hand and a Lucozade in the other.</p>
      <p>She wore a big black fur coat, with trousers and black heeled boots.</p>
      <p>In the photos, she appeared to light the cigarette and then start to peruse on her Louis Vuitton-covered phone, while taking occasional drags and scrolling along.</p>
      <p>Lisa then reached into her matching Louis Vuitton bag and pulled out a make-up bag.</p>
      <p>After, she grabbed her Lucozade and walked back into an office building in the heart of Soho.</p>
      <p>What a moment.</p>

      <p>The couple first announced they were filing for divorce in January last year, after 11 years of marriage.</p>

      <p>They officially divorced in October last year, but they’re still in the process of dividing up their assets.</p>
      <p>She recently hit out at people who <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/11/lisa-armstrong-slams-claims-31-million-divorce-settlement-ant-mcpartlin-not-enough-11077130/">claimed she thought £31million was not enough</a> in her divorce settlement.</p>

      <p>Someone on Twitter asked her: ‘How can 31million, not be enough for you?! It’s enough for both me and my family put together for life. Just sayin’.</p>
      <p>Lisa then responded: ‘Don’t believe the lies #justsaying’.</p>
      <p>Their lawyers are said to be preparing for a hearing in the High Court next year.</p>
      <p>It could mean intimate details of their marriage and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/06/ant-dec-didnt-think-return-tv-drink-driving-arrest-11049019/">Ant’s battle with drink and drug addiction</a> could be made public as Lisa feels he ‘got away with a lot’ after their split.</p>
