      <p>An eyewitness told Black Country Live: "There was a fan who was stretchered away from the game after being hit in the face by the ball.</p>
      <p>"He was in the Halfords Lane stand near the dug outs. A player belted the ball into the crowd during the second half and it hit him flush in the face. Physios from both teams attended and then paramedics arrived."</p>
      <p>Now, West Bromwich Albion are organising for the man to receive the responsible player's shirt for his trouble.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for West Bromwich Albion said: "He is fine and left the stadium as normal after being attended to. We are organising to get him Conor Townsend’s shirt for his trouble - it was Conor’s clearance that hit him in the face."</p>
      <p>A Spokesman for West Midlands Ambulance Service said: "During Saturday's game between West Bromwich Albion and Sheffield Wednesday a member of the crowd was struck in the face the by the ball.</p>
      <p>"He was assessed by ambulance staff who were already at the ground and thankfully hadn't suffered any significant injuries and was discharged at the scene."</p>
