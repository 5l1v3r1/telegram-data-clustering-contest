      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a>… Get Me Out Of Here! star <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/james-haskell/">James Haskell</a> was suspended from school for secretly setting up a camera to film his friend having sex with his 17-year-old girlfriend without her consent.</p>
      <p>The rugby star, who is married to Chloe Madeley, landed in the jungle last week and has gained fans thanks to his hands-on attitude in the camp – making him 12/1 to win the series.</p>
      <p>However, while Haskell, now 34, had <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/25/im-celebrity-fans-side-kate-garraway-james-haskell-chivalry-clash-11213386/">an argument over chivalry with </a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/kate-garraway/">Kate Garraway</a> in Sunday night’s show, he has a murky past due to an incident in his school days.</p>
      <p>James and his former Wasps teammate Paul Doran-Jones were suspended and expelled respectively from Wellington College in Crowthorne, Berkshire, in 2003 after they set up a camera to film Doran-Jones having sex with his girlfriend.</p>
      <p>Haskell, who was 18 at the time, came up with the idea to set up a camera in the cupboard of the dormitory where Doran-Jones, then 17, had sex with his 17-year-old girlfriend.</p>

      <p>The girl had no idea she was being filmed, and the video was shown to Haskell and Doran-Jones’ friends.</p>

      <p>In an Evening Standard report from the time, a pupil from the public school said: ‘Paul’s girlfriend had no idea, but found out – she was upset at first and then furious’, and said the lacrosse player ‘stormed round and grabbed the film’.</p>
      <p>The girl was suspended from Wellington College for breaking the school’s no-sex rule, while Haskell – who represented England at under-17, 18 and under-19 levels – was suspended and Doran-Jones was expelled.</p>

      <p>The pair went on to sit their A-levels and continued to have successful careers with the Wasps and England in rugby union.</p>
      <p>The story was covered when Haskell and Doran-Jones received their England call-ups, and both of them have alluded to the scandal in recent interviews.</p>
      <p>In a video for the Wasps Teammates series in 2017, Doran-Jones, now 34, asked his friend: ‘What job would you have if you weren’t a rugby player?’, with Haskell replying: ‘I’d like to think I’d be working in TV or film.’</p>
      <p>Doran-Jones quipped: ‘We’ve had a few dabbles in film’, and Haskell said: ‘We have, we dabbled in that early on.’</p>

      <p>And in an interview with JOE for their House Of Rugby series in March this year, Haskell and Doran-Jones called the incident ‘a stupid mistake’.</p>
      <p>Host Alex Payne joked: ‘I am legally obliged to inform you this evening that these cameras are not hidden and will be filming at all times’, with Haskell saying: ‘As if they’ve gone there! Early!’</p>

      <p>‘If we’d have had that technology, imagine what we’d have produced,’ Doran-Jones said, with the I’m A Celeb star saying: ‘Remote cameras? It’d have been the perfect crime.’</p>
      <p>Haskell said: ‘I wasn’t in the cupboard at all, which was bulls***. It was blown out proportion. But don’t let the truth get in the way of a good story.</p>
      <p>‘It did genuinely get blown massively, massively out of proportion. I had like 12 car-loads of press outside the house, front page of papers.</p>
      <p>‘We tried to set up a home video club and it just went horribly wrong’ – with Doran-Jones saying: ‘We got the wrong subject matter.’</p>

      <p>Admitting it was his idea to begin with, Haskell said: ‘It was a stupid mistake that we both regret, but the worst part of it was I was portrayed by a certain paper as having been like, involved, hidden away, doing stuff with it… it wasn’t the case.’</p>
      <p>Doran-Jones then claimed: ‘It was all willing-ish participants.’</p>
      <p>After a lengthy career which saw him play for Wasps, Stade Francais, Ricoh Black Rams, Highlanders and Northampton Saints as well as being called up for the Six Nations and the Lions, Haskell retired from professional rugby this year.</p>

      <p>In August, it was confirmed that he has signed with Bellator MMA as a heavyweight.</p>
