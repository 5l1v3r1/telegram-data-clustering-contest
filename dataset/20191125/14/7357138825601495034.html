      <h1>Amex App To Offer Mobile Restaurant Booking For Platinum Cardholders</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T14:00:22+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 14:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pymnts.com/author/pymnts/" target="_blank">PYMNTS</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.americanexpress.com/">American Express</a> has announced that it is launching a new restaurant booking tool in the Amex mobile app.</p>
      <p>The new feature will allow Platinum Card and Centurion members to search, book and manage reservations from more than 10,000 restaurants worldwide across the American Express Global Dining Collection, as well as partners <a href="https://www.bookatable.co.uk/">Bookatable</a> and <a href="https://sevenrooms.com/">SevenRooms</a>.</p>
      <p>The rollout comes after American Express <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/retail/2019/american-express-resy-acquisition/">acquired</a> the <a href="https://resy.com/?date=2019-11-24&amp;seats=2">Resy</a> reservation platform. Launched in 2014, <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/partnerships-acquisitions/2018/resy-reserve-acquisition-vs-opentable/">Resy </a>features a suite of table management, CRM and booking technology for restaurants. It comes with a consumer-facing reservation app and website. The platform works with roughly 4,000 restaurants in 10 countries and 154 U.S. cities, and seats more than 2.6 million diners a week.</p>
      <p>American Express Senior Vice President of Global Loyalty and Benefits Chris Cracchiolo said at the time, “Resy was created to both connect people who love dining out with new, notable and hard-to-get-into restaurants across the globe, as well as help restaurants’ businesses grow and thrive. Similarly, <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/payment-methods/2018/american-express-digital-payments-business-expenses/">American Express</a> has strong relationships with premium dining partners and restaurants across the globe, and provides our card members with access to incredible dining experiences through our exclusive benefits and programs.”</p>
      <p>In addition, the company also <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/partnerships-acquisitions/2019/amex-buys-japanese-restaurant-platform-pocket-concierge/:~:targetText=American%20Express%20has%20acquired%20Pocket,real%20time%20all%20over%20Japan.">acquired</a> Pocket Concierge, which allows users to search for and book more than 800 restaurants in real time all over Japan.</p>
      <p>“Our card members love to dine out, so we are always exploring ways to provide them with greater access to reservations across the globe,” Cracchiolo said in January. “Pocket Concierge’s reservation platform and extensive relationships with top Japanese restaurants provide us with a great opportunity to continue to enhance and expand upon the dining access we provide to our card members across the globe.”</p>
      <p>The new booking tool is available this month to a portion of Platinum Card Members, while over the coming months, the company plans to enhance the feature and make it available to the broader Platinum and Centurion Card Member base in early 2020.</p>
