        <b>Up to €1 billion worth of treasure has been stolen from a German museum, in a heist that’d make Danny Ocean sweat.</b>

      <p>Back in 2010, former museum director Martin Roth boasted that the Green Vault in Dresden was ‘as secure as Fort Knox’, fitted with ‘invisible’ security systems.</p>
      <p>However, after making a getaway with jewellery and diamonds worth millions, if not billions, police are calling it the largest art heist in postwar history – and the perpetrators are still on the run.</p>

      <p>The thieves reportedly targeted the vault’s jewellery collection in the gallery this morning, November 25, switching off the power supply at 5.00am and entering the building via a small corner window, as German tabloid <i><a href="https://www.bild.de/regional/dresden/dresden-aktuell/grossalarm-nach-angeblichem-ueberfall-milliarden-coup-im-gruenen-gewoelbe-66254972.bild.html">Bild</a></i> reports.</p>
      <p>While police are yet to confirm the exact monetary value, state interior minister Roland Woeller described the treasures as having ‘immeasurable worth’.</p>
      <p>
        <b>At a press conference, Woeller said: </b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>[The thieves] stole cultural treasures of immeasurable worth – that is not only the material worth but also the intangible worth to the state of Saxony, which is impossible to estimate.</blockquote>

      <p>Michael Kretschmer, the leader of Saxony, of which Dresden is the capital, echoed Woeller’s sentiments, saying that not just the gallery was robbed, but also the Saxonians.</p>

        <b>Kretschmer said: </b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>The treasures one can find there, as well as in the Residence Palace, have been collected by the people of Saxony over many centuries and are hard-won treasures. You cannot understand the history of our country, or the free state of Saxony without the Green Vault and the state art collections of Saxony.</blockquote>
      <p>It’s reported the thieves escaped in a saloon car – however, authorities are hoping surveillance cameras may have captured them, despite the electrical failure.</p>

      <p>At around 5.00am, local firefighters were called to extinguish a blaze at a nearby power distributor – authorities now suspect that could be connected to the heist.</p>

      <p>In a statement this morning, November 25, Saxony police said they were yet to identify a perpetrator, ‘nor have we yet made any arrests’.</p>

      <p>If the estimated value of €1bn is true, it would easily be the largest art theft in history, far surpassing the $500 million raid on the Gardner Museum in Boston nearly 30 years ago.</p>
      <p>Treasures stored in the Green Vault include a 3.8cm figure of a Moor studded with emeralds, as well as a 648-carat sapphire – a royal gift from Russia’s Tsar Peter the Great.</p>
