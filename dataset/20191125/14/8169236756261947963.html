        <b>A Flamengo fan has tragically died at the age of just 40 after suffering a heart attack celebrating the club’s dramatic late Copa Libertadores final victory over River Plate.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Washington Vasconcelos was watching the game with his eight-year-old daughter before suffering the heart attack due to the emotional intensity of the situation.</p>

      <p>It’s claimed that Washington exercised regularly and was in apparently good health despite this tragic incident.</p>
      <p>He has been described by his family as a huge Flamengo fan, and doctors attempted to save him at hospital though they could not manage it.</p>
      <p>A family member said:  “He had a heart attack after Flamengo’s second goal. He was a huge Flamengo fan. Maybe it (the heart attack) was because of the emotion.”</p>
      <p>Gabriel Barbosa scored the dramatic goals needed to give Flamengo this huge win, but everyone associated with the Brazilian club will no doubt be deeply saddened by this news.</p>
