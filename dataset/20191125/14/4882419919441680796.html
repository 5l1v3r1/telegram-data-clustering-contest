      <h2>Leganes coach Javier Aguirre was not expecting Messi, Griezmann, Suarez AND Dembele</h2>

      <p>Leganes coach Javier Aguirre says he was caught cold by Ernesto Valverde's decision to field four attackers in Saturday's 2-1 win at Butarque.</p>
      <p>Valverde lined up with Antoine Griezmann, Lionel Messi, Ousmane Dembele and Luis Suarez, although his side still went in trailing by one goal at the break.</p>
      <p>However, second-half strikes from Luis Suarez and Arturo Vidal turned the game around and earned the Catalans a hard-fought three points in Madrid.</p>
      <p>"Ernesto surprised me with the four attackers," Aguirre told El Chiringuito. "It's scary on paper. I wasn't expecting it. My concern was where Messi was going to play. With the four upfront and (full-backs Moussa) Wague and (Junior) Firpo, they were attacking with six players."</p>
      <p>Aguirre also spoke about the Gareth Bale controversy at Real Madrid: "I saw the thing with the flag and it wasn't a minor thing. It was a bad idea from the Welsh players to face off their friend against his club. I liked how Zidane dealt with it, though, taking away importance from the matter.</p>
      <p>"Bale is not stupid and neither is his agent. They know Real Madrid is Real Madrid and it's hard to leave through the back door, they should not try that."</p>
