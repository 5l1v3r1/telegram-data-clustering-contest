      <p>Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam said on Monday that she will "listen to the opinions of members of the public humbly and seriously reflect", after pro-democracy achieved a landslide victory in the District Council elections. Lam said the government respects the results and wished "the peaceful, safe and orderly situation to continue".</p>
      <p>Democratic candidates secured almost 90% of 452 district council seats in Sunday's poll and gained control of 17 out of the citiyâ€™s 18 district councils. Before this election, pro-Beijing parties held the power in all but one of the councils.</p>

      <p>"Quite a few are of the view that the results reflect people's dissatisfaction with the current situation and the deep-seated problems in society," Lam said.</p>
      <p>The elections saw record turnout after six months of protests and brought upset wins for democrats against heavyweight pro-Beijing opponents, greeted in some voting centres by chants of "Liberate Hong Kong" and "Revolution Now".</p>
      <h3>Beijing backs Carrie Lam</h3>
      <p>When asked if the chief executive should consider her position in light of the election results, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Beijing "firmly supports"Lam's leadership.</p>
      <p>Hong Kong's most urgent task was to restore order and stop the violence, Geng told a daily press briefing.</p>
      <p>In self-ruled Taiwan, which China claims as its own, the Presidential Office expressed "great admiration and support" for the election result.</p>
      <p>"The election fully demonstrates Hong Kong people's absolute will to pursue freedom and democracy," it said. The number of seats held by the pro-democracy camp more than quadrupled and turnout, at 71%, was almost double the number inthe previous polls four years ago.</p>
      <p>Starry Lee, chairwoman of the city's largest pro-Beijing party, the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong, apologised for her party's performance.</p>
      <p>"For this major defeat, we do not want to find any excuses and reasons," said Lee. She said the party rejected her offer to resign earlier on Monday.</p>

      <h3>What is the impact of the election?</h3>
      <p>While district councils deal with local issues such as transport, recycling and recreation activities, their members also form part of the election committee for Hong Kong's chief executive.</p>
      <p>This could give them some influence over the next vote in 2022. The Chief Executive is elected by a 1,200-member election committee, that includes 117 chosen by district councillors. In this system, the winner takes it all: the group (pro-democracy) wins a majority of votes in the Disctric Council elections can claim all the 117 seats.</p>
      <p>Democratic Party chairman Wu Chi-wai described the election as the first step in the long way to full democracy. "This district election shows that the central government needs to face the demands of a democratic system," he said.</p>
      <p>Along with universal suffrage, the protesters' demands include an independent inquiry into perceived police brutality.</p>
      <p>The voting ended with no major disruptions across the city of 7.4 million people on a day that saw massive, though orderly, queues form outside voting centres.</p>
      <p>"This is the power of democracy. This is a democratic tsunami," said Tommy Cheung, a former student protest leader whowon a seat in the Yuen Long district close to China's border.</p>
