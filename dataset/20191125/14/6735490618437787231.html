      <p>Sebastian Stan and Christopher Plummer head up an ensemble cast in your first look at the military drama “The Last Full Measure”.</p>
      <p>Based on a true story, Stan stars as Pentagon investigator Scott Huffman, a man whose quest to award Airman William H. “Pits” Pitsenbarger the posthumous Medal of Honour, 53 years after his death. It is told through flashbacks of Pitsenbarger’s (Jeremy Irvine) time in the Vietnam War, where he saved the lives of 60 marines during the bloody Operation Abilene. As he meets with surviving veterans to get the full story, Huffman encounters a present-day cover-up investigation into the mission.</p>
