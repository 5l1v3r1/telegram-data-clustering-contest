      <p>It's hard to remember in recent years such a big gap between Barcelona's performances and results. Ernesto Valverde's side are top of La Liga and their Champions League group, but those positions should not camouflage the lack of football or the team's indifference.</p>
      <p>A shortage of self-criticism from the dressing room doesn't help. Starting with the coach. Even though is behind closed doors they are aware that something is not working this season.</p>
      <p>There's also concern higher up, with people at the club worried about some symptoms which are much more visible away from Camp Nou: Barça have a problem away from home in terms of performances and concentration. The numbers reveal the disconnect that exists: in the last seven games away from home in the league, they've conceded the first goal four times.</p>
      <p>It happened at Athletic Club (1-0, minute 89’), against Osasuna (2-2, 7’ y 80’), Granada (2-0, 2’ y 86’) and Leganes (1-2, 12’) in the most recent La Liga game.</p>
      <p>Of these four games, Barça have only won one, at Butarque on Saturday. But there's more: in these four games, Barça conceded the first goal within 15 minutes.</p>
      <p>In total, they have three wins, one draw and three defeats in seven league games on the road. That's 10 points from a possible 21. In the majority of those games, they've shown a lack of concentration and a dangerous habit: waiting for Lionel Messi to solve things. It did not happen at Butarque, where Arturo Vidal came to the rescue.</p>
      <p>Once again, from a set play, which has become an increasing trend: of the last seven goals scored, six have been from dead balls. It is positive that they've improved in that area, but highlights the lack of football being played by the team.</p>
      <p>"The sensations aren't good, we have to improve." The words of Vidal after the Leganes game, the only player that didn't give a result-based view on what happened at Butarque.</p>
      <p>Valverde started with four forwards in that game, his umpteenth attempt to agitate the team. Once again without results. The most attacking Barça side of the season failed to really worry La Liga's bottom side in the first half.</p>

      <h3>NO CLEAR STRUCTURE</h3>
      <p>This season we are seeing a much more interventionist version of Valverde. In his first two seasons, he had fewer resources and tried to stick to a fixed structure. Especially in the league, where he had to adjust to the traumatic departure of Neymar. Then, he went for a 4-4-2 and opted to stay solid. Ivan Rakitic, forgotten this season, played a key role.</p>
      <p>If in that first year the challenge was to overcome Ney's exit, in the second season it was to battle on without Andres Iniesta. Valverde turned back to the classic 4-3-3 (in the majority of games), with measured rotations, above all in three positions: right-back, the third central midfielder and on the left-wing.</p>
      <p>The most significant movement was the alternating of Arthur and Vidal, two players with very different characteristics.</p>
      <p>However, the big battle was to get the best out of Philippe Coutinho. A situation which is similar to what we are now seeing with Antoine Griezmann. His evident lack of adaption is another of the big worries at the club.</p>
      <p>The French forward has not been able to combine with Messi, despite playing in all positions across the attack. After the game at Butarque, Valverde gave his players time off until Monday. Griezmann stayed in Madrid. So did Pique, suspended against Borussia Dortmund and busy with the David Cup.</p>
      <p>It's an image which underlines the lack of order and concentration. Barça aren't improving, they remain slumped on the couch.</p>
