      <p>A jury panel has been selected to try a teenager for the murder of a 14-year-old boy from <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/arnold">Arnold</a>.</p>
      <p>Jaden Moodie was fatally injured in Bickley Road, Leyton, east London, on January 8. The former <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/education">Redhill Academy</a> student had moved to London six months previously to be closer to his grandmother.</p>
      <p>Ayoub Majdouline, 19, from Wembley, north London, faces trial at the Old Bailey charged with Jaden's murder and possession of a knife.</p>
      <p>On Monday, prosecutor Oliver Glasgow QC told potential jurors: "The allegation in this case concerns the murder of a 14-year-old boy, Jaden Moodie.</p>
      <p>"The incident took place on January 8 this year in Bickley Road, Leyton in E10."</p>
      <p>After being selected, Judge Richard Marks QC sent the jury panel away until Wednesday morning when Mr Glasgow is expected to open the case for the prosecution.</p>
      <p>The defendant has denied the charges against him.</p>
