      <h2>Brendan Rodgers' Leicester side reeled off their sixth straight win in all competitions with 2-0 win at Brighton on Saturday</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T14:40:30+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 14:40</time> by <a rel="author">James Nursey, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/james-nursey/</a></address>
      <p>James Maddison reckons Leicester have title-winning momentum.</p>
      <p>Brendan Rodgers' Foxes reeled off their sixth straight win in all competitions with 2-0 win at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brighton-and-hove-albion-fc">Brighton</a> on Saturday.</p>
      <p>It was their ninth win in the Premier League this season and fifth in a row to stay second behind leaders <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> .</p>
      <p>The last time <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> bagged five successive wins was under Claudio Ranieri in 2015-16 when they famously went on to win the league.</p>
      <p>And City's England ace Maddison admits they are riding a wave ahead of struggling Everton's visit on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Maddison said: “Momentum is such a key thing, that’s why teams always win titles and they’re right up there.</p>

      <p>“They always go through spells where the momentum is with them, they take advantage of that and they get wins in consecutive games like we’re doing at the minute.</p>
      <p>“If we want to be considered a top team, we have to keep doing that.</p>
      <p>"We know that we’re not going to take our foot off the gas because every game is a tough game in this league.</p>
      <p>“We’ll get back to the training pitch and we’ll keep working hard to try and stay up there.”</p>

      <p>Jamie Vardy scored his 12th of the season at Brighton where Maddison also impressed.</p>
      <p>Maddison didn't net on his 23rd birthday but can still boast four goals and made two assists in 12 top-flight appearances this season.</p>
      <p>He added: “Away from home, it’s always tough to get three points at any place in this division, and I think we came away as deserved winners. It’s the best birthday present I could ask for.</p>
      <p>“We had to grind through a little stage at the start of the second half and the end of the first half, but I think we came out as deserved winners.”</p>
