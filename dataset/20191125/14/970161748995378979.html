      <p>Adorable video footage captures the moment a baby seal was unable to stay awake after an exhausting day of being rescued and posing for photos.</p>
      <p>The five month-old seal, now named Santos, sparked a rescue attempt after flapping his way into a parking garage in Redwood, near San Francisco, on Sunday morning.</p>
      <p>Firefighters were soon on the scene to rescue Santos from danger, then took him back to the safety of their station.</p>
      <p>And once there Santos was happy to play with a rope for some photos, with video footage showing the baby sealâ€™s obvious enthusiasm for the game.</p>
      <p>But being a model can be tough work, with Santos filmed struggling to stay awake shortly afterwards, and eventually falling asleep,<a href="https://www.wpbf.com/article/redwood-city-firefighters-rescue-santos-sea-lion/29936950"> KCRA</a> reported.</p>

      <p>Santos was later picked up by the Marine Mammal Center, and taken to their facility in Sausalito, just across the Golden Gate Bridge.</p>
      <p>He will be monitored to ensure he is in good health, before being released back into the wild.</p>
