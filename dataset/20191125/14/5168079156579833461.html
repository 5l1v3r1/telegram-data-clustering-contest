      <p>Torrential rains struck northern Italy and southern France over the weekend, killing at least four people and bringing a new wave of flooding to Venice.<br/><br/>A 30-meter (100-foot) section of highway caved in near a viaduct close to the flooded Italian coastal city of Savona, leaving cars stranded on the precipice of the remaining stretch of road.<br/><br/>Emergency services and sniffer dogs were deployed to find potential victims but, as yet, none had been found.<br/><br/>In the northern Italian region of Piedmont, a 52-year-old woman who had been missing after her vehicle was swept away after a river's banks burst, was found dead on Sunday. Italian media stated that two other people in the car had managed to escape in time.</p>
      <p>Evacuations in Italy, 2 dead in France<br/><br/>In Alessandria, located between Turin and Milan, 200 citizens were evacuated.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Around 500 citizens were also evacuated in the Aosta Valley, where roads were closed because of a fear of potential avalanches.<br/><br/>Venice once more suffered floods, though the levels were lower than those experienced earlier this month, when the Italian city suffered record-breaking water levels.<br/><br/>In France, two people were killed and one was missing after floodwaters swamped cars and turned roads into rivers.</p>
