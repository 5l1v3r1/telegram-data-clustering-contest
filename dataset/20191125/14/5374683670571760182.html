      <p>The Tel Aviv District Court has ruled that Iberia Airlines must pay a passenger nearly $3,000 for a delay in his suitcase's arrival.</p>
      <p>After hearing the case, the judge ruled the airline pay the passenger a total of 10,000 NIS ($2,889).</p>
      <p>"One day after the passengers left Israel, Iberia knew where the suitcase had disappeared to," <i>Channel 12 </i>quoted the court as saying.</p>
      <p>"However, the airline did not do its proper diligence in order to return the suitcase to the plaintiffs with the proper speed, and the suitcase was only returned many days later."</p>
