      <h1>Robert Plant Considers ‘Awkward, Impossible’ Space Shifters Album</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T14:25:37+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 14:25</time> by <a rel="author">Martin Kielty</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/robert-plant/">Robert Plant </a>considered the challenges of working on a third album with his band the Sensational Space Shifters, but remained confident it would happen.</p>
      <p>Speaking in the latest episode of his <i>Digging Deep</i> podcast, which you can hear below, Plant explained why attempting to apply a formula to the group’s creative process would fail following the achievements of 2014's <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/robert-plant-lullaby-and-ceaseless-roar/"><i>Lullaby and … The Ceaseless Roar</i></a> and 2017's <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/robert-plant-carry-fire-album-review/"><i>Carry Fire</i></a>. “Each guy in our cooperative creates ideas and send them to me, or to each other. … There’s a lot of sketches,” Plant explained. “Some of them are black and white, some of them are going into color. And that’s how all these songs are developed.”</p>
      <p>He described the process as “pinning the donkey’s tail with a blindfold on and seeing what happens." "We have hundreds of hours of ideas, an unlimited amount of stuff that sounds amazing," he said. "We have to think about how we say the next thing, and how we craft that. These two collections of songs have been pretty [much] for us. It’s all about ‘for us.’”</p>
      <p>Plant argued that it might be “nice” to have a formula, but asked, "How good would that be? It wouldn’t be very good at all. We have to dance this kind of unusual two-step. All musicians are faced with the prospect of, where’s the awkward, the impossible third album? Where’s the impossible 23rd album? You have to find a groove and get started.”</p>

      <p>He noted that he wanted to “keep going in any form, but preferably with those guys,” but reflected that "everybody’s got their other stimuli. … It’s not as if the whole of everybody’s musical future is resting on whether or not we can find the next new song, because they’re probably gigging tonight somewhere!”</p>
      <p>The latest podcast episode centered on <i>Carry Fire</i>'s title track. “There’s no solution to this song," Plant said. "There’s no easement, there’s no way out.” He called the song “the sad thud of an old heart ... observations of a life and damage," while noting he still has a “romantic heart."</p>

      <h3>Robert Plant Albums Ranked</h3>

      </figure>
      <h4>14. 'Shaken n Stirred' (1985)</h4>
      <p>In retrospect, you can see this as the start of an experimental streak that shows up on albums that appear later on this list. But besides a handful of exceptions – like "Little by Little" (with that cool rhythm provided by Little Feat's Richie Hayward) – 'Shaken n Stirred' is more dense than listenable. As with Plant's debut, there just aren't enough good songs.</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>13. 'Pictures at Eleven' (1982)</h4>
      <p>Plant's overly sleek solo debut gets off to a fast start with the Zeppelin-ish "Burning Down One Side," but quickly loses focus. Too little of 'Pictures at Eleven' stands out. After playing the rock-god persona for so long, Plant tries to fashion another one here. But this is more jack-of-all-trades than the mastering of any particular style.</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>12. 'The Honeydrippers: Volume One' (1984)</h4>
      <p>Let's just say this EP – which features nostalgic updates of early rock and R&amp;B songs – wasn't what most fans were expecting when they heard Robert Plant was reuniting with Jimmy Page. Still, 'The Honeydrippers' ended up representing a key element of Plant's still-evolving solo career rather than a sudden detour. He wasn't finished reanimating songs from long ago.</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>11. 'Raising Sand' (2007)</h4>
      <p>Never mind the Grammy stuff, this album will always be more important than it was satisfying. T Bone Burnett's stripped-down production made everything sound lonesome and parched, while the material itself can be cloying. But working in that quiet space clearly gave Plant a chance to reevaluate his approach at the mic, opening the door for an era of far deeper vocal complexity.</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>10. 'Fate of Nations' (1993)</h4>
      <p>Often low-key, even wistful at times, 'Fate of Nations' requires multiple listens. Then the album reveals much as Plant takes a determinedly serious look at loss, politics, ecology and his past. You also get the first hint of what's to come on his next all-covers project with a take on Tim Hardin’s 'If I Were a Carpenter.'</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>9. 'Walking into Clarksdale' (1998)</h4>
      <p>As with their earlier live collaboration, 'No Quarter,' this Jimmy Page reunion includes moments that aspire to – and very nearly reach – summits Led Zeppelin once conquered. Plant is clearly interested in moving past that point, however, and there seems to be only so much creative spark left between him and his old partner.</p>

        <img src="https://townsquare.media/site/295/files/2015/08/PlantQ.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h4>8. 'Carry Fire' (2017)</h4>
      <p>'Carry Fire' features basically the same band – the Sensational Space Shifters – from 2014's 'Lullaby and ... the Ceaseless Roar,' as the typically restless Plant continues a period of stability. They create a similar sound too, blending musical styles from England, the U.S. and the Middle East. In this way, the album doesn't feel like any great leap forward – until you fully explore its deeply personal, determinedly topical, and yet far more hopeful themes.</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>7. 'Dreamland' (2002)</h4>
      <p>This album, like many covers projects, might have been seen as nothing more than a place-keeper, a water-treading, if passionate, project like the Honeydrippers. But his new band, Strange Sensation, excitedly blend Western and world music textures – the same textures that would propel Plant to some of his very best solo work in the years to come.</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>6. 'Lullaby and ... the Ceaseless Roar' (2014)</h4>
      <p>Working with an updated version of the multi-cultural band he'd been kicking around with for a decade or so, Plant continues to explore the outermost edges of his creativity. 'Lullaby' builds on a series of late-career triumphs, giving no quarter to his oldest fans’ built-in expectations, while pushing into a new place where textures from both West and East merge — a place of remarkable scope and delicious intrigue.</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>5. 'Now and Zen' (1988)</h4>
      <p>After years of building a varied, if occasionally unfocused, solo career, Plant finally seemed ready to embrace his past again. No previous solo album had so directly referenced Led Zeppelin, right down to the presence of Jimmy Page on two cuts. But the main strength of 'Now and Zen' is that it never sounds retro. (There's even a Zeppelin sample!) Fans responded in turn, making this Plant's top-selling solo project.</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>4. 'Band of Joy' (2010)</h4>
      <p>Led Zeppelin? Too soon. On this delightful, roots-rocking throwback, Plant goes further back, back to a world that existed before the one he created with Jimmy Page. Plant and new producer Buddy Miller are willing to scuff things up in ways the too-reserved 'Raising Sand' never would, and the album is better for it. Patty Griffin's heartfelt vocal contributions are better than Alison Krauss' too.</p>

        <img src="https://townsquare.media/site/295/files/2015/05/4-The-Principle-of-Moments-1983.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h4>3. 'The Principle of Moments' (1983)</h4>
      <p>Plant really didn't change his approach to things on his second solo album. As with 'Pictures at Eleven,' he's all over the place creatively, and he's still dabbling in that period's pristine pop sounds. But with standout moments like "Big Log," "Other Arms" and "In the Mood," Plant had finally found material that matched his outsized desire for something new.</p>

        <img src="https://townsquare.media/site/295/files/2015/05/3-Manic-Nirvana-1990.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h4>2. 'Manic Nirvana' (1990)</h4>
      <p>After hiding behind so many contemporary sounds, from keyboards to sampling, in the '80s, Plant finally was beginning to sound comfortable in his own skin. This album has every bit of the sex, humor and boundary-defying punch of Plant's best work, but with more determined rock focus than he had even on the popular, but deeply modern, 'Now and Zen.'</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>1. 'Mighty ReArranger' (2005)</h4>
      <p>Working again with the Strange Sensation, 'Mighty ReArranger' sounded like something John Lee Hooker would have played had the bluesman discovered Malian guitar style before hightailing it to Chicago. Plant had been mixing things up for years with Zeppelin, but there’s a forward-looking attitude — buoyed in part by Plant’s darkly focused and maturely cynical lyrics — that gives 'Mighty ReArranger' new sizzle.</p>
