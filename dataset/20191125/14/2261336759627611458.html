      <p>In case you’re out of the loop on the latest keyboard war, Jon Jones also got ‘ok boomered’ <a href="https://twitter.com/stylebender/status/1198378912859844608">trying to talk trash to Israel Adesanya over twitter. </a>This is AFTER the fight with Dominick Reyes was announced. What was this GOAT thinking? Are we supposed to get into the idea of this fight because it’s the “biggest” one possible at the moment. It ain’t. Jon Jones moving up to heavyweight is the big splash. I’m a little tired of watching Jones decision middleweights in 2020, at least in the past he had the courtesy to finish Lyoto, Chael, and Vitor.</p>

One thing I hate is when a joke gets beaten to death so this has no words, no “Super Necessary” or anything. You know the story, I hope this is something you can wear with pride for a long time. Thanks to everyone who checks out MMA Squared and my other artwork (book coming out early 2020)</p>
