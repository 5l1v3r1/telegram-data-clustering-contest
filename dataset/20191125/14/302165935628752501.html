      <p>PARIS, Nov 25 —The world’s second-richest man, Bernard Arnault, has built an unparallelled luxury empire that spans fashion to champagne, along with a reputation as a formidable and insatiable businessman.</p>
      <p>His latest acquisition, the US jeweller Tiffany, a brand immortalised in popular culture with the 1961 film “Breakfast at Tiffany’s” starring Audrey Hepburn, was announced as many Parisians were enjoying their morning coffee on Monday.</p>
      <p>The US$16.2 billion deal puts Arnault’s LVMH luxury conglomerate at the top in the fine jewellery segment, and reinforces its position as the biggest pure player in luxury over all.</p>
      <p>Slim and tall, Arnault didn’t begin his career in the luxury sector.</p>
      <p>Born in 1949 in the north of France, Arnault studied engineering at France’s premier Ecole Polytechnique university before joining his father’s construction and civil engineering company.</p>
      <p>Having convinced his father to sell the construction arm of the company and concentrate on real estate, Arnault soon embarked on his long career of buying up businesses.</p>
      <p>But not before he fled to the United States following the victory in 1981 for Francois Mitterrand’s Socialists, who had vowed to implement a wealth tax.</p>
      <p>He returned to France three years later and began his foray into the world of luxury by buying up the debt-ridden textile firm Boussac.</p>
      <p>Arnault beat out competitors by promising to maintain jobs at the firm, but quickly launched a restructuring that slashed employment and left it only a few activities including the fashion house Christian Dior.</p>
      <p>He emerged at the top of LVMH thanks to rivalries between the families which had owned leather goods maker Louis Vuitton and champagne and spirits group Moet-Hennessy, but only after 17 lawsuits.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Ruffling feathers</b>
      </p>
      <p>Kenzo, Guerlain, Fendi, Celine, Chaumet, Sephora, Bulgari... Over the years LVMH’s stable of luxury brands has continued to grow.</p>
      <p>Arnault’s business defeats have been few, but very public.</p>
      <p>He lost Italian fashion and leather goods house Gucci to his French rival Francois Pinault, head of the PPR group (now Kering), in 1999.</p>
      <p>He tried to take over Louis Vuitton’s French rival Hermes, known for its silk scarves and sumptuous leather handbags like the “Birkin,” by secretly building up a stake in the firm, for which he was fined eight million euros (US$8.8 million) by regulators.</p>
      <p>But the operation still netted Arnault a capital gain of €2.4 billion.</p>
      <p>Arnault’s sharp-elbowed business tactics have made him a target for criticism, in particular in a searing 2016 documentary by French journalist and leftist activist Francois Ruffin.</p>
      <p>The “Merci Patron” (Thanks boss) film is about a couple who lost their jobs when Arnault closed a factory manufacturing clothes for the luxurious Kenzo brand, outsourcing the work to Poland.</p>
      <p>Arnault’s response to the film, which he had not even seen, was unapologetic.</p>
      <p>“When I arrived at the head of the (LVMH) group we were 20,000 (employees) and now we’re 120,000; When it comes down to it, we epitomise the benefits of globalisation for France: it’s a complete catastrophe!” he said with more than a hint of irony.</p>
      <p>
        <b>‘Great builder’</b>
      </p>
      <p>Arnault also won few friends among the French when he expressed his desire to get duel French-Belgian nationality.</p>
      <p>He denied the move was aimed at avoiding a mooted 75 per cent tax on the wealthy, saying instead it was related to his desire to develop his business investments in Belgium.</p>
      <p>“He has an incredible sense of competition, a remarkable intelligence, as well as a lack of empathy in business that is the mark of great builders,” said Arnaud Cadart, a portfolio manager at the French asset manager Flornoy and Associates.</p>
      <p>“But he’s not a Howard Hughes, he said, referring to the American tycoon who became increasing solitary and erratic as he got older.</p>
      <p>“He’s not isolated and has always surrounded himself with the best people,” Cadart said. “He wants to be the best in all domains and he is also an ultra-modern manager who has introduced engineering methods to luxury.”</p>
      <p>Journalist Airy Routier was less kind in his unauthorised biography entitled “Terminator Angel,” which bestowed on him such sobriquets as “discreet predator”, “luxury Hussard”, “French raider” and “business wolf”.</p>
      <p>Arnault’s fortune has allowed him to indulge in one of his main passions: contemporary art.</p>
      <p>He opened in 2014 his futuristic Louis Vuitton Foundation, a Frank Gehry-designed structure of glass sails in the Bois de Boulogne forest to the west of Paris.</p>
      <p>Arnault never publicly revealed the building’s cost, but in December 2018, an anti-fraud advocacy group filed a lawsuit claiming taxpayers had unfairly paid much of an estimated 790 million euro bill.</p>
      <p>The foundation nonetheless contributed to his being awarded the David Rockefeller prize by the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 2014. — AFP</p>
