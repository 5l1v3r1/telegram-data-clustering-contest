      <h1>New Mercedes-Benz GLA: teaser image drops (along with initial details)…</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T14:22:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 14:22</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.carmag.co.za/author/ryanbubear/" target="_blank">Ryan Bubear</a></address>
      <p>Mercedes-Benz has released a shadowy teaser image of its new GLA ahead of the second-generation model’s reveal in December 2019.</p>
      <p>Set to arrive as the eighth model in the Stuttgart-based firm’s compact range, the new GLA will again serve as the entry point to the brand's growing SUV family, slotting in below the <a href="https://www.carmag.co.za/news/new-models/new-mercedes-benz-glb-revealed-with-optional-third-row/">new GLB</a>.</p>
      <p>Benz says the height of the new GLA exceeds that of its predecessor by more than 100 mm, explaining this allows a “higher, characteristic SUV seating position and more headroom in the first row”.</p>
      <p>The firm claims legroom in the rear is also “much more generous” than before, despite the fact the new model is some 15 mm shorter nose to tail. Expect the GLA to again feature short overhangs and plenty of protective cladding.</p>
      <p>Mercedes says the various functions of the driving assistance package have been expanded to include active brake assist, a cornering function, an emergency lane function, an exit warning function and a warning when pedestrians are detected near zebra crossings.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, the new GLA’s unveiling on 11 December 2019 will a purely digital world premiere, the first time Mercedes-Benz has taken such an approach.</p>
