      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T14:13:25+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 14:13</time> by <a rel="author">Kelly Ashmore, https://www.facebook.com/dudleybclive/</a></address>
      <p>Acorns Children’s Hospice is gearing up to host its biggest ever festive fundraiser - and an <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/erdington">Erdington</a> mum has revealed why signing up to the seasonal spectacular will make a real difference to families like hers.</p>
      <p>When Emma Barton found out she was pregnant with her first child, she dreamed of the moment she would finally meet her daughter.</p>
      <p>But when Esme was born, doctors quickly whisked away her away and Emma’s eagerly awaited first skin-to-skin moment was ‘ruined’.</p>
      <p>It wasn’t until her newborn was handed back to her with a feeding tube, that Emma realised there was a problem.</p>
      <p>Although she had been told Esme wasn’t hitting the key markers during her pregnancy, she never expected what was to come.</p>
      <p>“It wasn’t really explained to me," she said.</p>

      <p>"They could clearly see there were facial differences and she was born with hypothermia and hypoglycaemia. She was taken away straightaway.</p>
      <p>"It was all downplayed, but it was critical and there was me thinking our amazing skin-to-skin first moment was being spoilt.”</p>
      <p>The rollercoaster continued when doctors revealed Esme may have a chromosome condition and after an anxious six-week wait the diagnosis was confirmed as partial Trisomy 14. Tests also revealed that Esme had Cri-du-chat syndrome - a rare genetic disorder - and metabolic issues.</p>
      <p>“The first year was especially tough as she was ill a lot," the mum continued.</p>
      <p>"She had a lot of infections. Esme is my first child, so I had nothing to compare it to. Esme is profoundly disabled, and it affects all aspects of her life. She is dependent on care givers for absolutely everything.”</p>
      <p>Emma hadn’t been aware of <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/acorns-childrens-hospice">Acorns Children's Hospice</a> before Esme’s referral - and it took some time before she was ready to explore what Acorns could offer families like hers.</p>
      <p>“Acorns was initially mentioned to us when Esme was a baby. But at that time it just felt really fatalistic," she said.</p>
      <p>"Partly because it was accepting that her life would be over before it really started. I certainly wasn't ready for that.”</p>
      <p>The mum finally considered Acorns for support with Esme’s complex metabolic issues. And although she still had reservations and thought Esme, now 14, wouldn’t meet the criteria, she quickly realised the hospice helps lots of children with complex needs.</p>
      <p>“As soon as I walked into the hospice it was obvious that Acorns is about so much more than end of life care. It's about living, where all your preformed ideas are totally blown away. I didn't take any convincing. I just had to get to that stage of needing some support.</p>
      <p>“I'm grateful Esme has Acorns and I'm really impressed with the way Acorns has let her grow. Acorns is a place where Esme can come and have happy times and we can have valuable respite. It’s vital for that. Acorns is a real lifeline for the families it supports.”</p>

      <p>To continue to provide support to children like Esme, Acorns needs help from the public - and that's why people are being urged to sign up for one of the three Santa Runs being held across the West Midlands next month.</p>
      <p>Birmingham’s Millennium Point will start things off on Saturday, December 7, with <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/walsall">Walsall Arboretum</a> and The Valley, Evesham, following suit on Sunday, December 8.</p>
      <p>Santa Run tickets cost £15 for adults, £10 for children and £5 for dogs. Children under two go free.</p>
      <p>Tickets cover the cost of the event, but every penny raised in sponsorship goes directly to supporting local children and families.</p>
      <p>People who tak part will also get <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/black-country/free-entry-sea-life-centre-17074979">free entry to a host of visitor attractions, including National Sea Life Birmingham and Thinktank</a> .</p>
