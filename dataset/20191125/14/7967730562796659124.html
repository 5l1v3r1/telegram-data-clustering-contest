      <p>A former Sydney ferry master who was sacked for falling asleep on the job after taking cough medicine that caused drowsiness has lost his unfair dismissal application.</p>
      <p>The Fair Work Commission has found the dismissal of Nigel Sclater in April was fair after it heard he was found sleeping on duty as the master on the <i>May Gibbs</i>, formerly named Ferry McFerryface, while it was travelling between Pyrmont Bay and McMahon’s Point wharves.</p>

      <p>When the ferry arrived at Balmain East, Mr Sclater's manager boarded and entered the wheelhouse where he found the ship's engineer at the helm and Mr Sclater asleep on a small bench.</p>
      <p>Mr Sclater, who started working for Sydney Ferries in 1995 before his employment was transferred to Transdev Harbour City Ferries, provided evidence of a previously unblemished record.</p>
      <p>He told the commission he was taking four types of heart medication and had medical clearance to work as a ferry master. He said he caught a cold in March which left him with a persistent cough for which he bought some medicine.</p>
      <p>He said he notified his manager he was taking the cough mixture but did not read a warning on the box which said it may cause drowsiness and: "If affected do not drive a vehicle or operate machinery<i>"</i>. He took the cough mixture for more than a week without noticing any side effects, including fatigue.</p>
      <p>In evidence, he said he was in ultimate control of the ferry as its master but it was not uncommon to hand over control of ‘the sticks’ to other qualified crew, to allow for short breaks and for other staff to gain experience.</p>
      <p>After Mr Sclater drove the ferry from Circular Quay to Pyrmont Bay, arriving at 9am, he said he started to feel tired and sat down on the settee in the wheelhouse. The commission heard he closed his eyes and must have drifted off but believed he was only “absolutely unconscious” for about five minutes. When he awoke at around 9.34am he said he noticed his line manager in the wheelhouse and rose to his feet.</p>
      <p>Mr Sclater said the reason he became drowsy and fell asleep was a combination of his underlying illness, not having taken his morning heart medication and taking the cough mixture. His doctor also said he was particularly sensitive to codeine.</p>
      <p>In dismissing his unfair dismissal application, deputy president Geoffrey Bull said as the master, "he must remain alert and in control of the vessel at all times, which he failed to do".</p>
      <p>"On any account, having the master of a ferry asleep (without good reason) while on duty when providing a public transport service in Sydney Harbour cannot be countenanced," he said.</p>
