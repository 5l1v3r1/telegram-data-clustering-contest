      <p>Former Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) 170-pound title contender <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/108/nick-diaz">Nick Diaz</a>, who wore welterweight gold under the Strikeforce banner, could be making his return to mixed martial arts (MMA) in the very near future.</p>
      <p>Stop me if <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2014/6/23/5834196/report-nick-diaz-targeting-ufc-return-by-new-year-pending-contract-mma">you’ve heard this one before</a>.</p>
      <p>Diaz (26-9, 2 NC) has not competed since registering a “No Contest” opposite former middleweight champion <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/101/anderson-silva">Anderson Silva</a> way back in January 2015, after both fighters were <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2015/2/17/8056247/nsac-suspends-anderson-silva-nick-diaz-hector-lombard-pending-disciplinary-hearing-mma">fined and suspended</a> for flunking separate pre-fight drug tests.</p>
      <p>I guess Bellator MMA <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2018/12/10/18135163/ufc-nick-diaz-teases-move-bellator-after-being-lowballed-for-ufc-return-mma">wasn’t returning his calls</a>.</p>
      <p>“That’s really not my thing. I don’t want to hurt people,” Diaz said while turning down an offer to kick someone in the pills (via <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/11/25/20981376/video-nick-diaz-refuses-to-groin-kick-a-guy-for-money-reveals-hes-fighting-again-soon">Bloody Elbow</a>). “I could, but also, I don’t want to hurt myself. I’ve got big news coming up. I’m about to be fighting again soon.”</p>
      <p>Someone should probably tell <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2017/6/29/15894310/dana-white-say-goodbye-ronda-rousey-nick-diaz-never-coming-back-ufc-mma">this guy</a>.</p>
      <p>Diaz, 36, re-entered the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) testing program earlier this year and was recently calling for <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/ufc-244-results-stream-fight-card-start-time-date-predictions-odds-highlights-masvidal-diaz-mma/2019/11/13/20962928/nate-diaz-repays-bitchass-fan-who-lost-rent-money-ufc-244-bet-mma">a showdown against Jorge Masvidal</a>. Hopefully those pesky drug testers don’t interfere <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2017/8/4/16094426/nick-diaz-usada-stop-trying-drug-test-me-while-im-smoking-bunch-weed-mma">with his recurring pot parties</a>.</p>
      <p>It’s hard to say what version of Diaz fans should expect if and when he makes his return to the Octagon. His fighting style, not unlike the one he <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2012/5/5/3000510/ufc-on-fox-3-no-longer-just-nick-diazs-little-brother-nate-diaz-looks">passed down to his brother Nate</a>, isn’t the sort of thing you drill at typical MMA schools, so anything is possible.</p>
