      <p>Diminishing chances for international satellite operators for a windfall on US 5G spectrum holdings drove Intelsat (-47%), SES (-15%) and Eutelsat (-10%) down for a second straight week. The incumbent operators appear to be looking increasingly at spinning off networks and country operations into listed subsidiaries, including Deutsche Telekom, Orange and Telecom Italia/TIM. The Telecompaper European Telecom Services index was down 0.1 percent in week 47, against a loss of 0.7 percent for the EuroStoxx 50. The German conglomerate 3U was the biggest winner, up 10 percent.</p>
      <p>First of all, the earnings seasons was coming to an end with the Q3 results from <a href="https://www.telecompaper.com/news/a3-holds-q3-revenue-steady-corporate-segment-lifts-expands-order-book--1317053">A3</a> (Sweden) and <a href="https://www.telecompaper.com/news/mts-group-revenues-rise-5-in-q3--1316748">MTS</a> (Russia).</p>
      <h3>5G spectrum hopes imploding</h3>
      <p>The FCC <a href="https://www.telecompaper.com/news/fcc-chair-chooses-public-auction-for-c-band-over-satellite-operators-plan--1316657">proposed a public auction</a> for 5G spectrum currently held by Intelsat, SES, Eutelsat and Telesat, bypassing <a href="https://www.telecompaper.com/news/c-band-alliance-offers-to-share-auction-proceeds-with-treasury-build-rural-5g-network--1316501">offers from these operators</a> to share auction proceeds. Intelsat was the biggest casualty (-47%), as in week 46 (-44%). The stock now trades at around USD 7, a level not seen since March 2018. It peaked at almost USD 35 in October 2018.</p>
      <h3>Incumbents listing units</h3>
      <p>Asset sales and consolidation appear to increasingly go hand in hand with the creation of listed subsidiaries. The large incumbents (Deutsche Telekom, Orange, TIM) already have a number of these and more could be added. Inwit, the tower unit controlled by TIM, <a href="https://www.telecompaper.com/news/inwit-board-approves-vodafone-towers-merger-to-pay-special-dividend--1316651">approved the proposed merger</a> with Vodafone Italy's towers. Orange was <a href="https://www.telecompaper.com/news/orange-considers-listing-its-africa-and-middle-east-business-report--1316688">considering listing its African and Middle Eastern</a> operations, and Deutsche Telekom <a href="https://www.telecompaper.com/news/deutsche-telekom-considers-minority-stake-sale-in-t-mobile-netherlands-report--1317114">could seek an IPO of its Dutch subsidiary</a>, if rumours are true. DT's Deutsche Funkturm (mobile towers) could also be spun off.</p>
      <p>The Zayo Group, itself subject to a bid, was <a href="https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/deals/zayo-group-considers-sale-colocation-division">considering</a> the sale of its colocation business.</p>
      <h3>YTD: infrastructure winning</h3>
      <p>Looking ahead to the 2019 performance of the European telecom stocks, we so far have Greek ISP Forthnet (+307%) in the lead, followed by Altice Europe (+206%). Next come Turk Telekom (+82%), 3U (+80%), Intred (+73%) and Cellnex (+67%). Among the weakest shares are the aforementioned satellite operators and a number of German challengers.</p>
      <p>Looking at a number of segments, we notice that most include both winners and losers, whether challengers, fixed operators, incumbents, mobile operators, FMC plays or even satellite groups. There is just a single exception, the group of infrastructure plays. All the stocks in this segment have positive year-to-date performances, which are also ahead of our index (+9.3% YTD). This segment contains:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Data centres: Digital Realty (+12%), Interxion (+58%), Equinix (+58%)</li>
        <li>Fibre: Retelit (+35%), Zayo (+50%), Intred (+73%)</li>
        <li>Masts: Inwit (+48%), Cellnex (+67%)</li>
      </ul>
