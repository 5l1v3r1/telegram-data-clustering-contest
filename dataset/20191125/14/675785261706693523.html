      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T14:51:29+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 14:51</time> by <a rel="author">John Cross, https://www.facebook.com/johncrossmirror/</a></address>
      <p>Arsenal risk losing star duo Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Alexandre Lacazette next summer.</p>
      <p>They have been trying to negotiate new deals with the strikers but fears are growing they will be reluctant to commit while Unai Emery remains in charge.</p>
      <p>Aubameyang is out of contract in 2021 and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> will be reluctant to allow him to go into the final year of his deal and risk losing the £57m striker for nothing.</p>
      <p>Aubameyang, 30, is a huge fan favourite and the supporters will be desperate for him to stay and he has been made club captain after the Granit Xhaka farce.</p>

      <p>But that still may not be enough to persuade him to stay if they slip into mid-table and also miss out on European football with their likely to be a long list of clubs ready to move in.</p>
      <p>Arsenal have been clear on a club policy that they will cash in on players rather than let them run down their contracts and make the mistakes of the past which saw Aaron Ramsey leave for free last summer but Aubameyang is already past that point.</p>
      <p>Lacazette, 28, is also desperate to play in the Champions League and has been holding off with Arsenal struggling to get back into the top four.</p>
      <p>France international Lacazette has been holding off and is on big bonuses if Arsenal reach the top four but is ambitious and wants Champions League football.</p>

      <p>It is added pressure on Emery who is clinging on to his job as Arsenal manager with the board increasingly concerned by results and whether he is still able to inspire the dressing room.</p>
      <p>Emery has gone six games without a win - the club’s worst run in more than 20 years - and the players are rapidly losing faith in the former Paris Saint Germain boss.</p>
      <p>Spaniard Emery knows his job is on the line with Arsenal facing Eintracht Frankfurt in the Europa League on Thursday and then Premier League games with Norwich, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brighton-and-hove-albion-fc">Brighton</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> .</p>
      <p>Even though Arsenal have supported Emery publicly, the club are worried about results with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> coach Mikel Arteta on their radar while Mauricio Pochettino has been widely touted after being axe by Spurs but would have to cross the North London divide.</p>

      <p>Arsenal’s head of football Raul Sanllehi and technical director Edu went into the dressing room after Saturday’s 2-2 draw with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/southampton-fc">Southampton</a> and that is being seen as a clear sign the hierarchy are worried about the dressing room.</p>
      <p>It is clear from performances on the pitch that players have lost confidence and the fear is that Emery may be losing his grip on the dressing room if he has not lost it already.</p>
