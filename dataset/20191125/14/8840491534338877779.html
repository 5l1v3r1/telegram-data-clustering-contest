      <p>The results of the 2019 National Inpatient Experience Survey have been published today in the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, Dublin.</p>
      <p>This annual survey, the largest of its kind in Ireland, asks patients about their experiences of hospital care, covering topics such as admission to hospital, privacy, care and treatment, interaction with staff, and discharge processes.</p>
      <p>Almost 400 patients from Mayo University Hospital participated in the 2019 survey, resulting in a strong response rate of 47%.</p>
      <p>The aim of the National Inpatient Experience Survey is to find out from patients what is working well in our health service, and where improvements are necessary.</p>
      <p>The Health Service Executive (HSE) responds to the survey findings by developing local and national initiatives to improve the quality of care provided to patients.</p>
      <p>Rachel Flynn, Director of the National Care Experience Programme, said: “The majority of patients had positive experiences in Mayo University Hospital. 79% of patients said that they had a ‘good’ or a ‘very good’ experience, below the national average of 84%.</p>
      <p>“Patients’ ratings of three stages of care — admissions, care on the ward, and overall experience — were below last year’s score.</p>
      <p>“The hospital also scored below the national average on questions concerning respect and dignity. “On the other hand, many patients said that nurses always provided clear answers to their questions, and gave patients sufficient notice of their discharge from hospital. In addition, most patients said that they were always offered a choice of food.”</p>
      <p>Paul Reid, HSE CEO, said: “I would like to thank our patients, their carers and families for taking the time to complete the survey and for sharing their experiences of hospital care with us.</p>
      <p>“It is important that we listen to and learn from our patients so that we can continue to improve patient care.”</p>
