      <p>Roy Burns Sr. opened Burns BBQ in Houston's Acres Homes neighborhood in the early 1970s. <br/><br/>His family carries on his rich barbecue legacy to this day, and that's why their motto is "Great BBQ Lives On!" <br/><br/><br/>Thrust into the national spotlight by a 2016 episode of Anthony Bourdain's "Parts Unknown," Burns is famous for its ribs, homemade links and other smoked treats. <br/><br/>And, if you're really hungry, feel free to tackle the 10 pound baked potato, which comes with everything from butter to sausage to brisket and nearly everything in between!</p>
