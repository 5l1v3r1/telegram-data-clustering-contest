      <h2>John Lewis slashes £300 from iPhone XS, but 64GB model has already sold out - grab the 256GB model now!</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T14:28:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 14:28</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.macworld.co.uk/author/david-price/" target="_blank">David Price</a></address>
      <p>John Lewis has commenced its Black Friday sale with a variety of <a href="http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=1203&amp;awinaffid=254429&amp;clickref=41-3778611-11-0000000&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.johnlewis.com%2Fbrowse%2Fblack-friday%2Felectrical-offers%2Fapple-offers%2F_%2FN-7mne">discounts on Apple products</a>, including £300 off the year-old iPhone XS.</p>
      <p>The 64GB model has already sold out, but the 256GB version remains, <a href="http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=1203&amp;awinaffid=254429&amp;clickref=41-3778611-11-0000000&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.johnlewis.com%2Fapple-iphone-xs-ios-5-8-inch-4g-lte-sim-free-256gb%2Fp3769043">available for just £849</a>. That's £300 less than the launch RRP of £1,149. (Which makes it odd that John Lewis is advertising this as a saving of just £250. Why so modest, lads?)</p>
      <p>Note that Amazon is currently offering <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07HKD76VR?ascsubtag=41-3778611-11-0000000">the same deal</a>, but we would recommend going with John Lewis as long as stocks last because of that company's superior warranty. Amazon also has the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07HKDMD9R?ascsubtag=41-3778611-11-0000000">cheaper XS with 64GB</a>, again at £300 off.</p>
