      <p>Talks have taken place between West Ham United and manager Manuel Pellegrini following an alarming slump in form.</p>
      <p>West Ham have lost five of their last seven Premier League games, with just two draws, and also crashed out of the Carabao Cup losing 4-0 to League One Oxford United with Pellegrini in danger of losing his job.</p>
      <p>The manager was told that results and performances have to improve with West Ham having slumped from third in the table to 16<sup>th</sup> just three points above the relegation places following <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/23/west-ham-vs-tottenham-premier-league-live-score-latest-updates/">the dispiriting defeat at home to Tottenham Hotspur on Saturday</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/24/west-ham-considering-manuel-pellegrinis-future-disastrous-sequence/">The run has dismayed the West Ham hierarchy </a>who want to support Pellegrini and keep him as manager, having invested heavily in the squad since he was hired in the summer of 2018, but are understandably demanding an immediate improvement.</p>
      <p>There is a fear that Pellegrini is not accepting the seriousness of the situation with West Ham desperate not to be involved in a relegation fight.</p>
      <p>With a run of fixtures starting with Chelsea away on Saturday followed by Wolverhampton Wanderers away and Arsenal at home then Pellegrini could be facing a defining period.</p>

      <p>West Ham do not play again until their Boxing Day visit to Crystal Palace – a gap of 12 days – which would give them time to bring in a replacement for Pellegrini if a change is needed.</p>
      <p>It is hoped that goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski will return for that fixture having not featured since September 28 when he tore a hip muscle against Bournemouth.</p>
      <p>The 34-year-old underwent surgery and last week spoke of how his “rehab is going in the right direction” but added that he was not going to “rush” his return. There was an expectation that Fabianski would not come back until the new year but West Ham are now hopeful he will come back sooner.</p>
      <p>In his absence under-study Roberto has endured a torrid time and West Ham plan to sign a new number two when the January transfer window opens with the 33-year-old Spaniard, who arrived on a free transfer in the summer on a two-year deal after his contract ended at Espanyol, likely to be moved on.</p>
      <p>It may also be that Roberto, who has conceded 20 goals in just eight appearances since replacing Fabianski, is dropped for Saturday’s game at Stamford Bridge with third-choice goalkeeper David Martin replacing him. Martin, also 33, signed for West Ham on a free transfer from Millwall.</p>
