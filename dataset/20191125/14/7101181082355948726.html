      <p><a href="https://www.etonline.com/people/kel-mitchell">Kel Mitchell</a>'s <i><a href="https://www.etonline.com/tv/dancing-with-the-stars">Dancing With the Stars</a> </i>stint almost didn't happen.</p>
      <p>ET's Lauren Zima <a href="https://www.etonline.com/dwts-hannah-brown-kel-mitchell-lauren-alaina-and-ally-brooke-tease-how-they-plan-to-win-exclusive">caught up with the 41-year-old comedian</a> and his partner, <a href="https://www.etonline.com/people/witney-carson">Witney Carson</a>, during camera blocking ahead of <i>DWTS</i>' Monday finale, and he revealed that he was the last person to be cast on the show this season.</p>
      <p>"I feel like the underdog and we've been going up with every dance, which has been amazing!" Mitchell said. "Witney has been doing amazing choreography so it's definitely been exciting."</p>
      <p>"I was the last one picked for <i>Dancing With the Stars</i>," the<i> Good Burger </i>star added, much to the shock of his partner. "Somebody dropped out and that's how I got in this thing."</p>
      <p>Mitchell learned of his last-minute addition to the cast as soon as he agreed to do the show because the producers quickly told him, "You're gonna have to jump on a plane, like, immediately."</p>
      <p>"I was just like, 'OK. Alright,'" he recalled. "It was no talks. It was a call out of no where and I was like, 'Of course I'll do <i>Dancing With the Stars</i>. This is awesome!'"</p>
      <p>While Mitchell had never expressed serious interest about competing for the mirrorball trophy, he had previously mentioned to his family that it'd "be awesome" to be on <i>DWTS</i>.</p>
      <p>"I have dance fever so I love to dance and everybody knows!" Mitchell explained.</p>
      <p>As for his chances at snagging the trophy after his last-minute casting, Mitchell told ET that he "had a dream" about winning over remaining competitors Hannah Brown, Lauren Alaina and Ally Brooke.</p>
      <p>"We talked about this. I actually had a dream about [winning]," he said. "I saw Witney screaming with the mirrorball and I'm just like, 'OK, so that's the plan, lets get it.' I definitely had some visions. It was awesome."</p>
