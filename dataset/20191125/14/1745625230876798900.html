      <p><a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/teen-mom-2/"><i>Teen Mom 2</i></a> star <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/chelsea-houska/">Chelsea Houska</a> has become a fan favorite on the show as well as a bit of a style icon for fans. Recently, she took to her <a href="https://www.instagram.com/chelseahouska/">Instagram stories</a> to share some of her hair care secrets and even revealed how she gets her shade of red hair.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, she took to the social networking site and shared with her fans what hair products she uses. First, she shared that she uses Keratin Heating Oil from L’ANZA. From the same brand, she also uses the Silken Shampoo.</p>
      <p>While she shared the normal shampoo that she uses for her gorgeous locks, she also revealed which dry shampoo she uses. Chelsea posted a photo of dry shampoo from Big Sexy Hair. This isn’t the first time she has been open about using dry shampoo, though. The reality show star showed off a <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/5738599/chelsea-houska-makeup/">makeup haul</a> recently on her Instagram stories in which she revealed she uses dry shampoo. As a mom of three young kids, dry shampoo can become essential for a mom with a busy schedule.</p>
      <p>When it comes to hairspray, Chelsea revealed that she uses L’ANZA Healing Volume Final Effects to hold her style. How does she achieve her flawless curls, though? Chelsea also revealed that secret to her fans showing off a Hot Tools 24K Gold Curling Iron. There are plenty of different sized curling irons, depending on what kind of curls you want to get. In order to get her curls, Chelsea revealed that she uses the 1 and 1/4-inch curling iron. Chelsea doesn’t always use a curling iron, though, and at times straightens her hair. She revealed that uses the Paul Mitchell Neuro Smooth Flat Iron.</p>

      <p>While Chelsea has rocked some different styles over the years, she has had her red hair for a few years. However, as previously reported by <i>The Inquisitr</i>, she revealed that she was considering changing up <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/5740332/chelsea-houska-hair/">her style</a> in the future.</p>
      <p>“I want to go dark dark, almost black. But I’m scared,” Chelsea admitted.</p>
