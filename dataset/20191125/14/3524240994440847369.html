      <p>Chidiebube Okeoma, Owerri</p>
      <p>The operatives of the Special Anti- Robbery Squad of the Imo State Police Command have arrested one Emmanuel Obioma, for defrauding his United States-based mistress, Ugo Emake, of N821,000 .</p>
      <p>The Police Public Relations Officer, Orlando Ikeokwu, told journalists that the suspect also faked his kidnap and demanded N1million ransom from his mistress.</p>
      <p>Also arrested as Obioma’s accomplices, according to the police spokesperson, were Iheanacho Ugochi and Agbo Samuel.</p>
      <p>Ikeokwu said that a laptop, eight sim cards, Lexus 330, and a mobile phone were recovered as exhibits from the suspects.</p>
      <p>He said that the SARS commander, Godfrey Victor, led the operation that led to the arrest of the suspects.</p>
      <p>Ikeokwu said, “On November 2, the operatives of the Special Anti -Robbery Squad, acting on a credible intelligence arrested these suspects for fraud and faking kidnap.</p>
      <p>“Emmanuel initiated a relationship with one Ugo Emake, a female, who lives in the United States of America. He claimed he lives in US as well but he installed software which ensured that a foreign number appears on the lady’s phone each time he called.</p>
      <p>“Having succeeded in making her believe he lives in the US, he then informed her that he was traveling to Nigeria. Upon his fake arrival to Nigeria, he claimed he had an accident of which two people lost their lives in the process.</p>
      <p>“He, therefore, demanded financial assistance for his treatment as a result of which she sent him the sum of N821,000 on two installments.</p>
      <p>“Furthermore, on October 17 he raised a false alarm of being kidnapped while returning to Owerri from Kogi State. He demanded N1m from his mistress which he said was the amount due for ransom. An investigation was launched and he and his accomplices were arrested by the SARS operatives.”</p>
