      <p>A group of local residents and Central Saanich police teamed up to recapture a ram that was on the lam for several hours on Sunday morning.</p>
      <p>The ram managed to escape its farm enclosure and got out onto the road in the area of Benvenuto Ave. and West Saanich Rd, causing traffic delays at approximately 10:30 a.m. Sunday.</p>
      <p>RCMP tell <a href="https://vancouverisland.ctvnews.ca/">CTV News Vancouver Island </a>that the managed to corral the ram with the help of, "some really good neighbours and Good Samaritans".</p>
      <p>It took officers and their helpers about 45 minutes to wrangle the ram before its owner arrived and took it back to the farm where it lives.</p>
