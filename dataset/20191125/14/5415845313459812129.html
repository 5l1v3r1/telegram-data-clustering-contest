      <h1>Arsenal: Top 5 Unai Emery replacements</h1>
      <h2>Arsenal are seemingly on the verge of sacking head coach Unai Emery. If they do make such a decision, here are the top five candidates the club should consider as his successor.</h2>

      <p><a href="https://paininthearsenal.com/?s=unai+emery">Unai Emery</a> is on ‘borrowed time’ per The Times. According to other sources, the <a href="https://paininthearsenal.com/?s=arsenal">Arsenal</a> board are split on the Spaniard, with an increasing number believing that he should be sacked here and now. The players are also now beginning to lose faith in their manager, which you could read from their body language during Saturday’s 2-2 draw with Southampton. It seems, then, that the end is near for Emery. But if that is the case, who should the Gunners consider to replace him?</p>

      <h3>5. Julian Nagelsmann</h3>
      <p>There are few hotter prospects in the management scene than<a href="https://paininthearsenal.com/?s=julian+nagelsmann"> Julian Nagelsmann</a>. He is so highly thought of that RB Leipzig actually hired him a year before he would arrive at the club! But now Nagelsmann is at the helm at Leipzig, he is once again proving his coaching chops, building a team rivalling the very best in the Bundesliga.</p>
      <p>Hired as the youngest head coach in German football history at just 28, Nagelsmann first rescued Hoffenheim from relegation in the 2015/16 season, leading his team to seven wins in their final 14 points to overturn a seven-point deficit from safety and keep them in the division. The next season, Nagelsmann led Hoffenheim to a fourth-place finish and was named the Bundesliga Manager of the Season and the German Football Manager of the Season.</p>
      <p>In 2019, he then moved to RB Leipzig. In his first season in Leipzig, he has his team in second position in the table, just one point behind the leaders, and largely viewed as very genuine title contenders against the might of Bayern Munich. Having only just arrived at RB Leipzig, Nagelsmann will be difficult and expensive to prise away, but his coaching record is undeniable. Arsenal should, at the very least, not make an approach.</p>
