      <p>Cryptocurrency exchange platform <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/">Coinbase</a> announced last week that Coinbase UK now supports four new assets on its platform, which are Tezos (XTZ), Dai (DAI), EOS (EOS), and Chainlink (LINK).  Coinbase reported that by supporting the new assets, the platform grants customers access to buy, sell, and trade even more assets through a GBP wallet, funded by a GBP bank account or credit and debit card. The crypto portal also noted that the support follows the complete reinstatement of its GBP wallet functionality and the recent launch of BAT, ZRX, REP, XLM, and XRP.</p>

      <blockquote>“Adding support for even more assets brings us closer to our long-term mission to help bring economic freedom, innovation, and equality to everyone, everywhere.”</blockquote>
      <p>The support of the assets also <a href="https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2019/11/154130-coinbase-card-now-supports-five-new-assets-ten-new-countries/">comes just days</a> after Coinbase announced its Coinbase Card supports five new assets and ten new countries. The card is now available in a total of 29 countries, with customers in Bulgaria, Croatia, Denmark, Hungary, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Poland, Romania, and Sweden being able to spend their crypto balance using a contactless Visa debit card in millions of locations worldwide.</p>
      <blockquote>“We’ve also more than doubled the number of assets available to spend — going from 4 to 9. XRP, BAT, REP, ZRX, and XLM wallets can now be used to buy anything from coffee to Christmas shopping. These five new assets join BTC, ETH, BCH, and LTC. Spending crypto as easily as money in your bank account is exactly what Coinbase Card lets you do. But for us, it doesn’t stop there. Spending summaries, combined with our brand new monthly statements feature, make tracking your crypto spend easy.”</blockquote>
