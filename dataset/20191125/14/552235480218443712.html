      <p>A brave teen left wheelchair bound after being diagnosed with FIVE brain tumours is hoping an op will help him walk again - after one leg was left at a 40 degree angle.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/miracle-teen-five-brain-tumours-13418762">Kieran Crighton</a> , 14, was left unable to walk, talk, or swallow after being diagnosed with an aggressive form of medulloblastoma in 2017.</p>
      <p>One tumour was removed, while the others were blasted with chemo and radiotherapy and an MRI scan showed he is now cancer free.</p>
      <p>But the treatment left the youngster with one leg contracted to a <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/miracle-teen-five-brain-tumours-13418762">40 degree angle</a> , either due to the amount of time Kieran spent lying down, or because of posterior <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/miracle-teen-five-brain-tumours-13418762">fossa syndrome</a> , which can occur after surgery for brain tumours.</p>
      <p>Medics attempted to stretch <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/miracle-teen-five-brain-tumours-13418762">Kieran</a> 's leg under anaesthetic but it was unsuccessful.</p>

      <p>His mum, Senga, 50, is meeting doctors at the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/miracle-teen-five-brain-tumours-13418762">Queen Elizabeth University Hospital</a> in Glasgow on Thursday to find out what the prospects are for major surgery to help Kieran walk.</p>
      <p>He has re-learnt to speak and to swallow, but Senga is concerned her youngest son, who has <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/miracle-teen-five-brain-tumours-13418762">Asperger</a> 's, has been through enough pain without having another op.</p>
      <p>Senga said: "He was in and they tried to stretch it, but they couldn't stretch it fully.</p>
      <p>"What they have noticed is that the muscle at the top has wasted away.</p>
      <p>"I think it is going to be a <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/miracle-teen-five-brain-tumours-13418762">major operation</a> , we are going on Thursday to see the surgeon.</p>
      <p>"His voice has come back, it sounded very robotic at first, it was like Stephen Hawking, but it has got better and better.</p>
      <p>"That was in Easter last year, he still has a weak swallow but he can eat now."</p>
      <p>Single mum Senga, who has another son, <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/miracle-teen-five-brain-tumours-13418762">Darren</a> , 24, put her career on hold for a year to care for her son.</p>
      <p>Kieran has now gone back to school for four hours a day.</p>
      <p>Senga added: "I think he thought he'd wake up from the anaesthetic and his leg would be flat.</p>
      <p>"I don't want to put him through something that's going to cause him a lot of pain, I think he's been through enough.</p>
      <p>"He's a fighter, he will try and do it."</p>
      <p>After the horror diagnosis, Kieran underwent six weeks of radiotherapy and four rounds of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/miracle-teen-five-brain-tumours-13418762">chemo</a> but is now back home in Kilwinning, Ayrshire.</p>
      <p>His mum added: "It has been a rollercoaster.</p>
      <p>"He is such an inspirational wee boy and he's got a great sense of humour."</p>
