      <p>The DC label head also worked with Michael Rubin to free a Pennsylvania inmate.</p>
      <p><b>(AllHipHop News) </b>Robert "Meek Mill" Williams continues to take steps to support criminal justice reform. Meek is now helping to raise money for the REFORM Alliance, a nonprofit dedicated to changing the laws, policies, and practices that perpetuate injustice in America.</p>
      <p>Beginning November 26, Lids will sell limited-release DreamChasers hats. A percentage of the proceeds from the individual sale of each headpiece will be donated to the REFORM Alliance.</p>
      <p>Meek Mill is the co-owner and creative director for Lids. He is also the co-founder of REFORM Alliance alongside Michael Rubin, Shawn “Jay-Z” Carter, Robert Kraft, Robert F. Smith, Clara Wu Tsai, Laura Arnold, Michael Novogratz, and Daniel S. Loeb. </p>
      <p>“Having my own line with Lids is special, but I’m especially proud that proceeds from this hat will be used to help fix the broken criminal justice system,” said Mill. “I’m grateful that our team at Lids was committed to making a hat that’s stylish, but will go toward a greater cause.”</p>

      <p>Last week, REFORM Alliance Co-Chairs Meek Mill and Michael Rubin helped free Philadelphia native Maurice Hudson from state prison. Hudson was sentenced to 1 ½ to 3 years because he could not afford to pay $1,941 in outstanding court costs.</p>
      <p>The Pennsylvania Supreme Court ordered Hudson’s release on Friday morning. Rubin and fellow Philadelphia 76ers partner Josh Harris hosted Hudson as a VIP guest at the Sixers' home game against the Spurs that night. </p>
      <p>Meek also provided Hudson and his family with new clothes from fashion designer Milano di Rouge as well as items from PUMA. Plus, the Grammy-nominated emcee is assisting the 29-year-old father with transitioning back to society and finding a job.</p>
