      <p>Four among seven independent MLAs supporting the BJP-JJP government in <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/haryana">Haryana </a>were on Monday given plum positions in various boards and corporations.</p>
      <p>While independent legislator Ranjit Singh Chautala has already been made a minister in the Bharatiya Janata Party-Jannayak Janta Party coalition government, the state government has now appointed four other independents as chairmen of various boards and corporations.</p>
      <p>The newly appointed chairmen are MLAs representing Dadri, Faridabad, Pundri and Nillokheri assembly constituencies.</p>
      <p>Sombir Sangwan has been appointed as the chairman of <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/haryana">Haryana </a>Livestock Development Board while Nayan Pal Rawat has been made the chairman of <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/haryana">Haryana </a>State Warehousing Corporation, an official statement said here.</p>
      <p>Similarly,Randhir Singh Gollen has been appointed as the chairman of Haryana Tourism Corporation and Dharam Pal Gondar has been appointed as the chairman Haryana Forest Development Corporation.</p>
      <p>The previous chairmen of these boards and corporations have submitted their resignations, which were accepted by the state government, the statement said.</p>
      <p>The four independent legislators, who were made various boards' chairmen, had been aspiring for Cabinet berths and had recently flexed their muscles, holding a meeting in Delhi barely days before the M L Khattar government was to carry out the first Cabinet expansion.</p>
      <p>In the expansion carried out over ten days ago, Ranjit Chautala was given a Cabinet berth, but no other independent was accommodated.</p>
      <p>The move is being seen as one to placate the independent legislators.</p>
