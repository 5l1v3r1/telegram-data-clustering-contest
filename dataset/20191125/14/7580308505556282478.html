      <p>American singer-songwriter <a href="https://guardian.ng/tag/taylor-swift/">Taylor Swift</a> has beaten <a href="https://guardian.ng/?s=Michael+Jackson">Michael Jackson</a>‘s AMA wins record to become the most awarded artist at the American Music Awards.</p>
      <p>Swift emerged the biggest winner at the award show after garnering six awards thereby bringing her to a total of 28 awards – the highest in the history of the American Music Awards.</p>
      <p>Swift won awards in Favorite Album – Pop/Rock, Favorite Music Video, Favorite Female Artist – Pop/Rock, Favorite Artist – Adult Contemporary and Artist of the Year categories, making her the artist with the most AMAs of all time.</p>
      <p>Swift was honoured with the Artist of the Decade award by legendary singer-songwriter Carole King, whose hits include I Feel The Earth Move and (You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman.</p>
      <blockquote>“All any of the artists in this room want is to create something that will last. And all that matters to me is the memories that I have had with you, the fans, over the years, because we’ve had fun, incredible exhilarating times together. Thank you for being the reason I am on this stage,” she said.</blockquote>
      <p>Later in the night, when she won Artist of the Year.</p>
      <blockquote>“The last year of my life has had some of the most amazing and some of the hardest things I’ve gone through… And not—a lot of them are things that haven’t been public, and I wanted to thank you so much for being the thing that has been a constant in my life,” she said.<br/><br/>“Like, this industry is really weird where sometimes people who do what we do feel like—and I’m sure as some of you feel like this too with your lives, like you feel like your stock is either up or down and people either like you or they don’t or you’re feeling bad about yourself but the people who hang in there for you are the ones that you will never forget. And the fans who have hung in there for 15 years of me doing this,” she added.</blockquote>
