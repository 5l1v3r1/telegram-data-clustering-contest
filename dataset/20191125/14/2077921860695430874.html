      <h1>Emily Yacina's "Arcades &amp; Highways" Celebrates Long-Distance Love</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T14:58:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 14:58</time> by <a rel="author">Amanda Gersten  </a></address>
      <p>The New York-based DIY singer-songwriter and frequent (Sandy) Alex G collaborator Emily Yacina is releasing her studio debut, <i>Remember the Silver</i>, in a little less than two weeks. We’ll have the entire record on Dec. 6, but for now, she’s given us a final single to put on repeat: “Arcades &amp; Highways,” a sweet, breezy tune that Yacina says celebrates “the easy side of love.”</p>
      <p>Each of <i>Remember the Silver</i>’s singles has had a different vibe: “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-ZJiAOZoZU">Gleaming</a>” glides from choppy to ethereal, while “<a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2019/11/emily-yacina-learns-to-let-go-on-new-single-bleach.html">Bleachers</a>” was loping and melancholy. Listening to “Arcades &amp; Highways” is like being wrapped up in a warm cocoon: “I need you to swallow me,” Yacina duets with guest vocalist <a href="https://rlkelly.bandcamp.com/">Rachel Levy</a>, and it feels an embrace.</p>
      <p>The track is buoyant and bittersweet as it recounts the rare moments of blissful togetherness in a long-distance relationship. “Do you want to marry me / In the hotel by the airport before you have to leave?” asks Yacina. Levy’s rich vocals offer a beautiful complement to Yacina’s, as does cello from Kate Sopcich. Levy (fka R.L. Kelly) released two tracks <a href="https://rlkelly.bandcamp.com/album/blink-183">earlier this year</a>, and has previously released split singles with <a href="https://rlkelly.bandcamp.com/album/spencer-radcliffe-r-l-kelly-split-brown-horse">Spencer Radcliffe</a> and <a href="https://rlkelly.bandcamp.com/album/alex-g-r-l-kelly-split">(Sandy) Alex G</a>.</p>
