      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/ohio-state-buckeyes">Ohio State</a> defensive end Chase Young returned from a two-game suspension with a vengeance Saturday.</p>
      <p>Young recorded three sacks in the Buckeyes’ 28-17 victory over <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/penn-state-nittany-lions">Penn State</a> and set a school single-season record for sacks with 16.5. He broke the original 14 mark set by Vernon Gholston in 2007.</p>

      <p>“I was itching to get back on the field, just not being on there for two weeks,” the star defensive lineman said after the game, according to <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/28147511/chase-young-sets-buckeyes-single-season-sacks-record">ESPN</a>. “I just tried to give it all I had today and we won the game, and that's all we care about.”</p>

      <p>The junior sat out Ohio State’s games against Rutgers and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/maryland-terrapins">Maryland</a> after it was learned that he violated NCAA rules by accepting a loan from a family friend in 2018, though he paid it back in full.</p>

      <p>He finished the game against Penn State with nine total tackles and four tackles for a loss.</p>
      <p>“I wouldn't say [the game was] personal,” he said. “I guess it may be personal because it was my first game back. I just tried to put my best foot forward, but I wouldn't say personal for me.”</p>
      <p>Young is among those in the conversation for the Heisman Trophy. His overall dominance on the field this season definitely puts him in the conversation with the likes of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/lsu-tigers">LSU</a> quarterback Joe Burrow and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/wisconsin-badgers">Wisconsin</a> running back Jonathan Taylor.</p>
