        <b>With the battle for midfield places set to go down to the wire, <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/scuderia-toro-rosso">Toro Rosso</a> driver, <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/daniil-kvyat">Daniil Kvyat</a> wants to end the 2019 season on a high in Abu Dhabi as their battle with <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/renault-f1-team">Renault</a> goes down to the final race of the season.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Only eight points separate the fifth and sixth-placed constructors, with Renault holding the advantage over their nearest rivals, 91 to 83. McLaren are confirmed as best of the rest but the battle for fifth is set to go down to the wire in Abu Dhabi.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/pierre-gasly">Pierre Gasly's</a> first-ever podium at the <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/grandsprix/Brazilian-grand-prix">Brazilian Grand Prix</a>, helped the team close the gap and now Kvyat is looking to end the season on a high.</p>

      <p><i>"This last race will be another opportunity to get a good result to end the season on a high,"</i> Kvyat said in Toro Rosso's preview.</p>
      <p>
        <i>"I always enjoy the Yas Marina track, to be honest, even though it has those huge run-off areas but still, the configuration itself is quite interesting. We can play around with the lines quite a lot there. The third sector is pretty challenging.</i>
