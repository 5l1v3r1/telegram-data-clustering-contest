        <b>Kimberley Walsh revealed she was left ‘streaming with tears’ as she watched fellow Girls Aloud bandmate <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/nadine-coyle/">Nadine Coyle</a> jump out of a helicopter for <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a> Get Me Out Of Here.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Appearing on Loose Women, the Sounds of the Underground singer said Nadine is a ‘scaredy-cat’ when it comes to heights and thrills.</p>
      <p>She said: ‘I couldn’t actually believe the reaction that I had. I suddenly started filling up and I’m streaming with tears.</p>
      <p>‘You realise how much you care for people in those moments because I knew how much of a big deal that moment was for her.’</p>
      <p>The start of I’m A Celeb saw <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/16/im-a-celebritys-nadine-coyle-in-tears-as-shes-comforted-by-caitlyn-jenner-over-skydiving-challenge-11168416/">Nadine and Caitlyn Jenner jump from a helicopter at 10,000 feet</a> and even we were scared.</p>
      <p>On whether Nadine is a ‘scaredy-cat’, Kimberley said: ‘She genuinely is. She hates rides, like when we used to have to go to theme parks and get filmed on rides she was terrified.</p>

      <p>‘So when I saw she was going to [jump] I was like, “Aww”. I’m so impressed she did it.’</p>

      <p>Kimberley, 38, was also over the moon that she got to witness <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/im-a-celebritys-nadine-coyle-teaches-caitlyn-jenner-girls-aloud-dance-moves-and-its-pure-comedy-gold-11197437/">Caitlyn Jenner practise the Girls Aloud The Promise dance</a>.</p>
      <p>Nadine taught the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star the elaborate moves, and we lost our minds.</p>
      <p>Kimberley beamed: ‘Oh my gosh, that was amazing. I was really excited about that.’</p>
      <p>Caitlyn, Nadine, Adele Roberts and Jacqueline Jossa all stood up to form their own girl band and Nadine taught them the moves to the song.</p>
      <p>Talking in the hut afterward Nadine explained: ‘I taught the girls a little bit of The Promise routine, Jacqueline and Adele knew most of it already.</p>
      <p>‘Caitlyn just threw herself into it, we’ll teach her Sound of the Underground next.’</p>
      <p>Now we’re fully expecting Caitlyn to leave the jungle a Girls Aloud super fan.</p>
