      <p>Pregnancy should be a lovely, stress free time where the mother-to-be is doted on by those around her as she prepares for life with her beautiful new baby. Not so for Neighbours’ Elly Conway (Jodi Anasta). Having already coped with a dangerous fall, having her husband leave her, and then losing the father of her baby, she’s now about to enter into a stalker hell as she faces the impending birth. Are she and her baby in danger?</p>
      <p>And could Finn Kelly (Rob Mills) be left trying to do what he can to save her?</p>
      <p>Finn’s feelings for Elly are getting out of hand and Susan (Jackie Woodburne) senses something is up – there is very little that can get past that woman. Finn is spending more of his time dedicating himself to Elly and the baby, and his own girlfriend is being left out in the cold. Elly feels weird about it all and finds herself having to decide if she wants to let Finn in more.</p>

      <p>Susan decides enough is enough and confronts Finn about his behaviour. It’s not on, treating her nieces like that. He’s lavished money on Elly and has that secret photo album he’d kept squirrelled away. It’s not right and Susan tells him so. But as she chastises him for what he’s doing, they don’t realise the vulnerable situation Elly is in.</p>
      <p>She walks home through Lassiters, something she’s done a thousand times before, but this time she is unaware she’s being followed by a sinister-looking hooded figure. They mirror her every move and clearly have a plan for the former teacher, what do they want from her?</p>

      <p>When Elly realises what’s going on, she runs straight to Finn who flies into protective mode, determined to find out who is leaving Elly terrified.</p>
      <p>After setting a trap he’s shocked to learn it’s Dean, the student who helped get Elly fired. When confronted, Dean tells them he just feels guilty and wants to make things right. Weird way of going about it, there’s clearly something else at play here. It seems like he’s fobbing them off and they’re buying it.</p>
      <p>Is he trying to get close to exact another part of a plan?</p>
