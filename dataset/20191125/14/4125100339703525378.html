      <p>Justice Nicholas Oweibo had on October 24 picked Monday commencement of trial but he was unavoidably absent when the matter came up for hearing.</p>
      <p>Iwu is arraigned on a three-count charge of fraud and money laundering by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC).</p>
      <p>He was first arraigned on August 8 before Justice Chuka Obiozor, who granted him bail in the sum of N1billion.</p>
      <p>Following the transfer of the case to Justice Oweibo, Iwu was re-arraigned by the EFCC on October 24.</p>
      <p>The ex-INEC chairman had pleaded not guilty to the charges and Justice Oweibo adjourned till Monday for the trial to commence.</p>
      <p>Sequel to the absence of the judge, the case was further adjourned till February 27, 2020.</p>

      <p>EFCC had alleged that between December 2014 and March 27, 2015, Iwu “aided the concealment of N1.23billion in the account of Bioresources Institute of Nigeria Limited with number 1018603119, domiciled in the United Bank for Africa.”</p>
      <p>The Commission said he “ought to have reasonably known that the N1.23billion formed part of proceeds of an unlawful act, to wit: fraud.”</p>
      <p>The EFCC prosecuting counsel, Mr. Rotimi Oyedepo, told the court that the ex-INEC chairman acted contrary to sections 18(a) and 15 (2) (a) of the Money Laundering ((Prohibition) Act 2011 and was liable to be punished under Section 15(3) of the same Act.</p>
