      <h1>Uber Stalls as London Fog Hovers Over the Stock</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T14:50:51+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 14:50</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://realmoney.thestreet.com/author/1668375/bruce-kamich/all.html" target="_blank">BRUCE KAMICH</a></address>
      <p>Uber Technologies (<a href="https://realmoney.thestreet.com/quote/UBER.html">UBER</a>)  is trading lower Monday morning on the heels of news that the ride hailing-company has been <a href="https://www.thestreet.com/investing/stocks/uber-slumps-amid-report-london-set-to-revoke-license-in-key-european-market-15180032">stripped of its license to operate in London</a> for the second time in two years. While its services won't immediately be blocked, it is a big blow to the company, which must appeal the decision and prove its safety record.</p>
      <p>Let's look at the short record of its price history of the <a href="https://realmoney.thestreet.com/stock-of-the-day"><i>Real Money</i> Stock of the Day</a>. </p>
      <p>In the daily bar chart of UBER, below, we can see that prices declined from July into November. Prices fell more rapidly in early November on fears of sales of shares formerly under lock-up would hit the market.   Trading volume swelled and the On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line fell to a new low for the move down. Trading volume has remained heavy this month and prices and the OBV line have bottomed. The OBV line has recently turned upward and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator has crossed to the upside for a cover shorts buy signal.    </p>

      <p>  In this Point and Figure chart of UBER, below, we can see that the software is projecting a potential rally to the $38 area.   </p>

      <p><b>Bottom-line strategy: </b>UBER is likely to decline Monday but the key to the price action ahead will be how quickly the share price discounts the news from London. Remember that markets are forward looking.  </p>
