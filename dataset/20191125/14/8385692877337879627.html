      <p>The normal price on the Roborock E20 is about $299, so you're saving $100 here, and you're getting a very capable robot vacuum for under $200. That's a win/win.</p>

      <p>The Roborock E20 is able to map out your home, thanks to the dual-gyro system that it has. Instead of using lasers. This is able to map out your home, so you can see in the Mi Home app where the Roborock E20 is and where it hasn't cleaned yet. You can also control it and tell it where to go.</p>
      <p>With this robot vacuum, you're also getting some really good suction. We're looking at twice if not more, than the competitors in this price range. Making it a really great robot vacuum to use for those with pets.</p>
      <p>There's also auto carpet boost, where the robot vacuum is able to automatically boost the suction when it realizes that it is on carpet and not laminate or hardwood floor. That makes a big difference, as carpet needs more suction anyways.</p>

      <p>Finally, and this is a feature that we can't forget about. The Roborock E20 works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant. So you can say "Hey Google, ask Roborock to start cleaning", and you're new Roborock E20 robot vacuum will start cleaning your home. That's a pretty neat feature to say the least.</p>
