      <h3>How to fix iPhone 11 battery life issues</h3>
      <h4>Solution 1: Restart your iPhone 11</h4>
      <p>We have tons of apps on our phones, and many processes that keep running in the background of our devices. The best way to shut them off and give your phone a breath of fresh air is by restarting it. So, this should be the first thing to do. We always suggest our readers the same – restart your device every once in a while for better performance.</p>
      <h4>Solution 2: Background apps</h4>
      <p>As mentioned, the apps keep running in the background. It all affects battery life but not just that. A bunch of apps running can cause overheating and it can also have a negative impact on the overall performance. So, you can disable the apps from running in the background. It is a win-win – you will have more juice and your phone will work better. Go to Settings &gt; General &gt; Background app refresh. You can turn the option off for each app, or you can turn the feature off entirely. It is up to you.</p>
      <h4>Solution 3: Get rid of the apps you don’t use</h4>
      <p>It would be a good idea to remove the apps you don’t use any longer. If you have such apps, go to the Home screen, find the app, tap and hold it. It will jiggle and the X will appear. Tap on it to delete the app.</p>
      <h4>Solution 4: Update remaining apps</h4>
      <p>Developers are constantly improving their apps. Every once in a while, they add some new features, and they also fix issues users complain about. So, go to the App Store and choose the option to update all of the apps.</p>
      <h4>Solution 5: Bluetooth, GPS, Wi-Fi</h4>
      <p>These are the services that can drain your phone faster. We suggest you turn these off when they are not in use. You will have a lot more juice and your battery will last a lot longer between charges.</p>
      <h4>Solution 6: Display Auto-brightness</h4>
      <p>Another simple thing that can make a change is auto-brightness. To turn it on, follow the steps below:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Go to Settings</li>
        <li>Tap General</li>
        <li>Now tap Accessibility</li>
        <li>Display Accommodations</li>
        <li>Choose Auto-brightness</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Solution 7: Update the software</h4>
      <p>You need to make sure that you have the latest iOS version. To update the software, go to Settings &gt; General &gt; Software update. If there is a new version, tap Download and Install.</p>
      <h4>Solution 8: Low power mode</h4>
      <p>This handy feature came with iOS 9 and can be of great help when you don’t have a charger around. It will minimize the animations, reduce brightness, etc. To enable this feature, go to Settings &gt; Battery.</p>
