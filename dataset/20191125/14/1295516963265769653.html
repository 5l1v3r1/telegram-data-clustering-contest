      <h1>Mark Ruffalo Wants to Shoot a Hulk Vs. Wolverine Movie</h1>

      <p>While<i> <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/avengers-4/">Avengers: Endgame</a></i> seemingly brought <a href="https://screenrant.com/avengers-endgames-hulk-lou-ferrigno-disappointing/">The Hulk's story</a> to a close, actor Mark Ruffalo thinks there could be more in store for the Green Goliath.</p>
      <p>At Tokyo Comic Con, Ruffalo discussed meeting with Marvel Studios President and Marvel Chief Creative Officer Kevin Feige and added that he would really like to see a Hulk/Wolverine matchup on the big screen.</p>

      <p>Although the matchup might seem surprising to MCU fans, they have, in fact, crossed paths numerous times in the comics. In fact, Wolverine fought The Hulk and Wendigo in his first appearance in Len Wein, Roy Thomas and John Romita Sr.'s <i>The Incredible Hulk</i> #181 in 1974. While the character is most closely associated with <i>X-Men</i>, a crossover of this caliber could prove lucrative for fans of both franchises.</p>
