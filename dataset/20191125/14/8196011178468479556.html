      <p>Cork City council have issued a tidal flood alert due to a period of very high astronomical Spring Tides.</p>
      <p>The high tide is predicted for tomorrow at 4:50am and 5:13pm, as well as 5:34am on Wednesday, with a "significant risk" of tidal flooding in Cork city.</p>
      <p>The council warns that a tidal surge and periodic strong southerly/south-easterly winds are predicted over the next few days, and that these factors combined will result in tide levels higher than the natural tide levels.</p>
