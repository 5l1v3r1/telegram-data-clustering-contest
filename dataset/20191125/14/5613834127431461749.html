      <h1>‘State of Decay 2’ Coming to Steam in 2020</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T14:45:21+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 14:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/author/theaxegrinder/" target="_blank">Mike Wilson</a></address>
      <p>The wait for the Steam version of <b><i>State of Decay 2</i></b> now has an approximate release date. The Undead Labs zombie epic not only has a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/495420/State_of_Decay_2/">Steam page</a>, but lists the game having an “Early 2020” release date.</p>
      <p>The game will apparently support crossplay between Xbox One and Steam, but there’s no word on any of the already-released DLC for the Xbox One version of the game being included in the Steam version.</p>
      <p>More info on the Steam version is expected later today when Undead Labs hosts a livestream beginning at 3 pm PT/6 pm ET on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/undeadlabs">Twitch</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP2NOm_MoASfovXVY4nGvgQ">YouTube</a>.</p>
