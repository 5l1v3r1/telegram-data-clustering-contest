      <p>ATLANTA, Ga. – A Kennesaw State University women’s basketball player has been charged with murder in connection with a deadly shooting over the summer.</p>
      <p>The shooting happened in the early hours of July 16. Officers found the victim, 21-year-old Nashiem Hubbard-Etienne, dead in an Atlanta parking deck, <a href="https://www.cbs46.com/news/ksu-basketball-player-of-arrested-for-july-murder/article_40b59d0c-0e48-11ea-b31b-834160ea7536.html">WGCL reports.</a></p>
      <p>Kamiyah Street was arrested Thursday for his alleged involvement. In a statement obtained by WGCL, Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard Jr. said police identified Street as a suspect by reviewing surveillance video captured during the homicide. During questioning, Street admitted to her “presence and participation in the death of Hubbard-Etienne,” Howard Jr. wrote.</p>
      <p>Along with murder, Street is also being charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, and criminal attempt to commit armed robbery.</p>
      <p>The KSU Department of Athletics said Street has been suspended indefinitely from all athletic activities.</p>
      <p>Three other people were arrested Saturday in connection with the shooting. They’ve been identified as Cortez Devon Banks, Johnerton Gilstrap, and Tabias Raynard Wells.</p>
      <p>Police are still looking for a fifth suspect, Dontacus aka Dontavious Bradley. Anyone with information about his whereabouts should contact Atlanta police.</p>
