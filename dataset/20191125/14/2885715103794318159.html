      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T14:20:54+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 14:20</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/pti/" target="_blank">PTI</a></address>
      <p>Looking back at an incident that fuelled discussions over right to expression, veteran actor-director Amol Palekar says it was good that he was interrupted at an NGMA event earlier this year.</p>
      <p>The actor, who turned 75 on Sunday, said his comments weren’t about any particular political party as the establishment “will always try to curb opposition”.</p>
      <p>“Establishment never likes dissent; it will always try to curb opposition. However, the attack on our right to express has taken an ugly mode in the last five-six years.</p>
      <p>“I was trying to highlight certain wrong governmental decisions scarring the artistic freedom that we all enjoy. In the hindsight, it was good that I was interrupted several times because of which the issue was discussed even internationally,” he told PTI in an interview.</p>
      <p>In February, the Gol Maal actor was repeatedly interrupted during a speech at the National Gallery of Modern Art (NGMA) in Mumbai before being completely cut off when he criticised the government.</p>
      <p>Palekar had criticised the Ministry of Culture over its alleged decision to scrap the advisory committees of local artists at the gallery’s Mumbai and Bengaluru centres.</p>
      <p>He said it was his duty as an artiste to speak out against the “autocratic and undemocratic modus operandi” of the government.</p>
      <p>“I, as an artiste, ought to speak out against the autocratic and undemocratic modus operandi of the government – my fight is not against a particular party; it is against the ideology that will tear apart pluralism and the idea of India which we have nurtured over the years,” he said.</p>
      <p>The theatre-film actor recently made a comeback to the stage with “Kusur – The mistake”, which he said will be his last play, a “show stopper”.</p>
      <p>“I have no intention to keep on doing theatre. ‘Kusur’ is my show stopper. At my age, it is physically very demanding. Besides, I don’t know if I will be able to fulfil the audience’s expectations,” he said.</p>
