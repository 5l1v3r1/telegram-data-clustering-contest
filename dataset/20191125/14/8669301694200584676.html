      <h1>Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 wrap: Suryakumar, Padikkal impress again; Tamil Nadu, Haryana register wins</h1>

      <p>Captain Suryakumar Yadav blazed his way to an unbeaten 94 as Mumbai defeated Karnataka by seven wickets in the group B Super League match of the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy in Surat on Monday.</p>
      <p>Mumbai were chasing a stiff 172-run target and Suryakumar, who has been in fine form, single-handedly guided the domestic giants to victory with an over to spare.</p>
      <p>Suryakumar (94 not out off 53 balls, 11 fours, 4 sixes) walked in to bat after Mumbai were in a spot of bother at 44/2, losing openers Aditya Tare (12) and Prithvi Shaw (30) and still needing over 100 runs to win.</p>
      <p>The aggressive right-hander steadied the ship by stitching together a 46-run stand with Shreyas Iyer (14) for the third wicket. However, Karnataka pegged Mumbai back by removing Iyer in the eleventh over.</p>
      <p>After Iyer departed, Suryakumar toyed with the Karnataka bowlers, who wilted under his blistering attack. He hammered 11 fours and hoisted four towering sixes to stamp his class. His 53-ball 94 would have surely impressed the national selectors.</p>
      <p>The Mumbai captain then strung together a match-winning unbeaten 84-run stand for the fourth wicket with Shivam Dube (22 not out off 18 balls), who played second fiddle.</p>
      <p>Earlier, put into bat, Karnataka posted a healthy 171/6 despite losing in-form players KL Rahul (0) and skipper Manish Pandey (4) early.</p>
      <p>A strokeful 57 off 34 balls by opener Devdutt Padikkal, who struck four fours and as many sixes, along with a rearguard 71 off just 47 balls by Rohan helped Karnataka post a decent score on the board.</p>
      <p>Kadam was also all guns blazing as he hit seven fours and three sixes before falling to a catch by Prithvi Shaw off Shardul Thakur. For Mumbai, pacers Shardul Thakur (2/29), Shivam Dube (2/39) and left-arm spinner Shams Mulani (1/8) shared the spoils. This was Karnataka’s first defeat in the Super League stage, and Mumbai’s win has thrown the group wide open.</p>
      <p>In the second game, Haryana thrashed Baroda by six wickets and rode on fifties by Chaitanya Bishnoi (56) and Shivam Chauhan (50*) as they overhauled 139-run target with 15 balls to spare.</p>
      <p>Put into bat, barring veteran Yusuf Pathan (45*), no other Baroda batsman showed spine as Haryana restricted them to sub-par 138/5. In another game, Tamil Nadu beat Punjab by four wickets with spinners M Sai Kishore (3/10) and M Siddharth (3/9) spinning a web around the opposition batsmen.</p>
      <p>Punjab crawled to a below-par 94/8, courtesy Mayank Markande’s unbeaten 33, but Tamil Nadu manage to chase the target despite losing six wickets in the process.</p>
