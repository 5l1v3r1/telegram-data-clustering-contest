      <h1>‘The chosen one’: Rick Perry told Trump he was sent by God</h1>

      <p>Outgoing Energy Secretary Rick Perry, 69, said he told President Trump he’s “the chosen one.”</p>
      <p>Perry said Trump is not perfect but, “God’s used imperfect people all through history.”</p>
      <p>“King David wasn’t perfect. Saul wasn’t perfect. Solomon wasn’t perfect. I actually gave the president a little one-pager on those Old Testament kings about a month ago. I shared it with him. I said, ‘Mr. President, I know there are people that say, you know, you said you were the chosen one.’ And I said, ‘You were.’ If you’re a believing Christian, you understand God’s plan for the people who rule and judge over us on this planet in our government,” Perry told Fox News.</p>
      <p>Perry said he cautioned Trump not to get the impression that he was telling him that he was perfect.</p>
      <p>“God’s using you,” he said he told Trump.</p>
      <p>In August, Trump quipped that he was “<a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/trump-i-am-the-chosen-one-to-take-on-china">the chosen one</a>” while addressing the trade war with China.</p>
      <p>Perry told Trump last month <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/energy/rick-perry-resigns-as-energy-secretary-amid-ukraine-investigation">he is resigning</a> amid scrutiny about his role in the Trump administration’s conduct toward Ukraine.</p>
