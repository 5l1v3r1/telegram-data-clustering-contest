      <ul>
        <li>For a long time, if you wanted to find your favorite startup anywhere outside of its own website, you were out of luck.</li>
        <li>Slowly, they’re beginning to join online retailers like <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/target-startups-casper-quip-harrys-2018-10">Target</a> and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/nordstrom-startups-allbirds-dagne-dover-bombas-2019-1">Nordstrom</a> to make it easier for you to find and shop their innovative products.</li>
        <li><a href="https://amzn.to/2EqfeK9">Amazon</a> is another popular choice. It’s the most far-reaching and convenient platform for you to buy nearly anything you want.</li>
        <li>So if cool new mattresses, bedding and bath products, clothing, and accessories are on your list, go ahead and shop the following 15 startups on Amazon.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In the world of online retail in the US, you can’t get any bigger than <a href="https://amzn.to/2EqfeK9">Amazon</a>.</p>
      <p>As startups begin to look beyond their own websites and diversify their selling options, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/target-startups-casper-quip-harrys-2018-10">some choose Target</a> as their main traditional retailer, while <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/nordstrom-startups-allbirds-dagne-dover-bombas-2019-1">others flock to Nordstrom</a>, all in hopes of attracting a very specific type of customer.</p>
      <p>But the pure reach, convenience, and customer service army of Amazon make it the obvious choice for many startups. Some companies, like <a href="http://casper.pxf.io/c/196318/396851/7235?u=https%3A%2F%2Fcasper.com%2F">Casper</a>, are actually available on all three shopping sites, in addition to its own, an aggressive strategy that surely improves its brand exposure.</p>
      <p>Starting off on Amazon is a great stepping stone to more exposure and customers because the majority of online shoppers are already on Amazon. If they can shop interesting new products alongside the familiar brands and supplies they’re buying anyway, they will.</p>
      <p>It also helps that most of these startup products are available with <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-sign-up-for-prime">Prime shipping</a>, allowing them to bypass slower shipping speeds offered elsewhere.</p>
