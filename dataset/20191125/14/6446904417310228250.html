      <h1>'Bespoke plan' needed as Limerick hospital continues to break overcrowding record</h1>
      <h2>Some 85 patients were without beds in University Hospital Limerick this morning.</h2>

      <p>UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL LIMERICK has broken a record for the highest number of patients without a bed, according to a leading nursing union.</p>
      <p>Some 85 patients were without beds in University Hospital Limerick this morning, the highest figure ever recorded in an Irish hospital in a single day according to Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation (INMO) figures.</p>
      <p>The union has called for emergency funding to tackle the issue.</p>
      <p>In March, the INMO learned a ward in the hospital was to be closed, Ward 1A, used primarily for the treatment of  patients who require short periods of admission, causing the loss of 17 funded beds.</p>
      <p>A move that was described as “beggars belief” by local Sinn Fein TD Maurice Quinlivan, and one that the INMO warned would cause further overcrowding issues.</p>

      <p>Patients without beds are typically on chairs and trolleys, often in corridors lined along each wall without privacy and often in severe discomfort.</p>
      <p>In Limerick, there were 55 patients in the emergency department and 30 in wards elsewhere in the hospital.</p>
      <p>The INMO has called for a direct, immediate intervention in the hospital from senior HSE management, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Cancellation of non-essential elective work</li>
        <li>More home care packages to move patients out of the hospital</li>
        <li>Emergency funding for extra agency staff</li>
        <li>An immediate end to the recruitment ban for nurses and midwives</li>
        <li>Extra support for GPs and Public Health Nurses to allow more home/community treatment</li>
      </ul>
      <p>There are also a further 631 patients without beds across the country, 22 of them children.</p>

      <p>The other worst-hit hospitals include:   Cork University Hospital, 52, Letterkenny University Hospital, 47, Tallaght University Hospital, 36<br/>and University Hospital Galway, 33.</p>
      <p>INMO assistant director of Industrial Relations for the region, Mary Fogarty said:  “Despite the best efforts of local staff, the situation in Limerick continues to escalate.</p>
      <p>“The hospital is breaking records in the worst possible way.</p>
      <p>“Promises of future improvement will not suffice. Real action is needed today.</p>
      <p>“We simply do not have sufficient capacity.</p>
      <p>“Without an increase in beds and the professionals to staff them, this problem will continue to escalate.</p>
      <p>“Our members are on the frontline providing the best care they can but the situation is intolerable for them and unsafe for patients.”</p>
      <p>Alan Kelly TD, has called for a bespoke plan for the hospital.</p>
      <p>“This is not good enough for patients, staff and their families,” he said.</p>
      <p>“We need a specific plan for University Hospital Limerick.</p>
      <p>“The circumstances people are being left in are disgraceful.</p>
      <p>“Staff in UHL are over stretched, stressed  beyond words because of the recruitment ban the government continues to deny exists.”</p>
