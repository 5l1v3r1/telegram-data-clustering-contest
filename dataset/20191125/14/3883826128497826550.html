        <b>Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola has confirmed striker Sergio Aguero will be out "for a few weeks" with the thigh injury he sustained in Saturday's win against Chelsea.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Argentina striker Aguero, 31, hobbled off after 77 minutes <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/50443048">of the 2-1 victory.</a></p>
      <p>Aguero - who missed five games last term with a groin problem - has scored 13 goals in 16 games this season.</p>
      <p>"Sergio will be out for a few games," said Guardiola.</p>
      <p>The manager added Aguero will "need a miracle" to be fit for the Manchester derby on 7 December.</p>
      <p>Gabriel Jesus, who has featured mainly from the bench this season, is expected to feature more prominently during Aguero's absence.</p>
      <p>The Brazil international, who has scored five goals in 16 appearances, said: "I am not happy Sergio is injured.</p>
      <p>"I don't like it when my friends are injured, but every day I work hard and I am ready."</p>
      <p>Jesus is likely to lead the line when Manchester City host Shakhtar in the Champions League on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>City will qualify for the last 16 if they avoid defeat at the Etihad.</p>
      <p>"The position we have is good but we have not qualified yet," said Guardiola.</p>
      <p>"Tomorrow is a chance."</p>
      <h3>Injuries mounting for City</h3>
      <p>Aguero's injury is the latest for City, who are already without centre-back Aymeric Laporte, winger Leroy Sane and full-back Oleksandr Zinchenko.</p>
      <p>"It is what it is," Guardiola added.</p>
      <p>"I'd prefer to have everyone but my advice to the players and myself is not to think too much.</p>
      <p>"We have enough good players, enough quality and the mentality is going to give us extra and maybe it will help us."</p>
