        <b>A video where some students of the Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU) can be seen dancing during a class while their lecturer watches “helplessly” has surfaced online — and gone viral.</b>
      </p>
      <p>In the undated clip shared on Instagram by Naira Marley, Nigerian musician, students are seen gyrating excitedly to ‘Soapy’, one of the singer’s recent tracks, as the song blasts through the lecture hall’s speakers.</p>
      <p>The lecturer, who appears stunned by the incident, makes no effort to curtail the upheaval in the lecture room.</p>
      <p>“Guess what d lecturer’s thinking? #Marlians OAU,” Marley asked on the social media platform.</p>

      <p>While it remains unknown how the song got transmitted through the hall’s speakers, there is no gainsaying that quite a number of Nigerians are in love with ‘Soapy’.</p>
      <p>They are also a segment of music lovers who have condemned the song’s controversial dance step, which is done by imitating the act of masturbation.</p>
      <p>Kafayat Oluwatoyin Shafau, singer and choreographer better known as Kaffy, had once said <a href="https://lifestyle.thecable.ng/its-immoral-disgusting-kaffy-condemns-naira-marleys-soapy-dance/"><b>she has never seen</b> </a>“a more disgusting and immoral dance like the so-called Soapy.”</p>
      <p>“Am sorry but I can’t take this. In the history of Naija dance, I have never seen a more disgusting immoral dance like the so-called Soapy. It should never be encouraged. Am really disappointed,” she had written in July.</p>
