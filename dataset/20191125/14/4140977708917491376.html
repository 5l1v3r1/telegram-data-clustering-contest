When the two sides last met each other, it was Guyana who won the clash by 13 runs.

                              <b>USA</b>

                            <h3>USA vs GUY Dream11 Wicket-keepers</h3>
                            <p><b>Monank Patel</b> will be our only pick in this segment. He hasn’t been in the best of touches but has looked in good touches in patches. In the last match against Guyana, he scored a fluent 43. He will look to make an impact against Guyana later today.</p>
                            <h3>USA vs GUY Dream 11 Batsmen</h3>
                            <p><b>Tagenarine Chanderpaul</b> will be our first pick in this segment. He has been in good form in the tournament and is also a top-order batsman who gets his team off to good starts on most occasions. He scored 25 against Trinidad in the last match while scoring 64 and 40 against Windward Islands and USA respectively.</p>
                            <p><b>Leon Johnson</b> will be our 2<sup>nd</sup> pick in this segment. The left-handed batsman is a powerful striker of the ball and has already played for the national team in the past. He hasn’t scored too much in the last 3 matches but he should be defining the odds and look to score big later today.</p>
                            <p><b>Xavier Marshal</b> will be the next pick in this segment. He has also represented the national team in the past. Marshall scored a brilliant 79 against the Windward Islands and will look to continue his good run of form.</p>
                            <p><b>Jonathan Foo</b> will be the next pick due to his exceptional consistency in this tournament so far. He has scored 293 runs in the last 7 matches at an average of 58. He will definitely look to continue his good run of form.</p>
                            <h3>USA vs GUY Dream11 All-rounders</h3>
                            <p><b>Steven Taylor</b> will be the first pick in this segment. He is definitely a good option given his skill set as an all-rounder. He has scored some useful runs and has also been among the wickets in the tournament.</p>
                            <p><b>Chanderpaul Hemraj</b> will be a very important player for Guyana. He scored a brilliant century against the Windward Islands and has also been among wickets. Hemraj will definitely look to score big against a depleted USA side.</p>
                            <p><b>Chris Barnwell</b> will be the next pick in this segment. He has also done a good all-round job in this tournament. He scored 89 against Windward Island and 80 against USA when they met the last time around. Barnwell has also picked up some important wickets.</p>
                            <h3>USA VS GUY Dream 11 Bowlers</h3>
                            <p><b>Saurabh Netravalar</b> will be the first pick in this segment. He bagged 3 important wickets in the previous clash against Windwards Islands. He will be an important bowler for USA in today’s clash against Guyana.</p>
                            <p><b>Clinton Pestano</b> will be the 2<sup>nd</sup> bowler in this segment. He has been among the wickets all through the tournament and he will definitely look to make an impact for Guyana in an all-important clash.</p>
                            <p><b>Veerasammy Permaul</b> will be the last pick in our Dream 11 team. He has been a consistent wicket-taker for Guyana in the tournament so far and has also chipped in with some useful runs lower down the order.</p>
                            <h3>Captain and Vice-captain</h3>
                            <p>Jonathan Foo will be the captain of the day while Chris Barnwell will be the vice-captain for the day.</p>
