      <p><a href="https://www.magneticmag.com/tag/rza/">RZA</a> is here for the environment. He has launched a vegan winter jacket made from recycled ocean plastic.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.magneticmag.com/tag/wu-tang-clan/">Wu-Tang Clan</a> member has teamed up with <a href="https://www.magneticmag.com/tag/peta/">PETA</a> to make a new puffer jacket for the winter to keep you warm and feeling good about your shopping choices.</p>
      <p>“As we evolve as a people through technology and ingenuity, we have the ability through humane ways to fashion garments that not only serve our purpose but also, more importantly, abandon the unnecessary cruelty to animals,” RZA said in a statement. </p>
      <p>Inspired by 90’s puffer jackets, this uses recycled ocean plastic instead of geese down. The inside of the jacket is inspired by a wild weapon – the flying guillotine. The jacket is called the Flying Guillotine Puffer Jacket as the neck area reads “OUR HEADS NO LONGER BELONG TO US." </p>
      <p>Only 100 of these are available for <a href="https://36chambers.com/products/flying-guillotine-puffer-jacket">purchase</a> and cost $336 a piece.</p>
