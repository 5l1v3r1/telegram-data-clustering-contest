      <p>Clement Lenglet completed Monday's training session without any problems as Barcelona began to prepare for Wednesday's Champions League game against Borussia Dortmund.</p>
      <p>It's good news for Barça coach Ernesto Valverde, who already has a number of issues to deal with in defence due to injuries and suspensions.</p>
      <p>Lenglet was a last minute absentee from Saturday's win over Leganes. A calf problem forced him to withdraw from the squad, with Samuel Umtiti taking his place alongside Gerard Pique.</p>
      <p>However, Pique's suspended for the Dortmund game, meaning Valverde will need Lenglet to partner Umtiti.</p>
      <p>Full-backs Nelson Semedo and Jordi Alba are both injured, but Sergi Roberto is available for selection again after missing the game at Leganes suspended.</p>
