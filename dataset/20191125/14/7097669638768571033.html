      <p>Cairo (AFP) - An Egyptian Coptic rights activist is facing charges of joining a "terror" group and spreading misinformation, his lawyer confirmed Monday, amid a renewed crackdown on dissidents in the country.</p>
      <p>Ramy Kamel was arrested from his Cairo home early Saturday by seven plainclothes police officers, a member of his defence team, Atef Nazmy, told AFP.</p>
      <p>He said Kamel was questioned by state security prosecution until 10 pm (2000 GMT) and that his lawyers only managed to see him for the first time on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The prosecution has alleged Kamel joined a "terror" group, received foreign funding and broadcast false information.</p>
      <p>Kamel was set to be kept in temporary custody at Tora prison in southeast Cairo for 15 days, with further questioning scheduled for later this month.</p>
      <p>The vocal activist is a leading member of the Maspero Youth Union, a Coptic human rights organisation born in the wake of the January 2011 protests that toppled longtime ruler Hosni Mubarak.</p>
      <p>Coptic Christians, the largest non-Muslim religious minority in the Middle East, make up about 10-15 percent of Egypt's predominantly Sunni Muslim population of 100 million and have long faced sectarian discrimination.</p>
      <p>In recent years, the community has been targeted by a series of militant attacks, including by the Islamic State group.</p>
      <p>Emad Gad, a well-known Egyptian Coptic lawmaker and columnist, condemned the arrest, calling it "shocking".</p>
      <p>"Release Ramy Kamel... you have no proof that Ramy broke the law," he said on his Facebook page.</p>
      <p>Several activists noted online that Kamel had been sharing footage of sectarian violence in southern Egypt on social media, eliciting a warning from authorities.</p>
      <p>Copts are routinely forcibly evicted from their homes by their Muslim neighbours in southern Egypt, often with the authorities' tacit approval.</p>
      <p>The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom also denounced Kamel's detention on Sunday.</p>
      <p>"USCIRF is deeply alarmed by (the) arrest of Coptic activist Ramy Kamel," said a post on the government body's Twitter.</p>
      <p>"Egypt must... fulfil its claims of reform and steps toward religious freedom," it added, also criticising an "apparent renewed crackdown on activists and journalists" in the country.</p>
      <p>Since President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi led the military ouster of former Islamist president Mohamed Morsi in 2013, a crackdown has targeted activists, journalists and dissidents.</p>
      <p>Egypt police on Sunday raided, detained then released three editors at local news outlet Mada Masr after arresting another editor the day before.</p>
