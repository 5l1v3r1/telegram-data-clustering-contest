      <h1>Marcelo Bielsa admits he has not made friends with any rival managers in England</h1>
      <h2>Bielsa has been at Leeds for 18 months but says he is not pals with any of his rivals</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T14:34:31+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 14:34</time> by <a rel="author">David Anderson, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/david-anderson/</a></address>
      <p>Marcelo Bielsa has revealed he has not made friends with any rival managers in England.</p>
      <p>Bielsa has been at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leeds-united-fc">Leeds</a> for nearly 18 months and claims he is not pals with any other Championship coaches.</p>
      <p>The Leeds boss is not helped by his lack of English and his introspective personality.</p>
      <p>But he says he appreciates the warm words from Blackburn’s Tony Mowbray and Luton’s Graeme Jones after beating them in Leeds’ last two matches.</p>
      <p>“I don’t have a friend regarding managers,” admitted Bielsa.</p>

      <p>“But I value a lot what the Blackburn manager said about Leeds. Also I give more value to what he said about my behaviour.</p>
      <p>“The Luton manager, I see how every colleague reacts and when you lose a match two minutes before the end and you his reaction, I realise the integrity of the guy.</p>
      <p>“In general, what I have noticed regarding opposing managers are the positive things they have said about the work we are doing here.”</p>
      <p>Bielsa is more concerned about Leeds than making friends and feels they are still not clinical enough, despite sitting second in the table.</p>
      <p>The Argentinian insists they are not scoring enough goals considering the number of chances are creating.</p>
      <p>He is not satisfied with their return of 23 goals from 17 games and wants them to improve their conversion rate.</p>
      <p>“Yes, we lack efficiency when it comes to taking our chances,” he said.</p>

      <p>“In the last match, we needed 16 chances to score two goals and the opponent needed just four chances to score one.</p>
      <p>“That means we have a lot to develop yet in our offensive play while we are being punished for every mistake we make in defence.</p>
      <p>“What we have to improve is the final ball and we have to pay more attention when he we defend because our opponent needs fewer chances than us to score.”</p>
