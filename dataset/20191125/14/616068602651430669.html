      <p>A new Penticton business is picking up the pieces after being hit by a smash-and-grab burglary on Friday night. </p>
      <p>Busy Beans Play Cafe owner Tracey Wiseman says her business partner was called by the alarm company Friday night at about 9:45 p.m.</p>
      <p>“She checked the camera, and to her shock, she was like ‘oh my god, someone just threw a rock through our window,’” Wiseman said, explaining the other owner, Kim Wade, watched the whole burglary unfold live while she called police. </p>
      <p>The crook made a straight line to the cash register, pulling it and the shelf it was attached to completely off the point of sale terminal. </p>
      <p>The damage means the business — which offers an indoor playground for children and cafe for parents — is unable to accept debit for the time being. </p>
      <p>It’s been a rocky first year in business for Busy Beans, which is still recovering from a three-month closure earlier this year due to a flood. </p>
      <p>“We are really struggling, to have to fork out more out of our own pocket is really disheartening,” she said, explaining an insurance deductible for the break-in would be several thousand dollars. </p>
      <p>“It’s frustrating, really frustrating. To wonder who would target a kid’s play place — it’s disgusting, is what it is,” she said.</p>
      <p>The burglar left behind the large rock used to smash the front door, which Wiseman says they will likely be holding onto. </p>
      <p>“They [the burglar] have obviously been into the cafe and saw where we kept our drawer,” she said. “So you know what, this rock is going to be put up on the wall as a reminder ‘you didn’t knock us down.’”</p>
      <p>She said less than $150 would have been in the stolen cash drawer. </p>
      <p>Police are investigating and hopefully will be helped by surveillance footage of the burglar's car that was captured by a neighbouring business.</p>
