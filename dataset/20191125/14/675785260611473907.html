      <p>A dad killed himself after his ex-wife prevented him from seeing their two children leading to his mental health problems to "spiral", an <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/inquests">inquest</a> heard.</p>
      <p>Tragic Jamie Bull, 36, hanged himself at his home near Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, on March 5 this year.</p>
      <p>Just a few months earlier his ex-wife had stopped him from seeing their kids, the hearing was told.</p>
      <p>His girlfriend, Stephanie Clayton, told the court "it was the number one reason he was feeling the way he was".</p>
      <p>Mr Bull's brother, Chris, told Friday's hearing at Barrow Town Hall the ex-wife had "fought against him having access to his children".</p>
      <p>Chris said his brother was "good at hiding" his mental health issues.</p>

      <p>Miss Clayton claimed in the court that Mr Bull's ex used his mental health issues "against him" to prevent him seeing their kids.</p>
      <p>She said: "Child access only became an issue once his ex-wife found out about our relationship.</p>
      <p>"He only had very limited access. It hurt him a lot. He was devastated.</p>
      <p>"He left her because he was unhappy. He stayed for the children but when he did leave it was used against him time and time again.</p>
      <p>"His ex wasn't willing to communicate or reach any kind of compromise."</p>
      <p>Miss Clayton said Mr Bull was meant to have his children on Christmas Day but that his ex prevented that from happening.</p>
      <p>The inquest heard Mr Bull had an argument with his partner on the day of his death.</p>
      <p>His family became concerned for his welfare and went to his flat in Walney to check on him.</p>
      <p>Mr Bull's dad, Jim Bull, and stepmum, Nicola Bull, discovered his body.</p>
      <p>Jim desperately tried to resuscitate his son, but he was pronounced dead by paramedics a short time later.</p>
      <p>The grieving family were highly critical of an incident in October 2018 when Mr Bull was detained by police under the Mental Health Act.</p>
      <p>His stepmum Nicola told the inquest said: "We sat with him in the A&amp;E waiting area with two police officers, from 8am until 6pm."</p>
      <p>The inquest heard there had been no mental health beds available and so Mr Bull had to wait in A&amp;E until a doctor arrived.</p>
      <p>North Cumbria Integrated Care NHS Foundation Trust, which was responsible for acute mental health services when Mr Bull was detained in October 2018, carried out an investigation after his death which highlighted a number of lessons to be learned.</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman said: "We express our sincere condolences to the family and friends of Mr Bull at this difficult time.</p>
      <p>"The Trust is not able to comment on this case at this time."</p>
