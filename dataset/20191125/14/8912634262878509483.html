      <p>WASHINGTON: Qatar and Kuwait have told the US that they will join a US-led naval coalition in the Gulf which was established in response to a series of attacks on oil tankers, a US military official said on Monday.<br/>The coalition, based out of Bahrain and known as the International Maritime Security Construct (IMSC), was formed after a series of attacks earlier this year heightened the risk of disruption to Gulf oil exports shipped through the Strait of Hormuz.<br/>The US has blamed the attacks on Iran, which Tehran denied.<br/>"Qatar and Kuwait have already told us they are going to join, so it is just a matter of time," said US Army Colonel John Conklin, chief of staff of the coalition.<br/>Conklin said they were expected to provide personnel and patrol boats.<br/>Albania, Australia, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and the UK have joined.<br/>At the same time, France is spearheading a European-led mission independent of the US-led maritime initiative, which some European countries feared would make US-Iranian tensions worse.<br/>"To my knowledge, nobody has joined (the French) coalition yet and they've been trying for a while but they haven't been very successful," Conklin said.</p>
