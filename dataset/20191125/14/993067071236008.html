      <p>A man has been found unanimously not guilty of raping a 17-year-old in the bedroom of a hotel they shared during a holiday in Spain.</p>
      <p>Following just 28 minutes of deliberations, a jury at Derry Crown Court acquitted Michael Cregan (35), from Ferguson Street in the city, of a single charge of rape.</p>
      <p>The complainant alleged that he raped her as she slept, following a day's drinking, in the room they shared with two other adults in the resort of Torremolinos in August 2014.</p>
      <p>The defendant told the jury that they twice had consensual intercourse on the night in question.</p>
      <p>It was the first case of its kind in the north in which a UK resident went on trial for an offence allegedly committed outside the jurisdiction.</p>
      <p>Following the not guilty verdict, Judge Philip Babington told the defendant he was free to go.</p>
      <p>Members of the complainant's family were visibly upset when the jury forewoman announced the not guilty verdict.</p>
