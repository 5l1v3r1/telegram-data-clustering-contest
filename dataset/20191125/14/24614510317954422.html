      <h1>Walmart Stalled After Earnings, but the Holidays Could Push it Higher</h1>
      <h2>Retail still looks good in the fourth quarter</h2>

      <p>While there are still some trouble spots in the market, retail spending and consumption look strong, as we mentioned in our <a href="https://investorplace.com/2019/11/nikes-strong-brand-will-help-its-holiday-performance/">recommendation on <b>Nike</b></a> (NASDAQ:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/nke-stock-quote/"><b><u>NKE</u></b></a>). Earnings in this critical sector have generally exceeded expectations, which could keep the major market indexes above water through the end of the year.</p>
      <p><b>Target’s</b> (NYSE:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/tgt-stock-quote/"><b><u>TGT</u></b></a>) earnings report last week included a particularly promising outlook for this holiday season. In fact, we would normally look for a new entry point on TGT after a report like this, but the options on the stock are strangely underpriced. We can get a better return by setting up a bullish trade on <b>Walmart, Inc. </b>(NYSE:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/wmt-stock-quote/"><b><u>WMT</u></b></a>), where the same underlying fundamentals are likely to keep the stock above support.</p>
      <p>We recommend trading the situation with a bullish put write on WMT.</p>
      <h3>Taking Advantage of Timing Issues</h3>
      <p>When WMT reported earnings on Nov. 14, its outlook was similar to TGT’s, with extremely promising growth from online sales. At the time, the stock rallied to a record high, but it pulled back because of trade-related fears and generally poor performance in the market later that same day.</p>
      <p>On Nov. 14, the first phase of the U.S.-China trade negotiations had hit a snag because of China’s hesitation to commit to buying $50 billion worth of agricultural products from the U.S. annually. This came after the debate over whether or not the U.S. would lift all tariffs on Chinese goods had already created a stir. Trade was in doubt, and that may have suppressed the performance of the retail sector.</p>
      <p>We believe WMT’s performance issue was one of timing. Similar situations in the past have resulted in strong support and higher prices in the short term as investors re-evaluate the good news.</p>
      <h3>Taking Advantage With an Aggressive Strike Price</h3>
      <p>As you can see in the chart below, WMT is trending sideways in a rising “wedge” technical pattern. When it appears in a bullish trend like this, a rising wedge usually indicates additional upside potential.</p>

      <h4>Daily Chart of Walmart, Inc. (WMT) — Chart Source: TradingView</h4>
      <p>We prefer to open this position with short puts because we collect instant income and the put write provides a hedge if the overall market is uncooperative.</p>
      <p>However, because we are quite bullish on the stock, we recommend using an aggressive strike price just above trendline support and near the current price of the stock — $119. This increases the income earned from the trade and our potential gain.</p>
      <p>With such an aggressive strike price, it is important that traders don’t over commit with an expiration that is too far out. You don’t want to give WMT a chance to pull back before you’ve collected your profits.</p>
