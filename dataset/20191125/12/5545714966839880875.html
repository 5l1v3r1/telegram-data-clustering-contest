      <h1>The best Devil May Cry game is coming to Switch in February 2020</h1>

      <p>Although several platforms already got their full "all in one" HD trilogy package for <i>Devil May Cry</i>, Capcom is trying something different for the Switch.</p>
      <p>Instead, the publisher is opting to release them individually on the eShop, charging $20 a pop. It's a bold move and a stark contrast to the HD Collection proper, which is $20 total brand new for all three games: but this is Capcom we're talking about, and they can't have a perfect year despite killing it with <i>Monster Hunter Iceborne</i>, the <i>Resident Evil 2</i> remake and other projects.</p>
      <p>Nope, it's still going to be $20, but the good news is the best game is finally hitting Switch on February 20, 2020. In case you haven't been following the series this classic action romp serves as a prequel and manages to still hold up as one of the greatest action games of all time: if not the greatest (<i>Bayonetta</i> has given it a run for its money for me, but it's still in the top five).</p>
      <p>Yes, it will be the Special Edition of <i>Devil May Cry 3</i>, which has one of the best extras in the series: a playable Vergil.</p>
