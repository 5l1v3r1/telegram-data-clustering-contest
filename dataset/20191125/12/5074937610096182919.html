      <h1>Use money wisely - Rev Offei</h1>

      <p>Accra, Nov 25, GNA - Use money wisely to make friends in Heaven by investing in God’s work”,Reverend Emmanuel Offei of the Resurrection Power and Living Bread Ministries International has advised.</p>
      <p>He said every Christian should cultivate the habit of giving to support God’s work because money was needed to advance the course of the Gospel.</p>
      <p>“Not everyone can become an Evangelist or Pastor. This is why you need to use your money to support those who have taken it upon themselves to do God’s work. Through your giving, someone would be able to hear the Gospel and be saved” he stated.</p>
      <p>Delivering the sermon on “The Parable of the Shrewd Steward,” he quoted from the scriptures saying, “I tell you, use worldly wealth to gain friends for yourselves, so that when it is gone, you will be welcomed into eternal dwellings.</p>
      <p>Whoever can be trusted with very little can also be trusted with much, and whoever is dishonest with very little will also be dishonest with much.”</p>
      <p>Rev Offei said a shrewd person acted with foresight and looked beyond the present situation.</p>
      <p>“Shrewd people always have the future in mind and make arrangements to secure themselves ahead of time”</p>
      <p>He advised the congregation not to depend solely on their riches because even though money made a lot of things possible, it still had limits and could easily fail.</p>
      <p>Rev Offei therefore urged them to reduce the use of money on unfruitful ventures and rather channel it towards God’s work.</p>
      <p>“Whatever you have today is by God’s grace and not by any ability of yours. If you are faithful with the little you have, you would equally be faithful with much.</p>
      <p>It’s not about the amount you can give, it’s about your faithfulness and willingness. Character is very necessary when it comes to giving,” he added.</p>
