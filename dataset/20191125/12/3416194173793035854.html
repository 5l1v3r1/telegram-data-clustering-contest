      <p><a href="http://www.justjaredjr.com/tags/ally-brooke/"><b>Ally Brooke</b></a> and <a href="http://www.justjaredjr.com/tags/sasha-farber/"><b>Sasha Farber</b></a> brought us a P-A-R-T-Y on the <a href="http://www.justjaredjr.com/tags/dancing-with-the-stars"><b><i>Dancing with the Stars</i></b></a> season 28 finale tonight (November 25)!</p>
      <p>The 26-year-old singer and <b>Sasha </b>wowed on the dance floor for the final night of the season, and performed to “Conga” by<b> Gloria Estefan &amp; Miami Sound Machine</b>.</p>
      <p>They earned 30 points, making their total for the night 60 points.</p>
      <p>“Man, I just feel so incredible. And I’m beyond excited,” <b>Ally </b><a href="https://www.etonline.com/dwts-hannah-brown-kel-mitchell-lauren-alaina-and-ally-brooke-tease-how-they-plan-to-win-exclusive">teased</a>. “We want this to feel like a party where everybody’s invited, and we’re out there, like, baring it all, our souls, and having the time of our lives. Paying tribute to this amazing show, our amazing journey. And we’re out there just literally celebrating every single second. And having a blast!”</p>
      <p><b>Sasha </b>added, “I’ve never won, but I feel like I’ve already won with this one, because she’s incredible. I’ve said before, it’s weird we have never had an argument. We have never, for like 13 weeks. We’re always on the same page, same dreams, same road and on the same drive, so it’s been incredible.”</p>
      <p>This week, the live vote (via abc.com, the ABC app and SMS/text) will be combined with the judges’ scores and tabulated in real time, determining the “Dancing” champion. To help <b>Ally</b> and <b>Sasha</b> win, text LAUREN to 21523!</p>
