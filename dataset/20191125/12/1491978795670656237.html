        <li>Trump’s ex-press secretary says: ‘I was attacked for everything’</li>
        <li>Sanders admitted Comey statement was ‘founded on nothing’</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Sarah Sanders, the former White House press secretary who admitted to Robert Mueller that she lied to reporters, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/24/us/politics/sarah-sanders-arkansas-governor.html">told the New York Times</a>: “I don’t like being called a liar.”</p>
      <p>At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvkLKF07-vQ">a White House briefing on 10 May 2017</a>, Sanders told reporters “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/apr/18/mueller-report-press-secretary-sarah-sanders-lying-comey">countless members of the FBI</a>” had told her they had lost confidence in James Comey, the FBI director fired by Trump shortly before.</p>
      <p>Mueller, the special counsel, was appointed in the aftermath of Comey’s firing to investigate Russian election interference and links between Trump and Moscow.</p>
      <p>In <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/04/19/sarah-sanders-lied-according-mueller-report-shes-calling-it-slip-tongue/">the words of his report</a>, <a href="https://www.commoncause.org/resource/read-the-mueller-report/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIg7m22q6F5gIVRrDtCh2qLg3PEAAYASAAEgKlpvD_BwE">released</a> in April 2019: “Sanders told this office that her reference to hearing from ‘countless members of the FBI’ was a ‘slip of the tongue’.</p>
      <p>“She also recalled that her statement in a separate press interview that rank-and-file FBI agents had lost confidence in Comey was a comment she made ‘in the heat of the moment’ that was not founded on anything.”</p>
      <p>Sanders, Trump’s second press secretary, presided over the apparent death of the press briefing and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/13/sarah-sanders-leaves-trump-white-house-stands-down-press-secretary-role">left the White House in June this year</a>. She is now home in Arkansas, where her father Mike Huckabee was governor, a post from which he mounted two runs for the Republican presidential nomination.</p>
      <p>She told the Times: “There are two types of people who run for office. People that are called and people that just want to be a senator or governor. I feel like I’ve been called.”</p>
      <p>Sanders seems to be targeting the governorship in 2022, when Asa Hutchinson’s time is up.</p>
      <p>“It’s the role I’ve been pushed into,” Sanders said. “I wouldn’t want to do that if I wasn’t the right person to fit what the state needed at that time.”</p>
      <p>Sanders also told the Times that at local events, she was “just excited to have people clap when I come up to a podium. It’s very different from what I’m used to.”</p>
      <p>One voter in Hot Springs, Arkansas, told the Times: “The main thing I like about her is her honesty. She got a bad rap because people are offended that she does tell the truth. I’m 100% behind her.”</p>
      <p>Sanders also discussed her treatment by the press, opponents of Trump (including those who famously <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/23/trump-press-secretary-sarah-sanders-ejected-virginia-restaurant-red-hen-lexington">asked her to leave a restaurant in Virginia</a>) and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/29/white-house-correspondents-dinner-michelle-wolf-stuns-media-with-sarah-sanders-attack">a comedian at the White House Correspondents’ Dinner</a>.</p>
      <p>“I was attacked for everything, not just my performance,” Sanders said. “I was called a fat soccer mom, my kids were threatened, my life was threatened. It was a lot. I hate harping on it, but to be in the position I’m in and to have Secret Service, that’s not normal.”</p>
      <p>After a pause, the Times said, Sanders added: “I don’t like being called a liar. The other stuff bothered me far less.”</p>
      <p>Discussing Trump’s prospects for re-election, Sanders said she intended to help with the campaign, which, should Trump win or lose, would help her own ambitions: “If he wins, there’s a solid base and people will come in and be helpful. If he loses, people will be angry and they will want to rally around Trump people.”</p>
      <p>The interview took place last Tuesday, the day of Lt Col Alexander Vindman’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/19/trump-impeachment-inquiry-alexander-vindman">testimony to the impeachment hearings</a>. Sanders would not discuss the matter on record with a paper her former boss has targeted with consistent invective and abuse.</p>
      <p>But the same day, she told Fox &amp; Friends: “None of this matters. It’s a huge waste of time.”</p>
      <p>Sanders also told the Times: “All I can say is thank God I’m back in Arkansas.”</p>
