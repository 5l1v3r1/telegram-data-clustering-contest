      <p><b>Controversial Nigerian cross dresser and rumoured gay man, Idris Okuneye, popularly known as Bobrisky, has taken to social media to speak on being friends with Nollywood actress, <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1274803-tonto-dikeh-shows-off-the-interiors-of-bobriskys-house.html">Tonto Dikeh</a></b>.</p>
      <p>The actress and <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1089003-bobriskys-pictures-appearance-changed.html">Bobrisky</a> have continued to serve bestie goals all over the internet, leaving a lot of people filled with admiration and some others, with envy. For this set of people, Bobrisky had a few words.</p>
      <p>In an Instagram post which appears to have been either deleted or archived, he wrote about how some people were looking forward to the day he and Dikeh will fight. According to him, even if they fight, he won't make it a public affair.</p>
      <p>Sharing a cute photo with her, he wrote: <i>"I was on my phone when Tonto took dis picture last night It’s so cute. Each time I post Tonto, I read lot of funny comments from some jobless fools, saying I’m waiting for d day both of you will fight. Yes, we might have disagreements because no man is perfect but trust me even if we have disagreements you will never hear pim from my mouth. Dis is a promise to you all waiting for d fight day."</i></p>

      <p>His post comes barely a few hours after Nollywood actress and also a friend to the duo, <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1278509-anita-joseph-shares-video-calling-friend-uche-elendu-betraying-her.html">Anita Joseph, took to Instagram to call out her best friend, Uche Elendu.</a></p>
      <p>The actress said her best friend and colleague betrayed her and caused an unnecessary fight. The actress explained that Elendu got angry after she advertised hair for a hair vendor. She said Elendu claimed that her doing the advert would make people think that the hair she sells is not original.</p>
