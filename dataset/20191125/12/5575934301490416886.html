      <p>Sen. Elizabeth Warren has blasted Adam Neumann’s <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/wework-ex-employee-sues-adam-neumann-2-billion-leaving-deal-2019-11-1028675038">$US1.7 billion golden parachute</a>, criticising the WeWork cofounder and former CEO’s lavish leaving package as the troubled coworking startup prepares to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/wework-lays-off-2400-employees-2019-11">slash its global headcount</a> by about a fifth.</p>
      <p>“WeWork is laying off 2,400 employees – while its founder walks away with a massive $US1.7 billion golden parachute,” <a href="https://twitter.com/ewarren/status/1197878963168858112">the Democratic presidential candidate tweeted on Friday</a>. “This is another example of a rigged and corrupt system.”</p>
      <p>Neumann is poised to net up to $US970 million by selling WeWork stock to SoftBank during a tender offer set to begin this week,<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-softbank-group-wework-offer/softbank-to-go-ahead-with-wework-stock-tender-offer-this-week-idUSKBN1XY0OZ">Reuters reported on Sunday</a>, citing two people familiar with the matter. His exit deal includes $US185 million in consultancy fees over the next four years as well.</p>
      <p>SoftBank also granted Neumann a $US500 million personal credit line, from which he has already drawn about $US400 million, according to Reuters. Neumann must use any proceeds from the tender offer to pay back the Japanese conglomerate, Reuters reported.</p>
      <p>The tender offer is part of a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/softbank-agrees-to-rescue-wework-in-a-bailout-deal-2019-10">$US9.5 billion rescue deal</a> that SoftBank struck with WeWork last month. It’s been delayed by more than two weeks as the company tried to make technical changes to its offer, Reuters reported.</p>
      <p>Some SoftBank executives looked at ways to shrink the size of the bailout as they viewed Neumann’s leaving package as <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/wework-adam-neumann-1-7-billion-golden-parachute-softbank-costs-2019-11-1028710846">too generous</a>, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-21/softbank-execs-discuss-trimming-wework-offer-and-neumann-payout">Bloomberg reported</a>. However, they didn’t talk about altering the deal’s terms with WeWork, Reuters said.</p>
      <p>WeWork <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/weworks-nightmare-ipo-2019-9">pulled the plug on its IPO</a> in September after investors railed against its mounting losses, dubious business model, questionable governance, and Neumann’s controversial behaviour and tight grip on the company.</p>
      <p>Running short of cash, it accepted a bailout from SoftBank, which is now working to overhaul its business.</p>
