      <p>Bollywood great Lata Mangeshkar, who was admitted to hospital two weeks ago, is "doing very good", her niece said on Monday but did not clarify when she will return home.</p>
      <p>Mangeshkar, 90, was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit of Breach Candy Hospital after she complained of difficulty in breathing on November 11. She was put on a ventilator.</p>
      <p>It was not clear whether Mangeshkar was still in the ICU and still hooked on to a ventilator.</p>
      <p>Hospital sources were unavailable for comment despite several attempts to contact them.</p>
      <p>"She is doing very good. We are happy," Mangeshkar's niece Rachana Shah told PTI.</p>
      <p>Asked when Mangeshkar would be discharged from hospital, Shah said, "Discharge time frame is presently not important. What's important is how well she is recovering."<br/><br/>In her over seven-decade career, Mangeshkar has sung more than 30,000 songs across languages.</p>
      <p>She is considered one of the greatest playback singers in Indian cinema. She received the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour, in 2001.</p>
