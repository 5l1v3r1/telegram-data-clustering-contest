      <p>WWE <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/wwe-survivor-series">Survivor Series 2019</a> was a fantastic show and a great night for fans of NXT. The Black and Yellow brand left with the bragging rights meaning it's groundhog day for RAW and SmackDown. What fallout can we expect on WWE RAW tonight? How will the Superstars of the Red brand react?</p>
      <p>Apart from Survivor Series fallout, <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/wwe">WWE</a> could also have a number of surprises up their sleeve for tonight's episode of RAW, including a couple of big returns.</p>
      <h4>#5 The Kabuki Warriors blindside Charlotte Flair again</h4>

      <p>The RAW women's team looked to be in a good position at Survivor Series until an incident between Asuka and <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/charlotte-flair">Charlotte Flair </a>derailed their momentum. Asuka had just pinned SmackDown star, Dana Brooke, when Charlotte Flair tagged herself in, much to Asuka's consternation.</p>
      <p>For a moment, it looked like Asuka had walked out on her team, only for her to return and hit Charlotte Flair with the green mist. This blinded Flair and allowed Lacey Evans of SmackDown to hit her with the Women's Right and pin her. The match was eventually won by Team NXT.</p>
      <p>Charlotte cannot be happy after how things went down at Survivor Series and will be looking for revenge on RAW tonight. While most of us expect Charlotte to get some modicum of revenge, WWE could surprise us all by booking things slightly differently.</p>
      <p>WWE could book Asuka and Kairi Sane to take out Charlotte again which could lead to a storyline where Flair finds a partner to challenge the Kabuki Warriors for their WWE Women's Tag-Team Championship.</p>
