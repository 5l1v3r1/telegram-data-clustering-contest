      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T12:00:16+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 12:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://leaderpost.com/author/jackerman55" target="_blank">Jennifer Ackerman</a></address>
      <p>From lead service connections to off-leash dog parks, here’s a look at what’s coming up at city council this week.</p>
      <h3>Notice of Motion to accelerate the Lead Service Connection Management Program</h3>
      <p><a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/local-news/regina-mayor-and-council-drafting-motion-to-fast-track-lead-service-connection-replacement-program">Mayor Michael Fougere will submit a notice of motion Monday night that proposes accelerating the Lead Service Connection Management Program</a> to ensure replacements are complete by 2025.</p>
      <p>The motion is in light of a <a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/saskatchewan/parched-experts-urge-transparency-on-lead-tainted-water-in-some-regina-saskatoon-and-moose-jaw-homes">recent investigative news report that revealed high levels of lead-tainted water in some Regina homes.</a></p>
      <p>It also proposes expanding the program to include replacement of the homeowner’s side of the connection and creating a support program that would see the city paying part of all of the costs of replacement up front so residents could repay over time.</p>
      <p>If approved, it would also extend the free lead water filter program from one to three years, direct the city to add orthophosphate to the water supply to mitigate lead content in water and enhance communication with homeowners about lead connections and their potential impacts.</p>
      <p>The notice of motion will be introduced Monday, but not discussed until the following regularly scheduled city council meeting.</p>

      <h3>City moves on promise to add more off-leash dog parks</h3>
      <p>In early November, the Community and Protective Services Committee agreed that council should consider funding the construction of one municipal off-leash dog park and up to two unfenced neighbourhood off-leash sites through the 2020 budget process.</p>
      <p>This comes after a push from local residents prompted council to direct administration to bring forward a report by the end of the year with a plan to consult and implement more off-leash dog parks in the city.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/local-news/frustrated-residents-councillors-urge-city-to-move-faster-on-off-leash-dog-parks">But Connie Buchan, who represents OLDPUG (off-leash dog park user group), says it’s not entirely what off-leash advocates had in mind.</a>
      </p>
      <p>Happy to some progress, she said a single additional dog park isn’t enough and that unfenced off-leash sites is not something they’ve asked for or would use.</p>
      <p>“With the number of rabbits in Regina it would be all too easy for a dog to see one and be off and running into neighbourhoods, traffic and adjoining property which could easily be open fields,” said Buchan in her written submission.</p>
      <p>There are currently two dedicated off-leash dog parks and several boarded rinks that serve as seasonal off-leash sites in Regina.</p>
      <p>While several potential sites have been identified by administration, they are recommending council approve a municipal level off-leash park be established at Mount Pleasant. This would be in addition to a neighbourhood level off-leash dog park already approved in the Regent Par 3 redesign. They are also recommending two three-year pilot projects for unfenced off-leash parks at 4927 Pasqua Street and Iannone Park.</p>

      <h3>Residents speak up in support of changes to Board of Police Commissioners</h3>
      <p>Two delegations are scheduled to speak in support of <a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/local-news/city-councillors-calling-for-better-representation-on-board-of-police-commissioners">a motion brought forward by two city councillors calling for more civilian members on the Board of Police Commissioners.</a></p>
      <p>“We have a Board of Police Commissioners that is not challenging police when they need to be challenged,” said Bob Hughes with the Saskatchewan Coalition Against Racism in his written submission. “If there are to be changes to the Board’s structure, I ask that you consider not just adding a few more people, but that you consider WHO those people are.”</p>
      <p>Hughes argues that having only one spot on the board reserved for an Indigenous person is not enough and that with the growing number of newcomers in Regina, the board must diversify.</p>
      <p>Michelle Stewart, an associate professor at the University of Regina, agreed that the motion as is, isn’t enough.</p>
      <p>“The Board needs more than a change in composition,” Stewart wrote in her submission. “It needs to review its mandate and take on a new role that pushes for accountability.”</p>
      <p>The motion was initiated by Ward 4 Coun. Lori Bresciani and Ward 3 Coun. Andrew Stevens and asks for a report from administration in early 2020 that outlines the process for expanding the board and compares the ratio of elected members to citizen members with other major cities.</p>
      <h3>Regina Police Service submits 2020 operating and capital budget</h3>
      <p>The Regina Police Service (RPS) has submitted its 2020 operating and capital budget to city council and administration for review.</p>
      <p>It asks for a net operating budget of $85,629,300 and a capital budget of $3,998,700 be approved.</p>

      <p>Among other things, the budget allows for the addition of four more frontline constables, and six more civilian positions, including two dispatchers, a communications strategist, an intelligence strategist, a psychologist and digital media assistant. It also includes a $600,000 increase for the for the Community Policing Initiative, which in 2020 will fund the Grey Cup special duty assignments and equipment.</p>
      <p>At an Oct. 15 meeting, the Board of Police Commissioners recommended the budget be approved. According to administration’s report, the proposed budget is based on a “thorough review of challenges and opportunities.”</p>
      <p>“Spending has been reduced where possible and to contain increases to the amount absolutely needed,” it says.</p>
      <p><a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/local-news/regina-proposed-budget-would-hike-taxes-3-25-for-2020">The city’s proposed 2020 budget recommends $3.6 million boost for the RPS, which results in a total of $96 million</a> — or about 20 per cent of the general fund budget.</p>
      <p>The report will be tabled until the Dec. 9 city council meeting when budget deliberations are set to take place.</p>
      <h3>Side note: New Zoning Bylaw gets conditional approval from province</h3>
      <p>Last week, the city received word that the new Zoning Bylaw has been conditionally approved by the Saskatchewan Ministry of Government Relations.</p>
      <p>The ministry calls for two amendments before the bylaw goes into effect including adding sign regulations to the Zoning Bylaw rather than in a separate bylaw (the proposed Regina Sign Bylaw).</p>
      <p>It also asks that the boundaries known as the Floodway Fringe be reinserted into the maps section of the Zoning Bylaw within six months of ministry approval.</p>
      <p>Administration will bring forward the amendments at the Dec. 16 city council meeting where it will propose copying all applicable sign regulations from the Sign Bylaw to the Zoning Bylaw, returning sidewalk sign regulations to the Regina Clean Property Bylaw and repealing the proposed Regina Sign Bylaw, 2019.</p>
      <p>If council approves the amendments, <a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/local-news/zoning-bylaw-rail-relocation-what-wrapped-up-at-city-council-this-week">the new Zoning Bylaw would go into effect on Dec. 21, 2019.</a> It will apply to all applications submitted after Dec. 21.</p>
