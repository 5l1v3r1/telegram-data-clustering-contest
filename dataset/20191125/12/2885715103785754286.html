      <p>Malayalam actor Shane Nigam has got a trendy new haircut. There are several pictures of Shane’s new hairdo doing the rounds on social media. In the pictures, the actor sports a flat-top haircut. He has also opted for a clean-shaven look coupled with a goatee. However, Shane’s new look has upset many in the Malayalam film industry.</p>
      <p>According to reports, the 23-year-old actor is believed to have gone for a makeover after a tiff with the makers of upcoming film Veyil.</p>
      <p>Last month, Shane Nigam claimed he received death threats from producer Joby George of Goodwill Entertainments for “slightly trimming his hair.” The actor was required to maintain a certain density of hair and beard until he finished shooting for Veyil. But he trimmed his hair to start shooting for Qurbaani. After a war of words between the actor and the producer, the issue was taken to the Kerala Film Producers’ Association (KFPA). Both the parties reached an agreement with Shane agreeing not to cut his hair before he completes the film.</p>
      <p>A few days ago, however, Veyil director Sarath Menen made complaints against Shane. He accused the actor of not cooperating with the film crew.</p>
      <p>“Shane had been very uncooperative on the sets of the movie. He never came on time. Though the first day of the shoot went well, Shane began arriving on the sets very late from the second day onwards. The entire set had been waiting from 4 am to film a scene that had to be shot early morning. However, Shane reached only after 6.30 am. Later I had to set up a separate frame for that scene,” the director told Manorama News.</p>
      <p>According to reports, Shane even bad-mouthed Sarath in an Instagram post that has since been removed.</p>
      <p>In a series of <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/facebook/">Facebook</a> posts, Shane has claimed that he was made to work about 10 to 16 hours every day.</p>
      <p>In the light of the controversy, the executive members of KFPA have decided not to extend cooperation to Shane in future.</p>
