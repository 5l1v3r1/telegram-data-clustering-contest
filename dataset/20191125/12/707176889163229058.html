      <h2>Debt deal potentially worth $6bn would double last year’s total dollar issuance</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T12:20:35+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 12:20</time> by <a rel="author">George Hammond, Hudson Lockett</a></address>
      <p>China is preparing to launch its largest ever dollar bond, in a move that could double last year’s issuance and help slake global investor demand for higher-yielding dollar debt.</p>
      <p>The government bond offering could raise as much as $6bn, people familiar with the deal said. They said the issuance, which would mark the biggest dollar offering on record by China’s Ministry of Finance, according to Dealogic data, could hit the market as early as Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Yields on China’s 10-year US dollar sovereign bonds were just shy of 3.2 per cent on Friday, compared with yields of less than 1.8 per cent for US Treasuries of the same maturity.</p>
      <p>One banker working on the deal said the size of the offering reflected high demand for increased liquidity among large institutional investors and Beijing’s view that dollar issuance in recent years had helped to establish a benchmark for other borrowers and investors.</p>
      <p>“The size is twice what it was last year, that just speaks to the fact that the past two years have been perceived as successful by the Ministry of Finance,” the banker said. He added that previous offers were “not enough to match demand”.</p>
      <p>The dollar debt deal comes after the finance ministry sold a trio of euro-denominated <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/451717e4-0057-11ea-b7bc-f3fa4e77dd47">government bonds</a> earlier this month for the first time in 15 years, raising a total of €4bn.</p>
      <p>That offering attracted close to €20bn of orders from investors. The issuance helped to set a new price benchmark after the maturity of the last euro-denominated sovereign bond issued in 2004.</p>
      <p>After a 15-year hiatus, China returned to the dollar bond market in 2017 with an offer of $2bn, Dealogic data show. The country followed that up in October 2018 with an offering of $3bn, again selling bonds with maturities of five, 10 and 30 years.</p>
      <p>Joint lead managers and joint bookrunners for the upcoming deal are Bank of China, Bank of Communications, China Construction Bank, China International Capital Corporation, Bank of America, Crédit Agricole, CTBC Bank, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, JPMorgan, Mizuho Securities and Standard Chartered, according to a term sheet viewed by the Financial Times.</p>
      <p>Investor appetite for China’s central government debt contrasts with new difficulties faced by a local government-run company in repaying its own dollar debt.</p>
      <p>On Friday the Tianjin-based company, Tewoo Group, told investors in an <a href="https://links.sgx.com/FileOpen/Hope%20IV%20%20SGXST%20announcement%20on%20the%20Exchange%20Offer_English.ashx?App=Announcement&amp;FileID=587173">exchange filing</a> that they could either take delayed repayment and reduced interest payments on $1.25bn in dollar bonds, or accept repayment between 33 and 64 per cent lower than the bonds’ principal amounts.</p>
