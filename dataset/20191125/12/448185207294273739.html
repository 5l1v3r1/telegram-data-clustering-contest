      <p>Singer Celine Dion’s husband Rene Angelil’s dying wish was to watch her perform live. Dion performed her signature ballad “My heart will go on” on a Las Vegas stage. While the fans cheered for her, there was only one person she was singing to.</p>
      <p>At her family home a few miles away, her dying husband Angelil watched the performance via a live link from his bed, reports mirror.co.uk.</p>
      <p>Riddled with cancer, he was too ill to go to his wife’s live shows but his dying wish was for her to perform. He died in 2016.</p>
      <p>She recalled: “It wasn’t therapeutic for me, it was therapeutic for Rene. “For him it was very important because I took a year off to take care of him but towards the end he said to me, ‘I need to see you go on stage and sing, I want to make sure, I need to see it’.”</p>
      <p>The 51-year-old mother-of-three said of the final performances Angelil saw: “I didn’t feel like partying or putting on short dresses and feathers. But what kept me going was that I thought of him. I did it for him.</p>
      <p>“When I came home, he was so happy.” Angelil, who had discovered Celine Dion when she was 12, suffered multiple health problems throughout the couple’s 21-year marriage. He had a heart attack in 1991 at 49 and in 1999 was diagnosed with throat cancer but recovered after treatment. (IANS)</p>
