        <b>The press secretary to retired president Daniel arap Moi, Lee Njiru, on Monday, November 25, issued an update on Mzee Moi's health.</b>
      </p>
      <p>In the statement shared by the <i>Daily Nation</i>, Njiru stated that the 95-year-old former president, who has been <a href="https://www.kenyans.co.ke/news/46227-mzee-moi-re-admitted-hospital">admitted at Nairobi Hospital</a> for over a month, is set to be discharged soon.</p>
      <p>“Mzee Moi, who is being attended to by a team of medics led by his physician Dr. David Silverstein has recovered. But because of his old age, his doctors feel he should build up his energy before he can be discharged," Njiru stated.</p>

      <p>He announced that the doctors had informed them that it would be possible to have Mzee Moi back at his Kabarak home before the month of December.</p>
      <p>He went on to thank the countless Kenyans who had <a href="https://www.kenyans.co.ke/news/46420-uhuru-visits-moi-hospital-lengthy-chat">shared their messages of encouragement with the family</a>, making it clear that such trying times offered a lot of clarity.</p>
      <p>“Since Mzee Moi was readmitted to the hospital, he is getting better each day and we are confident God is taking care of him because of Kenyans’ prayers. We are very hopeful that in the next few days, he will be discharged to return to the care and comfort of his home,” he announced.</p>
      <p>The man who ruled Kenya for 24 years following Mzee Kenyatta's demise in 1978 has been making headlines over the past few months due to his health condition.</p>
      <p>However, the stalwart leader has stood defiantly against all odds, despite having been taken to hospital a number of times this year prior to his ongoing hospitalisation.</p>
