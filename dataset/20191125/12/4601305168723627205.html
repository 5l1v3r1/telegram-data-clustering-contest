      <p>Ride-hailing service Uber has lost its license to operate private hire vehicles in London, after Transport For London authorities discovered that over 14,000 trips were taken with more than 40 drivers operating under fake identities on the Uber app.</p>
      <p>The Uber cars won't disappear from London streets right away -- the company plans to appeal.</p>
      <p>From The Guardian:</p>
      <blockquote>Transport for London announced the decision not to renew the ride-hailing firm’s licence at the end of a two-month probationary extension granted in September. Uber was told then it needed to address issues with checks on drivers, insurance and safety, but has failed to satisfy the capital’s transport authorities.<br/><br/>TfL said on Monday it had identified a “pattern of failures” by Uber, including several breaches that placed passengers and their safety at risk.<br/><br/>In a statement, TfL said: “Despite addressing some of these issues, TfL does not have confidence that similar issues will not reoccur in the future, which has led it to conclude that the company is not fit and proper at this time.”</blockquote>
      <p>Uber denies everything, of course. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-uber-britain-appeal/uber-to-appeal-london-license-loss-decision-idUSKBN1XZ145">from Reuters</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>“Over the last two months we have audited every driver in London,” said Uber’s boss in Northern and Eastern Europe Jamie Heywood.<br/><br/>“We have robust systems and checks in place to confirm the identity of drivers and will soon be introducing a new facial matching process, which we believe is a first in London taxi and private hire.”</blockquote>
