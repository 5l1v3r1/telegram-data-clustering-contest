      <p>If you want to live in one of these swanky apartments overlooking the River Tyne, you'll have to be quick.</p>
      <p>There are only eight homes left for sale at The Smokehouses, built at the former Smith's Dock shipyard, in <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/north-shields">North Shields</a> .</p>
      <p>The site consists of two buildings, designed by architects Simpson Haugh, with a total of 80 apartments.</p>
      <p>They first went on the market 18 months ago and now 90% have been sold. The last eight are up for grabs from around £160,000.</p>

      <p>The buildings have been inspired by the traditional smoke houses of the Fish Quay and recently saw the addition of the restaurant 31 The Quay on the ground floor.</p>
      <p>The overall development, spearheaded by Urban Splash and Places for People, also includes 34 houses on the nearby elevated Plateau area, including 10 designed by TV architect <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/george-clarke">George Clarke</a> .</p>
      <p>Eventually, the site will have more than 800 homes, workspaces, green areas and public amenities.</p>
      <p>North Tyneside's Mayor Norma Redfearn said: "I am delighted to see the exciting transformation of the former Smith’s Dock shipyard really taking shape.</p>
      <p>"It was also brilliant to see the area feature on a national scale in the recent Tour of Britain cycle race.</p>
      <p>“The regeneration work taking place there has already hugely improved the area and is adding to the work being carried out by the council and our partners to breathe new life into North Shields.</p>
      <p>"The link road through the Smith’s Dock development connects the Fish Quay directly to Royal Quays, providing a much quicker route and also features walking and cycling paths.</p>

      <p>"It's also great to see new businesses opening up in the area and the changes really complement the various other developments to make the Fish Quay a wonderful place to live, work or visit."</p>
      <p>Guy Ackernley, residential director for the developers, added: "Sales at Smith's Dock really gathered pace over the past 18 months as the buildings took shape and the true value of living in this location became apparent.</p>
      <p>"The residents hold regular events and activities to encourage social interaction and develop pride in the local environment which contributes to a wonderfully upbeat and friendly atmosphere across the whole development.</p>
      <p>"We were confident that our plans for this historic site would be welcomed but the reaction from buyers, particularly for the apartments at the Smokehouses, were very encouraging.</p>
      <p>"It ensured our longer-term goal to deliver the Smith’s Dock masterplan featuring new residential properties, workspaces, watersports, retail areas and public parks can now advance to the next stage of planning."</p>
