      <p>BUFFALO GROVE, Ill. (AP) — Authorities say a suburban Minneapolis man suspected of killing his ex-wife and her husband outside of their northern Illinois home has died days after he shot himself.</p>
      <p>Police in the Chicago suburb of Buffalo Grove say in a news release that police in Edina, Minnesota, confirmed that 64-year-old Anatoliy Ermak died Monday morning at the Hennepin County Medical Center in Minneapolis.</p>
      <p>Ermak was suspected in the Nov. 17 killings of his ex-wife, Nataliya Ermak, and her husband, Roman Frid, who were fatally shot in the parking garage of their Buffalo Grove condominium.</p>
      <p>Edina police say officers who were responding to a tip about a wanted suspect on Friday night found Ermak sitting in a car. They say he shot himself as a police negotiator tried to talk to him.</p>
