      <h1>Here's why so many women in Hollywood date Pete Davidson – and it's not for the big reason you think</h1>

      <p>Cape Town – Ariana Grande, <a href="https://www.channel24.co.za/Gossip/News/spotted-pete-davidson-and-kate-beckinsale-hold-hands-after-night-out-in-la-20190204-2"><b>Kate Beckinsale</b></a> and now Kaia Gerber – Pete Davidson's dated some pretty big names in Hollywood – and it's not for the reason you may think.</p>
      <p>You'll recall <a href="https://www.channel24.co.za/Music/News/watch-we-unpack-ariana-grandes-thank-u-next-music-video-20181201"><b>a certain artist once alluded</b></a> to Pete's "HUUUGE", "10 inch" package, but according to Pete, it has more to do with his big, giving personality.</p>
      <p>When asked about his love language in his new <a href="https://www.papermag.com/break-the-internet-pete-davidson-2641400317.html?rebelltitem=27#rebelltitem27"><b>PAPER magazine</b></a> cover story, and whether it's in buying gifts for others, doing things verbally or physically, he said, "I do all that shit!</p>
      <p>"My love language, when I'm in a relationship, is I treat the person I'm with like a princess. I try and go as above and beyond as possible, because that's what you're supposed to do? If you're in a relationship with someone, you're just supposed to make that person feel as special as possible."</p>
      <p>His cover also pretty much broke the internet, as intended. Everyone was talking about his Barbie and Ken-inspired spread.</p>

      <p>Pete added that there is a downside to his love language, though. "Sometimes when you put so much on someone, it overwhelms them, and then they don't know if they could come close to that," he said.</p>
      <p>But he's come to the resolution that that really doesn't matter.</p>
      <p>"It's very off-putting to some. Sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn't, and then it sometimes makes me feel bad about myself because I'm like, "I did all this stuff and...[they didn't fucking care].</p>
      <p>"You didn't care at all! But you can't do that. I have learned that anything you do, it just has to be 'cause you wanna do it."</p>
      <p>Pete also opened up about his career and his "HUGE crush on Leonardo DiCaprio".</p>
