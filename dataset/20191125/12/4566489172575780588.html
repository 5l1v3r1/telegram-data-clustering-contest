      <p>Protestors stormed a UN peacekeepers' camp near the eastern DR Congo town of Beni on Monday, angered by failures to curb a notorious armed group that killed eight civilians overnight, an AFP reporter said.</p>
      <p>Demonstrators invaded one of two camps on the town's outskirts despite gunshots fired by Congolese security forces seeking to disperse the crowd.</p>
      <p>Dozens broke into the camp, which had apparently been evacuated, and set fire to a part of it, an AFP reporter saw.</p>
      <p>They were among an angry crowd several hundred strong that had headed to the camps after setting fire to Beni town hall, partially damaging it.</p>
      <p>The Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) militia has plagued eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) for decades, despite the presence of a large UN force and repeated declarations by the government to root it out.</p>
      <p>Army spokesman Colonel Mak Hazukai confirmed that the town had been attacked by armed men overnight, telling AFP that "the enemy entered the Boikene quarter and killed eight civilians".</p>
      <p>In the town centre, two policemen were seen bleeding heavily from wounds after the morning protest, an AFP reporter saw.</p>
      <p>A demonstrator died when police opened fire on Saturday. Two policemen were killed the same day by angry demonstrators, the UN Okapi radio said.</p>
      <p>Seventy-seven civilians have been killed in the Beni region since November 5, according to a not-for-profit organisation, the Congo Research Group (CRG).</p>
      <p>The army launched an offensive against the ADF on October 30, vowing to "definitively wipe out" armed groups in the lawless east.</p>
      <p>The ADF's historical roots lie in Islamist Ugandans opposed to Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni.</p>
      <p>The group has plagued the North Kivu region bordering Uganda since the Congo Wars in the 1990s, although its membership has since broadened to non-Ugandans and it has not carried out an attack in Uganda for years.</p>
      <p>The so-called Islamic State group has claimed some of the attacks ascribed to the ADF this year, but there is no clear evidence of any affiliation between the two groups.</p>
      <p>- Embattled mission -</p>
      <p>MONUSCO -- the United Nations Organization Stablization Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo -- is one of the biggest UN peacekeeping operations in the world.</p>
      <p>It was established in 2010, taking over from a UN mission in Congo called MONUC, set up in 1999 at the height of the second Congo War.</p>
      <p>The mission today comprises more than 16,500 military personnel and observers, 1,300 police and at least 4,000 civilians.</p>
      <p>But it has struggled to make headway in a vast country beset by armed groups as well as entrenched poverty and poor governance.</p>
      <p>On Monday, the speaker of the DR Congo parliament, Jeanine Mabunda, said MONUSCO's mission "cannot be limitless".</p>
      <p>"There is an unease over the presence, the cost of MONUSCO in the DRC, and the results obtained," Mabanda said in Paris.</p>
      <p>She said it was "legitimate for people to ask why this force is still in the DRC."</p>
      <p>On Saturday, the mission said the Congolese army had launched its anti-militia offensive unilaterally, and this was why it could not intervene.</p>
      <p>"MONUSCO cannot engage in operations in a war zone without being asked and without strict coordination with the national army," it explained in a tweet.</p>
      <p>Uncoordinated action could lead to casualties from friendly fire, it added.</p>
      <p>- Troubled region -</p>
      <p>Beni, in addition to being in the front line of militia violence, is also the epicentre of an Ebola epidemic that has killed around 2,200 people since August 2018.</p>

      <p>On Friday, the World Health Organization (WHO) said fighting in the region could jeopardise an opportunity to end the outbreak.</p>
      <p>Also in eastern DR Congo, at least 29 people were killed on Sunday when a small plane crashed after takeoff, smashing into a densely populated area of the city of Goma.</p>
