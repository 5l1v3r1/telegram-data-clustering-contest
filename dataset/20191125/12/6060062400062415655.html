      <p>Kylian Mbappe is backing <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/lionel-messi?r=US&amp;IR=T">Lionel Messi</a> to win the 2019 Ballon d'Or award.</p>
      <p>Messi has won the prize a joint record five times alongside Cristiano Ronaldo, meaning should he win in Paris next month, he will become the award's most frequent ever recipient with six titles.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/neymar-suarez-and-modric-omitted-from-ballon-dor-shortlist-2019-10?r=US&amp;IR=T">The Argentine faces stiff competition</a> from Ronaldo, Liverpool duo Sadio Mane and Virgil van Dijk, and Mbappe himself, but the Paris Saint Germain forward believes there can only be one winner.</p>
      <p>And told <a href="https://www.spiegel.de/plus/kylian-mbappe-ich-weiss-schon-ich-bin-nicht-gott-a-00000000-0002-0001-0000-000167093496">Der Spiegel</a> that it should be Messi. "In individual terms, he was the best this year."</p>
      <p>Messi has scored 45 goals this calendar year for club and country, guiding FC Barcelona to the La Liga title and Argentina to the Copa America semifinals.</p>
      <p>Nine of those goals have come in his last eight games for Barca, helping it sit at the top of the Spanish league again.</p>
      <p>In contrast, long term rival Cristiano Ronaldo has managed 33 goals, however almost a quarter of those (7) came in the space of two games against international minnows Lithuania.</p>
      <p>Messi is one of four FC Barcelona players up for the award, with Frenkie de Jong, Marc-Andre ter Stegen, and Antoine Griezmann also part of the final 30-man shortlist.</p>
      <p>Liverpool is the team with the most players nominated however with seven, those being Mane, Van Dijk, Alisson, Mohamed Salah, Georginio Wijnaldum, Roberto Firmino, and Trent Alexander-Arnold.</p>
      <p>Manchester City has five nominees (Sergio Aguero, Kevin De Bruyne, Riyad Mahrez, Bernardo Silva, and Raheem Sterling), while Real Madrid has two (Eden Hazard and Karim Benzema.)</p>
      <p>Mbappe is just one of two PSG players given the nod, the other being Brazilian defender Marquinhos.</p>
