        <h4>When is Fitbit Black Friday?</h4>
        <p>Black Friday will fall on <b>Friday 29 November </b>this year, but really it's now much bigger than just one day. Amazon has announced that it will run a Black Friday week, which will stretch from 22-29 November, with deals running right through that period.</p>
        <p>That means Cyber Monday on 2 December, with more deals expected - and that will be the case right up to Christmas.</p>
        <h4>What Fitbit deals for Black Friday should you expect?</h4>
        <p>Because we're always keeping an eye on Fitbit prices all year round - and have been covering every Black Friday from years gone by - we've developed an impressive ability to predict what discounts to expect.</p>
        <p>That's because when it comes to Fitbit deals for Black Friday, it pays to look at historical prices as well as Fitbit's release schedule to make predictions.</p>
        <p>Last year, one of the most popular discounts for Black Friday was the Fitbit Charge 2, which was discounted to $99.95 (-$50). Since then, the <b>Fitbit</b><b>Charge 3</b> has been released, so there's a good chance this is the most popular Fitbit deal for this year's Black Friday.</p>
        <p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
        <anchor name="Article-Middle">
          <p>We've seen the Charge 3 sold for as little as $109 in the US and £88.95 in the UK (<a href="https://www.wareable.com/deals/best-fitbit-prime-day-deals-6313">for Fitbit Prime Day</a>). Needless to say, this is the price that has to be beat for Black Friday. We think there's a good chance of lower than $100/£80 setting a record low for this excellent fitness tracker.</p>
          <p>Fitbit also recently released <b>Fitbit Versa 2</b>, so there will definitely be discounts on the original <b>Fitbit Versa</b>. We've seen it for $139.99 already in recent weeks, so a price lower than that would make it a tempting alternative if you don't need the newer model with Alexa support. And we wouldn't rule out a decent price cut for the Fitbit Versa 2 either, and Fitbit will surely look to be aggressive this holidays. After all, it's got that $2.1bn of Google cash to fall back on.</p>
          <p>Walmart has launched its Black Friday ads ahead of the big event, and it has revealed the <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Fitbit-Versa-LITE-Edition-Smartwatch-Charcoal-Silver-Aluminum/497506373">Fitbit Versa Lite will be just $99</a>. That's cheaper than many of Fitbit's more entry-level fitness trackers, so a fully-fledged smartwatch for this little money is a bargain.</p>
          <p>For Prime Day 2019, the <b>Fitbit Ionic</b> hit a new low price of just $169.95 (-$80), so that sets the bar for this year's Black Friday deal. A Fitbit Ionic for close to $150 would make it a tempting prospect for the only Fitbit with built-in GPS. Provided you get on with the design, it's better value than the Fitbit Versa 2 at that price.</p>
          <h4>Where will you find Fitbit Black Friday deals?</h4>
          <p>Amazon is going to be a good source of Fitbit deals, as we've seen the gigantic retailer discounting Fitbit devices for previous Black Fridays, Prime Days and all throughout the year. Some of the most competitive prices are no doubt going to be led by Amazon.</p>

          </p>
          <hr/>
          <p>Elsewhere, in the US we would expect Target, Best Buy and Walmart to be good places to look. In the UK, Currys PC World, Argos and John Lewis are always good options. We'll be keeping eyes on all of these during the sale.</p>
          <p>Fitbit.com may also prove fruitful for Fitbit deals, although buying direct hasn't always been as competitive as from other retailers.</p>
          <p>Fitbit devices often feature in the infamous Black Friday ads from the big retailers. These adverts showcase the best Black Friday deals and give you advance notice of what to expect.</p>
          <p>The main thing is to make sure you're buying from a reputable retailer. If you don't recognise the online store, be sure to do some research to make sure it's trustworthy. We'll be sure only post Fitbit Black Friday deals you can absolutely trust.</p>

          <p>A week before Black Friday and the deals are starting to roll in. We've seen the <a href="https://geni.us/VAdN3Z">Fitbit Versa get a huge price cut to $149.99</a> on both Amazon and over at the Fitbit official store. Those prices look like they could go the distance through Black Friday but you can never be sure.</p>
          <p>We've seen rumours that <a href="https://www.costco.com/fitbit-versa-2-bundle-black.product.100510619.html">Costco could slash the price of the Fitbit Versa 2 to $139.99 on 21 November</a>, which would be an extremely strong Black Friday deal.</p>
          <p>And if it does, we'd expect some of the big boys to follow suit. Watch this space.</p>

          <p>The Fitbit Alta HR has since been replaced by the Fitbit Inspire HR. But this means you can pick up this older fitness tracker for a big saving whereas the newer model is so far rarely discounted. It's still a good tracker – and won multiple Wareable Tech Awards in 2017. What's more, there are heaps of nice bands and accessories for Alta, which are also going cheap too.</p>
          <p>rev="7453"&gt;</p>
          <p>It includes a heart rate monitor while maintaining a sleek and discreet design that you can customise with different bands. It also introduced Fitbit's more advanced Sleep Stages sleep tracking that is now prevalent across its devices.</p>
