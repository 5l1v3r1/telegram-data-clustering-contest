      <p>Trouble ringed on veteran actors – Govinda and Jackie Shroff’s door as a consumer court in Muzaffarnagar, Uttar Pradesh has imposed a fine of <b>Rs 20,000</b> on the actors. This heavy fine charged by the court comes after a complaint filed against Govinda and Jackie Shroff for endorsing a pain relief oil.</p>
      <p>Along with the actors, the company that manufactures the oil has also been fined with a heavy fine. The case goes five years back when a complaint was filed by a youth named Abhinav Agarwal. He had filed a case against a herbal oil firm and its two celebrity brand ambassadors – Govind and Jackie Shroff.</p>

      <p>Abhinav Agarwal, a Muzaffarnagar-based lawyer had ordered a pain relief oil for his 70-year-old father Brijbhushan Agarwal. The oil’s cost was <b>Rs 3,600</b> and the newspaper advertisement of the herbal oil promised a full refund if the user fails to get visible results in 15 days. After seeing no result even after 10 days of application, Agarwal contacted a representative of this Madhya Pradesh-based company. A person from the company advised him to return the product for processing the refund.</p>
      <p>However, the company failed to refund the amount and even started attacking Agarwal when he contacted them again. “I bought the product because celebrities like Govinda and Jackie Shroff were promoting it. The company promised complete relief in 15 days. Everything turned out to be a fraud,” said Abhinav. He then lodged the complaint with the consumer court.</p>
      <p>The consumer court has directed all five stakeholders – the company, Govinda, Jackie Shroff, Telemart Shopping Network Pvt Limited and Max Communications – to pay Rs 20,000 as damages to the victim. It also commanded the firm to return <b>Rs 3,600</b> paid by Agarwal with an interest of 9 per cent per annum along with other legal expenses.</p>
      <p>Let’s see how the actors react to it now.</p>
