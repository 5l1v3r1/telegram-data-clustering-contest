      <p>Eamonn Holmes found himself in the middle of a race row after ITV questioned him for branding <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/meghan-markle/">Meghan Markle</a> ‘uppity’<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/07/31/eamonn-holmes-slams-meghan-markles-uppity-attitude-heated-debate-10494235/"> in a debate over the Duchess of Sussex’s demand for privacy</a>.</p>
      <p>However, it has now been confirmed that the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/this-morning/">This Morning</a> presenter will not face action for his use of the word, which has now been banned from being used by the channel because of its racial connotations.</p>
      <p>‘Eamonn Holmes was absolutely not reprimanded for his use of the word “uppity”,’ an ITV spokesperson told <b>Metro.co.uk</b>.</p>
      <p>‘Conversations took place with Eamonn and the wider production team involving an explanation of a possible interpretation of the word, which had come to light on the basis of a complaint made to the channel after the broadcast.’</p>
      <p>They added: ‘Therefore this was a point of learning for the wider team, not in any way a rebuke.’</p>

      <p>At the time, reporter Lainey Lui called into the debate from Canada and commented that it was unfair that Meghan is getting the brunt of the backlash for opting for privacy restrictions, seeing as her husband Prince Harry had a hand in the decision too.</p>

      <p>In response, Eamonn said that considering they’re ‘taking from the public purse’, they should be a bit more forthcoming.</p>
      <p>‘You do know why it’s landing on her,’ he stated. ‘If you have an uppity attitude, you’re only through the door two minutes, and suddenly you’re sitting at Wimbledon, with Royal protection people going “no photographs”, you do know.</p>
      <p>‘If that was somebody in Canada, you would be writing [that] they’re right up their own backside.’</p>
      <p>The word ‘uppity’ was used as an insult to black people in the US who ‘didn’t know their place’.</p>
      <p>On top of complaining to television watchdog Ofcom, the complainant also reached out to ITV’s Head of Diversity, Ade Rawcliffe.</p>
      <p>After talks with Ofcom, Ade said: ‘We are not saying that ignorance is in any way a defence, he was using the term to describe what he interpreted as arrogance.</p>
      <p>‘The origins of the term have now been explained to Eamonn and the wider editorial team and it won’t be used again.</p>

      <p>‘We apologise for any offence that this may have caused you.’</p>
      <p>Eamonn has yet to address to controversy.</p>
