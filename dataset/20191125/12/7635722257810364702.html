      <h1>New app converts Christmas purchases to cash for the homeless</h1>

        <b>A new app by two students is hoping to make cash for homeless people through other people's shopping.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Giveback.ie has partnered with the Inner City Helping Homeless (ICHH) as part of its plan to eradicate street homelessness in Dublin by Christmas 2020.</p>
      <p>Set up by two 22-year-old UCD and DCU students, James Gallagher and Victoria Ryan-Nesbitt, the platform features a passive donation function that raises funds as consumers shop.</p>
      <p>Although currently only operational in Dublin, the founders are hoping to roll out similar programmes throughout Ireland.</p>
      <p>Through downloading the Giveback app and using it during online purchases, donations of between 1-10% are automatically made by retailers to ICHH on behalf of the consumer.</p>
      <p>This equates to an average donation of €60 annually.</p>
      <p>Giveback currently has 1,200 retail partners - including Amazon, ASOS and Hotels.com.</p>
      <p>The developers say the platform's capabilities mean users do not physically need to dig into their pockets.</p>
      <p>"The app works quietly in the background as consumers purchase items giving users the power to make a difference through shopping alone," they say.</p>

      <p>The initiative aims to attract 100,000 downloads over the Christmas period to help generate almost €6m in funding for the ICHH charity.</p>
      <p>ICHH was established in 2013 to provide services to homeless people across the capital.</p>
      <p>It receives zero in government funding, and currently operates with just two full time staff members and a team of over 200 volunteers.</p>
      <p>Giveback.ie co-founder James Gallagher said: "We do most of our shopping online for Christmas and felt there must be a way we can use that to benefit the most vulnerable in society.</p>
      <p>"With Giveback.ie, all you need to do is download the app, activate the function and forget about it.</p>
      <blockquote>"As you shop, you make a big difference and it doesn't cost you a cent.</blockquote>
      <p>"We've partnered with 1,200 retailers who will donate between 1-5% of your purchase directly to our charity partner. This could make a huge difference to the everyday battle to end homelessness in Dublin."</p>
      <p>The concept came when co-founder, Victoria, sat with a homeless woman who she had seen wearing a jacket with her secondary school crest on it.</p>
      <p>She discovered they had attended the same school in Clondalkin only a few years apart - and the woman had been made homeless days before Christmas.</p>
