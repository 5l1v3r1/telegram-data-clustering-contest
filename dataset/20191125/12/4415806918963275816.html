      <h1>Twitter reacts to weather app warning of tornado in Dublin</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T12:19:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 12:19</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/digital-desk-staff/" target="_blank">By Digital Desk staff</a></address>
      <p>Some twitter users were confused this morning when they checked their weather app to see somewhat terrifying news.</p>
      <p>Apparently, a tornado was due to hit Dublin today, with people sharing screenshots of the weather app warnings.</p>
      <p>The pictures have come from the Apple weather App, however Carlow Weather has said it is likely a glitch in their system.</p>
      <p>Carlow Weather's Alan O'Reilly said: "We do have a storm, tropical storm Sebastian heading our way which will approach the night but certainly at the moment there's nothing to worry about in terms of tornadoes.</p>
      <blockquote>There have been reports of mini tornadoes in the past in Ireland, from super cell type storms, but certainly not at the moment.</blockquote>
