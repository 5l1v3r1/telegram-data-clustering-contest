        <b>Viral animated images of a new Star Wars character, nicknamed Baby Yoda, are back online after a brief ban.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Gifs featuring the co-star of the Mandalorian TV series had been widely shared online, with many viewers declaring the small alien as being "the best thing" about the new Disney+ show.</p>
      <p>But the animations disappeared late last week after Giphy - the platform used to make them - blocked the posts.</p>
      <p>It said it had done so because of "confusion" about their legal status.</p>
      <p>Disney had faced criticism after <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/the-mandalorian-baby-yoda-images.html">news site The Vulture had reported</a> that its own Baby Yoda posts had been removed for "copyright reasons", adding that "Disney decided that Gifs of this beautiful being should be removed from the internet!"</p>
      <p>Many fans subsequently complained on social media about the US media giant's supposed intervention.</p>
      <p>But Giphy has since clarified that Disney was not to blame.</p>
      <p>"Last week, there was some confusion around certain content uploaded to Giphy and we temporarily removed these Gifs while we reviewed the situation," said the image-hosting website in a statement.</p>
      <p>"We apologise to both Disney and Vulture for any inconvenience, and we are happy to report that the Gifs are once again live on Giphy."</p>

      <p>The BBC has asked Disney for comment.</p>
      <p>Variety has <a href="https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/baby-yoda-merchandise-1203412147/">reported that the California-based firm intends to launch a wide range of tie-in merchandise</a> for the character ahead of Christmas, so will likely benefit from its viral status. Disney has also shared its own imagery of the character online.</p>

      <p>There is no US legal precedent for Gifs being forced off the net on copyright grounds.</p>
      <p>Experts <a href="https://modicum.agency/blog/animated-gifs-fair-use-copyright-law/">suggest they would probably fall under "fair use"</a> due to their transformative purpose - an exception made under intellectual property laws to allow the re-use of others' material for commentary or parody.</p>
      <p>The Disney+ streaming service was launched in the US earlier this month, but will not come to the UK and many other markets until 2020.</p>
