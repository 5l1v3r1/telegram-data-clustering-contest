      <h1>Mariners acquire left-handed pitcher Nestor Cortes Jr. from the Yankees</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T12:11:28+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 12:11</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.seattletimes.com/author/ryan-divish/" target="_blank">Ryan Divish</a></address>
      <p>The Mariners made a small trade Monday afternoon, acquiring left-handed pitcher Nestor Cortes Jr. from the New York Yankees in exchange for international bonus pool money.</p>
      <p>Cortes was designated for assignment by the Yankees last week when 40-man rosters had to be set ahead of the Rule 5 draft.</p>
      <p>“Nestor is a versatile lefty who can do a little bit of everything,” general manager Jerry Dipoto said in a statement. “He can start, he can relieve, he can give you those middle innings or even operate as an opener.”</p>
      <p>Cortes, who turns 25 on December 10, appeared in 33 games (one start) with the Yankees last season, going 5-1 with a 5.67 ERA (42 earned runs, 66 2/3 innings pitched) with 28 walks and 69 strikeouts. Of his 32 appearances, 18 were multiple innings, including nine outings of three innings and four outings of four-plus innings.</p>
      <p>“He’s got roughly all the pitches and a very deceptive style,” Dipoto said. “He’s not going to overpower you with velocity, but he has a really effective fast ball quality and feel. He is an optionable young pitcher that gives us another flexible piece on our 40-man roster.”</p>
      <p>The addition of Cortes gives the Mariners 36 players on the 40-man roster.</p>
