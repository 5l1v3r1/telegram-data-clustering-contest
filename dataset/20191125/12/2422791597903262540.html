      <p>MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- A Tennessee teenager has been sentenced to 30 years in prison in the beating death of a girl he was babysitting.</p>
      <p>Shelby County prosecutors say 18-year-old Antonio Evans pleaded guilty Friday to adult charges of second-degree murder and aggravated child abuse.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors say Evans was a 14-year-old foster child when he was left in charge of three other foster children, ages 6, 7 and 9, in the Memphis suburb of Cordova.</p>
      <p>The children said Evans repeatedly punched, kicked and whipped them with a belt and a cord for three days in December 2015. They said Evans threatened them with more abuse if they told anyone.</p>
      <p>A 6-year-old girl died at a hospital from injuries she suffered.</p>
