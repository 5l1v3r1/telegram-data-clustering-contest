      <h1>Wolverhampton Grand at 125: Comedy royalty clamour on stage</h1>
      <h2>The Royal Family – that's comedy royalty – paid a visit to Wolverhampton and made their entrance Elizabethan-style.</h2>

      <p>The VIP appearance took place at the city's Grand Theatre in June 1989.</p>
      <p>The Royals, a group of much loved Black Country performers, staged an evening of 'mid-summer madness' at the Lichfield Street venue.</p>
      <p>Among the artistes taking part were Tommy Mundon, John Raven, Dolly Allen, Daniel Raven, Doug Parker and Cosmotheka.</p>
      <p>The show, otherwise known as The Court of King Cedric, was described as the first live 16th century soap opera in the country.</p>
      <p>It was a golden age for Black Country humour and sadly the leading lights of that night's entertainment have now passed on.</p>
      <p>Dolly, who was 84 when she died in 1990, is still fondly remembered by thousands of fans. A plaque to 'The Queen of the Black Country', as she was known, was unveiled at Brierley Hill Civic Hall where she made so many people laugh.</p>
      <p>Tommy Mundon died five years ago after a long battle against Parkinson's disease. The 80-year-old funnyman, from Halesowen, was a regular on the comedy circuit for 50 years and a campaign has been launched for a blue plaque in his honour.</p>
      <p>The image is reproduced here as the Express &amp; Star joins with the Grand to mark the theatre’s milestone 125th anniversary this year.</p>
