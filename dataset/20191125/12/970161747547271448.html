        <b>Leaked <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/stranger-things/">Stranger Things</a> audition tapes made fans believe season four won’t be set in Hawkins at all.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Actress Debbie Woods shared audition tapes to social media, which has her trying out for the role of Dorris, Hawkins Middle <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/school/">School</a>’s receptionist.</p>
      <p>The tape shows the actress reading lines where she’s telling off a student and mentioned ‘weird noises’ coming from some of the school classrooms.</p>
      <p>While in character, Debbie said: ‘They need your help up on three, something about weird noises coming through the ceiling above some of the rooms’.</p>
      <p>With the Netflix teaser trailer saying ‘we’re not in Hawkins anymore’, many fans believe the new season won’t be set in Hawkins whatsoever.</p>
      <p>Some also believe that it will be set in the Upside Down.</p>
      <p>What do you guys think?</p>
      <p>Users on Reddit have been <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/06/stranger-things-season-4-all-the-best-theories-from-reddit-11046939/">discussing who ‘the American’ is in the post-credit scene</a>.</p>

      <p>Some think Hopper is The American and is therefore alive.</p>

      <p>You know the biggest role in film and TV?</p>
      <p>No dead body = Not dead… and you don’t just wipe out a character like Hopper without so much as a funeral or some sort of memento left behind.</p>
      <p>It’s an almost overwhelming theory from fans everywhere that he is The American that the Russians have captured and locked away in the headquarters.</p>
      <p>Some reckon he could’ve even got there via the portal that Joyce closed – being pulled from Hawkins, through the Upside Down, and out the other side to Russia.</p>
      <p>Shocked at someone’s reappearance, they held him captive until they could figure out what to do with him.</p>
      <p>Other rumoured plots suggest he will then be rescued by a mysterious Russian character called B, bringing him back into the fold.</p>

      <p>Theories that Dr Brenner is the American were quickly shut down.</p>
      <p>Reddit user jcox296 said: ‘Why are so many people saying he’s the American when he doesn’t have an American accent.</p>
      <p>‘Is it because he was based in America or what? It’s confusing me.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘Or does he have an American accent and I’m blind to it?!’</p>
      <p>At this point, we are all as confused as the writers want us to be, so we’re going to have to wait and see.</p>
