      <h1>Alternative apps to get round London after Uber loses its licence</h1>

      <p>Uber has been stripped of its London licence once again, but what does this mean for the millions of people using the taxi app in the capital?</p>
      <p>Transport for London says it found ‘several breaches’ that placed ‘passengers and their safety at risk’ so refused to renew Uber’s licence.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/25/uber-losing-licence-london-means-customers-can-still-order-taxis-app-11214644/">You can still book an Uber</a>, however, as the taxi giant is appealing the decision and its drivers will be allowed to operate during the appeal process.</p>
      <p>But with many Londoners questioning the ‘safety’ of London’s top transport app, they may start looking at the alternatives.</p>
      <p>Luckily for them, they are not short of options.</p>
      <h3>Bolt</h3>

      <p>Bolt had a very turbulent start to life in London. Transport for London cut short its launch in 2017 after just a few days for failing to get the right licencing.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>The app, formerly known as Taxify, relaunched earlier this year and it already has over 30,000 drivers on its books.</p>
      <p>Bolt is pretty much identical to Uber but rides start with a £2.50 base fee, plus £1.25 per mile and £0.15 per minute.</p>
      <p>However, Bolt drivers have unionised and are protesting to increase fares to £2 per mile.</p>
      <h3>ViaVan</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>If you don’t mind sharing your cab like you do with Uber Pool, then you should try ViaVan.</p>
      <p>ViaVan is cheaper than your standard Uber and you won’t feel guilty about polluting London’s atmosphere with your solo journey.</p>
      <p>The Uber rival says it’s already saved millions of taxi miles thanks to its pooling feature, and it was granted a three-year licence by TfL in July, so it’s here to stay.</p>
      <h3>Kapten</h3>

        <figcaption>Kapten has lots of offers for new customers (Picture: Kapten)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Kapten is a relative newcomer on London’s crowded e-taxi scene.</p>
      <p>Both Daimler and BMW have pumped millions into the French start-up to rival Uber in London, so you may have noticed the wave of Kapten adverts across the capital.</p>
      <p>It launched in May this year with an eye-catching offer of 50 per cent off new rides.</p>
      <p>Customers have since been offered £2 off their first five rides.</p>
      <p>Kapten says it saves riders £2 per trip by covering the congestion charge for its 16,000 drivers.</p>
      <h3>Wheely</h3>

        <figcaption>Wheely offers a luxurious taxi service (Wheely)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>This is one for the ballers who don’t bat an eye at paying a bit more for Uber’s premium Lux service.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>Wheely offers a chauffeur car service in a new Mercedes-Benz so it’s more like having a personal driver than being in taxi.</p>
      <p>Russian entrepreneur Anton Chirkunov founded the app in 2012. All of its drivers are picked through an accreditation process to ensure the highest level of service.</p>
      <p>However, it’s had a bit of a hectic history since launching in Moscow, Paris and London.</p>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/22d3bd24-3414-11e8-ae84-494103e73f7f">Financial Times</a>, Wheely pulled out of the UK capital after failing to compete with Addison Lee, but then re-launched in 2018 with a plan to attract drivers away from Uber.</p>
      <h3>Gett</h3>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>Gett also operates outside London (Picture: Getty)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Or you can try Gett, which offers completely flat pricing and works with licenced taxi drivers.</p>
      <p>It’s one of the few UK ride-hailing services that operates outside London.</p>
      <p>Gett is available in Edinburgh, Manchester, Birmingham, Liverpool, Glasgow, Leeds, Oxford, Cambridge, Reading, Slough, Milton Keynes, Brighton, Bristol, Bath, Cardiff, Portsmouth, Bournemouth, Leicester, Coventry, Sheffield, Nottingham, Bradford, Hull, and Newcastle.</p>
      <h3>Kabbee</h3>

        <figcaption>All drivers are licenced with high ratings (Picture: Kabbee)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Kabbee pitches itself as being the cheaper alternative to a black cab – 65% cheaper to be exact.</p>
      <p>It chooses cars from more than 70 providers, giving users access to 10,000 London cabs.</p>
      <p>All drivers are licenced and selected from minicab services with high ratings. Any with low ratings get removed from the service.</p>
      <p>The service is currently only available in London though, which is still great for Londoners looking for an Uber alternative.</p>
      <h3>Free Now</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/free-now-9ed5.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;zoom=1&amp;resize=540%2C383&amp;ssl=1"/>
        <figcaption>Free Now has more than 100,000 registered taxi drivers in over 100 European cities (Picture: Free Now)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Taxi-hailing app Free Now is one of the largest e-hailing companies in Europe and was previously known as Hailo and MyTaxi.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>Free Now has hundreds of thousands of registered taxi drivers in over 100 European cities, including Barcelona, Berlin, Dublin, Paris, and 17,000 black cabs in London.</p>
      <p>It’s pretty similar to Uber in the way it works – you can order a taxi to your location almost immediately and have it paid for using the app.</p>
      <p>The main difference is that taxis are licenced and you won’t get hit with a shocking surge price when demand is high.</p>
      <h3>Addison Lee</h3>

        <figcaption>Addison Lee has improved its app significantly since the rise of Uber (Picture: Rex)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Many of us forget but before Uber, Addison Lee was the biggest minicab company in the UK.</p>
      <p>The company has been working hard to keep up with the changing customer habits since Uber appeared on the scene, by updating its mobile app and the way you can order a cab.</p>
      <p>You can order cabs directly from their app without having to do it the old-fashioned way by calling the taxi company.</p>
      <p>It’s considered a great alternative to Uber when surge pricing is on, or for booking airport transfers ahead of time, and is popular with corporate clients that want fixed pricing.</p>
      <p>The only downside of Addison Lee is that it’s not available outside of London and can be pretty expensive.</p>
      <h3>Getaround</h3>

        <figcaption>The app lets you pick from a variety of cars, from Honda to Mercedes-Benz (Picture: Getty)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Though not a taxi-hailing app as such, Getaround is a great alternative to Uber as it lets you rent cars on-demand.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>The app, formerly known as Drivy, lets you pick from a variety of cars, including Honda and Mercedes-Benz, and lets you pay by the hour.</p>
      <p>Once you’ve selected your vehicle, you just pop over to the garage or parking spot where it’s located.</p>
      <p>It’s a good way for car owners to make some extra money when they aren’t planning on using it.</p>
