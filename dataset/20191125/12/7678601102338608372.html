      <p>Bowler Ryan Lalisang wrapped up the 55th QubicaAMF Bowling World Cup by taking second place in the men’s category, after losing to champion Francois Louw of South Africa on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Third place went to Oliver Morig of Germany.</p>
      <p>The cup was held at Jakabaring Sport City’s (JSC) bowling center in Palembang, South Sumatra, starting on Nov. 19.</p>
      <p>Despite losing the title, Ryan said securing second place was a significant milestone for him. He participated in the cup with the aim of reaching the top four.</p>
      <p>In the final game, Ryan managed to add 202 more points from 10 bowls, collecting a total of 8,638 points. Louw made 237 points to seal the win with a total of 8,715 points.</p>
      <p>“[Finishing as runner up] has boosted my confidence to compete with bowlers from other countries. This is also an evaluation prior to our departure to the upcoming SEA [Southeast Asian] Games,” Ryan said after the cup.</p>
      <p>In the women’s category, Rebecca Withing of Australia won first place, followed by Aumi Guerra of the Dominican Republic and Kelly Kullick of the United States. Meanwhile, Indonesian Shinta Ceysaria finished at 18th.</p>
      <p>Ryan’s result is Indonesia’s best achievement in the cup thus far. In past editions, Indonesia was only able to reach third place.</p>
      <p>Indonesian Bowling Association (PBI) chief Percha Leanpuri lauded Ryan’s performance, pointing out his endless efforts to seal second place.</p>
      <p>“Ryan has given his best for the country. His achievement even surpassed our initial target,” said Percha.</p>
      <p>She also said she was happy with the cup’s organizers in running the world-level competition smoothly. She hoped the country would carry on with sport’s development by hosting more high-quality events and talent scouting through the Bowling Goes to School program.</p>
