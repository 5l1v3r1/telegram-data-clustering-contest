      <p>French energy management and automation specialist Schneider Electric has opened its sixth smart distribution centre globally and first in the Middle East in Dubai in a bid to digitally transform supply chains for efficiency and sustainability.</p>
      <p>The other smart distribution centres are in Australia, China, Brazil, France, and India.</p>
      <p>Mourad Tamoud, Executive Vice-President for Global Supply Chain at Schneider Electric, said the centre features its IoT-enabled, open, interoperable architecture EcoStruxure platform that makes operations efficient and lean.</p>
      <p>Moreover, he said the new centre will showcase technologies that deliver greater efficiencies to customers and partners as well as providing a platform to develop local talent.</p>
      <p>“We intend to reduce our carbon footprint and go green, inside its factories, by 2030 by using renewable energies and extend it our suppliers by 2050,” he said.</p>
      <p>Dubai has become one of four international hubs for the French company after Paris, Boston and Hong Kong and Schneider Electric has been present in the region for 30 years.</p>
      <p>Tamoud said that the smart centre not only shortens its delivery time to customers but also optimises supply chain operations to provide delivery excellence.</p>
      <h4>Optimising CapEx and OpEx investments</h4>
      <p>The smart distribution centre, spanning across an area of 30,000 square meters and located at Jebel Ali Free Zone, is now open for inbound, outbound and local adaptation entities.</p>
      <p> “In the short- to mid-term, our smart distribution centre is already increasing the end-to-end efficiency of our operations up to 5% by cutting delivery time to customers, optimising supply chain operations by reducing equipment downtime and reducing overall power consumption saving approximately 10-12%,” said Ahmed Khashan, President of Gulf Countries and Pakistan at Schneider Electric.</p>
      <p>He said that the EcoStruxure platform enables real-time performance monitoring, analysis and predictive analytics to reduce downtime and create more efficient operations.</p>
      <p>“Our technologies enable our customers to take a holistic view of their operations to optimise CapEx and OpEx investments,” he added.</p>
