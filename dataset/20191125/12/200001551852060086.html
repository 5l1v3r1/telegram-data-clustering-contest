      <h1>After disastrous Rangers spell, and failures elsewhere, striker now tearing up league</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T12:37:09+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 12:37</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/author/annie/" target="_blank">Sport Witness Team</a></address>
      <p>Under Steven Gerrard this season, Rangers certainly aren’t having problems finding the back of the net.</p>
      <p>At the weekend they beat Hamilton 3-1, with two goals from Ryan Kent and one from Ryan Jack. Jermain Defoe and Alfredo Morelos are second and third in the Scottish Premiership scoring table, and Gerrard’s side have scored 38 times in 13 league matches so far this season.</p>
      <p>The club haven’t struggled for goals since returning to the top division, but, for reasons which may never be completely clear, in July 2018 they took a gamble on Umar Sadiq. He was loaned from AS Roma, with Rangers agreeing to take the striker for the season.</p>
      <p>Sadiq made just four appearances for the Ibrox club before Gerrard decided he’d seen enough and sent the player back to Roma in January. It was another poor period for the player who had also failed to find the back of the net on loan at Bologna and Torino.</p>
      <p>This season things are very different, the 22 year old is on loan at Partizan Belgrade and is top of the SuperLiga goalscoring charts with 10 goals in 14 matches. It’s causing shock in Italy, where they clearly didn’t feel this kind of form was possible from the player.</p>
      <p>The same is probably true at Rangers.</p>
