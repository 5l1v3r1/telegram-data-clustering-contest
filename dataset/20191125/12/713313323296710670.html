        <b>The majority of Swiss residents are not able to buy a house, a new study shows.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Conducted by the Swiss Home Owners <a href="https://www.hev-schweiz.ch/news/detail/News/hev-immobilienumfrage-wohneigentum-wird-weiterhin-teurer/">Association </a>(HEV), the findings of the annual survey are based on a poll of more than 200 real estate experts.</p>
      <p>They forecast rising house prices, due partly to the limited availability of single-family dwellings.</p>
      <p>The survey shows that while 13,000 new homes were planned in 2000, only 7000 had been built by 2016.</p>
      <p>House prices in Switzerland increased by six percent last year.</p>
      <p>The forecast is also dire for apartment ownership.</p>
      <p>The HEV survey confirms the findings of another study, carried out earlier this month by the <a href="https://www.raiffeisen.ch/content/dam/www/rch/pdf/publikationen/wohnimmobilien-schweiz/de/2019/wohnimmobilien-schweiz-4q19.pdf">Raiffeisen Bank</a>, showing that apartment prices rose by two percent in 2018</p>
      <p>However, there is good news in the rental property market.</p>
      <p>Because a large number of rental apartments are empty — in the last few years, their number has doubled, the study says — prospective tenants have a good selection to choose from and at reasonable prices.</p>
      <p>Currently, <a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/switzerland/home-ownership-rate.%20But%20the%20cost%20may%20not%20be%20the%20only%20reason%20for%20low%20ownership%20rate.">42.5 percent</a> of Swiss residents own a home. </p>
      <p>One possible explanation for low ownership rate may be that Swiss laws are more favourable for tenants, as they pay significantly less income tax than homeowners.<br/> </p>
