      <h1>Elon Musk's Weird 'Elon Tusk' Twitter Posts Finally Explained through Rick and Morty Cameo</h1>
      <h2>Musk's elephant references now all make sense.</h2>

      <p>It's fun and it's a great way of promoting yourself: get yourself a cameo on the Rick and Morty show. It also explains the reasons Elon Musk posted some interesting and intriguing Twitter comments in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/11/25/elon-musk-rick-and-morty-cameo-elon-tusk">March this year</a>. </p>
      <p>Everything is clicking into place since the fourth season of the <a href="https://www.rickandmorty.com/">Rick and Morty</a> show has aired. Elon Musk's cameo appearance as 'Elon Tusk' explains why Tesla's CEO Twitter name had changed to <a href="https://time.com/5541819/elon-musk-elon-tusk-twitter/">Elon Tusk</a> earlier this year.</p>
      <p>It also sheds light on why Musk was making so many elephant references. </p>

      <p>Could it be a coincidence that the airing of the episode falls just a few days after Musk unveils his shiny new <a href="https://interestingengineering.com/teslas-stainless-steel-futuristic-cybertruck-has-arrived">Cybertruck</a>?</p>
      <h3>The Rick and Morty 'Elon Tusk' episode</h3>
      <p>Rick and Morty is a humorous, and at times hilariously educational, animation show for adults. Cameos of celebrity guests are a regular occurrence on the widely watched show, and its fourth season is no exception.</p>
      <p>In their recently aired "One Crew Over the Crewcoo's Morty" episode, none other than Tesla's CEO, Elon Musk appeared — bearing ridiculous and hilarious tusks for teeth. </p>

      <p>Musk's cameo finally explains his bizarre and previously unexplainable Twitter jokes and name change earlier this year.</p>
      <p>In the episode, Musk voices his character's speech. Named Elon 'Tusk', he is basically an alternate universe version of Tesla's main man, the only difference being the<b> two big tusks</b> protruding from the sides of his mouth.</p>
      <p>But, as Elon Tusk explains himself, these <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/11/25/elon-musk-rick-and-morty-cameo-elon-tusk%5C"><b>two tusks</b></a> help keep his ego in check, making him more agreeable than his non-tusked self.</p>
      <p>In the episode, Rick and Morty and Elon Tusk carry out an exciting heist operation. </p>
      <p>One must wonder, however, about the perfect timing of the airing of the show, and Musk's unveiling of his new all-electric <a href="https://interestingengineering.com/7-ways-the-internet-commented-on-tesla-cybertruck">Cybertruck</a>... Some Twitter followers are dubious, and are enjoying sharing their opinions about the matter: </p>
