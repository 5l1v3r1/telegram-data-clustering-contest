      <p>Gaston Sirino could be set to miss an important domestic clash for Mamelodi Sundowns, should one of their encounters be postponed.</p>
      <p>The 28-year-old Uruguayan picked up a red card booking on the weekend, which sees him suspended for two of Sundowns’ domestic fixtures.</p>

      <p>The Brazilians will be without the playmaker tomorrow when they lock horns with AmaZulu FC in the Absa Premiership, where thereafter, his second suspension might be served on the final of the Telkom Knockout competition on December 14.</p>
      <p>According to Siya sources, there is a slight possibility that Sundowns’ next league clash against Stellenbosch FC on December could be postponed by request of the club, in preparation for the final. Sundowns are scheduled to play the Western Cape-outfit on December 11.</p>
      <p>The Brazilians play their opening CAF Champions League group stage fixture this weekend, November 30 against Petro de Luanda, where they will thereafter travel to Morocco to face Wydad Casablanca on December 07.</p>
      <p>Now, according to sources, once all is confirmed, the Premier Soccer League will be expected to make an official announcement about fixture postponements. </p>
