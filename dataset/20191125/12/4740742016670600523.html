      <p>A number of Bristol drivers are urging the local authority to put up more signs on a road in the city that’s just for buses after being accidentally caught out and served with penalty charge notices.</p>
      <p>Romney Avenue in Bristol has a section which is closed off to vehicles except buses but some drivers believe there are not enough signs to make it clear that cars can’t <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/traffic-travel">travel</a> along that stretch of road.</p>
      <p>The road markings say 'Bus Gate' but drivers are asking why the road doesn’t say 'Buses Only' - and more than 4,000 people have been fined already this year.</p>
      <p>The council insists signs are clear but told Bristol Live drivers can appeal if they feel they were issued a notice incorrectly.</p>
      <p>Drivers caught by the bus cameras on Romney Avenue will receive a fine of £60, which is reduced to £30 if paid within 14 days.</p>
      <p>However, if the charge is not paid within 28 days, the cost rises to £90.</p>

      <p>Lisa Goodfellow, who lives in <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/filton">Filton</a>, says she and her partner got caught out and are now appealing the fine.</p>
      <p>She said: “We were on our way to view a flat as we are being made homeless due to our landlord not paying the mortgage.</p>
      <p>“We took a wrong turning which the sat nav told us to take. We did not know anything about it until the fine showed up.”</p>
      <p>Another driver agreed that it is an “easy mistake to make” having driven up there accidentally.</p>
      <p>They said: “A no entry except buses sign would be good - and more signs in the lead up to the bus lane.”</p>

      <p>A Bristol City spokesperson said: “We made signage clear to indicate what vehicles are allowed to use the bus gate.</p>
      <p>"From the start of 2019 until November 20, we have served 4,819 penalty charge notices to people who have incorrectly driven down it.</p>
      <p>"If anyone feels they received a penalty charge notice that was incorrectly issued, they can make an appeal via our website.”</p>
