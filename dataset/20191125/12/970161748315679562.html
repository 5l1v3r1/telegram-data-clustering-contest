      <p>Jade Rowan (Lottie Henshall) has had Coronation Street viewers on edge since she arrived in <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/fiz/">Fiz Stape</a>’s (<a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jennie-mcalpine/">Jennie McAlpine</a>) household – from the off, it was clear that she was up to something sinister and had ulterior motives for offering to be Hope’s tutor and nanny.</p>
      <p>She will soon get bad news from Fiz, which won’t go down too well – <a href="https://www.itv.com/coronationstreet/previews/preview-pictures-michelles-wedding-revenge">brand new pictures revealed by ITV’s preview site</a> show the moment that Fiz tells Jade that her services are no longer required. But you can be that this isn’t the last that she and Tyrone Dobbs (Alan Halsall) will hear from her.</p>
      <p>The picture captions tease: ‘Evelyn quizzes Jade about her new job but she remains tightlipped, and shows an apparent lack of emotion when saying goodbye to Fiz. Is this the last we’ll see of Jade?’</p>
      <p>Well, in short, not a chance!</p>

      <p>Jade has got her feet under the table and tonight, viewers will be no doubt suspecting foul play <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/coronation-street-spoilers-fire-horror-revealed-fiz-stape-sinister-nanny-jade-11175890/">when a fire spreads in the back yard of the house</a>. When Hope is found staring at the flames hungrily, Fiz realises her pyromaniac youngster must have been behind it – even though Jack Webster says that the fire had already started when they arrived.</p>

      <p>With Fiz fearing that Hope has a serious problem with arson and it could lead to something even more terrible happening, she confides in Tyrone that Hope was behind the factory fire and she covered up the truth.</p>
      <p>As Tyrone hits the roof, there is a clear divide in the family – is this what Jade wanted? And was she involved in the blaze that Hope is getting the blame for?</p>
      <p>Next year, things get even more serious when <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/24/coronation-street-spoilers-demonic-nanny-jade-rowan-destroys-fiz-stape-in-horror-scheme-11000174/">Fiz and Tyrone have their children taken away from them by social services</a> – after Jade accuses them of abuse. But just what does Jade have against the couple – and will she be on a mission to rip the family apart forever?</p>
