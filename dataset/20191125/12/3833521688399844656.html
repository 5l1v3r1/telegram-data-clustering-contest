      <h1>GE hires Maersk executive for CFO post as Culp extends revamp</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T12:53:43+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 12:53</time> by <a rel="author">Richard Clough</a></address>
      <p>General Electric Co. hired Carolina Dybeck Happe as its next chief financial officer, giving top boss Larry Culp a new partner to help tackle one of the trickiest turnaround efforts in corporate America.</p>
      <p>Dybeck Happe, who is resigning as finance chief at A.P. Moller-Maersk A/S, will replace Jamie Miller in early 2020, GE said in a statement Monday. The incoming executive will oversee GE’s global finance organization and activities including accounting, tax planning and internal auditing.</p>
      <p>The hiring was the result of “a rigorous global search process,” Culp said in the statement. Dybeck Happe “brings a compelling blend of strategic and capital allocation discipline, well-honed operating skills, and transformational leadership abilities.”</p>
      <p>The move answers a question that has hung over GE since July, when Culp said he would seek a new No. 2 to help him turn the company’s fortunes around. Dybeck Happe, 47, will face major challenges from day one, including strained cash flow, a balance sheet weighed down by debt and federal investigations of GE’s accounting.</p>
      <p>GE was little changed before regular trading Monday in New York. The shares surged 59 per cent this year through Nov. 22, outpacing the broader market as GE partially rebounded from a deep slump.</p>
      <p>Dybeck Happe, who joined Maersk in January, becomes the latest executive to depart the world’s biggest container shipping company as it grapples with a tough market amid a global trade war. The company lost its chief operating officer two weeks ago. Dybeck Happe previously spent 16 years at lock manufacturer Assa Abloy AB.</p>
      <p>Culp, a longtime Danaher Corp. leader who became chief executive officer at GE last year, said in July that he thought the time was right to change his finance chief. Miller took the job in 2017 under then-CEO John Flannery and continued to oversee GE’s finances while the company sought a replacement.</p>
