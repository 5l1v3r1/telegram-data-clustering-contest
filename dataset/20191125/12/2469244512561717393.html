      <p>A Devon family has committed to change farming by converting modern farmland back to traditional wildflower meadows.</p>
      <p>The move, undertaken by the Cooke family on their farm in Bishops Nympton, will promote a method of farming which offsets carbon and benefit bees and wildlife.</p>
      <p>Matthew Cooke, the Wildflower Farmer, believes a change is urgently needed to counter the influence of supermarkets and processors that demand more for less from the farming community, pressures that drive prices and negatively affect wildlife and the countryside.</p>
      <p>With that, the Cooke family has taken the first act to convert their land to wildflower meadow. The family hope this act will be a catalyst for other farmers to return to wildflower meadows to help protect and benefit the environment.</p>
      <p>But to be financially viable, they need public support.</p>

      <p>Mr Cooke said, “Our farming family is committed to this change. If the country truly wants to see a return to wildflower meadows and believes in preserving the nation’s wildlife and offsetting carbon, a partnership between farmers and the public is the only way we can make this happen.</p>
      <p>"Only together can we achieve meaningful change, as the majority of lost meadowland is under farming ownership."</p>
      <p>Matthew and Clare started farming at Great Avercombe in 2009. Their children Naomi, Phoebe and William are the sixth generation at the farm, and now talk of being farmers there in the future. The Cookes have been farming land at Great Avercombe for almost 150 years.</p>

      <p>The Wildflower Farmer website states: "Saving the bees, supporting wildlife and reversing climate change will not be achieved without changes.</p>
      <p>"We will only achieve that goal by working in partnership; farmers, councils and garden owners together each doing our bit to create more wildflower ecosystems.</p>
      <p>"The 97% decline in wildflower meadows since the Second World War is not a natural event, it has occurred due to farming practices driven by consumer and Government demands in the UK.</p>
      <p>"In the 1950's there was a food shortage and farmers were tasked with increasing supply to help feed the nation. These demands involved ploughing up wildflower meadows to grow crops such as potatoes and cereals for both human and livestock consumption."</p>
      <p>It adds: "After the war, when it came to replant the grass fields, there was not a stock of seed that would replicate the meadows which were previously there as these had evolved over hundreds of years.  Farmers replanted with a grass seed mix which was high yield. They did not use any wildflower seeds as wildflowers were classed as weeds as they do not have a high feed value.</p>

      <p>"The effect was further exacerbated by the arrival of large supermarkets in the latter part of the 20th century who continue to demand more for less from farmers, locking the farming community into a method of farming that is high yield and cheap in terms of food production, not allowing for the return to traditional wildflower meadows.</p>
      <p>"Our vision is to convert modern meadows back to wildflower meadows, creating a panorama that is full of colour against the skyline. We can only do this with your help. We have already started, believing it to be right."</p>
      <p>To back the Cooke family's cause, you can become a Wildflower Farmer via a subscription which will see supporters receive their own pouch of wildflower seeds, taken from the same batch sown on the Devon farm.</p>
      <p>They also create personalised wedding seed favours.</p>
      <p>Businesses can get on board too by teaming up with the farm. More information can be found on the  <a href="https://www.wildflowerfarmer.co.uk/">Wildflower Farmer here.</a></p>
