      <p>TAIPEI, Nov 25 — Two directors of a Hong Kong-based investment fund are being held in Taiwan over sensational claims made by a Chinese defector, the company said today, in an unspooling spy saga dismissed by Beijing as “a clumsy farce”. </p>
      <p>Wang “William” Liqiang gave interviews to Australian media last week alleging he had given up Chinese spy secrets to Canberra’s counter-espionage service.</p>
      <p>Among the juicy details of his apparent tradecraft the 26-year-old Chinese national alleged he was recruited by the directors of a Hong Kong-based investment firm as cover for infiltrating the city’s pro-democracy movement.</p>
      <p>The reports said Wang alleged he was hired by Xiang Xin and Kung Ching, of the Hong Kong-registered China Innovation Investment Limited, to conduct spy-ops inside the territory as well as Taiwan and Australia.</p>
      <p>Australian newspapers <i>The Age </i>and <i>Sydney Morning Herald</i> said Wang had given Australia’s counter-espionage agency the identities of the pair. </p>
      <p>Today the two directors were stopped as they tried to leave Taipei’s Taoyuan Airport, China Innovation Investment Ltd said in a statement.</p>
      <p>They are “staying in Taiwan” to cooperate with local investigators, the company said, denying any links to Wang or his claims.</p>
      <p>Taiwan’s Interior Minister Hsu Kuo-yung confirmed the pair were being held but told reporters he was unable “to comment on the specifics due to confidentiality of an ongoing investigation.”</p>
      <p>The company, which on its website says it invests in energy products, also rubbished any link with Wang.</p>
      <p>“Wang Liqiang was never an employee of the group,” it said, calling the Australian news reports “fictitious and forged”.</p>
      <p>It fits a pattern of outright denials emerging from Beijing, which has rubbished Wang’s lofty claims as bluster from an “unemployed” fraudster on the run from a suspended jail sentence.  </p>
      <p>Speaking in Beijing on Monday Foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang took a swipe at the “wrong positions” reported by some Australian media who have “acted out a clumsy farce”.</p>
      <p>“They have insisted on believing a suspected criminal with no credibility whatsoever”, Geng said accusing the reports of “smearing and fabrication of rumours against China to an extreme”.</p>
      <p>Wang is currently living in Sydney with his wife and infant son on a tourist visa and has requested political asylum, according to Australian reports.  — AFP</p>
