      <p>West Ham United apparently made contact with Inter Milan over Valentino Lazaro recently, but were immediately rebuffed.</p>
      <p><a href="https://m.fcinternews.it/esclusive/fcin-lazaro-dubbi-fugati-l-inter-e-conte-credono-in-lui-respinto-un-recente-sondaggio-del-west-ham-323721">According to FC Inter News</a>, the Hammers were keen to learn about the 23-year-old’s availability, having featured very little for the Italian giants following his summer move from Hertha Berlin.</p>

      <p>Despite his lack of game time at San Siro, the club will not be allowing him to depart with manager Antonio Conte making it clear he does plan to use him more as the season wears on.</p>
      <p>Natural winger Lazaro, a 28-cap international who has previously been branded the best player to come out of Austria since David Alaba (<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/45983952">BBC Sport</a>), can also play at right-back, central midfield from the left and even as a second striker.</p>
      <h3>TBR’s view – Surely a waste of time</h3>
      <p>Lazaro is an exciting and extremely versatile player but surely West Ham shouldn’t be looking at players who have just signed for a new club.</p>

      <p>The Hammers probably do need to strengthen in the wide areas, but a move for the talented Lazaro was simply never feasible.</p>
      <p>Inter paid €22 million/£20 million for a reason (<a href="https://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/lazaro-completes-22m-inter-move-from-hertha-berlin/r40c62ipdv211bh0t32cbf2vx">Goal</a>), and he will eventually become a starter for the Nerazzurri.</p>
