      <p>Maurice Robinson, 25, of Northern Ireland, allegedly part of a global smuggling ring, admitted to assisting unlawful immigration between May 1, 2018 and October 24, 2019 and being paid for it.</p>
      <p>However, he pleaded not guilty to 39 counts of manslaughter during his court appearance in London Monday.</p>
      <p>The defendant was remanded to custody until a further hearing on December 13.</p>
      <p>The bodies of 31 men and eight women, all of them Vietnamese, were discovered in a refrigerated container truck at the Waterglade Industrial Park in Grays, Essex County, east of London, on October 23. <a href="https://e.vnexpress.net/news/news/youngest-victims-in-uk-truck-tragedy-were-15-4009311.html">The youngest victim was 15 years old</a> and the oldest was 44.</p>
      <p>British police have so far arrested six people for their involvement in the disaster. Another accused, 23-year-old Christopher Kennedy, also of Northern Ireland, has been charged with human trafficking and was due to appear in court Monday.</p>
      <p>In Vietnam, police have arrested 11 people, nine in the central province of Nghe An and the two others in neighboring Ha Tinh Province, for suspected involvement in human trafficking.</p>
      <p>The bodies of the 39 victims are still in the U.K. Vietnam is discussing with U.K. authorities the technical issues in the transferring of their remains.</p>
      <p>The Vietnamese government has decided to <a href="https://e.vnexpress.net/news/news/vietnam-offers-loans-for-families-to-get-uk-tragedy-victims-home-4015317.html">make advance payments</a> to make sure the victims are brought home as soon as possible. It will cost $1,771 to receive the victim’s ashes and $2,855 for the bodies to be brought back in coffins.</p>
      <p>Most families want the bodies of loved ones repatriated, and a few have opted for ashes.</p>
