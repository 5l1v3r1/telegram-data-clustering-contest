      <p>Former Ukrainian Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin has said Russia will not stop at the annexation of Crimea and the occupation of parts of Donbas, since the aggressor needs the entire territory of Ukraine's south.</p>
      <p>"Russia will keep working very consistently to gain control over the south of Ukraine. Preventing this is one of our main tasks," Klimkin <a href="https://twitter.com/PavloKlimkin/status/1198681189114142720?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1198681189114142720&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.unian.net%2Fpolitics%2F10766846-ne-tolko-krym-klimkin-zayavil-o-namereniyah-rossii-otnositelno-rasshireniya-anneksii.html">wrote </a>on Twitter on November 24, 2019.</p>
