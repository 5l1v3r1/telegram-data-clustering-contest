      <h2>Royal Family: The Next Generation</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T12:00:19+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 12:00</time> by <a rel="author">Neil Shaw</a></address>
      <p>A team of designers have created a series of concept images to give an idea of what the current generation of royal babies will look like in 20 years time.</p>
      <p>Designers at beauty discovery website <a href="http://www.cosmetify.com/">www.cosmetify.com</a> have created pictures which show what the royal babies could look like when they’re older. The images are of Prince George, Princess Charlotte, Prince Louis, Archie and Savannah Phillips.</p>
      <p>If the experts are right, this is what our Royal Family will look like as we head in 2040.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Savannah Phillips</b>
      </p>

      </figure>
      <p>Age: 30</p>
      <p>Savannah has got extremely fair hair like her mother, and is wearing it in a tight bun. Her nose and eyes take after her mother, whilst the mouth is closer to Phillip’s.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Prince George</b>
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.devonlive.com/incoming/article3575146.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_PA-44808054.jpg"/>

        <img src="https://i2-prod.devonlive.com/incoming/article3574357.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Prince-George.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Age: 27</p>
      <p>George has been envisaged with a slicked-to-the-side blonde quiff, with hair beginning to recede, like William’s. With a nose similar to Kate’s, he also has a solid jaw and round, brown eyes.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Princess Charlotte</b>
      </p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>Age: 25</p>
      <p>Charlotte has been imagined to sport dark hair like her mother but dyed darker. Her slim nose and piercing eyes remain the same, though her jaw is slightly more chiselled</p>
      <p>
        <b>Prince Louis</b>
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.devonlive.com/incoming/article3575164.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_PA-42469885.jpg"/>

      </figure>
      <p>Age: 22</p>
      <p>Louis has got fairer hair like William, with a squarer jaw than his brother, similar to Prince Andrew. He has slightly chubby cheeks and a similar nose shape to William, with eyes similar to Kate.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Archie</b>
      </p>
      <figure>

        <img src="https://i2-prod.devonlive.com/incoming/article3574356.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Prince-Archie.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Age: 21</p>
      <p>The team has imagined that Archie will take Harry’s hair colour but slightly darker, in tight curls. The nose takes after Harry’s, whilst the eyes are more similar to Meghan’s. Archie has freckles and a light beard.</p>
