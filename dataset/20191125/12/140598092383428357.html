      <h1>UK Athletics' new chief executive forced to stand down before job begins amid husband safeguarding scandal</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T12:07:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 12:07</time> by <a rel="author">Tom Morgan, Sports News Correspondent , Ben Rumsby</a></address>
      <p>UK Athletics is in turmoil after its incoming chief executive was forced to stand down over <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/athletics/2019/11/22/incoming-uk-athletics-chief-faces-questions-husbands-coaching/">claims she failed to tell her local athletics club about her husband’s “inappropriate relationship”</a> with a 15-year-old schoolgirl.</p>
      <p>Zara Hyde Peters had been due to take up her £200,000 role on December 1, but the governing body told her to resign amid the potential reputational damage to an organisation which receives £27million of funding in the current Olympic cycle.</p>
      <p>Her enforced resignation - just weeks after <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/athletics/2019/10/08/uk-athletics-head-neil-black-leave-handling-alberto-salazar/">performance director Neil Black quit</a> over the Alberto Salazar scandal - piles yet more pressure on UKA ahead of the Olympics in Tokyo next year. UK Sport said on Monday that it will be demanding answers.</p>
      <p>Hyde Peters was left fighting to keep her job after claims her husband was wrongly allowed to continue coaching and managing at a club where she was vice-chair after he was banned from teaching over the alleged relationship with a schoolgirl.</p>
      <p>She also stands accused of having “undermined” a bullying inquiry into another coach at Coventry Godiva Harriers and of being too close to Sir Mo Farah and Paula Radcliffe to oversee UKA’s review of its relationship with the disgraced Nike Oregon Project.</p>
      <p>Chris Clark, the chairman of UK Athletics, confirmed on Monday that her dismissal had followed crisis talks on Sunday. "Following recent press reports and significant media attention focused on Zara Hyde Peters the UKA Board convened a meeting this past Sunday and discussed the situation fully," a statement on his behalf said. "Following the meeting I had time with Zara to review the situation and we have agreed together, that she will now not be taking up her position as CEO on Dec 1."  </p>
      <p>Over the weekend, the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/athletics/2019/11/24/new-chief-executive-uk-athletics-brink-suspended-roles-safeguarding/">Commonwealth Games Federation had asked Birmingham 2022 to cut ties</a> with her until the scandal was resolved. UK Sport are poised to investigate the circumstances surrounding her appointment in the first place. “Maintaining the highest standards of ethical and professional conduct is crucial to the integrity of sport," a statement from UK Sport said. “We will be seeking a face to face meeting with UK Athletics at the earliest opportunity to discuss next steps.”  </p>

      <p>CGF had written to Birmingham 2022 over the weekend recommending Hyde Peters was suspended from its board and as chair of its Athletes’ Advisory Committee pending an investigation into accusations made by Martin Slevin, a recently-retired detective chief inspector and former chair of Coventry Godiva.</p>
      <p>Slevin said he would take evidence he had against Hyde Peters and her husband, Mike Peters, to UK Sport, rather than UKA, which he accused of failing to investigate properly after he first alerted it to the latter’s alleged activities more than three years ago.</p>
      <p>Peters was permanently barred from teaching in October 2012 over what a damning judgment found to be “very serious” misconduct, which included an “exchange of inappropriate photographs” with a vulnerable pupil while a PE teacher at Bilton High School, Warwickshire. He had been cleared six years earlier of sexually assaulting the same girl during a trial at Warwickshire Crown Court.</p>
      <p>John Crabtree, chair of the Birmingham organising committee of the 2022 Commonwealth Games, later confirmed Hyde Peters had also resigned from the Games’ board “to which she was appointed” by the sports minister in September last year. “She has also resigned as chair of the Birmingham 2022 Athletes’ Advisory Committee,” he added.</p>
      <p>Hyde Peters, who has not responded to repeated requests for comment, is understood to be adamant she and her husband abided by safeguarding rules at Coventry Godiva before relocating to Hampshire in 2017.</p>
      <p>She worked at UKA between 2000 and 2008, including as director of athlete development, before joining British Triathlon and overseeing the emergence of the Brownlee brothers.</p>
      <p>The scandal comes as UKA continues to deal with the fallout from the Salazar ban imposed by the United States Anti-Doping Agency. It came after a UK Athletics review into Salazar in 2015 had found “no reason to be concerned” about Farah’s coach and cleared the distance runner to continue working at his Nike Oregon Project. Salazar’s former assistant coach and whistleblower Steve Magness called the review a “sham”.</p>
