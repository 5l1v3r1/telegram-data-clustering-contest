      <p>The victim was then threatened with a screwdriver and told to stay in his front room while the offenders searched his home. The victim wasn’t injured.</p>
      <p>Inspector Chris Abbott said: “This is a particularly disgusting attack on an innocent man who has understandably been left shaken and the offenders have shown a complete disregard for the victim."</p>
      <p>Superintendent Karen Edwards added: “This must have been an absolutely terrifying experience for this elderly man. It is fortunate that he wasn’t physically hurt.</p>
      <p>"We work closely with the community and would encourage anyone who saw these individuals, or anyone acting suspiciously in the area around the time of the offence, to come forward.</p>
      <p>"Targeting vulnerable people is extremely cowardly and we will do everything we can to apprehend these offenders. As well as conducting a thorough investigation we are ensuring the gentleman receives appropriate help and support.”</p>
      <p>Lancashire Police are urging people to take some general crime prevention steps to keep themselves and their homes safe.</p>
      <p>- Avoid leaving keys where they can be seen or reached through a letter box or window.</p>
      <p>-Never open the door to anyone you are not expecting or use a chain on your door.</p>
      <p>- Consider using timer lights or leave a light on in a room and draw the curtains when you go out at night.</p>
      <p>Anyone with information can contact police on 101, quoting log number 1361 20 November.</p>
      <p>Alternatively independent charity Crimestoppers can be contacted anonymously on 0800 555 111.</p>
