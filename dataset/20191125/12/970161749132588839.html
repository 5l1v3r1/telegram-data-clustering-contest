      <p>Warning: This article contains spoilers for The Walking Dead midseason 10 finale, titled The World Before.</p>
      <p>Is that <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/25/will-michonne-return-to-the-walking-dead-questions-we-have-after-the-midseason-finale-11206658/">the last we’ll see of Michonne in The Walking Dead?</a> The midseason finale of season 10 dropped last night and appeared to wave goodbye to the fearless warrior in an unjustifiably tame exit.</p>
      <p>There’s been absolutely nothing confirmed when it comes to Michonne’s goodbye; only that <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/danai-gurira/">Danai Gurira</a> is leaving The Walking Dead at some point this cycle.</p>
      <p>So when the soldier and mother sailed away on a mission with a mysterious new character called Virgil, fans, naturally, thought that might be the last we’ll see of Michonne.</p>
      <p>Thankfully, she’s set for a much more eventful swansong before season 10 is out.</p>

      <p>‘We will check back in on [Michonne’s] story, but it won’t be the first episode back in the next season,’ showrunner Angela Kang told <a href="https://ew.com/recap/the-walking-dead-season-10-episode-8/">Entertainment Weekly.</a></p>
      <p>‘I’ll say that. There’s a little time while they’re journeying.’</p>
      <p>However, The Walking Dead is planting the seeds with newcomer Virgil. Michonne’s exit hasn’t happened yet, but it is coming.</p>

      <p>‘We were thinking for a while that it’d be interesting if, in some way, this character just kind of triggers thoughts about the past for Michonne. Just about all kinds of things,’ Kang continued. ‘And so “mercy prevails over my wrath” — obviously that’s tied to Rick, but it was first uttered by Siddiq.</p>
      <p>‘To give an eye into our process, at first, we were going to play a version where maybe Michonne and that group was sort of siloed from the information about Siddiq. But in talking with Danai, she felt like she wanted to be able to honour her connection to Siddiq, which I think was a really valuable thought. Because there is this very deep connection to her family and Carl. Siddiq was really important to Carl.</p>
      <p>‘And so then he was really important to Rick and Michonne too. And I think being able to have this comment that immediately ties both the love of her life and this dear friend who was like family to her who just died — it all kind of worked. It just felt like it kind of did this nice triple duty in the moment and our actors did an amazing job playing it.’</p>
