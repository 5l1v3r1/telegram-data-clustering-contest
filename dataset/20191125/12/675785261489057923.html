      <h2>If you were hoping for a break from politics over Christmas, you'll be disappointed if the Tories win the election - because Boris Johnson isn't slowing down for the holidays</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T12:28:31+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 12:28</time> by <a rel="author">Mikey Smith, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/mikey-smith/</a></address>
      <p>Boris Johnson plans to hold a stripped-back Queen's Speech just days before Christmas if he wins the election.</p>
      <p>It will fuel expectations the arrogant Tory leader wants to ruin Christmas by pushing his <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brexit">Brexit</a> bill to a vote while Brits are trying to settle down for a festive break.</p>
      <p>Under current plans - which could change if <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> take power - MPs will return to the Commons on Tuesday, December 17th for a speeded-up swearing in process.</p>
      <p>The Queen's Speech is currently planned for the following Thursday, December 19th.</p>
      <p>But it will be a 'dressed down' Queen's Speech - stripped of some of the pomp and ceremony as it was after the snap 2017 election.</p>
      <p>In the 2017 Queen's Speech, the monarch arrived in a car rather than the guilded carriage she usually uses for the journey from Buckingham Palace to Parliament.</p>

      <p>And for the first time since 1974 she wore "day dress" and a hat rather than robes of state and Imperial State Crown to deliver her speech.</p>
      <p>The crown was still very much a part of proceedings though - travelling in its own car to Parliament from the Tower of London, where it is kept as part of the Crown Jewels collection.</p>
      <p>It's possible Prince Charles could deliver the speech in her place if Queen Elizabeth is unable to attend in person.</p>
      <p>The news has sparked speculation Mr Johnson could be plotting to bring his Brexit Withdrawal Agreement back for a vote as late as Monday, December 23rd - the day before Christmas Eve.</p>
      <p>Johnson yesterday suggested he wanted to push another vote as an "early Christmas present" for Brexiteers.</p>
      <p>"As families sit down to carve up their turkeys this Christmas, I want them to enjoy their festive-season free from the seemingly unending Brexit box-set drama," he said in a statement ahead of the Tory manifesto launch.</p>
      <p>But keeping the Commons sitting until the 23rd means MPs could still be banging on about Brexit while families are wrapping their presents, preparing the starters for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/christmas-dinner">Christmas dinner</a> and wanting to settle down with a mulled wine to watch Die Hard.</p>
