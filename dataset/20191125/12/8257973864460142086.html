      <p>Nov. 24 (UPI) -- Authorities said they are searching for suspects after two boys were shot dead while sitting in a Northern California elementary school parking lot.</p>
      <p>The Union City Police Department <a href="https://www.facebook.com/unioncitypd/photos/a.1259337230750301/3152105264806812/?type=3&amp;__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARAKRIowX5830hC31lhpNoVJ_00cqXJsZzHbsgsAbEnu-6E0Bm4ws_Daj9myRTaJFmawC9X1RZp5sAnIZW7DqCHLN9-r7Ln92M3DTRsEiLk2HxW4mHBlUvbIhVsUpW-1C-ibwcVvQydb4i2_VnMSvvPwSJKJLdV3Q0JLOtutBcGoaYix4XxJGfiwgmUqqrWeWcIo5BJowiaDIonAkv3EPCTlFMOnMT-sbLtVpZsd9rgvdyqCjX_fqvY-gZeujzlldGoNZfCZx4BQDtr0uSlo4OSlie0z5B9jCiYMCOtEDtRDe6o6BESaGW75suOFPJN3TiPjmmyZZAohuAilzuU3wSqiLA&amp;__tn__=-R">said</a> the boys, ages 11 and 14, were sitting in a van in the parking lot of Searles Elementary School, some 22 miles from San Jose, early Saturday when they were confronted by an unknown number of suspects and shot multiple times.</p>
      <p>The shooting happened at around 1:26 a.m., the New Haven Unified School District said in <a href="https://www.mynhusd.org/apps/news/article/1129917">a statement</a>, adding that one was a student in the district and the other a former student.</p>
      <p>Police said the 14-year-old boy died at the scene and the 11-year-old died while being transferred to a hospital.</p>
      <p>"At this time, the department has not ruled out the possibility that the incident was gang-related, but that possibility is currently unverified," the police department said. "Crime scene investigators have collected several items of evidence including shell casing."</p>
      <p>Officials said detectives are "diligently" looking for a motive, but were unable initially to provide a description of the guns used in the shooting or how many were fired.</p>
      <p>"We will have support for our students and staff ... when school resumes after the Thanksgiving break," New Haven Unified School District Superintendent John Thompson said. "We also work closely with the UCPD to ensure that our schools are as safe as they can be."</p>
      <p>The school shooting occurred less than two weeks after a Nathaniel Berhow, 16, opened fire at Saugus High School in Santa Clarita on <a href="https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2019/11/14/At-least-2-dead-3-injured-in-shooting-at-LA-area-high-school/4841573748472/">Nov. 14</a>, killing two people before turning the .45-caliber gun on himself. He later died of his wounds.</p>
