      <h1>Jerry Jones doesn't seem pleased with Jason Garrett after Cowboys' loss to Patriots</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T12:23:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 12:23</time> by <a rel="author">James Crabtree-Hannigan</a></address>
      <p>The Cowboys laid another egg against a quality opponent Sunday, failing to find the end zone in a 13-9 road loss to the Patriots. Teamowner and general manager Jerry Jones was rather unhappy with Dallas'showing.</p>
      <p>The 77-year-old didn't hold back in his post-game media session, voicing his frustration with a team and coaching staff that was expected to produceSuper Bowl contender this year but instead is just a game above .500 at 6-5.</p>

      <p>Jones talked rather extensively about Dallas' special teams. New England's first and only touchdown was set up by a blocked punt, and the Cowboys missed a field goal and struggled to cleanly field kickoffs and punts.</p>

      <p>Coach Jason Garrett is in the final year of his contract, and between the team's underperformance and comments such as these from Jones, signs are pointing to Dallas having a new leader in 2020.</p>

      <p>If the Cowboys do fire Garrett by season's end, at least one report suggests he <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/cowboys-fire-jason-garrett-giants-coach/rdx69tdmxrsc12vqmqh8zs8b3">could land with the division-rival Giants</a>. NFL Media noted Sunday morning that New York has "emerged as a real and legitimate potential landing spot for Garrett" should Dallas fire its coach and the Giants also fire Pat Shurmur.</p>
      <p>Pro Football Talk's Mike Florio speculated later Sunday that the Giants report <a href="https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2019/11/24/report-if-fired-jason-garretts-preferred-destination-is-the-giants/">could have been leaked</a> by Garrett's camp in an effort to maintain leverage.</p>
