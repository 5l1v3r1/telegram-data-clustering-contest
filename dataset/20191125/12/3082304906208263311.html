        <b>Paulo Dybala sees similarities between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo having played with them for Argentina and Juventus respectively.</b>

      <p>Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo are “monsters” who are convinced they are the best player on the pitch in every game, according to Argentina and Juventus forward Paulo Dybala.</p>
      <p>The duo are among the greatest players of all time and have won a combined 10 Ballon d’Or trophies since 2008.</p>
      <p>Dybala has played alongside Ronaldo at Serie A champions Juve since the Portugal international’s move from Real Madrid ahead of the 2018-19 campaign and has teamed up with Barcelona superstar Messi for Argentina over the last four years.</p>
      <p>Having seen both players at close quarters, the 26-year-old believes they share a lot of similarities.</p>
      <p>“Outside the pitch they are two very quiet people, but inside they are two monsters,” he told Spanish newspaper El Pais.</p>
      <p>“I heard Luis Scola [Argentinian basketball player] said both Leo and Cristiano enter the field convinced that they are the best and that is why they are the best. And I am sure that is so.</p>

      <p>“My friends used to tell me: ‘You have the best in the national team and now they bring you the best one at your club’. I replied: ‘It is an advantage for me.’</p>
      <p>“I can study them every day. Who doesn’t want to play with the best? We are talking about two phenomenal players; two players who are one or two steps above the rest.</p>
      <p>“They are at the top on a football level and also at a mental level. It is not easy to keep going and score 40 goals every year. It is crazy.</p>
      <p>“In the history of football, great players have played at great teams and have not achieved what they did. They have been good for each other.”</p>
