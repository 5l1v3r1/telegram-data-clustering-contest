      <p>"When I take to the pitch, I do not think about Cristiano having been there before me, nor that I must do better than him" Hazard told <a href="http://www.leparisien.fr/sports/football/psg/real-psg-si-demain-je-peux-faire-venir-mbappe-les-confidences-d-eden-hazard-24-11-2019-8200728.php">Le Parisien</a>. "Other people will make comparisons.</p>
      <p>"I will not score more goals than Cristiano, that is for sure."</p>
      <p>The 28-year-old has scored once in eight La Liga appearances so far this season and is yet to find the net in the Champions League.</p>
      <p>"A <i>Galactico</i> is a player who scores goals and wins for his team" he added. "I was probably one with Chelsea. Here, for now, I am like a young guy who comes with the ambition of trying to win his role. I must be consistent first, scoring goals and winning titles."</p>
      <p>Real Madrid have recovered from a disastrous start to their Champions League campaign, beaten 3-0 in Paris in September, to sit second with seven points -- five behind PSG.</p>
      <p>Hazard has faced some criticism for a slow start to the season and said he did return from his summer break overweight.</p>
      <p>"People were right" he said. "I was coming off the back of three weeks of holiday and I enjoyed it.</p>
      <p>"I have always been somebody who relaxes during the summer. I knew that I would be criticised more with Real than with Chelsea, but that is not a problem."</p>
