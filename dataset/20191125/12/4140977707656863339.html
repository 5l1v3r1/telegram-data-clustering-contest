                      <p>Even after losing their stars like Frenkie De Jong and Matthijs De Ligt this summer, Ajax has continued to maintain their form as they are at the top of the table of the league after winning 12 games and drawing 2 out of 14 games played so far, thus they are yet to be defeated.</p>

                          <p>Ajax is even at the top of their group in the Champions League while <a href="https://thesportsrush.com/what-do-chelsea-have-to-do-in-order-to-ensure-champions-league-knockout-qualification-chelsea-fc-news/">competing with sides like Chelsea</a>, Valencia and Lille in the group. The form by this Ajax side was continued last night too as they defeated Heracles by 4-1.</p>

                            <p>Promes scored a brace including the beautiful goal by Ajax being talked about, later Zakaria Labyad was also on the score sheet while Klaas Jan Huntelaar added a late fourth.</p>
                            <p>Cyriel Dessers scored a late consolation goal for a totally outclassed Heracles side. Erik Ten Haag’s side is once again tipped to be successful in Europe this season, the Dutch champions reached to the semi-final of the Champions League last season, they were dramatically eliminated by Tottenham Hotspurs.</p>
