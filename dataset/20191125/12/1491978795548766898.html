        <i><b>SSE Hydro, Glasgow</b><br/>Fronted by Lzzy Hale and her gale-force voice, the Pennsylvania band whip up thunder and rage – even if their solos drag on a bit</i>
      </p>
      <p>Darkness falls in the Hydro and Lzzy Hale’s gale-force voice rips through the arena before the band are visible. She has a howl for the ages, so steely and full that it’s hard to imagine how she’d fit in a venue even an inch smaller.</p>
      <p>This is Halestorm’s biggest Scottish show yet, and almost their hundredth performance of the year. The perma-touring Pennsylvania hard rockers are a slick, self-assured machine and, flanked by guitarist Joe Hottinger and bassist Josh Smith, Hale takes centre stage, lunging into power stances as if she’s braced against a hurricane.</p>
      <p>With four albums and nine EPs since their 2009 debut, Halestorm have landed on a Grammy-winning formula designed to please a crowd: buzzy, sharp verses are teamed with thunderous, surging choruses that launch hundreds of devil horns held high. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwHXqeYhtZI">Black Vultures</a>, the opening track on their latest album, is a roaring, dystopian nightmare. Uncomfortable, a biting, punky rage against the patriarchy with an enormous, grinding riff, is prefaced with a wholesome pep talk about gender in rock. “Ladies of Scotland, let me hear you scream!” Hale yells.</p>
      <p>Less convincing is the clunky lasciviousness of new song Do Not Disturb. “I love your accent / I wonder what it’ll sound like when you come” is a line made worse only by the sheer volume of its delivery. Later, Hale’s controlled, emotional version of early hit Familiar Taste of Poison, backed by a bassy drone, bleeds into a full Guitar-Hero reworking of Amen – the solos are blisteringly fast and incredibly long. Then Hale’s younger brother and band co-founder Arejay does his best to steal the show – his drum riser is half-way to the roof, brightly lit in order to highlight his circus of drumstick tricks. His showboating feels as if a show’s worth of fireworks has accidentally simultaneously exploded: it’s impressive but completely numbing after five full minutes.</p>
      <p>It clarifies, too, that Hale is the band’s centrifugal force. Halestorm are proudly uncool and when she preaches a narrative of togetherness it’s with real, visible emotion. During the encore, she sits alone at the piano with all the stage-school theatrics of a metal Lady Gaga. An iron-lunged cover of I Will Always Love You brings the house down, and leaves Glasgow’s moshers happily clinging to each other.</p>
