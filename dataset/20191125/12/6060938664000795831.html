      <p>KOLKATA: The embattled Indian archers overcame all odds to ensure two medals in the recurve and compound mixed event of the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Asian-Archery-Championships">Asian Archery Championships</a> here on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Competing under a neutral flag due to the suspension of Indian federation, the Indian archers opened their account with a bronze medal in the recurve mixed pair event where <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Atanu-Das">Atanu Das</a> and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Deepika-Kumari">Deepika Kumari</a> defeated Yichai Zheng and Shaoxuan Wei of China 6-2 without breaking a sweat.</p>
      <p>But it was the compound mixed pair team of Abhishek Verma and Jyothi Surekha Vennam who produced a stunner ousting Korea 159-154 in a one-sided affair to set up a gold medal clash with Chinese Taipei, slated for Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The team eliminations are also slated from Wednesday while Indian women will also vie for Olympic quotas in the qualifications round on Thursday.</p>
