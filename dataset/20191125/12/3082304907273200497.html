        <b>Pep Guardiola has confirmed Sergio Aguero will be out for a “few games” with a thigh injury, with the striker to miss the Manchester derby.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Sergio Aguero will miss the Manchester derby with a thigh injury sustained in the win over Chelsea, Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola has confirmed.</p>
      <p>Aguero was forced off with the injury in the 77th minute of City’s 2-1 victory in the Premier League on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Guardiola informed reporters after the match that he believed Aguero’s injury was “bad” but could not provide any further details.</p>
      <p>However, in his news conference to preview City’s Champions League meeting with Shakhtar Donetsk, Guardiola confirmed Aguero will be out of action for several weeks, meaning the striker – who has scored nine league goals this term – will miss the clash with Manchester United on December 7.</p>
      <p>“Yes,” Guardiola responded when asked if City would be without Aguero for the derby.</p>
      <p>“He will be out for a few games, don’t know exactly [how long], a few weeks, but he’ll be out.”</p>

      <p>Guardiola was unable to pinpoint Aguero’s exact issue, but suggested the problem was a muscular one in the striker’s thigh.</p>
      <p>“Exactly where I don’t know, his [thigh] tendon, at the front.”</p>
      <p>Gabriel Jesus is set to lead City’s line in Aguero’s absence, with the 22-year-old Brazil international, who has five goals in all competitions so far in 2019-20, confident he can grasp the opportunity to shine.</p>
      <p>“I’m not happy because Sergio is injured. I don’t like my friends being injured but I work here every day and I’m ready to play, because I want to improve so yes, I’m ready,” Jesus said.</p>
      <p>“It’s not easy [to wait]. I’m a guy who wants to play, wants to work and improve. I don’t feel happy because I want to play but I respect everything and keep working.</p>
      <p>“I have to do it all of the time because I am at a big club with big players and a big manager so I have to work and improve as much as possible.”</p>
      <p>Despite playing second fiddle to Aguero, Jesus insists he has no regrets over moving to City in January 2017.</p>
      <p>“When I decided to come to City I knew it was going to be hard because we have Sergio who is the top scorer of the club and scores every game, I knew this,” Jesus added.</p>
      <p>“I have a chance to play under Pep, with top players here at a big club so that’s why I came, to enjoy it and to learn.”</p>
