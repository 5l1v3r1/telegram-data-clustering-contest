      <p>One of the first things Blue Bombers fan Chris Matthew will need to do after he finishes celebrating Winnipeg's Grey Cup win is shop for trousers.</p>
      <p>Matthew promised his friends in November 2001 that he would keep wearing shorts until the Bombers won a Canadian Football League championship.</p>
      <p>It didn't happen that year — they lost to Calgary — so he's been braving Manitoba's chill winters with half his legs uncovered for the last 18 years.</p>
      <p>That all changed on Sunday when Winnipeg beat the Hamilton Tiger-Cats 33-12.</p>
      <p>Matthew was in Calgary to cheer on his team and pulled on an old pair of grey camo sweat pants over his shorts after the win.</p>
      <p>Fashion critics didn't take long to comment about his less-than-stylish wardrobe after a video popped up on social media, but Matthew says the sweats were the only pants he had that still fit.</p>
      <p>“I’ll probably have to buy a new pair of jeans or two,” Matthew told CTV News on Monday.</p>
      <p>He said his wife is happy he's going to be wearing long pants again.</p>
      <p>“Now if we need to go somewhere that pants are required, we can actually go there,” he said.</p>
