      <p>LONDON (Reuters) - Market research firm YouGov said it would publish a closely watched poll which will seek to predict the outcome of Britain’s Dec. 12 at 2200 GMT on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The multilevel regression and post-stratification (MRP) poll would be published first by The Times newspaper, YouGov said.</p>
      <p>“YouGov’s official MRP model accurately forecast the hung parliament in the 2017 General Election, even correctly projecting that seats such as Kensington &amp; Chelsea and Canterbury would be won by the Labour Party,” it said.</p>
