      <p>One of Britain’s first gay fathers is planning on welcoming his third set of twins with his new boyfriend – who previously dated his daughter.</p>
      <p>Barrie Drewitt-Barlow, 50, is already dad to 19-year-olds Saffron and Aspen, and, with husband Tony, became the first same sex couple to formally register as parents in 1999.</p>
      <p>The pair, from Essex, ended their relationship just last month, after Barrie fell in love with his assistant Scott Hutchinson, 25, who is also Saffron’s ex.</p>
      <p>However, all three men are continuing to live under the same roof, with Tony even agreeing to be a godfather when the new babies arrive.</p>
      <p>They live together in Barrie and Tony’s £6,000,000 mansion in Florida.</p>

      <p>Barrie stated that he didn’t want ‘any secrets’ and decided to share his news to ‘get any negativity out of the way before our babies arrive’.</p>

      <p>He continued: ‘Yes, it is unorthodox, but we are a loving family and our priority is to have a stable home for our kids and what is now an extended family.</p>
      <p>‘It works for us – and if people are shocked, well that’s their problem not ours.’</p>
      <p>Barrie and Tony became civil partners in 2006, before tying the knot on the first day same sex marriage became legal in 2014.</p>
      <p>But the pair ‘slid into a platonic relationship’ after Tony was diagnosed with cancer, with Barrie spending more time with Scott while his husband was in hospital last year.</p>

      <p>He then announced that the couple would be ending their relationship, but described Tony as his ‘true love’.</p>
      <p>Barrie and Scott are now both planning to fertilise an egg each, which will be inseminated into a surrogate in the next three weeks.</p>
      <p>They are also using sex selection, in the hope of having two daughters, with Barrie adding they’d be ‘princesses to spoil’.</p>
      <p>The two babies will technically be half siblings, the same as Aspen and Saffron.</p>
      <p>Barrie stated that Tony, who suffered life-threatening side-effects from radiation therapy last year, has given the couple his blessing and even helped them pick their egg donor.</p>

        <figcaption>Scott says he is now ‘best friends’ with Saffron (Picture: Instagram)</figcaption>

      <p>He told the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7721011/Gay-dad-left-husband-daughters-ex-boyfriend-revealed-planning-TWINS.html">Mail Online</a>: ‘I can’t believe that 20 years ago I was doing the exact same thing with Tony and I’m here again, full circle. I’m excited but nervous now.’</p>

      <p>Barrie and Tony are also parents to Orlando, 16, and twin boys Jasper and Dallas, nine.</p>
      <p>Scott, who is bisexual, previously dated Barrie’s daughter Saffron, but claims the pair did not have a sexual relationship.</p>
      <p>Since then, he says they have become ‘best friends’, adding that the teen ‘understands everything’.</p>
      <p>However, Saffron previously made headlines by unveiling <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/02/17/teen-daughter-britains-first-gay-dads-also-wants-surrogate-twins-7319977/">her plans to have twins with Scott via a surrogate in February 2018</a>.</p>
      <p>Speaking on Good Morning Britain at the time she said: ‘I want my parents to see my grandchildren, especially my dad since he’s ill, in case anything does happen.’</p>
