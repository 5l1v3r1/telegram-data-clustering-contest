      <p>The game was supposed to be taking place at the New Bucks Head, home of AFC Telford United, but has been changed because of problems with the pitch.</p>
      <p>It will still kick off at 7pm, and 350 tickets have been made available priced at £4 for adults and £2 for children.</p>
      <p>Mark Kennedy's side drew 1-1 against Paris Saint-Germain in the competition last week, in front of more than 5,000 fans at Molineux.</p>
