        <b>Sophia Hutchins has seemingly got over girlfriend <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/caitlyn-jenner/">Caitlyn Jenner</a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/caitlyn-jenners-girlfriend-sophia-hutchins-wants-call-im-celebrity-producers-gut-wrenching-breakdown-difficult-deal-11186724/">‘s </a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/caitlyn-jenners-girlfriend-sophia-hutchins-wants-call-im-celebrity-producers-gut-wrenching-breakdown-difficult-deal-11186724/"> ‘gut-wrenching’ breakdown</a>.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The business owner had a pep in her step as she arrived at LAX from New York after appearing on Lorraine to explain how hard it was to watch her beau suffer on I’m A Celeb.</p>
      <p>She sported black peep-toed boots, black leather trousers, black shirt, and a black coat as she talked to paparazzi.</p>
      <p>There’s no better way to slay at an airport than to wear all black.</p>
      <p>She recently appeared on Lorraine and admitted it’s been ‘gut-wrenching’ watching the 70-year-old break down on I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out of Here!</p>
      <p>After just one night in camp, the Keeping up With The Kardashians star was in buckets of tears and came dangerously close to quitting the series.</p>
      <p>The model lives with Caitlyn – who divorced mother of her two children Kendall and Kylie Jenner Kris Jenner in 2015 – in their luxury Malibu mansion, and appeared on the talk show on 20 November revealing it’s been a struggle watching her loved one in camp.</p>

      <p>‘It hasn’t been easy to watch at all. When you’re watching someone from across the globe you feel helpless to begin with,’ explained Sophia. ‘And then when you see her crying it’s been gut-wrenching to watch with everyone, and I’m watching with you.</p>

      <p>‘Producers take away everyone’s phones and we have no communication, which is interesting and difficult to deal with.’</p>
      <p>‘I want to call the producers and say no more snakes, no more bugs but we knew what she’d signed up for,’ the 23-year-old added.</p>
      <p>Caitlyn recently revealed on the show that her <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/24/im-celebs-caitlyn-jenner-declares-vanity-fair-cover-revealing-transition-massive-f-haters-11212076/">now-iconic Vanity Fair cover a big ‘f*** you to haters’</a> as she opened up about her transition.</p>
      <p>The reality star spoke bluntly and honestly about her transition in the public eye, which became fully realised in a 2015 issue of the fashion magazine.</p>
      <p>Talking to her gal pals Nadine Coyle and Jacqueline Jossa, Caitlyn spoke about the landmark moment for both her and the magazine, and said that she thought it was ‘extraordinarily important’.</p>
      <p>‘For me, this was a big FU to the millions and millions of people out there that had said terrible things about me,’ she said. ‘And it just came out and it just shocked them.’</p>
