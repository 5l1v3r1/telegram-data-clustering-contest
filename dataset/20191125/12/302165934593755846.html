      <p>KUCHING, Nov 25 — AirAsia hopes for more low-cost terminal and cheaper facilities to develop tourism in Sarawak.</p>
      <p>Group chief executive officer Tan Sri Tony Fernandes said if the airline gets low-cost airports, then the tourism industry will boom.</p>
      <p>“I still think the airport tax is very high — RM50. (For instance), Kuching to China the airport tax is RM75. We think it’s too high,” he said in a media conference here, today.</p>
      <p>Fernandes is in town to make a courtesy call on Chief Minister (CM) Datuk Patinggi Abang Johari Tun Openg at his office in Wisma Bapa, today.</p>
      <p>Fernandes said AirAsia is now looking for new places to promote and bring more tourists and jobs and lauded Sarawak for having done a good job in terms of domestic tourism.</p>
      <p>“We have limited success in international. Only Singapore has been consistently going on well. In the next round of our expansion, Sarawak is very crucial.</p>
      <p>“Read about the CM’s plan to invest in tourism infrastructure and came (here) to learn what are the plans — medical tourism, etc. We want to expand more flights (from Sarawak) into Indonesia,” he said.</p>
      <p>Fernandes said since AirAsia started 18 years ago, the airline had carried 60 million people to Sarawak and fly-through increased by 43 per cent this year, with 73,000 people coming from different countries via Kuala Lumpur.</p>
      <p>“We want to reinvest, we want to partner with the Sarawak government... a win-win scenario. And hope for assistance (in terms of) airport (low-cost).</p>
      <p>“Spoke about e-commerce and logistics. We think a lot of Sarawak’s food products can be sold in Asia. We see a lot of potentials to allow entrepreneurs to sell their products to a larger audience. We need help and promotional materials,” he said. — Bernama</p>
