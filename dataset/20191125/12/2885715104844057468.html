      <h2>WhatsApp is going to provide Facebook ad credits of $500 each to 500 startups that are approved by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT).</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T12:58:09+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 12:58</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/express-web-desk/" target="_blank">Express Web Desk</a></address>
      <p>WhatsApp has announced that it is investing $250,000 in the country’s startup ecosystem to help the entrepreneurial community connect with their customers and expand their businesses.</p>
      <p>The mobile messaging platform is going to provide <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/facebook/">Facebook</a> ad credits of $500 each to 500 startups that are approved by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT). Through these ad credits, the startups can make ads that invite their customers to click to open a chat on WhatsApp. So they can deepen connections and increase their sales.</p>
      <p>This latest investment comes following the Startup India-WhatsApp Grand Challenge which allowed the entrepreneurs to develop India-specific solutions with socio-economic impact. In that competition, WhatsApp had awarded the five winners with a grant worth $50,000 each (approximately Rs 35 lakhs).</p>
      <p>“Startups and small businesses are the lifeblood of Indian communities and are a powerful driver of local economies,” Abhijit Bose, Head of WhatsApp India said in a statement. “India’s entrepreneurs are at the forefront of bringing impactful social and economic change, and we at WhatsApp are committed to providing them support in achieving success.”</p>
      <p>According to the company, five million businesses from across the world, out of which a million are in India, are actively using the WhatsApp Business app. With the newly launched catalog feature, small businesses now have a mobile storefront for showcasing their products and services so the customers can easily find something that they might like to buy.</p>
      <p>The startup, in order to be eligible for this incentive, must be at an early traction or scalable stage and must be recognized by the DPIIT.</p>
