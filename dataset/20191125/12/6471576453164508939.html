      <p>Known under a different name in Europe, the Fit has been redesigned from the ground up as well. Revealed on October 23rd, <a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/news/2021-honda-jazz-sings-ice-out-of-the-way-to-come-only-as-hybrid-138475.html">the Jazz</a> will be exclusively available as a hybrid as part of the e:HEV strategy. There’s also a variant called Crosstar in the offing, and as the name implies, it’s a faux crossover with <a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/auto-glossary/f.html#ge-front-wheel-drive"><u>FWD</u></a>.</p>
      <p>Turning our attention back to the City, there’s no denying Gen 5 is longer and wider than the outgoing model. 4,553 millimeters in length puts it extremely close to the Civic, and as you’d expect from an entry-level sedan, the City for Thailand will be offered exclusively with three cylinders and a turbo.</p>
      <p>P10A2 is the codename of the engine, packing 122 PS (90 <a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/auto-glossary/k.html#ge-kilowatt"><u>kW</u></a>) and paired to a continuously variable transmission for the sake of efficiency. Torque is rated at 173 Nm (128 pound-feet) between 2,000 and 4,500 rpm, meaning that the 1.0-liter VTEC Turbo is more than adequate for a vehicle in this class.</p>
      <p>Scheduled to go on sale on December 24th, the newcomer will be exclusively produced at the Ayutthaya plant in the Chao Phraya River Valley. This facility located pretty close to the temples featured in the 1995 Mortal Kombat movie as well as Kickboxer of 1989 and the sequel to the first Mortal Kombat.</p>
      <p>Pricing has already been announced for the Thai market, and the most affordable City will set you back 579,500 baht. That amount converts to $19,175 at current exchange rates, and given its size, it shouldn’t come as a surprise the City is more expensive than the Jazz in this part of the world (555,000 baht).</p>
      <p>Four trim levels are offered, starting with the S, V, and SV. The RS is the range-topping option, and it certainly has the looks to fool you into thinking that Honda built a budget-oriented performance sedan as long as you opt for Ignite Red Metallic paintwork. The dashboard isn’t too shabby either thanks to modern amenities, and Honda sweetens the deal with more sound insulation for improved <a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/auto-glossary/n.html#ge-noise-vibration-and-harshness"><u>NVH</u></a>.</p>

        <p>Mr. Masayuki Igarashi, Chief Officer for Regional Operations (Asia &amp; Oceania), Honda Motor Co., Ltd., and President and CEO, Asian Honda Motor Co., Ltd., said, “Honda City, one of our most important models, was developed and launched as a regional model back in 1996. It has consistently received overwhelming feedback from the 1st through the 4th generation, with accumulated sales of four million units in 60 countries worldwide. The Asia &amp; Oceania region is an important market for Honda City, with more than 100,000 units sold in the region in 2019 (January to September 2019), which accounts for almost 70% of Honda City sales worldwide. We also consider Thailand as a key market for Honda City due to the country’s strong market potential and because it is Honda’s largest production base in the region. As Thailand is the leading market for City, today Thai people will be the first to witness the world premiere of the 5th generation all-new Honda City, which we expect to create an unprecedented phenomenon as it exceeds the expectations of customers and sets a new standard for Thailand’s automotive market once again.”</p>
        <p>Mr. Pitak Pruittisarikorn, Chief Operating Officer, Honda Automobile (Thailand) Co., Ltd., said, “Honda City has been the main contributor to driving Thailand’s automotive industry in the city car segment as it continuously set new benchmarks, becoming like an icon for this class of automobile. The model usually wins customers’ hearts and holds the top position in the subcompact market. As a result of Honda City’s achievements and its significance over the past two decades, developing the next-generation Honda City was very challenging, as we aimed to come up with a better-developed model than the previous ones and every other model in this class, along with new value added by advanced technology features and a lower price for every variant. The all-new Honda City will eventually set a new benchmark and create a new phenomenon in Thailand’s city car segment once again.”</p>
        <p>The all-new Honda City’s exterior delivers a more premium yet sportier look with sharp character lines that will really attract attention, as well as projector headlights with LED Daytime Running Lights (DRL), LED Tail Lights, Chrome Front Grille, Shark Fin Antenna, and newly-designed 15-inch alloy wheels.</p>
