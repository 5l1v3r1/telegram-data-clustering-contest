        <b>The Supreme Court will hear on Thursday an appeal filed BNP chief Khaleda Zia challenging a High Court order that turned down her bail plea in the Zia Charitable Trust graft case.</b>
      </p>
      <p>On Monday, a five-member bench of the Appellate Division of the top court led by Chief Justice Syed Mahmud Hossain fixed the date.</p>
      <p>The Appellate Chamber judge was expected to hear the petition on Monday.</p>
      <p>Khaleda was represented by lawyers Khandaker Mahbub Hossain, Moudud Ahmed, Zainul Abedin, Mahbub Uddin Khokon, Kayser Kamal and AKM Ehsanur Rahman.</p>
      <p>Attorney General Mahbubey Alam represented the state, while Khurshid Alam Khan represented the Anti-Corruption Commission.</p>
      <p>The High Court on July 31 rejected Khaleda’s bail petition in the case.</p>
      <p>Oct 29 last year, a special court in Dhaka sentenced Khaleda to seven years in prison in the case dubbed “false” by the BNP.</p>
      <p>The former prime minister was transferred to the Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University Hospital on Apr 1 this year for treatment from the old jailhouse on Nazim Uddin Road.</p>
      <p>Khaleda has been in prison since February last year serving a total of 17 years in jail in the Zia Orphanage and Zia Charitable Trust corruption cases.</p>
