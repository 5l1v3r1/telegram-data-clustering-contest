                      <h3>Watch: Pep Guardiola offers to swap the Premier League title for Liverpool’s Champions league trophy</h3>
                      <p>Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola was present at the Football Writers’ Association northern branch awards on Sunday. While speaking on the occasion he sent out a hilarious plan towards Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp. With both trophies on stage he joked:</p>
                      <p>
                        <i>“We really want this one (Champions League) and he (Klopp) really wants this one (Premier League), maybe we can swap?” “Man City are a rich club, maybe we can pay you for it!”</i>
                      </p>

                          <p>Guardiola added that he is getting frustrated by Liverpool’s ability to snatch late victories this season, something that they did again at Crystal Palace on Saturday.</p>
