      <p>"After getting off a 10 hour shift and picking [the baby] up, I had to go straight to class 45 minutes late because class starts exactly the time I get off," <a href="https://twitter.com/dawnyates_/status/1197703959449784323">Yates captioned the photo</a>, which has received more than 10,000 likes.
