      <h1>Liverpool fans react to reports Leeds and Villa want Rhian Brewster</h1>

        <b>A number of Liverpool fans have taken to Twitter to react to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/liverpool-starlet-rhian-brewster-wanted-20946287">reports from the Daily Mirror suggesting</a> that Rhian Brewster is wanted by a number of clubs heading into January – with plenty suggesting that he should head to Leeds United.</b>

      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/liverpool-starlet-rhian-brewster-wanted-20946287">The Mirror reports</a> that Brewster could leave Anfield on loan in January. The report suggested that Leeds and Swansea City are keen to take him into the Championship.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, it is also claimed that Aston Villa and Crystal Palace are interested in signing the 19-year-old for the rest of the season.</p>
      <p>It is probably not particularly surprising that most Liverpool fans want Brewster to leave on loan. The striker has only played in the Carabao Cup this season. He has also only been included on the bench once in the Premier League this term.</p>

      <p>And it appears that many Liverpool supporters think Brewster would benefit most from heading into the Championship. But there is some division over whether he should join Leeds or Swansea.</p>
      <h3>Leeds or Swansea?</h3>
      <p>Some believe that he would receive more game-time at the Liberty Stadium. It is noted that he knows Steve Cooper from his time in England’s under-17 squad.</p>
      <p>However, there are plenty who want him to go to Leeds. It should be noted that it is difficult to see the Whites making a move if Eddie Nketiah’s loan continues beyond January.</p>
      <p>But with the Whites playing some excellent football and regularly creating a load of chances for their strikers, some Liverpool fans believe that a switch to Elland Road could make a big difference to Brewster’s career.</p>
      <p>Here is what some of the Liverpool supporters make of the reports…</p>
