      <p>In general, it would be difficult to get great discounts on newest Surface products. But this year seems to be an exception. Microsoft Store is now selling Platinum Surface Pro 7 with Intel Core i5, 8GB RAM and 256GB storage for just $999. You will also get Black Surface Type Cover and Surface Pen for free. Overall, you will save around $330 from this deal. At $999, I think this Surface Pro 7 bundle offers a lot more value than competing devices in its class.</p>
      <p>Last month, Microsoft announced the new <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/microsoft-officially-unveils-surface-pro-7/">Surface Pro 7 device</a>, powered by the 10th Generation Intel Core processors. In addition to the new processors for improved performance, the Surface Pro 7 now comes with an USB-C port and support for Fast Charging.</p>
