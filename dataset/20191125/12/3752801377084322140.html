      <h1>WATCH | 'Even robbers are not safe in SA' - video of slithering man stealing from armed robber has social media in stitches</h1>

      <p>Video footage of an improbable "robbery within a robbery" is being circulated on social media, leaving South Africans perplexed.</p>
      <p>"Even the robbers are not safe in this country," @LusaphoLuuh9 said on Twitter. </p>
      <p>The incident happened at a Shoprite Usave supermarket. </p>
      <p>Video footage shows the gun-wielding robber stuffing notes from a till into his bag. </p>
      <p>The robber points his gun at two staff members, who cower in fear behind the counter.</p>
      <p>Then, out of seemingly nowhere, a man leopard crawls across the floor, picking up some of the notes that had fallen on the ground. </p>
      <p>The opportunistic man's behaviour left some social media users in stitches. </p>
      <p>"He actually cleaned the floor. Such a gentleman," Mboneni Mahlaba said on Facebook. </p>
      <p>"Jeez....that's how bad it is. A robbery within a robbery. Hope crawler is safe with his loot at the back there," commented Mzwandile Nokwindla. </p>
      <p>"I keep expecting Leon Schuster to show up in this vid!" @ZounaidOsman tweeted.</p>
      <p>Mxolisi Masilela offered a different perspective: "He's not a victim, he was doing his best to avoid the cameras, watch carefully."</p>
      <p>The Usave supermarket chain told News24 via email that the robbery had taken place around midday on November 15, at one of its supermarkets in northern Gauteng.</p>
      <p>"No-one was injured during the robbery and trauma counselling was provided for those involved," the statement said.</p>
      <p>A case was opened with local police, but no arrests have been made.</p>
