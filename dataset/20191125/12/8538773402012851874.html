      <h1>NBA Power Rankings Week 6: Lakers, Bucks, Nuggets rolling -- and here comes Luka Doncic</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T12:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 12:00</time> by <a rel="author">ESPN.com</a></address>
      <p>The 2019-20 season is just over a month old, and we've already witnessed the abrupt fall of a dynasty, the rebirth of the Lake Show, <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3945274/luka-doncic">Luka Doncic</a> becoming appointment television and, of course, the return of <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/1975/carmelo-anthony">Carmelo Anthony</a> to the NBA.</p>
      <p>Which teams are rising and falling in the final Power Rankings before the calendar flips to December?</p>
      <p>
        <i>Throughout the regular season, our panel (ESPN's Tim MacMahon, Andre' Snellings, Royce Young and Bobby Marks, and The Undefeated's Marc J. Spears) is ranking all 30 teams from top to bottom, taking stock of which teams are playing the best basketball now and which teams are looking most like title contenders.</i>

      <p>The Lakers are rolling, but they've also had a relatively easy schedule in November (they've faced only four teams all month that are currently .500 or better). But it will get much tougher in December, with two contests each against Dallas, Denver and Portland, and matchups with Utah, Minnesota, Miami, Indiana, Milwaukee and then the <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nba/team/_/name/lac/la-clippers">LA Clippers</a> on Christmas Day. <i>-- Spears</i></p>

      <p>The Bucks have won seven straight games despite the injury absence of <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6609/khris-middleton">Khris Middleton</a>, and they've done it by outscoring their opponents by 9.6 points per game. Milwaukee is currently on pace to lead the NBA in scoring differential for the second season in a row. After a tough Monday matchup with the Jazz, the Bucks face five straight teams under .500. <i>-- Snellings</i></p>

      <p>So, this is what it looks like. And the early results are in: It looks pretty darn impressive. The <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4251/paul-george">Paul George</a>-<a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6450/kawhi-leonard">Kawhi Leonard</a>-<a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2799/lou-williams">Lou Williams</a> trio has played only 27 minutes together so far, and didn't have a training camp or preseason to hone chemistry, but there already is an obvious connection. The sample size is small, yes, but their net rating is plus-27.5. And in closing situations, such as the late-game comeback against the Rockets, that group is sheer horror to try to stop. <i>-- Young</i></p>

      <p>The Nuggets just keep on keepin' on -- nothing flashy, nothing overly dominant. They just win and do it with variety. Last season there was some wonder of randomness with their success in close games, but they're doing it again: 7-2 in two-possession games. Their victory Sunday over the Suns though showed a different kind of closing prowess: a close game went to double-digits down the stretch with two-way dominance. <i>-- Young</i></p>

The answer is yes. Despite falling out of the top spot in the Eastern Conference, we learned more about this Boston team not in the win over Phoenix but in the two losses -- by a combined seven points -- to the Clippers and Nuggets. The undermanned Celtics continue to show their resilience and toughness as evidenced by the near comeback win (down 20 late in the third quarter) against Denver. <i>-- Marks</i></p>

      <p>The Rockets have regressed to their early-season defensive form during their three-game losing streak, giving up 115.6 points per 100 possessions. Asked what they could have done different defensively after giving up 137 points in Sunday's loss to the Mavericks, <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3992/james-harden">James Harden</a> said: "Everything.

      <p><a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3195/mike-conley">Mike Conley</a>'s slow start and inconsistency with his new franchise are major reasons the Jazz rank 21st in offensive efficiency (105.6 points per 100 possessions, a drop of 4.7 points from last season). So have <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2968436/joe-ingles">Joe Ingles</a>' struggles adjusting to his sixth-man role: Ingles is shooting only 33% from the field and 29% from 3-point range, and also misses the pick-and-roll chemistry he had with the departed <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4257/derrick-favors">Derrick Favors</a>. Ingles' assists (3.5 per game) are down almost a couple of dimes per game from last season. <i>-- MacMahon</i></p>

      <p>If there was ever a statement win in the first month of the season, the 76ers' 27-point blowout of <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6430/jimmy-butler">Jimmy Butler</a> and Miami would qualify. The win proved that when engaged, Philadelphia has the most formidable starting five in the NBA. It should also be noted that while the return of Butler was the headline entering the game, it was Philly's <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2581190/josh-richardson">Josh Richardson</a>, a former Heat second-round pick, who stole the show. After missing the New York game because of a hip injury, Richardson would go on to score 32 points on only 15 shots, including six 3-pointers. <i>-- Marks</i></p>

      <p>Luka Doncic is historically productive, especially for a 20-year-old. He had a 41-point, 6-rebound, 10-assist performance in Sunday's road rout of the Rockets, and it was maybe his third-most impressive performance during Dallas' <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nba/story/_/id/28157503/red-hot-luka-doncic-keeping-focus-playoff-berth">five-game winning streak</a>. And <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3102531/kristaps-porzingis">Kristaps Porzingis</a>, who struggled as he chipped off rust early in the season, is looking more and more like a legitimate co-star.

      <p>A solid five-game winning streak was snapped, and in quite embarrassing fashion. The 76ers stomped all over Butler and the Heat, and it had the feel of a putting-you-in-your-place game. The Heat have two really good wins on the season (Bucks on Oct. 26 and the Rockets on Nov. 3), and outside of that have mostly just beat everyone they're supposed to. Against the top tier, they've looked much more average than their record suggests. <i>-- Young</i></p>

      <p>The Raptors have been consistently strong all season, with all four of their losses competitive road affairs against teams a combined 28 games over .500. They continue to have contributors step up around <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3149673/pascal-siakam">Pascal Siakam</a>, who is in the midst of an MVP-level campaign. During the past four games, <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2595516/norman-powell">Norman Powell</a> has chipped in 19.5 points per game on 54.4% shooting from the field to provide a stable scoring option on the wing and help keep the offense humming even with <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3012/kyle-lowry">Kyle Lowry</a>'s (thumb) continued injury absence. <i>-- Snellings</i></p>

      <p>The Pacers have quietly reestablished themselves among the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/standings">six teams to separate</a> from the field in the Eastern Conference. The Pacers are doing it with defense, holding their past five opponents to an average of 96.2 points per game, even with two of those games coming against the high-powered offenses of the Rockets and Bucks. <i>-- Snellings</i></p>

      <p>The Suns have fallen of late, losing four of their past five games and six of the past nine after a strong start. Phoenix can blame the injury bug: Starting point guard <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4011/ricky-rubio">Ricky Rubio</a> has missed four of the past five games because of back spasms and starting center <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2968439/aron-baynes">Aron Baynes</a> has missed four straight games because of a hip flexor strain (<a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4278129/deandre-ayton">Deandre Ayton</a> remains out as he serves a 25-game suspension that will sideline him until mid-December). <i>-- Spears</i></p>

      <p>The Timberwolves got <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3059319/andrew-wiggins">Andrew Wiggins</a> back this week after an illness had sidelined him for three games, but in his first two games he has reverted to his old scoring inefficiencies with averages of 21.5 points on 22.5 attempts per game (Wiggins had averaged 31.6 points on 23.8 attempts per game during the five games leading into his illness).

      <p>There are finally signs that Brooklyn can compete on the defensive end. In their three wins during the week (Charlotte, Sacramento and New York), the Nets held their opponent to an average of 96.3 points -- this after giving up an average of 114.5 over the previous 13 games. Besides the effort on the defensive end, the highlight of the week goes to the play of <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4066328/jarrett-allen">Jarrett Allen</a>. The former first-round pick averaged 17 points and 12 rebounds in the three wins. Though the Nets have downplayed the injury to <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6442/kyrie-irving">Kyrie Irving</a>, the guard has not played since Nov. 14 and will miss the road trip this week, <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nba/story/_/id/28143066/nets-kyrie-irving-miss-celtics-return-shoulder-injury">including Wednesday's return to Boston</a>. <i>-- Marks</i></p>

      <p>The Blazers' current losing streak is far less about <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/1975/carmelo-anthony">Carmelo Anthony</a>, and far, far more about the injury to <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6606/damian-lillard">Damian Lillard</a>. The Blazers haven't been themselves for basically the entire season, and while adding Melo was desperate and necessary all at the same time, there's nothing they can do to absorb Lillard missing games. <i>-- Young</i></p>

      <p>We will learn a lot about the Hornets this week. In the midst of a four-game losing streak (2-8 in past 10), Charlotte plays at Miami on Monday and ends the week at Milwaukee on Saturday, sandwiched around two games against Detroit. However, before we look ahead, we cannot dismiss what happened to Charlotte last week. What started as a 36-point loss at Toronto ended with a complete collapse against Chicago. The loss to the Bulls, who were playing on the second night of a back-to-back, saw Charlotte blow a five-point lead with 15 seconds after consecutive 3s by <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6621/tomas-satoransky">Tomas Satoransky</a> and <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3064440/zach-lavine">Zach LaVine</a>. <i>-- Marks</i></p>

      <p>Before Sunday, the Wizards had won three of four, and despite the continued atrocious defense, were flat outscoring opponents. That slowed against the Kings in a somewhat more defensive battle -- 113-106 -- but the Wizards continue to compete. No doors are slammed on the back end of the East, and while the chances are extremely slim the Wizards actually get into the playoff mix, they might have the motivation to think they can for much of the season. <i>-- Young</i></p>

      <p>Memphis followed up a season-best three-game winning streak with an 0-3 week. Such is life with a young, rebuilding franchise. The Grizzlies' rookie duo provided a silver lining for the losing streak: No. 2 overall pick <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4279888/ja-morant">Ja Morant</a> averaged 19.7 points and 6.0 assists in the three games, and No. 21 overall pick <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3906665/brandon-clarke">Brandon Clarke</a> contributed 14.7 points and 7.0 assists while shooting 62.1% off the bench. <i>-- MacMahon</i></p>

      <p><a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3064440/zach-lavine">Zach LaVine</a> gave the struggling Bulls a temporary reason to forget their woes. LaVine scored 49 points -- with 13 3-pointers -- and hit a winning 3 in a 116-115 win at Charlotte on Saturday. LaVine joined <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3975/stephen-curry">Stephen Curry</a> and <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6475/klay-thompson">Klay Thompson</a> as the only NBA players to make 13 of more 3-pointers in a game. This big performance was on the heels of LaVine saying <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nba/story/_/id/28145351/bulls-zach-lavine-says-trust-issue-coach-jim-boylen">he sensed a lack of trust</a> from coach Jim Boylen. <i>-- Spears</i></p>

      <p>The Pistons sandwiched a blowout win over the struggling Hawks with two blowout losses of their own to the Bucks and Bulls this week. They continue to free fall, now having lost seven of their past nine games, but they have the chance to turn things around with their next five games coming against teams a combined 24 games under .500. The key to that stretch will be a home-and-home with the Hornets, whom they lost to in mid-November in their first matchup. <i>-- Snellings</i></p>

      <p>About the only thing soaring with the Hawks is <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4277905/trae-young">Trae Young</a>. The second-year guard recently became the sixth-fastest player in NBA history and the 10th-youngest in league history to make 200 career 3-pointers. Meanwhile, Atlanta has lost nine of its past 10 games, six straight overall, and only Golden State has fewer than their four wins. <i>-- Spears</i></p>

      <p>Here is what you need to know about the state of the Cavaliers before their win at home Saturday night against Portland. Cleveland was in the midst of six-game losing streak (2-9 in its past 11), including four straight losses of 19, 18, 24 and 42 points. The Cavs were also about to play a desperate Trail Blazers team without <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3449/kevin-love">Kevin Love</a>, who was out because of back tightness. What transpired was a 25-point, nine-rebound night from <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6474/tristan-thompson">Tristan Thompson</a>, and <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2528426/jordan-clarkson">Jordan Clarkson</a> having one of his most efficient games in his career: 28 points on only nine shots, including six 3-pointers. <i>-- Marks</i></p>

      <p>We thought that the Knicks had somewhat turned a corner based on the stretch of the previous four games -- two wins and two losses by a combined six points, including a defeat against Philadelphia that saw New York lead by five entering the fourth quarter. That changed Saturday night against a San Antonio team that limped into New York on an eight-game losing streak and was on the second night of a back-to-back. New York had a much better showing at the Garden on Sunday, albeit in a 103-101 loss against the Nets. <i>-- Marks</i></p>

      <p>It's more of the same for the injury-plagued Warriors. Golden State listed forward <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6589/draymond-green">Draymond Green</a> (right heel) as questionable for Monday's game against Oklahoma City after he did not practice Saturday. Injured forward <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3155535/kevon-looney">Kevon Looney</a> continues to deal with a nerve condition and will not play against Oklahoma City or Chicago this week. There is expected to be an update this week on rookie forward <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4401415/alen-smailagic">Alen Smailagic</a>, who has yet to make his NBA debut because of a sprained right ankle. <i>-- Spears</i></p>
