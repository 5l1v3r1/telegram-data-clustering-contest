      <p>After about six months in Dubai, the United Arab Emirate (UAE), Atiku Abubakar, presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), has returned to Nigeria.</p>
      <p>Atiku left the country shortly after the presidential election which he lost to incumbent president, Muhammadu Buhari of the All Progressives Congress (APC).</p>
      <p>Confirming Atiku's return to <b>Legit.ng </b>on the phone, Paul Ibe, his spokesperson, said the former vice president got to Abuja early on Monday, November 25.</p>
      <p>According to him, Atiku is likely going to Yola, the capital of Adamawa state, on Tuesday, November 26, for a condolence visit to the family of his aide, <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1277095-umar-pariya-atikus-close-aide-dies-dubai.html">Umar Pariya, who died recently in Dubai</a>.</p>

      <p>Earlier in the day, <b>Legit.ng</b> reported that <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1278661-atiku-abubakar-camp-celebrates-vice-president-turns-73.html">Atiku's loyalists and supporters celebrated him</a> on social media with Segun Sowunmi, one of his aides, setting the pace with a statement eulogising him.</p>
      <p>In the letter, Sowunmi extolled the virtue of the Adamawa politician, saying the latter had mastered the art of self-discipline and control.</p>
      <p><i>“Yours has so far been a life worthy of celebrations. Indeed the mercies of Allah must not be despised, from the beginning through a career in the public service, to such a beautiful family made up of such beautiful children and associates so numerous that cut across the length and breadth of the globe,”</i> Sowunmi wrote.</p>
      <p>An ally of Atiku had recently <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1272497-why-atiku-remained-dubai-6-months.html">explained why the former vice president remained in Dubai</a> for that long.</p>
