      <p>TORONTO — Kirkland Lake Gold Ltd. has signed an agreement to acquire Detour Gold Corp. in a deal that values the company at about $4.9 billion.</p>
      <p>Under the agreement, Detour Gold shareholders will receive 0.4343 of a Kirkland Lake share for each Detour Gold share they hold.</p>
      <p>The exchange ratio implies a value of $27.50 per Detour Gold share based on the closing price of Kirkland Lake Gold shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Friday, a 24 per cent premium to Detour Gold's closing price that day.</p>
      <p>Detour Gold owns the Detour Lake open pit gold mine in northeastern Ontario.</p>
      <p>Once the deal is completed, existing Kirkland Lake Gold shareholders will own about 73 per cent of the combined company, while Detour Gold shareholders will hold about 27 per cent.</p>
      <p>The deal requires approval by a two-thirds majority vote by Detour Gold shareholders and a majority vote by Kirkland Lake Gold shareholders, in a addition to regulatory and court approvals.</p>
