      <p>Anti-arms activists have vowed to increase protests against a warplane technology factory.</p>
      <p>Protesters chained themselves to railings on an industrial estate near Brighton, East Sussex, on Monday in an effort to block shipments.</p>
      <p>Activists turned up in the early hours of the morning, and “two or three” locked themselves to the fence, police said.</p>

      <p>The EDO MBM Technology factory is owned by a global technology giant, and has worked on parts for aircraft including the F-35 Lightning II warplane.</p>
      <p>The lock-on began at 6am on Monday morning and lasted for several hours</p>
      <p>Banners were hung up on the factory’s metal fencing, saying: “Stop the arms trade. Solidarity with Kurdistan” and “No bombs. No borders”.</p>
      <p>Sussex Police said “two or three” people chained themselves to the railings and officers were sent to the scene to monitor the situation.</p>
      <p>The police spokesman later confirmed that protesters had left the scene.</p>
