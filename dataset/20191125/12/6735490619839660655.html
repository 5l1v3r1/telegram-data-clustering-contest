      <p>“Taylor Swift made history, which is, like, unbelievable to me,” Williams said, according to <a href="https://toofab.com/2019/11/25/wendy-williams-taylor-swift-artist-of-the-decade/"><i>toofab</i></a>.</p>
      <p>“And so, good for her. She won six awards, now she has a total of 29 awards,” she continued. “That sounds unbelievable, but what sounds unforgivable, she’s got more awards than Michael Jackson!”</p>
      <p>Williams added, “And Artist of the Decade?! Is she who’s been firing you up for the last 10 years?!”</p>

      <p>The TV host then lamented the general state of public taste.</p>
      <p>“But you know what? I think that taste has cheapened through the years in a lot of things,” she said. “The quality of clothes we buy, they get tattered and torn real quick. The quality of food we buy, we’re being poisoned by a lot of crap. Just life in general I think has cheapened and I don’t mean this in a bad way to Taylor, but it’s unbelievable … I appreciate her, but Artist of the Decade?”</p>
