      <p>By Eva H.</p>
      <p>I wrote this column for you.</p>
      <p>Yes, you, the middle child and oh, honey, you’re just not that important. Have you ever heard that? Well, I have. If you are not a middle child you might be snickering at this topic, but this still might interest you.</p>
      <p>It doesn’t matter if you’re the youngest, oldest or just stuck in the middle. We all get compared to someone and let’s be honest, you hate it. Why wouldn’t you? It’s the worst. You’re not good enough; work harder, did you even practise cello? These are all the things we hear that make us sick to the stomach.</p>
      <p>Don’t get me wrong, the middle child is also amazing. I don’t have to do anything alone. I always have friends to play with — that is, if my siblings don’t hate me that day. On the other hand, I get compared to my older sibling, I get the blame of the younger sibling and I don’t get attention.</p>
      <p>I still remember the day I walked into that hospital room and life wasn’t the same. I wasn’t the baby, I didn’t have my own room, and I had to share my toys. It was all downhill from here, I thought. Later that night the nightmares began. I wasn’t allowed to crawl into my parent’s bed anymore because the “baby” was there.</p>
      <p>I was three years old, so this was the biggest thing in my life. The thing that kept me up at night, literally — he was a baby. I guess I could say I learned to love my siblings or am still in the process. But I’m not going to lie. It was a hard life and it still is.</p>
      <p>Other than my traumatic life story, there is some serious stuff about sibling ranking. As the middle child, all the pressure of the oldest is put on you to work hard and also be a good role model for the youngest. That can be a big anxiety creator for young adolescents, which can develop into worse things than just a problem to worry about.</p>
      <p>Middle children tend to be more of a puzzle. They may have behaviours of the oldest but are still very much their own person. Research from the University of Redlands in California found that middle children are more relationship-focused, which is good for their career. In a recent podcast, Dax Sheperd, who is called the Armchair Expert, talked about topics that follow up this column. I do recommend checking it out, even if you’re not a middle child. It’s very interesting and has good topics for everyone, like stuff about his childhood and career.</p>
      <p>This past Thanksgiving as we were having a family supper, I was being ignored. Like anyone does, I thought to myself, ‘Wow, if I say something really risky maybe no one would care.’ Well, that plan backfired. I cleared my voice and said made a very risky word choice that I will not repeat. Just my luck, everyone heard. Of course — because life just can’t ever go my way, that’s just not how it works.</p>
      <p>Middle children are more likely to hold in our feelings forever or until a panic attack happens. This is not good, so it’s important to share your feelings and not keep them deep down. Usually the other two siblings get more attention, so the middle child is afraid to speak their feelings. They feel like they won’t be heard.</p>
      <p>The real answer to this question is just don’t do it. Treat everyone equally and as their own person. The worst thing you can do is compare someone to someone else or compare yourself to others. It’s just not healthy.</p>
