      <h1>The West Denton mum who is on a mission to bring back community spirit this Christmas</h1>
      <h2>Zara St Clair, 46, has organised a Christmas party for children with the hope to show them a sense of community spirit</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T12:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 12:00</time> by <a rel="author">Rachael Nichol</a></address>
      <p>After moving back to Newcastle from South Africa in 2014, Zara St Clair felt something was missing.</p>
      <p>While growing up in <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/west-denton">West Denton</a>, she said there was a strong community spirit in her hometown.</p>
      <p>Zara and her family always got together to attend the annual Christmas party at <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/west-denton">West Denton Social Club</a> in the 1970s.</p>
      <p>But she was heartbroken to discover the popular festive event was no-more.</p>

      <p>Now, Zara is determined to bring her community back together again by organising a Christmas party for children.</p>
      <p>The 46-year-old said: "Every year we would look forward to the Christmas party held at the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/west-denton">West Denton Social Club.</a></p>
      <p>"My dad used to take us there when we were kids and it was great.</p>
      <p>"It was in the big concert room and being little it was so marvellous. We had very special memories there."</p>
      <p>Zara said she wants to bring the community together so the future generation will respect their area.</p>
      <p>She added: "The whole reason behind hosting this party is that West Denton has had bad press over the past two years.</p>
      <p>"We’ve had anti-social behaviour, such as kids starting fires, it has really been non-stop.</p>
      <p>"I believe we have a generation problem.</p>

      <p>"If we can target the next generation and steer them in the right direction, all the problems we have now will be a distant memory as they will be brought up properly."</p>
      <p>For £3, children attending the party will have the chance to meet Santa, take part in games and attend a mini disco.</p>
      <p>Zara’s daughter, Shawnice Leigh Arrison, will be there to take pictures to capture the community coming together.</p>
      <p>After initially posting on the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/chapel-house-1572465">Chapel</a>, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/west-denton">Denton</a> and <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/westerhope">Westerhope</a> Facebook group that she runs, Zara’s party sold out within a day.</p>
      <p>And businesses from across the area have donated prizes to ensure the children have a good time.</p>
      <p>Zara said: "Every little bit helps, let’s put community spirit back where it belongs, in the community.</p>
      <p>"As this is our first year, we require funding to get it off the ground so going forward our next party in 2020 we will organise funding during the year, this is our first of many to come."</p>
      <p>The party will be held at West Denton Social Club on December 14.</p>
