      </p>
      <p>Ed Sheeran has made a surprise cameo in a new promo for <a href="https://www.nme.com/blogs/the-movies-blog/star-wars-episode-9-release-date-trailer-1961269"><i>Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</i></a>.</p>
      <p>The singer, who has been rumoured to appear in the upcoming movie, is seen dressed as a Stormtrooper on what appears to be a set, and pops-up alongside <i>Hamilton</i> creator and <a href="https://www.nme.com/blogs/tv-blogs/his-dark-materials-episode-4-review-2571057"><i>His Dark Materials</i></a> star Lin-Manuel Miranda.</p>

      <p>The latter is dressed in a Resistance outfit alongside Naomi Ackie’s Jannah, who will make her debut in <i>The Rise of Skywalker</i>.</p>
      <p>However, while their appearances appear to point to cameo appearances in the new movie, a representative for Disney noted (via <a href="https://ew.com/movies/2019/11/24/ed-sheeran-rise-of-skywalker-cameo/"><i>Entertainment Weekly</i></a>) that they are not confirmed to appear in <i>Episode IX</i>, adding that the footage is from “fan events over the years”.</p>
      <p><i>The Rise of Skywalker</i> will act as the final instalment in the Skywalker Saga, with <i>The Force Awakens</i> director JJ Abrams returning to oversee the movie.</p>

      <p>He recently <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/jj-abrams-george-lucas-star-wars-comments-the-force-awakens-2570489">addressed criticism</a> from <i>Star Wars</i> creator George Lucas, in which the latter likened the franchise’s new owners Disney to <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/nme-341-1199225">“white slavers”</a>, something he later apologised for and called a “very inappropriate analogy”.</p>
      <p>“It’s probably a complicated thing for him,” Abrams said. “To decide you’re going to sell this thing that you created, that was your baby, to anyone – that must be more complicated than signing a check and smiling about it. But he’s been incredibly gracious. He’s been super-generous.”</p>
      <p>The director went on to explain that he “talked through a ton of different ideas and stories” with Lucas when making the first movie in the new trilogy.</p>
      <p>“Do I wish that [<i>The </i><i>Force Awakens</i>] had been his favourite movie of all time? Yes, I only wanted to do well by him,” he continued. “I would just say that I have nothing but profound respect for the guy and am still truly, even more so now, working on these movies in awe of what he created.”</p>
