      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T12:32:04+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 12:32</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/pti/" target="_blank">PTI</a></address>
      <p>The thought that he is the son of a champion shooter would weigh him down initially, also make him “conscious”. But then, there was a change in perspective, and Manavaditya Singh Rathore started reaping the rewards.</p>
      <p>Eight years since befriending guns, on the back of an impressive resume and inputs from his Olympic silver-medallist father Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore, he is eyeing selection in the Indian senior team.</p>
      <p>The 20-year-old won three gold medals in two days at the recently-concluded 63rd National Shotgun Shooting Championship here.</p>
      <p>After showing promise in junior tournaments, Manavaditya is seeking to perform in next month’s trials and stake a claim for selection in the senior team, which is teaming with an array of dazzling talent.</p>
      <p>“I am delighted to have finished my last nationals in junior with this kind of performance,” he told PTI.</p>
      <p>“Like any athlete my long-term goal is participate in the Olympics and win a medal there. But my immediate goal is to attend to make the Indian senior team,” the trap shooter added.</p>
      <p>Apart from his doctor mother, Manavaditya’s father has been one of his biggest pillars of strength.</p>
      <p>Asked if being the son of a father who has won internationals accolades in the sport helped, he said, “Initially, whenever I would take aim at tournaments, it would make me conscious. I used to feel a lot of things.</p>
      <p>“But then I thought about it long and realised that I can benefit so much from him. Since my father has been a sportsman himself, he understands it better. Yes, he did often give me tips and shared his skills with me. That surely helped.</p>
      <p>“I did try to build upon the experience and skills of my father and it really helped.”</p>
      <p>A Member of Parliament, the 49-year-old Rathore Senior served as the Union Sports Minister from September 2017 to May 2019. Work keeps him but Rathore, winner of a plethora of medals in top international tournaments, makes sure that he has time for his promising son.</p>
      <p>“A lot of times we go to the range together and shoot, and it also doubles up as picnic, so it’s nice.”</p>
      <p>Born in a family with a military and sports background, it came as no surprise when Manavaditya held the gun for the first time.</p>
      <p>Last Saturday, Manavaditya combined with Anushka Singh Bhati to claim the top honours in the mixed team trap event, his third straight gold in the tournament.<br/>A student of Delhi University’s Hansraj College, Manavaditya also won the individual junior men’s trap event and the team title in the championship.</p>
