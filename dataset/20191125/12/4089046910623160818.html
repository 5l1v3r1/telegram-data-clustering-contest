      <p>Friday, Memphis Police arrested 18-year-old Kyoko Smith for the gruesome crime.</p>
      <p>Investigators say Smith killed her grandmother's Shih Tzu, Lucy, by cutting off the dog's head and putting it in a dresser drawer.</p>
      <p>She also allegedly took the dog's heart and put it in the freezer.</p>
      <p>“I really hate to hear that; why someone would do that to a dog? I have no idea. Just sad to hear, very sad to hear,” said neighbor Kevin Gause.</p>
      <p>One neighbor on Millers Pond Circle, who didn’t want to be identified, told WMC a chilling story of finding Smith looking over their fence late one night, staring at their dog.</p>
      <p>“I asked her, 'Hey, what are you doing?' She said, 'Oh, your dog is cold. Your dog is cold.' That's the only thing she'd say,” one neighbor said.</p>
      <p>The neighbors said Lucy’s owners are good people. One person even said they were helping to take care of their granddaughter, who was having problems.</p>
      <p>“They're good neighbors. They came over, helped me out with my yard. I help them. So they're very friendly neighbors,” said Gause.</p>
      <p>According to a police affidavit, Smith admitted to one of the dog's owners that she killed the dog. And they received pictures of the dead animal from Smith's mother.</p>
      <p>Smith is charged with intentionally killing an animal, a felony.</p>
      <p>Neighbors say their thoughts are with the dog's owners.</p>
      <p>Smith is currently out on bond. She is due in court on Monday.</p>
