      <p>Senator Dino Melaye has challenged the ruling All Progressives Congress (ACP) to sue him if it has evidence of him buying votes during the November 16 Kogi West senatorial election.</p>
      <p>Concise News understands that the APC had alleged the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the election was caught on camera sharing money to some voters while on queue to cast their ballot in the election.</p>
      <p>Melaye was also reacting the allegations by Mohammed Onogwu, the Chief Press Secretary (CPS) to Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State, that he engaged in vote-buying, saying the APC has some video evidence to back the claim.</p>
      <p>Onogwu said on Channels Television on Sunday that: “We have clips evidence where he (Melaye) was distributing money (voters) on the line where they were voting.”</p>
      <p>While the governor’s aide was speaking, Senator Melaye interrupted in laughter and said, “What are you waiting for? Sue me.”</p>
      <p>Also, Senator Melaye accused the APC of being responsible for the violence which he said claimed 16 lives, alleging that a helicopter was deployed to attack voters.</p>
      <p>He insisted that his party has evidence to prove their allegation against the APC and faulted the election, stressing that results were not cancelled in places where violence was recorded.</p>
      <p>In his reaction, Onogwu said the allegation linking governor Bello to the violence in Lokoja during the elections was far from the truth.</p>
      <p>According to him, the governor was at Agasa in Okene LGA with his convoy where he cast his vote and ensured that the exercise was peaceful and could not have been in Lokoja at the same time.</p>
      <p>“The governor was not in Lokoja on the day of the election and he does not have a dual existence. He cannot be in Okene and at the same time be in Lokoja.</p>
      <p>“These are fallacious statements that they are making to discredit the entire electoral processes, to discredit the entire institutions that were involved in the conduct of the election,” Onogwu said.</p>
