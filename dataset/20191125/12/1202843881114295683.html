      <p>Doha: Qatar Petroleum has announced that it will raise Qatar’s LNG production capacity to 126 million tons per annum (mtpa) by 2027, representing an increase of 64% from the current 77 mtpa.</p>
      <p>The announcement was made by H E Saad Sherida Al Kaabi, Minister of State for Energy Affairs, President and CEO of Qatar Petroleum, at a press conference held in Doha today, during which he also announced that new studies have revealed that the North Field’s productive layers extend well into Qatari land in Ras Laffan, paving the way for a new LNG production project in the north of Qatar.</p>
      <p>Speaking at the press conference, the Minister said: “During the past two years, Qatar Petroleum worked diligently to determine the degree to which the North Field extends towards the south west, as well as the possibility of production from Qatar’s northern coastal onshore areas.”</p>
      <p>“I am pleased to announce that our appraisal efforts have borne fruit, and that we have confirmation that the productive layers of the North Field extend well into Qatari land in Ras Laffan. Studies and well tests have also confirmed the ability to produce large quantities of gas from this new sector of the North Field,” Minister Al Kaabi added.</p>
      <p>It is worth mentioning that the latest North Field appraisal well (NF-12) was drilled onshore in the Ras Laffan Industrial City, about 12 kilometers from shore and underwent extensive testing over the past few months.</p>
      <p>During the press conference, Al Kaabi also announced that the confirmed gas reserves of the North Field exceed 1760 trillion cubic feet, in addition to more than 70 billion barrels of condensates, and massive quantities of LPG, ethane, and helium. </p>
      <p>Minister said: “These are very important findings, which will have a great positive impact on Qatar’s gas industry, and which will move it forward into bigger and wider horizons. These results will also enable us to immediately commence the necessary engineering work for two additional LNG mega trains with a combined annual capacity of 16 million tons per annum. This will raise Qatar’s LNG production from currently 77 million tons to 126 million tons per annum by 2027, representing an increase of about 64%. It will also raise Qatar’s overall hydrocarbon production to about 6.7 million barrels oil equivalent per day.”</p>
