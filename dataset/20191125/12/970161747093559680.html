        <b>Andrea Bocelli put on an emotional performance on <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/strictly-come-dancing/">Strictly Come Dancing</a> only to have it ruined by the audience’s clapping.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The singer performed a solo rendition of his timeless classic Time to Say Goodbye, which had the professionals dance along to it, but viewers were complaining that they couldn’t hear anything due to the incessant cheering.</p>
      <p>Fans took to Twitter to complain about the distracting performance.</p>
      <p>One user said: ‘Sorry was he on?? Must have blinked and missed it. Either that or I couldn’t hear him for all the clapping and screeching from the ignorant audience!!’</p>

      <p>‘Extremely disrespectful to Andrea Bocelli and all singers to have the stupid screeching and cheering during their performance,’ another tweeted.</p>
      <p>Kevin Clifton and Janette Manrara were centre stage alongside their fellow dancers, but the audience just couldn’t keep their excitement to quieter levels.</p>
      <p>One viewer commented: ‘Wonderful voice shame it was ruined by idiots in the audience whooping and screeching every time a dancer was lifted an inch off the ground.’</p>

      <p>The social media influencer and her partner AJ Pritchard were voted off the BBC competition show unanimously after performing their Samba for judges Shirley Ballas, Bruno Tonioli, Craig Revel Horwood and Motse Mabuse one last time.</p>
      <p>The panel all decided they preferred Karim and his partner Amy Dowden’s contemporary routine and saved the children’s presenter from going home.</p>
      <p>Upon leaving the show, Saffron reflected: ‘I’ve had the absolute time of my life and it’s all down to him [AJ]. It’s been amazing.</p>
      <p>‘I’d like to thank AJ so much, when I look at what I was like on week one I was so embarrassed and shy.’</p>
