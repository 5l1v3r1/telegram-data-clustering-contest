      <p>News of Uber’s licence being scrapped in the capital has left many hungry Londoners worrying about the future of their takeaways.</p>
      <p>Transport for London announced on Monday that it has <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/25/uber-banned-london-midnight-losing-licence-battle-11213996/">not renewed the taxi app company’s licence</a> to operate in London, citing concerns over security breaches.</p>
      <p>It found that Uber allowed unauthorised drivers to pick up passengers <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/25/tfl-found-14000-uber-trips-driver-wasnt-registered-car-drove-11214268/">in at least 14,000 trips,</a> after drivers uploaded photos of themselves to the app linked to cars which they were not registered to drive.</p>
      <p>This meant that passengers were being picked up by drivers not named or authorised by the company, putting them at risk.</p>
      <p>Following the news, many took to Twitter questioning whether the move would affect UberEats, the app’s food delivery service.</p>

      <p>In fact, many seemed more concerned over their Friday night Chinese than the taxi service and expressed their concerns with broken heart and crying emojis.</p>

      <p>One wrote: ‘This better not affect Uber eats’, while another added: ‘Wait so if Uber in London goes is UberEats going too’.</p>
      <p>But Londoners needn’t worry as Uber confirmed to Metro.co.uk that UberEats will not be affected by TfL’s ban.</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman said the delivery service is not affiliated whatsoever with TfL, as the food is whizzed around the capital in heated bags on bikes.</p>
      <p>The concerns came after TfL scrapped the licence over the security risk, saying it ‘does not have confidence that similar issues will not reoccur in the future, which has led it to conclude that the company is not fit and proper at this time’.</p>
      <p>TfL said: ‘A key issue identified was that a change to Uber’s systems allowed unauthorised drivers to upload their photos to other Uber driver accounts.</p>

      <p>‘This allowed them to pick up passengers as though they were the booked driver, which occurred in at least 14,000 trips – putting passenger safety and security at risk.</p>
      <p>‘This means all the journeys were uninsured and some passenger journeys took place with unlicensed drivers, one of which had previously had their licence revoked by TfL.’</p>
      <p>Another failure allowed dismissed or suspended drivers to create an Uber account and carry passengers, again compromising passenger safety and security, TfL. The ride-hailing app firm’s existing licence expires at 11.59pm tonight.</p>

      <p>But Uber has insisted <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/25/uber-vows-fight-tfl-licence-scrapped-london-11214418/">it will appeal the decision</a>, adding that it had made several changes in recent years, making safety one of its main priorities.</p>
      <p>Uber’s regional general manager for northern and eastern Europe, Jamie Heywood, said it would be business as usual during the appeal process.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘TfL’s decision not to renew Uber’s licence in London is extraordinary and wrong, and we will appeal.</p>
      <p>‘We have fundamentally changed our business over the last two years and are setting the standard on safety. TfL found us to be a fit and proper operator just two months ago, and we continue to go above and beyond.</p>
      <p>‘On behalf of the 3.5 million riders and 45,000 licensed drivers who depend on Uber in London, we will continue to operate as normal and will do everything we can to work with TfL to resolve this situation.’</p>
