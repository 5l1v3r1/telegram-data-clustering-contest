      <p>MUMBAI: The <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Shiv-Sena">Shiv Sena</a>, the <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/NCP">NCP</a> and the Congress will "parade" 162 MLAs in a five-star hotel in Mumbai on Monday evening as a proof of their combined strength in the 288-member Assembly, senior Sena leader <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Sanjay-Raut">Sanjay Raut</a> said.</p>
      <p>Announcing the move on his tweeter handle, Raut appealed to state Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari to witness the "parading" of the legislators of the three parties.</p>
      <p>"We are all one and together, watch our 162 together for the first time at grand Hyatt at 7 pm, come and watch yourself @maha_governor.</p>
      <p>He tagged the official twitter handle @maha_governor of the Governor.</p>
      <p>"The idea is to turn the public perception towards us. Once we parade 162 MLAs in one hall, entire nation will come to know that BJP is playing a dirty game in <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Maharashtra">Maharashtra</a> by misusing office of the governor," said an NCP leader.</p>
      <p>The MLAs of the Sena, the NCP and the Congress are currently staying at different hotels in Mumbai.</p>
