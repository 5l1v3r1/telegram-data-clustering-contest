      <h1>Top-ranking US Navy official quits, blasting Trump on his way out</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T12:31:49+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 12:31</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/author/newdaily/" target="_blank">The New Daily</a></address>
      <p>The head of the US navy has resigned – via an extraordinary letter blasting President Donald Trump for giving him an order in a disciplinary case that he said violated his oath to defend the US Constitution.</p>
      <p>Navy secretary Richard Spencer had been asked to quit <a href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/world/2019/11/24/us-navy-chief-defies-commander-in-tweet-order-to-lay-off-disgraced-navy-seal/">after a dispute about whether an officer should be dismissed from the elite Seal unit</a> for posing with the corpse of a teenage fighter in Iraq.</p>
      <p>In a letter released on Monday (Australian time), Mr Spencer, 65, made it clear he was leaving because he thought <a href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/world/2019/05/19/donald-trump-mulls-pardons-for-convicted-us-war-criminals/">Mr Trump’s actions in the case of Special Operations Chief Edward Gallagher</a> were contrary to “good order” in the ranks.</p>
      <p>“Unfortunately it has become apparent that … I no longer share the same understanding with the Commander in Chief (Mr Trump), who appointed me, in regards to the key principle of good order and discipline,” Mr Spencer wrote.</p>
      <p>“I cannot in good conscience obey an order that I believe violates the sacred oath I took in the presence of my family, my flag and my faith to support and defend the Constitution of the United States.</p>

      <p><a href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/world/2019/11/21/us-navy-seal-commando/">The Gallagher case has drawn much public attention in the US</a> because Mr Trump has intervened several times to back the naval officer.</p>
      <p>The President had publicly opposed taking away Mr Gallagher’s Trident pin (which designates him as a Navy SEAL), and earlier used his authority to restore the decorated officer’s rank and pay and allow him to retire later this year on a full pension.</p>
      <p>Mr Spencer, who was the navy’s highest-ranking civilian, made headlines last week for suggesting a possible split with Mr Trump by saying Mr Gallagher should face a peer review board.</p>
      <p>Over the weekend, US Defence Secretary Mark Esper requested Mr Spencer’s resignation, saying he had lost confidence in the navy secretary.</p>
      <p>Mr Esper also determined that Mr Gallagher should be allowed to retain his Trident pin – in effect ending the navy’s efforts to carry out a peer review that could have led to his ouster from the elite force.</p>

      <p>But Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman said Mr Spencer also had a private line of communications with the White House.</p>
      <p>“Secretary Spencer had previously and privately proposed to the White House – contrary to Spencer’s public position – to restore Gallagher’s rank and allow him to retire with his Trident pin,” Mr Hoffman said.</p>
      <p>Mr Spencer never informed Mr Esper of his private proposal, Mr Hoffman said.</p>

      <p>Mr Gallagher, 40, was demoted in rank and pay grade after being convicted by a military jury in July of illegally posing for pictures with the corpse of an Islamic State fighter.</p>
      <p>On November 15, the White House said in a statement that Mr Trump had restored Mr Gallagher’s rank and had pardoned two army officers accused of war crimes in Afghanistan.</p>
      <p>Critics had said such actions would undermine military justice and send a message that battlefield atrocities will be tolerated.</p>
      <p>In an appearance on Fox News Channel on Sunday, Mr Gallagher indicated that he hoped to retire next Saturday, “without the board” convening to decide whether he could continue to be a Seal, considered among the most elite of US fighting forces.</p>
      <p>Mr Spencer will be replaced as navy secretary by Kenneth Braithwaite, who is currently the US ambassador to Norway.</p>
