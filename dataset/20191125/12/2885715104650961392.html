      <p>The number of students who received pre-placement offers has increased, from 135 to 158. (Representational Image)Students of Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Madras have received more pre-placement offers (PPO) than previous years. While last year, the number of students who received PPOs was 135, it has increased to 158 this year. Along with the PPOs, the number of offers made as well as the number of students placed has also increased in this year’s placement season at the institute.  However, there has been a decline in the number of companies registering to hire at the IIT.</p>
      <p>Most offers in the PPOs were made from core and research and development sector with a total of 41 per cent students getting offers in the area. This was followed by analytics, consulting, and finance sector from were 25 per cent of the total offers were made. A similar trend in hiring is expected to be seen in the placement season.</p>

      <p>Prof. Ravi Kumar, advisor (internships), IIT-Madras, highlighted that the rise in PPOs is the result of internships. “Since the creation of the internship cell in 2014 the number of PPOs has continuously increased. It is obvious that internship provides an opportunity for both the employers and the students to know each, understand the requirements and if companies do feel good about the students who worked as interns, they are likely to be offered PPOs the following year,” he said.</p>
      <p>He further added, “From this year, we have extended the services of the internship cell to MTech students as well and the process has been formalised. The entire internship team did a wonderful job in achieving this.”</p>
