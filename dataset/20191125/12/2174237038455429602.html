      <p>Former Fairport Convention singer Judy Dyble has confirmed she is suffering from lung cancer. She made the announcement in a post on her Facebook page on Friday.</p>
      <p>In a short statement she said: "The mindless thing in my lung is malignant and is spreading it's tendrils far and wide. So yes, I have lung cancer, and I start chemotherapy next week, like millions of other people all over the world. </p>
      <p>"I don't know how I will be affected or what will happen, but at the moment I won't be doing any of that live singing stuff. Please don't message me at the moment if I don't physically know you in real life, as I haven't got enough brainpower to answer.</p>
      <p>She goes on to say, "Yes I am sick, but I am in the hands of experienced doctors and specialists, and I have read up a lot about my condition. Please do not offer me advice, because every person I meet gives me detailed advice irrespective of whether I need it or not. And mostly the advice conflicts so please, I get tired just trying to keep up. </p>
      <p>"Please resist the urge to advise me. Often a hug is about all I can cope with - Thank you."</p>
      <p>Dyble, who released the acclaimed <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/news/judy-dyble-returns-with-new-album-and-single"><i>Earth Is Sleeping</i></a> in 2018, has been working on a new album with <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/big-big-train-six-things-you-need-to-know">Big Big Train</a> frontman David Longdon, which is due for release in Spring/Summer 2020.</p>
      <p>Dyble told <i>Prog</i> that if news of her condition helps one person into thinking about stopping smoking, she will be delighted.</p>
      <p><i>Prog</i> sends Judy our very best wishes with her treatment and recovery.</p>
