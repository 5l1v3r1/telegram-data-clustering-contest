      <p>Last Friday saw the Black Friday sales kick off in the United Kingdom and its had a knock on effect on the UK video game charts. This week has seen eight Nintendo Switch titles in the top ten with six of those being exclusive to the platform (Minecraft is the Switch version). It’s clearly been a great week for both Switch software and Nintendo Switch family sales with consumers rushing to get their hands on the console at a discount and pick up some some quality video games. Here’s the UKIE/GfK Top Ten for the week ending 23rd November:</p>
      <blockquote>It was a very strong week for Nintendo Switch. Following a series of pre-Black Friday deals across retail, Switch hardware received a significant boost and so did its software. Luigi’s Mansion 3 is still at No.6 after an 11% rise in sales, Mario Kart 8: Deluxe is back at No.7 with a 26% rise in sales, Minecraft on Switch is at No.8 with a 43% sales boost, while Mario &amp; Sonic At The Tokyo Games its at No.8 after a 4% sales uptick (the game has been out three weeks, and has seen sales increase each and every week so far, a rare feat for any game in the boxed charts).<br/><br/>That’s six Switch exclusives in the Top Ten, with a further eight throughout the rest of the Top 40. Super Mario Party (No.37), The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (No.32), New Super Mario Bros U Deluxe (No.30), Super Mario Odyssey (No.29) Super Smash Bros Ultimate (No.27), Super Mario Maker (N0.20) and Ring Fit Adventure (No.15) all rose in sales week-on-week, too.</blockquote>
