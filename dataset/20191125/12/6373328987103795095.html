      <p>So, who’s excited to hear about some more weird and wonderfully awkward sexual encounters?! I know I am.</p>
      <p>The second season of the British teen comedy-drama series started filming earlier this year, and <a href="https://www.unilad.co.uk/tag/netflix">Netflix</a> recently treated us to a <a href="https://www.unilad.co.uk/film-and-tv/netflix-has-released-first-look-images-for-sex-education-season-2/">first look</a> at the upcoming episodes, showing the show’s stars back in action.</p>

      <p>Season one saw socially awkward Otis Milburn (Asa Butterfield) and his friend Maeve Wiley (Emma Mackey) set up a sex-advice clinic for struggling and confused teens at school, in order to capitalise on Otis’ unusual talent for giving out sex advice – a skill he’s managed to develop despite being entirely inexperienced himself.</p>
      <p>The teen mimics his sex therapist mother Jean (Gillian Anderson), and manages to help his fellow students discover what they like in the bedroom, how to approach same-sex relationships and how to deal with the effects of three Viagra pills, among many, many other issues.</p>
      <p>After helping out everyone else in the first season, Otis will have put his own advice to practise in season two as he attempts to master his newly-discovered sexual urges in order to progress with his girlfriend, Ola (Patricia Allison).</p>

      <p>The pair better move cautiously however, as season two sees Moordale Secondary school get caught in the throes of a chlamydia outbreak, which really highlights the need for better <i>sex education</i> at the school…</p>
      <p>Advertisements</p>
      <p>No doubt Otis and Jean will have some personal and invasive heart-to-hearts about the importance of safe sex and protecting against STIs as a result of the epidemic – God knows Jean’s all about being open and honest with her ever-horrified son, after all.</p>
      <p><i>Sex Education</i> is set to return to Netflix in January with eight brand new episodes, in which we’ll also see Otis navigate his now-strained friendship with Maeve while dealing with new kids who come to town, who are set to cause havoc and challenge the status quo.</p>

      <p>While we’re yet to be blessed with a trailer for the new season, first look images show Otis and Eric exploring the woods, and Maeve and Aimee sitting opposite a police officer in the station, suggesting they’ve been getting up to no good.</p>

      <p>Elsewhere, resident bully Adam is in military school and ‘alien girl’ Lily appears to have formed a new friendship with Ola. The scenes are certainly intriguing and it will be great to finally get some context around them!</p>
      <p>Bring on the new year!</p>
