      <p><b>UPDATE 25/11</b>: If you're already a Game Pass Ultimate member, you can now get a <a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/bfl8">50% discount on the 3-Month pass</a> from Amazon as well.</p>
      <p>If you haven’t already tried Game Pass out, there’s never been a better time to <a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/be4w">sign up</a> with this early Black Friday offer.</p>
      <p><a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/microsoft-xbox-one-s-all-digital-edition/122852/microsoft-offers-spotify-premium-with-xbox-game-pass-ultimate">Xbox Game Pass</a> has been a shining beacon for Xbox and Microsoft since its <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/gallery/121460/5-reasons-to-subscribe-to-microsofts-xbox-game-pass-right-now">launch in 2016</a>. Since then Game Pass Ultimate has taken most of the limelight, offering access to both the Xbox and PC Game Pass catalogues alongside Xbox Live Gold.</p>

      <p><a href="http://r.zdbb.net/u/be4w">£10.99 per month</a> for the regular user isn't a bad price-point, but new customers can now subscribe to the service for only £1 for the first three months. This is an impressive Black Friday offer, and a great start to the Microsoft sale that kicks off on Nov. 22.</p>
      <p>On top of this, <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/microsoft-xbox-one-s-all-digital-edition/122852/microsoft-offers-spotify-premium-with-xbox-game-pass-ultimate">Ultimate</a> members can now enjoy one month of EA Access, three months of <a href="https://discordapp.com/discord-xbox-offer-2019">Discord Nitro</a>, and six months of <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/legal/Spotify-6m-Xbox-offer/">Spotify Premium</a>. Again, you will need to be a new member of these services to gain access to the subscriptions.</p>

      <p>It's also worth mentioning a great hack for Game Pass Ultimate, if you're already an Xbox Live Gold member. Microsoft quite happily informs you that the service will stack on top of your current <a href="http://xbox.com/gamepass">Live Gold membership</a> (up to 36 months).</p>
      <p>To take full advantage of this, prior to redeeming this offer, you could invest in a new <a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/be4x">12-month Gold membership</a>, and effectively get 15 months worth of Game Pass Ultimate, for a fraction of the normal price.</p>
