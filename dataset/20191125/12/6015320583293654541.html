      <p>According to a statement released by Kabul Municipality, the Security Firm had cut 24 trees along Airport Road late in August, without coordinating Kabul Municipality.</p>
      <p>The statement further added that the municipal authority recently followed up issue, forcing the security firm to transfer the sum of 5.76 million Afghanis to the account of Kabul Municipality.</p>
      <p>The statement also added that Kabul Municipality has prioritized equal implementation of law with an aim to prevent the repeat of such violations in the future.</p>
      <p>The Kabul Mayor Ahmad Zaki Sarfaraz called an emergency meeting late in August and fined the Security Firm 5.76 million Afghanis for cutting the trees alongside the Airport Road.</p>
      <p>The Kabul Municipality also stopped the operations of the firm and removed its containers from the area in reaction to the cutting of the trees which had also sparked furor among the residents of Kabul.</p>
