      <h1>Black Friday Deals – Get a PS4 Pro or Xbox One X bundle for £299.99</h1>

      <p>Black Friday sales and offers are well and truly underway, and today is seeing Sony and Microsoft slashing the RRP of their premium 4K capable consoles, the PlayStation 4 Pro and Xbox One X. Whichever platform you’re looking at, you’ll be able to pick one up for £299.99 with a game bundled in.</p>
      <p>That obviously means that Microsoft have cut their prices much harder than Sony. The PS4 Pro’s regular RRP is £349.99, while the more powerful Xbox One X regular price is £449.99.</p>
      <p>We’re still waiting to see just what Sony and Microsoft are going to do with the base model consoles, the PlayStation 4 Slim and Xbox One S – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/11/18/black-friday-ps4-psvr-playstation-deals/">US pricing has</a> <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/11/14/black-friday-xbox-one-deal-sale-discount/">already been confirmed</a> by both – but adverts for the Xbox One S All-Digital has pinned the disc-less console at a mere £129.99 for this Friday.</p>

      <p>You can also find the Xbox One X with PUBG, Metro Exodus, The Division 2 and more. For some reason, Argos have them at £304.99, but you’d probably want to save a fiver, unless you have some weird sense of loyalty to the company.</p>
      <p>If you already have a game console, chances are you’ll be looking to pick up some bargains on the games themselves? Luckily for you, everyone and their dog seems to have launched their digital store Black Friday sales.</p>
