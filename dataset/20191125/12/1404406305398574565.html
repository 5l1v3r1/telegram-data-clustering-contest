      <p>In this clip, DeHaven offered a candid response about what he'd say to JAY-Z if he reached out after not speaking for 20-years. DeHaven said he doesn't think that the opportunity to reconcile with Jay will actually present it, however. He also talked about why he feels slighted by Emory Jones, pointing out how Emory allowed a false narrative to persist.</p>
