      <p>The artwork, painted by artist Muriel Valentine, and a biography of his career will also be on permanent display in the players’ lounge at the National Football Centre at St George’s Park.</p>
      <p>The paintings, which portray the footballer at different stages of his illustrious career, were donated by Muriel to the Sir Stanley Matthews Coaching Foundation in 2018.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for the Foundation said: “It is fitting that the prints should be displayed at Wembley - the scene of perhaps the first footballing knight’s most memorable performance in the 1953 FA Cup final.</p>
      <p>“His performance in that showpiece has entered the sporting annals as the “Matthews Final” after Sir Stanley inspired his Blackpool side to a 4-3 victory over Bolton Wanderers after trailing 3-1 with just 22 minutes left.</p>
      <p>“Sir Stanley Matthews taught us how the game should be played, as Pele, another world superstar from a later era so famously said, vividly illustrating the universal esteem in which he was held.”</p>
      <p>Prints of the paintings are currently on sale to the general public, with all proceeds being donated to the Foundation by the artist.</p>
      <p>“They are quite remarkable in their attention to detail and portray the great man’s standing as the world’s first footballing icon,” the spokesperson for the Foundation went on to say.</p>
      <p>If you wish to purchase the Collection, contact mandy@sirstanleymatthews.co.uk</p>
      <p>The price is £150 for the set of four, including postage and packing for the UK mainland.</p>
      <p>Actual sizes of all the prints are 297x420mm and 250x200mm.</p>
