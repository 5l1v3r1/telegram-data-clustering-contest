      <p>An 82-year-old bodybuilder described the moment she ‘went to work’ on an intruder who broke into her home.</p>
      <p>Willie Murphy was getting ready for bed late on Thursday night when the man started banging at her door begging she call an ambulance.</p>
      <p>The man then forced his way inside when she refused to open up.</p>
      <p>But he ended up needing that ambulance for real when Willie smashed a table over him, beat him with a broom and squirted shampoo in his face.</p>

      <p>She later told <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/female-bodybuilder-82-fights-suspect-picked-wrong-house">Fox News</a> : ‘I went to work on him. The table broke.</p>
      <p>‘And when he’s down. I’m jumping on him. I grabbed the shampoo. Guess what? He’s still on the ground. In his face, all of it, the whole thing.’</p>

      <p>Willie said of the incident: ‘I’m alone and I’m old, but guess what? I’m tough.’</p>
      <p>She was already something of a local celebrity due to her impressive one-handed pull-ups, fingertip push-ups and running sprint races against young children, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7720807/Bodybuilder-82-says-man-29-broke-wrong-house-describes-smashing-TABLE-him.html">MailOnline</a> reported.</p>
      <p>Willie also described how some of the emergency services dispatched to the scene asked for selfies before she later received a hero’s welcome on her return to the Maplewood YMCA.</p>
      <p>‘He picked the wrong house to break into,’ Willie said.</p>
