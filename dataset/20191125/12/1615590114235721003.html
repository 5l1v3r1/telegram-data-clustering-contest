      <h1>Hearthstone streamer Jeremy 'DisguisedToast' Wang signs Facebook exclusivity deal</h1>
      <h2>Wang follows in the footsteps of several other top streamers departing Twitch in recent months</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T12:49:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 12:49</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/?author=1808" target="_blank">Rebekah Valentine</a></address>
      <p>Yet another popular Twitch streamer is departing the service for an exclusivity deal on a rival platform, but this time the streamer in question isn't headed to either YouTube or Mixer -- he's off to Facebook Gaming.</p>
      <p>Hearthstone streamer Jeremy "DisguisedToast" Wang <a href="https://twitter.com/DisguisedToast/status/1197892496694472704?s=20">announced today</a> that he would be exclusively streaming on Facebook Gaming from now on, a move which he says will give him the opportunity to reach a more global audience.</p>
      <p>"One of my favorite things about streaming is that I get to engage with viewers from across the world," Wang said. "My move to Facebook Gaming will give me a larger platform to share my voice with a global audience and hear their perspectives on the gaming landscape."</p>
      <p>Several other streamers have recently made moves to other services, most notably <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2019-08-01-ninja-departs-twitch-for-mixer-exclusivity-deal">Ninja, who departed Twitch for Mixer in August.</a> YouTube Gaming has also snapped up some streamers, with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2019-11-05-100-thieves-jack-courage-dunlop-signs-youtube-exclusivity-deal">Jack "CouRageJD" Dunlop making the move earlier this month.</a></p>
      <p>Though several streamers announced their departures with highly produced videos, Wang donated his $20,000 production budget to a local children's hospital.</p>
      <p>"Facebook Gaming is in a good place right now," said CEO of <a href="https://streamelements.com/">StreamElements</a> Doron Nir on Wang's choice to move to Facebook Gaming. "Although they only have a sliver of the market, they have continued to grow, even in months like September when other platforms dropped in hours watched, and now have another prominent streamer to attract more viewers.</p>
      <p>"While it can take years to be a true competitor in the live streamer space, they have a solid foundation and are making significant talent acquisition moves beyond the US, such as in Asia and Latin America where a lot of their growth is happening."</p>
