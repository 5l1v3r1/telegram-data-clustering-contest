        <b>Kylian Mbappe does not need to leave Paris Saint-Germain to taste real success, according to team-mate Idrissa Gueye.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Idrissa Gueye says Kylian Mbappe knows he can win numerous trophies with Paris Saint-Germain as the forward reportedly considers a contract extension.</p>
      <p>French publication L’Equipe claims PSG have made fresh terms for Mbappe their number one priority.</p>
      <p>The World Cup winner is tied down until 2022 but has routinely been linked with Real Madrid and is said to be unconvinced about a new deal due to reservations over the club’s past performances in the Champions League.</p>
      <p>PSG have failed to advance past the last 16 since Mbappe arrived from Monaco.</p>
      <p>However, team-mate Gueye told Marca: “I think he knows what he has to do to help the club and he can win a lot of things at PSG.</p>
      <p>“He can help us a lot and his talent and the future ahead is impressive. He has a lot of room [to develop] because he is very young but he is already very strong and must continue along that path.</p>
      <p>“He can help us win matches, give passes, score goals and we will see if he brings us the Champions League too.</p>
      <p>“It’s not just him, we’re a team and if we get to the top it will be like a team, with everybody working on the pitch and also off it.”</p>

      <p>PSG have won four from four in Europe’s elite club competition this season and need only a point at Real Madrid on Tuesday to top Group A.</p>
      <p>Madrid are five points behind the French side following a 3-0 defeat in Paris and a home draw with Club Brugge in October.</p>
      <p>There is now scepticism over whether Zinedine Zidane can steer the team to another Champions League triumph in the absence of Cristiano Ronaldo.</p>
      <p>Gueye said: “No, they are able to win the Champions League without Cristiano.</p>
      <p>“Other great players always come to Madrid. They sign good players and there are many who have already won the Champions League.”</p>
      <p>The midfielder added: “Madrid is always Madrid, that is not going to change, even if they did not win the Champions League last season.</p>
      <p>“Madrid are a very big club, it always motivates us to play against these teams. We want the points at the Bernabeu.”</p>
