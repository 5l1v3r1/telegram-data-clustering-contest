        <b><a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/pierre-gasly">Pierre Gasly</a> proved his doubters wrong at the <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/grandsprix/Brazilian-grand-prix">Brazilian Grand Prix</a> as he finished second behind his former teammate <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/max-verstappen">Max Verstappen</a>. Despite his podium, Christian Horner still believes it was right to remove the Frenchman from all the public pressure.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Gasly was replaced by <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/alexander-albon">Alex Albon</a> at the summer break and the Thai driver has been confirmed by <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/red-bull-racing">Red Bull</a> to keep the seat heading into the 2020 season. Gasly will remain at <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/scuderia-toro-rosso">Toro Rosso</a> where he has put in a solid performance since his return. </p>
      <p>His podium at Interlagos was a statement of defiance and his emotion was clear in the celebrations after the race. Christian Horner has stood by the decision to move him down to Toro Rosso.</p>

      <p><i>"Obviously, we felt that with the pressure building on him, the public pressure, the media scrutiny, it was right to remove him from that and put him into the slightly less pressured environment of Toro Rosso,”</i> Horner said on the F1 website.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“And since that switch I think he has driven again exceptionally well.</i>
