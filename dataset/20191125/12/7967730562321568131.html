      <h1>Reserve Bank tipped to steer clear of unconventional policy</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T12:57:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 12:57</time> by <a rel="author">David Scutt</a></address>
      <p>Goldman Sachs believes a recovery in home prices and stronger mining investment will see the Reserve Bank of Australia hold off on introducing unconventional monetary policy measures next year. This puts the investment bank at odds with an increasing number of analysts, including those from <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p539j5.html">J.P. Morgan</a> and Nomura, who expect the bank will be forced down the quantitative easing (QE) path given its quickly running out of room to cut interest rates to support economic activity.</p>
      <p>The view comes ahead of a key speech from RBA governor Philip Lowe on Tuesday that will focus on the lessons the bank has learnt from the rollout of unconventional policy measures around the world in the decade since the global financial crisis.</p>

      <p>“We don’t expect the RBA to pursue quantitative easing and other unconventional measures in 2020,” Goldman Sachs' Australian economics team, led by Andrew Boak, told clients on Friday.</p>
      <p>“While it is a close call, we continue to lean towards the RBA reducing the cash rate to 0.5 per cent in the near-term before remaining on hold over the next few years, with the pick-up in growth and house prices easing pressure to deliver additional stimulus.”</p>
      <p>The investment bank is forecasting that Australian economic growth will accelerate to around 2.5 per cent next year, helping to push unemployment down to 5 per cent and prevent a further weakening in underlying inflationary pressures.</p>

      <p>However, with unemployment tipped to remain well above the 4.5 per cent level where the RBA believes wage and inflationary pressures will build, Goldman says this will ensure that speculation about unconventional policy measures from the RBA will remain firmly in place.</p>
      <p>“Spare capacity in the labour market and below-target inflation will likely keep speculation about the prospect for further easing alive and well, particularly if the global outlook deteriorates or if domestic fiscal settings are not loosened by the time of the federal budget in May 2020,” Goldman said.</p>
