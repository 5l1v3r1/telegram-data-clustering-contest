      <h1>Tank: Will Saskatoon council close the book on downtown library plan?</h1>

      <p>One of the biggest budget decisions facing city hall is whether to approve borrowing for a new downtown branch</p>

      <h3>In the spring of 2017, the Saskatchewan Party cut $4.8 million in funding from libraries throughout the province, only to reverse the decision when faced with protests.</h3>
      <p>That attempt to reduce funding established that people in this province love their libraries, even in an age when folks are increasingly turning to digital means to access information.</p>
      <p>So Saskatoon city council faces a potentially perilous decision on Monday, when it is expected to render a verdict on a plan to build a replacement for the aged and outdated Frances Morrison Central Library downtown.</p>
      <p>There seems little question of the need for a new library, but the size and the cost have come under considerable scrutiny.</p>
      <p>Coun. Troy Davies says he plans to seek a vote on asking the library board to come back with a smaller, less expensive plan. The library board is proposing a 149,000-square-foot facility with a price tag of $154 million.</p>
      <p>The library board has saved enough money to buy land, and has come up with a short list of sites. Now it needs council to approve $87.5 million in borrowing, which will be considered as part of the city’s debt.</p>
      <p>The Saskatoon Public Library wants to complete the proposed new building in seven years, but it’s unclear how that timeline would be affected if council tells the library leadership to go back to the drawing board.</p>
      <p>So a lot hangs in the balance, with councillors and the mayor facing an election next year.</p>
      <p>Davies has questioned the need for such a large building and the accompanying cost. He’s wondered about seeing a building design before approval. The library leadership has expressed a desire to involve residents in the design of the building.</p>
      <p>That’s probably a good idea, given the reaction to an $84.5-million renovation of Edmonton’s downtown library, which has been ridiculed as resembling a battleship or a tank. (Hey, what’s wrong with a Tank?)</p>
      <p>Davies and others point to the Halifax Central Library, a five-floor, 120,000-sq.-ft. facility that opened in 2014 and cost $57.6 million.</p>
      <p>Halifax has a larger population than Saskatoon, so why would we need a bigger, more expensive library? Library leaders in Saskatoon say the new facility is intended to serve the future needs of a growing population.</p>
      <p>Even when you remove the $24-million contingency, the proposed cost of the library is still more than the $122 million spent on Saskatoon’s new police headquarters, which opened in 2014. The new police station covers 360,000 sq. ft., including its parking garage.</p>
      <p>The Remai Modern art gallery cost more than $100 million, but that includes the parkade underneath the building. The gallery, by the way, did not get approval until federal, provincial and private funding sources were secured to add to the city’s portion.</p>
      <p>The Halifax library was built with $18.3 million in federal funding. Conversely, Calgary’s heralded $245-million central library, which opened last year, was paid for entirely by the city.</p>
      <p>Saskatoon’s new library does not appear to be dependent on any funding sources other than taxpayers and donations.</p>
      <p>Regardless of how much you love books, reading and libraries, there are some legitimate questions about the size and cost of the project.</p>
      <p>Then there’s the question of where it should rank among civic projects.</p>
      <p>The city is also exploring the possibility of a new downtown arena and a new downtown convention centre, and where to put them.</p>
      <p>The TCU Place leadership has written to council asking for “special consideration” at budget talks for a new downtown convention centre because of the economic implications for the city.</p>
      <p>Could city hall possibly build a library, convention centre and arena all downtown at the same time, without breaking the bank or exceeding its debt limit?</p>
      <p>Just over a half-century ago, the city opened the Frances Morrison (1966), the Mendel Art Gallery (1964) and Centennial Auditorium (1968), now known as TCU Place.</p>
      <p>Back then, the Mendel cost $650,000 and only became a reality when it was combined with a conservatory.</p>
      <p>Perhaps some similar innovative thinking will be needed as Saskatoon looks to replace some of its obsolete facilities.</p>
