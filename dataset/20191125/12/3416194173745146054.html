      <p>It looks like <a href="http://www.justjaredjr.com/tags/jesy-nelson/"><b>Jesy Nelson</b></a> and <a href="http://www.justjaredjr.com/tags/chris-hughes/"><b>Chris Hughes</b></a> are in it for the long haul.</p>
      <p>The <a href="http://www.justjaredjr.com/tags/little-mix/"><b>Little Mix</b></a> singer and <b>Chris</b> both shared sweet notes on social media this weekend, referring to each other as their “future” husband and wife.</p>
      <p>“Night everyone feeling very blessed for everything I have in life! Friends, family my future wife👸🏻,” Chris first tweeted, with a cute superwoman emoji referencing Jesy. “Remember you only get one life so live it to the fullest and be the BEST version of YOU!!! I’ve tried to learn something new everyday and today I learned how to tap dance 🕺”</p>
      <p>One fan asked <b>Chris </b>if the two were getting engaged after his note. “No. Just happy,” he <a href="https://twitter.com/chrishughes_22/status/1198747283740921856">replied</a> to them.</p>
      <p>Later on, <b>Jesy </b>headed to Instagram to share a similar note.</p>
      <p>“Feeling so blessed right now. Couldn’t be happier; cuddles with Reggie and Oscar and my future husband makes me so happy,” she wrote. “Keep being kind, because it pays off, and costs nothing. Love you all.”</p>
      <p>So sweet!</p>
