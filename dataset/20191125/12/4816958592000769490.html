      <p>THE HAGUE — Belgian prosecutors have knocked out several internet servers used by Islamic State, shutting a large number of accounts and websites run by its news arm, in an operation led by Europe’s police agency, the Belga press agency reported on Monday.</p>
      <p>Europol, the European policy agency, said it would release details of the initiative at a news conference later on Monday.</p>
      <p>“We were able to shut down a large number of accounts and a series of websites,” Belga quoted prosecution spokesman Eric Van Der Sypt as saying.</p>
      <p>Europol said in a statement it has been working with nine of the largest Internet platforms to counter Islamic State propaganda operations, including with Google, Twitter, Instagram and Telegram.</p>
      <p>Europol said on its website it had examined “propaganda videos, publications and social media accounts supporting terrorism and violent extremism” over the course of two days last week.</p>
      <p>“Telegram was the online service provider” where most offending material was found, Europol said.</p>
      <p>“As a result, a significant portion of key actors within the IS network on Telegram was pushed away from the platform.”</p>
      <p>It praised Telegram’s assistance and said the company was helping Europol to “root out … malicious content.” (Reporting by Toby Sterling, Editing by William Maclean)</p>
