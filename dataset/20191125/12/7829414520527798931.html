      <p>Amazon on Monday said it will open a store on China's e-commerce platform Pinduoduo, after the US firm closed its own Chinese domestic marketplace in July.<br/><br/>The store will run until the end of December and carry a selection of roughly 1,000 overseas products from markets such as the US, the UK, Japan and Germany.<br/><br/>"Amazon's commitment to China remains strong and we will continue to invest and grow the Amazon Global Store business in China," the firm told the Global Times on Monday.<br/><br/>The July closure of Amazon's Chinese marketplace was due to operational adjustments intended to focus the company's efforts on cross-border sales in China, according to the firm.<br/><br/><br/><b>RELATED ARTICLES:</b></p>
