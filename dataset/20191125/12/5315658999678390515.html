      <p>NZ First Welcomes Commitment to Improving Winter Animal Welfare</p>
      <p>New Zealand First supports the changes recommended by the Winter Grazing Taskforce to improve animal welfare outcomes through the winter months, and the establishment of a pan-sector action group to implement them.</p>
      <p>New Zealand First Primary Industries Spokesperson Mark Patterson says the report highlights areas of concern about the animal welfare impacts of intensive winter grazing practices, and outlines a forward-thinking approach to help farmers lift standards.</p>
      <p>“The report highlights a degree of non-compliance that we cannot afford to have associated with our pastoral sector.</p>
      <p>“Our animal welfare credentials are an essential part of our export brand. Our reputation, and by extension our livelihoods, depend on it.</p>
      <p>“But lifting animal welfare outcomes is not solely the responsibility of farmers. The report makes it clear this responsibility is shared across the pastoral farming supply chain.</p>
      <p>“The Coalition Government is also committed to giving farmers the right tools and advice to ensure better animal welfare.</p>
      <p>“As is usual, our best farmers are well ahead of these discussions and have winter grazing practices that would withstand any scrutiny.</p>
      <p>“New Zealand First fully supports the proactive approach the Minister of Agriculture is taking, working alongside farmers to uphold our international reputation,” says Mr Patterson.</p>
