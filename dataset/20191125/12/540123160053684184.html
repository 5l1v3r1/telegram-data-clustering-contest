      <h1>Iran Threatens ‘Crushing Blow’ to U.S, Israel for ‘Interference’ in Uprisings, Threatens ‘Crushing Blow’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T12:46:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 12:46</time> by <a rel="author">JNS</a></address>
      <blockquote>Men of Persia, Lud, and Put Were in your army, Your fighting men; They hung shields and helmets in your midst, They lent splendor to you<cite><a href="http://theisraelbible.com/bible/ezekiel/chapter-27/#verse-10">Ezekiel 27:10 (The Israel Bible™)</a></cite></blockquote>
      <p>Iranian Vice President Eshaq Jahangiri warned regional countries on Saturday that if it could be proved that they had stoked recent protests in the country, then consequences would ensue.</p>
      <p>“Some countries of the region must know that if clues are found that they have been involved in provoking riots inside Iran, then their goose is cooked … because Iran is not a country to be joked with in this way or to tolerate such behaviors,” said Jahangiri, according to Iran’s Fars News Agency.</p>
      <p>Countries in the region must “behave with the utmost respect towards Iran,” said Jahangiri, and “will receive a crushing blow if it is found that foreigners have intervened in the domestic affairs of Iran and have inflicted costs and damages on the Iranian nation.”</p>
      <p>Earlier on Saturday, Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps spokesman Brig. Gen. Ramezan Sharif accused the United States, Israel and the Gulf states of playing a role in the demonstrations.</p>
      <p>“Even Saudis and some Emiratis, as well as some intelligence services, contributed to these events to stoke insecurity inside the country,” said Sharif, according to Fars.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, on Saturday, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said that Iran had requested an additional $2 billion loan from Russia for projects such as the construction of thermal power plants, hydroelectric power plants, railroads, and subway carriages, according to a Reuters report.</p>
      <p>“They’re asking for about $2 billion. … They say they were promised $5 billion in 2015. … We had loans allocated to them, they ask us to bring the total amount up to $5 billion,” said Novak.</p>
      <p>Thousands have taken to the streets in cities across Iran in recent days to protest the ruling elite’s economic policies.</p>
      <p>While the protests have been blamed on the government’s recent decision to raise the price of petrol by 50 percent, analysts contend that they are likely also a manifestation of widespread and growing public discontent with their government diverting much-needed funds to support international terrorism.</p>
