      <h1>Ex-Livingston and Rangers keeper Liam Kelly battling injury setback at QPR</h1>
      <h2>Scotland squad member hopes to return in time for the festive fixtures.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T12:30:02+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 12:30</time> by <a rel="author">Fraser Wilson, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/fraser-wilson/</a></address>
      <p>Liam Kelly is facing another fortnight on the sidelines at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/queens-park-rangers-fc">QPR</a> after suffering a thigh tear in training.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old former <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/livingston-fc">Livingston</a> keeper had cemented his place in the Loftus Road first team with a string of impressive displays when he was struck down a day before the Championship draw with Middlesbrough.</p>
      <p>Kelly had been in contention for a return to the Scotland squad for the Euro 2020 qualifiers against Cyprus and Kazakhstan.</p>
      <p>But he now faces a fight to get back in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/mark-warburton">Mark Warburton</a> â€™s side with Joe Lumley having regained the number one spot.</p>
      <p>Kelly has made eight appearances for the London club since sealing a move from Livingston in the summer.</p>
      <p>QPR sit 12th in the Championship table with 24 points from 17 games, five points off the play-off spots.</p>
