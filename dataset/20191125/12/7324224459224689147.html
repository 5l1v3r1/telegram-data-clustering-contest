      <h1>West Brom boss Slaven Bilic hails Kyle Bartley’s form</h1>
      <h2>Slaven Bilic says he is pleased Kyle Bartley is being recognised for his performances – with the head coach believing that praise has been key to his impressive form.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T12:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 12:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.expressandstar.com/news/authors/joseph-masi/" target="_blank">Joseph Masi</a></address>
      <p>Bartley, who was snapped up from Swansea in August 2018, endured a difficult first season at The Hawthorns with the Baggies often playing a back three.</p>
      <p>But playing alongside Semi Ajayi, the 28-year-old has been outstanding in a back-four this year and captained Albion to their 2-1 win over Sheffield Wednesday on Saturday.</p>
      <p>And Bilic is pleased the defender is being recognised by both fans and the media for his commanding displays.</p>
      <p>"Again against Sheffield Wednesday, he (Bartley) was very good," Bilic said.</p>
      <p>"When I go into the town, when I read (the papers) I see that he is getting recognition.</p>
      <p>"Maybe he should get more or whatever – but he is (getting recognition).</p>
      <p>"And I think that is the reason behind his top performances.</p>
      <p>“He is feeling that he is important – not only from me and my staff, but from within the club and from in the stands and from the papers.</p>
      <p>“He is playing great, he is that kind of player.</p>
      <p>“He needs to stay focused, he needs to stay humble but he is also one of the reasons we are where we are."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Gareth Barry admitted he thoroughly enjoyed being back out on the pitch after coming off the bench in the win against The Owls.</p>
      <p>It was the first time the midfielder has played since undergoing knee surgery towards the end of last season.</p>
      <p>“It was a nice bit of light at the end of a long tunnel,” Barry said.</p>
      <p>"I am grateful that the longest injury I have had has come at the age I am.</p>
      <p>"For the work I have had to put in to get back, it was a nice feeling to get back on the pitch. Luckily to win the game as well - it was nice to be back in that dressing room after three points.</p>
      <p>"The first five or 10 minutes back on the pitch you can’t get your breath because nothing is like being out there in the real action but suddenly you find your feet again and you enjoy being back out there. I enjoyed it."</p>
