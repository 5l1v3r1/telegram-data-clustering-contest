      <p>COLOMBO, Nov 25 — A Sri Lankan detective investigating high-profile cases has fled the country after receiving death threats soon after the change of government, police and media reports said Monday.</p>
      <p>Inspector Nishantha Silva has sought asylum in Switzerland, according to media reports.</p>
      <p>He left the island yesterday without informing his Criminal Investigations Department superiors, a police statement said.</p>
      <p>“There are various allegations that this officer had been biased during his investigations in the past four and a half years,” the police statement said without giving details.</p>
      <p>The<i> Daily Mirror </i>newspaper said Silva left after receiving death threats after Gotabaya Rajapaksa won a presidential election on November 16.</p>
      <p>His investigations included high profile killings and corruption involving administration members under former president Mahinda Rajapaksa, brother of the new president, who ruled for a decade until 2015.</p>
      <p>Mahinda Rajapaksa has returned to power as prime minister after leading his younger brother’s successful election campaign. </p>
      <p>Police said there was no pending disciplinary action against Silva, but an inquiry will be initiated to find out how he left the country without permission.</p>
      <p>Silva was removed from his CID post last year after Mahinda Rajapaksa briefly served as prime minister. But he was restored after that administration collapsed.</p>
      <p>Among the cases he was investigating was the 2009 assassination of editor Lasantha Wickrematunge by an alleged hit squad. — AFP</p>
