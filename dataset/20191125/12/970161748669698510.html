      <p>With December approaching, we’re all asking ‘<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/01/early-put-christmas-tree-november-11026686/">When is the right time to put up the Christmas tree?</a>’</p>
      <p>But if you prefer a real tree over an artificial one, buying it too early might mean there aren’t any needles left by <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/christmas/">Christmas</a> Day.</p>
      <p>Most trees will last four to six weeks if cared for properly so with one month to go until the big day today, the next week should be fine.</p>
      <p>Advent starts on the fourth Sunday before Christmas, which happens to be 1 December this year and most people like to wait until then to decorate.</p>
      <p>It all depends on how long you want to leave it up for. Traditionally, Christmas trees stay up until the 12th night, which falls on 6 January, so if you want to stick to that, you should wait until this weekend or later to make sure it’s still standing by then.</p>

      <p>If you prefer to take yours down after New Year’s Day, buying one now or later this week, should be fine.</p>
      <h3>Choosing the perfect Christmas tree</h3>
      <p>If you pick a healthy tree, it’s more likely to last through all the festivities. There are some ways to tell how well a tree is doing:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Head to the shadiest part of the farm to avoid one that has been sitting in the sunlight.</li>
        <li>Look for one with lots of green, rather than brown needles.</li>
        <li>If you touch the branches, the needles should feel pliable and shouldn’t fall off the branches.</li>
        <li>If you lift the tree and drop the trunk to the ground, very few green needles should fall off.</li>
        <li>The type of tree might make a difference too. Non-drop trees such as the Nordmann Fir are likely to hold their look and shape for longer.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>How to make your Christmas tree last</h3>
      <p>But there are some important things you need to do to make sure your tree stays healthy right through the festive period.</p>
      <p>Sam Lyle, one of the people behind <a href="https://www.pinesandneedles.com/?gclid=CjwKCAiAlO7uBRANEiwA_vXQ-9H12Nsnb-zl3_FKHtCtQKEo7aPKRiHj54ZuL8Zp37nW1iRUUrofeRoCKqQQAvD_BwE&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=ppc&amp;utm_content=Pines+And+Needles&amp;utm_campaign=branded+-+search+-+exact+-+ROAS">Christmas tree specialists Pines and Needles</a>, said: ‘Thirty years ago most Britons bought their tree a couple of weeks before Christmas but now many people are putting them up in November, which means it’s more important than ever to keep your tree looking bushy and bright.</p>
      <p>‘The first thing you should do when you take your tree home is cut three inches off the bottom of the trunk – it will help the tree soak up water more efficiently.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘Secondly, your tree should drink as much as you do this Christmas! Houses are generally extra-warm over Christmas so feed your tree with two or three pints of water each day.</p>
      <p>‘Naturally, keep your tree away from radiators and wood-burners and the same goes for draughts….trees don’t like extremes.’</p>
