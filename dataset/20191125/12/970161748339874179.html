      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/fleabag/">Fleabag</a> star Sian Clifford wants her new ITV drama to ‘blow’ the Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? cheating scandal wide open.</p>
      <p>The infamous coughing scandal on the game show in 2001 saw Major <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2016/09/09/its-been-15-years-since-charles-ingram-cheated-his-way-to-victory-on-who-wants-to-be-a-millionaire-6119305/">Charles Ingram scam his way to winning £1million</a> with help from a friend who coughed from the audience to signal the right answer.</p>
      <p>ITV are turning the incident into the drama Quiz, with Sian playing Charles’ wife Diana, Matthew Macfadyen as and Michael Sheen as Millionaire host Chris Tarrant.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/celebrity-news/sian-clifford-who-wants-to-be-a-millionaire-quiz-charles-ingram-a4295476.html">Speaking about the show at the Evening Standard Theatre Awards</a>, the actress said: ‘I’ve seen all the episodes now, we’ve got a wait until it’s coming out here but [I’m] absolutely brimming with excitement to share that with the world.</p>
      <p>‘That story is, I hope, about to get blown wide open because it’s not what we think.’</p>

      <p>The 37-year-old added that it was ‘amazing’ to explore the scandal ‘look at it from the Ingrams’ perspective’.</p>
      <p>‘We’re really hoping to shed some light on it, with the show,’ she said.</p>

      <p>Recently Chris himself, who hosted the show for 15 years, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/15/chris-tarrant-reveals-fears-michael-sheen-playing-wants-millionaire-drama-11163465/">admitted he was worried about how Michael would play him.</a></p>
      <p>He told This Morning’s Eamonn and Ruth: ‘I met Michael Sheen at the Pride Of Britain Awards. Now this guy has been looking at tapes of me for weeks and weeks and suddenly this great big lump taps him on the shoulder and he turned around and went “Argh!”. It was really weird! ‘I’m thrilled that he’s doing it, he’s a brilliant actor. I just hope he’s not going to do the sort of Rory Bremner “Hello! Tea!” and all that stuff.</p>
      <p>‘I don’t think he will because he’s an actor and he’s very good. I just hope – because I saw the original theatre play in Chichester – I hope they don’t make a big deal out of “The Major might be innocent”.</p>
      <p>‘I have sat through so many hours with the police and the fraud squad watching tapes of the major’s show. He is so guilty!’</p>
