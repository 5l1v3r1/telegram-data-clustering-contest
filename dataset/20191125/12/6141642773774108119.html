      <p>Manchester City host Shakhtar Donetsk hoping to secure their place in the Champions League knockout stages on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Here, the PA news agency looks at what lies ahead in the Group C encounter.</p>
      <h3>Both sides can progress</h3>

      <p>Shakhtar, who are second in the group with five points and level with third-placed Dinamo, have produced stirring fightbacks in both their away matches in this season’s competition. Against Atalanta they came from behind to win 2-1 with Manor Solomon scoring the clincher five minutes into added time. They were in deeper trouble in Zagreb, trailing 3-1 after 90 minutes, but a Junior Moraes strike and Tete penalty in injury time saw them snatch a 3-3 draw.</p>

      <p>All of Shakhtar’s successes in the modern era have been based around a core of Brazilian players. Current City player Fernandinho rose to prominence there during an eight-year spell before joining City in 2013. Manchester United’s Fred, Chelsea’s Willian and Everton’s Bernard all played there earlier in their careers. Shakhtar’s current squad boasts 11 Brazilians, two of whom have now become Ukraine internationals in Marlos and Moraes. Moraes is a man City will need to watch having scored 14 goals in 14 league appearances this season, and two more from four in the Champions League. Marlos, however, is suspended for this one.</p>
