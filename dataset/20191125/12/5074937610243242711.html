      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T12:37:13+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 12:37</time> by <a rel="author">Dennis Peprah, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Koradaso, (B/R), Nov. 25, GNA – A-GH¢287,000.00 crop aggregation centre, built at Koradaso in the Dormaa Central Municipality, to give support to the government’s signature Planting for Food and Jobs (PFJ) programme, has been inaugurated at a ceremony.</p>
      <p>The 500 metric tonne facility, uses open and biomass dryers to reduce high moisture and high content of aflatoxins in maize.</p>
      <p>It was constructed by AMPLIFIES Ghana project - a United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Food for Progress funded project, which aims at increasing the efficiencies of the feed value chain, combining both local sources and international trade.</p>
      <p>The five-year Project is being implemented by a consortium - the Adventist Development and Relief Agency (ADRA), the American Soybean Association’s (ASA), World Initiative for Soy in Human Health (WISHH), and a group of Universities led by Kansas State University.</p>
      <p>The Reverend Dr. William Yaw Brown, the Country Director, ADRA, said the storage facility would significantly help to reduce post-harvest losses.</p>
      <p>It would go a long way to assist farmers to earn good returns from their production.</p>
      <p>Already, the farmers had been taught how to properly dry and store their maize.</p>
      <p>He said the successful implementation of the PFJ would be a game changer – create wealth, improve food security and impact the economy. As project had trained farmers in the area on how to properly dry and store maize.</p>
      <p>Ms. Ligaya Diaz, the Chief of Party, AMPLIFIES Project (ASA/WISHH), said she was confident that the facility would motivate farmers in the area to increase productivity so that it would not become a “white elephant”.</p>
      <p>She added that, through the PFJ, Ghana would have the capacity to grow maize to feed the people and cut down on food imports to boost the local economy.</p>
      <p>Mr. Iddrisa Watara, the Municipal Chief Executive, announced that the government was constructing a 1,000 metric tonne warehouse in the area.</p>
      <p>Additionally, 90,000 cashew seedlings and 126,000 coffee seedlings had been distributed to farmers under the Planting for Export and Rural Development (PERD) programme.</p>
      <p>Mr. Augustine Ntow, a farmer at Koradaso, thanked ADRA and the project partners for the facility.</p>
      <p>He appealed to the government to fix the Asenso Number One-Dwen-Koradaso and Dormaa-Ahenkro-Koradaso roads to make it easier for them to transport their farm produce to the marketing centres.</p>
      <p>He complained about the low price of maize, which he said, was affecting the farmers, and called for standardized price to motivate them to increase productivity.</p>
