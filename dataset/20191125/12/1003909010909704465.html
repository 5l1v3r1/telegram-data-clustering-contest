      <h1>Nelson: Freeland appointment sets stage for epic political showdown</h1>

      <p>The problem with this gender equality stuff our prime minister keeps yapping about is he once again has to staff half his latest cabinet with a bunch of men.</p>
      <p>That’s what happens when you dole out jobs because of quotas: you get stuck with folk who don’t really belong on merit but, quite literally, get picked to make up the numbers.</p>
      <p>Because, looking back to the last Liberal government, by far and away the three best performers in their respective cabinet portfolios were women.</p>
      <p>Yes, while our prime minister spent four years visiting private islands, dressing up in weird costumes, uttering a new language comprised of words such as peoplekind, apologizing to anyone with a pulse and a vote, there were actually a few female ministers who managed to get some substantial things done.</p>
      <p>The best of the lot would be Jane Philpott, who dealt with fiendishly controversial and difficult issues from legalizing marijuana, through doctor-assisted suicide to Indigenous child welfare, with as much grace and composure that could be wished, considering the explosive nature of that to-do list.</p>
      <p>Of course, that didn’t save her from later being booted from caucus when she defended a colleague and stood up for the rule of law. Hey, sheer competence is never a defence against small-minded politics.</p>
      <p>Next would be the very colleague Philpott backed, Jody Wilson-Raybould, who, in displaying both integrity and grit as justice minister in refusing to be intimidated by Trudeau and his party henchmen into coming up with a sweetheart deal for Montreal-based SNC-Lavalin amidst bribery allegations, showed that decency isn’t yet an entirely alien concept in federal politics.</p>
      <p>Finally, we come to Chrystia Freeland, the only one of the trio returning as part of the latest federal cabinet incarnation, revealed last Wednesday.</p>
      <p>As minister of international trade, she somehow managed to get those endlessly squabbling Europeans to agree to a trade deal with Canada and then followed that accomplishment when, as foreign minister, she went head to head with the U.S. administration in successfully crafting a renegotiated NAFTA agreement. Hey, when Donald Trump complains about your negotiating style and calls you a nasty woman then you’re doing OK representing Canada.</p>
      <p>So Freeland is promoted to deputy prime minister and minister of intergovernmental affairs, a role that might make butting heads with Trump’s crew seem a walk in the park, given the frosty relations between Ottawa and some provinces these days.</p>
      <p>Nowhere is that discordance louder than here in Alberta. Those in central Canada imagining the current Wexit movement is simply a bunch of short-term whining by aging rednecks, annoyed at the recent federal vote, are in for a rude shock. If this currently discordant anger coalesces behind a charismatic and capable leader, this country has a serious threat to its current composition.</p>
      <p>Yes, Freeland faces a huge challenge. But she begins with some residual goodwill and can at least boast of being born in Peace River, attending high school in Edmonton, being of Ukrainian stock and having a granddad who once rode in the Calgary Stampede. It might not get her too far once the real work begins, but it beats the heck out of some politician from Quebec being handed this vital federal ministry.</p>
      <p>Still, as we saw with Trudeau’s last government and the demolition of Wilson-Raybould, cabinet ministers are as easily disposed of as last night’s fancy dress costume to our Mr. Dressup prime minister.</p>
      <p>Real power belongs with the PMO and the Montreal/Ottawa elite. Competence, integrity and accomplishments mean squat if the political winds turn against a minister. Trudeau’s loyalty belongs only to that face in the mirror. Everything and everyone else is disposable.</p>
      <p>So Freeland, a devotee of classic Russian literature, might consider rereading War and Peace: because we’re about to engage in a political epic of similar proportions in this country. Sadly, I’ve a hunch that, unlike Pierre Bezukhov, it might not end so well for her when the final chapter’s written.</p>
