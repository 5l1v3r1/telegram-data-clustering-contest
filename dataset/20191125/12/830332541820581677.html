      <h1>Selena Gomez kicks off the American Music Awards</h1>
      <h2>Plenty of discussion on social media about vocals</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T12:01:39+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 12:01</time> by <a rel="author">Lisa Respers France, CNN</a></address>
      <p>LOS ANGELES (CNN) - Where to even begin? Sunday night was the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/style/article/ama-awards-2019-red-carpet/index.html">American Music Awards</a> and there was a lot going on.</p>
      <p>Here's some of what you may have missed (and the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/24/entertainment/amas-2019-winners-list/index.html">full winners list</a>, if you're interested):</p>
      <h3>Selena Gomez kicked off the show</h3>
      <p>Maybe she was a little nervous?</p>
      <p>The singer/actress opened the American Music Awards Sunday night, and she wasn't in the strongest of voices.</p>
      <p>Gomez performed "Lose You To Love Me" and "Look At Her Now."</p>
      <p>There was plenty of discussion on social media about her vocals.</p>
      <p>Regardless, if you loved Gomez before, you didn't come away loving her any less.</p>
      <h3>We almost forgot Ciara was hosting</h3>
      <p>Ciara hosted in such a way that we kind of wish other event hosts would take note.</p>
      <p>Early on, she reminded us that she is also an artist when she was joined by "Power" star La La for the single, "Melanin."</p>
      <p>But otherwise she just popped in here and there, making some intros and sometimes taking us to commercial.</p>
      <p>It was subtle and helped the night feel like it was going by pretty quickly.</p>
      <h3>Billie EIlish is the present and future of music</h3>
      <p>The 17-year-old won multiple awards, including new artist of the year and performed "All the Good Girls Go to Hell" -- surrounded by fire.</p>
      <p>She's literally one of the hottest artists around at the moment.</p>
      <p>She also adorably geeked out after introducing a performance by Green Day and what's not to love about that?</p>
      <p>The first award of the night went to Eilish for favorite artist, alternative rock.</p>
      <h3>Toni Braxton sang 'Unbreak My Heart'</h3>
      <p>Because why not? For no other reason, it reminded us that she has barely aged since that song was a hit in 1996.</p>
      <p>There were performances for just about everyone -- from Dua Lipa to The Jonas Brothers -- and Shania Twain, who did acoustic versions of Swift's "Shake It Off" and Drake's "God's Plan," before launching into her hit, "Still The One."</p>
      <h3>Camila Cabello pulled double duty</h3>
      <p>Not only did she heat up the stage with reported boyfriend Shawn Mendes for a steamy performance of "Se√±orita" that had Taylor Swift gaping from the audience, but Cabello later returned to slink through her single "Living Proof."</p>
      <h3>Is he or isn't he?</h3>
      <p>There has been lost of debate about whether Post Malone is a rapper or not.</p>
      <p>Some say he's more a pop singer. Malone <a href="https://youtu.be/FEyGwpFNTuw">said during an interview a few years ago that while he raps, he doesn't make rap music.</a></p>
      <p>Well, someone didn't tell the AMA voters that as Malone took home the favorite album -- Rap/Hip-Hop for "Hollywood's Bleeding."</p>
      <p>Speaking of defying genres, Malone also performed with rapper Travis Scott and "The Prince of Darkness" himself, Ozzy Osbourne</p>
      <h3>Taylor Swift is everything</h3>
      <p>You know you are a big deal when the legendary Carole King introduces you.</p>
      <p>Taylor Swift was honored as artist of the decade and her intro was a reminder of all she's recorded accomplished over the years.</p>
      <p>From battling for a fair cut of streaming royalties to how she writes her own hits, Swift was hailed for her influence in the industry.</p>
      <p>Her <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2019/11/18/entertainment/taylor-swift-amas-big-machine-label-group-trnd/index.html">fight to sing her past hits</a> during the show got a nod as she sang, "If I was a man I'd be THE man."</p>
      <p>Swift's performance felt triumphant, especially when fellow artists Halsey and Cabello joined her on stage for a rousing rendition of "Shake It Off."</p>
      <p>She was also joined during her performance by the famed ballerina Misty Copeland.</p>
      <p>There was an extra heart tug when the camera cut to a shot of Swift's mother, crying with pride in the audience.</p>
      <p>It felt right that Swift also took home the biggest trophy of the night, artist of the year. She also made history as the artist with most AMA wins with 26.</p>
      <h3>Those balloons</h3>
      <p>The audience started batting balloons around toward the end of the show. It was so distracting that Ciara asked folks to cut it out for a bit.</p>
      <p>Dan + Shay looked like they had to battle through them to collect the favorite song - country award for their hit, "Speechless."</p>
