      <p><a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/the-a-z-of-opeth">Opeth</a> have released an animated video for their song <i>Ingen Sanning Är Allas</i>.</p>
      <p>The Swedish language track appears on the band’s latest studio album <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/reviews/opeths-in-cauda-venenum-in-depth-rock-luxury-from-21st-century-prog-monarchs"><i>In Cauda Venenum</i></a> which launched back in September.</p>
      <p>The striking video was created by South African animator and artist Jess Cope and follows “a melancholic and bitter man on the brink of self-destruction and insanity as he delves into a sinister alternate world as reality crumbles around him.”</p>
      <p>Cope previously worked with Opeth vocalist and guitarist Mikael Akerfeldt on the video for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=manW5v-AR7U"><i>Drag Ropes</i></a> – his <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/q-a-storm-corrosion">Storm Corrosion</a> collaboration with <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/steven-wilson-everything-you-need-to-know">Steven Wilson</a>.</p>
      <p>A video for the English version of Ingen Sanning Är Allas (<i>Universal Truth</i>) will be released in December.</p>
      <p>Opeth are currently preparing to tour in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Opeth/app/123966167614127/">India, China, Singapore and Australia</a> before the end of the year and will <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/news/opeth-will-tour-across-north-america-in-2020">head out on the road across North America with Graveyard in early 2020</a>.</p>
      <p>It was also recently confirmed that <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/news/opeth-tesseract-ihsahn-and-more-confirmed-for-arctangent-2020">Opeth would headline next year’s ArcTanGent festival in the UK</a>.</p>
      <p>Akerfeldt said: “We're excited to play the ArcTanGent festival in Bristol. Been to Bristol a few times and it's always a pleasure. It'll be one of the last festivals we play that summer, so we want to ‘go out with a bang’ and need your help and participation to do so.”</p>
