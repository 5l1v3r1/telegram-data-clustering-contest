      <h4>HIGHLIGHTS</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>MS Dhoni has not played international cricket since World Cup 2019</li>
        <li>Dhoni may play for Asia XI against Rest of World in March 2020</li>
        <li>BCB has requested BCCI to allow 7 of its top players for the T20I matches</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The wait for MS Dhoni's return to international cricket could well be over in March next year, ahead of the 13th edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL).</p>
      <p>Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) has sought permission from the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) to allow seven of its top cricketers to be part of the Asia XI team, which is scheduled to play two T20 Internationals against the Rest of the World.</p>
      <p>The two matches are scheduled on March 18 and 21, and have already been accorded the status of international matches by the International Cricket Council (ICC).</p>
      <p>Besides Dhoni, the other top cricketers, that the BCB has requested for are Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma, Jasprit Bumrah, Hardik Pandya, Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Ravindra Jadeja.</p>
      <p>"Yes, Bangladesh is scheduled to host two T20 Internationals between Asia XI and Rest of the World. We are in touch with BCCI and other cricket boards of the Asian region to allow their players to be part of these two games," BCB chief executive Nizamuddin Chowdhury told India Today.</p>
      <p>Dhoni hasn't played any cricket since the World Cup semi-final against New Zealand in July. Subsequently, he was unavailable for the series that followed the World Cup and there has been no clarity on his return to international cricket.</p>
      <p>Dhoni made himself unavailable for selection for India's tour of West Indies in August as he took a sabbatical to train with the Para Regiment of the Indian Army in Kashmir.</p>
      <p>He did not play the limited-overs series against South Africa at home and wasn't part of the T20I team that beat Bangladesh 2-1 in a recently-concluded series. Dhoni was also not named in India's limited-overs squads for the upcoming ODI and T20I series against West Indies despite videos of his training session in Ranchi going viral just before the team announcement.</p>
      <p>If BCCI does give a go-ahead to BCB's request and Dhoni agrees to be part of those matches, it could well end a long suspense over Dhoni's future.</p>
      <p>Dhoni, in all likelihood, will continue to lead Chennai Super Kings in the IPL this season but before that, the most decorated India skipper could make an international return.</p>
