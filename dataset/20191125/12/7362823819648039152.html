      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/new-orleans-saints">New Orleans Saints</a> defensive end Cam Jordan took some heat Sunday against the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/carolina-panthers">Carolina Panthers</a> when he appeared to strike quarterback Kyle Allen after a play had been blown dead.</p>
      <p>The play occurred in the second quarter. Allen had been sacked by Saints linebacker Demario Davis when the referee blew the play dead -- just as it appeared Jordan had punched Allen in the stomach. Davis was celebrating as if he completed the sack, but the Saints were penalized for Jordan’s action.</p>

      <p>Jordan explained what he was trying to do at that moment in the game.</p>
      <p>“I’m trying to punch the ball out,” he told <a href="https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2019/11/24/cam-jordan-on-foul-against-kyle-allen-im-trying-to-punch-the-ball-out/">Pro Football Talk</a>. “I’m going full go until I hear the whistle.”</p>

      <p>Jordan was asked whether he said anything to Allen after the play. The defensive lineman told Pro Football Talk he called Allen an “actor” and claimed the quarterback flopped.</p>

      <p>Jordan is likely facing a fine for striking Allen. He finished with five tackles, including one for a loss, and one pass deflection.</p>
      <p>New Orleans eeked out a 34-31 victory against Carolina. Saints kicker Will Lutz kicked a 33-yard field goal as time expired to seal the win.</p>
