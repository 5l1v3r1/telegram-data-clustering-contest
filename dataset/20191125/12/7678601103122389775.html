      <h1>Indonesia’s 2021 MotoGP to offer racing fans pre-booking opportunity in January</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T12:59:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 12:59</time> by <a rel="author">News Desk</a></address>
      <p>The Indonesian organizers of the 2021 MotoGP have announced that they will start offering pre-booking opportunities in January next year.</p>
      <p>During Saturday’s launch, the organizers said they would offer 20,000 pre-booked spots, starting from Jan. 20 until August 2020, for racing fans via <i><a href="https://www.motogp.com/">motogp.com</a></i> and Mandalika Grand Prix Association’s (MGPA) official website, <i><a href="https://mandalikagrandprix.com/">mandalikagrandprix.com</a>.</i></p>
      <p>“By pre-booking tickets, MotoGP superfans will have the opportunity to choose seats either in grandstand or general admission.</p>
      <p>“Nevertheless, we have not decided the ticket price because we’re still discussing it with Dorna. The ticket price will depend on the race day and seating category,” CEO of MGPA Ricky Baheramsjah said in a statement.</p>
      <p>He went on to say that those who pre-booked would be prioritized for ticket purchase once the season’s calendar was out. They would also receive benefits, including the ability to choose their seating category as well as supporting services, such as parking zone during the race, added Ricky.</p>
      <p>Besides announcing the pre-booking opportunity, the organizers also launched the official design of the Mandalika International Street Circuit for the 2021 race.</p>
      <p>Key persons attending Saturday’s event included State-Owned Enterprises Minister Erick Thohir, Tourism and Creative Economy Minister Wishnutama, MotoGP's commercial rights holder Dorna Sport SL (Dorna) sporting director Carlos Ezpeleta, five-time MotoGP champion Michael Doohan of Australia and Indonesian Tourism Development Corporation (ITDC) president director Abdulbar M. Mansoer.</p>
      <p>Indonesia has signed a deal with Dorna to host MotoGP races for five years. The first will be held in 2021 under the organizing of MGPA, a business unit of state-owned ITDC. The country has also signed a deal to host the FIM Motul Superbike World Championship.</p>
      <p>The MotoGP and Superbike races will be held in the street circuit within the Mandalika Special Economic Zone in Lombok, West Nusa Tenggara.</p>
      <p>Indonesia is developing Lombok as a new tourist destination to follow the successful path of its famous neighboring island, Bali.</p>
