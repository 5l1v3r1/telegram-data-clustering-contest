      <h3>Big spike in business</h3>
      <p>Glanbia digital marketing manager James Byrne said they’re bracing themselves for a big spike in business for Black Friday.</p>
      <p>“Last year, Black Friday was huge for us and this <b>week-long sale</b> offers our farming and predominantly rural clientele an opportunity to grab real savings across a huge variety of items, from farm hardware, calving, animal health and rodent control to clothing and footwear, gardening, hand and power tools, fuel offers and more,” said James.</p>
      <p>“Rather than offering crazy deals on a small number of products, our approach is to offer our customers genuine value across more than <b>5,000</b> everyday products across our entire range,” he said.</p>
