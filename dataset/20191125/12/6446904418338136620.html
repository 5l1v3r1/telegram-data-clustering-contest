      <h1>Intel's new €3.6 billion manufacturing plant in Leixlip gets green light</h1>
      <h2>The development had been opposed by a local farmer.</h2>

      <p>AN BORD PLEANÁLA has given the green light to plans by Intel for its proposed new $4 billion (€3.63bn) manufacturing fabrication (FAB) facility at its Leixlip plant.</p>
      <p>The appeals board has given the chip giant the go-ahead for the project after finding that the plan would constitute a reasonable and orderly expansion of the existing manufacturing use at the location.</p>
      <p>The proposal was opposed by local farmer, Thomas Reid who last June appealed the Kildare County Council decision to grant to An Bord Pleanala.</p>
      <p>The planning permission follows three years on after Intel secured planning permission for the first phase of the ‘fab’ facility valued at $4 billion. </p>
      <p>In total, the two planning permissions represent a $8 billion (€7.26 billion) investment which will employ 6,000 construction workers at peak and 1,600 full-time jobs on completion.</p>
      <p>The projects represent the largest single private investment in the history of the State on one project if given the go-ahead by Intel globally.</p>
      <p>Consultants for Intel told Kildare Co Council that the firm has already invested $12.5 billion on its site at Leixlip.</p>
      <p>The appeals board gave the plan the go-ahead after concluding that the proposal accords with national, regional and local planning policy and would not be injurious to amenities of the area or property in the vicinity.</p>
      <p>The board order upheld the recommendation to grant by Senior Planning inspector, Paul Caprani at the end of his 83 page report.</p>
      <p>The application is the eight Intel Leixlip application Mr Reid has objected to since 2012  with six previous Intel applications brought before An Bord Pleanála by Reid.</p>
      <p>Reid unsuccessfully opposed the $4 billion first phase of the ‘fab’ plan in 2017 when lodging an objection against the application and then appealing the Council decision to An Bord Pleanála.</p>
