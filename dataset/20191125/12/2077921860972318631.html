      <p>The show is said to return with a couple of new issues. In order to move forward with his girlfriend, Ola, played by Patricia Allison, Otis (Asa Butterfield) must master his newly discovered sexual urges. At the same time, he must balance the now-tense relationship with Emma Mackey’s Maeve. Moordale Secondary also is in the middle of a chlamydia outbreak, highlighting the need for better sex education at the school, and new kids come to town who will challenge the status quo.</p>
      <p>The show’s renewal was <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2019/02/sex-education-renewed-season-two.html">announced back in February</a> and, in a fairly out-of-character move by <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/tag/Netflix">Netflix</a>, the streamer <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/netflixs-you-track-40-million-viewers-1177025">revealed</a> that in its first four weeks on the service, 40 million households tuned in to <i>Sex Education</i> Season 1.</p>
      <p>Revisit Season 2’s first look <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2019/11/netflix-drops-teasers-and-photos-for-season-two-of.html">here</a> and see its new key art below.</p>
