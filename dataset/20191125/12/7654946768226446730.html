      <p>Jeffrey Epstein’s alleged madam, Ghislaine Maxwell, is finally set to come out of hiding and possibly talk to the FBI, according to a report Monday.</p>
      <p>The British socialite is expected to emerge within days and<a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/20/ghislaine-maxwell-is-too-loyal-to-prince-andrew-to-implicate-him-in-fbi-interview-insider-says/"> defend her close friend Prince Andrew</a> in the wake of his disastrous interview over his ties to the dead pedophile, a source close to Maxwell’s lawyers <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10414777/prince-andrew-ghislaine-maxwell-epstein-reveal/">told the Sun</a>.</p>
      <p>“She has to defend herself. She has no option,” the source said. “Ghislaine is preparing to speak — whether by talking to the FBI or giving a statement to the media.”</p>
      <p>Maxwell, 57, an ex-girlfriend of Epstein’s, has been <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/08/20/ghislaine-maxwell-taught-epstein-victim-proper-way-to-perform-oral-sex-suit/">accused repeatedly in court filings</a> of having procured young girls for the convicted pedophile — and even abusing some herself.</p>
      <p>She is reportedly at the center of <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/08/12/feds-might-be-targeting-epsteins-gal-pal-ghislaine-maxwell/">ongoing investigations</a> into Epstein’s alleged sex ring since his death in his Manhattan lockup in August, after which she soon went into hiding, closing down her foundation.</p>
      <p>She has been said to be <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/16/ghislaine-maxwell-hiding-out-in-brazil-with-jeffrey-epsteins-modeling-scout-report/">hiding out in Brazil</a>, close to modeling agent Jean-Luc Brunel, who is also embroiled in the scandal.</p>
      <p>Maxwell is now ready to speak up, in part to back up the Duke of York’s claims that he <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/17/prince-andrew-claims-photo-with-epstein-sex-slave-is-fake-because-he-doesnt-hug/">had no memory of posing for the now-infamous photograph</a> showing him with his arm wrapped around Epstein accuser Virginia Roberts Giuffre, with Maxwell smiling behind them.</p>
      <p>“Like Andrew, she has no memory of it,” the source said of the picture supposedly taken at Maxwell’s London home in March 2001. “Ghislaine thinks there are a lot of problems with the picture and it is very fishy. It is one of very few photos that does not bear a time and date stamp.”</p>
      <p>Roberts’ lawyer, Josh Schiller, shot down any suggestion that the photograph was faked.</p>
      <p>“Virginia maintains that photo of her with Prince Andrew is totally genuine. And it certainly looks genuine to me,” Schiller told the Sun.</p>
