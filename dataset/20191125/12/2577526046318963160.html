      <h1>Man Spends Over £1 Million on Game Character, Which His Friend Accidentally Sold for £430</h1>

      <p>Whoops! According to <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/article/3038799/man-sues-netease-after-his-friend-sells-us14-million-game-character-us500"><i>South China Morning Post</i></a>, a man in China spent an eye-watering £1.08 million on his character in MMORPG <i>Justice Online</i>. His buddy accidentally sold said character for a mere £430. The man has filed a lawsuit against game company NetEase and his friend. Well, former friend, I guess.</p>
      <p>The friend, er defendant, had been loaned the character and reportedly tried to sell it <i>back</i> to the man for 388,000 yuan (£42,850). Instead, it was listed for 3,888 yuan (£430) on NetEase’s in-game marketplace and was soon purchased by another unrelated player. During the court mediation that followed, the defendant claimed the shockingly low price was due to a typo induced by exhaustion after a marathon gaming session.</p>

      <p><i>South China Morning Post</i> reports that the sued was settled by a judge who mediated the proceeding online. Authorities in China are now pointing to this mediation as a way judges can oversee legal disputes remotely.</p>
      <p>In the settlement, NetEase cancelled the transaction, and the plaintiff was ordered to pay 90,000 yuan (£9,940) in damages to the player who bought the $1.4 million character on the cheap.</p>
