      <p>Brittany Roth, 20, travelled from Kelowna to Indonesia for what she thought would be a month long vacation with her friends, but things took an ugly turn.</p>
      <p>Only six days into her trip, Roth was involved in a serious moped accident and didn't receive proper medical attention until after 12 hours of travel. </p>
      <p>On a small island near Bali, Roth slammed into a jagged rock wall on a sharp corner.</p>
      <p>She suffered a deep, open-wound on her left leg that left her knee cap exposed, an open wound on her left foot, a torn quadricep tendon and road-rash from her knee to her toes on her right leg.</p>
      <p>"At the time of the accident we didn't panic... I immediately asked my friend to call travel insurance," said Roth. </p>
      <p>"One of my other friends is training to be a (paramedic), so she was helpful trying to translate the language barrier between the paramedics and myself and she was able to make sure that we could stop the bleeding."</p>
      <p>With help from locals, the group managed to carry Roth across a bridge where they were met by an ambulance that took them to a nearby medical clinic, but the injuries were too severe to treat there.</p>
      <p>"The nurses at the medical clinic said that the wound was too deep on my knee to fix, so from there we had to quickly find a way to pay the bill before leaving, it was about $3,500."</p>
      <p>A second ambulance took her to a tour boat that transferred her in the darkness to Bali, where she eventually made it to a proper hospital.</p>
      <p>"I wasn't able to get a hospital room until I could make payment so we were waiting for travel insurance to kick in and it was really tight. They said I had 15 minutes or they were going to kick me out, which was scary," said Roth.</p>
      <p>While the accident happened at 2 p.m. Nov. 12, she didn't go for surgery until 6 a.m. the following day.</p>
      <p>She's unsure when she will be able to walk again, and doctors say she will need rehabilitation and physiotherapy.</p>
      <p>Roth arrived home in Kelowna on Nov. 23, spending a further $3,000 for the flight.</p>
      <p>Tanya Schilling started a <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-brittany-roth-with-travel-and-recuperation">GoFundMe campaign</a> to help Roth and her family with the medical bills, travel expenses and rehabilitation.</p>
