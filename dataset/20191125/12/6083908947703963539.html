      <h1>WaPo Claims Obama Is a Conservative</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T12:30:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 12:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://townhall.com/author/leahbarkoukis" target="_blank">Leah Barkoukis</a></address>
      <p>Not that you needed another example of how far the left has gone, but in Sunday’s Outlook section of The Washington Post, one of its editors actually made the case that former President Barack Obama is a conservative who was misunderstood by both the left and right.</p>
      <p>Assistant editor David Swerdlick argues in his piece, “Barack Obama, Conservative,” that the difference between Obama’s “steady approach and the seeming radicalism of his Democratic heirs can’t just be chalked up to changing times.” Did you catch that? “Seeming radicalism.”</p>
      <p>No, Obama wasn’t a Republican, the editor goes on to note, pointing to the fact that he never desired to shrink the federal government and opposed the Iraq War, but “Obama never dramatically departed from the approach of presidents who came before him.”</p>
      <p>“There’s a simple reason,” he says. “Barack Obama is a conservative.”</p>

      <p>While his policies were not right-leaning, it was his approach to governing that made him conservative, the author argues.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>But his constant search for consensus, for ways to bring Blue America and Red America together, sometimes led him to policies that used Republican means to achieve more liberal ends. The </i>

        <i>, he affirmed the power of the free market "to generate wealth and expand freedom."</i>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The author’s arguments get more ridiculous than that—he says Obama “studiously avoided any push for gun control” until Sandy Hook forced his hand; that Obama “believes, fundamentally, that the American model works” clearly forgetting Obama’s infamous pledge to <a href="https://www.cnsnews.com/commentary/dr-paul-kengor/how-obama-made-good-his-promise-fundamentally-transform-united-states">fundamentally transform America</a>; Swerdlick also says Obama’s second inaugural address “was a thoroughly conservative document,” praised as such by Newt Gingrich; the former president “embraced respectability politics”; and (<a href="https://www.city-journal.org/html/anti-cop-president-14653.html">anti-cop</a>) Obama “routinely extolled law enforcement,” even defending the justice system after George Zimmerman’s acquittal (after politicizing the tragedy, claiming if <a href="https://www.politico.com/blogs/politico44/2012/03/obama-if-i-had-a-son-hed-look-like-trayvon-118439">he had a son, he would look like Trayvon</a>.)</p>
      <p>That is but a sampling of the absurd arguments Swerdlick uses to support his claim that Obama is a conservative.</p>
      <p>Twitter users were quick to point out the author clearly understands nothing of what conservatism is about.</p>
