      <p>Super Eagles midfielder Ogenyi Onazi has paid money to cover the cost of Sani Emmanuel’s treatment.</p>
      <p>Emmanuel was named the best player at the 2009 FIFA U17 World Cup, but has been suffering from Achilles tendonitis – which forced his early retirement from football.</p>
      <p>The 26-year-old had solicited for help on social media following his inability to foot the bill for his surgery.</p>
      <p>Luckily for him, it was his former Nigeria and Lazio teammate Onazi who offered to come to the rescue of the ex-Beitar Jerusalem striker.</p>
      <p>“I got a call from the doctor that [Ogenyi] Onazi has paid 1.4m for my surgery and also transferred 50k for my ticket to Lagos,” an elated Emmanuel shared on Instagram.</p>
      <p>“Thank you very much, brother. May God continue to bless you. The surgery is scheduled for 2nd of December 2019.”</p>
      <p>Onazi, who helped Nigeria win the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations in South Africa, recently returned to football after a six-month injury lay off due to an Achilles injury.</p>
      <p>The injury forced him out of the team that claimed bronze at the 2019 African Cup of Nations in Egypt in the summer.</p>
