      <h1>MTS sells Vodafone Ukraine to Bakcell</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T12:20:11+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 12:20</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.mobileworldlive.com/meet-the-team/#mannypham" target="_blank">Manny Pham</a></address>
      <p>Russian operator group MTS agreed a deal to offload its subsidiary Vodafone Ukraine to Azerbaijani operator Bakcell for $734 million, as part of a broader strategy focusing on expanding its digital services play.</p>
      <p>In a statement, MTS president and CEO Alexey Korny said the deal advances the company’s aim of building “innovative digital services on top of a strong telecoms foundation”, noting Ukraine was a minor concern for the operator, which derives 90 per cent of group revenue from its “core market, Russia”.</p>
      <p>MTS used the Vodafone brand since 2008 under a licensing deal.</p>
      <p>Yusif Jabbarov, СЕО of Bakcell parent company NEQSOL, said in a related Vodafone statement the acquisition advances its international expansion plans: “Vodafone Ukraine’s business situation, rate of growth and effective performance ensure a reliable basis for further development. Therefore, we are ready to invest in order to implement innovations and advanced technology in Ukraine.”</p>
      <p>Vodafone said the sale won’t impact operations in Ukraine, with all “tariff plans, services and products” set to remain after the transaction is completed.</p>
      <p>GSMA Intelligence figures for Q3 placed Vodafone Ukraine as the second-largest player in the market by connections (including cellular IoT) with 20.3 million, almost a third of the Ukrainian market. It ranks behind Veon’s brand Kyivstar on 28 million connections.</p>
      <p>MTS said its board had also recommended approving a special dividend amounting to RUB13.25 ($0.21) per ordinary share.</p>
