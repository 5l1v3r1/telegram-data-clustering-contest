      <p>Despite a stumble from the gate that left <b><a href="https://www.horseracingnation.com/horse/Dennis_Moment">Dennis’ Moment</a></b> no shot in the Breeders’ Cup Juvenile, trainer Dale Romans believes he has the best 2-year-old in the country. Horse Racing Nation’s readers appear ready to coin him a top 3-year-old, too.</p>
      <p>Dennis’ Moment leads HRN’s fan-driven <b><a href="https://www.horseracingnation.com/p/c/Kentucky_Derby_2020_Contenders">2020 Kentucky Derby contender rankings</a></b> which, as of Monday morning, showed the last-place Juvenile finisher above recent Nashua Stakes (G3) winner Independence Hall and Tiz the Law, the likely favorite in Saturday’s Kentucky Jockey Club Stakes (G2) at Churchill Downs.</p>
      <p>The list is assembled based on star ratings assigned to horses by HRN readers, with Dennis’ Moment leading the way on the back of his 19 1/4-length maiden win at Ellis Park and easy victory in Churchill’s Iroquois Stakes (G3) before the Juvenile trouble.</p>
      <p>Others in the Top 5 are Grade 1 winner Maxfield and the promising Bob Baffert-trained maiden winner Thousand Words. Baffert leads all trainers with four horses in the current Top 20, his others being maiden winner Authentic at No. 13, Bob Hope Stakes (G3) hero High Velocity in 16th and in 17th Eight Rings, a Grade 1 winner also defeated in the Juvenile.</p>
      <p>The 1-2 finishers on Nov. 1 at Santa Anita Park were upsetter Storm the Court, who’s eighth, one spot behind Juvenile runner-up Anneau d’Or. The latter was making just his second start and dirt debut, perhaps giving him a higher ceiling into next year.</p>
      <p>Bill Mott, who won his first Derby in 2019 when Country House was placed atop the order, is back on the list thanks to Forza Di Oro, the No. 14 horse who was a bad break away from winning on debut. He returned to score at 1 1/16 miles when geared down at the finish.</p>
      <p>This time last year, Baffert-trained Game Winner and Improbable were 1-2 on the list. But Instagrand and Coliseum were both Top 5 horses — neither made it to the Derby — while Country House was a once-raced maiden and Maximum Security, first across the wire in a controversial running, had yet to debut.</p>
      <p>So there’s plenty left to settle before the May 2, 2020, race, and we’ll be tracking these horses’ progress.
