      <p>Boeing quietly unveiled the latest iteration of its troubled 737 Max aircraft on Friday, even as the plane remains grounded globally after two deadly crashes.</p>
      <p>At a low-key ceremony at its headquarters in Renton, Washington, attended mainly by employees, Boeing released the 737 Max 10, the largest version of the Max yet.</p>
      <p>The Max 10 seats a maximum of 230 passengers, around 30 more than the Max 8, the aircraft model involved in the two crashes that killed a total of 346 people.</p>
      <p>Rather than the usual fanfare and excitement surrounding the launch of a new plane model, Boeing barely publicized the launch of the Max 10, <a href="https://boeing.mediaroom.com/news-releases-statements?item=130578#assets_20295_130578-117">sending only a brief press statement</a> with a single picture of the aircraft.</p>
      <p>It used the statement to try to focus on safety, as questions continue about the recertification of the 737 Max and its eventual return to service.</p>
      <p>“This team’s relentless focus on safety and quality shows the commitment we have to our airline customers and every person who flies on a Boeing aeroplane,” the statement said.</p>

      <p>It remains unclear when the 737 Max will be allowed to fly again as the Federal Aviation Administration <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/boeing-737-max-mcas-canada-aviation-regulator-leaked-email-2019-11">continues to assess changes made to MCAS</a>, the software on the Max that has been blamed for both crashes.</p>
      <p>It is expected to return at some point in 2020, but <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/united-boeing-737-max-flights-cancelled-through-march-2019-11">many airlines which fly the plane have removed it from their flight schedules until at least March next year.</a></p>
      <p>The unveiling of the Max 10 comes alongside <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/aviation-workers-back-new-aircraft-safety-bill-737-max-crisis-2019-11">continued fears from workers in the aviation industry</a> over whether the Max will be safe once it returns to service.</p>
      <p>Earlier in November, the head of the union representing American Airlines cabin crew implored Boeing to involve flight attendants in the process of re-certifying the 737 Max, saying that some crew are <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/boeing-737-max-american-airlines-staff-beg-avoid-plane-2019-11">literally begging not to fly on the plane when it returns to service</a>.</p>
      <p>Days before, pilots for Southwest Airlines <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/737-max-southwest-pilots-boss-boeing-forcing-plane-back-2019-11">accused Boeing of “arrogance, ignorance, and greed” over the Max.</a></p>
      <p>The launch of the new jet came at the end of a week when airlines put their faith strongly in the Airbus A321 XLR, a rival to the Max 10.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/dubai-air-show-deals-planes-sold-airbus-boeing-plane-makers-2019-11">Airlines announced orders worth around $US5.7 billion for the A321 XLR</a> during the Dubai Airshow last week, with 40 of the planes ordered at the show.</p>
