      <h1>Aldi's Kevin The Carrot range turns up on eBay after selling out within hours</h1>

      <p>In the early hours of this morning, while most of us were sleeping soundly, parents were frantically trying to get their hands on <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/aldi/">Aldi</a>’s new Kevin The Carrot range.</p>
      <p>The frenzy began at 3am, as the supermarket released merchandise of its festive character online, with queues going into the thousands.</p>
      <p>Products included a one-metre long cuddly toy replica of Kevin The Carrot, who has been rescued from the Leafy Blinders by Tiny Tom, and other characters like Katy Katie, as well as themed pyjamas, an inflatable snow globe and more.</p>
      <p>Within hours of going on sale, the products have now sold out – and people are outraged.</p>
      <p>‘What is my life waited over a hour in a queue for a toy carrot that isn’t even there,’ said one <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/twitter/">Twitter</a> user, who got stuck in the queue.</p>
      <p>Someone else was less upset about Kevin being sold out and more infuriated by the fact they couldn’t get through on the website to buy food..</p>

      <p>‘Any chance of sorting your website out?….I don’t want to buy a shitty little stuffed carrot toy, I just want to look at your Christmas food!,’ the tweet, which included a tag for Aldi, read.</p>
      <p>One person took a more humorous view of the situation, and posted a photo of their dog eating a carrot, captioning it: ‘Sorry @AldiUK I think Ralph owes #KevinTheCarrot an apology!’</p>

      <p>Some lucky people did manage to get through the queue, with the toys now in high demand.</p>
      <p>‘Managed to get my mam a Kevin the Carrot today and yed [sic] honestly think I’d gave her an organ or something,’ someone tweeted.</p>
      <p>Others decided to resell their now coveted items on eBay, with one Kevin The Carrot stuffed animal selling for as much as £150, more than seven times the original price, which is £19.99.</p>
      <p>Didn’t get your hands on the cherised carrot?</p>
      <p>Don’t worry, the products will be released in store this coming Thursday (28 November).</p>
      <p>However, if today has taught us anything, it’s that if you’re not desperate to get your hands on Kevin and his crew, it might be best to hold off the food shop until Friday… or risk the wrath of angry parents as they wrestle for a cuddly carrot.</p>
