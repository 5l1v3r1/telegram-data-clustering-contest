        <b>Nicholas Latifi looks destined for a Williams seat next season and the Canadian may have dropped his biggest hint yet as he confirmed he won't be racing in Formula 2 next season.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Latifi is in prime position to replace <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/robert-kubica">Robert Kubica</a> after the current <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/williams">Williams</a> driver announced earlier this year he would leave the bottom constructor after just one year back in the pinnacle of motorsport. It has been a very tough season for the Pole as he sits second bottom of the Drivers' Championship only ahead of his teammate, <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/george-russell">George Russell</a>.</p>
      <p>And now the Canadian Latifi may have dropped the biggest hint yet confirming he won't race in Formula 2 next season. He told <a href="https://www.gazzetta.it/Formula-1/24-11-2019/latifi-primo-pilota-williams-2020-prossimo-anno-non-saro-f2-3501355267443.shtml">La Gazzetta dello Sport</a>: <i>“Right from the start of the season I knew it would be my last year, whether it was good or bad.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>"I am happy to have done a good season. We will see what the plan will be for next year.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>The final seat to be decided for the 2020 season is the Williams seat with the rest of the field all confirmed.</p>
