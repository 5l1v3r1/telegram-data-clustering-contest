      <p>Mercedes-Benz has unexpectedly thrown its support back behind the V12 engine for inclusion in the next generation S-Class.</p>
      <p>The sudden announcement comes after Benz revealed the AMG fettled S65 Final Edition in March that was set to be <a href="https://www.goauto.com.au/news/mercedes-amg/paris-show-mercedes-amg-v8-to-live-on/2018-10-05/75866.html">the final encore</a> for the M279 6.0-litre bi-turbo V12 that has been serving as not only the flagship engine in the S-Class and Maybach ranges since 2012, but also by AMG for use in the S65 and previously, in the SL65 and G65.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://gtspirit.com/2019/11/22/exclusive-v12-will-return-next-generation-mercedes-benz-s-class-2021/">gtspirit.com</a> however, Daimler CEO Ola Kallenius made the surprise confirmation at the Guangzhou Automobile Exhibition in China this weekend following the reveal of the <a href="https://citizen.co.za/motoring/motoring-news-motoring/2208588/mercedes-benz-gls-transforms-into-extravagant-maybach-gls-600/">Maybach GLS 600</a>.</p>
      <p>Despite Kallenius ruling out the possibility of the GLS-based 600 receiving the V12, the online publication claims that the motor in question will likely be a development of the M279 that currently produces 463kW/1 000Nm, although expect it to be heavily updated in order to meet the stringent European WLTP emissions regulations introduced in September last year. Its retention however will likely see it being limited to the S-Class and its Maybach offshoots that are forecasted to arrive in 2021.</p>
