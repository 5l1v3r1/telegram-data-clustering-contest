      <p>Activist billionaire investor Carl Icahn is seeking to take control of the board of <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/oxy-stock">Occidental</a>, the oil and gas producer, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-24/carl-icahn-is-said-to-seek-control-of-occidental-s-board">Bloomberg</a>. </p>
      <p>Citing people familiar with the matter, Bloomberg said that Icahn seeks to nominate 10 directors in order to seize control before November 29. </p>
      <p>Occidental's stock in the last year has tanked. Since April, when it first announced interest in buying Anadarko Petroleum, it has fallen 42%. In August, Occidental announced it was buying Anadarko for $37 billion. </p>
      <p>According to Bloomberg, Icahn, who owns a $1 billion stake in Occidental, has been a vocal critic of the Anadarko purchase, attacking "the lack of a shareholder vote and the pricey $10 billion financing the company obtained from Warren Buffett to get the deal done."</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, on his website, Icahn released an open <a href="https://carlicahn.com/open-letter-to-occidental-petroleum-stockholders-4/">letter</a> to Occidental's stockholders, saying that the merger made "no sense" for stockholders and that the company's actions were "reprehensible."</p>
      <p>A representative for Icahn declined to comment to Bloomberg, while a representative for Occidental wasn't immediately available for comment.</p>
