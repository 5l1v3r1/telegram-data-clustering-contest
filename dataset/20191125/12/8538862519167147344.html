      <p>CD Projekt Red's next big RPG, <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/cyberpunk_2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, is scheduled to release on PlayStation 4 next April. However, as the launch of next-gen consoles draws closer, it has become a common assumption that the game will eventually be ported to the upcoming PlayStation 5. It turns out that is indeed looking to be the case, although it won't be happening at launch.</p>
      <p>During the developer's third-quarter earnings call, board member Michał Nowakowski said that the studio is indeed aware of what's coming in the future and that it would be logical to expect CD Projekt Red to work with those forthcoming consoles. However, whatever it is the team is working on won't be releasing next November. "I will only safely assume that it’s definitely not going to be around the launch timeframe of these consoles, so I think that’s pretty much it."</p>
      <p>The title will, of course, still be playable on PS5 thanks to backwards compatibility, but it looks like you can scrap any hopes of picking up a next-gen version of Cyberpunk 2077 along with the system at launch. It's not all doom and gloom, however, as the studio's president and joint-CEO jumps in to all but confirm the PS5 port will eventually arrive. "Our games were always kind of ahead of technology; they were always played best on strong PCs, so in many areas we are kind of ready or almost ready for stronger specs – so, from a technical perspective this seems to be doable."</p>
      <p>So, you're not going to be playing Cyberpunk 2077 on PS5 via a port this time next year, but it's very, very safe to assume that it will make its way to the platform natively at some point in the future. Are you going to hold off from purchasing the PS4 version of the game? Wait around in the comments below.</p>
