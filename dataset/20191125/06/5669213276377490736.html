      <p>6 sacks containing in total, 134 packages with cocaine, were found hidden in cargo of ore on board of bulk carrier DELPHI RANGER at Altamira, Mexico, soon after ship’s arrival on Nov 21. The ship arrived from Barranquilla, Colombia. No news yet on crew.<br/>It’s not about cocaine trafficking, it’s about safety of crews and bulk carriers, carrying ore to Mexico ports. This is the third known case of drugs found in ore, two previous took place also in Altamira, in August and September this year, at least one led to unlawful crew treatment.<br/><a href="http://maritimebulletin.net/2019/09/08/drug-bust-on-us-bulk-carrier-ubc-tokyo-in-altamira-mexico/">http://maritimebulletin.net/2019/09/08/drug-bust-on-us-bulk-carrier-ubc-tokyo-in-altamira-mexico/</a><br/><a href="http://maritimebulletin.net/2019/08/17/drama-of-arrested-in-mexico-bulk-carriers-crew/">http://maritimebulletin.net/2019/08/17/drama-of-arrested-in-mexico-bulk-carriers-crew/</a><br/>So what’s all about? Is it a new cocaine traffic route, and how crews may be safeguarded against unlawful actions both of criminals and of the police?<br/>Bulk carrier DELPHI RANGER, IMO 9438054, dwt 54042, built 2009, flag Bahamas, manager SAFBULK MARITIME SA.</p>
