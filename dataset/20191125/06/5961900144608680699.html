        <a href="http://www.schwarzkopf.com.au/en/home.html">PEDESTRIAN.TV has teamed up with Schwarzkopf to get your blonde locks shinin'.</a>
      </p>
      <p>So, you’ve been sporting those light locks for a hot minute now and think you’ve gotten over the initial newly-blonde-aftercare panic? Don’t rest too easy – proper maintenance is still essential in ensuring your hair doesn’t become brassy and dry.</p>
      <p>(Side note: if you need some beginner’s help, learn from my mistakes by checking out my newly-blonde hair guide below…)</p>

      <p>Whether we want to admit it or not, it requires quite a bit of care to maintain natural-looking blonde tones. I’ve been blonde for a few months now and, while I have more faith in myself regarding blonde hair management, there are still times when my hair gets a tad too brassy.</p>
      <p>In fact, I often need to remind myself to tone my hair, because once that brassy, dull look kicks in, it can seem like a never-ending battle to get it back to its shiny prime.</p>
      <p>Well, blonde hair can arguably be likened to one of Pavlov’s dogs – it’ll start to do what you want once it’s conditioned.</p>
      <p>For the fellow blondies out there, you’ll be able to relate to that feeling of intense satisfaction when your yellow locks start to absorb all of those blue-violet pigments. It’s soothing to the soul.</p>
      <p>For a price-savvy toner that produces instant changes, I’ve found that<a href="https://www.woolworths.com.au/shop/productdetails/860019/schwarzkopf-extra-care-blonde-toner"> Schwarzkopf’s blonde toner</a> has worked wonders. I’ve often questioned how helpful purple toners actually are in terms of helping the overall health of my hair, but I’ve found that Schwarzkopf’s toner not only keeps my hair blonde, but also repairs the broken bonds within the hair fibre, resulting in stronger hair.</p>

      <p>For best results, I’d keep the toner in for as long as possible (I often keep it in for up to 10 minutes), switching it out for a blonde purple shampoo every other wash to mix it up a bit. Just remember: people don’t use purple shampoo and toner in the same wash, unless blue-violet hair is more your vibe.</p>
      <p>Given that there are an abundance of places that stock it, like Woolies, Priceline and Chemist Warehouse, you’re bound to have a store around the corner from you that stocks some of that purple goodness.</p>
      <p>Besides, you deserve to keep those pesky brassy tones away and sport locks that has the likes of <b>Elle Woods</b>, <b>Paris Hilton</b> and<b> Justin Timberlake</b> quaking in their bleached booties. That’s what I call blonde ambition.</p>
