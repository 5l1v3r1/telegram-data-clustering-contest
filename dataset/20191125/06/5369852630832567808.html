      <p>OUR ICONS REACH milestone birthdays and it’s <i>us</i> that begin to feel old.</p>
      <p>Sonia O’Sullivan will turn 50 this week. How did that happen?</p>
      <p>Irish athletics will honour the occasion by inducting the Cork native into its hall of fame on Thursday.</p>
      <p>O’Sullivan may mark the big-five-oh with less formal celebrations.</p>
      <p>At <i>The42</i>, we plan on spending the next few days revisiting O’Sullivan’s incredible career, its vicissitudes, the controversies, memorable triumphs, her legacy and more. </p>
