      <p>"Our Wallaby and Wallaroo doubleheader events in Australia have been extremely popular with fans in Sydney in Perth," said chief executive Raelene Castle. "And we are looking forward to staging the first ever doubleheader in front of packed Marvel Stadium in Melbourne.</p>
      <p>"In 2019, we saw how much these events have captured the imagination of fans in both countries, with a sold-out sign at Optus Stadium in the west and again at Eden Park in Auckland a week later.</p>
      <p>"We expect there to be a lot of excitement in Melbourne to watch two fantastic test matches."</p>
      <p>The test is the first in a three-game series, where - for the first time in the Bledisloe Cupâ€™s 117-year history - the Wallabies will not host a match in Sydney, due to the unavailability of both ANZ Stadium and Allianz Stadium, which will both be undergoing redevelopment.</p>
