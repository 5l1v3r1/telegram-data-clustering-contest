      <h3>Key Quotes:</h3>
      <p>“A universal question has popped up amongst investors. There has been a slew of bad news on the India macro story – slowing economy, financial sector problems and a worsening fiscal position. And yet, the Indian rupee and bond yields have remained remarkably resilient. What explains this?</p>
      <p>Ironically, it is the macro stresses that  lie at the heart of this paradox. The associated slowing demand for credit, combined with rising <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/sentiment/risk-appetite">risk aversion</a>, is raising the proclivity of the financial sector to increase its exposure to government bonds. Moreover, driven by weak growth, the improving BoP position is anchoring the Rupee.</p>
      <p>A reversal in the current financial market trends will therefore, need to wait for a durable revival in growth.”</p>
