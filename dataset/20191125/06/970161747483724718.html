      <p>The pro-democracy opposition has won a resounding victory in Hong Kong elections, according to media tallies.</p>
      <p>The victory was a clear rebuke to city leader Carrie Lam and her handling of violent protests that have divided the Chinese territory.</p>
      <p>Hong Kong media said Monday that the pro-democracy camp had won a commanding majority of the 452 district council seats at stake, taking control of at least 17 of the city’s 18 district councils.</p>
      <p>The result of Sunday’s elections could force the central government in Beijing to rethink how to handle the unrest, which is now in its sixth month.</p>
      <p>The district councils have little power, but the vote became a referendum on public support for the protests.</p>

      <p>‘It’s a sound repudiation of the Carrie Lam administration and shows the silent majority are behind the demands of the protesters.’</p>
      <p>The media tallies are based on official results for the individual races.</p>
      <p>Ms Lam issued a statement saying her government respects the results and will listen to and seriously reflect on the opinions of members of the public.</p>

      <p>She said: ‘There are various analyses and interpretations in the community in relation to the results, and quite a few are of the view that the results reflect people’s dissatisfaction with the current situation and the deep-seated problems in society.’</p>
      <p>A record 71% of Hong Kong’s 4.1 million registered voters cast ballots on Sunday, well exceeding the 47% turnout in the district council elections four years ago. The large number of votes was slowing down the counting.</p>
      <p>The largest pro-Beijing political party suffered a major setback, with at least 155 of its 182 candidates defeated, according to media tallies.</p>
