      <p>The government has asked Coal India to produce at least 2 mmscmd of coal bed methane gas in the next two to three years, according to an official.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/coal-ministry">coal ministry </a>has directed the consultancy arm of Coal India (CIL) to be actively involved in coal bed methane (CBM) development in state-run firm's leasehold areas, the official said.</p>
      <p>This development assumes significance after the cabinet, last year, relaxed rules for Coal India for extraction of natural gas lying below coal seams in its blocks in a bid to quickly boost production.</p>
      <p>CBM is a form of natural gas trapped in coal seams underground, which can be extracted by drilling into the seam.</p>
      <p>According to the official, <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/coal-ministry">coal ministry </a>had last month asked the officials of Central Mine Planning and Design Institute (CMPDI) - the consultancy arm of CIL to get involved more actively for CBM development in CIL leasehold areas.</p>
      <p>"For this purpose, a suitable model may be finalised in consultation with respective CIL subsidiaries, and CIL should produce at least 2 million metric standard cubic metres a day (mmscmd) gas in two-three years' time as the country needs such clean gas," the official said.</p>
      <p>CMPDI informed the ministry that a model contract document and request for proposal to select CBM developer have been prepared and submitted to coal companies, the official said.</p>
      <p>"It was informed that the document will be approved by the respective subsidiary boards and then the CBM operators will be engaged," the official added.</p>
      <p>CMPDI was of the view that joint venture with coal production companies, being lessee, might expedite CBM development, the official said.</p>
      <p>Coal India accounts for over 80 per cent of domestic coal output.</p>
