      <h1>Paul Rudd Levels Chris Pratt With Superhero Fantasy Football Trash Talk</h1>

      <p>When playing fantasy football, there’s going to be some trash talk, and it’s not beneath Marvel stars Paul Rudd and Chris Pratt to do the talkin’… all in the name of charity, of course.</p>
      <p>AGBO Films — the production company founded by “Avengers: Endgame” directors Joe and Anthony Russo — is sponsoring a charity fantasy football league featuring 14 superhero movie stars. Called the AGBO Superhero League, it features stars like Tom Holland, Chris Evans, Robert Downey Jr., and the stars involved in this week’s big matchup, Rudd and Pratt.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/tv/B5JpELzAetR/?utm_source=ig_embed">Pratt started the smack</a> talk Friday when he posted a video while on location in Iceland.</p>

      <p>“I’m still following my fantasy team. I’m currently, I think, 5 and 6. But I’ve met Paul Rudd and I think he is also 5 and 6,” Pratt joked, comparing his winning record to Rudd’s height. But Rudd came back hard with a Star-Lord costume during a visit to NFL Network’s “Good Morning Football,” bringing up the <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/paul-rudd-ant-man-defeat-thanos-cringes-theory-video/">“Thanus” theory</a> (that a tiny Ant-Man flies up Thanos’ anus and grows, killing him — duh — instantly).</p>
      <p>“I have flown into Chris Pratt and destroyed him, just like I’m going to destroy his fantasy football team this Sunday,” Rudd said.</p>
      <p>Rudd went further, whipping out a pic of Pratt’s pudgy beach bod from his pre-Marvel, “Parks and Rec” days. Even worse, Pratt was wearing very short swim trunks with the American flag on it.</p>

      <p>“How can you desecrate the flag like that?” Rudd asked. “Betsy Ross is simultaneously rolling in her grave and throwing up in her mouth. You look at that picture and you can tell he hates America as much as he loves cheeseburgers.”</p>
      <p>Unfortunately for Rudd, he may have to eat his words. As of writing, he <a href="https://fantasy.espn.com/football/fantasycast?leagueId=48153503&amp;matchupPeriodId=12&amp;seasonId=2019&amp;teamId=11">trails Team Pratt 61-45</a> thanks in large part to the Seattle Seahawks defense providing 17 points for the Guardian of the Galaxy. Rudd will need some late heroics from Packers wideout Davante Adams and Ravens running back Mark Ingram, who are still to start for his team. Pratt’s kicker, Greg Zuerlein of the Rams, is also still to start.</p>

          <figcaption>It’s hard to believe — and sad, too, if you like these movies — that “Spider-Man: Far From Home” is the last Marvel movie of the year. There’s no more on the calendar until Fox’s “The New Mutants” early next year, and given how many times that one has been delayed it may not be safe to assume it actually will be the next Marvel movie.<br/>Anyway, the point is just we’re about to get into an extended hiatus. No more MCU movies, no non-MCU Marvel movies the rest of 2019. We’re getting a bit of a break from comic book movies, with only DC’s “Joker” origin movie left.</figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>58. "Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer"<br/></b>Just a nightmare. A total nightmare.

After losing director of the first two X-Men films Brian Singer to the first Superman reboot attempt, replacement <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/tag/matthew_vaughn/">Matthew Vaughn</a> gave way to eventual director <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/tag/brett_ratner/">Brett Ratner</a>, who might have killed off the superhero genre entirely were "Spider-Man" not blowing up the box office.</figcaption>

"The Avengers"<br/></b>The story is a total mess, relying heavily on moviegoers' memories of previous MCU films (if you didn't remember or know coming in what the Tesseract was, hoo boy). But the novelty of the Marvel's first big superhero team-up was irresistible, and director <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/tag/joss_whedon/">Joss Whedon</a> balanced his ensemble expertly, giving everyone plenty to do so none of them ever fades into the background.</figcaption>

Blade, by the way, remains the only black comic book character besides <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/tag/shaquille_oneal/">Shaquille O'Neal</a>'s "Steel" to get his/her own movie, though Marvel's "Black Panther" is slated for a 2018 release.</figcaption>

It was an inspired choice, because "Spirit of Vengeance" was exactly as nutty as you'd hope a PG-13 comic book movie would be.

          <figcaption><b>22. "Punisher: War Zone"<br/></b>Whereas the previous "Punisher" movie was melodramatic and contemplative, this one is just murderous. And it's <i>awesome.</i></figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>21. "Venom" <br/></b>How can anybody resist the pull of Tom Hardy doing comedy? This movie knows exactly what it's trying to be, and what it's trying to be is dumb and fun and nothing else. And it is extremely fun.</figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>20. "X-Men: Days of Future Past"<br/></b>Its time travel logic is a bit iffy, but "Days of Future Past" is still tremendously entertaining because, while epic, it's not overly serious. As "Back to the Future" taught us long ago, you can get away with a lot of logical leaps if you strike the right tone.</figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>17. "X-Men: Dark Phoenix"<br/></b>The main series "X-Men" movies have never achieved any sort of greatness, but at least "Dark Phoenix" ends the whole thing with one of the best efforts of the bunch. And that sequence on the train in the third act is easily the best action sequence of these movies.</figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>16. "Spider-Man: Far From Home" <br/></b>It’s frustrating that it doesn’t really deal with the immense fallout from “Avengers: Endgame,” but it’s still as visually creative as any movie in the MCU, and Jake Gyllenhaal’s Mysterio is an all-timer of a villain. Dude goes all the way out in this.</figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>15. "X-Men: First Class"<br/></b>The first "X-Men" movie that could be described as "fun." It's basically two movies crammed into one, story-wise, but director <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/tag/matthew_vaughn/">Matthew Vaughn</a>'s touch is so breezy and enjoyable that it totally works anyway, thanks in large part to a brilliant cast that includes <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/tag/michael_fassbender/">Michael Fassbender</a>, <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/tag/jennifer_lawrence/">Jennifer Lawrence</a> and <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/tag/james_mcavoy/">James McAvoy</a>.</figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>14. "Spider-Man: Homecoming" <br/></b>Not quite the best "Spider-Man" movie, but still an absolute delight, with a cast full of scene stealers. Michael Keaton as the Vulture makes for one of the best Marvel villains ever.</figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>13. "Deadpool 2" <br/></b>While you may get whiplash from the "Deadpool" sequel's occasional very serious and emo scenes, the rest of the movie is thoroughly delightful, somehow managing to be even funnier -- and more hilariously violent -- than the original.</figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>12. "Ant-Man"<br/></b>"Ant-Man" represented a first for the MCU by being a straight-up comedy. And it's a very good one, with a cast that's perfectly suited for it. Aside from <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/tag/paul_rudd/">Paul Rudd</a> who plays Ant-Man himself, <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/tag/michael_pena/">Michael Pena</a> is the true standout as Scott Lang's best friend and former cellmate.</figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>11. "Ant-Man and the Wasp" <br/></b>It's ever so slightly frustrating that this one doesn't fully integrate into the "Infinity War" situation, but even so it's thoroughly a delight. Evangeline Lilly is so good at the Wasp that I'm retroactively irritated that she didn't don the suit in the previous "Ant-Man" movie.</figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>10. "Doctor Strange"<br/></b>If it weren't hamstrung with all the requisite elements of an origin story, "Doctor Strange" might have been the best Marvel movie ever. That's the power of the astonishing visual imagination on display here. People love to talk about the nebulous concept of capturing some long lost childlike sense of wonder though the magic of cinema -- "Doctor Strange" is one of the only movies I've watched as an adult that really accomplishes that.</figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>9. "Spider-Man 2"<br/></b>This is a movie that fully understands its main character and taps into what made him such a captivating figure for so long. Yeah, Peter Parker's a superhero, but he's also a college kid working a minimum wage job to make rent while also taking university physics classes. Peter buckles under the pressure, something we can all relate to.</figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>8. "Iron Man 3"<br/></b>As far as I'm concerned this is <i>the</i> "Iron Man" movie. Somehow, <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/tag/shane_black/">Shane Black</a> was able to infiltrate the MCU and make a legitimate <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/tag/shane_black/">Shane Black</a> movie with all the wit and raw humanity you'd expect from him. It carries exactly the sort of authorial identity we should want all these movies to have.</figcaption>

          <img src="https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Captain-America-Civil-War.jpg"/>
          <figcaption><b>6. "Captain America: Civil War"<br/></b>Multiply the two previous best Marvel movies by one another and you get "Civil War." It packs the sort of emotional payoff all the disconnected Marvel movies can't really provide. And as an action film it's <i>easily</i> the best of the superhero genre.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <figure>
          <img src="https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/avengers-infinity-war-wakanda.jpg"/>
          <figcaption><b>5. "Avengers: Infinity War" <br/></b>You could certainly make the argument that "Infinity War" does not really hold up on as a complete movie on its own, because it kinda begins with the second act. But I don't care. The culmination of this ten-year shared universe experiment <i>should</i> stand on the shoulders of the movies that came before it. The fact that it packs such a profound emotional punch, however, is what really makes it work.</figcaption>

          <img src="https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/BlackPantherJordan.jpg"/>
          <figcaption><b>4. "Black Panther" <br/></b>It's held back a little by being saddled with standard "origin movie" issues -- introducing audiences to the world of Wakanda isn't a quick and easy task, and it could use an extra 15-20 minutes to flesh out the supporting characters -- but still manages to be the most substantial superhero movie ever. It's kind of amazing that Disney let writer/director Ryan Coogler make this overt a political statement -- it's the most openly political mega-budget movie I've ever seen . Also, while I'm listing superlatives: Michael B Jordan delivers the best performance ever in a superhero movie. Good lord.</figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>3. "Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse" <br/></b>The best superhero movies, and movies in general, are the ones that are truly most human. And "Spider-Verse," despite being animated, despite the wacky cast of Spider-People, despite the outlandish premise, is as real as movies get.</figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>2. "Logan"<br/></b>James Mangold's small-scale western is a game changer for the entire superhero genre, daring to defy pretty much standard by which you expect these movies to operate. It's just a great movie by any normal standard. Where "Civil War" elevated the genre, "Logan" opts instead to be something else entirely and we're all the better for it.</figcaption>

"Captain America: The Winter Soldier"<br/></b>The Russo brothers, who made their entrance to the MCU directing "Winter Soldier" before taking the reigns on "Civil War" and, eventually, 2018's "Avengers: Infinity War," really impressed with "Winter Soldier." It's a classic spy thriller with a superhero twist. And <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/tag/robert_redford/">Robert Redford</a> as the bad guy is a really nice touch.</figcaption>
