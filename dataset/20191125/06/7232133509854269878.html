      <h3>Bitcoin Price Analysis</h3>
      <p>This past week, we discussed the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/22/bitcoin-btc-reaches-crucial-support-at-7-4k-larger-decline-in-play/">chances of more downsides below $7,500</a> in bitcoin price against the US Dollar. BTC did decline and broke the first key bearish target near the $7,000 level.</p>
      <p>Moreover, the price broke the $6,800 support zone and settled well below the 100 hourly simple moving average. It opened the doors for more losses below $6,700 and the price traded as low as $6,575 (close to the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/24/bitcoin-weekly-forecast-btc-aiming-key-6-5k-support/">main bearish target of $6,500</a> as discussed in the last medium term outlook).</p>
      <p>At the moment, the price is consolidating losses above $6,600. Besides, it is testing the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent downward move from the $7,279 high to $6,575 low.</p>
      <p>On the upsides, there are many resistances near the $6,880, $6,900 and $6,930 levels. The first major resistance is near the $6,930 level since it is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent downward move from the $7,279 high to $6,575 low.</p>
      <p>Additionally, there is a new connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance near $7,010 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. Therefore, bitcoin price needs to climb above the $6,930 and $7,000 resistance levels to start a decent recovery.</p>
      <p>The next major resistance is near the $7,360 level and the 100 hourly simple moving average. Conversely, the price may perhaps continue to move down below $6,600.</p>
      <p>The main support is near the $6,500 level, where the bulls are likely to put up a strong fight. Any further losses could decrease the chances of a short term correction and the price might decline towards $6,400 or $6,200.</p>

      <p>Looking at the <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/XBTUSD/">chart</a>, bitcoin price is clearly struggling to correct above $6,800. Thus, there remains a risk of another slide or spike towards $6,500 and $6,400 before an upside correction.</p>

      <p>Hourly MACD – The MACD is currently gaining momentum in the bearish zone.</p>

      <p>Major Support Levels – $6,500 followed by $6,400.</p>
      <p>Major Resistance Levels – $6,880, $6,920 and $7,000.</p>
