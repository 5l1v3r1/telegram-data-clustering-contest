      <p>A police officer has described the moment he wrestled with a knife-wielding man in his kitchen who tried to slice his throat with the blade.</p>
      <p>PC Matthew Chambers and PC Martin Clifton thought they were attending a simple recall to prison for an offender who had breached the conditions of his licence.</p>
      <p>But they found themselves fighting to save his life and protect their own when he became uncontrollable at a house in <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/">Mansfield</a> in May this year.</p>
      <p>PC Chambers said he was forced to wrestle with the offender after he grabbed hold of two large kitchen knives from a drawer.</p>

      <p>PC Clifton was then forced to fire his taser after attempting to pull the knives from his tight grip.</p>
      <p>Both have now being awarded for their brave actions on that night at the <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/crime">Nottinghamshire Police Awards </a>held at the city's Albert Hall on November 21.</p>
      <p>PC Chambers said: "It was a night shift and we went to this address and managed to get inside the property. He knew what we were there for and we let him get a bag packed."</p>
      <p>But when he was in the bedroom, he started to talk about killing himself, and then pushed past the officers and made his way into the kitchen.</p>
      <p>"I followed him and he immediately went for the first drawer and pulled out two kitchen knives," PC Chambers recalled.</p>
      <p>"I got on to his back and put one arm around his neck and the other arm was pulling the knives away.</p>
      <p>"I thought he was going to put the knives on us - but he was trying to harm himself.</p>
      <p>"I am not a big guy and I am not sure how I have pushed his arm away.</p>
      <p>"He was bringing the knives towards his throat and I am trying to pull his neck away.</p>
      <p>"It was a very hairy moment. How wrong it could have gone? We could have been stabbed or he could have stabbed himself.</p>
      <p>"He was holding the knives with both hands and the blade was coming towards his throat and my head. It was the first knife incident I have been to."</p>
      <p>PC Clifton, 38, said the incident took both officers "by surprise" and he used his taser, managing to take the knives off the suspect and arrest the man.</p>
      <p>"He was so compliant to begin with," he added. "It was a dangerous situation.</p>
      <p>"It was one of those things where you just act. You know what is expected of you the moment you join the job.</p>
      <p>"You just feel responsible for people."</p>
