        <b>WASHINGTONA Utah woman who stripped to her waist while working in her own home is fighting multiple counts of lewdness that could lead to a jail term and placement on a sex offender registry.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Tilli Buchanan, who is 27, said she and her husband were doing renovation work in their garage when plaster dust prompted both to remove their upper garments, according to a letter from her lawyer, Mr David Lane, to state prosecutors.</p>
      <p>When her three stepchildren - aged nine, 10 and 13 - saw them, they expressed shock. Buchanan told them that as a feminist, she believed she had as much right as her husband to go topless.</p>
      <p>But word of the incident reached the children's birth mother - who considered the incident "alarming" - and eventually came to the attention of social services workers investigating a different matter, the Salt Lake Tribune reported.</p>
      <h3>PRISON</h3>
      <p>That led to the filing of three charges of lewdness in front of children against Buchanan, leaving her facing a possible year in prison and 10 years on the sex offenders registry.</p>
      <p>Being on that registry has debilitating effects, restricting areas where one can live, harming employment prospects and raising the possibility of losing custody of one's children.</p>
      <p>Buchanan's lawyer is demanding the charges be dropped and her record expunged.</p>
      <p>"Because Tilli Buchanan is a woman," Mr Lane's letter states, "her bare chest is censured as being inherently pornographic and perverse, while her husband's bare chest is celebrated as an emblem of strength and pride."</p>
      <p>"Tilli Buchanan is being singled out for prosecution solely on the basis of sex."</p>
      <p>The judge in the case has said a ruling will not come before early next year.</p>
      <p>Utah is regularly ranked as one of the most conservative states in the US. - AFP</p>
