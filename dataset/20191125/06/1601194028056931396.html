      <p>It was a great night at the Allstate Arena in Chicago, IL as <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/wwe-survivor-series">Survivor Series</a> provided us with some splendid matches and some very interesting results (see the full results <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/wwe/wwe-survivor-series-2019-results-november-24th-survivor-series-winners-grades-video-highlights">here</a>). At the end of the PPV, NXT reigned supreme as they beat SmackDown and RAW by a healthy margin.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/raw">RAW</a> had a horrific night as they managed to secure only one win in the entire night and it came during the pre-show when The Viking Raiders defeated Undisputed Era and The New Day.</p>
      <p>There will be a lot of scrutiny on tonight's RAW and one man under the scanner will be Seth Rollins. Ever since his loss to The Fiend, The Architect appeared to be losing his way and Survivor Series was the perfect place to get back on track. However, The BeastSlayer was unable to get the job done.</p>
      <p>Tonight, the WWE Universe would be interested to know what would be Rollins' next course of action.</p>
      <p>What does he have in mind for the fans?</p>
      <p>Becky Lynch had the last laugh yesterday even though she was on the losing end as Shayna Baszler forced Bayley to tap out. The Man then launched a post-match assault and laid out the NXT Women's Champion and drove her through the announcers' desk.</p>
      <p>The WWE Universe would be interested to know what is in store for the RAW Women's Champion and what she will have to say about her actions after the main event.</p>
      <p>Brock Lesnar demolished Rey Mysterio to retain his WWE Championship in an exciting bout. The Beast was even attacked by Mysterio's son, Dominick, but Lesnar proved to be too strong for The Ultimate Underdog.</p>
      <p>Will we see another confrontation between these two?</p>
      <p>Guess you will have to tune-in to find out!</p>
