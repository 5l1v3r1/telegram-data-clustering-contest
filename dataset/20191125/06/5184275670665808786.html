      <p>Kangana Ranaut is sharing her new projects back-to-back. She recently shared the first look of Jayalalithaa’s biopic titled, ‘Thailavi’. The actress makes sure her choices stand out and never come out as conventional to the audience.</p>
      <p>The actress is all set to venture her a producer for an interesting film. She will be producing a film titled <i>Aparajitha Ayodhya</i> which is based on Ram-Mandir court case making headlines.</p>

      <p>The film will roll early next year and is scripted by KV Vijayendra Prasad, the creator of the <a href="https://www.koimoi.com/reviews/bahubali-review/"><i>Bahubali</i> </a>series.</p>
      <p>Why select such a crucial subject?</p>
      <p>“The Ram temple has been a burning topic for hundreds of years. As a child born in the ’80s, I have grown up hearing the name Ayodhya in a negative light because the piece of land on which was born a king, who was the epitome of sacrifices, became the subject of a property dispute. The case has changed the face of Indian politics and the verdict has ended the centuries-old dispute while embodying the secular spirit of India. What makes <i>Aparajitha Ayodhya</i> different is that it is the journey of the protagonist from a non-believer to a believer. And since, in a way, it reflects my personal journey, I decided it would be the apt subject for my first production,” stated Kangana Ranaut.</p>
