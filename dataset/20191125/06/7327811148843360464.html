      <p>OAKWOOD, Staten Island (WABC) -- It was an incredible act of bravery and heroism after two NYPD officers and two bystanders jumped into action to save two people trapped in a burning car on Staten Island.</p>
      <p>Jim Tucciarelli, 67, was driving home Saturday night when he saw a vehicle in flames. He heard crying from the woman in the front passenger seat, and immediately went to rescue her.</p>
      <p>"I'm not a hero or anything. We're human beings - anybody would do that," said Tucciarelli</p>
      <p>Tucciarelli says the vehicle was starting to fill up with smoke.</p>
      <p>"She said he couldn't move her leg. I said, 'it may hurt, but I'll move it for you' - I got her leg around," he added.</p>
      <p>As he was carrying her out, another neighbor arrived to help.</p>
      <p>"My faith in humanity has been restored. My neighbor who is not even well himself, literally pulled her out on his own," said Kim Schwartz.</p>
      <p>Once the passenger was safely out, Tucciarelli tells Eyewitness News he raced back in for the woman's boyfriend, who was unconscious in the driver's seat.</p>
      <p>"I was able to reach in and unbuckle the seatbelt. Flames coming through floorboard, vehicle starting to fill up with dark smoke. I was starting to choke. I couldn't breathe - I had to get out of the vehicle," said Tucciarelli.</p>
      <p>Thankfully, that is when an officer arrived, broke open the window, got the smoke out, and rescued the driver.</p>
      <p>Residents in the Oakwood section of Staten Island complain that the sharp s-turn along Mill Road is treacherous. They would like to see a speed bump or speed cameras slow down the drivers.</p>
      <p>The car burst into flames moments after the couple got out.</p>
      <p>Both the victims and the Good Samaritan were rushed to the hospital, where they remained Sunday night.</p>
      <p>Tucciarelli says he hopes to be home in time for Thanksgiving.</p>
      <p>"I got a lot to be thankful for this year, and I want to spend it with my family," he says.</p>
