        <b>SEA Games hosts the Philippines apologised yesterday after some arriving athletes were left stranded for hours at the airport or were driven to the wrong hotel, a logistical snafu that drew criticism just days before the meet officially begins.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Athletes have begun flying into Manila ahead of Saturday's opening, but for Cambodia and Timor-Leste's football squads, the arrival was not what they were expecting, reported AFP.</p>
      <p>"We had to wait maybe like eight, nine hours to get our hotel," Cambodia coach Felix Dalmas told a press conference yesterday, adding that they had also waited hours for the shuttle service.</p>
      <p>Timor-Leste's team were driven to the wrong hotel, complicating their arrival and training schedules.</p>
      <p>"All nations deserve respect and what happened yesterday was not so beautiful," said Timor-Leste coach Fabiano Flora.</p>
      <p>The Philippines' SEA Games organising committee offered an explanation for the hiccups, putting the blame on a last-minute change in travel plans and the afternoon check-in time of the hotel.</p>
      <p>"We sincerely apologise to our athlete guests... for the inconvenience caused to them by the confusion," the committee said in a statement.</p>
      <p>"We... vow to do better."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Thailand's football squad - which also waited for hours at the airport for the right documents - had to change their training plans because the hotel was too far from the venue.</p>
      <p>Coach Akira Nishino said they opted to work out in the streets near the hotel instead of spending hours travelling.</p>
      <p>Singapore's football coach Fandi Ahmad told The New Paper that he cancelled a training session and opted for some light stretching last Saturday because it would have taken over two hours' travel time for a venue that was booked for only one hour.</p>
      <p>The Games, the first hosted by the Philippines since 2005, are expected to draw thousands of athletes, journalists and dignitaries over nearly two weeks.</p>
      <p>These issue came as organisers were already under fire over a nearly US$1 million (S$1.4m) cauldron that will hold the Games' flame.</p>
      <p>Critics said the money it cost to build the 50-metre cauldron at the main stadium in Clark, north of Manila, would have been better spent helping the nation's children and poor.</p>
