      <h1>Volkswagen executive predicts 'rebellion' against SUVs and crossovers...</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T06:21:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 06:21</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.carmag.co.za/author/ryanbubear/" target="_blank">Ryan Bubear</a></address>
      <p>The head of Volkswagen in the United States says a “rebellion” against SUVs and crossovers is on the horizon, suggesting younger consumers will drive the predicted shift in buying behaviour.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/vw-usa-ceo-suv-rebellion-la-auto-show/"><i>Roadshow</i></a>, Scott Keogh, who is both president and CEO of Volkswagen Group of America as well as head of the VW brand for the North American region, said change was coming.</p>
      <p>"Rebellion tends not to come from 65-year-olds," Keogh said, according to the publication.</p>
      <p>Of course, as <i>Roadshow</i> points out, the Wolfsburg-based firm’s growing range of ID-badged electric concept vehicles contains all manner of body styles, with the latest <a href="https://www.carmag.co.za/news/new-models/new-volkswagen-id-space-vizzion-concept-is-a-250-kw-electric-wagon/">ID Space Vizzion</a> variant arriving in wagon guise.</p>
      <p>According to the report, Keogh said the German company’s electric MEB platform offered "nearly limitless" possibilities in terms of body styles, suggesting VW could rapidly react to changing tastes.</p>
