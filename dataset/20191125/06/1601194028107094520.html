      <p><a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/the-undertaker">The Undertaker</a> is one of the few WWE Superstars who has remained in character for the majority of his career.</p>
      <p>Over the last three decades, fans have seen “The Deadman” in more high-profile matches and storylines than anybody else in WWE, but we have hardly heard anything from the man behind the character, Mark Calaway, about his life in the sports entertainment industry.</p>
      <p>Following the 2019 Survivor Series pay-per-view, WWE released the first episode of <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/stone-cold-steve-austin">Steve Austin</a>’s new interview series, Broken Skull Sessions, on the WWE Network, and Calaway was the first guest.</p>
      <p>As you can imagine, the WrestleMania icon had plenty of stories to tell, dating all the way back to the early 1990s and up to the present day.</p>
      <p>In this article, let’s take a look at 18 things we learned from the interview.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h4>#1 He feels ‘pretty decent’ for his age</h4>

      <p>There has been a lot of speculation about whether The Undertaker could potentially retire from in-ring competition soon, especially after his match against Goldberg at Super ShowDown in June.</p>
      <p>At the start of the interview, he told Steve Austin that he feels “pretty decent” for somebody of his age (54) and he has recently made changes to his training and diet.</p>
      <h4>#2 He was told nobody would ever pay to see him wrestle</h4>
      <p>The Undertaker began to work as a singles competitor towards the end of his time with WCW. He expected to sign a new deal with the company when he sat down for a meeting with Jim Herd, Jim Barnett and Ole Anderson, only to be told by Anderson that he was a great athlete but nobody would ever pay money to see him wrestle.</p>
      <p>This comment played a big part in his decision to move on from WCW and eventually sign with WWE in 1990.</p>
