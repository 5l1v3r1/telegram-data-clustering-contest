      <p>CHICAGO – NXT North American Champion Roderick Strong may have fallen short at NXT Takeover: WarGames, but he followed up at Survivor Series with the biggest win of his career, defeating SmackDown’s Intercontinental Champion Shinsuke Nakamura and Raw’s United States Champion AJ Styles.</p>
      <p>Despite still feeling the effects of WarGames, Strong showcased his remarkable cardio throughout the Triple Threat Match — like sprinting to prevent a Styles Clash or surviving a double-team maneuver reminiscent of a Doomsday Device, an homage to Chicago’s Legion of Doom.</p>
      <p>Strong seemed out of the match after the Intercontinental Champion caught him with a Kinshasa, but as the NXT North American Champion recovered on the outside, Styles laid out Nakamura with a Phenomenal Forearm, giving NXT an opening. Strong somehow recovered enough to intercept the pin and steal the win, giving NXT a 3-1-1 lead at Survivor Series.</p>
