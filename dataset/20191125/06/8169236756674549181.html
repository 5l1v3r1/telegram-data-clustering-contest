        <b>Tottenham are reportedly the latest club to show an interest in the potential transfer of Bournemouth defender <a href="https://www.caughtoffside.com/tag/nathan-ake/">Nathan Ake</a>.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Dutchman has shone in the Premier League since leaving Chelsea for Bournemouth a few years ago, and it’s not too surprising to see that it seems only a matter of time before he’s back playing for a big six club again.</p>
      <h3>MORE: <a href="https://www.caughtoffside.com/2019/11/24/tottenhams-mourinho-clears-eriksen-transfer-to-real-madrid/">Tottenham manager Jose Mourinho makes big decision on Christian Eriksen transfer</a></h3>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.footballinsider247.com/sources-tottenham-line-up-transfer-missions-for-player-mourinhos-managed-before/">Football Insider</a>, Tottenham are keen on Ake to come in and provide an option at both centre-back and left-back.</p>
      <p>The 24-year-old has shown his versatility and quality and seems an ideal pick for Spurs at the moment, especially as they face doubts over a similar style of player in Jan Vertonghen.</p>
      <p>The Belgian is nearing the end of his contract with the north London club, so strengthening in defence makes sense as a priority for new manager Jose Mourinho.</p>

      <p>Chelsea have also recently been linked with Ake by the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/04/chelsea-transfer-ban-hearing-date-set-frank-lampard-rubs-hands/">Telegraph</a>, who suggest they could also have some edge in any potential transfer battle.</p>
      <p>Having sold Ake to the Cherries, it seems the Blues have the option to re-sign him for just £40million, according to the Telegraph.</p>
      <p>If true, it remains to be seen if Tottenham can step up their interest and perhaps give the player a more tempting offer, but it looks a challenge if his former club definitely decide to enter the running.</p>
