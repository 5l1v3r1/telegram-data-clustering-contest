      <h1>People around the world under the shadow of Google spy</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T06:30:32+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 06:30</time> by <a rel="author">Sajad Abedi</a></address>
      <p>New documents show that Google has also been collecting personal information from users by selling strategies similar to Facebook’s methods that violate users’ privacy and infiltrate their accounts and sell them to businesses. These companies, by exploiting user information, only care about their financial resources and revenue growth.</p>
      <p>One of Google’s main ways to monitor users’ information is that the user downloads a specific application from Google PlayStation and, after installing it due to the sophisticated design of the app, opens up the Google servers to collect personal information. Among the apps that have been the most attacked and infiltrated by infiltration are filter breakers.</p>
      <p>Spy agencies, with the help of Google designers with a high awareness of youth and teens in many countries around the world, and their perceptions and preferences in cyberspace, have posed the greatest threat to this age group. Due to the prevalence of adolescents using filters in parts of the world, Google has launched an extensive program to infiltrate information under the age of thirteen.</p>
      <p>Spyware in these applications starts right from the start of the program, when the user questions such as whether you allow the app to access information stored in the memory of your phone or tablet, and interestingly if the user responds in the negative, it doesn’t have the app, so the creators of these apps, working closely with Google, are taking over the users.</p>
      <p>After revealing new information from Google spy Web security experts said: “Even with this information, Google still acts much more transparent than Facebook. To counteract such actions by Google and Facebook, users need to be more secure in their systems than ever before and be well-informed about new ways to infiltrate their accounts. “Certainly, Facebook and Google are still being attacked, even with the change in their operating methods, because of the heavy-handed overtaking of the security agencies of the funding companies.”</p>
      <p>In general, Google can be considered the best and the largest Internet service provider in various fields. The rules of the website and all Google services state that the company stores the data of each user on its servers to provide better service. For example, when an Android app wants to access the phone numbers stored in the phone, it lets you know, and Google Maps, a virtual map, says when installing and delivering services that it monitors all your geographic information for a better service. But the story doesn’t end there, and the Associated Press newsletter in collaboration with Princeton University, after a long review, found that in some cases Google also seized personal information without users’ permission.</p>
      <p>By the end of 2016, Google’s Android operating system was installed on more than 82 percent of new smartphones sold worldwide, and by mid-2017, official data said more than 2 billion active Android smartphones were being used worldwide. That’s up from 2.5 billion in 2018. It also manages more than one billion internet searches worldwide, more than one billion minutes of video is watched daily on YouTube, more than one billion active Gmail accounts, and the latest statistics by the end of 2018, it shows that more than half of North American Internet traffic is being delivered to Google servers, and instead of being part of the Internet, Google is the Internet itself.</p>
      <p>Alphabet, Google’s parent company, had nearly 95,000 employees worldwide by the beginning of this year and has been named the second richest company in the world with revenue of more than $ 10 billion per season.</p>
      <p>Google was founded in 1998 by Lawrence “Larry” Page and Sergey MikhaylovichBrin, and began its first political deal with the US government six years later. Back then, a company called Keyhole was operating in San Francisco, which provided the CIA with a spy satellite program that essentially provided US intelligence with 3D satellite imagery.</p>
      <p>Google acquired the company in 2004 to formally partner with the US government. That same year, a $ 2.1 billion contract was signed between Google and the US National Security Agency (NSA), which obliged the global Internet giant to scan Internet searches in 24 different languages, wherever it was found to be false. Report to the relevant organization.</p>
      <p>In 2007, Google began partnerships with Lockheed Martin, the largest US military equipment manufacturer, to provide them with useful information during the Iraq war. The company then partnered with the National Geographic Intelligence Agency (NGA), which is essentially a security agency, on satellite imagery through satellite maps in 2010, and Google partnered with US intelligence and intelligence agencies on a daily basis. The day got stronger, and these were part of Google’s government activities during which time the media became public and the rest remained confidential.</p>
      <p>Of course, Google’s activities are not just about working with US spy agencies. In 2011, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) explained that it was assisting Google in protecting the environment. In 2014, the Boston Governorate requested Google to provide technology infrastructure to the 76,000 employees working in the city. Promote Work, Google 2016 was chosen as the flagship company to improve America’s Internet infrastructure for schools, as the company expanded its reach to global users.</p>
      <p>Under the current circumstances, it is impossible to imagine living without Google services. Android mobile operating system, weather app, web browser, YouTube video site, Gmail e-mail service, Chrome browser and hundreds of other public services we deal with throughout the day, and if We’re going to have to remove them, and we’re having trouble.</p>
      <p>Based on this, Jonathan Mayer warned Princeton University executives that 2.5 billion users of Android smartphones and even hundreds of millions of Apple users who use apps like Google Maps are spying on a daily basis.</p>
      <p>“If you disable geotagging in an app like Google Maps, it looks like your data is not stored in the app, but you should know that Google has the status of all the mobile devices that the apps on It monitors it installed on its servers and so you’re still under the magnifying glass of Google. “</p>
      <p>What is currently being charged in the case of Google relates to Google’s routing services and internet maps, and a Google spokesman in the first response explained: “We agree to re-use users’ geographic information once the history storage process is deactivated. We are tracking. This is aimed at upgrading services that users are going to use through Google’s platform and services. “We never use this information to spy.”</p>
      <p>While Google has denied any spying on users, the US Supreme Court is currently reviewing the lawsuit extensively to determine whether the center is likely to spy on other Google apps and services. Check to see what part of the world people can stay safe from Google!</p>
