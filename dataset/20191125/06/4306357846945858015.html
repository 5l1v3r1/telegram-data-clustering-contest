      <h3>Alan Shearer says Jose Mourinho will “guarantee” silverware at Tottenham Hotspur.</h3>
      <p>The Portuguese head coach was appointed as the club’s new manager last week after Spurs parted company with Mauricio Pochettino after five years.</p>
      <p>Mourinho made a solid start to his Tottenham reign after Spurs were 3-2 winners against West Ham United thanks to goals from Son Heung-min, Lucas Moura and Harry Kane.</p>
      <p>Tottenham hoisted themselves up to ninth place in the Premier League table thanks to their victory at the London Stadium in Mourinho’s opening game.</p>
      <p>The 56-year-old will be hoping to rebuild his reputation at Tottenham following difficult ends to his spells in charge of Chelsea FC and Manchester United.</p>
      <p>Mourinho won the Premier League and the League Cup during his second stint at Chelsea FC, while the former Porto boss won the Europa League and the League Cup at Old Trafford.</p>
      <p>Former Newcastle striker Shearer believes Mourinho should bring success to Spurs despite questions about his suitability to the role.</p>
      <p>“What he guarantees is trophies,” Shearer told <i>Coral</i>.</p>
      <p>“Wherever he goes, trophies follow him so I expect that to continue at Tottenham.</p>
      <p>“I think Jose will have to change as at Chelsea and Manchester United, he took the players and dressing room on and ultimately lost his job.</p>
      <p>“He has had time to reflect on that and he will understand the mistakes he made.”</p>
      <p>Tottenham lost to Liverpool FC in the Champions League final in Madrid last season following a 2-0 defeat.</p>
      <p>Spurs will take on Greek side Olympiacos in the Champions League at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>Tottenham will host Bournemouth in their next Premier League fixture.</p>
