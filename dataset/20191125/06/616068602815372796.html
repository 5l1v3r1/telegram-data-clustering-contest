      <p>British Columbia's New Democrats wrapped up a three-day convention Sunday after nearly 700 delegates voted on resolutions including those that would pressure the federal government to deliver more affordable cellphone and internet options.</p>
      <p>Other successful resolutions the party highlighted in a news release are aimed at supporting a so-called Period Promise campaign by encouraging the government to offer free menstrual products in all public buildings in B.C.</p>
      <p>Delegates also voted on resolutions around ending parking fees at hospitals and lowering the voting age to 16 in civic and provincial elections as part of a gathering that included training and workshops.</p>
      <p>The B.C. Teachers' Federation decided to hold its own meeting of school-district representatives near the NDP convention on Saturday to draw attention to failed contract talks.</p>
      <p>But Premier John Horgan says the convention was no place for teachers to bring up issues that belong at the bargaining table.</p>
      <p>Horgan also says the government is not prepared to wade into a transit dispute in Metro Vancouver and that workers and employers should resume negotiations before a planned three-day shutdown of bus service this week.</p>
