      <p>K-pop star and TV celebrity Goo Hara has been found dead at her home in Seoul, police say.</p>
      <p>Police say an acquaintance found the 28-year-old dead at her home in southern Seoul on Sunday and reported it to authorities.</p>
      <p>The cause of death wasn’t immediately known. Police refused to provide further details.</p>

      <p>Hara made her debut in 2008 as a member of the girl group Kara, which had big followings in South Korea, Japan and other Asian countries. She later worked as a solo artist and appeared on many TV shows.</p>
      <p>In May, Hara was reportedly found unconscious at her home and was hospitalised.</p>
      <p>She was embroiled last year in public disputes with an ex-boyfriend who claimed to have been assaulted by her.</p>
      <p>Hara accused him of having threatened to circulate a sex video of her. The case made her the subject of tabloid fodder and malicious online messages.</p>
      <p>Amid the dispute, Hara’s agency terminated her contract. In June, she signed a new contract with leading talent management agency Production Ogi in Japan, where Kara had enjoyed huge popularity.</p>
      <p>Under Ogi, Goo appeared on TV shows and major fashion events in Japan. She also released a solo Japanese single Midnight Queen on November 13.</p>
      <p>In October, another K-pop star and actress, Sulli, was found dead at her home near Seoul. She was a close friend of Hara’s.</p>
      <p>The 25-year-old was known for her feminism and outspokenness that was rare among female entertainers in deeply conservative South Korea.</p>
      <p>Before her death, she appeared in a TV show and spoke out against the online backlash she had received over her lifestyle.</p>
      <p>Since the late 1990s, there has been a succession of deaths among young K-pop talent. Many have complained of depression while others have indicated signs of a highly toxic industry that, behind the glamorous and shiny exterior, tramples on human dignity.</p>
      <p>In 2009, actress Jang Ja-yeon took her own life, leaving a note claiming that she had been sexually abused by powerful figures in the entertainment industry.</p>
