      <p>A police constable R. Venkatesan, <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/woman-sets-constable-on-fire-arrested/article30071005.ece">who was battling for life at Government Kilpauk Hospital</a> with burn injuries, has died. A police official of Thirumullaivoyal police station said he died on Sunday night.</p>
      <p>The constable, a resident of the police quarters in Thirumullaivoyal, was admitted in the hospital after he suffered more than 80% burn injuries in his house on Saturday night. Initially, the police were informed that he had attempted suicide by dousing himself with petrol, upset over some issues with his live-in partner. The constable had earlier been married to another woman who had left him a few months ago, sources said.</p>
      <p>The police, on suspicion, interrogated his live-in partner, and found out that she had poured petrol on him and set fire to him, while he was asleep. The victim also confirmed this in a statement he made while in the hospital.</p>
      <p>The police have arrested the partner, Asha, and have filed a case of murder.</p>
