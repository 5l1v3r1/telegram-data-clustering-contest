      <p>Indian shuttler <a href="https://www.india.com/topic/Lakshya-Sen">Lakshya Sen</a> clinched his fourth title in three months after he won the Scottish Open men’s singles title.</p>
      <p>Lakshya, ranked number 41 in the world rankings, had entered the tournament as the top seed and played as per expectations as he defeated Brazilian Ygor Coelho 18-21, 21-18, 21-19 in the final which lasted for 56 minutes to claim the title in Glasgow on Sunday night.</p>
      <p>In the opening game of the summit clash, Lakshya had fallen behind but he managed to turn the tables and grab a 10-8 lead. However, his Brazilian opponent went on to register six straight points and ultimately went on to win the game 21-18.</p>
      <p>The Indian shuttler, however, made a stunning comeback in the second game, winning it 21-18 and took the match into the decider.</p>
      <p>In the third and final game, both shuttlers gave their all and battled hard to gain the lead. World No. 58 Coelho took an 11-8 lead at the mid-game break but Lakshya kept on making comebacks and eventually won the contest.</p>
      <p>“Happy to win the Scottish Open title! A hard-fought match against my friend Ygor Coelho. It was really nice training with you in Denmark and playing a good match against you today,” Lakshya tweeted after the win.</p>
      <p>Before the Scottish Open, the 18-year-old had won SaarLorLux Open, Dutch Open, and Belgian International in which he participated since September.</p>
      <p>In March, Lakshya started with a silver medal at the Polish Open International Challenge. Thereafter he suffered a series of disappointing exits. However, Lakshya didn’t give up and went on to win the Belgian International in September, his first title of the year.</p>
      <p>After that, he won his first BWF Super 100 title at the Dutch Open and went on to win SaarLorLux Open in Germany.</p>
      <p>Lakshya will next participate in the Syed Modi International Championship, starting Tuesday in Lucknow.</p>
