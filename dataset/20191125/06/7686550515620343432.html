      <p>Strictly Come Dancing's Welsh dancer Amy Dowden was reportedly left "in tears" after coming through the dance-off with partner Karim Zeroual.</p>
      <p>In a controversial twist, the couple, who are favourites to win, found themselves in the dance-off despite finishing joint-top of the leaderboard. Their emotional Contemporary Couples Choice to Drops Of Jupiter by With Confidence left the audience in tears and won high praise from the judges but failed to impress the voting public.</p>
      <p>The judges unanimously chose to save them over Saffron Barker and AJ Pritchard, but <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/strictlys-amy-made-traumatic-confession-20951893">The Mirror reports</a> Amy burst into tears off-camera.</p>
      <p>Amy, 28, is from Caerphilly and is engaged to fellow dancer, Ben Jones. After the surprising dance-off situation, she was comforted by fellow professional dancer Neil Jones.</p>
      <p>The Mirror quotes a Strictly source sa saying: "Amy was utterly devastated that they were in the dance-off. Karim had to reassure her and was rubbing her back while they were waiting to perform. After they were voted through and the cameras were off them, Amy burst into tears and was comforted by fellow pro dancer Neil Jones, who kept telling her 'It's not your fault'. She seemed to be blaming herself a lot for the situation they were in."</p>

      <p>Amy put on a happy face but remained silent during the closing VT as Karim spoke about his disappointment and desire to do better next week. They weren't the only ones that were stunned - as most of the Strictly cast watched on in disblief.</p>
      <p>The source added: "A lot of the celebs and pros looked very shocked that Karim and Amy were in the bottom two. Chris and Alex, in particular, looked very worried and upset as they watched them in the dance-off from the balcony. Oti also shouted out her support and Neil mouthed 'wow' to Karim afterwards."</p>
      <p>The judges all voted to save Karim and Amy, who found their dance stronger than Saffron and AJ's samba to Walking On Sunshine by Take Me To Rio Collective. Craig Revel Horwood said it was an easy choice to save Karim and Amy, while Motsi claimed it was "the perfect performance".</p>
      <p>Agreeing with the pair, Bruno Tonioli said: “I want to keep the couple that has proven to be the strongest both technically and artistically.”</p>
      <p>While head judge Shirley Ballas confessed she would also have chosen to save Karim and Amy.</p>
      <p>Amy's life has been all about dancing since she was a little girl and <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/lifestyle/tv/strictly-come-dancing-karim-amy-17149214">she credits Strictly with keeping her love for dancing alive</a>, with Amy and her family watching it week after week and she and her sister practising the routines they had seen at the weekend.</p>
      <p>She even changed schools in 2002 because it had a new purpose-built dance studio, travelled to Blackpool for competitions and practiced any moment she could. She and sister Rebecca, who went on to become a midwife, also trained at Shappelle's Dance Studio in Ystrad Mynach. Her parents have spoken about how they <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/lifestyle/tv/strictly-come-dancings-welsh-dancer-15367289">took her all over the country for dance competitions</a>.</p>

      <p>Karim paid tribute to his mum and sister during his emotional contemporary couples choice routine. Before he took to the dance floor, Karim said: "It's about not having many people in your life but the few you do have can make you. Your dreams can come true and anything is possible."</p>
      <p>The CBBC star left viewers at home "in pieces" and ran over to hug his crying mum Carol in the audience after he had finished.</p>
      <p>Wiping away tears, Karim said: "My mum and sister are everything. Two strong women in my life. Amy represented that in the dance holding me up."</p>

      <p>Craig Revel Horwood praised Karim for his "dynamic and engaging" performance - but admitted it was not enough for a 10. He said: "I want you to fly. I'm desperate to get a 10 out for you but I'm battling with the fact your technique is overpowering what you're trying to say."</p>
      <p>Bruno disagreed and hit back at Craig, claiming he loved the "freedom of flowing movement".</p>
      <p>Motsi Mabuse said: "As a dancer I'm just amazed at what you bring to the show. Your technique is unbelievable. Those spins in the air and jumps. I love you always give 110%. To watch you is like a gift."</p>
      <p>Shirley Ballas added: "Family is everything and mums are the best."</p>
