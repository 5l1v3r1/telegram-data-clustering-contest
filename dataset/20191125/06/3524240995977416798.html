        <b>Daud Olatunji, Abeokuta</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Inspector-General of Police, Muhammed  Adamu, has approved the swapping of the  new Ogun State Commissioner of Police, Edgal Imohimi, with his counterpart in Akwa Ibom State, Kenneth Ebrimson,   a week after their redeployment.</p>
      <p>Both Imohimi and  Ebrimson were on November 15 posted to Ogun and Akwa Ibom states,  respectively.</p>
      <p> But in a dramatic manner, the duo were swapped almost a week after they had resumed duties in Ogun and Akwa Ibom states.</p>
      <p> The directive was contained in a police signal dated November 22, 2019 from the office of the Inspector-General of Police.</p>
      <p> The signal, a copy of which was obtained by our correspondent, showed that both Imohimi and  Ebrimson had been ordered to proceed to their new duty posts with immediate effect.</p>
      <p> Imohimi, in less than 24 hours after he took charge of the Ogun State Police Command, had set up a complaint call centre with 10 hotlines through which the public could  report any officer demanding bribe from them under any guise.</p>
      <p> However, attempts to get the reaction of the state Police Public Relations Officer, Abimbola Oyeyemi, failed as he could not be reached as of the time of filing this report.</p>
