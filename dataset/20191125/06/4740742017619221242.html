      <h1>Bristol City fan view: "I’d have taken a point before the start of Nottingham Forest game..."</h1>
      <h2>Was it more important to not lose a potential six-pointer?</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T06:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Matthew Withers</a></address>
      <p>Before kick-off I would have taken a point against Nottingham Forest, that wasn’t be pessimistic, I just felt it was important not to lose to a team on the same number of points as us with a better goal difference and with key absentees in Tomas Kalas and Taylor Moore.</p>
      <p>However, with how the game panned out, it’s hard not to feel that it was two points lost.</p>
      <p>Forest were the brighter side in the first half and looked better on the ball but in all honesty Dan Bentley wasn’t overly tested. With Kalas and Moore ruled out through injury, there was a recall to the starting line-up for skipper Bailey Wright.</p>
      <p>Now readers of my ramblings week in week out will know that I am not Bailey’s biggest fan but fair play to him, I thought he was excellent today and didn’t put a foot wrong, well done Skipper.</p>
      <p>Alongside him Ashley Williams was once again a colossus and making up the central three was Nathan Baker who was at his thunderous best. Wingbacks Tommy Rowe and Pedro Pereira were solid and saw plenty of the ball but perhaps failed to deliver the quality needed in the final third.</p>

      <p>Adam Nagy stayed injury free during the international break and once again started in midfield alongside Josh Brownhill and it was great to see fit again Korey Smith (legend) named as a substitute. There was also a recall for Famara Diédhiou following his suspension. </p>
      <p>After a brightish start with Nagy pulling the strings City allowed Forest to get on top and the ball was flying around the City penalty area all too frequently for my liking although as I say without overly testing Dan Bentley and when he was beaten there was Big Fam to clear one effort off the line. </p>
      <p>As would be the pattern for the game, we had enough of the ball but just couldn’t find the quality needed in the final third to create a clear opening. Andi Weimann had a long range effort that went wide but that was pretty much it for the opening 45 minutes.</p>
      <p>The second half seemed to be heading the same way but took a turn when Forest midfielder Ryan Yates was shown a straight red on 56 minutes when he jumped in two footed for a ball with Nagy.</p>
      <p>There won’t be too many complaints from the Forest fans on that one. Forest re-organised and within 10 minutes of the dismissal Lee Johnson made a couple of attacking changes withdrawing Wright and Callum O’Dowda for Kasey Palmer and Nic Eliasson.</p>

      <p>City poured forward and Eliasson sent over a number of great crosses but we just couldn’t beat Brice Samba in the Forest goal. Eliasson has to start for me at home, he is our most creative attacking player and the game only really sparked into life when he came on. City couldn’t get Palmer on the ball in the right areas and when he did pick up the ball he went for the difficult pass too often and it didn’t come off.</p>
      <p>Johnson made a last roll of the dice bringing on Rodri for Weimann and he so nearly could have won it with an overhead kick but he failed to keep it down. Forest defended manfully and their endeavors were worthy of a point. </p>
      <p>The game highlighted the need for that quality centre forward but to be fair to Andi and Fam didn’t have much quality ball into them. </p>
      <p>The five at the back worked well defensively but none of Wright, Williams or Baker are that great at bringing the ball out and too much was played along the back line. We needed to move the ball quicker into midfield and out wide.</p>
      <p>At the end of the day it’s another point earned and we are still in a really healthy position in the league but it was a missed opportunity and one that I hope like Wigan and Barnsley before doesn’t come back and bite us at the end of the season.</p>
      <p>Next up is a tough trip away to leaders West Bromwich Albion on Wednesday night. We need to be more precise with our passing and final phases and clinical when opportunities arrive.  What a prospect though, I love this league.  </p>
