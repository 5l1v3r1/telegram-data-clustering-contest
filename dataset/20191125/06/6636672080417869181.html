      <h1>OSAT market may be on the turn</h1>

        <b>The decline in the outsourced assembly and test (OSAT) industry showed signs of a gradual halt in 3Q19, says TrendForce, since the drop in memory prices began to slow down, and smartphone sales steadily recovered.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The top ten OSAT providers posted a total revenue of $6 billion in 3Q19, a 10.1% growth YoY and 18.7% growth QoQ, indicating that the market as a whole is on its way to recovery.</p>

      <p>Aside from KYEC and Chipbond’s consistently stable performance, ASE, JCET, TFME, and TSHT are also once again showing a trend of yearly revenue upswing.</p>
      <p>The industry leader, ASE, had $1.321 billion revenue in 3Q19, a 0.2% growth YoY.</p>
      <p>Under the influence of the China-U.S. trade war and fluctuations in exchange rates, ASE registered an 8.9% 1H19 decline compared to 1H18, with a double-digit YoY drop in 2Q19.</p>
      <p>However, ASE was able to stabilize its revenue performance in 3Q19 because of strong demands for 5G communications, automotive electronics, and consumer electronics packaging.</p>
      <p>With Q3 revenue of $1.084 billion, Amkor’s 3Q19 downturn was much less severe compared to 1H19, as a result of rebounding demands in the consumer electronics and automotive electronics markets.</p>
      <p>Regarding the 3Q19 revenue performance of the three major OSAT companies in China – JCET, TFMC, and TSHT – JCET maintained its status as the third largest company in the industry, after ASE and Amkor, whereas TFMC and TSHT occupied sixth and seventh place, respectively.</p>
      <p>These three Chinese companies made a poor showing in their revenue performances due to the 1H19 China-U.S. trade war and the slowdown in China’s overall economic growth.</p>
      <p>However, the magnitude of the decline has diminished slightly, with signs of positive growth thanks to ongoing improvements in the trade dispute and the uptick in demand for consumer electronics.</p>
      <p>Notably, KYEC and Chipbond delivered remarkable performances in 3Q19, with rankings of 8th and 10th place respectively.</p>
      <p>KYEC’s primary growth drivers included such packaging-related necessities as 5G communications, CMOS image sensor components, and AI chips.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, Chipbond was able to maintain its revenue growth, driven by the demand for COF and TDDI used in the LCD screens in Apple’s iPhone 11.</p>
      <p>The 10 largest OSAT companies were impacted in 1H19 by several factors, including the China-U.S. trade war, the fall in memory prices, and weak smartphone shipment numbers.</p>
      <p>However, as trade situation between China and the U.S. improves, and the year-end holiday season demand for inventory stocking kicks in, the overall market will be making a gradual recovery starting from 3Q19.</p>
      <p>TrendForce forecasts the OSAT industry to stabilize in 4Q19, but the revenue performance for 2019 as a whole will show a slight decline because of the revenue slump in 1H19</p>
