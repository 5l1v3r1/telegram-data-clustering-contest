      <h2>Economy may not go into recession, but could slow</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T06:55:16+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 06:55</time> by <a rel="author">Julia Horowitz, CNN Business</a></address>
      <p>NEW YORK - For all the chatter about a looming recession in the United States or Europe, it's important to remember: right now, forecasters don't expect the global economy to contract.</p>
      <p>Instead, we're looking at a slowdown — and there are signs it could last longer than many economists initially anticipated. The question on my mind recently: Is the successor to the Great Recession the Great Stagnation?</p>
      <p>That's certainly the warning embedded in the <a href="https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/9b89401b-en/1/2/1/index.html?itemId=/content/publication/9b89401b-en&amp;_csp_=dfa9d861509505eac6168a6630ad633f&amp;itemIGO=oecd&amp;itemContentType=book">new economic outlook</a> from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The group now forecasts that global GDP growth will sit at 2.9% in both 2019 and 2020, the lowest annual rate of growth since the financial crisis. It's expected to tick up just 0.1 percentage points in 2021.</p>
      <p>The OECD said it does not see this sluggishness as the result of one-off circumstances.</p>
      <p>From OECD chief economist Laurence Boone: "It would be a mistake to consider these changes as temporary factors that can be addressed with monetary or fiscal policy: they are structural. Without coordination for trade and global taxation, clear policy directions for the energy transition, uncertainty will continue to loom large and damage growth prospects."</p>
      <p>In the United States, growth is forecast to slow from 2.3% in 2019 to 2% in 2020 and 2021. China is expected to post 6.2% growth this year before it drops off to 5.7% and then 5.5%.</p>
      <p>In a sentence: "The global outlook is fragile, with increasing signs that the cyclical downturn is becoming entrenched," the OECD wrote.</p>
      <p>Ray Dalio is <a href="https://cnn.com/2019/11/21/economy/ray-dalio-economy-great-sag/index.html">beating the same drum</a>. The billionaire hedge fund founder told CNN Business this week that he believes the world is dealing with financial challenges on a scale not seen since the 1930s. He doesn't want to use the word "recession." But he does think the global economy is headed for what he dubbed the "Great Sag."</p>
      <p>Some Wall Street players are more optimistic. Goldman Sachs sees the drag from trade tensions evaporating next year, and thinks global GDP growth will rise from 3.1% in 2019 to 3.4% in 2020 and 3.6% in 2021. But the investment bank still thinks the "swing in the pendulum" will "remain quite gradual."</p>
