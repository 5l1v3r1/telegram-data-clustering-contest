      <h1>PM pumps $537m into improving aged care </h1>

      <p>Scott Morrison has committed half a billion dollars towards fixing problems in aged care, weeks after a royal commission investigating the scandal-prone sector released a damning interim report.</p>
      <p>The prime minister has promised $537 million to increase home care packages, reduce the use of chemical restraints and get younger people out of residential aged care.</p>
      <p>“I think there are few families around the country, my own included, who are not unfamiliar with the difficult decisions that are made about relatives and loved ones who are placed into aged care facilities,” he told reporters on Monday.</p>
      <p>“We can and must do better in providing improved support for our older Australians.”</p>
      <p>The three-pronged plan hinges on increasing the number of home care packages by 10,000 places.</p>
      <p>These will be rolled out from December, with a particular focus on people with higher levels of need.</p>
      <p>It boosts the number of places available for higher- and lower-care needs to 150,000, bringing two previously separate programs together.</p>
      <p>Labor decried the boost as merely a drop in the ocean of need.</p>
      <p>“To announce 10,000 packages when the royal commissioners have said it is neglect to have 120,000 older Australians still waiting on the home care list is simply not good enough,” opposition spokeswoman on ageing Julie Collins told reporters.</p>
      <p>“How quickly will a 95-year-old woman with a terminal illness who has been waiting for her Level 4 package get that package?”</p>
      <p>Mr Morrison said it couldn’t just be a case of throwing more places into the mix.</p>
      <p>“The system has to be able to absorb them with the training and the support to ensure that those places are delivered in a way that is safe and supportive of those Australians who need them,” he told parliament.</p>
      <p>The use of anti-psychotic medications – or chemical restraints – for dementia patients will be more strictly policed from the start of next year, including maximum time periods for how long they can be used without a doctor’s re-approval</p>
      <p>A timeline has also been set for removing younger Australians from aged care.</p>
      <p>While Monday’s measures don’t go to the financial viability of residential aged care homes, the government is this week starting a trial of a new remuneration method based on the care needs of individuals.</p>
      <p>Aged Care Minister Richard Colbeck described the existing funding model, set in 2008, as no longer fit for purpose.</p>
      <p>Aged care providers said it was critical this aspect not be neglected, saying the sector urgently needs a $1.3 billion funding injection.</p>
      <p>“The support for additional (home care) packages is a step in the right direction but there appears to have been no movement at all on the urgent risks facing residential care,” Leading Age Services Australia chief executive Sean Rooney said.</p>
      <p>The organisation says there are currently 197 providers in financial distress.</p>
      <p>The union for aged care workers said chronic underfunding in the sector couldn’t be fixed up with a bandaid.</p>
      <p>“Australia cannot wait for the final recommendations of the royal commission … for the government to act comprehensively on the crisis in this industry – particularly those older Australians dying on home care waiting lists or not receiving the care they deserve in residential facilities because of understaffing,” United Workers Union official Carolyn Smith said.</p>
