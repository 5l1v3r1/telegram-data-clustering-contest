      <p>The wife of an alcoholic has revealed how she once threw a knife at her husband after becoming enraged by his drinking.</p>
      <p>*Penny, 55, only realised her husband was an alcoholic after they married, but was more shocked by the way she reacted to his behaviour – often resorting to violence.</p>
      <p>During their marriage, she hit him over the head with a pint glass, gave him a black eye and threw a cup at him, leaving a gash in his forehead.</p>
      <p>The mum-of-one is now speaking out against her actions in the hope of encouraging others in relationships with alcoholics to seek support alongside their partners.</p>
      <p>Penny said: ‘I justified my behaviour by saying to myself that because he was hurting me mentally, the only way I could hurt him was physically. My violence got worse.</p>

      <p>‘I gave him a black eye one evening because he was saying hurtful things about my son. When he wouldn’t go to a doctor’s appointment, I threw a cup at him which gave him a cut on his head.</p>
      <p>‘I have punched and kicked him on numerous occasions, but he never retaliated. He never confronted me or tried to stop me.</p>

      <p>‘He always said when he was sober that he could understand why I had done the things I did as he wouldn’t be able to live with somebody like his drunken self.</p>
      <p>‘Each time I told myself that I wouldn’t do it again.’</p>
      <p>Penny and her husband met in a pub around 18 years ago, and she soon noticed that he was a heavy drinker, but hoped he would begin to cut back as their relationship progressed.</p>
      <p>But shortly after the couple married in June 2002, she realised his drinking wasn’t slowing down no matter how hard she tried to stop him.</p>
      <p>Penny recalled: ‘He wasn’t a nasty drunk, generally he just went to sleep. All I wanted to do was to stop him from drinking.</p>
      <p>‘I cried, threw the alcohol down the sink, pleaded with him to stop and tried to make him feel guilty about what he was doing.</p>
      <p>‘I even used his daughters against him, telling him that he would lose them and me if he didn’t stop.’</p>

      <p>Penny said her husband attempted to follow several Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) programmes, but would always relapse after several months of being sober.</p>
      <p>She found herself become angrier and angrier – and eventually he encouraged her to attend Al-Anon meetings, an organisation that supports the families and friends of alcoholics.</p>
      <p>The group helped change her attitude towards her husband, causing their life together to be more ‘manageable’, but the family later moved to Norfolk and she stopped attending.</p>
      <p>Away from the support group she lost control of her temper, and her violence soon brought the couple to rock bottom.</p>
      <p>Penny said: ‘I can clearly remember the last time I was violent towards him. We were having another argument standing in the kitchen, he turned his back on me and I picked up a knife and threw it at him.</p>
      <p>‘I couldn’t believe what I had done. I was shocked and scared, so I packed a bag and left for a few days. I didn’t even stop to see if I had hurt him.</p>
      <p>‘When I plucked up the courage to return, I noticed the blood on the bed sheets. I felt sick at the realisation that I had hurt him.</p>

      <p>‘I asked him to show me what I had done. To my horror he had a very nasty cut in his shoulder where the knife had hit him.’</p>

      <p>The incident forced Penny to seek help and she learned how to talk to her husband as ‘an equal, rather than looking down on him’.</p>
      <p>She stopped trying to make him stop drinking, no longer bought him any alcohol and wouldn’t help him phone in sick for work or book doctors’ appointments.</p>
      <p>Penny said: ‘Every night I lay in bed looking at the scars I had given him, thankful that I didn’t add to them.’</p>
      <p>According to the Home Office, around 48% of domestic abuse perpetrators have a history of alcohol dependence, while 73% were found to have consumed alcohol before their involvement in an incident.</p>
      <p>Penny has never faced charges for her violence as her husband never reported the incidents to the police. He died in in 2015 from high blood pressure caused by his drinking.</p>
      <p>Anyone concerned about their partner, friend or relative’s drinking can call Al-Anon’s free helpline on 0800 0086 811, between 10am-10pm, 365 days a year.</p>
