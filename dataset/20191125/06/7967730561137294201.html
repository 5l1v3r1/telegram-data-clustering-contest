      <h1>ASX edges higher as iron-ore strength steels miners</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T06:36:27+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 06:36</time> by <a rel="author">Lucy Battersby</a></address>
      <p>A rise in iron ore spot prices pushed up shares in Australia's major iron ore producers on Monday and helped underpin a 0.3 per cent lift in the S&amp;P/ASX 200 index to 6731.4. The steel ingredient is at four-week highs of $US84.50 per tonne thanks to strengthening Chinese steel futures.</p>
      <p>The materials sector was the best performer on the market with Fortescue Metals reaching a fresh record closing price of $9.67. Rio Tinto closed 2 per cent higher at $95.92, its highest closing price since early August, and BHP Group gained 1.7 per cent to $37.85.</p>
      <p>The market also did well thanks to Caltex leaping 7 per cent after announcing <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p53dq5.html">it will bundle up 250 petrol stations into a property investment opportunity</a>. Afterpay Touch also surged 7 per cent after releasing an independent report on its anti-money laundering compliance that found it a "low risk business".</p>

      <p>One reason steel prices are rising was an expectation US and China could be moving closer to a trade deal, which would improve China's economic activity.</p>
      <p>"China, over the weekend, announced that it would tighten enforcement, lower guilt thresholds for intellectual property [IP] theft and make it easier to seek compensation from Chinese companies accused of IP miscreance. The small print said by 2022," said OANDA's senior market analyst for Asia Pacific, Jeffrey Halley.</p>
      <p>"Although long on promise, but short on detail, China's move appears to be an attempt to mollify one of the US' main reasons for initiating the trade war in the first place. The hope being to get impetus back into the interim trade talks."</p>
      <p>However, the materials sector also contains Nufarm, which<a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p53dyo.html"> dropped 17.5 per cent to $5.08</a> after warning of a sharply weaker first-half profit. Nufarm said that “trading conditions have been difficult for 2019-20 to date and this has resulted in lower earnings in all regions for the first quarter compared to the prior year”. It expects first-half earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) to be “significantly lower than the prior year”.</p>
      <p>Gold miners also declined as the price of the precious metal remains about $US1461.47 per ounce.</p>
