      <p>After more than two decades, the mystery surrounding how three young women were snatched off the streets of Claremont in Perth's western suburbs has finally begun to unravel.</p>

      <p>Accused Claremont serial killer Bradley Edwards fronted the Supreme Court of Western Australia on Monday for the first day of his six-month triple-murder trial.</p>
      <p>The 50-year-old has pleaded not guilty to the murders of Sarah Spiers, 18, Jane Rimmer, 23, and Ciara Glennon, 27, who all vanished from the Claremont entertainment strip in the mid-1990s after a night out with friends.</p>
      <p>Lead state prosecutor Carmel Barbagallo, during her opening address to a packed courtroom, laid bare the profound impact the abductions of the women had on an entire generation.</p>
      <p>“In a 14-month period in the mid-1990s, three young, bright, beautiful women vanished off the streets of Claremont under the cover of darkness,” she said.</p>

      <p>“The very things that the killer preyed upon to effectively and efficiently abduct and murder three young women were the very things they – like many other young people – looked forward to doing; going out in Claremont to have an enjoyable night out with a few drinks in the company of friends and then making their way home safely, no matter how they chose to get home, or the darkness of the hour,” she said.</p>
      <p>“That fear was caused by an enigma of the dark.</p>
      <p>“The state over the coming months will demystify that enigma and will prove beyond reasonable doubt ... that there was one killer, and that killer is Bradley Robert Edwards.”</p>

      <p>Ms Barbagallo went on to claim the state would prove Mr Edwards – a Telstra technician who had allegedly been hiding in plain sight since the murders – was the Claremont serial killer.</p>
      <p>“Two [of the women] were found dead, dumped in bushland, covered in foliage and left to rot in the killer’s hope that they would never be found so that any evidence that might connect the killer to the crimes would be lost forever, lost in the bush, in the dirt, in the foliage that he left them in,” she said.</p>
      <p>“Despite the killer’s best efforts, miraculously the bodies of those two young women were found and the forensic connections to the accused were preserved, recovered and revealed.”</p>
      <p>The state will argue Mr Edwards’ DNA profile was found underneath the fingernails of Ciara Glennon’s left hand when her body was discovered in bushland north of Perth three weeks after her disappearance.</p>
      <p>The sample was stored and tested in 2009, 12 years later, as part of the ongoing murder investigation into the Claremont killings.</p>
      <p>It is the sole piece of DNA evidence in relation to the murders, with the state relying on common fibres found at the scenes of Ciara and Jane’s bodies which they claim match Mr Edwards’ car seats and Telstra-issued work trousers.</p>
      <p>The case against Mr Edwards in relation to Sarah’s death is circumstantial.</p>

      <p>“The third young woman has never been found. Her body having been concealed in a manner and location only known to the killer has fulfilled the killer’s hope that she would never be found,” Ms Barbagallo said.</p>

      <p>“The absence of her body does create an absence of forensic connection to the killer, but that just means that the killer’s identity can be known and proven in other ways.”</p>
      <p>Mr Edwards’ defence lawyer Paul Yovich was yet to make his opening statements on Monday afternoon, but has previously indicated he would be challenging the integrity of the DNA evidence.</p>
      <p>Family members of the three victims were in court for the first day of the trial but declined to comment to the media.</p>
