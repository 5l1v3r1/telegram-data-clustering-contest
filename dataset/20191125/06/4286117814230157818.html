      <p>Speculation is rife as to why Scindia removed references to his association with the Congress on Twitter, which has become the most potent forum for the politicians to express their views. Even a little change hint thrown on Twitter by a politician is taken seriously.</p>
      <p>Responding to such speculations, Jyotiraditya Scindia said, I don't know why is this being pulled out now. I had changed it almost a month back. That too because I was getting constant feedback that it was very long.</p>
      <p>In recent times, Scindia has made statements conveying that everything is not right between him and the Congress party. Scindia put his own party's Kamal Nath government of Madhya Pradesh in the dock on the issues of loan waiver, survey for flood relief and power cuts. This gave the BJP fresh ammunition to attack the Kamal Nath government in Madhya Pradesh.</p>
      <p>Apart from this, Scindia had also tweeted supporting the central government's move to revoke Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir creating a huge political controversy.</p>
      <p>The Congress MLAs including some of the ministers in the Kamal Nath government have been demanding that Scindia be made the president of Madhya Pradesh Congress. Following the Congress's victory in the state assembly election in 2018, Scindia supporters held protest from Bhopal to Delhi, demanding that he be made the chief minister.</p>
