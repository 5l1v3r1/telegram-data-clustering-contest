      <h1>Srinagar shops reopen, public transit increases as J&amp;K returns to normalcy</h1>
      <h2>Police said they have taken note of these incidents and several such modules have been busted by arresting several people.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T06:55:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 06:55</time> by <a rel="author">Press Trust of India</a></address>
      <p>Most of the shops in <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/srinagar">Srinagar </a>opened for a few hours on Monday and the movement of <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/public-transport">public transport </a>also increased, officials said.</p>
      <p>Shops opened at several places across the city, including in the areas around the commercial hub of Lal Chowk here, and some places elsewhere in the valley, the officials said.</p>
      <p>They, however, said most of these shops downed their shutters around the noon to join the protest against the abrogation of the special status of <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/jammu-and-kashmir">Jammu and Kashmir.</a></p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/public-transport">public transport </a>increased on Monday as intra-district as well as inter-district cabs, auto-rickshaws and mini buses plied, the officials said.</p>
      <p>There was increased movement of private cars, leading to traffic jams at several places in the city, they added.</p>
      <p>While there was a semblance of normalcy in the Kashmir Valley over the past few weeks after about three months of protest shutdown over the abrogation of <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/about/what-is-article-370">Article 370 </a>provisions, the fresh shutdown started on Wednesday last week as threatening posters warning shopkeepers and <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/public-transport">public transport </a>operators appeared at some places in the city here and elsewhere.</p>
      <p>Police said they have taken note of these incidents and several such modules have been busted by arresting several people.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, pre-paid mobile phones and all internet services continued to remain suspended since August 5 when the Centre announced the decision to abrogate <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/about/what-is-article-370">Article 370 </a>of the Constitution and to bifurcate <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/jammu-and-kashmir">Jammu and Kashmir </a>into Union territories.</p>
      <p>Most of the top-level and second-rung separatist politicians have been taken into preventive custody while mainstream leaders including two former chief ministers -- Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti -- have been either detained or placed under house arrest.</p>
      <p>The government has detained former chief minister and sitting Lok Sabha MP from <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/srinagar">Srinagar </a>Farooq Abdullah under the controversial Public Safety Act, a law enacted by his father and <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/category/current-affairs-news-national-1150106.htm">National </a>Conference founder Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah in 1978 when he was the chief minister.</p>
