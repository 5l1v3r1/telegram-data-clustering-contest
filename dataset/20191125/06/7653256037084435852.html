      <p>New Delhi: Maintaining that the BJP had the support of all 54 <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/NCP">NCP</a> MLAs to form a government in Maharashtra, the Centre on Monday asked the Supreme Court for two to three days to file a reply to the plea against the governor's decision to invite <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Devendra-Fadnavis">Devendra Fadnavis</a> to become chief minister.</p>
      <p>The Shiv Sena-Congress-NCP has filed a plea against Governor Bhagat Singh Koshiyari's decision to swear in BJP leader Fadnavis as chief minister and NCP's Ajit Pawar as deputy chief minister.</p>
      <p>The Centre told a bench comprising Justices N V Ramana, Ashok Bhushan and Sanjiv Khanna that the governor had in absolute discretion invited the largest party to form government on November 23.</p>
      <p>Solicitor General Tushar Mehta told the top court the Maharashtra governor is not supposed to conduct a roving and fishing inquiry to ascertain which party has numbers to form government.</p>
      <p>The question is, he said, can a party come and seek the court's intervention to hold floor test within 24 hours.</p>
      <p>Mehta said the governor was cognizant of the facts and the situation after poll results that had led to President's rule being invoked in the state.</p>
      <p>The apex court, after perusing Koshiyari's letter inviting Fadnavis, said it has to be decided whether or not the chief minister enjoys support on the floor of house.</p>
      <p>The solicitor general explained that the governor had invited <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Shiv-Sena">Shiv Sena</a>, BJP and NCP for government formation and President's rule was imposed only after they failed.</p>
      <p>As the hearing began on Monday morning, Mehta submitted letters of the governor and Fadnavis as asked by the bench on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The apex court said it is not considering the Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress' combine's plea that they be invited to form government in Maharashtra.</p>
