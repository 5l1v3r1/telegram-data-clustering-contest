      <h1>Investors slash $410 million off Nufarm after profit warning</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T06:21:09+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 06:21</time> by <a rel="author">Darren Gray</a></address>
      <p>Investors have punished the agricultural chemicals and seed company Nufarm after it warned that its first-half earnings were expected to be "significantly lower" than last year's, wiping $410 million off the company's value in a day.</p>
      <p>Nufarm said "substantially lower demand" for its products in North America combined with high inventories would ensure its first-quarter earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) would be about $20 million below the prior corresponding period for the region.</p>

      <p>The company said this deficit was unlikely "to be mitigated" in the second quarter of the year.</p>
      <p>Investors dumped Nufarm shares in response to the news, with the stock down as much as 19.6 per cent in the morning. When the market closed, the stock was down 17.5 per cent at $5.08, making it the worst performer on the S&amp;P/ASX 200 on the day.</p>
      <p>"Trading conditions have been difficult for financial year 2019-20 to date and this has resulted in lower earnings in all regions for the first quarter compared to the prior year," Nufarm told the ASX.</p>
      <p>With the update, Nufarm became the latest ASX-listed agribusiness to issue a profit warning, although unlike companies such as <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p5358l.html">Bega</a> and<a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p53d3m.html"> Costa Group</a>, Nufarm did not mention the word drought in its trading update.</p>
      <p>However, the company did mention a $9 million hit on first-half earnings flowing from "additional sales rebate claims from customers" relating to the already completed 2018-19 financial year.</p>
      <p>Nufarm told the market that the additional sales rebates were identified during the reconciliation of accounts with German customers for calendar 2019.</p>
      <p>"The company is undertaking an immediate review of internal control processes and procedures and will look to further strengthen these in the light of this matter," Nufarm said.</p>
      <p>Morgans analyst Belinda Moore said "it's another disappointing announcement, it's another earnings downgrade from Nufarm. Some of the conditions that they're highlighting wouldn't come as a complete surprise, given the severity of the Australian drought and what the North American operations have been through."</p>

      <p>Ms Moore said the trading update would normally be released at Nufarm's annual general meeting next month, but suggested it had "been brought forward" because of the rebates issue.</p>
      <p>Suhas Nayak, portfolio manager at Nufarm investor Allan Gray, said Nufarm's trading update reflected "a continuation of some of the difficult trading conditions that they've had over the last year and a half or so".</p>
      <p>But Dr Nayak said the discovery of the rebates was "definitely concerning, just in terms of the systems and processes they have in place".</p>
      <p>According to Bloomberg data, Allan Gray holds about 6.4 per cent of Nufarm's stock.</p>
