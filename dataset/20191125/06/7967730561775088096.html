      <h1>'I would have given it to my children': crime family member jailed for MDMA plot</h1>

      <p>A Sydney crime family member and key player in an international MDMA smuggling ring said after his arrest that he didn't believe the party drug was harmful and would have given it to his children.</p>
      <p>But since his high-profile arrest while running a health food cafe in Dubai, the hulking, tattooed Koder Jomaa has revealed his adult son, who he offered MDMA to and smoked cannabis with, is in the grips of an addiction.</p>

      <p>NSW District Court Judge Peter Zahra sentenced Jomaa to 21 years behind bars, with a non-parole period of 14 years, for trying to smuggle 200kg of MDMA into Australia as part of a global network spanning three continents in August 2017.</p>
      <p>A year after the widespread raids, which also saw the arrests of a senior customs officer and a NSW Police employee for aiding the racket, Jomaa pleaded guilty to attempting to import a commercial quantity of a border controlled drug, with an estimated street value of up to $60 million.</p>
      <p>His Sydney-based brothers, Ali and Abbas Jomaa are waiting to be sentenced after pleading guilty to a raft of charges, including entering into agreement to import tobacco with the intention of defrauding the Commonwealth, bribing a public official and dealing in proceeds of crime greater than $1 million.</p>
      <p>In sentencing, Judge Zahra said Koder Jomaa told a forensic psychologist MDMA wasn't dangerous: “it causes you to feel happy … get on with other people … it’s not like ice".</p>
      <p>“I would have given it to my children … I would have given it to my parents," Jomaa told the clinician, saying he'd read an article describing cannabis as a “non-harmful herb” and MDMA was a medication in some countries.</p>
      <p>But in a recent letter to the court, Jomaa described his previous mindset as "deluded and selfish" and his son's addiction was a catalyst to his revelation about the ruinous nature of drugs, from which he vowed to help his child recover.</p>
      <p>Of his own use, Jomaa said: "drugs provided me an opportunity to escape from my reality, suppress my emotions and numb my pain. I became addicted to that feeling".</p>

      <p>A set of agreed facts say Jomaa embarked on the plot after his brothers unwittingly put him in contact with an undercover police officer, who promised to facilitate the importation of drugs from the Netherlands to Australia for a $400,000 cut.</p>
      <p>Jomaa and the covert operative exchanged coded BlackBerry messages, met to discuss plans in Thailand, and arranged for the payment of large wads of cash near a Brighton-Le-Sands cafe and a Bunnings car park in Tempe.</p>
      <p>Australian Federal Police and their Dutch counterparts switched the illegal haul with another substance before it was shipped to Australia in June 2017.</p>
      <p>Jomaa's barrister, Tim Game, SC, argued his client was being "significantly" encouraged by the undercover officer, and there was evidence Jomaa would not have become involved if it weren't for the agent, whose participation in the scheme meant it was "doomed to failure".</p>
      <p>But Judge Zahra, said Jomaa "embraced the opportunity" and occupied "a very senior and prominent role in that organisation."</p>
      <p>"He played a central role from the initial planning stages through to the execution of the attempted importation," he said.</p>
