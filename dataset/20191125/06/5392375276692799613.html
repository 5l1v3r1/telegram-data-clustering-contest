      <p>Last month, <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/google">Google</a> unveiled its next-gen budget smart speaker dubbed Google Nest Mini along with a slew of Pixel devices. The successor to the first-gen Home Mini has now made its way to the Indian market. Earlier today, the search engine giant introduced the product to the country. Unlike the launch of first-gen speakers, the company made the device available within just a month. For those who’re unaware, the Home Mini was unveiled way back in 2017 and got its official entrance to India in Q2 2018.</p>
      <h3>Google Nest Mini: Price in India, Availability</h3>
      <p>Google Nest Mini is launched in India with a price tag of INR 4,499 (roughly $62). To recall, the first-gen Home Mini was also <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2018/04/10/google-home-and-home-mini-arrive-in-india-for-rs-9999-and-rs-4499/">introduced with same price</a> tag. Surprisingly, the successor is already up for grabs via Flipkart and Google’s online store. Furthermore, the product will also be available in the offline market through partnered retailers. You can get the smart speaker in two color options namely Charcoal and Chalk.</p>
      <h3>Specifications, Features</h3>
      <p>Google Nest Mini features the exact same design as that of its predecessor with a slight change at the back. The former now comes with a groove that can be used for wall mounting. Even though the design is the same, the internal hardware of the speaker has somewhat improved. We’re now looking at the dedicated machine learning chip packed inside. The chip features one TeraOPS of processing power. With the help of this new addition, Google was able to integrate a few of the Assistant experiences directly into the product. The Home Mini, on the other hand, makes use of the data centers for the Assistant experiences.</p>
      <p>Like the first-gen offering, the four indicators lights on the front are still present along with a microphone mute switch. There is no 3.5mm headphone jack present though. Thanks to the custom driver, the feature is claimed to offer two times the stronger bass output. For connectivity, the speaker comes with Bluetooth 5.0 and Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n/ac. Lastly, the speaker makes use of a 15W power supply and a 1.5m long cable.</p>
