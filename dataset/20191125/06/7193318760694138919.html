      <p>CLEVELAND — The distractions didn’t bother Baker Mayfield and the Cleveland Browns. The Dolphins didn’t get in their way either.</p>
      <p>Jarvis Landry caught two touchdown passes against his former team and Cleveland won its third straight Sunday, 41-24 over the Miami Dolphins in the Browns’ first game since losing star defensive end Myles Garrett to a season-ending suspension.</p>
      <p>Baker Mayfield had 327 yards passing and three touchdown passes, including one to Odell Beckham Jr., and Joe Schobert had two interceptions as the Browns (5-6) continued their climb back into the AFC playoff hunt.</p>
      <p>The lopsided win capped an emotionally complicated week for the Browns in the aftermath of Garrett being banned by the NFL for pulling off Pittsburgh quarterback Mason Rudolph’s helmet and hitting him over the head with it. That touched off a wild brawl in the final seconds of Cleveland’s 21-7 win over the Steelers on Nov. 14.</p>
      <p>Mayfield completed 24 of 34 passes, but threw his first interception in four weeks. Beckham had six catches for 84 yards, and AFC rushing leader Nick Chubb had 106 yards and scored on a 5-yard run.</p>
      <p>“When we got our chances we capitalized,” said Mayfield. “We still didn’t play good enough, but we still scored 40 points.”</p>
      <p>Mayfield feasted on a Miami secondary missing three starters. He threw TD passes to Landry and Beckham in the first quarter, and hooked up with Landry again in the second quarter as the Browns opened a 21-0 lead.</p>
      <p>Former Oklahoma kicker Austin Seibert made two field goals for the Browns, but missed a 46-yarder.</p>
      <p>Here is how other Oklahomans fared in the NFL on Sunday:</p>
      <p>Mason Rudolph, QB, Steelers (OSU), was 8 of 16 for 85 yards with one interception and benched in the third quarter.</p>
      <p>James Washington, WR, Steelers (OSU), caught three passes for 98 yards including a 79-yard touchdown reception.</p>
      <p>Sterling Shepard, WR, Giants (OU/Heritage Hall), had five catches for 15 yards and one carry for 22 yards.</p>
      <p>Joe Mixon, RB, Bengals (OU), rushed for 79 yards on 18 carries.</p>
      <p>Dede Westbrook, WR, Jaguars (OU), had eight catches for 69 yards.</p>
      <p>Chris Carson, RB, Seahawks (OSU), had eight carries for 26 yards and four receptions for 31 yards.</p>
      <p>Tyler Lockett, WR, Seahawks (Kansas State/Tulsa Washington), had one catch for 38 yards.</p>
      <p>Josh Jacobs, RB, Raiders (Alabama/Tulsa McLain), rushed for 34 yards on 10 carries.</p>
      <p>Adrian Peterson, RB, Redskins (OU), had 27 yards rushing on 10 carries and one reception for 22 yards.</p>
      <p>Blake Jarwin, TE, Cowboys (OSU/Tuttle) had three catches for 17 yards.</p>
