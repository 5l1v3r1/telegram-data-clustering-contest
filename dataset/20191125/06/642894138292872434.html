      <p>Provider of innovative, clean energy solutions, WiSolar announces the launch of its academy to train electrical engineering students, with five scholarships every session.</p>
      <p>WiSolar has grown to become one of the most sought-after providers of cleaning energy solutions across Africa. In line with the company's goal of driving the renewable energy cause and helping Africa, in particular, to harness its abundance of resources in the energy area, WiSolar has announced plans to open an academy in 2020. The planned opening of the WiSolar Academy will allow students from different parts of the continent and across the globe to learn from some of the best hands in the industry.</p>

      <p>Africa has been described as an amazing ground for solar energy due to the prolonged duration of sunlight, compared to other parts of the world. In addition to being a fertile ground for solar energy solutions and companies, the continent is also blessed with some of the best brains in the world. Unfortunately, there seems to be a disconnect in harnessing these resources for the betterment of the continent. This is where WiSolar is looking to make a difference with the launch of its academy, with early registrations already under way. "The skilled resource will enable us to build internal capabilities as we scale into our solar-as-a-service in South Africa," said Executive Director, Tonye Irims.</p>

      <p>WiSolar has been able to position itself as a leading provider of innovative solar energy solutions to meet the needs of vulnerable populations, ultimately creating healthier and sustainable communities. The launch of the WiSolar Academy further reiterates the company's goal of supporting as many people as possible to reach their full potential. In a similar vein, the company will be providing free training to five top graduating electrical engineering students every session. This will further make quality education easily accessible to students, regardless of their financial status.</p>
      <p>WiSolar currently offers a wide range of solar power solutions to its commercial and residential customers. The products and services from the company are carefully structured to meet the needs of clients, without requiring them to break the bank. "The academy will be an avenue to upskill electrical engineering graduates with a solar electricity layer," said George Mpho Moloi.</p>
      <p>Described as "the fastest growing solar energy â€‹company in South Africa", WiSolar is looking to spread its tentacles across the African continent and has recently launched the solar-as-a-service solution to serve Nigeria and South Africa.</p>
