          <p>During the fifth day of the first Test of the ongoing England’s tour of New Zealand in Mount Maunganui, New Zealand all-rounder Mitchell Santner put on display an outstanding fielding effort to dismiss England batsman Ollie Pope.</p>
          <p>It all happened on the second delivery of the 77th over when Pope’s attempt of guiding a Neil Wagner full-toss saw him walking back to the pavilion. With the loose delivery bowled outside the off-stump, Pope hit it towards the right of Santner at short cover.</p>

                <p>Santner, who is usually an agile fielder, stood tall on his reputation as he timed his dive to perfection to grab a one-handed stunner. Coming in to bat at No. 7 in the 69th over, Pope ended up scoring 6 (24) with the help of one four.</p>
                <p>As far as the 27-year old Kiwi all-rounder is concerned, he has had a stupendous couple of days. Coming on the back of his maiden Test century in a match-winning 261-run partnership alongside wicket-keeper batsman BJ Watling (205), Santner made early inroads into the English batting lineup by dismissing three batsmen last evening.</p>
