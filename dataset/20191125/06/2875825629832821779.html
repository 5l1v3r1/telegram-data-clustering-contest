      <h2>If you have a good local make sure to drop by and support them over Christmas</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T06:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/authors/joe-oshea/" target="_blank">Joe O'Shea</a></address>
      <p>At this time of year it’s important to remember a <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/pubs">pub</a> is for life and not just for <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/christmas">Christmas</a>.</p>
      <p>Yes lads, we’re about to enter peak amateur drinking time – that period of the year when your local is full of yahoos who only see the inside of a pub once a year and totally lose the run of themselves once they do.</p>
      <p>You can’t miss them – they’re either still in their office clothes or wearing a comedy Christmas jumper, trying to start a sing-song while working up the dutch courage to tell that fecker of a boss what they REALLY think of him.</p>
      <p>It’ll all end in tears, of course. But not before they ruin your night.</p>
      <p>There is also the 12 Pubs phenomenon – which is basically what would happen if those lads from ISIS were into pints. Carnage on legs.</p>
      <p>Now, there’s nothing wrong with a good session. Sometimes it’s only the prospect of one that will keep you going through the darkness (or work, as it is also known).</p>
      <p>But that 12 Pubs thing is a nightmare – a bunch of eejits you’ve never seen in your local in your life, staggering through the door while murdering Fairytale Of New York, spilling your pint and roaring in your ear.</p>
      <p>And while the publican may get a quick hit (hopefully financially and not with an inflatable reindeer) there’s every chance he won’t see these eejits for another 12 months. That’s why a great pub shouldn’t be just for Christmas. The bar industry is facing its worst times since Oliver Cromwell invaded just so he could bring in mad tough licensing laws (it’s true, a guy told me all about it in a pub the other night).</p>
      <p>My own county of Cork alone has lost more than 300 establishments since 2010. It’s the same all over the country – every street, town and village has boarded up bars. Sure, a lot of them were grim and probably didn’t deserve to cling to life. But we’ve lost a lot of good ones as well.</p>
      <p>There’s a lot of reasons why Ireland’s pubs have been closing at an incredible rate – times have changed and the days of dropping in for a few every second night are long gone.</p>
      <p>But if you have a good local make sure to drop by and support them over Christmas and let them know you’ll be seeing them over the year to come.</p>
      <p>You could even say thanks. You never know, there might be a Christmas pint in it for ya!</p>
      <h3>Why can't decorating just be tree and easy?</h3>

      <p>It’s that magical time of year where you drive to a disused industrial estate where some Hillbilly-looking lunatic with a chainsaw gouges you for 60-quid for a spruce of fir he probably lifted out of the local forest park.</p>
      <p>The Christmas tree. One of the weirder festive traditions: “Let’s kill a giant plant, stick it in the corner of the sitting room and cover it with dodgy electric lights that could possibly kill us all in our beds.”</p>
      <p>If it was up to me – the eejit who has to drag the thing home, set it up and then drag it out to some collection point later – we would have one the size of one of those Japanese bonsai yokes.</p>
      <p>But, of course, we’ll end up getting one that could have starred in Lord Of The Rings, that scrapes against the ceiling and requires advanced engineering to keep if from toppling over and killing granny.</p>
      <p>Christmas! You just gotta love it!</p>
      <h3>This week I'm loving</h3>
      <p>The neighbour who never took down last year’s lights. The long game has finally paid off.</p>
      <h3>This week I'm dreading</h3>
      <p>Having to organise the staff do.. Bah, humbug!</p>
