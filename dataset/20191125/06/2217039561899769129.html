        <b>History of a bizarre kind was made at the weekend when rival supporters taunted opponents with that eternally popular chant.</b>
      </p>
      <p>You're getting sacked in the morning.</p>
      <p>But it was sung at three different grounds, by six different clubs.</p>
      <p>First, Tottenham Hotspur's gleeful lot started on West Ham United's Manuel Pellegrini. And the unhappy Hammers joined in.</p>
      <p>At Goodison Park, Norwich City piped up to ridicule Everton's Marco Silva and the apoplectic Toffees sang in agreement.</p>
      <p>And then the glum Gunners competed with Southampton fans to tell Unai Emery not to make any training plans for the week.</p>
      <p>They're all getting sacked in the morning, apparently, but who's going first?</p>
      <h3>AWRY FOR EMERY</h3>
      <p>If the measure is how a club has fallen, then Emery has fallen furthest at Arsenal. The Spaniard was hired specifically to end the malaise of Arsene Wenger, only to extend the mediocrity.</p>
      <p>Five English Premier League games without a win are an indictment, sure, but the lacklustre nature of the performances is unforgivable.</p>
      <p>Arsenal pinched a lucky draw against Southampton, despite finishing with a front four of Mesut Oezil, Nicolas Pepe, Alexandre Lacazette and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, which is like making The Beatles play like the Teletubbies.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>

            <a href="https://www.tnp.sg/sports/football/neil-humphreys-whos-getting-sacked-morning#collapse1-oyivx">BOOKMAKERS' ODDS ON NEXT MANAGER TO BE SACKED</a>
          </h4>
          <p>• Marco Silva (Everton) : 1/3</p>
          <p>• Unai Emery (Arsenal): 5/1</p>
          <p>• Manuel Pellegrini (West Ham): 8/1</p>
          <p>• Quique Sanchez Flores (Watford): 12/1</p>
          <p>• Ralph Hasenhuttl (Southampton): 12/1</p>
          <p>• Ole Gunnar Solskjaer (Manchester United): 16/1</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>But tactical dogma may prove to be Emery's undoing. He famously said his sides play from the back, always in possession, always on the attack. His philosophy was non-negotiable, whatever the personnel.</p>
      <p>But the current personnel is a back three that includes David Luiz, who has never allowed match-day responsibilities to disturb match-day snoozes.</p>
      <p>The Brazilian's narcolepsy is contagious. Five defenders and two midfielders dozed off for Southampton's opener.</p>
      <p>Emery has the best intentions, but the worst defensive employees to execute his plan. Unless he introduces a radically different approach - i.e. stop playing from the back until he has defenders with more mobility than a line of fussball players - Arsenal are going to concede soft goals against soft opposition.</p>
      <p>The amiable Emery is going down with a sinking vessel, anchoring himself to a suicidal tactical strategy. Nice guys don't always finish last, but they definitely don't finish in the top four when they've got Luiz playing in a brittle back three.</p>
      <h3>PELLEGRINI UNDER SCRUTINY</h3>
      <p>Pellegrini, on the other hand, doesn't concern himself with the "nice guy" cliche. He presents himself as an ageing Chilean assassin coming out of retirement for one more hit.</p>
      <p>But nothing is on target. If West Ham stay on their current trajectory, they'll be relegated.</p>
      <p>After the Tottenham loss, Roy Keane pointed out that the Hammers were "rubbish, absolute rubbish, an absolute disgrace". Masochistic West Ham supporters thought Keane was being too kind.</p>
      <p>Pellegrini's winless run stretches to eight games now, but there are eight million reasons a year not to terminate his contract.</p>
      <p>But if he persists with a foolhardy 4-1-4-1 that isolates Sebastien Haller up front and overwhelms anchorman Declan Rice, then West Ham must contemplate the hundreds of millions in lost revenue from eventual relegation.</p>
      <p>Felipe Anderson's confidence has deserted him and the Hammers are lumbered with a goalkeeper whose only purpose appears to be comic relief through the festive season.</p>
      <p>Normally, the joke goes that a poor performer must have won a competition to play in the EPL. Roberto looks like he lost the competition.</p>
      <p>The Spanish goalkeeper is being punished for not being in control of his own limbs. He's already labelled the worst goalkeeper in EPL history, which feels generous.</p>
      <p>Pellegrini spent over the odds for eye-catching forwards, presumably at the insistence of West Ham's publicity-obsessed owners, without reinforcing a shambolic defence.</p>
      <p>Only his obscene salary may earn him a stay of execution.</p>
      <h3>NO SALVATION FOR SILVA</h3>
      <p>But wages won't save Silva at Everton.</p>
      <p>Patience has evaporated around Goodison Park. Silva's apparent inability to galvanise a number of starry names, despite spending heavily in the transfer market, may prove his undoing.</p>
      <p>Their 18 attempts on goal against Norwich were like a toddler's 18 efforts to beat Daddy in the playground. Feeble.</p>
      <p>Everton's attacking core has dissolved, with Theo Walcott and Gylfi Sigurdsson posing no attacking threat.</p>
      <p>The last Everton manager to fix that particular problem was David Moyes, which poses an even bigger problem for Silva.</p>
      <p>The Portuguese manager finds himself in the same position as Mauricio Pochettino last week. An obvious replacement is waiting in the wings, ready to finish off a dead man walking.</p>
