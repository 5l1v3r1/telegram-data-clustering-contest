      <p>Spencer Dinwiddie scored a game-high 30 points Sunday night for the visiting Brooklyn Nets, who withstood a furious fourth quarter rally by the New York Knicks to escape with a 103-101 victory.</p>
      <p>Jarrett Allen finished with 18 points and 10 rebounds, and Taurean Prince added 14 points and 11 rebounds for the Nets, who have won three in a row — all without the injured Kyrie Irving and Caris LeVert — to get back to .500 at 8-8. Joe Harris added 13 points, and Garrett Temple finished with 12 points.</p>
      <p>Marcus Morris Sr. scored 26 points for the Knicks, who have lost three in a row and four of five to fall into last place in the Eastern Conference at 4-13. Julius Randle scored 15 points, followed by Wayne Ellington (12) and Dennis Smith Jr. (10).</p>
      <p>The Knicks never led in the second half but mounted a late run and got within a basket four times, first on Morris’ 3-pointer with 1:54 left. Dinwiddie responded with a turnaround bank shot to extend the Nets’ lead to 98-94.</p>
      <p>Ellington then drained a 3-pointer to close the gap to 98-97.</p>
      <p>Harris scored through a double team to put the lead back to three, and Frank Ntilikina missed the potential game-tying 3-pointer from the wing with 45 seconds left.</p>
      <p>Allen hit one of two free throws with 43.3 seconds left to push lead back to four, but Randle again closed the gap to two with a dunk with 11.9 seconds remaining.</p>
      <p>Harris finally iced the game with two free throws with 6.8 seconds to go to put the Nets up 103-99, before Randle scored on a putback with 0.4 seconds to go.</p>
      <p>Dinwiddie and Temple had six points apiece during a 22-3 first quarter run by the Nets that turned a 12-7 deficit into a 29-15 lead.</p>
      <p>But the Knicks immediately responded with a 15-0 run that spanned the quarters. Smith scored the final five points and gave New York the lead with a 3-pointer exactly three minutes into the second.</p>
      <p>The Nets took the lead at 34-33 on Dinwiddie’s layup with 6:54 left. That began a 14-2 run for Brooklyn before the Knicks pulled within 52-46 at halftime.</p>
      <p>Morris scored 11 of the Knicks’ first 15 points of the second half and drained the 3-pointer that tied the score at 61-61 with 7:40 remaining in the third. Harris answered with a 3-pointer that gave the Nets the lead for good.</p>
      <p>The Nets carried an 82-72 lead into the fourth thanks to a pair of free throws by Dinwiddie with 4.3 seconds left in the third. Harris’ 3-pointer with 7:11 remaining in the game gave Brooklyn its biggest lead of the second half at 91-80.</p>
