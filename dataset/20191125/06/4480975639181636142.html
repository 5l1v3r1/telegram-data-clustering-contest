      <p>“We think there is good possibility for Japan to pursue proactive fiscal stimulus and retain a growth rate as IMF projects or even a bit higher.”</p>
      <p>“We are all watching carefully to how US-China trade talks proceed, what we hear from both sides give us some reason for cautious optimism.”</p>
      <p>“We believe that gradual, further increase of consumption tax can help Japan deal with ageing population.”</p>
      <p>“We think there is more space to, not immediately but over time, for Japan to rely more on consumption tax in funding cost of ageing population.”</p>

      <p>“We're supportive about BOJ's 2% inflation target.”</p>
      <p>“IMF's proposal on BOJ’s inflation target was made in capacity that several other central banks had started out with pointed targets, then moved to a band.”</p>
