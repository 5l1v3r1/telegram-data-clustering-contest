      <p>Never Tigere’s first-half free-kick was enough to give the platinum miners full points against the Air Force of Zimbabwe side.</p>
      <p>For FC Platinum, the win means they maintain a two-point gap between them and leaders CAPS United who won the Harare derby against Dynamos at the National Sports Stadium yesterday.</p>

      <p>Now with two games to go and the last one against CAPS United, FC Platinum need to win both matches to retain the league’s ultimate prize.</p>
      <p>Coach Lizwe Sweswe is aware that if they win their remaining matches they will retain their crown and is optimistic it can be done.</p>
      <p>“I think it was one of those games which you need three points and I think these points will take us somewhere, well-done to the boys.</p>
      <p>“What is important is to keep on winning our games, if we win the two games we are left with we will defend our title.</p>
      <p>“With this mentality, I think we have the capacity to retain the title and we need to continue working hard,” said Sweswe.</p>
      <p>For Chapungu the defeat leaves them just two points above the relegation zone.</p>
      <p>With a bit of research about the opponent, both sides should have been avoiding conceding free-kicks as the two teams are equipped with some good dead ball specialists.</p>
      <p>Chapungu conceded two dangerous free-kicks inside the opening 20 minutes, and from the resultant second one, Tigere beat Talbert Shumba hands down.</p>
      <p>Edmore Muzanenhamo had the chance to level the scores on two occasions, his first free-kick was inches over and the second one was tipped over by an alert Francis Tizayi in goal for FC Platinum.</p>
      <p>Just before the hour mark, second half substitute Ian Nyoni missed an open goal, pushing his effort wide after Tizayi was beaten by a Hillary Mugoniwa cross.</p>
      <p>Outgoing Soccer Star of the Year Rodwell Chinyengetere could have killed the game as a contest 10 minutes before full-time, but he missed an open goal with Shumba a beaten man.</p>
      <p>Chapungu coach Thomas Chinyan’anya torched a storm in the second half when he substituted Denver Mukamba — one of the best players on the pitch — and his side’s fans from the stands questioned his desire to win the match. “People can say a lot of things but the reasoning behind that substitution was that he was not tracking William (Stima) who was playing left back for FC Platinum and I wanted someone who stops the opponent up the field.</p>
      <p>“Losing at home at this stage we are now is not good, I think we dropped points unnecessarily and I think it is bad for us, but the team played well.</p>
      <p>“I am happy with our performance and we need to improve on our conversion,” said Chinyan’anya.</p>
