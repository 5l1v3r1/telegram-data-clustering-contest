      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 25): Celcom Axiata Bhd (Celcom) and Maxis Bhd have signed a memorandum of understanding to explore a potential partnership for efficient deployment of Malaysia's 5G infrastructure, further supporting the development of the nation's digital ecosystem.</p>
      <p>In a joint statement today, the telecommunications service providers (telcos) said the collaboration will also enable them to explore possible business opportunities in relation to 5G key strategic areas, to deliver the best 5G innovation to benefit the people and businesses in Malaysia as soon as the necessary spectrum is made available.</p>
      <p>Celcom and Maxis said this potential collaboration focuses on the joint deployment of 5G infrastructure, which will cover selected areas.</p>
      <p>Maxis and Celcom will still maintain their own networks and remain competitive in other areas.</p>
      <p>Celcom chief executive officer (CEO) Idham Nawawi said collaboration is the way forward for the industry.</p>
      <p>"Working with Maxis to explore a more coordinated 5G deployment in Malaysia is something we are excited about. 5G is the next evolution that will transform how people work, live and play. It will enable a more enhanced consumer experience as well as create new opportunities for consumers, students, governments and businesses alike.</p>
      <p>"Our potential collaboration will pave the way for the delivery of a world-class 5G network, on top of our existing 4G and 3G/2G networks, to every Malaysian, realising a truly digital Malaysia in the IR4.0 era," he said.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Maxis CEO Gokhan Ogut said the telcos were already sharing towers, fiber and working together on connectivity for rural areas and universal service provision (USP) projects.</p>
      <p>"This helps us save resources and accelerate rollout. With this 5G network sharing, it presents an opportunity for us to deliver more value to our customers. Such industry collaboration is important in supporting Malaysia's ambition in driving the digital economy.</p>
      <p>"The potential collaboration between Maxis and Celcom supports Malaysia's ambition in driving the digital economy and ecosystem, brings about significant cost savings and creates overall efficiency for both parties which will result in a faster rollout and better experience of 5G for consumers and businesses in the near future," he said.</p>
