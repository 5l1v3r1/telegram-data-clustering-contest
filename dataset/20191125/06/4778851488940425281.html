      <p>The spirit’s launch coincides with the unveiling of the hotel’s multi-million-pound refurbishment and re-brand as the InterContinental Edinburgh – The George.</p>
      <p>Number Nineteen is available for exclusive purchase as a bottle from the hotel, while customers can find the gin in the Printing Press Bar &amp; Kitchen and in their room’s mini bar.</p>
      <p>The brand's label has been designed to reflect the hotel's Georgian heritage, with an original map of Edinburgh’s George Street and a border that’s reminiscent of a Georgian door number.</p>
      <p>It is the second gin to be launched by the property, following No. 25 in 2017.</p>
      <p>Ray Clynick, MD and head distiller for The OroGin Distilling Co, said: “We’re really excited to launch the new Number Nineteen gin brand. The bottle looks fantastic with the design mirroring the elegance, quiet opulence and timelessness of The George.”</p>
