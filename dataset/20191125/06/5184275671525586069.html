      <h1>Bala Box Office: Ayushmann Khurrana’s Comedy Drama Chases Down 4 More Big Films</h1>
      <h2>While Bala is heading towards a strong 3rd week, it's likely to remain steady even in 4th week due to lack of strong competition in multiplexes.</h2>

      <p><b>Bala Box Office:</b> Ayushmann Khurrana, Bhumi Pednekar &amp; Yami Gautam starrer <i>Bala</i> is doing well even in the third week. The comedy film showed an amazing trend as it collected <b>1.35 crores</b> on Friday, <b>2.50 crores</b> on Saturday &amp; <b>3.22 crores</b> on Sunday taking the total business to <b>105.87 crores.</b></p>
      <p>Bala has thus moved up a few more places in <a href="https://www.koimoi.com/box-office/all-time-grossers/koimoi-top-100-highest-bollywood-box-office-grossers-since-2012/">Koimoi’s Top 100 Bollywood Grossers</a>. The film has crossed the lifetime business of <i>Bhaag Milkha Bhaag</i> <b>(103.50 crores),</b> <i>2 States</i> <b>(104 crores),</b> <i>Son Of Sardaar</i> <b>(105.03 crores)</b> &amp; <i>Ek Villain</i> <b>(105.50 crores).</b> <i>The next</i> targets of <i>Bala</i> are <i>ABCD</i> <i>2</i> <b>(107 crores),</b> Gold <b>(107.37 crores),</b> <i>Housefull</i> <i>3</i> <b>(107.70 crores),</b> <i>Sonu Ke Titu Ki Sweety</i> <b>(108.71 crores)</b> &amp; <i>Goliyon Ki Rasleela Ramleela</i> <b>(110 crores)</b> which will be chased down in next few days.</p>

      <p>While <i>Bala</i> is heading towards a strong 3rd week, it’s likely to remain steady even in 4th week due to lack of strong competition in multiplexes. New release Commando 3 will do well only in small centres.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Yami Gautam is on cloud nine after <i>Bala</i> crossed the <b>Rs 100 crores</b> mark at the box office, and she gives credit for the success of the movie to writer and director.</p>
      <p>Bala is Yami’s second <b>Rs 100 crore</b> movie of this year. Her film <i>Uri: The Surgical Strike</i>, which was released in January this year, too hit a double century at the box office.</p>
      <p>“It is the victory of writers and directors who are creating content that pushes boundaries. Every actor enjoys commercial success but in this case, I am happy that a film like ‘Bala’ is making it to the mark. It’s a validation of our choice of stories, assurance that we are doing work that’s resonating and I am genuinely excited to do more of such films. It is motivating me to go seek out more such films and create a better actor out of me,” Yami said.</p>
