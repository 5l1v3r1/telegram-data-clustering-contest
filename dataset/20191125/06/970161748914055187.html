      <p>A supermarket worker has been hailed a hero after he stepped in to rescue a baby from a house fire.</p>
      <p>Habeel Khan, 26, was on his rounds in Nottingham for Asda when he saw smoke billowing out of a house.</p>
      <p>He pulled up and saw a woman screaming that her baby was still in the house.</p>
      <p>Without a second thought he ran into the home to get the seven-week-old baby.</p>
      <p>Habeel, who has been named colleague of the year, said: ‘It was a just a normal day at work for me. I was doing my deliveries in the Stapleford area and when I pulled up and looked over to where the customer’s house was I saw loads of smoke just gushing out of a house.</p>

      <p>‘My natural instinct was to just run across to the house. I could see loads of smoke and lots of people panicking outside.</p>

      <p>‘I shouted “is everyone out of the house?” and that’s when a woman with two young children shouted “my baby; my baby’s still in the house”.</p>
      <p>‘I don’t think she had realised until then and then she ran back into the house and I went with her.</p>
      <p>‘She managed to pick up the baby from a room next to the kitchen where the fire had started, then we ran out.’</p>
      <p>He stayed with the family until firefighters and paramedics arrived then went on with his rounds.</p>

      <p>Speaking about his accolade from the Being Asda Awards 2019 he said: ‘I didn’t really think anything of it – I just thought I’d helped out, and had done a little good deed.</p>
      <p>‘I don’t think I have done anything heroic at all to be honest. Thankfully everyone was okay in the end and the family are back in the house.’</p>
      <p>Habeel’s manager Peter Smith said: ‘We know him as Smiler. He is always happy.</p>
      <p>‘He is always doing the right thing by the customer. He is an absolute asset to the team and a credit to the company.’</p>

      <p>Co-worker Claire Wilkes said: ‘Habeel doesn’t think he is a hero, but we certainly do – he’s amazing.’</p>
      <p>Bernie Drummond added: ‘Habeel’s just great and everyone loves him here. He’s just our Habeel, our hero.’</p>

      <p>Asda’s senior vice president of operations Anthony Hemmerdinger said: ‘What Habeel did was remarkable and it’s not something we would recommend that our colleagues do, however it’s clear that in this instance his instinct kicked in and he did a remarkable job.’</p>
