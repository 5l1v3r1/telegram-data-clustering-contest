      <p>NEW DELHI: Actively run <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/large-cap-funds">large cap funds</a> have been widely criticised over the past few years for their underperformance. These have lagged behind their indices, and have been trumped by low-cost index-based offerings. But after a long time, several <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/funds">funds</a> have staged a comeback.</p>
      <p>Until two months ago, the top performing fund in the large-cap category were all passive funds, barring one. Currently, six of the top 10 performers over one year are active funds. From a one-year return perspective, Axis Bluechip, BNP Paribas Large Cap, LIC MF Large Cap, JM Core 11, DSP Top 100 Equity and Canara Robeco Bluechip Equity are all placed ahead of their index-based peers from the large-cap segment. Only Axis Bluechip was holding ground until a few months ago. However, it is too early to say something, reckon experts.</p>
      <p>Experts say investors should monitor the performance for at least six months before coming to any conclusions. Kaustubh Belapurkar, director-Fund Research, Morningstar Investment Advisor, says, “Investors will have to gauge performance over a complete market cycle. Sometimes, funds can catch a wave that may not reflect the realities.” Prableen Bajpai, managing partner, FinFix Research &amp; Analytics, says, “The focus should be on staying invested during the market cycles and not on taking calls on shortterm performance.”</p>

      <p>One of the reasons why large cap funds have been struggling is the huge polarisation within the segment.</p>
      <p>Since the change in rules last year, large cap funds now have to choose from a constrained universe of eligible stocks. Within the widely tracked basket of the top 100 stocks by market capitalisation, there is not enough information asymmetry to be able to consistently pick winners from this space. Further, the mandatory benchmarking to a total returns based index—which factors in dividends in index performance—also eats into the excess return of the funds. Besides, as index fund and ETF costs continue to go down, the cost benefits over active funds will give them an edge.</p>
      <p>Notwithstanding these obstacles, experts insist that a few fund managers will continue to deliver alpha in the coming years. “There are inefficiencies in the indices that can be exploited by fund managers to generate alpha for investors,” reckons Bajpai.</p>
