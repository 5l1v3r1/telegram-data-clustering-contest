        <b>China's world No. 3 paddler Sun Yingsha won the Seamaster T2 Diamond Singapore women's final last night by pipping Japan's world No. 7 Mima Ito 4-3 (11-7, 11-3, 6-11, 7-11, 5-3, 3-5, 5-4).</b>
      </p>
      <p>It was a tight battle between the 19-year-olds at Our Tampines Hub, but Sun did enough to bag the US$100,000 (S$136,000) prize money.</p>
      <p>In the men's final, China's world No. 2 Xu Xin, 29, trounced 18-year-old Taiwanese Lin Yun-ju 4-0 (11-9, 11-5, 11-8, 11-6) in less than 24 minutes to take the US$100,000 cheque.</p>
