      <h1>The Afterpay share price jumped 7% today</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T06:06:15+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 06:06</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fool.com.au/author/trist/" target="_blank">Tristan Harrison</a></address>
      <p>The <b>Afterpay Touch Group Ltd </b><a href="https://www.fool.com.au/company/Afterpay+Touch+Group+Ltd/?ticker=ASX-APT">(ASX: APT)</a> share price was the top ASX200 performer today after announcing an update regarding its AUSTRAC audit report.</p>
      <p>Afterpay has given AUSTRAC the final audit report after the external independent auditor finished his review.</p>
      <p>The audit report included a reference to matters of historic non-compliance by Afterpay and made recommendations about Afterpay’s ongoing AML/CTF compliance. The auditor said that the non-compliance was due to incorrect legal advice.</p>
      <p>However, the auditor did confirm that Afterpay’s current program is aligned with the AML/CTF Act and that Afterpay is a low risk business in regards to its vulnerability to be used for money laundering or terrorist financing.</p>
      <p>The company also reaffirmed that it has not identified any money laundering or terrorism financing activity on its systems to date.</p>
      <p>It’s now in AUSTRAC’s hands about whether any further action will be taken. Afterpay will continue to cooperate with AUSTRAC the audit report and its general AML/CTF compliance.</p>
      <p>Whilst it wasn’t a complete victory for Afterpay, the audit report doesn’t sound as bad as it could have been.</p>
      <p>Indeed, the auditor wrote “Afterpay has a strong compliance culture, supported at the highest levels…As a result of the increased resource allocation, Afterpay’s transaction monitoring system is now effective, efficient and intelligent.”</p>
      <p>As <b>Commonwealth Bank of Australia</b> <a href="https://www.fool.com.au/company/Commonwealth+Bank+of+Australia/?ticker=ASX-CBA">(ASX: CBA)</a> and <b>Westpac Banking Corp</b> <a href="https://www.fool.com.au/company/Westpac+Banking+Corp/?ticker=ASX-WBC">(ASX: WBC)</a> have experienced, AUSTRAC is making its presence felt in the financial system.</p>
      <h3>Foolish takeaway</h3>
      <p>Any bit of good news from Afterpay is met by a sharp increase in price, so it’s not surprising to see today’s strong positive reaction. Afterpay isn’t going to make it into my portfolio, but I can see why some investors want to put it into their own portfolio after today.</p>
