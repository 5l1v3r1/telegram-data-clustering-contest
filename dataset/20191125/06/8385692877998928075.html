      <p>The Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K has a really <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/best-cell-phone-deals">great deal</a> ahead of Black Friday right now. At both Amazon and Best Buy, you can pick it up for just $24.99. That's half off of its regular price. And this is the price it is advertised to be on Black Friday. So you can beat the rush and get yours now.</p>
      <p>This Fire TV Stick 4K does, well, 4K, as the name would indicate. It's 4K and HDR, and will work with Dolby Vision on TVs that support it. Making it a really great way for people to watch Netflix in 4K HDR.</p>
      <p>With the Fire TV Stick 4K, you're going to get some really great apps to watch content. All of the big name apps that you'd expect on a streaming device in 2019. This includes Amazon Prime Video, YouTube, Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, WWE Network, ESPN, CBS All Access and much more. Just about any streaming service you can think of, is available on the Fire TV Stick 4K.</p>

      <p>With the Fire TV Stick 4K being such a small device, you can plug it in behind your TV and never even see it again. Now it does work via micro USB, but it is not a good idea to plug it into your TV for power. While that would mean less cables behind your TV dangling down to the outlet, it won't get enough power. Especially for the 4K version. The regular Fire TV Stick would probably be okay though.</p>
      <p>This is a really great stocking stuffer to pick up this year. It's small and pretty cheap. And a really great option for those that are looking to make their TV smart without having to buy a new TV.</p>
      <p>You can pick up the Fire TV Stick 4K in this deal from <a href="https://geni.us/ab2G">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/334843/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Famazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-with-all-new-alexa-voice-remote-streaming-media-player-black%2F6301667.p%3FskuId%3D6301667">Best Buy</a> by clicking the links below.</p>
