      <h1>I used to take 10% of contract sums before awarding them – Former NDC MCE confesses</h1>

      <p>Former Municipal Chief Executive(MCE)  for Obuasi, Richard Ofori Agyemang Boadi alias King Zubah has confessed that he used to take a booty of at least 10% on government contracts before he would award them while in office, <a href="http://MyNewsGh.com/">MyNewsGh.com</a> reports.</p>
      <p>According to him, he would be counted “number one” if all corrupt politicians who have let Ghana down are called out.</p>
      <p>He was contributing to discussions on Kumasi-based Angel FM’s morning show monitored by <a href="http://MyNewsGh.com/">MyNewsGh.com</a> a week ago indicating he has since learnt his lessons and would not repeat same if he was given another opportunity to serve in government and begged God for forgiveness.</p>
      <p>“I have said several times that I don’t know what the NDC and the NPP are seeking from Ghanaians, because sometimes when I sit here, I see that I’m part of the problem; let anyone who says he’s holy and not part of the disappointment by the political class to Ghanaians, let him come and say”.</p>
      <p>“May the Lord be merciful  to me and judge me according to my honesty and mischief; we will all die and face judgement as the bible says; so I, Kwesi Ofori Agyemang, I concede that of the political class who have let Ghana down, I’m the number one, I’m the first”, he confessed.</p>
      <p>The NDC Communications Team member was bemoaning the increasing corruption in Ghana and how politicians have contributed to same, citing the shoddy works that are being done by contractors.</p>
      <p>He said Ghana would not need to borrow if politicians stopped their corrupt deals.</p>
      <p>“May God punish me if I say I never took 10% of contract sums; I have taken some before. And that does not permit us to check contractors even if we see them doing shoddy works because by that time, your finger will be in his mouth”, he revealed.</p>
      <p>He also mentioned how some contractors aid people to become MMDCE’s and later lay claim to contracts, the reason he said “sole sourcing and restrictive tendering” are rife in government procurements.</p>
      <p>“Some people were teachers, I was a radio presenter before becoming a chief executive and the assembly members would take money before endorsing you; then a contractor will say I’m helping you so he will give you about 2 billion to share it to the assemblymen, but he is not Father Christmas; it is not a gift, he would be looking up to you for something later when you win”.</p>
      <p>Zubah said the only way to deal with corruption in Ghana and uproot it from our body politic is for the NPP and NDC to sit down and deliberate to chart a common course by putting Ghana first.</p>
