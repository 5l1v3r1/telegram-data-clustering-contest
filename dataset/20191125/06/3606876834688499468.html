      <p>Police at Kenyanya station are at pains to explain how a suspect went missing from their custody.</p>
      <p>Ex-CDF official at Bomachoge Borabu Constituency in Kisii County <b>Samuel Nyandika Onchera </b>was in <a href="https://www.pulselive.co.ke/bi/politics/kenyan-university-students-launch-campusmetoo-movement-to-end-sexual-harassments/7pzkgbr">police custody for assaulting a student</a>.</p>
      <p>Onchera was arrested among two other suspects after a video went viral online of them assaulting the student <b>Anthony Machoka</b> outside Bomachoge Borabu Constituency development offices.</p>
      <p>Reports have intimated that Onchera vanished from police custody on Wednesday night under unclear circumstances.</p>
