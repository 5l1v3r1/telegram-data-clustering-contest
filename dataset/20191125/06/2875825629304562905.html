      <p>Fuming fans had vented their frustrations on social media as they labelled the trial "impossible" and "completely out of order".</p>
      <p>"That last trial on I’m a celeb was IMPOSSIBLE <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/imacelebrity?src=hashtag_click">#imacelebrity</a> ," one fan wrote, leading the troops.</p>
      <p>"Thought the last game on I'm a celeb was apart from being impossible in the time was unfair. Must have a sporting chance at these trials surely."</p>

      <p>"That trial on I’m a celeb was honestly close to impossible completely out of order tbh."</p>
      <p>"Actually so angry at I’m a celeb that last trial was impossible i better tune in tomorrow to them saying they gunna give them their roast dinners."</p>
      <p>During the fresh Love Island-themed trial, James Haskell and Roman Kemp got no stars for camp when they battled the critters.</p>
      <p>Three stars had been up for grabs which would have been the last three roast dinners for camp on Sunday.</p>

      <p>James was tasked with unscrewing the stars from three boxes with different insects and crabs in them.</p>
      <p>Chloe Madeley's husband then had to pass them over to Roman who was led in bed next to him.</p>
      <p>The radio presenter had to screw those stars into the boxes next to him, filled with the same nasty surprises.</p>
      <p>James Haskell had furious words with the presenters after they managed to get no stars on that part of the task.</p>
      <p>He hit out: "What was it? It was the very fact there was a giant crab in the way that you wanted me to carefully caress in a different direction as I tried to unscrew a star in its face."</p>
      <p>Dec responded: "Ooo someone's getting prickly."</p>
