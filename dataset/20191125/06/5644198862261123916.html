      <h1>Commentary: How top firms raise successful leaders? By giving them sabbaticals</h1>

      <p>Packing senior leaders off can also help those left behind: people filling in can prove their worth in ways that are otherwise impossible, says the Financial Times' Pilita Clark.</p>
      <p>LONDON: At the age of 55, Silicon Valley’s Marc Benioff has accumulated a wife, multiple homes, 36,000 employees, a net worth of nearly US$7 billion and a ridiculously long list of accolades. </p>
      <p>The founder of the Salesforce software company has been named the decade’s top innovator (by Forbes), one of the world’s greatest leaders (Fortune) and one of the best-performing chief executives (Harvard Business Review).</p>

      <p>But back in 1996, Mr Benioff was lying in bed in San Francisco with no will to get up, feeling lost. </p>

      <p>He had a brilliant job at the Oracle software giant, where he was the group’s youngest ever vice-president. He drove a fast car. He had a big salary. </p>
      <p>But he was so out of sorts that his boss, Oracle’s co-founder, Larry Ellison, told him to do something baffling: take three months off on a sabbatical.</p>
      <p>
        <b>TAKE A BREAK</b>
      </p>
      <p>“I didn’t really know what the word ‘sabbatical’ meant,” Mr Benioff wrote in his new book, Trailblazer. </p>
      <p>He took off to India where he came up with the seeds of the idea for his own company. </p>
      <p>By 1999, he had started Salesforce and begun his relentless march to tech triumph. </p>
      <p>That puts Mr Benioff in an interesting club of successful people I keep coming across who, at a reasonably important point in their careers, have left their striving peers behind and headed off to see the world.</p>

      <p>Few match Yngve Slyngstad, the outgoing boss of the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund. </p>
      <p>Last month, the 57-year-old unexpectedly announced he would step down as chief executive of Norges Bank Investment Management, the manager of Norway’s US$1 trillion oil fund, which quintupled in size during his 12 years in charge. </p>
      <p>But what he did before joining the fund was more surprising. First, he completed four masters degrees, in law, economics, political science and business management. </p>
      <p>Then, he went on a four-year road trip that took him from Patagonia to Alaska and from Alexandria to Cape Town. </p>
      <p>Then, my favourite part, he spent six months by himself in a cabin in the Arctic studying German philosophy.</p>

      <p>Dame Inga Beale also took a detour on the way to being named the first female chief executive in the 300-plus year history of Lloyd's of London, in 2013. </p>
      <p>She had started working in the insurance industry in the early 1980s but soon tired of being the only woman in a team of 35 underwriters. </p>
      <p>In 1989, she took off for the best part of a year to backpack around Asia and cycle around Australia, returning to begin her climb to the top job at Lloyds, a post she held for five years.</p>

        <b>CRACKING PACE OF WORK</b>
      </p>
      <p>It is hard to say how many business people belong to the sabbatical club, successful or otherwise. I am probably prone to noticing them because, to the horror of my parents, I spent three years between high school and university picking tomatoes, renovating sailing boats and working on building sites in far-flung bits of Australia. </p>

      </h3>
      <p>Obviously, I never went on to reach the peaks scaled by the likes of Mr Benioff and co, who are all about the same age as me. I doubt the break did me much harm, though I am not sure I would do it again. </p>
      <p>The world of work has changed beyond recognition and there is abundant evidence of successful people who have worked at a cracking pace all their lives.</p>
      <p>
        <b>RESEARCH SHOWS A BREAK HELPS</b>
      </p>
      <p>Yet I am always pleased to hear of research suggesting sabbaticals are beneficial for both employers and workers. </p>
      <p>Because these breaks have traditionally been most prevalent in academia, researchers have often studied professors who, unsurprisingly, report returning to work refreshed and happier than colleagues left at the grindstone. </p>

      <p>Other research, on non-profit groups, suggests that packing senior leaders off can also help those left behind: people filling in can prove their worth in ways that are otherwise impossible.</p>
      <p>Despite this, the number of companies offering extended leave has not grown much since McDonald’s offered one of the first US corporate sabbatical schemes in the 1970s. </p>
      <p>Only about 15 per cent of US employers offer sabbatical leave, according to a 2018 survey by the Society for Human Resource Management, and most of that is unpaid. </p>
      <p>I wish that number were higher. Sabbaticals need not last four years, nor involve Arctic cabins or tomatoes.</p>
      <p>But any employer who can offer them will always be a step ahead of the rest.</p>
