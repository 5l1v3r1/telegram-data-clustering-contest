      <h1>Can a female sex offender ever work again? A convicted Australian teacher speaks out</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T06:20:05+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 06:20</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/author/denise-cullen/" target="_blank">Denise Cullen</a></address>
      <p>It began innocently enough. He asked her for help with his maths homework.</p>
      <p>Some stolen glances followed. The casual brush of skin on skin.</p>
      <p>Before long, Australian high school teacher Natalie* was sleeping with her teenage student.</p>
      <p>The sex took place several times over two months – in his home, hers, at the school.</p>
      <p>Natalie’s victim was aged just 15.</p>
      <p>This was no innocent dalliance: It was a serious crime.</p>
      <p>The disgraced teacher now claims she was depressed, and craving love, after her marriage broke down.</p>
      <p>“What I did was wrong,” she told <i>The New Daily</i>.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t tell a soul. I felt so much shame and guilt.”</p>
      <p>The boy bragged about the relationship to his mates, but no one alerted authorities at the time.</p>
      <p>Almost five years later, the victim went to the police.</p>
      <p>Natalie was arrested, charged, and convicted – after pleading guilty – of indecent assault and three counts of aggravated sexual intercourse.</p>
      <p>The aggravating factor was that the victim was under Natalie’s authority, and that she was his school teacher.</p>
      <p>In his sentencing remarks, the judge noted that the boy “may well have been viewed as a willing participant, if indeed not an enthusiastic participant”.</p>
      <p>However, due to his age, the 15-year-old “had no consent to give”.</p>
      <p>The victim, by then a young man, read an impact statement in court, saying how Natalie “made me feel excited and powerful”.</p>
      <p>But, he explained, “as I matured I felt ashamed, angry, guilty and confused”.</p>
      <p>Knowing she was facing a prison sentence, Natalie took a self-defence course while on bail.</p>
      <p>She feared she would be a target for violent offenders.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t know what to expect from other women, let alone how I would handle it. My lawyer told me, ‘Keep your head down and do your time’. But what does that mean?” she said.</p>
      <p>Natalie has done her “time”.</p>
      <p>But, she said, she feels like she continues to be punished.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>The convicted criminal said she is speaking out about her experience after leaving prison to highlight that female sex offenders need help to reintegrate into the community.</p>
      <p>She said she has been trying to rebuild her life after being released on parole but has no idea how to return to normal.</p>
      <p>“Every day I wake up, it’s in the back of my mind: ‘You are a sex offender’. I don’t define myself by that, but it’s always there because of the barriers,” she said.</p>
      <p>Natalie had been in education for 27 years.</p>
      <p>Her conviction means she has been barred from teaching, but she said she feels locked out of the employment market altogether.</p>
      <p>“Even applying for jobs was frightening, because I’d have to tick the criminal history box,” she said.</p>
      <p>Natalie has retrained and has started running mental health programs to adults.</p>
      <p>That hasn’t been easy.</p>
      <p>One accrediting organisation for one program abruptly introduced a requirement that Natalie provide a Working with Children check.</p>
      <p>So, even though she wasn’t working with children, that role fell apart, too.</p>
      <p>She subsequently learned that the organisation introduced the check after an anonymous caller, claiming to be a journalist, threatened to publish a scoop about the sex offender on its payroll.</p>
      <p>“I can’t tell you how many times this has happened,” Natalie said.</p>
      <p>“I’m doing everything a rehabilitated person is expected to, but I’m constantly forced to look back instead of forward.”</p>
      <p>Natalie continues to deliver mental health courses.</p>
      <p>Having had anorexia nervosa in her teens, she also mentors adults with eating disorders.</p>
      <p>Her family members and friends have stuck by her, but other barriers remain.</p>
      <p>Church became a no-go zone after she was warned she will be charged with trespass if she ever attends a service again.</p>
      <p>Her placement on the sex offenders’ register means she must tell police every time she changes her job, car or email address.</p>
      <p>She must seek permission to travel overseas.</p>
      <p>Although not required to do so, Natalie tends to disclose her criminal history to new contacts “as I fear if I don’t, these anonymous phone calls will continue to sabotage (my efforts).”</p>
      <p>Natalie said her story demonstrates the hurdles to reintegration that offenders face – especially those convicted of sexual offences.</p>
      <p>For while rehabilitation is supposed to be a core function of imprisonment, it’s increasingly taking a back seat to ‘tough on crime’ initiatives such as sex offender registration programs and preventive detention regimes where people are locked away not as punishment but so that can’t offend.</p>
      <p>Clinical and forensic psychologist Dr Katie Seidler said it is almost impossible for sex offenders to start afresh.</p>
      <p>“We demand that offenders take responsibility for their actions, seek to make amends, and engage in offence-focused treatment,” Dr Seidler said.</p>
      <p>“(Natalie’s) is a case where she has done all these things and the barriers that she has come up against are constant and almost insurmountable.”</p>
      <p>Dr Seidler said current policies failed to distinguish between offenders’ different levels of risk.</p>
      <p>“The reality is that female sex offenders have between a 1 and 3 per cent chance of reoffending – this is almost non-existent,” she said.</p>
      <p>“There is no grounds in reality or risk to limit (Natalie’s) involvement with the community in this way.”</p>
      <p>Natalie is now planning her next career move – but is preparing for rejection.</p>
      <p>“Being shut down all the time has affected my motivation to the point that I sometimes think, ‘Why bother trying?’” she said.</p>
      <p>“It’s like people don’t believe that you can rehabilitate, or are dissatisfied with the price I’ve paid.</p>
      <p>“It’s pretty disheartening and makes me feel shameful, but not for as long as I used to.</p>
      <p>“Because if I stay in that spot, it’s a pretty dark place to be.”</p>
      <p>* Natalie cannot be identified for legal reasons. <i>The New Daily </i>has chosen not to identify her home state or specific details of the case, to further protect the victim’s identity</p>
