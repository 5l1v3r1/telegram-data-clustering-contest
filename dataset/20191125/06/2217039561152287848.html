        <b>Dear Hello Kitty,</b>
      </p>
      <p>We need to talk (even though you don't have a mouth).</p>
      <p>More than a week ago, the plastic food carrier made up of your big head sold out at McDonald's.</p>
      <p>People who are aware of my relationship with you asked me whether I got mine.</p>
      <p>I have a confession to make - I didn't queue up for it.</p>
      <p>It was a weird feeling at first, not wanting to buy McDonald's latest promotional novelty.</p>
      <p>I mean, I even ordered the McDonald's pyjamas last month even though I haven't worn pyjamas since my mother stopped buying them for me.</p>
      <p>I decided to skip your carrier because I already got the McDonald's My Melody food holder last December.</p>
      <p>I tried to sell My Melody for $1,001 on Carousell and someone actually offered to buy it.</p>
      <p>I waited at Braddell MRT station for half an hour, but no one showed up and the person stopped replying to my messages.</p>
      <h3>EVIL</h3>
      <p>I couldn't believe anyone could be so evil as to lead me on like that. Faith in humanity destroyed.</p>
      <p>This is how Carouhell became a billion-dollar company?</p>
      <p>But I guess it was my own fault for stupidly thinking anyone would pay $1,001 for something you can now get for maybe 10 bucks.</p>
      <p>So the My Melody holder is still in a box gathering dust at home.</p>
      <p>Along with my McDonald's SG50 Hello Kitty Collector's Set, which includes six plushies.</p>
      <p>And my SingPost SG50 Hello Kitty Plush Collectible Set, which has five toys.</p>
      <p>And my six-piece McDonald's Hello Kitty Bubbly World collection, which I bought in 2014.</p>
      <p>And the 40th anniversary Hello Kitty Run medal I got the same year.</p>
      <p>I wore the Hello Kitty Run T-shirt to my first death metal concert recently. (Cryptopsy rules!)</p>
      <p>But apart from the T-shirt, all the other stuff is pretty much useless.</p>
      <p>Am I actually going to use the My Melody food holder to hold my food? Not if I can't even bear to take it out of the box.</p>
      <p>They're all just sitting there, competing for space with my Star Wars merch, Marvel merch and 125 pairs of running shoes in the Choa Chu Kang flat I share with three other people, also known as my family.</p>
      <p>Marie Kondo would commit seppuku if she saw the way I live.</p>
      <p>So when McDonald's announced that Singapore would be the first country where your carrier would be launched, I said no, thanks.</p>
      <p>I don't know where I found the strength.</p>
      <p>Initially, there was a fear of missing out. But now, just over a week later, no one cares.</p>
      <p>And I realised I don't have to waste money on every overhyped piece of dreck with your face on it to be happy.</p>
      <p>You no longer spark joy.</p>
      <p>I'm sorry to say it's over between us. We had a good run.</p>
      <p>Please don't be sad (not that anyone can tell whether you are since you have no facial expression whatsoever).</p>
      <p>You still have millions of real fans, unlike ironic bandwagon jumpers like me.</p>
      <p>It's not you. It's meow.</p>
      <p>If you really must know, yes, there is someone else.</p>
      <p>I would die for Baby Yoda.</p>
      <p>Goodbye, Kitty.</p>
