      <h1>EUR Futures: scope for extra losses</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T06:36:10+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 06:36</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fxstreet.com/author/pablo-piovano" target="_blank">Pablo Piovano</a></address>
      <p>Open interest in EUR futures markets rose by nearly 1.5K contracts on Friday according to preliminary readings from CME Group. In addition, volume increased by around 19.1K contracts, extending the erratic performance.</p>
      <h3>EUR/USD targets 1.10 and below</h3>
      <p>Fridayâ€™s negative price action in <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/currencies/eurusd"><b>EUR/USD</b></a> was on the back of rising open interest and volume, leaving the door open for extra losses in the near-term. That said, a test of the 1.10 neighbourhood and probably below remains well on the cards in the short-term horizon.</p>
