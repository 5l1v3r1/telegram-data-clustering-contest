      <p>That’s deflating news.</p>
      <p>Gusty winds forecast for the city on Thursday may ground the popular giant balloons for the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade.</p>
      <p>“It looks shaky for the balloons,” said Accuweather senior meteorologist Steve Wistar.</p>
      <p>Wistar said a strong cold front will pass through the area Wednesday evening, setting up the stage for howling winds and cool conditions on Thanksgiving.</p>
      <p>Sustained winds over 23 mph and gusts surpassing 34 mph would, under city regulations, cancel the large inflatables.</p>
      <p>Thursday’s anticipated conditions will be flirting with those thresholds, with sustained winds of 12 to 25 mph and peak gusts up to 40 mph, Sistar said.</p>
      <p>Although windy, paradegoers are expected to be greeted with sunny, albeit chilly, conditions. Temperatures will remain in the 40s for the entirety of the parade.</p>
      <p>If Thursday’s Thanksgiving Day Parade balloons are nixed, it would be the first time the city has grounded them since 1971.</p>
      <p>The regulations were put in place in 1998 — a year after a woman was left in a coma when a powerful gust of wind caused the Cat in the Hat balloon to strike a streetlight, which fell and hit her head.</p>
