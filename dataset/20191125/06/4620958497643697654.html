      <p>Afternoon Tea is always a little magical at the Fairmont Hotel Vancouver, thanks to their ever-changing themed and decadent offerings.</p>
      <p>While in the past they’ve made merry during the year with tea service <a href="https://www.vancouverisawesome.com/2019/05/22/80th-anniversary-afternoon-tea-hotel-vancouver-2019/">inspired by the hotel’s history</a>, fairytales, vintage Hollywood, and even recently <a href="https://www.vancouverisawesome.com/2019/07/26/afternoon-tea-window-display-fairmont-hotel-vancouver/">serving it up in their own front window</a>, for the holidays this year they’ve got a whimsical Nutcracker-themed tea.</p>
      <p>Taking their cue from the beloved Christmastime classic about a girl and her whirlwind journey of the imagination after receiving a special nutcracker toy, Notch8 Restaurant will take guests into a magical land of sweets, complete with holiday decor and themed eats and treats.</p>
      <p>The themed food is served on a Christmas tree tea tier, and includes a seasonal fruitcake scone, sandwiches based on Nutcracker characters like Clara (duck confit, umeboshi plums, crepe, scallion, and “ink lace”) and Drosselmeyer (mustard orange honey turkey, stuffing, brussel sprout leaves and smoked cranberry) just to name a couple.</p>
      <p>For sweets fans, Notch8’s pastry chefs have got some treats in store, like the ‘Nutcracker Prince’ (Christmas cake chestnut drum), ‘The Ballerina’ (Victoria sponge on a speculoos cookie with raspberry cream) and, ‘The Soldier’ (peppermint patty covered in dark chocolate), among others.</p>
      <p>Notch8 always goes all-out for Afternoon Tea, and you’ll likely leave with some leftovers to nibble on later. Plus, you’ll be enjoying your choice of Fairmont’s Lot 35 Tea by the pot (kids may request hot chocolate). In fact, there is a pared-down Children’s Tea available, as well as tweaks to the offering based on dietary restrictions (vegetarian, vegan, or gluten-free) that must be noted with your reservation in advance of your arrival.</p>
      <p>Reservations are strongly required. The Nutcracker Afternoon Tea launched on November 21 and runs through December 31 (excluding Dec. 24-25), with daily sittings at 11 a.m., 1 p.m., and 3 p.m.</p>
