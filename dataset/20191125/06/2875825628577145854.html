      <h1>One in five a financial abuse victim - but many still don't think it could happen to them</h1>
      <h2>A total of 20% of Irish adults have been affected, a new public awareness campaign has highlighted</h2>

      <p>One in five adults has been the victim of financial abuse - but many pensioners still do not think it could happen to them.</p>
      <p>A total of 20% of Irish adults have been affected, a new public awareness campaign reveals today.</p>
      <p>As part of this, 10% say someone has used their property or possessions without permission.</p>
      <p>Up to 8% said a working adult who is living with them refused to contribute to household bills, while 6% said someone was making decisions about their money without consulting them.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, 4% of those who took part in the RED C survey, commissioned by the Banking &amp; Payments Federation Ireland (BPFI), had money taken from a joint account without their agreement.</p>
      <p>The public awareness campaign launching today is led by BPFI in partnership with Safeguarding Ireland.</p>
      <p>It hopes to highlight the need for greater awareness of the real risks of financial abuse and calls on all adults to plan ahead to in order to safeguard their finances.</p>
      <p>The call comes as 43% of those surveyed reveal they are not concerned about experiencing financial abuse in the future - with older people the least concerned about the issue.</p>
      <p>And just 37% of those over the age of 55 said they were concerned that financial abuse could affect them.</p>
      <p>Financial abuse is defined as the unauthorised and improper use of funds, property or any resources including pensions or other benefits.</p>
      <p>Through this type of abuse, a person is deprived of control of their finances or personal possessions, or exploited financially.</p>
      <p>Steps to protect yourself against financial abuse include understanding and organising your day-to-day banking, checking your bank accounts regularly and ensuring that only you or someone you trust has access to your money.</p>
      <p>BPFI Head of Sustainable Banking Louise O’Mahony said financial abuse is happening at a much higher rate than many people realise.</p>
      <p>She said: “Too many adults, particularly older people, aren’t concerned and think it won’t happen to them.</p>
      <p>“We all need to prepare for the likelihood that one day we may need help managing our affairs due to a serious illness, accident or aging.</p>
      <p>“People should ‘have that conversation’ with someone they can trust and plan ahead for the future of their finances in order to protect themselves from financial abuse.”</p>
      <p>The chairwoman for Safeguarding Ireland, an NGO that advocates for vulnerable adults, stressed the importance of planning ahead to avoid financial abuse.</p>
      <p>Patricia Rickard-Clarke said: “When people don’t have their choices, preferences and decisions legally stated and have a life-changing accident, become seriously ill, or frail due to age they are reliant on the honesty of friends and family.</p>
      <p>“Safeguarding Ireland encourages all adults to talk about their wishes, plan ahead and avoid financial abuse.”</p>
