        <b>I'm A Celebrity turned seriously awkward last night as Ant and Dec clashed with James Haskell over the live trial.</b>
      </p>
      <p>I'm A Celebrity 's Declan Donnelly and James Haskell snapped at each other at the end of last night's live trial, which was Love Island themed.</p>
      <p>The I'm A Celeb 2019 presenter asked James how he found the task after they had completed it.</p>
      <p>However, James clearly thought that the trial had been unfair, as they'd had to unscrew caps with hard crabs in only 60 seconds, making it very difficult.</p>
      <p>He said: "What was it? Probably that there was a giant crab in the way for me to carefully caress in a different direction while I was trying to unscrew it in another direction?"</p>
      <p>Declan replied: "All right, somebody is getting a bit prickly."</p>
      <p>The conversation quickly moved on, but the awkward exchange was noticed by viewers, as one wrote: "Oooo james getting a bit a***y with Ant and Dec."</p>
      <p>Another added: "Who does James think he is talking to Dec like that?"</p>
      <p>A third chipped in: "James (huge rugby player) having a go at Dec (vertically challenged national treasure) was one of the funniest things I’ve ever seen."</p>
      <p>But other viewers were quick to point out how hard the last task had been, and some speculated it had been engineered to be difficult to make sure some people wouldn't get a roast dinner.</p>
      <p>One fan wrote: "Dec saying 'that was unlucky' no mate that last trial was f***ing impossible, 90seconds is a joke.</p>
      <p>"Clearly a set up so some don’t get the roast dinner - at least make it less obvious."</p>
      <p>Another agreed: "The last trial was designed to fail. Shame on Ant and Dec."</p>

      <p>A third chipped in: "That final challenge looked so difficult, there’s no way you could unscrew those stars with a crab in the way due to its hard shell, me think Ant and Dec rigged it so not everyone would get a roast dinner!"</p>
      <p>James had been losing his temper earlier in the show, as he clashed with comedian Andrew Maxwell and Kate Garraway.</p>
      <p>The rugby player argued with Andrew during the Dingo Dollar trial, as they clashed over which option to go for.</p>
      <p>He also got annoyed when Kate asked if some of the men should be put further up the pecking order for who got their roast dinners first after the trial.</p>
      <p>Looks like things are getting tense in the jungle...</p>
      <p>I'm A Celeb continues tomorrow at 9pm on ITV.</p>
