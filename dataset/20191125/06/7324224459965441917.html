      <p>Shania Twain brought the curtain down on the American Music Awards with a career-spanning medley of her best-known songs.</p>
      <p>The Canadian singer-songwriter took to the stage after Taylor Swift – now the most successful artist in AMAs history – picked up her prize for artist of the year.</p>

      <p>Wearing a pink gown and strumming a glittering guitar, Twain, 54, sang small portions of some of the biggest songs of recent years, including Swift’s Shake It Off and Drake’s God’s Plan.</p>
      <p>She then launched into the medley of her own tracks, beginning with her 1998 hit You’re Still The One and following it up with Any Man Of Mine.</p>
      <p>Twain had the star-studded crowd, including a delighted Post Malone, on their feet for Don’t Impress Me Much before closing the show with Man, I Feel Like A Woman as confetti rained down.</p>

      <p>It was Twain’s first AMAs performance since 2003. She was among a female-led slate of performers during Sunday’s ceremony, where Swift was the big winner on the night with six gongs.</p>
      <p>Lizzo, Camila Cabello, Billie Eilish and Selena Gomez also performed.</p>
      <p>Twain, a five-time Grammy winner, has sold more than 100 million records, making her one of the most successful musicians ever.</p>
