      <h1>Clemson storms back to force OT, take down TCU</h1>

      <p>A 15-0 run to close out regulation carried Clemson into overtime, and Al-Amir Dawes made the go-ahead 3-pointer to down TC, 62-60 on Sunday night in an MGM Main Event semifinal in Las Vegas.</p>
      <p>The Tigers (5-1) fell behind 52-37 on a R.J. Nembhard lay-in with 7:39 remaining. TCU did not score again for the rest of the half, as Clemson capitalized on a variety of Horned Frogs misses and turnovers to chip away at the deficit.</p>
      <p>TCU (4-1) had an opportunity to break the 52-all tie with four seconds remaining. But Desmond Bane — who scored 17 points — missed a pair of free throws. Kevin Samuel’s block of Aamir Simms on the other end as time expired capped a wild finish to regulation.</p>
      <p>TCU broke the run with a free throw to open the overtime scoring, but Clemson quickly responded as the extra frame was back-and-forth throughout. The Tigers had their own chances to close out the Horned Frogs after Dawes’ 3-pointer gave Clemson a 61-60 lead with 93 seconds left, but missed four straight foul shots.</p>
      <p>Tevin Mack ended the streak of misses when scored the last of his game-high 22 points by making 1 of 2 free throws with a second to play to close out the game. Mack made five 3-pointers on the night and grabbed nine rebounds.</p>
      <p>Simms finished with a double-double for Clemson — 13 points and 12 rebounds — and flirted with a triple-double with seven assists.</p>
      <p>John Newman III added nine points for the Tigers, with Dawes scoring eight.</p>
      <p>TCU built its lead scoring 18 points off Clemson turnovers, and on Edric Dennis’ hot hand behind the 3-point line. He scored a team-high 18 points, shooting 5of 12 from behind the arc. Samuel recorded a double-double with 11 points and 10 rebounds.</p>
      <p>TCU pushed its lead back to four points in overtime on the last of Dennis’ 3-pointers with 2:40 to play, but went scoreless the rest of the way. Dennis’ attempt at a game-winner in the closing seconds caromed off to teammate Jaire Grayer, who missed the put-back and set Mack up for the free throw that sealed the game.</p>
