      <h1>Man acquitted of Russell Street bombing makes bid for bail on abduction, rape charges</h1>

      <p>A man acquitted of the Russell Street bombing has made a new bid for bail on charges he raped two teenagers in the 1980s, by claiming prison has worsened his mental health and his teenage son struggles without him.</p>
      <p>Peter Komiazyk is accused of being part of the attacks on the teenagers, who were separately grabbed off Melbourne streets, forced into a car, blindfolded, assaulted and driven to a location where they were repeatedly raped.</p>
      <p>One victim was 18 years old when she was abducted from South Yarra in November 1985. The second victim, aged 19, was grabbed off a Nunawading street in March 1986. Both were showered and blindfolded when they were released. The first victim died in 2008.</p>
      <p>Police alleged three men were involved in the attacks.</p>

      <p>In the hours after the second teenager was released, on March 27, 1986, a bomb concealed inside a Holden Commodore parked outside Melbourne's Russell Street police complex exploded. Constable Angela Taylor, 21, was killed and 22 people were injured.</p>
      <p>Mr Komiazyk, 62, stood trial over the bombing and was acquitted.</p>
      <p>Melbourne Magistrates Court heard police have built a strong case against him on 38 charges over the abduction and rapes through improved DNA technology.</p>
      <p>The charges include abduction by force and aggravated rape.</p>
      <p>Mr Komiazyk was arrested and remanded in May, but on Monday made a fresh bid for bail on the basis he has not received the treatment he needs for post-traumatic stress disorder and an adjustment disorder in jail.</p>
      <p>He was assessed for both conditions in August, the court heard, and prison authorities ruled he did not require psychological treatment. He wanted to see his own psychologist and also refused to take medication.</p>
      <p>But forensic psychologist Jeffrey Cummins said the notes from the prison assessments "make no sense to me", and after a two-hour session he formed the view Mr Komiazyk's mental health had deteriorated in the 186 days since his arrest.</p>
      <p>"I would expect Mr Komiazyk's mental heath to deteriorate the longer he stays in custody," Mr Cummins said.</p>
      <p>Deputy Chief Magistrate Jelena Popovic said it was her experience that mental health services in prison were "woefully inadequate".</p>
      <p>Defence lawyers are also pushing for bail so Mr Komiazyk can be reunited with his 13-year-old son.</p>
      <p>The boy is in the care of Mr Komiazyk's brother, Richard, who tearfully recounted how his nephew missed his father, was bullied at school, was struggling in year 7 and "locks up" and refuses to discuss his problems.</p>
      <p>"He loves his father with a passion," Richard Komiazyk said.</p>
      <p>He said his nephew did not want to live with his mother, with whom he has a "vile" relationship.</p>
      <p>Richard Komiazyk said his brother's mental and physical health had clearly deteriorated in prison. "There's nothing left of him," he said, estimating Peter Komiazyk had lost 20 kilograms.</p>
      <p>Detective Senior Constable Tony Benham said the accused had a propensity for violence and was a risk of offending or contacting prosecution witnesses if granted bail.</p>
      <p>But defence counsel Malcolm Thomas said there was no evidence to back up suggestions he posed a risk, and there were concerns his mental health would continue to decline.</p>
      <p>Mr Komiazyk is unlikely to face trial until 2021.</p>
      <p>Prosecutor Sharn Coombes said Mr Komiazyk could be treated effectively in prison, that his son was being adequately cared for by the boy's uncle and that there were no compelling factors to justify bail.</p>
      <p>Ms Popovic will make a ruling on Friday.</p>
