      <p>Congress staged a protest in Parliament on Monday as party interim president Sonia Gandhi led the demonstrations on the premises over the Maharashtra political situation. MPs staged a protest inside both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha when MP Manish Tiwari alleged that the marshals had manhandled MPs in the House.</p>
      <p>Opposition leaders raised slogans of 'stop this murder of democracy' during the Question Hour in Lok Sabha on Monday. Sonia Gandhi led the party's protest in Parliament premises over Maharashtra government formation issue.</p>
      <p>Congress leaders alleged that the protesting MPs were manhandled inside the Lok Sabha when they stormed the Well.</p>
      <p>"It is a sad day for the Parliament today. MPs raised sensitive issues and stormed the Well when they were manhandled. Never ever have marshals manhandled MPs before. It is condemnable, even female MPs were manhandled," said Manish Tiwari.</p>
      <p>He added, "The highest temple of democracy is being stifled. This is fascism and we will continue to raise our voices against the issue."</p>
      <p>Congress leader Rahul Gandhi too called the politics over Maharashtra government formation a "murder of democracy". He said, "I wanted to ask a question in the House but it doesn't make any sense to ask a question right now as democracy has been murdered in Maharashtra."</p>
      <p>Congress-NCP-Shiv Sena had moved the Supreme Court seeking an immediate floor test in Maharashtra assembly after Devendra Fadnavis took oath as the chief minister in a sudden twist of events on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Until then, BJP had refused to form the government and NCP-Congress was in talks with Shiv Sena to stake claim and run a coalition government with Uddhav Thackeray as the chief minister.</p>
