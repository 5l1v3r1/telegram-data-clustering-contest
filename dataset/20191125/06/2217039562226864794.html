        <b>Bayern Munich closed the gap at the top of the Bundesliga to just a point with a 4-0 romp at Fortuna Duesseldorf on Saturday as leaders Borussia Moenchengladbach suffered a 2-0 defeat by Union Berlin.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Bayern's interim coach Hansi Flick enjoyed his third straight win since Niko Kovac was sacked earlier this month as the Bavarian side stayed third in the table.</p>
      <p>Bayern won with goals by Philippe Coutinho, Serge Gnabry, Benjamin Pavard and Corentin Tolisso.</p>
      <p>Despite rumours linking ex-Tottenham Hotspur manager Mauricio Pochettino to the Bayern vacancy, Flick has been told he will be in charge until at least Christmas.</p>
      <p>"I can imagine a lot, but there's still a long way to go," Flick replied when asked if he could imagine being made the permanent coach.</p>
      <p>"It will be like that until Christmas and I'm just trying to do my job well."</p>
