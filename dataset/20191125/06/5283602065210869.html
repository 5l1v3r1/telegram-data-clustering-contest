      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T06:57:15+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 06:57</time> by <a rel="author">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>Novartis AG is buying United States (US) biotechnology company The Medicines Co for about $9.7 billion, the Swiss drugmaker said on Sunday, as it seeks to expand its portfolio of medicines against cardiovascular disease.</p>
      <p>The deal is expected to help to broaden the Swiss drugmaker's range of heart medicines and shore up growth threatened by patent expirations.</p>
      <p>Novartis is paying $85 per share in cash, an approximately 24 per cent premium over The Medicines Co’s closing share price of $68.55 on November 22, Novartis said in a statement. It added that the transaction had been approved by the boards of directors of both companies.</p>
      <p>New Jersey-based The Medicines Co’s top drug candidate is cholesterol-lowering drug inclisiran for heart patients, which could complement Novartiss growing business with its heart-failure medicine Entresto, a slow-seller to start that has now crossed the $1 billion annual revenue threshold.</p>
      <p>The deal shows that Novartis is willing to spend billions on not only rare disease treatments, as it did in 2018 when it paid out $8.7 billion to buy gene therapy specialist AveXis, but also for cardiovascular treatments aimed at helping potentially millions of patients.</p>
      <p>Novartis has historically had a strong cardiovascular drug franchise, but lost ground when Diovan, once a $6 billion-per-year seller, lost patent protection in 2012 and left the company without an immediate, innovative follow-up product.</p>
