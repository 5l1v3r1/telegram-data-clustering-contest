      <p>Kelvynboy has a way of throwing bombs verbally and he has done it once again, this time by aiming it at Shatta Wale.</p>
      <p>In an interview with Vibes in 5 with Arnold Elevanyo Mensah, Kelvynboy was asked if he would move to Shatta Wale’s camp now that he has nothing to do with Stonebwoy.</p>
      <p>His response was that Shatta Wale has no record of good management so there’s no way he would love to join the Shatta Movement.</p>
      <p>He also mentioned that from past experience, he will not agree to be managed by Shatta Wale because although they will give him the platform, he [Kelvynboy] will be required to put so much effort in order to blow.</p>
      <p>
        <b>“I don’t see any good management that can manage me from Shatta’s camp. Yes, he can endorse me and support me and provide me with a feature that will help push my brand.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>For Ghanaians, we love to say it than to do it so I need to do it my own small way till I get people who have the energy to support me then I will work with them,”h</b>e said.</p>
