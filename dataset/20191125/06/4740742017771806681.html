      <h1>Pregnant women set for free swimming in South Gloucestershire</h1>
      <h2>The scheme is expected to begin in a few months' time</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T06:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Andrew McQuarrie</a></address>
      <p>Pregnant women will soon be allowed to swim for free at<a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/south-gloucestershire"> South Gloucestershire </a>leisure centres.</p>
      <p>The Circadian Trust Board has approved a year-long pilot scheme expected to begin in early 2020.</p>
      <p>The decision comes following a campaign by the Conservative parliamentary candidate for <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/thornbury">Thornbury</a> and <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/yate">Yate</a>, Luke Hall.</p>
      <p>Mr Hall said: “As a father living in Yate, it is great news that we have been able to secure free swimming for pregnant women."</p>
      <p>Mr Hall set up a petition calling for the scheme in response to a finding that women can boost their chances of a healthy pregnancy by keeping active.</p>
      <p>Mum-of-three Liz Brennan branded the success of the campaign "amazing news".</p>
      <p>The former swimming teacher said: "As a local mum, I think it is important for pregnant women to have access to vital exercise opportunities such as this.”</p>
      <p>Free swims are expected to be introduced in January or February 2020, according to <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/south-gloucestershire-council">South Gloucestershire Council</a>.</p>
      <p>Mr Hall said: "I am grateful to everyone who took the time to sign my petition. This is a very exciting initiative and I am grateful for the overwhelming support this campaign has received."</p>
