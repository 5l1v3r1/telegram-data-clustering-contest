      <p>Take in the magic of the holiday season from your seat on a vintage Vancouver “fishbowl” bus sporting reindeer antlers and Rudolph’s nose-so-bright as you tour Surrey neighbourhoods twinkling with Christmas lights.</p>
      <p>The annual <a href="https://tours.transitmuseumsociety.org/details.php">Christmas Lights Tour</a> put on by the Transit Museum Society (TRAMS) is a unique way to see the holiday sights–and it’s a fundraiser for the incredible work the TRAMS volunteers do to restore and promote the region’s transit history, including their fleet of vintage vehicles.</p>
      <p>The two and a half-hour tours depart at 7 p.m. from the Scott Road SkyTrain Station; the exact route will be determined closer to the event date to make sure the best and the most brightly decorated homes are on the tour.</p>
      <p>The bus will pick up its passengers west of the station exit under the guideway (not in the bus loop).</p>
      <p>Bus nerds, take note. The bus itself is a special one in the TRAMS fleet. It’s the 1982 General Motors T6H5307N, New Look type “Fishbowl” Hillclimber (BC Transit P4107). It was one of the first buses for Vancouver with turbocharged 6V92TA engines which were used often for climbing up Burnaby Mountain to Simon Fraser University.</p>

      <p>The Christmas Lights Tour is jolly fun, as the bus is decorated inside and out, and there are plenty of opportunities to stop and get out and check out the incredible home light displays (even in the pouring rain, as it was for many of the 2018 tour nights!).</p>
