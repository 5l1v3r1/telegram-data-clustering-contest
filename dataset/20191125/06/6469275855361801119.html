        <b>Preston will test the fitness of Ben Davies ahead of the trip to Hull City on Wednesday after the defender limped out of the defeat at Derby.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Davies was forced off in the 72nd minute with an ankle injury, having had treatment on it a short while earlier.</p>

      <p>He missed last month’s win over Blackburn with an ankle complaint and it could well be the same injury has flared up.</p>
      <p>Jordan Storey replaced him in the back four, this only his second time on the pitch in Championship action this season.</p>
      <p>The former Exeter man will be on alert to start at Hull if Davies does not make it.</p>
      <p>North End manager Alex Neil said: “It’s his ankle and I’m not sure the extent of it yet.</p>
      <p>“We will have to assess it and take things from there.”</p>
      <p>The enforced substitution prevented Neil making a last throw of the dice in an attacking sense at Pride Park.</p>
      <p>Neil had David Nugent ready to come on for Daniel Johnson but the striker did not get the chance to face his former club.</p>
      <p>His two other subs had been made at half-time, with Paul Gallagher and Billy Bodin replacing Darnell Fisher and Jayden Stockley.</p>
      <p>Said Neil: “We had 20 minutes left, I was going to take DJ off, move Sean Maguire behind Nuge and try to force the issue.</p>
      <p>“Unfortunately Ben pulled up right before that and we had to change the plans.”</p>
      <p>Neil offered no excuses for the 1-0 defeat to the Rams, Martyn Waghorn’s 33rd-minute goal settling it.</p>
      <p>Derby had plenty of chances to put the game to bed by half-time but only had the slender lead to fall back on.</p>
      <p>North End were better in the second half, helped by the double substitution and the reshuffle that caused.</p>
      <p>Neil will now look for a good response at the KCOM Stadium on Wednesday,</p>
      <p>Said Neil: “At half-time it would have been easy to start shouting and bawling, saying how poor they had been.</p>
      <p>“What we needed to do at half-time was fix it and I thought we did that.</p>
      <p>“But we didn’t get the goal we needed, which obviously was frustrating.</p>
      <p>“Nothing is won at the moment, we are going to lose games on the way.</p>
      <p>“What we have to do is take the disappointment from the game and try to make amends for the next one.</p>
      <p>“The players know and understand they didn’t play well, they are frustrated themselves.</p>
      <p>“We win and we lose as a team, sometimes I will get it wrong and sometimes they won’t perform well. That is part and parcel of it.</p>
      <p>“For all the chances Derby created, it took a corner for them to score. That is disappointing because we normally defend them well.”</p>
