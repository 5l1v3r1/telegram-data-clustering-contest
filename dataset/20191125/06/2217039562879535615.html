      <h2>To the ju-jitsu world champion, the mind is an arena as well</h2>

        <b>On the mat, Singapore's ju-jitsu champion Constance Lien tussles with opponents of all sizes but, in her mind, she grapples with formless yet formidable forces - her worrying thoughts.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The submission specialist shared that she felt the pressure to excel especially after winning the World International Brazilian Jiu-jitsu Championships blue belt featherweight (U-58.5kg) title in May.</p>
      <p>Lien, who promoted to a purple belt after the feat, was weighed down by expectations at the Ju-jitsu Asian Championships in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia – a SEA Games qualifier – two months later.</p>
      <p>The 20-year-old fell to Filipina Annie Ramirez, a judo black-belt holder and ju-jitsu world pro champion in the purple belt U-57kg division, and finished joint-third with Maha Alhinaai from the United Arab Emirates.</p>
      <p>"I got only a bronze in Mongolia and I felt like I could have done a lot better if I didn't worry about whether I could uphold this or mount that," she told The New Paper after a training session at Evolve MMA gym.</p>
      <p>When asked if she sees herself as her greatest enemy, she agreed. But she also considers it the "wake-up moment" she needed before the SEA Games.</p>
      <p>Upon reflection, she found that "the most important thing about competing is that I'm doing it because I love it" and now copes better with the pressure of being at the top.</p>
      <p>"Of course, there are going to be expectations, but the important thing is to do my best. Not anyone's expectation of my best but my own," she said.</p>
      <p>The Sportsgirl of the Year hopes to wrap up her season with a gold medal at the Nov 30-Dec 11 SEA Games in the Philippines, where it's going to get tougher.</p>
      <p>Ju-jitsu, which is making its debut at the biennial meet, will be an open-belt event, which means Lien is likely to face more established opponents with brown or black belts.</p>
      <p>"The competition level is definitely higher,"she said. "Competitors that are purple belt (or higher) are more serious about ju-jitsu and have developed their own game and uniquely crafted styles based on our body type.</p>
      <p>"That's something that makes ju-jitsu amazing because you'll never see a person with the same style as someone else."</p>
      <p>To achieve her target, Lien continues to work her body like a machine.</p>
      <p>As she put it, "For all the competitions I go for, my style of preparation is not on my opponents but only on myself."</p>
      <p>She has kept to the intense preparation that won her the world title, sticking to a regimen of training twice a day, seven days a week.</p>
      <p>The only thing she tweaked was swopping some cardio for strength and weight training.</p>
      <h3>BULKING UP</h3>
      <p>Lien, who weighed 58kg, is in the process of bulking up by three kilograms to compete in the U-62kg category.</p>
      <p>She also increased her time on the mats and spars with male athletes in anticipation of facing bigger opponents.</p>
      <p>Her coach Joao Teco Shinzato, a two-time world champion, is confident that Lien will reap the fruits of her labour.</p>
      <p>"I believe she will represent Singapore well at the SEA Games," he said. "She has two or three tough opponents lined up for her… but I believe she can bring back the gold."</p>
      <p>"Ju-jitsu is a complex sport and Lien is a specialist. She takes the time to specialise and perfect her style (for) more chances to take control of the game.</p>
      <p>"She's not the type of athlete I have to push because her drive and hunger surpass any kind of expectation I have.</p>
      <p>"I've taught ju-jitsu for 20 years now and I've never seen anyone train full-time with the kind of dedication she has."</p>
      <p>Lien also reminds Shinzato of his former disciple, Brazilian ju-jitsu legend Marcus Almeida, a 13-time world champion in the absolute (open-weight) and 100kg divisions.</p>
      <p>"She's an artist and truly has the potential to pursue this and be a black-belt world champion (one day)," he said.</p>
      <p>Lien will take a step closer to that at next year's world championships in Long Beach, California, where she will be eyeing her second world title.</p>
      <p>But first, the former swimmer wants to fulfil a long-time dream.</p>
      <p>Lien, who won a silver at last year's Asian Games, said: "The SEA Games is my last competition and my final goal for this year.</p>
      <p>"It was my childhood dream to go to the major Games as a swimmer. So, it's pretty cool that I get to represent (Singapore) in ju-jitsu instead."</p>
      <p>Lien, who recently became a Sport Singapore ambassador, also conducts mentorship sessions to motivate teens and youth athletes with a focus on mental health.</p>
      <p>"I'm still growing and healing as an individual and I want do more," she said.</p>
      <p>"When I was younger, I never had someone who could be the beacon of hope.</p>
      <p>"Now when I'm in a position where I can be that for others, I would love to do that."</p>
      <p>Having known what it's like to be conquered by conundrums, Lien finds joy in helping others overcome theirs.</p>
      <p>"I got only a bronze in Mongolia and I felt like I could have done a lot better if I didn't worry about whether I could uphold this or mount that."</p>
