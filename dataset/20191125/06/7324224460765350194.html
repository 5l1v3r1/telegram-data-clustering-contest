      <p>Access to the Baswich Grange development will be built on the A513 Weeping Cross, while a new signal crossing will be installed to the west of Lynton Avenue.</p>
      <p>Drainage will also be installed and street lights upgraded during the work, which is being paid for by the developer.</p>
      <p>Traffic management will be in place between 9.30am and 3.30pm.</p>
      <p>All work is set to be completed by December 20.</p>
      <p>Staffordshire County Council’s head of highways James Bailey said: “This developer-funded work will provide the access to the new Baswich Grange development as per the planning conditions.</p>
      <p>"The new pedestrian crossing will benefit people locally.</p>
      <p>"Work is taking place during off-peak hours on weekdays to minimise disruption, however we’d like to thank people in advance for their patience if travelling in the area.”</p>
