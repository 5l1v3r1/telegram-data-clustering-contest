      <h1>The Rx for DX: The Three Stages of Digital Transformation</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Marianna Kantor</a></address>
      <p>There’s urgency—even anxiety—around the subject of digital transformation with nearly 85 percent of corporate leaders believing they have a <a href="https://www.seagate.com/files/www-content/our-story/trends/files/idc-seagate-dataage-whitepaper.pdf">two-year timeframe</a> to execute a digital transformation before it’s too late. According to a recent <a href="https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/1624046/Digital%20Business%20Executive%20Summary_FINAL.pdf?t=1534365095051">report</a> from IDG, more than one-third of all companies have adopted a “digital-first” approach to business. Yet, even if we agree on the necessity of digital transformation, behind the unanimity lies a vagueness. What exactly does it mean to enact a transformative digital strategy?           Digital transformation can mean many things to many people. In the early days, it meant moving from analog to digital devices. That’s the first stage of digital transformation most of us are familiar with, like doing everyday business on the web. As for what comes next, digital transformation unfolds in three distinct stages.</p>
      <p>
        <b>DX Stage One</b>
      </p>
      <p>           First, companies need to apply the concept of the “digital twin.” Every critical real-world asset should have a corresponding digital shadow—a virtual model used for monitoring, analysis, and planning. Ongoing IoT developments, including sensors, can make that digital twin respond to real-time changes.</p>
      <p>The digital twin concept is already a common feature in many workflows. For example, farmers who practice precision agriculture rely on tractor-mounted devices that measure everything from pesticide deployment to soil moisture levels. Logistics companies maximize routing efficiency by compiling data on how much time drivers spend waiting to make left turns.</p>
      <p>           Because a digital twin needs no downtime, it gathers the maximum amount of data. As we sleep, the digital twin continues to optimize various components of the physical world, which we learn about the next morning and implement.</p>
      <p>
        <b>DX Stage Two</b>
      </p>
      <p>           The next stage involves maximizing the utility of the digital twin. Flush with data, companies need to use advanced analytics to find patterns and trends. The soil-moisture data helps the farmer understand how much water to use. The logistics company perhaps decides to alter its routing system to prioritize avoiding left-turns over finding the most direct route.</p>
      <p>           This step can be thought of as the “intelligence phase” when companies fuse location intelligence and <a href="https://www.esri.com/en-us/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> and deep learning. At this stage in DX, a company trains its computers to rapidly process and analyze enormous datasets, noting patterns that even an expert would miss. It’s bringing a human touch and intelligence to machines to get the right outcome. This is the apex of digital transformation: using the past to predict the future.</p>
      <p>           As a company’s digital transformation strategy evolves, so too does its ability to maximize <a href="https://www.esri.com/en-us/location-intelligence">location intelligence</a>. Most data contains a location component. This specific <i>where</i> is intrinsic to the data’s value. A modern geographic information system (GIS) displays this information on the familiar landscape of a map. Data leaps off a spreadsheet, comes alive. With a GIS, you can display information in layers and switch them on and off as needed, as you evaluate issues of efficiency, productivity, operations or risk. Visually rich dashboards enable executives to view key data in different combinations and from various perspectives.</p>
      <p>           In addition to empowering decision-making, <a href="https://www.esri.com/about/newsroom/publications/wherenext/enterprise-technology-behind-big-business-decisions/">GIS</a> provides an ideal place to manage data. It not only solves the problem of converting data into insight and action—but also how best to store, process, integrate, and enrich data.</p>
      <p>           This is why, for example, a top US automotive company uses GIS to display the demographic data it collects that lets dealers predict which vehicle makes and models will be popular at their respective locations. It’s why Europe’s largest port made the transition from a spreadsheet-based legacy system to a GIS that tracks every moving part, from ships to containers. And it’s why a major power company, serving Southwest and Midwest US states, depends on GIS to get a real-time view of grid operations and understand how best to dispatch workers to handle mission critical maintenance.</p>
      <p>
        <b>DX Stage Three</b>
      </p>
      <p>           The interface of GIS with the third digital transformation stage is where location intelligence truly shines.</p>
      <p>            Since everything is programmable, everything gets smart and intelligent. Let’s take the example of insulators located in powerline poles. To detect insulators that need repair, power companies have traditionally had to use helicopters for visual inspection while someone inside photographs each pole and asset. Experts later analyze these geocoded photos to discern issues. However, new methods will replace helicopters with unmanned drones, equipped with AI programs that can identify potential equipment issues far more efficiently.</p>
      <p>           Location intelligence benefits extend to every facet of an organization. My colleague at Esri, Jay Theodore, emphasizes how location intelligence empowers those on the “edge” of an organization, the people most likely to interact with company assets and customers, with information and data that accelerates and strengthens decision-making.</p>
      <p>That US automotive company, for example, ensures its location intelligence lives on the web so dealers can consult and learn from it. Utility workers in the field use mobile location intelligence apps for real-time situational awareness—sharing data to and from the office in real time. The nation’s largest retail-oriented real estate company uses AI-enabled location intelligence to analyze millions of demographic and psychographic data points to help advise its clients on site- and market planning.</p>
      <p>           Insight-driven companies understand that <a href="https://www.esri.com/en-us/digital-transformation/overview?adumkts=branding&amp;aduc=advertising&amp;adum=print&amp;aduSF=Forbes&amp;utm_Source=print_advertising&amp;aduca=M17Branding&amp;aduco=12.12_30Under302018&amp;adut=OneHalfPageSpreadHorizontal_WithinFutureofCitiesEditorial">digital transformation</a> is about intelligence and speed. They are committed to using data in a way that maximizes information and democratizes distribution. Choosing <i>whether</i> to create a DX plan is no longer an option. The only relevant question is how to develop one that will best transform your business.</p>
