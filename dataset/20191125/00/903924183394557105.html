      <h1>“Make out you’re not a friend”: Tory caught staging friendly voters for the cameras</h1>
      <h2>The Mail’s Michael Crick overheard Tory candidate for Ashfield Lee Anderson setting someone up to greet him on the doorstep for flattering press coverage.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.newstatesman.com/writers/328394" target="_blank">Election Mole</a></address>
      <p>It’s beginning to look a lot like elexmas – as we have our first traditional “hot mic” moment of the campaign!</p>
      <p>Broadcaster Michael Crick of the <i>Mail </i>was <a href="https://www.mailplus.co.uk/tv/the-michael-crick-report/653/caught-in-the-act-how-hot-mic-exposed-would-be-mps-fake-news-ruse">making a film in Ashfield</a> following the Tory candidate Lee Anderson around doorknocking – a standard piece of political coverage on the road.</p>
      <p>But it turned out his mic was on when he privately called someone up to stage them for the cameras as a friendly voter:</p>
      <blockquote>“Don’t, just make out you don’t, make out you know who I am, that you know I’m the candidate but not a friend, all right? I’m at the carpark, have a quick look, yeah? All right, I’ll see you in a minute.”</blockquote>
      <p>There’s a moment in the film where a resident called Steve opens the door to him and <a href="https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/general-election-2019-conservative-candidate-lee-anderson-ashfield-council-tenants-tents-vegetables-1303891">praises Anderson’s calls</a> for council tenants to be housed in tents, forced to wake up at 6am to pick vegetables, and then given cold showers.</p>
      <p>Anderson looks embarrassed when the man says he was “too soft” and instead suggests a “cat o’ nine tails” and putting them “in a pink tutu”. “I can’t support this, can we just cut there for one moment please?” asks the candidate.</p>
      <p>Crick laughs as Anderson says the film will “end my career”, and jokes that it’s “almost like it’s been set up for us”.</p>
      <p>Earlier in the film, Anderson repeats “no comment” when Crick tries to ask about the rather barbaric policy proposal.</p>
      <p>It’s not clear whether this was the conversation in question that Anderson set up – your mole has contacted the local Tories to ask them, and will give you an update when it hears back.</p>
