      <h2>Liverpool have shipped more than twice as many goals as at the same stage last season - but have more points and are eight points clear at the top of the Premier League</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:39:11+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 00:39</time> by <a rel="author">Gareth Bicknell</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool left-back Andy Robertson has hit back at criticism of the Reds' defensive record - telling the doubters to get some perspective.</p>
      <p>Jurgen Klopp's men are eight points clear at the top of the Premier League, but they have shipped more than twice as many goals as they had at this stage last season.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> have conceded 11 goals in 13 Premier League games and have kept only one clean sheet - whereas the Reds' defence was breached only five times in the first 13 games last term.</p>
      <p>But <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/andy-robertson">Robertson</a> said critics should look at the bigger picture, with Liverpool four points better off than at this stage last season, having won all but one of their league clashes so far.</p>
      <p>“We have 37 points out of 39 so to say anything negative is harsh," said Robertson, speaking after Roberto Firmino's late winner earned a 2-1 win over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> on Saturday.</p>

      <p>"We want to keep more clean sheets, of course we do, and today would have been a good one to get but unfortunately we couldn’t do it.</p>
      <p>"Last season we had a better defensive record but did not have as many points so we need to put it into perspective.”</p>
      <p>After the first 13 games of last season, Liverpool were second, two points behind <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> . Klopp's side went on to finish second by just a single point, with a 2-1 defeat to Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium in January their only reverse of the campaign.</p>
      <p>This season, City are nine points behind Liverpool having lost three games already. The Reds are now unbeaten in 30 Premier League games, having won every game so far this term except for a 1-1 draw against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> at Old Trafford last month.</p>

      <p>And manager Klopp says his team can get even better.</p>
      <p>“We know what we want and what we have to do for it,” the Liverpool boss said.</p>
      <p>“It is so difficult to get 37 points from 13 matches but we know we can do better.</p>
      <p>“There have been little problems, little injuries, little bits here and there.</p>
      <p>“But today, at 3pm, we had to be there against a team that is really good, and we fought. Big credit to my boys, but the next one is waiting.”</p>
      <p>In the first of three home matches in a row, Liverpool host Napoli in the Champions League on Wednesday targeting a win to ensure they top Group E.</p>
      <p>The Reds then entertain <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brighton-and-hove-albion-fc">Brighton</a> on Saturday, followed by the Merseyside derby at Anfield a on Wednesday, December 4.</p>
