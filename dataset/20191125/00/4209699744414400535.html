      <p>The family of rights activist, Omoyele Sowore, has called on the Department of State Services to release their son without further delay.<br/><br/>Sowore was arrested on August 3 by the DSS for organising a series of protest against bad governance in Nigeria.<br/><br/>In a statement signed by Olusegun Sowore and Robert Sowore, the family maintained that their son believed in one Nigeria and had passion for the peaceful co-existence of the citizenry.<br/><br/>The family said, “The continued incarceration of Omoyele in DSS custody, even after the court had given directive for his release give us cause for concern.<br/><br/>“The attitude does not portray the government in a good light in the eyes of the citizens and international observers.<br/><br/>“The family is particularly worried about the DSS disregard for the rule of law.<br/><br/>“We envisage that the DSS in their characteristic manner would deliberately want to incarcerate him for no just cause even after meeting his stringent bail conditions slammed on him.<br/><br/>"We call on well-meaning Nigerians, human rights organisations, President Muhammadu Buhari, governors and legislators to urgently intervene in the matter." </p>
