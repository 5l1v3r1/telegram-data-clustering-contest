      <h3>NEW DAWN</h3>
      <p>Silversea's newest flagship vessel, Silver Muse, arrived in Darwin this week and will remain in our region until March 2020, its longest Australian deployment to date. We may well be seeing more of Silversea's luxury vessels in Australian waters over the next few years, with the company expanding rapidly. Silver Moon is due to launch next year, as is dedicated Galapagos Islands expedition ship Silver Origin. Other Silversea ships on the horizon include Silver Dawn, expected to sail out in September 2021 for a Mediterranean inaugural season, and two Evolution-class vessels.</p>
