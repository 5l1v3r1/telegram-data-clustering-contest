      <p>In this month’s episode of Talking Under Water, hosts Lauren Del Ciello, Bob Crossen and Katie Johns unpack the recent U.S. EPA proposal to amend coal ash wastewater and monitoring rules. And they also discuss Ohio’s new H2Ohio plan, which aims to reduce algae blooms, improve wastewater infrastructure and prevent lead contamination. Lastly, due to a technical snafu, the planned interview for this month was changed from cyber security to energy efficiency and drives, as the hosts share an interview with Mads Warming of Danfoss during WEFTEC 2019.</p>
