      <p>Millions of people are dreading a visit to the airport this week as they face the annual drudge home for Thanksgiving. TSA expects over 27 million people at U.S. airports this week. Airports are rarely fun places to spend time these days, especially on busy holiday travel weeks. However, one way to combat this misery is to treat yourself to lounge access. If you’ll be flying out of Boston’s Logan International Airport this holiday season, here are five reasons you should splurge on a ticket that includes access to the British Airways lounge in Terminal E.</p>

      <h3>1)   Seating</h3>
      <p>Thanks to 10,000 square feet of lounge and dining space, the BA lounge is able to provide travelers with comfortable seating in a variety of formats. As you walk into the lounge you pass cozy armchairs, complete with end tables, reading lights and charging ports, perfect for enjoying a book or getting some work done before the flight. As you move towards the center of the lounge, you’ll enter the main dining space, which features both a hot and cold buffet, long dining tables and a separate 1<sup>st</sup> class dining area. Then you pass the showers and bathrooms, leading to the main bar at the back of the lounge. The semicircular bar faces out on the runways and overlooks the Boston skyline, making this a fun, beautiful place to socialize before takeoff.</p>
      <h3>2)   Dining</h3>

      <p>Each night, a full, hot dinner is served before all transatlantic flights. The team constantly reinvents the menu, so even if you are a frequent traveler you won’t be caught eating the same dishes. Dinner also regularly features make-your-own, customizable plates, such as: ramen, tacos, and more. They also recently launched a made-to-order menu called, “The Pub at Boston”. Currently the Pub menu features a burger, a plant-based burger and a pasta dish. Guests place an order at the counter and a server brings it right to their seat once it’s ready.</p>

      <p>Who doesn’t love free drinks? Of course, the BA lounge features an open bar, including serve yourself wine and beer at the cold buffet, and a full, staffed bar at the back of the lounge. You can also order drinks from the servers throughout the lounge. The head bartender, Katie Clements, runs the cocktail program and is always coming up with creative, seasonal cocktails that rival any you could find in town. Order your go-to or try something new, Katie’s team will ensure you start your trip off right!</p>
      <h3>4)   Boarding</h3>
      <p>For many BA and other One World flights, you will board directly from the lounge. This means going directly from sipping a craft cocktail to boarding the plane, no queuing in the general gate area. And less time in the airport is definitely a good thing!</p>
