      <h1>First look at Jeffrey Epstein inside his ‘Pedophile Island’ lair</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:15:14+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 00:15</time> by <a rel="author">Kate Sheehy</a></address>
      <p>Here is the first look at the monster in his lair.</p>
      <p>Newly surfaced photos obtained by The Post <a href="https://nypost.com/tag/jeffrey-epstein/">reveal for the first time</a> how Jeffrey Epstein — and a horde of girls — spent time at his now-notorious Caribbean hideaway, nicknamed “Pedophile Island’’ by locals.</p>
      <p>The multimillionaire convicted pedophile is dressed casually in the creepy snapshots, including one in which he chats on the phone — while getting a massage from a grinning young blonde who appears to be his assistant, Sarah Kellen.</p>
      <p>Some of the snaps feature intimate glimpses into the late fiend’s luxurious digs, including a white-drenched bedroom with a full and twin bed.</p>
      <p>Other photos provide breathtaking views of the palm tree-laden private island, Little St. James — while featuring beautiful young women posing for the camera.</p>
      <p>The spot, Epstein’s main residence, also was called “Orgy Island” by locals hired by him to run it — although the financier liked to refer to it as “Little St. Jeff’s.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://nypost.com/2019/08/12/jeffrey-epstein-hanged-himself-with-prison-bedsheet-source/">Before his death behind bars in August</a>, Epstein was accused of forcing young women, including some who were underage, into participating in sex orgies at the US Virgin Islands property. He would allegedly host a slew of powerful men, including Prince Andrew, there. The royal has denied the claim.</p>
      <p>But Epstein’s former personal masseuse, Chauntae Davies, who provided the photos, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10409881/jeffrey-epstein-rape-paedophile-island-prince-andrew/">told the Sun of Britain</a> that it is unbelievable that Andrew claims he had no idea what was going on with his sicko pal.</p>
      <p>She said Epstein would brag about his ties to the royal to reel in new victims.</p>
      <p>“There is no way you could have been a friend of Jeffrey’s and not know what was going on,’’ Davies said.</p>
      <p>“I don’t see how you could see somebody with another young girl all the time and there never being a conversation about it. It doesn’t add up.”</p>
      <p>She said she was recruited to work for Epstein by his socialite buddy, Ghislaine Maxwell, who has been accused of procuring girls for him. Maxwell has denied any wrongdoing.</p>
      <p>One of Davies’ photos shows Maxwell grinning at a massive white marble table at the private island estate.</p>
      <p>Davies said she was flown around the world to cater to Epstein’s whims on his private jet, which has been called the “Lolita Express.’’ He raped her over several years before she escaped in 2005, she said.</p>
      <p>She described him as “charming’’ while in public — but “behind closed doors, a monster came out.”</p>
