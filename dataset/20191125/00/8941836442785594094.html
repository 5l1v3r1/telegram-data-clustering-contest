      <p>ASPEN, Colo. (AP) - Aspen Skiing Co. says it has pretty much filled its workforce needs for Colorado’s 2019-20 ski season.</p>
      <p>The Aspen Daily News reports that filling ski season jobs can be troublesome for many ski resorts in the region and elsewhere.</p>
      <p>At its winter-season peak, Aspen Skiing will have between 4,000 and 4,500 employees. That total includes full-time, part-time and seasonal workers at its four mountain operations and the local hotels it owns, along with year-round salaried parent company positions.</p>
      <p>Public relations manager Tucker Vest Burton says this year has been the best year for hiring for Aspen Skiing in its modern history.</p>
      <p>She attributes that to the company’s new website, which has allowed it to promote jobs in a more seamless and effective way.</p>
