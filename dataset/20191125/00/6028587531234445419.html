      <p>In May of 1940, the Nazi war machine was pouring into the Low Countries and France. Within weeks, those nations would be overrun, and Britain would stand alone against Hitler. Winston Churchill became Prime Minister as catastrophe loomed. Churchill’s darkest hour provides a clear playbook for how to effectively manage a crisis. In dire circumstances, he communicated with remarkable openness and honesty, winning the respect of his cabinet and the trust of his people.  When Churchill took over, he faced both a military crisis and a domestic crisis in confidence. Many had questioned his appointment. A growing number of politicians were <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/darkest-hour/britain-on-the-brink/">demanding peace with Germany</a>. They reasoned if France was defeated, Britain’s only hope was to beg for Hitler’s mercy. Churchill knew that such capitulation would mean the end of Britain. Understanding that only a united Britain could triumph over the Nazis, he first aimed to rally his dispirited and divided nation.</p>
      <p>Churchill could have minimized the Allied defeats or rashly promised an immediate turnaround. However, as the Nazis relentlessly advanced, such claims would have destroyed his credibility. Instead, he leveled with his audience: “we have before us an ordeal of the most grievous kind. We have before us many, many long months of struggle and of suffering.” However, these hardships were worth the price, for “without victory, there is no survival.” In <a href="https://winstonchurchill.org/resources/speeches/1940-the-finest-hour/blood-toil-tears-and-sweat-2/">this mid-May address to Parliament</a>, Churchill fully pledged himself to the great task ahead, declaring, “I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears and sweat.” By taking up this burden alongside his countrymen, Churchill lent them strength during a rapidly deteriorating military situation. </p>
      <p>When Churchill <a href="https://winstonchurchill.org/resources/speeches/1940-the-finest-hour/we-shall-fight-on-the-beaches/">next spoke to Parliament</a> in early June, the French defenses had been shattered and the British army had been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunkirk_evacuation"><u>evacuated from the Continent</u></a>. Rather than ignoring these setbacks, Churchill directly addressed British fears, explaining what had gone wrong and why. His thoughtful assessment of the situation showed his coolness under pressure and his competence as a leader.</p>
      <p>Churchill then turned to the miraculous rescue at Dunkirk. While he celebrated the operation’s tremendous importance, he offered the bitter truth that “wars are not won by evacuations.” Again, he steeled his audience for the challenges ahead. Doubling-down on his absolute commitment, he promised “we shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender.”</p>
      <p>A few weeks later, France was nearing collapse when <a href="https://winstonchurchill.org/resources/speeches/1940-the-finest-hour/their-finest-hour/">Churchill again spoke</a> to the nation. He wanted to prepare them for the Nazi onslaught. Once more, he discussed the latest military developments in vivid detail. He acknowledged that “the Battle of France is over…[and] the Battle of Britain is about to begin.” He grimly discussed the anticipated invasion and assault, warning that “the whole fury and might of the enemy must very soon be turned on us.”</p>
      <p>Although Churchill never understated the risks, he instilled in Britain the confidence that it would triumph. He described realistic causes for hope: Britain’s battle-tested army, the heavy losses the air force had inflicted, and the might of the navy and the empire. Finally, he boiled the conflict down to a single point. “Hitler knows that he will have to break us in this Island or lose the war.” Churchill made clear that “upon this battle depends the survival of Christian civilization, and “all we have known and cared for.” He urged Britain to rise to the challenge and make this “their finest hour.”</p>
      <p>Churchill’s candor during the dark days of 1940 forged a magnetic bond between him and his people. His powerful combination of realism, optimism, and defiance inspired Britons across the political spectrum. From July 1940 until VE Day in 1945, his approval rating never fell below 78 percent. Churchill endures as a symbol of Britain and the triumph of Democracy over Fascism.</p>
