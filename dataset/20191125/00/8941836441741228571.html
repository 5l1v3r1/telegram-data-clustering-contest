      <p>ROME (AP) - Cagliari wasted a two-goal advantage against Lecce in a wild 2-2 draw in Serie A on Monday.</p>
      <p>In a match that was postponed from Sunday due to torrential rain, Cagliari ended with nine men and Lecce with 10.</p>
      <p>João Pedro and Radja Nainggolan put visiting Cagliari ahead 2-0 before teammate and defender Fabrizio Cacciatore was sent off for pushing a shot over the bar with his hand nine minutes from time.</p>
      <p>Gianluca Lapadula converted the ensuing penalty kick then got involved in a shoving match with goalkeeper Robin Olsen that resulted in both players being sent off.</p>
      <p>Marco Calderoni equalized in added time with an angled shot from inside the box.</p>
