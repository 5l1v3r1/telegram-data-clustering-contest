        <b>PRIME Minister Andrew Holness says that Jamaica's relationship with the United States is stronger than it has ever been.</b>
      </p>
      <p>“Our relationship with the United States of America is as strong as it has ever been, and I dare say it is stronger now than it has ever been before,” Holness told a huge crowd, which packed the National Arena and overflowed Independence Park in Kingston yesterday for the Jamaica Labour Party's (JLP) staging of its 76th annual conference.</p>
      <p>The JLP leader also noted that the party has increased Jamaica's presence and participation on the global stage.</p>
      <p>“I am not certain if there has ever been a time in Jamaica's history when Jamaica has had such a global and international profile, and I am pleased to say that we have good diplomatic relations with everyone with whom we are in business,” he said.</p>
      <p>However, he pointed out that Jamaica has always had a foreign policy based on principles.</p>
      <p>“We believe in multilateralism, with special and differential treatment for trade for small-developing economies. We believe in democracy, the rule of law and human rights, and we believe in the non-interference in the domestic affairs of sovereign countries. That has always been the core of our foreign policy, and that hasn't changed,” he said.</p>
      <p>Holness, who recognised the presence of new United States Ambassador to Jamaica Donald Tapia, as well as other diplomats, recalled that in September he visited the White House and had a summit with US Vice-president Mike Pence. He said that this led to Jamaica starting discussions on a new framework for cooperation between both countries, which addressed national security, trade and investment and resilience.</p>
      <p>“You will see that we have signed a new memorandum of co-operation and intercept. We didn't sign it with any secret. It is not a secret MOU (memorandum of understanding). It is something that is done with the knowledge and consent of the Cabinet and all the relevant authorities have reviewed it,” he told the crowd.</p>
      <p>The prime minister said that within that framework, there are other areas of cooperation with the US, including agreements on customs and border control and protection.</p>
      <p>He noted that Jamaica is no longer involved in an International Monetary Fund programme, and paid tribute to the Congressional Black Caucus in the US for the support they had given prior to and during the life of the most recent agreements.</p>
      <p>He thanked the US Treasury Department, which “supported, guided and continue to give support for developing Jamaica's capacity to manage and successfully conclude the IMF programmes”.</p>
      <p>He also noted that Jamaica has a special cooperation with the European Union (EU), as well, which is also helping to build the country in the area of community development and security.</p>
      <p>He announced that the EU will be providing Jamaica with support of some 20 million euros, which will be used to support a strategy of intervention in crime-ridden communities, through the extension of the zones of special operations (ZOSOs).</p>
      <p>He said that about seven new ZOSOs will be added to the two already operating in Denham Town in west Kingston and Mount Salem in St James, utilising the funds from the EU as well as Government financing to fight crime.</p>
