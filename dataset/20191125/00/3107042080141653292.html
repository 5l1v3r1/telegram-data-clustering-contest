      <h1>Actress to take on a top role in Christchurch show business</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.odt.co.nz/author/georgia.oconnor%40starmedia.kiwi" target="_blank">Georgia O'Connor-Harding</a></address>
      <p>“Big shoes to fill.”</p>
      <p>That is how Sarah Buchanan describes taking on the role of Showbiz Christchurch president following the resignation of Markham Lee about three weeks ago.</p>
      <p>Having a strong association with the company since 1989, Mrs Buchanan said taking on the role is an exciting new change.</p>
      <p>Mr Lee has served as president of Showbiz on and off since 1990 with his association with Showbiz beginning in 1973 at age 11 when he performed in <i>Oliver!</i></p>
      <p>But it isn’t the only major change to the strong musical theatre company – which has been operating since 1938.</p>
      <p>Paul Christ will take over as general manager in January after Michael Bayly finished in the role in mid-September.</p>
      <p>Mr Bayly, who served as general manager since May 2015, has gone onto become the national on-premise manager at Cassels Brewing Co.</p>
      <p>Mr Christ has a wealth of experience in musical theatre having supervised, conducted and directed productions for Disney Theatrical Productions, Cameron Mackintosh and Vienna State Opera.</p>
      <p>He said Showbiz offers the perfect opportunity to draw on his professional musical theatre experience along with his work in commercial and not-for-profit art sectors.</p>
      <p>“I have travelled extensively for a large part of my career . . . it was time to come home and reconnect with family and put to use that industry experience to the advantage of the New Zealand performing arts sector.”</p>
      <p>Mrs Buchanan has a long-standing relationship with Showbiz having served as vice-president for the past five years and been on the board since 2010.</p>
      <p>She said her role as president will be made easy due to having a “marvellous” team and board she has been able to delegate tasks to take the pressure off.</p>
      <p>“We are really lucky we have all these exciting shows coming through from the West End and we are able to stage them here which is fantastic,” Mrs Buchanan said.</p>
      <p>In September, Showbiz announced a dazzling season to be staged at the Isaac Theatre Royal next year starting off with My Fair Lady from April 3.</p>
      <p>In June, the music of Chess will be staged in concert with the Christchurch Symphony Orchestra.</p>
      <p>The final show of the year to be staged will be <i>Buddy – The Buddy Holly Story</i> featuring the music of American musician and singer-songwriter Buddy Holly.</p>
      <p>Mrs Buchanan said the talent in the city is phenomenal and Showbiz has fantastic creatives who know how to put on a show.</p>
      <p>She has led an exciting career both on and off the stage including touring as a personal dresser with English singer Elaine Paige twice.</p>
      <p>Although she has taken on a major role at the company, Mrs Buchanan’s days in the spotlight are far from over.</p>
      <p>She will play the Queen of Transylvania and perform in the ensemble as part of <i>My Fair Lady</i>.</p>
