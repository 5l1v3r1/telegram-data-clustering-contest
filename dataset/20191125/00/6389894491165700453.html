      <p>Over 5m customers have switched energy supplier so far in 2019, Energy UK has revealed, as consumers continue to make the most of increased competition.</p>
      <p>The latest figures show that 626,284 customers moved to a new supplier last month – down 1.1 per cent on October 2018.</p>

      <p>Over 100,000 of these came from people switching from small and medium-sized companies to large providers, suggesting that the Big Six may have learnt a lesson from their smaller competitors.</p>
      <p>Peter Earl, head of energy at comparethemarket.com, said:</p>
      <p>“After years of haemorrhaging customers the Big Six have staged a comeback, clawing customers from smaller and medium-sized energy suppliers.</p>
      <p>“More than 100,000 customers switched from a small and medium-sized supplier to a large provider in October, a number which eclipses any other month in the last two years. British Gas appears to have woken up to the threat from start-up and challenger energy brands, going gung-ho for value with a very competitively priced tariff in an attempt to lure back customers.</p>
      <p>“The Big Six have snatched the momentum from their smaller and nimbler energy rivals – but whether this is a longer-term trend or merely a blip remains to be seen.”  </p>
      <p>The total number of switches hit 5,367,738 so far this year, up 9.2 per cent on the same time last year – when a record 5.8m customers switched supplier.</p>
      <p>The number of people switching supplier has grown every year since 2014, when there were around 3.2m changes.</p>
      <p>Audrey Gallacher, Energy UK’s director of policy, said:</p>
      <p>“This month’s figures show that consumers continue to take advantage of the increased competition. Over 5.3m customers have already moved to a new supplier and switching is on track to hit the 6m mark this year.</p>

      <p>“With the temperatures dropping across the country, I’d encourage consumers to get in touch with their supplier or have a look online to make sure they’re on the best deal ahead of winter and the cold weather.</p>
      <p>“More importantly I’d urge everyone to make their homes more energy efficient – for example by insulating the roof or installing LED light bulbs – as this is the best way to save money on your bills and at the same time do your bit to save the planet.”</p>
