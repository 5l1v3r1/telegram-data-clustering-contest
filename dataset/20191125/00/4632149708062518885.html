      <p><i>Pro-democracy camp is calling the vote a test of support for city’s chief executive; campaign marked by brutal attacks on candidates<br/></i><br/>Record numbers of people voted on Sunday in Hong Kong district council elections viewed as a test of support for chief executive Carrie Lam following six months of often violent pro-democracy protests that have convulsed the Chinese-ruled city. <br/><br/>Government data showed more than 2.6 million people had voted by 7.30 pm, a turnout rate of 63 per cent, with three hours left until polling stations closed - a showing that appeared to have been encouraged by the political turmoil. It was already the highest turnout in Hong Kong's history of district council elections post handover from British rule. <br/><br/>About 1.47 million voted in the last district elections four years ago. <br/><br/>The voter numbers showed people's determination, said one voter named Tsz, 30, who works in the service industry. "The high turnout rate...definitely reflects Hong Kong people's hope for genuine universal suffrage," he said. <br/><br/>Casting her ballot, the Beijing-backed Lam pledged that her government would listen "more intensively" to the views of district councils. <br/><br/>"I hope this kind of stability and calm is not only for today's election, but to show that everyone does not want Hong Kong to fall into a chaotic situation again," Lam said. <br/><br/>The protests started over a now-withdrawn extradition bill that would have allowed people to be sent to mainland China for trial but rapidly evolved into calls for full democracy, posing the biggest popular challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012. <br/><br/>They have at times forced the closure of government, businesses and schools as police used tear gas, rubber bullets and water cannon in response to petrol bombs and rocks. <br/><br/>The run-up to the election was marked by attacks on candidates, with one stabbed and wounded and another having part of his ear bitten off. <br/><br/>Ming Lee, 26, who works in event production, said she hoped the higher turnout would benefit the pro-democracy camp that is battling some seats that were once uncontested and dominated by pro-Beijing candidates. <br/><br/>"I hope this vote can counter the voice of the pro-establishment, so as to bring in more voices from the democrats," <br/><br/>The district councils control some spending and decide issues such as recycling and public health. A record 1,104 candidates were vying for 452 seats and a record 4.1 million people have enrolled to vote. <br/><br/>If the pro-democracy campaigners gain control, they could secure six seats on Hong Kong's semi-representative Legislative Council and 117 seats on the 1,200-member panel that selects its chief executive.</p>
