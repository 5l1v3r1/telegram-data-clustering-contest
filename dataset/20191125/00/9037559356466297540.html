      <p>KARACHI: No case has been filed as of Sunday over an incident wherein a man struck his wife and two children on their heads with a hammer, wounding them so severely that they went into coma.</p>
      <p>The man had committed suicide afterwards and the girl also succumbed to her wounds. The mother and the son were injured and shifted to a private hospital on the National Stadium Road for medical treatment.</p>
      <p>The incident had occurred in Karachi'sÂ Shadman Town a day prior but neither of the two wounded people have come out of coma, as of reporting time, which is why police said they were not registering a first information report (FIR).</p>
      <p>Police said they could not register an FIR until the wounded woman came out of her coma and recorded her statement.</p>
