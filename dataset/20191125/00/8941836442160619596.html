      <p>LAVAL, Quebec (AP) - Olympic champion sprinter Bruny Surin was just beaten to the tape in his first political race.</p>
      <p>He ran in a municipal district contest in Laval, Quebec, outside Montreal. He lost Sunday by 82 votes in his bid to become councilor.</p>
      <p>Surin has said his interest in healthy lifestyles and community involvement was behind his decision to enter politics. The seat was vacant after the death of the previous councilor.</p>
      <p>The four-time Olympian lost to Michel Trottier - 1,501 votes to 1,419- in the Marc-Aurele-Fortin district.</p>
