      <p>Member of Parliament for Klottey-Korley Constituency, Zanetor Agyeman-Rawlings says that the implementation of the Free Senior High School policy will reduce the quality of graduates produced in second cycle institutions.</p>
      <p>Speaking in Ho at an orientation and handing over ceremony for the Tertiary Educational Institutions Network (TEIN) of the NDC in the Volta Region, she said “it’s not only about education, it’s about quality education.</p>
      <p>“When they have the education, the teachers are not enough to teach them so they don’t get the education of quality they need,” she continued.</p>
      <p>The MP for Klottey-Korley believes that infrastructural development is just as crucial as building human capacity and that both need to be considered when providing quality education for schoolchildren.</p>
      <p>“A lot of schools have been left hanging, the completion of these schools has not been happening,” she said.</p>
      <p>“Now we have a situation where you have students who can’t all be at school at the same time,” she continued while emphasizing that to achieve a fully progressive free education system, enough school structures have to be available to take the huge number of children who would be going to school.</p>
      <p>She insists that the lack of infrastructure and lack of teachers of the second cycle schools have indeed affected the level of quality of teaching and learning.</p>
