      <p>Former President John Mahama on Friday, 22 November 2019 received the Asantehene, Otumfuo Osei Tutu II, in his office ahead of his UPSA Leadership Lecture 2019.</p>
      <p>Mr. Mahama said he discussed with the Asantehene a number of critical national development issues, and also tapped into his counsel.</p>
      <p>According to him, the Asantehene has always had a relationship underlined by mutual respect and brotherliness, "and it was, indeed, a great honour to welcome him and his delegation."</p>
      <p>The ex-President was joined by the National Chairman of the National Democratic Congress (NDC), Mr. Samuel Ofosu-Ampofo; Second Deputy Speaker of Parliament Alban Bagbin, former Chief of Staff Julius Debrah, executives of the NDC and former appointees to welcome the Asantehene.</p>
