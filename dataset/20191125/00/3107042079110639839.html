      <p>A talented line-up of past and present students from Ashburton College, as well as a trio of current teachers, will perform at a variety fundraising concert on November 29.</p>
      <p>The event is called Performing For Andre and will raise money for Andre Van Rooyen, the former Mid Canterbury Tennis coach who is battling Stage 4 lung cancer and having costly drug treatment.</p>
      <p>Mr Van Rooyen's wife, Debbie, is the Gateway co-ordinator at Ashburton College and the concert is being promoted and supported by the college and tennis communities.</p>
      <p>On stage will be singers, dancers, bands and there's also a bit of comedy thrown in.</p>
      <p>The MC for the event is Ashburton College deputy principal Ron Cresswell, who is also a performer, as is dance and drama teacher Jack Hanrahan and dance teacher Hannah Wakelin.</p>
      <p>Former students taking to the stage include Jack Bubb, who is at jazz school in Christchurch, Libby Higson, who has just graduated from NASDA, Luke Glendining and Lucy Clough.</p>
      <p>Talented students include singer Ocean Waitokia, hip-hop group leader Carl Cayanan and polyfest group leader Sonia Stephens-Tahuri.</p>
      <p>Two college rock bands will also play.</p>
      <p>Ashburton College head of senior school Claire Bubb said the concert was set to be a great night of entertainment.</p>
      <p>There would be a wealth of talent on stage and the goal was to raise $10,000 for the Van Rooyen family, enough to fund Mr Van Rooyen's drug treatment for a month.</p>
      <p>All performers would come together as a collective to sing a special finale song for the guests of honour.</p>
      <p>The evening would also include a number of auctions.</p>
      <p>Food and drink prizes had been donated by Somerset Grocer, Speight's Ale House, Cleavers Corner and Robert Harris Cafe.</p>
      <p>Mid Canterbury tennis coach Jack Tiller had given coaching vouchers and there was wood from Jag Firewood.</p>
      <p>"This event is about supporting the Van Rooyens during this very difficult time, creating memories for them, and raising as much money as we can,'' said Mrs Bubb.</p>
      <p>The Ashburton College Auditorium is the venue for the concert.</p>
      <p>An eftpos will be operating on the night and donations can be made to support Mr Van Rooyen's treatment.</p>
      <p>Tickets ($20) can be bought from the college office, or by calling 308 4193.</p>
