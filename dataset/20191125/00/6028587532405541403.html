      <p>The Nintendo Switch is such a massive hit for the iconic gaming company that it does not feel the need to bend over backward to dole out many Black Friday deals this holiday season. The result is the common appearance of a $299 Switch bundle, which is how much it costs anyway, but with the added bonus of getting <i>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</i> with it for free, which Nintendo is still valuing at $60. But the problem with Nintendo’s Black Friday deals is not just that this bundle is relatively vanilla, it’s that they are using it to move old stock of a worse version of the Switch, one that comes with lower battery life than the current model. I’ve <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2019/11/08/a-warning-about-every-nintendo-switch-black-friday-deal-in-2019/#62065d926f43">already issued one warning about this</a>, but as we get closer to actual Black Friday, I thought it was relevant to bring this up one more time.</p>
      <p>If you go on Nintendo’s <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20191107005345/en/">official Black Friday deal site</a>, you will see an asterisk that leads to the following:</p>

      <p>That means all the Switch models in these Mario Kart bundles are the only unit with lower battery life. The new model of the Switch, HAC-001(-01), has a battery that lasts from 4.5 to 9 hours instead, a significant increase, particularly when these two models effectively cost the same price. For reference, the Switch Lite, which is $199 pretty much everywhere, even on Black Friday, has 3-7 hours of battery, and there are no variants of better or worse battery life for that model.</p>

        <figcaption>BANGKOK, THAILAND - 2018/04/27: In this photo illustration, a turned on Nintendo Switch with 2 ... [+] Joy-Con attached on it and a Pro Controller. The Kyoto based video game company Nintendo ended its comeback year with revenue worth $9 Billion after a glorious 2017 notably with the launch of the hybrid console the Nintendo Switch, mini retro vintage game consoles such as the Nintendo Entertainment System and Super Nintendo as well as its mobile phone video games. Also Nintendo will welcome its new president Shuntaro Furukawa in the month of June 2018.

      <p>I would not buy this bundle, no matter which store you see it in. I would look for a normal, new Switch because that extra 2-2.5 hours of battery life in handheld mode is really going to be significant as you play. In order to find the model that <i>does</i> have the better battery life, you want to look for:</p>
      <p><b>HAC-001(-01)</b> model</p>
      <p>NOT HAC-001</p>
      <p>And for a serial number that starts with:</p>
      <p>
        <b>XKW</b>
      </p>
      <p>NOT XAW</p>
      <p>Otherwise, you are going to be getting the one with lower battery life. I do not believe there is anything on the box <i>besides</i> these numbers and letters to indicate how much batter you’re getting, so you are going to need to be very careful. (<b>Update</b>: actually for non-bundles, you are looking for a pure red package that is different than <a href="https://www.cnet.com/how-to/make-sure-you-dont-buy-the-wrong-switch/">the more white package, according to CNET</a>, but I would still check those numbers.)</p>
      <p>If there was some super steep discount for the old model of the Switch for $100-150 off, I may consider trading the battery life for the savings. And yet with these bundles giving you just one free game you may or may not even want, I don’t think it’s worth it to pick one up, as you’re better off with a Switch Lite or looking for the better battery model instead. Happy hunting.</p>
