      <p>Redskins rookie quarterback Dwayne Haskins missed the final play of his first career win Sunday because he was too busy taking “selfie” photos with fans.</p>
      <p>“How do miss the last snap of a game because ur taking selfies,” <a href="https://twitter.com/Theismann7/status/1198730525692825601?s=20">tweeted Redskins legend Joe Theismann,</a> who before the season gave Haskins his blessing to wear his former No. 7. “That’s unprofessional &amp; wrong.”</p>

      <p>Haskins was 13 of 29 for 156 yards (no touchdowns and one interception) in the Redskins’ home victory over the Lions before missing the kneel-down thanks to his poorly timed photo op.</p>
      <p>Backup Case Keenum came into the game with Haskins out of the picture.</p>
      <p>“I was so hype, I broke a water bottle,” <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/28156636/redskins-qb-dwayne-haskins-misses-final-snap-take-selfie-fan">Haskins told reporters</a>. “I look up and we’re in victory. I thought the game was over with already, but I’ll get it next time.”</p>
      <p>Interim head coach Bill Callahan said the team was looking for Haskins to take the snap.</p>
      <p>“I think he thought the game was over,” Callahan said. “I think he thought it was over. So yeah, I’ll have to find out a little bit more.</p>
      <p>He added: “No, I don’t laugh at it. I’m happy we won. We’ll address that.”</p>
      <p>Haskins, the former Ohio State star, has struggled in his first season and is 1-2 as a starter.</p>
