      <h3>Rockoon</h3>
      <p>Los Angeles startup Leo Aerospace is developing a system that could allow spacecraft to launch after being dropped from massive hot-air balloons at 60,000 feet, <a href="https://www.space.com/balloon-launch-rockets-leo-aerospace.html"><i>Space.com</i> reports</a>.</p>
      <p>The high altitude balloon platform, called Regulus, features multiple thrusters to maintain its orientation. A special rail system attached underneath allows rockets up to 33-feet in length to be launched, saving the fuel required to get to the balloons’ elevation.</p>
      <h3>Rocklets</h3>
      <p>The relatively small rockets have a maximum payload of just 126 pounds.</p>
      <p>The entire Regulus system, including the balloon and a rocket, can fit inside a 40 foot shipping container and be placed on semi-trucks, ships, and even airplanes, according to the <a href="https://www.leoaerospace.com/regulus-platform">company’s website</a>.</p>
      <p>The company gave a brief presentation of their concept during the U.S. Air Force’s first Space Pitch Day earlier this month. The company received $750,000 from the Air Force at the event.</p>
      <h3>Thin Air</h3>
      <p>Individual launches will be pretty expensive, at least to start — about one to three times as much as “ride-share” rockets from the likes of SpaceX charge, according to <i>Space.com</i>.</p>
      <p>The company claims to start testing its high-altitude platform in mid 2020. Even without rockets to launch, the balloon could help test technology for future missions to Mars, as the thin air at high altitudes can provide a good Mars analogue, according to <i>Space.com</i>.</p>
