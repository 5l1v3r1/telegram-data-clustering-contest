        <b>Eden Hazard faces one of his most important matches for Real Madrid versus PSG this Tuesday. He will have Idrissa Gueye in the opposition, a person he played with at Lille. The Senegalese midfielder talked about his former teammate in an interview with 'Marca'.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/real-madrid">Real Madrid</a> will try and get first place in the group against <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/paris-saint-germain-fc/">Paris Saint Germain</a> on Tuesday. To do that, <b>they will need Eden Hazard to be at his best</b>, who arrives after playing spectacularly for Belgium during the international break. Against the Parisians, the attacker will have to overcome <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/i-gueye-52664/">Idrissa Gueye </a>amongst others,<b> a player he played with at Lille</b>. </p>
      <p><b>The PSG midfielder was one of the standouts </b>of the encounter in France which the Parisians won 3-0. In an interview with 'Marca', Gueye spoke after <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/e-hazard-21292">Eden Hazard's</a> qualities, <b>who he says he would sign "without doubt" for his team</b>. </p>
      <p>"We played together and when we were young, he looked a cut above the rest. He was very strong, <b>he was playing for the first team</b> even though he was younger than us and when he dropped to the second XI,<b> it was a pleasure to watch him train</b>," Gueye recalled. </p>

      <p>"<b>I'm not surprised how much Hazard</b> has achieved, we are friends and we keep in touch. He was always encouraging me when I was struggling to break into the first team saying to me: <b>'I have to play with you in the first team</b>. And we did that. He knew how to do everything, score and give assists, he was very good," the Senegalese continued.</p>
      <p>That said, he does not want comparisons to be made between the Belgian and Cristiano Ronaldo: "<b>Cristiano is Cristiano</b>, Hazard has to write his own story at Real Madrid." <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/c-ronaldo-28185">Cristiano</a> is an example for everyone and <b>has to be an inspiration also for him</b>, to do the best he can."</p>
      <p>And lastly, speaking about the Portuguese star, Gueye sees Real Madrid capable of returning to the level they were at when Cristiano was there: "<b>They are capable of winning the Champions League without Cristiano</b>. At Real Madrid, other great players always come and in addition, there are others who have won the Champions League.<b> Real Madrid are Real Madrid</b>."</p>
