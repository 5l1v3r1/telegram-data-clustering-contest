      <p>Indian hospitality startup Oyo and British private equity firm Apax are the latest entrants in the race to acquire a stake in Cafe Coffee Day, sources told <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/food/oyo-apax-join-race-for-significant-stake-in-ccd/articleshow/72215692.cms">The Economic Times.</a></p>
      <p>Earlier this month, the newspaper reported that Bain Capital, KKR and TPG Capital were in the running to pick a stake in the Bengaluru headquartered coffee chain. The companies have reportedly begun talks and have signed non-disclosure agreements with <a href="http://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/food-processing/coffeedayenterprises/CDE">Coffee Day Enterprises</a>.</p>
      <p>Of the five suitors, Oyo is the only bidder with a presence in a similar business. In August, the SoftBank-backed company launched a coffee chain, The French Press, with two outlets in Delhi and Bengaluru.</p>
      <p>Sources also told ET that while some bidders were looking to acquire the CCD brand, others also were interested in the company's wider operations.</p>
      <p>As per reports, around 500 CCD outlets have been shuttered across the country since April to counter declining profits and was a part of the company's divestment process.</p>
      <p>On November 13, Coffee Day Enterprises, which runs the CCD coffee chain, announced a delay in release of Q2 results. The company's total debt as of August 17 stood at around Rs 4,970 crore.</p>
