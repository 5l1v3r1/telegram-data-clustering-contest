      <p>Samsung’s long been a supplier of mobile devices for the enterprise market, but the business to business (B2B) market has always taken a back seat to consumer mobile.  The B2B market outlook took a surprising turn for the better at this year's Samsung Developer Conference (SDC19). The keynote on the second day highlighted B2B customers, use cases and technology innovation.</p>
      <p>Key announcements from the event included the new rugged Tab Active Pro, a refresh of the B2B partner program, AppStack to deliver Knox-verified apps, a partnership with IBM Cloud and developer tools to support building apps across the Samsung ecosystem. You may be asking yourself what the big deal is? The B2B market represents the future growth engine for Samsung and many other mobility vendors. While the consumer team has to focus on making swoon-worthy devices, the B2B team has to focus on developing an overall approach to servicing enterprise mobility that spans from hardware encryption to partner ecosystems. </p>
      <p>The work isn’t sexy, but it can lead to solid results. Samsung holds 20-25% of the overall global mobile market share, but its B2B business goes mostly untracked. Samsung shared that in the B2B market, it has a billion devices installed and serves 15,000 enterprises on a global basis with a 20 percent growth rate. The U.S. market represents 40 percent of Samsung’s B2B revenues. Taher Behbehani, Samsung’s SVP and GM of Mobile B2B, said the enterprise market represents a massive opportunity for Samsung, its app developers, and its ecosystem partners. Behbehani's keynote highlighted three main factors that showcase the opportunities head. Samsung said: </p>
      <p>1.    <b>The device landscape continues to grow.</b> While consumer smartphone and tablet growth have slowed in general, not all markets are created equal. For example, Samsung B2B doubled its sale of tablets this past year.  Enterprises are refreshing tablets, rugged devices and PCs. Samsung's making an aggressive play to win the industrial and purpose-built devices category. Also, many companies bought mobile devices and products, five or seven years ago, and these are now up for a refresh. </p>
      <p>2.    <b>Changes in the software requirements will drive changes in hardware.</b> Companies want to use smart software to automate processes, and this software requires intelligent devices. Even companies that have a comprehensive mobile device portfolio plan to upgrade to gain advanced processing power to run artificial intelligence models on device  asmore applications. Multiple cameras and enhanced software also allow companies to support improved scanning, augmented and virtual reality. </p>
      <p>3.    <b>5G and IoT will drive a new generation of B2B use cases and growth.</b> Maybe a consumer can’t figure out why they need 5G, but the combination of connected equipment and low-latency, high bandwidth networks unlock a plethora of new enterprise opportunities. With sensors and 5G, companies are looking at use cases such as connected factories, fixed wireless access, and drone-based inspections. McKinsey predicted the total economic impact of IoT applications could reach as much as $11.1 trillion globally by 2025<i>  </i>through energy savings, productivity improvements and labor efficiencie<i>s.  </i>For example, factories are likely to see the most significant potential impact from IoT use, with nearly $4 trillion in operational efficiency savings. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Next-generation mobility enables efficiency and innovation</b>
      </p>
      <p>Smartwatches, smartphones and tablets continue to change how work gets done from improving the customer experience to preventing equipment failures. Companies are finally embracing a more holistic view of how smart devices, the Internet of Things and 5G can drive better business outcomes. For example, Samsung highlighted the following customer use cases:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Kaiser Permanente</b> Patient readmissions cost the U.S. healthcare system $41.8 billion per year. Kaiser wanted to decrease patient readmission and it worked with Samsung to create an easy way for physicians to remotely monitor patient treatment plan adherence and provide feedback to the patient. Kaiser Permanente supplied 2300 patients with Samsung Galaxy watches and a specialized app. The results showed 87% of these patients completed their program compared to only 50% without the smartwatch. </li>
        <li><b>Public safety.</b> Fire departments are using drones, Samsung Galaxy devices and software developed by the Air Force to monitor fires. The Chicago Police Department is rolling out a pilot of Samsung’s DeX in Vehicle solution, providing officers the ability to dock their Galaxy smartphones and access policing applications on a dash-mounted display and keyboard.</li>
        <li><b>HBSC.</b> According to research by Celent, the second reason customers switch banks is due to "poor branch experience."  Yet, 77% preferred face-to-face engagement with their bank for complex financial discussions. To tackle this problem, HSBC created an app for the Galaxy watch that allows bank personnel to greet the customer, find out what they are looking for and route the customer to the appropriate staff member.</li>
        <li><b>Magna. </b>As the world's third-largest distributor of auto parts and $40 billion company, Magna wanted to create modern manufacturing organization to reduce downtime. The company’s Smart Factory initiative combined mobility, AI, IoT and VR-based training. Magna uses Samsung tablets to send alerts to maintenance personnel wearing Gear S3 smartwatches, enabling near real-time response. Behehbani told the audience that faster access to alerts using Samsung products helped Magna reduce downtime by 6%, resulting in savings of $431,000 per year.</li>
        <li><b>Medtronic. </b> The healthcare leader took the stage to talk about how the company innovates with mobility and Samsung. Medtronic worked with Samsung to create a dedicated, customized smartphone to support a new Medtronic patient programmer system. The system allows patients to perform deep brain stimulation therapy at home. Meanwhile, at the hospital, the clinician is using the new Galaxy TabS2 to help patients manage their treatment.  </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>What’s missing in B2B? Developers need to address the "App Gap."</b>
      </p>
      <p>We’ve discussed enterprise mobility for more than a decade. What’s holding us back? Samsung said there’s $75 billion in GDP lost annually based on a lack of modern applications. Behehbani shared that developers are telling Samsung the B2B market requires specific products for the use case. Developers and customers want to be able to customize the hardware and software. Samsung also believes it can help consumer developers understand the specific requirements of the enterprise market. To help developers drive apps sales, Samsung is providing an enterprise marketplace called AppStack, which launched at SDC19. While Samsung didn't name it an enterprise app store, it acts like one. It provides B2B SaaS and native app discovery, purchasing, and delivery for Knox-validated<b> </b>B2B applications.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>
        <b>Can Samsung pull it off?</b>
      </p>
      <p>While the strategy is sound, the war to solidify its position as a B2B powerhouse still up for grabs. Apple gained an early lead in the space, especially in the bring-your-own-device (BYOD) category of the B2B market. In June, Apple announced a more in-depth portfolio of enterprise management features and enterprise software partners. Yet, Apple’s focus remains with the consumer and enterprise buyers frequently tell Lopez Research that they’d like to see Apple up its business efforts. Given the current landscape, Samsung has several opportunities to drive its success in the enterprise market, including:</p>
      <p>1.    <b>Semi-custom devices.</b> Philosophically, Apple won’t touch customization and rugged vendors such as Panasonic and Honeywell have typically been too expensive and unresponsive to the market. Samsung can win the customization business, but it must find a way to achieve this while maintain a decent margin. </p>
      <p>2.    <b>The power of the portfolio</b> Samsung's portfolio extends well beyond the smartphone to PCs and displays. Samsung has started to leverage the power of its overall portfolio to support new use cases in general businesses, restaurants and retail stores with video walls, commercial displays and live interactive whiteboards. The company also offers a smart digital signage platform enabling developers to extend their experience from mobile devices to larger screens. If Samsung can work with customers on a solution that includes a portfolio of Samsung products, it can create better value for its customers, business partners and itself.</p>
      <p>3.    <b>Mobile management and security with KNOX.</b> In the latest Verizon's study of Enterprise Security, a third of enterprises admitted to seeing security events from a mobile device.  Additionally, 67% were less confident about the security of their mobile assets than other devices. These statistics bode well for Samsung who’s considered the gold standard for Android mobile security. For example, Knox 3.x currently has five U.S. government certifications, including common criteria certification and FIPS 140-2. The company also hired, Terry Halvorsen, the former Chief Information Officer at the U.S. Department of Defense, highlighting its commitment to providing best-in-class security. Knox suite allows developers to create unique solutions for Samsung devices with robust security and manageability. For example, developers can access and control APIs beyond what's in the underlying Android operating system. There are 1 billion devices secured by Knox today.</p>
      <p>4.    <b>Enterprise app and solution provider partnerships.</b> Sure, Apple has partnerships with SAP, IBM and Salesforce. But Apple by no means has a lock on enterprise partnerships. Samsung spoke of its work with Citrix, Microsoft, SAP and VMware. Can Samsung and the developer community build application experiences that work better on Samsung devices? At SDC19, Samsung highlighted examples with Medtronic and BlueJeans. It worked with BlueJeans for custom integrations of S-Pen control for video and a privacy setting that allows the person to strip out their background, creating a more immersive experience.</p>
      <p><b>Behbehani -</b> <b>“It’s time to change the game”</b></p>
      <p>In an interview at SDC19, I asked Behbehani why he thought Samsung would be successful now and what developers should know. He told me that, “It’s time to rewrite the game in mobile. It’s been over a decade that the industry has been doing things the same way. Samsung B2B wants to shake up the status quo. We want to help our application developers and partners deliver break out innovation. We are serious about making it easier for developers to work with us. When it's a complex challenge that requires innovation and teamwork, we're the right partner for the job. We don’t have all of the answers, but we’re working with developers and partners to build a new community and a new way of doing business.”</p>
      <p>I fully agree that it’s time to move to the next wave of mobility. Consumer mobility brought better user experiences and created advanced hardware such as multiple cameras and foldable screens. However, employees and businesses will become first-class citizens of the mobile era in this next wave of innovation. Leading companies and developers will leverage a toolkit of mobile, AI, IoT and cloud computing to deliver contextual, adaptive and predictive applications.</p>
