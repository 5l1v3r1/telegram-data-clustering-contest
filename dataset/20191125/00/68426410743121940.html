      <p>Israel’s attorney-general said Monday that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is not required to leave office following his indictment on corruption charges, giving a small boost to the embattled leader.</p>
      <p>Avichai Mandelblit said in a statement that Netanyahu can remain interim prime minister, just days after serving him with charges of fraud, breach of trust and bribery.</p>
      <p>Netanyahu faces calls from his opponents to step down following the indictment. Mandelblit’s opinion confirmed what had been a consensus legal view, that an indicted prime minister may remain in office while fighting criminal charges.</p>
      <p>Israeli law requires other public officials, including Cabinet ministers, to resign if charged with a crime. But it doesn’t explicitly state that a prime minister has to leave office in those circumstances.</p>
      <p>Netanyahu is the first-ever sitting prime minister to be charged with a crime.</p>
      <p>The attorney-general did not weigh in on whether Netanyahu could keep his other ministerial positions while under indictment. Netanyahu also holds the agriculture, labour and welfare, health and Diaspora affairs portfolios.</p>
      <p>Netanyahu, Israel’s longest serving prime minister, has dismissed the charges as an “attempted coup” and refused to resign. He says he will fight the charges from the prime minister’s office.</p>
      <p>The indictment comes at a delicate time following the failure by both Netanyahu and his chief rival, former military chief Benny Gantz, to secure a parliamentary majority and form a new government.</p>
      <p>Israel has held two parliamentary elections this year – in April and in September – both of which resulted in political deadlock, with neither Netanyahu nor Gantz capable of mustering support for a ruling coalition.</p>
      <p>Last week Gantz conceded he was unable to form a government, setting in motion a 21-day period for a majority of Israel’s 120-seat parliament to throw support behind Gantz, Netanyahu or a third candidate.</p>
      <p>If a government is not formed by Dec. 11, Israel will be forced to hold elections for the third time in a 12-month period.</p>
      <p>The Justice Ministry said the attorney-general did not evaluate the legality of whether the president could task an indicted politician with forming a new government, which he said remained “theoretical.”</p>
