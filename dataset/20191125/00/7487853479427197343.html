      <p>​Real Madrid host Paris Saint-Germain on Tuesday evening seeking revenge for the 3-0 humiliation they suffered at the Parc des Princes in September.</p>
      <p>Madrid know a victory would secure a place in the next round of the Champions League, while they will also look to right the wrongs of the reverse fixture in which the Spanish giants were torn apart.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, PSG have already qualified but if they were to earn a point or more at the Bernabeu, they would guarantee top spot in Group A.</p>
      <p>This clash of titans is another mouthwatering fixture served up by this year's Champions League group stage, and it proves a difficult game to call. </p>

      <p>The most recent outing was back in September when Real Madrid fell to a 3-0 defeat in Paris - a performance which was much maligned by the Spanish media. Zinedine Zidane will look to alleviate some of the pressure on himself with a far more positive outcome this time round.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Recent Form</h3>
      <p>​Los Blancos' form has been much better in recent times, having won five of their last six matches and losing only once since the reverse fixture against PSG.</p>
      <p>Zidane's side have started to play with the swagger that Madrid fans are accustomed to, scoring 18 goals in their last five fixtures with a happier looking starting lineup. They currently sit second in La Liga and in <a href="https://www.90min.com/leagues/la-liga">​Champions League</a> Group A.</p>

      <p>PSG are in fine form of late with nine victories from their last ten matches. The return to fitness of Neymar, Mbappé and Cavani will only boost the confidence of the French side, with a ridiculous amount of quality building within their squad.</p>
      <p>PSG's last outing was a straightforward 2-0 win over last year's Ligue 1 runners-up Lille, a game in which Mauro Icardi and Angel Di Maria continued their great goalscoring form.</p>
      <p>Here is each side's last five matches:</p>

        </tr>
      </table>

      <h3>Prediction</h3>
      <p>It's highly unlikely that we will see a similar performance from Real Madrid to that of their humbling defeat in the last encounter between the pair. Zidane's side seem to have got their act together since then and a number of key individuals such as <a href="https://www.90min.com/players/luka-modric">​Luka Modric</a> and <a href="https://www.90min.com/players/eden-hazard">​Eden Hazard</a> are returning to form.</p>
      <p>With the home advantage, Madrid will be confident of getting a crucial victory which would see them qualify for the next round with a game to spare.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>PSG will be in high spirits too, and will aim to resurrect the kind of performance they exhibited back in September's meeting. The return to fitness of their front three, as well as the fantastic form of Icardi and Di Maria, means Thomas Tuchel is spoilt for choice up front.</p>
      <p>It will be a close encounter with both sides aiming to assert their attacking dominance in Europe once more.</p>
