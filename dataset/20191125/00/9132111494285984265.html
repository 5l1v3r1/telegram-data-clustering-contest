      <p>Political activist and Kufuor Scholar, Kabu Nartey has been adjudged the 2018 Best Student Journalist at the 24th Ghana Journalists Association (GJA) Awards held at the Kempinski Hotel Gold Coast City, in Accra, over the weekend.</p>
      <p>The former student leader makes history by becoming the first to win this category as part of GJA’s 70th Anniversary which was on the theme “Democracy, freedom and independence of the media in Ghana : 70 years of GJA’s contribution”. He was among some 78 practicing journalists and veterans awarded for their exceptional role in national development through the pen and the microphone.</p>
      <p>The activist was tipped as the obvious choice for the award having consistently aired his views on politcal leadership through thought-provoking articles published weekly on ghanaweb.com and other online media.</p>
      <p>Kabu Nartey recently graduated from the Ghana Institute of Journalism with a first class honours. He also received two awards - the best student in print journalism and the most promising student journalist.</p>
      <p>Barely a month after, he began a weekly publication on political issues in the country with a famous tagline ‘Patriotic Epistles with Kabu Nartey’. He has since written on very topical subjects advocating for good governance, patriotism and responsive leadership.</p>

      <p>In an interview, Kabu Nartey said the recognition came as a surprise as he did not see it coming after his recent graduation, adding that “ it is a boost to his earnest search for inner patriotism for my beloved country”. He acknowledged Akushika Acquaye of GTV for her mentorship when he first worked as an intern at the state broadcaster. Next were his lecturers at GIJ and his colleagues who shaped his dream in diverse ways.</p>
      <p>The GJA Best Student Journalist award was introduced recently to inspire and motivate journalism and communications students across the country who are already impacting their society and nation through through works.</p>
      <p>The special guest of honour for the 24th GJA Awards was the Vice President, Dr Mahamudu Bawumia.</p>
