      <p>Shayna Baszler defeated Bayey and Becky Lynch in a fitting victory that completed the narrative of NXT’s domination throughout the main show of Survivor Series. With Baszler’s win, NXT won four of the five interpromotional matches on the main show as WWE looks to build on the momentum of it its <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alfredkonuwa/2019/11/21/wwe-nxt-scores-first-ratings-win-over-aew-dynamite-with-star-studded-show/">first win of the Wednesday Night Wars.</a></p>
      <p>Though there was no shortage of highlights for NXT, Baszler’s main event win was not as much of a highlight as the result would suggest. By the end of a third consecutive night of WWE shows, and following a highly emotional WWE Championship match between Rey Mysterio and Brock Lesnar, fans in the Allstate Arena were exhausted.</p>
      <p>With limited energy and very little to get excited about in a paint-by-the-numbers contest, the highly anticipated Triple Threat between Bayley, Baszler and Lynch died a slow death.</p>
      <p>Headed into their surprising main event, Bayley vs. Shayna Baszler vs. Becky Lynch always felt like it carried more weight in terms of which women’s division—and not necessarily which brand—WWE valued the most.</p>
      <p>Becky Lynch is WWE’s top star, though she competes on Raw which has become the de facto B-show following SmackDown’s move to Fox. Bayley is a newly minted heel on WWE’s A-show of Friday Night SmackDown. And while Shayna Baszler competes on NXT, universally viewed as WWE’s third brand, she has been booked as a virtually unbeatable champion dating back to her second reign in October of last year.</p>
      <p>WWE did quite the balancing act in making all three women look strong headed into Survivor Series, including multiple ambushes and invasions from all three champions.</p>
      <p>This past Wednesday Becky Lynch and Rhea Ripley battle to a non-finish on NXT as WWE looked to keep both top women’s stars strong. The political maneuvering implied in that finish made for some added intrigue as to what direction WWE would go on a theoretically neutral field with its three women’s champions.</p>
      <p>With Survivor Series quickly taking on a pro-NXT feel, Baszler’s win felt more meaningful to NXT as a whole rather than a personal achievement, especially after Lynch attacked Baszler shortly after her win.</p>
      <p>Survivor Series went off the air with Lynch as the lasting image.</p>
