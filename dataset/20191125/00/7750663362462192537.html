      <p>It was a sixth defeat in nine games for the Toffees that leaves them just four points above the drop zone <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/premier-league/table.html">in 15th</a>.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <i>Sky Sports News</i>, former Everton striker Campbell said that he was struggling to see how the Portuguese boss could turn things round after Saturday's performance.</p>
      <p>Campbell said: "The writing's on the wall, you've got to be realistic and hold your hands up - if the project or plan ain't working then there's no harm in rejigging the plan.</p>
      <p>"Do you keep letting it hurtle towards the wall or do you redirect it and start making things happen?</p>
      <p>"That's what the club ultimately going to have to do and it's going to take some strong leadership at the top and an element of ruthlessness.</p>
      <p>"It's very difficult to come back from this and I don't see just how he's going to do it."</p>
      <p>Everton face a difficult run of games before the end of 2019, with next weekend's trip to Leicester City followed by consecutive games against Liverpool, Chelsea and Manchester United.</p>
