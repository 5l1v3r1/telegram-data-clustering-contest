      <h1>Rutherford back but not today</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.odt.co.nz/author/Adrian%20Seconi" target="_blank">Adrian Seconi</a></address>
      <p>Experienced opener Hamish Rutherford will probably miss Otago’s match against Canterbury at Hagley Oval today.</p>
      <p>But the 30-year-old left-hander is free from concussion symptoms and is expected to play a part later in the week.</p>
      <p>The former test opener was hit by England fast bowler Jofra Archer earlier this month, while playing for New Zealand A.</p>
      <p>He missed the Volts’ opening two games but has returned just in time for a key period in the campaign.</p>
      <p>The next three rounds of the Ford Trophy are all being played in Canterbury this week.</p>
      <p>The Volts start with Canterbury today then move to Lincoln on Wednesday, for a match against Auckland. They will complete the stretch with a rematch against Wellington at Bert Sutcliffe Oval on Friday.</p>
      <p>The competition will take a break at the end of the week. The teams will turn their focus to the Super Smash which gets under way on December 13.</p>
      <p>The Volts have named a squad of 13 players. It is same 12 which fronted for the five-wicket loss to Wellington in Queenstown last week, plus Rutherford.</p>
      <p>Otago coach Rob Walter said Rutherford was a definite for Wednesday.</p>
      <p>"Once you’ve been cleared by the doctor there is three days you’ve got to do progressive training on. Monday’s too tight for that," Walter said.</p>
      <p>Rutherford has been in such good touch and has got himself back into contention for the national side. His presence will strengthen the line-up.</p>
      <p>He will join Nick Kelly at the top. Kelly has been impressive in his first two games for the province. He scored a century in the win against Northern Districts and top-scored with 65 in the loss to Wellington.</p>
      <p>Add the likes of Neil Broom, and the promising Dean Foxcroft, and Otago’s top five looks solid.</p>
      <p>Fast bowler Michael Rae remains sidelined with his hip complaint.</p>
      <p>"He is coming on well but it is still difficult to know when he’ll be able to run in and bowl at 100%. He is certainly improving daily which is a good thing," Walter said.</p>
      <p>In his absence, Blair Soper will get another opportunity. The left-armer got a breakthrough in his maiden over in the format but was a little wayward.</p>
      <p>"It was his debut, so I assume there was a little bit of nerves. He provided a breakthrough which we needed but, like most of our bowling line-up, was not right on the mark.</p>
      <p>"He was a little too full, I guess. But he’ll use that as an experience and will be better next time."</p>
      <p>Walter said Otago won two of the three games it played during the same stretch last year and "we’ll definitely look to go one better this time".</p>
      <p>That will set the team up nicely for the back-end of the tournament when it will host three of the five remaining games in Dunedin.</p>
