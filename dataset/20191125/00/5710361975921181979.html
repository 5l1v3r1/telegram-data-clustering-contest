      <p>By Chuck Mikolajczak</p>
      <p>(Reuters) - The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq indexes climbed to new record highs on Monday as signs indicated the United States and China were moving closer to a trade truce, while a host of merger deals also helped buoy sentiment.</p>
      <p>A Chinese state-backed tabloid said Beijing and Washington were "very close" to an initial pact, and lifted trade-sensitive semiconductor stocks, including Applied Materials Inc (O:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/applied-matls-inc">AMAT</a>), up 3.98% and Lam Research Corp (O:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/lam-research-corp">LRCX</a>), which gained 2.42%. The Philadelphia Semiconductor index (<a href="https://www.investing.com/indices/phlx-semiconductor">SOX</a>) jumped 2.32% and was on pace for its best day in just over three weeks.</p>
      <p>Nvidia Corp (O:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/nvidia-corp">NVDA</a>) rose 4.59% and paced the gains on the chip index as Morgan Stanley (NYSE:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/morgan-stanley">MS</a>) upgraded its shares to "overweight" from "equal weight".</p>
      <p>The report came on the heels of comments over the weekend by a top U.S. official that an agreement was still possible by the end of the year, dampening worries the negotiations could spill over into 2020.</p>
      <p>"Any optimism on the trade front is always welcome," said Keith Buchanan, portfolio manager at Globalt in Atlanta.</p>
      <p>"Hopefully what is taking place is a signal that without a derailment coming into the end of the year, from a trade perspective, everything else seems to be somewhat intact and you can tack on incremental positives, whether it is M&amp;A, or macroeconomic data."</p>
      <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average (<a href="https://www.investing.com/indices/us-30">DJI</a>) rose 142.01 points, or 0.51%, to 28,017.63, the S&amp;P 500 (<a href="https://www.investing.com/indices/us-spx-500">SPX</a>) gained 19.52 points, or 0.63%, to 3,129.81 and the Nasdaq Composite (<a href="https://www.investing.com/indices/nasdaq-composite">IXIC</a>) added 104.78 points, or 1.23%, to 8,624.66.</p>
      <p>Apple Inc (O:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/apple-computer-inc">AAPL</a>) rose 1.18% as the top boost to the S&amp;P and Nasdaq and the second-biggest lift to the price-weighted Dow Jones Industrial Average.</p>
      <p>Gains on Monday were broad with only the defensive consumer staples (<a href="https://www.investing.com/indices/s-p-500-consumer-staples">SPLRCS</a>) and utilities (<a href="https://www.investing.com/indices/s-p-500-utilities">SPLRCU</a>) S&amp;P sectors in the red. Tech (<a href="https://www.investing.com/indices/s-p-500-information-technology">SPLRCT</a>) gains helped push the Nasdaq (<a href="https://www.investing.com/indices/nasdaq-composite">IXIC</a>) up by more than 1 percent, with the group on pace for its best day since Nov. 1.</p>
      <p>Tiffany &amp; Co (N:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/tiffany---co">TIF</a>) jumped 6.29% and was the biggest gainer on the S&amp;P 500 as the luxury jeweler agreed to a sweetened $16.2 billion deal to be acquired by France's LVMH (PA:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/l.v.m.h.">LVMH</a>).</p>
      <p>U.S. discount brokerage TD Ameritrade Holding Corp (O:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/td-ameritrade-hol">AMTD</a>) was up 6.03% after larger rival Charles Schwab Corp (N:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/charles-schwab">SCHW</a>) said it would buy the company in an all-stock deal valued at about $26 billion. Schwab rose 1.19%.</p>
      <p>EBay Inc (O:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/ebay-inc">EBAY</a>) gained 2.05% after the e-commerce major said it would sell ticketing unit StubHub to ticket reseller Viagogo for $4.05 billion in cash.</p>
      <p>Major averages on Wall Street have reached a series of new highs recently on hopes for progress of a trade deal and third-quarter corporate earnings came in better than lowered expectations.</p>
      <p>Failing to participate in the advance, Uber Technologies (N:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/uber-technologies-inc">UBER</a>) slipped 1.44% as the ride-hailing company was stripped of its license to carry paying passengers in London for the second time in just over two years.</p>
      <p>Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.96-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.17-to-1 ratio favored advancers.</p>
      <p>The S&amp;P 500 posted 35 new 52-week highs and 1 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 119 new highs and 51 new lows.</p>
