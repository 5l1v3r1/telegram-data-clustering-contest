      <p><b>In order to cope with increasing requests for air quality tests at Government-owned buildings islandwide, the Ministry of Health and Wellness has ordered additional equipment required to conduct the inspections, the South Eastern Regional Health Authority (SERHA) told the Jamaica Observer.</b> <br/><br/>“There has been a recent increase in demand for these kinds of investigations and SERHA is aware of this. We are in the process of procuring these equipments to allow for investigations to be done in a more timely manner,” SERHA said.   <br/><br/>The Observer had posed questions to SERHA in regard to the shortage of equipment following statements made by the Kingston and St Andrew Public Health  Department at a recent meeting of the Kingston and St Andrew Municipal Corporation (KSAMC) Parish Disaster and Public Health Committee. <br/><br/> At the meeting, Public Health Officer Derron Williams said the shortage of equipment to do the air quality tests on “sick buildings” had resulted in long delays, sometimes a month or more, before the inspections could be done.  <br/>In September, two police departments located in a building at 34 Duke Street, downtown Kingston, were ordered closed by the commissioner of police because of poor air quality.<br/><br/>In response to questions from the Observer, SERHA said that investigations for matters relating to indoor air quality were generally conducted by the parish health department in collaboration with the Ministry of Health and Wellness, occupational safety and health specialists, and the chief environmental engineer from the National Public Health Laboratory (NPHL). <br/><br/>SERHA  said that the local health department can only conduct preliminary tests and more detailed tests must be done by the NPHL.<br/><br/>The equipment being ordered are three hand-held carbon dioxide temperature and humidity monitors, three concrete moisture meters, three field chemical test kits with pump and tubes, three hand-held portable particulate matter meters, and three total volatile organic compound monitors.<br/><br/>SERHA said that it was “awaiting approval from the Ministry of Health and Wellness for the ones we have identified, to finalise the process”.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, in regard to the shortage of vehicles at the KSA Public Health Department, SERHA told the Observer that “the health department now has six vehicles that are used to assist in conducting vector (including mosquito) control activities and the region, as well as the ministry, are in the process of acquiring additional vehicles.<br/><br/>Public health inspectors are all travelling officers and as such are required to carry out most investigations utilising their own vehicles. Assistance with transportation is provided when the officers are going into areas that are not accessible by regular transportation.</p>
