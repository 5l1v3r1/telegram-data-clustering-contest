      <h1>Pride on way to another final</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.odt.co.nz/author/gordon.findlater%40starmedia.kiwi" target="_blank">Gordon Findlater</a></address>
      <p>Canterbury United Pride put in a strong performance over the weekend to secure a spot in the National Women's League final.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the Dragons also fought hard but recorded their second straight draw in the men's competition.</p>
      <p>The Pride, which are the defending champions, confirmed their spot in the final with two rounds remaining after a 3-0 win over WaiBop at English Park on Saturday.</p>
      <p>They took the lead after a Gabi Rennie drive at WaiBOP goalkeeper Georgia Candy deflected onto the post and in.</p>
      <p>Candy’s afternoon didn’t get any quieter from there as she worked hard behind a stubborn WaiBOP defence to keep her team in the game with some athletic saves.</p>
      <p>Nicola Dominikovich slotted a classy finish on the stroke of half-time. She then got another from a Candy error to make it three late in the second half.</p>
      <p>The Pride now head to Auckland this weekend to face the Northern Lights which they are likely to meet again in the final. However, a win for the Pride would give them a home final.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, the Dragons had to settle for a draw at home to a determined Hawke’s Bay United, which came from behind to briefly take the lead before Juan Chang equalised 1min later.</p>
      <p>Cory Mitchell put the Dragons in front in the first 5min but Hawke’s Bay made the most of the action towards the end of the half.</p>
      <p>Ahinga Selemani equalised and then Sho Goto gave Hawke’s Bay the lead, a fine reward for the visitor's hard work. But Chang’s goal ended the scoring at two-all, in spite of both keepers having a busy last 20min.</p>
      <p>The draw means the Dragons are seventh in the 10-team competition with five points from four games, but just two points outside the top four.</p>
      <p>They will travel to the capital to play Team Wellington this weekend.</p>
