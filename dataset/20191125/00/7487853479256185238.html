      <h1>Steve Bruce Admits 2018 Cabbage Incident Left 'Unsavoury' Taste in His Mouth</h1>

      <p>​Newcastle manager Steve Bruce has admitted that having a cabbage thrown at him during his time with Aston Villa was one of the lowest moments of his career.</p>
      <p>Towards the end of his ill-fated spell with Villa in 2018, Bruce had attracted plenty of criticism for his side's struggles, but one fan opted to take it one step further and launch an entire cabbage at Bruce during a 3-3 draw with Preston North End – possibly remembering the ancient Greek tradition of using the large-headed leafy vegetable as a laxative as Preston ran through Villa. </p>

      <p>Speaking ahead of his side's meeting with <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/aston-villa">​Villa</a> on Monday (via <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/football/newcastle-united/story/3997905/newcastle-boss-bruce-aston-villa-fan-throwing-cabbage-very-unsavoury">​ESPN</a>), Bruce admitted that the whole ordeal had left somewhat of a bad taste in his mouth. A bad taste. Cabbage. See?</p>
      <p>"It was one of the most unsavoury <i>[ed's note: lol] </i>times of my career," Bruce confessed. "I thought it was a ball to begin with, it was a big old thing.</p>
      <p>"How the fan got it into the stadium I don't know. It didn't miss me by much. The fans can throw some things, but a cabbage? I went the next day, though, so I didn't have time to get angry about it."</p>

      <p>Poor Bruce. He must be carrying some real emotional cabbage heading into the game. Oh, sorry, emotional <i>baggage</i>.</p>
      <p>The fan was just frustrated by Villa's leek-y defence back then, but things have certainly turn(ip)ed around since then. </p>
      <p>How? Well, lettuce explain.</p>

      <p>Following Bruce's departure, Dean Smith came in to steady the ship and managed to guide the Villains to the playoffs, where they emerged victorious to earn their place in the <a href="https://www.90min.com/leagues/premier-league">​Premier League</a>. However, they do find themselves down in 17th this year.</p>
      <p>As for Bruce, after a brief spell with <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/sheffield">​Sheffield Wednesday</a>, he moved on to <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/newcastle">​Newcastle</a> in the summer. The Magpies currently sit 14th, but they could move up to ninth with a win on Monday evening.</p>
