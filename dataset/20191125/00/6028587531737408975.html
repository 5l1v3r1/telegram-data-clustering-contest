      <h1>LG’s Black Friday 2019 TV Deals: Huge OLED And LCD Savings Available Now</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">John Archer</a></address>
      <p>Black Friday is just a few short days away now. So as is becoming increasingly customary, some of the big TV brands have already started selling their sets at heavily discounted prices.I’ve already brought you <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnarcher/2019/11/09/samsung-black-friday-2019-tv-deals-full-range-of-massive-savings-now-revealed/#36d8e1752bd3">the full list of Samsung’s Black Friday savings</a>, and now it’s the turn of LG.</p>
      <p>For many serious AV fans, LG’s OLED TVs are THE hot ticket of any Black Friday season. Their combination of stunning contrast, wide viewing angles, and rich colors is the stuff of home cinema legend. The only problem is that, traditionally, OLED TVs cost more - significantly more - than the majority of LCD TVs.</p>
      <p>Which is precisely why, of course, they become so popular in sales season. And I’m pleased to say that this year LG has piled on the price cuts like never before, even going so far as to make one of its 55-inch 2019 models available for just $1,199. </p>

      <p>What follows is a full list of LG’s latest, already-available OLED deals as listed on <a href="https://www.lg.com/us">LG’s US website</a>, together with some brief explanation of how each range differs from the rest. Note that this list does not include LG’s Z9 8K OLED TV (<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnarcher/2019/10/23/lg-oled88z9-and-75sm9970-75sm9900-8k-tv-reviews-ones-incredible-the-other-isnt/#4fa5ea052ebd">reviewed here</a>) or LG’s wallpaper-thin W9 series, as LG doesn’t appear to be giving them any direct Black Friday discounts. </p>
      <p>I’ve also added LG’s LCD deals below the OLED models. While these include some massive discounts, though, I would caution that you only buy one of them if you have a pretty bright living room, as the IPS technology they use can cause black level and backlight clouding issues in dark rooms.</p>

        <b>
          <u>LG B9 Series</u>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>These are LG’s entry-level OLED TVs for 2019. They differ from LG’s more expensive OLED ranges by getting the second generation of LG’s Alpha 7 processor, rather than the more powerful second-gen Alpha 9 processor. This means the B9 pictures aren’t quite as bright or contrasty, and aren’t quite as consistent and refined when it comes to color. </p>
      <p>Pictures still look beautifully cinematic for such affordable (during Black Friday, anyway) TVs, though, causing some real headaches for the sort of upper mid-range LCD TVs that used to exclusively own the sort of price points the B9s are now assaulting.</p>

          <u>LG C9 Series</u>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>The C9 models for me represent the sweet spot in LG’s 2019 OLED range. They’re the cheapest point at which you get LG’s second generation Alpha 9 chipset, which brings with it impressive picture performance enhancements in the areas of contrast, brightness, HD upscaling and color. And when you’re talking about a TV technology as innately good as OLED, it seems to me that you really want to try and get the processing that unlocks the maximum quality from it. </p>

        <figcaption>The LG OLED65C9 is being handsomely discounted from now through Black Friday.<cite>Photo: LG Electronics</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The C9s also enjoy a slightly smarter design and a more powerful Dolby Atmos sound system than the B9s. </p>
      <p>You can find a review of the OLED65C9 <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnarcher/2019/04/28/lg-oled65c9-c9-review-knocking-on-heavens-door/#374f10551e05">here</a>.</p>

          <u>LG E9 Series</u>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Picture wise, the E9s are identical to the C9s. Where they differ is in their design and sound quality (as well as, of course, their price).</p>
      <p>The E9 design is gorgeous, featuring as it does a beautiful glass screen backing that stretches right down to the surface of the furniture the TV is resting on. The sound improvement sees a narrow but remarkably powerful speaker under the screen delivering forward-firing, room-filling sound, supported by Dolby Atmos decoding that even gives the sound stage an effective sense of height. </p>
      <p>The sound system has been completely redesigned from 2018’s E8 range, and in conjunction with LG’s new AI Sound mode it really does deliver exceptionally powerful results.</p>

          <u>LG UM6900 Series 4K TVs</u>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>These are the cheapest 4K models in LG’s 2019 LCD range to be receiving Black Friday discounts directly from LG itself. As you might expect, these sets are fairly basic, with edge LED lighting and no local dimming. They still get LG’s webOS smart system, though, along with a Quad Core processor and basic HDR10 and HLG HDR support. </p>
      <p>The UM6s may be relatively basic LCD TVs, but they’re priced accordingly. Especially for Black Friday…</p>

      <p>These are also edge-lit models with no local dimming, and you still just get support for the industry standard HDR10 and broadcast-friendly HLG HDR formats. The UM7s still get a Quad Core processor, too. But you do here get a more premium design and access for the first time in the range to LG’s extensive voice recognition support, which covers LG’s own ThinQ AI system, Google Assistant, and Amazon Alexa.</p>

      <p>These are edge LED models, but their edge LED lighting systems still enjoy a degree of local dimming. These sets also mark the point where the second generation of LG’s Alpha 7 processor comes into play, along with support for both Dolby Vision HDR and Dolby Atmos sound playback. As their name suggests, the Nano 8 series also, crucially, mark the point at which you get LG’s NanoCell wide color technology. </p>

The 75 and 86-inch models both use a more sophisticated local dimming system to take account of their larger pictures. </p>

          <u>LG 75SM9970 8K TV</u>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>While LG’s OLED 8K TV sadly isn’t currently receiving any Black Friday discounting from LG, the brand’s one and only debut 8K LCD TV is. As with the 4K models, the set uses NanoCell technology to deliver some beautifully vivid colors, while its powerful 8K-optimized Alpha 9 Gen 2 processors deliver exceptional upscaling of 4K and even HD sources to the screen’s 8K native pixel count.</p>
      <p>It gets all of the webOS smart features you’d expect of any LG TV, as well as the same Dolby Vision HDR and Dolby Atmos support provided on its OLED siblings. But strangely the backlight issues associated with its IPS panel seem particularly hard to ignore in the context of this set’s 8K resolution.</p>
