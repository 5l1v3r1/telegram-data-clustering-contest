      <p>A memorial for the late Goo Ha-ra, a K-pop diva and member of girl band KARA, is set up for her fans at Seoul St. Maryâ€™s Hospital in Seoul on Nov. 25, 2019, separately from one installed for her bereaved family members at another hospital. She was found dead at her home the previous day, with a high chance of suicide as the cause of death. (Yonhap)</p>
