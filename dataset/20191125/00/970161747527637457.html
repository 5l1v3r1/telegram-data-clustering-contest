      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/rylan-clark/">Rylan Clark-Neal</a> has defended himself after critics argued he shouldn’t talk about politics on social media.</p>
      <p>The Strictly: It Takes Two presenter is set to co-host Channel 4’s Alternative Election Night show as the results of the General Election pour in on the night of 12 December, and he has also been very vocal about politics on Twitter in the past.</p>
      <p>However, this has come with its fair share of criticism, with Rylan receiving ‘a few snobby-a***d comments’ from critics, most notably as a result of a tweet he made about <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/brexit/">Brexit</a> earlier in the year.</p>
      <p>‘Politics is something I’ve been interested in for a long time,’ he told <a href="https://www.bigissue.com/">The Big Issue</a> magazine. ‘More now than ever because of Brexit.’</p>
      <p>The 31-year-old has revealed he feels ‘no pressure to fit in a box others want to put [him] in’ and has instead decided to call those out who criticised him, as he hopes talking about politics helps those who ‘might not necessarily understand Brexit’.</p>

      <p>‘I decided to call them out on it thinking actually, you’re a f*****g idiot, because I was a 30-year-old man who’s not in politics and I’m the sort of person you should be tapping into,’ he continued.</p>
      <p>‘With all due respect, the audience that I’ve got might not necessarily understand Brexit or what’s going on in Parliament.’</p>
      <p>Rylan added that when he usually tweets about political stuff on Twitter, he receives messages of support from fans who thank him for explaining things they might not have understood.</p>

      <p>‘You can take the p*** out of me all you want, but I’m probably informing the people who follow more than you’re informing people,’ he added.</p>
      <p>However, the TV personality has stated that he is keeping quiet on who he is backing in the upcoming General Election.</p>
      <p>‘It means I can talk to people in a rounded way that probably does more good than it would if I told people how to vote.’</p>
      <p>He also admitted that he will continue to ‘stick up’ for what he believes in, but he is not going to tell people what to do as a result.</p>
      <p>It comes after Rylan revealed last week <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/rylan-clark-neal-joins-krishnan-guru-murphy-channel-4s-election-night-coverage-11178412/">he will presenting Channel 4’s coverage of the General Election</a>, joining co-presenters Krishnan Guru-Murthy and Katherine Ryan.</p>

      <p>‘So yeah…. This X Factor reject will be hosting election night. Lols,’ he wrote on Twitter.</p>
      <p>Also appearing in the eight-hour programme will be Clare Balding, Matt Forde and Rob Finder.</p>
