      <p>LOS ANGELES - After seven years of litigation, McDonalds has agreed to pay $26 million to thousands of McDonalds workers in California to settle a class-action lawsuit brought in Los Angeles County Superior Court which alleges that the fast-food giant didnt give workers overtime pay nor give them proper meal breaks. <br/><br/>The lawsuit, which was first filed back in 2013 by a McDonalds employee in L.A., claimed that McDonalds structured its timekeeping in order to avoid California laws regarding overtime pay. It also keep employees from taking meal breaks. <br/><br/>About 38,000 people are represented in the suit, according to CNN. <br/><br/>While we continue to believe our employment practices comply with the California Labor Code, we have decided to resolve this lawsuit filed back in early 2013, the company said in a statement obtained by the Associated Press. With this settlement, the parties have reached a mutually acceptable resolution and have submitted the settlement to the Court for its review and approval. <br/><br/>In response to the deal, workers were holding a rally Monday afternoon at a McDonalds located at 101 West Manchester Avenue in South L.A. <br/><br/>McDonalds cheated us out of tens of millions, but by standing up and speaking out, were holding the worlds second largest employer accountable for breaking the law, said McDonalds employee Rosario Mercado in a statement through Fight for $15, an advocacy group. <br/><br/>The lawsuit also alleges that McDonalds didnt reimburse employees for cleaning and ironing their own uniforms, according to the Fight for $15. <br/><br/>Last week, McDonalds reached a similar settlement in a lawsuit in New Zealand which could see it pay up to $29 million for miscalculating holiday pay going back to 2009. As many as 60,000 New Zealand workers there could be affected. (Source: CBSLA)</p>
