      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.90min.com/users/15416614" target="_blank">Ewan Murray</a></address>
      <p>​Bayern Munich travel to Serbia to take on Red Star Belgrade this Tuesday as Champions League action returns.</p>
      <p>The Germans have already qualified for the next round of the Champions League, but a victory would secure top spot in Group B.</p>
      <p>The current Bundesliga champions come in to this game off the back of successive 4-0 league victories against rivals Borussia Dortmund and struggling Fortuna Dusseldorf.</p>
      <p>Red Star will be aiming to pull off a shock at Stadion Rajko Mitic, a stadium where they defeated European champions Liverpool last season. Their 4-0 home defeat to Tottenham last time out means they are highly unlikely to qualify, but they do need a victory to keep hopes alive and will still be aiming to finish third which would see them drop in to the Europa League.</p>

      <p>The reverse fixture on 18 September saw Bayern triumph in a resounding 3-0 victory in Munich courtesy of goals from <a href="https://www.90min.com/players/thomas-mueller">​Thomas Muller</a>, Robert Lewandowski and Kingsley Coman.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Recent Form</h3>
      <p>Bayern have won all three of their games under new coach Hansi Flick, scoring ten and are still yet to concede having shown remarkable improvements since the departure of Niko Kovac.</p>
      <p>The German side have won six of their last seven matches in all competitions and have picked up maximum points in <a href="https://www.90min.com/categories/champions-league">​Champions League</a> Group B so far. </p>

      <p>Their last outing was a 4-0 victory over Fortuna Dusseldorf - a game which surprisingly didn't see talisman Lewandowski score for the first time in the league this season.</p>
      <p>Red Star have won their last two matches, keeping clean sheets in both, and are undefeated since their 4-0 loss to Spurs on 6 November.</p>
      <p>Here is the last five fixtures for both sides:</p>

      <h3>Prediction</h3>
      <p>While the trip to Red Star is always a difficult one, Bayern should have little trouble dispatching Tuesday's opponents. </p>
      <p>The Hansi Flick revolution is well underway, and while he may not be the long-term option for Bayern, he is certainly getting the best out of his squad at the moment.</p>

      <p>Red Star will have the difficult job of stopping Europe's in-form attacker in Lewandowski, and the key to stopping Bayern is to halt the progress of the Polish striker.</p>
