      <p>“Five years ago, hardly anyone had heard of femtech. Before, saying the word ‘vagina’ in a meeting could raise eyebrows and perpetuate decades-old stigmas,” says 43-year-old CEO and co-founder of Elvie Tania Boler. “Now most investors are aware of femtech and the issues we’re looking to solve, so there’s been an explosion of different kinds of businesses.”</p>
      <p>Elvie, a technology company focusing on the health of new mothers, was launched in 2014, along with Alexander Asseily, founder of wearable products company Jawbone.</p>
      <p>“My original intention wasn’t to set up a business,” Boler recalls. “But in May 2013 after winning an Innovate UK Grant for £100,000, Elvie was born.”</p>
      <p>Boler previously worked for the U.N. on global sex education curriculums, but didn’t start Elvie until she had a baby herself, and found there was little support for new mothers in the UK.</p>
      <p>“Women’s health has been underfunded and undernourished by the medical community for years,” Boler explains. “We’re on a mission to empower women to talk more openly about their health and to seek support and treatment, even if it means standing up and tackling decades-old taboos.”</p>
      <p>Boler says her company Elvie campaigns “relentlessly” so that “no-one feels they have to suffer in silence”.</p>
      <p>“We put women back in control of their health with our technology products.”</p>
      <p>Boler says the breast pump is the world’s first silent pump, and her aim is to make breastfeeding less taboo.</p>
      <p>A survey commissioned by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/nov/02/third-of-women-feel-embarrassed-breastfeeding-in-public-survey-finds">Public Health England</a> showed that 74% of mums were afraid that breastfeeding could cause pain, with 63% afraid of feeling embarrassed to breastfeed in front of other people.</p>
      <p>Elvie’s breast pump doesn’t come in cheap: it retails for around $499. Boler aims to launch a further eight products by 2020.</p>
      <p>In 2018, Elvie’s other product, a pelvic floor exerciser, was made available nationwide in the UK following a deal with the NHS, meaning women can now use the device at no cost. Incontinence is estimated to cost the NHS in the region of £233 million ($299 million) each year in treatment costs. As many as 80% of expectant and new mums are experiencing<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6486304/"> pelvic floor problems</a> after giving birth, and only 28% of those with urinary incontinence seek medical help.</p>
      <p>“After having my first baby, I was seeking a way to regain my confidence as a woman and was told by my pilates instructor to do pelvic floor exercises,” Boler says. “But, like many women, I struggled to know if I was doing them right or if they were even making a difference. After a little digging, it quickly became apparent that there hadn’t been much technological innovation in pelvic floor health at all.”</p>

      <p>Femtech is valued to be worth<a href="https://venturebeat.com/2018/03/08/frost-sullivan-femtech-could-become-a-50-billion-market-by-2025/"> £40 billion ($51 billion) by 2025</a>, and Boler is determined to ride the new wave.</p>
      <p>“The vision is to be the global hub for connected health and lifestyle products for women,” Boler says. “We want to improve women's lives through smarter innovation, bringing them out of the dark ages, and empowering them to talk openly about women’s health issues.”</p>
