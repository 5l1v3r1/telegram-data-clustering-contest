      <p>Minister of works and housing, Samuel Attah-Akyea, has said that with the recent development and improvement in the country within three years “Ghana does not need a return of a prodigal son.”</p>
      <p>According to him, the mess created in the financial sector by the previous government has cost tax- payers over 33 billion. This he says could have been used for infrastructural development.</p>
      <p>He therefore called on Ghanaians to retain Akufo-Addo particularly because has proven enough that he knows how to handle the economy of this country within a period of just 3 years.</p>
      <p>He added that the vision of Akufo-Addo is to specialize in growing the economy competently and not to specialize on wining an election.</p>
      <p>“The lousy way the NDC run the country and economy previously has occasioned this colossal sum which would have been used for developmental purposes, of you add the cost of cleaning the financial sector challenges to the long list of government bill that Akufo-Addo government had to settle, it cost the Ghanaian tax payer 33 billion, so the budget is telling us who the prodigal son is.” He said “If government can do this development in 3 years, can we imagine what government can do in 8 years? If Akufo completes the 8 years you will see changes in the economy which will grow to benefit the people of Ghana”</p>
      <p>“Ghana doesn't not need the return of prodigal son, Ghana needs the return if a good man who knows how to handle the economy and turn around the fortunes of this country.” he added Speaking on the floor of parliament, the MP reiterated their commitment to face-lifting Mamobi-Nima as government intends to redevelop and transform the slums into ultra-modern and resilient housing communities.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, the Works and Housing Minister, Samuel Atta Akyea, announced that slums including Nima will soon get a face lift.</p>
      <p>According to him, government is set to construct a world class residential apartment and also provide them with "flushing toilets" for the first time.</p>
      <p>He was quick to add that residents of Nima slum won't be affected by the move, there will be no dislodgement. Government using two budget show how incompetent government is - A.B.A Fuseini (I dont get this one)</p>
      <p>Planting for food and jobs: Government lied we never imported food – A.B.A Fusieni (ermm this one is not clear, cos he is NDC, is he disproving or approving? - as in we imported food or never imported food?)</p>
