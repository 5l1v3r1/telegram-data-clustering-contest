      <p>Last episode saw Angela overdose on an entire bottle of Nostalgia, leading to the prolonged flashback of this week’s “This Extraordinary Being,” revealing the origin story of Hooded Justice, a character whose identity was shrouded in mystery in the comics. As Laurie attempts to convince Angela to consent to getting her stomach pumped, her grandfather’s memories begin to impose on her reality; the hallucinations and loss of identity are about to push Angela’s sanity to breaking point. It must be a terrifyingly bad trip, but she needs answers, and Will isn’t about to explain himself anytime soon.</p>
      <p>Will’s origin story, fittingly depicted in black and white, shows how he joined the police force under the illusion of justice, but soon discovers that he isn’t considered a legitimate police officer; the uniform can’t hide the color of his skin.  </p>
      <p>Upon witnessing a white shopkeeper, Fred, casually firebombing a Jewish bakery, Will places him under arrest, but Fred doesn’t even pretend to be intimidated. This episode certainly doesn’t shy away from depicting the racist hellscape of the time period, but there isn’t much room for subtlety; Fred is almost like a caricature of a racist man - he practically spits tobacco in Will’s face while singing slurs and strumming a banjo. </p>
      <p>While in the police station, Fred proudly goes off on a racist tangent, and Will’s fellow police officers act horrified, demanding Fred apologize to Will, but one of them gives a strange hand signal as he leads Fred away. </p>
      <p>Of course, Fred isn’t really in trouble, as the police force is a deeply racist institution, with many of the officers being members of the Klan. While walking home, Will is approached by the same officers, who invite him for a friendly beer. After declining, the true intention of the officers is revealed.    </p>
      <p>This episode is beautifully shot, as stylized as a comic book, layering Will’s memories to show how history tragically repeats itself. Angela’s sense of identity flickers in and out, to remind us that she’s trapped inside her grandfather’s past. </p>
      <p>Will is lynched by the police officers, in an intense scene shot from his perspective, under the hood. Will’s life is spared, the lynching a warning, but the dreadful injustice sparks something inside of him, and while wearing the hood, along with the noose around his neck, he encounters a mugging and unleashes his rage on the muggers. </p>
      <p>Of course, this is the origin story of Hooded Justice, a mysterious character in the comics rumored to be a German circus strongman, retconned here to reflect the theme of the show. Damon Lindelof surely read <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/danidiplacido/2019/11/19/alan-moores-brutal-superhero-critique-digested/#338251a47f80">Alan Moore’s blunt critique</a> of the superhero genre, specifically this paragraph:</p>
      <p>“... save for a smattering of non-white characters (and non-white creators) these books and these iconic characters are still very much white supremacist dreams of the master race. In fact, I think that a good argument can be made for D.W. Griffith’s Birth of a Nation as the first American superhero movie, and the point of origin for all those capes and masks.”</p>
      <p>It’s an interesting creative decision, to show the Minutemen inspired by a black man, but the team, or the world, unwilling to acknowledge it, the in-universe television show even whitewashing Hooded Justice into a handsome white man.</p>
      <p>In a nice little detail, Will’s “whiteface” makeup even mirrors Angela’s black makeup, both coming from a place of fear, the desperate need to protect their identity. </p>
      <p>Will’s wife, June, encourages him to pursue masked vigilantism, but she isn’t particularly happy when the leader of the newly formed Minutemen, Nelson Gardner, A.K.A. Captain Metropolis, invites Will to join the group. </p>
      <p>Will and Nelson’s relationship soon turns sexual, but it’s obvious that Will is being used by Nelson to attract publicity, the Minutemen uninterested in crime-fighting, focused on building a profitable brand, which rests on the public perception of Hooded Justice being a white man. </p>
      <p>Thus, Will is a complicit member of two racist organizations, the police force and the Minutemen, unable to change the flawed system from within. Is it any wonder he’s angry? </p>
      <p>Speaking of which, June keeps telling Will that he’s suffering from anger issues, which is odd, because he’s perfectly calm throughout the entire episode, except when acting as Hooded Justice. His brutal beatings and shootings come across as rather understandable, seeing as the man has repeatedly been crushed under the boot of white supremacy; if anything, he seems to be doing a great job at keeping things together. </p>
      <p>Regardless, Will goes on an especially violent rampage after discovering that the Klan, named “Cyclops,” is using a mind-control device to incite riots among the black community. Again, the sight of Will shooting costumed Klan members, especially after being refused help by the Minutemen, doesn’t seem all that unreasonable in context, but Will isn’t happy with what Hooded Justice has become. </p>
      <p>Returning home, Will is horrified to find his son donning his face paint, and washes it off, self-aware enough to understand that he’s on a destructive road that he doesn’t want his son to follow. But June has had enough of Will’s “anger issues,” and promptly leaves him, taking their son with her. </p>
      <p>It’s really strange that we never see Will being angry without the hood, or at home with June; perhaps there was a worry that the audience would lose sympathy with him? This episode, while generally well-executed, has a very, umm ... “black and white” depiction of morality. There’s almost no examination of subtle, systemic racism, just one good-hearted individual in a world full of unapologetic racists. Nelson is the closest thing we have to a “well-meaning racist” but he’s pretty on-the-nose too.  </p>
      <p>Will, now an old man, having inspired a movement of costumed crime-fighters that he was utterly erased from, seems to have learned from his enemies, and is utilizing the mind-control technology to coerce Judd into hanging himself. Will seems to understand that racism is entrenched deep in society, and whatever he is planning with Lady Trieu surely involves the mind-control device. </p>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.hbo.com/content/dam/hbodata/series/watchmen/peteypedia/06/lady-trieu-fact-or-fiction.pdf">Peteypedia</a>, Trieu has sent “newly legalized HDTVs to every residence in the tri-county area,” which might just be the first step in mass-mind control, seeing as the effect is administered through strobe lighting. </p>
      <p>Finally, Angela wakes from her coma, finding herself captive to Lady Trieu. It’s unclear what happened with Laurie and the rest of the FBI (again, <a href="https://www.hbo.com/content/dam/hbodata/series/watchmen/peteypedia/06/blake-memo-actual-work.pdf">Peteypedia reveals</a> that Laurie recorded Angela “sleep-talking,” and discovered the true identity of Hooded Justice). </p>
      <p>But it’s unclear why the FBI would allow Trieu to take over. Intriguingly, we can’t be sure if Angela really has escaped Will’s memories; some of his flashbacks were in color, and this scene might be Will’s first encounter with Trieu, rather than a real-time Angela experience. </p>
      <p>This was an enjoyable, unique episode that boldly rewrites the history of the Minutemen, but clumsily depicted the racism of the time period, as well as Will’s supposed anger issues. I also missed Adrian Veidt’s weird side-story, but to be fair, this episode wasn’t the place for it. </p>
      <p>It’s difficult to judge <i>Watchmen</i> episode-by-episode; I’m really enjoying the slow-burning mystery, but the meaning of the story rests on the execution of the finale. Sometimes it seems like Lindelof really understands the original material, and other times, it seems slightly off. </p>
      <p>Either way, I like the fact that the show has stood apart from the comic, and isn’t re-telling the same story. It’s not canon to the <i>Watchmen</i> universe as far as I’m concerned, but it’s definitely trying to do something unique.</p>
