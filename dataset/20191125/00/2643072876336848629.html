      <p>President <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/23/president-buhari-storms-out-of-apc-nec-meeting/"><u><b>Muhammadu Buhari</b></u></a> has condemned what he described as the “heinous murder” of a Kogi State <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/24/kogi-frustrated-dino-melaye-will-lose-again-apc-tells-pdp/"><u><b>Peoples Democratic Party (PDP)</b></u></a> Women Leader, Mrs Achejuh Abuh.</p>
      <p>In a State House statement on Sunday by his media aide, Mr Femi Adesina, Buhari called on security agencies to fish out her killers.</p>
      <p>The president described Mrs Abuh’s killing as a “primitive behaviour” that should not be condoned.</p>
      <p>Buhari said: <i>“President Muhammadu Buhari expects scrupulous investigation into the heinous murder of Madam Achejuh Abuh, Women Leader of the People’s Democratic Party in Wada/Aro campaign council, in the just-concluded gubernatorial election in Kogi State.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“The President decries whatever could spur anyone to take the life of another human being, particularly a woman, who was burnt to death in her home in the most gruesome manner.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“President Buhari charges all security agencies involved in the investigation to do a thorough and expeditious job on the matter so that justice could be served without fear or favour.”</i>
      </p>
      <p><i>“We must learn to behave decently, whether during elections or at other times. No life should be taken wantonly under any guise, and the fact that this reprehensible act occurred two days after voting shows primitive behaviour, which should not be accepted in a decent society”,</i> Buhari added.</p>
