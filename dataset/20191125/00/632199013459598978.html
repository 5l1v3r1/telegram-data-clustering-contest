      <p>Subaru has launched a new Forester, which comes with an E-Boxer hybrid engine.</p>
      <p>The new model has undergone a thorough refresh and now features advanced driver assistance systems and enhance off-road capability.</p>
      <p>It is 20mm wider and 30mm longer than the outgoing variant and the increased exterior dimensions provide more space between the front and more legroom..</p>
      <p>The E-Boxer combines a 2.0-litre petrol engine with an electric motor. A lithium-ion battery unit is mounted within the boot floor and allows for pure-electric driving at speeds of up to 25mph.</p>
      <p>Power-split adjusts according to the driving condition and alternates between three driving modes: EV driving, Motor Assist driving and Engine driving.</p>
      <p>At low speeds the car is powered by the electric motor alone for quiet, zero emission driving. It can drive in full electric mode for distances of about a mile. Subaru says this is normally experienced in urban conditions with stop-and-go traffic where a 10% improvement in fuel economy can be seen compared to the outgoing variant.</p>
      <p>At medium speeds, the motor and the engine work together to improve power and performance. At higher speeds Forester E-Boxer is driven solely by the petrol engine. According to speed and driving conditions, the engine will recharge the battery in preparation for the next use.</p>
      <p>The electric motor assist and battery pack are aligned longitudinally with the heavy motor placed near the vehicle's centre of gravity. The battery and other components are positioned above the rear axle which balances the weight to improve handling.</p>
      <p>Body strength has been increased by 40% compared to the outgoing Forester allowing the frame structure to absorb more energy in the event of a collision and the more rigid framework reduces noise and vibration while contributing to more responsive steering.</p>
      <p>A new Driver Monitoring System uses facial recognition technology to detect if the driver’s gaze has wandered or if the driver is dozing off and alerts occupants if this occurs.</p>
      <p>It also uses personal recognition to adjust vehicle settings such as the seat position, door mirror angle, display screen content and air conditioning for up to five different drivers.</p>
      <p>The new Forester has a combined mpg figure of 34.7 and has CO2 emissions of 154g/km.</p>
      <p>Prices for the new model start at £33,995 for the XE trim and £36,995 for the XE Premium.</p>
