      <p>THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) - Retired Dutch football star <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/marco-van-basten/">Marco van Basten</a> has been benched for a week by Fox Sports for saying “sieg heil” on air.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/marco-van-basten/">Van Basten</a>, working as an analyst, was off camera on Saturday when he used the German phrase for “hail victory” that became notorious for its use at Nazi rallies.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/marco-van-basten/">Van Basten</a>, who made the comment after a German coach had been interviewed by a reporter, apologized later in the show.</p>
      <p>Fox Sports said in a statement on Monday that it distanced itself from the comment, which the broadcaster called “stupid and inappropriate.”</p>
      <p>Fox says it will not use <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/marco-van-basten/">Van Basten</a> as an analyst this week and will donate his fee to a Dutch institute to promote knowledge about World War II.</p>

      <p>After his playing career, he coached the Netherlands and other teams and was a senior official at FIFA.</p>
