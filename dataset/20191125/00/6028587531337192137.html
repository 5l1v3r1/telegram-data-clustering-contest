      <p>Google’s Advanced Protection Program (<a href="https://landing.google.com/advancedprotection/">APP</a>) is out of beta - and the company recruiting new users with freebies. Screenshots <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/11/22/google-enterprise-advanced-protection-program/">obtained</a> by a reader of 9to5Mac show Google has launched a referral program for its security program.</p>
      <p>The company is offering a free Nest Mini home speaker to existing users who refer someone to the program. This is while those who are referred to the program will receive a code to receive a free Titan Security Key bundle from the Google Store. That bundle, which <a href="https://store.google.com/cart">retails</a> for $50, includes two keys, a USB-A/NFC key and a Bluetooth/NFC fob, sufficient enough to get started on the platform.</p>
      <p>The screenshots do not detail how long the promotion will run for. We have reached out to Google for additional information on the program.</p>

      <p>The APP adds additional protections to “high risk” Google accounts - requiring a physical security device, in addition to a password, at sign-in. The program <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/11/22/google-enterprise-advanced-protection-program/">exited</a> beta in November and has since opened up to all users - including standard Gmail accounts. Google began <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/14/20913456/google-titan-usb-c-security-key-yubico-yubikey-nfc-bluetooth-fido-os-compatibility">offering</a> its own Titan Security Keys earlier this year.</p>
      <p>Those interested in joining APP need two back-up security keys to enable the feature. They do not need to come from Google, but they do need to be compatible with the FIDO U2F <a href="https://www.yubico.com/fido-u2f/">standard</a>.</p>
