      <p>After enjoying a fantastic season in which he scored five podiums and three victories, the 22-year-old Madrid rider Augusto Fernandez joins the ranks of the Belgian-Hispanic structure for the 2020 Moto2 World Championship campaign.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fernandez made his Moto2 debut at the 2017 Italian Grand Prix for Speed Up and he competed in the last thirteen races of that season.</li>
        <li>Previously he raced in the FIM CEV Repsol Moto2 and in 2014 he was crowned European Junior Cup Champion.</li>
        <li>In 2018, Fernandez raced a Kalex chassis for the Pons HP40 squad in the Grand Prix of Catalonia and he stayed with the same team for the remainder of that year before signing a permanent deal for 2019.</li>
        <li>This year, Fernandez has established himself as one of the youngest and brightest prospects in Moto2. In what was his first full season in the World Championship, Fernandez finished fifth in the overall standings, despite injury ruling him out of the Argentina and Austin rounds.</li>
        <li>He collected 207 points and took five podiums, which included three victories in Assen, Silverstone and Misano. He also took one pole position at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya.</li>
        <li>Fernández is a young rider blessed with enormous talent and determination and he has been tipped for a great future in the World Championship.</li>
        <li>During the 2019 season he has consistently demonstrated his great potential by being a regular front-runner in the new Triumph-powered Moto2 era.</li>
        <li>With the arrival of Fernandez, Team Estrella Galicia 0,0 Marc VDS completes its 2020 line-up, having already captured Sam Lowes earlier this year. It is without doubt a high-level line-up with which the Belgian-Hispanic structure aims to continue its unrivalled success in the Moto2 World Championship.</li>
