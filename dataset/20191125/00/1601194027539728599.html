      <p>For the very first time in WWE history, RAW, SmackDown and NXT collided with one another at this year's Survivor Series pay-per-view. One such match featured the women's team of all the three brands engage in a triple threat elimination match to establish brand supremacy.</p>
      <p>Captained by the 10-time Women's Champion <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/charlotte-flair">Charlotte Flair</a>, Team RAW included Natalya, Sarah Logan, and the current WWE Women's Tag Team Champions Asuka and Kairi Sane. Team SmackDown had Nikki Cross, Dana Brooke, Carmella, Lacey Evans, with <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/sasha-banks">Sasha Banks</a> as their captain. The Black-and-Gold brand presented Io Shirai, Candice LeRae, Toni Storm, Bianca Belair in their team under the leadership of <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/rhea-ripley">Rhea Ripley</a>.</p>

      <h3>WWE Survivor Series 2019</h3>
      <p>As predicted, the 15 women gave their all in to leave a mark at Survivor Series. Io Shirai and Candice LeRae of NXT were forced out of the match due to their injuries leaving the Black-and-Gold brand in a handicap situation.</p>
      <p>Team RAW imploded owing to the differences between Asuka and Charlotte Flair which ultimately led to the Red brand being the first to be eliminated. The Legit Boss and Rhea Ripley were the last women left to represent their brands and they went back-and-forth for a good amount of time. In the end, The Nightmare pinned Sasha Banks with some aid from LeRae and Shirai, thereby picking up another win for Team NXT.</p>
