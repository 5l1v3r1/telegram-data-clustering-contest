      <h1>Expect “Wise Monetisation” in Cyberpunk 2077</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Marco Cocomello</a></address>
      <p>A while back, CD Projekt RED revealed that Cyberpunk 2077 would be free from microtransactions as they set an example of how developers should treat modern games. However, it seems that could no longer be the case and the game might actually include in-game purchases in the multiplayer mode.</p>

      <p>According to the developer’s latest financial teleconference held by Piotr Nielubowitz, the Cyberpunk 2077 multiplayer mode is in early stages of development and seen as this is the developer’s first multiplayer experience, they are experimenting with all sorts of mechanics and monetisation options.</p>
      <p>During the <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2019/11/teleconference-q3-2019-financial-results.mp3">teleconference</a>, microtransactions were brought up in regards to the multiplayer mode whereas CD Projekt RED replied;</p>
      <blockquote>We believe right now it is too early to share any information on this. The multiplayer is still in very early production but we are experimenting. We check different options and possibilities. But you can expect we won’t change the general quality. Expect wise monetisation and great value for money.</blockquote>
      <p>We can take a few things out of that report. Firstly, the Cyberpunk 2077 multiplayer mode is still in very early production. We know the mode will only launch after the game’s single-player release so anything can happen there. Secondly, CD Projekt RED won’t go out of their way to force players to spend money on in-game purchases and other microtransaction nonsense. However, there is still a bit of concern about just how this monetisation will work.</p>
      <p>We know the Cyberpunk 2077 single-player mode will be free of microtransactions but just how the multiplayer mode will work is still a mystery and it is quite concerning.</p>
      <p>Catch up on the latest Cyberpunk 2077 trailer down below and prepare for the long wait. The game launches globally on 16 April 2020 for PS4, Xbox One and PC.</p>
