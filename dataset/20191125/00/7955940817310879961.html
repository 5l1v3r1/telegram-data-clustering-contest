      <p>A Christmas tree farm in South Kildare will be opening up for the festive season on Friday - just in time for the Late Late Toy Show on RTE.</p>
      <p>At the Kellehers in Brannockstown, customers can walks into the fields and choose their own tree from acres of the crop and see it cut and wrapped - ready to take home.</p>
      <p>The farm in Boleybeg, which will be open every day from 9am to 6pm right up to Christmas, also offers a delivery service available to local areas.</p>
      <p>You can also order your Christmas tree online at <a href="http://www.kildarechristmastrees.ie/">www.kildarechristmastrees.ie</a></p>
      <p>Due to underfoot conditions, customers are asked to bring their wellies!</p>
      <p>Christmas trees grown by Martin and Madeleine Kelleher and their family have graced the living rooms all over the county up to now.</p>
      <p>The average Christmas tree is about 7 foot tall and will be for sale for about â‚¬55.</p>
      <p>The Nordman Fir and Noble Fir trees are the most popular varieties followed by Fraser Fir.</p>
      <p>Madeleine told the Leader: "People tend to be going for taller trees so many homes would be looking for 12 foot trees now."</p>
      <p>Water stands and screw-in stands as well as Christmas wreaths and foliage are also available at the farm.</p>
      <p>The Kellehers, who have 50 acres of trees, have been in the growing business for more than 40 years. The tradition was first started by Martin's grandfather.</p>
      <p>This year the farm will also have a small petting zoo where children can get up close and personal with animals such as deer, goats, sheep and horses.</p>
      <p>The Kellehers operate a sustainable production system and said it takes approximately 11 years to produce an eight-foot Christmas tree from the seedling stage. <br/>Each tree that is harvested is replaced by another in January to sustain production.</p>
