      <p>After a disappointing international break, our players were back in club action over the weekend. There were some encouraging signs, with Michael Obafemi returning to the Southampton side and James McClean putting in one of his best performances over the past couple of seasons.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, Matt Doherty continues to show why he must be in the Ireland team. Here's the ratings in full.</p>
      <h3>Irish Player Ratings</h3>
      <p><b>Michael Obafemi</b> was back in the Southampton team for their 2-2 draw at Arsenal, putting in a decent performance.</p>

      <p><b>Shane Long</b> came off the bench late on.</p>
      <p>While <b>Aaron Connolly</b> missed out due to injury, <b>Shane Duffy</b> was part of the Brighton team for the loss at home to Leicester City. He got a 6/10 from the <a href="https://www.brightonandhoveindependent.co.uk/sport/football/albion/player-ratings-who-shone-and-who-struggled-for-brighton-and-hove-albion-against-leicester-city-1-9152533">Brighton &amp; Hove Independent</a>, who mentioned he did not look great in possession.</p>
      <p>Burnley hammered a hapless Watford 3-0 at Vicarage Road on Saturday afternoon with <b>Jeff Hendrick</b> continuing in his role on the right of midfield. He performed well once again at club, earning a 7/10 rating from the <a href="https://www.burnleyexpress.net/sport/football/how-did-burnley-s-players-fare-at-watford-player-ratings-from-vicarage-road-1-10119248">Burnley Express</a>. It is becoming apparent that this position suits him far better than where he been playing for Ireland.</p>
      <p><b>Seamus Coleman</b> came off the bench for the final 25 minutes of Everton's loss to Norwich City.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile <b>Matt Doherty</b> played incredibly well for Wolves in their impressive 2-1 win at Bournemouth, putting behind any doubts about his form at the start of the season. He was rated at 8/10 by the <a href="https://www.expressandstar.com/sport/football/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc/2019/11/24/player-ratings-bournemouth-1-wolves-2/">Express &amp; Star</a> who mentioned that his partnership with Adam Traore on the right flank is beginning to flourish.</p>
      <p>Wolves now sit in fifth place in the Premier League table.</p>

      <p>It was a mixed day for the Irish lads at Sheffield United, who surrendered a 2-0 lead to Manchester United before ultimately salvaging a late draw. <b>John Egan</b> missed out due to the injury he suffered in the draw against Denmark, but <b>Enda Stevens</b> and <b>David McGoldrick</b> both started the game.</p>
      <p>McGoldrick played a massive part in his side's second goal with his clever run shifting the opposition defence out of position and allowing Mousset to score.</p>

      <p>Stevens was up to his old tricks again having made a habit of nutmegging opposition players this season.</p>

      <p>Callum Robinson came off the bench late on and made a vital contribution, providing the assist for McBurnie's last minute equaliser.</p>

      <p>In the Championship, <b>Ryan Manning</b> started at left wingback for QPR in their 2-1 loss at Fulham. He was given a 6/10 by <a href="https://www.westlondonsport.com/fulham/fulham-rangers-ratings-211191">West London Sport</a> who said he looked suspect at the back.</p>
      <p><b>Josh Cullen</b> was in the Charlton team for their 2-2 draw with Cardiff City but was withdrawn before the hour mark due to an ankle injury. The player is set to undergo a scan and is not yet known how serious it is.</p>
      <p>Both <b>Alan Browne</b> and <b>Sean Maguire</b> were in the starting XI for Preston as they fell to a disappointing 1-0 defeat at Derby County. Both players were rated at 6/10 by the <a href="https://www.lep.co.uk/sport/football/preston-north-end/pne-news/pne-player-ratings-from-north-end-s-1-0-defeat-at-derby-county-1-10119462?page=3">Lancashire Evening Post</a>, with Browne playing the first half as an attacking midfielder before moving to right back in the second period.</p>
      <p><b>Darragh Lenihan</b> was back in the Blackburn side after his recent injury layoff. They secured a 3-2 win over Barnsley, getting a solid 7/10 from <a href="https://www.lancs.live/sport/football/football-news/blackburn-rovers-player-ratings-vs-17305847">Lancs Live</a>.</p>
      <p><b>James McClean</b> put in his best performance in a Stoke City jersey on Saturday leading the team to a 2-1 win over Wigan. He earned man-of-the-match honours and an 8/10 from the <a href="https://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/stoke-player-ratings-mame-diouf-3570901">Stoke Sentinel</a>, as well as a place in the EFL Team of the Week.</p>
      <p>Portsmouth's <b>Ronan Curtis</b> also earned a place in the side after scoring a brace in their 3-0 win over Rochdale in League One.</p>

      <p>Luton Town were unable to hang on for a draw at home against Leeds United, but <b>James Collins</b> did grab his sixth goal of the season. It was a decent effort, rising highest to power the ball beyond Kiko Casilla.</p>

      <p><b>Darren Randolph</b> was unable to stop ten-man Middlesbrough from blowing a two goal lead at home to Hull City, getting a 6/10 from the <a href="https://www.hartlepoolmail.co.uk/sport/football/middlesbrough-fc/joe-nicholsons-player-ratings-who-shone-and-struggled-boro-hull-city-draw-1321067">Hartlepool Mail</a>.</p>
