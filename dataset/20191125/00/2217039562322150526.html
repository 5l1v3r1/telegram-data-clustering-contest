        <b>From mid-2017 to early 2018, one exciting horse captured the imagination of Kranji racegoers - Super Fortune.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Owned by Eight Eight One Stable, the Alwin Tan-trained Australian-bred was dubbed as the next big thing with five wins - all with French jockey Olivier Placais astride - two seconds and a third from his first eights starts.</p>
      <p>The impeccable form springboarded him to the Group races.</p>
      <p>Then, suddenly, after his last victory on March 9 last year, his form went kaput.</p>
      <p>But things are looking bright again, following Super Fortune's comeback victory in the $70,000 Class 3 event over 1,200m on Friday night.</p>
      <p>The win - in a thrilling four-horse finish - ended the bay gelding's 21-run losing sequence and promises of more successes now that he has come right again.</p>
      <p>In all, Super Fortune went through 623 barren days, certainly putting his connections through really frustrating and exasperating times. Thankfully, the smiles are back.</p>
      <p>Super Fortune travelled beautifully in midfield for jockey S John on Friday night.</p>
      <p>Stablemate Special King set a good pace but was overtaken by Charger at midpoint.</p>
      <p>Charger was swamped by a wall of horses in the straight. Groenewegen, who was resuming from a 21/4-year spell, drew first blood with 200m to go.</p>
      <p>Super Fortune and the $9 favourite Federation, a last-start winner, challenged hard. From the outside, Magic Wand stormed home to make it an exciting four-way finish.</p>
      <p>It was Super Fortune who produced that extra to beat Groenewegen by a short head. Magic Wand got third, a head away and a neck in front of Federation.</p>
      <p>Tan was naturally pleased with Super Fortune's comeback victory. His decision to put back the blinkers probably helped.</p>
      <p>"I feel he was lost, that's why I decided to remove the blinkers. He also raced well without it, then thought he needs something to make him sharper," said Tan. "Last run, he got checked twice and, today, I told John to give him more daylight and he followed the instructions.</p>
      <p>"I will give him a good rest and, if possible, I will give him one more run before the New Year Cup."</p>
      <p>John said the pace was good, the little bit of "give" on the ground helped and everything worked good.</p>
      <p>Then he joked: "I think he's missing Olivier Placais on him. I tried to ride like him but couldn't. Anyway, he had a hard-luck story in his last run. Today, he got a beautiful run on the outside."</p>
