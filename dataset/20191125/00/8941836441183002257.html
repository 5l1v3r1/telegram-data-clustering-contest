      <p>WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court is rejecting an appeal from a Maryland man who wants a new trial based on information uncovered by the hit podcast “Serial.”</p>
      <p>The justices on Monday left in place a Maryland court ruling that denied a new trial to Adnan Syed, who was convicted of strangling a high school classmate he had once dated.</p>
      <p>Syed is serving a life sentence after he was convicted in 2000 of killing 17-year-old Hae Min Lee and burying her body in a Baltimore park.</p>
      <p>Syed’s lawyers had argued that his trial lawyer’s failure to investigate an alibi witness violated his right to competent legal representation.</p>
