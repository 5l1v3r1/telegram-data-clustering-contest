      <h1>Phil Jones Should Never Play for Manchester United Again - But He Probably Will</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.90min.com/users/1719980" target="_blank">Jamie Spencer</a></address>
      <p>​Imagine waiting until late November for your first Premier League appearance of the season and then getting substituted at half-time.</p>
      <p>You haven’t been injured, you’re just horribly out of favour and those 45 minutes did absolutely nothing to help your cause and prove to the manager you deserve another chance.</p>
      <p>This was the situation Phil Jones found himself in as <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/manchester-united">Manchester United</a> faced Sheffield United and ultimately drew 3-3 in the Premier League on Sunday.</p>

      <p>There is scope to claim that his withdrawal was tactical as manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer opted to shift from a back three flanked by wing-backs to a more conventional back four in order to chase the game. But Jones had been utterly hopeless in those opening 45 minutes.</p>
      <p>In the first 19 minutes alone, the 27-year-old, who appears no more polished now than when he first arrived at Old Trafford as a raw teenager in 2011, was responsible for three classic ‘Phil Jones’ moments. That needs no explanation because you already know exactly what it means.</p>
      <p>The third of those resulted in Sheffield United’s opening goal when a flailing Jones was bundled out of the way ridiculously easily by Blades forward Lys Mousset.</p>

      <p>These problems are not new – Jones has long had a reputation for being calamitous. Harsh as it may be, when he plays, fans always expect a mistake, be it a wayward pass, a misjudged header, a clumsy challenge, or a combination of all three and much more.</p>
      <p>What do people say about insanity? Doing the same thing over and over but expecting different results? Notwithstanding some early promise, United have persevered with Jones for eight-and-a-half years and still haven’t reaped anything close to benefits.</p>
      <p>It may be the reason why Solskjaer has seen fit to banish Jones to the periphery this season. Aside from Sunday, his only other appearances have come in the Carabao Cup and Europa League. He hasn’t even made it onto the bench for most Premier League fixtures.</p>
      <p>What we learned from watching Jones for just one half of football is that he shouldn’t be back any time soon. If Solskjaer has anything about him as a manager, he won’t take the decision to pick him again lightly unless there are absolutely no other options.</p>

      <p>Of the fit and available centre-backs in the first-team squad, Jones is currently fifth of five. You have to imagine that once Eric Bailly also returns from injury, Jones would drop to sixth of six.</p>
      <p>The only reason Jones started at Bramall Lane on Sunday was because Marcos Rojo was injured and Axel Tuanzebe has only just returned to fitness. With Tuanzebe later coming off the bench, it seems as though the youngster will resume his role as first alternative centre-back.</p>
      <p>Jones’ near complete exclusion this season makes the decision to hand him a new long-term contract just nine months ago all the more staggering. Jones was due to be out of contract at the end of last season, so United handed him a fresh four-year deal until 2023.</p>

      <p>Stop him leaving as a free agent so you can command a transfer fee, sure. But four years?! If anything, the club have badly hindered their chances of being able to move Jones on because handsome wages on multi-year terms will be hard for other clubs to replicate, especially when current form and poor general fitness are not exactly motivating.</p>
      <p>Will Jones play for United again? At some stage, probably. Should he? Definitely not.</p>
