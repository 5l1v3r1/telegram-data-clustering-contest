      <p>Whether you want a new GPU to power your 4K gaming PC or to improve your video encoding time, there are a lot of great graphics cards to choose from at the moment.</p>
      <p>AMD <b><a href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/hardware/312695-amd-unveils-new-processors-and-graphics-cards-south-african-pricing.html">recently launched</a></b> its RX 5700 and RX 5700 XT graphics cards, which are available from a number of local retailers. These GPUs both offer 8GB GDDR6 memory and support 4K HDR content at 144Hz.</p>
      <p>Nvidia also offers an improved lineup of <b><a href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/hardware/325371-nvidia-unveils-gtx-1650-and-gtx-1660-super.html">“Super”-branded GTX 16 Series graphics cards</a></b>, which deliver improved performance at a similar price to their previous-generation GPUs.</p>

      <h3>Processors</h3>
      <p>Intel and AMD both launched <b><a href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/hardware/312843-intel-vs-amd-battle-of-the-latest-generation-cpus.html">powerful new CPUs this year</a></b>, bringing big changes to their architecture and desktop performance.</p>
      <p>Desktop processors are constantly improving in terms of core count, clock speed, and multi-threaded performance, which often makes the latest chip on the market the best choice for PC builders.</p>
      <p>This trend holds true for Intel’s 9th-generation Core chips and AMD’s 3rd-generation Ryzen processors, which are extremely competitive in terms of pricing and performance.</p>
      <p>The two companies have also launched new high-end processors which push the limits in terms of desktop CPU performance.</p>
      <p>Whether you want a new Ryzen 3 3200G for your budget gaming rig or an Intel Core i9-9900 for your monster desktop system, Black Friday is the perfect time to pick up one of these new chips.</p>

      <h3>Solid-state drives</h3>
      <p>If there is one thing that has become clearer in modern laptop and desktop configurations, it’s that a solid-state drive (SSD) is an absolute necessity.</p>
      <p>SSDs drastically improve disk performance, affecting everything from boot times to loading screens in intensive games, and they are a key component for any respectable modern system.</p>
      <p>If you’ve been waiting to upgrade your ageing hardware to include solid-state storage, Black Friday should see a flood of price cuts on affordable 2.5-inch SATA SSDs, which are the ideal replacement for a mechanical hard drive.</p>
      <p>PCIe NVMe SSDs are a much faster option which is more expensive than SATA drives but can greatly improve performance in demanding applications.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/hardware/307304-the-10-fastest-ssds-you-can-buy-in-south-africa-2.html"><b>fastest SSDs you can buy in South Africa</b></a> include Intel’s Optane drives, Samsung’s 970 Pro 1TB, and the WD Black SN750 1TB.</p>
