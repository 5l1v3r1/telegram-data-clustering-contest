      <h1>Fake News Buster: Condom hair-tie not from JNU</h1>

      <p><b>THE CLAIM</b> <br/>With JNU students’ protest against the hostel fee hike being widely discussed on social media, many pictures with false claims are being circulated online. One such picture shows a girl’s hair tied with a condom and has been shared with the claim that the girl in the photo is a protesting JNU student. <br/><br/><b>SO, WHAT’S THE TRUTH?<br/></b><br/>The picture is misleading and was first shared on the web in 2016 and is an old meme. It was clearly not clicked during the ongoing JNU protests.</p>
