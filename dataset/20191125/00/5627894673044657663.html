      <p>HOLLYWOOD - Disneys Frozen 2 iced out the box office competition as family audiences powered the animated adventure to a dazzling $127 million domestic debut. <br/><br/>The sequel, playing in 4,440 theaters, ignited above expectations ahead of Thanksgiving, which should parlay into an especially lucrative holiday frame. <br/><br/>Frozen 2 set a November record for an animated movie and secured the third-best start for an animated film behind Incredibles 2 and Finding Dory. It also stands as the biggest opening weekend ever for Walt Disney Animation (not including Pixar) and ranks as the first animated movie to hit triple digits in its inaugural outing outside of summer. <br/><br/>This week is an undisputed win for Disney as Ford v Ferrari finished its second week in second place. <br/><br/>Also new to multiplexes, Sonys A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood kicked off in third place, a solid start given its $25 million price tag. Box office watchers expect the feel-good film will have a long run in theaters over the holidays. <br/><br/>Tom Hanks stars as Fred Rogers in A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood, a biographical drama chronicling the real-life friendship between the beloved TV personality and journalist Tom Junod (portrayed by Matthew Rhys). <br/><br/>Another newcomer, STXs suspense thriller 21 Bridges starring Chadwick Boseman, followed behind at No. 4. <br/><br/>Rounding out the top five, the war drama Midway is in its third week.</p>
