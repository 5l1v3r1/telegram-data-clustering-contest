      <h1>Liverpool Reserve Coach to Take Charge of EFL Cup Side as Jurgen Klopp Heads to Club World Cup</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.90min.com/users/15111589" target="_blank">Ed Alexander</a></address>
      <p>​Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp will travel with the first-team for December's FIFA Club World Cup in Qatar, while the club's Under-23 coach Neil Critchley is set to oversee the Reds' EFL Cup quarter-final at Aston Villa.</p>
      <p>The Merseysiders were famously left with a logistical headache after making it to the last eight of England's second domestic competition, with the Villa game scheduled for less than 24 hours before the Club World Cup semi-final on December 18.</p>
      <p>Due to the density of Liverpool's fixture list it was not possible to reschedule the EFL Cup tie, meaning Liverpool have opted for the unusual decision to name two different squads - with one remaining in England to play Villa and the other heading to Qatar for the Club World Cup.</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/jurgen-klopp-will-take-liverpool-to-club-world-cup-in-qatar-and-leave-reserve-coach-in-charge-for-carabao-cup-quarter-final-05hqvd8l5">Times</a> reports that Klopp will join his senior players in the Middle East for the FIFA competition, leaving a youth-dominated side to participate in the EFL Cup.</p>
      <p>Klopp's assistant Pep Lijnders recently <a href="http://90min.com/posts/6500461-pep-lijnders-reveals-how-liverpool-plan-to-tackle-club-world-cup-carabao-cup-fixture-congestion">​reiterated the importance</a> of the Club World Cup to <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/liverpool">​Liverpool</a>, with the club yet to win the tournament, having only participated on one previous occasion.</p>
      <p>It is currently unknown who Liverpool will play in their semi-final, which takes place on 18 December. Mexican outfit Monterrey are potential opponents for the side, as are hosts Al-Sadd and Pacific island team Hienghene Sport.</p>
      <p>There are three clubs the Reds could meet in the final, including Flamengo, the Brazilians having won their first Copa Libertadores since 1981 on Saturday.</p>

      <p>It's understood Liverpool will send a strong squad to Asia, meaning the youngsters are set to dominate the lineup against <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/aston-villa">​Villa</a>. James Milner, Adam Lallana and Joe Gomez have all featured during the run to the League Cup quarters, but they are expected to fly to Qatar.</p>
      <p>The Reds hierarchy had considered handing Lijnders the reins for the clash in the Midlands, which takes place a day before they get underway in the World Cup. However, it was ultimately decided the Dutchman would remain with Klopp and the rest of the boss' coaching staff.</p>
