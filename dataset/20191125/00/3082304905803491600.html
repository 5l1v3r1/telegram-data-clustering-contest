        <b>Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp says his star defender Virgil van Dijk deserves the Ballon d’Or after his brilliant year for the Reds.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp says Virgil van Dijk should beat Lionel Messi to Ballon d’Or glory next month.</p>
      <p>Dutch defender Van Dijk has had a stunning year with Liverpool, helping the Reds win the Champions League in June.</p>
      <p>They narrowly missed out on last season’s Premier League title but are heading the chase for domestic glory in England this term after an unbeaten start.</p>
      <p>Klopp can see why Barcelona superstar Messi would be a popular choice for the individual honour, because of his career accomplishments.</p>
      <p>But rather than give a sixth Ballon d’Or to Messi, Klopp believes there is a strong case for Liverpool’s defensive talisman to walk away with the trophy at the Paris ceremony on December 2.</p>
      <p>Real Madrid’s Croatian playmaker Luka Modric was last year’s winner of the prize, which is awarded annually by France Football magazine.</p>
      <p>Klopp said: “If you give the Ballon d’Or to the best player of this generation, then you can give it always to Lionel Messi, that’s how it is.</p>
      <p>“But if you give it to the best player of last season, then it was Virgil van Dijk.</p>
      <p>“So I don’t know exactly how it will work, but that’s how I see it.</p>
      <p>“If it’s for the best player of all, then it’s Lionel. The best player of last season, it’s Virgil. We will see.”</p>
      <p>Van Dijk also helped Netherlands to qualify for Euro 2020 this year, while Messi featured as Argentina finished third at the Copa America.</p>
