      <p>Topping the charts for the tenth year in a row, <a href="https://www.wien.info/en">Vienna</a> has been ranked the “world’s most liveable city” by <a href="https://www.eiu.com/n/the-global-liveability-index-2019/">The Economist Intelligence Unit</a> so it’s no wonder that the Austrian capital is such a popular visitor destination. Vienna successfully blends the traditional with the contemporary and rightly prides itself on its abundance of music and art, its grand architecture and heritage and its generous green spaces that include more than 200 imperial parks and gardens. In fact, the city of Vienna has highest ration of green space in Europe. Next year will mark the 250<sup>th</sup> anniversary of Ludwig van Beethoven’s birth and as Vienna was the city where the German composer created and premiered most of his work, there will be numerous commemorative events in 2020.</p>

      <p>With two <a href="https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/">UNESCO</a> world heritage sites (the historic centre of Vienna and the <a href="https://www.schoenbrunn.at/en/">Schönbrunn Palace</a>), the Austrian capital is the ideal destination for history and culture buffs. A museum quarter with numerous historic and contemporary art galleries showing the works of renowned Viennese artists <a href="http://www.albertina.at/en">Egon Schiele</a> and <a href="https://www.belvedere.at/gustav-klimt">Gustav Klimt</a>, flea markets, coffee shops and cakes (including the famous chocolate cake, <a href="https://www.wien.info/en/shopping-wining-dining/viennese-cuisine/recipes/sachertorte">sachertorte</a>) are just a few of the compelling reasons to visit Vienna. For access to many of the museums, buy a <a href="https://www.wien.info/en/travel-info/vienna-city-card">Vienna City Card</a> in 24 or 72 hour duration which also gives free transportation on trams, buses and the metro (from 17 euros for 24 hours).</p>

      <p>A weekend certainly isn’t enough time to visit Vienna’s numerous superb museums and galleries. Visitors flock to the <a href="https://www.belvedere.at/palaces">Belvedere Palaces</a> to stroll through the lovely gardens and to view the famous paintings by Egon Schiele and Gustav Klimt and the <a href="https://www.khm.at/en/">Museum of Fine Arts</a> houses the world’s largest collection of paintings by Bruegel. The two Belvedere Palaces were built in the early eighteenth century by Baroque architect Johann Lucas von Hildebrandt as the summer residence of Prince Eugene of Savoy. The <a href="https://www.belvedere.at/en/ausstellungen/permanent-exhibitions">Upper Belevedere</a> has the world's largest collection of Klimt's work, holding 24 of his paintings plus works by Schiele. The lower Belvedere palace has temporary art exhibitions. A third building, <a href="https://www.belvedere.at/en/visit/belvedere-21">Belvedere 21</a>, a post-war modernist building, shows contemporary art. All three are worth visiting so allow at least a half day to do so. However, if you only have time to see one show in Vienna this autumn, it should be the Albrecht Dürer show at <a href="https://www.albertina.at/en/">The Albertina Museum</a> (on until 6 January 2020). It has been decades since so many works by this Renaissance genius have been seen in one place. This blockbuster show presents over 200 drawings, paintings and prints, including his world-famous drawings, the <i>Hare</i>, <i>Praying Hands </i>and <i>Large Piece of Turf. </i>While you’re there, head downstairs where you’ll be rewarded with a retrospective of the brilliant Austrian painter Maria Lassnig (on until 1 December 2019). If your visit happens to coincide with the <a href="https://www.viennacontemporary.at/en/">Vienna Contemporary Art Fair</a> each September, it’s worth a look. The fair focuses on Eastern European art, emerging works and prices are surprisingly reasonable making it a good hunting ground for new art collectors.</p>

      <p>No other city has been home to so many famous composers with Schubert and Strauss born in Vienna and Mozart, Beethoven, Haydn, Brahms and Mahler having lived there. There are daily concerts in the 120 music and theatre venues, including four opera houses plus many of the city’s churches host classical concerts. In the <a href="http://www.karlskirche.at/">Karleskirche</a> (St Charles Church) Mozart's <i>Requiem and </i>Vivaldi's <i>Four Seasons</i> are performed on a regular basis. In addition to opulent frescoes on the interior, contemporary art meets Baroque with a giant glass bubble installation “Aerocene” by artist <a href="https://studiotomassaraceno.org/">Tomás Saraceno</a> suspended from the church’s ceiling.</p>

      <p><a href="http://www.labstelle.at/">Labstelle Wien</a>, a restaurant in the city center with a creative modern Austrian menu, is an excellent choice for lunch or dinner. The fresh, contemporary decor complements the simple and satisfying regionally rooted menu. Seasonal dishes, cooked with local ingredients and a wine menu with 70% regional wines are part of this restaurant’s appeal. The menu offers surprises too. I was persuaded to try something I’ve always deeply disliked, tripe in batter and found it unexpectedly delicious.</p>

      <p>For a fine-dining experience in a beautiful setting, <a href="https://www.kempinski.com/de/wien/palais-hansen/restaurant/edvard/">Edvard</a> at the Palais Hansen Kempinski is the place to go. This gourmet restaurant has maintained its Michelin-starred status since 2014, making it one of the best fine dining restaurants in Austria. The kitchen, under Chef Thomas Pedevilla (previously at Michelin-starred <a href="https://www.tantris.de/en/">Tantris</a> in Munich and <a href="http://www.vilajoya.com/">Vila Joya</a> in the Algarve), combines seasonal and international produce to create a five, seven or nine-course tasting menu. Expect seasonal produce to accompany innovative dishes with Bavarian prawns, local lamb and venison.</p>

      <p>Be sure to walk through <a href="https://www.sacher.com/en/hotel-sacher-wien/">Hotel Sacher</a>, the birthplace of <i>sachertorte</i> before heading to its popular cafe upstairs where you can sample the famous chocolate cake. The furnishings in the hotel are as opulent in the public areas as in the suites. Signed photos of celebrities who've stayed there are displayed in one of the hallways: I spotted one of Elizabeth Taylor. The story goes that in 1832 Prince von Metternich instructed 16-year-old apprentice Franz Sacher to create a cake for his guests and sachertorte was born. The legendary cake is made with chocolate, apricot jam and whipped cream and while it has been widely duplicated, the original is the best.</p>

        <b>Where to Stay</b>
      </p>
      <p>Designed by the Danish/Austrian architect Theophil Edvard Hansen (who also designed Vienna’s Parliament building, the Stock Exchange and the Academy of Fine Arts), <a href="https://www.kempinski.com/en/vienna/palais-hansen/">The Palais Hansen Kempinski</a> opened as hotel for <a href="https://www.bie-paris.org/site/en/1873-vienna">Expo 1873</a>. The listed Palais, designed in the Greek revival style favored by the architect who studied in Greece, is located in the center of Vienna in the first district close to the most popular sights. It was a hotel until 1900 and after many years as a bank and then state building, it reopened in 2013 as part of Europe’s oldest luxury hotel group Kempinski. There are 152 elegant rooms and suites on three floors, including a Presidential suite that’s the largest in Vienna. The restaurant offering is stellar with all day dining at <a href="https://www.kempinski.com/en/vienna/palais-hansen/dining/die-kueche/">Die Küche Wien</a>, Michelin-starred <a href="https://www.kempinski.com/en/vienna/palais-hansen/dining/edvard/">EDVARD</a> (named after the building’s architect) and award-winning <a href="https://www.kempinski.com/en/vienna/palais-hansen/dining/26-east/">26°EAST Bar</a> (won best bar in Austria). The <a href="https://www.kempinski.com/en/vienna/palais-hansen/luxury-spa/">Kempinski Spa</a> offers a high standard of relaxation and wellness with a gym, saunas and a hydropool.</p>
