      <p>It’s that time of year again: turkey, travel, tension.As fun as it is to stuff the turkey and deck the halls, the holiday season brings its fair share of drama. Some of it comes from overconsumption, but there’s a psychological component, as well. If your extended family doesn’t share the same political or cultural attitudes or even reference points as you, some uncomfortable conversations ensue. After spending the year most likely surrounded by people who think and act like we do, it can be jarring to confront “alternative facts.”</p>
      <p>My behavioral design agency applies behavioral science theories to real-world contexts. We created the science of design, which identifies and predicts the causal relationship between your company's actions and how your users respond. I recently <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/theyec/2019/09/26/three-cognitive-biases-undermining-executives-strategic-decision-making-ability">wrote</a> about the executive biases that derail strategic decision making. Now I’ll share some ways for you to apply behavioral science to an even more demanding set of stakeholders: Uncle Fred, your mother-in-law, your second cousin’s third husband or whoever you face off with once a year.</p>
      <p>But before you opt for a staycation, consider embracing the art of productive disagreements. It’s easier than you think to turn grumbling into growth.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Do’s And Don’ts Of Productive Disagreement</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Don’t argue facts. </b>Presenting your points won’t change anyone’s mind. Thanks to confirmation bias, people selectively pick and choose which facts they’ll use to back up their preexisting beliefs. As humans, we’re all subject to this common mental shortcut, including the person reading (and writing!) this article.</p>
      <p><b>Don’t alienate.</b> Most people have a sense of belonging that comes with holding certain ideas; these cognitive or cultural affiliations let them know what “tribe” they belong to. So when you find yourself discussing things like climate change or gun control with folks who hold an opposing viewpoint, you won’t get far with traditional debate. You may just experience the discomfort of both sides doubling down on their original beliefs, voices raised, ears closed to new information, while Mom waves the gravy boat around, frantically trying to diminish the discord by offering seconds.</p>
      <p>So if reasoning doesn't work, what does? The best intervention we have for changing someone's mind is actually spending time with people who have different values. Some do’s:</p>
      <p><b>Do pop your filter bubble. </b><a href="https://fs.blog/2017/07/filter-bubbles/">Algorithms</a> use our click behavior, browsing history and location to determine what information we’d like to see more of as we seek answers or entertainment on the web. A steady diet based on more of the same can lead to echo chambers and, ultimately, polarization. The less contact we have with contradicting viewpoints, the more intellectually isolated we can become.</p>
      <p>Prevent algorithms from locking you in a warren of echo chambers. Here are a few tips for avoiding filter bubbles:</p>
      <p>• Use ad-blocking browser extensions.</p>
      <p>• Read news sites and blogs that provide a wide range of perspectives.</p>
      <p>• Switch focus from entertainment to education.</p>
      <p>• Use incognito browsing, and stay logged out if possible.</p>
      <p>• Delete search history and browser cookies.</p>
      <p>Even if you start miles apart, listening with empathy can bring you closer. Here are some keys to more constructive conversations.</p>
      <p><b>Model intellectual humility. </b>Neuroscientist and psychologist Mark Leary at Duke University discovered that regardless of political affiliation, those with “<a href="https://today.duke.edu/2017/03/modest-personality-trait-intellectual-humility-packs-punch">intellectual humility</a>” become less defensive when confronted with conflicting evidence. Embracing this method of thinking keeps you open to learning from the experience of others.</p>
      <p>Using the scientific method is a great example of this: Instead of hoping to prove a conclusion, a scientist tries to disprove their own hypothesis. Rule out any other alternative explanations by constantly asking: What am I missing here?</p>
      <p><b>Shift modes.</b> Consciously speak slowly and calmly. Slowing the situation down helps people shift from emotional reactivity into rational engagement. <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/hk/blog/your-wise-brain/201303/try-softer-tone">Studies</a> show that the greatest impact on a conversation comes from the tone of voice you use.</p>
      <p><b>Explore values.</b> Rather than judging the person, try to understand them. Approach with curiosity, and probe for the reasons they believe what they do; open a doorway to compassion so you can <a href="https://moralfoundations.org/">find common ground</a>.</p>
      <p><b>Listen deeply.</b> Let others express themselves. Feeling heard makes it much more likely they’ll be able to listen themselves. A recent <a href="https://hbr.org/2018/05/the-power-of-listening-in-helping-people-change">study</a> (registration required) shows that a good listener can help the speaker lower anxiety levels and increase clarity about their attitudes on the topic.</p>
      <p>A little bit of psychology and a lot of patience can help you embrace the art of productive disagreements. Enjoy your discussions, and go easy on the cider.</p>
