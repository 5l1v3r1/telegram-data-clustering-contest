      <h2>Long-term exposure to roadside pollution can cause a range of diseases, report finds</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:01:07+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 00:01</time> by <a rel="author">Camilla Hodgson</a></address>
      <p>Living within 50 metres of a major road could increase the risk of lung cancer by up to 10 per cent, according to a report backed by a group of health professionals calling for tough new air pollution laws in the UK.</p>
      <p>Long-term exposure to roadside air pollution can cause a host of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, including cardiac arrest, strokes, lung cancer and bronchitis, and stunt the growth of children’s lungs, analysis by King’s College London found.</p>
      <p>“It’s clear to see the effect of air pollution on the demand for emergency care in accident and emergency waiting rooms. This study from King’s College quantifies the staggering scale of that link,” said Dr Sandy Robertson, emergency medicine registrar at London’s Homerton University Hospital and member of the UK Health Alliance on Climate Change, which represents 650,000 health professionals in the National Health Service.</p>
      <p>The government must commit to meeting World Health Organization pollution targets by 2030, or “more people will die and face debilitating health conditions”, said a consortium of 15 health and environmental non-profits, including the British Lung Foundation and the UKHACC, which helped commission the report.</p>

      <p>About a third of Londoners live near a busy road, which could increase their risk of developing lung cancer by 10 per cent. The risk of stroke could increase by 10 per cent and heart disease by 6 per cent, the King’s researchers found.</p>
      <p>Cutting dangerously high levels of air pollution in the capital by a fifth would decrease lung cancer cases by about 8 per cent, while similar clean-ups in other cities — including Manchester and Bristol — would reduce cases by about 6 per cent, the report found.</p>
      <p>Concerns about the health impact of air pollution have grown in recent years. In 2017, the government ordered 24 local authorities to draw up plans for improving air quality, amid concerns that levels of nitrogen dioxide, which is emitted from diesel vehicles, were illegally high.</p>

      <p>In London, more than 9,000 <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/6f381ad4-fef7-11e9-be59-e49b2a136b8d">premature deaths</a> each year are caused by long-term exposure to air pollution, according to a previous study by King’s College. Globally that figure rises to about 7m, according to the WHO.</p>
      <p>Monday’s report warned that particulate matter (PM2.5) — tiny particles that are less than a 30th of the width of a human hair — was the most dangerous air pollutant to human health, and said all political parties should set legally-binding targets to reduce PM2.5 levels across the UK. The main source of ambient PM2.5 is vehicle emissions.</p>
      <p>The WHO has said there is no safe level of exposure, and current UK limits are more than double the WHO’s recommended maximum.</p>
      <p>In addition to legal targets, the consortium called for the rollout of “clean air zones” across the UK, which have been imposed piecemeal by a handful of cities. This month, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/27e502d6-0001-11ea-b7bc-f3fa4e77dd47">Bristol</a> became the first British city to approve a ban on diesel cars, and London launched an ultra low emissions zone in April that will be expanded from 2021.</p>
