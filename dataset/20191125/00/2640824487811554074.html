      <p><b>in what marks the company’s centenary year, <a href="https://www.designboom.com/tag/bentley/">bentley</a> has designed contemporary editions of it’s flagship </b><i>mulsanne</i><b> family of <a href="https://www.designboom.com/tag/car-design/">cars</a>. </b>comprising the <i>mulsanne</i>, the <i>mulsanne speed</i> and the<i> mulsanne extended wheelbase</i>, the elegant revisions combine state-of-the-art technology with the luxuriousness that is synonymous with the brand. for the occasion, designboom recently visited the crewe <a href="https://www.designboom.com/tag/factory-visits"><b>factory</b></a> headquarters in england and got behind the wheel for an exclusive test drive of one of the new models.</p>

      <p><b>testament to the unrivaled quality that is put into each and every <a href="https://www.bentleymotors.com/">bentley</a>, a total of only 2 vehicles are built per day in the crewe headquarters by a dedicated team of 702 employees. </b>to create the muslanne, the process begins in the ‘body in white’ workshop where the overall shape of the car is welded together by hand from 570 kg of steel and aluminium. realized by master metalworkers, the finished body appears completely smooth to the naked eye. from here, the fun starts, as clients can choose from bentley’s color palette or specify their own custom shade to paint the muslanne, resulting in a bespoke model that perfectly fits the personality of the owner.</p>

      <p><b>the company’s commitment to high quality craftsmanship also extends into the interior of the muslanne. </b>once inside the mulsanne, clients are indulged in solid timber finishes that evoke a timeless luxury. using walnut, cherry or oak, the wood is hand-selected by bentley experts who travel all over the world to check every inch before harvesting for veneer. back in the crewe factory, the thin pieces are sanded down, lacquered and cured for 72 hours. they are then sanded again and polished before being fitted to the final interior.</p>

      <p><b>from the 400 hours it takes to build an entire bentley mulsanne, approximately 150 of those are dedicated to creating the leather interior. </b>sourced from northern europe, each hide is thoroughly checked for imperfections before being precision cut by hand. going through a total of 3000 bull hides per week, bentley’s team carefully stitches the material together to form the sumptuous seats, doors and other elements that make the car world-renowned for attention to detail. and finally, as a mark of accountability and pride, each craftsperson even etches their initials into the inside of the upholstery.</p>

      <p><b>once each element is composed, the mulsanne is quality checked to the most rigorous standards. </b>a series of tests are undertaken, starting with the car being meticulously checked over by eye against a 500-650 point checklist. the finished vehicle then undergoes a test drive around the factory to ensure the smoothest of rides. the car is also checked for water-tightness, examined under UV light, valeted, and inspected one final time under a light tunnel before being signed off to the client.</p>

      <p><b>regarding the specification of the new mulsanne, this</b> <b>latest interpretation incorporates advanced chassis technologies and more efficient air springs and hydraulically-damped sub frame bushes to reduce noise within the cabin.</b> additionally, the V8 engine is reduced in sound by 25 decibels and vibration has been minimized, resulting in a smoother ride. the exterior appearance of the mulsanne has also been given a modern update with an imposing front end that is dominated by a large stainless steel vertical-vane grille. inside, the interior displays the careful craftsmanship from the crewe factory. high-quality wood, leather and metal finishes are combined with redesigned seats, new door trims and armrests, and unique glass switchgear.</p>

      <p><b>catering for every kind of customer, the mulsanne speed brings bentley’s established luxury together with a high performance specification for those real petrolheads. </b>featuring a more powerful engine, the car has a top speed of 190 mph (305 km/h) and can go from 0-100 km/h in just 4.9 seconds (0-60 mph in 4.8 seconds). the revised model also boasts 537 ps (530 bhp), 1,100 nm (811 lb.ft) of torque and selectable sports suspension to provide ultimate comfort while driving.</p>
