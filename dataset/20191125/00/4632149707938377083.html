      <p><i>With Rs 2K they would fool people to courier them gadgets</i> <br/><br/>Nigerian crooks, who used to come up with innovative ideas to con people online, were finally halted in their tracks by the cops. Their latest con was making advance payments of Rs 2,000 towards courier charges and luring people by telling them that they are from the US and wanted to gift a gadget to someone in Bengaluru. They would approach sellers on OLX from different cities asking them to courier the gadget to a Bengaluru address and send an email claiming that the transaction is on hold and once the delivery is completed, the amount would be released. <br/><br/>The accused, Micheal Temitope Asegbeloyin, Jomiloju and Oyewusi Oluwatobi Cole, used a few applications to create fake IDs and send emails to the victims. All three have been arrested by the Marathahalli police. Police said that they first would make the advance payment of Rs 2,000 for courier charges to gain their vitims’ trust. Abilash, a microbiologist and a resident of Kanakadasanagar in Mysuru, said that he had posted an advertisement on OLX to sell his IPad for Rs 50,000 on Tuesday as he was in need of money. “I had to undergo kidney stone surgery and decided to sell my IPad. I received a message from a buyer who claimed he was from the US and identified himself as John Mathew. He sent me his passport, I-cards and photographs.” <br/><br/>The man claimed his brother lived in Bengaluru and that this was his birthday gift. He asked Abhilash to courier the I-Pad to that address. “He said he would first credit the money to my bank account along with the courier charges and once I courier the item, the amount will be credited to my account. I did not believe him at first but then I received an email with an RBI logo stating that the transaction was on hold so I trusted it.” Abhilash couriered it to the given address and was waiting for the amount to be credited. <br/><br/>But, that was in vain. <br/><br/><br/>“I was shocked by a call from the courier office that said there were seven other similar couriers to the same address and it seemed to be a fraud. I rushed to Bengaluru and found that the accused had been caught by the police,” said Abilash. <br/><br/>About seven victims from different cities fell prey to the con and couriered electronic gadgets to the given address. “Three victims are from Chennai and the accused had used a similar story but gave them different names, different ID cards and claimed to be from different countries too,” Abilash added. <br/><br/><br/>Police said the accused had given the same address for all the victims and the courier company, informed them. “We laid a trap and asked the accused to come to the courier centre to collect the parcel and caught them red handed,” said an officer. A senior officer said that the accused were produced before the court on Saturday and were sent to judicial custody.</p>
