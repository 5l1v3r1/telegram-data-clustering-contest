      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.90min.com/users/15405988" target="_blank">Kaya Kaynak</a></address>
      <p>​Juventus can secure top spot in Group D when they take on Atletico Madrid in the Champions League at the Juventus Stadium on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The Italian champions will be looking to secure a more favourable draw for the next round in Europe's premier competition, ahead of a tight race for Serie A that sees them just one place ahead of Antonio Conte's Inter Milan.</p>

      <p>Their visitors have been in a poor run of form by the high standards set by manager Diego Simeone, and currently sit fourth in La Liga, having scored just 16 goals in 14 matches.</p>
      <p>A win for Atleti could guarantee them qualification and send them top of the group on head to heads, meaning there is a lot to play for in Turin.</p>
      <p>Here's <i>90min's</i> preview for the game.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.90min.com/players/cristiano-ronaldo">​Cristiano Ronaldo</a> is expected to return to the starting lineup after missing the victory over Atalanta with his mysterious ongoing knee injury.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/juve">​Juventus</a> go into the game with something of a defensive injury crisis after Matthijs de Ligt dislocated his shoulder in Saturday's win, meaning Daniele Rugani will have to come in alongside Leonardo Bonucci due to Giorgio Chiellini's long term injury.</p>
      <p>Alex Sandro is expected to be back to boost the back four, although compatriot Douglas Costa has been ruled out with a thigh injury, while Federico Bernardeschi and <a href="https://www.90min.com/fr/players/adrien-rabiot">​Adrien Rabiot</a> are both doubts.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/atletico">​Atletico Madrid</a> have a defensive crisis of their own with first choice centre backs Stefan Savic and Jose Gimenez both ruled out of Tuesday's clash. </p>
      <p>They do have the services of club record signing Joao Felix to call on though, after the Portuguese returned from an ankle injury against La Liga surprise package Granada. Thomas Partey and Saul Niguez are both available after missing that game through suspension.</p>

      <p>The two sides have met five times in European competition, with Atletico winning twice and Juventus just one the once.</p>
      <p>There have been two draws between the pair, the most recent of which came on matchday one of this season's Champions League, when they played out a <a href="https://www.90min.com/posts/6458098-atletico-madrid-2-2-juventus-report-ratings-reaction-as-european-giants-share-the-spoils">​2-2 draw</a> at the Wanda Metropolitano.</p>

      <p>Despite the poor form of Ronaldo - who has only scored once in this season's Champions League - Juventus have hit a decent run of form in recent times.</p>
      <p>Maurizio Sarri's side have come out on top against Atalanta and <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/milan">​AC Milan</a> ​in their past two games, and look good for a ninth successive Scudetto.</p>

      <p>Atleti meanwhile have been very poor by their own standards in La Liga this season, drawing seven out of their 14 La Liga games.</p>
      <p>They had been faring better in Europe, but a <a href="https://www.90min.com/posts/6492367-leverkusen-2-1-atletico-madrid-report-ratings-reaction-as-woeful-rojiblancos-slump-to-defeat">​shock defeat to ten man Bayer Leverkusen last time out</a> has put their qualification for the next round on hold.</p>
      <p>Here's how the two have got on in their last five matches...</p>

      <p>Although Juventus are in very good form, they would be foolish to write off Atletico Madrid in this game.</p>
      <p>Diego Simeone's side are at their best when the odds are stacked against them, but with their inability to score goals, Juve have to be the favourites.</p>
