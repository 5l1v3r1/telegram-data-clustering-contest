      </p>
      <p>Think about it. Be honest. Is your child an <b>Instant Gratifier</b> or a <b>Patient Postponer</b>?</p>
      <p>So what? Does it really matter? As a parent, teacher, coach, and mentor do your actions and interactions make a difference? Can we teach children <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/self-control">self-control</a> and shape them into <b>Patient Postponers</b> rather than <b>Instant Gratifiers</b>?</p>

      <p>The renowned psychologist <a href="https://psychology.columbia.edu/news/memoriam-walter-mischel-psychologist-who-developed-pioneering-marshmallow-test">Walter Mischel</a>, who conducted the famous “<a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-marshmallow-test-walter-mischel/1117993363?ean=9780316230872">Marshmallow Experiment</a>” believes we can teach children self-control.</p>
      <blockquote>“This skill set [the ability to delay immediate gratification] is visible and measurable early in life and has profound long-term consequences for people’s welfare and mental and physical health over the life span.”</blockquote>
      <p>Why do some children grow up as <b>Patient Postponers</b> and are able to resist temptation, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_gratification">delay gratification</a>, and other children do not (<b>Instant Gratifiers</b>)? What does this have to do with <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/child-development">childhood</a> overindulgence? <a href="https://archive.ncfr.org/ncfr-2010-materials/relationships-between-childhood-overindulgence-and-adult-attitudes-">To test this</a> we asked 466 participants to answer 128 questions consisting of demographic data and seven psychological scales. My fellow researcher Mary Slinger and I established that delayed gratification is linked to <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-age-overindulgence/201809/what-is-childhood-overindulgence">childhood overindulgence</a>.</p>
      <h3>
        <a href="https://archive.ncfr.org/ncfr-2010-materials/relationships-between-childhood-overindulgence-and-adult-attitudes-">Our Research Found That Childhood Overindulgence Leads to:</a>
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>the inability to delay gratification;</li>
        <li>an increase in materialistic values;</li>
        <li>being ungrateful;</li>
        <li>being unhappy.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Conversely, if individuals are not overindulged as children, they are more likely to delay gratification, to not be materialistic, to feel <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/gratitude">grateful</a>, and to be happy. More specifically, we found significant differences in the ability to delay gratification between those that were overindulged as children, and those that were not.</p>
      <p>Participants who were not overindulged as children were more likely to be <b>Patient Postponers</b> rather than <b>Instant Gratifiers</b>.</p>
      <h3>What Are Patient Postponers Like?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Patient Postponers</b> are very task-oriented.</li>
        <li>They plan ahead and complete their work before they allow themselves to have fun.</li>
        <li>They are never impulsive shoppers.</li>
        <li>They almost always save for things they want rather than buy them on credit and pay for them later.</li>
        <li><b>Patient Postponers</b> rarely get frustrated or angry when they have to wait for things or when others interfere with their plans.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>What Are Instant Gratifiers Like?</h3>
      <p>▪ <b>Instant Gratifiers</b> are not task-oriented.</p>
      <p>▪ They rarely plan ahead and routinely <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/procrastination">procrastinate</a>. They put off the things they should do for the things that they really like doing.</p>
      <p>▪ They are impulsive shoppers. They want things now.</p>
      <p>▪ They never save for things they want; instead, they buy them on credit and pay for them later.</p>
      <p>▪ <b>Instant Gratifiers</b> routinely get frustrated and angry when they have to wait for things or when things do not go their way.</p>
