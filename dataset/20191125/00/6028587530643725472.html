      </figure>
      <p>I wouldn’t have thought a boutique hotel could be tucked into Beacon Hill, but the Whitney does it with grace, quietly blending into a corner at the end of Charles Street. Originally a part of Massachusetts Eye and Ear Hospital, the hotel manages to combine respect for history with modern decor and a vibrant art collection. And it’s hard to beat the location – steps from a Red Line T station, a stroll along the Charles or the charming boutiques of Beacon Hill.</p>
      <p>The Deal: up to 40% off accommodations for stays through September 2020. Sale begins November 22, 2019 and ends at midnight on December 5, 2019 for stays through September 2020.</p>
