      <p>At least 29 people were killed when a small plane crashed after takeoff into a densely populated area of the city of Goma in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo.</p>
      <p>A survivor among the 19 people -- 17 passengers and two crew members -- who were aboard the plane was taken to hospital along with 16 others injured on the ground, the North Kivu regional government said.</p>
      <p>"At this stage, 29 bodies have been found in the rubble," the statement said.</p>
      <p>The Busy Bee Dornier-228 smashed into two houses near the airport, the deputy transport minister Jacques Yuma Kipuya said earlier.</p>
      <p>The first images from the scene showed smoke billowing above the neighbourhood and the aircraft in flames with local people throwing buckets of water on it.</p>
      <p>A video seen by AFP showed the cabin of the plane still smouldering embedded in the wall of the house.</p>
      <p>The aircraft had been headed for the city of Beni, 350 kilometres (220 miles) north of Goma, when it went down after takeoff in the residential area.</p>
      <p>Busy Bee airline staff member Heritier Said Mamadou had earlier confirmed that 19 were on board the flight scheduled from Goma around 9:00 am (0700 GMT).</p>
      <p>Busy Bee, a recently established company, has three planes serving routes in the North Kivu province.</p>
      <p>The pilot "failed in his takeoff," Nord Kivu governor Carly Nzanzu Kasivita said in a statement. One of the airline's maintenance workers at the site, quoted by news site actualite.cd, blamed a "technical problem".</p>
      <p>Among the victims of the Goma crash was a woman who was the coordinator of an association for the defence of women's rights, Mambo Zawadi, her NGO said.</p>
      <p>There were also three civil servants in the housing sector "who were returning to their posts in Butembo and Beni after work sessions that I had organised," their supervisor Molendo Sakombi said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The UN mission deployed in DR Congo, MONUSCO, sent two fire engines to support local rescue services.</p>
      <p>Aircraft accidents are common in the vast, conflict-wracked central African country.</p>
      <p>Last month an Antonov-72 cargo plane that was providing logistical assistance for a trip by Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi and carrying eight crew and passengers went missing after taking off from Goma.</p>
