      <h1>aoe adds ethereal fog and rippled louvers to building in china</h1>

      <p><b>located in nanshan, chongqing, <a href="https://www.designboom.com/tag/chinese-architecture/">china</a>, architecture firm aoe covered the shanxiao sales pavilion in an ethereal and flowing facade.</b> the architects refined the traditional architectural culture and natural landscape of nanshan as the main concept for the project. the use of modern technical language combined with artistic creation techniques transformed the pavilion into landmark building in the area.</p>

      <p><b><a href="http://www.aoe-china.com/">aoe</a> aimed for visitors to experience the artistic conception of ‘hidden in nature.’</b> the entire project has two parts, the sales office and the commercial area. the sales office is a smaller part of the building, but is executed with an exquisite and delicate aesthetic. it is naturally engraved and hidden in nature, thus highlighting the concept of ‘seclusion’.</p>

      </figure>
      <p><b>the facade uses the perforated plate as the louver to protect the sunshine, and its shapes are inspired by the clouds of nanshan.</b> the perforated leaves float around the cutain wall, resembling a long scroll landscape painting, and its variations reference the changing clouds and fog that stretch across the city. the glass curtain walls and perforated louvers’ shapes integrate seamlessly into the surrounding nature so the whole building seems like its floating among the clouds.</p>

      </figure>
      <p><b>spraying devices around the building create fog, adding another layer to its design.</b> the effect makes the natural fog become an additional facade for the building, creating a wonderland in nanshan. the building is not only meant to be a new work of architecture, but a work of art and performance, adding to the cultural life of the city.</p>
