      <h1>Amazing AI Makes You Look and Sound Exactly Like Joe Rogan</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Dan Robitzski</a></address>
      <h3>Deepest Fake</h3>
      <p>A new deepfake is disturbingly realistic — the AI projects famous podcaster Joe Rogan’s face onto that of an actor and also alters their voice to sound like him.</p>
      <p>The software is the latest from the AI startup Dessa, which previously created a tool that makes audio footage <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/ai-sounds-like-joe-rogan">sound just like Rogan’s voice</a>. The system isn’t perfect — tiny errors appear as the person having his face replaced moves his head around — but it is a troubling sign that believable deepfake videos are finally here.</p>

      <h3>Pound Of Cure</h3>
      <p>Along with its highly advanced deepfake, Dessa also released new algorithmic tools to help people detect deepfakes and separate real from synthesized videos.</p>
      <p>In a <a href="https://www.dessa.com/post/deepfake-detection-that-actually-works">new blog post</a>, the company details how it learned and trained tools to scan videos of faces to pick out the fakes. Advanced deepfakes have the potential to undermine <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/2020-candidates-deepfakes">public trust in democracy</a> and the media, but at least we’ll be able to use an algorithm that tells us whether or not someone is really Joe Rogan.</p>
