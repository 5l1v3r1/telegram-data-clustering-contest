      <p>We are heading into prime annual report season for Premier League teams. Manchester United’s <a href="https://ir.manutd.com/~/media/Files/M/Manutd-IR/documents/2019-mu-plc-form-20-f.pdf">report </a>was first off the press and the team announced a Premier League Turnover record of £627m - up over £37M from the year before. Last week, Manchester City published their <a href="https://www.mancity.com/annualreport2019/downloads/mcfc_financial_report.pdf">annual report</a> for the 2018/19 season and it was club record - Turnover of £535, an increase of £32m from 2018.</p>
      <p>Manchester United and City are the only two Premier League teams to have ever exceeded £500m in annual Turnover although there’s a chance Liverpool will make it a trio when they release their results.</p>
      <p>The release by Manchester City led to speculation that in a year’s time it was possible that Manchester United could relinquish top spot in the Premier League “money league” to the team famously referred to as the “noisy neighbors” by Sir Alex Ferguson a decade ago.</p>
      <p>So, could Manchester City knock United off the financial perch after outperforming them on the pitch?</p>
      <p>Time to take a look at Manchester United and Manchester City financial results for 2018/19 head-to-head and to take a glimpse into the financial future.</p>

      <p>Both teams make big gains in Broadcasting and both have UEFA and places in the Champions League to thank for double-digit improvements. United showed the bigger increase (£45m vs City’s £30m) on account of stepping up from the Europa League to the Champions League.</p>
      <p>Manchester City have been ever-present in the Champions League since 2011/12 and benefited in 2018/19 on account of new UEFA broadcast deals kicking in.</p>
      <p>Sponsorship stayed pretty much the same for both while City squeezed more money from selling players. City’s match day revenue is pretty much lapped by Manchester United.</p>
      <p>One thing that is a bit surprising, and something that ran counter to the prevailing media coverage, is the fact that the difference in Turnover between the two teams actually grew in 2018/19.</p>
      <p>City booked £86m less than United in 2018 but last year the gap increased to £92m. If you travel back to 2015 you will find that City had narrowed the gap to just £43m. But United gained a second-wind and twelve months later the difference had grown to over £120m.</p>

      <p>Both teams experienced double digit percentage increases in wage costs - United 12% and City 21%. City can point to paying out bonuses after winning the domestic treble. United can only point to someone handing the code to their the vault to various player agents.</p>
      <p>Other expenses and external charges are oddities in that some years ago Manchester City centralized certain functions to provide service across the array of teams they operate worldwide. Costs are allocated across each team and are treated by Manchester City as a stand-alone purchased service.</p>
      <p>Interest payments and Manchester United always make for good headlines. The cost of interest payments in 2019 takes the total to over £830m in the last eleven years - City’s barely £150m.</p>
      <p>To put things in even starker terms, United’s interest payments could have funded a transfer kitty of £80m every season since 2008.</p>
      <p>There again, it would be amiss not to mention the £1.3b sport-washing investment in Manchester City by Abu Dhabi over the last decade.</p>
      <p>Add the two numbers together and there is a swing of over £2b - investment to disinvestment in just over a decade.</p>

      <p>United continue to outstrip City in terms of profit, before and after tax, but what of the future. How will the two clubs compare 12 months from now?</p>
      <p>Manchester United noted in a press release that 2020 Turnover is expected to drop with £580m the top of the range - a reduction of £47m. No Champions League for United is a primary reason for the reversal. Of course, any reduction could be at least mitigated by a long run in the Europa League and/or an improvement in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>The anticipated reduction to £580m would put Manchester City within £45m of United’s high-end Turnover for 2020.</p>
      <p>City will benefit substantially from a new kit sponsor deal (Nike) and a sleeve sponsor. These two increases and a run to at least the semi-final of the Champions League would likely be enough see United drop below their “noisy neighbors.”</p>
