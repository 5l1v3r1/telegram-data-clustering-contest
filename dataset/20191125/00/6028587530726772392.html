      <p>On November 25, luxury French brand conglomerate, LVMH, announced a deal to pay $135 a share for Tiffany, according to the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/lvmh-nears-deal-to-acquire-tiffany-for-16-3-billion-11574611959?mod=hp_lead_pos1">Wall Street Journal</a>. The $16.2 billion deal gives the owner of Louis Vuitton and Bulgari brands a chance to put a fresh shine on the formerly lustrous brand made famous by its blue box.There are four reasons I think this deal makes LVMH stock a buy. (I have no financial interest in the securities mentioned in this post).</p>
      <p>Before getting into those reasons, let’s look at the deal. It’s the biggest one yet for LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault – his previous top deal was the $13 billion he paid to acquire Dior in 2017. But this deal is bigger and it gives LVMH a chance to revive “a classic American brand that has struggled with weak demand,” noted the Journal.</p>
      <p>The 182 year old Tiffany has over 300 stores globally and about $4.4 billion in annual revenue. Nearly half of its sales come from Asia. Indeed the Journal says that LVMH’s buy is a bet on China’s economy and consumers where Tiffany is “building flagship stores in several Chinese cities.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>Four Tests For Successful Acquisitions</b>
      </p>
      <p>Most mergers fail one or more of the <a href="https://www.babson.edu/academics/executive-education/babson-insight/technology-and-operations/four-tests-for-successful-acquisitions/">four tests</a> that must be passed to avoid the most common merger pitfalls: the industry in which the acquired company competes has low profit potential, the combined companies are likely to be worse off, the purchase price for the target is greater than the discounted value of the future cash flows, and the best talent leaves after the target is acquired.</p>
      <p>But I think the LVMH/Tiffany deal can pass three of these tests with ease – and the jury is still out on the fourth test.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Jewelry Industry Has Solid Growth And Profit Potential</b>
      </p>
      <p>The luxury jewelry business enjoyed a 7% increase in sales last year to about $20 billion, according to Bain &amp; Co. What’s more, LVMH executives believe that the industry has high barriers to entry which insulates Tiffany from upstarts, according to the Journal. This bodes well for the category in which Tiffany competes.</p>
      <p>
        <b>LVMH Can Make The Combined Companies Better Off</b>
      </p>
      <p>LVMH has previously demonstrated its ability to turn around Bulgari and its executives believe that they can do the same with Tiffany.</p>
      <p>As the Journal reported, LVMH – which earned about 8.5% of its 2018 revenue from jewelry and watches – believes that Tiffany is a brand that missed out on the recent surge in the luxury jewelry market but one that can be revived.</p>
      <p>LVMH plans to boost Tiffany’s marketing budget, launch new products, spiff up its retail stores, and make the brand more appealing to millennials. LVMH views Tiffany’s relatively low priced products as a great way to attract younger shoppers – who presumably could become wealthier as they age and ultimately pay up for LVMH’s more pricey brands.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Integration Of Tiffany Should Go Smoothly</b>
      </p>
      <p>Integration of key jobs should go well.</p>
      <p>In 2017, an activist investor hired former LVMH executive Alessandro Bogliolo to be Tiffany’s CEO. Deal talk began in October when LVMH executive Antonio Belloni contacted Bogliolo in New York. Bogliolo concluded that it would be easier for Tiffany to execute his turnaround strategy as a “private company with LVMH’s support,” according to the Journal.</p>
      <p>Assuming Bogliolo sticks around, he is likely to be left alone. The <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tiffany-acquisition-would-be-lvmhs-most-challenging-yet-11572303064?mod=article_inline"><i>Journal</i></a> reported that the brand’s creative functions would “be kept largely autonomous.” as would its diamond-finishing facilities. LVMH would integrate Tiffany’s back-office finance and logistics functions and would supply the services of its “digital strategy group” that advises its “dozens of brands.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>Will Net Present Value Be Positive?</b>
      </p>
      <p>While LVMH initially offered $120 a share, Tiffany thought the price did not reflect the value of its brand. It’s hard to know whether the $16.2 billion price LVMH is paying – plus the untold investment that LVMH will need to make to revive Tiffany’s brand – will be earned back in the form of future cash flows discounted to today’s dollars.</p>
      <p>LVMH stock is up slightly in pre-market trading – which suggests that investors are open to the ultimate success of this deal. This deal could be endangered if consumers in China stop buying luxury jewelry – but LVMH is likely to boost the value of Tiffany’s brand.</p>
