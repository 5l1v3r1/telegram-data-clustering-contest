      <h1>Investment in London offices slows as demand outpaces supply</h1>

      <p>Investment in London’s office market is falling despite growing demand from British and overseas investors, as a lack of available stock continues to hamper the sector.</p>
      <p>Total turnover for office investments in the capital in 2019 is set to drop well below the figure for the previous year, according to new data from Knight Frank, but a supply shortage may be masking increasing interest from investors.</p>

      <p>“We’re not really convinced that the turnover figures are reflective of the true underlying demand,” said Knight Frank’s Faisal Durrani.</p>
      <p>There was £2.9bn of office real estate available on the market during the third quarter of 2019 spread across 81 assets – a 21 per cent decrease on the second quarter.</p>
      <p>Durrani said the drop reflects “the severity of the shortage of investment grade assets”, adding: “There is an underlying depth of demand for investors to purchase in this market.”</p>
      <p>The total value of commercial office assets under offer in London at the end of the third quarter jumped 38 per cent to £2.4bn, the highest figure in just over a year.</p>
      <p>While 2018 saw a total of £16.3bn office investment turnover in London, the total for the first three quarters of 2019 is just £9.2bn, indicating that this year’s final will be well below the previous year’s.</p>
      <p>UK investors topped the leader board for acquisitions, committing £2.4bn to the sector in 2019 so far.</p>

      <p>Among international investors, total acquisitions fell for all regions except North America, but Knight Frank said a growing number of investors appeared to be “gathering on the sidelines” in London awaiting the outcome of the General Election and Brexit uncertainty.</p>
      <p>“Increased amount of geopolitical tension elsewhere inevitably drives investors to look for global safe havens,” said Durrani. “Relatively speaking London still looks a lot safer for many overseas investors.”</p>
