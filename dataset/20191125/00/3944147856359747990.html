      <h1>Report Finds Newark's Water Filters 97% Effective</h1>
      <h2>A report from CDM Smith found 97% of lead filters in the city of Newark, N.J., effective.</h2>

      <p>Newark, N.J., water consultant released a report from CDM Smith that discovered the city's lead filters are 97% effective, <a href="https://www.njspotlight.com/2019/11/newarks-lead-filters-are-97-effective-report-confirms/">according to NJ Spotlight</a>.</p>
      <p>About 1,600 separate samples were collected from over 300 residences located in areas served by the Pequannock water supply.</p>
      <p>Of 198 filters tested, all but five reduced lead to acceptable U.S. EPA levels. <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5ad5e03312b13f2c50381204/t/5dd70e112421805afa68ebd9/1574374964737/Newark+Point-of-Use+Filter+Study+-+Aug-Sept+2019+Final.pdf">The report also found</a> that when residents let the tap run for five minutes, the filters worked 99% of the time.</p>
      <p>The EPA agreed that the filters were working and lifted its bottled water recommendations.</p>
      <p>The report found that about a quarter of the filters tested were non-viable because they were improperly installed or maintained, however, <a href="https://www.njspotlight.com/2019/11/newarks-lead-filters-are-97-effective-report-confirms/">according to NJ Spotlight</a>.</p>
      <p>“These findings emphasize the importance of Newark's recommendation that residents both flush with the filter in the off position for at least five minutes and filter water with a properly installed and NSF-certified filter prior to use for drinking and cooking, until such time as the new corrosion control treatment becomes fully effective,” <a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2019-11/documents/epa_letter_to_commissioner_mccabe_and_mayor_baraka_november_22_2019.pdf">said Gov. Phil Murphy in a letter</a>.</p>
      <p>Essex County’s $120 million loan will allow the city to embark on a major lead pipe replacement effort, which will take a number of years, <a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2019-11/documents/epa_letter_to_commissioner_mccabe_and_mayor_baraka_november_22_2019.pdf">according to the letter</a>.</p>
      <p>The city says more than 2,700 underground lead service lines have been replaced thus far, <a href="https://www.njspotlight.com/2019/11/newarks-lead-filters-are-97-effective-report-confirms/">reported NJ Spotlight</a>.</p>
      <p>The state environmental protection commissioner estimated that the cost could be as much as $3 billion. The plan also would require voter approval. The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection has made $12 million in loans available to Newark from the Safe Drinking Water State Revolving Fund, <a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2019-11/documents/epa_letter_to_commissioner_mccabe_and_mayor_baraka_november_22_2019.pdf">reported the letter</a>.</p>
