      <p>Alcohol use disorder is one of the most prevalent forms of addiction yet effective treatment options are lacking.</p>
      <p>Prior preclinical and clinical studies found that ketamine reduces alcohol use disorder symptoms in both rats and humans, but the drug was administered once, rather than over a more realistic treatment time period.</p>
      <p>Ketamine is itself an addictive drug, so it is critical to examine how it affects patients over extended use.</p>
      <p>“There are no perfect treatments for alcoholism. Many patients relapse within a year after treatment,” said Professor Mohamed Kabbaj, a researcher in the College of Medicine at Florida State University and senior author of the study.</p>
      <p>“What makes ketamine interesting in our study is that it reduced alcohol intake, and the effect was long-lasting even after we stopped ketamine treatment.”</p>
      <p>In the study, Professor Kabbaj and colleagues examined how ketamine affected the rats’ alcohol consumption and how that alcohol intake affected their self-administration of ketamine.</p>
      <p>They divided male and female rats into groups based on how much alcohol they were prone to consume.</p>
      <p>The rats were allowed unrestricted access to alcohol three times a week. Three weeks later, ketamine treatments began.</p>
      <p>Ketamine administration reduced alcohol consumption in high-consumption male rats, and the effects lasted at least three weeks after the ketamine treatments ended.</p>
      <p>Ketamine did not affect the habits of high-consumption female rats and increased drinking in low-consumption females.</p>
      <p>The female rats also displayed a higher risk of abusing ketamine compared to the male rats.</p>
      <p>“Three weeks is a long time in a rat’s life,” Professor Kabbaj said.</p>
      <p>“If a similar thing happened in humans, one could imagine that after a short treatment with ketamine, alcoholic patients would cease alcohol intake for a couple of years. That would be a great achievement.”</p>
      <p>“Clinical studies for men and for women are needed before ketamine is used as a therapy for alcoholism in either sex,” the researchers said.</p>
