      <p>Let's assume that we have the "right stuff" and the drive to improve our skills. That commitment to continued personal and professional growth is necessary, but not sufficient when it comes to seeking useful, actionable feedback. We also need the <b>right network of candid feedback providers</b> to gain accurate and valuable perspectives on our behaviors, our strengths, and our gaps.</p>
      <p>Whether a new professional in our organization or a senior leader, we all thrive on feedback.</p>
      <p><i>"Those who handle feedback more fruitfully have an <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/identity">identity</a> story with a different assumption at its core. These folks see themselves as ever-evolving, ever-growing. They have what is called a “growth” identity. How they are now is simply how they are now. It’s a pencil sketch of a moment in time, not a portrait in oil and gilded frame. Hard work matters; challenge and even failure are the best ways to learn and improve. Inside a growth identity, feedback is valuable information about where one stands now and what to work on next. It is welcome input rather than upsetting verdict.”</i> Douglas Stone, <i>Thanks for the Feedback: The Science and Art of Receiving Feedback Well</i></p>
      <p>Who are your<b> trusted advisors</b> who can help you ID which behaviors you can leverage as strengths, and candidly hold up the mirror to those behaviors that need a bit of improvement? Whatever your age or experience level, you need one or two folks who tell you the unvarnished truth.</p>
      <p>These are not necessarily your biggest cheerleaders. Those who give you a deserved pat on the back and a "way to go" or "great job" are welcomed supporters for sure. But those who will help you grow will be much more specific and behavioral in their feedback. Seek out the truth-tellers when it comes to understanding what it takes for you to be more impactful.</p>
      <p>Remember, <i>you</i> drive that discussion. In the traditional feedback model, the supervisor or senior mentor is viewed as initiating the feedback process. That's not the case for those of us who want to drive our improvement every day. To get the most actionable feedback, consider asking perhaps: "I appreciate your positive support; it feels great. Thanks! But I'm curious as to what I did <i>specifically</i> that helped the team perform well? What did you observe me doing that was helpful? What specific comments I made or questions that I asked; my <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/body-language">body language</a>; <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/optimism">optimistic</a> encouragement of others; or my suggestions for improved <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/teamwork">teamwork</a>?</p>
      <p>On the flip side, what could I have done better? Could I have been more active, or less active? Say more or less, and if so, in what situations?</p>
      <p><b>Dig. Dig.</b> Keep asking the follow-up questions that result in your understanding exactly what you can to do to leverage your strengths and mitigate your "gaps".</p>
      <p>Establish your feedback network intentionally. Build it to span a variety of settings and perspectives. <i>Select those who will provide you with the gritty feedback necessary to improve</i>. Pick people for your teams who are committed to helping others around them get better.</p>
      <p>
        <i>"We do others no favors when they don't see the hard work that goes into the things they love. They need to know it's OK to work hard. It's OK to fail. It's OK to get dirty. It's OK to do it over and over again as they try to get a little bit better, and a little bit grittier, every time." Joe de Sena, Founder, Spartan Race.</i>
