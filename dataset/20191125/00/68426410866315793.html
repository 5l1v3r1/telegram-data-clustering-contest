      <p>The Saskatchewan government is joining other provinces that are supporting a class-action lawsuit against the opioid industry.</p>
      <p>Health Minister Jim Reiter says doing so is appropriate given the cost of opioid addiction to his province’s health-care system.</p>
      <p>Reiter is to table the Opioid Damages and Health Care Costs Recovery Act on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Similar legislation was recently introduced in the Alberta legislature to allow the province to recoup health costs on an aggregate basis and regardless of when damages occurred.</p>
      <p>British Columbia, which also has opioid cost recovery legislation, filed the proposed class-action lawsuit last year.</p>
      <p>It alleges drug manufacturers falsely marketed opioids as less addictive than other pain drugs, which helped to trigger a crisis that has killed thousands.</p>
      <p>“Everybody that’s read the news in the last months or years anywhere in the country has seen the toll that opioids have taken,” Reiter said Monday.</p>
      <p>“When, as health minister, I look at the cost to the health system that we all pay for that opioids have caused … it’s only appropriate that we’re part of that.”</p>
      <p>The lawsuit seeks costs from manufacturers and distributors dating back to 1996, when the pain drug OxyContin was introduced in the Canadian market.</p>
      <p>New Brunswick, Ontario and Alberta have already announced their support for the lawsuit.</p>
