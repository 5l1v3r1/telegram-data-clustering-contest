      <p>Cricket West Indies has picked Kimani Melius to lead a 15-man squad to the ICC U19 Cricket World Cup in South Africa in January.</p>
      <p>Before the team goes off to the World Cup, it will take on the England U19s and Sri Lanka U19s in the West Indies Rising Stars U19 Tri-Series in December.</p>
      <p>Melius was part of the team that failed to hold on to the title it won in 2016 last year, along with two other returning members. Ashmead Nedd and Nyeem Young were also members of that squad which has brought in players from the West Indies Emerging Players team currently part of the Colonial Medical Insurance Super50 Cup.</p>
      <p>Leonardo Julien and Jayden Seales are the two from the young Super50 side to make the cut.</p>
      <p>The Caribbean will get its opportunity to see the team in action, with the Tri-Series set to feature nine matches from December 6-21 at the Sir Vivian Richards Cricket Ground and the Coolidge Cricket Ground.</p>
      <p>The West Indies will face three-time winners Australia, 1998 England and tournament debutants Nigeria in Zone B of the U19 World Cup which begins January 17 and runs through to February 9.</p>
      <p>The squad is completed by Kevlon Anderson, Daniel Beckford, Matthew Forde, Joshua James, Antonio Morris, Mbeki Joseph, Avinash Mahabirsingh, Kirk McKenzie, Ramon Simmonds, and Matthew Patrick.</p>
