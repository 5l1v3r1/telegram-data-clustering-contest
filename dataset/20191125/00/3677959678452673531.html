      <p>Capcom announced the Iceborne expansion for Monster Hunter World back in December of last year. The expansion released for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on September 6. Iceborne will also come to Steam on January 9<sup>th</sup>, 2020. The PC version of Iceborne will sport features such as a high-resolution texture pack, customizable graphical settings, and DX12 support. Additionally, mouse-and-keyboard controls have been revamped across the board to better suit the new actions and abilities on PC.</p>
      <p><a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-world-iceborne-first-update-live/">The expansion’s first free update went live last month</a>.</p>
      <blockquote>The Iceborne expansion builds on every aspect of Monster Hunter: World, starting with an all-new story that picks up after the main game and whisks hunters away to a newly discovered chilly locale called Hoarfrost Reach. The snow-covered terrain offers an ecosystem that contrasts areas in the main game and progressively expands with the story. Iceborne is set to offer the largest region in the game so far, presenting hunters a wealth of new content with even more quests to face than in the original release.</blockquote>
      <p>Monster Hunter World is available globally now for PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.</p>
