      <h1>Staying in work you hate isnâ€™t keeping you safe.</h1>
      <h2>It's time to stop denying your fulfillment.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thriveglobal.com/authors/jennifersporbeebalancedllc-com/" target="_blank">Jennifer Spor</a></address>
      <p>You would give anything to have work that you love again, right?Â <b>Waking up each day as excited as a kid with a new bike</b>Â to get out there and rock your work and make an impact. Wellâ€¦ just about anything.</p>
      <p>Despite the fact that your job makes you feel unfulfilled, unchallenged, and pretty much dead insideâ€¦</p>
      <p>Despite not being able to see a future where you are because youâ€™re in a dead end relationship with your workâ€¦Â </p>
      <p>Despite each day being a repeat of the same thingâ€¦ you waking up, banging your head on a brick wall, going to sleep and then doing it over again. YOU STAY THERE.Â </p>
      <h4>WHY?</h4>
      <p>You have a ton of reasons, right?Â </p>
      <p>Health insurance, pension, money, tenure, youâ€™re too old, itâ€™s too late, you need more credentials and this biggieâ€¦ staying for your family.</p>
      <p><b>The truth is it isnâ€™t REALLY about any of these things.</b>Â Itâ€™s about you. Youâ€™re scared to make a change because youâ€™re questioning if youâ€™re good to enough to do what you REALLY want. Youâ€™re afraid of failure. All the other reasons you feed yourself are a bunch of excuses.</p>
      <p>You can make money, have health insurance,Â <b>and all the other things you want</b>, including taking care of your familyâ€¦ DOING WORK YOU LOVE.</p>
      <p>And you know what? When you start making more self-honoring decisions and showing up as you REALLY are, not who you think you need to be, you lead by example. You teach your family to do the same.Â <b>What example are you setting for them now?Â </b></p>
      <p>The good news is thatÂ <b>you are empowered with free will</b>Â to decide how you want to live. Lots of people become paralyzed by fear and do nothing because they think itâ€™s 0-60, quit my job tomorrow and then Iâ€™m left to suffer, and what will I do?Â <b>So much drama and it doesnâ€™t have to be like that.Â </b></p>
      <p>Now you might be thinking,Â <i>easier said than done, Jennifer.Â </i></p>
      <h3>This is what you need to do.</h3>
      <p>ðŸ‘‰<b>Breakthrough</b>Â the fear that is holding you back.</p>
      <p>ðŸ‘‰<b>Get clear</b>Â on what you want to do.</p>
      <p>ðŸ‘‰Make aÂ <b>plan</b>.</p>
      <p>ðŸ‘‰TakeÂ <b>action</b>.</p>
      <p>ðŸ‘‰ReceiveÂ <b>results</b>.</p>
      <p><b>It IS this simple.</b>Â But the fear, worry, and lack of worthiness you feel are whatâ€™s making it hard.</p>
      <p>Imagine a life where youÂ <b>love your work</b>Â and youâ€™reÂ <b>making an impact</b>Â every day?</p>
      <p>A life where youâ€™reÂ <b>leading by example</b>Â andÂ <b>creating a legacy</b>Â for your family and for others to aspire to.</p>
      <p>A life whereÂ <b>everything feels like itâ€™s finally falling into place.</b>Â Youâ€™re truly happy and fulfilled, with a purpose.</p>
      <p><b>You can have this life and youâ€™re the only one standing in the way. If you need a deeper level of support I can help you get there in a lot less time.
