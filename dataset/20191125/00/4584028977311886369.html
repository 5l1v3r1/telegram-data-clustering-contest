      <p>David Villa believes Pep Guardiola can lead Manchester City to Champions League success after hailing the Spanish manager.</p>
      <p>Former Barcelona and Bayern Munich boss Guardiola lifted the trophy twice during his time at Camp Nou, most recently in 2011.</p>
      <p>Guardiola failed to go all the way in three seasons with Bayern, however, and has fallen well short in his three full campaigns at the Etihad Stadium.</p>
      <p>City were eliminated in the last-16 stage in 2017 and have failed to progress beyond the quarter-finals in the last two years, but Villa is convinced Guardiola can guide them to glory.</p>
      <p>"For all the coaches and all the big clubs, it's normal to focus on the Champions League, because it's the best tournament you can play with a club," he told The Mirror.</p>
      <p>"Pep is obviously one of the best coaches in the world and obviously the subject of his focus is to win all the trophies.</p>
      <p>"Manchester City have never won this trophy, they've been behind in terms of it for many years, so it's normal they have a big obsession with this kind of trophy.</p>
      <p>"It's the best tournament you can play as a soccer player, but it's difficult to win for everyone, not just one or two clubs.</p>
      <p>"It's very difficult to win, and obviously you need to do a lot of work to win it."</p>
      <p>Villa, part of the Barcelona side that won the Champions League under Guardiola eight years ago at Wembley, has not been surprised by his former coach's domestic success in England.</p>
      <p>"He's a great coach," Villa said. "I was with him for two fantastic years at Barcelona and he helped me a lot.</p>
      <p>"He will have success wherever he goes. He managed in Spain and was successful, the same in Germany, and now in England.</p>
      <p>"So wherever he manages, he will be successful, because he's such an amazing coach."</p>
      <p>City will be through to the knockout rounds of Europe's showpiece competition if they avoid defeat against Shakhtar Donetsk on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Key to their European hopes is the form of England international Raheem Sterling, who Villa labelled a unique type of player.</p>
      <p>"He's amazing, a player with qualities that it's difficult to find in any other player," added Villa, who is retiring from football next month after a glittering and trophy-laden career with Barca, Atletico Madrid and Spain.</p>
      <p>"He's fast, he's really good in one-on-ones, and this year he's scoring a lot of goals. He's improving year by year, which is the most important thing for a soccer player.</p>
      <p>"When you're 18, 19, 20, and playing at the highest level, for teams like Liverpool and City, the most important thing is to get better every year.</p>
      <p>"It's important to grow as a player and every year Sterling has done it. You see he's a better player day by day, year by year, and he's still very young."</p>
