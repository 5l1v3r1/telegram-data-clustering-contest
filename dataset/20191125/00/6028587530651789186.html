      <p>Travelers in northern Europe are seeing their travel plans disrupted as a strike in Finland enters its second day. Hundreds of flights, cruise ship calls, cargo departures and local bus services are affected.The Finnish Aviation Union (IAU) and Finnish Seafarers’ Union (SMU) are among the organizations that have launched sympathy strikes in support of the ongoing dispute over terms and conditions at Finland’s state-owned postal service provider. The main issue is the company’s decision to move 700 parcel sorting workers to a new collective agreement. The strike began on November 11 and with slow progress being made in negotiations, other industrial unions are lending their support.</p>
      <h3>More than half Finnair flights canceled</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.finnair.com/fi-en/flight-information/travel-updates">Finnair announced</a> that moire than 250 of its 377 flights scheduled for Monday have been canceled. The industrial action is set to disrupt catering, customer service and ground-handling functions at several locations including Helsinki Airport, an important hub for Finnair and air traffic in northern Europe.</p>
      <p>Passengers on other airlines should expect delays or cancelations. However, Helsinki-bound services operated by SAS and Norwegian from Oslo and Stockholm are unaffected at the time of writing.</p>
      <p>A Finnair spokesperson told <a href="https://www.hs.fi/kotimaa/art-2000006318756.html">Helsingin Sanomat</a> that other departures are not guaranteed: “We’ll try to operate 120 of our flights on Monday, but it’s possible that they’ll be delayed or some of them have to be cancelled.”</p>
      <p>While the sympathy strikes are due to end on Monday, further disruption seems likely given that planes and crew will be out of position. Seven intercontinental departures into Helsinki have already been canceled for Tuesday because the aircraft did not leave Helsinki on Monday. The flights scheduled to leave San Francisco, Tokyo Narita, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Seoul, Beijing and Bangkok will not be operating on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Finnair states passengers affected by cancellations will be offered a re-routing. Alternatively, passengers can rebook on flights offered until December 1 or apply for a full refund.</p>
      <h3>Shipping also impacted</h3>
      <p>Those traveling on cruise ships or passenger ferries could also be impacted. Helsinki is a popular cruise port and there is also substantial ocean traffic between Finland, Estonia and Sweden.</p>
      <p>Viking Cruise Line announced several of its cruise ships will stay docked due to the strike.</p>
      <p>But it is foreign trade that’s expected to be hit hardest. A spokesperson for the SMU said that the affected vessels account for 60% of breakbulk exports and 50% of imports. The Finnish Shipowners’ Association <a href="https://www.helsinkitimes.fi/finland/finland-news/domestic/17013-cruises-and-flights-cancelled-public-transport-disrupted-by-strikes-in-finland.html">responded aggressively</a> to the strike. “With these large-scale sympathy strikes, the Seafarers’ Union is not only endangering Finnish foreign trade, but also the future of the Finnish flag on our vessels,” deputy managing director Hans Ahlström told the <i>Helsinki Times</i>.</p>
      <h3>Local transport in Helsinki also affected</h3>
      <p>Other sympathy strikes by the Transport Workers’ Union (AKT) and Trade Union for the Public and Welfare Sectors (JHL) have disrupted bus services in Helsinki and its surroundings.</p>
