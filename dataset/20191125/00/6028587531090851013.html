      <p>Matthew Goldman was working in the technology sector of financial services, helping companies manage their rewards cards, and after seven years of building software, he recognized that a lot of these rewards programs were onerous for consumers.“One day, we were talking about how it’s so complicated that you don't’ want to deal with it at all, and that all you want to do is just sit on your couch and drink wine, enjoying the true pleasures of life,” Goldman says.</p>
      <p>That was a light bulb moment for Goldman, who decided that after selling his company that he decided that for his next venture, he would create a simple and uncomplicated rewards programs for wine lovers. </p>
      <p>And, after more than a year in development, his new Grand Reserve Rewards program for wine lovers made its debut this past Tuesday. The concept is simple: wine lovers sign up on their website at GrandReservesRewards.com, and whenever they use their credit card to buy wine, visit a winery, join a wine club or go on a wine tour, they earn points, which they can redeem for wine-related merchandise. Consumers can only sign up with credit cards, not debit cards, but it is free to join. It is the first program of its kind.</p>
      <p>“Most rewards programs are built around what the company wants you to do and the loyalty to that company, and if you truly love wine, you don’t just buy from one vineyard over and over,” Goldman says. </p>
      <p>“We're not a winery, and we don’t sell wine,” he says. “You may have your favorites, a winery you love or a variety you love, but this program allows wine enthusiasts to be rewarded for their passion, and what many people love about wine is that it’s always a new experience.”</p>
      <p>Because it isn’t a winery and because it doesn’t sell wine, the company plans to make money from partnerships with different wineries and wine venues that can offer special points for purchases and special offers to members. But Goldman emphasized that he will not be selling members’ data, and Grand Reserve Rewards has invested in encryption technology and many security features to protect consumers’ information.</p>
      <p>“That is a very legitimate concern,” Goldman says, adding that he uses some of the same security features that financial service companies use.</p>
      <p>Once consumers sign up on the website, they immediately start earning rewards points. Members can explore the expansive Grand Reserve Rewards catalog to redeem points for a range of wine-related merchandise and experiences, such as a tasting journals, decanters, wine glasses, a Sonoma Valley winery tour with a private driver, classes at the Napa Valley Wine Academy, and exclusive sommelier-curated events launching in 2020. </p>
      <p>To mark its debut, Grand Reserve Rewards also announces a distinctive Napa Valley wine country getaway sweepstakes featuring a two-day stay at St. Helena's enchanting Harvest Inn resort, a two-day, chauffeured concierge wine tasting excursion in the legendary wine region and a $1,500 gift card for transportation expenses. The sweepstakes is separate from the rewards program, and consumers can sign up until Dec. 19 to compete.</p>
      <p>It took Goldman and his team in Pasadena, CA, just over a year to develop the technology, set up the rewards, and launch. Grand Reserve Rewards made its grand debut just ahead of the biggest wine buying period of the year.  According to Nielsen, Christmas and New Year’s Eve are the biggest holidays for wine sales in the United States, accounting for more than $1 billion dollars in sales in just the two weeks leading up to those holidays. Those numbers don’t even include all of the wine purchases for Thanksgiving, which is nearly $1 billion by itself.</p>
      <p>“We worked extra hard to get this launched ahead of Thanksgiving,” Goldman says.</p>
      <p>While the program is only available online through its website, by early next year, the company will be launching an app that consumers can use on their mobile phones. </p>
