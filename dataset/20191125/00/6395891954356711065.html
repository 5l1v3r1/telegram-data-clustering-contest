      <p><b>CINCINNATI (AP)</b> - Steelers quarterback Mason Rudolph says he "couldn't believe" a claim that he used a racial slur against Browns defensive lineman Myles Garrett before their altercation in Cleveland.</p>
      <p>Garrett was suspended indefinitely for yanking off Rudolph's helmet and hitting him with it near the end of the Browns' 21-7 victory on Nov. 14. ESPN reported that during his suspension hearing, Garrett told NFL officials that Rudolph had used a racial slur.</p>
      <p>After Pittsburgh's 16-10 win over Cincinnati on Sunday, Rudolph repeated that he didn't make any such comment.</p>
      <p>"It's totally untrue and I couldn't believe it and I couldn't believe he would go that route after the fact, but it is what it is," Rudolph told reporters. "I think I've moved on."</p>
      <p>NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said last week that the league investigated Garrett's claim and "found no such evidence" of the slur. The teams have a rematch next week in Pittsburgh.</p>
