      <p>The Bharatiya Janata Party hit back at the Shiv Sena-Congress-Nationalist Congress Party combine over <a href="https://www.rediff.com/news/2019/nov/25we-will-bring-more-than-162-mlas-sharad-pawar-at-show-of-strength.htm">show of strength of their MLAs at a hotel in Mumbai</a> on Monday evening and said his party will win the "photo finish" race during floor test in the assembly.</p>

      <p>Addressing a press conference, BJP leader and former Maharashtra minister Ashish Shelar taunted the Sena-NCP-Congress for "identification parade" of their MLAs and termed it as a cruel joke on the people of the state and democracy.</p>
      <p>This cannot be equated with a floor test in the assembly, he said, minutes after the unprecedented public parade of what the three parties claimed were 162 MLAs at a high-end hotel.</p>
      <p>The former minister said identification parades are held to allow witnesses to identify criminals.</p>
      <p>Shelar said, "We are sure that we will win the floor test in the assembly, whenever it gets convened. Such parades in a hotel will not help in proving majority on the floor."</p>
      <p>He also hit at the Shiv Sena, the BJP's one-time ally, for "forsaking" Hindutva and joining hands with the Congress, its ideological rival".</p>
      <p>Shelar took potshots at Shiv Sena MLA Aaditya Thackeray, the son of party chief Uddhav Thackeray, for taking an oath in the name of Congress president Sonia Gandhi.</p>
      <p>"The way Shiv Sena leaders have joined hands with the Congress, it underscores how hollow it's Hindutva has been," said the BJP leader.</p>
      <p>Shelar doubted if 162 MLAs were present during the show of strength, organised a day before the Supreme Court rules on floor test for the Maharashtra government led by Devendra Fadnavis whose swearing-in has been challenged by the Sena-NCP-Congress, constituents of the 'Maha Vikas Aghadi'.</p>
      <p>He wondered whether there were even 145 MLAs at the hotel, the majority mark in the 288-member state assembly.</p>
      <p>"You may have your photo, you may have your photographers there to show your strength, but it is the BJP who will win at the time of photo-finish under the leadership of Devendra Fadnavis and (deputy CM) Ajit Pawar," he said, indicating a tight race during the floor test.</p>
      <p>At the event, attended by top leaders of the three parties, an oath was administered to the MLAs to stay together and defeat the Fadnavis-Ajit Pawar government.</p>
