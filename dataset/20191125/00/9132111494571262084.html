      <p>Vice-President Dr Mahamudu Bawumia has announced that Ghana will introduce an e-visa system next year and also push for a single air transport market under the African Continental Free Trade Area agreement.</p>
      <p>Dr Bawumia disclosed this at the First Regional Congress in Women in Tourism Empowerment – Focus on Africa, being held in Accra on the theme “Building the Future Together.”</p>
      <p>Dr Bawumia said “Tourism has a great potential to accelerate progress across the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Well managed, the sector can generate quality jobs, reduce poverty and offer incentives for environmental conservation – a triple-win to help countries transition towards more inclusive, resilient economies.”</p>
      <p>He noted that the digital address system introduced by the Akufo-Addo-led government is some of the efforts the government is making to support tourism which will allow tourists to easily locate all tourist sites.</p>
      <p>Dr Bawumia tasked participants at the Congress to explore deeply, how Ghana can use tourism as a means to tackle some of her common development challenges while working with all stakeholders to develop the industry and empower women in tourism, for sustainable development and improve the living standard of Ghanaians.</p>
