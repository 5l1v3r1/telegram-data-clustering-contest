      <p>The 2020 NPP Parliamentary Candidate of the New Patriotic Party, Nii Lante Bannerman, has described the Member of Parliament for Odododiodio Constituency, Edwin Nii Lante Vanderpuye as a depiction of violence who needs to be shown the norms and ethics of civilisation.</p>
      <p>“This is somebody who is fond of violence, somebody who’s demeanour, his speech and everything depicts violence. And we need to cut him to size, we need to let him know that, that is not how a civilised person lives within a civilised community.”</p>
      <p>Speaking in an exclusive interview with Ghanaweb.com at the Adjabeng Magistrate Court this morning, Mr Bannerman, who through the state is pursuing a criminal case against the MP said, he is bent on bringing his opponent to book for the alleged act of assault the former Minister of Youth and Sports meted on him during the 2016 campaign season.</p>
      <p>“I believe taking him through this and making the law take its course on him, will let him mellow in some of his doings. I am not the only person he assaulted in 2016, he assaulted the Ngleshie assemblyman, Joseph Addo right in front of the James Town police station officer, he also assaulted my youth organiser then, Walters Bruce Taggoe. He has assaulted many people and I don’t think that is the way to go, the law needs to take its course for somebody like that to be brought to book.”</p>
      <p>In November 2016, Nii Lante Bannerman accused Nii Lante Vanderpuye of punching him in the face twice. The opponents who held rallies in the Odododiodio Constituency on the same day in the lead up to the 2016 parliamentary elections had their supporters clashing on the day. According to Nii Lante Bannerman, he was accosted by his opponent the next day at James Town where he was assaulted by the then Sports Minister.</p>
      <p>The case against Nii Lante Vanderpuye which was supposed to be heard by the Adjabeng Magistrate Court today, November 25, 2019 was however struck out by the court on procedural grounds.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Ghanaweb.com after the session, Mr Nii Lante Bannerman said, that the prosecutors of the case had indicated they were going to file a new case which will be called on Monday December 2, 2019.</p>
