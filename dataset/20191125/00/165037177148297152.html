        <b>Chelsea midfielder N'Golo Kante looks set for a long-term stay in London after rejecting Paris Saint-Germain.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>N'Golo Kante</b> says he rebuffed interest from <b>Paris Saint-Germain</b> because he is happy at <b>Chelsea</b>.</p>
      <p>Ligue 1 champions PSG have long been linked with the France international and reportedly tried to sign him following his impressive displays at the <b>2018 World Cup</b>.</p>
      <p>The move never materialised and Kante, considered one of the Premier League's best midfielders, is now in his <b>fourth season</b> at Stamford Bridge.</p>
      <p>He signed a new <b>five-year contract</b> with the club in November 2018 and has no plans to leave.</p>

      <p>"Sometimes you don't really know <b>where you want to go</b>, but you know what you already have," Kante told Canal+ when asked about PSG's interest.</p>
      <p>"I knew I was at Chelsea and <b>I felt good</b> at Chelsea. On top of that, it was a footballing decision."</p>
      <p>"I felt good in London and I felt <b>happy</b> in this project and therefore I am happy to stay here."</p>
      <p>Kante joined Chelsea in 2016 following a season with <b>Leicester City</b>, where he won the first of his two Premier League titles.</p>
      <p>The 28-year-old scored <b>for the third time</b> this season in the Blues' 2-1 defeat to Manchester City on Saturday.</p>
