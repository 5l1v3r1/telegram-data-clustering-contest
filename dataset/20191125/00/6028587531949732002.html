      <p>People come to Perth for many reasons—with a burgeoning foodie scene and plenty of pubs, bars and restaurants with live music, it’s a vibrant city despite its remote location 2,117 miles from Melbourne and 2,445 miles from Sydney. There’s a reason this part of the country is called “The Road Trip State” and with nonstop flights available from most major Australian cities—as well as other international destinations like London (as long as you don’t mind a 16.5-hour flight) Auckland, Kuala Lumpur, Tokyo, Bali, Hong Kong, Dubai, Doha, Singapore, Bangkok and Johannesburg—Perth is the natural gateway to Western Australia’s Margaret River wine region down south and several popular marine sanctuaries and national parks as you head up the West Coast.While Perth itself is certainly worthy of a trip in its own right—the nightlife in Northbridge, café culture in Subiaco, Scarborough Sunset Markets and beautiful Kings Park are just the tip of the iceberg—here are four other spots within a 30-minute drive (or ferry ride) of the city that are also worth a visit.</p>
      <h3>Fremantle</h3>

      <p>Just 25 minutes from the city center, Fremantle is artsy, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sandramacgregor/2019/11/16/why-you-need-to-visit-australias-free-thinking-town-of-fremantle-now/#5e129ce653e2">free-thinking</a> and fabulous—don’t miss <a href="https://theartisanstore.com.au/">The Artisan Store</a>, a place dedicated to supporting and promoting local artists, or the many exhibits and events at the <a href="https://www.fac.org.au/">Fremantle Arts Centre</a>. History buffs should stop by <a href="https://fremantleprison.com.au/">Fremantle Prison</a>. There’s a small section you can check out for free but it’s well worth the ticket price for one of the in-depth guided tours offered several times a day—or at night by torchlight, if you dare. On Friday, Saturday and Sunday, head to the historic <a href="https://www.fremantlemarkets.com.au/">Fremantle Markets</a> for fresh fruit and veggies, made-to-order food and unique souvenirs. Freo’s main drag is the <a href="https://helloperth.com.au/directories/cappuccino-strip/">Cappuccino Strip</a>, and you’ll find great little cafés, pubs, restaurants and bookshops, as well as stores featuring art and clothing made by local designers. End your day with a stroll on Bathers Beach, dinner along Fremantle Waterfront or drinks at <a href="https://littlecreatures.com.au/locations/fremantle/">Little Creatures’ Fremantle Brewery</a>.</p>
      <h3>Rottnest Island</h3>

        <figcaption>One of the most adorable reasons to visit Rottnest Island: the quokka.<cite>Getty</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>If you’re planning to visit what is likely the most Instagrammable place in all of Australia, board a ferry from Fremantle (25 minutes) to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kaeliconforti/2019/11/20/why-you-should-visit-rottnest-island-on-your-next-trip-to-western-australia">Rottnest Island</a>, home of the adorable little marsupial known as the quokka. Once you’ve captured the perfect quokka selfie—oh yeah, that’s a thing—spend the rest of the day hiking, biking, snorkeling, swimming, exploring the island by bus or learning about the island’s past as an Aboriginal penal colony on a <a href="http://gocultural.com.au/">guided walking tour</a>. Want to make it more than just a day trip? There are several accommodations options available on the island, including campgrounds, hotels, hostel dormitories, bungalows and a new <a href="https://www.discoveryholidayparks.com.au/discovery-rottnest-island">eco-friendly glamping</a> experience that opened last March.</p>
      <h3>Swan Valley</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Just a 25-minute drive from downtown Perth is Swan Valley, Western Australia’s oldest wine region with more than 180 years of winemaking under its belt. The area’s home to over 40 wineries, as well as six breweries, three cideries, two distilleries, and heaps of restaurants, cafés, shops and places to stay in case you’d rather turn this into a wine-filled weekend instead of doing a day trip. There are <a href="https://www.swanvalley.com.au/See-and-Do/The-Swan-Valley-Trails">several trails to choose from</a> depending on your interests—explore the region’s art, sweets, bush tucker and seasonal produce between sessions—or if you want someone else do all the driving, opt for <a href="https://www.onthegotours.com/Australia/Best-Places-To-Visit/Perth/Swan-Valley-Tour-with-Wine-Beer-and-Chocolate-Tastings">a full-day guided tour</a> or <a href="https://www.outandabouttours.com.au/Swan-Valley/River-Cruise---Vineyard.aspx">cruise down the Swan River</a> to the wineries instead.</p>
      <h3>John Forrest National Park</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Located about 30 minutes from downtown Perth, <a href="https://parks.dpaw.wa.gov.au/park/john-forrest">John Forrest National Park</a> is Western Australia’s first national park and has been welcoming visitors to explore its many trails, waterfalls and conservation areas full of native plants since November 1900. Long before that, it was considered to be a sacred place by the indigenous Nyoongar people, with parts of the land playing an important role in their Dreamtime stories. While its two waterfalls, Hovea and National Park Falls, flow strongest in the winter and spring, it’s still a beautiful place to visit all year long if you need some time away from all the hustle and bustle.</p>
