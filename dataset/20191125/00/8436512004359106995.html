      <h1>China back in global bond market with dollar deal</h1>
      <h2>Increased frequency is in lockstep with massive US Treasury rally; Targeting non-US investor base</h2>

      <p>China is raising US$6 billion by issuing sovereign bonds, less than a fortnight after <a href="http://bit.ly/35vmijf">it sold euro-denominated bonds.</a> This comes on the heels of its $3 billion issuance in 2018 and a $2 billion sale in 2017 when the sovereign visited the global bond market after a 13-year gap.</p>
      <p>The pick up in frequency of China’s visit to the offshore bond markets has to do with the stellar performance of international fixed income products in recent years.</p>
      <p>The global bond market has rallied massively since its October 2018 issuance and yields have tumbled quite sharply – the benchmark US 10-year yield has shrunk to 1.79% from 3.2%. Therefore, China can expect to raise funds at a much lower cost.</p>
      <p>Which in turn means lower borrowing costs for policy banks and quasi-sovereign issuers which use sovereign bonds as the base for pricing their bonds.</p>
      <p>The timing is quite shrewd – the possible cooling of the trade war into the New Year would mean the risk appetite could improve for Chinese government-linked issuers of bonds, especially those that come to the market infrequently. An updated sovereign yield curve would be beneficial for such borrowers.</p>
      <p>Bankers said the China sovereign bond issue would target regional investors who held a lot of dollar liquidity, lessening the reliance on US investors, the traditional base eyed by dollar-denominated bond issuers.</p>
      <p>China is looking to sell 5-, 10- and 20-year bonds in the issue which is expected to hit the market on Tuesday, according to a Bloomberg report.</p>
      <p>“The Chinese govt doesn’t need the money from the bond market – when they do a transaction such as this, I always see it as having a policy objective. It is probably to make the sovereign curve more complete, actively traded and to provide a better benchmark,” said a fixed income strategist.</p>
      <p>The demand is expected to be robust along the lines of this month’s euro-denominated bond transaction which received orders of 20 billion euros for a 4 billion offering.</p>
