      <p>New Zealand Cricket said they will apologise to England's Jofra Archer for the racial abuse he faced from a spectator at Mount Maunganui, and promised to step up vigilance at the next Test.</p>
      <p>Archer, who was playing his maiden Test outside England at the Bay Oval, took to Twitter after its conclusion on Monday, 25 November, to reveal he was the target of racist remarks on the final day of the match. The speedster had made a battling 30, trying to see out the final session and save the Test for his side, but was the penultimate wicket to fall on what would be the penultimate ball of the match as England slipped to an innings defeat.</p>
      <p>"A bit disturbing hearing racial insults today whilst battling to help save my team," he wrote. "[T]he crowd was been amazing this week except for that one guy <i>[sic]</i>".</p>

      <p>The England and Wales Cricket Board confirmed that the incident occurred when Archer was dismissed and walking off the field to the pavilion.</p>
      <p>New Zealand Cricket were quick to tender an apology to the Barbados-born pace bowler. "[NZC] will be contacting, and apologising to English fast bowler Jofra Archer, who was racially abused by a spectator as he left the field at the conclusion of the first Test at Bay Oval, Mt Maunganui," the board said in a statement.Â </p>
      <p>"It will contact Mr Archer tomorrow to apologise for the unacceptable experience, and to promise increased vigilance in the matter when the teams next meet in Hamilton."</p>

      <p>While security was "unable to locate the perpetrator", they would examine CCTV footage and make further inquiries, the board said. "NZC has zero tolerance towards abusive or offensive language at any of its venues and will refer any developments in the case to police."</p>
      <p>The ECB said they would be part of the investigation into the matter. "Whilst this is a relatively isolated incident there is absolutely no place for anti-social or racist behaviour within the game," they said in their statement. "[I]t is vitally important that all spectators feel able to come forward to report such behaviour and feel safe in doing so."</p>
