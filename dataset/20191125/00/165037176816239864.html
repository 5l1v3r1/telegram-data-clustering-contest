        <b>The Chilean footballer, on loan at Inter Milan, receives more money each season than all the Sheffield United players put together.</b>
      </p>
      <p>This weekend, <b>Premier League players' salaries were made public</b>. It was revealed that <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/a-sanchez-16967/">Alexis Sanchez</a><b> earns 21 million pounds a season</b>, around 24.5 million euros. </p>
      <p>The amount of money is massive in comparison to other teams. <b>Sheffield United pay their footballers 14 million pounds a year,</b> a few 16.3 million euros. </p>
      <p>If you add his transfer fee and other things to his salary,<b> he probably costs Man Utd around 171 million pounds</b>, almost 200 million euros. </p>
      <p>You have to remember, that said, that<b> Alexis is not the player who earns the most</b> at the 'Red Devils' - Inter paid very little to take him out on loan -.<b> The ex-Barca man earns 350,000 pounds a week,</b> more than 400,000 euros. </p>

      <p>Figures which speak clearly of<b> the spectacular salaries which are paid at Old Trafford</b>, but have not helped the team improve on the pitch. <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/manchester-united-fc">Man Utd</a> were held to a draw at Sheffield United,<b> at a side which earn less than Sanchez alone</b>. </p>
