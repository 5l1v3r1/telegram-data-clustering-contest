      <h1>Douglas Lima reacts to ‘MVP’s’ walk-off KO, wants to see Page beat ‘ranked opponents’ before he accepts rematch</h1>

      <p>Bellator welterweight champ Douglas Lima was impressed with Michael ‘Venom’ Page’s performance last night at Bellator London II, but the Brazilian would like to see ‘MVP’ beat some ranked opponents before he accepts a rematch.</p>

      <p>Page, 32, earned yet another highlight reel knockout victory against late notice replacement Giovanni Melillo (13-5) in the Bellator London II main event, finishing the Italian with a perfectly timed counter right hand in the opening round. The London Shootfighter was originally expected to face Bellator veteran Derek Anderson (16-3, 1 NC) but the American <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2019/11/19/20970127/mvp-giovanni-melillo-bellator-london-2-main-event-derek-anderson-scratched-mma">pulled out of the main event at the last minute — presumably due to injury</a>.</p>
      <p>Page fought Lima earlier this year in the Bellator 221 co-main event, losing via KO after being caught with a flush uppercut in the second round. Lima then went on to beat Rory MacDonald in the Bellator welterweight grand prix finals to become the promotion’s first ever three-time welterweight champion.</p>
      <p>Page, a former kickboxing champion, has won back-to-back fights since the Lima KO and <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/11/21/20974470/bellator-london-mma-news-interview-michael-page-mvp-douglas-lima-fight-rematch-knockout-ko">believes he will beat the Brazilian in a rematch</a>.</p>
