      <h1>Kiwi leads faint risk rally, Brexit promise lifts sterling</h1>

      <p>By Tom Westbrook</p>
      <p>SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar and export-focused currencies found support on Monday as positive signs for the U.S. economy and upbeat headlines on U.S.-China trade talks boosted investor confidence.</p>
      <p>The pound climbed, too, on hopes for an imminent Brexit and an end to years of political paralysis.</p>
      <p>The day's mood - tempered with weariness at the flow of trade news - was best illustrated by the New Zealand dollar. It rose 0.4% against the safe-haven Japanese yen (<a href="https://www.investing.com/currencies/nzd-jpy">NZDJPY=</a>) to 69.83 yen.</p>
      <p>"Even if the numbers are small, there's a message in there that risk appetite has improved," said Westpac FX strategist Sean Callow.</p>
      <p>The dollar added 0.1% on the yen to 108.76 yen and touched its highest level since Nov. 14 against the euro (<a href="https://www.investing.com/currencies/eur-usd">EUR=</a>) at $1.1012. It sat at 98.278 against a basket of currencies, just below a two-week high (<a href="https://www.investing.com/indices/usdollar">DXY</a>).</p>
      <p>Sterling rose 0.1% to $1.2847, after British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, whose Conservative Party leads in opinion polls ahead of the Dec. 12 election, promised to bring a deal to leave the European Union to parliament before Christmas.</p>
      <p>"The markets are holding on to any sort of positivity we get at the moment," said Sean MacLean, research strategist at Pepperstone, a brokerage in Melbourne. "We want to keep that momentum going."</p>
      <p>Keeping hopes for a breakthrough in trade talks alive was the weekend announcement of Chinese plans for improving protection of intellectual property rights - seen as a move to address a sticking point between the parties.</p>
      <p>U.S. national security adviser Robert O'Brien also said on Saturday a deal was possible by year's end.</p>
      <p>On the economic front, the greenback was buttressed by better-than-expected U.S. manufacturing data on Friday, seen as staving off the need for a rate cut. The main check on confidence has been rising tensions over Hong Kong.</p>
      <p>The city has been rocked by more than five months of anti-government protests, and Beijing has already reacted angrily to the passage of U.S. legislation backing protesters, which has cleared Congress but not been endorsed by President Donald Trump.</p>
      <p>"The price of the 'Hong Kong bill' will be increased underlying U.S.-China tensions," said Vishnu Varathan, head of economics and strategy at Mizuho Bank in Singapore, adding that means greater uncertainty around the trade deal.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, the day's optimistic sentiment was enough to lift the trade-exposed Australian dollar 0.2% higher on the greenback to $0.6796, and for the New Zealand dollar to gain 0.3% to $0.6421.</p>
      <p>China's yuan strengthened slightly to 7.0356.</p>
      <p>Later in the trading day focus is expected to shift to German service-sector data and a speech from the European Central Bank's Chief Economist Philip Lane at 1800 GMT.</p>
      <p>U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's makes a speech at 0000 GMT.</p>
