      <h1>Conspiracy Theory: Tesla Smashed Cybertruck Window on Purpose</h1>
      <h2>Let's be honest: If it was a PR stunt, it's been a resounding success.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://futurism.com/authors/victor" target="_blank">Victor Tangermann</a></address>
      <p>It was a stunt meant to show off the Cybertruck’s impenetrable defenses, warding off anything from a sledgehammer to a “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/22/elon-musk-net-worth-tesla-cybertruck">9mm handgun</a>,” according to Tesla CEO Elon Musk.</p>
      <p>But things seemingly didn’t go according to plan — Tesla’s chief designer Franz von Holzhausen tossed a hefty metal ball at the window in an attempt to show off the truck’s “bulletproof” windows — and <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/tesla-shows-off-bulletproof-cybertruck-breaks-window">smashed it.</a> He then took aim at the rear window and, prompting cringes across the internet, smashed that one too.</p>
      <p>Now, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/e0iib6/elon_musks_had_the_armored_windows_fail_on/">conspiracy theories</a> are popping up, claiming the entire thing was a stunt to get some free publicity. Hell, we’re still talking about it, right? And it sounds like a business success as well: So far, Musk claims the company has received <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1198788116372344832">over 200,000</a> pre-orders with “with no advertising &amp; no paid endorsement.”</p>
      <p>Reddit user JustinSThompson took a closer look at the video, and says it raises questions.</p>
      <p>“If there is so much variability in the throw, why not just skip it? They already demoed it with a 3.5m drop,” the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/e0iib6/elon_musks_had_the_armored_windows_fail_on/">Redditor wrote</a>. Von Holzhausen “doesn’t spend much time at all to look at the broken glass. His routine was rehearsed.”</p>
      <p>The theory, however, doesn’t account for the failed stunt wiping out Tesla’s stock.<i> Forbes </i><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/hayleycuccinello/2019/11/22/elon-musk-net-worth-cybertruck/#babed6e73aa7">reported</a> the day after the event that Elon Musk’s net worth fell $770 million after the gaffe, thanks to plummeting share prices.</p>
      <p>On Friday, Musk attempted to clear up the glass-breaking snafu by <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1198090787520598016">uploading a video</a> of von Holzhausen throwing a “steel ball at Cybertruck window right before launch,” on Twitter a night after the event. “Guess we have some improvements to make before production haha,” he added.</p>
      <p>“We threw same steel ball at same window several times right before event &amp; didn’t even scratch the glass!” Musk claimed in a <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1197987290317914112">different tweet</a>.</p>
      <p>And Musk didn’t give up there. In a following tweet on Sunday, Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1198772995021406209">offered up yet another explanation</a>, <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/elon-musk-excuse-smashing-cybertruck-window">claiming</a> that the “sledgehammer impact on door” from a preceding stunt “cracked base of glass, which is why steel ball didn’t bounce off.”</p>
      <p>So what is it? A PR stunt or an embarrassing accident? Either way, Tesla got away with a lot of free publicity. If it was indeed an awkward attempt to break into mainstream news, it was arguably a successful one.</p>
      <p>Besides, the glass is pretty darn strong no matter what. As Musk <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/tesla-shows-off-bulletproof-cybertruck-breaks-window">noted</a> himself seconds after the second window smashed on stage: “It didn’t go through, that’s the plus side.”</p>
