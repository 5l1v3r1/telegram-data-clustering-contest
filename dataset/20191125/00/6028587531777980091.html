      <p>As a mom of seven children, Vanessa Quigley, co-Founder of <a href="http://chatbooks.com/">Chatbooks</a>, is no stranger to mom guilt. In fact, it was an intense episode of mom guilt that drove her to co-found her company. After finding her youngest son crying in his room because he didn’t have an album of photos like his older siblings, she invented a way to get photos off her phone so she could share the memories with her family. Enter Chatbooks, a tool that takes photos from Instagram and automatically print them into photo books.Mom guilt, the feeling of guilt, doubt and anxiety experienced by mothers when they worry they're failing, is real. “Being present in my role at home as a mom and present in my role as co-founder of Chatbooks at the office is an ongoing challenge.” says Vanessa. That’s why she has spent the last few years working to help other moms and dads “hack” their way through the journey of parenthood. She’s written a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Real-Moms-Hacks-Parent-Tested-Tricks/dp/0692862625">book</a>, launched a successful <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-momforce-podcast-by-chatbooks/id1464755075">podcast</a>, built many new products (like a <a href="https://chatbooks.com/chatbooks-toddler-guarantee">Toddler Guarantee</a>), and most recently partnered with HP and a team of developmental psychologists to study the emotional and psychological impact that photographs have on our personal and family lives.</p>
      <p>For new, working or single parents, Vanessa shared with me her top tips for keeping mom guilt and work guilt at bay: </p>
      <p>
        <b>Ask for help</b>
      </p>
      <p>Both at home and at the office. “I have fallen victim to the mentality that the cheapest way to get something done is to do it myself. But, turns out that’s a recipe for disaster and burnout!” says Vanessa. Whether it’s a grandparent watching the kids while you make dinner or a sibling overseeing homework while you rest, do not be afraid to accept help from your loved ones or hire a team as needed. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Divide and conquer</b>
      </p>
      <p>Once you enroll some helpers, learn how to divide and conquer. You don’t have to do it all. Just surround yourself with talented and reliable people. “Sometimes my husband takes the big kids mountain biking, while I take the little kids to Costco.” says Vanessa. “I’ve also learned to trust my brilliant employees and cut back on meetings I do not need to attend,” she continued. Splitting up tasks can be the key to keeping it together.</p>
      <p>The key to achieving this is to let go of the need to control everything. Maybe you would do some things differently, but empower your team to complete tasks their way. Having high expectations and believing in the people around you is the first step in helping them succeed. And, their success equals your sanity! </p>
      <p>
        <b>Do your best and know that you’re doing great</b>
      </p>
      <p>As Vanessa explains, being a mom is tough and never-ending. It is easy to get overwhelmed with the mini failures of being a parent: forgetting lunch, being late for carpool pickup, etc.. But when you look at a photo of your family, <a href="https://www.chatbooks.com/printed-photo-report">research</a> shows that you feel like a good parent. Forget all those small, imperfect moments! Your kids are happy and alive! Taking the time to look back on a photo and remember that you are doing a great job can be a transformative shift in a day (or week, or month!) that feels overwhelming. “The same goes for the endless to-do list of building a company. When you look back on the first emails you sent, or your first version of your app, it’s hard not to marvel at how far you’ve come. It’s a great confidence boost!” - says Vanessa.</p>
