      <p>Last week’s episode of <i>The Walking Dead </i>ended with a shocking death–the most shocking death since the Season 9 midseason finale.<i>Spoilers follow.</i></p>
      <p>Back then it was Jesus, and nobody saw that coming. At the end of Season 9, a whole bunch of characters were killed, but if you’d read the comics or heard about them, you knew it was coming (though the TV show changed up who died pretty drastically).</p>
      <p>Last week it was Siddiq, one of my favorite characters and one that I’m not sure <i>The Walking Dead </i>can afford to lose. You can’t just keep killing off the most likable characters–like Jesus–and shipping off leads like Rick and Michonne, and expect fans to keep watching. Yes, characters need to die. No, they don’t always have to be the best ones.</p>
      <p>If this trend continues we’ll soon lose Aaron and Luke as well.</p>
      <h3>Dante</h3>
      <p>In any case, tonight’s episode picks back up where last week’s left off. Siddiq is dead and Dante, the spy and saboteur and murderer, is hovering over his body with a knife when Rosita shows up. She can tell something’s up. Dante is breathing heavily and covered in sweat. He hasn’t had time to cover up his deed, and Rosita starts to back away slowly.</p>
      <p>He pulls the knife from behind his back and starts walking toward her, and she says wait and sets her baby down. Then he’s on her and she’s fighting for her life. Meanwhile, Siddiq is zombifying in the other room and the baby is wailing.</p>
      <p>It’s an incredibly tense fight and Dante’s true colors really come out. Last week when he killed Siddiq he said “Not you. Not like this!” as though he really was choked up about having to kill a friend. But this time he says to Rosita, “In nature, parents often eat their young,” as Siddiq, wheezing and snarling, shuffles toward his baby.</p>
      <p>Rosita manages to grab Dante’s knife and stab him with it, and then charges into Siddiq, driving the knife into his skull. It must be hard to kill a zombified loved one, but to have to do it without any pause because he’s about to eat your baby? That’s just rough. The whole thing is heartbreaking.</p>
      <p>This edge-of-your-seat scene came after the intro when we learn Alpha’s plan for Dante. Apparently Lydia didn’t know him, so he was the perfect mole. She had him meet up with a group of people, who he cleverly got to save his life, and then those people came to Alexandria and were welcomed in.</p>
      <p>He slipped through the proverbial cracks and set to work sabotaging the community–poisoning the water, killing the occasional sick person and so forth. An insidious plan, to be sure–though poisoning water could have also made Lydia sick, and even killed her so . . . .</p>
      <h3>Alexandria</h3>

      <p>Once Dante’s caught, he starts spouting off about how weak they all are. Doing the right thing will be their undoing. Everything is doomed and no one will be spared. He tells them that Siddiq wasn’t part of the plan–that he genuinely liked him. Cold comfort.</p>
      <p>Everyone is struggling with how they missed it this whole time. Rosita is in bad shape, and goes to blow off steam walker-killing. She’s too rattled, though, and almost bites it. Eugene saves her, and offers her his condolences for Siddiq’s death.</p>
      <p>Gabriel watches the footage of Dante’s interview. He’s trying to figure it all out when Rosita comes in and tells him about almost dying. She tells him she’s lost her edge and he basically tells her she’s overreacting and that this too shall pass. There are more pressing matters.</p>
      <p>“Maybe Dante was right,” she spits back. “Maybe we aren’t as strong as we think we are.”</p>

      <p>All is not well in the bizarre pairing of Gabriel and Rosita. Gabriel goes to visit Dante in his cell and does what Maggie wanted to do to Negan. They talk for a bit. “I haven’t always been brave,” Gabriel tells him. “Do we deserve a second chance? I don’t know. But sometimes we get one anyway.”</p>
      <p>Then Gabriel stabs Dante. He stabs him again and again and again.</p>
      <p>It’s a great moment of passion and vengeance from Gabriel, who–ever since he shed the coward’s mantle–has been the voice of reason and patience and caution above all else. The bloody work is humanizing, somehow. The bloodless Gabriel, now smeared in crimson.</p>
      <p>They bury Siddiq. He will be missed.</p>
      <h3>The Searchers</h3>

      <p>Aaron gets intel from Gamma, who feels both betrayed by Alpha and guilty over her role in her own sister’s death. She wants to see her sister’s child and she’s willing to give Aaron what he wants: The location of Alpha’s zombie herd.</p>
      <p>So a searching party heads out. Daryl and Carol and Connie and Magna and Aaron and Jerry and Kelly. A small crew. Daryl doesn’t trust Aaron’s source and thinks they should be searching for Lydia instead.</p>
      <p>Carol and Daryl have some tension here, but not the sexual tension we’ve seen earlier in the season. He tell her she’s been like a ghost ever since she came back from the boat, and she says she’s trying but it’s hard. He tells her to let go of her revenge. Alpha’s not worth it. Words that fall on deaf ears. He’s also annoyed that Carol let her go, and justifiably so. But Carol isn’t in a position to listen to other people these days, and says showing her to Gamma was the right call. Maybe it was.</p>
      <p>They come to the spot Gamma told Aaron and Daryl cries out in frustration.</p>
      <p>Nothing. No herd.</p>
      <p>But Aaron still believes Gamma. Maybe the herd was here and has been recently moved. Daryl heads off to find Lydia with the others close behind when Carol spots a familiar dirty, bald head across a clearing.</p>
      <figure>

      <p>Alpha smirks and runs off, and Carol gives chase. I’m not really sure what to make of Carol at this point. She’s been incredibly reckless, and while I do understand her grief and trauma, I also think she’s being a bit ridiculous and putting too many lives at risk because of her own selfish need for vengeance. She doesn’t think things through. She just acts and reacts.</p>
      <p>So off they run, following Carol who follows Alpha and they all end up in a giant cave filled with walkers. Fade to black.</p>
      <p>It’s a reasonably exciting cliffhanger, I suppose, though my main question at this point is “When will this stupid Whisperer conflict be over?” The show has been consistently strong all season and last, but I’m just weary of the Whisperers and their stupid masks and the herd. I’d have preferred they wrapped up the entire arc at this point, but wishes won’t make it so.</p>
      <h3>Michonne and Virgil</h3>

      <p>This was a long episode–80 minutes with commercial, and about 54 without. Those extra 12 minutes of content allowed Angela Kang to pack in a third storyline.</p>
      <p>Michonne, Luke and Judith are on their way to Oceanside when they decide to pay a visit to a library.</p>
      <p>While there, Michonne finds out about Siddiq’s death. They also encounter a stranger. Luke gets snagged by a walker in the stacks and he’s almost zombie food when a man appears out of nowhere and saves him.</p>
      <p>He runs off, understandably not trusting the stranger he just saved. “Wait!” Luke calls after him. “Thanks?”</p>
      <p>They continue to Oceanside where they once again run into the strange man. He was trying to steal a ship and other supplies but was caught red-handed. Michonne, fresh on the news of Dante and Siddiq–is almost certain he’s a Whisperer.</p>
      <p>There’s a melee with some walkers and later Michonne questions the man. He says his name is Virgil (Kevin Carroll) and he’s just trying to get back to his family. At first, he refuses to tell her where they are since it would endanger them (smart man). But he relents when she says there’s no other way they’ll let him go.</p>
      <p>Turns out, maybe they can help one another he says. He lives on an island on a fortified naval base. There are weapons there that could help take down Alpha. Michonne agrees to go with him, but only her, nobody else.</p>
      <p>Could this be how Michonne exits the show? Something to do with Virgil and this new group? It would make sense, though Virgil seems like a good enough guy. Then again, Dante didn’t seem so bad, either.</p>
      <h3>Verdict</h3>

      <p>All told a solid episode, though not as monumental as I expected. The Gabriel vs Dante and Rosita vs Dante scenes were both spectacular, but the whole “find the herd” plot and everything Whisperer related–including the weirdly anticlimactic cliffhanger–are just “meh.”</p>
      <p>I think the story of a secret bad guy hiding out in Alexandria is, in and of itself, quite compelling. Divorced from the Whisperer plot and tied to a less fantastical foe, it could have been really great–especially if they’d introduced Dante even longer ago, perhaps even last season.</p>
      <p>Also, they should have showed how he got there much earlier, rather than just have him there already. Why not show him being rescued by the other group and then heading to Alexandria? Then later show that it was all staged.</p>
      <p>But really, I’d just prefer less over-the-top bad guys in this show. Dante, as far as I’m concerned, is a better villain than Alpha. He seemed like a friend–that one may smile and smile and be a villain! His betrayal was awful and tragic. That’s more gripping drama than Alpha hissing about whatever lame nonsense she believes in. And it’s more convincing than the notion that all these people would follow her and wear silly masks all the time and give up their names.</p>
      <p>So yeah, for my money I’d love to see more human drama, more betrayal, more surprising deaths and conflict that stems from more basic human needs. A small group of bad guys infiltrating Alexandria to get supplies or sneakily take everyone out would be a better story than the Whisperers. Sometimes you just gotta ditch the comics.</p>
      <p>Actually, Dante sort of scratched that itch I had several seasons ago. I thought for sure Enid was a spy for the Wolves but then it turned out that the Wolves were basically a non-factor (because we had to rush to Negan and the Saviors ASAP) and Enid was just genuinely boring as hell.</p>
      <p>What did you make of this episode? Excited for Season 10B? Let me know on <a href="https://www.twitter.com/erikkain/">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/erikkainwriter/">Facebook</a>.</p>
      <p>Oh, and P.S. the new <i>Walking Dead </i>show is called ‘World Beyond’ and I am still not loving the teen vibe they have going with it whatsoever. Maybe it’ll be terrific, but this latest trailer does not have me filled with optimism.</p>
