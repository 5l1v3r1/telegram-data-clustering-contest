      <p>FORMER India captain Kapil Dev on Sunday advised students to give autographs rather than seek autographs. “Work hard and make it big in life. Then you will not have to seek autographs, but give autographs…” he said.</p>
      <p>Dev was in Chinchwad for the Elpro Sports Festival organised by Elpro International School, in which thousands of students participated across various categories.</p>
      <p>The sports festival, which started on November 9, marked its grand finale with the winners and achievers being commemorated by the legendary cricketer. The festival provided a common platform for students to show their talent.</p>
      <p>“It is so wonderful to see the sportsman spirit of all these young kids. I have always believed that sports is not just about winning, it is about building interpersonal bonds, camaraderie and above all, participating for the glory of the game and the spirit of sportsmanship. I am thankful to Elpro International School for inviting me and making me an integral part of this spectacular sports show,” said Dev.</p>
      <p>He added that education and sports should go hand-in-hand. “Pune is an educational seat and therefore, it seems education is the priority here. But at the same time, sports should also be encouraged,” he said.</p>
