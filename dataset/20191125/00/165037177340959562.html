        <b>Everton are planning the possible sacking of Marco Silva and if this situation occurs, the 'Express' state that David Moyes would be willing to listen to an offer from the club.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Everton's aspirations in the Premier League this season have<b> taken a turn for the worse</b> after 13 matches so far.</p>
      <p>They started the season with the <b>Europa League in mind</b>, but after 4 wins, 2 draws and 6 defeats, the Toffees<b> should concentrate on not getting relegated</b>, since they are just 4 points above the relegation zone.</p>
