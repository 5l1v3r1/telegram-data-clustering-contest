        <b>Jenson Button claims he spent 17 hours stranded in the desert during his off-road racing debut, after his truck's differential broke during the Baja 1000.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 2009 Formula 1 world champion was contesting the multi-class off-road classic in a spec Trophy Truck, sporting similar colours to those used by Brawn GP during his title-winning F1 campaign.</p>
      <p>Button hit trouble in the Mexican event when he and his co-driver Terry Madden heard a "loud clatter" and lost all drive.</p>
      <p>"We come away from the Baja 1000 with a story to tell, not the one we wanted but a great Baja story all the same," Button posted on Instagram.</p>
      <p>"[We] started well, passed five moving trucks and then another seven/eight broken or crashed, found a really good rhythm of looking after the truck when needed and hammering the fast flowing sections.</p>
      <p>"At mile 235 Terry Madden my co-driver and I heard a really loud clatter and lost drive, we had broken the differential."</p>
      <p>Button said the breakdown was peculiar because "all temps were good" and that he and Madden had taken care of the truck, but added "this happens".</p>
      <p>"The problem was we had found the most remote place to breakdown which meant we spent the whole night and a total of 17 hours under the stars," he continued.</p>
      <p>"The only people we saw were other racers asking us to wipe their dirty light bars clean.</p>
      <p>"Fuelled by energy bars and a fire that needed constant help as all we could find was twigs, Terry and I could just enjoy the moment of peacefulness by telling stories which always ended with "it's Baja".</p>
      <p>"A life experience but not the one I expected. But I'll take it."</p>
      <p>Since retiring from F1 following a long stint with McLaren, Button has contested Super GT in Japan, winning the title in 2018, and also took part in the '18/19 World Endurance Championship with the SMP Racing LMP1 outfit.</p>
      <p>He has ended both programmes, but said earlier this month he plans to <a href="https://www.autosport.com/wec/news/147164/button-plans-wec-return-for-hypercar-era">return to the WEC</a> when the top-class hypercar rules are introduced, and that he wants to run in more one-off events.</p>
      <p>Last year's IndyCar runner-up Alexander Rossi also contested the Baja 1000, won by motorcycle rider Justin Morgan, and led before a minor roll stunted his progress.</p>
      <p>He was able to continue, though he and co-drivers Jeff Proctor and Pat Dailey ultimately retired.</p>
