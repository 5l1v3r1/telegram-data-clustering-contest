      <p>We are more than 200 years away from true gender parity at work. And looking past the moral issues that this point raises, it’s shocking that so many companies fail to recognize the clear and measurable business results that gender diversity contributes to a company’s bottom line. Companies that are gender and ethnically diverse are up to <b>35% more likely to outperform</b> than the industry median, according to McKinsey &amp; Company’s 2019 <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/gender-equality/women-in-the-workplace-2019">Women in the Workplace</a> report. So why aren’t businesses doing more to advance gender equality?A few weeks ago I had the pleasure of speaking and co-hosting <a href="http://www.fairygodboss.com/?utm_source=forbespress">Fairygodboss</a>’s annual <a href="https://info.fairygodboss.com/2020BlueprintforGenderDiversity.html?utm_medium=PR&amp;utm_source=Forbes&amp;utm_campaign=2020blueprint">Galvanize</a> event where I met with and listened to top leaders in the diversity and recruiting space. Attendees shared insights and identified strategies that their own companies had adopted to accelerate gender equality in the workplace.</p>
      <p>As my co-founder Romy Newman succinctly stated, “Companies that hire and retain great female talent will be the ones that win.”</p>
      <p>Here are three key takeaways from Galvanize that everyone can use to help advance gender equality:</p>
      <p>
        <b>1. It’s up to all of us.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The CMO at William Morris Endeavor and award-winning marketing executive <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/karineldor/2019/08/30/how-marketing-powerhouse-bozoma-boz-saint-john-overcomes-self-doubt-and-uses-her-voice/#4a8891202304">Bozoma Saint John</a>, told the audience about her time at Uber and how others constantly assumed she was the head of diversity for the company — simply because she is a black woman. She went on to say that because of her position of power, she chose to assume some of the responsibility for diversity at Uber, but said that she wasn’t going to let it be just <i>her</i> job. It’s the job of every person in every room, every day of the year to make meaningful changes. </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/about-us/leadership/david-kenny/">David Kenny</a>, CEO of Chief Diversity Officer of Nielsen, went as far as adding CDO to his title. “I think too often we expect people of different backgrounds to own the conversation around diversity, but it really must be the responsibility of a CEO,” he said. “We’re not going to solve gender diversity in the workplace until CEOs and shareholders play a part,” Kenny continued. “And it starts with CEOs owning the conversation.” In addition to adding CDO to his title, Kenny also requires all executives to serve as sponsors for employee resource groups and for every position filled at the company, at least two women must be actively considered.</p>
      <p>
        <b>2. Improve communication skills across the board.</b>
      </p>
      <p>During an off-stage conversation with <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Business/att-business-names-anne-chow-1st-female-ceo/story?id=65408600">Anne Chow</a>, CEO of AT&amp;T Business, I learned about the initiatives AT&amp;T takes to improve internal communications. “Minority women get left behind,” Chow told me. “And at AT&amp;T we realized that all of these women were operating in silos – Black women, Latina women, Asian women – and we needed to find a way to bring them together so we started a company-wide diversity initiative to draw people out of their silos. When we brought together a select group of people from each of these silos, they started having conversations and quickly realized that they had many more similarities than they originally thought. The intersectionality between these groups was an interesting discovery and helped create insightful and impactful dialogues across the entire company.”</p>
      <p>Earlier this year I published an article about the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/georgenehuang/2019/08/26/new-study-finds-men-want-to-help-women-at-work-but-just-dont-know-how/#3ae283f019c0">importance of bringing male allies into the conversation</a> and research showed men want to help, but don’t know how. This year’s Galvanize theme centered around engaging male allies and after hearing from leaders at AT&amp;T, Facebook, Nielsen, Deloitte and Salesforce it became clear that creating a culture of inclusion is key to involving male colleagues in diversity initiatives. </p>
      <p>In addition, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/wjpost/">Will Post</a>, Industry Manager of US Marketing Solutions at Facebook, said, “Men must understand that being an ally is not an act of heroism and we are at a real moment in time to accelerate the path to gender equality. Inclusion is about making sure that everyone, especially women, are heard. And men can play a huge role in making that happen by simply listening.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>3. Use data to power the conversation.</b>
      </p>
      <p>A common theme and fear from speakers was that the public may experience some degree of fatigue when it comes to the topic of gender equality. But, “Diversity can’t come off the table when times get hard,” warned <a href="https://www.essence.com/lifestyle/money-career/annie-jean-baptiste-google-diversity-careers-interview/">Annie Jean-Baptiste</a>, Head of Product Inclusion at Google.</p>
      <p>By tying diversity efforts to business initiatives, you can help keep everyone within the company accountable. For example, when looking to restructure or set goals for hiring, determine specific metrics on which you will measure success. </p>
      <p>“For every 100 men, only 72 women are promoted. For black women, it’s even worse. And for Latina women, it’s worse than that,” said <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/our-people/mekala-krishnan">Mekala Krishnan</a>, a senior fellow at the McKinsey Global Institute when discussing their 2019 Women in the Workplace report. Companies should use this information as a benchmark and see where they fall – and then determine how they can do better. As Krishnan stated, diversity is “not just the right thing to do, it’s the smart thing to do.” </p>
