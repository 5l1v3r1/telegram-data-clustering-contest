      <h1>Unpacking Baffling Sam Allardyce Comments on British Managers in Viral Clip</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.90min.com/users/14534390" target="_blank">Robbie Copeland</a></address>
      <p>There are a few inevitabilities around this time of year. The trees will go bare, Mariah Carey will come on the radio <i>and</i> Sam Allardyce will pop up with some audacious, controversial nonsense in the press to remind us all that he still exists. </p>
      <p>What's he been saying to it this time? Well, trophies are irrelevant apparently (unless you're Mauricio Pochettino). He also trotted out one of his greatest hits that name and nationality are the only factors that stopped him landing the Manchester United job.</p>

      <p>Have a gander below a some of the quotes from the talkSPORT clip that, despite the vast array of utter gibberish he is able to cram in, is somehow only 90 seconds long.</p>
      <p>It's a skill, really. </p>

      <p>Sam's discourse starts when it is put to him that in order to achieve a top job in England now, you have to have some trophies on your CV. Not an unreasonable point, really - of the nine appointments made by 'big six' sides since 2015, seven had prior major honours on their CV. </p>
      <p>Sam opts to blow past that, however, and the convincing arguments that could have been made involving Frank Lampard and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, instead using the opportunity for a thinly-veiled dig at Mauricio Pochettino, who has just been sacked after...drumroll please...failing to win a trophy. </p>
      <p>No-one's saying there aren't exceptions, just that a record of winning things is helpful when trying to manage teams who want to, y'know, win things. </p>
      <p>Sam Allardyce last won a competition in 1998, the Third Division with Notts County, in case you're wondering why he's getting defensive. </p>

      <p>And from there, he only doubles down. Apparently, achieving success in Scotland means nothing, since anyone could win a trophy with Celtic or, maybe, Rangers. He can't decide on that last one. </p>
      <p>The startling ignorance shown here is genuinely incredible. While most competent managers could win the Scottish Premiership with Celtic, just winning the league isn't enough - ask Ronny Deila that one. To succeed at that club you need to be capable of achieving a level of consistent performance domestically and in Europe that goes beyond anything the big man has ever been able to dream of. </p>
      <p>Even Brendan Rodgers, who won every domestic trophy over a three-year period (and moved on to manage Leicester, where he now sits on course for a far better finish than Sam Allardyce has ever achieved in the top flight) was heavily criticised for his Celtic side's performances in Europe. </p>
      <p>Allardyce, of course, would not even get within a sniff of the Celtic job were it to become available - which perhaps explains his sneering condescension. </p>

      <p>Something close to a coherent point here - it is difficult to question Dyche's exemplary record with Burnley over the past few seasons. </p>
      <p>Again, though, when you look at the managers who have achieved any level of sustained success with England's top clubs in recent years - Klopp, Guardiola, Mourinho and the likes - virtually all had won trophies prior to joining. </p>
      <p>The reality is that very few Dyche-esque managers ever do successfully make the jump up. David Moyes moved to Manchester United from a similar position and we all saw how that went. </p>
      <p>Sam Allardyce has of course never won a cup final. </p>

      <p>Aaaaaaaand here's the crescendo. The money shot. The main event.</p>
      <p>Of course, Sam, of course the fact that you're English and not Italian is the only reason you have never managed a club like <a href="http://90min.com/teams/manchester-united">​Manchester United</a>. Because discrimination against English managers is the only reason no English manager has ever won the Premier League - there is no other explanation. </p>
      <p>Of the current top flight, incidentally, nine of the 20 managers are British, so the only thing holding Sam back is a proven lack of ability to achieve anything beyond mediocrity. </p>
      <p>Maybe if he took winning trophies a bit more seriously, that wouldn't be the case. </p>
