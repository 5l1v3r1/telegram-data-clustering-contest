        <b>Midfielder Mubarak Wakaso has expressed delight in marking his injury return for Deportivo Alaves with victory against Eibar in La Liga on Sunday. </b>
      </p>
      <p>The Ghana international missed the Black Stars' double AFCON 2021 qualifier against South Africa and Sao Tome after he suffered an injury to his right hand before the break.</p>
      <p>Wakaso has made steady progress from injury, and lasted the entire duration as the Gloriosso traveled to beat Eibar 2-0 at the Municipal de Ipurua stadium.</p>
      <p>" +3 points. Thanks to ALLAH &amp; each of you who helped me with prayers to come back strongly,  i got all your messages &amp; I really appreciate the love and the support," he tweeted after the game. </p>
      <p>Former Newcastle forward Joselu netted both goals for the away side.</p>
      <p>Wakaso has been a key figure in Asier Geratino's side's this season and was magnificent on Sunday despite playing with his  right hand heavily bandaged.</p>
      <p>The 29-year old has featured in 12 La Liga games this campaign, missing just a game through suspension.</p>
      <p>The former Villareal man has also popped up on the radar of La Liga rivals Getafe, who are keen on signing the player in January.</p>
