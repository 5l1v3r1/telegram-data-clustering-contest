      <p>There’s been a desperate bid for more volunteer firefighters as it’s revealed one of the towns closest to disaster this week has just a handful of active CFS members. And they’re not the only ones.</p>
      <p>The Edithburgh Country Fire Service brigade has just six active volunteers and has faced the prospect of closure for the past six years, because of low membership numbers.</p>
      <p>“It’s challenging – we can only work with what we’ve got,” Captain Leith Smith, a father of two, said.</p>
      <p>“It doesn’t take a real lot of your own time to become a volunteer and I think it’s good to support your own community.”</p>
      <p>Three of the brigade’s firefighters joined more than 200 from across SA to fight Wednesday’s blaze, which started on the outskirts of Yorketown and tore across 5000ha.</p>
      <p>At least five homes were destroyed and several more damaged in the fire – caused by an electrical fault – before it was contained Thursday evening.</p>
      <p>But as the dangerous reality of bushfires began to dawn on the tiny town of about 500 people, three new volunteers signed up to the brigade on Friday morning.</p>

      <p>The brigade needs at least 15 to warrant staying open.</p>
      <p>In Yorketown, there are more than 20 volunteers in its CFS brigade.</p>
      <p>Yorke Peninsula mayor Darren Braund doesn’t want a devastating fire to be a catalyst for anything, but it may prompt people to sign up.</p>
      <p>CFS chief officer Mark Jones said all rural brigades face the prospect of closure due to dwindling population.</p>
      <p>“We don’t want to close any of them, we want all of our stations and brigades to stay active,” he told <i>The Advertiser</i>.</p>
      <p>“More people are moving away, farms are getting bigger, so there are fewer people on the ground.”</p>
      <p>Emergency Services Minister Corey Wingard is equally as hopeful to bolster the state’s ranks of 13,000 CFS volunteers – 10,000 of which are firefighters.</p>
      <p>“The CFS do so much in their community, fighting fires is one thing but there are so many more things that are done within a CFS organisation,” he said while visiting Edithburgh yesterday.</p>
      <p>“It’s a great social point for people to gather in small communities such as this and they give so much back.”</p>
      <p>Mr Wingard was joined by Premier Steven Marshall in Yorketown and Edithburgh, who described the fire scenes as “devastating”, but was inspired by the community’s resilience.</p>
      <p>“I’ve never felt as proud as I do today as Premier of South Australia with so many different organisations coming together to do what they can for our friends here …” he said.</p>
      <p>“The fact that there has been no human loss of life is a miracle, because the conditions on Wednesday were catastrophic.”</p>
      <p>Mr Wingard also said the Government would release a bushfire information smartphone app in the next few weeks and it will be built around New South Wales RFS “Fires Near Me” app.</p>
      <p>Mr Jones said two firefighters had been injured, but were expected to make a full recovery.</p>
