      <h1>Xabi Alonso: Why the Premier League Was Better When the Spaniard Was at Liverpool</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.90min.com/users/15111589" target="_blank">Ed Alexander</a></address>
      <p>​It's been more than a decade since the Premier League lost one of its most prized possessions, and English football just hasn't been the same since.</p>
      <p>You can use whatever words you want to describe Xabi Alonso, yet none would truly capture the talents of the man. You had to see him in action to understand the Spaniard's remarkable abilities, but it's his 37th birthday, so <i>90min </i>will attempt to do so anyway. As a treat, here's an ode to the former Liverpool midfielder and his stellar career at Anfield.</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/liverpool">​Reds</a> experienced an extraordinary fall from grace when Alonso completed a £30m switch to <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/real-madrid">​Real Madrid</a> in the summer of 2009, back when such a sum of money actually meant something.</p>
      <p>During the Spaniard's stay on Merseyside, the club twice placed third in the <a href="https://www.90min.com/leagues/premier-league">​Premier League</a>, with Rafa Benitez's men finishing as runners-up in his final season with the side. </p>
      <p>When Alonso was around, they only failed to secure a top four spot on one occasion. Even that couldn't stop them qualifying for the following year's <a href="https://www.90min.com/categories/champions-league">​Champions League</a>, Liverpool overcoming a three-goal deficit to beat <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/milan">​AC Milan</a> in the 2005 European Cup final.</p>
      <p>In the four years that came after he joined Real, the Reds faithful watched their team crumble. The glory days were well and truly over as the side fell to sixth position, then seventh, and then down to a lowly eighth. </p>

      <p>Losing Alonso is not the sole cause of a dark chapter in Liverpool's history, though having him at the club would have helped keep the ship steady. Alongside Steven Gerrard, he was the heartbeat of the side.</p>
      <p>The pair were like metronomes in the Reds' midfield, seamlessly spreading the play and finding teammates in space. It was like having two quarterbacks, Alonso and Gerrard dictating from deep.</p>
      <p>With such a phenomenal partnership still intact, Liverpool would have been able to weather the storm. When everything around them was starting to crash and burn, they would have kept Benitez's men on course, such was their influence on performances and results.</p>
      <p>Alonso's decision to leave Anfield brought an end to that stunning relationship, and the Premier League is yet to see another double act like them. He and Gerrard were the perfect marriage of power and poise.</p>

      <p>The duo complimented each other wonderfully, each offering sublime technique, an innate understanding of the game, and a fearless mindset. All three are qualities that typified the World Cup winner's approach to football.</p>
      <p>Recall the classic goal Alonso netted against <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/newcastle">​Newcastle United</a> in 2006. Comfortably inside his own half, the Basque sent a sumptuous drive down the field and over the head of opposing goalkeeper Steve Harper to set Liverpool on their way to a 2-0 triumph.</p>
      <p>That effort demonstrates what an immaculate, unique player he was. Few of his colleagues would have the vision to see Harper off his line. Even less would have had the audacity to go for it. Practically none would have executed it with such ease.</p>
      <p>Some may say Alonso's strike versus the Magpies was mostly down to luck. Those doubters should have another trip down memory lane and look at how he scored his previous two goals.</p>

      <p>The playmaker had not found the net since January that year, when he'd grabbed a brace in the 5-3 FA Cup victory against Luton Town. His first of the match was nothing special, just a venomous 40-yard volley that dipped viciously into the back of Marlon Beresford's goal. </p>
      <p>In the closing minutes of the encounter, Alonso outdid himself. Off-balance, he whipped a delightful effort from all of 65 yards into an empty net, Beresford having ventured upfield in search of an equaliser.</p>
      <p>These are exquisite pieces of skill, where the margin for error is non-existent, and Alonso is making it look like child's play. </p>
      <p>Of course, having supreme technical ability can only get you so far. It was his mental attributes that took La Barba Roja to the top of the sport. His unwavering self-belief, desire for perfection, uncanny knack for reading the game, and competitive edge saw him become a modern legend. </p>

      <p>Without his iron mindset, Premier League crowds would not have marvelled and rejoiced at Alonso. They would not have witnessed how he controlled and dominated matches, how he redefined the role of a midfielder.</p>
