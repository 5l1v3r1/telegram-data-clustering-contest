      <h1>Kogi: Oshiomhole Suffering From Diarrhea – Dino Melaye</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">George Ogbolu</a></address>
      <p>The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate for the Kogi West senatorial rerun election, Dino Melaye, has lambasted the national chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Adams Oshiomhole.</p>
      <p><b>Naija News</b> recalls that Oshiomhole had mocked Senator Dino Melaye, saying he won’t return to the Nigerian Senate.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/21/just-in-inec-fixes-date-for-kogi-west-supplementary-re-run-election/"><u><b>Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC)</b></u></a> has fixed November 30 for Supplementary election in Kogi West Senatorial district.</p>
      <p>Speaking at the APC NEC meeting, <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/23/dino-melaye-will-lose-like-saraki-shehu-sani-others-oshiomhole/"><u>Oshiomhole said Dino Melaye</u></a> would join the other 15 National Assembly members that rebelled against the party.</p>
      <p>He said: <i>“Mr President, I also believe, it is significant to point out that those who rebel against this party, who sought to bring us down, who decamped at a critical moment, believing that their defection would destabilise us and we would have no enough time to makeup, 16 of them (would have regretted their action).</i></p>
      <p><i>“By the special grace of God, Nigerian electorate have chosen to punish them with their PVCs and their ballot papers. They were all voted out, and APC senators were voted in to replace them. The electorate also elected more members of House of Representatives on the APC platform</i>.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“There is one that is still struggling but as it is, he is at 20,000 feet below ground level and he’s hoping that there would be a miracle that would bring him to ground level and climb the tree to the Senate but by the special grace of God, under your leadership, that deficit, there will be no miracles in the election, particularly when they are free and fair.</i>
      </p>
      <p>Reacting while featuring on Channels TV, Melaye stressed Oshiomhole cannot determine the outcome of the supplementary election to be conducted by INEC.</p>
      <p>He said: <i>“The verbal diarrhea by the Chairman of APC boasting that 16 of us left the APC and I am the only one standing and in a matter of days, he said I will leave the Senate; I want to say that is human verdict but there is a God verdict.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“My seat will not be vacant, I will continue to be a senator of the Federal Republic of Nigeria by the grace of God in the next four years.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“I won that election and we have our pink copies of all our unit results. These have been tabulated and clearly, I won that election and Smart Adeyemi, in his good conscience, knows that I won that election.”</i>
