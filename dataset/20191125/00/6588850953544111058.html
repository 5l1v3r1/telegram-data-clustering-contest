      <p>Uber has been stripped of its licence to operate in London after failing to stop unlicensed and uninsured drivers picking up thousands of passengers.</p>
      <p>Transport for London (TfL) found that at least 14,000 trips were made with drivers who were different to the ones shown on the app.</p>
      <p>This was due to a system change allowing unauthorised drivers to upload their photographs to legitimate Uber driver accounts, the transport body said.</p>
