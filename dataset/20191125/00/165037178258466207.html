        <b>Hoffenheim missed out on an opportunity to move into the Bundesliga's top four on Sunday, suffering a heavy 5-1 home defeat by a Mainz side playing under newly appointed coach Achim Beierlorzer.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The hosts failed to<b> win for the first time in five games </b>as the visitors moved out of the<b> relegation zone </b>to 13th spot with only their third victory of the campaign.</p>
      <p>Beierlorzer, who was sacked by struggling <b>Cologne </b>nine days before taking over at the Opel Arena on November 18, started his reign successfully despite Ridle Baku's first-half red card as Cameroon midfielder <b>Pierre Kunde Malong scored twice</b> to open his account for the season.</p>
      <p>Levin Oeztunali claimed the first goal of proceedings on 33 minutes before his midfield partner Baku was dismissed seconds before the break for a studs-up challenge on the home side's Sebastian Rudy.</p>
      <p>Mainz continued to attack in the second half, peppering the Hoffenheim box until an own goal from Pavel Kaderabek in the 52nd minute doubled their lead.</p>
      <p>Kunde tapped in for his first of the season 10 minutes later before Andrej Kramaric claimed a consolation effort for the home side in the 83rd minute.</p>
      <p>Jean-Paul Boetius snuffed out any chance of a comeback in the 90th minute, however, scoring on the break to make it 4-1 and Kunde added his second two minutes later to complete the rout.</p>
      <p>Mainz coach Beierlorzer praised sacked former boss Sandro Schwarz, dedicating the victory to him.</p>
      <p>"It was an amazing achievement," Â Beierlorzer said. "Sandro deserves a very, very large share of it. It's guaranteed that the team fought for him today and brought home the victory."</p>
      <p>- Hertha woes continue -</p>
      <p>Earlier on Sunday, goalkeeper Rune Jarstein was sent off as Hertha Berlin continued to stutter, losing 4-0 at Augsburg.</p>

      <p>Hertha lost a fifth straight game and slid below Augsburg after Philipp Max, Sergio Cordova, Andre Hahn and Florian Niederlechner scored for the hosts. Hertha are just a point above the relegation zone.</p>
      <p>Left-back Max opened the scoring for the Bavarians in the 18th minute with a free-kick but the turning point came 10 minutes later.</p>
      <p>Jarstein earned a red card with a studs-up challenge on Niederlechner. Cordova claimed the home side's second in the process.</p>
      <p>Substitute Hahn added a third in the 52nd minute with a superb curling strike from the edge of the box. Niederlechner bagged his side's fourth in the 79th minute.</p>
      <p>"The disappointment is understandably big, we have to digest that first," said Hertha captain Niklas Stark.</p>
      <p>"There were so many things we did which you just can't do while playing away in the Bundesliga.</p>
      <p>"We simply have to do better."</p>
      <p>Earlier on Sunday, Borussia Dortmund's squad were booed and jeered when they appeared at the side's annual general meeting, with fans screaming "shame on you".</p>
      <p>Coach Lucien Favre is under pressure as Dortmund, expected to challenge for the title after an ambitious close-season recruitment drive, languish in sixth after a draw to lowly Paderborn on Friday.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, managerless Bayern Munich closed the gap at the top of the table to just a point with a 4-0 romp at Fortuna Duesseldorf as leaders Borussia Moenchengladbach suffered a shock 2-0 loss at Union Berlin.</p>
