      <p>South African stores and consumers have embraced Black Friday, a US shopping event, and made it the biggest online shopping day in the country.</p>
      <p>Instead of waiting for Black Friday to arrive, many South African retailers have decided to spread their sales over multiple days.</p>
      <p>These deals include great price cuts on a wide selection of technology products from various stores.</p>
      <h3>Takealot</h3>
      <p>Takealot’s 2019 Blue Dot Sale is set to take place from 29 November to 3 December, but the online retailer has already unveiled its first deals as part of its Early Access Sale.</p>
      <p>In the build-up to its Blue Dot Sale, Takealot is holding an Early Access Sale which will run from 24-28 November.</p>
      <p>These Early Access deals include discounts on a variety of tech products and appliances, with big discounts that will not be beaten later during the Blue Dot sale.</p>
      <p>Takealot’s Blue Dot Sale is the biggest Black Friday sale in South Africa, and shoppers can expect to save up to 60% on technology products, TVs, appliances, toys, and gaming products.</p>
      <p>During the Blue Dot Sale, new deals will also be added daily and will cover the Black Friday weekend, Cyber Monday, and Takealot Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Many other stores, including Pick n Pay, Esquire, The Gadget Shop, and the Huawei Store, are offering great discounts on tech products as part of their early Black Friday sale periods.</p>
      <p>Here are the best early Black Friday specials on technology products from South African retailers.</p>
