      <h1>Cosby vows to show no ‘remorse’ for sexual assault convict</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/staff/bailey-vogt/" target="_blank">Bailey Vogt</a></address>
      <p>Bill Cosby said Sunday he expects to serve his full 10-year maximum sentence as he plans to show no remorse for his sexual assault conviction.</p>
      <p>Cosby, who was handed down a three- to 10-year sentence last year after being convicted, <a href="https://blackpressusa.com/nnpa-newswire-exclusive-bill-cosby-speaks-from-prison/">told</a> BlackPressUSA over the phone that the Pennsylvania parole board will not “hear me say that I have remorse,” and it will likely prevent him from being released early.</p>
      <p>“I don’t care what group of people come along and talk about this when they weren’t there. They don’t know,” he said.</p>
      <p>“It’s all a setup. That whole jury thing. They were imposters,” he added, claiming one of the jurors was overheard saying before the trial, “He’s guilty, we can all go home now.”</p>
      <p>Cosby — a comedian best-known for his 1980s sitcom “The Cosby Show” — was convicted of sexually assaulting a Temple University employee in 2004.</p>
