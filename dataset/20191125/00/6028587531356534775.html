      <p>When I speak at conferences and workshops, I meet countless people hoping to invest in real estate. They recognize the amazing opportunities and benefits that make real estate more attractive than traditional stock investments. These advantages include leverage, tax-saving incentives, multiple exit strategies, better control over the investment’s value, and the potential for greater financial security. While these people are all apt to discuss theory with me, only 5% of the crowd will typically take action to invest.After many years of watching this behavior, I found that in order to encourage new investors to take action, I need to draw out a roadmap for them to follow easily. I followed six guidelines when I first started investing in real estate and I follow the same guidelines when I coach my clients through the real estate investing journey. Let’s flesh out these six steps so you can start to create your roadmap:</p>
      <p><b>1. Identify Your Main Investment Objective first:</b> </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Are you looking for cash flow to supplement your income?</li>
        <li>Are you looking to build portfolio and equity for long term? </li>
        <li>Do you need quick cash? </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>2. Gather Available Cash Options:</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>You should determine how much cash you are able to gather first, then you can determine other financing options (step 3) to bridge the difference. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>3. Financing Options: </b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Conventional financing: </b>best loan rate offered by larger banks but they typically have the strictest guidelines. </li>
        <li><b>A mortgage broker: </b>they can help you sort through hundreds of lenders with more flexible terms. </li>
        <li><b>Hard money lenders: </b>many people shy away from them because of the hefty loan fees with 1-3% origination point and 7-12% interest rate options. Hard money lenders typically lend 65-70% of the purchase price or in some cases, of the after repaired value. They are interest-only payments with 6-24 months loan term, and they can fund your deal in less than 14 days. As long as you are still making a profit, this option is the easiest way to get your foot into the real estate investing world and not missing the opportunity. </li>
        <li><b>Credit cards</b><b>:</b> One of the methods I have used which can be risky for an undisciplined person. I called all of my credit card companies and requested a credit line increase. I spread my balance through numerous cards to ensure the balances were under 40% of the credit limit (to maintain my good credit score). Credit card companies sometimes send out credit card checks with an introductory rate for 12-15 months, and 2 points transaction fee. I have used one of those credit card checks and used it as a bridge loan for one of my purchases. It’s a much cheaper option than a hard money lender. But I had to make sure I had several good exit plans to pay it back in full within the introductory time period.</li>
        <li><b>Private funds</b><b>:</b> Lastly, family members and friends who may have some savings or retirement funds that need to earn a better return. You will need to prepare an investment presentation to earn their trust to invest in you. That leads to the following steps. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>4. Market Research</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Where should I invest? This is one of the most common questions I get and many people get stuck here. There is no one-size-fits-all answer, therefore you must conduct market research to identify areas with strong potential. There may be areas within a reasonable commute time from a MSA that are considered emerging markets and on the upswing of the real estate cycle. You should also study your city’s general planning to see if there is any revitalization programs in the works in certain neighborhood pockets. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>5. Exit Strategies</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Having several exit strategies is important especially if you plan to ask for private funds or hard money lending to reassure your investors that you do not take their investment lightly. Will you be: Buy, rehab and flip? Or <b>B</b>uy, <b>R</b>ehab, <b>R</b>ent and then <b>R</b>efinance it out into cheaper conventional loan or do a cash-out (BRRR strategy). If you can’t flip for a profit, can you do seller financing? Or renting it out without going into negative cash flow? </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>6. Build your Team</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Finally, to close the loose ends, you need trusted team on the ground. It may take a while to get the perfect team, but it is worthwhile. A team includes a local realtor, local lender, local property manager, insurance agent and contractors. I always find professionals with extra designations carry a much higher standard of care. If you focus on finding the cheapest professional, you will fall hard on this. Take your time to find the right professional rather than the cheapest one. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>No matter what you want to do in real estate, it is crucial that you speak to trusted experts along the way. To schedule a 30-minute real estate coaching call with me, reach out at: www.Calendly.com/HAYLEN</p>
