        <b>MINISTER of Local Government and Community Development Desmond McKenzie has issued a call for volunteers from western parishes to participate in the Seventh Regional Platform on Disaster Risk Reduction in the Americas and the Caribbean (RP20).</b>
      </p>
      <p>The three-day conference will be held from July 8 to 10 at Montego Bay Convention Centre in St James.</p>
      <p>Addressing a sensitisation session at Montego Bay Cultural Centre last Thursday, McKenzie noted that the support of volunteers is important for the successful staging of the event.</p>
      <p>Minister McKenzie said that individuals chosen are expected to “represent the country well. You will have to be a face that is seen, a face that is respected”.</p>
      <p>Volunteers are needed in areas such as accommodation, airport arrivals and departures, administration, among others, and persons are required to sign up by December.</p>
      <p>Volunteers will be drawn from the Social Development Commission (SDC) and existing school volunteer programmes.</p>
      <p>Individuals chosen will be screened and then trained during workshops, which are scheduled to begin in February of next year.</p>
      <p>“We are looking for persons, who can speak a little Spanish, a little French, a little Afrikaans and most importantly, a lot of English because we do not want a situation where we find that our volunteers are not in sync with the programme,” the minister said.</p>
      <p>He noted that persons must also be knowledgeable about the island, as well as disaster management.</p>
      <p>Those selected will be paid a stipend and provided with transportation. They will be given shirts in the Jamaican colours, which should be worn with black pants or skirt.</p>
      <p>Volunteers will be required to be at the conference venue a day before the start of the event for a briefing.</p>
      <p>Last Thursday's sensitisation session gave people the opportunity to sign up with the SDC to be volunteers.</p>
      <p>The Regional Platform, which will review progress made on disaster risk reduction in Latin America and the Caribbean, is being jointly organised by the Government of Jamaica, the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction and the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency.</p>
