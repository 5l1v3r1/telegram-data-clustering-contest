      <p>Tony Blair has branded the Tory plan to deliver Brexit a “fantasy” and said he would not trust Boris Johnson with a blank cheque.</p>
      <p>The former prime minister will deliver a speech on Monday and is expected to describe the state of British politics as “utterly dysfunctional”.</p>
      <p>Mr Blair, speaking at a Reuters Newsmaker event, will say that voters should look at this election seat by seat, describing the General Election as “650 mini elections”.</p>
      <p>Sorry, this content isn't available on your device.</p>
      <p>He is expected to say: “The Conservative Party say vote Tory and Brexit will be done; it will be over.</p>
      <p>“They even add – do it and we can get back to dealing with the important issues.</p>
      <p>“The cheek is quite breath-taking. So, having visited this debacle upon us, which has distracted us from those big issues for over three years, they now use the distraction as a reason for doing Brexit, not abandoning it.</p>
      <p>“But it appeals. It is, however, a fantasy. Brexit isn’t over on 12 December, nor even on 31 January next year. We immediately begin the new phase of Brexit negotiation.”</p>
      <p>He is expected to add: “The Conservatives calculate that they can force people to elect them, despite worry over Brexit, because Jeremy Corbyn is the alternative.</p>
      <p>“The Labour Party leadership calculate they can combine traditional Labour support around issues like the NHS, with Remain voters who hate Brexit, despite fear about the Labour Leader.</p>
      <p>“In other words, both parties want to win on the basis that whatever your dislike of what they’re offering, the alternative is worse.”</p>
      <p>Mr Blair will say: “Yet though Brexit is a distraction, it is also the vital determinant of the nation’s future.</p>
      <p>“It remains the single most important decision since 1945. Because of its effect on the economy, it impacts every one of the non-Brexit promises the parties are making.</p>
      <p>“Doing it matters. How it is done matters. And exhaustion is not the frame of mind in which to do it.</p>
      <p>“No-deal Brexit is not off the table. It is slap bang in the middle of it.</p>
      <p>“When people hear the phrase no deal, they often think we just mean failure to agree; which in Brexiteer language means we haven’t surrendered.</p>
      <p>“What it really means is throwing our economy off a cliff and hoping it finds a parachute on the way down.</p>
      <p>“It is a risk no responsible leader would take. Yet we may be about to empower a leader – Boris Johnson – to take such a risk.”</p>
      <p>On Labour, he will say: “The Labour Party manifesto is heralded by its leadership as the most radical ever.</p>
      <p>“This is true. It promises a revolution; and if implemented it would indeed amount to one…The problem with revolutions is never how they begin but how they end.”</p>
      <p>Mr Blair is expected to say: “The polls predict a Conservative victory and put the chances of an outright Labour victory as negligible. But I wouldn’t trust Boris Johnson with a blank cheque.”</p>
