        <b>One and a half months following adoption of the new Administrative Liability Law, police are unlikely to punish perpetrators due to multiple unfinished tasks, as reported by LTV programme <i>De Facto</i>.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The programme reports the changes will affect the penalty application system and the penalties. However, ministries have not completed multiple important tasks to ensure compliance with the law.</p>
      <p>The majority of administrative violations are composed of road traffic rule violations.</p>
      <h3>LTV journalists expect the beginning of the year to be complicated – current predictions state composition of penalty reports may take upwards of an hour if, of course, police manage this far.</h3>
      <p>State Police Transport Security Office Chief Normunds Krapsis told the programme there are too many unclear factors about the law. This means police will not be able to apply penalties for certain violations committed on 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> January.</p>
      <p>The Administrative Liability Law adopted by the Saeima in October 2018 replaces the Soviet Era’s Code of Administrative Violations, which has been improved since then and was in use ever since Latvia had restored its independence, the programme reminds.</p>
      <p>While until now all penalties were recorded in the Code of Administrative Violations, from now on all separate violations will be listed in laws that govern each separate industry. For example, penalties for drivers will be listed in the Road Traffic Law. Although penalties are applied for such violations the most often, no relevant amendments have been approved so far. Similarly to penalties in several dozen laws awaiting their turn in the Saeima, there are 30 laws in which penalties are supposed to appear have not yet made it to the parliament, explains De Facto. One-third of them are stuck in the Environment Protection and Regional Development Ministry.</p>
      <p>One and a half months prior to changes the electronic platform remains unfinished and untested – the Administrative Violations Process Support System or APAS, which is supposed to govern administrative violations. Interior Affairs Ministry responsible for it told journalists that it is not possible to finish and test the more than two million euros worth system cannot be finished until relevant laws have been adopted.</p>
      <h3>The ministry invited the government and Saeima to postpone the adoption of the law by another half-year or year.</h3>
      <p>Interior Affairs Minister Sandis Ģirģens stresses the need to prepare for changes appropriately – approve regulations in time so that it is possible to finish APAS, train police officers and only once everything has been done commence execution of the law.</p>
      <p>Justice Ministry, which proposed the Administrative Liability Law, believes those are excuses and there are no reasons to postpone anything. According to him – a partially functional IT system cannot serve as a reason for postponing the law.</p>
      <p>Justice Ministry’s deputy state secretary Laila Medina believes before postponing the term it is possible to decide on changes in Saeima’s Legal Affairs Committee. However, the committee’s head Juta Strīķe does not believe there are no reasons for that.</p>
      <p>«This is nonsense because, as I’ve said – it was outlined in the code drivers should be penalized for exceeding driving speed. Now it will be written in another law, not the code. Howe can chaos appear and what could change from moving regulations from one law to another in a comprehensive way? This is nonsense,» says Strīķe.</p>
