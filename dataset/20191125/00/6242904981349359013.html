        <b>Belgium U-19 coach Jacky Mathijssen is confident the team can qualify and win the European championship with Ghanaian born forward Jeremy Doku.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 17-year old Anderlecht youngster has been consistent with the senior side this season, and remains an integral part of the Belgium U-19 team.</p>
      <p>With the team on the verge of qualification, Jacky Mathijssen believes the talented winger can make the difference for his side.</p>
      <p>"With 9 out of 9, a point total that probably won't reach many countries, you end up in pot 1 in the draw for the elite round," explains Mathijssen at  <i>Sporza. </i> </p>
      <p>"There are only 7 free places for the European Championship. So you have to pass a lot of countries before you get there and that's why it is so important to be able to avoid the countries in pot 1."</p>
      <p>"Age-oriented is allowed. If the clubs and the national coach agree, then we have a team that has the chance to become European champions," added Mathijssen. </p>
      <p>"Whether there is consultation with, for example, Roberto Martinez? We first have to get there with this group and then we can talk."</p>
