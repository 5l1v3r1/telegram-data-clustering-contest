      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:25:21+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 00:25</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fool.com.au/author/kennethhallau/" target="_blank">Kenneth Hall</a></address>
      <p>The <b>Avita Medical Ltd </b><a href="https://www.fool.com.au/tickers/ASX-AVH/">(ASX: AVH)</a> share price has shot 3.93% higher in early trade after announcing a new collaboration with the <b>University of Colorado</b>.</p>
      <h3>Why is the Avita Medical share price climbing higher?</h3>
      <p>This morning, Avita announced that it will collaborate with scientists at the Gates Center for Regenerative Medicine at the University of Colorado.</p>
      <p>The preclinical research collaboration will work to establish proof of concept and explore further development of a spray-on treatment. The treatment is targeted at genetically modified cells for patients with epidermolysis bullosa (EB).</p>
      <p>EB is a group of rare and incurable skin disorders caused by genetic mutation, which can result in skin fragility and blistering.</p>
      <p>The Aussie medical company also hopes to find applicability for other genetic skin disorders.</p>
      <p>The partnership will pair Avita Medical’s patented and proprietary Spray-On Skin Cells expertise with the Gates Center’s own technology. Avita will retain the option to exclusively license technologies emerging from the partnership.</p>
      <p>Director of the Gates Center for Regenerative Medicine, Dr. Dennis Roop, was excited by the partnership.</p>
      <p>Dr. Roop said the Spray-On Skin Cells technology combined with the Center’s genetically corrected cells “has the potential to be game changing in the treatment of this disease”.</p>
      <p>At the time of writing, the Avita share price is up nearly 4% to $0.58 per share.</p>
      <h3>How has Avita performed in 2019?</h3>
      <p>It’s been a busy 2019 for the Aussie medical group, with the Avita Medical share price rocketing higher across the year.</p>
