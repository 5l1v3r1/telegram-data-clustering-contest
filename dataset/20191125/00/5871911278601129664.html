      <h1>Yannick Ngakoue caught flipping off Titans during game</h1>

      <p>Jaguars defensive end Yannick Ngakoue was none too pleased with the Titans during Sunday’s game, and he made sure to let them know about it.</p>
      <p>It’s unclear exactly what or with whom Ngakoue was upset with, but whatever the reason, someone on the Titans sideline isn’t going to be added to his friends list on social media networks.</p>
      <p>Ngakoue turned right toward the Titans sideline at the end of one particular play, and maybe he didn’t like the words he was hearing, so he casually flipped them off, for the entire world to see.</p>
