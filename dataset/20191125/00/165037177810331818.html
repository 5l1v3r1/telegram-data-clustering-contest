      <h1>Getafe want Aleñá on loan</h1>

        <b>Carles Aleñá's lack of minutes at Barcelona could lead him to go out on loan. Getafe have always shown an interest in signing him and could do so in the January window.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Carles Aleñá has hardly played a Barcelona match this season</b>. He started on matchday 1 of the league but didn't play the 2nd half at the San Mamés.</p>
      <p>He didn't play again for Barcelona until the<b> November international break</b> when he started again in the friendly match against<b> Cartagena</b>.</p>
      <p>With this <b>scarce participation</b>, it is understandable that the young youth academy graduate is looking for alternatives. And one could be going on loan to Getafe in January.</p>

      <p>That is what 'El Partidazo de COPE' say. Getafe have had an eye on him for a few days, but the interest now seems more alive than ever.</p>
      <p>According to the aforementioned source, this option would please <b>Aleñá</b>, which added to the fact that <b>Valverde</b> doesn't seem to want him, seems to completely smooth out <b>his winter move to Getafe</b>.</p>
