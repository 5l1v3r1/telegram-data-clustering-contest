      <p>Ashburton Museum has been keeping a secret since the beginning of the year - but now it is out.</p>
      <p>The museum will host a touring Topp Twins exhibition from the end of the month, the only South Island venue to do so.</p>
      <p>Called The Topp Twins: An Exhibition For New Zealand, the exhibition has been developed by the team at Te Manawa Museum in Palmerston North, and offers an insight and opportunity to celebrate the contribution the inspiring sisters have made to the country's social, cultural and political landscapes.</p>
      <p>The singing and comedy duo are well known for their country music influenced style, live shows and television performances.</p>
      <p>Topp Twins personas include Ken and Ken, Camp Leader and Camp Mother, and Prue and Dilly.</p>
      <p>"We're so pleased to be bringing this exhibition to Ashburton, especially with Lynda Topp living nearby in Methven and both twins being such well-loved national identities,'' said Ashburton Museum director Tanya Robinson.</p>
      <p>Ms Robinson said the museum had shown a keen interest in hosting the touring exhibition more than 18 months ago and had received hosting confirmation at the beginning of this year.</p>
      <p>Staff were currently busy unpacking crates full of videos, images, costumes and other items.</p>
      <p>The exhibition opens on November 30 and runs over the summer period, closing on February 9.</p>
      <p>The Topp Twins are also the headline act at this year's Mitre 10 Mega Christmas in the Park on December 7.</p>
