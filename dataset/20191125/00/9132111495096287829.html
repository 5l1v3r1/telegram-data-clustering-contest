      <p>A communicator of the ruling New Patriotic Party (NPP), Awal Mohammed, has been named among more than 22,000 people who benefited from the Student Loan Trust Fund between 2009 and 2016 but are refusing to pay after many years, MyNewsGH.com has been hinted.</p>
      <p>Whereas many of the former students claim they are unable to pay back the loan because they are unemployed, Awal Mohammed has been employed for the past couple of years at the Youth Employment Agency and is also a government communicator with perks.</p>
      <p>The loud-mouthed NPP activist who was previously with the NDC was captured as having pursued a Bachelor of Arts in Education at the University of Education Winneba bearing student ID number 5100180166.</p>
      <p>The Board and Management of Student Loan Trust Fund (SLTF) took the decision to release the full list of defaulters of the Government of Ghana Student Loan Trust Fund scheme before going to court to retrieve the money, MyNewsGh.com was told last week.</p>
      <p>The list which captures defaulters as far back as 2010 features loan defaulters from the University for Development Studies, University of Ghana, University of Cape Coast, the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology; Ho, Bolga, Tamale, Sunyani, Koforidua, Kumasi Takoradi Polytechnics; among many others.</p>
      <p>MyNewsGH.com is reliably informed the list has more than 20,000 former students on it and their names and pictures will be published one after the other in the Daily Graphic.</p>
      <p>The first batch of defaulters were published on a full page of Graphic (page 36) on Thursday 21st November 2019.</p>
      <p>The management of the Scheme is cautioning defaulters, including the loud Awal Mohammed, to pay up all overdue balance or risk legal action after the publication and disgrace.</p>
