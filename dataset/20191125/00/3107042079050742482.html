      <p>Batting will be Canterbury Country's major focus ahead of their first Hawke Cup game next month after a tough two games against Otago A at Rangiora's Main Power Oval.</p>
      <p>Otago A got the better of Canterbury Country across the two matches, winning the 50-over encounter on Friday by four wickets and controlling the drawn two-day fixture on Saturday and Sunday.</p>
      <p>Canterbury Country will start their Hawke Cup campaign against Buller in Westport on December 8 and 9.</p>
      <p>They scored 216/7 in their 50 overs thanks to 60 from Harry Chamberlain and 56 from Ben Hartland.</p>
      <p>The pair combined for a 116-run third wicket partnership.</p>
      <p>Canterbury Country were unable to make the most of the platform as they only managed 60 runs from the final 17 overs as Otago A kept chipping away with regular wickets which stalled the run rate.</p>
      <p>Otago A openers Camden Hawkins (62) and Brad Kneebone (80) shared in a 143-run opening stand.</p>
      <p>Canterbury Country fought back to make the run chase a tense one, thanks in part to four wickets from quick bowler Arafat Bhuiyan. But Otago A reached the target with three wickets and 13 deliveries to spare.</p>
      <p>Canterbury Country's batsmen struggled to occupy the crease in the two-day fixture.</p>
      <p>Otago A amassed 274 all out batting first, with Hawkins adding 51 and wicket-keeper Max Chu adding 84 at No 6.</p>
      <p>Bhuiyan, Jed Roberts and Tim Gruijters each took three wickets for the hosts.</p>
      <p>Canterbury Country replied with 172 all out.</p>
      <p>Hartland (32), Chamberlain (30) and Will Hamilton (33) all got starts but none were able to make a big score.</p>
      <p>Following on, Canterbury Country were 71/3 when the match was called a draw.</p>
