      <p>It’s a telling comment on the state of lawlessness in Bengaluru. The traffic police has started deploying mannequins in their own livery so that motorists follow traffic rules for fear of being fined. <br/><br/>The initiative has been taken on the orders of the city Commissioner Bhaskar Rao and Joint Commissioner of Police (Traffic) BR Ravikanthe Gowda less than a week ago. Currently, a few police stations have been provided with these mannequins on trial basis and are also being deployed on the roads in areas like Hulimavu and Kengeri. Soon, around four to five mannequins will be provided to each traffic police station, to be deployed at busy junctions and crossings during the day. <br/><br/>The Kengeri Traffic Police Inspector Shivaswamy said, “Each traffic police station will have these mannequins, to be deployed during the day time, at busy junctions and crossings. These mannequins will hopefully help instil a fear of the presence of authorities even when the traffic police is not on the spot. This is being done on a trial basis. The instructions were issued a week ago and currently, we are testing them. More mannequins will be procured soon. These mannequins will not replace the traffic police on duty but will be present along with the cops.” <br/><br/>Experts say that the presence of a uniformed personnel makes people adhere to rules and be more disciplined and hence the trick might work to bring in traffic discipline in the city. As most vehicle drivers on the road only notice the uniforms and not the faces, the trick is expected to work well and be a success. Since the traffic police runs short-staffed, mannequins will be filling in for the empty posts. <br/><br/>The mannequins will be removed from the spots after sunset, informed the traffic police and will be used only during day time. <br/><br/>The mannequins have been provided with complete uniforms of the traffic police men so that they look life-like including the fluorescent orange jackets that the traffic police wear while on duty, a white-coloured traffic police hat, black shoes, socks and gloves.</p>
