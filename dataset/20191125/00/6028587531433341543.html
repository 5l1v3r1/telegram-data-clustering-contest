      <p>Buckingham Palace announced on Sunday evening that Prince Andrew is officially "standing back" from all 230 of his patronages, although the spinmeister courtiers state that hope is held that the retreat will, in time, prove temporary. Given the moment, in this usage the connotations of the adverb <i>temporary</i> seem to imply a hazy point of possible rehabilitation beyond multiple horizons. However that works out, or doesn't, the level of seriousness with which the Palace is treating the renewed scrutiny of Andrew can be easily measured. Significantly, this morning in London, Charles returns from his Pacific duties for the Crown and is reportedly going to dive in, head-to-head, with his brother for what amounts to the first real crisis talks between the brothers. The Palace and its prince are stymied because the avalanche of public scrutiny set off by the BBC interview is not spent. The tidying of Andrew's name from the rolls of the 230 patronages has been done at great velocity for several reasons, not least because it's understood by the charities and patronages, by the Palace, which is "handling" Andrew, and by the public at large that the BBC is on the verge of letting the other shoe drop in the form of an interview with Andrew's chief accuser, Virginia Roberts Giuffre on December 2.</p>
      <p>That Ms. Giuffre was groomed, trafficked, and abused by Jeffrey Epstein and his associates is not at this point under debate. The FBI has the original print of the photograph of Ms. Giuffre and Andrew, with Andrew's arm apparently around her waist and a smiling Ghislaine Maxwell in the background, taken at Ms. Maxwell's London mews house. It is a macabre photograph. Andrew's position is that it isn't real. Presumably the FBI will be able to determine whether Andrew's claim that the photograph is a fake will bear up under advanced technological scrutiny.</p>
      <p>But the debate around the photograph is not the point. The point is that the BBC is giving Ms. Giuffre a full shot at airing her quite detailed, opposing narrative to that of Prince Andrew, and it's happening in one very short week.</p>
      <p>Last week, the University of Huddersfield, which had kept him on as Chancellor, bent to the will of its student body, which had engaged in a mass protest after the broadcast of Andrew's BBC interview, and stated that the Duke of York will be dropped as Chancellor. From London's Metropolitan University to the Foundation for Liver Research and massive numbers of youth and children's charities – all the patronages are scrambling. None of this is unexpected. All of it is damaging.</p>
      <p>The immediate problem for Andrew – the one he somehow "thought" he would correct with the BBC interview – is actually a two-pronged narrative, both of which will continue to require some form of address from him. One narrative is that of a long-standing relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, involving multiple trips to venues owned by Epstein, be they his Manhattan mansion or his private island. The second, interior narrative of that Epstein netherworld is that of Virginia Roberts Giuffre. Prince Andrew is a leading character in both narratives.</p>
      <p>Andrew met Epstein through his friend and glittering London socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, favored daughter of the highly theatrical newspaper tycoon Robert Maxwell, who died aboard his yacht, the <i>Lady Ghislaine</i>, as he was being declared bankrupt. Ms. Maxwell, a former Epstein flame who is accused of procuring young victims for Epstein, introduced them. The two men got on well. Andrew frequented the New York mansion – a 21,000 square-foot former private school – and the private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands.</p>
      <p>It's a fame-playbook axiom that celebrity wattage attracts more wattage, so that a fair measure may be taken of Prince Andrew's transatlantic drawing power from the odd, stellar, tossed-together guest list that über-PR-rep Peggy Siegal pulled to the dining table at the behest of the then-recently-released Jeffrey Epstein for Prince Andrew on the evening of December 2, 2010. This date and the few days around it at the Epstein mansion have come under minute scrutiny, especially in the UK, because they are when Prince Andrew visited Epstein, during which stay the prince was photographed both inside Jeffrey Epstein's house and on the fateful 'walk in Central Park' with the convicted sex offender.</p>
      <p>Andrew's point about these days – to the BBC at least – is that he visited Epstein to sever ties, which he states that he did on the walk in Central Park. But first, there was the glamorous dinner to get through in honor of the prince's arrival. To date, Andrew has not been entirely clear about whether he knew the dinner was in his honor.</p>
      <p>The guest list was a rare cocktail of names from different walks of life: Woody Allen and Soon-Yi Previn, former Clinton White House staffer and political pundit George Stephanopolous, CBS anchor and correspondent Katie Couric, CBS and PBS interviewer Charlie Rose, and, to spice up the table chatter a bit, comedian Chelsea Handler. With the exception of Ms. Handler, who is younger than all of the above guests and who apparently was not familiar with Epstein, the names would have been drawn from Epstein's deep address book. But all of them, including Ms. Handler, would have been known by Ms. Siegal.</p>
      <p>For his part, Prince Andrew attempted to demur on air in his BBC interview that he was the evening's honoree on December 2, 2010, though the signs point in a different direction. Ms. Handler offered a New York outlet the anecdote that, upon receiving the invite, she was asked whether she would like to have dinner with Prince Andrew.</p>
      <p>Given what has transpired with some of the attendants of the dinner party in the nine years since it was held, we can also look at the evening as a point in time at which many sticks bore spinning plates that were yet to fall. Prince Andrew was still the globe-trotting, not-yet-disgraced trade envoy of the UK with a mandate as big as the world. A year later he would be asked to step down from that post, in part, forebodingly, precisely because photographs of this New York visit with Epstein would surface, and the debate about his suitability as trade envoy would be begin to be bandied about in high political circles in the UK. Looked at this way, we can fairly say that the visit, including the dinner, was the beginning of the present moment for Andrew.</p>
      <p>Broadcaster Katie Couric, one of the highest-paid women in television, was at the time of the dinner in the teeth of some of her best work for CBS. Woody Allen was in the long fallow period before the resurgence of Dylan Farrow's accusations of molestation against her father resurfaced in 2018. PBS and CBS broadcast stalwart Charlie Rose was a ubiquitous presence on issues-oriented television and still a few years away from his own career-ending raft of charges by 35 women that he had engaged in unwanted sexual advances. But at the moment of the party, all guests present were still at the peak of their powers.</p>
      <p>Illustrious though they might have been, and in some cases still are, the Americans at the table that night were clearly not troubled by Epstein's recent release from his 13-month stint in Florida. According to his account, Andrew was very worried about that, and if that is true, he clearly kept it to himself for the evening. If every encounter is a transaction, the notables at table that evening, especially those in journalism – namely, Stephanopolous, Couric, and Rose – would have been in zero doubt about what sort of imprimatur their presence would lending Epstein.</p>
      <p>Which is to say, the person at table whom the dinner party most benefited was the host. As we now know, in everything from his opaque financial dealings to his increasingly less opaque social life, Epstein was a complicated man, with many working <i>agendae</i>. By all reports he was certainly intelligent enough to know that, however dismissive he was of his charges and his state time in Florida, upon returning to New York from prison, one very good way to keep operating was to reify and rectify himself with above-board, non-orgiastic parties, preferably studded with the bigger imprimatur-lending sorts of names from his heavier-hitting, above-board friends from the past. These were heavy hitters, called in for a favor, to lend something they were all very schooled in lending publicly, namely, their presence.</p>
      <p>On the evening of December 2, 2010, then, one very clear agenda was that the dinner party for Andrew was as much about him, Epstein, and his re-entry to New York as it was about anything else. Epstein knew that he would need affirmation for what he was clearly, according to the photographs of the ladies entering and leaving his mansion over the course of that weekend, continuing to do. Unfortunately for him, Prince Andrew served that agenda excellently as the bait for the American celebrities who were at the front of the parade to lend that credibility to him.</p>
      <p>Given what we know of their own rough-and-tumble histories on the field of play, we can surmise that Woody Allen's and Charlie Rose's presence on the evening would not result in an enormous amount of self-examination from either of them. But, to their detriment, we should very much credit both Ms. Couric and Mr. Stephanopolous, who are adroit at reading the slightest tic in their own interview subjects, with the intelligence and with the self-awareness to have understood what lending even an iota of their credibility to Epstein meant. Despite the fact that it has been brushed off as a sweetheart deal, which it was, the nuts and bolts of their dinner host's plea-deal for the Florida charges, and his guilty plea for procuring a minor for the purposes of prostitution, did, actually, have verified content. The victim was a minor. Not to mention the other, known victims in the unprosecuted federal indictment for sex trafficking.</p>
      <p>The one guest who seems to have sensed that something was off is the – for this dinner anyway – relatively unconnected guest Chelsea Handler. On her talk show, and pretty much everywhere else, Ms. Handler is known for her unvarnished ability to cut to the chase. She said of the evening that it was "just one of those strange nights in New York."</p>
      <p>Quite true. And it remains an evening that the Duke of York will still be having to explain.</p>
      <p>Many things will have to happen for Andrew to be accepted back into the public fold. Not many of those possibly redemptive moves seem that they will be happening quickly. In other words, Buckingham Palace and the duke's former charities and patronages are sealing the hatches and strapping themselves into their seats now, this week, for what is shaping up to be a rocky holiday season for Andrew. Significantly, this morning in London, Charles returns from his Pacific duties for the Crown and is reportedly going to dive in, head-to-head, with his brother.</p>
