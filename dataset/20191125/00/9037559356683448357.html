      <p>MUZAFFARGARH: A young woman who died last week after drinking acid survived a rape attempt and was threatened with revenge porn, her father told police as they registered a first information report (FIR) over the incident on Monday.</p>
      <p>The bereaved father noted in the FIR that two of his daughters, including the one who passed away, were blackmailed by unidentified men. The case includes charges of blackmailing and attempted sexual assault.</p>
      <p>He added that the suspects had called both of his daughters to meet them and threatened to share doctored inappropriate images of them on the Internet if they failed to show up. They attempted to rape one of his daughters, after which, feeling hopeless, she tried to commit suicide by consuming acid, he told police.</p>
      <p>The late woman had drank acid on November 13, following which she spent more than a week in agony and, according to police, died on November 21.</p>
