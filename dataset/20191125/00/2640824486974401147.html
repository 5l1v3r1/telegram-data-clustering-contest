      <p><b>france’s leading museum and exhibition operating studio, <a href="https://www.designboom.com/tag/culturespaces/">culturespaces</a> adapted bordeaux’s former WWII submarine base into the largest digital art center in the world — the ‘bassins de lumières’.</b> the immersive exhibition will be open to public starting april 17, 2020 and will operate all year, seven days a week. similar to its prior multimedia exhibition, <a href="https://www.designboom.com/architecture/silhouette-urbaine-latelier-des-lumieres-paris-01-18-2019/">atelier des lumieres</a> in paris, culturespaces will also devote its main exhibition spaces at bassins de lumières to iconic artists in art history, such as gustav klimt and paul klee.</p>

      <p><b>the submarine base’s surface area is three times the size of that of the carrières de lumières in les baux-de-provence, and five times that of the atelier des lumières in paris.</b> the total projection surface area will be 12,000 square meters, requiring up to 90 video projectors and 80 speakers.</p>
      <p><b><i>‘following the creation of the atelier des lumières, we are pleased that we have created this enormous digital art centre for the city of bordeaux,’</i> explains bruno monnier, president of <a href="https://www.culturespaces.com/en/home">culturespaces</a>.</b> <i>‘the bassins de lumières will offer visitors unforgettable visual and audio experiences in a unique setting, a place for sharing culture that is open to all types of visitors.’</i></p>

      <p><b>adapting the architecture of the submarine base to its advantage, the exhibition will consist of four 16-meter deep basins for the main installations along with six other segments.</b> each highlighting different aspects of the project, the six complementary areas include le cube — highlighting artists who specialize in immersive art; le citerne — creating links between museums and original works; les grands nenuphars — projecting exhibition into water; museum space — dedicated to the history of the submarine base; an educational area — information on the featured artists; and mezzanine floor — stage and seating offering different viewing points.</p>
