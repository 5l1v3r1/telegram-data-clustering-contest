        <b>Arsenal continued their winless streak under Unai Emery as they dropped points for the fifth match running. The Gunners only just managed to draw their latest match against relegation-threatened Southampton, prompting the board to take actions. As reports say, two replacements have been lined up. </b>
      </p>
      <p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/arsenal-set-sights-on-mikel-arteta-with-unai-emery-on-brink-cgc60vgsj">The Times</a>, Arsenal board has lost patience with Unai Emery after a string of bad performances. The Gunners are winless in five in the Premier League and are currently eighth in the table, behind Wolves, Sheffield United, and Burnley.</p>
      <p>The report claims that the Arsenal board were determined to stick with Emery until the end of the season initially. However, their position changed after witnessing another dour draw against a relegation-threatened side and was enhanced by fan anger.</p>
      <p>As such, the Gunners have started lining up Emery’s replacements. Two names are on the list currently – Mikel Arteta and Massimiliano Allegri. While the former is currently assistant to Pep Guardiola at Manchester City, the latter is on a sabbatical.</p>
      <p>Arsenal did approach Arteta prior to appointing Emery but were rebuffed in their approach. During this period, the Spaniard’s position at Manchester City has become stronger following back-to-back title wins. Allegri, meanwhile, has also been linked with the Gunners in the past. The ex-Juventus manager is currently without a job, having left the Bianconeri at the end of the previous season.</p>
