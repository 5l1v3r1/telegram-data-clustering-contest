      <p>REHOBOTH BEACH, Del. (AP) - More than 150 people are praying that a Delaware city reverses course on a ban that prohibits the display of a Nativity scene on city property.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/daily-times/">Daily Times</a> of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/salisbury/">Salisbury</a> reports the mostly Catholic protesters gathered Thursday outside City Hall in Rehoboth Beach to ask officials to allow the display. They were joined by the Rev. William Cocco of St. Edmond Catholic Church, who asked city commissioners to let the creche return to its “proper place,” the Rehoboth Bandstand.</p>
      <p>The city ordered church officials to remove the display in December, saying it hadn’t been given permission to install the display in the first place. The city later announced plans to create an all-inclusive display for 2019. It’s unclear what progress, if any, has been made on that display.</p>
