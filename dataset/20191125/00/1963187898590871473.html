      <p>CAIRO â€“ 25 November 2019: A total of 2,500 workers at the Egyptian National Railways Authority were suspended after they tested positive for drug use. <br/><br/>Some of the suspended employees worked at crossings and transfers, while others worked as train drivers and assistants. They were all referred to investigations, and were obliged to enroll in a treatment program, and undertake two tests within six months. <br/><br/>This comes as part of the anti-addiction campaign launched by the authority. Between March 15 and November 23, the campaign examined 23,000 workers out of 33,000 at the authority, and affiliated companies. <br/><br/>Along the same lines, the government regularly launches sudden anti-drug campaigns across the country; one of them was held two weeks ago, where drug tests were carried out on 225 drivers, of whom 34 tested positive to drug use. <br/><br/>A striking figure showed that 27 percent of drug abusers in Egypt are women, while children (aged between 12 to 18 years old) constituted 4.2 percent of the abusers. <br/><br/>Government campaigns extended to detect drug abusers among public employees, where the latest figures show that 279 employees at administrative bodies proved to be addicts.</p>
