      <p><i>By Joshua Muyiwa</i> <br/><br/>Being away from Bengaluru for long stretches over these past few months have allowed me to compare things to my city in a way that I had completely forgotten. It has opened my eyes to the ways that cities have become the same everywhere, losing their own individual character, cache and complexity for the modern twin devils: convenience and commerce. While there are still neighbourhoods in each of these Indian cities that I visited that hold onto something of the way one used to live in them but otherwise one could be anywhere else, it didn’t matter. I understand the appeal of these aesthetic choices and the access it grants different kinds of people – class, caste, creed and community – but it does still manage to reveal these same markers in other ways. And that might be the problem too. In aiming for these world-class standards in our exteriors, we’ve still not found ways to even begin to address them at all. And if the soaring rise of conservative, nationalist politics across the country is anything to go by then it would seem it was so deep-seated all along while we might have set out to reach some idea of the international in the beginning. <br/><br/>It would seem the growing, gory acts of violence meted out in the name of things that don’t always contribute to our humanity tell us otherwise. <br/><br/>I’ll admit to you, I started off this column, hoping to tackle something light like the architecture in our cities. But even thinking through my simplistic problems with the mode of building started cascade, crashed and collate into other thoughts. We have decided that good things belong to a certain class of the deserving, never mind that there are historical problems with who that means. And the rest can simply squeeze into the leftover sad surroundings. (Though, I must admit to the privilege that I even have to whine about these things but I’d like to still find a way to still propose an argument.) I’m not simply suggesting holding onto colonial structures and houses that dot our cities but rather looking at the manpower and materials that came together then might help create other ideas to doing these same things now. Also, it just seems the way we are building now isn’t just detrimental to the environment in terms of the materials used, but also in the modes of construction that require more to actually make them habitable, and some more to make them livable. <br/><br/>In ignoring these other modes of living and relegating them as anti-national, we’ve forgotten the ways that they’ve acknowledged and addressed the weather and natural environment of that place. If we’ve admitted that global warming has changed the weather, it might us serve us better to find ways that don’t further ruin it. We should be turning to materials that are conscious of their effects on the environment, not just at the source of extraction but also in their long-term nature. And functional doesn’t have to mean a loss of frippery or flamboyance – but we need to push our language of vernacular architecture for that and not build these cookie cutter houses for everyone. <br/><br/>There was something majestic about the old neighbourhoods in our Indian cities and even in the government service-persons’ quarters are wonderful examples of the risks that architecture was willing to take without compromise on respect for the surroundings. There are ways of retaining distinction and still be diverse and decent. In these opposing examples, one can glimpse the way that houses can be made for one family to those that need to accommodate many. Forgive me this rant, I’m sitting in Goa and looking around me, I’ve noticed the ways that old structures that were cooler not just by social quotient but also in the weather are being replaced by concrete buildings that are then shoved with air-conditioning to make them bearable. And well, it makes me sad. Perhaps, there are ways of social housing that are particular to places and in respecting these needs that are individual, we might also begin to address the environmental concerns too. But, what do I know? I’m not an architect – I just like pretty but practical things.</p>
