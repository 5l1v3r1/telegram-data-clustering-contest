      <h1>Florida climbs 2 spots to No. 9 in latest AP Top 25 college football poll</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:32:10+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 00:32</time> by <a rel="author">AP</a></address>
      <p>No. 2 Ohio State gained some ground on No. 1 <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/college-football/lsu-tigers-team">LSU</a> in The Associated Press college football poll and Oregon dropped out of the top 10 after being upset by Arizona State.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/college-football/lsu-tigers-team">Tigers</a> remained No. 1 for the fifth straight week in the AP Top 25 presented by Regions Bank, receiving 50 first-places votes. The <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/college-football/ohio-state-buckeyes-team">Buckeyes</a> got nine first-place votes, up from five last week. No. 3 Clemson received three first-place votes. No. 4 Georgia and No. 5 Alabama also held their spots.</p>
      <p>Ohio State is coming off a 28-17 victory over Penn State that dropped the <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/college-football/penn-state-nittany-lions-team">Nittany Lions</a> two spots to No. 11.</p>
      <p>Oregon dropped eight spots to No. 14 after losing 31-28 at Arizona State. That allowed <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/college-football/utah-utes-team">Utah</a> to move up a spot to No. 6 and Oklahoma to No. 7. Florida, <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/college-football/minnesota-golden-gophers-team">Minnesota</a> and <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/college-football/michigan-wolverines-team">Michigan</a> round out the top 10.</p>
      <p>___</p>
      <h3>POLL POINTS</h3>
      <p>Alabama has now been ranked for 209 consecutive weeks, starting with the 2008 preseason poll, tying Florida (Sept. 9, 1990-Oct. 5, 2002) for the third-longest streak in poll history. <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/college-football/nebraska-cornhuskers-team">Nebraska</a> has the longest streak at 348 weeks (21 years, Oct. 12, 1981-Sept. 22, 2002) and Florida State is second with 211 weeks (12 years, Sept. 24, 1989-Nov. 11, 2001).</p>
      <p>The Tide should tie Bobby Bowden’s <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/college-football/florida-state-seminoles-team">Seminoles</a> this season and surpass them in next year’s preseason poll. There are typically 16 polls in a season, counting preseason and final. At that rate, Alabama would pass the record Nebraska set under coach Tom Osborne in Week 5 of the 2029 season.</p>
      <p>FYI, Nick Saban would be about a month shy of his 78th birthday.</p>
      <h3>IN</h3>
      <p>— No. 24 Navy jumped into the rankings, knocking out American Athletic Conference rival <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/college-football/smu-mustangs-team">SMU</a>.</p>
      <p>— No. 25 Southern California finished its regular season by beating rival <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/college-football/ucla-bruins-team">UCLA</a> and jumping back into the rankings. The <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/college-football/troy-trojans-team">Trojans</a> have had two previous one-week stays in the poll this season.</p>
      <h3>OUT</h3>
      <p>— Texas A&amp;M fell out after a brief return to the AP Top 25. The <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/college-football/texas-am-aggies-team">Aggies</a> lost for the fourth time, this time to Georgia. All of A&amp;M’s losses have come against teams ranked in the current top 16. It gets no easier for the Aggies next week. They will face No. 1 LSU and become the first team in the history of the AP poll, which dates to 1936, to face a No. 1 three times in one season. Playing the No. 1 team twice in one season has happened 30 times previously, and that’s including seven teams that played one of those games in the postseason.</p>
      <p>Texas A&amp;M lost to No. 1 Clemson 24-10 in September and to No. 1 Alabama 47-28 in October.</p>
      <h3>CONFERNCE CALL</h3>
      <p>Big Ten — 6 (Nos. 2, 9, 10, 12, 13, 19).</p>
      <p>SEC — 5 (Nos. 1, 4, 5, 8, 16).</p>
      <p>American — 3 (Nos. 17, 18, 24).</p>
      <p>Big 12 — 3 (Nos. 7, 11, 21).</p>
      <p>Pac 12 — 3 (Nos. 6, 14, 25).</p>
      <p>ACC — 2 (Nos. 3, 23).</p>
      <p>Mountain West — 1 (No. 20).</p>
      <p>Sun Belt — 1 (No. 22).</p>
      <p>Independent — 1 (No. 15).</p>
      <h3>RANKED vs. RANKED</h3>
      <p>No. 2 Ohio State at No. 10 Michigan. Is THIS the year Jim Harbaugh finally breaks through against the Buckeyes?</p>
      <p>No. 5 Alabama at No. 16 Auburn. All eyes on Alabama backup quarterback <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/college-football/mac-jones-player-stats">Mac Jones</a> in the Iron Bowl.</p>
      <p>No. 7 Oklahoma at No. 21 Oklahoma State. Bedlam is for bragging rights and the <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/college-football/oklahoma-sooners-team">Sooners</a>’ playoff hopes.</p>
      <p>No. 13 Wisconsin at No. 9 Minnesota. The winner goes to the Big Ten championship game as West Division champion.</p>
      <p>No. 18 Cincinnati at No. 17 Memphis. The Tigers need a victory to clinch the AAC West — and a rematch at home with the <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/college-football/cincinnati-bearcats-team">Bearcats</a> the next week.</p>
