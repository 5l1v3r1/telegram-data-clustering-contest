      <p>WWE once again failed to seize a rare opportunity to create a new star at Survivor Series when Roman Reigns emerged from the men’s 5-on-5 match as the sole survivors for Team SmackDown.For all of the problems WWE has had in 2019–ranging from the <a href="https://www.wrestlinginc.com/news/2019/11/wwe-denies-crown-jewel-flight-issues-had-anything-to-do-661734/">Crown Jewel controversy</a> to a very <a href="https://corporate.wwe.com/investors/news/press-releases/2019/10-31-2019-122937923">disappointing Q3 earnings report–</a>one of the lone bright spots on WWE’s programming was the build-up to Survivor Series, which was centered around a tri-branded battle among Raw, SmackDown and NXT for the first time ever. In previous years, the Raw vs. SmackDown format at Survivor Series had begun to lose its luster, but this year’s infusion of the popular NXT brand breathed new life into the concept, which was at times reflected in the viewership for all three shows.</p>
      <p>Indeed, NXT viewership f<a href="https://www.cagesideseats.com/wwe/2019/11/21/20976687/nxt-beats-aew-ratings-viewership-nov-20-2019-wednesday-night-war-wwe">inally toppled</a> that of its new competitor AEW just this week while <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2860934-wwe-smackdown-on-fox-ratings-up-143-with-brock-lesnar-quitting-nxt-invasion">SmackDown viewership soared</a> when NXT invaded the blue brand. In route to Survivor Series, WWE put a heavy focus on building up new stars, consistently highlighting a plethora of NXT standouts like Adam Cole while also doing a very good job of creating some more intriguing storylines for rising stars like Ricochet and even Bray Wyatt. Even though WWE tends to put much of its focus on stars from the past throughout the year, there was definitely a different feeling in route to Survivor Series, as upstart names–ranging from Shayna Baszler to Drew McIntyre–seemed to become more of a priority among the creative team.</p>
      <p>At Survivor Series, WWE nearly made the popular choice and gave Keith Lee a career-defining victory before Reigns ultimately emerged with the win for the red brand. The more things change, the more they stay the same, right?</p>
      <p>Since WWE’s Draft in early October, there has been a clear focus on WWE’s next generation of talent, especially on Raw where Ricochet, Humberto Carrillo and Andrade are a few of the stars who’ve benefited from the recent roster changes. It’s well known that Raw Executive Director Paul Heyman is a big supporter of many of the red brand’s rising talents, including <a href="https://whatculture.com/wwe/paul-heyman-high-on-aleister-black-buddy-murphy-in-wwe">Aleister Black and Buddy Murphy</a> as well as <a href="https://www.ewrestlingnews.com/news/report-paul-heyman-is-behind-cedric-alexanders-push">Cedric Alexander</a> and <a href="https://www.cagesideseats.com/2019/7/4/20681942/rumor-roundup-wwe-backstage-reaction-heyman-bischoff-hires-triple-h-snub-ricochet-push">Ricochet</a>, and because of that, Raw has assumed SmackDown’s previous title at WWE’s “land of opportunity.” Now, SmackDown is more or less a place for WWE to focus on stars who are already established and more recognizable in the mainstream, with the likes of Daniel Bryan, Roman Reigns, The New Day and Braun Strowman fitting that bill. That’s likely a direct call from FOX, which is more widely available than USA Network, the home of Raw and a place where fans are already familiar with the WWE product.</p>
      <p>So, entering Survivor Series, WWE really found itself with a golden opportunity to utilize the more established names on SmackDown to elevate the less established ones from NXT and Raw. A strong showing from Lee, however, was overshadowed by WWE’s insistence on letting Seth Rollins last until the end of the match–which the crowd <i>hated</i>–and then giving Reigns the big W.</p>
      <p>As Reigns has been rumored for a <a href="https://www.cagesideseats.com/2019/11/21/20975008/rumor-roundup-wrestlemania-plans-wyatt-reigns-asuka-orton-wwe-status">possible WrestleMania world title match</a>, WWE chose not to use Survivor Series as a launching pad for stars who haven’t really gotten a consistent chance to cement themselves among WWE’s greats. That, of course, certainly should be the goal of the traditional 5-on-5 elimination matches, which don’t really feature anything substantial stake other than faux “bragging rights” that will essentially be forgotten about as soon as the pay-per-view goes off the air. Aside from furthering other feuds and angles, the main purpose of these matches is to send a star skyrocketing up the card at a time when WWE desperately needs to create new ones.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, Vince McMahon infamously <a href="https://www.thesportster.com/news/vince-mcmahon-superstar-absences-losses/">blamed WWE’s lackluster Q1 earnings on “superstar absences,”</a> which masked the real problem: The lack of truly marketable and mainstream names among the current generation of stars. That’s not a knock on the stars themselves, either, as WWE has what is arguably the most loaded roster of performers in WWE history. Rather, it’s about the presentation of most of its current stars as inferior to the stars of yesteryear.</p>
      <p>WWE got a golden opportunity to start with a clean slate at Survivor Series, but Reigns got the win instead. Doesn’t that sound familiar.</p>
