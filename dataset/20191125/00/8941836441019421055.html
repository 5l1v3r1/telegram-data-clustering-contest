      <h1>Stewart, McDaniels lead No. 25 Washington over USD 88-69</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">CHRIS TALBOTT</a></address>
      <p>SEATTLE (AP) - <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/isaiah-stewart/">Isaiah Stewart</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jaden-mcdaniels/">Jaden McDaniels</a> are learning the value of patience.</p>
      <p>The big names in No. 25 <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/washington/">Washington</a>’s eye-catching recruiting class finally put it together for most of a game Sunday night, both scoring career highs during the Huskies’ 88-69 win over <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/san-diego/">San Diego</a>.</p>
      <p>Slowly but surely, they’re catching on.</p>
      <p>“We talk about baby steps,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/washington/">Washington</a> coach <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mike-hopkins/">Mike Hopkins</a> said. “We took one tonight. But we’ve still got a long ways to go.”</p>
      <p>The imposing <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/isaiah-stewart/">Stewart</a> had 25 points and seven rebounds, the silky smooth <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jaden-mcdaniels/">McDaniels</a> scored 20 and each took over the game at points to help the Huskies (4-1) win their third straight. The freshmen then teamed up to score the first 10 points of a game-clinching run early in the second half.</p>

      <p>Many of their points came in transition with the players sometimes starting and ending the fastbreak.</p>
      <p>“I feel like we do have to be patient because it’s not the same as high school,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jaden-mcdaniels/">McDaniels</a> said. “We’re not just like the only people on our team. We have to find ways to create for each other and for our other teammates.”</p>
      <p>Marion Humphrey scored 13 and Jared Rodriguez added 12 for the Toreros (2-5), who have lost three straight games including two to Pac-12 opponents.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/isaiah-stewart/">Stewart</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jaden-mcdaniels/">McDaniels</a> started to exert pressure on the much smaller Toreros late in the first half when the Huskies put together a 12-2 run to take a 41-30 halftime lead. After <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/san-diego/">San Diego</a> cut it to 29-28 on Finn Sullivan’s 3-pointer, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/isaiah-stewart/">Stewart</a> scored five straight points to start the run.</p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p>The 6-foot-9 center hit two free throws, then finished a fastbreak with a putback off his own missed dunk, drawing a foul. The three-point play made it 34-28, and he finished off the run with a tip in of a miss by Quade Green.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/isaiah-stewart/">Stewart</a> had 14 points and seven rebounds at the half with <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jaden-mcdaniels/">McDaniels</a> adding 10 as he drove the lane with speed and power.</p>
        <p>They continued to spur the Huskies in the second half, combining to start an 18-3 run with 10 straight points. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/isaiah-stewart/">Stewart</a> started it with a three-point play off a lob pass and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jaden-mcdaniels/">McDaniels</a> added a driving finger-roll and a short jumper after getting the ball back from a teammate following his own missed dunk. He then hit a 3-pointer to make it 53-47 with 15:23 left.</p>
        <p>Hameir Wright hit a 3 and Nahziah Carter finished the run with a 3 and a driving layup to make it 61-40 with 13:22 left. Wright finished with 16 points and Green had 10 assists.</p>
        <p>The Huskies overpowered the Toreros in the paint, outscoring them 46-28 down low and outrebounding them 33-27.</p>
        <p>All those paint points led to a 57 percent shooting percentage (32 of 56) for the Huskies. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jaden-mcdaniels/">McDaniels</a> was especially efficient, hitting 7 of 10 shots and 4 of 5 free throws.</p>
        <p>“He was spectacular,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mike-hopkins/">Hopkins</a> said. “The thing about it was he was really, really efficient today. He scored some points in few shots. I felt like we got him the ball in some better areas. He got a couple of wide open 3s. That’s always nice. He’s such a good defensive player, he’s just scratching the surface. It’s going to be fun working with these guys.”</p>
        <p>VALUE THE BALL</p>
        <p>No surprise, young <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/washington/">Washington</a> has been a bit of a turnover machine. The Huskies rebounded from a 23-turnover effort against Montana on Friday with a season-low 10 against <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/san-diego/">San Diego</a> on Sunday.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mike-hopkins/">Hopkins</a> has put an emphasis on valuing the ball in practice and the message appears to be getting through.</p>
        <p>“We talked with this team about unforced turnovers,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mike-hopkins/">Hopkins</a> said. “Twenty five percent of our turnovers were travels. That’s self-inflicted. Fifteen percent of our turnovers were just (throw aways). Those are things we can control.”</p>
        <p>BIG PICTURE</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/san-diego/">San Diego</a>: It’s that time of year when mid-major teams take their lumps and the Toreros are earning their frequent flyer miles after playing at then-No. 25 Colorado and the now-No. 25 Huskies during an eight-day span. They now return to a more appropriate level of competition.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/washington/">Washington</a>: The Huskies again struggled with a less-talented team early, but showed some of their promise as they fatten up on nonconference opponents before a Dec. 8 showdown with No. 8 Gonzaga. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/isaiah-stewart/">Stewart</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jaden-mcdaniels/">McDaniels</a> looked less like freshman than they have this year.</p>
        <p>UP NEXT</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/san-diego/">San Diego</a>: The Toreros return home Wednesday to host Hofstra in what will be the first game of the Boca Raton Beach Classic (early rounds played offsite).</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/washington/">Washington</a>: The Huskies will take the holiday off before continuing their seven-game nonconference homestand against South Dakota on Dec. 2.</p>
