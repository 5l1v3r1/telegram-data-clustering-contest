      <h1>Eden Hazard Names Liverpool Player That He Is Backing to Win Ballon d'Or</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.90min.com/users/14534390" target="_blank">Robbie Copeland</a></address>
      <p>Real Madrid forward Eden Hazard has said that one of Liverpool trio Sadio Mané, Mohamed Salah or Virgil van Dijk deserve to win this year's Ballon d'Or - but that it's the Senegalese who deserves it most. </p>
      <p>Hazard came up against the Reds with Chelsea on three occasions last season, taking a front-row seat as they hauled in a remarkable 97 points in the Premier League before winning the Champions League.</p>
      <p>The impressive nature of ​Liverpool's 2018/19 season, coupled with their start to this season that has seen them open up an eight-point gap at the top of the Premier League, means that a host of their top stars are in contention for the Ballon d'Or, which will be awarded next week. </p>

      <p>But while <a href="http://90min.com/players/lionel-messi">​Lionel Messi</a> remains the frontrunner to win the award for a record sixth time, Hazard has said that it's a <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/liverpool">​Liverpool</a> player who deserves it this time around - saying that he would 'love' either <a href="https://www.90min.com/players/sadio-mane">​Mané</a> or his good friend <a href="https://www.90min.com/players/mohamed-salah">​Salah</a> to take the award home.</p>
      <p>“I’ll give it to a Liverpool player,” he told <a href="http://www.leparisien.fr/sports/football/psg/real-psg-si-demain-je-peux-faire-venir-mbappe-les-confidences-d-eden-hazard-24-11-2019-8200728.php">Le Parisien</a>. “Mane, Salah or van Dijk deserve it. If Sadio had won the African Cup of Nations with Senegal, there would have been no debate.</p>
      <p>“It would be nice if he had it. Or Momo [Salah], who is a friend of mine. It would be good for African football and for English football.”</p>

      <p>The winner of the 2019 award will be announced on December 2 in Paris, with Van Dijk being touted as the main rival to Messi.</p>
      <p>The Argentine netted 51 goals in 50 games as <a href="http://90min.com/teams/barcelona">​Barcelona</a> stormed to another La Liga title last season, but his side were famously eliminated from the Champions League at the hands of the Reds at the semi-final stage. </p>
