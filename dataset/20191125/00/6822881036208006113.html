      <p>Starting out as a limited-edition card with just 100 test owners, the card uses Fingerprints’ T-shape sensor module and software platform for payments, and will charge itself when used at POS terminals.</p>
      <p>Named the Cornèrcard Biometric Gold, it will feature an integrated LED to indicate successful payment. Users will be required to enter a PIN for the first transaction, and thereafter only if their print has not been recognised.</p>
      <p>Fingerprint data is stored on a secure chip on the card. According to Cornèr Bank and its partners, the data will not be accessible in case of theft or loss.</p>
      <p>“The biometric payment card not only has a special appearance. It also provides a special payment experience and fits perfectly into the day-to-day lives of the modern consumer,” says Cornèrcard director Davide Rigamonti.</p>

      </p>
      <p>According to a March survey from Paymentsense, 29% of consumers and 17% of businesses believe that fingerpring scanning will be the most-used biometric technology of the future, while 36% of consumers said that the new technology would never be used in great amounts.</p>
      <p>“With Cornèrcard’s Visa biometric card, we are marking a turning point in the Swiss payments world,” says Jörg Metzelaers, Switzerland country manager for Visa.</p>
      <p>“Consumers are becoming more comfortable with new forms of biometric authentication and recognize that they make their lives easier.”</p>
