      <h1>Falcons’ loss leaves 2-game win streak looking like old news</h1>

      <p>ATLANTA (AP) - As it turns out, coach Dan Quinn was smart to resist calling his <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/atlanta-falcons/">Atlanta Falcons</a>’ two-game winning streak a turnaround.</p>
      <p>Quinn used a cautionary tone last week when asked about the two straight wins. He said to check back around Christmas - or even <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/thanksgiving/">Thanksgiving</a> - to see if the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/atlanta-falcons/">Falcons</a>’ surge would continue.</p>
      <p>Another smart call.</p>
      <p>Thursday night’s visit from <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-orleans/">New Orleans</a> finds the modest winning streak looking like old news. Sunday’s 35-22 loss to Tampa Bay revealed the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/atlanta-falcons/">Falcons</a>’ old problems haven’t gone away.</p>
      <p>Missed opportunities in the loss to the Buccaneers left the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/atlanta-falcons/">Falcons</a> (3-8) alone in last place in the NFC South.</p>
      <hr/>
      <hr/>
      <p>It may be difficult to move up in the division without such offensive leaders as running back Devonta Freeman and tight end Austin Hooper, who have missed two straight games with foot and knee injuries, respectively. It is not known if either has a chance to return for the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/thanksgiving/">Thanksgiving</a> night visit from <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-orleans/">New Orleans</a>.</p>
      <p>The injury situation at skill positions could get worse, as the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/atlanta-falcons/">Falcons</a> saw against Tampa Bay when Julio Jones briefly left the game with a sore shoulder. Jones returned, but he was obviously still bothered by the injury.</p>
      <p>The half-empty stands at Mercedes-Benz Stadium made the game feel like a preseason matchup. The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/atlanta-falcons/">Falcons</a>’ reliance on backups at skill positions added to the late-August ambience.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/atlanta/">Atlanta</a> again started Brian Hill as Freeman’s fill-in but on Sunday also tried Qadree Ollison. Neither was effective. The two combined to rush for only 34 yards on 17 carries. Ollison had a 1-yard touchdown run.</p>

        <p>Other backups, including wide receiver Christian Blake, saw substantial time. Third-string tight end Jaeden Graham had a 53-yard catch on <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/atlanta/">Atlanta</a>’s opening drive.</p>
        <p>WHAT’S WORKING</p>
        <p>While the offense sputtered in the red zone, Younghoe Koo was a reliable workhorse. Koo, from Seoul, South Korea, was good on field goals of 25, 38 and 40 yards. He has made a combined 10 field goals the last three weeks.</p>
        <p>WHAT’S NEEDS HELP</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/atlanta-falcons/">Falcons</a> are still giving up too many sacks. Matt Ryan was sacked a season-high six times. The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/atlanta-falcons/">Falcons</a> again struggled to generate a pass rush. They had no sacks, making their combined 11 in back-to-back wins over <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-orleans/">New Orleans</a> and Carolina more mind-boggling than ever.</p>
        <p>STOCK UP</p>
        <p>Russell Gage, who has had a more prominent role following last month’s trade of Mohamed Sanu to New England, led <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/atlanta/">Atlanta</a> with eight catches for 76 yards. He is fitting in nicely as a complement to Jones and Calvin Ridley.</p>
        <p>Ryan said Gage has taken advantage of his chance to fill Sanu’s role.</p>
        <p>“When guys like him get their opportunity to play, sometimes playing brings out the best in guys, and when they’re involved in a game the way you can feature them the way you want to use them, it allows for their development to kind of expedite,” Ryan said. “He’s done a great job for us. He’s been consistent. He’s played tough. He’s made people miss.”</p>
        <p>STOCK DOWN</p>
        <p>Hill was held to 14 yards on nine carries after running for 30 yards on 15 carries in his first start at Carolina. He is averaging only 2.8 yards on 52 carries this season.</p>
        <p>INJURED</p>
        <p>Freeman, Hooper and safety Kemal Ishmael (concussion) have missed two straight games. Jones’ status will be watched closely in the short practice week. He missed practice time last week with a sore foot and now has the new shoulder issue.</p>
        <p>KEY NUMBER</p>
        <p>12 - The six sacks are alarming. Ryan also was hit 12 times by Tampa Bay defenders. The ineffective run game only made Ryan an easier target for the Buccaneers’ pass rush.</p>
        <p>NEXT STEPS</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/atlanta-falcons/">Falcons</a> would have to finish the season with five straight wins to salvage a .500 record. No one is predicting such a surge, though a 26-9 win at <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-orleans/">New Orleans</a> on Nov. 10 started the two-game streak. The return visit from the Saints on <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/thanksgiving/">Thanksgiving</a> night gives <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/atlanta/">Atlanta</a> a chance to show the win wasn’t a complete outlier.</p>
