      <p>An Bord Pleanala has given the green light to Intel for a major €3.65bn expansion at its headquarters in Leixlip.<br/>The massive new fabrication (FAB) facility will be involved in the manufacture of integrated circuits.<br/>In 2016, Intel secured planning permission for the first phase of the FAB facility valued at $4bn (€3.65bn).<br/>In total, the two projects represent a $8bn (€7.3bn) investment which will employ 6,000 construction workers at peak and 1,600 full-time jobs on completion.<br/>The project represents the largest single private investment in the history of the State on one project - if given the go-ahead by Intel globally.<br/>Kildare County Council will benefit from development contributions of €9.7m applied to the development.<br/>In welcoming the decision by An Bord Pleanala, Labour Party representative Emmet Stagg said that the proposal is part of a strategic initiative by Intel Leixlip to ensure that the campus is optimised and is in a competitively placed position to compete for the next generation of investment with the Intel Corporation, when major future capital investment decisions are being considered.<br/>Mr Stagg said the proposal was supported by the Current Leixlip Local Area Plan and Kildare County Development Plan and various regional and National Strategies and Guidelines.<br/>To date Intel have invested $12.5 billion at its Leixlip plant between buildings and equipment. <br/>Last Friday the company celebrated 30 years in Ireland and outlined how it contributes €1.08 billion each year to the Irish economy.<br/>It said that in addition to the 4,900 people working directly for Intel, the company said supports 6,700 full time equivalent jobs in the local economy.</p>
