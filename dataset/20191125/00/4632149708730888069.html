      <h1>Domlur trees lose their shackles</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:30:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 00:30</time> by <a rel="author">Reya Mehrotra</a></address>
      <p>On Sunday morning, a group of Bengalureans started off with the first instalment of the ‘Free the Tree’ initiative in Domlur ward along with the Domlur ward corporator CR Lakshminarayan. A few days ago, Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) Commissioner BH Anil Kumar had launched the initiative, a brainchild of The Ugly Indian group and BBMP. Using a battery operated cutter, the metal guards were cut and removed from around the trees in Domlur. To flag the project off, the ward corporator symbolically cut out the metal guard around a tree. <br/><br/>In the first phase of the initiative, trees on a 25-km stretch will be freed of guards. A survey will also be conducted to know the number of the trees here. The 10-km stretch from 100 feet road in Indiranagar to 100 feet road in Koramangala (North to South) and the 15-km stretch from MG Road to Whitefield are being considered for the initiative. <br/><br/><br/>A member of the Ugly Indian team says, “In Bengaluru, trees planted by residents 15-20 years ago have now grown tall and are still in the guards. The guards are important when trees are growing to protect them but when they are tall, the guards start choking them and hampering their growth. They also become garbage bins for people.”</p>
