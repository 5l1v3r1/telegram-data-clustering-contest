        <b>Napoli forward Lorenzo Insigne injured his elbow against AC Milan and will miss Wednesday's Champions League game at Liverpool.</b>

      <p><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/l-insigne-118685/">Lorenzo Insigne</a> <b>will miss Napoli's Champions League trip to</b> <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/liverpool/">Liverpool</a> due to an elbow injury.</p>
      <p>The 28-year-old suffered the problem during Saturday's Serie A game with AC Milan; <b>he was replaced after 65 minutes of the 1-1 draw at San Siro</b>. Insigne has four goals and five assists in all competitions this season but has not been included in Napoli's 20-man squad for the match at Anfield. Fabian Ruiz and Faouzi Ghoulam have been selected, however, <b>despite training separately from their team-mates on Monday</b>.</p>
      <p><b>Carlo Ancelotti's side beat Liverpool 2-0</b> in the opening round of fixtures and can make certain of a place in the last 16 of the Champions League <b>with victory over the Premier League leaders</b> on Wednesday.</p>
