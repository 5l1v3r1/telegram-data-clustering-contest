      <p>The President of the Federation of Disability Organization in Ghana, Mawunyo Yakor-Dagbah has encouraged Ghanaians to vote for persons with disability and women in the upcoming December 17 district elections.</p>
      <p>According to her, a disability of a person should not prevent them from addressing pertinent issues in their work if voted into office.</p>
      <p>In an interview with Citi News, the president intimated that though the number of aspirants with disability is unknown, she is positive that when given the chance, they would address issues of disability at the district level effectively.</p>
      <p>“Persons with disabilities are capable people, but I believe that we will see a number of persons winning except that it might not be representative of the numbers that we will expect but at the end of the day we need women and persons with disabilities at the local governance level, at the decision-making table so that they can also draw attention to our needs and also demonstrate their leadership capacity,” she said.</p>
      <p>“Even though you might not be content, you must come out and vote and support a candidate in your area who you think can address your issues or is listening and is able to help address challenges in your area whether the person is having a disability or not. But then, I appeal to Ghanaians to look at the capabilities of women and persons with disabilities who are contesting and give them their vote for a change,” she added.</p>
      <p>The Electoral Commission (EC) has set December 17, 2019, for the District Assembly and Unit Committee elections.</p>
      <p>On this day, the Electoral Commission (EC) will conduct three elections consisting of District Assembly Members, Unit Committee Members and a Referendum.</p>
      <p>Across the polling stations nationwide, there will be three ballot boxes and screens and each voter will be given three different ballot papers separately.</p>
      <p>The elections of the District Assembly Members and the Unit Committee Members form the critical core of the country’s decentralisation process by way of helping to exercise political and administrative authority in the district, provide guidance, give direction to, and supervise the other administrative authorities in the district.</p>
