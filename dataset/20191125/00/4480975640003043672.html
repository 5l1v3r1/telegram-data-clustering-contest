      <h1>USD/INR technical analysis: Indian Rupee could begin the week on a positive note</h1>

          <b>USD/INR's weekly candles with long upper wicks are signaling buyer exhaustion.</b>

      </ul>
      <p>Indian Rupee will likely post gains on the first trading day of the week, as USD/INR's bounce from 70.55 seems to have run out of steam.</p>
      <p>The back-to-back weekly candles with long upper shadows are indicating buyer exhaustion. The shallow bars on the MACD histogram are also echoing similar sentiments.</p>
      <p>Further, the pair created an inside week <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/chart/candlestick-patterns">candlestick</a> pattern last week, which occurs when a specific period's trading range falls within the preceding period's high and low. The candlestick pattern is widely considered a sign of indecision in the market place. In this case, it has appeared following a failure to hold above 72.00 and after a bounce from 70.55 and represents indecision among the bulls.</p>
      <p>In such situations, markets usually test dip demand. Therefore, the pair may drop to support at 71.46 on Monday. A break above the previous week's high of 72.00 may invite buying pressure. USD/INR closed at 71.785 on Friday. </p>
