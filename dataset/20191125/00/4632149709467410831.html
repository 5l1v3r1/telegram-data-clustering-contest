      <h1>BJP will win all 15 seats: Karnataka Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa</h1>

      <p>Karnataka Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa on Sunday said the party would win all the 15 seats and victory margin of BJP candidates would be only matter of debate in <br/>the December 5 Assembly by-polls in the state. <br/><br/>“With a deep sense of responsibility, I am saying that we will win all the 15 seats. The matter of debate, however, is the difference of votes with which the BJP candidates will win the by-elections,” he said at an election rally at Banavasi in Uttara Kannada district. <br/><br/><br/>Yediyurappa was in Banavasi to campaign for BJP candidate Shivaram Hebbar who was previously elected from the Congress but resigned from the assembly and was subsequently disqualified by the then speaker KR Ramesh Kumar. After the SC allowed the disqualified MLAs to contest the bypolls, Hebbar joined the BJP and is contesting from there. Addressing the gathering, CM acknowledged the ‘sacrifice’ of the 17 MLAs whose resignation led to the fall of Congress-JD(S) coalition government in July this year and paved the way for BJP to come to power in the state.</p>
