      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/roberto-firmino/"><b>Roberto Firmino</b></a>'s late goal helped the Reds <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/premier-league/crystal-palace-vs-liverpool_game_92629.html">beat Crystal Palace 2-1</a> on Saturday and pick up their 12th win in 13 Premier League games, maintaining their eight point advantage at the <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/premier-league/table.html">top of the table</a> in the process.</p>
      <p>Speaking to the club's official website, Alexander-Arnold said: "We have been showing that throughout the course of the season and even last season we showed how much of a good team spirit we have got and resilience.</p>
      <p>"We had a setback with their goal and we bounced back pretty much straight away. We showed our quality and went up the other end and scored.</p>
      <p>"That's what good teams do, find a way to win, and that's what we have done."</p>
