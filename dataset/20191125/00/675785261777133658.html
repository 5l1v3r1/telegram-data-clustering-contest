      <h1>General Election: How the Labour, Tory and Lib Dem manifestos compare on policy</h1>
      <h2>All the party manifestos are in - and with three weeks to go until polling day, the British people will be sizing them up to decide where to cast their vote. Here's a comparison of their policies</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:02:59+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 00:02</time> by <a rel="author">Mikey Smith, Patrick Daly, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/mikey-smith/</a></address>
      <p>All the major parties have now released their general election manifestos.</p>
      <p>The Tories, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> and the Lib Dems have unveiled their election blueprints - complete with policy platforms, spending plans and pledges.</p>
      <p>Voters throughout England and Wales will be asked to choose between them in less than three weeks' time.</p>
      <p>Labour's manifesto was hailed as a radical programme for changing the way the country works.</p>
      <p>The Lib Dem programme had abandoning <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brexit">Brexit</a> at its core.</p>
      <p>And <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> said his party's manifesto was policy-lite and risk averse.</p>
      <p>But what are the differences between the three parties and the vision they are looking to sell?</p>
      <p>Here is a look of what they are promising and where their key differences are.</p>
      <h3>Brexit</h3>
