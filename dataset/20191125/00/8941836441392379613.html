      <p>SUNRISE, Fla. (AP) - Zemgus Girgensons and Linus Ullmark ended the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/buffalo-sabres/">Buffalo Sabres</a>’ three-game losing streak.</p>
      <p>Girgensons scored twice, Ullmark made 43 saves and the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/buffalo-sabres/">Sabres</a> beat the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/florida-panthers/">Florida Panthers</a> 5-2 on Sunday night to snap a three-game losing streak.</p>
      <p>“We did a lot of good things tonight and were rewarded with a `W,’” said Jack Eichel, who had a goal and two assists. “We did a good job of finding a way to get that next goal.”</p>
      <p>Victor Olofsson and Jeff Skinner also scored.</p>
      <p>“I thought (Ullmark) played an outstanding game today staying on the initial shots,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/buffalo-sabres/">Sabres</a> coach Ralph Krueger said. “He was the king of the first shots tonight. We’re really, really happy with his performance.”</p>

      <p>Brett Connolly and Noel Acciari scored for the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/florida-panthers/">Panthers</a>, and Samuel Montembeault stopped 20 shots. The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/florida-panthers/">Panthers</a> have lost two straight after winning their previous three, losing 4-2 to the Carolina Hurricanes on Saturday night. They have lost consecutive games in regulation for the first time this season.</p>
      <p>“All of a sudden you’ve got a tough weekend,” coach Joel Quenneville said. “Let’s get back to the drawing board and tighten things up and do things the right way.”</p>
      <p>Connolly’s power-play goal - on a shot from above the left circle - cut it to 4-2 at 3:08 of the third, but Girgensons countered with his second goal with 6:35 to go. Girgensons was able to push the puck into the corner of the net.</p>
      <p>“I just took it to the net, shot it once and it went in,” Girgensons said.</p>

        <p>Connolly has five goals in his past five games, but the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/florida-panthers/">Panthers</a> came away without a point in back-to-back games.</p>
        <p>“I think we’re going to have to go through something like that,” Connolly said. “Every team is going to go through it. It’s just a matter of how we respond.”</p>
        <p>Eichel made it 3-0 at 3:42 of the second on a shot from the right circle that got by the screened Montembeault. Eichel has six goals and four assists in a five-game points streak.</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/florida-panthers/">Panthers</a> closed to 3-1 midway through the second on Acciari’s shot from the low slot.</p>
        <p>Olofsson responded, taking a cross-ice pass from San Reinhart to the left circle and scoring with 5:19 left in the second.</p>
        <p>“We definitely managed the game in a way we’d like to see, finishing on opportunities, creating opportunities, and managing the lead right through,” Krueger said.</p>
        <p>Notes: <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/buffalo-sabres/">Sabres</a> C Evan Rodrigues left after 40 seconds of the first with an undisclosed injury and did not return. D Zach Bogosian made his season debut after offseason hip surgery. Assistant coach Don Granato returned to the team from a medical leave of absence since Oct. 1 due to pneumonia. Chris Taylor, who filled in for Granato, returned to Rochester of the AHL. … <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/florida-panthers/">Panthers</a> D Keith Yandle played his 821st consecutive game - the longest active run in the NHL - after missing part of Saturday night’s game at Carolina after getting hit in the face with a puck. D Riley Stillman was recalled from Springfield of the AHL on Saturday in case Yandle couldn’t play.</p>
