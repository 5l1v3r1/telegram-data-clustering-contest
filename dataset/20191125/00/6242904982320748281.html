        <b>Defender Jeremie Frimpong has praised Celtic's 'great' team effort in the thrashing of Livingston in the Scottish top flight league on Saturday.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 18-year old right back produced a Man of the Match performance as the Hoops thumped Livingston 4-0 at the Celtic Park.</p>
      <p>Frimpong posted after the game,"Great team effort. Happy to pick the MOTM."</p>
      <p>The Dutch born Ghanaian has been a revelation since joining Celtic in the summer from Manchester City.</p>
      <p>He lasted the entire duration on Saturday as James Forrest netted a brace with Osdonne Edouard and Scott Brown added the other goals.</p>
      <p>The teenager will miss Thursday's Europa League game against Stade Rennes because he was not registered for the competition.</p>
      <p>However, he remains manager Neil Lennon's first choice right back in the league.</p>
