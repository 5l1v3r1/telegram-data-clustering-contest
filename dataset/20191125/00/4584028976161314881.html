      <p>Jofra Archer has claimed he was racially abused by a member of the crowd as England lost the first Test to New Zealand by an innings and 65 runs.</p>
      <p>The opening match of England's two-Test series against the Black Caps ended in a heavy loss in Mount Maunganui, as Neil Wagner took 5-44 to decimate what was left of the tourists' batting order on Monday.</p>
      <p>Archer - who had bowling figures of 1-107 in New Zealand's innings as the hosts declared on 615-9 - put on a stand with Sam Curran (29 not out) in an attempt to rescue a draw, but the 24-year-old eventually succumbed to Wagner on 30.</p>
      <p>The Barbados-born paceman then stated afterwards he heard racist insults directed at him from a person in the crowd at the Bay Oval.</p>
      <p>"A bit disturbing hearing racial insults today whilst battling to help save my team, the crowd was been amazing this week except for that one guy," Archer tweeted.</p>
      <p>England round off their tour of New Zealand with a second and final Test at Seddon Park in Hamilton.</p>
