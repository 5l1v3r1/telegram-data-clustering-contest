      <p>Genoa - The times for the construction of the new bridge on the A6 highway between Turin and Savona, after the collapse on Sunday afternoon, “are estimated at three, maximum four months, after obtaining the availability of the areas and all the required authorizations”: the announcement arrives from “Autostrada dei fiori” (Gavio group), which has the highway concession, announcing that it has “already started the design and construction process for the new bridge”. The new viaduct will be built “<b>with a single span</b> so as to completely bypass the area hit by the landslide”</p>
