      <p>At the moment, thousands of animals are prowling the grounds of Sydney Zoo, <a href="https://www.broadsheet.com.au/sydney/city-file/article/new-zoo-western-sydney">just near Blacktown in Western Sydney</a>. They probably don’t realise, but very soon they’ll have thousands of humans gawking at them. Sydney Zoo has announced it will open on December 7.</p>
      <p>It’s the only place in Australia that combines both a zoo and an aquarium, and thanks to a nifty safari-like design, it’s wheelchair and pram-friendly. Over the past few months the zoo’s animals have slowly been introduced to their new homes. <a href="https://www.broadsheet.com.au/sydney/city-file/article/first-animals-have-arrived-sydney-zoo-citys-first-major-zoo-open-100-years">Four lions now live there</a>, alongside three hyenas, a few orangutans, a couple of cheetahs, some zebras, 11 chimps and 13 baboons. There’s also a reptile and nocturnal animal house – Australia’s biggest. It contains more than 20 nocturnal animal species and 40 species of reptiles, including venomous snakes, monitor lizards, frillneck lizards and a giant grasshopper.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.broadsheet.com.au/sydney/city-file/article/western-sydney-zoo-snakes">reptile and nocturnal animal house</a> is one of the country’s first green-roof habitats. It’s planted with native grasses to improve sustainability, blend into the zoo’s natural landscape and provide insulation for the critters inside.</p>
      <p>Sydney Zoo was founded by Sydney Aquarium owner John Burgess and his son Jake Burgess. They’ll be supporting conservation in Australia and abroad, as well as participating in on-site breeding programs for endangered species. The staff have worked with the local Darug people on a natural heritage program led by Aboriginal guides.</p>
      <p>The zoo has been designed to create a safari-like experience with boardwalks, hidden barriers and no cages. It’ll have a large show arena, gift shops, restaurants, kiosks, gardens and picnic areas.</p>
      <p>Tickets will cost $99.99 for a family of four (two adults, two children); $39.99 for adults; $29.99 for concession-card holders; and $19.99 for children aged between three and 15. Tickets are currently available online only. There will be memberships, which offer unlimited access to the zoo; free car parking; 10 per cent off food, beverages and zoo shop purchases; and discounted entry to Raging Waters (formerly Wet’n’Wild Sydney) and Singapore Zoo.</p>
      <p>
        <i>Sydney Zoo is slated to open on December 7.</i>
