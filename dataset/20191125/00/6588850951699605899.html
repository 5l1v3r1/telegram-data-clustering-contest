      <p>The Publisher and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of <i>The Chronicle</i>, Nana Kofi Coomson, has been honoured by the Ghana Journalists Association (GJA) at its 70th Anniversary and awards night held in Accra on Saturday, for his outstanding contribution to the growth of journalism in the country.<br/><br/>The award was received on behalf of Mr Coomson, who is currently out of the jurisdiction, by Mr Ebo Quansah, General Manager of the company.<br/><br/>The Publisher of <i>The Chronicle</i> is one of the pioneers in the evolution of journalism in the country.<br/><br/>From 1991 until he retired a few years ago, he wrote a series of investigative stories that shook the foundation of this country. He was awarded the coveted Journalist of the Year award in 1993.<br/><br/>He was arrested and detained a couple of times at the Ussher Fort Prisons in Accra by the Jerry Rawlings’ administration, and was at a point in time charged under the dreadful seditious libel law.<br/><br/>His passport, in some of the cases, was also seized over imaginary fear that he might leave the country.<br/><br/>The punchy stories he wrote in those days, and his writing style infuriated the powers that be at the time, to the extent of sponsoring social miscreants to dump human excreta at his Kokomlemle office in Accra.<br/><br/>As if this was not enough, helicopters were deployed and ordered to circle around his Dzorwulu residence to put the fear of God in him, so as to stop the investigative stories he was writing, which the Jerry Rawlings’ administration was not enthused about.<br/><br/>When Mr Rawlings finally left the political scene in 2000, after having metamorphosed from a military dictator to a constitutionally-elected President in 1992, Mr Coomson continued with his investigative stories and consistently kept the John Agyekum Kufuor and Professor Mills’ administrations on their toes, until he voluntarily retired a couple of years ago.<br/><br/>At the colourful event last Saturday, special awards were also conferred on the following, Charles Bannerman, Tommy Thompson (posthumous), Henry Ofori, Wallis Johnson, T.B. Oti, John Kublenu (posthumous), Kate Abam, Emmanuel Gaintu and Ray Kakraba Quarshie, Ambassador Kabral Blay-Amihere, Gifty Afenyi-Dadzie, Mr Bright Kwame Blewu, Prof PAV Ansah (posthumous), Prof Kofi Kumador, Prof Kwame Karikari, Dr Charles Wereko-Brobbey and Mr Cameron Duodu. <br/><br/>Others are Mad Elizabeth Ohene, Mad Adwoa Yeboah Afari, Mr Kwasi Pratt Jnr, Mr Abdul Malik Kweku-Baako and Mr Ben Ephson Jnr., Nana Kofi Coomson, Freddie Blay, Mr Jonas Kwaakye, Amb Haruna Atta, Mr Kwaku Sakyi-Addo, Anas Aremeyaw Anas, Prof Audery Gadzekpo, Mr Steve Manteaw, <b>Dr. Osei Kwame Despite</b>, Sir Sam Jonah, Nana Kwame Korang V, Mr Herbert Mensah, Prof Henrietta Mensah Bonsu, and Ambassador Nyaho Nyaho Tamakloe among others.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Doreen Hammond, a Columnist with the Graphic Communications Group Limited, who won the Journalist of the Year 2018 award at the just-ended Ghana Journalists (GJA) awards night, has said journalism is more than politics.<br/><br/>Doreen, who sounded emotional last Saturday, November 24, 2019, when giving her remarks at the awards ceremony after being adjudged Journalist of the Year, urged her colleagues to continue to be the voice of the voiceless.<br/><br/>She encouraged those she called the many journalists behind the scenes that they should not stop what they do, as one day, they would be seen and acknowledged accordingly in God’s own time.<br/><br/>“Before I take my seat, I will like to urge my colleagues to continue to hold the ethics of this noble profession of ours. Let us continue to be a voice for the voiceless and contribute our quota towards sharpening this dear nation of ours. Certainly, journalism is much more than politics.” The 24th edition of the GJA awards, which took place in Accra, brought together people of the inky fraternity, opinion leaders, which included government officials, captains of industries, and traditional rulers.<br/><br/>The night began on a good note, as the organisers made sure dignitaries attending the event had their stomachs filled for the long hours. One was greeted with varieties of meals, both local and continental. Trust me, if you even had a little obvious security hitches at the gate before entering, the sight of the colorful dishes was good enough to calm you.<br/><br/>The Ghana Police Band treated the guests with soothing music whilst they dined. Some people used the opportunity on the arrival to take pictures and also socialise, warming up for the big night.<br/><br/>The main event commenced, and along the line, witnessed the arrival of the Vice President, Dr Mahamudu Bawumia, who had come from a different programme and was billed to attend another by 10pm that same night.<br/><br/>At about 2130hrs GMT, the Vice President was called to give his address, during which he stressed that the government needed the critical and analytical lenses of the media.<br/><br/>Acknowledging the power of the media, he expressed no doubt about the power of the press, and added that the media served as the front burner of agenda setting for political parties’ manifestos.<br/><br/>He added that the crown of the successful democracy the country enjoys today must be given to the media for its role. He called for constructive criticism in a way that best shapes the nation in the right direction.<br/><br/>In her welcome address, the Chairperson for the occasion, Gifty Afenyi-Dadzie, said the 70th Anniversary of the GJA should be used as a reflection of the best, and to improve upon the future.<br/><br/>Whilst indicating that the media had been visible in the fight to solidify the democracy of this republic, she also urged the media to actively get involved in the upcoming referendum to help the masses to be well informed.<br/><br/>The President of the GJA, Roland Affail Monney chronicled the journey of the Association, and indicated that for seven full decades, “our God of covenant’s faithfulness has kept faith with our forebears and members.”<br/><br/>Despite the killing of some journalists and the jailing of others some years back, Mr Monney noted that “today, all the assassinations, all the intimidations, all the<br/><br/>incarcerations have rolled into a huge tapestry of joy; joy unconfined, which has enveloped this auditorium.”<br/><br/>According to him, the media has played a major role in the fight against corruption than all the anti-graft agencies in the country. He likened the professional gem of some aged journalists, which dazzled their readers and listeners, to diamond which never ceases to sparkle.<br/><br/>Making mention of key journalists who still write prolifically with editorial skills and linguist craftmanship, Mr Monney acknowledged The Chronicle’s Ebo Quansah, Elizabeth Ohene, and Benard Avle, among others.<br/><br/>Commenting on the upcoming general election, which first sees campaigns from the competing political parties, the GJA President used the platform of the 24th Awards and the 70th Anniversary of the Association and told politicians, “touch not innocent journalists.”<br/><br/>Last Saturday was a night of African or traditional outfits.<br/><br/>The guests were beautifully and handsomely clothed in local fabrics, neatly designed to fit the body types.<br/><br/>Speaking at the ceremony on behalf of the Information Minister, Kojo Oppong Nkrumah, a Deputy, Pius Enam Hadzide, said his Ministry recognised the important contributions of the media in disseminating information to the public.<br/><br/>He added that the contributions of the media in creating functioning democracies, and the potential it carries as the catalyst for human development, is key to the development of the country.<br/><br/>According to him, a free, independent, pluralistic media empowers citizens with information that enables them to make an informed choice and actively participate in the democratic process.<br/><br/>During the ceremony, an observation made on the screen that projected the various categories was the spelling of reporter, which was spelt ‘reportor,’ a development which has caused stir on social media.<br/><br/>As that was not enough, Mr Yaw Boadu Ayeboafoh, Chairman of the National Media Commission, when called to give a message on behalf of his outfit, indicated that the list of previous award winners, which were captured in the brochure for the event, had some errors.<br/><br/>Using previous instances when the media had taken other people on for such errors, including when an official could not pronounce FIFA, economy, and when Uhuru Kenyatta became President of Ghana, he brought the attention of the organisers to the mistakes in the list.<br/><br/>“…And, therefore, we need to criticise ourselves that what is worth doing is worth doing well,” he said.<br/><br/><br/>Featured Video</p>
