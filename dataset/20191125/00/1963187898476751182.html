      <p>CAIRO – 25 November 2019: Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry on Monday hailed the Palestinian people for their historical resistance and struggle to achieve comprehensive and just peace. <br/><br/>This comes days after US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that his country would no longer abide by 1978 State Department opinion, which call the Israeli settlements in West Bank against international law. <br/><br/>Speaking at an extraordinary session of the Arab League, Shoukry expressed categorical rejection of the unilateral decisions made concerning the Palestinian cause. <br/><br/>He affirmed that the achievement of a political solution must be based on the two-state solution and relevant international laws, including establishing an Independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital. <br/><br/>Shoukry affirmed that forcibly imposing unilateral laws could not grant any legitimacy for changes on the ground, and would undermine chances to resume peace process, encourage public tension and make Palestinian people lose hope in the possibility to settle the conflict peacefully. <br/><br/>Pompeo on November 18th announced reversing the Barack "Obama administration’s approach towards Israeli settlements," which declared them internationally illegal. <br/><br/>Responding to Pompeo's remarks, UN Spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric said the longstanding position of the UN regarding Israeli settlements in "Occupied Palestinian Territory" – that they are in breach of international law – is unchanged, according to the UN website. <br/><br/>He added that the UN remains “committed to a two-State solution based on the relevant UN resolutions”.</p>
