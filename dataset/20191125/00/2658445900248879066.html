      <p>The President of the World Federation of Neurological Surgeons (WFNS), Prof. Nelson Oyesiku, has urged the federal and state governments to ensure the provision of modern equipment in hospitals.</p>
      <p>Oyesiku, who is also the director of the American Board of Neurosurgery, said efforts should be made by the government to put in place facilities for neurosurgery in the country, particularly in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital, which already has a neuropsychiatric hospital.</p>
      <p>He said having facilities for neurosurgery and other complex medical operations in the country had become imperative to check the current situation where Nigerians requiring such medical attention were being taken to hospitals abroad for treatment and to also stop the relocation of Nigerian doctors and other medical professionals trooping abroad in droves.</p>

      <p>Oyesiku said that the major problem confronting the medical sector was the lack of modern medical equipment in hospitals.</p>
      <p>The neurosurgeon, who has been selected by the Consumer Research Council of America as one of America’s topmost surgeons, spoke shortly after he was conferred with the traditional chieftaincy title of the Baasegun Alabe of Egba by the Alake of Egbaland, Oba Adedotun Aremu Gbadebo.</p>
