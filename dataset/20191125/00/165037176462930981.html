        <b>Sergio Aguero will miss next month's Manchester derby after being ruled out for "a few weeks" with a thigh injury, Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola said on Monday.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>The City striker hobbled out of the champions' 2-1 Premier League win</b> over Chelsea at the Etihad Stadium on Saturday, and Guardiola is unsure how long the Argentine will be sidelined but<b> is resigned to his missing the visit of Manchester United </b>on December 7.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/manchester-city-fc/">City</a> boss, speaking at a press conference to preview Tuesday's Champions League clash with Shakhtar Donetsk, said: "<b>He will be out a few games</b>. I don't know exactly, for a few weeks he will be out." Asked if the 31-year-old would miss the derby, Guardiola said: "Yes." Pushed further on the matter, he added: "<b>Maybe we will have a miracle but I don't think so</b>."</p>
      <p>Aguero's absence will mean opportunities for Brazil striker <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/gabriel-jesus-266974/">Gabriel Jesus</a>. The 22-year-old has scored five goals this season but has started only eight times due to the presence of Aguero. Jesus, who was sat alongside Guardiola, said: "<b>I am not happy because Sergio is injured</b>. I don't like it when my friends are injured but I work here every day and I am ready to play." <b>Jesus admitted it was frustrating to be on the bench </b>regularly but he is not complaining.</p>
      <p>"When I decided to come to City<b> I knew it is going to be hard</b> because we have Sergio, who is the top scorer of the club and he scores every game," he said. <b>"I know this but I think I have a chance to play with Pep,</b> with top players here and at great big club, so that is why I came, to enjoy and learn."</p>

      <p>Guardiola was also asked about the future of his highly rated assistant Mikel Arteta,<b> who has again been linked with his former club</b> <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/arsenal/">Arsenal</a>. Arteta was touted as a potential successor to Arsene Wenger at the Emirates Stadium last year and <b>his name is again being put forward</b> with current Gunners boss Unai Emery under pressure.</p>
      <p>"<b>Of course he (Arteta) will be a manager sooner or later</b>," said the City boss. "We are going to finish the season but in future I don't know what will happen. <b>I'd like him to stay with us as much as possible.</b>"</p>
      <p>City, five points clear at the top of Group C, are under little pressure heading into Tuesday's match. <b>A draw will be sufficient to secure their place</b> in the last 16 for a seventh successive year with a game to spare.</p>
      <p>Guardiola said: "<b>The position we have is good</b> ... Tomorrow we have the chance to close the group stage. <b>We have to do our best to go to Zagreb </b>(for the last game) with the job done."</p>
