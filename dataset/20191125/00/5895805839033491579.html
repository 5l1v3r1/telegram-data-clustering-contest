        <b>Introduction</b>
      </p>
      <p>Faculty, residents, and students at my university are participating in the Disney Plus Dream Job challenge to watch 30 Disney films in 30 days. This blog is day #2! Course directors successfully incorporated the 30 films (and shows) into our preexisting curriculum that teaches <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/psychiatry">psychiatry</a> to future physicians through film and other aspects of popular culture. Views Through the Psychiatrist’s Lens will publish daily blogs throughout Disney Plus Dream Job challenge. Our second blog is on the 1991 film, <i>Beauty and the Beast</i>.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Synopsis</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>Beauty and the Beast</i> is a 1991 animated Disney classic based on the French fairy tale of the same name by Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont. The film is about a prince who is magically transformed into a beast as <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/punishment">punishment</a> for his arrogance and Belle, a young woman whom he imprisons in his castle (1).</p>
      <p>
        <b>What it has to do with psychiatry</b>
      </p>
      <p>The trope of the young man turned into a beast is perhaps best portrayed in the <i>Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</i> (1886), a gothic novella written by Robert Louis Stevenson. The book is regarded as a fictional case of the impaired physician as discussed in a <a href="https://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.ajp.157.3.484">letter to the editor</a> by Altschuler and colleagues (2000).</p>
      <p>If we take the prince-turned-beast’s talking to cups, pots, and candelabras as his attending to perceptual disturbances, the film then demonstrates <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/psychosis">psychosis</a> in its main character. There are three primary mechanisms where alcohol can induce psychotic features. We’ll examine these potential etiologies to investigate what truly afflicts the arrogant prince.</p>
      <p>
        <i>
          <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/conditions/alcohol-use-disorder">Alcohol Intoxication</a>
        </i>
      </p>
      <p>Acute intoxication from liquor that has a high alcohol by volume (proof) may induce psychotic symptoms such as <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/conditions/hallucinogen-persisting-perception-disorder">hallucinations</a> and delusions. Might then the eponymous beast be a reimagined Mr. Hyde? If so, we would expect to observe additional signs of alcohol intoxication in the film. To this end, the beast does demonstrate an unsteady gait. Since Alcohol Intoxication (<a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/artificial-intelligence">AI</a>) is defined as clinically significant maladaptive behavioral or psychological changes that develop during or shortly after alcohol ingestion as evidenced by at least one sign, his ataxia alone may be indicative of AI. This is admittedly a low threshold, so we’ll continue to explore other clinical possibilities.</p>
      <p>
        <i>Alcohol Withdrawal</i>
      </p>
      <p>Individuals who stop drinking (e.g. if they stop drinking abruptly, and especially if alcohol use had been heavy and prolonged) are at risk to develop <a href="https://psychcentral.com/disorders/alcohol-withdrawal/">alcohol withdrawal</a>. The Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome (AWS) can be uncomplicated or complicated. Complicated withdrawal states include 2 that are characterized by psychosis: Alcohol Withdrawal <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/conditions/delirium">Delirium</a> (formerly known as <a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000766.htm">Delirium Tremens or DTs</a>) and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3830167/">Alcoholic Hallucinosis</a>. While the former is characterized by acute confusion and clouding of consciousness, the latter predominantly manifests as auditory hallucinations, but visual hallucinations may occur. In either case, these complicated states of alcohol withdrawal confer a risk of death in about 5% of cases. Since the beast does not appear confused, his perceptual disturbances may be due to a rare case <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/alcohol">Alcoholic</a> Hallucinosis.</p>
      <p>
        <i>Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome</i>
      </p>
      <p>Also known as “dry beriberi,” <a href="https://www.caregiver.org/wernicke-korsakoff-syndrome">Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome</a> is a neurological syndrome caused by thiamine (B1) deficiency often due to chronic alcohol ingestion. In later stages (called Korsakoff psychosis), individuals may experience hallucinations and delusions. This condition is a late manifestation of chronic alcohol use and, unlike the above scenarios; affected individuals do not have to be actively drinking in order to experience psychosis. In addition to perceptual disturbances, Korsakoff psychosis is hallmarked by amnesia and confabulation. In the film, the young prince’s age is inconsistent with someone afflicted with Korsakoff psychosis.</p>
      <p>With <i>Beauty and the Beast</i> viewed as a fictional case account of Alcohol Use Disorder, there are 3 scenarios where his psychotic symptoms may be attributed to the underlying <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/conditions/substance-related-disorders">substance use disorder</a>. Of these, the complicated withdrawal syndrome of Alcoholic Hallucinosis appears to be the most likely. It should be no surprise then that Walt Disney Productions has given us the DSM-5 criteria for Alcohol Withdrawal:</p>
      <p>(a) <b>B</b>lood pressure and pulse elevations</p>
      <p>(b) <b>E</b>mesis or nausea</p>
      <p>(c, d) <b>A</b>nxiety; <b>A</b>gitation</p>
      <p>(e, f) <b>S</b>eizures; <b>S</b>leep disturbance</p>
      <p>(g, h) <b>T</b>ransient visual, tactile, or auditory hallucinations or illusions; <b>T</b>remor</p>

      </h4>
      <p>Submitted by Caitlin Schroen on November 25, 2019 - 9:45pm</p>
      <p>As many would agree, Gaston clearly shows traits of narcissistic personality disorder. This disorder is characterized by a long-term pattern of exaggerated feelings of self-importance and an excessive need for admiration. One of many examples showing that Gaston has this disorder is the fact that he was planning a wedding prior to even asking Belle to marry him as the idea that she would say no simply did not occur to him. Something that should be considered when dealing with narcissistic personality disorder is the idea of narcissistic injury. This occurs when a narcissist feel that their “true self” has been revealed, usually after their importance is brought into question. In the case of Gaston, his importance is brought into question when he is not only rejected by Belle but rejected for a “beast.” Narcissistic injury such as this can cause great distress and emotional dysregulation and can even lead to rage and violence. Therefore, Gaston’s attack on the castle and desire to kill the beast is also consistent with Gaston having narcissistic personality disorder.</p>

      <p>Interesting take on Beauty and the Beast, Dr. Tobia. However I’m not sure we ever get anything in the movie that ever suggests the Beast has been abusing alcohol. It seems more likely to me that his PTSD stems from extreme trauma - we know he’s a young teenager when the Enchantress shows up, and he appears to have no family left. Could the Enchantress actually have done something to his family, and/or be a metaphor for some sort of war that struck the kingdom? We see that the entire kingdom, not just the Beast, becomes gloomy once the “curse” is in place. If the Beast has suffered severe trauma and is dealing with a more severe form of PTSD, he could suffer from auditory and visual hallucinations and delusions.</p>

      <p>It's interesting that you associate the state of psychosis with the Prince/Beast. While I was watching the movie, I thought about with respect to Belle. The Princess began to interact, talk, and sing with the inanimate objects upon arrival to the Beast's castle. Surely she was also suffering from a state of psychosis. However unlike the Beast, her precipitating factors were not due to alcohol but in my view due to PTSD induced psychosis. She suffered the horror of trying to save her father and ultimately became the Beast's prisoner. According to a study in the Schizophrenia Bulletin, estimates suggest a significantly higher rate of PTSD in psychotic disorder patients (approximately 30%) versus that in the general population (7.8%). This can explain why Belle was hallucinating and had a distorted perception of reality. It's interesting that the royal couple ultimately suffered the same mental fate but took different paths to get there. Maybe they really are meant to be.</p>
