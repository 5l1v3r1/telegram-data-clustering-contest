      <h1>Brown Hill home invasion accused returns to Ballarat court</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:30:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 00:30</time> by <a rel="author">Erin Williams</a></address>
      <p>A woman accused of invading a Brown Hill home has been released from custody after 18 months on remand.</p>
      <p>Georgia Lynch, along with co-accused Timothy Rodger and Luke Ross, allegedly attended the Bradbury Street house on July 2, 2018, to confront the owner over a $50 debt.</p>
      <p>Police allege at 12.30am, the trio were armed with a meat cleaver and block of timber when they smashed the property's front windows before forcing entry inside.</p>
      <p>A number of items were allegedly damaged inside the house after the frightened owner ran out of the back door to hide.</p>
      <p>Lynch, who had been in custody for 508 days, made an application for bail at the County Court in Ballarat on Friday. She was required to show exceptional circumstances why she should be bailed.</p>
      <p>Her barrister submitted Lynch experienced depression and anxiety, and there had been a significant delay before she would stand trial in April.</p>
      <p>Crown prosecutor Daryl Brown said the prosecution opposed Lynch's application because she had not met exceptional circumstances.</p>
      <p>But Judge Michael Bourke said Lynch had established exceptional circumstances and her unacceptable risk to the community could be addressed by bail conditions.</p>
      <p>He said his reasons for granting bail included Lynch's sentence could be less than the time she had spent on remand, she was at risk of losing her accommodation and co-accused Ross had been bailed in the Supreme Court.</p>
      <p>Lynch was released on bail with conditions including she report to a police station twice a week, not contact prosecution witnesses, not to leave Victoria, not to attend international points of departure, abide by a curfew, not to consume alcohol or drugs and to live at a Ballarat East address.</p>
      <p>Lynch, who has been charged with aggravated home invasion and aggravated burglary, will return to the County Court for the circuit starting in Ballarat in July.</p>
      <p>Rodger and Ross' charges have resolved to a plea hearing, which has been set down in the July circuit.</p>
