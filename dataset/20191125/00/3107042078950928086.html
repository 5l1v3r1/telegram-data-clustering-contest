      <p>The way it started, it could have been much more.</p>
      <p>A first-minute goal laid the perfect platform.</p>
      <p>But it was an opening Southern United could not capitalise on.</p>
      <p>It was left to settle for a 1-1 draw with Auckland at Logan Park Turf in its last home national women's league game of the season.</p>
      <p>Southern dominated the early play.</p>
      <p>That began after just 28 seconds, as Renee Bacon gave Southern a dream start.</p>
      <p>She received the ball outside the box on the left and produced a superb strike that beat Auckland goalkeeper Nadia Olla, sneaking inside the right post.</p>
      <p>Emily Morison nearly doubled the lead on a narrow miss 30 seconds later, before Amy Hislop had a free kick saved in the third minute.</p>
      <p>Hislop only just missed again two minutes later and a second goal seemed inevitable.</p>
      <p>But it was Auckland that found the net, taking its chance despite making little play.</p>
      <p>A break down the right exposed Southern in the middle and Stephanie Skilton buried a shot after being found from a cross.</p>
      <p>From there the game began to break down.</p>
      <p>Chances became fewer, although Southern had a brilliant one early in the second half.</p>
      <p>Morison played Bacon into space, before pushing it forward to Hislop, who had her shot well saved by Olla.</p>
      <p>Not long after Skilton was denied by the left post.</p>
      <p>Auckland began to get on top late and while the Southern defence showed steel, it struggled to clear the ball.</p>
      <p>Despite that, it held out the attack, Mikaela Hunt in particular standing out and goal keeper Jade Middleditch making a handful of great saves.</p>
      <p>Ruby Anderson went close to stealing a win late for Southern, but her shot went just over the crossbar.</p>
      <p>Southern head coach Ignacio Sande admitted the side had been after three points, although he was happy with the performance.</p>
      <p>He felt the inability to capitalise on the early dominance was costly.</p>
      <p>"I think that was the key.</p>
      <p>"We had a great start, scored a goal in 30 seconds and then the first 10 minutes we had chances and clear options and we missed those chances.</p>
      <p>"Then they have quality players, they only had two shots and they scored one in the first half.</p>
      <p>"So a bit disappointed with that, but happy with what the players did."</p>
      <p>He was happy with the way the side held out Auckland late, although he felt it needed to push through and finish stronger.</p>
      <p>The draw leaves Southern on 17 points in fourth, two behind Auckland.</p>
      <p>It has one game left next week, against Capital, in Wellington.</p>
