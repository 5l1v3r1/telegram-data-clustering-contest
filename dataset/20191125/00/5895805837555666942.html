      <p>Verbal praise is the best kind of reward because it doesn’t come from purchases at a store or through online clicks. It doesn’t cost anything. And most importantly, it’s more meaningful to your child than getting a toy, a treat, or another trip to the sporting goods store, which can feel like bribery to you and your child. Of course, giving other kinds of rewards, such as more video game time or a new toy, or candy, or ice cream, to cooperative kids is not necessarily inappropriate or wrong. In some situations, it can be an appropriate and effective way to further encourage positive behavior in defiant children.</p>
      <p>That said, I have never met a child, <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/adolescence">teen</a>, or an adult who did not, deep down, want her parents to say, “We’re so proud of you,” or, “I really admire the time and hard work you put into that.” People of all ages crave the approval of their parents. You are a powerful person to your child. You always have been and you always will be.</p>
      <p>As I explain in my book, <i>10 Days to a Less Defiant Child, 2nd Ed. </i>praise from you has a special kind of weight. It means something. And whether your child is eight months, eight years, or twenty-eight years old, she always wants to know that you’re proud of her.</p>
      <p>
        <b>How to Verbally Praise Your Child</b>
      </p>
      <p>Now that you know how effective a reward praise can be for your child’s positive behavior, it’s important to make sure your praise is meaningful. When giving praise, it’s critical to keep the following points in mind:</p>
      <p><b>Sincerity counts. </b>Even though defiant children view themselves as your equal, they also hold feelings of <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/embarrassment">shame</a>. Most defiant children that I have worked with have a hard time believing their parents praise because they often view it as insincere. Using the power of understanding you can be sincere more easily view you view your child in a much more positive way. To help with this, realize that his emotional immaturity and defiant behaviors were not behaviors he chose to have. To be sincere all you need to do is be honest and speak from your heart. Say something like “I’m proud of you for being home on time.”</p>
      <p><b>Be Specific. </b>Your praise also will be perceived as more sincere and powerful when you make it specific. Telling your child what you are specifically praising him for helps him to know exactly what he is doing so well. A comment such as “Thanks for saying please and thank you” helps your child know exactly which positive behaviors they are using. This is more effective than just saying, “You had good manners today.” Saying, “I really liked how you helped me load and unload the groceries with no complaints” is more specific than “I liked your behavior when we went shopping.”</p>
      <p><b>Less is more. </b>To keep your child from thinking that you are being insincere, make your positive comment and then stop talking about it. Keep it simple: “You were so patient and helpful in the store today.” Don’t lessen the impact by talking on and on about it. If she shrugs it off as if she doesn’t care, don’t be fooled. You don’t have to convince her by saying, “Oh, no really! I couldn’t get over how much better you were.”</p>
      <p><b>Show the contrast.</b> It’s important that you let your child know what exactly he did that was different from before and why it was helpful. For example, you may say, “Thanks for clearing your books off the table without my asking you. It really helped me focus on getting the kitchen cleaned up while you did that.” Or, “I really appreciated how you went over and put food in the dog’s dish while I was on the phone.”</p>
      <p><b>The sooner the better. </b>Try to deliver praise as soon as possible after spotting the right action. The longer the delay, the smaller the impact will be on motivating more desirable behaviors. Naturally, a few moments might pass you by, especially in the beginning. It’s still okay to bring it up by saying, “I meant to tell you that I noticed how you shared your toys with your brother today. That was very considerate of you.”</p>
      <p><b>Be varied and random.</b> Avoid saying the same thing every time you praise your child. The more varied your verbal rewards, the more captivating they will be. Think about this for a minute. When someone passes you every day and says “hi” with the same tone and demeanor, you may start to get distracted by other things. If, however, the person acts more animated or asks you questions, you may become more tuned in. If you say, “Great job,” every time your child does something good, that compliment will start to lose meaning. She’ll think you’re on autopilot, and she’ll be right. Varying your comments will help your child continue to perceive your praise as honest and heartfelt.</p>
      <p><b>Don’t hold back.</b> Some parents <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/fear">fear</a> that if they praise too much, their child will rebel against the praise. As long as you are speaking from your heart and not going overboard, I don’t think there’s such a thing as too much praise for the positive moves your child makes.</p>

        <b>An Example or How Praise Can Quickly Work Wonders</b>
      </p>
      <p>Marilyn and Alex were the parents of a defiant seven-year-old boy named Bobby. I had counseled this family for a few sessions, and they had made some very strong progress.</p>
      <p>But when they first came to see me, Bobby was taking his frustrations out by hitting the family cat and throwing major temper tantrums. During one of our early sessions I asked the parents if they had been praising Bobby. Both Marilyn and Alex looked down sheepishly and said, “Not as much as we could be.” When I asked why, they explained to me that they were afraid to “rock the boat.” I helped them see that giving Bobby praise for positive behaviors would make the boat stronger and more seaworthy.</p>
      <p>Bobby came in to see me a few weeks later with his parents for a follow-up visit. He was beaming, giggly, and very cheerful. When I asked Bobby why he was so happy, he told me how his mother had "caught" him doing something really good for a change. Marilyn and I both had a laugh as she said, “Out of the mouths of babes."</p>
