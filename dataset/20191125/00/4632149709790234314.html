      <p><i>By Sharvani Kashyap<br/><br/>People thronged the festival a day ahead as groundnut stalls have already been put up</i> <br/><br/>All roads in Basavanagudi led to the Bull temple, the venue for Kadalekai Parishe (groundnut fair). While the official inauguration is supposed to happen today, groundnut vendors had already set up their stalls on Sunday and patrons, including people from across the state, flocked to the venue in large numbers. The two-day annual fair, held on the iconic Bull Temple Road, has around 10,000 stalls. The parishe’s origin dates back to the time when Bengaluru was founded and is the oldest folk festival in the city. The Basavangudi Kadalekai Parishe is preceded by other groundnut festivals across the city. Recently, groundnut festivals were held in Venkatala and Malleswaram. <br/><br/>Two carnivals are held in Basavanagudi. There’s the ‘chikka’ parishe, or the small fair that starts a week in advance, then there’s the ‘dodda’ (big) parishe that begins on Karthuka Somawara (the last Monday in the month of Karthika, according to the Hindu calendar). Legend traces the carnival’s origin to the city’s founder Nadaprabhu Hiriya Kempegowda. <br/><br/>According to the legend, groundnut farmers around two temples, Dodda Basavanagudi (big bull) and Dodda Ganesha, were being harassed by thieves. It is believed that Lord Shiva sent a bull to guard the farms of his devotees. The villagers also ganged up to catch the thieves. However, the villagers ended up killing the bull that was sent to guard their farms, cursing the groundnut production. The legend also tells that the bull turned into stone and was even installed in a temple by Kempegowda. Groundnuts started to grow again, but it would only survive after the first offering had been made to the bull. It is believed that the statue is growing. It is said that Bengaluru was founded the same year (1537) that the temple was built.</p>
