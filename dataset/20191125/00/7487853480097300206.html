      <h1>Zinedine Zidane Admits He Is 'in Love With' Real Madrid Transfer Target Kylian Mbappe</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.90min.com/users/15111589" target="_blank">Ed Alexander</a></address>
      <p>​Real Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane has spoken of his 'love' for Paris Saint-Germain forward Kylian Mbappe, who has been heavily linked with a world record move to the Bernabeu.</p>
      <p>The two clubs meet on Tuesday night in the Champions League, and Les Parisiens would seal their place as top spot in Group A with a victory at the Bernabeu. </p>
      <p>It has been suggested Real could make a €400m bid for Mbappe next summer, with Zidane's recent comments set to add more wood to the fire.</p>

      <p>PSG are reportedly working to tie the 20-year-old down to a <a href="https://www.90min.com/posts/6502401-psg-lining-up-bumper-new-deal-for-kylian-mbappe-to-fend-off-real-madrid-interest">​new contract</a> at Parc des Princes, which would see him earn €30m-a-season plus bonuses.</p>
      <p>Speaking ahead of the clash, Zidane said, as quoted by <a href="https://www.marca.com/en/football/real-madrid/2019/11/25/5ddbccaf46163f93168b4576.html">​Marca</a>: "You know that I've known him for a long time. I'm already in love with him as a person first, because he came here a long time ago for a trial. He's the rival now, so I can't say any more."</p>
      <p>In response to his praise for Mbappe, Thomas Tuchel stated (as quoted by journalist Arancha Rodriguez on <a href="https://twitter.com/AranchaMOBILE/status/1199017318157897728">​Twitter</a>): "I don't know how or how much Zidane is in love with Kylian, but the important thing is that Mbappe is our player. Often, we fall in love with things we can't have."</p>
      <p>Zidane's praise for Mbappe comes a day after <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/real-madrid">​Real</a> forward Eden Hazard <a href="https://www.90min.com/posts/6504153-eden-hazard-admits-he-wants-real-madrid-to-sign-kylian-mbappe-as-psg-continue-new-deal-talks">​admitted</a> he wants the club to sign the France international, who has scored 69 goals in 98 games for the Ligue 1 champions.</p>

      <p>The Madrid coach then gave an insight into his side's approach to the match, explaining: "It's the most important game of the season. We'll be against a very good team and will have to be prepared.</p>
      <p>"We need heart and head, but especially good football. We've changed and it's not a rematch [of PSG's 3-0 victory in September]. We want to play well and continue our form. It's a game to confirm our turnaround."</p>
