        <i>With much of New South Wales and Queensland under threat from bushfires last week, educators and leaders from a variety of <a href="https://affinityeducation.com.au/">Affinity Education Group</a> were quick to respond, stepping up their community spirit and arranging for donations to support those most in need.</i>
      </h3>
      <p>Lauren White, Centre Manager from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/KidsAcademyPreschool/">Kids Academy Preschool</a> in NSW, said she was proud of the way the community, both inside and outside the centre, had responded to be crisis, collecting and donating supplies and resources in order to aid victims of local bushfires and also firefighters from the Rural Fire Service (RFS).</p>
      <p>“In just two days parents and families donated many important supplies such as bottled water, tinned food, toiletries and blankets,” Ms White said.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/MilestonesPittTown/posts/?ref=page_internal">Milestones Early Learning Pitt Town</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/KidsAcademyPreschool/">Kids Academy Preschool</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/KidsAcademyGlenmorePark/">Kids Academy Glenmore Park</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/KidsAcademyPenrith/">Kids Academy Penrith</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/KidsAcademyRegentville/">Kids Academy Regentville</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/PitttownELC/">Pitt Town Early Learning Centre</a> all participated in the drive.</p>
      <p>The drive has been important to many staff members and families at Pitt Town ELC. Centre Manager Catherine Magazzu explained that many community members had been on high alert due to the severity and close range of the fires to Pitt Town, but that the pressure “has only united the community”.</p>
