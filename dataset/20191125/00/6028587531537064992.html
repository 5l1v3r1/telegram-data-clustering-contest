      <p>“The Fiend” Bray Wyatt prevailed over Daniel Bryan in his first defense of the WWE Universal Championship at Survivor Series. When comparing the two characters, a win for The Fiend felt inevitable. After the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alfredkonuwa/2019/10/06/wwe-hell-in-a-cell-2019-results-news-and-notes-after-controversial-dq-finish-for-the-fiend-vs-seth-rollins/">referee stoppage heard ‘round the world</a> at Hell in a Cell, The Fiend has emerged as the Universal champion on the Blue Brand with no Brock Lesnar in sight after The Beast quit Friday Night SmackDown to go hunting for Rey Mysterio on Raw.</p>
      <p>Daniel Bryan, on the other hand, is a character in transition. Much of this feud was built through Bryan’s eternally lingering conflict with The Miz, who is currently a babyface. Bryan’s continued back-and-forth with his longtime foe caused a lot of confusion as to whether or not he was entering this feud as the babyface against otherwise popular heel The Fiend.</p>
      <p>This wasn’t the Daniel Bryan of 2014, whose overwhelming popularity led to outrage—similar to that following Hell in a Cell—as <a href="https://www.wrestlinginc.com/news/2015/08/daniel-bryan-on-fans-being-able-to-change-wwe-plans-599007/">WWE stubbornly hindered his journey</a> to become WWE world heavyweight champion.</p>
      <p>This version of Daniel Bryan, however, was fresh off a run as a heel world champion, mourning the betrayal of his former henchman Erick Rowan and indecisive as to whether or not the Yes Movement was dead.</p>
      <p>This was a shell of peak Daniel Bryan and that guy doomed to fail against WWE’s hottest character, but with a potential feud against The Miz looming, Bryan could be close to heating up all over again.</p>
