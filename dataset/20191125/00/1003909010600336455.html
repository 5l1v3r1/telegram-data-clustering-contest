      <h1>Budget battle: Councillors at opposite ends of debate on city tax scenarios</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:07:23+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 00:07</time> by <a rel="author">Alanna Smith</a></address>
      <p>Calgary Coun. Gian-Carlo Carra said he’s “heartsick” going into budget negotiations Monday, as council members clash over proposed tax changes in the city.</p>
      <p>On Monday, citizens will get their say on the 2020 budget during an all-day public consultation session at city hall. The rest of the week will see council members propose cuts aimed at keeping tax increases minimal or static, with the tax hike and residential/business tax shift to be decided Thursday.</p>
      <p>“I hope that council goes in with an open mind and, despite a lot of the chatter . . . we really think about what it is we’re doing and the kind of city we want to build during this budgeting exercise,” said Carra.</p>
      <p>Carra is opting for the previously approved 3.03 per cent tax hike on homeowners, despite the fact that some council members have since <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/2020-budget-city-tax-scenarios-include-cuts-to-police-and-fire-loss-of-236-workers">signalled they would push for a budgetary freeze and cuts to services in the year ahead</a>.</p>
      <p>Further complicating the matter, council will also decide whether to tweak the ratio of property taxes paid by homeowners and businesses to tackle the downtown tax crisis.</p>
      <p>Carra said it’s necessary for council to adjust to a 48/52 split with homeowners paying a larger share of taxes, to help “mom and pop shops” which have faced growing tax bills.</p>
      <p>But it could be a “nightmare scenario,” if residential taxes increase at the same time that city services are cut.</p>
      <p>“If we do a massive, massive tax increase for our residents (at) the same time we are cutting the quality of services we get — that’s insane,” said Carra. “We should not be cutting services.</p>
      <p>“We should be maintaining services,” he added. “We should be building things that we need and we should be equitably sharing the responsibly for this amazing city we live in.”</p>
      <p>Carra noted that regardless of how the tax burden shifts, Calgarians are still getting a good deal in comparison to other cities in Canada and across North America.</p>
      <p>Currently, council members are considering a <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/2020-budget-city-tax-scenarios-include-cuts-to-police-and-fire-loss-of-236-workers">handful of tax scenarios</a>, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A zero-per-cent tax increase that would force cuts to the police and fire department;</li>
        <li>A limited tax increase of 1.5 per cent that would preserve police budgets, but slash fire and emergency services;</li>
        <li>A plan to maintain a 3.03-per-cent hike that would protect police and fire budgets.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>At the same time, other councillors are pushing for cuts of five per cent on spending for municipal services.</p>

      <p>This proposal — backed by councillors Jeromy Farkas, Sean Chu and Joe Magliocca — was pitched in hopes of finding an additional $50 million in the 2020 budget without touching essential services like police, fire and public transit.</p>
      <p>“My fear is that (the budget) is only going to be about nibbling around the edges,” said Farkas. “Even in the zero per cent scenario, if council were to adopt that, spending is still going up.</p>
      <p>“The scale of the reductions that are being considered is just not enough to change how the city operates, how it approaches doing business,” he said. “We have to take our cues from households and businesses who have had to make very significant sacrifices in order to survive in this economy.”</p>
      <p>Farkas said it’s crucial for councillors to ensure essential services, like police and fire, have adequate resources before the city moves on to the services that are “nice to have.”</p>
      <p>This week, he will be advocating that council reallocate funds from other areas of the budget, such as arts funding, to avoid the potential <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/2020-budget-city-tax-scenarios-include-cuts-to-police-and-fire-loss-of-236-workers">$8.45-million cut to police services</a> that would come with a zero per cent tax increase.</p>
      <p>He will be looking at reversing the nearly-doubled Calgary Arts Development Authority’s base operating budget that saw an increase from $6.4 million to $11.4 million last year.</p>
      <p>However, Carra said that eroding Calgary’s social fabric by making sweeping cuts will continue to hurt an already struggling city.</p>
      <p>“I am extremely horrified by, and off put by, these ideological missions to cut everything. It’s just based on faulty logic, faulty assumptions and I’m really heartsick going into this budget,” said Carra.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Coun. Shane Keating said while he doesn’t necessarily agree with Farkas’ proposal, it’s worth discussing.</p>
      <p>“All options have to be investigated,” said Keating. “When you’re talking cuts, everything is a surprise. Where it is, what department, what area — we have to look at a number of things.”</p>
      <p>He said council should begin discussions at the zero-per-cent tax increase, which he describes as a reduction in light of inflation and the growth of the city. What Keating hopes to determine this week is what specific programs, rather than across-the-board services, can be cut to find savings.</p>
      <p>“Rather than trying to nickel and dime percentages across the board, let’s find one or two programs,” he said.</p>
      <p>All councillors agreed that however budget negotiations play out, council has a responsibly to protect Calgary’s most vulnerable.</p>
