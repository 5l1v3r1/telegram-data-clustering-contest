      <p>In a late night development on Sunday, MLAs of the NCP were shifted from a suburban resort to another hotel in Mumbai, sources said.</p>
      <p>The MLAs travelled in a bus to a different hotel from Hotel Renaissance in Powai where they were put up since Saturday night, hours after NCP leader Ajit Pawar joined hands with the BJP in a coup and took oath as deputy chief minister.</p>
      <p>In a dramatic turn of events, Devendra Fadnavis had returned as chief minister for a second term.</p>
      <p>The exact number of the MLAs currently with the NCP could not be confirmed. The party had won 54 seats in the 288 -member House in the assembly elections.</p>
      <p>It is also learnt that MLAs of the Shiv Sena, who are staying at Lalit Hotel near the Mumbai airport, will also be moved to another hotel.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, independent MLA Ravi Rana, who has extended his support to the BJP, claimed the Shiv Sena will witness a "big earthquake" soon.</p>
      <p>He claimed that Fadnavis will get the support of 175 MLAs.</p>
