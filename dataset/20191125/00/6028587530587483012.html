      <p>Rey Mysterio is the latest name to be added to the list of WWE superstars who’ve been dismantled by Brock Lesnar as WWE’s ultimate underdog failed to slay “The Beast” at Survivor Series.The finish to their match–which ended with an F5 from Lesnar after Rey’s son Dominick unsuccessfully attempted to help his father win the match–left the door open for a potential rematch down the road, but despite speculation that the creative team might actually put the WWE title on Mysterio in an attempt <a href="https://www.ringsidenews.com/2019/06/20/rey-mysterio-discussing-new-wwe-contract/">to get him to re-sign with the company</a>, WWE did what it typically tends to do: Have Lesnar be so dominant that it’s almost impossible to build up formidable foes for him.</p>
      <p>Especially after Lesnar dismantled Cain Velasquez in just a couple of minutes last month at Crown Jewel, WWE is running into the same problem with Lesnar that has plagued the creative team for so long and made it incredibly difficult to create compelling feuds for the man who is supposed to be <a href="https://www.ringsidenews.com/2018/05/08/wwe-keeps-brock-lesnar-around/">WWE’s biggest draw</a>. Lesnar beat Velasquez so quickly at Crown Jewel because Velasquez is injured and <a href="https://www.wrestlinginc.com/news/2019/11/backstage-news-on-brock-lesnar-vs-cain-velasquez-going-661559/">may be undergoing surgery soon</a>, but it’s likely that bout was also kept so short because it created the perception that Velasquez “wasn’t ready” for Lesnar but will be the next time they cross paths, which would be the “rubber match” between the two stars after Velasquez beat Lesnar in UFC nearly a decade ago.</p>
      <p>But after the way Velasquez was easily disposed of in Saudi Arabia, the man who was capable of becoming perhaps WWE’s most legitimate opponent for “The Beast” sure doesn’t seem that way anymore. Prior to that bout even happening, WWE had <a href="https://www.wrestlinginc.com/news/2019/11/backstage-news-on-brock-lesnar-vs-cain-velasquez-going-661559/">considered doing Lesnar vs. Tyson Fury</a> in what would have both been a blockbuster bout and demonstrated exactly what is wrong with the way WWE pushes its stars. Especially with names like Roman Reigns, Daniel Bryan and Braun Strowman now on SmackDown, there are very few stars on Raw who appear to be on Lesnar’s level, and the ones who are have already crossed paths with him in the past. That list would include AJ Styles (who, as a heel, doesn’t figure to be an opponent for Lesnar anytime soon anyway) and Seth Rollins–and it goes without saying that WWE definitely doesn’t need to revisit that lackluster rivalry again.</p>
      <p>So, who might some other options for Lesnar be? Well, there are plenty, but there are drawbacks to all of them.</p>
      <p>As far as star power is concerned, Lesnar vs. Randy Orton would seemingly be a viable option until you remember <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/wwe/story/wwe-randy-orton-brock-lesnar-summerslam-blood-stitches-reaction-pissed-off-120916">the way that their controversial 2016 bout went down</a>, when Orton was busted open by Lesnar in one of the most lopsided and shocking main event caliber matches in WWE history. Perhaps WWE could choose to revisit that feud as rumblings remain about a <a href="https://www.ringsidenews.com/2019/10/12/randy-orton-could-be-turning-babyface-with-move-to-wwe-raw/">potential babyface turn for the wildly popular Orton</a>, but that–like many other Lesnar match possibilities–would be a classic case “of been there, seen that.” As a result, WWE would have to reach deep down into its bag of tricks to find a match that would be good from an in-ring perspective, that could tell a great story and would actually pair Lesnar with someone who fans would take seriously as his opponent.</p>
      <p>Names who would at least come close to Lesnar physically include Drew McIntyre, Bobby Lashley and Rusev, but none of those stars are pushed anywhere close to Lesnar’s level creatively speaking. WWE has had multiple chances with McIntyre, who has had <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/wwe/from-the-wwe-rumor-mill-vince-mcmahon-triple-h-heavily-involved-with-drew-mcintyre-on-raw">two big supporters in Triple H and Vince McMahon</a>, but it has dropped the ball with “The Scottish Psychopath” what seems like countless times over the past couple of years. Rusev and Lashley, meanwhile, have settled into an over-the-top romantic angle that isn’t doing either star any favors in terms of truly elevating them up the card. So, now we’re down to Raw’s rising babyfaces, with three fan favorites in particular coming to mind: Ricochet, Aleister Black and Kevin Owens.</p>
      <p>Of the three, Black–who, like Lesnar, <a href="https://whatculture.com/wwe/paul-heyman-high-on-aleister-black-buddy-murphy-in-wwe">is a “Paul Heyman” guy</a> with a ton of support from the Raw Executive Director–would probably make the most believable foe for Lesnar. Although the former NXT Champion hasn’t been featured prominently in storylines since joining the main roster, he also has been protected on the occasions when he is featured, and as a devastating striker, would likely put on a stellar match with “The Beast.” But despite Heyman being a fan of Black, there haven’t been any real signs of WWE pushing Black to the next level as the talented in-ring performer has been left without much to do since being called up to the main roster earlier this year.</p>
      <p>That would whittle things down to Ricochet and Owens, both of which would make fine opponents for Lesnar if the booking was on point. As is the case with Black, <a href="https://www.cagesideseats.com/2019/7/4/20681942/rumor-roundup-wwe-backstage-reaction-heyman-bischoff-hires-triple-h-snub-ricochet-push">Ricochet reportedly has a big supporter in Heyman</a>, who views Ricochet as a potentially huge draw among teen fans. Thus far, Ricochet has demonstrated both in <a href="https://www.wrestlinginc.com/news/2018/07/ricochet-could-be-significantly-helping-nxt-live-show-644288/">NXT</a> and on <a href="https://www.ringsidenews.com/2019/10/29/why-wwe-ran-ricochet-vs-drew-mcintyre-again-on-raw-this-week/">Raw</a> that he can indeed be a major viewership draw, which is probably a testament to his unparalleled in-ring skills because he hasn’t always been booked all that well on Raw, at least not consistently. There could be a solid story to be told with the smaller, high-flying Ricochet working to overcome a huge obstacle in the unstoppable Lesnar. Likewise, Owens–<a href="https://www.bodyslam.net/2019/07/11/report-wwe-plans-to-make-kevin-owens-into-steve-austin-like-babyface/">WWE’s modern day version of the ultimate anti-hero</a> “Stone Cold” Steve Austin–would make for a very compelling opponent for Lesnar, but credible? Not necessarily, especially given the up-and-down booking of his character over the years, whether heel or face.</p>
      <p>Thus, it’s expected that Lesnar may briefly continue his feud with Mysterio before turning to a new opponent in time for Royal Rumble and WrestleMania season. Who his next opponent will be, however, is anyone’s guess.</p>
      <p>Because unless WWE really straps the proverbial rocket to someone, we’re probably headed toward another lengthy Lesnar world title reign that lacks intrigue because, well, it lacks equivalents to “The Beast.”</p>
