      <p>President Muhammadu Buhari has said that he will not accept underperformance from any All Progressives Congress governor following the performance of the party during the 2019 general elections.</p>
      <p>According to Buhari, governors must channel resources and come up with initiatives that will benefit Nigerians.</p>
      <p>Buhari, who spoke through Secretary to Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, gave the submission on Monday in Jos, Plateau State, during the Federal Government/Progressives Governors Forum’s summit.</p>
      <p>He said, “Early in 2019, Nigerians overwhelmingly re-elected me as President. That election was a referendum on not just my leadership but also on our party.</p>
      <p>“Some state governors were re-elected while new ones also came on board.</p>
      <p>“To whom much is given, much more is expected. It is therefore incumbent on this to meet the expectations of our teeming population.</p>
      <p>“There should be no room for excuses and that is where the outcome of this parley becomes very critical.”</p>
