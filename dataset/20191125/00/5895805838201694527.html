      <p>Problematic relatives are painful, especially during the holiday season when <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/stress">stress</a> is at an all-time high. Don’t allow them to sabotage holiday peace and <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/happiness">happiness</a>. Six tips may help keep the holiday drama at bay.</p>
      <p>1. Instead of hoping that they behave, expect that they won’t and have a plan.</p>
      <p>Psychologically, this moves a person from <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/anxiety">anxious</a> anticipation to a stance which allows him or her to strategically plan and prepare for a negative situation in advance.</p>
      <p>2. Ignore <a href="https://www.inc.com/amy-morin/5-best-ways-to-respond-to-backhanded-compliments.html">backhanded comments</a>.</p>
      <p>For example, say aunt Sally asks how work is going. Her niece says, “Great, I just got a promotion!” Aunt Sally replies, I’ve seen your company in the news. The stock is dropping. I hope you still have a job on Monday,” and walks away.</p>
      <p>Or</p>
      <p>Uncle Lenny says, “What’s wrong with Billy? He cries a lot for a 4-year-old,” after watching Billy trip over the dog, landing chin first on the tile floor.</p>
      <p>Regarding a backhanded statement, ignore. A backhanded comment usually embodies an element of the truth which gives it some merit, but the comment is largely a distortion. A profoundly insecure person often distorts information in order to make reality more palpable for his or her ego. Often, these distortions are unconsciously employed. The relative may unconsciously ward off deep insecurities by making someone else feel insecure.</p>
      <p>For example, Perhaps Billy is four, but he is tough and does not cry unless he is badly hurt. Also, it may be true that a person’s company had an expected dip in stock, but it is due to a typical and expected seasonal drop in sales. Often, the goal of a person who makes backhanded comments is to get a rise out of the other person, so if the statement is ignored, it does not garner the desired effect.</p>
      <p>3. Give Yourself permission to diplomatically excuse yourself from a conversation that is escalating and becoming inappropriate.</p>
      <p>Examples include,</p>
      <p>“This may not be the best time to discuss this topic. Why don’t we chat about it later?”</p>
      <p>“I’m so sorry. I have to check on the kids.”</p>
      <p>“This discussion does not seem productive. Let’s talk about it another time.”</p>
      <p>“I forgot a present in the car. I’ll be right back.”</p>
      <p>A person has no obligation to subject himself or herself to toxicity. If an interaction <a href="https://psychcentral.com/blog/whats-a-toxic-person-how-do-you-deal-with-one/">feels toxic</a>, it probably is, so gracefully escape and save your joy.</p>
      <p>4. Stick with the <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/peaceful-parenting/201910/how-help-your-child-when-co-parent-is-narcissistic">process and not the content</a></p>
      <p>Often a problematic relative will not allow you to leave the discussion. For example, maybe Uncle Rick starts a political discussion at the dinner table right when dinner is served or Cousin Bob traps you in the corner of the kitchen and is holding your cocktail hostage. At these times, it may be necessary to call a spade a spade and highlight the process. Do not engage in the content.</p>
      <p>For example, say Uncle Rick launches a political rant during dinner, attacking and degrading members of the opposite political party. A person may try and avoid engaging in the content by defending the party and articulating several reasons why Uncle Rick is wrong. This approach fuels Uncle Rick’s fire and will most likely fall on Rick’s “deaf” ears, escalating the conflict. The more effective approach is to stick with the process by stating, “Uncle Rick, it is not polite to call names. It’s also unrealistic to believe everyone at this table shares your political beliefs. Try to be respectful.” Uncle Rick may continue to attempt to pull you into the discussion, by stating, “Awe! You people are all alike. Scared to discuss the truth!” Despite the continued<a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/here-there-and-everywhere/201701/11-warning-signs-gaslighting"> gas lightin</a>g, a person should try stick with the process by stating, “Uncle Rick, please, this discussion is not productive.”</p>
      <p>5. Remain calm and appear indifferent, even when upset on the inside.</p>
      <p>Often the goal of a problematic relative is to evoke emotion, so <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/gaslighting">gaslighting</a>, backhanded comments, and unfair accusations abound. The trick is to appear calm and indifferent. When the problematic relative can’t “push buttons” he or she isn’t able to manipulate the situation and frame another person as the “bad guy.”</p>
      <p>6. Take the test.</p>
      <p>Frequently toxic comments are confusing. For example, “Your purse is so cute! How did you afford it on your salary?” The statement is not overtly degrading, but it has an insulting element. For example, the statement starts out as a complement, but ends as a put down. Because of the perplexing undertones, this comment stings and may swim in a person’s head for days. In order to decipher whether a comment is toxic, take the test. The test is simply asking yourself, “would I ever say that to someone else?” If the answer is “no” then the comment may be toxic, and the relative is someone to be wary of.</p>
      <p>Stay calm, stick with the process, ignore distortions, take the test, and remain joyful!</p>
