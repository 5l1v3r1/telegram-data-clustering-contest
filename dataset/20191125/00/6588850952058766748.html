      <p>The National Chief Imam, Sheikh Osman Nuhu Sharubutu, has described Vice President Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia as a selfless man who lives for others.<br/><br/>Delivering a sermon on Saturday night during the commemoration of the birth of Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W.) at New Fadama in Accra, Sheikh Sharubutu said Dr. Bawumia has demonstrated true traits of selflessness in the manner the Vice President responds to the calls of the needy and communities, in both official and private capacities.<br/><br/>During the program, a touching testimony was made of how Dr. Bawumiah swiftly supported an ailing Islamic Cleric with US $40,000 when the Cleric required US $36,000 for an urgent treatment abroad.<br/><br/>Addressing the gathering, Sheikh Sharubutu said he was personally aware of Dr. Bawumia’s generosity, and likened the Vice President to one of the geeatest attributes of Prophet Muhammed – selflessness.<br/><br/>“The Vice President is a selfless man who lives for others,” said Sheikh Sharubutu. “Selfless people live for others and what Dr. Bawumia does is to live for others. That’s what Prophet Muhammad S.A.W did. The Prophet was selfless and he lived his life for the benefit of others.”<br/><br/>Impressed by Dr. Bawumia’s announcement of several ongoing and new infrastructure development projects in many inner cities and Zongo communities, Sheikh Sharubutu made reference to how the Prophet always fought and prayed for his people, to underline Dr. Bawumia’s selflessness.<br/><br/>“The Prophet didn’t live for himself alone so he never prayed for himself alone, unlike other Prophets. He was selfless so always interceded on behalf of his people. So for Prophet Muhammad, it was always “my people, my people”.<br/><br/>Sheikh Sharubutu thanked the Vice President for his selflessness and generosity, and also prayed for Allah to continue to strengthen the Vice President so he can do more for people and the nation.<br/>Dr. Bawumia also expressed his sincere gratitude to the National Chief Imam for his guidance and prayers.
