      <h1>Porn Stars: Instagram Keeps Deleting Our Accounts for No Reason</h1>

      <h3>Double Standard</h3>
      <p>Porn stars and sex workers say that Instagram keeps deleting their accounts — even when their posts don’t violate the site’s content standards, according to a new <i>BBC News</i> <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-50222380">story</a>.</p>
      <p>“They discriminate against us because they don’t like what we do for a living,” Alana Evans, president of the Adult Performers Actors Guild, told <i>BBC News</i> of Instagram’s content moderators.</p>
      <h3>Out of Income</h3>
      <p>Performers who spoke to <i>BBC News</i> said it appears that an individual or group of individuals started reporting the profiles in late-2018 in the hopes of having them removed.</p>
      <p>And it seems to be working — the Adult Performers Actors Guild now has a <a href="http://apagunion.com/social-media-discrimination/instagram-discrimination/">list</a> of more than 1,300 performers who say Instagram deleted their accounts despite a lack of rule violations.</p>
      <p>“The people reporting us don’t understand that people’s incomes are affected, or they don’t care,” Ginger Banks, an adult performer and sex workers’ rights activist, told <i>BBC News</i>. “They think that we shouldn’t be doing this job or it shouldn’t exist.”</p>
      <h3>Judgy McJudgerson</h3>
      <p>That’s not just speculation on Banks’ part, either. Many of the performers said the reporting of their account was often followed by abusive messages deriding them for their choice of profession.</p>
      <p>“[Y]our IG account was deleted due to your porn activities,” Omid, an <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/christian-app-narcs-mom-watch-porn-ai">anti-porn</a> campaigner, <a href="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/A262/production/_109807514_omid-nc.png">wrote to adult performer</a> Lacey Jane on Twitter. “[L]eave porn and live a better and more respectful life than today.”</p>
