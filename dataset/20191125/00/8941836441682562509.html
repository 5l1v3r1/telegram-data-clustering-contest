      <p>ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - An intruder didn’t count on an 82-year-old woman living alone being an award-winning bodybuilder with nerves of steel.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/willie-murphy/">Willie Murphy</a> was getting ready for bed Thursday at her home in Rochester, New York, when a man pounded on the door and said he needed an ambulance, Murphy told WHAM.</p>
      <p>She called police but wouldn’t open the door. Then, she said, the man broke in and skulked through the dark house.</p>
      <p>“He picked the wrong house to break into,” Murphy said.</p>
      <p>She clobbered him with a table, poured shampoo in his face and was beating him with a broom when police arrived.</p>

      <p>“I was whaling on that man,” Murphy told the Democrat and Chronicle. “’Cause I said to myself, ‘If it’s my time to go to hell, I’m taking him with me!’”</p>
      <p>The man got his ambulance ride, after all. He was sent to a hospital, and police tweeted a selfie with Murphy, calling her “tough as nails.”</p>
      <p>Murphy works out almost daily at Rochester’s Maplewood YMCA and said she can deadlift 225 pounds - more than twice her weight. She can do one-handed pullups and one-handed pushups.</p>
      <p>She won the World Natural Powerlifting Federation Lifter of the Year award in 2014.</p>

        <p>“She really helps dispel the myths of aging,” said Michelle LeBoo, a program coordinator at the Maplewood YMCA.</p>
        <p>Murphy is “a strong, beautiful woman” who does things “for the benefit of others,” LeBoo said.</p>
        <p>Murphy said she hopes her story inspires people of all ages.</p>
