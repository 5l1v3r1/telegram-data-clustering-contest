      <h1>David Moyes a 'Strong Contender' to Return to Everton as Marco Silva Faces Sack This Week</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.90min.com/users/1719980" target="_blank">Jamie Spencer</a></address>
      <p>​Everton could replace under pressure manager Marco Silva before the Toffees play their next Premier League game against Leicester on Sunday 1 December. Bournemouth’s Eddie Howe is linked, while ex-boss David Moyes is rumoured to be a ‘strong contender’.</p>
      <p>Saturday’s home defeat by Norwich was Everton’s seventh in the Premier League already this season and leaves the club only four points above the relegation zone, despite more heavy spending in the transfer market during the summer.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11671/11869879/everton-consider-replacing-marco-silva-with-david-moyes-or-eddie-howe">Sky Sports</a> claims that <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/everton">Everton</a> are ‘considering’ dispensing with the Portuguese, who has also managed Hull and Watford in the top flight, before they travel to the King Power Stadium for the next round of fixtures.</p>
      <p>Silva is currently favourite with bookmakers to be the next Premier League manager to lose his job. He would be the third to be shown the door since the start of the season, with Javi Gracia dismissed by Watford in September and Mauricio Pochettino leaving <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/tottenham">Tottenham</a> last week.</p>
      <p>Sky’s suggestion is that Moyes could return to Merseyside initially on a short-term contract until the end of the season, six years after he left the club to replace Sir Alex Ferguson at <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/manchester-united">Manchester United</a>.</p>

      <p>During a lengthy tenure, Moyes famously steered Everton to a number of impressive Premier League finishes, including back-to-back fifth place between 2007 and 2009, as well as fourth in 2004/05. His Everton side also reached the 2009 FA Cup final.</p>
      <p>The Scot has never enjoyed that level of consistent success anywhere since, with spells at Manchester United, Real Sociedad, Sunderland and <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/west-ham">West Ham</a> all coming to an end relatively quickly. He has not worked in management since leaving West Ham in May 2018.</p>
      <p>Howe is also a potential target named by Sky’s report. The 41-year-old has overseen a generally positive start to the season by Bournemouth and is said to be ‘still favoured by some members of the Everton board’. This was after Everton initially tried to land him back in 2016.</p>

      <p>After facing a Leicester side that has won five Premier League games in a row, Everton must also face Liverpool, Chelsea, Manchester United and Arsenal before Christmas, as well as Leicester a second time in the Carabao Cup quarter finals.</p>
