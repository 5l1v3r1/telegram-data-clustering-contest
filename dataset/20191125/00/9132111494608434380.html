      <p>The regulator of legal education in Ghana has described a suit brought against it by aggrieved law students as lacking merit and has proceeded to ask the High Court to dismiss it.</p>
      <p>The General Legal Council rejects the claim it violated the fundamental human rights of the students in disallowing a remark of their papers.</p>
      <p>The applicants, LLB holders, sat for the entrance examination into the Ghana School of Law for the Professional Law Course in 2019.</p>
      <p>They were, however, made to sign an undertaking not to challenge the results, a practice, the Legal Council says is conventional.</p>
      <p>The students had asked the court to declare the undertaking not to challenge the results as arbitrary but the GLC denies this is the case.</p>
      <p>The General Legal Council argues it takes all the scripts through a two-stage marking, signifying sanctity of the published results.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, critics remain unconvinced with the position of the General Legal Council.</p>
      <p>US-based Ghanaian lawyer and Professor, Kwaku Asare, who is a fierce critic of the Ghanaian Legal system has blamed the regulators for the consistent mass failures at the law school.</p>
      <p>In 2019, only 128 out of 1,820 LLB holders who sat for the entrance exam into the professional law course passed.</p>
      <p>Critics have described the system as tyrannical.</p>
      <p>But the regulators blame the students for the consistent mass failures at both entrance exams and the Bar exams.</p>
      <p>The outgoing Chief Justice, Sophia Akuffo, who is the Chairperson of the Council, is on record to have said she would not superintend the mass production of lawyers.</p>
      <p>Her critics, however, point out her position is warped, since mass production does not equal lowering standards.</p>
      <p>A demonstration by Law Students Association to protest the mass failures ended abruptly when police descended on them, shooting rubber bullets and spraying them with water from their cannons.</p>
      <p>The police received widespread backlash and their explanations received outright rejection.</p>
