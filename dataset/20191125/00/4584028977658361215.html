      <p>N'Golo Kante says he rebuffed interest from Paris Saint-Germain because he is happy at Chelsea.</p>
      <p>Ligue 1 champions PSG have long been linked withÂ the France international and reportedly tried to sign him following his impressive displays at the 2018 World Cup.</p>
      <p>The move never materialised and Kante, considered one of the Premier League's best midfielders, is now in his fourth season at Stamford Bridge.</p>
      <p>He signed a new five-year contract with the club in November 2018 and has no plans to leave.</p>
      <p>"Sometimes you don't really know where you want to go, but you know what you already have," Kante told Canal+ when asked about PSG's interest.</p>
      <p>"I knew I was at Chelsea and I felt good at Chelsea. On top of that, it was a footballing decision.</p>
      <p>"I felt good in London and I felt happy in this project and therefore I am happy to stay here."</p>
      <p>Kante joined Chelsea in 2016 following a season with Leicester City, where he won the first of his two Premier League titles.</p>
      <p>The 28-year-old scored for the third time this season in the Blues' 2-1 defeat to Manchester City on Saturday.</p>
