      <h1>Boeing 737 MAX 10 makes a quiet debut</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Sanchita Nambiar</a></address>
      <p>Boeing 737 MAX 10’s debut was a rather low-key affair. The launch was in the presence of employees only at the company’s Renton, Washington factory.</p>
      <p>Commenting on this launch, Mark Jenks, vice president and general manager of the 737 programme said, “Today is not just about a new airplane. It’s about the people who design, build and support it. This team’s relentless focus on safety and quality shows the commitment we have to our airline customers and every person who flies on a Boeing airplane.”</p>
      <p>The 737 MAX 10 is the largest variant of the MAX family, can seat up to 230 passengers and boasts the lowest seat-mile cost of any single-aisle airplane ever produced.</p>
      <p>The airplane will soon undergo system checks and engine runs prior to its first flight next year, which still seems like a dubious matter.

      <p>On the other hand, an official release by Boeing states that the 737 MAX 10 currently has more than 550 orders and commitments from more than 20 customers around the globe. <a href="https://www.boeing.com/"><b>boeing.com</b></a></p>
