      <h1>Giants can find hope from Jets during these grim times</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:26:51+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 00:26</time> by <a rel="author">Mike Vaccaro</a></address>
      <p>This is one of those games, one of those weeks, when you need to take a deep breath before you say or think or write anything that, in the moment, feels 100 percent the right thing to say, or think, or write. This is one of those games — one of those weeks — when your first instinct, your primal urge, to start lining Giants up against a wall, and point at them.</p>
      <p><i>“You’re fired!”</i> you shout at one.</p>
      <p><i>“You’re benched!”</i> you scream at another.</p>
      <p><i>“You’re cut!”</i> you sneer at the next guy.</p>
      <p><i>“You’re awful … and you’re ugly, too!”</i> you wail at a few others.</p>
      <p>On and on. Jets fans know the feeling. The Jets went and lost to the winless Dolphins three weeks ago, falling to 1-8 on the year, and people didn’t just want Adam Gase fired, they wanted him drawn and quartered. They put their No. 14 Sam Darnold jerseys in mothballs (because lighting them on fire, let’s face it, could be construed as a little nuts).</p>
      <p>Knicks fans know the feeling. Every other home game, they settle into their seats at the Garden, order up a frankfurter and a beer, then look up at the scoreboard to see that the good guys are already losing 24-6 to somebody. All the awfulness can get to you, and the mere act of uttering the word, “Boooo!” doesn’t often get the job done or the point across.</p>

      <p>So they light their blowtorches. They clear their throats. They call around, getting prices on airplanes to deliver their messages around town. Sports, man. It can get the best of you sometimes.</p>
      <p>And so it is with Giants fans after one more non-competitive, non-representative eyesore of a football game, <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/24/giants-sink-to-familiar-dark-place-in-loss-to-bears/">a 19-14 loss to the Bears</a> at Chicago’s Soldier Field that, in its own way, was every bit as dyspeptic and disagreeable for Giants fans to watch as <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/03/embarrassing-jets-hit-rock-bottom-with-loss-to-tanking-dolphins/">that Jets-Dolphins fiasco in Miami</a> was earlier in the month for the green among us.</p>
      <p>The Dolphins, zombified Jets fans kept muttering to themselves, “Are trying to lose every game. They were trying to lose this one. And we wouldn’t let ‘em.”</p>
      <p>The Bears? They’d devolved into a national punch line in recent weeks. They may not be actively trying to lose but they’ve become proficient at it anyway, and a week ago on “Sunday Night Football” became something of a soap opera, too, with their alleged franchise quarterback, Mitchell Trubisky, going into a full-blown meltdown.</p>
      <p>And the Giants lost to them, anyway.</p>
      <p>“We kept fighting, but there are no prizes for that,” beleaguered Giants coach Pat Shurmur said when this latest mud puddle was done. “You have to do what you can do to win the game.”</p>
      <p>And, see, THAT’S the most troubling part. If there were signs — even hints — that this wasn’t simply who the Giants are — and, worse, what they seem doomed to be for more than a little while longer — then you can almost plan a pathway through this darkness. At the darkest nadir for the Jets, in Miami, there was always the hope — desperate, even delusional as it may have seemed at the time — Darnold could maximize the rest of his sophomore year, that Jamal Adams could do something to justify his own high self-grading system.</p>
      <p>Nobody is declaring the Jets fixed now but Darnold HAS played better, Adams HAS had three straight freakish weeks in a row, <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/24/jets-completely-dominate-raiders-for-third-straight-win/">the Jets DO have a three-game winning streak</a>, and if Gase still isn’t likely to be high on the list of things Jets fans will be thankful for this week, there is at least a seductive glimmer of hope.</p>
      <p>Where is the hope with the Giants?</p>
      <p>The franchise quarterback lost another fumble — AGAIN! — that led to a Bears touchdown. The franchise running back had another pedestrian 17-carry, 59-yard day that was rescued from total oblivion by a late 22-yard escape after he’d been bottled and throttled all day. The defense allowed Trubisky — dead quarterback walking, remember — to carve it up for 278 yards, despite moments when it looked like he’d have difficulty completing an undefended pass from the GW Bridge to the Hudson River.</p>
      <p>“We just have to keep battling, keep fighting,” Shurmur said, and every time he leans on that old reliable chestnut he sounds more and more like Rich Kotite did, in 1996, when “We played hard” became a weekly companion piece to another 35-13 loss.</p>
      <p>Yes, it would be so easy to line all those Giants up against the wall and fire them all, release them all, take away their meal money. It solves nothing. There are five games left in the season. They have to do what the Jets have done. They need to show proof that something here, anything, is salvageable going forward. Firing the bums feels good in the moment.</p>
      <p>In the morning, it only reinforces what you already know. Stuff has to get better. Somehow. Some way. In some year. Starting with some of the bums already on the roster.</p>
