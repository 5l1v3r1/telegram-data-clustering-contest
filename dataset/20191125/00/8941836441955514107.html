      <p>FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. (AP) - Native American tribes in northern Arizona overwhelmingly oppose proposals to dam the Little Colorado River for hydropower.</p>
      <p>Phoenix-based <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/pumped-hydro-storage-company/">Pumped Hydro Storage company</a> is seeking preliminary permits from the federal government to study the sites east of Grand Canyon National Park.</p>
      <p>Company manager Steve Irwin has touted the potential economic benefits, including paved roads, tourism and jobs.</p>
      <p>The Navajo Nation owns the land and the projects won’t move forward without the tribe’s OK.</p>
      <p>The tribe wrote in comments posted online Monday that the projects could negatively impact the tribe’s land, water, wildlife and cultural resources.</p>

      <p>The Navajo community closest to the proposed projects already has asked the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/federal-energy-regulatory-commission/">Federal Energy Regulatory Commission</a> to deny the permits.</p>
