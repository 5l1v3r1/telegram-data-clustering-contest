      <p>A bus driver who was hit in the face with human faeces in a disgusting attack in Melbourne’s north remains too shaken to return to work.</p>
      <p>The driver was stopped on Harvest Home Road in Wollert at about 9.40pm on November 13 when a man approached his door and threw a bag of human faeces at him.</p>
      <p>The excrement struck the driver in the face and covered his jacket.</p>
      <p>No passengers were hit by the flying faeces.</p>
      <p>The offender fled after the filthy attack, and police are calling on the public to help find him.</p>
      <p>The attacker was perceived to be Caucasian, aged in his 30s or 40s, of medium height and build, and had a fair complexion.</p>
      <p>At the time of the attack he was wearing a beige beanie, a yellow and black hi-vis jumper with the hood up, and dark pants with a white stripe.</p>
      <p>Investigators have released images of the man in the hope someone may be able to identify him.</p>
      <p>Anyone with information on the incident or knows the identity of the man is urged to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 or submit a confidential crime report at <a href="http://www.crimestoppersvic.com.au/">www.crimestoppersvic.com.au</a></p>
