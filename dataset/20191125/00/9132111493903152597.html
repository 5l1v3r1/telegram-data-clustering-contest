      <p>The National Democratic Congress (NDC), has called on the president, to with immediate effect, order the arrest of the Senior Minster, Yaw Osafo Maafo for breaching the Procurement Act.</p>
      <p>At a news conference in Accra, Monday, the General Secretary of the party, Johnson Asiedu Nketia, said the President should do this to demonstrate that no one is above the law when it comes to the fight against corruption.</p>
      <p>According to him, the attempt to remove the the Auditor General is a deliberate move by the government to cover up the rot and the looting of public funds by the Akufo-Addo-led government.</p>
      <p>He questioned why EOCO will invite the Auditor General, Yaw Domelovo, for questioning and granting him bail but failed to invite Mr Yaw Osafo Maafo for alleged procurement breaches.</p>
      <p>The General Secretary also charged anti graft organizations in the country to rise up and call the government to order for the attempt to remove the Auditor General. He suspects Mr. Domelovo being chased out of office because of his strict stance against corruption irrespective of who is involved.</p>
