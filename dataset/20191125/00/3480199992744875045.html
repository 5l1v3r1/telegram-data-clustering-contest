      <p>Gemma Collins and an “all-consuming silence” are among the highlights of this year’s BBC Christmas line-up.</p>
      <p>The broadcaster has unveiled its offerings for BBC Radio and Sounds.</p>
      <p>The Gemma Collins Podcast “will delve into exactly how the GC gets festive”.</p>
      <p>She will “treat”  listeners “to some Christmas classics, performed by the reality TV star and backed by a Christmassy choir”, on BBC Sounds.</p>
      <p>On BBC Radio 3, a Slow Radio walk will take place from the west coast of Greenland.</p>

      <p>Author Horatio Clare experiences “the silence and brutal force of the elements,” over three programmes, bringing to life “Greenland’s dramatic colours, stunning wildlife and vast skies” in Greenland: An Arctic Sound Walk.</p>
      <p>“With specialist sound recording, we pick out the beating of ravens wings, the crackle of frozen streams, the screaming winds and the sudden all-consuming silence when everything stands still,” the BBC said.</p>
      <p>Music captures the “light, the colours and the ever-changing atmospheres of the journey” in the programme, which begins on Christmas Eve and also looks at the country’s history,  culture and future.</p>

      <p>Sober Christmas, a Christmas episode of BBC Radio 5 Live podcast Hooked, will discuss the “coping mechanisms, funny stories and difficulties of how to get through the festive period when so much of the social aspect is centred around having a drink.”</p>
      <p>James Purnell, BBC director of radio and education, said: “Across BBC Radio and Sounds, we’ll be celebrating the festive season with world class storytelling, some of the biggest stars of the year and music to suit every mood.</p>
      <p>“There’s something for everyone in our line-up, and whether people listen live on-air or binge our great audio on-demand, I hope they come to BBC Radio this Christmas to discover and enjoy the best audio there is.”</p>
