      <p>Future Award winner, <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/25/burna-boy-wins-2019-young-person-of-the-year-future-award/"><u><b>Burna Boy,</b></u></a> has unfollowed everyone on Instagram, leaving only his girlfriend, Stefflon Don.</p>
      <p>The self-acclaimed ‘African Giant’ may just be proving that he is indeed the king and need not follow anyone.</p>
      <p>Burna Boy, who is unbelievably controversial, may just be attracting a lot of backlash because of his actions.</p>
      <p>With a follower base amounting to 4.6M, Burna Boy has joined the train of the few artists who are following no one.</p>
      <p>See His Instagram page link bellow<a href="https://www.instagram.com/burnaboygram/"><u>https://www.instagram.com/burnaboygram/</u></a></p>
      <p>With time, we shall know his reason behind this, however, fingers crossed as to how Nigerians will react to this.</p>
