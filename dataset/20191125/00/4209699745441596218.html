      <p>National Chairman of All Progressives Congress, Adams Oshiomhole, has called on governors on the party’s platform to implement the N30,000 minimum wage and the consequential adjustments. </p>
      <p>Oshiomhole made the plea on Monday in Jos at the Federal Government-Progressives Governors Forum parley in Jos, according to the News Agency of Nigeria. </p>
      <p>He said, “As progressives, let us be the first to pay the new national minimum wage and not just the wage but also the consequential adjustments arising from it.</p>
      <p>"Already, there are some proactive progressive governors that have taken steps to address this.</p>
      <p>“I plead that you give this a priority because when other governors are fighting whether or not to pay, you will say that progressive governors have paid.</p>
      <p>“Where there is will, there will certainly be a way.”</p>
