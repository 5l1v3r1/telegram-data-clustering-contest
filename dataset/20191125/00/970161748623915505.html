        <b><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/dua-lipa/">Dua Lipa</a> and Anwar Hadid were in a passionate and playful mood at the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/american-music-awards/">American Music Awards</a> earlier, passionately kissing as they made their red carpet debut.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ahead of her performance at the awards show tonight, Dua, 24, strolled into the Microsoft Theatre in Los Angeles walking hand-in-hand with Anwar, 20, and they had no problem in ramping up their affection for one another in front of cameras.</p>
      <p>The smitten couple walked into the venue holding hands and could barely wipe the smiles from their faces, before putting on quite a show on the red carpet.</p>
      <p>At one point, Dua cradled Anwar’s face while saying something funny before they puckered up and shared a passionate kiss – giving the photographers the money shot.</p>
      <p>The pair then walked off together laughing and joking, giving us all the feels.</p>
      <p>Dua and Anwar are believed to have started dating in June but, despite being spotted out and about together, only made their <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/03/dua-lipa-boyfriend-anwar-hadid-look-cosy-awkward-start-mtv-emas-11036161/">official public debut at the European Music Awards</a> earlier this month.</p>

      <p>Anwar, younger brother of Gigi and Bella Hadid, played the supportive boyfriend as he sat in the audience as Dua performed her new single Don’t Start Now.</p>

      <p>Sharing an insight into their romance, a source previously told The Sun: ‘Dua and Anwar are spending all of their time together so it just made sense for them to rent this place. She’s always at his when she’s in LA and he stays with her in London so this felt like the natural step.</p>
      <p>‘Once she comes back with new music she will spend more time in New York so it’s good for her to have a base there and it makes sense to him because a lot of his family live there.’</p>

Performances are expected from the likes of Taylor Swift, Billie Eilish, The Jonas Brothers, Camila Cabello and Kesha.</p>
