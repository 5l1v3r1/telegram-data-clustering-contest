      <h1>Australia's Afterpay shares leap after audit finds 'low risk' of money-laundering</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>(Reuters) - Australian buy-now-pay-later company Afterpay Touch Group Ltd (AX:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/afterpay-holdings-ltd">APT</a>) on Monday said an external auditor had found it was a "low-risk business" in terms of money laundering and terrorism financing, sending its shares up more than 9%.</p>
      <p>Australia's financial crime watchdog ordered the company to conduct the independent audit earlier this year amid concerns over non-compliance with anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing (AML/CTF) laws.</p>
      <p>The move caused ripples in a sector that has become a darling of stock analysts due to its global expansion and ability to benefit from online shopping growth..</p>
      <p>The auditor found Afterpay was "now appropriately aligned" to AML/CTF rules, Afterpay said in a filing to the stock exchange. The company reiterated it had not found any money-laundering or terrorism-financing activity on its systems.</p>
      <p>The regulator, the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC), would now consider the auditor's report and determine whether any further action was required, Afterpay said.</p>
      <p>AUSTRAC ordered a similar audit of PayPal Holdings Inc (O:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/paypal-holdings-inc">PYPL</a>) in September, flagging concerns that reporting obligations had not been met.</p>
      <p>Buy-now-pay-later companies let shoppers purchase products without paying upfront, and without the regulatory hurdle of applying for a credit card or loan, and typically make money by receiving fees from vendors.</p>
      <p>Australia's financial sector is under mounting regulatory scrutiny after a series of scandals and revelations of widespread wrongdoing, including massive breaches of AML/CTF rules.</p>
      <p>AUSTRAC last week accused the country's second-largest, lender Westpac Banking Corp (AX:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/westpac-banking-corporation">WBC</a>), of failing to report millions of suspect transactions.</p>
