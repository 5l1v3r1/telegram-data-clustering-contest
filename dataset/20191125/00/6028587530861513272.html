      <p>It is common to see entrepreneurs team up with childhood or college friends, and there is certainly nothing wrong with that. There are countless success stories and anecdotal pieces that swirl around all corners of the internet.As a small-business advisor, I've found that, as in anything, a certain percentage of those relationships turn into fantastic business ventures. However, there are just as many that don't end up well.</p>
      <p>Interestingly enough, I've observed that a fair share of those relationships start with a simple premise: Two or more friends are discussing a topic of interest, and one (or all) conceptualize how a business venture would work. Some big ideas and innovative theories are put forward, and everyone is happy. Depending on the personalities involved, the next step is likely either holding a more in-depth conversation about the product and services or developing a funding strategy. You get the gist: The A-Team has a plan and can't wait to execute it.</p>
      <p>So far, so good. Nothing extraordinary has happened; they have a product in mind, a funding strategy and a loose idea of who will do what. But is it enough to start a business?</p>
      <p>
        <b>Doing Versus Leading</b>
      </p>
      <p>It goes without saying that most small businesses will start with a limited team to include the bare minimum of personnel. Although leadership is extremely important to success, the startup environment is likely to benefit from revenue-generating activities more than leadership input — at least during the very early stages.</p>
      <p>But when co-founders are good friends, they can often disagree on their roles as leaders and, in turn, disagree on what to prioritize as a young company. To resolve these disagreements at the early startup stage, it is likely that a couple of preliminary strategy sessions would be held to help sort things out, and those friends would then be able to move forward. Behold, the first moments of "friction" will have been overcome.</p>
      <p>From my perspective, there are two different scenarios that could play out to help the co-founders reach a resolution:</p>
      <p>• Scenario A: The friends logically examined both the short- and long-term implications of the issue at hand — what their specific roles should be — and its solutions.</p>
      <p>• Scenario B: The friends just addressed the particular instance at hand and moved on.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Which one should you strive for?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Let's agree on a fundamental: There are no "right" or "wrong" decisions in business. Only tradeoffs. If one agrees with that statement, both of the above scenarios are valid. One used the occasion to solve a long-term problem, the other solved a temporary problem. In both cases, the entrepreneurs were dealing with an issue that was not well thought of in advance, but both managed to move the company forward. So, why would one be better than the other? Can you guess which one is the best option?</p>
      <p>If you guessed Scenario A, you are correct. In Scenario B, the members opted to consider the issue at hand as a short-term issue and failed to address the more fundamental underlying concerns. They did not consider that, unlike any other member of the organization, the founders or partners are virtually permanent (or at the least have a long tenure). If the duties and responsibilities are not clearly defined, either one of the founding members can create huge obstacles ranging from one-off daily disputes to constant conflict among the leadership team, which can seep into the rest of the organization.</p>
      <p>So, how do you achieve Scenario A?</p>
      <p>
        <b>Start by assessing your skill</b>
        <b>s.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The idea here is that a business relationship requires more than just friendship as a basis. Although friendship eliminates some of the nuisances of running a business, it is not enough to sustain a company. Some of the important factors that need to be included in deciding who should do what are:</p>
      <p>• Subject matter expertise</p>
      <p>• Project or specialized expertise</p>
      <p>• Prior business experience</p>
      <p>• Technology know-how</p>
      <p>• People and interpersonal skills</p>
      <p>• Availability</p>
      <p>Although this list is not exhaustive, it illustrates the fundamentals that are extremely valuable in the leader of a startup and, in some instances, would be substantially more preferable to "friendship" as a prerequisite.</p>
      <p><b>Then, work out the details.</b> The next step after the skill evaluation is clarity. We've all likely heard the expression "ambiguity is the enemy of accountability." This is a perfect place to use that expression to your benefit: Spell out all duties in as many details as possible, and agree on who will do what. Combine it with a clear mechanism of accountability in order to have an unbiased assessment of work and responsibility outcomes.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The Bottom Line</b>
      </p>
      <p>At this point, it is obvious that friendship is not a replacement for the due diligence and concise division of work that is required to set up and run a successful small business. To put it more clearly: Friends, colleagues, neighbors or anyone else should not be exempt from the kind of due diligence that one would require from anyone else.</p>
      <p>Just remember: The friend who was always late or the one who always showed up when the work was done likely isn't going to suddenly be an astute business operator who will lead your company to success. There is nothing wrong with partnering with someone you know or someone who comes highly recommended; just be sure to not absolve them from the necessities you would expect from someone you do not know.</p>
