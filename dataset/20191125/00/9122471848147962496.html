      <h1>Troy Aikman Calls Out Cowboys’ Coaching During Patriots Game</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:14:06+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 00:14</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/tzvimachlin" target="_blank">Tzvi Machlin</a></address>
      <p>The Dallas Cowboys only narrowly avoided disaster in the middle of the fourth quarter against the Patriots today. After giving up a field goal to make it 13-6 New England, the ensuing kickoff could have all but ended the game.</p>
      <p>Return man Tony Pollard lined up out of position and the kickoff hit the ground and sailed behind him. Pollard was able to jump on the ball – well behind the 15-yard line.</p>
      <p>FOX commentator Troy Aikman noticed Pollard in the wrong position from the get-go and was almost unsurprised when the play went south.</p>
      <p>After it happened, Aikman called out the coaching staff for letting that happen.</p>
      <p>“That’s poor coaching,” he said at the start of the drive.</p>
      <p>The Cowboys ultimately fell a few yards short of a touchdown, and had to settle for a field goal that made the game 13-9.</p>

      <p>Bear in mind, that assessment on Troy Aikman’s part isn’t necessarily the fault of Jason Garrett. It falls on special teams coordinator Keith O’Quinn. But Garrett is the team’s leader, <a href="https://thespun.com/more/top-stories/jason-garrett-cowboys-undisciplined-performance">and he’s faced plenty of criticism today (and this season).</a></p>
      <p>Nevertheless, if the Cowboys ultimately get done in by a mistake of that magnitude and miss the playoffs because of this loss, someone is going to be the raked over the coals for it.</p>
      <p>The Patriots are leading the Cowboys, 13-9, with a little more than two minutes to play. The game is on FOX.</p>
