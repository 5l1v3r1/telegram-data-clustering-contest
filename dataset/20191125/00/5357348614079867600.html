        <b>THE Government is to reintroduce a programme for unemployed Jamaicans living in rural communities called the “Length Man” programme.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Prime Minister Andrew Holness made the announcement yesterday that the programme would be introduced across rural Jamaica to employ people who have not benefited from the Government's prosperity programme.</p>
      <p>He told the crowd at yesterday's Jamaica Labour Party's (JLP) 76th annual conference at the National Arena in Kingston that each “length man” will have several chains of road to maintain, for which he or she will be paid.</p>
      <p>“Right across Jamaica, we will be enlisting the services of Jamaicans to maintain these roads on a regular basis, using technology to monitor and report on the roads, and maintain our roadways and verges, maintain our drains and gullies,” he explained.</p>
      <p>“We expect that the programme will employ a significant number of people right across rural Jamaica to ensure that they get a little piece of the prosperity,” he added.</p>
      <p>According to the prime minister, the progress to prosperity sometimes can seem unfair to people who have not yet seen or felt the benefits.</p>
      <p>“They see others progressing. They see people getting employed, but they can't get employed, and they see people getting houses, but they can't get houses. And it can cause in the society a kind of alienation, and we are sensitive to that,” he stated.</p>
      <p>“That is why we emphasise equal opportunity, and the best way to equalise opportunity is to give every single Jamaican — especially the Jamaican who is poor — access to education. But there is a another dimension of poverty, and that is income,” he noted.</p>
      <p>Holness explained that the Government can either seek to correct that problem in two ways, one of which is through the Programme for Advancement Through Health and Education (PATH) — by giving welfare grants to parents sending their children to school or lactating pregnant women.</p>
      <p>However, he said there was also a need to create the opportunity through which people can work for government funds through programmes like these.</p>
      <p>He noted nonetheless that the Government already has a similar programme, in the Housing, Opportunity, Production, and Employment (HOPE) Programme, which is, in part, a training and apprenticeship programme providing an avenue for the development of fully rounded young individuals through a system of National Service Corps to become productive members of society.</p>
      <p>The HOPE programme targets unattached youth, between 18 and 24 years old, who are not engaged in any meaningful way.</p>
