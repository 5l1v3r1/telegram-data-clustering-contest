      <p>BOISE, Idaho (AP) - Idaho officials are seeking public comments on a waiver to Medicaid expansion involving mental health treatment and substance abuse.</p>
      <p>The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare said Friday it’s taking comments through Dec. 24.</p>
      <p>The waiver would allow Medicaid recipients to receive inpatient treatment for mental health and substance abuse disorders at a freestanding psychiatric hospital.</p>
      <p>Currently, those services are only available in the psychiatric unit of a full-service hospital.</p>
      <p>State officials say the waiver will expand access to outpatient behavioral health services throughout the state.</p>

      <p>The waiver is supported by Reclaim Idaho, the group behind the Medicaid expansion initiative that passed last year.</p>
