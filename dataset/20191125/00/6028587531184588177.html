      <p>All in all, 2019 a bit of an odd Black Friday for the video game console industry. Two of the three major manufacturers–Sony and Microsoft–are taking a bit of a break as they prepare to launch new hardware in 2020, and for that reason the entire holiday season has been a bit quiet on that front. It hasn’t slowed the Nintendo Switch down by any means, which looks like it will be Nintendo’s flagship console for some time, but Nintendo has never exactly been big on discounts. If you’re going to do some video game shopping this season, however, you could do a lot worse than going to the United States’ largest video game-specific retailer, troubled though it may be. We took a look at GameStop’s full ad over the weekend, and now let’s get into the best deals on Switch, Xbox One, PS4 and games. <b>Xbox One/PS4:</b> As a rule, I would avoid paying the premium on a PS4 Pro or Xbox One X this holiday season. Right now you pay about $100 extra to get the latest and greatest hardware, but there’s a problem there: it’s not going to be latest nor greatest for very long. If you’ve yet to hop on board with the new generation, a base model Xbox One S or PS4 will get you an absolute ton of games for a low price. A more expensive system will let you play those games with better graphics, but there’s a quick time limit on how long these things are going to provide the best graphics. For the base model consoles, however, I’d say to go for it: you’re paying dirt-cheap prices for excellent gaming machines with years of great software under their belts.</p>
      <p>There are really three bundles that I’d say represent the best that Xbox One and PS4 have to offer:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sony PS4 1TB Bundle with God of War, Horizon Zero Dawn and The Last of Us: $199.99 ($100 savings)</li>
        <li>Xbox One S 1TB All-Digital Bundle with Fortnite Battle Royale, Minecraft and Sea of Thieves: $149.99 ($100 savings)</li>
        <li>Xbox One S 1TB Bundle with Star Wars: Jedi Fallen Order: $199.99</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Nintendo Switch: </b>There are only two Switch bundles in the mix, and they’re fairly meager, if we’re being honest. One is a Nintendo Switch Lite with a $25 coupon, and one is an old-model Nintendo Switch with <i>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</i> and a $25 coupon. Both are fine, and worth getting so long as you know what you’re getting. There are better deals elsewhere though, so check places like Kohl’s, Target and Walmart.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Nintendo Switch Bundle: Receive a free digital copy of Mario Kart 8 plus a $25 gift coupon (Thursday and Friday)</li>
        <li>Nintendo Switch Lite: Receive a $25 gift coupon (Saturday and Sunday)</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Doorbusters: </b>There are a few odd Doorbusters on here that warrant explanation. <i>Anthem </i>for $5 is a doorbuster, but remember: you pay for video games in both time and money, and I’m just not sure <i>Anthem</i> can deliver enough enjoyment to justify the gameplat at any point. <i>The Division 2</i> is also available for the dirt-cheap price of $12<i>, </i>and you’re going to have a better time with that than <i>Anthem</i>. Even so, it’s a bit unclear what the future looks like there.</p>
      <p><i>NBA 2K20, Madden NFL 20</i> and <i>FIFA 20</i> for $28, however? If you want these games, go ahead and buy them. Easy enough.</p>
      <p><b>Games:</b> Games are a great big unwieldy mass. It can be impossible to tell what the genuine discount is on something, because prices change so much regardless. A discount on a newer game can be exciting, but you can also get great stuff for dirt cheap if it’s only one year old. That being said, here are some things you can’t go wrong buying:</p>
      <p><i>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, </i>39.99</p>
      <p><i>Mario vs. Rabbids Kingdom Battle, </i>$19.99</p>
      <p><i>Red Dead Redemption 2, </i>$29.99</p>
      <p><i>Grand Theft Auto 5, </i>$14.99</p>
      <p><i>Resident Evil 2 </i>Remake<i>, </i>$19.99</p>
      <p><i>Assassin’s Creed Odyssey: </i>$14.99</p>
      <p><i>Far Cry 5, </i>$14.99</p>
      <p><i>Hitman 2, </i>$19.99 (seriously, this one is great)</p>
      <p><b>Buy a refurbished Xbox 360 for $30:</b> Why not? If you don’t have a gaming console, the Xbox 360 is a great one. For $30!</p>
