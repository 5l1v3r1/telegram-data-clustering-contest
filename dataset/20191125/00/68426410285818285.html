      <p>Charles Schwab Corp. is acquiring rival discount brokerage TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. for US$26-billion in an all-stock deal that creates a financial service behemoth with US$5.1-trillion in client assets.</p>
      <p>The terms of the deal announced Monday will pay TD Ameritrade shareholders 1.0837 Schwab shares for each Ameritrade share they own.</p>
      <p>Toronto-Dominion Bank, which is Canada's second-largest lender by assets, owns 43 per cent of TD Ameritrade, and will swap its shares for a 13.4-per-cent stake in Schwab. As a major shareholder, TD supported the transaction, which will see Schwab pay a 17-per-cent premium to Ameritrade's average share price over 30 days ending Nov. 20. TD's voting stake in Schwab will be capped at 9.9 per cent.</p>
      <p>The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2020, subject to approvals from regulators and shareholders.</p>
      <p>“This transaction is not something that either firm needed to do,” said Peter Crawford, Schwab’s chief financial officer, on a conference call with analysts on Monday. “But we saw in the potential combination of Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade the opportunity to create an even stronger, better positioned and more dynamic company – a company of significant scale.”</p>
      <p>One critical aspect of the deal is a renegotiated and extended update to the sweep deposit agreement that TD Ameritrade has with TD Bank, which expires in 2023. The current deal on insured deposit accounts has provided about $275-million in annual revenue to TD, while giving Ameritrade a way to earn revenue from client cash without the need to create the infrastructure of a deposit-taking bank.</p>
      <p>"At Schwab, we already have a bank, and so the agreement in its current form has somewhat less value to us," Mr. Crawford said.</p>
      <p>A new 10-year contract with Schwab starts July, 2021, and will be less lucrative to TD over time, but allows the bank to protect some of the revenue it earns from sweep deposits for a longer period. The servicing fee TD earns will be reduced from 25 to 15 basis points (100 basis points equal one percentage point). And Schwab can reduce the insured-deposit balance, which stands at US$103-billion, by up to $10-billion each year until they reach a $50-billion floor.</p>
      <p>By combining the two market leaders into a single giant, Schwab expects to reap as much as US$3.5-billion to US$4-billion in financial benefits, mostly from cost-cutting and the savings from the new insured-deposit agreement. But the process of merging the two companies could take as long as three years and carry integration costs of $US1.6-billion.</p>
      <p>Robert Sedran, an analyst at CIBC World Markets Inc., noted that TD will only reap the significant value the deal is expected to create for Schwab if and when the Canadian bank elects to sell its stake in Schwab. "While it would seem obvious the merged entity is a stronger company, a passive minority stake in another financial institution would not seem to be a long-term plan for any of the Canadian banks," Mr. Sedran said.</p>
      <p>In a statement, TD CEO Bharat Masrani said, “This transaction will deliver significant value for TD and provide us with an ownership stake in one of the most innovative and highly regarded investment firms in the U.S.”</p>
      <p>TD Ameritrade had been searching for a new CEO after announcing in the summer that current chief executive Tim Hockey would leave the company early next year. That search has now been called off, and TD Ameritrade's chief financial officer, Stephen Boyle, has taken over as interim CEO. Mr. Hockey has moved to an advisory role until February.</p>
      <p>Mr. Boyle told analysts that TD Ameritrade “looked at all alternatives,” including making an acquisition of its own, before deciding to sell to Schwab.</p>
      <p>The deal combines the two largest U.S. discount brokerages, redrawing the competitive dynamics for online trading. The discount-brokerage market has been upended by a fierce price war set off by Schwab in early October. Schwab, a full-service financial firm and America's largest online broker with 12 million clients and US$3.8-trillion of assets under management, slashed its fees for online trading of U.S. stocks, exchange-traded funds and options to zero.</p>
      <p>That forced competitors such as Ameritrade, which has US$1.3-trillion in assets, and others to match the aggressive pricing. The moves sent U.S. brokerage stocks tumbling, and the effect was especially acute for TD Ameritrade, which was expected to lose 15 to 16 per cent of its revenue from lost trading commissions. In Canada, TD was expected to suffer proportionately, as a major Ameritrade shareholder.</p>
      <p>The renewed competition set off a flurry of speculation about potential deals in the sector, including the prospect that TD Ameritrade could try to buy smaller rival ETrade Financial Corp., which had long been a rumoured takeover target.</p>
      <p>Reports that Ameritrade would instead sell to Schwab, with TD's blessing, first surfaced last Thursday, pushing shares in the two companies higher. TD Ameritrade's share price rose about 5 per cent in early trading on the NASDAQ stock exchange on Monday, while shares in Charles Schwab were up 0.6 per cent on the New York Stock Exchange. TD's shares increased 0.4 per cent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.</p>
      <p>“We’re on offence,” said Schwab CEO Walt Bettinger, on Monday’s conference call. “Although the way this all played out wasn’t necessarily a plan for it to come out this way, we think it worked out well.”</p>
