        <b>AN elderly woman of Lloyd's Pen in Yallahs, St Thomas, is appealing for assistance to rebuild her home, after fire ravaged the three-bedroom wooden structure early last year.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Hazel Gooden, 75, while speaking to the Jamaica Observer North &amp; East earlier this month, said fire destroyed her home on May 10, 2018 and since that time, she has been unable to rebuild the structure.</p>
      <p>Gooden shared that she had just returned home from selling at Coronation Market in downtown Kingston when the incident occurred.</p>
      <p>She said she had gone to the kitchen to prepare dinner when her grandson raised an alarm.</p>
      <p>“Mi hear him seh, 'Hazel, fire inna yuh room'. Mi seh, 'Fire?' And when mi run inna di room mi couldn't face it. Di whole place just blaze up. Mi call one youth weh live a di [next] house and him run come. Mi have two likkle bucket inna di bathroom and mi have som bucket wid water weh mi use flush toilet if water gone,” the woman explained.</p>
      <p>She said when her neighbour arrived he instructed her to move away from the structure, which he surmised could not be saved.</p>
      <p>“When him run come and a throw it him seh, 'Miss Hazel, yuh better come out. So mi finally run out and when mi look di fire tek di living room till mi see all mi curtain dem catch a fire. Mi seh, 'Jehovah God mi nuh have nothing left' and mi run out a di yard and see whole heap of people a come,” Gooden bemoaned.</p>
      <p>She told Observer North &amp; East that firefighters at the Yallahs Fire Station, located only metres away from her home, were unable to respond to the blaze because there were no units at the facility.</p>
      <p>She also said aside from the neighbour she had called for assistance, no one else helped to battle the fire.</p>
      <p>The woman said she has since been “forced” to live with her daughter, as a result, in less than ideal conditions.</p>
      <p>“Mi waah help fi done build up di house and mi wouldn't mind likkle help fi buy food because sometimes mi nuh have nothing fi eat. Mi mawga down. Mi used to weigh 230lbs. Mi woulda thank the hands that help. I woulda thank my brothers and sisters for we are all one,” Gooden said.</p>
