      <p>GRAND ISLE, Vt. (AP) - A Winooski man has been charged with poaching salmon from a brook near a fish hatchery in Grand Isle.</p>
      <p>The Vermont Fish &amp; Wildlife Department says the 41-year-old was charged with two counts of taking fish illegally.</p>
      <p>The department said this week that wardens had received complaints about anglers fishing in Hatchery Brook late at night and in the early morning in late October and early November.</p>
      <p>The brook is closed to fishing from the mouth at Gordon’s Landing, Lake Champlain, upstream to the main hatchery driveway.</p>

        <p>Wardens searched the man’s home and said they seized fillets from four landlocked salmon caught in Hatchery Brook. If convicted the man faces up to $466 in fines, $100 in restitution and the loss of his fishing privileges in Vermont for a year.</p>
