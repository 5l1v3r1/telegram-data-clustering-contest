      <p>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. — The recent kicking woes of Daniel Carlson were mitigated a bit by the Raiders’ three-game winning streak. But after another field goal miss Sunday against the Jets his struggles have moved to the forefront.</p>
      <p>While Carlson’s missed 43-yarder wasn’t the difference in the 34-3 loss to the Jets on Sunday, it was a demoralizer given the Raiders trailed 13-3 at the time.</p>
      <p>Carlson has missed three field goals and an extra point during the last three games — when they can’t afford to have their kicker fall into a funk.</p>
      <p>Carlson faced famously gusty winds at MetLife Stadium; the wind was a factor in nearly every kick Sunday.</p>
      <p>Raiders coach Jon Gruden said he deferred comment until he talked to Carlson.</p>
      <p>“I’m not going to say much about it until I talk to all parties included,” Carlson said. “The holder, the snapper. I’ll talk to our guys. I believe in Carlson.</p>
      <p>“It’s a tough place to kick, you know, (he’s) never kicked here, I don’t know that he has. I’ve seen a lot of kickers struggle in this place.”</p>
      <p>Added Derek Carr: “Daniel is a great kicker and has been doing a great job for us for a long time now. I’m not worried about him.”</p>
