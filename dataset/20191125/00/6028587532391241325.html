      <p>While <a href="https://hbr.org/2016/11/why-diverse-teams-are-smarter">studies</a> have shown that diverse leadership teams are correlated with better financial performance, many organizations have struggled with how to actually get the most out of those diverse teams in a way that drives better performance.  And an ongoing problem in this quest was revealed last month when EY’s women’s development initiative received <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ernst-young-told-women-not-to-flaunt-bodies-because-it-scrambles-the-mind/">less-than-favorable coverage</a> in the news. With advice about how to dress, discussions of pancake and waffle brains, and concerns that women talk too much, the training was anything but inclusive.</p>
      <p>This was unfortunate for EY. And it was fortunate that other corporations’ programs weren’t subjected to the same scrutiny as they wouldn’t have fared so well either. As someone who has sat in on too many programs like this one, I recognized the material and the underlying problem with ease.</p>
      <p>You see, these programs are designed with an eye towards diversity—incorporating more kinds of people to the company—but they are not designed towards inclusion—actually welcoming and incorporating and valuing different styles of work, management, and leadership in the pursuit of better performance.  </p>
      <p>How can you tell the difference? It’s easy.  </p>
      <p>A program to promote diversity is generally focused on a gender, ethnic, or age group and it is focused on explaining to them how to be successful in the existing, ingrained power structure and in the existing, ingrained ways of working in an organization. This type of program, for example, teaches women how to behave ‘appropriately’ in the eyes of those in power and implies that advancement will come if that kind of behavior is embraced. This type of program will focus on things like wardrobe, tone of voice, and other behavioral traits (as in the EY program), and this type of program will not encourage women (or anyone) to try to change, update, improve, or adapt those existing, ingrained rules for better company results.</p>
      <p>I think about this in terms of the traditional organizations I have known - the law firms, consulting firms, and other companies in traditional industries where success is determined by living in the right neighborhood, belonging to the right club, having a degree from the right school, having the picture-perfect family, driving the right kind of car, and vacationing in the right places around the world. In companies with these types of cultures, success is driven by following those ingrained rules, and programs like the one at EY are probably effective in training people to follow those existing rules. </p>
      <p>But for any other organization who is trying to win the war for talent and to attract, retain, and develop people who are going to inspire, change, update, grow, and disrupt industries, the development programs need to be focused differently. The focus needs to be on teaching leaders to identify great people to bring onto the team and then to learn how to bring out the best in them. This is hard. It is complex. Humans are messy. But to leverage the benefits of diversity, this kind of inclusive approach is required.  </p>
      <p>So what is my advice? Don’t attend leadership development programs that aren’t inclusive in their materials and invitees. I have literally refused to participate in a women’s leadership initiative in an organization because no men were invited. (“But, Robin, it’s a <i>women’s</i> initiative so why would we have men there?”) I explained that we did not need to train women how to work in our organization. We needed to teach all people managers how to hire, promote, develop, and manage talent in an inclusive way so that we can beat the competition and win in the marketplace. I explained that a program with both male and female people managers would lead to greater organizational awareness and impact. I was not listened to. But at least I spoke up.  </p>
      <p>And what can you do besides be a rabble rouser in your company? Well, someone once told me that diversity is like being invited to a party and inclusion is like being invited to dance while you are at the party. In order to achieve better performance, we cannot only invite people to the party and ask them to stand around like everyone else. We must invite them to dance their dance. And then we must join in with our dance. And we must have development programs that teach us all how to do that!</p>
