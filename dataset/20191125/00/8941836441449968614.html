      <p>AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) - A Massachusetts teenager charged in the killing of a 47-year-old woman in Maine is due in court to enter a plea and to be sentenced.</p>
      <p>Seventeen-year-old <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/william-smith/">William Smith</a> was one of three teenagers charged in the 2018 killing of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kimberly-mironovas/">Kimberly Mironovas</a> in Litchfield. He’s expected in court Monday.</p>
      <p>Judge Andrew Benson found that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/william-smith/">Smith</a> was “the prime mover” in the plan. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kimberly-mironovas/">Mironovas</a>‘ son, 16-year-old Lukas Mironovas, is due to be sentenced in December.</p>
      <p>Another teenager, Thomas Severance of Massachusetts, was 13 at the time of the killing and pleaded guilty. He will remain in juvenile detention until he’s 21.</p>

        <p>Court documents indicate that before <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kimberly-mironovas/">Kimberly Mironovas</a> was killed she confronted the teens about missing marijuana and refused to drive <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/william-smith/">Smith</a> and Severance that she wouldn’t drive them back to Massachusetts.</p>
