      <p>A furious Arsenal fan threw away his season ticket on air after the Gunners' struggled to draw against relegation-threatened <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/southampton-fc">Southampton</a> on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Pressure is growing on <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> boss Unai Emery after a run of five Premier League games without a win left the North London side in eighth place, eight points adrift of fourth-placed <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> .</p>
      <p>And Gunners fans yesterday <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/arsenal-fans-issue-statement-outlining-20951283">issued a statement</a> accusing the club's hierarchy of “rudderless” leadership which has left the club “floating aimlessly.”</p>
      <p>Arsenal were headed for an embarrassing defeat at the Emirates on Saturday against struggling Southampton - and it took until the sixth minute of added time for until Alexandre Lacazette to come to the rescue with an equaliser.</p>
      <p>And it was too much for fan, who could be seen throwing his season ticket away as he launched a furious tirade littered with four-letter words while being interviewed by Arsenal Fan TV.</p>

      <p>Beginning the interview by holding his season ticket in front of him, the raging fan blasted: "This is my season ticket you know, do you know how much I paid for this s**t? This is my f**king season ticket."</p>
      <p>He is seen throwing it into the crowd behind him without a second look, repeatedly saying, "I don't need it" before adding "It's a f**king joke".</p>
      <p>The interviewer then urges him to pick up his season ticket, to which the fan replies: "Forget my season ticket, forget this team.</p>

      <p>He then repeatedly says "I've had enough" before ending the interview with "That's all I've got to say, thank you".</p>
      <p>Arsenal froze season-ticket prices in the summer for the fifth season in the row, but permanent seats at the Emirates are still among the most expensive in the Premier League. The cheapest Arsenal season ticket is £891, with prices going up to as much as £1,768.</p>
