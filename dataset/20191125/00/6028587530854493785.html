      <p>Rey Mysterio came up short in his quest for his second WWE Championship win as Brock Lesnar outlasted both him and Dominic in a thrilling world title match. Whether or not Rey Mysterio and Brock Lesnar have had their last match for the time being—or ever—is anybody’s guess in today’s topsy turvy WWE. Brock Lesnar saga’s tend to be one-offs, especially those of the David vs. Goliath variety as was the case in similarly excellent matches against Finn Balor, Daniel Bryan and AJ Styles.</p>
      <p>But the Lesnar-Mysterio story is one of the rare WWE stories that has been competently told from beginning to bell time. Everybody from Rey Mysterio’s son Dominic to former UFC heavyweight champion “El Padrino” Cain Velasquez has been employed to truly make this angle pop.</p>
      <p>Throw in a handful of excellent and sincere promos from Rey Mysterio and a led pipe, and this had all the ingredients to become the exception to the rule as a WWE feud that hit on all cylinders.</p>
      <p>With Survivor Series sometimes serving as the prelude to WrestleMania—Brock Lesnar’s squash match loss to Goldberg in 2016 led to a rematch a few months later at WrestleMania 33—a WrestleMania rematch between Lesnar and Mysterio isn’t entirely out of the question.</p>
      <p>With limited in-ring action, both Rey Mysterio and Brock Lesnar (or, more accurately, Paul Heyman) have used emotion and promos to build to a match that was every bit as good as it should have been on paper.</p>
