      <h1>Lean Toward Risk: Sticking With What’s Comfortable Will Leave You Less Secure, Not More So</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Margie Warrell</a></address>
      <p>Last week I attended Morgan Stanley’s Asia Pacific Summit in Singapore. A three day event which attracts thousands of people from across the region and the world, many of the sessions were focused on helping attendees to better forecast the future and manage the uncertainty that’s become the new norm. Risk was hot topic. Or more accurately put, assessing the right risks to take. </p>
      <p>There’s no arguing that we’re living in uncertain times. A quick glance at the Bloomberg feed will confirm the lack of predictability in today’s global marketplace.</p>
      <p>The heightened volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity of our ‘VUCA’ world can trigger and amplify anxiety in many people which, in turn, can fuel heightened risk aversion. It does so because our brains are wired to look for patterns and move toward reinforces our sense of security and safety. At least in the short term.</p>
      <p>We want to make plans on a future we can predict. On the flip side, we have a strong aversion to putting ourselves I situations that only heighten our anxiety. So given the choice of sticking on the current path that feels familiar or diverting onto a less familiar ground, the former has the stronger psychological pull. </p>

      </figure>
      <p>It’s just how we’re wired. </p>
      <p>To seek pleasure (comfort, certainty, security, safety, predictability) and to avoid pain (or any threat of it... and anything uncertain is laden with threats of it!) </p>
      <p>It’s why when the ground beneath us feels unstable and our future less certain than it once did, people tend to hunker down, play it safe, and err toward the path of caution. </p>
      <p>Perhaps you’ve done that yourself once or twice. </p>
      <p>I certainly have. </p>
      <p>However, it is in times of uncertainty that those who are willing to lean toward risk can reap the greatest rewards. Take Jeff Bezos, well known for his willingness to make decisions with 70% of available information as distinct from many corporate leaders who want to have all their ducks lined up in a row before making a call. </p>
      <p>This isn’t about throwing caution to the wind and conflating brave risk taking with impulsive recklessness. It is about assessing the options fully, and then choosing a course of action that fully takes into account the often hidden and longer term costs of <i>not</i> taking a risk. </p>
      <p>Unfortunately, this is something that most of us tend to do rather poorly. Not consciously of course. Rather, as Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman noted in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0374533555/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0374533555&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wwwmargiewarr-20&amp;linkId=3fd4a1fac435228208bb5e6c85cb69ac"><i>Thinking Fast and Slow</i></a>, our brains are more sensitive to the risks of what could go wrong than the possibilities of what could go right. And so when assessing between options, we’re wired to focus more on what could go wrong than on what could go right; more on what we could lose than on what we could gain. </p>
      <p>As I shared in a recent talk (below), it’s impossible to accurately predict the future. Yet only when we are willing to take a risk, and to forego the security of the known, can we create new opportunities, innovate new ideas, build broader capability, grow greater influence and forge new ground.   </p>
      <p>All well and good right? However if you’re currently at a cross roads and not sure whether to take action or play it safe, how can you discern between a smart risk and a foolish one? </p>
      <p>Surely, you might say, when there’s so much uncertainty at play, it’s better to just hold tight and stick with the known for now until things settle down? After all, that’s precisely what many do. </p>
      <p>So if you’re just not sure whether being ‘brave’ and ‘feeling the fear and doing it anyway’ is smart or plain old stupid, reflect on these three questions.</p>
      <p>
        <b>-1- What lays at stake?</b>
      </p>
      <p>When I was nineteen I went parachuting. After a day learning the ropes (literally), I I jumped out of a plane at 5,000 feet in the air. It scared the heck out of me but I was glad I did it if for no other reason than it built my confidence for bigger things. A year later after graduating college I donned a backpack and spent a year traveling around the world on my own. That too, bolstered my confidence for bigger things as well as broadening my outlook on life </p>
      <p>These days, with four kids depending on me and college tuitions to pay, I have no appetite for those risks. The thrill of jumping out a plane is simply not worth the risk of potential injury or worse. put another way, what lays at stake now is different than it was then. </p>
      <p>Likewise, sticking your neck out and laying your reputation, security and pride on the line isn’t something you do lightly. To muster up the resolve and sheer courage you need to take a risk you’ve got to be be able to answer the question: </p>
      <p>
        <i>For the sake of what am I willing to take this risk?</i>
      </p>
      <p>There’s many answers to that question. One that has compelled me out of my comfort zone countless times has simply been “because I don’t want to look back one day and regret not having tried.” </p>
      <p>Or perhaps you just know it’s the right thing to do and failing to do it feels like you’re selling out on yourself. </p>
      <p>So get clear about what lays at stake here if you <i>don't</i> take the risk. </p>
      <p>What is it you might one day regret? Keep in mind that at the end of life, people regret far more the risks that they did not take than those that they did. </p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <i>-2- Is what I could potentially gain worth what I could potentially lose?</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Potential losses loom larger in our minds eye than potential gains. In fact MRI scans of the brain show that our brains are twice as sensitive to potential losses as they are to potential gains. </p>
      <p>Sure there’s no guarantee that your boldness will land you the results that you want, but if you don’t take action, what is it that you risk missing out on? The risks of inaction tend to be less obvious, less visible and longer term. They also tend to be far steeper than we estimate them to be.</p>
      <p>Daniel Gilbert, a Professor of Psychology at Harvard University and author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/search/ref=as_li_qf_sp_sr_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=wwwmargiewarr-20&amp;keywords=Thinking%20fast%20and%20slow&amp;index=aps&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;linkId=033408034a795bd2bb043c6088312a0c"><i>Stumbling on Happiness </i></a>writes that we can more easily justify an excess of courage far more easily than an excess of cowardice. In other words, if we take the risk and it doesn’t work out, we can more easily reconcile ourselves with that outcome than we can with not having had the courage to make the attempt. </p>
      <p>It’s another way of asking what do you put at risk if you don't take the risk? Too often we discount the cost of inaction and come up with rationalizations to justify our cautiousness. </p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <i>-3- Where am I giving fear of what I could lose more power than my desire for what I could gain? </i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Fear is a powerful emotion. Left unchecked, it can spread like a virus and set up permanent residence in the drivers seat of our lives. It’s why so many people spend so much of their lives living in the confines of their comfort zone which over time, just gets smaller and leaves them feeling less confident and more anxious of all things outside it. </p>
      <p>Research shows that in order for us to thrive as human beings, we need to be working toward meaningful aspirations that require us to stretch and grow in some way. Does that invite extra challenges into our lives versus working toward easy goals that ask little of us? You bet. But it’s through the process of being stretched and challenged that we grow and flourish. </p>
      <p>As you’ve undoubtedly seen on social media feeds countless times, “the magic happens outside your comfort zone.” </p>
      <p>If only it were less uncomfortable to leave it right? </p>
      <p>Which is why, in the grand scheme of life, embracing discomfort is so crucial to our personal fulfillment and professional success. </p>
      <p>So whatever you are dealing with right now, I encourage you to think about what endeavor is so important to you that you’d be willing to risk falling short in pursuing it. Not that you want to fall short and not that you want work hard to avoid that, but if you did, you would not regret having made the attempt. </p>
      <p>Only by consciously choosing to take a risk - a mistake, an awkward conversation, an imperfect decision, a rejection.... - can you accomplish more than you have up to now and grow your capacity for even bigger things. </p>
      <p>John F. Kennedy once said, "Nothing worthwhile has ever been accomplished with a guarantee of success." I would add that nothing ever will be.</p>
      <p>It’s impossible to accurately predict what will have changed in our world ten years from now. Even the best economists regularly get it wrong. Yet while we cannot know what the landscape will look like as we near the year 2030, what we do know is that there will be people who have achieved extraordinary success in the intervening decade and that they will not be people who’ve played it super safe and stuck only with what provided a guarantee of short term success. Rather, they will be people who have continued to stretch themselves and take risks, amid the uncertainty, knowing that the biggest risk they take is not taking any risks at all. </p>
      <p>The question is - will you be one of them?</p>
      <p>My parting advice, lean toward risk and don’t wait for courage before you act with it. </p>
