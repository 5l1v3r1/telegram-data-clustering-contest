        <b>Intel has reportedly patented its own game controller. It is liberally provisioned with joysticks, buttons, a D-pad and what could be shoulder triggers. Furthermore, its design also includes a touchpad, which is apparentedly associated with a patent of its own. This new in-house controller could be related to this company's cloud-gaming partnership with Tencent.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The blog LetsGoDigital has discovered <a href="https://nl.letsgodigital.org/spelcomputers-games/intel-game-controller-cloud-gaming/">a patent</a>, for a new <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Razer-s-Junglecat-controller-turns-your-Android-phone-into-a-Switch.440553.0.html">game controller</a>, apparently filed by Intel. This device has all the bells and whistles you might expect from the average Sony <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/DualShock-5-patent-design-may-disappoint-PlayStation-fans.443199.0.html">DualShock</a>; however, it also appears to have extra buttons towards its bottom edge, which could be media controls. That is not its most original feature, though: it also integrates a touchpad, found in the upper central part of the design. </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Intel-debuts-its-new-NUC-10-Performance-series.444686.0.html">Intel</a> does not exactly <a href="https://nl.letsgodigital.org/uploads/2019/11/intel-game-controller-touchpad.pdf">specify</a> what use-cases this novel controller component could have, although it may have come up with some by the time it comes to market this putative device. It is also not clear at this point if this possible own-brand <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Nubia-Red-Magic-3S-90-Hz-smartphone-gets-new-Eclipse-Black-color-for-480.444042.0.html">gaming</a> product could be wireless. However, its drawings do suggest that it could have HDMI inputs, as well as what could be dual USB type C ports and a 3.5mm headphone jack.</p>
      <p>The appearance of this <a href="https://nl.letsgodigital.org/uploads/2019/11/intel-game-controller-touchpad.pdf">patent</a> on the United States Patents and Trademarks Office (USPTO) database has led to speculation that Intel will sell the resulting device as part of an upcoming <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Nvidia-s-GeForce-Now-cloud-gaming-platform-is-ready-for-launch.414696.0.html">cloud gaming</a> platform. Intel may indeed have plans for the same in the works: it <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/tencent-demonstrates-cloud-gaming-solution-jointly-created-by-tencent-cloud-tencent-wetest-and-intel-at-g-star-2018-300754589.html">introduced</a> just such a state-of-the-art Gaming Solution at G-STAR 2018, in partnership with <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Over-25-million-people-play-Apex-Legends-in-its-first-week-Tencent-may-distribute-it-in-China.408356.0.html">Tencent</a>'s Cloud and WeTest divisions. </p>
      <p>This <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/tencent-demonstrates-cloud-gaming-solution-jointly-created-by-tencent-cloud-tencent-wetest-and-intel-at-g-star-2018-300754589.html">Solution</a> is based on <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Intel-launches-new-Xeon-W-2200-HEDT-CPUs-based-on-Cascade-Lake-X.437701.0.html">Xeon</a> processors, although the actual <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/PUBG-Mobile-faces-stiff-competition-as-Activision-s-Call-of-Duty-Mobile-launches-in-full.436239.0.html">content</a> would presumably be provided by the other <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Razer-and-Tencent-announce-mobile-gaming-collaboration.414960.0.html">collaborator</a> in this endeavor. Therefore, they may have channeled <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Google-s-Stadia-wireless-controller-will-require-physical-cable-for-PCs-and-mobile-devices-at-launch.439773.0.html">Google</a> in also moving to offer their own game <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Sony-files-patent-for-cloud-connected-game-controller.439791.0.html">controller</a> to go with any real-world result of this project.
