      <h1>Finding Harmony at the Supermarket</h1>
      <h2>In a world full of anger, I have located an unlikely refuge.</h2>

      <p>In the past few years, countless observers have chronicled the rise of incivility in our country.</p>
      <p>Sharp divides in political perspectives have likely fueled this trend, as has the anonymity of the online world. It’s easy to make hateful remarks in cyberspace while hiding behind the protective armor of a fake name.</p>
      <p>The issue even came up in the Democratic presidential debate earlier this month. Vice President Joe Biden said, “Look, we have to bring this country together. Let's start talking civilly to people . . . ” He then added, “Look, it's just—look, it's about civility. We have to restore the soul of this country.”</p>
      <p>In the face of increasing rudeness, hostility and even hatefulness, the best response might seem to be to retreat to safe spaces frequented only by those one knows and trusts—a house of worship, for example, or a private club of some type.</p>
      <p>But before we all give up and crawl away into our hiding places, I would like to propose a small experiment: Take a trip to your local supermarket. Or, better yet, come visit <i>my </i>local supermarket.</p>

      <p>My observation—supported by weekly visits since I moved to my neighborhood three years ago—is that the vast majority of my fellow shoppers are extremely well-behaved and even cordial to one another.</p>
      <p>It is not because we are all from the same ethnic background. The U.S. Census Bureau’s helpful statistics on my suburban township tell me that 66 percent of my neighbors identify as white, 24 percent identify as Black or African American, 6 percent identify as Hispanic or Latino, 4 percent identify as Asian and 3 percent identify as two or more races.</p>
      <p>In terms of age, we are also a diverse mix. Nearly 20 percent of us are 65 or over, and just over 20 percent are under 18. Women (or, to use the Census Bureau’s term, “female persons”) account for 53 percent of my township’s 25,107 residents.</p>
      <p>Nor is this a wealthy community—at least compared to national figures. The Census Bureau lists median household income of $61,995 for the period 2013 to 2017. By comparison, according to the Bureau, U.S. median household income during the same period was $57,652. That means my neighborhood’s median household income is just 7.5 percent above the national figure.</p>
      <p>When I visit my local grocery store, I am guaranteed to run into shoppers from a wide variety of backgrounds—a melting pot of ethnicities, ages and other differences.</p>
      <p>I see parents with young children, moms with teenage daughters, retired couples, people with disabilities, hip twenty-somethings with headphones and men with long, ZZ Top-like beards and camouflage pants—all making their way through the aisles and down their shopping lists.</p>
      <p>On two trips last week, I encountered—among many other shoppers—an Asian man and women having an intense conversation in an Asian language; an African American dad pushing a large cart with three young boys in tow; and an older white man wearing a long black overcoat and hefting a six-pack of paper towels.</p>
      <p>In the produce section, as I wheeled my cart from the bananas to the spinach, an older white woman near the spinach stopped dead in her tracks and, with a smile, motioned me to go ahead. Only after I smiled, pointed to the spinach and said, “I’m going right there!” did she concede to cross in front of me with her cart.</p>
      <p>As I turned into the cereal aisle, a young mother pushing a large shopping cart, followed by a young boy pushing a child-sized cart, hurried past me, but she slowed long enough to say, in a friendly tone, “Excuse us,” which I found charming.</p>
      <p>As I was leaving the store on one of my recent visits, I passed a young African American man —probably in his 30s—on his way in. I had never seen him before, but he gave me a <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/shyness">shy</a>, friendly smile, prompting me to smile in return.</p>
      <p>I could be his mother’s age, and perhaps he was amused by my winter garb. With my wool beret, scarf, gloves and winter coat, I was comically ready to face the polar elements, even though the temperature that night was only in the 40s. But this brief encounter lifted my spirits nonetheless.</p>
      <p>Years ago, I heard a radio interview with a highway safety expert who explained that driving was one of the greatest examples of something he called “social <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/teamwork">cooperation</a>.” I had not heard this term before, but I gathered it meant what it implied: people in a large group behaving in a cooperative way so all could achieve a common goal—in that case, driving to their destinations without harm.</p>
      <p>Certainly the stakes are not as nearly as high in the aisles of my local supermarket as they are on our nation’s highways. But what I see in my grocery store every week gives me hope that human beings really do have the capacity to get along with each other, even if we have many differences—including our ethnic backgrounds, our ages, our income levels and our favorite foods.</p>
      <p>So when you next sink into despair about the state of humankind, it might be time to visit your neighborhood market. Take your shopping list, claim a cart and stroll through the aisles, ready to engage harmoniously with your fellow shoppers.</p>
      <p>As you observe people making room in the aisles to let each other pass, or smiling at a cute toddler, or helping an older woman grab a box of cake mix from a shelf way out of her reach, you might discover there really is more that unites us than divides us—at least in this fluorescent, momentary utopia.</p>
      <p>It’s not a feeling that will last forever. It might even evaporate by the time you get to the parking lot. But maybe it’s a start.</p>
