      <p>BERLIN (AP) - German engineering firm <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/bosch/">Bosch</a> is shutting down its motor scooter-sharing service Coup, currently operating in four European cities.</p>
      <p>In a statement Monday, Coup said it will end its operations in Berlin and the southwest German city of Tuebingen in mid-December. It said services in Paris and Madrid would also be discontinued shortly.</p>
      <p>The company said it was not economically feasible to continue operating over the long term “given a sharing market that is extremely competitive and the service’s high costs.”</p>
      <p>Coup offered about 6,000 battery-powered motor scooters that could be located and rented using a smartphone app.</p>
