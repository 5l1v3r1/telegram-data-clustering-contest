      <p><i>Wellington.Scoop</i><br/>Miramar South residents met last week to discuss their concerns about the Wellington Airport extension plans.</p>
      <p>The local people are concerned that the airport has given notice that it wants residential land to be re-designated for airport use so that it can develop open space which was formerly the Miramar South school.</p>
      <p>Spokesperson Fiona Prestidge told the meeting that a Designation avoids the resource consent process and escapes District Plan zoning/rules.</p>
      <p>She said the airport was planning buildings 10m high, covering 35% of the school site. It was intending to relocate ancillary airport businesses, some operating 24/7. There would be traffic changes, especially on Broadway.</p>
      <p>She asked:</p>
      <p>1. Are activities like rental cars and freight handling ‘critical / essential services’ for the Wellington region and deserving special District Plan treatment?<br/>2. Why has relocation of these operations to the existing airport precinct zone (Lyall Bay retail centre) or adjacent industrial/commercial land on Tirangi Rd not been considered?<br/>3. Can designation be justified when there are existing district plan mechanisms like zoning (ref Airport Precint DP ch.11) and resource consent process?<br/>4. Why did the WCC decide not to publicly-notify this application for Designation?</p>
      <p>Another question of concern to the local residents: is the land use reasonable in a residential zone?</p>
      <p>The airport envisages<br/>– Activities including 24 hour operations (flight catering)<br/>– Buildings 10m high with 8m walls (massive bulk/shading)<br/>– Generating new truck / car traffic on Broadway and Kauri St<br/>– Occupies a whole block, with 35% / 20,000m (2 hectares) of buildings<br/>– Substantial new sources of noise, light and air pollution</p>
      <p>The residents feel this would:<br/>– Impose commercial/industrial scale activity in an established residential zone<br/>– Remove open space from everyday use (esp. dog walkers/kids)<br/>– Set the scene for further ‘airport noise blighting’ and continuing airport expansion over Miramar</p>
      <p>In her presentation, Fiona Prestidge asked: Is WIAL acquiring land for expansion fairly and openly? She said the airport has made approaches to purchase Miro St properties – but this is not mentioned in their 2040 Plan. “The golf course is being purchased. What other deals is the airport up to?”</p>
      <p>Other information given to the meeting of residents:</p>
      <p>Ownership of the land:<br/>● The Crown owns the school site but there has been no public information about the land’s status/sale<br/>● Residents learned through contact with Taranaki Whanui that an unconditional purchase agreement has been made by the airport – settlement by 18 December<br/>● Taranaki Whanui were not offered First Right of Refusal, as the sale is pursuant to s50 Public Works Act</p>
      <p>Ownership of the land – Timeline<br/>● Pre July 2015 – WIAL advised Ministry of Education of their interest in the land<br/>● July 2015 – land declared surplus by Ministry of Education, and passed over to LINZ for disposal<br/>● October 2015 – Housing NZ advised LINZ they had no interest in the land<br/>● December 2017 – new requirement of Cabinet requiring Housing NZ and MBIE to be advised before disposal<br/>● February 2018 – MBIE (HUD) advise LINZ of their interest, but LINZ advised they were too late as things were well advanced with WIAL<br/>● October 2019 – LINZ approve transfer of land to WIAL</p>
      <p>Is there a conflict of interest?</p>
      <p>● Wellingtonians depend on WCC to uphold and administer the Wellington City District Plan.<br/>● How can WCC reasonably do this without conflict of interest given it is a shareholder in WIAL and recipient of dividends from airport activity?<br/>● Approving this designation could make WCC appear a conflicted planning authority not able to balance local residents needs with regional airport interests<br/>● Is the integrity of Wellington planning itself under threat?</p>
      <p>The Miramar residents are also concerned about the short period of consultation:</p>
      <p>WIAL discussions with the Crown on land acquisition have been ongoing for years;<br/>WCC has been discussing this with WIAL for two years or more;<br/>WIAL has been preparing this designation notice of requirement since early 2018, but the WCC only notified it to affected residents on 25 October;<br/>Local residents were sent hundreds of pages of Requiring Authority Notice documents and consultants’ reports, and given only until 25 November (just 4 weeks) for Submissions to the WCC.</p>
      <p>While pursuing this designation, WIAL has also.<br/>❏ obtained resource consent for rental car operations on the site.<br/>❏ slowed / delayed its airport noise remediation packages for local properties</p>
      <p>Written submissions close at 5pm tonight. Send by email to planning@wcc.govt.nz.</p>
