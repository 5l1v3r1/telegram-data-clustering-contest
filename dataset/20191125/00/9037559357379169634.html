      <p>The Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) on Monday issued a clarification about a fake notification being circulated on social media platforms over the past few days regarding the suspension of the operations of a telecom company in Pakistan.</p>
      <p>PTA urged the public to refrain from spreading the notification since it was fake. </p>
      <p>In a message shared on the social networking platform Twitter, the authority said it was aware of a false advertisement circulating via WhatsApp chat groups for users of the mobile operator. </p>
      <p>"PTA is aware of a false advertisement circulating via WhatsApp chat groups for users of a mobile operator. PTA clarifies that the aforementioned advertisement is fake," the company said, adding that spreading it might generate confusion and inconvenience for consumers.</p>
      <p>"The public is advised to always check official information sources such as PTA's website at http://pta.gov.pk or its Twitter &amp; Facebook page for latest news/updates," the authority said. </p>
      <p>The fake notification being circulated in social media is misleading the general public, asking them to switch to another mobile network or consume their mobile network credit before December 11, 2019, making the false claim that the services of the private company would no longer be available in Pakistan.</p>
      <p>Last week, the standing committee of the National Assembly had been advised by the Information Technology Board that the government should build a separate entity to tackle fake news on social media. Concerns were also raised about fake government notifications being spread on media. </p>
