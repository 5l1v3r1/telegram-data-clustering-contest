      <p>Roger Federer has a jam-packed schedule for 2020 that includes plans to play in all four Grand Slam tournaments as well as the Olympics and the Laver Cup.But the 38-year-old tennis legend hasn’t ruled out playing beyond 2020, either. The 20-time Grand Slam champion will turn 40 in 2021.</p>
      <p>“So 2020 is set but 2021, I just don’t know because it’s too far away but of course if I have the chance to play and everything’s still working sure why not?” Federer said Monday at a press conference in Manhattan to promote his association with the Swedish sneaker brand On.</p>
      <p>Federer’s legion of fans dread the word “retirement” and Federer is careful to avoid using it. He says he’ll continue to play as long as his family – which includes his wife, Mirka, and two sets of twins – support him, and as long as his body holds up and he can continue to be competitive.</p>
      <p>Federer will end 2019 as the No. 3 player in the world behind rivals Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic, both of whom are closing in fast on Federer’s all-time men’s mark of 20 majors. Nadal won the French Open and U.S. Open in 2019 to get to 19, while Djokovic captured the Australian Open and Wimbledon to move to 16. Nadal, 33, could tie and surpass his Swiss rival in 2020.</p>
      <p>“If the family is happy and healthy, that needs to be the case,” Federer said of his plans beyond 2020. “If my wife feels the same way, that is important because happy wife, happy life. You know how that works so it starts there. And then the body and the results.</p>
      <p>“It’s going to come down to that. Usually I don’t think over a year and a half ahead of time. I usually think a year ahead of time or a year and a little bit.”</p>
      <p>Federer currently has 103 career titles, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamzagoria/2019/10/27/roger-federer-wins-10th-swiss-open-crown-career-title-no-103/">having captured title No. 103 at his hometown Swiss Open in October</a>. He’s now six behind Jimmy Connors’ all-time men’s mark of 109. The pursuit of that mark could also motivate him to play beyond 2020.</p>
      <p>Federer just completed an exhibition tour of North and South America that reportedly earned him approximately $10 million. More than 42,000 fans watched on Saturday as Federer beat Alexander Zverev in three sets in the Plaza de Toros, a bull ring in Mexico City. On Sunday, Federer beat the German again in the Ruminahui Coliseum in Ecuador.</p>

      <p>“I’m looking forward to vacation after this,” a slightly tired-looking Federer said Monday. “It’s been an incredible last few weeks with so many emotions and so many great moments in Latin America, Mexico. It was a once in a lifetime. After this I gotta regroup, reset, train hard in the off-season and get ready for what’s next.”</p>
      <p>After the Australian Open in January, Federer will meet Nadal in an exhibition in Capetown, South Africa.</p>
      <p>“I’m excited about the match I have Feb. 7 in Cape Town where we’re going to be playing in front of 48,000 people,” he said. “I’m going to play that with Rafa. That’s obviously very exciting for me as well.”</p>
      <p>In several recent years, Federer has opted to skip the clay court season to rest his body for the grass, but he returned to play the French Open in 2019 and reached the semifinals before losing to Nadal in straight sets. He then went on to beat Nadal in the Wimbledon semifinals before blowing a double-match point in the final against Djokovic for what would have been his 21st career major.</p>
      <p>Now he plans to play all four majors, including Roland Garros again in 2020 but says he’ll play a more limited clay schedule.</p>
      <p>“The schedule might look heavy but I think it’s a really balanced schedule which I think is going to work very well,” he said. “I’m confident about that.”</p>
      <p>“I’m going to play the clay again this year like last year,” he said. “I’m just not going to play the full clay court schedule. I’m going to take time again to rest and train before the big swing of the French, Wimbledon, and then the Olympics and the U.S. Open. I’m really looking forward to it. I hope I’m going to stay as injury free as this year because it was a lot of fun playing this way because I just felt good and then when you feel good, you just play good as well.”</p>
      <p>Having missed the 2016 Olympics with a knee injury, Federer is especially excited to play the Tokyo Olympics next summer. He has won an Olympic gold medal in doubles but never in singles.</p>
      <p>“I’m very excited to be playing in the Olympics again,” he said. “I missed the Rio Olympics in 16 because of my knee. I played the three Olympics before that.</p>
      <p>“It’s always been special for me to go to. Tokyo, it’s no different.”</p>
      <p>Federer was asked by a Japanese journalist whether he might don the On sneakers at the Olympics. For now the company has not yet announced a tennis sneaker but that may soon change. Federer dropped his Nike sponsorship in 2018 and hasn’t had a shoe deal since.</p>
      <p>“About tennis shoes, we have talked about but we can’t really share anything about that,” he said. “May be in the works, may be not. May be happening, may be not. It’s a secret, let’s be honest.”</p>
