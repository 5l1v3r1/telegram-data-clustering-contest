      <p>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) - Forecasters say a winter snowstorm could muddle Thanksgiving travel plans in southern Minnesota.</p>
      <p>Up to 6 inches of snow is expected to begin falling Tuesday afternoon followed by strong winds on Wednesday. Minnesota Department of Transportation spokesman Jake Loesch tells the Star Tribune the agency has more than 800 snowplows ready to go and plenty of salt to make state roads safer.</p>
      <p>The National Weather Service issued a winter storm watch for Tuesday night and Wednesday morning for the southern Minnesota. Meteorologists say another winter storm could develop after Thanksgiving into the weekend. But they say it’s too soon to tell whether that system will bring rain, snow or a mix.</p>
