      <p>Former President John Mahama has encouraged Ghanaians to treasure the religious tolerance prevailing in the country.</p>
      <p>According to Mr Mahama, the peaceful coexistence of different religious believes and groupings is a unique gift God has given Ghana and should not be taken for granted.</p>
      <p>Mr Mahama said this when he worshipped with the congregation of Adutor EP Church, Ghana, in the South Tongu Constituency of the Volta Region on Sunday, 24 November 2019 on the occasion of the church’s-75th-anniversary.</p>
      <p>A philanthropist, Mama Adesi Gidi, was honoured for her Christian charity.</p>
      <p>The Adutor EP Chapel and a new pastor’s residence were both built and donated to the church by her.</p>
      <p>The moderator of the EP Church, Rev. Dr. Seth Senyo Agidi, was apreached at the ceremony.</p>
