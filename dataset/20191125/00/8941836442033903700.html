      <p>JOHANNESBURG (AP) - South Africa’s president says a project to reopen unsolved sexual offenses cases soon will be rolled out across the country, and he calls violence against women and children “a great shame on our nation.”</p>
      <p>More than 2,700 women were murdered in South Africa last year, and more than 1,000 children. More than 100 rapes are reported every day.</p>
      <p>President Cyril Ramaphosa spoke Monday during the launch of 16 days of activism for an issue on which he says South Africans “have lost our way.”</p>
      <p>He says the government is on track in implementing a six-month emergency action plan that was announced after angry nationwide protests following the rape and murder of a university student in Cape Town.</p>
