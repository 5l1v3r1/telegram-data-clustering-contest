      <p>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) - A judge has ruled that it isn’t unconstitutional for Missouri health officials to encourage families to vaccinate their children in a form they must complete to get a religious exemption.</p>
      <p>KCUR reports that Senior U.S. District Judge Howard Sachs wrote in Friday’s ruling that the state’s freedom to advocate vaccination as governmental policy is “well settled.”</p>
      <p>The lawsuit was filed by Linus Baker, who is the grandfather of a student at Crossroads Academy in Kansas City. He also is representing families from Bates, Christian and Miller counties.</p>
      <p>Baker says he disagrees with the ruling. Sachs deferred the ruling until Dec. 16 to give the Bakers a chance to secure an exemption.</p>
      <p>Baker also has sued in Kansas to keep from having to vaccinate his son. That case is pending.</p>
