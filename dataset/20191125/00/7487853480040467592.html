      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.90min.com/users/15405988" target="_blank">Kaya Kaynak</a></address>
      <p>​Manchester City can guarantee their progress into the next round of the Champions League with a victory over Shakhtar Donetsk at the Etihad on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>Pep Guardiola's side currently sit five points clear of second placed Shakhtar at the top of Group C despite having to put Kyle Walker in goal during their 1-1 draw with Atalanta last time out.</p>

      <p>They have had a mixed start to the Premier League season, currently sitting third, nine points off leaders <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/liverpool">​Liverpool</a>, but advancing in Europe would definitely be a morale boost.</p>
      <p>Although they'll be favourites to do that on Tuesday, Shakhtar are no minnows, and City will have to be at their best to overcome the team with a 13 point lead at the top of Ukrainian Premier League.</p>

      <p>All three of <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/manchester-city">​Manchester City</a>'s substitutions in <a href="https://www.90min.com/posts/6503278-manchester-city-2-1-chelsea-report-ratings-reaction-as-vibrant-citizens-earn-crucial-victory">​Saturday's 2-1 victory</a> over <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/chelsea">​Chelsea</a> were forced by injury, meaning Pep Guardiola's lengthy injury list is set to expand.</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/barca">​Barcelona</a> and <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/bayern">​Bayern Munich</a> manager said that the injury to <a href="https://www.90min.com/players/sergio-aguero">​Sergio Aguero</a> was 'bad', and hinted that the Argentinian could face a lengthy spell out, while <a href="https://www.90min.com/players/david-silva">​David Silva</a> and Rodri also picked up muscle problems during the game.</p>
      <p>They join Oleksandr Zinchenko, Leroy Sané and Aymeric Laporte in the treatment room, while <a href="https://www.90min.com/players/claudio-bravo">​Claudio Bravo</a> is suspended for the red card he picked up against Atalanta. <a href="https://www.90min.com/players/bernardo-silva">​Bernardo Silva</a> is available though after serving his suspension for a tweet relating to <a href="https://www.90min.com/players/benjamin-mendy">​Benjamin Mendy</a>.</p>

      <p>Despite their impressive domestic form, the visitors have long term injuries of their own to the likes of Andrii Totovytski, Maksym Malyshev, Oleksandr Pikhalionok and Manor Solomon.</p>
      <p>They will also be without key forward Marlos who will miss the game due to suspension. Midfielder Alan Patrick is also suspended.</p>

      <p>Three things have been certain in recent years; death, taxes and Manchester City playing Shakhtar Donetsk in the Champions League group stages. This is the third season in a row that the two have drawn each other.​</p>
      <p>City won the two games last year 9-0 on aggregate (3-0 away and 6-0 at home), and have already racked up a 3-0 victory in Ukraine this time around.</p>
      <p>Shakhtar did beat the Pep Guardiola side that claimed 100 points in the Premier League 2-1 back in 2017, showing that the English champions can't allow themselves to get too comfortable.</p>

      <p>Liverpool's ridiculously consistent start to the season means that City find themselves nine points behind the European champions already in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>Saturday's victory over Chelsea was their fourth in five games and they'll need to keep up that sort of form if they have any hope of retaining their domestic crown.</p>

      <p>Shakhtar meanwhile sit 13 points clear already at the top of the Ukrainian league, which they have won for the past three seasons in a row.</p>
      <p>They played out two thrilling draws with Dynamo Zagreb to give themselves a good chance of qualifying for the next round of the Champions League, but an unexpected win in Manchester would even more beneficial.</p>
      <p>Here's how the two have fared in the last five matches...​</p>

      <p>Despite a lengthy injury list Manchester City will be firm favourites to secure a comfortable home victory.</p>
      <p>Their strength in depth means they're well equipped to deal with problems in any position, and they should be too strong for Shakhtar.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Prediction: Manchester 3-0 Shakhtar Donetsk</b>
