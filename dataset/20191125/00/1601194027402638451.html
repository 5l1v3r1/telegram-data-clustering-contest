      <p>Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Carson Wentz said he is not worried about the hand issue sustained in a loss against the Seattle Seahawks.</p>
      <p>Wentz hurt his right hand as the Eagles were beaten 17-9 by the high-flying Seahawks in NFL action on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Eagles head coach Doug Pederson revealed Wentz's X-rays came back negative post-game.</p>
      <p>While Wentz is set for further tests, the under-fire Eagles QB is not worried.</p>
      <p>"I don't think so," Wentz replied when asked if there was anything to be concerned about. "But obviously we'll wait and see."</p>

      <p>It was another rough outing for Wentz as the Eagles fell to 5-6 – losing further ground to the Dallas Cowboys in the NFC East.</p>
      <p>Wentz finished 33 of 45 for 256 yards, a touchdown and four turnovers – two interceptions and two lost fumbles.</p>
      <p>"I have to be better. I have to lead this football team better. I have to protect the football better. I can't put it on the ground the way we did," Wentz said.</p>
      <p>"It starts with me. It starts with me and I'm frustrated. I know everyone's frustrated with this loss offensively."</p>
