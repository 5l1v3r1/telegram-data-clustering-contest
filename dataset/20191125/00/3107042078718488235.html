      <p>Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern is at home recovering from her wisdom tooth operation and is understood to have significant swelling the right side of her jaw.</p>
      <p>"The Prime Minister is working from home for now but is doing fine," a spokeswoman told the <i>New Zealand Herald</i>.</p>
      <p>Ardern had an operation on an impacted wisdom tooth on Friday night and will miss today's Cabinet meeting.</p>
      <p>But she is still hoping to attend a Council of Trade Unions event in Auckland tomorrow night.</p>
      <p>Last week, Ardern told reporters that she has had issues with her wisdom teeth for three years and was about to have an operation to remove one more.</p>
      <p>"I apologise. That's more detail than any of you would have liked – and more than I'd like to share, but I didn't want to start any speculation," she told reporters unprompted a week ago.</p>
      <p>She did not say how much the operation was going to cost, but added that she had not yet had a final quote – "I know that it will be reasonable".</p>
      <p>The surgery will affect a part of the bone in her jaw, she said, adding that she had been advised that she should be off work for "several days".</p>
      <p>Ardern also confirmed that there was not, in fact, a special dental clinic for prime ministers in New Zealand.</p>
      <p>"Despite the fact that I've had plenty of commentary – more than others probably about my dentistry over the years – I just go to the dentist like anyone else."</p>
      <p>Asked if it was too expensive for people to have their wisdom teeth removed, Ardern said accessing dental work in general in New Zealand is an issue.</p>
      <p>"Every time I go to the dentist, I reflect on that.</p>
      <p>"But as we [the Government] have said, we actually have a number of areas where we know we need to make the health system – and that includes [making] public health – more accessible."</p>
      <p>But she said it's all a matter of how the Government is able to prioritise making those parts of the health care system more accessible.</p>
