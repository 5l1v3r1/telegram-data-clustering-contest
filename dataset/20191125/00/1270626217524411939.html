      <p>Minister of Health and Medical Services, Dr Ifereimi Waqainabete confirms that the extra 200,000 measles vaccines will arrive this week.</p>
      <p>He says the Ministry knows that some health centres have limited stock of measles shot, which will only be used for people travelling overseas, those travelling to Serua/Namosi subdivision and children who are 4 months to 3-years-old.</p>
      <p>Dr Waqainabete had stated in Parliament that they are waiting for the vaccines from Europe and it should be arriving this week.</p>
      <p>He adds that the confirmed cases of measles in Fiji is still at 10 but there have been suspected cases around the country and their staff are working tirelessly to control the spread of the disease.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the Ministry of Health had said in a statement, the measles vaccine is in limited supply and they say they would like to inform the public that there is an interim shortage of the measles vaccine.</p>
      <p>They add, for this reason, the remaining measles vaccine stock will be prioritized to those who are at the greatest risk of catching and spreading measles and it is not available for the general public until additional stocks arrive in the coming days.</p>
      <p>The Ministry says current stocks are being reserved for the following high-risk target groups the residents of Serua/Namosi, children from the ages of 6 months to 3 years and people travelling overseas, however proof of travel must be shown i.e. ticket/travel itinerary, not just a passport.</p>
      <p>It says the routine immunisation of children at 12 and 18 months of age will continue as per the national immunisation schedule.</p>
      <p>The Ministry adds the only exceptions to those in the above groups are pregnant women, those with compromised immune systems, and those with a known allergy to the vaccine.</p>
      <p>These people should not be vaccinated.</p>
