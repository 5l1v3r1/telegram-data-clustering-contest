      <p>WWE Survivor Series 2019 featured a surprisingly strong night from NXT as the black and yellow brand picked up four interpromotional victories—topping Friday Night SmackDown (2) and Raw (1)—and showed well in its lone defeat on the main show. Both Brock Lesnar and Rey Mysterio retained their world championships while match of the night honors most likely went to Adam Cole, who also retained his world title in an NXT Championship match against Pete Dunn.</p>
      <p>With all three brands featured, SmackDown’s viewership was up this past week with 2.600 million viewers.</p>

        <b>WWE Survivor Series 2019 Results: Sunday, November 24, 2019</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Team NXT (Bianca Belair, Rhea Ripley, Io Shirai, Toni Storm and Candace LeRae) def. Team Raw (Charlotte Flair, Asuka, Kairi Sane, Natalya and Sarah Logan) vs. Team SmackDown (Sasha Banks, Dana Brooke, Nikki Cross, Lacey Evans and Carmella)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Considering the tag team three-way elimination match took 45 minutes, it was relieving to know all 15 of these Superstars didn’t receive their own entrance.</p>
      <p>The lack of brand-specific t-shirts was an encouraging sign for this pay-per-view.</p>
      <p>The fact that a pay-per-view crowd is dominated with "NXT" chants tells you</p>
      <ol>
        <li>WWE is in a hot city</li>
        <li>WWE’s audience has shrunk exponentially</li>
      </ol>
      <p>As NXT’s Io Shirai and Raw’s Kairi Sane stared each other down, SmackDown’s Carmella screamed to be noticed, which is the opposite of how WWE treats those three shows.</p>
      <p>For a company where injuries are so common, WWE is terrible at fake injury spots.</p>
      <p>When it comes to fake injuries, WWE needs to follow the exact injury protocol it has for real-life injuries, and if the fake injury coincidentally turns out to be real, use a safe word.</p>
      <p>Nobody will say this, but I will, Carmella was brilliant in this match.</p>
      <p>One match in, WWE already had its first dissension spot.</p>
      <p>So many Superstars leaving the match without being pinned saved at least 10 minutes.</p>
      <p>Rhea Ripley being terrified of a Triple Threat with Raw and SmackDown star, and refusing to get in the ring until it was one-on-one, is a sequence that may have ruined Rhea Ripley for me.</p>
      <p>If this were the NFL, and the Cowboys lost a Survivor Series match because members of the other team returned late, that rule would have been changed in the offseason and the Cowboys would have still gone on to not make the Super Bowl.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Roderick Strong def. AJ Styles vs. Shinsuke Nakamura</b>
      </p>
      <p>The winner of this match will earn prime real estate atop Midcard Mountain.</p>
      <p>In an alternate universe, this match headlines Wrestle Kingdom 15.</p>
      <p>I popped huge when I heard Shinsuke Nakamura's music because I knew he'd have that <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alfredkonuwa/2019/11/22/wwe-friday-night-smackdown-results-news-and-notes-after-reveal-of-new-intercontinental-title/#7858ff438b4d">beautiful new Intercontinental Title</a> with him.</p>
      <p>With the otherwise talented Nigel McGuinness subbing for otherworldly Mauro Ranallo, Corey Graves became an even bigger heel on Twitter.</p>
      <p>While Nigel McGuinness excitedly marveled at this match, Jerry Lawler advised him to take it easy and “quit yelling at me!” which sounded like a direct order from Vince McMahon.</p>
      <p>These fans had no idea whom to root for in this match so they just resorted to chanting “both (or all?) these guys!”</p>
      <p>Sami Zayn was briefly seen on camera leading Shinsuke Nakamura in a recuperative breathing exercise. I love Sami Zayn.</p>
      <p>Surprisingly enough, this Internet Darling Exhibition was the first match to be punished with chants of “CM Punk!”</p>
      <p>
        <b>Adam Cole def. Pete Dunne—WWE NXT Championship</b>
      </p>
      <p>"Mauro blew his voice out" is the new "<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2019/10/22/jussie-smollett-chicago-lawsuit-actor-still-facing-130-k-civil-suit/4000512002/">Two Nigerians attacked me and screamed 'This is MAGA country!</a>'"</p>
      <p>This poor match was likely railroaded by the start of a huge Sunday Night Football game between the Green Bay Packers and the San Francisco 49ers.</p>
      <p>This match was filled with finishers and nearfalls.</p>
      <p>Adam Cole is the master of the super kick to a wrestler mid-moonsault.</p>
      <p>Cole and Dunne battling injuries from last night is a rare batch of great storyline continuity from WWE, even if just for 24 hours.</p>
      <p>
        <b>“The Fiend” Bray Wyatt def. Daniel Bryan—WWE Universal Championship</b>
      </p>
      <p>The announcers were solemnly wondering about the “change of the atmosphere” as if everybody else couldn’t see the red lighting in the building.</p>
      <p>“The damn thing’s back on its feet!” was actually a great call by Michael Cole.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Team Raw (Seth Rollins, Drew McIntyre, Kevin Owens, Randy Orton, and Ricochet) def. Team NXT (Tommaso Ciampa, Damian Priest, Matt Riddle, Keith Lee, and Walter) and Team SmackDown (Roman Reigns, Braun Strowman, King Corbin, Mustafa Ali, and Shorty G)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Between SmackDown’s dissension issues and Raw being the B-Show, this match appeared to have another NXT win written all over it.</p>
      <p>Of all the NXT stars who went toe-to-toe with Randy Orton, Damian Priest was the only one who wasn’t completely dwarfed by him.</p>
      <p>Matt Riddle was eliminated by Baron Corbin but not before getting the biggest pinfall of his career over Randy Orton, and not before being RKO’d by Orton immediately after.</p>
      <p>You’d be surprised at the amount of boos when main roster stars were eliminated.</p>
      <p>The fact that a pay-per-view crowd has not forgotten those “STD” chants is a terrible sign for Baron Corbin.</p>
      <p>The two-man Shield bomb not only looked sad but it’s just baiting these fans into chanting for AEW’s Jon Moxley.</p>
      <p>Keith Lee pinning Seth Rollins felt like Twitter pinning Seth Rollins.</p>
      <p>With Keith Lee standing in the ring with Roman Reigns, fans defaulted to 2015 and wildly cheered a Roman Reigns opponent.</p>
      <p>The finish of this match was compromised from the referee accidentally counting the three after Reigns kicked out.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Brock Lesnar def. Rey Mysterio—WWE Championship</b>
      </p>
      <p>The women headlining #SurvivorSeries is a pleasant surprise but I can't help but feel that Brock went on early because he impatiently checked his watch.</p>
      <p>If anybody deserved pyro, it’s Rey Mysterio in 2019.</p>
      <p>I simply can’t remember the last time I was this excited about a WWE Championship match.</p>
      <p>If Dominic (and that white towel) didn't know who MJF was, he's about to find out all about it from the bottom of Twitter.</p>
      <p>Rey Mysterio and Dominic’s last-minute fury felt like pro wrestling adrenaline.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Shayna Baszler def. Becky Lynch and Bayley</b>
      </p>
      <p>Given how dead the crowd was for much of this match, if a Ronda Rousey surprise appearance isn’t at the end of this, then this was a huge mistake.</p>
      <p>These women weren’t only battling each other, they were battling NXT TakeOver: War Games and the entire Survivor Series card to this point.</p>
      <p>This match needed a table bump long before it happened, and when it happened, the table didn’t even break.</p>
      <p>NXT wins the night at Survivor Series. AEW shouldn’t be nervous, but the worldwide leader is taking this Wednesday Night war very seriosly.</p>
