      <p>Zamalek coach Milutin Sredovic "Micho" is struggling to put his squad against Enppi in the sixth round of the Egyptian league, only in the midfielder's positions. <br/><br/>Tarek Hamed and Mahmoud Abdel Aziz are out for injury, and Ferjani Sassi is suspended, so Micho is expected to turn to Ahmed Sayed Zizou in midfield. <br/><br/>Micho prefers the logical solution: Mohamed Hassan, who has played for Zamalek only three times since joining him last season, and calling Hazem Imam, the right-back to participate in the midfield next to Zizo. <br/><br/>Thus, the formation of Zamalek is expected .. <br/><br/>Goalkeepers: Mohamed Awad <br/><br/>Defense: Hamdi Nagguez - Mahmoud Alaa - Mahmoud Hamdi "Al Wench" - Mohammed Abdel Shafi <br/><br/>Center: Ahmed Sayed "Zizo" - Mohamed Hassan (Hazem Imam) - Karim Bambu - Imam Ashour - Mohamed Onagem <br/><br/>Attack: Omar Said <br/><br/>Zamalek is in the second place with 10 points from four matches, while Enppi are bottom of the table with one point from five games.</p>
