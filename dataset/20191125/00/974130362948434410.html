      <h1>Report: Caoimhin Kelleher Could Leave Liverpool On Loan In January</h1>

      <p>Caoimhin Kelleher is an exciting prospect, with the 21-year old highly thought of by those at Liverpool. He has made two appearances for the first team this season, coming in the League Cup wins over MK Dons and Arsenal.</p>
      <p>While Klopp's side did concede five in that game against The Gunners, it was Kelleher's heroics in the penalty shootout that ensured their passage into the quarter finals.</p>
      <p>The Cork native has also been very impressive at international level, establishing himself as a key member of Stephen Kenny's U21 side. He is incredibly comfortable with the ball at his feet, something that has proven crucial in implementing Kenny's attacking style of play.</p>
      <p>While the League Cup appearances were a big moment in his career, you suspect that some consistent first team football will be the next step in his development.</p>
      <p>The <i>Liverpool Echo</i> <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/liverpools-plan-rhian-brewster-revealed-17310894">are reporting</a> that Jurgen Klopp would be willing to let the player leave on loan in January, with a move to the Championship most likely. Preston are believed to be keen on the goalkeeper, with other clubs would no doubt show an interest were he to become available.</p>
      <p>Kelleher is third in the pecking order at Liverpool, sitting well behind Alisson Becker and Adrian. He is likely to feature in the Carabao Cup quarter final against Aston Villa next month, with the majority of the first team squad missing that game due to the Club World Cup in Qatar.</p>
      <p>While half a season of regular football would be huge for his development and Liverpool would likely seek assurances about regular playing time in any potential deal.</p>
      <p>Stephen Kenny would be also be keen to see the player improve with first team football, as Ireland attempt to qualify for a first U21 European Championships.</p>
