      <p>James scored 30 points on 27 shot attempts Saturday night in Los Angeles’ 109-108 road win against the Memphis Grizzlies, but didn’t attempt a single free throw.</p>

      <p>Per <i><a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/lakers/story/2019-11-24/lakers-to-talk-to-nba-about-officiating-lebron-james">The LA Times</a></i>:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>“He’s in the paint all night long and, look, it’s just something that we’ll go through the proper channels and talk to the league office about it,” Lakers coach Frank Vogel said. “But certainly, when your guy’s attacking the basket the way he is and getting zero free-throw attempts, it’s something that can be frustrating, but we’ve got to look past that. Like everything, we’ll deal with the proper channels and talk to the league about that.”<br/></i>
        <br/>
        <i>James scored 30 points while taking 27 shots, with nine of them three-pointers. And he didn’t get to shoot a single free throw.<br/></i>
        <br/>
        <i>“I’m living in the paint, and if you look at my arm right here, these are four or five [scratches] that happened the last two games, and they weren’t called at all,” James said. “And it’s not me just going to the hole, going to the basket. But that can’t stop me. It didn’t stop me tonight.<br/></i>
        <br/>
        <i>“No matter what, I got to continue to go, but being able to get to the free-throw line is something that allows our defense to get in good position. It sets our defense. It slows the game down at times. It gives us a good rhythm. It relaxes me as well. So, I know I’m getting hit, but at the end of the day I just got to keep going.”</i>
