      <p>Are you a business owner who has invested literally everything you have in your business? All of your time, all of your energy, all of your finances, literally everything? You are at the top, you have nowhere else to go. You know you are running on empty but you can’t change things. You know that someday something will crash down but you don’t have time to change things now. </p>
      <p>Do you have so many things to attend to that you simply know that you cannot do it all? But you are far too busy to figure out how to do things differently, never mind actually make the change that you need? And invariably it is your family that has to give. Because you all rely on the business. </p>
      <p>Do you feel like you are holding on so tight that if one thing falls over, all of it will come tumbling down like a house of cards?</p>
      <p>For many who own their own businesses, it can be a constant struggle between keeping everything afloat at work and being there at home and having time to look after your health, so that the whole thing doesn’t go down the plug hole. </p>
      <p>Let me ask you this.. </p>
      <p>How many times have you had dinner with your family in the last week? How many times have you been able to exercise in the last month? And how many times has there been conflict in your personal life, because of your workload?</p>
      <p>Being too busy to change things is a common excuse. “I’ll wait until X is over.” “I’ll start fresh in the new year.” “There’s no time to sit back and figure things out.” “No one would understand the pressures I am under, from every angle.” “My wife just doesn’t get it.” “My husband doesn’t understand.” Etc Etc. The same reasons over and over.</p>
      <p>How many of these things ring true to you?</p>
      <p>And do you know that it is all fixable, just by having the right conversations with the right people? Sometimes it just takes a conversation, with someone who is outside your situation, for you to gain true clarity, a plan of attack and a changed life. So please, if this has resonated with you – take a moment. Send me a message and we can have a chat. See how you CAN make that change, before it is too late. </p>
