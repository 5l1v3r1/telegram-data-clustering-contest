      <h1>Attorney general: Israel’s Netanyahu not required to resign</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Ilan Ben Zion</a></address>
      <p>JERUSALEM (AP) — <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/israel/">Israel</a>’s attorney general said Monday that Prime Minister <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/benjamin-netanyahu/">Benjamin Netanyahu</a> is not required to leave office following his indictment on corruption charges, giving a small boost to the embattled leader.</p>
      <p>Avichai Mandelblit said in a statement that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/benjamin-netanyahu/">Netanyahu</a> can remain interim prime minister, just days after serving him with charges of fraud, breach of trust and bribery.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/benjamin-netanyahu/">Netanyahu</a> faces calls from his opponents to step down following the indictment. Mandelblit’s opinion confirmed what had been a consensus legal view, that an indicted prime minister may remain in office while fighting criminal charges.</p>
      <p>Israeli law requires other public officials, including Cabinet ministers, to resign if charged with a crime. But it doesn’t explicitly state that a prime minister has to leave office in those circumstances.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/benjamin-netanyahu/">Netanyahu</a> is the first-ever sitting prime minister to be charged with a crime.</p>

      <p>The attorney general did not weigh in on whether <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/benjamin-netanyahu/">Netanyahu</a> could keep his other ministerial positions while under indictment. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/benjamin-netanyahu/">Netanyahu</a> also holds the agriculture, labor and welfare, health and Diaspora affairs portfolios.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/benjamin-netanyahu/">Netanyahu</a>, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/israel/">Israel</a>’s longest serving prime minister, has dismissed the charges as an “attempted coup” and refused to resign. He says he will fight the charges from the prime minister’s office.</p>
      <p>The indictment comes at a delicate time following the failure by both <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/benjamin-netanyahu/">Netanyahu</a> and his chief rival, former military chief Benny Gantz, to secure a parliamentary majority and form a new government.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/israel/">Israel</a> has held two parliamentary elections this year — in April and in September — both of which resulted in political deadlock, with neither <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/benjamin-netanyahu/">Netanyahu</a> nor Gantz capable of mustering support for a ruling coalition.</p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p>Last week Gantz conceded he was unable to form a government, setting in motion a 21-day period for a majority of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/israel/">Israel</a>’s 120-seat parliament to throw support behind Gantz, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/benjamin-netanyahu/">Netanyahu</a> or a third candidate.</p>
        <p>If a government is not formed by Dec. 11, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/israel/">Israel</a> will be forced to hold elections for the third time in a 12-month period.</p>
        <p>The Justice Ministry said the attorney general did not evaluate the legality of whether the president could task an indicted politician with forming a new government, which he said remained “theoretical.”</p>
