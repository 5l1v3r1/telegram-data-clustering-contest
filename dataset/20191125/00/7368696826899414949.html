Headlining the developer’s financial report is none-other than Cyberpunk 2077 development.</p>
      <blockquote>The third quarter of the year was dominated by further intensive development and promotion of Cyberpunk, which has now entered its most crucial, final stage of creation. We have begun internal and external testing of the game and started to localize its content into each supported language. We are also ramping up our global promotional campaign.<br/><br/>In late August, we took part in Gamescom in Cologne – the largest European gaming industry event, where we ran presentations of Cyberpunk for over 12 thousand participants. Besides Gamescom, our newest videogame universe was also showcased at key industry fairs throughout the world.</blockquote>
