      <p>IOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) - Iowa sophomore forward Jack Nune is out for the season after tearing the ACL in his right knee.</p>
      <p>Nunge suffered the injury while driving to the basket late in the first half of Sunday’s 85-59 win over Cal Poly. Nunge sat out the rest of the game, and an MRI later showed the injury.</p>
      <p>The 6-foot-11 Nunge was averaging 6 points and 4.6 rebounds per game. Nunge redshirted in 2018-19 after playing as a freshman, and the Indiana native will likely seek a medical redshirt to preserve the three seasons of eligibility he has left.</p>
      <p>The Hawkeyes play Texas Tech on Thursday in Las Vegas, with senior Ryan Kriener expected to take Nunge’s spot in the starting lineup.</p>
