      <h2>After a rain-affected test in Jerez, a handful of riders finally completed laps in their brand-new 2020 colours</h2>

      <p>The first day of testing for the Moto2™ and Moto3™ classes in Valencia took place today with a handful of riders in both the intermediate and lightweight classes getting their first opportunity to lap in their new 2020 colours after a rain-affected two-day test at the Circuito de Jerez - Angel Nieto last week.</p>

      <p>Aron Canet got his first taste of Moto2™ on home soil after exiting pitlane aboard the Angel Nieto Team's Speed Up machine. After finishing 2019 as the Moto3™ World Championship runner-up, the Valencian said this about his first day in the intermediate class: “Speed ​​Up is a very fun bike to ride and very different from Moto3. The weight distribution is very different, the entrance into the corner with the wider tyres is also different."</p>

      <p>Also in the intermediate class today we saw Augusto Fernández in the EG 0,0 Marc VDS box for the first time along with his new teammate, Briton's Sam Lowes. As a result of Fernandez taking the seat left absent by Alex Marquez over the weekend, it means Sito Pons is looking for a teammate to Lorenzo Baldasarri in the FlexBox HP40 garage, with Hector Garzo spotted on the bike today in Valencia. Meanwhile, the Federal Oil Gresini squad were busy with Italian Nicoló Bulega and Spaniard Edgar Pons both making their debuts.</p>

      <p>In Moto3™, Raul Fernandez has his first laps aboard the Red Bull KTM Ajo machine. Japanese rookies Yuki Kunii and Ryusei Yamanaka started their 2020 preparations with the Honda Team Asia and Estrella Galicia 0,0 teams. Yamanaka's new teammate, and Valencia GP winner, Sergio Garcia had two minor crashes today, whilst VNE Snipers' Tony Arbolino also had a small crash.</p>
