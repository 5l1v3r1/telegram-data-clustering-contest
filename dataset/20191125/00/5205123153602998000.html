      <p>The charity removed the farm gate from its hinges to free the horse and attempted to treat her injuries.</p>
      <p>They eventually removed the horse from the field - receiving help from locals as well as the fire brigade - and brought in a vet in order to try and save her, but sadly she didn't make it.</p>
      <p>"The fact that she was stuck in under there for hours was just horrible," added Kenny.</p>
      <p>The cost estimation for the organisation to cover the vet and removal is around €300-€400.</p>
      <p>"We don’t mind paying, we just wish we had gotten there sooner to save her," said Kenny.</p>
