      <p>Marco Verratti looks set to make his Paris Saint-Germain comeback after being included in an extended squad for the Champions League clash with Real Madrid.</p>
      <p>PSG visit the Santiago Bernabeu on Tuesday knowing a point will be enough to sew up top spot in Group A.</p>
      <p>Thomas Tuchel's men have already sealed progression to the knockout rounds and could welcome back midfielder Verratti in the Spanish capital.</p>
      <p>The Italy international has been named in a 22-man group after undergoing rehabilitation on a knee injury suffered in the Ligue 1 win at Brest on November 9.</p>
      <p>Star forward Neymar returned from a hamstring issue in Friday's 2-0 victory over Lille, while Kylian Mbappe was involved as a second-half substitute after overcoming illness.</p>
      <p>Both players are in the squad to face Madrid, who lost 3-0 when the teams met in Paris in September.</p>
      <p>Ander Herrera, Thilo Kehrer, Layvin Kurzawa and Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting are all unavailable.</p>
