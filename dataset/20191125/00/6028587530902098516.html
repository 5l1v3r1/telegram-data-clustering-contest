      <h1>By Ending Food Waste, We Could Feed 10 Billion People</h1>

      <p><b><i>By Dr. Marc Teerlink, Global Vice President, SAP | Intelligent Enterprise Solutions</i></b>In the DC, Maryland and Virginia area, a single mother with two children has an average six dollars left for their daily dinner. Ironically, buying processed food will cost her less than creating a healthy meal. </p>
      <p>At the same time, within the US, one of the richest nations in the world, on average, we throw away 40% of the food we buy. That’s almost $400 per person, per year.</p>
      <p>To reflect on these numbers at a global scale, consider that the United Nations notes that annually <a href="http://www.fao.org/food-loss-and-food-waste/en/">1/3 of all food produced</a> for human consumption is lost or wasted.</p>
      <p>Here are a few of the more stunning facts about food waste:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Globally, forty-three million people cannot <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/food/safety/food_waste/stop_en">afford a quality meal</a> every other day.</li>
        <li>70% of food waste in Europe happens at the combined household, food service, and food retail level.</li>
        <li>Each year in the U.S., <a href="https://eatrightfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/The-State-of-Americas-Food-Waste-Report.pdf">50 billion pounds</a> of food is wasted by retailers, amounting to $47 billion dollars thrown out, even before that food has ever reached a household. </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>What causes food waste on a retail level?</h3>
      <p>Around the world, <a href="https://www.refed.com/downloads/ReFED_Report_2016.pdf">87% of retail food waste</a> is caused by perishable items. This is because food retailers have limited visibility into the daily demand for food that has a short shelf life.</p>
      <p>Typically they’re working with little to no external information, and zero mechanisms that can provide pinpoint accuracy into what - or how - to prepare. Meanwhile, there are ongoing suboptimal demand forecasts that cause waste or hurt sales.</p>
      <p>In other words, food waste around the world is both a supply chain and store management problem - one that can be greatly reduced by applying technology, specifically artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML).</p>
      <p>The goal is to take estimation out of the equation by leveraging demand forecasting. By harnessing the power of this technology, food retailers can optimize and predict demand, as well as get real-time insights so employees can act immediately, ultimately improving customer experience.</p>
      <h3>How AI and Machine Learning in Grocery Stores Can Help End Food Waste</h3>
      <p>Combining point-of-sale, marketing, and external events (such as weather, events, or road maintenance) we can quickly help to optimize and predict demand.</p>
      <p>For instance, say you – a food retailer – have stocked raspberries in your store. Raspberries have one of the shortest spoilage times, meaning you are always racing to sell them quickly. Using AI, you can extend that deadline by providing optimal conditions for the raspberries, maximizing their shelf life.</p>
      <p>A real-life example: based on humidity and temperature, especially considering that raspberries sit near the entrance in many grocery chains, you can optimize the raspberries environment with cool mist sprayers, light, or temperature changes to keep the fruit longer given the surrounding elements.</p>
      <p>That sort of technology is available today, and people regularly use it in their homes: air quality monitoring, weather forecasting, temperature, and humidity adjustments. The difference is that AI applies each treatment very specially to your different fruit and vegetable sections.</p>
      <h3>AI Isn’t Enough: To End Food Waste, You Need to Enable Employees</h3>
      <p>AI systems like intelligent mist sprayers or sprinklers that can sense external and internal environments and are then programmed to the needs of a particular fruit or vegetable section are one thing. Enabling employees to improve the customer experience beyond waste reduction for the store is another - and it matters - a lot.</p>
      <p>One way to empower staff is with the use of SKU-specific smart labels. During the day AI will orchestrate a technique called “reinforcement learning” to adjust the sales price of perishables with a specific sell-by-date, whilst displaying the normal sales price for items with a later sell-by-date. This not only optimizes product quality, but also avoids blind, progressive discounting, creating a win/win through pro-active zero waste.  </p>
      <p>A recent example of in-store robotic tech involves sensors on the robot. When the robot goes through fresh produce, it can spot the gases being emitted by the fruits and vegetables.</p>
      <p>While these gases are invisible to humans, a sensor can spot which red apples are close to end of life. Store associates receive a message to review and apply changes through a price / display method. Those updates will trigger the retail app to suggest apple pie recipes as optimal for that day, as the quality of those apples will be suboptimal the following day.</p>
      <p>Automation can lend tremendous efforts to ending food waste, but the human element is crucial. Employees need to receive timely updates and to provide insights into actual stock on the shelf, as well as damaged and (almost) expired products from any mobile device or <a href="https://news.sap.com/2019/01/creating-intelligent-enterprise-retail/">instore robot</a>. Management teams need to be enabled with insights on actuals, forecasted sales, and potential and in-transit orders.</p>
      <p>When artificial intelligence is used to keep perishables longer, based on weather and foot traffic patterns, and staff operates with real-time insights, the result is a great reduction in food waste and measurably improved demand forecasting.</p>
      <h3>Saving $23 Million in Food Waste – A Single Case Study</h3>
      <p>If you think the idea of AI driving an end to food waste is just another “nice-in-theory” concept, think again. In a recent case study with a large retailer at their in-store bakery, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPAq9pc-qsY">there was a 23% reduction of waste</a> within the two pilot stores using only point-of-sale and weather data.</p>
      <p>The stores in the study previously had $100 million in annual food waste. AI saved them $23,000,000. Today the retailer is rolling out the program to hundreds of stores that touch many communities for sustainability, while being friendly to the retailer’s bottom-line.</p>
      <h3>Reducing Waste, Increasing Margin, Ending Hunger: Having It All Is Possible</h3>
      <p>From grocery to convenience stores to gas stations, there’s a lot of waste to cut, margin to maximize, and world to save.</p>
      <p>What if one quarter of the food lost or wasted globally was actually consumed instead of spoiled? It would be sufficient to feed 870 million people, 12% of the world’s current population, and more than 20X in excess of the goods we’d need for those 43 million people to get a quality meal every single day.</p>
      <p>We already grow enough food for 10 billion people. The food waste issue that continues to make hunger a world-wide problem can be reduced by applying technology that already exists. Less – not more – is good business.</p>
