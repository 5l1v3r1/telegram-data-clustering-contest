      <h1>Instead Of Framing Dora Maar As Picasso’s Muse, A New Tate Retrospective Shows Her Dazzling Surrealist Imagination</h1>

      <p>As Surrealism reached maturity in the 1930s, Surrealist artists faced a dilemma. “The artistic problem today,” wrote Surrealist leader André Breton, “consists of bringing mental representation to an even greater state of objective precision.” The dream world paradoxically needed to be materialized in order for the material world to be transcended. Dora Maar had a brilliant two-sided solution.Most famous as Pablo Picasso’s muse, and the subject of his iconic<i> Weeping Woman</i>, Maar is finally getting her due this month in a blockbuster <a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/dora-maar">Tate Modern retrospective</a> that shows her brilliance as an artist. In a career spanning nearly seven decades, Maar experimented prodigiously in both painting and photography. Her canvases encompassed both figuration and abstraction, and her photographic oeuvre ranged from erotically-charged fashion to urban documentation to cameraless shadowplay too ethereal for verbal description.</p>

      <p>But it was Surrealism that had the most resonance for her, and which she engaged most profoundly. As a photographer, Maar was well positioned to bring mental representation to a greater state of objectivity – at least apparently – because photographs had the appearance of representing objective reality. Moreover, her street photography provided her with a gritty documentary vernacular that she could combine with a capacity for gossamer fantasy learned from fashion.</p>
      <p>Maar’s first approach to materializing the dream world was to subtlely accentuate the everyday strangeness of the city through the optics of her camera. For instance, she used unconventional angles to distort proportions and truncate body parts, and she captured the uncanny qualities of shop-window mannequins through precise modulation of focus and reflection. Her eye for dreamy pictorial effects, combined with a street-smart photographic vernacular, made the impossible seem disconcertingly real.</p>
      <p>Maar’s observational Surrealism – which can be viewed as the photographic equivalent of the Surrealist found object – was matched by her compositional aplomb. Like other Surrealists, Maar used techniques including photomontage and rephotography to create strange scenes synthetically. These techniques were especially effective when combined and enhanced with darkroom mastery. By piecing together fragments of two or more photographs and rephotographing the results, Surrealist photographers could visualize figments of their imagination with almost as much freedom as painters. Maar engaged in striking juxtapositions (such as a human hand emerging from a seashell), which she imbued with the authority of a photograph that testified to the existence of such a creature in reality.</p>

      <p>Some of Maar’s inventions look less-than-convincing from the distance of nearly a century. Given our familiarity with Photoshop and fake news, we may be more sensitive to artifice than her original audience. Also Surrealism has been compressed over time into identifiable tropes, such as play with proportions, that have been with us so long that they read as clichés.</p>
      <p>But there are also images that still defy explanation – or require scientific research to demystify – such as Maar’s disturbing portrait of a baby armadillo. And many of the photographs that can be broken down rationally nevertheless retain their fascination. In fact they may be more fascinating today for the fact that we can simultaneously appreciate the mental images they represent and the ingenuity of their objective instantiation.</p>
