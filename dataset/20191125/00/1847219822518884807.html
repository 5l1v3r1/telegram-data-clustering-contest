        <b>In the Chinese semi-autonomous metropolis of Hong Kong, where large protests and violent clashes with police have continued since summer, local elections have been held. Close to 90% of mandates in the local power have been won by pro-democracy candidates.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/24/hong-kong-residents-turn-up-for-local-elections-in-record-numbers">British news portal The Guardian reports</a> that the elections were held on Sunday, November 24. People turned out in record numbers to eject pro-Beijing politicians from district councils they had controlled across the city. They held on to little over 10 percent of the 452 openly contested seats.</p>
      <p>Pro-democracy candidates won a majority of seats on all 18 councils, although they will only control 17 because a large number of government appointees shifted the balance of power in the Islands district.</p>
      <h3>«Whatever happens, Hong Kong is always a part of China and any attempts to create chaos in Hong Kong or to jeopardise its prosperity and stability will not be successful,»</h3>
      <p>said the Chinese foreign minister, Wang Yi, according to the Guardian.</p>
