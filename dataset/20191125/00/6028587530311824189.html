      <p>The Bisol family knows a thing or two about Prosecco—for starters, they’ve been growing grapes in the region for roughly 500 years. They also happen to be internationally recognized for producing award-winning Prosecco of great quality. And, everything they farm is organic and hails from Prosecco’s most vaunted appellations including the finest one, Prosecco Superiore of Valdobbiadene. Indeed, Gianluca Bisol, president and CEO of <a href="https://www.bisol.it/en/bisol/collection">Bisol Prosecco</a>, and his brother Desidiero Bisol, chief enologist, describe the Valdobbiadene appellation as the “spiritual homeland of Prosecco Superiore wine—a landscape whose generosity is only matched by the difficulty of tending its rocky slopes.” Below Bisol expands on what makes Prosecco Superiore so exceptional and why terroir truly matters. <b>Describe the different Prosecco classifications? Does it really matter which one we drink? </b>In the Prosecco world a sort of hierarchical pyramid establishes the quality of the best bottles to guide consumers in their choice. At the base of this pyramid is DOC Prosecco, which is crafted in lowland vineyards, while the center of the pyramid features Prosecco Superiore, protected by the DOCG designation and produced in the areas Valdobbiadene, Conegliano and Asolo. Sitting at the top of the pyramid is Prosecco Superiore of Valdobbiadene, with a special mention for two different types of Prosecco Superiore, the territorial classification called Rive -i.e. cru- and Cartizze variety. It is interesting and important to note that the Cartizze is the denomination whose average price per meter is the highest in Italy (about 2/2.5 million/ha). This is the reason why the Valdobbiadene area is the spiritual homeland of Prosecco Superiore wine.</p>
      <p><b>What is it like to harvest these grapes? Why is it called Heroic Viticulture?</b> The Valdobbiadene is a landscape whose generosity is only matched by the difficulty of tending its rocky slopes. Here vines cling to precipitous hillsides, meaning that – even with today’s technology - each phase of cultivation and harvesting has to be carried out exclusively by hand. Unsurprisingly this approach has come to be known as ‘heroic viticulture.’ Here the Glera grape, from which Prosecco Superiore is made, is particularly sensitive to microclimate variations and very rich in flavors. The Cartizze area is located halfway between Venice, the Adriatic Sea, and the Dolomites.</p>
      <p><b>How long have you pursued organic farming?</b> We're working on a sustainability project in development. Our progressive goal is, through the constant adoption of new virtuous and corrective practices, to ensure that in our vineyards there is maximum biodiversity on and under the soil.</p>
      <p><b>How are Cru Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore and Superiore di Cartizze designations different than standard Prosecco DOC? </b>In the Prosecco Superiore world, Cartizze area is the most hallowed hill, located in northern Italy between the Dolomites and Venice. Cartizze, the finest expression of Prosecco Superiore, represents the perfect union of environment, history, and human endeavor. Here, 107 hectares of vines wind their way along a steep crest to an altitude of roughly 1000 feet above sea level, enjoying ideal levels of sun and constant protection from cold winds.</p>
      <p><b>What is one of your favorite food pairings with Prosecco?</b> Prosecco Superiore is a very versatile sparkling. It became famous as a bottle to pop open for aperitivo, or as one of the best ingredients for a Spritz, but in Italy it is often consumed at the lunch or dinner table. So, Prosecco Superiore can accompany many dishes, from starter to dessert.</p>
      <p><b>What about food pairings with the Prosecco Superiore Dry expression, which tends to be sweeter?</b> Tradition dictates pairing Prosecco Superiore Dry wines with desserts, such as cookies, but they are also very interesting paired with Asian mildly spicy dishes. Our Cartizze Dry has elegant aromas of flowers and fruit, such as pear and white peach. It’s well taste-balanced between sapidity and smoothness, thanks to the temperature gap between the sun and the cold Nordic winds protected by the local Mount Cesen. This ensures prolonged maturation of Glera grapes, their higher acidity levels, excellent aromaticity and typical taste to the wine.</p>
