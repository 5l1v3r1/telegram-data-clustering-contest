      <h1>“New” MDC Zimbabwe Party Launched</h1>

      <p>A letter from the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission to the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) Zimbabwe reveals that there is a newly formed or launched party, MDC Zimbabwe.</p>
      <p>This comes when there are two MDCs already, the MDC led by Nelson Chamisa and the other led by Thokozani Khupe.</p>
      <p>Ironically, the MDC led by Chamisa uses the name <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zimbabwemdc/">MDC Zimbabwe on social media.</a></p>
      <p>Although there is no information at the moment to suggest who the leaders of the new party are, the address suggests that the party’s main offices are in Gweru, Midlands.</p>
      <p>The letter read as follows:</p>
      <blockquote><b>RE: NOTIFICATION OF EXISTENCE OF MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC) ZIMBABWE<br/></b><br/><b>The Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) acknowledges receipt of your party profile documents, the contents of which have been noted.<br/></b><br/><b>Your organisation has been included on ZEC’s stakeholder data base and mailing list for notification when appropriate meetings that require your input arise.<br/></b><br/>” alt=”” aria-hidden=”true” /&gt;<pic src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EKNDv2OXYAEz1_4?format=jpg&amp;name=medium"/></blockquote>
