      <h1>Chinese Rocket Launch Has Dropped Toxic Debris Over a Village... Again</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">KRISTIN HOUSER, FUTURISM</a></address>
      <p>On Saturday, China's space agency <a href="https://www.space.com/chinese-rocket-launch-drops-debris-on-homes.html">launched a Long March 3B rocket</a> from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center.</p>
      <p>The mission was a success in that it resulted in the delivery of two satellites into orbit.</p>
      <p>But when the rocket's first stage booster returned to Earth, it landed on a populated area, Ars Technica <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/11/china-keeps-dropping-toxic-rocket-parts-on-its-villages/">reported</a>, destroying a building and blanketing the area in toxic smoke - a space-age environmental catastrophe China could easily have prevented.</p>

      <p>The United States and many other space-faring nations typically build their launch sites near coasts. That's specifically so they can avoid putting the lives of residents at risk - any debris that returns to Earth can just fall into the ocean downrange.</p>
      <p>But during the Cold War, China built several major launch centers inland for "security purposes," Ars Technica pointed out.</p>
      <p>In the decades since, missions from those sites have repeatedly put residents in harm's way - in 1996, one Chinese rocket crashed into a village shortly after launch, killing either six people or hundreds, depending on whether you believe China or <a href="https://www.thespacereview.com/article/2323/1">outside sources</a>.</p>
      <p>China could slow its space efforts while building new launch sites in unpopulated or coastal areas.</p>
      <p>But instead, it has actually <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/china-launches-more-orbital-rockets">increased its number of rocket launches</a> in recent years in pursuit of space domination - a distinction it clearly sees as being worth the lives of its own residents.</p>
