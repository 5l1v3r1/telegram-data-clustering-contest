      <p>Thailand’s third biggest bank by assets says one of its fintech units has the potential to be a “unicorn” and exceed a $1 billion valuation.</p>
      <p>“We will spin off some of [the fintech units] to allow them more freedom and independence, including raising their own funds from other investors,” says SCB’s co-president and chief digital transformation officer Orapong Thien-Ngern.</p>
      <p>Potential units up for being spun into fresh start-ups include its corporate venture capital arm Digital Ventures and its payments services provider National ITMX.</p>
      <p>Calling technology investment and venture capital “key survival strategies” for the Thai bank, Thien-Ngern is well aware of the slight consumer pool which makes the country’s banking sector “a sunsetting industry”.</p>
      <p>Thailand’s Bank of Ayudhya (Krungsri), part of the MUFG group, has also focused its attention of developing fintech opportunities. The bank launched the ‘Krungsri Blockchain Interledger’ this month, which offers real-time fund transfers between Thailand and Laos – the hope being it will boost trade between the two countries.</p>
