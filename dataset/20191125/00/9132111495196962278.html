      <p>The Centre for Democratic Development (CDD) says the seeming public dispute between the Economic and Organised Crime Office (EOCO) and the Auditor General emboldens corrupt people.</p>
      <p>According to the programs director of CDD, Dr. Kwadwo Asante, even though the Auditor General is not above the law in the discharge of his duties, due process must be followed in challenging issues concerning his office.</p>
      <p>The Auditor-General, Mr Daniel Yaw Domelevo, has dragged the Economic and Organised Crime Office (EOCO) to court for investigating him over certain alleged procurement infractions at the Audit Service.</p>
      <p>In an application filed Wednesday, November 20, 2019, at the Human Rights Division of the Accra High Court, the Auditor-General contends that EOCO had no mandate to investigate him or the Audit Service over the alleged procurement breaches.</p>
      <p>Commenting on the development, Mr Asante said evidence available to civil society organisations show that the auditor general has not been involved in any financial breaches.</p>
      <p>“At the point where the procurement process, PPA confirmed that there was value for money. If the PPA wants to ensure that the breaches are investigated, then we should have a proper forum to have this addressed. The AG is not above the law and therefore nobody will hold brief if he’s done wrong. If we need to investigate the issue, let’s hold the right forum and make the report public so we know exactly the issues raised.</p>
      <p>” What is happening actually emboldens the criminals and those who intend to do bad. We should ensure these things don’t happen in the manner that they happening right now,” he told Francis Abban on the Morning Starr Monday.</p>
