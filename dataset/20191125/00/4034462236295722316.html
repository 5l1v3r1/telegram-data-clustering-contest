      <h1>Rare And Extreme Aston Martin One-77 Has Shockingly Few Miles</h1>
      <h2>Place the winning bid and you'll be helping a good cause in the process.</h2>

      <p>Aston Martin has produced some seriously fast and lustworthy road cars over the course of its history – heck, in the past decade alone. But few can hold a candle to the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/aston-martin/one-77">One-77</a>. Unfortunately, as its name suggests, only 77 examples were made. But there's one rather stunning example is coming up for auction. And if you place the winning bid, not only can it be yours, but you'll be helping a good cause in the process.</p>
      <p>The latest addition to <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/millionaires-need-to-check-out-these-cars-at-abu-dhabis-auction">RM Sotheby's upcoming sale in Abu Dhabi</a> next week, this 2011 Aston Martin One-77 is the 38th of those 77 examples made.</p>

      <p>That puts it smack-dab in the middle of the model's strictly limited production run. And it's only been driven "sparingly," putting on just 552 miles from new.</p>
      <p>For those unfamiliar, the One-77 was the first model that Aston Martin rolled out after its independence from Ford. Like so many of its stablemates – straight through to today's <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/aston-martin/dbs-superleggera">DBS Superleggera</a> – it was a front-engined, twelve-cylinder, two-door coupe. But it took the format in an altogether more extreme direction to take on the likes of Bugatti, Koenigsegg, and Pagani. Its bodywork was signature Aston, but wider, lower, and stretched over a carbon monocoque chassis.</p>

      <p>Up front sat an enormous 7.3-liter naturally aspirated V12, sending 750 horsepower and 553 lb-ft of torque to the rear wheels through a six-speed sequential gearbox. Weighing less than 3,600 pounds, it could hit 60 in 3.5 seconds and top out at over 220 mph. It was the perfect starting point for <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/watch-aston-martin-vulcans-tear-up-circuit-of-americas">the track-bound Vulcan</a> that followed, but this one you could drive on public roads.</p>
      <p>That is, if you were lucky enough to get your hands on one. With production so strictly limited, Aston Martin sold each example for £1.15 million (about $1.8 million at the time). This one is estimated to fetch around $1.5-2 million when the gavel drops, with proceeds going towards the African Parks foundation.</p>
