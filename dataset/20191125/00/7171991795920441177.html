      <h1>Barcaderator Is Coin-Op Arcade Up Top And Kegerator Down Below</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://hackaday.com/author/jennylist/" target="_blank">Jenny List</a></address>
      <p>It’s a common sight in our community for a life-expired arcade cabinet to be repurposed as a MAME cabinet with an up-to-date screen and other internals. Many of us have had some fun pursuing high scores in a hackerspace somewhere, and even if they don’t have the screen burn and annoying need for cash of the originals they still deliver plenty of fun.</p>
      <p>But if there’s one pleasure an adult can pursue that a kid in a 1980s arcade couldn’t, it’s a cool glass of beer. [Marcus Young] has brought together the two with his Barcaderator, <a href="https://marcyoung.us/post/barcade/">a custom MAME cabinet with a beer tap on the side</a> and a fridge for a keg in its base.</p>

      <p>The MAME internals include a Lattepanda Alpha and an LED controller for those illuminated buttons. Where this build shines is in its custom cabinet, which instead of being an all-in-one unit takes the form of a base and top half that are detatchable. It appears to take its inspiration and build techniques from the world of flight cases. You can see the detail where the two halves come together in this image. The result should be of great interest to anyone who has struggled with moving an unwieldy traditional arcade cabinet.</p>
      <p>This is we think the first beer/arcade combo to grace these pages. But we’ve had more than one <a href="https://hackaday.com/2017/12/19/drm-workarounds-save-arcade-cabinet/">arcade cabinet</a>, and definitely quite a few <a href="https://hackaday.com/2016/05/19/beautiful-kegerator-built-the-hard-way/">kegs</a> along the way.</p>
