      <p>Kiwi coaching great Wayne Smith has sent a warning to the yet-to-be-selected All Blacks coach about new Wallabies coach Dave Rennie.</p>
      <p>Smith worked alongside Rennie as an assistant and mentor at the Chiefs from 2012 to 2014, helping turn a side which finished bottom of the New Zealand conference in 2011 claim back-to-back Super Rugby titles in 2012 and 2013.</p>
      <p>Now the former All Blacks assistant coach is warning Rennie could do the same for the Wallabies after their quarter-final exit from this year's World Cup under departing coach Michael Cheika.</p>
      <p>Smith said Dave Rennie will be relentless in his pursuit of excellence and he will take no prisoners.</p>
      <p>Rennie will become the Wallabies' second non-Australian coach, following countryman Robbie Deans who led the side from 2008 to 2013.</p>
