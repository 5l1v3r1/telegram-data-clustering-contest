        <b>Bayern Munich are already assured of a place in the last 16 of the Champions League but Hansi Flick wants to progress as group winners.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Bayern Munich interim boss Hansi Flick is targeting top spot</b> in Champions League Group B but is <b>open to rotating his side</b> for Tuesday's trip to Red Star Belgrade.</p>
      <p><b>The German champions have already booked a place in the knockout stages</b> of the competition after winning their opening four matches.</p>
      <p>Victory in Belgrade will be enough to secure first place and what on paper should be a more favourable last-16 tie against a runner-up from one of the other groups.</p>
      <p>Flick, who has won three matches from three since taking caretaker charge earlier this month, is keen to get the job done against Red Star.</p>
      <p>"<b>We want to top the group tomorrow</b>," he said at Monday's pre-match news conference. "I will keep all of my options open. Some players need to find their rhythm, others need a rest."</p>

      <p><b>Jerome Boateng is back in contention </b>after serving a suspension, while Thiago Alcantara is also part of the squad despite carrying a wrist injury.</p>
      <p>"<b>Boateng trained very well during the international break</b>," Flick said. "He's another option for us, but I haven't decided yet who will play yet. <b>As for Thiago, he hurt his wrist but is okay to play</b>. He's a player you can always call upon and has many qualities. Bayern can be very happy to have him here."</p>
      <p>Red Star star followed up a 5-0 defeat at Tottenham with a 4-0 loss at home to the same opponents last time out, but Flick is expecting a tough test in the Serbian capital.</p>
      <p>"<b>The atmosphere in this stadium is something special</b>. I'm curious to feel that. We are looking forward to it. We know that this mood will be a very difficult game."</p>
      <p><b>Leon Goretzka is in line to make his second Champions League appearance</b> of the season on Tuesday and has urged his team-mates to maintain their winning momentum.</p>
      <p>"It's a great feeling to win games, but it's even better to see the way we have been winning," he said.</p>
      <p>"Even though we have already qualified, we want to win the game. We want to continue our run and win the group."</p>
