      <p>Copenaghen - <b>Two weeks after the departure </b>of Soren Toft, its former chief operating officers, Maersk loses its chief financial officer, Carolina Dybeck Happe. She had been appointed only ten months ago and will replace Jamie Miller as chief financial officer and senior vice president at General Electric, starting from 2020.</p>
      <p>“Over the past year, A.P. Moller - Maersk has <b>progressed well financially</b>, illustrated by the latest earnings upgrade in October 2019. With a reinforced financial foundation, we are well positioned for future growth. I would like to thank Carolina for her short, but productive time at A.P. Moller – Maersk. She is committed to building on the progress that has been made and ensuring a smooth and orderly handover. She will leave in 12 months at the latest,” said Maersk’s chief executive officer, Søren Skou, in a press release.</p>
