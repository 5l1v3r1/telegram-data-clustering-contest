      <p>Wilder was actually behind on the judges' scorecards when he opened up Ortiz.</p>
      <p>After throwing a left-handed jab, the Bronze Bomber lived up to his nickname by smashing the Cuban with a ferocious right hand.</p>
      <p>Stunned Ortiz tried to get back to his feet but was counted out as Wilder extended his unbeaten record to 43 fights.</p>
      <p>From this fight, Wilder walked away with $3 million while Ortiz walked away with $1.5 million.</p>
      <p>Wilderâ€™s next fight is their rematch with Tyson Fury next February.</p>
