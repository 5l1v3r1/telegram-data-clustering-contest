      <p><i>Battleborn</i> publisher 2K Games has announced that Gearbox’s ill-fated hero-shooter will be going offline for good in January 2021, and has already been pulled from digital shelves ahead of the shutdown.</p>
      <p>2K says that it is now <a href="https://support.2k.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038371534">in the process of gradually sunsetting the game</a> to direct resources to other projects.</p>
      <p>As part of that process, <i>Battleborn</i> players will no longer be able to purchase the game’s premium currency after February 24, 2020, though any purchased prior or earned in-game can be spent as usual until the game goes offline.</p>
      <p>After that, the next step sees servers shut down in January 2021, and <i>Battleborn</i> as a whole will be rendered entirely unplayable.</p>
      <p>Gearbox launched <i>Battleborn</i> back in 2016, a launch window that saw it going head to head with similarly angled hero-shooters like Blizzard’s <i>Overwatch</i>.</p>
      <p>The team had already <a href="https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/305904/Moving_on_Gearbox_wraps_up_active_development_on_Battleborn.php">ended active development</a> as of September 2017. At the time, Gearbox said that <i>Battleborn</i>’s servers would remain up for the “foreseeable future,” a point in time that is now just over a year away.</p>
