      <p>Today, MediaTek is announcing a major partnership with Intel. The Taiwanese chip maker will work with Intel to bring 5G support on Intel-powered laptops. MediaTek’s 5G modem is under development and the chip maker is working with partners to manufacture the solution.</p>
      <blockquote>5G will user in the next era of PC experiences, and working with Intel, an industry leader in computing, highlights MediaTek’s expertise in designing 5G technology for global markets. With this partnership, consumers will be able to browse, stream and game faster on their PCs, but we also expect them to innovate with 5G in ways we have not yet imagined. – Joe Chen – MediaTek President</blockquote>
      <p>The first OEMs’ products to take advantage of the new partnership are Dell and HP. We can expect to see MediaTek’s 5G solution make it onto Windows laptops in early 2021.</p>
