      <p>The Federal High Court, Abuja, has granted former Chairman, defunct Pension Reform Task Team (PRTT), <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/07/just-in-court-takes-decision-on-mainas-bail-application/"><u><b>Abdulrasheed Maina</b></u></a>, bail in the sum of N1 billion.</p>
      <p>Ruling on Monday, Justice Okon Abang ordered Maina to produce two sureties who must be serving senators.</p>
      <p>According to Justice Abang, the two senators must not be standing any criminal trial in any court in the country.</p>
      <p>He also ruled that the two sureties, who must be prepared for a N500 million bond each, must always be in court with the defendant at each adjourned date.</p>
      <p>Justice Abang had, on Nov. 21, fixed Monday for hearing on the bail application and for the continuation of Maina’s trial.</p>
      <p><b>Naija News</b> reports that Maina was alleged to have abused his position as <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/21/efcc-drags-maina-to-court-over-fresh-allegation/"><u>PRTT chairman</u></a> to award fictitious contracts for purported biometric enrolment of pensioners, an offence punishable under section 317 of the Penal Code Act, Cap532, Vol. 4, Laws of the Federal Capital Territory of Nigeria 2007.</p>
      <p>The spokesperson for the EFCC, Wilson Uwujaren, had said Maina and his cohorts also allegedly made claims for fictitious allowances during the course of the purported biometric enrolment assignment.</p>
      <p>He stated that the proceeds of the fictitious contracts were allegedly remitted into his account through the second defendant.</p>
