      <p><i>In addition to this, a government notification says that the schools’ performances should be added on the website too</i> <br/><br/>Parents planning to admit their kids to a private school for the next academic year can heave a sigh of relief. The State government of Karnataka has issued a notification instructing all private schools to upload their fee structure for the next academic year on the Students Achievement Tracking System (SATS) website, along with the school’s board examination results. <br/><br/>The commissioner of the State’s public instruction department instructed all private educational institutions in the State to publish this on the website by December 31 of every calendar year. <br/><br/>The Department also stated that the audit report pertaining to the previous financial year ending on March 31, along with details of teaching resources, the results of all the public examinations and the detailed list of determination of the nature of fees and its compliance from the year 2019-20, would have to be uploaded too.</p>
      <p>Putting these details on the SATS website makes it a lot easier for parents to compare and make informed choices about schools ­</p>
      <p>–John Malik, parent<br/><br/><br/>The department provided a proforma for the fees under three headings - one is Tuition Fee, second is Term Fee and third is Special Development Fee starting from LKG to class 12. <br/>It might be noted that in May 2018, the government tried to fix the fees for schools. According to the gazette notification, the formula to fix the fee is: salary of staff + other expenditure divided by number of students. Secondly, schools are not allowed to increase the annual fee by more than 15% and the maintenance fee should not be increased by Rs 2,500. The government fixed the maintenance fee at Rs 2,500 though the schools demanded that the government fix it at Rs 5,000. <br/><br/>The government said that the fee regulation would apply to all schools in the state irrespective of boards, which means that even schools affiliated to CBSE, ICSE and state boards will be regulated under this. <br/><br/>Parents however were happy with this. John Malik, a resident of Jayanagar said, “School websites only give information about the infrastructure and the attractive facilities in the school. But there is absolutely no information on the fee structure. Now putting these details on the SATS website makes it a lot easier for parents to compare and make informed choices about schools.” <br/><br/>Other parents were also happy that the school’s performance at the national level and in international activities was there for all to see. “Also, declaring board examination results on the website will be helpful for parents who would like their children to go to a school with good academic performances,” said Parashuram Kamath, a parent. <br/><br/><br/>D Shashi Kumar, general secretary of Associated Management of Primary and Secondary Schools in Karnataka said, “We have no problem in declaring the fee structure on the website. Firstly let the government solve the problems pertaining to the fee structure. Secondly the government should answer our queries on Right To Education (RTE) reimbursement that is pending from their side. Without the RTE money we cannot calculate the deficit and actual cost as of now. We can definitely give out the per child calculation to the government, but we do not have money to spend on the kids.” <br/><br/>“Moreover this fee matter is still pending in the High Court and the government is issuing notifications like these. In addition to this, they also say that we need to give 50 per cent of the textbook cost by end of this year for the next academic year’s classes. This is ridiculous,” he added. <br/><br/><br/>However, several schools in the city are publishing their fee structure on their notice boards as per the government’s order.</p>
