        <b>Sevilla's Sporting Director Ramon Rodriguez has denied the club has interest in Ghanaian defender Mohammed Salisu. </b>
      </p>
      <p>The high flying Real Valladolid defender popped up on the radar of the Spanish giants ahead of their clash in La Liga on Sunday.</p>
      <p>However, Ramon Rodriguez, who is popularly known as Monchi disclosed the club has not contacted Valladolid for Salisu.</p>
      <p>"Miguel Ángel (sports director of the Pucelano team) knows how we work. Today we do not do individual, but global, follow-ups, so there is nothing like that, “said Monchi.</p>
      <p>"He was a partner in many battles, most won and enjoyed. Everything good that could happen to me is a joy.”</p>
      <p>"I think his numbers support him , beyond what I can say. He ascended with the team in the Second Division. Last year he achieved permanence and, this year, the team is in the middle of the table with a very exciting project.”</p>
      <p>Mohammed Salisu was a rock again at the back as the Whites and Violets narrowly lost to Sevilla on Saturday in the La Liga.</p>
