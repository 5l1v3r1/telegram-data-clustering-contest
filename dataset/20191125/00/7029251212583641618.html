      <p>Dar es Salaam. The mood was subdued across the country yesterday when Kilimanjaro Queens lost to Kenya’s Harambee Starlets in the Cecafa Women’s Senior Challenge Cup final.</p>
      <p>Kilimanjaro Queens had gone into the match as favourites and made a bright start before two goals from second half substitute Hendrix Shikangwa silenced the hosts at the Azam Complex, Chamazi.</p>
      <p>Shikangwa – popularly known as “Super Sub,” – struck twice to give the Kenyan girls a 2-0 win over the hosts.</p>
      <p>Shikangwa, who was like a thorn in the flesh for hosts’ defenders, emerged the top scorer of the tournament with eight goals.</p>
      <p>She broke the deadlock in the 70<sup>th</sup> minute through a penalty, 19 minutes after coming in to replace Janet Bundi.</p>
      <p>The gifted striker came into the picture again 17 minutes later, this time with a trick shot to kill off whatever little hopes Kilimanjaro Queens had of retaining the title.</p>
