      <h1>Cristiano Ronaldo to be evaluated before Juventus' clash with Atletico</h1>

        <b>Maurizio Sarri is hopeful Cristiano Ronaldo will return for Juventus when Atletico Madrid visit Turin in the Champions League.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Cristiano Ronaldo has trained with Juventus and will be evaluated ahead of Tuesday's Champions League clash</b> with Atletico Madrid, Maurizio Sarri has confirmed.</p>
      <p>The Portugal striker sat out the unconvincing 3-1 win at Atalanta over the weekend as he continues to contend with a knee injury.</p>
      <p>However, <b>Ronaldo is seemingly in line to feature in the Group D contest against Atleti</b>, an opponent the former Real Madrid star has scored 25 times against in his prolific career.</p>
      <p>"<b>Yesterday he did the training sessions</b> with his team-mates," Sarri said. "He seems to be growing [stronger]. <b>We will evaluate it between today and tomorrow</b> to see if we have solved it, but the fact that yesterday he did all the training with his team-mates is very positive. I think and hope there will be no repercussions."</p>

      <p><b>Ronaldo's relationship with Sarri has been under the microscope in recent weeks</b>, mainly due to the coach's decision to haul off his star forward in two straight matches when Juve were chasing a win prior to the international break.</p>
      <p>The second of those games, a 1-0 victory over AC Milan, saw Ronaldo head straight down the tunnel and reportedly leave the stadium before the match had finished.</p>
      <p>However, Sarri insists all is well between the duo and he has no objection to players showing frustration when being substituted.</p>

      <p>"<b>My relationship with Cristiano is good</b>," he added. </p>
      <p><b>"If a player who has won so much is angry about being substituted it means he still has a lot of motivation</b> and this is something positive.</p>
      <p>"It is 25 years I have seen players get angry over substitutions."</p>
      <p>Sarri, who confirmed <b>Matthijs de Ligt and Federico Bernardeschi will also be evaluated before the game with Atleti</b>, also explained why he does not foresee Ronaldo, Gonzalo Higuain and Paulo Dybala lining up in the same XI any time soon.</p>
      <p>"<b>Playing Paulo, Gonzalo and Cristiano all together is difficult because of their characteristics</b>, but all three know how to play really well and are comfortable with each other," he said.</p>
      <p>"We have three strong strikers for two places. None of the three can play 65 games as seen in the early part of the season. Everyone will find a place."</p>
      <p>Juve have already qualified for the knockout phase of the Champions League but know a win over Atleti will secure top spot in Group D.</p>
      <p>"<b>Right now I'm seeing the team play excellently in flashes</b> and I would like to see some more continuity in certain aspects, but we must take into account the characteristics of the players," Sarri said. </p>
      <p>"We certainly have room for improvement. Against Atleti we can't worry about what they are going to do.  <b>They are a difficult team to face but we must think </b>about how important first place in the group is."</p>
