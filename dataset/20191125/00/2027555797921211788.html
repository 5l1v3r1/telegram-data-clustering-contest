      <h1>Pollution levels in Delhi-NCR drop due to moderate wind</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:33:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 00:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/pti" target="_blank">PTI</a></address>
      <p>Pollution levels in Delhi-NCR dropped further on Sunday with moderate winds sweeping the region.</p>
      <p>The overall air quality index (AQI) in the national capital read 234 at 4 pm, down from 312 at 4 pm on Friday.</p>
      <p>Most of the 37 air quality monitoring stations in Delhi recorded AQI in the "poor" category.</p>
      <p>NSIT, Dwarka, was the most-polluted area with an AQI of 324, while Dilshad Garden (127) was the least polluted.</p>
      <p>Neighbouring Ghaziabad (240), Greater Noida (226), Gurgaon (172), Faridabad (215) and Noida (225) also recorded an improvement in air quality.</p>
      <p>Weather experts said no sudden dip in air quality is expected on Monday. However, wind speed is likely to dip under the influence of a fresh western disturbance.</p>
      <p>Light rains are expected in northwest India on Tuesday and Wednesday.</p>
      <p>If Punjab and Haryana receive widespread rains, the impact of stubble burning on Delhi's air quality will reduce further, a weather expert said.</p>
      <p>However, light rains in Delhi-NCR may prove counterproductive as they increase humidity which exacerbates pollution, he said.</p>
      <p>In case of good rains in Delhi-NCR on November 26 and 27, pollutants will be washed away.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the government's air quality monitoring and forecasting body SAFAR said a marginal dip in air quality is predicted on Monday.</p>
      <p>The AQI is likely to stay in the poor category on November 26 and may improve further in case of sufficient rains, it said.</p>
      <p>The stubble fire count, as per SAFAR multi-satellite data, is 349. Transport-level winds are northwesterly and favourable for plume movement, but their high speed won't allow pollutant accumulation.</p>
      <p>Hence, no significant stubble impact is expected for the next two days, it said.Â </p>
