      <p>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) - The Indianapolis Colts have put Pro Bowl tight end Eric Ebron on injured reserve with an ankle injury.</p>
      <p>He is expected to miss the rest of the season. Tight end Ross Travis was signed to replace Ebron.</p>
      <p>The move comes days after top receiver T.Y. Hilton returned to the lineup and at a time when Indy’s offense has struggled. Ebron had 31 receptions for 375 yards and three touchdowns in his second season with the Colts (6-5). He was selected to his first Pro Bowl last season and can become a free agent after the season.</p>
      <p>Travis played in four games with Indy in 2017 before spending last season on the injured reserve list. He was waived by the team on Aug. 31.</p>
