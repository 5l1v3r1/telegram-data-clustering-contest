      <p>Someone has to tell teach the WWE decision makers how to end a pay-per-view. Survivor Series 2019 was one of the strongest shows of the year for any promotion until the inexplicable main event. I was at the Allstate Arena for the festivities. Let’s look at the results, grades, highlights and analysis from Rosemont, Illinois.</p>
      <h3>Dolph Ziggler and Robert Roode of Smackdown def. Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson, The Street Profits, and Zack Ryder and Curt Hawkins of Raw, The Revival, Heavy Machinery, and Lucha House Party of SmackDown. Breezango, The Forgotten Sons, and Imperium's Marcel Barthel of NXT in a Cross-Brand Tag-Team Battle Royal.</h3>
      <p>Traffic prevented me from seeing this one live, so before a proper evaluation could be made, I needed to come home to watch it on the WWE Network. I didn’t really miss anything too special. This match was a convoluted mess at first with entirely too many performers competing in a battle with a flawed rule set.</p>
      <p>Any time a Superstar was thrown over the top rope, his entire team was eliminated. I don’t have an issue with Ziggler and Roode going over in this match and they had a nice ending sequence with The Street Profits, but overall this lasted far too long.</p>
      <p>There was a late-arriving crowd and most of them didn’t seem to be into things.</p>
      <h3>Grade: C-</h3>
      <hr/>
      <h3>(c)Lio Rush def. Akira Tozawa and Kalisto - WWE Cruiserweight Champion</h3>
      <p>With the aid of the WWE Network, I got to see this match. Rush is one of the best small guys in any promotion, and he shared the spotlight with Kalisto and Akira well.</p>
      <p>However, the right decision was made to have Rush retain. Rush used The Final Hour to pin Kalisto to retain the title. This wasn’t the best cruiserweight battle you’ll see and that’s partly because there wasn’t much of a story established leading up to the match. Still, the in-ring artistry is good for some level of entertainment.</p>
      <h3>Grade: C+</h3>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Viking Raiders def. The New Day and The Undisputed Era</h3>
      <p>It felt as if this was the point when the pay-per-view really got started. In watching it back on WWE Network, I wished I’d seen this one live. All three teams were equipped with elite performers and all of them delivered.</p>
      <p>Kofi Kingston was easily the biggest star in the match, and he felt like a top-level guy throughout. However, the Viking Raiders felt like the more dominant team. Their lifting maneuvers, selling, and overall athleticism stole the show and led to their victory. VR is easily the promotion’s top tag team, and having them reign supreme was the best booking decision.</p>
      <h3>Grade: B+</h3>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Team NXT: Rhea Ripley, Bianca Belair, Io Shirai, Candice LeRae and Toni Storm def. Team SmackDown: Sasha Banks, Dana Brooke, Carmella, Nikki Cross and Lacey Evans and Team Raw: Charlotte Flair, Asuka, Kairi Sane, Natalya and Sarah Logan</h3>
      <p>I loved this from beginning to end, and this is the first match I saw live in its entirety without having to watch the replay on the WWE Network. So many of the performers shined, but if I had to identify the biggest standouts, it would be Charlotte, Asuka, Sasha Banks, Io Shirai, Bianca Belair and Rhea Riple.</p>
      <p>I know, that’s almost everyone.</p>
      <p>The amount of action was dizzying. Asuka hit Charlotte with a mega spew of Green Mist, but the Queen had already showed off her brilliance. She eliminated two opponents and was predictably steady.</p>
      <p>Sasha Banks put on a show for Smackdown and nearly took home the win. Shirai and LeRae would come back to the ring after being eliminated. They helped Ripley, who was left in the ring with Sasha, to ultimately gain the pinfall victory over The Boss.</p>
      <p>We saw drama, dynamic moves and just about everything else you’d want to see in a traditional Survivor Series style match.</p>
      <h3>Grade: A-</h3>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Roderick Strong def. Shinsuke Nakamura and AJ Styles</h3>
      <p>A well-executed triple-threat match can be the most exciting bout in professional wrestling. A poorly-executed triple-threat bout can be a disaster. Thankfully, this was the former.</p>
      <p>We’ve been waiting to see Styles and Nakamura involved in a classic WWE match and we finally got one. Perhaps it was Strong’s presence that helped to take things to the next level. In any case, the trio of performers worked well together with a balanced diet of aerial moves, strikes and more. Sami Zayn’s presence in Nakamura’s corner seemed pointless, but that couldn’t kill what was otherwise a great match. I will say Zayn was funny during the Pre-Show after Booker T clowned him for not knowing Flavor Flav during an interview.</p>
      <p>Strong got the win when he opportunistically threw Styles under the bottom rope after the latter hit the Phenomenal Forearm on Nakamura. Strong would still the pinfall victory.</p>
      <h3>Grade: A</h3>
      <hr/>
      <h3>NXT Championship: (c) Adam Cole vs. Pete Dunne</h3>
      <p>The quality of Cole’s pay-per-view matches are truly Shawn Michaels-like. No matter his opponent, he seems to just consistently perform on an elite level. We can’t neglect the work Dunne did on Saturday night during the No. 1-contender match, but his performance on Sunday was even stronger.</p>
      <p>Dunne proved he could work a faster-paced match with limited joint manipulation, and his selling was exemplary. I came into the match believing Cole would retain, but things were booked so well that I lost confidence in my prediction. Cole reversed Bitter End and countered with a destroyer piledriver. Dunne would close up shop with the Last Shot to secure the pinfall.</p>
      <p>I can’t imagine how this one could have been any better.</p>
      <h3>Grade: A+</h3>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Universal Championship: (c) “The Fiend” Bray Wyatt def. Daniel Bryan</h3>
      <p>Whoever was in charge of the booking when Bryan Wyatt faced Seth Rollins at Hell in a Cell couldn’t have had their hands on this match. The HIAC match had one of the worst endings in professional wrestling this year.</p>
      <p>The booking in this match was far more patient and sensible. Bryan was allowed to mount some solid offense against The Fiend. In fact, the latter had to kick out of a pin attempt after eating a Flying Knee. The Universal Champion successfully retained his title when he countered a roll-up pin with a Mandible Claw.</p>
      <p>Bryan tried to fight it, but ultimately was pinned under the pressure of The Fiend’s finisher. I liked this match from The Fiend better than all of his meetings with Rollins. Perhaps WWE is beginning to learn how it has to book the matches of a character as powerful as The Fiend.</p>
      <h3>Grade: B</h3>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Team SmackDown: Roman Reigns, King Corbin, Shorty G, Mustapha Ali and Braun Strowman def. Team Raw: Seth Rollins, Kevin Owens, Drew McIntyre, Randy Orton and Ricochet and Team NXT: Tommaso Ciampa, Walter, Damian Priest, Matt Riddle and Keith Lee</h3>
      <p>The final 10 minutes of this match was classic Survivor Series action. Had the early moments been a little stronger, the match grade would be a little higher. Walter was eliminated first, which dismissive to such a strong up-and-comer. Likewise, Kevin Owens and Drew McIntyre hit the proverbial showers pretty early as well.</p>
      <p>WWE deserves credit for understanding the mindset of their fans. Ciampa and Keith Lee were left to battle Reigns and Rollins–though the last two were on different brands. Reigns and Rollins teamed up on Lee, but the NXT big man proved how special he can be in the ring with top WWE talent.</p>
      <p>He got the pin on Rollins before a super-entertaining sequence with Reigns ended with The Big Dog getting the pin after a Spear.</p>
      <h3>Grade: A-</h3>
      <hr/>
      <h3>WWE Championship (c) Brock Lesnar def. Rey Mysterio - No Holds Barred</h3>
      <p>Coming into this match, I thought a squash was possible. However, Mysterio bounced around enough to show he’s still capable of working a strong bout. Mysterio took a number of bumps from Lesnar, but made it through seemingly unscathed. As Lesnar dished out punishment, Dominick Mysterio rushed to the ring waving a white towel.</p>
      <p>Lesnar turned his back on his opponent who took the opportunity to hit The Beast with a low blow. Dominick would follow suit which allowed the father-and-son duo pound on Lesnar. This sequence included a beautifully executed double 619 and two frog splashes.</p>
      <p>However, Lesnar would turn the tables as he’d F5 Mysterio to get the win. This wasn’t a classic, but it was a strong piece or ending to the Lesnar-Mysterio feud.</p>
      <h3>Grade: B-</h3>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Shayna Baszler def. Bayley and Becky Lynch</h3>
      <p>Why on Earth would WWE choose to conclude such an action-packed PPV with a match that featured three mat wrestlers whose strengths aren’t their athleticism?</p>
      <p>If the Baszler, Bayley and Lynch match was set to go last, why wouldn’t WWE have Ronda Rousey come back to renew her feud with Becky? We’ll never know.</p>
      <p>As it was, the battle of the top-level women’s champions was disappointing. The pace was too slow and the match was booked far too safely. There was no way this match should have closed the show. Baszler didn’t look sharp and the entire thing felt thrown together. Baszler going over was fine, but this could have been better match.</p>
      <h3>Grade: D+</h3>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Overall</h3>
      <p>This PPV was largely excellent with the exception of the main event. Even with that, the show was a strong one.</p>
      <h3>Grade: B</h3>
