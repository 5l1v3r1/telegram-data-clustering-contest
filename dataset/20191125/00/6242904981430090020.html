      </p>
      <p>The 18-year-old has been a revelation since joining the Scottish giants in September from Manchester City.</p>
      <p>His reason for joining Celtic from Manchester City was to earn first-team opportunities and thus far he has played six games in all competitions.</p>
      <p>“When you want to play at the top you can’t be shy, you just have to go and play and that is what I am doing,” he said. “I have been ready for this all my life so it is good. When I get on the pitch I just do what I do best; just go and attack and help the team out as much as I can too defensively.</p>
      <p>“I am just going to keep working harder and harder and hopefully the manager will keep putting me in.”</p>
      <p>As Frimpong continues his footballing education, there are plenty of pearls of wisdom to be gleaned in and around Celtic Park.</p>
      <p>“When I first came here I spoke to Danny (McGrain) and he helped me a lot,” added Frimpong. “Scott Brown, in particular, has been helping me a lot. He says ‘just do what you do because no-one can live with you, just go and show the fans what you can do’.</p>
      <p>“I knew Scott was a good captain, I heard that from everywhere. When he plays, he always gives 100% and I knew if I was going to be in his company he would help me a lot and he has. I am really grateful for that.”</p>
