        <i>After extra-time</i>
      </p>
      <p>Donoughmore manager Donal Dineen knows Rena Buckley’s legendary status will only grow after she picked an All-Ireland Junior Club medal in victory over MacHale Rovers at Duggan Park in Ballinasloe.</p>
      <p>It was an epic encounter between the Cork and Mayo clubs, and as the floodlights were switched on as the game went to extra-time, the former Rebel dual star emerged once again as the main figure.</p>
      <p>Niamh Lohan and Rachel Kearns scored the goals for their respective sides but it was 0-7 from the boot of the 32-year-old Buckley that swung the game.</p>
      <p>It was a 21st national medal for Buckley while her teammates basked in the glory of a first All-Ireland crown for Donoughmore since they were senior champions in 2003.</p>
      <p>“Everyone knows Rena is a legend,” said Dineen.</p>
      <p>“She is a fantastic role model for the younger girls. You would see her in the car park coaching them after training. That is the type of player and person she is.”</p>

      </p>
      <p>Many of the Donoughmore players weren’t even born when the club won their last All-Ireland but there was still plenty of experience and they showed it early.</p>
      <p>They raced into a 1-4 to 0-0 lead with Buckley opening the scoring in the second minutes and then Lohan’s goal seven minutes later. She received the ball from Buckley and then a fortuitous effort looped over Niamh Larkin in the MacHale Rovers goal.</p>
      <p>Mayo forward Kearns, who had picked up an All-Star last week, played a massive role in getting her side back into the game.</p>
      <p>She scored 0-4 in the first half and with four of the closing five points, MacHale Rovers only trailed 1-7 to 0-6 at half-time.</p>
      <p>Buckley scored on the resumption and that was quickly cancelled out by Rebecca Maughan before there was a long period without a score.</p>
      <p>Then there was a frenetic ending to normal time. Kearns had been yellow carded but she returned and rifled a free into the roof of the Donoughmore net in the 55th minute.</p>
      <p>MacHale Rovers were desperate for an equaliser and Kearns provided that too as the game went to extra-time.</p>
      <p>But Donoughmore’s experience prevailed after they took a 1-11 to 1-10 lead into the break. Buckley’s seventh point gave them a two-point lead and while Rebecca Maughan cut the gap to the minimum, the Cork side held out for victory.</p>
      <p>It was third straight win in this competition for Cork clubs, after Aghada and Glanmire, and Dineen was thrilled to see his daughter Deirdre Dineen involved at wing-back for Donoughmore.</p>
      <p>“She always dreamt of winning an All-Ireland. She followed the great Donoughmore teams down through the years,” said Dineen.</p>
      <p>“This was her dream and now it has been fulfilled for her.”</p>
      <p>But the wait goes on for a Mayo club to win the junior championship. Knockmore failed in 2008 and this was another agonising defeat.</p>
      <p>“We gave it our all and left everything on the pitch but it sucks coming second, we hate it,” said joint manager Jarlath Tolan.</p>
      <p>“We had such a fantastic year, built ourselves up from the ground right to where we are, the second-best team in the country, that is a pretty good achievement.</p>
      <p>“But we knew we were up against it. There is an awful lot of experience in that Donoughmore team and they were excellent.”</p>
