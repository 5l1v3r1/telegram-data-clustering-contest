      <p>The Lebanon community in Ghana and the Lebanon embassy have pledged to continue to support Ghanaian students through their scholarship scheme.</p>
      <p>Speaking at a scholarship awarding ceremony held at the Ghana Institute of Journalism (GIJ), Wednesday, the Lebanese ambassador to Ghana, Maher Kheir said despite the critical situation his home country is facing, the scholarship initiative which was set up by the Lebanese community in Ghana with his predecessor will be sustained.</p>
      <p>"Despite the critical situation that Lebanon is crossing in these difficult times, we will continue to support you our Ghanaian brothers and sisters through our scholarship programme".</p>
      <p>Maher Kheir also disclosed that he intends to introduce a research award scheme at GIJ. This follows the introduction of a similar awards scheme - the Lebanese Literature Prize and Research Awards at the Ghana School of Languages to promote Lebanese and Ghanaian literature with the hope of fostering a stronger Ghana - Lebanon relation.</p>
      <p>"This is because we believe that language and culture can build the shortest bridge between all people and strengthen human relations".</p>
      <p>According to the ambassador, the introduction of the research awards at GIJ will provide student journalists the needed cultural exposure for them to be able "to properly analyze the context of every information, especially in our globalized world".</p>
      <p>"When you possess all these values, you will be the masters of yourselves, masters of the pulpit and you will certainly be the brightest journalists. Then, we will be truly proud of you."</p>
      <p>Maher Kheir further encouraged students to become members of the to-be-created Lebanese Scholarship Alumni Group which "will create a network between all beneficiaries, the Lebanese community and the Embassy of Lebanon."</p>
      <p>Addressing the ceremony, the rector of the Ghana Institute of Journalism, Professor Kwamena Kwansah-Aidoo expressed his profound gratitude to the Lebanese community and the Lebanese Embassy for their immense contribution to education in Ghana.</p>
      <p>This year, 16 students were beneficiaries of the Lebanese Scholarship Programme.</p>
