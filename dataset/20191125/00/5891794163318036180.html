      <p>DNIPRO – About two dozen men and women assembled on November 24 in the center of Dnipro, Ukraine's fourth-biggest city, ahead of a yearly worldwide campaign to protest domestic violence against women.<br/><br/>They carried single-letter posters, which together spelled, "Don’t be silent," to start what the UN Women's agency calls, <b><a href="https://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/ending-violence-against-women/take-action/16-days-of-activism">16 days of activism </a></b>against gender-based violence.<br/><br/>Organized by the regional development group Insight Dnipro, its chief coordinator Heorhiy Markov told RFE/RL that, according to police statistics, about 1,000 domestic violence complaints are called in every month in the city of about 1 million people where only one shelter for battered women operates.<br/><br/>The shelter can house up to 14 women, Markov said, adding that the shelter receives 400 phone calls for help per month.<br/><br/>At least 600 women in Ukraine die due to gender-based violence each year, compared to around 170 annual deaths because of the armed conflict in eastern Ukraine, according to the UN.<br/><br/>The problem is <b><a href="https://undpukraine.exposure.co/ukrainians-mobilize-to-stop-violence-against-women">systemic in Ukraine </a></b>where 90 percent of all cases of gender-based violence affect women.<br/><br/>About 1.1 million women in Ukraine experience physical or sexual abuse each year, but only 16 percent report the incidents to police and even less, about 1 percent, turn to medical professionals.<br/><br/>Over the weekend, tens of thousands of people assembled in Paris and Brussels to draw attention to domestic violence ahead of the November 25 International Day for the <b><a href="https://www.un.org/en/events/endviolenceday/">Elimination of Violence Against Women</a></b>, which is promoted by the UN.<br/><br/>About 130 women are believed to have been killed by their partner in France this year, Reuters reported.<br/><br/>Other marches took place in French cities such as Lyon, Strasbourg, Bordeaux, and Lille.</p>
