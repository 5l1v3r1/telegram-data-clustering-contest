      <p>A woman identified as <b>Temitope Akinola</b>, last week Thursday reportedly poisoned her granddaughter with an insecticide, Sniper, to stop her daughter’s marriage to her lover.</p>
      <p>The 42-year-old man who resides in Isote area of Sagamu was arrested on the same day of the incident by men of Ogun State Police Command.</p>
      <p>The spokesperson of the command, Abimbola Oyeyemi, noted that Akinola was arrested following the information made available to the Sagamu Division of police after the death of the child.</p>
      <p>Oyeyemi, while speaking on the incident stated that the suspect has never hidden her hatred for the father of the baby.</p>
      <p>According to a report, Akinola was the only person with the child, while the mother went to take her bath, only for her to come back and met her daughter dead.</p>
      <p>Oyeyemi said, <i>“Upon the information, the DPO, Sagamu Division, Okiki Agunbiade, detailed his detectives to the scene, where the killer grandmother was promptly arrested.”</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“On interrogation, the suspect admitted to killing the baby, because she didn’t like her daughter getting married to the father of the deceased baby.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“She confessed further that when she discovered that her daughter was pregnant, she made an attempt to terminate the pregnancy but her pastor warned her not to do so, hence, she waited for her to be delivered of the baby before carrying out her devilish intention.”</i>

      <p>
        <i>“She explained further that she poisoned the baby with a deadly insecticide known as Sniper.”</i>
      </p>
