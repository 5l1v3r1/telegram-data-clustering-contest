Thats roughly $1.30 per pound, down 4% from last year. The survey results show that retail turkey prices are the lowest since 2010. The shopping list for Farm Bureaus informal survey includes turkey, stuffing, sweet potatoes, rolls with butter, peas, cranberries, a veggie tray, pumpkin pie with whipped cream, and coffee and milk, all in quantities sufficient to serve a family of 10 with plenty for leftovers."/>
