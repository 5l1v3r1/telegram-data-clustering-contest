      <p>Osisa Director Siphosami told Ncube that when he warned against the removal of the late Robert Mugabe from power no one listened to him.</p>
      <p>“Some of us protested against the coup that removed Mugabe and were shouted down.We have repeatedly made it clear that we are against unconstitutional changes of Gov’t. Zanu PF opened this coup door. It must shut it. But closing constitutional means, opens up unconstitutional ones.” Malunga said.</p>
