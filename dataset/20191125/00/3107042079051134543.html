      <p>Southland club cricketers have had a frustrating start to the season, with wet weather playing havoc during the past three weekends.</p>
      <p>Cricket was played on Saturday but only three games were completed.</p>
      <p>In the ILT Premier League, Southland Boys High and Appleby played on the main oval at Queens Park.</p>
      <p>Appleby posted 196, including a 125-run partnership for the fourth wicket between Ankit Pursharthy (70) and Khanin Saikia (64).</p>
      <p>Both were stumped by Benji Culhane off Hayden Hart’s left arm spin-bowling. Hart took five for 25 from eight overs.</p>
      <p>The match was abandoned two overs into the second innings.</p>
      <p>On ground two at Queens Park, Metropolitan scored 119. Isaac Fleury and Jason Osbourne both scored 31. Jason Milne took five for 16 off eight overs for Marist.</p>
      <p>Metro’s opening bowlers Jason Osbourne and Zak Kelly tore through the Marist top order, with the first three batsmen out without scoring. Marist was 22 for six when it was saved by the rain. Osbourne had taken four wickets for 10 runs.</p>
      <p>The match between Waikoikoi and Old Boys did not get started.</p>
      <p>In division one, Te Anau had a thrilling win over Central Western. Central’s James Wadsworth (58) and John White (60) helped their side to 155. In reply Alex Webster (59) and Jimmy Corbett (50) had the locals cruising at 137 for three.</p>
      <p>But the team stuttered to a win with three balls and two wickets to spare.</p>
      <p>Old Boys B beat Albion by 97 runs at Hamilton Park in Gore. Charanjeet Saini (58), Gursharan Athwal (35) and Simran Singh (29) helped set a total of 214 from 40 overs for Old Boys.</p>
      <p>Graham Waddell and Sparks player Ella Brown took three wickets each for Albion.</p>
      <p>For Albion, only Steve Waddell and John Steeghs reached the 20s. Brown was not out on 12 when her team was dismissed for 117.</p>
      <p>The match between Appleby B and Wyndale was abandoned.</p>
      <p>In division two the only match to be completed was in Riversdale. Central Western B batted first and scored 154 for seven from its 40 overs. Riversdale was dismissed for 114 in reply.</p>
