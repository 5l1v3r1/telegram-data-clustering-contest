      <p>The LA Dadekotopon Municipal Assembly (LaDMA) has presented items and cash to physically challenged persons in the municipality to support their livelihood.</p>
      <p>The presentation which was the 10th in a series was part of a package established by law to cushion physically challenged persons through the District Assemblies Common Fund.</p>
      <p>The items presented included chest freezers, photocopier machines, industrial sewing machines, metallic mini shops and cash depending on the needs of each individual beneficiary.</p>
      <p>In a brief message to the beneficiaries, Rev. Nikoi asked them to use both the cash and the items judiciously to improve their lives.</p>
      <p>He said disability did not imply that people lack the abilities to fend for themselves.</p>
      <p>Rev. Nikoi advised them to eschew from any tendency of misappropriating the money since such opportunities were not there for many.</p>
      <p>He said social workers from the municipal office would visit them periodically to ensure that the items and the money were being put to good use.</p>
      <p>Rev. Nikoi asked those yet to receive their package to exercise patience as they would be given theirs as soon as practicable.</p>
