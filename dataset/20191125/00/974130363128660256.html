      <h1>Alex Ferguson Once Said Phil Jones Could Be United's Greatest Ever Player</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Gary Connaughton</a></address>
      <p>If there was one thing to take away from Manchester United's 3-3 draw at Sheffield United, it's that Phil Jones isn't up to playing at that level anymore.</p>
      <p>The defender had an absolute howler. He looked like a one man wrecking ball but not in a good way. The player seemed to fall over more than he managed to stay on his feet, nearly giving away a penalty on one occasion.</p>
      <p>He was hauled off at halftime, something that came as a surprise to nobody.</p>
      <p>Jones has been largely frozen out by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer this season, with Harry Maguire and Victor Lindelof his preferred partnership at the back. Eric Bailly would also be ahead of him if not for injury and Axel Tuanzebe at times as well.</p>
      <p>He got an opportunity yesterday when his side switched to three at the back, but you suspect it could his last one for a while.</p>
      <p>At 27-years old his time at the club is surely coming to an end. Considering the expectations placed on him after his arrival at Old Trafford, this is some fall from grace.</p>
      <p>United forked out £16million for Jones in 2011, a sizeable fee at the time. They beat out competition from Liverpool for his signature. Alex Ferguson expected big things from him, saying at the time that he could go on to become the club's greatest ever player:</p>
      <blockquote>Jones, arguably the way he is looking, could be our best ever player. I think Jones may be one of the best players we have ever had, not matter where we play him.<br/>At 21 years of age, he is going to be a phenomenal player. I think he can play anywhere on the pitch.<br/>He has such a massive influence, with his instinct and reading of the game. He has a drive about him.</blockquote>
      <p>Safe to say it hasn't worked out that way. The fact he has managed to stay at Old Trafford for oveeight years points to the issues at the club.</p>
