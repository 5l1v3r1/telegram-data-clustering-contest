      <p>All of the Ashburton district will be in the Rangitata electorate under proposed boundary changes released today by the Representation Commission.</p>
      <p>Rangitata MP Andrew Falloon said it was a sensible change and made more sense to have all of the Ashburton district in one electorate.</p>
      <p>Now, part of the district - Rakaia, Rokeby, Somerton, Chertsey, Pendarves, Dorie - is in Selwyn.</p>
      <p>The commission said that the Rangitata electorate was 1.4 per cent below population quota, and projected to decline, and population of 3300 had been added from Selwyn.</p>
      <p>Selwyn is 16.5 per cent over quota so must lose population, including the area south of the Rakaia River.</p>
      <p>Mr Falloon said he relished the opportunity to represent communities like Rakaia, Chertsey, Lauriston, Pendarves and Dorie.</p>
      <p>Throughout this parliamentary term he and retiring Selwyn MP Amy Adams had operated a "no-wrong-door'' approach to anyone on the Ashburton side of the Rakaia who had been in the Selwyn electorate, giving people the choice of coming to his office.</p>
      <p>Mr Falloon said he thought he had put forward a compelling case to the commission.</p>
