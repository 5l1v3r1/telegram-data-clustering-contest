      <p>After a 12-year delay, work has resumed on the Sofoline-Abuakwa Interchange project. This follows the release of funding by government.</p>
      <p>It is the second time in a year government has released funds for the project which is 9-years behind schedule.</p>
      <p>The amount released is less than 40 per cent of the $32 million certificates raised by contractors.</p>
      <p>Nhyira News sources say management of the China Geo-Engineering Corporation said “we have been given something to start working though it is not enough. Currently, as you can see we are working. We are here working.," Safety Officer of CGC, Twumasi Ankrah revealed.</p>
      <p>Contractors return to site has been a welcomed relieve for motorists on the main Kumasi-Sunyani road.</p>
      <p>They have had to endure undue hardship as a result of heavy vehicular traffic on the Apatrapa-Abuakwa section of the road.</p>
      <p>The project has 5-main components, including widening of Komfo Anokye-Abuakwa road and construction of an interchange at Sofoline and Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital.</p>
      <p>The project also involves the construction of 5-underpass bridges.</p>
      <p>It was envisaged to solve the heavy vehicular traffic jam on the Komfo Anokye Hospital Sofoline-Abuakwa road.</p>
      <p>Work has only been done on the Bekwai Roundabout-Sofoline-Apatrapa Junction section, leaving the Apatrapa-Junction-Abuakwa section with heavy congestion.</p>
      <p>Residents of Abuakwa and its environs last month hit the streets over what they said was government's failure to complete the project.</p>
      <p>But contractors are back to site to install safety measures on the road. The portion of the Apatrapa Junction-Tanoso road, as well as the Prempeh College portion, are being graded as workers begin new work order.</p>
      <p>Lighting, especially on the interchange has been improved as an underpass pedestrian tunnel installed with CCTV cameras is opened to traffic.</p>
      <p>" We are improving safety because when you are driving on the bridge, you need to have visibility. At the moment what you see being painted is the base and then they will bring in the white to warn drivers that this is where they are to drive to so that they would not topple over.</p>
      <p>“The grader and bulldozer are also working at the other side of the road, " he said.</p>
      <p>According to Mr Ankrah, several other works will follow to mark the return of contractors.</p>
