      <p>On International Women’s Day 2019 the UK’s first Barbara Cox Woman of the Year Award was presented to Beryl Carney, Head of Commercial Vehicles at JCT600.</p>
      <p>Beryl was presented with the award in recognition of exceptional leadership skills that saw her design and deliver a successful strategy, generating excellent financial results and outstanding customer service scores.</p>
      <p>Under her leadership, the commercial vehicle division of JCT600 won a host of Volkswagen Commercial Vehicle and JCT600 awards, and Beryl herself was presented with the coveted Volkswagen gold pin in recognition of her contribution to the brand.</p>
      <p>Speaking about Beryl’s win Martin Forbes, Chief Executive Officer of Cox Automotive UK said: “Our Women With Drive programme exists to encourage women to consider a career in automotive, and I can’t think of a better way to do that than by showcasing inspirational leaders like Beryl.”</p>
