      <p>LONDON (AP) - The incoming CEO of Britain’s governing body for track and field has resigned before starting work amid questions over her husband’s conduct.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/uk-athletics/">UK Athletics</a> chairman Chris Cook says in a statement that he met with new CEO Zara Hyde Peters on Sunday and “we have agreed together that she will now not be taking up her position.”</p>
      <p>Hyde Peters had been due to start Dec. 1.</p>
      <p>The Times newspaper reported that Hyde Peters’ husband had been banned from working as a school teacher but later coached athletes at a club where his wife was an official.</p>
      <p>A British teaching regulatory panel ruled in 2012 that Mike Peters had exchanged “inappropriate photographs” with a 15-year-old girl, amounting to “unacceptable professional conduct.” He was cleared of sexual misconduct.</p>
