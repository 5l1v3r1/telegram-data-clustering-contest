        <b>American superstar Megan Rapinoe's team Reign FC are in negotiations to be bought out by the owners of current women's European champions Lyon, both teams said on Monday.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>OL Group, which owns Lyon's men's and women's teams, said in a statement that the move will consolidate their position as the "top women's football group in the world"</b>.</p>
      <p>Lyon president <b>Jean-Michel Aulas unveiled at the club's most recent AGM plans to expand his team's brand</b> in both the United States and China and earmarked a budget for the purchase of an American franchise.</p>
      <p>Based in Tacoma near Seattle, <b>Reign FC will start their eighth season in the American National Women's Soccer League</b> next term and have on their roster FIFA's women's world player of the year Megan Rapinoe.</p>
      <p>Rapinoe, 34, was joint top scorer with six goals at this year's women's <b>World Cup -- won by the United States -- and bagged the Golden Boot</b>.</p>
      <p>She also won the <b>Golden Ball</b> for the best player and became the face of the tournament for her outspoken views on US president Donald Trump and campaigning for LGBT rights.</p>
      <p><b>Rapinoe played for Lyon in between 2013 and 2014</b>, with fellow USA forward <b>Alex Morgan</b> briefly playing for the six-time Champions League winners in 2017.</p>

      <p><b>Reign FC said Monday that they expected to conclude a deal with OL Group</b> before the end of January.</p>
      <p>"<b>Our ambition has always been to operate the best women's football club </b>in the world," said Reign FC's majority owner Bill Predmore.</p>
      <p>"<b>This is a distinction long held by OL</b>, making them the perfect organisation to help us achieve our long-term objectives for the club."</p>
      <p>With thirteen consecutive domestic league titles and six Champions League, Lyon's women's outfit fit that bill.</p>
      <p>Reign midfielder Jess Fishlock told her club website she was massively behind the move.</p>
      <p>"<b>Lyon and Reign are both amazing organisations</b> and I am so proud to have played for both clubs," she said.</p>
      <p>"Bringing the clubs together is for me the perfect combination â- I literally can't think of a better outcome for two clubs who are so dedicated to the growth of the women's game."</p>
