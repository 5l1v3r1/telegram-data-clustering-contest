      <p>The University of the South Pacific Vice Chancellor, Professor Pal Ahluwalia says the Special Council has established a three person committee to oversee the recommendations submitted by the Independent Investigation Company BDO from Auckland.</p>
      <p>This is regarding the allegations which were laid out in a leaked confidential report which was presented to the Executive Committee of the USP Council in March this year.</p>
      <p>The three person committee is made of the Prime Minister of the Cook Islands, the Deputy Prime Minister of Samoa and the Attorney General of Fiji.</p>
      <p>He says the Council has also approved a commission which will implement the findings and develop an action plan which would be made publicly available.</p>
      <p>Ahluwalia says that 75% to 80% of the allegations that he had made were recognised by BDO as true which is why they set up the Commission.</p>
      <p>The USP Vice Chancellor adds he and his family have been victimized and ill-treated in this process despite him not gaining anything from the exposure. He did not reveal who had victimized and ill-treated him and his family.</p>
      <p>The three member committee will meet with the Commission in Auckland tomorrow.</p>
