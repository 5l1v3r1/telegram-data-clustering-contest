      <p>The commerce ministry has initiated a probe to review the need to continue imposition of existing anti-dumping duty on Chinese nylon tyre cord fabric following complaints from domestic industry, according to a notification.</p>
      <p>Association of Synthetic Fibre Industry, on behalf of its members -- SRF Ltd and Century Enka Ltd -- have filed a review petition for continued imposition of anti-dumping duty on the imports of nylon tyre cord fabric from China.</p>
      <p>The ministry's investigation arm - Directorate General of Trade Remedies (DGTR) - in a notification said that the petitioner have submitted evidence that there is a likelihood of continuation/ recurrence of dumping by Chinese firms into India.</p>
      <p>"The authority hereby initiates a sunset review investigation to review the need for continued imposition of the duties in force in respect of the subject goods, originating in or exported from China," the notification said.</p>
      <p>The directorate will examine whether the expiry of the duty is likely to lead to continuation or recurrence of dumping and injury to the domestic industry.</p>
      <p>The period of investigation for the present probe is July 2018 to June 2019 (12 Months). It would examine the data for the period 2016-19.</p>
      <p>The duty on the product was imposed in April 2005 for the first time. It was again imposed in June 2015 for a period of five years.</p>
      <p>As a counter measure, they impose duties under the multilateral regime of the World Trade Organization.</p>
      <p>The duty is aimed at ensuring fair trade practices and creating a level-playing field for domestic producers with regard to foreign producers and exporters.</p>
