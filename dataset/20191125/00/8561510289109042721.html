      <h1>Uber Just Got Kicked Out of London</h1>

      <h3>Shame On Me</h3>
      <p>Uber has been stripped of its operating license in the city of London — for the second time.</p>
      <p>London’s transportation bureau, Transport for London, <a href="https://gizmodo.com/uber-loses-operating-license-in-london-again-over-saf-1840027267">told <i>Gizmodo</i></a> that it’s observed a “pattern of failures” by Uber, and that it can’t allow the company to continue operation until it puts better passenger safety protocols in place. It’s the second time <a href="https://futurism.com/soon-uber-wont-be-allowed-to-operate-in-a-major-urban-metropolis">London has booted Uber</a> over safety concerns, and the yet another stage in an exhausting legal battle between the two.</p>
      <h3>Unauthorized Drivers</h3>
      <p>The main issue involves Uber’s apparent inability to verify that drivers are who they claim to be. Transport for London told <i>Gizmodo</i> that <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/driver-ubers-algorithm-assaulted-passenger">unauthorized drivers</a> had shuttled thousands of passengers around the city. Some of the drivers had already had their licenses revoked.</p>
      <p>“A key issue identified was that a change to Uber’s systems allowed unauthorized drivers to upload their photos to other Uber driver accounts,” the transportation bureau told <i>Gizmodo</i>. “This allowed them to pick up passengers as though they were the booked driver, which occurred in at least 14,000 trips — putting passenger safety and security at risk.”</p>
      <h3>Forever War</h3>
      <p>Uber, however, doesn’t plan on leaving. When London first tried to boot Uber from the city in 2017, the company <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/ubers-london-license-renewed">successfully appealed</a> to extend its stay.</p>
      <p>And the past is prelude. Uber told <i>Gizmodo</i> that it plans to do the same this time around and expects to continue with business as usual.</p>
