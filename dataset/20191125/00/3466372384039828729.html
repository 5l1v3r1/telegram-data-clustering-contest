      <p>Amid the flurry of claims and counter-claims made by leaders from all the four major political parties -- the Nationalist Congress Party, Bharatiya Janata Party, Shiv Sena, Congress -- in Maharashtra, its spokesmen aren't shying away from scoring political points at every opportunity.</p>
      <p>When asked about <a href="https://news.rediff.com/commentary/2019/nov/25/ajit-pawar-ncps-plan-a-was-to-ally-with-bjp/48ab4e457f8b1e13c008e18cb3e23637"><b>Ajit Pawar's claims that the NCP had originally thought of aligning with the BJP</b></a> and the plan of joining hands with the Shiv Sena came much later, the NCP's Nawab Malik was quick to respond: "Ajit Pawar negotiated a deal with the BJP all by himself; he would know."</p>
      <p>"How will I know if Ajit<i>dada</i> said anything like this and how will I know if someone met Amit<i>bhai</i> (<i>BJP President Amit Anilchandra Shah</i>)?" asked the BJP's Madhav Bhandari.</p>
      <p>When asked about Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis's fate after the floor test in the state assembly, both Bhandari and Malik were gung-ho about their parties's respective victories.</p>
      <p>"<i>Bilkul nahin! aur</i> numbers <i>badhenge</i> (<i>Of course not! the numbers will increase</i>)," declared Malik, claiming that his party was not worried about cross-voting by NCP MLAs in favour of the BJP even if there were to be a secret ballot.</p>
      <p>"Some more NCP MLAs are in touch with us and we will also get their letters of support and votes on the floor of the House," Malik added confidently.</p>
      <p>"We will have to prove our majority and we are very well prepared for that. We have more than 145 MLAs to prove our strength in the House," Bhandari stated.</p>
      <p>"We don't believe in showing off how many MLAs will vote for us," Bhandari added. "Everybody will see it on that day," taking a jibe at the Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress leaders's visit to Raj Bhavan on Monday morning to submit letters of support from 162 MLAs.</p>
      <p>According to Bhandari, the Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress have been on the defensive since Sunday when the Supreme Court asked if they had approached the governor to stake a claim to form the government.</p>
      <p>"Their lawyer Kapil Sibal's face-saver was: 'I don't have any idea'," Bhandari said.</p>
      <p>Malik, who seemed to be in a relaxed mood after his party successfully weaned back 10 NCP MLAs who had gone with Ajit Pawar to attend the swearing-in ceremony on November 23, responded with an Urdu couplet when asked about the Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress bid to form the next government in the face of extreme difficulties.</p>
      <p>"<i>Idhar falak ko zidd hai bijliyan girane ki</i> (<i>The sky is firm to hit us with lightning and destroy us</i>); <i>Udhar hamen bhi hai dhun aashiyana banane ki</i> (<i>But we are also equally determined to build our house</i>)."</p>
      <p>Asked if the Jigar Muradabadi couplet would return to haunt the Sena-NCP-Congress combine, Malik said, "We will comfortably sail through this sea of fire."</p>
