Ms Mrema has published several articles related to international environmental law, compliance and enforcement of conventions and developed, among others, a number of multilateral environmental agreements negotiation tools, handbooks and guidelines currently used by UNEP in its capacity-building programmes.</p>
      <p>Prior to joining the Law Division in June 2014, she was the Deputy Director of the Ecosystems Division, in charge of coordination, operations and programme delivery from 2012 and for one year, also served as Acting Director to the same Division. She received in 2004 the first-ever UNEP-wide Best Manager of the Year Award, titled the UNEP Baobab Staff Award, for exceptional performance and dedication towards achieving the goals of UNEP.</p>
      <p>In 2009, she was appointed as the executive secretary of the UNEP/Secretariat of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS).</p>
      <p>Before joining UNEP, Ms Mrema worked with the ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation in Tanzania and left as a Counsellor/Senior Legal Counsel.
