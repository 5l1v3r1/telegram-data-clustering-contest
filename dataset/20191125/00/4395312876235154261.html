        <i>I had the pleasure of interviewing Malynda Hale. Malynda is a singer/songwriter, owner of JMV Entertainment and creator of #WeNeedToTalk, the podcast.</i>

        <b>Thank you for joining us! Can you share a story with us about what brought you to this specific career path?</b>
      </p>
      <p>I was raised around music, my dad was a former musician and my grandma was a singer as well so music was always a part of my life. But when I was 5 I remember hearing Whitney Houston sing the National anthem at the Super Bowl and I knew that‚Äôs what I wanted to for the rest of my life. To be able to impact and inspire that many people with your voice was so incredible to me.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Can you tell us the most interesting story that happened to you since you began your career?</b>
      </p>
      <p>It may not be as interesting to others but one of my favorite moments was getting to open for OTOWN at the Troubadour in Los Angeles. They were one of my absolute favorite boy bands and it was such a cool moment for me to meet them, open for them and now call some of them friends. It was crazy to remember being such a fan girl and then there I was on the same stage. It felt great.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Can you share a story about the funniest mistake you made when you were first starting? Can you tell us what lesson you learned from that?</b>
      </p>
      <p>I would say forgetting the lyrics to one of your own songs is definitely up there haha! The lesson I learned from that is to always prepare no matter how familiar you think you are with the material.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What are some of the most interesting or exciting projects you are working on now?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The podcast and blog I have right now is definitely a passion project for me and I‚Äôm really excited about where it can grow. #WeNeedToTalk was built from my love for conversation and hot topics and I wanted to find a way to incorporate both. The podcast started earlier this year and seeing how much traction I get on twitter and FB starting a blog to coincide with the podcast made the most sense. So it‚Äôs given me another platform to share my opinions and views with the world.</p>

        <b>We are very interested in diversity in the entertainment industry. Can you share three reasons with our readers about why you think it‚Äôs important to have diversity represented in film and television? How can that potentially affect our culture?</b>
      </p>
      <p>I tried to think of three reasons but truthfully I think it boils down to one. Anytime you are exposed to people that are not like you, you broaden your horizons and life experiences. We are all humans but we are all humans with different experiences because of our background and heritage. Some people aren‚Äôt able to get out of their hometown bubbles to surround themselves with other people that don‚Äôt look or even think like them. So Hollywood specifically has a great opportunity to expose others to different races and cultures in a positive way so that people‚Äôs perceptions can be altered. That to me is the starting point.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What are your ‚Äú5 things I wish someone told me when I first started‚Äù and why. Please share a story or example for each.</b>
      </p>
      <p>1. Stop comparing yourself to others. Your journey is uniquely yours and yours only. It‚Äôs so hard to not get consumed by the glitz and glamor that is social media and see what others have accomplished and wonder why you haven‚Äôt accomplished that yourself. But I wish it was ingrained in me to not think that way and just focus on me.</p>
      <p>2. It‚Äôs okay to fail because failure can bring you a different perspective and perhaps a new path to help you get to where you want to be quicker. I wish I learned this quicker, and honestly I‚Äôm still learning it. Failure frightens a lot of people, me included, but I need to constantly remind myself that failure in the moment doesn‚Äôt mean failure forever.</p>
      <p>3. Don‚Äôt take the first opportunity that comes your way. We have this sense of urgency because we are hungry for success but I made a lot of career mistakes getting involved with the wrong people for reasons that I thought would help further my career and they ended up hindering me. Take time to make the right decision.</p>
      <p>4. It‚Äôs not about connections, it‚Äôs about relationships. When you focus on fostering real lasting and genuine relationships people will naturally be in your corner.</p>
      <p>5. Everyone is different so just be you. That‚Äôs the one thing I wish I learned earlier instead of trying to fit the mold, just be who you are and the rest will come.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Which tips would you recommend to your colleagues in your industry to help them to thrive and not ‚Äúburn out‚Äù?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Take time for yourself and take a break from social media. It can be draining trying to keep up with it but it‚Äôs important to unplug every once in awhile.</p>
      <p>
        <b>You are a person of enormous influence. If you could inspire a movement that would bring the most amount of good to the most amount of people, what would that be? You never know what your idea can trigger.¬†üôÇ</b>
      </p>
      <p>When I released my single ‚ÄúStory‚Äù earlier this year I had proposed to LA Mission a Social media campaign called ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs Your Story?‚Äù to bring light and attention to some of the homeless community within their organization that they have helped and have people learn their stories. They didn‚Äôt end up using the campaign but I would love to figure out a way to put a non-exploitative spotlight on people who are within the homeless community so that the negative perceptions about them are altered. Everyone has a story and I think if people who aren‚Äôt in that position realized how easy it is to have your life flipped upside down they might be more willing to help and not judge.</p>
      <p>
        <b>None of us are able to achieve success without some help along the way. Is there a particular person who you are grateful towards who helped get you to where you are? Can you share a story about that?</b>
      </p>
      <p>You know I haven‚Äôt reached the level of success that I‚Äôve always envisioned for myself but I‚Äôve definitely had people champion me along the way. The easiest answers are my family and husband but one person in particular is my former theatre teacher Clark Sayre. Clark was my teacher in 5th grade, Junior high and 2 years in high school. He was an integral part in my growth as a performer and to this day he has continued to support my career endeavors. It‚Äôs teachers like him that truly help people to achieve their dreams.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Can you please give us your favorite ‚ÄúLife Lesson Quote‚Äù? Can you share how that was relevant to you in your life?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Pay it forward. No matter where you are in your life whether you have succeeded or not, always pay it forward. I believe when you bless other people, you are blessed. Plus it‚Äôs the right thing to do, there‚Äôs room at the table for everyone.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Is there a person in the world, or in the US whom you would love to have a private breakfast or lunch with, and why? He or she might just see this, especially if we tag them.¬†üôÇ</b>
      </p>
      <p>There are three artists that have inspired my music and songwriting so much. India Arie, Gavin DeGraw and Sara Bareilles. Just to be able to sit down with any of them and pick their brains or even write with them and sing with them would be a dream come true. I‚Äôve met quite a few people in my life that have inspired me or made a difference in my artistry but they are three people I would love to have a one on one musical mentorship with!</p>
