      <p>Greek parliamentarians conclude their debate over the proposed revisions to the constitution with the changes going to a vote tonight, Monday, after the conclusion of the Prime Minister and the other party leaders’ speeches.</p>
      <p>The three main issues that attract the attention during the voting process on the final proposals are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The procedure for the election of the President of Republic</li>
        <li>The voting right of the Greeks Abroad</li>
        <li>The ministers’ criminal liability</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The articles under revision must collect 180 votes at least from the 300-member Greek parliament in order to be approved.</p>
      <p>During the week long debate at the plenary as well as at the parliament’s committee for the Revision of the Constitution, there were intense political disagreements and a number of arguments. However, after mutual concessions, a common ground was found for the some changes.</p>
