      <p>A woman identified as Rukayat AbdulRaheem was arraigned before the Osun State Magistrates Court sitting in Osogbo on Friday for throwing her son into a well.</p>
      <p>The 33-year-old housewife reportedly threw her three-year-old son, AbdulGaniyu, into a well, which led his death.</p>
      <p>The accused who had been charged with one count of murder had on November 17, 2019, around 5.30 am on Tokotaya Street, Kola Balogun area of Osogbo threw her son into a well.</p>
      <p>The offence was said to be contrary to and punishable under Section 319(1) of the Criminal Code, Cap 34 Vol. 2, Laws of Osun State of Nigeria, 2002.</p>
      <p>Due to the nature of the case, the plea of the accused was not taken.</p>
      <p>The counsel for the accused, Muideen Adeoye, objected to the reading of the charge and pleaded that the court should return Rukayat to police custody for further investigation on the matter.</p>
      <p>The application was, however, opposed by the police prosecutor, Temitope Fatoba. He noted that the charge sheet used to arraign the accused was prepared by a legal practitioner.</p>
      <p>The Magistrate, Olusegun Ayilara, in his ruling ordered the accused to be remanded in the Ilesha Correctional Centre.</p>
      <p>He adjourned the matter till December 4, 2019, for a ruling.</p>
