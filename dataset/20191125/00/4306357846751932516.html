      <h3>Jurgen Klopp has revealed that he opted to rest Mohamed Salah for Liverpool FC’s 2-1 win at Crystal Palace in the Premier League on Saturday afternoon.</h3>
      <p>The Egypt international pulled out of national team duty due to an ongoing ankle issue but he was named on the bench for Liverpool FC’s trip to Selhurst Park.</p>
      <p>Salah did not end up featuring for the Reds as goals from Sadio Mane and Roberto Firmino wrapped up a 12th Premier League win of the season for Jurgen Klopp’s men in London.</p>
      <p>Klopp has now revealed that he simply took the opportunity to rest Salah for the game and confirmed that the attacker will be back in action when Liverpool FC take on Napoli in the Champions League on Wednesday night.</p>
      <p>Speaking at his post-match <a href="https://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/first-team/374441-mohamed-salah-fitness-latest-post-crystal-palace">news conference</a>, Klopp said: “Mo is all good.</p>
      <p>“He couldn’t train for nine days; he was with the Egyptian national team, went home and trained kind of 60 or 70 per cent the day before yesterday.</p>
      <p>“Yesterday was the first time 100 per cent, so we had then to make the decision of whether we started him or not.</p>
      <p>“We didn’t start him, we wanted to bring him on as you probably saw but then we scored. So, we could rest him today, that’s really good and Wednesday he will be back.”</p>
      <p>Liverpool FC are currently flying high at the top of the Premier League table after having won 12 of their 13 games in the top flight this season.</p>
      <p>They have only dropped points once so far this season – during a 1-1 draw with Manchester United – and they are currently the heavy favourites to win the title this season.</p>
      <p>The Reds will return to Premier League action with a home clash against Brighton and Hove Albion next weekend.</p>
