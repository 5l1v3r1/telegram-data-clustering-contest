      <h1>Nampak loses nearly R2bn amid crisis in Zimbabwean currency</h1>

      <p>The share price of packaging group Nampak fell to a more than two-decade low on Monday, after it warned headline earnings had plummeted in its year to end-September due to a R1.9bn foreign-exchange loss in Zimbabwe.</p>
      <p>The company’s share price slid as much as 10.8% in morning trade on Monday, with the group also warning it seen higher than anticipated effective tax charges during the period.</p>
      <p>This was due to legislative changes in Angola that capped the deductibility of foreign-exchange losses.</p>
      <p>The group, which has a market capitalisation of R4.6bn, expects a headline loss for continuing and discontinued operations of between 18.9c and 19.9c, from headline earnings per share of 173.3c previously.</p>
      <p>The company also expects a loss per share from continuing and discontinued operations of between 129.5c and 136.1c, from earnings per share of 76c previously.</p>
      <p>Headline earnings per share exclude capital profits, but include foreign-exchange losses. Earnings per share include capital profits, as well as asset impairments.</p>
      <p>The company has previously warned currency volatility in Angola and Zimbabwe were significantly weighing on its performance.</p>
      <p>This was part of the reason it opted not to resume dividend payments for its six months to end-March, although finalisation of the disposal of its glass business was also a factor.</p>
      <p>In September, the company announced it had sold that business to Isanti Glass 1 for R1.5bn, an entity 60% held by black-owned investment company Kwande, and 40%-owned by a subsidiary of AB InBev.</p>
      <p>At 1.43pm Nampak’s share price was 6.56% lower at R6.70, having earlier fallen as much as 10.8% to R6.39, its worst level since December 1998. – Business Day</p>
