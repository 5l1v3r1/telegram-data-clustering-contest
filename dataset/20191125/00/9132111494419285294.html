      <p>A trader who allegedly chewed off the forefinger of a police officer has been remanded by an Accra Circuit Court.</p>
      <p>General Sergeant Kwame Abu together with other officers had gone to effect the arrest of the suspect, Promise Anoma, but during a scuffle, his forefinger slipped into the suspect’s mouth and he sank his teeth into it.</p>
      <p>Chief Inspector Emmanuel Ohene Agyei who is prosecuting the case told the court presided over by Mrs. Jane Harriet Akweley Quaye that on November 03, 2019, together with three other officers had gone to arrest the accused whom a witness had reported a case against at the Nungua Police station.</p>
      <p>According to the prosecutor, when the officers arrested the suspect and were leading him to their vehicle he requested to make a call but was told he could make the call while in the vehicle.</p>
      <p>The suspect, however, refused to join the vehicle and attacked one of the officers.</p>
      <p>Sergeant Abu, however, prevented him from doing so and in the process, his forefinger slipped into the mouth of suspect mouth who sank his teeth into it and bit it off.</p>
      <p>The officers, therefore, called for reinforcement to transport the suspect to the Police Station.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the 25-year-old Promise Anoma, has pleaded not guilty to resisting arrest and causing harm and will reappear before the court on Friday, November 29.</p>
