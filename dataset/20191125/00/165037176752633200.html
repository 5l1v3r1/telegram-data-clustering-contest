        <b>Real Madrid announced the 19 man squad to face Paris Saint Germain in the Champions League. Zidane has put out the same squad against Real Sociedad, so Vinicius Junior has once again been left out.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Zinedine Zidane has selected against PSG the same squad as the one he chose for the Real Sociedad match, so <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/vinicius-junior-358618/">Vinicius Junior</a> <b>is out of the 19 man squad to face </b>PSG at the Santiago Bernabeu. </p>
      <p><b>The news means that Vinicius Junior is once again out of the squad</b>. Far from continuing to prove himself after being key last year under under Solari, <b>the Brazilian has fallen by the wayside</b> under Zidane. </p>
      <p>This is the third time that the winger has been in the stand in the last month, the second consecutive month. <b>Vinicius was left out of the matches </b>against Galatasaray and Real Sociedad and he has also played less.<b> He has started just four times this season</b>; the last time was on 19th October against Mallorca. </p>
      <p>Vinicius' situation contrasts with that of <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/rodrygo-365923/">Rodrygo</a>, who has formed part of each of the last seven squad lists.<b> The hat-trick against Galatasaray</b> was a real turning point and he has started four of the last five matches. </p>
      <p><b>This is the 19 man squad chosen by Zidane</b>: Courtois, Areola and Altube; Carvajal, Militao, Ramos, Varane, Marcelo and Mendy; Kroos, Modric, Casemiro, Valverde and Isco: Hazard, Benzema, Bale, Jovi and Rodrygo. </p>
