      <h1>How To Connect Today’s Lunch To A Motivating Purpose</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Nell Derick Debevoise</a></address>
      <p>Despite having spent my entire professional life in the variously-called, “purpose economy,” “social enterprise sector,” or “impact organizations,” I always feel a bit squeamish talking about ‘purpose,’ much less proclaiming my own. Purpose statements, whether individual or organizational, feel lofty, abstract, and ungrounded, which drives me nuts, as a Type A, action-oriented, pragmatist. I’ve seen many other professionals struggle with purpose in similar ways. At the same time, I believe the ample academic research and first-hand experience from wise and diverse voices that having a sense of purpose is good for us, as individuals, organizations, and communities. Indeed, I’ve built a business on the premise that purpose drives performance.</p>

      <p>I’ve resolved this apparent conflict by recognizing two mundane and concrete building blocks that underlie purpose. Particularly in this age of ‘peak purpose,’ it’s critical to make these terms tangible and specific to avoid devaluing as meaningless essential lenses for our survival and thriving as individuals and societies. This first component of purpose is impact, which can be simply understood as the outcomes of our actions on the people and place around us. Newton’s Cradle is a perfect visual to understand impact: the laws of physics that state for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. Second is the meaning we drive from that impact: in other words, the story we tell ourselves and others about the impact we create in the world.</p>
      <p>For example, if I do a diversity and inclusion audit of my team’s hiring process, the impacts might include some extra work for my team members who have to collect the data; insights about shortcomings, bias, or strengths of our hiring process; and learning about our individual assumptions about talent. I could take this effort to be meaningful for the learning by me and my team, improving our team’s performance by expanding the range of talent we attract, or contributing to reducing the wage and wealth gaps in our economy.</p>

      <p>In the personal realm, if I uphold a commitment to eating a plant-based diet four days a week, there are several impacts. I reduce the carbon output associated with my consumption, set an example for friends and family around me, improve my personal health outcomes, and partially distance myself from the raising and killing of animals for my food. There are several ‘meanings’ that I could draw from these impacts. Perhaps reducing my contribution to environmental degradation through carbon emissions is most meaningful to me. Or it could be that I prioritize my physical well-being now and as I age so that I can best provide for and lead my family or team.</p>
      <p>From the ‘objective’ impacts of our individual efforts, we each make meaning about the significance of those outcomes. Or we don’t. But who do you think will implement more learnings from the diversity audit or maintain the four days per week of plant-based eating? The person who’s doing it out of compliance with a rule or guideline, or desire to keep up with a trend they observe? Or the person who connects those actions to whatever larger meaning has the most significance for themselves?</p>
      <p>This connection of our actions to the meaning they have – for us personally, not for our bosses, auditors, regulators, or social media audiences – is what underlies the benefits of meaning. We feel engaged, motivated, and rewarded by doing things that we see to have significance in some way that’s good for the people and places around us. These feelings lead to the productivity, performance, and satisfaction that research shows are higher among people who identify as having meaning in their work and lives.</p>
      <p>It’s also important to recognize the profoundly personal nature of these meanings. There’s not a ‘right’ meaning to derive from a certain action. This is not to say that there aren’t things that are better or worse for the world. But it’s important to recognize that two colleagues might feel profoundly engaged in and satisfied by the same work for different reasons.</p>
      <p>For guidance on where you might derive meaning from your work, use a framework known as job crafting. Researchers found that every job has tasks, relationships, and context, which professionals can reframe or modify to enhance their sense of meaning at work. Read <a href="https://positiveorgs.bus.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/What-is-Job-Crafting-and-Why-Does-it-Matter1.pdf">the original academic article describing the framework here</a>, or watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14wOMAd_4s8">this quick 2.5 minute video</a> explaining it.</p>

      <p>One of the most vivid illustrations of job crafting is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FRpqInJ2dw">this delightful video of a traffic cop dancing in the midst of rush hour traffic</a>. Imagine the quality of air she’s breathing, commuters’ commentary, and the physical risk of standing amidst rushing vehicles. The researchers asked her how and why she was so joyful doing what seems to be a really difficult gig. She explained: “I am responsible for getting 30,000 people home safely to their families every day. What better impact could I achieve in an eight-hour shift?” In a situation where the tasks of a job would be hard to link to very significant meaning, and relationships are distant if not adversarial, this woman successfully laddered up to the context of what she’s doing to find meaning.</p>
      <p>This example is such a brilliant reminder of the fact that we do not have to be engaged in lifesaving cancer research or working directly with the most challenged populations, whether refugees or immigrants or survivors of domestic violence. There are many more mundane ways that can have real significant meaning. Based on this broad understanding of the impact we have, and the possibility of connecting it to a larger meaning that is personally significant to us, let’s see how this all connects to the highest and loftiest broadest element or purpose.</p>
      <p>While it is intimidating for many of us to commit to an eloquent ten-word statement about why we wake up every morning, we can’t avoid having impact on the people and places around us. As we get more mindful about these impacts (because <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/nelldebevoise/2019/03/28/the-first-step-toward-purpose-that-most-of-us-skip/">mindfulness is the first, unavoidable step to purpose</a>), their meaning becomes more vivid too. And from this growing pile of evidence of what we care about in the world, certain themes start to emerge.</p>
      <p>Maybe you realize that in the past year, you’ve instituted walking meetings for your team’s weekly catchup, committed to cooking your family a plant-based diet four days a week, and developing a niche with clients in the agriculture industry. This same set of actions could be explained because you understand your purpose as, “Building a coalition of people committed to regenerating our planet through what we eat,” or equally, “Promoting understanding of and access to healthy lifestyles.” On the other hand, someone who understands their purpose to be, “Unlocking human potential by connecting people from diverse backgrounds,” might do these same actions and find great meaning in them, but not necessarily find them to be the most purposeful elements of their day.</p>

      <p>All of the myriad actions we take each day have impact. We may not take the time to recognize the meaning from everything we do, particularly when we’re feeling busy, stressed, or overwhelmed. And even if we do connect the dots between an activity, its impact, and how it’s meaningful, not all of them will ladder up to our overriding purpose. It’s not that those “less purpose-aligned” actions don't feel good and have positive ripples for the people and places around us. They just don’t create the potently motivating force and sense of flow that research has linked to doing work with purpose.</p>
      <p>So if you are daunted by the idea of sitting down to script a purpose statement, but compelled by the research and anecdotal examples in your life of the benefits of living and working with purpose, start paying attention to what impacts most catch your attention. Keep a simple daily or weekly log of things you did that felt meaningful, whether right away or with the benefit of a few days or weeks of distance. After a few months of keeping these notes (I love Evernote for this kind of tracking if you’re opposed to carrying an actual physical notebook), <a href="https://www.wordclouds.com/">use a word cloud generator</a> to find themes, or a highlighter to identify recurring words.</p>
      <p>If some technical assistance appeals, check out PurposeMatch’s algorithm-based individual purpose assessment. (Disclosure: my company partners with PurposeMatch – <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/partnership-activate-purpose-nell-derick-debevoise/">more on that partnership here</a>.) This tool provides immediate insights about your unique strengths and the areas of impact you care about, which can be a useful complement to your day-to-day observations.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, if you love nothing more than a whiteboard session with yourself, colleagues or friends to wordsmith a purpose statement as you look to the year (or decade!) ahead, go for it! Your next steps are to break that rallying cry down into the day-to-day impacts you’re going to have, so that you can hold yourself accountable for whether you’re living your purpose in a more concrete way.</p>
      <p>The important point is that purpose is an iterative concept, that we have to connect to tangible impact and the meaning it has to us. Enjoying the benefits (motivation, productivity, fulfillment, reduced anxiety and stress, better sleep, and more) of purpose requires this back and forth laddering up and down from our specific actions to their larger significance, and then the broader goal they advance. Because we are dynamic beings living in fast-changing times, it’s essential to observe, reflect on, and document these three elements on an ongoing basis.</p>
      <p>After all, you have multiple impacts every single day. The things you buy, the work you do, the interactions you have, and the way you care for yourself all ripple out and affect people and places near and far. Don’t you want to take advantage of the opportunity to link these elements of everyday life to their potential power to solve the problems you care most about?</p>
