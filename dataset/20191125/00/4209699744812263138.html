      <p>A 34-year-old woman, Chineye, on Monday appeared before an Ikeja Chief Magistrates’ Court for allegedly selling her one-day-old female baby for N300, 000.</p>
      <p>The alleged buyer, Happiness, 49, who was arraigned alongside the defendant, was charged with unlawful adoption of the baby, according to the News Agency of Nigeria.</p>
      <p>The duo, whose residential addresses were not given, is facing a three-count of conspiracy, child trafficking and unlawful adoption.</p>
      <p>They however, pleaded not guilty to the charge.</p>
      <p>The prosecutor, ASP Ezekiel Ayorinde, told the court that the defendants committed the offences on October 4 at 10:00pm at Sari Iganmu, Orile, Lagos.</p>
      <p>According to him, the duo conspired to engage in child trafficking.</p>
      <p>Ayorinde told the court that the arrest of the two women followed information received by the police that Happiness was in possession of a baby suspected to have been stolen.</p>
      <p>He said that the offences contravened Sections 269, 276 and 411 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State 2015 (revised).</p>
      <p>The Chief Magistrate, Mrs B. O. Osunsanmi, admitted the defendants to bail in the sum of N200,000 each with two sureties in like sum.</p>
      <p>She ordered that the sureties must be gainfully employed and have evidence of two years’ tax payment to the Lagos State Government.</p>
      <p>Osunsanmi adjourned the case until February 3, 2020 for substantive hearing.</p>
