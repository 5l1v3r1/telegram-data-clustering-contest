      <p><b>(TRINIDAD EXPRESS) –</b> HOURS before he was to appear in court for his wife’s murder, a San Fernando man is suspected to have committed suicide.</p>
      <p>Chamanlal Gobin was found hanging in a cell of the Mon Repos Police Station on Monday morning.</p>
      <p>Gobin, 53, of Oropouche River Trace North, Barrackpore, was taken to the San Fernando General hospital where he was pronounced dead.</p>
      <p>He had been in custody since Wednesday for the murder of his wife Ramragie Gobin.</p>
      <p>Ramragie Gobin, 49, was stabbed to death at her home at Ridgewood Gardens, Golconda on November 17.</p>
      <p>Police said that the couple had separated and the woman had taken out a protection order against her husband.</p>
      <p>On the day she was killed she sent a text message to her daughter telling her that Gobin was on the premises of her home.</p>
      <p>Ramragie Gobin’s son later found her dead in the house.</p>
      <p>Police launched a manhunt for Gobin, and on Wednesday he was arrested at an abandoned building near his home.</p>
      <p>A senior homicide detective said that on Friday Gobin was charged with his wife’s murder by PC Lall of Homicide Region III.</p>
      <p>Gobin was expected to be taken before a San Fernando magistrate on Monday morning.</p>
      <p>Senior Supt of the Southern Police Division Wayne Mohammed and other senior police officers are investigating.</p>
