      <p><b>Topline</b>: The fate of a Navy SEAL accused and eventually acquitted of war crimes (though demoted of taking a photo with a corpse), has increasingly pitted President Donald Trump against his own military leaders, and ultimately led to the (very complicated) firing Sunday of the Navy Secretary.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The scandal stems from a ruling in which Navy SEAL Edward Gallagher was acquitted in July of murdering a teenage ISIS fighter in Iraq, but was convicted of taking a photo with his corpse and demoted. </li>
        <li>Trump took up the cause of Gallagher—who was been championed by conservative media—and <a href="https://taskandpurpose.com/trump-restores-gallagher-rank">reversed </a>his demotion, restoring his Navy SEAL status, over the objections of Navy leaders.</li>
        <li>Defying Trump, Navy leadership publicly <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/11/20/781340523/despite-trump-support-navy-board-may-strip-eddie-gallagher-of-seal-status">announced </a>last week that an internal peer-review board would decide if Gallagher would be able to keep his Trident pin, which symbolizes his rank as an elite Navy SEAL. </li>
        <li>The tension between the White House and Navy came to a head on Sunday, when Defense Secretary Mark Esper made the dramatic move of firing Navy Secretary Richard Spencer, later accusing him of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2019/11/25/pentagon-chief-says-he-was-flabbergasted-by-navy-secretarys-attempt-make-private-deal-with-trump/?hpid=hp_hp-top-table-main_navy-1205pm%3Ahomepage%2Fstory-ans">going behind his back</a> to secretly negotiate a deal with the White House that would have allowed Gallagher to retain his SEAL status as long as Trump didn’t directly interfere with the Navy’s own review board. </li>
        <li>But in a letter acknowledging his firing, Spencer seemed to suggest otherwise, writing that he no longer shares “the same understanding with the Commander in Chief who appointed me, in regards to the key principle of good order and discipline,” presumably referring to Gallagher keeping his SEAL rank. </li>
        <li>According to <i>Washington Post</i> columnist <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/11/24/firing-richard-spencer-trump-recklessly-crosses-another-line/">David Ignatius</a> Spencer’s deal with the White House was an attempt at a compromise and he was trying to avoid a direct order from Trump about the issue.</li>
        <li>To make matters even more confusing, Trump <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1198746358091530241?s=20">blamed </a>Spencer’s ouster on Gallagher being treated “very badly,” and for not dealing with budgetary cost-overruns from the Obama administration.</li>
        <li>In the end, Spencer’s desire to prevent Trump from intervening with the Navy’s peer-review process didn’t work. Trump ordered Esper over the weekend to allow Gallagher to retain his Navy SEAL rank, the defense secretary said Monday, and the Navy peer-review case into Gallagher was suspended.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Key background</b>: Gallagher’s extraordinary case has consumed the Navy since he was acquitted of murder in July. Members of his own platoon accused Gallagher of fatally stabbing a wounded ISIS fighter and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/23/us/navy-seals-crimes-of-war.html?module=inline">shooting </a>two civilians—a girl wearing a flower-print hijab and an old man—in Iraq in 2017. The allegations were significant coming from other Navy SEALS, who went against unspoken military tradition to testify against one of their own.</p>
      <p>Gallagher’s eventual acquittal came after a stunning moment during the trial, in which a witness who had originally told investigators that Gallagher was responsible for the stabbing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/20/us/na">admitted </a>on the stand to killing the ISIS fighter himself. Prosecutors said he was lying to protect Gallagher, and the admission loomed over the jury’s <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/navy-seal-edward-gallagher-acquitted-murder-isis-fighter-case-n1025226">ruling</a>.</p>
      <p>While he wasn’t convicted of murder, a jury of military service members did find him guilty of taking a photo with a dead ISIS fighter, captioning the picture in text messages: “I've got a cool story for you when I get back. I've got my knife skills on." and "Good story behind this. Got him with my hunting knife." </p>
      <p><b>What’s next</b>: The dispute between the White House and the Navy appears to be over, with Trump having the final word over whether Gallagher gets to keep and retire with his Navy SEAL status. “I can control what I can control. I’m the secretary of Defense and I’m responsible for the department. The president is the commander in chief. He has every right, order and privilege to do what he wants to do,” Esper <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/25/trump-navy-seal-gallagher-073582">said </a>at a press conference.</p>
