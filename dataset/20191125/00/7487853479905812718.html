      <h1>Tottenham Line Up Bournemouth's Nathan Aké to Strengthen Their Struggling Defence</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.90min.com/users/15416614" target="_blank">Ewan Murray</a></address>
      <p>​Tottenham are keeping a very close eye on Bournemouth defender Nathan Aké as they look to bolster their defence in the near future.</p>
      <p>Spurs are planning to overhaul their back line and are aiming to bring in at least one centre-back over the next two transfer windows, but could recruit more if needed. </p>
      <p>As reported by <a href="https://www.footballinsider247.com/sources-tottenham-line-up-transfer-missions-for-player-mourinhos-managed-before/">​Football Insider</a>, the club are particularly keen to bring in highly-rated Dutchman Aké as a left-sided centre-half, who could also play as a left-back.</p>

      <p>The London side are keen to replace 32-year-old Jan Vertonghen who, alongside fellow defender <a href="https://www.90min.com/players/toby-alderweireld">​Toby Alderweireld</a>, is out of contract this summer.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/tottenham">​Spurs</a> have great interest in <a href="https://www.90min.com/players/nathan-ake">​Aké</a> and are set to send scouts to keep an eye on his progress over the coming months, before making a final decision on whether to pursue a transfer. </p>
      <p>Aké has worked with new Spurs boss José Mourinho during his time at <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/chelsea">​Chelsea</a>, and has spoken out about his frustration after being forced to play for the reserves at Stamford Bridge under the 56-year-old.</p>

      <p>However, the defender has shown drastic improvements since his last stint in London, starting all of Bournemouth's league games last season and 13 out of 13 so far this campaign.</p>
      <p>Tottenham are struggling for homegrown players and are looking to change this over the next few transfer windows. While Aké is a Dutch international, he counts as a homegrown player as he joined Chelsea from Feyenoord at only 16 years of age. </p>
      <p>During his first game against West Ham last Saturday, Jose Mourinho named Davinson Sanchez and Alderweireld at centre-back, while <a href="https://www.90min.com/players/eric-dier">​Eric Dier</a> moved in to midfield despite starting the previous two games in defence.</p>

      <p>Spurs are also in the market for full-backs following the shaky early-season form of Danny Rose and Serge Aurier, and Ake's versatility across the back line could be pivotal in a potential move to the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.</p>
