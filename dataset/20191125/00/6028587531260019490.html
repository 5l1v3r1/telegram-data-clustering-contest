      <h1>The Streaming Media Wars: Armageddon Or Clickbait?</h1>

      <p>Many of the latest media headlines paint an alarmist view of the state of the media industry — that a streaming media war is in full swing and getting worse every day. It makes it sound like the battlefield will inevitably be strewn with decimated streaming services, and all will be laid to waste. Is it really as bad as it all sounds?While there are always winners and losers in competitive markets (and <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/media/disney-netflix-streaming-service">the competition in this market is fierce</a>!), there is no obvious reason why <i>all</i> of these services (Netflix, HBO Max, Apple TV+, Amazon Prime, Peacock, Disney+, etc.) can’t coexist profitably long term. Some will execute better than others, and some may completely fail, but they all control or license extensive and valuable content libraries, so this is by no means a “there can be only one” scenario.</p>
      <p>What also seems to be missing from the conversation is the fact that, despite the growing number of streaming content silos to manage and pay for, there has never been more great content available to consumers at reasonable prices. This can largely be attributed to advancements in technology, particularly those related to streaming bandwidth and high-powered data operations. It's partly due to these advancements in technology that the user experience is also better than ever before.</p>
      <p>Here’s why the so-called streaming media wars are really a win for consumers:</p>
      <p>
        <b>More Content Than Ever Before</b>
      </p>
      <p>Over-the-top (OTT) streaming and all those binge-watching sessions are only possible because of advancements in the transcoding, delivery and playback of content. It’s because of this that it’s far easier to find something to watch today than it was even five years ago, with AVOD, SVOD, and TVOD services now making what seems like infinitely more movies and shows available on demand.</p>
      <p>Despite service providers playing some games with the bundling of cable and internet services, consumers are generally no longer forced to pay sky-high cable prices for preset programming schedules. Ultimately, people can now choose the types of services that are right for them and prioritize the content they care about based on their budget.</p>
      <p>What can you get for the same monthly amount now? Just do the math:</p>
      <p>• Netflix: $14.99/month</p>
      <p>• HBO: $14.99/month</p>
      <p>• Disney+ with Hulu and ESPN+: $12.99/month</p>
      <p>• CBS All Access: $5.99/month</p>
      <p>That adds up to $48.96 — a far cry from the $107 for traditional cable, leaving plenty of room to add other specialty services like sports, anime or movie genres. For those who still want local TV, there are plenty of options, such as YouTube TV, which at $49.99 still costs less than basic cable, even with all the previously mentioned streaming services.</p>
      <p>
        <b>More Ad-</b>
        <b>Free And Ad-Supported Options </b>
      </p>
      <p>The concept of paying a premium for access to commercial-free movies or original programming is not new — it’s something many of us are accustomed to through premium cable channels like HBO or Showtime. All these new subscriptions can be likened to adding more ad-free channels to our basic monthly cable package. But you don’t really need basic cable anymore because you can get most of that content cheaper with apps like Hulu or YouTube TV, or just plug in a digital antenna for <a href="https://www.cordcuttersnews.com/there-are-now-over-100-free-ota-tv-networks-targeting-cord-cutters/">free-over-the-air television</a>.</p>
      <p>There is also more brilliant original ad-free programming than ever before, as each content house works to produce quality entertainment, giving us all something to get excited about, and fodder for those water cooler/general Slack room conversations.</p>
      <p>This is great for consumers, but ad-supported content is a win for content providers and advertisers as well, enabling them to better target consumers with relevant ads provided by measurable access to demographic criteria. Companies <a href="https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/336148/roku-launches-activation-insights-ott-ad-product.html">like Roku offer a suite of OTT advertising tools</a>, which “conducts a review of the marketer’s linear TV campaign performance, as well as an analysis of the streaming audience the campaign may have missed.” Using this data, the service then “suggests where to spend the budget on Roku’s platform to make up that gap, advancing an advertiser’s ability to target the right audience.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>The Experience </b>
        <b>Is Getting Better, Too</b>
      </p>
      <p>Even hardware makers are playing a role in improving the consumer entertainment experience, with companies like Roku, NVIDIA, Apple, Amazon and more working to bring consumers an elegant new media experience through living room devices that make accessing each service easier. NVIDIA <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/28/20935782/nvidia-shield-tv-pro-announced-features-pricing-dolby-vision">recently announced</a> advancements to its Shield line of Android TV devices that includes AI upscaling. This new technology is “designed to improve the detail and <a href="https://www.cnet.com/how-to/turn-down-your-tv-sharpness-control/">sharpness</a> of standard HD video and make it look more like 4K” and improve the viewing experience.</p>
      <p>While other advancements like data aggregation or transcoding and delivery are behind the scenes, it’s this type of technology innovation that continues to make the overall streaming experience shine in the living room.</p>
      <p>
        <b>No Matter What, Consumers Come Out On Top </b>
      </p>
      <p>The main takeaway is that the so-called streaming media wars, fueled by amazing advancements in technology, are only making things better for consumers, who can now get infinitely more content than preprogrammed cable channels — and get it on their own terms.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Can It Be Even Better? </b>
      </p>
      <p>While all of this momentum is mostly positive, it does not mean there are no problems to solve. Discovery challenges and subscription fatigue are real and will be exacerbated by the lack of universal search, cross-device watch status and targeted recommendations. Currently, consumers have to know what they are looking for or be willing to search through a seemingly endless number of libraries of content to find what interests them.</p>
      <p>Some devices help with this better than others, but nobody does it well. Pulling the experience all together by creating effective discovery and recommendation solutions across content and device silos is the missing technological advancement in the streaming media puzzle, and it’s a problem tech companies can solve. The only real unsolvable problem in the industry is how we will all find the time to watch everything we want.</p>
