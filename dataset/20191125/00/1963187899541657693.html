      <p>CAIRO - 25: November 2019: The Egyptian petroleum exports recorded $2.42 billion during the first quarter of 2019/2020, compared to $2.87 billion during the same period of 2018/2019, according to the Ministry of Petroleum. <br/><br/>The ministry attributed the decline in the value of the sector's exports from July to Sept. (2019-2020) to the global decline in prices, despite the 2.1-percent increase in quantities exported. <br/><br/>It pointed out that the value of imports of crude and petroleum products during this period amounted to about $2.7 billion, marking a decrease of about 13 percent, despite the 0.4 increase in imported quantities after the decline in the world price. <br/><br/>Egypt's non-petroleum exports hiked 3 percent during the first nine months of 2019, recording $19.201 billion compared to about $18.708 billion in the same period of 2018</p>
