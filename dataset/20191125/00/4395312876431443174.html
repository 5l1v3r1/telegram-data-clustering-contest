        <b>#2 Hold a regular meeting (either weekly or monthly)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Open communication must be present in the workplace. A weekly or monthly meeting can be helpful to hear the employee’s concerns and issues. Not only that, but employers can also be informed of the achievements and developments of their employees.

On the other hand, you need to also<a href="https://www.anthrodesk.ca/blog/how-can-active-listening-benefit-you-as-an-employee"> listen well</a> to the person talking so you can both understand the message. Questions and clarifications must also be welcome, so complete understanding is promoted.</p>

      <p>Every member of the organization must work together to achieve goals for the business. It will be helpful if they recognize the strengths and weaknesses of their team members. This will help to know each other’s potentials and give assistance to those who need it.</p>
      <p>
        <b>#7 Keep team members informed about the project’s update.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Inform your team members about the updates of your company’s project and plans. They will appreciate it if the management will keep them in the loop. A heads up can help in determining if there are changes needed or adjustments required. Information and updates can be given in the forms of memo, meetings, letters, emails, and meetups.</p>

        <b>#9 Utilize modern technology to support – not to hamper – the communication.</b>

      <p>Today’s modern world brings us breakthroughs and tools that aid us in bringing convenience and efficiency when it comes to communicating. Computers and mobile phones, for instance, are most often used nowadays. However, we should all be responsible for using them. They are tools to make our lives easier, not serve as distractions and cause miscommunications.</p>

Without proper delegation, it will be difficult for them to execute the needed actions. Open communication will help implement an efficient monitoring process for every project in the company.</p>
      <p>
        <b>#11 Prove that you are trustworthy of what you say.</b>
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>During meetings and brainstorming, managers must listen to all suggestions and evaluate them. It is crucial to discuss the reasons why suggestions are acceptable, and some are not. Sincerity is paramount when doing this process because it will bring a lot of benefits to the workplace.</p>
      <p>
        <b>#14 Make every process clear and fix any roadblocks that may hamper it.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The more projects the company has, the more complicated the tasks can be. Lapse of communication can occur and may hinder the succeeding processes. Make sure that all procedures are well-structured and evaluated if each process is streamlined.</p>
      <p>
        <b>#15 Provide compliments to boost employee’s morale.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Telling employees that they did a great job can serve as a helpful feedback. It will make them feel more confident and that they are being acknowledged in their efforts. For bigger success, rewards and incentives can also be given. Ensure that compliments and rewards are properly informed to the members of the organization on how they are acquired. These can also serve as motivators to all employees.</p>
