      <h1>Minimum Wage: Oshiomhole Tells APC Governors What To Do</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">George Ogbolu</a></address>
      <p>The National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/23/dino-melaye-will-lose-like-saraki-shehu-sani-others-oshiomhole/"><u><b>Adams Oshiomhole</b></u></a>, has begged APC governors to implement the N30,000 minimum wage and the consequential adjustments.</p>
      <p>The former Edo State Governor made this known on Monday at the Federal Government-Progressives Governors Forum parley in Jos.</p>
      <p>Oshiomhole urged <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/25/top-apc-member-begins-move-to-allow-buhari-contest-3rd-term/"><u><b>APC governors</b></u></a> to kickstart payment before governors elected on the platform of other parties.</p>
      <p>According to him, <i>“As progressives, let us be the first to pay the new national minimum wage and not just the wage but also the consequential adjustments arising from it.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“Already, there are some proactive progressive governors that have taken steps to address this.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“I plead that you give this a priority because when other governors are fighting whether or not to pay, you will say that progressive governors have paid.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“Where there is will, there will certainly be a way.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>Oshiomhole also urged APC governors to back President Muhammadu Buhari’s decision to shut down the country borders.</p>
      <p>He said that the nation’s borders should remain closed until neighbouring countries follow the protocols of fair trade.</p>
