      <p>The Suva City Council intends to get foreign independent engineers to assess the MHCC Tower and give a confirmation whether the construction can continue or not.</p>
      <p>This has been confirmed by the Minister for Local Government, Premila Kumar.</p>
      <p>Kumar says structural reinforcement was required on the MHCC Tower and MHCC was working with engineers from abroad on this. She they will also be submitting engineering plans.</p>
      <p>She says the engineering plan is in relation to strengthening the structures of MHCC Tower.</p>
      <p>Kumar adds that Carpenters had done this structural reinforcement and have left it for a while for the building to settle.</p>
      <p>She says the independent engineers will then come and confirm whether the construction can continue.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Carpenters Pte Limited had earlier confirmed to Legend FM News that the foundation of the MHCC Tower that is still under construction was stabilised in January this year.</p>
      <p>Carpenters Pte Limited confirms that all engineers and consultants engaged by them are independent professionals, namely Batchelar McDougall Consulting and Holmes Consulting from New Zealand.</p>
      <p>Carpenters had earlier highlighted that the MHCC Tower is structurally safe although works had stopped and some columns were sinking at the time.</p>
