      <p>In a time when Black/African American boys are witnessing repeated violence and police brutality against men of color, we must consider the impact this social reality has on their psychological health and <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/self-esteem">self-worth</a>. In recent years, there have been steady increases in the rates of depressive and <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/anxiety">anxiety</a> symptoms, as well as post-<a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/trauma">traumatic</a> <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/stress">stress</a> (<a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/post-traumatic-stress-disorder">PTSD</a>) among children living in predominantly urban and racial/ethnic minority communities. These psychological struggles heighten the likelihood of poor school performance and misbehavior, leading to increased and disproportionately harsh disciplinary actions by educators and school resource officers.</p>
      <p>While many in the Black community, along with civil rights activists, protest discriminatory policies that unduly impact Black boys and men, we must continue to identify and promote effective measures, such as mentoring, to ensure their protection. Mentoring involves the provision of support and role modeling, generally to a younger or inexperienced person, by a non-parental individual. It is a proven, effective practice for guiding young people through difficult challenges (Baker &amp; McGuire, 2005; Dubois &amp; Rhodes, 2006). Among youth, mentoring reduces emotional distress and problematic behaviors, while fostering improved academic performance (Hurd, Zimmerman, &amp; Xue, 2008). Furthermore, Hurd et al., points out that appraisal support or “esteem-support” from a mentor enhances a young person’s <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/identity">self-image</a> and self-worth. Additionally, mentoring improves their ability to make healthier and safer choices in life (Herrera, Grossman, Kauh, Feldman &amp; McMaken, 2007).</p>
      <p>All healthy relationships are built on trust, which is true for the mentor-mentee relationship as well. Although being mentored by Black men may be uniquely beneficial, parents should not place too much emphasis on discriminating based on race, <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/gender">gender</a>, or religious affiliation when it comes to mentoring. What is of particular importance is the trust and rapport that may develop between the mentor and the mentee. When we mentor or allow our children to be mentored, we are communicating to them that not only do we as their parents and guardians care about their lives, but others as well are invested in their future. Those are powerfully affirming messages to boys who are frequently under assault in the American society.</p>
      <p>For our <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/resilience">resilient</a> Black boys, dedicated mentors are like superheroes — they inspire, and they protect. They inspire them to reach for the stars because the stars belong to them and they protect their souls from being damaged by America’s continued racial marginalization.</p>
