      <h1>Melbourne set to capitalise on Sydney's stadium shortage for 2020 Bledisloe Cup</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:07:31+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 00:07</time> by <a rel="author">Online Editors</a></address>
      <p>For the first time in the Bledisloe Cup’s 117-year history, the Wallabies will not host a match in Sydney despite having hosting rights to two of the three matches for the 2020 series.</p>
      <p>Rugby <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/australia">Australia</a> has announced on Monday that Melbourne’s Marvel Stadium will host the first of the three-match series on August 8 next year, finalising the Australian part of the schedule which will also see the third test played in Brisbane.</p>
      <p>It will be the first time in a decade that a Bledisloe Cup fixture will be staged at the Victorian capital, with the last meeting between the two sides in Melbourne coming in 2010, when the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/new-zealand">All Blacks</a> ran out 49-28 victors.</p>

      <p>RA’s decision to take the series outside of New South <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/wales">Wales</a> comes as a result of both ANZ Stadium and Allianz Stadium being unavailable throughout next year due to the Sydney stadium network’s AU$2 billion redevelopment by the time the Bledisloe opener rolls around.</p>
      <p>The move to take the match to Melbourne also plays into RA’s Visit Victoria partnership, which will culminate with the British and Irish <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/lions">Lions</a> tour of Australia in 2025.</p>
      <p>Additionally, the event will act as a trans-Tasman double-header, as the Black Ferns will take on the Wallaroos prior to the Bledisloe Cup clash in what will be the first Australian women’s test match to be held in Melbourne.</p>

      <p>“Our Wallaby and Wallaroo double-header events in Australia have been extremely popular with fans in Sydney in Perth and we are looking forward to staging the first ever double-header in front of packed Marvel Stadium in Melbourne,” RA chief executive Raelene Castle said.</p>
      <p>“In 2019 we saw how much these events have captured the imagination of fans in both countries, with a sold-out sign at Optus Stadium in the west and again at Eden Park in <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/mitre-10-cup/teams/auckland">Auckland</a> a week later, and we expect there to be a lot of excitement in Melbourne to watch two fantastic test matches.”</p>
      <p>Confirmation of the Melbourne test adds to the Wallabies’ growing international calendar for next year, which kick-off at Suncorp Stadium in Brisbane in July when <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/ireland">Ireland</a> travel to Australia for a two-match series.</p>
      <p>It will act as Dave Rennie’s first match as head coach of the Wallabies, before the two teams to battle again a week later at the Sydney Cricket Ground.</p>
      <p>The full Rugby Championship draw is yet to be confirmed, but two end-of-year tests have already been confirmed for the Wallabies, who are set to take on Ireland in a third test and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/england">England</a> at Twickenham on November 28.</p>
