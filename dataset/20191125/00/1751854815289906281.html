      <p>Gone are the days when music lovers had to rely solely on wired headphones to listen to their favorite soundtracks. The latest technology has enabled us not only to enjoy music on the go but also made several useful features available for a superior listening experience.</p>
      <figure>

      <p>On the downside, a top-branded music accessory such as an earphone isn’t necessarily easy on the pocketbook. In other words, getting access to an enhanced listening experience is likely to burn a big hole in your pocket.</p>
      <p>As a result, those living on a tight budget end up buying inexpensive alternatives that aren’t crafted to offer an immersive audio experience. it’s a catch-22 situation, which Origem is bent on changing.</p>
      <p>Those familiar with music accessories available in the market today are well-versed with Origem, which is a professional earphone brand. As a result of their intense R&amp;D (research and development), Origem has developed its own unique algorithm, which is carefully integrated into the company’s pursuit of delivering unparalleled sound quality.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, Origem officially launched the HS-3, which is the world’s first Bluetooth with HDR function earphones. The feature-rich device adopts a newfangled voice control system for truly hands-free communication. The HS-3 simplifies and expedites tasks such as answering calls when driving, running or even working out in the gym.</p>
      <p>To access various other aspects in addition to answering or rejecting incoming calls, all you need to do is to say “Hello, voice Q!” to HS-3. It gives you freedom from the hassle of dealing with a clunky remote control interface and allows you to perform multiple tasks without having to take your phone out of the pocket.</p>
      <p>In addition to garnering widespread applause from renowned media such as CNET, Android Police, and BGR, the HS-3 became an instant hit among a lot of consumers. To show its gratitude to customers, Origem has lanched two crazy discounts, which are simply unmissable, especially with Christmas just around the corner.</p>
      <p>Dubbed as the Black Friday Madness Spree, the promotion has been split into two sections.</p>
      <h4>Origem HS-3 Wireless Earbuds Price Drop</h4>

      </figure>
      <p>As part of the first discount, music lovers will be able to get their hands on the HS-3 wireless earbuds for a considerably lowered price of $59. This is a significant reduction in the earphone’s original asking price of $99.  You can choose between three highly appealing color options including Red, Gunmetal and Silver.</p>
      <h4>Origem HS-3 Buy One Get One For $1</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.gizmochina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_4958-1068x641.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>To take advantage of this offer, simply add two pieces of the HS-3 to your shopping cart. The discount will be applied automatically. While you’d pay the regular $99 for one piece, the other piece would set you back just $1.</p>
      <p>This offer is valid for all three color options including Red, Gunmetal and silver. Now, that’s an absolute steal!</p>
      <p>To make the most out of these discounts, you need to ensure you visit the <a href="https://origem.com/pages/black-friday-deal">Origem official website</a> during the activity period, which starts from November 25th and is slated to end on December 1st, 2019. Are you ready?</p>
