      <h1>Elon Musk Just Made a Cameo on “Rick and Morty”</h1>

      <h3>Elon Tusk</h3>
      <p>In February, Tesla CEO Elon Musk <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesla-musk-idUSKCN1QG252">changed his Twitter handle</a> to “Elon Tusk” — a move that <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/elon-tusk-tesla-ceo-changes-twitter-handle-says-there-will-be-news-on-thursday-2019-02-27">arguably shifted Tesla’s stock price</a>.</p>
      <p>And we finally know why.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, Cartoon Network aired the latest episode of its <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/rick-morty-season-4-elon-tusk-elon-musk-cameo-explained-twitter-1473860">animated science-fiction series “Rick and Morty”</a> — and during it, the titular characters enlist the help of Elon Tusk, an alternate reality version of Musk with walrus-like tusks.</p>

      <h3>On the DL</h3>
      <p>In retrospect, Musk wasn’t the only one dropping early hints about the “Rick and Morty” cameo. In May, the show’s co-creators, Dan Harmon and Justin Roiland, almost let Musk’s upcoming appearance slip during an <a href="https://youtu.be/5sNWXJnKYxc">interview</a> with entertainment news site Hollywood Life.</p>
      <p>“I was hanging out with Elon… and Dan knows where I was,” Roiland said —  but then quickly cut Harmon off when he began to say the two “were recording.”</p>
      <h3>Humor Function Activated</h3>
      <p>If there’s anything to take away about about the “real” Musk from his cameo on “Rick and Morty,” it’s that he’s not afraid to be the butt of a joke.</p>
      <p>When Tusk asks why Rick and Morty are coming to him for help — and not the Musk living in the same dimension as the duo at the center of the show — Rick notes that “this is a team operation, and regular Elon can be a little bit controlling.”</p>
      <p>That part, uh, let’s just say that it <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/19/tesla-ceo-elon-musk-extreme-micro-manager.html">checks out</a>.</p>
