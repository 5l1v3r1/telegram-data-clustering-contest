        <b>The form of Harry Kane means there is "no chance" Tottenham will swoop for Zlatan Ibrahimovic, according to Jose Mourinho.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Jose Mourinho has ruled out a move for Zlatan Ibrahimovic</b> because he has the "<b>best striker in England</b>" at his disposal in <b>Harry Kane</b>.</p>
      <p>Ibrahimovic has been linked with a move to the north London club after Mourinho was swiftly announced as Mauricio Pochettino's replacement last week.</p>
      <p>T<b>he pair briefly worked together at Inter </b>during the 2008-09 season before linking up again at <b>Manchester United</b> in 2016.</p>
      <p>Speaking ahead of his first Champions League game in charge of Spurs against Olympiacos on Tuesday, Mourinho poured cold water on suggestions he could swoop for the 38-year-old free agent.</p>

      <p>"<b>I have more than a connection [with Ibrahimovic]</b>," he said. "He's an amazing player, amazing guy, but I would say no chance. <b>We have the best striker in England</b>. We have one of the top two or three strikers in the world. A striker of Zlatan's dimension...obviously in his late 30s but still a striker that can play at any club in the world. [But] it doesn't make sense to sign him when we have Harry Kane."</p>
      <p><b>Tottenham confirmed Ben Davies is unavailable for Tuesday's game </b>after sustaining an ankle injury against West Ham at the weekend, but Tanguy Ndombele and Jan Vertonghen both took part in training on Monday.</p>
      <p><b>Spurs are five points behind Group B leaders Bayern Munich</b> but will qualify for the last 16 if they overcome their Greek opponents at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.</p>
