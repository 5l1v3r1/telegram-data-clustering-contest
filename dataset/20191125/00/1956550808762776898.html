      <h1>La Tablita</h1>
      <h2>Longstanding spot with a new vegan menu</h2>

      <h4>Time Out Says</h4>
      <p>Since it opened in October last year, there haven’t been too many headlines about the new Hyatt Regency hotel down by Creek Park. Perhaps it suffers due to its location – we all know people who live in New Dubai who won’t travel that far for a meal, or just to see the Creek, the heart and soul of the city.<br/><br/>Those who are happy to make the trip, or live there, of course, are aware that those Marina and JBR dwellers are missing out on a whole host of great things. And that list just got longer.<br/><br/>La Tablita, the fun and funky Mexican restaurant at the back of the lobby, isn’t very busy, but it certainly deserves to be.<br/><br/>Staff are happy to see customers, make you feel very welcome and recommend dishes for you, but believe us when we say to try the tacos. As many as you can possibly stomach.<br/><br/>At just Dhs12 each, we take four – the tinga de pollo (chipotle pulled chicken), pescadillas (crispy fish), rajas poblanas (creamy chilli stew with corn) and texano (hard shell, beef, sour cream).<br/><br/>Of those, the deep-fried fish is our top pick, with the chicken coming a close second. The guacamole is fresh and has good texture, but the beef chorizo would benefit from being in bigger chunks.<br/><br/>The gringa al pastor quesedillas ooze cheese, but we’re in too similar ground with the tacos to really enjoy these as much.<br/><br/>Our other choice, the robalo (pictured) is a better way to continue the meal. The meaty sea bass is laid on a bed of rice studded with corn and peppers and topped with salsa (and edible flowers to make it look pretty, of course).<br/><br/>It is a dish to sum up the restaurant – attractive, playful and packing a punch.<br/><br/><b>The Bill (for two)<br/>1x tinga de pollo taco</b> Dhs12<br/><b>1x texano taco</b> Dhs12<br/><b>1x pescadillas taco</b> Dhs12<br/><b>1x rajas poblanas taco</b> Dhs12<br/><b>1x guacamole chorizo</b> Dhs60<br/><b>1x robalo</b> Dhs89<br/><b>1x gringa al pastor</b> Dhs49<br/><b>1x chamoyada</b> Dhs25<br/><b>1x large water</b> Dhs28<br/><b>Total (excluding service)</b> Dhs299<br/><br/><b>The bottom line</b><br/>Dubai’s Mexican food scene just got a new contender.</p>

      <h3>THE VEGETARIAN VIEW</h3>
      <p>More pften than not, when we’re told a dish is spicy, we assume the place is playing it up, in case you’re the kind of person who has a coughing fit over a sprinkle of pepper. But when one of the servers at La Tablita warns you, you better listen.</p>
      <p>We head here mid-week to check out the relatively new <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/vegandubai">vegan</a> menu, but we’re disappointed to find the brightly coloured spot is nearly empty.<br/><br/>The wait staff seem excited to have diners and their enthusiasm make us want to like the food – they’re knowledgeable and happy to give recommendations or explain what a nopale is (FYI, it’s part of a cactus).<br/><br/>We place our trust in our server and get the huitlacoche (Mexican black corn mushroom) and frijol con aguacate (refried beans and avocado) tacos, but they’re hit and miss. The huitlacoche needs more sauce, but the frijol con aguacate is overflowing with avocado and we can’t taste the refried beans.<br/><br/>The enchilidas morita is eye-wateringly spicy in the best way possible, and definitely the stand-out dish, but the Mexican-style rice it comes with is average.<br/><br/>The restaurant itself has a modern vibe, with chalkboard drawings, exposed lightbulbs and geometric wall sculptures, but it’s nothing to shout home about.<br/><br/>La Tablita is a great spot to head to if you’re not familiar with <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/restaurant-awards-2019/397980-dubais-best-latin-american-restaurants-2019">Mexican food</a>, thanks to the fantastic servers, but dishes don’t quite hit the mark and it’s not enough to draw us back in.<br/><br/><b>WHAT IS IT...</b><br/>Longstanding spot with a new vegan menu<br/><br/><b>WHY GO...</b><br/>If you want plant-based Mexican food at Dubai Creek<br/><br/><b>VEGETARIAN-FRIENDLY</b><br/>5/5</p>
