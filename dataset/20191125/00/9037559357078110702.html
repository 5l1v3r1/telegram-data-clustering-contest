      <p>The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) on Monday filed a supplementary reference in the fake accounts case against former president Asif Ali Zardari and MPA Faryal Talpur.</p>
      <p>In its reference, the anti-corruption watchdog alleged that the funds of a private bank were wrongly used and land was purchased under the name of a <i>benamidar </i>(ostensible owner).</p>
      <p>The bureau said that the accused named Mushtaq has a joint account with the former president, adding that according to the bank record, the account was used for the PPP co-chairperson. Funds were also transferred abroad through the same account, the reference alleges.</p>
      <p>According to the reference, Rs8.3 billion were withdrawn from the fake accounts and Rs1.2bn were taken out illegally from a private bank’s account. It also says that Rs950 million were then transferred back to Zardari's account for his use.</p>
      <p>The reference also alleges that Anwar Majeed, Abdul Ghani and Mustafa Zulqarnain played a crucial role in the case.</p>
