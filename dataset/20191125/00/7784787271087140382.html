      <h3>Things looked good, or bad — it depends how you look at it — for the Cincinnati Bengals on Monday (AEDT).</h3>
      <p>Cincinnati was locked in an AFC North slugfest with the Pittsburgh Steelers, with their first win of the season within reach.</p>

      <p>That Bengals defence was proving so effective Mike Tomlin was forced to bench Mason Rudolph. But his replacement, Devlin Hodges, threw the game-defining 79-yard touchdown pass, and like all the times before this one, Cincinnati was ultimately outclassed.</p>
      <p>Now 0-11, Zac Taylor’s team have succeeded in one thing: building what might be an insurmountable lead for the No. 1 pick in the 2020 NFL Draft.</p>
      <p>Of course, we know leads are anything but safe when the Bengals are involved, but in this context, you probably fancy their chances.</p>
      <p>The New York Giants, Miami Dolphins, and Washington Redskins are all in the mix, but will need to find a new level of ‘bad’ to somehow end up with the worst record.</p>
      <p>Here’s how it currently looks for those hunting a top pick in next year’s draft; whether that be for a quarterback like Joe Burrow, or a gun defensive star in Chase Young.</p>
