      <p>There have been a few headlines suggesting that a China-U.S. trade deal for Phase One is just about done. The key sticking point right now seems to be that tariffs should be lifted before the deal is signed. One would have to think that some type of deal will get done, even if it means the U.S. (President Trump in particular) giving up a lot for it to get done. But haven’t we seen this before? Phase One was supposed to be a “done deal” when it was announced, yet here we are a month later still trying to figure it out.</p>
      <p>Stocks appear to be eating up the headlines, with the <a href="https://www.investing.com/indices/us-spx-500">S&amp;P 500</a> gapping higher. The equity futures index is currently trading only a few handles from all-time highs.</p>

      <p>But what happens when (and if) a deal does get signed? Is a Phase One deal already priced into the market? If so, will stocks sell off on a “buy-the-rumor-sell-the-fact”? Only time will tell, but its something traders must consider. Bears may be looking to pounce on stocks if a deal is signed.</p>

      <p>So far, <a href="https://www.investing.com/currencies/usd-jpy">USD/JPY</a> been more skeptical of a trade deal being a “done deal.” USD/JPY has been in an inverted head-and-shoulders pattern since late May. Price has tested the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level from the highs on April 24 to the lows on August 26 near 109.50 but has yet to close above it. A break above this level could send price toward the gap near 111.00. If the Golden Fib (61.8%) holds, the pair could easily be back at 108.00 in hurry.</p>

      <p>As this is Thanksgiving week in the United States, trading is likely to be slow, especially from Wednesday afternoon onward. Any U.S.-China headlines could move the markets quickly, as there will be less participants in the market as the week progresses. Be aware of headlines and know in advance what could happen if an announcement is released that U.S.-China Phase One trade deal is signed.</p>
