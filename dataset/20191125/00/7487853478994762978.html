      <h1>Pep Guardiola Comments on Speculation Linking Mikel Arteta With Arsenal Manager's Job</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.90min.com/users/380768" target="_blank">Will Lott</a></address>
      <p>​Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has put to bed links of his current assistant manager Mikel Arteta returning to Arsenal as manager. </p>
      <p>Disappointing results for the Gunners have led to increased speculation regarding the future of Unai Emery, with the club sat eighth in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>Arteta, a former Arsenal captain, has been linked with the job in the past, and was the favourite to replace Arsene Wenger when he left in 2018 before the job was given to Emery.</p>

      <p>With Emery struggling to get results and fans losing faith in his abilities, Arteta's being linked with the role again.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/arsenal-set-sights-on-mikel-arteta-with-unai-emery-on-brink-cgc60vgsj">The Times</a>, who report that Arteta is in Arsenal's sights again, quote Guardiola over his thoughts on Arteta stepping into management.</p>
      <p>“Unai Emery is the manager of <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/arsenal">​Arsenal</a>. Of course [Arteta] will be a manager sooner or later," he said. "We are going to finish the season but in the future I don’t know what is going to happen.”</p>
      <p>“I would like him to stay with us. <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/manchester-city">​Manchester City</a> has a person of incredible value to work here in the future. But professional desires are professional desires. Everyone is more than satisfied to have him here.”</p>

      <p>“He was an incredible player. The holding midfielder has a vision of what happens on the pitch. When you are a striker you think of the goals and keepers to save it. But I think that the holding midfielder is an incredible lesson during your period as a footballer player. </p>
      <p>"You don’t need to go to school. More than that he is an incredible human being and works a lot. I said after a few months together he would be a manger. He is already a manager – he behaves like a manager.”</p>
      <p>The prospect of managing a club the size of Arsenal may be too good an opportunity for Arteta to turn down, though reports in the past have suggested City are priming him to be their new manager when Guardiola leaves.</p>
