      <p>The battle for this week's Number 1 on the UK's Official Albums Chart is set to be a fierce one, with Robbie Williams and Coldplay going head-to-head for the top spot. </p>
      <p>Last week, Robbie said he would be "crushed" if his new album The Christmas Present was beaten by Coldplay's Everyday Life.  </p>
      <p>"If that happens, I will be really happy," Robbie told The Sun of reaching Number 1. "And if not, I will be crushed. I don’t mind saying I want nice things to happen to me."</p>
      <p>Coldplay's Chris Martin has responded to the comments, insisting the band "don't mind" if they lose out on the Number 1 spot to Robbie. </p>
      <p>"Robbie Williams, I don’t mind… we don’t mind," he told NME. "Honestly, we’re cool with that. He can have it, all power to Robbie. Really he was around first, too."</p>
      <p>Robbie currently has <a href="https://www.officialcharts.com/artist/1849/robbie-williams/">12 Number 1 albums in the UK</a>, and topping the Official Albums Chart this week would put him equal with Elvis Presley, who has the most chart-toppers for a solo act. </p>
      <p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.officialcharts.com/artist/7620/coldplay/">all seven of Coldplay's studio albums</a> have reached Number 1 on the Official Chart; their last was 2015's A Head Full Of Dreams. </p>
