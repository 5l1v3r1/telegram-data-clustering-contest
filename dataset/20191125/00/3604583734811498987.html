      <h1>Road work blitz begins as part of $425 million state government program</h1>

      <p>DRIVERS may notice some hold ups on their ride for the next few weeks with 370km of roads across the western region of the state being resurfaced.</p>
      <p>Roads Minister Jaala Pulford visited Victoria Street in Ballarat East this morning, which is the first of 12 sites across the state which is having work completed during the next three weeks.</p>
      <p>Other roads set to be worked on include <a href="https://www.thecourier.com.au/story/6481946/three-more-weeks-of-stoppages-and-then-hopefully-were-ready-to-roll/?fbclid=IwAR0j4XoFx922p8EBYePPEXAyfr4eFwxFuwqVs2Oku9t-Y81VH7pTclgdZbo">Gillies Street in Wendouree, which will be closed from December 7-9 for both resurfacing and the rolling out of a new train line </a>near Wendouree Station between Howitt and Gregory streets.</p>
      <p>Across the western region, roads including Barkly Street and Ararat-Halls Gap Road in Ararat, Stawell-Avoca Road, Dunach-Eddington Road, Ballarat-Maryborough Road and Tuaggra Street, Maryborough are also on the list.</p>
      <p>It is part of a $425 million state government blitz which has already seen 115km completed.</p>
      <p>Ms Pulford said the work is being completed during a dry time of year to minimise the impact on people.</p>
      <p>"There might be some five or so minute delays here and there, but mostly we expect that people will be able to go about their business</p>
      <p>While some rural roads, such as Daylesford-Ballarat Road and Bungaree-Wallace Road will have resurfacing completed as part of the works, Ms Pulford said the responsibility of the state government was to look after arterial roads.</p>
      <p>"Rural roads are part of this program, but we also have a $100 million program to assist councils to look after their roads," she said. "These arterial roads are getting the benefit of this $425 million investment."</p>
