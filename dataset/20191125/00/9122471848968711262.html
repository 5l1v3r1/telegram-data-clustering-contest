      <h1>ESPN’s Prediction For Tonight’s 49ers-Packers Game</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:14:16+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 00:14</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matthladik" target="_blank">Matt Hladik</a></address>
      <p>Today has been a rather lackluster Sunday of NFL football, but we’ve got a chance at a strong conclusion. Tonight’s Sunday Night Football matchup is a bonafide showdown.</p>
      <p>The 8-2 Green Bay Packers travel to Santa Clara to take on the 9-1 San Francisco 49ers in a battle of two teams in the running for the top seed in the NFC. The Packers have won five of their last six games, while the 49ers didn’t lose their first game of the season until two weeks ago.</p>
      <p>Both teams have outstanding defenses and running games, while Aaron Rodgers gives the Packers an edge at quarterback. On paper, this game should be highly-competitive.</p>
      <p>ESPN has <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401128004">unveiled its prediction</a> for 49ers-Packers. The computer likes the home team.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>San Francisco has a 60.8 percent chance of winning, according to the FPI. Green Bay’s chances sit at 38.9 percent, with a small (0.3 percent) chance of a tie game.</b>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Tonight’s game will kick off at 8:20 p.m. ET on NBC.</p>
      <p>If San Francisco wins, they will have the best record in the NFC at 10-1. But if the Packers get the W, there will be a four-way tie at the top of the NFC between Green Bay, the 49ers, the Seahawks and Saints.</p>
