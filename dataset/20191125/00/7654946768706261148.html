      <h1>Richard Jefferson: I chose retirement over playing for Knicks</h1>

      <p>Richard Jefferson dunked on the Knicks from the broadcast booth Sunday when the former small forward said he chose retirement over playing for the woebegone franchise.</p>
      <p>“They were the one team that offered me a job, and I decided to retire,” Jefferson said on-air during the Nets-Knicks game. ” I just knew it was time. When the Knicks were looking for me to play for them, I knew my time in the league was over.”</p>
      <p>Jefferson played 17 seasons in the league, including his first seven with the Nets, before retiring at 38 years old in 2018.</p>
      <p>He won a championship with the Cavaliers in 2017 as a pivotal bench player, and currently works for ESPN and the YES Network as an NBA pundit.</p>
      <p>The Knicks, meanwhile, are no stranger to missing out on free agents after watching Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant sign with the Nets this summer.</p>
