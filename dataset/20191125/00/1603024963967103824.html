      <p>The Sajjan Jindal-led JSW Group has invested Rs 750 crore to build an iron ore terminal at the Paradip port in Odisha.</p>
      <p>The 370-metre long terminal, with a capacity to handle 18 million tonne per annum, has already been commissioned by its arm JSW Infrastructure, the group said on Monday.</p>
      <p>It is built to handle cape-size vessels for iron ore and pellet exports and can load at a rate of 100,000 tonne per day, it said, adding the maiden shipment of the Brahmani River pellets on 'MV IC Pheonix' has set sail already.</p>
      <p>"With the commissioning of this terminal, the country can now offer cape-size shipments. The capacities are far better than not only any other domestic port but also many ports internationally," joint managing director Arun Maheshwari said.</p>
      <p>The Paradip Port Trust had awarded JSW Infra the right to develop a fully mechanised iron ore export terminal on a BOT basis for 30 years, and this commissioning has taken its cargo capacity to over 100 mtpa.</p>
      <p>The terminal comprises two ship-loaders, each with a capacity of 7,000 tonne per hour. It also has 800,000 tonne cargo storage yard with rotary and tandem wagon tipplers to enable fast rake unloading, the statement said.</p>
