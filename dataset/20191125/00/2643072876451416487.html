      <h1>Dino Melaye Speaks On Boycotting Kogi West Senatorial Supplementary Election</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Enioluwa Adeniyi</a></address>
      <p>The former senator representing Kogi West Senatorial district, <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/topic/dino-melaye/"><u><b>Dino Melaye</b></u></a>, has reacted to the alleged plan to boycott the November 30 supplementary election.</p>
      <p>The People Democratic Party’s candidate was losing to the candidate of the All Progressives Congress, Smart Adeyemi, during the re-ordered election which was conducted on November 16 before the election was declared inconclusive.</p>
      <p>The Independent National Electoral Commission has fixed the supplementary election for November 30.</p>
      <p>Melaye while speaking on Channels TV on Sunday stated that the reported plan to boycott the Saturday’s election was a misrepresentation by PDP spokesman.</p>
      <p>The Senator stated that he and his party will contest in the election on Saturday despite alleged falsified results.</p>
      <p>Melaye said: <i>“The reports about me boycotting Saturday election is just the imagination of APC. We never said we are boycotting the election.”</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“PDP only rejected the results of the past election. The PDP is the people’s party and will never shy away from political participation though we know they are not credible and fair.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“PDP respects the constitutionalism of democracy and will never boycott election even though figures from Kabba local government area are wrong.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“I will not boycott Saturday’s election.”</i>
