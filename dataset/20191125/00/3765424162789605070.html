      <p>Tyler Perry has agreed to pay the R206 469 medical bill and travel costs of a couple stranded in Mexico.</p>
      <p>The 50-year-old star stepped in after reading about the plight of Stephen Johnson, who fell ill with pancreatitis and diabetes while onboard a Carnival Dream cruise ship with fiancee Tori Austin.</p>
      <p>The holidaymaker was urged to seek treatment and spent three days in intensive care at a hospital in Progreso, Mexico, but when he was on the mend, he and his partner were presented with a huge bill which they were unable to pay as they had neither health nor travel insurance.</p>
      <p>Tori asked if they could work out a payment plan once they were back home in the US but the request was denied and they were barred from leaving the hospital.</p>
      <p>The woman also claimed staff locked windows to stop them escaping and threatened to call police if they tried to leave.</p>
      <p>She said: “It’s been a nightmare. We just want to come home. [It’s] hell. I very much so am a hostage.”</p>
      <p>According to KTRK-TV, Tyler heard about their struggles on ‘Good Morning America’ and reached out to help.</p>
      <p>Tori wrote on Facebook on Sunday: “Today I am thankful for and will always be thankful for Tyler Perry. My mom was also a huge fan of his.”</p>
      <p>According to NBC News, as of Saturday, the hospital had not received the money but noted international transfers can take several days to come through.</p>
      <p>It is currently unclear when the couple will return home but Tori said on Facebook they had been told they would be allowed to leave the hospital on Monday.</p>
