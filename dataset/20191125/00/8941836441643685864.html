      <p>CONCORD, N.H. (AP) - New Hampshire’s secretary of state is set to announce the date for the first-in-the-nation presidential primary.</p>
      <p>New Hampshire state law requires its primary to be held at least seven days ahead of any other similar contest and gives Secretary of State <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/bill-gardner/">Bill Gardner</a> exclusive power to set the date.</p>
      <p>In past years, other states have jockeyed to move their primaries earlier in hopes of grabbing some of the spotlight New Hampshire enjoys. But without that pressure this time, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/bill-gardner/">Gardner</a> is expected on Monday to set the date for Feb. 11, eight days after the leadoff Iowa caucuses.</p>

        <p>That’s less than 12 weeks away, but <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/bill-gardner/">Gardner</a> has cut it considerably closer before. He set the Jan. 8, 2008, primary date less than seven weeks ahead of election day.</p>
