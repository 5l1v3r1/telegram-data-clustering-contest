      <h1>Why EQ Matters At Work</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Committee of 200</a></address>
      <p><i>By Carol Lowe, Executive Vice President &amp; CFO of FLIR Systems, Inc.; C200 member since 2014. </i>In business, people are everything. This tends to be something we think HR owns. Even when we know investing in our employees is job number one, it often falls down the priority list. As a long-time CFO who has been responsible for driving financial performance and meeting aggressive goals, you might think I’d be focused on numbers. And I am. But I also know that it’s the people who drive the numbers.</p>
      <p>People must be able to work together well, or a company won’t meet its goals. The problem is that it takes time to build team cohesiveness and trust, and in today’s rapidly changing business environment, we just don’t have the time to wait for teams to become stronger organically. We have to be intentional.</p>
      <p>That’s why I believe in investing in team building. Some might call this kind of effort “fluffy,” but it pays real financial dividends. The reality is that people need help getting to know one another, and themselves. This kind of awareness can come naturally over time, but it can be immensely helpful to give the process a push in the right direction.</p>

      <p>People often have very different ways of perceiving the world around them, and that vision is rooted in EQ, otherwise known as emotional intelligence. EQ helps us recognize and understand emotions, both in ourselves and in others. People who have higher EQ are better able to manage their emotions and use them for the intended purposes. In other words, people with high EQ tend to get along better with others in social settings—like an office.</p>
      <p>While there isn’t a lot we can do to improve our IQ, there are plenty of things that improve our EQ, thus making us better team members, and higher-performing professionals overall. With this in mind, no matter what goal a company may be targeting, EQ development is an excellent starting point.</p>
      <p>I think it’s helpful to have a neutral party facilitate exercises that call for people to let their walls down, so I typically partner with an outside firm to do team-building work on EQ. We start by doing a deep dive on the science behind EQ, so people can learn how the brain responds in very different ways for different people. (This data is often necessary to gain buy-in from analytical minds, and garner team-wide commitment to the process.) From there, we participate in a variety of exercises that are meant to speed up the natural “getting to know your coworkers” process.</p>
      <p>In one recent exercise, we all wrote down a formative year in our life that made a difference in our trajectory—either personally or professionally. We then went chronologically through the years, and all shared the central experience that played a role in shaping who we are today. Many of us chose to share things we had never talked about at work, and it really helped us get to know one another on a deeper level.</p>
      <p>When colleagues open up like that, they gain a greater sense of trust and comfort in one another. It changes the dynamic. You feel like you know people better, understand them on a deeper level, and you become more invested in their success.</p>
      <p>We go into these exercises with the “what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas” rule. We understand that the information and experiences shared are not going to be discussed with anyone outside the group and we are not going to talk about it with each other later around the water cooler. But having these conversations just one time changes the relationship. You take the feelings with you, developing intimate trust on a personal level. Organically, it could take years to build that level of trust, but by being intentional, we can significantly accelerate the process.</p>
      <p>The results are truly transformative! If colleagues were previously struggling to see eye to eye, they become much more collaborative after going through EQ work. New team members shake the feeling of being outsiders, fostering two-way trust with their tenured coworkers. There is a renewed energy and sense of optimism in daily interactions. Not only does it feel better for employees, it makes the business run better.</p>
      <p>As leaders, it is our job to help guide our team members down the right paths so they can become more effective, productive, and engaged in their jobs. These improvements are rooted in EQ. In today’s workplace where we ask so much from our people, it is our responsibility to provide as much support as we can to help them get the job done. That’s why I believe if you’re not providing EQ support, your team members and your business are missing out.</p>
