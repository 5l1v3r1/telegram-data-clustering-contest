      <p>A small passenger plane crashed shortly after take-off on Sunday, killing at least 25 people, including some on the ground, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
      <p><i>Aljazeera</i> reports that the plane, operated by local company Busy Bee, went down after shortly take-off in the eastern city of Goma, North Kivu Governor Carly Nzanzu Kasivita’s office said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Two survivors, including one member of the crew, were being cared for at a local hospital, according to the National Border Health Programme.</p>
      <p>The company said the 19-seater Dornier 228-200 had 16 passengers and two crew members on board. The aircraft was headed for the city of Beni, 350km (220 miles) north of Goma, when it went down.</p>
      <p>Images from the scene showed plumes of black smoke and flames from the burning plane as locals looked on. Rescue workers combed through the burned-out fuselage.</p>
      <p>The exact number of casualties on the plane and on the ground was not yet known.</p>
      <p>Witnesses said the pilot was attempting to return the plane to the airport after they heard a loud sound that seemed to come from the engine, according to <i>Al Jazeera’s</i> Alain Uaykani, reporting Beni.</p>
      <p>He said Busy Bee indicated the engine had just been changed on the plane.</p>
      <p>“Something apparently has gone wrong with the new engine. They could not save anyone from this plane because of the difficult situation with the location of the area,” Uaykani said.</p>
