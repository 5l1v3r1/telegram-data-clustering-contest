      <p>The UFC’s next pay-per-view event, UFC 245, is still a few weeks away, but with three title fights at the top of the card, it’s not too early to get a look at the early odds for those three contests. UFC 245, which is the final UFC pay-per-view event of 2019, takes place on December 14 at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas. The PPV portion of the card streams on ESPN+ following prelims on ESPN2 and ESPN+. </p>
      <p>The first of the three title fights features two-division women’s champion Amanda Nunes facing off against Germaine de Randamie. Nunes, who owns both the 135 and 145-pound titles, puts her bantamweight belt on the line against de Randamie, who is the former 145-pound UFC titleholder. The two meet in 2013. Nunes won that contest by first-round TKO. Since that setback, de Randamie has gone unbeaten in five fights, while Nunes has put together a 9-1 run.</p>
      <p>Nunes’ past six fights have all been title bouts. During that run, she defeated notable fighters Miesha Tate, Ronda Rousey, Cris Cyborg and Holly Holm. Nunes is a -310 favorite over de Randamie, who is a +240 underdog.</p>
      <p>In the co-main event, Max Holloway defends his featherweight title against Alexander Volkanovski. Volkanovski has risen rather quickly up the 145-pound rankings. Since he joined the UFC in 2016, Volkanovski is 7-0 with the promotion. His past three wins have come against Darren Elkins, ex-UFC featherweight title challenger Chad Mendes and ex-UFC featherweight champion Jose Aldo. </p>
      <p>Holloway won the interim featherweight crown in 2016. He then unified the title in 2017. Holloway has since defended the 145-pound belt three times. His most recent win was a July decision victory over ex-lightweight champ Frankie Edgar. Holloway is a -170 favorite over Volkanovski, who comes in as a +140 underdog.</p>
      <p>In the headlining bout at UFC 245, welterweight champion Kamaru Usman faces ex-interim champion Colby Covington. These two have built up quite a rivalry over the past few years. In 2015, Usman won Season 21 of The Ultimate Fighter. Since then, he has won nine more fights with the UFC. The most recent victory during that unbeaten run was his March decision win over Tyron Woodley. That triumph earned him the welterweight crown. </p>
      <p>Covington might not be undefeated in the UFC, but he has only lost one contest since he joined the promotion in 2014. Covington has won seven straight bouts. HIs most recent win was an August decision victory over ex-champion Robbie Lawler. Usman is a -175 favorite over Covington, who is a +140 underdog.</p>
      <p>A total of 12 fights are scheduled for UFC 245.</p>
