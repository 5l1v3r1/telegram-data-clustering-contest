      <p>As we turn the decade, a few things have changed. Brexit befuddlement has unbalanced Europe, a reality TV star businessman has become US president… and <a href="https://bit.ly/2rH3LSq">Reece’s</a> chocolate peanut butter cups are available in many countries outside of America.Devices and software have changed too.</p>
      <p>Back at the end of the start of 2010, the idea of a usable and affordable tablet computer was the stuff of prototypes and failed proof of concept projects. Of course that all changed in April 2010 when the iPad was introduced. Since that time we’ve all become a lot more accustomed to talking about ‘apps’ (as in applications, obviously) and we’ve reached a point where even the Baby Boomer generation knows how to pinch and swipe on a touchscreen.</p>
      <p>So what’s next for applications?</p>
      <p>
        <b>The three A’s of apps</b>
      </p>
      <p>Among the key trends driving software usage at the moment are the drives for automation, abstraction and autonomy.</p>
      <p>Automation will come in the form of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) as more of our application functions will be carried out automatically for us. Abstraction will elevate the user upwards away from the guts of deeper technical functions and allow us to interact with database analytics and other intelligence services simply by typing (or speaking) commands in natural language. Autonomy will allow all these systems to look after themselves and self-heal, repair, update and receive augmentations without human interaction.</p>
      <p>What the three A’s of automation, abstraction and autonomy actually give us the users is the ability to more heavily customize as we pick and choose from smaller, more specialized, more finely tuned components of software.</p>
      <p>So going forward, yes we’ll still be using apps, but we’ll be using just the pieces of application we want, presented in the way we like to use them, integrated with the wider services layer that our work (and indeed home) lives depend upon… and it will all be intelligently connected from front to back. The tech industry would call that a ‘seamless end-to-end user experience’, but let’s try not to use quite that marketing cheese here.</p>
      <p>This discussion stems from predictions made by the magicians at analyst house Gartner, who believe that as many as 40% of employees worldwide will build their own customized ‘app playlist’ next year. Software vendors have been talking about the rise of the so-called composable software stack for some time now, but analysis around this point has gravitated towards more system level software. This is composability at the front end in a far more granular way than just deciding whether you want to run Apple OS X, Windows or indeed Linux.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The end of one-size-fits-all apps</b>
      </p>
      <p>According to Gartner’s <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kasey-panetta-98115313/">Kasey Panetta</a>, “By 2023, 40% of professional workers will orchestrate their business application experiences and capabilities like they do their music streaming services. Historically, organizations have offered employees a ‘one-size-fits-all’ application solution. Regardless of job description or needs, each employee operated within the same business application. Employees fit their job to the application — sometimes to the detriment of their own job.”</p>
      <p>Panetta suggests that in the future (and she means inside the next three years), business units and individuals will receive application capabilities in building block form, enabling them to create bespoke custom-built playlists of applications that are customized to specific employee needs and jobs. </p>
      <p>So that’s great then? Everything will be more composable and customizable and creativity will flourish across the land? Yes and no. Users will get more choice, but the backend boys and girls running the engine room will need to shoulder a few new responsibilities. Databases for one will come under heavier pressure to store and move batch data and real-time data. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Keeping the beat</b>
      </p>
      <p>Some of the elements in the newly composable application playlist will come from compute and storage resources on a user’s home device. Some will come from nearby on-premises servers where latency is never a major worry. Some will come from public cloud resources that are capable of ‘keeping the beat’ required to serve every playlist in the current hit parade.</p>
      <p>But some will come from streaming applications where software developers will need to rely upon heavyweight infrastructure resources in order to serve the playlist’s top 10 hits and beyond — and this has implications some complex interlacing work at the back end.</p>
      <p>“While there's a growing customer requirement for event streaming applications, it's been challenging for developers to build these applications as they require a heavyweight infrastructure that stitches together multiple disparate systems built by multiple companies. This means only organizations with the largest budgets and access to select talent can build and maintain these applications. What developers need is an easy-to-use integrated solution that brings the approachable feel of relational databases to the world of stream processing, making it dramatically easier to build event streaming applications," said <a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/neha-narkhede/#1579e8167e96">Neha Narkhede</a>, co-founder and CTO at event streaming platform company Confluent.</p>
      <p>Many event streaming applications require subscriptions to events when they happen (these queries ‘push’ updates to the app) and these have to work with point-in-time ‘lookups of state’ (that the app ‘pulls’ from). In traditional architectures, push and pull queries were accessed from multiple disparate systems, adding to the complexity of event streaming apps. But with pull queries, Narkhede’s Confluent insists that it simplifying the development of event streaming applications by integrating traditional database-like lookups on top of materialized tables built for stored data. By adding pull queries, Confluent says that its ksqlDB database offers one SQL query language to work with both push and pull queries, in one model.</p>
      <p>Take a ride sharing app for example. Because drivers are always moving, the location of your driver on your map needs to be continuously updated. This is accomplished through push queries that the app subscribes to for updates. On the other hand, information like the price of your ride is locked in once and doesn’t change during your trip. This is information that the app pulls from a data store.</p>
      <p>In traditional event streaming applications, supporting both push and pull queries meant working with two different data systems. Again here, Confluent suggests that with ksqlDB, they are unified in one platform and so the app can work with a more simplified architecture.</p>
      <p>As a future trend – and if Gartner’s Panetta is proved right and Confluent’s Narkhede’s notions are validated – we will require a whole lot more integrated backend systems to serve what are now more widely distributed applications. With the term ‘distributed’ in this sense meaning an app that draws its resources from more than one place, rather than an app that is shared among many users – although distributed composable applications usually do that too.</p>
      <p>Application playlists may be tuning up, but we’ll need some high-fidelity orchestration to make them all play harmoniously. </p>
