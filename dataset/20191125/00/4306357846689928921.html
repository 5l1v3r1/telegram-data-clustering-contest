      <h3>Jose Mourinho has apologised to Tottenham Hotspur supporters after he refused to approach the away end after his side’s 3-2 win over West Ham United in the Premier League on Saturday.</h3>
      <p>Mourinho took charge of his first game as Spurs boss on Saturday lunchtime after having been brought in as the north London club’s new manager last week.</p>
      <p>Spurs were 3-0 up early in the second half thanks to goals from Son Heung-Min, Lucas Moura and Harry Kane.</p>
      <p>However, goals from Michail Antonio and Angelo Ogbonna made the scoreline look more appealing to West Ham United fans.</p>
      <p>Spurs claimed all three points to notch up their first Premier League away win since 20 January.</p>
      <p>Mourinho chose not to approach the away supporters after the final whistle, and he explained his decision after the game.</p>
      <p>Speaking in an interview quoted by <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/23/jose-mourinho-apologises-tottenham-fans-west-ham-win-11206640/">Metro</a>, Mourinho said: “At the end of the game I didn’t want to go to our fans because I felt I shouldn’t.</p>
      <p>“It’s about the players, not about me. Apologies for that, I stayed away.</p>
      <p>“But I appreciate the few thousand who were there behind the team and I think really enjoying and understanding the difficulties and supporting, and probably now as happy as we are.”</p>
      <p>Next up for Mourinho and his Tottenham team is a home clash against Olympiakos in the Champions League on Tuesday night, before a home clash against Bournemouth in the Premier League next weekend.</p>
      <p>Mourinho was drafted in to take over from Mauricio Pochettino last week after the Argentine was sacked on Tuesday night.</p>
