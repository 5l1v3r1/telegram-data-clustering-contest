      <h3>Sam Omatseye</h3>
      <p>Anyone who heard the name Salome Abuh on the national stage until last week paid no heed. No one hears it now without a tear at heart.</p>
      <p>A woman was asleep in her home. A band of hoodlums came there, poured petrol on the house and set it on fire. They hear the woman moan and cry for help. They looked with a devil’s eye and heard with a reptile’s deafness.</p>
      <p>The woman cried until she descended into silence. Her party –PDP- had lost the election. At least, they should have given her a chance to live. The thugs sniffed a suya in a human body, a woman, a wife, a mother, a neighbour, a citizen. Minute by minute, she burned.</p>
      <p>The window’s burglary proof installed to prevent the intruder prevented her escape. The thugs are modern day cave men. They are technicians of human extermination.</p>
      <p>I am not for the death penalty. But in this case, I make an exception.</p>
      <p>The hoodlums have no place in human society. It is how politics and the caveman have defined modern Nigeria.</p>
