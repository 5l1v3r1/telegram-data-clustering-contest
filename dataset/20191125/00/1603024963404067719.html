      <p>LVMH has agreed a $16.2 billion deal to buy U.S. jeweller Tiffany, Louis Vuitton's parent firm confirmed on Monday, in the luxury good maker's biggest purchase to date.</p>
      <p>The deal will boost LVMH's smallest business, the jeweller and watch division, home to Bulgari and Tag Heuer.</p>
      <p>Fashion and accessories brands including Christian Dior generate the bulk of the earnings at the conglomerate, which is run by France's richest man, Bernard Arnault.</p>
      <p>"The acquisition of Tiffany will strengthen LVMH's position in jewellery and further increase its presence in the United States," LVMH and Tiffany said in a joint statement.</p>
      <p>Tiffany CEO Alessandro Bogliolo said the transaction would "provide further support, resources and momentum."</p>
      <p>The companies said they expected to close the deal in mid-2020.</p>
      <p>The swoop on Tiffany, which involved revised offers from LVMH after its original $120 per share bid in October, comes amid an attempted turnaround for the jewellery chain.</p>
      <p>Founded in New York in 1837 and known for its signature robin's egg blue packaging, the brand is one of the best-known names in the sector, but has struggled to win over younger shoppers in recent years.</p>
      <p>It now also has to contend with shifting spending patterns as Chinese shoppers retreat from the United States and spend more at home.</p>
