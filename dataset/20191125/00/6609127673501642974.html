      <p>It came amid claims bosses could’ve faced criminal charges over the scandal at Glasgow’s Queen Elizabeth Uni Hospital.</p>
      <p>Shadow health secretary Mr Briggs said: “We have a duty of care to patients and our NHS staff. This shows a complete lack of that. It’s utterly shocking.”</p>
      <p>The November 2018 report listed numerous problems linked to training staff.</p>
      <p>An accompanying letter demanded urgent action to protect workers, patients and the public.</p>

      <p>But within weeks two had died from bugs linked to pigeon droppings.</p>
      <p>And on Sunday, it was claimed 10 more infections linked to contaminated water were identified as far back as 2016.</p>
      <p>Top bacteriologist Professor Hugh Pennington, of Aberdeen Uni, said: “I’m astonished that NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde did not face criminal charges or other tough sanctions.</p>
      <p>"The consequences could be disastrous.”</p>
      <p>Health Secretary Jeane Freeman said she’d not seen the report, adding: “I think I should be informed when HSE issues serious compliance notices.”</p>
      <p>A health board spokeswoman said they implemented an action plan last December.</p>
