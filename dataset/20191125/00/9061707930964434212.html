      <p>U14 netballers from <a href="https://www.chellaston.derby.sch.uk/">Chellaston Academy</a> have managed to bag two titles in a month.</p>
      <p>They won the Derby City tournament in October and have now gone on to finish as County champions and will represent Derbyshire at the Regional finals at Repton school in January.</p>
      <p>After losing their first game to a very strong Lady Manners side, they went on to successfully defeat all the other schools in their section including beating Trent College by 12 goals to 2, beating Dronfield 12-5 and Tibshelf 13-5.</p>
      <p>They then saw off Repton in the semi-finals who they beat 10 - 5, before facing Lady Manners again but this time in the final, showing that they have the ability to out perform anyone who got in their way of victory.</p>
      <p>The academy are very proud of the girls and their PE teacher and U14 coach, Mrs Grimwood said they were utterly brilliant and did themselves and the academy proud.</p>
      <p>"They played skillfully with true grit and determination throughout the tournament and were thoroughly deserving of the title. This is the first time that a <a href="https://www.chellaston.derby.sch.uk/">Chellaston</a> team have reached the regional stages of the tournament for 10 years and the girls should be really pleased with themselves," she said.</p>
