      <p>The <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/10/31/what-momphas-arrest-means-to-efcc-magu/"><u><b>Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC</b></u></a>, has on Monday, arraigned suspected internet fraudster, Ismaila Mustapha, alias <b>Mompha</b>.</p>
      <p><b>Naija News</b> understands that he was charged with 14 counts bordering on cyber fraud and money laundering by the EFCC.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the suspected <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/10/22/efcc-reveals-real-reason-mompha-was-arrested/"><u><b>internet fraudster</b> </u></a>has pleaded not guilty to the money laundering charges leveled against him.</p>
      <p>However, Justice Mohammad Liman remanded him in prison custody and adjourned till Friday for hearing of his bail application and commencement of trial.</p>
      <p>Naija News recalls that <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/22/mompha-demands-n5m-from-efcc-see-why/"><u><b>Mompha</b> </u></a>had on Thursday dragged EFCC before a High Court in Lagos State for detaining him beyond the constitutionally stipulated days without charging him to court.</p>
      <p>In the suit filed by his lawyers, Gboyega Oyewole (SAN), Ademola Adefolaju, Kolawole Salami and four others, the businessman is demanding the sum of N5m as damages from the anti-graft agency.The self-acclaimed Bureau-De-Change operator also sought a court order directing the EFCC to release him unconditionally forthwith from its custody.</p>
