      <p>WASHINGTON: Michael Bloomberg announced Sunday he is running for president, joining the crowded field of Democrats seeking to take on his fellow New York billionaire, President Donald Trump.</p>
      <p>"I'm running for president to defeat Donald Trump and rebuild America," Bloomberg, 77, said on his web page as a USD 30 million Bloomberg ad campaign hit US airwaves.</p>
      <p>The announcement ended speculation about the intentions of Bloomberg, who for weeks has been filing paperwork to be eligible as a candidate in primary voting and registered with the Federal Election Commission.</p>
      <p>"We cannot afford four more years of President Trump's reckless and unethical actions," the former New York mayor said.</p>
      <p>"He represents an existential threat to our country and our values.Â If he wins another term in office, we may never recover from the damage."</p>
      <p>With a personal fortune of USD 50 billion, Bloomberg will shake up the open race, with 17 candidates already vying to be the Democratic nominee to take on Trump next year.</p>
      <p>Former vice president Joe Biden leads the race ahead of left-wingers Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, with moderate Pete Buttigieg in fourth place, according to national polls.</p>
