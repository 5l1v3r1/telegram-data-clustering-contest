      <p>The Ghana Police Hospital has announced that it will in the next 21 days embark on a mass burial for about 120 unidentified and unclaimed bodies as part of routine measures to decongest the hospital mortuary.</p>
      <p>These unidentified and unclaimed dead bodies are made up of mostly paupers, unknown former patients, abandoned dead bodies, unidentified accident and crime victims.</p>
      <p>The police hospital in a statement signed by DSP Yaw Nketia-Yeboah head of public Affiars urged the public to contact the pathology department of the Ghana Police Hospital for identification of persons who might have not been seen for some time as part of the search.</p>
      <p>“This is to avert a situation whereby such bodies are added to those earmarked for the mass burial,” the statement said.</p>
      <p>The hospital further encouraged the public to acquire the habit of always having their National Identification Cards or that of any organisation on them to help police and others easily identify them whenever they are in any health crisis or involved in an accident.</p>
