      <p>As<i> part of my series featuring the rising stars in the music industry, I had the pleasure of interviewing Jersey Demic. Born on the small island of Dominica and moving to The United States as a child, Jersey Demic has become known for much more than just his music. He started as a touring act with Hot Import Nights hosting and performing at one of the biggest lifestyle events in America. From that he moved on to releasing music primarily on the Internet and has been covered on some of hip hop‚Äôs biggest websites such as Worldstarhiphop, Okayplayer and more. Demic performed twice at the world-renowned SXSW Festival at showcases that were sponsored by corporations as big as Paypal and Visa. Demic‚Äôs music focuses on success and motivation without getting too deep or going over the listeners head.</i></p>

        <b>Thank you so much for joining us! Can you tell us a story about what brought you to this specific career path?</b>
      </p>
      <p>I started recording music in Junior high school because I wanted to recreate the feeling that I felt when I heard other artist‚Äôs music at the time. More specifically Tupac was a huge inspiration for me.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Can you share the most interesting story that occurred to you in the course of your music career?</b>
      </p>
      <p>There have been times where I have had to perform at shows in front of 5,000 people and then I had to get on a Greyhound and take an 8-hour bus ride back to NYC in order to get to work on time. Sometimes that has gone smooth and other times it didn‚Äôt go so smooth.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What are some of the most interesting or exciting projects you are working on now?</b>
      </p>
      <p>An interesting project I am working on right now is an app called Tully. It‚Äôs interesting because it‚Äôs an app that was founded by my friend Dhruv and Joyner Lucas. The app includes creative tools to aid with the music creation process and also ways to get the music out into the marketplace through distribution.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Who are some of the most interesting people you have interacted with? What was that like? Do you have any stories?</b>
      </p>
      <p>I was recently on tour with Chris Brown and Tory Lanez. That was really fascinating because they are currently two of the biggest R&amp;B artists. I learned a lot of things about performing and everything else that goes into an arena-sized tour.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Which people in history inspire you the most? Why?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Kanye West initially inspired me with his music production. When everyone was using sped-up soul samples in hip-hop, it was a great feel, good time in music. Tupac also inspired me because I just loved the way he balanced his music from being very aggressive to being very heartfelt.</p>
      <p>
        <b>How have you used your success to bring goodness to the world?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The world is good, but I use my success mostly to directly touch the people who care about me and have made a difference in my life. I helped my mother and sister open a family-practice medical clinic. Those are the things I‚Äôm the most proud of and I plan on doing much more for my family and friends as we continue to grow.</p>

        <b>You are a person of great influence. If you could start a movement that would bring the most amount of good to the most amount of people, what would that be? You never know what your idea can trigger.¬†üôÇ</b>
      </p>
      <p>I believe that the most good you can do begins by affecting the people closest to you. That thought alone can help change the world because I believe many people concentrate on charity and the macro-picture but ignore their loved ones. It‚Äôs like donating food to a food bank but your cousins and nephews go to bed hungry every night. Educating people on skill building at a young age would probably make a huge difference in the world also.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Which tips would you recommend to your colleagues in your industry to help them to thrive and not ‚Äúburn out‚Äù?</b>
      </p>
      <p>I believe that you have to create a lifestyle where you don‚Äôt ever feel burned out from doing the work that you love. You have to create processes in your daily routine that will put you in a position of success. I never believed in separating my business from pleasure. I wake up and I make music because its second nature to me. I also created an environment where I can easily create music without going out of my way. That was very important in my current success.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What are your ‚Äú5 things I wish someone told me when I first started‚Äù and why. Please share a story or example for each.</b>
      </p>
      <p>I wish I knew that there are no real shortcuts to the top and even the shortcuts that you think are shortcuts really aren‚Äôt. To be solid, you really have to go through every single step and build your fan base properly. If you skip a step, your career will suffer for it in the long run. I‚Äôve gone through this myself.</p>
      <p>
        <b>We are blessed that some of the biggest names in Business, VC funding, Sports, and Entertainment read this column. Is there a person in the world, or in the US whom you would love to have a private breakfast or lunch with, and why? He or she just might see this, especially if we tag them¬†üôÇ</b>
      </p>
      <p>I have some great breakfasts and conversations with the most powerful people in the industry thanks to Dhruv and being involved in Tully, but I would love to sit down with some people in the financial sector. People who have created passive income from investing in stocks and who understand money more than they understand people.</p>
      <p>
        <b>How can our readers follow you on social media?</b>
      </p>
      <p>They can follow me @kingdemic on Instagram thats what I‚Äôm currently checking on the daily. I am also @kingdemic on Twitter. They can also search me up as Jersey Demic on all other platforms.</p>
