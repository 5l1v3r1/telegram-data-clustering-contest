      <p>(Bloomberg) -- Hong Kong stocks climbed after pro-democracy candidates swept the board in district council elections, putting pressure on the city’s government to address issues that have fueled months of protests.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.investing.com/indices/hang-sen-40">Hang Seng Index</a> rose 1.5%. The gain was led by developers and other stocks seen as most sensitive to the demonstrations, which have weighed on the city’s stocks.</p>
      <p>Wharf Real Estate Investment and New World Development Co. were among the top performers on Monday, while MTR Corp., which operates the city’s underground railway, rallied 2.6%. The MSCI Hong Kong Index gained 1.8%.</p>
      <p>Pro-democracy candidates took at least 278 seats of the 452 up for grabs, according to the South China Morning Post, about seven times more than the pro-government camp. Pro-democracy groups gained control of at least 12 of the 18 district councils after failing to win a majority in any of them four years ago, the report said.</p>
