      <h1>Sims Metal share price lifts after $135 million sale</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:36:02+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 00:36</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fool.com.au/author/kennethhallau/" target="_blank">Kenneth Hall</a></address>
      <p>The <b>Sims Metal Management Ltd </b><a href="https://www.fool.com.au/tickers/ASX-SGM/">(ASX: SGM)</a> share price is up 2.59% at the time of writing after announcing an €83.5 million business sale.</p>
      <h3>Why is the Sims Metal share price moving today?</h3>
      <p>The Sims Metal share price is on the move after the sale of its European compliance scheme-oriented recycling operations.</p>
      <p>A subsidiary of <b>REMONDIS Group</b>, TSR Recycling, will purchase the operations for €83.5 million (A$135.6 million).</p>
      <p>The sale will cover operations across Germany, Austria, Netherlands, Belgium and Sweden. However, it will not comprise any assets that are part of the company’s global e-recycling IT asset disposal business.</p>
      <p>The sale, which has seen the Sims Metal share price move more than 2% this morning, is part of <a href="https://www.fool.com.au/2019/11/08/why-the-sims-metal-share-price-is-climbing-higher-today/">a capital management strategy</a>. Proceeds from the sale will be used to strengthen Sims’ “already strong” balance sheet. The sale is expected to have an impact on the group’s FY19 earnings.</p>
      <p>Earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) estimates were provided as if the sale was completed by 30 June 2018.</p>
      <p>Global E-Recycling underlying EBIT would have fallen $26.0 million lower without the sale of the European operations. The Net European Compliance Scheme Operations Contributions impact comprised $22.3 million. The remaining $3.7 million in EBIT was from Net Global E-Recycling (excluding European Operations).</p>
      <h3>How has Sims Metal performed on the ASX this year?</h3>
      <p>The Sims Metal share price closed at $10.82 per share on Friday, putting the Aussie recycler’s shares  up 10.40% so far this year, which is a significant underperformance against the <b>S&amp;P/ASX 200 Index </b>(INDEXASX: XJO).</p>
      <p>The benchmark Aussie index has gained 21.28% in 2019 and closed on Friday at 6,740.60 points.</p>
      <p>With today’s share price gains, Sims Metal has a market cap of $2.25 billion and a net dividend yield of 3.78%. The company’s shares are currently trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 14.52x prior after <a href="https://www.fool.com.au/2019/10/28/why-the-sims-metal-share-price-crashed-15-lower-today/">a difficult past month or so</a>.</p>
