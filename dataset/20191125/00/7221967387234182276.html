        <img src="https://static.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/TunnelBear-Connected.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>If you’ve been looking for a VPN, you’ve probably heard of TunnelBear. While some VPN services are a little difficult to use, TunnelBear is easy to set up and use. But what is it, and how much does it cost?</p>
      <p>Available for Windows, macOS, iPhone, and Android, TunnelBear has a simple privacy policy and does not collect usage logs. This will help enhance your privacy further while connecting to the web via a VPN.</p>
      <p>While the VPN can be used to circumvent geo-blocking, TunnelBear sadly does not offer support for torrenters.</p>
      <p>While Tunnelbear has a useful free option, it is limited to 500MB of data per month. Right now, it has a 58 percent discount on offer, so if you pay $49.99 per year, <a href="http://click.tunnelbear.com/aff_c?offer_id=40&amp;aff_id=3122">Tunnelbear’s service works out at just $4.17 a month</a>. There’s also a $9.99 monthly package if you prefer not to sign up long-term.</p>
      <p>As <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/tunnelbear-the-easiest-vpn-for-protecting-your-privacy/">noted in our review</a>, “TunnelBear’s approach […] brings easy, affordable privacy and peace-of-mind to users around the world.”</p>
