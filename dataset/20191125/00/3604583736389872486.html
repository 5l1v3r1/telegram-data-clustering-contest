      <p>A 29-year-old Ballarat man has been charged after allegedly fleeing from and assaulting police officers.</p>
      <p>Just before 5.30pm on Friday, Dareton Traffic and Highway Patrol Command officers stopped the Ballarat man in a Holden Commodore on Beverley Street in Wentworth - north of Mildura on the NSW/Victoria border - for a random breath test.</p>
      <p>He was arrested for an outstanding warrant before allegedly fleeing on foot.</p>
      <p>He allegedly ran to a retirement village and damaged property before hiding under a vehicle in the yard. He was then found by a female officer.</p>

      <p>Police allege a violent struggle occurred, with a 66-year-old member of the public being punched in the face and bitten on the finger.</p>
      <p>More police were called to the scene and the Ballarat man was eventually arrested.</p>
      <p>He was taken to hospital with a laceration to his leg, while other police officers were also allegedly injured - a senior constable suffered a dislocated shoulder, a sergeant suffered a knee injury and three constables sustained minor injuries.</p>
      <p>The Ballarat man was released from hospital and charged with 14 offences at Dareton Police Station:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Assault police officer in execution of duty without actual bodily harm</li>
        <li>Escape police custody</li>
