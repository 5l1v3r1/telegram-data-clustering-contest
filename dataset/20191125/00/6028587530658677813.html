      <p>Many people have experienced the situation: you need to move to a new apartment but don’t have cash to cover the security deposit. Usually, this problem is solved by saving up the deposit, belt tightening, negotiating with the landlord to lower it or pay it in installments, or, if it is available asking for help from a family member. But what if none of those options are available or exhausted? And what if, even worse, you’re trying to leave an abusive partner or losing your living situation for a pressing reason. Two efforts in two cities are taking different approaches to helping with this problem <a href="https://www.seattlecu.com/">Seattle Credit Union</a>’s new product is called simply, the <a href="https://www.seattlecu.com/renters-loan">Renters Loan</a>, aimed at people who are struggling to come up with enough cash to pay a deposit for a new apartment. The credit union’s website describes the loan as a response to growth. </p>
      <p>“With Seattle named as the fastest growing big city of the decade, housing can be a squeeze. The combination of first, last and deposit can be well into four figures, making it a challenge to secure a great place, even if you have a solid income.”</p>

      <p>I spoke with <a href="https://cuesnet.cues.org/networking/members/profile?UserKey=95eec5d3-4e0a-410d-91f4-e73386a5eab3">Tonita Webb</a> the Chief Operating Officer of Seattle Credit Union about the loan and where the idea came from to offer a loan for a deposit. She said part of it was personal; she has children that are trying to move out of her house but finding it difficult to move because of the cost. But Webb said she was also “hearing from a lot of people living in unsafe conditions because they are saving for a deposit.” </p>
      <p>But why lend money to people who can’t come up with money for a deposit? Webb said it is part of the credit union’s mission to “be a partner is prosperity.” Seattle is growing, Webb said, and the credit union is seeking to expand banking opportunity to people with less money. </p>
      <p>“We were created to help the underserved,” Webb said, the whole point of credit unions is to do what larger banks and lenders can’t or won’t do. </p>
      <p>I wondered if this wouldn’t just turn her loan officers into social workers, forcing them into working with customers with significant housing needs who walk through the door of a branch office. </p>
      <p>“I hope that they do,” Webb said. What about people with no credit or bad credit; no problem, said Webb, “We’ll work with people. Nobody’s story is the same, we care about the story because we believe people should not be defined by one aspect of their lives.” </p>
      <p>Is the loan helping anyone? After talking with Webb, I heard from Seattle Credit Union with an early success. A customer explained to a loan officer that after losing some income from being sick and that they didn’t have the deposit for an upcoming move. The customer submitted and application, was approved, and can now make the move as planned.</p>

        <figcaption>Cincinnati Councilmember PG Sittenfeld thinks mandated insurance will solve the deposit problem.<cite>Sittenfeld for Senate Campaign</cite></figcaption>

      <p>On the other side of the country, Cincinnati city councilmember <a href="https://www.cincinnati-oh.gov/sittenfeld/">PG SIttenfeld</a>thinks there is a different answer, requiring landlords to allow their tenants to use what’s being touted as “deposit insurance.” Instead of a deposit, landlords would be required to allow tenants to pay a monthly fee to a for profit company like <a href="https://www.sayrhino.com/">Rhino</a>, an insurance agency, to cover possible damage to a unit. </p>
      <p>I talked with Sittenfeld and he says his motives are threefold, to “eliminate a barrier to housing, put money back in peoples pockets rather than collecting dust as a deposit, and getting that money circulating in the economy.” Sounds good, right? A tenant would just pay a small monthly premium each month and if something goes wrong, the damage would be covered with a claim. </p>
      <p>But there are serious problems according to landlords who worry about lost rent while claims work their way through an insurance companies bureaucracy. Also, people with no deposit often don’t have credit, bad credit, or even a credit card needed to make monthly premium payments. And what happens if the tenant doesn’t pay the premium? Rhino will pay the deposit and then try to recover from the tenant. A tenant may still end up not only having to pay the deposit, but have worse credit from a collection effort. </p>
      <p>If the Rhino product is so good, why aren’t more landlords using it? Sittenfeld said this insurance product is “largely new.” Rhino’s press release about the legislation said that the proposal was “inspired” by their product. But Sittenfeld said he didn’t write the legislation to benefit Rhino even though he said he hadn’t spoken to any other companies offering insurance on deposits. It looks like Sittenfeld’s enthusiasm for solving a real problem got ahead of researching whether insurance is the answer or another dead end for poor people. </p>
      <p>The contrast in these two approaches is obvious; the loan will solve the problems of both tenant and landlord, and create better credit for a tenant who pays it back. The insurance mandate would probably complicate an already difficult situation, creating more uncertainty in a already competitive housing market.</p>
      <p>Rather than mandating use of an insurance product that is untested, why not incentivize both sides to test it out? A pilot program could require the Rhino to insure the first 500 tenants with no questions asked. Seattle Credit Union is taking some risk to solve the problem why shouldn’t Rhino? Maybe many of those 500 test cases would be successful, accomplishing the goal of eliminating a barrier, Rhino would have a great marketing story, tenants would save cash, landlords would be protected from risk, and Councilmember Sittenfeld would have a political win. </p>
