      <p>In poll manifesto, Britain’s Conservatives party says it won’t extend date for leaving the EU <br/><br/>British Prime Minister Boris Johnson promised on Sunday to get Brexit done to restore business confidence and unleash what he said would be a tidal wave of investment. He promised to bring his Brexit deal back to parliament before Christmas. <br/><br/><br/>"Get Brexit done," Johnson said at the launch of his Conservative Party election manifesto. He said that leaving the EU would restore confidence for businesses and voters. "Get Brexit done and we shall see a pent up tidal wave of investment into this country. Get Brexit done and we can focus our hearts and our minds on the priorities of the British people." <br/><br/>The Conservative Party said it will not extend the Brexit implementation period beyond December 2020. The party said it will negotiate a trade agreement next year - one that will strengthen our Union - and will not extend the implementation period beyond December 2020," the party said. "The only way to deliver Brexit is with a Conservative majority in parliament," the manifesto said, adding if in government, people coming to Britain from the EU would only access unemployment, housing and child benefit after five years. <br/><br/><br/>Johnson promised 23.5 billion pounds worth of tax cuts and public spending between 2020 and 2024, and said the impact on the government's day-to-day current budget would be close to zero.</p>
