      <h1>Leicester Plan £20m Move for Celtic Youngster Kristoffer Ajer in January</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.90min.com/users/15430530" target="_blank">Sean Walsh</a></address>
      <p>​<b>Exclusive - </b>Brendan Rodgers will look to his old club Celtic this January, in an attempt to land Norwegian starlet Kristoffer Ajer.</p>
      <p>The 21-year-old, originally a midfielder, was converted to a centre-back under Rodgers and has emerged as one of the top young defenders in Europe since moving to Celtic Park.</p>
      <p><i>90min</i> understands that Leicester are now set to make a move for Ajer when the window opens, believing they can land the rising star for less than £20m.</p>

      <p>Rodgers has wanted Ajer since he arrived at the King Power Stadium midway through last season and views him as another young player who can add quality to an already very exciting Leicester side. </p>
      <p>However, an move to bring Ajer south would not necessarily mean the Foxes selling any of their current defenders - though club captain Wes Morgan would inevitably slide further down the pecking order.</p>
      <p>With Morgan and Evans turning 36 and 32 before the end of the January window repsectively, Rodgers move could be seen as a prudent one to safeguard for the future.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/leicester">​Leicester</a> have been one of the biggest surprise packages in the <a href="https://www.90min.com/leagues/premier-league">​Premier League</a> so far this season, sitting in second place after 13 games and looking good for a place in next season's <a href="https://www.90min.com/categories/champions-league">​Champions League</a>. They've conceded the fewest goals in the league this campaign with eight shipped, largely due to the consistent form of <a href="https://www.90min.com/players/jonny-evans">Evans</a> and Caglar Soyuncu. </p>

      <p>Ajer would have to oust one of them from the side in order to start, though Rodgers' willingness to give youth a chance and their existing relationship could help give the Norway international the first-team assurances he would likely be seeking at the King Power.</p>
      <p>Leicester aren't the only ones keen on Ajer. As <a href="https://www.90min.com/posts/6478423-exclusive-man-utd-eyeing-three-top-norwegian-talents-ahead-of-january-transfer-window"><i>​90min</i></a> told you back in October, the defender is on Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's radar, with the <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/manchester-united">​Manchester United</a> boss keen on a trio of Norwegian talents that also includes Sander Berge and Erling Haaland.</p>
      <p>Rodgers' relationship with Celtic and their fans soured after his sudden departure to take the hotseat at Leicester, having previously insisted he was a Hoops supporter and citing his determination to win the 'treble treble' as their manager.</p>
      <p>The Northern Irishman brought Ajer to the UK from IK Start in 2016, and has a precedent of signing players he's worked with before. While Liverpool manager, he brought in Joe Allen and Fabio Borini having managed them at Swansea, before taking Scott Sinclair and Kolo Toure to Celtic.</p>
