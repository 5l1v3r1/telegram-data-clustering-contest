      <h1>Arsenal Begin Process of Replacing Unai Emery as Players Lose Faith in Under-Fire Boss</h1>

      <p>​Arsenal are understood to have started the process of parting ways with under-fire manager Unai Emery, with the majority of the squad losing faith in the Spaniard.</p>
      <p>The Gunners have won just two of their last 11 Premier League games and they find themselves eighth in the league table. There have been plenty of calls from fans of the club to sack Emery, and Saturday's 2-2 draw with Southampton has only increased the pressure on the boss.</p>

      <p>It appears as though <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/arsenal">​Arsenal</a> will soon give the fans what they want as, according to the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7719969/Arsenal-start-process-identifying-Unai-Emerys-successor-amid-growing-boardroom-dissatisfaction.html">​Daily Mail</a>, they have already started formally looking for replacements, but there is a real clash amongst the board of directors over whether Emery should be sacked immediately.</p>
      <p>Head of football Raul Sanllehi and technical director Edu both want Emery to be given slightly more time to turn things around, but others within the hierarchy have grown frustrated and want to see the back of the boss as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>Former <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/juve">​Juventus</a> manager Massimiliano Allegri is touted as a potential replacement, while <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/manchester-city">​Manchester City</a> assistant Mikel Arteta is also understood to be in the frame for the position.</p>

      <p>The club are fond of the idea of bringing in Mauricio Pochettino, but they fear the Argentine would refuse because of his links to <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/tottenham">​Tottenham Hotspur</a>. Arsenal also wanted José Mourinho before he took the Spurs job.</p>
      <p>The Gunners would prefer to wait until the end of the season, but they may be forced to act earlier. According to <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/24/arsenal-players-lose-faith-unai-emery-stuttering-bid-qualify/">​the Telegraph</a>, the playing squad have almost entirely lost faith in Emery's ability to turn the situation around.</p>
      <p>Players are said to be confused by his tactics, selections and instructions, and they believe that their lack of identity could cost them a place in next season's <a href="https://www.90min.com/categories/champions-league">​Champions League</a> if they don't act soon.</p>

      <p>Should Emery go in the near future, it is thought that coach Freddie Ljungberg could be given control of the team until the end of the season, when the Telegraph claim that Arsenal could move for Brendan Rodgers or Julian Nagelsmann.</p>
      <p>The club want to avoid seeing the toxic atmosphere at the Emirates Stadium get any worse, and the main way to do that is to cut ties with Emery as soon as possible.</p>
