      <p>Minister for Health and Medical Services, Doctor Ifereimi Waqainabete says the number of confirmed measles cases in the country still remains at 10 but there have been suspected cases around the country and their staff are working tirelessly to control the spread of the disease.</p>
      <p>Dr Waqainabete says recently a 1-year-old child who was part of a group from Kiribati was suspected of measles and the child is under isolation and quarantined at the CWM Hospital.</p>
      <p>He says the group that was travelling with the child have all had their measles shots and quarantined.</p>
      <p>He adds their team in Serua/Namosi Sub-division are still on the ground and are working to control the spread of the disease.</p>
      <p>Dr Waqainabete is urging everyone to refrain from attending any gatherings in the Serua/Namosi area and the Lami corridor.</p>
      <p>He says with the festive season coming up, people travelling overseas are advised to take their measles shot before leaving so they are immune from the disease while travelling.</p>
      <p>He adds the state of measles in the country is not at the level where Samoa is at now and if the measles case worsens, the quarantine will be their last resort.</p>
