      <h1>Breaking: Abuja Court Stops EFCC From Arraigning Ex-Customs Boss</h1>

      <p>A Federal High Court in the federal capital territory, Abuja has asked the<a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/25/federal-government-reacts-to-us-fraud-allegation-against-allen-onyema/"><u> Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC)</u></a> to stop charges against the Former Comptroller General of Customs (CGC), <b>Abdullahi Inde Dikko</b> for alleged financial infraction while in office.</p>
      <p>In a judgment on Monday, Justice Nnamdi Dimgba upheld Dikkoâ€™s argument that he can no longer be arraigned by any agency of the Federal Government after an agreement with the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and the Director-General of the Department of State Services (DSS) to refund $8million to the government.</p>
      <p>Justice Dimgba said that since it was proved that such an agreement exist, and Dikko has kept his side of the bargain by paying 1,576,000,000 and more to the Federal Government, through the EFCC funds recovery account in Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), it was wrong for the EFCC or any other agency of government to seek to arraign him (Dikko) on the same alleged crime.</p>
