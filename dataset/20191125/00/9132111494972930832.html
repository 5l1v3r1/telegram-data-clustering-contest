      <p>The Ghana National Canoe Fishermen Council (GNCFC) is demanding that government institutes an inquiry into the disappearance of a Fisheries Observer at sea.</p>
      <p>Fisheries observers are employed by the Ministry of Fisheries and Aquaculture Development and posted on industrial fishing trawlers to monitor their activities and report any wrongdoings.</p>
      <p>On July 5, 2019, a fisheries observer, Emmanuel Essien was posted onto the Meng Xin 15 which returned without him.</p>
      <p>He has since been reported missing.</p>
      <p>The GNCFC in a statement said the disappearance of Essien is “a serious matter because fisheries observers are one of Ghana’s frontline defenders against illegal fishing, therefore we demand that government exhibits adequate commitment in this matter.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>Enforcement of laws</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Council which serves as the mouthpiece of all artisanal fishers in Ghana is pushing for the enforcement of the fisheries laws and effective implementation of the fisheries management plans to ensure the achievement of the targets of the SDG goal 14 that covers Sustaining Life under Water.</p>
      <p>They also want government to immediately begin consultation with artisanal fishers through the GNCFC before the selection of the specific months for the proposed 2020 closed season as proposed in the 2010 budget.</p>
      <p>“However, we stress that the 2020 closed season should be implemented for all fleets at the same time, but within the biologically significant period (i.e. the pawning period from July to September).”</p>
      <p>It will be recalled that the 2019 closed season according to scientists did not achieve maximum results because it fell outside the spawning season.</p>
      <p>The GNCFC with support from the European Union’s ‘Far Ban Bo’ project, on World Fisheries Day called on government to immediately “enforce the fisheries laws to halt the widespread Illegal fishing and Stop the Illegal Transshipment (SAIKO) with immediate effect.</p>
      <p>“We cannot wait until 2020 as proposed in the 2020 Budget Statement, it will be too late, our fish stocks may collapse by then,” the statement said.</p>
      <p>The group, however, commended the Ghana industrial Trawlers Association (GITA) for the bold action to denounce SAIKO and register their support for enforcement of the laws against SAIKO.</p>
      <p>According to the statement, they support calls “on government to seize this opportunity to stop the SAIKO menace now.”</p>
      <p>World Fisheries Day provides the platform to discuss the problems in fisheries and highlight recommendations to sustain our fisheries and maintain our fish stocks.</p>
