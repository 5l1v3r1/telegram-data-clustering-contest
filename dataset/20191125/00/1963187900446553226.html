      <p>Real Madrid star Eden Hazard believes the right to the Golden Ball this year should be a player for Liverpool. <br/><br/>"I think this year's Golden Ball should be given to a Liverpool player, Mane, Salah or Van Dijk, they deserve," Hazard told French newspaper Le Parisien. <br/><br/>Hazard touched on the crisis of his teammate Karim Benzema with his country France and not called up for four years. <br/><br/>"It's a problem for France," Hazard said. "It's not normal for Benzema to not be called. I don't say that because he's my team-mate." <br/><br/>"Benzema is the best striker in the world now." <br/><br/>Hazard made no secret of his desire to join PSG striker Killian Mbappe. <br/><br/>"If I can help Mbappe join Real Madrid tomorrow, I will," Hazard said. <br/><br/>"He is a great talent. In a few years he will be the best player in the world." <br/><br/>"If he finishes like this, he will be one of the best players in history." <br/><br/>Hazard is playing his first season with Real Madrid since his summer move from Chelsea, scoring a solemn official goal to the moment.</p>
