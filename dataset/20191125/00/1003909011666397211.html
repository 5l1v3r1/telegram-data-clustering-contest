      <h1>National champion Dinos return home with Cup</h1>

      <p>They handed Adam Sinagra the MVP award after Saturday’s Vanier Cup game, but he quickly placed it back on the table. No disrespect intended, but there was a better-looking trophy he was most eager to get his hands on.</p>
      <p>“I was working so hard for that Vanier and they’re giving me another trophy, I’m like, what’s going on,” grinned the Calgary Dinos’ quarterback. “Obviously I’m very appreciative, being MVP of the Vanier Cup, that’s great and everything. But we’re champions. That’s all that really matters.”</p>
      <p>The day-after lamentations, the coulda, woulda, shouldas … those are all in the past. After a 24-year drought and four title game losses in the last 10 seasons, the Dinos returned home as national university football champs, having defeated the Carabins de Montreal by a convincing 27-13 score.</p>
      <p>The players looked a weary bunch, belying their inner excitement.</p>
      <p>“It’s starting to sink in now that we’re finally back home,” said fifth-year cornerback Sterling Taylor IV. “It’s an emotional feeling, to be on top of all of Canada, there’s nothing like it in the world. There are so many fifth-years in the country who never won a championship and never will. For me to be in this position, is humbling.”</p>
      <p>Taylor, a stalwart on the secondary, was playing with a dislocated shoulder.</p>
      <p>“It was challenging,” he admitted. “Mostly had to make decisions as whether to make the smarter hit or the harder hit.”</p>
      <p>Linebacker Ross DeLauw, another senior, got the opportunity to contribute significantly when Charlie Moore went down with an upper-body injury in the first half.</p>
      <p>“I just felt ready the whole time,” DeLauw pointed out. “I knew my assignments. When I saw Charlie go down, it was not a real big thing. The next man up motto; we’ve been going through that all season. I was just happy that I could step in and contribute and get the win like we did.”</p>
      <p>For many, the feat still hasn’t sunk in.</p>
      <p>“Part of me feels we still have meetings tomorrow,” said fifth-year receiver Hunter Karl. “It’s still surreal. It’s really special and I just thank the team so much because they’re the ones that got us here.”</p>
      <p>Karl, an Edmonton Eskimos’ 2019 draft pick, will enjoy the win for a bit then hit training for CFL camp.</p>
      <p>For those who have been part of the program for half a decade, even though they didn’t utter the word, you know they were thinking ‘finally’.</p>
      <p>“I’ve been here for six years but I feel every one of those years we had a team that could have won a Vanier Cup,” said halfback Nick Statz, drafted by the Calgary Stampeders earlier this year. “For all the coaches, the alumni, the Fifth Quarter, the staff … a ton of people have put a lot of work in to get this type of season out of us. It was fun.”</p>
      <p>The team was forced to head out to Quebec City early in the week and that established a routine quickly, which probably helped in their preparation.</p>
      <p>“I think it was a really important decision the coaches made,” said Sinagra. “Practising three days in a row in that time zone and just being all together that whole week sharpened our focus a bit. It was all business.”</p>
      <p>“To stay in Calgary wasn’t going to work very well,” explained head coach Wayne Harris Jr. “After some consideration, we thought it would be better to get everyone in there and settled. Being there for that long, setting up a routine, meeting schedules, study halls. We tried to keep things as normal as possible. I have to give credit to the Vanier Cup organizers for making it so easy for us.”</p>
      <p>Sinagra now hopes to get a CFL opportunity, but the former Hec Crighton Trophy winner knows he’ll always have 2019.</p>
      <p>“In my home province, it was awesome, having all my friends, my family, people I haven’t seen in awhile,” said the native of Pointe-Claire, Que. “All we ever worked for was championships. All the other stuff was nice but you play to win championships. I’m so proud of the guys in our locker room, they battled all year, faced so much adversity, injuries … it all came together.”</p>
      <p>Harris’ first win as a head coach comes in a season in which nothing came easy for the Dinos.</p>
      <p>“It’s such a great team accomplishment,” he acknowledged. “All the trials and tribulations, going through all of that, the guys persevered. You could see the focus on their faces through the playoffs. It’s been something we’ve worked so hard for.”</p>
