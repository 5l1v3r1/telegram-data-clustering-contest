      <h1>Jürgen Klopp Claims Virgil van Dijk Deserves to Win Ballon d'Or Over Lionel Messi</h1>

      <p>​Liverpool manager Jürgen Klopp has claimed that Virgil van Dijk was the best player in the world last season and deserves to win the Ballon d'Or ahead of Barcelona forward Lionel Messi.</p>
      <p>Van Dijk led Liverpool to Champions League glory, while they finished just one point behind Manchester City in the race for the Premier League title. He was named as the PFA Player of the Year ahead of Raheem Sterling, and many have tipped him to win the Ballon d'Or in December.</p>

      <p>Speaking to the media at the FWA awards (via <a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11669/11869654/virgil-van-dijk-jurgen-klopp-says-liverpool-defender-should-win-2019-ballon-dor">​Sky Sports</a>), Klopp insisted that <a href="https://www.90min.com/players/lionel-messi">​Messi</a> is still the best player in the world but, if the award is based on last season alone, Van Dijk would be the rightful winner.</p>
      <p>"If you give the Ballon d'Or to the best player of this generation then you should give it always to Lionel Messi. That's how it is," the boss said.</p>
      <p>"But if you give it to the best player of last season, then it was Virgil van Dijk. I don't know exactly how it will work but that is how I see it. The best player of all? That's Lionel. Best player of last season? That's Virgil. We will see."</p>

      <p>Alongside Van Dijk, teammates Mohamed Salah, Alisson, Georginio Wijnaldum, Roberto Firmino, Sadio Mané and Trent Alexander-Arnold were all nominated for the award, but Klopp seemingly believes that Van Dijk should be the man to take home the prize.</p>
      <p>However, Messi is expected to be a serious contender for the Ballon d'Or, just as he is every year. The legendary <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/barca">​Barcelona</a> star notched 51 goals and 22 assists in just 50 games, steering his side to <a href="https://www.90min.com/leagues/la-liga">​La Liga</a> glory.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/juve">​Juventus</a> forward <a href="https://www.90min.com/players/cristiano-ronaldo">​Cristiano Ronaldo</a> is also believed to be in the race for the award thanks to his tallies of 28 goals and ten assists, so Van Dijk certainly has some real competition to contest with.</p>
      <p>The Liverpool defender missed out on The Best FIFA Men's Player award to Messi back in September, so will be hopeful of going one step further this time.</p>
