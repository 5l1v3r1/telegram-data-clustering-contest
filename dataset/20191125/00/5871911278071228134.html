      <h1>Dez Bryant throws shade at Jason Garrett in Cowboys loss</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:55:18+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 00:55</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thesportsdaily.com/author/tsd-staff/" target="_blank">TSD Staff</a></address>
      <p>The Cowboys lost yet another close game on Sunday, this time against the Patriots, and it didn’t take long for those in the football world to weigh in about it.</p>
      <p>Dallas’ defense played well, and the team was competitive from start to finish, with the Patriots never being able to extend their lead past one score — aside from a four-minute stretch in the second quarter, when it was a 10-point margin. As such, head coach Jason Garrett began falling in love with field goals, perhaps to a fault, even. That prompted criticism from fans and media members alike.</p>
      <p>A former Cowboys player who knows Garett well also elected to share his thoughts. Dez Bryant took to Twitter during the game, and that’s when he posted the following message.</p>

      <p>Here’s the thing: That tweet was posted late in the game, just after Garrett was ripped for kicking a field goal with six minutes left, and his team in the red zone. Garrett chose to kick, rather than going for it on 4th-and-7, and it hurt the team, as the offense failed to score a point after that time.</p>
      <p>As such, it sure looks like Dez was throwing some shade at his former coach there in talking about “better coaches and game plan,” but you can judge for yourself.</p>
