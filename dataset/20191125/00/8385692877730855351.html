      <p>Getting a babysitter for the first time is great. But it's also nauseatingly scary. As any new parent will know, it's almost inconceivable that you could entrust another person with your child, even when the prize is an evening of blissful freedom.</p>
      <p>Fortunately, we've just discovered a way to make this momentous step a little bit easier to take. Like all the innovations that make our lives easier these days, it comes in the form of a smartphone <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/android-app-game-news">app</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nannyhunt.com/">NannyHunt</a>, from developer Kristin Nevin, is kind of like LinkedIn for parents and childcare professionals. It harnesses the power of social media to provide reliable, user-rated babysitting services recommended by your friends and acquaintances.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>The app puts every conceivable type of childcare within easy reach. If you're looking for a nanny to look after your kids while you're out at work, they're on NannyHunt. If you just need a sitter to watch your children for an evening at short notice, NannyHunt is the place to find them.</p>
      <p>And get this: it works like Uber, in that you can pay via the app, eliminating the need for socially awkward cash transactions.</p>
      <p>Sitters and nannies can be searched for by location, and things like their distance, rating, and other crucial data points are conveniently displayed within the app. You can see every prospective nanny's work history, too, plus the ratings of every parent who has rated them, giving you total transparency.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>NannyHunt is a powerful tool for nannies, too. Registering is super-easy, and once you're up and running the app is a reliable source of work from trustworthy, rated employers. There's even a chat function, so that parents and nannies can get to know one another before a job starts.</p>
      <p>So if you're a parent or a nanny, NannyHunt can only make your life better.
