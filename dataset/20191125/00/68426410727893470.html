      <p>Good morning,</p>
      <p>From Uyghur detentions to Huawei, these China developments are making news:</p>
      <p><b>Secret documents reveal how China’s mass detention camps work</b>, including a series of surveillance measures to “prevent escapes” by Uyghurs and other minorities, most of whom are Muslim. <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-secret-documents-reveal-how-china-mass-detention-camps-work-2/">The directives</a> also outlined a strategy to rewire the thoughts of detainees and the language they speak. Experts say the new leaks “confirm that this is a form of cultural genocide.”</p>
      <p><b>Canada’s new foreign minister raised the case of two detained Canadians</b> during a meeting with his Chinese counterpart at a G20 summit. François-Philippe Champagne <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-new-foreign-minister-presses-for-canadian-detainees-with-china/">said he expressed</a> “deep concern” about China’s detentions of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, who have been jailed in apparent retaliation for Canada’s arrest of Huawei’s Meng Wanzhou.</p>
      <p><b>U.S. issues warning to Canada on Huawei: </b>U.S. national security adviser <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-canada-shouldnt-use-huawei-5g-technology-us-national-security/">Robert O’Brien said</a> granting Huawei access to 5G networks would allow China to “know every health record, every banking record, every social media post; they’re going to know everything about every single Canadian.”</p>
      <p><b>In Hong Kong’s local elections,</b> pro-democracy candidates picked up a <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-record-turnout-for-hong-kong-council-elections-amid-calls-for-full/">majority of seats</a> in a rebuke of the pro-Beijing establishment following months of street protests. Democrats secured 390 of 452 seats, way up from around 100 seats four years ago.</p>

        <b>Charles Schwab to buy TD Ameritrade in $26-billion deal</b>
      </p>
      <p>Charles Schwab Corp said on Monday it would <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-charles-schwab-to-buy-td-ameritrade-in-26-billion-deal/">acquire TD Ameritrade Holding Corp</a>. in an all-stock deal valued at US$26-billion, combining the two largest U.S. discount brokerages. As part of the deal, which is expected to close in the second half of 2020, Ameritrade stockholders will get 1.0837 Schwab shares for every share held.</p>
      <p>Toronto-Dominion Bank owns 43 per cent of TD Ameritrade and is <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-td-ceo-bharat-masrani-knows-when-to-hold-or-fold-when-the-stakes-are/">expected to support the sale</a>. Analysts project TD Bank will emerge from the transaction with a 10-per-cent to 15-per-cent stake in a merged company that dominates the do-it-yourself financial-services space.</p>
      <p>A deal between the two companies could be seen as a response to recent disruption in the industry, where nimbler startups are rapidly gaining market share by eliminating commissions on stock trades.</p>
      <p>Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade combined would have assets of around US$5-trillion, according to Reuters calculations.</p>

        <b>More Canadian teens are overdosing on easy-to-access medications, data show</b>
      </p>
      <p>Youth overdoses linked to over-the-counter meds such as Tylenol and prescription drugs including antidepressants <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-canadian-teens-overdoses-painkillers-antidepressants-data/">have doubled</a> in Ontario and Alberta in less than a decade.</p>
      <p>Data from the Canadian Institute Health Information echo the findings of a new Ontario study that found acetaminophen, known by its brand name Tylenol, was the most commonly used drug in intentional youth overdoses.</p>
      <p>Some experts are calling for Health Canada to make higher doses of acetaminophen available only by prescription, and to limit the number of pills that can be sold at one time.</p>
      <p>While nearly all teenagers who go to the emergency department for an intentional overdose survive, <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-ontario-teens-who-visit-er-for-self-harm-treatment-at-increased-risk/">research suggests</a> that they are at a higher risk for suicide and accidental death in the future.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The Federal Court will begin hearing a First Nations child welfare case today</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ottawa is in court <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-federal-court-hearing-begins-on-government-request-to-stay-orders-from/">requesting a stay</a> of proceedings on a Canadian Human Rights Tribunal decision to order compensation for First Nations children who were unnecessarily taken into care because of a lack of on-reserve services.</p>
      <p><b>The background: </b>The Trudeau government faced criticism just before the election writ dropped over its decision to head to court rather than agree to compensation of up to $40,000 each – a figure a government official said could add up to a $7.9-billion payout. Ottawa wants a review of the tribunal ruling, but has said it agrees there should be some form of compensation.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Prairie farmers are feeling the impact as the CN strike continues</b>
      </p>
      <p>The strike, which comes amid peak season for grain prices, is adding <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/alberta/article-cn-rail-strike-just-the-latest-blow-for-prairie-farmers-in-difficult/">another layer of frustration</a> for farmers already hurt by China’s trade restrictions on Canadian canola. Importers could soon make alternative arrangements if Canadian producers are unable to get their products to foreign markets.</p>
      <p>The federal government is facing <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-calls-for-back-to-work-legislation-to-end-cn-strike-intensify-as/">growing calls</a> to legislate striking employees back to work, with representatives in the mining and chemistry industries warning of impacts on business and Quebec’s Premier sounding the alarm about a fuel shortage. Ottawa has reiterated its support for CN and its workers to reach an agreement through collective bargaining.</p>
      <p><b>In a column</b>, <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-the-cn-strike-and-our-ensuing-winter-of-discontent/">Melanie Paradis</a> of the McMillan Vantage Policy Group lays out the sweeping ramifications for Canadians – and the federal government – should the strike drag on: “Whether you work in a Mississauga engineering firm, the stockroom of an IKEA in Coquitlam, B.C. or a used car lot in Moncton, your job depends on the steady and reliable flow of products from coast to coast.”</p>

      <p>The Bombers ended the longest active championship drought in the CFL with their 33-12 thumping of the Hamilton Tiger-Cats in the 107th Grey Cup.</p>
      <p>As <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/football/article-grey-cup-blue-bombers-tiger-cats-cfl/">Rachel Brady reports</a> from Grey Cup host city Calgary, the win against the top-seeded Ticats capped a Cinderella run for the Bombers, who finished the regular season ranked third in the West.</p>
      <p>Over the weekend, <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/football/article-the-grey-cup-and-the-gridiron-of-the-mind/">Ian Brown examined</a> the nostalgia for the Canadian game that fewer and fewer people watch.</p>

      <p>The western side was gloriously decorated in graffiti, the eastern side remained blank grey. Even before official demolition, people were keen to grab a souvenir of the Berlin Wall. The dismantling started in the summer of 1990 and would yield tonnes of rubble and sections that were bought or donated to institutions around the world. Some even went on tour, such as the 2.5 tonne segment captured in this photo by John McNeill for The Globe as it was unloaded in Toronto for display at the Canadian National Exhibition. Today, pieces of the wall are still on sale, a small section still stands in Berlin and visitors can find segments in any number of places, from the War Museum in Ottawa to the Vatican City or even in a men’s bathroom in a Las Vegas casino. – <i>Alison Gzowski</i></p>
