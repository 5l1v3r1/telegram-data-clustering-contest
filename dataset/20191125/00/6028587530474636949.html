      <h1>Renogy PHOENIX 100 Review: A $160 Mini Power Station With An AC Outlet</h1>

      <p>I’ve reviewed a number of portable power stations recently. These things are popular and with good reason — power outages are becoming a fact of life in some parts of the country, and having a power station in your home means being able to keep your smartphone going for a week or more. Small portables are great for travel and keeping all your gadgets topped up, while some of the larger ones have AC outlets, allowing you to plug in small household appliances and PCs. The <a href="https://www.renogy.com/phoenix-100-mini-power-station/">PHOENIX 100 Mini Power Station</a> from Renogy occupies a middle ground. It’s not overly large (weighing just over a pound), but has 27000 mAh capacity — the maximum allowed on flights by the FAA. And despite the compact size and a $159.99 price tag, the PHOENIX 100 has a 110V electrical outlet.</p>

        <b>Power for Everything</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Renogy PHOENIX 100 is equipped with an array of power output ports: USB-A, USB-C and a 110V AC outlet (which is equipped with a cover to keep debris out). You can recharge multiple devices at the same time, but the USB-C port has a maximum 15W output so you can’t use it to directly power a laptop. However, you <i>can</i> plug the laptop’s charger into the AC outlet, making this mini power station much more flexible than most power banks in its price range. Under low power draw it uses passive cooling, but under load its fan can come on.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>There is both Micro-USB and USB-C charging for the PHOENIX 100’s battery. I tried Micro-USB at first, but it was sloooow... After six hours it was still showing only three of five LED lights. The next time I used USB-C and and an iPad charger, and it was much faster — around four hours or so from empty.</p>
      <p>The upright form factor combined with cables plugged into the top can be a little awkward when on an uneven surface, and that shape (as opposed to being flat) means it may be a little more of challenge to pack it in a backpack pocket. Renogy includes a handy storage case with pockets that include Micro USB and USB-C cables and it’s equipped with a handle, so you could clip it to a backpack easily enough. Its 27,000 mAh capacity means you are allowed to bring the PHOENIX 100 on a flight to keep your gadgets charged.</p>

        <b>How Much Can It Charge?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 27000 mAh battery in the PHOENIX 100 is as big as it get for power banks that can be carried on an airplane. That’s a lot of capacity — enough to recharge an iPhone XR nine times. Plug a laptop into the AC outlet and you should be able to charge it several times. </p>

      </figure>
      <p>When I evaluate the larger power stations that come with AC outlets, I typically plug in a small refrigerator or a 27-inch iMac. In this case it was more realistic to go with something a little less power-demanding. I plugged in a 14-inch table fan and used it at its low setting. The PHOENIX 100 was able to keep it running for over two and a half hours. That’s not bad for a battery pack that’s not much larger than a soda can. </p>
      <p>In an emergency situation (or camping) this mini power station has the battery capacity to charge your smartphone multiple times, keep LED lights going for days or keep you entertained with gaming on a Nintendo Switch for an additional six hours once the portable console’s battery is depleted.</p>

        <b>Recommendation</b>
      </p>
      <p>The rectangular block shape of the <a href="https://www.renogy.com/phoenix-100-mini-power-station/">Renogy PHOENIX 100</a> makes it a little less convenient to stow than other portable power stations — although the included carrying case does help to make up for this. The combination of 27000 mAh capacity, a 110V AC outlet and the $160 price make it a pretty compelling option, able to deliver the maximum portable power allowed on a flight while doing double-duty with a few hours worth of emergency 110V AC power. </p>
      <p>Disclosure: Renogy provided a PHOENIX 100 for evaluation but had no input into this review.</p>
