        <b>ANALYSIS/OPINION:</b>
      </p>
      <p>U.S. Navy Secretary <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/richard-spencer/">Richard Spencer</a> chose poorly when he decided to argue with the commander in chief about Navy SEAL Eddie Gallagher. He chose to punish a decorated warfighter for taking a picture that thousands of in-theater vets and news photographers have taken in every war; and he chose to cross swords with the president and the secretary of Defense.</p>
      <p>Given his political correctness, Mr. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/richard-spencer/">Spencer</a> has now witnessed the future. The Stalinist progressives have met a brick wall, with their agenda to remake America coming to a grinding halt. The coup to bring down the U.S. government has been stopped, but fortunately not before the discovery of all of the co-conspirators who will need to be punished.</p>
      <p>It’s a simple rule, really; you don’t argue with the commander in chief, period. You may volunteer to retire or you may choose walk into the ocean, but you never, ever argue with No.1 If you do, you forfeit your career. Mr. Gallagher was acquitted and Mr. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/richard-spencer/">Spencer</a> was left with a single photo. That’s all. The obvious answer was to simply take away some rank and then move on. But no — Mr. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/richard-spencer/">Spencer</a> had to be the toughest guy in town. Well, he was wrong and things turned out fine for the United States. We have our warfighter back and now there is a loathsome political lemming that has brought shame to himself simply by making a poor choice and hooking his horse to the wagon of James Comey, John Brennan and James Clapper.</p>
