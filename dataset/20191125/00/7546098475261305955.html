      <h1>CIMIC Group shares fall despite new contract</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:50:37+00:00">25 Nov 2019, 00:50</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fool.com.au/author/kennethhallau/" target="_blank">Kenneth Hall</a></address>
      <p><b>CIMIC Group Ltd </b><a href="https://www.fool.com.au/tickers/ASX-CIM/">(ASX: CIM)</a> shares have fallen lower this morning despite a new contract announcement from the construction group.</p>
      <h3>What did CIMIC announce this morning?</h3>
      <p>CIMIC’s subsidiary, CPB Contractors, has been selected as the preferred contractor for part of Perth’s METRONET program.</p>
      <p>CPB will deliver the Yanchep Rail Extension and the Thornlie to Cockburn Link as part of the program.</p>
      <p>The contract will be delivered in partnership with <b>Downer EDI Limited </b><a href="https://www.fool.com.au/tickers/ASX-DOW/">(ASX: DOW)</a>. Interestingly, the Downer share price has edged higher on the news this morning while the CIMIC shares are sinking lower.</p>
      <p>The alliance-style contract is funded by the Western Australian and Australian governments. CIMIC has said revenue to CPB Contractors will be confirmed at contract execution.</p>
      <p>Works on this component of the METRONET project will commence in 2019 and are scheduled for completion in 2023.</p>
      <p>CPB Contractors is currently also working on several major rail projects across Australia. These include Melbourne’s Metro Tunnel, the Sydney Metro, Brisbane’s Cross River Rail and the Parramatta Light Rail.</p>
      <p>At the time of writing, CIMIC shares are down 0.12% at $32.75 per share in morning trade.</p>
      <h3>How have CIMIC shares performed in 2019?</h3>
      <p>It’s been somewhat of a disappointing year for shareholders, with CIMIC shares sinking lower in 2019.</p>
      <p>CIMIC shares are down 23.64% since the start of January, which is disappointing in any year. However, the strong performance from the <b>S&amp;P/ASX 200 Index </b>(INDEXASX: XJO) compounds the poor performance.</p>
      <p>The benchmark Aussie index is up more than 20% this year after hitting a new record high earlier this year.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, CIMIC shares have continued to slump lower after <a href="https://www.fool.com.au/2019/11/04/why-are-cimic-shares-down-35-from-julys-peak/">hitting more than $50 per share back in July</a>.</p>
      <p>The company boasts a market cap of $10.6 billion, which puts it firmly inside the ASX 50 and blue-chip territory. CIMIC’s 4.79% dividend yield is also nothing to be sneezed at in the low-yield environment right now.</p>
      <p>However, investors haven’t been convinced by this morning’s contract announcement and I’d be watching CIMIC shares closely ahead of its next results release.</p>
