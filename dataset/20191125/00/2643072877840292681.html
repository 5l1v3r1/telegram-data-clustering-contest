      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">George Ogbolu</a></address>
      <p>President <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/23/president-buhari-storms-out-of-apc-nec-meeting/"><u><b>Muhammadu Buhari</b></u></a> and the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) are against democracy in Nigeria, the <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/24/kogi-frustrated-dino-melaye-will-lose-again-apc-tells-pdp/"><u><b>Peoples Democratic Party (PDP)</b></u></a> has said.</p>
      <p>In a statement on Sunday signed by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, the PDP said the Chairman of the <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/19/tinubu-reacts-as-inec-declares-kogi-bayelsa-election-winners/"><u><b>Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC)</b></u></a> Mahmood Yakubu was the “worst electoral umpire” in the political history of Nigeria.</p>
      <p>The main opposition party claimed that Nigerians have lost faith in the nation’s electoral process under the administration of President Buhari.</p>
      <p>The party said the present administration have reduced security agents to tools of election brutality to rig in their favour.</p>
      <p>The statement reads: <i>“For us in the PDP and, we believe, to the majority of Nigerians as well, Professor Yakubu is the worst electoral umpire in the political history of our nation.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“Furthermore, the police and the military high commands have been reduced to tools of election brutality to ensure that votes do not count.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“Even the Police high command has openly admitted that the police are incapable of protecting voters and votes; thus validating the reported involvement of security agents in the brutalization of voters and disruption of the electoral process.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“More distressing is the fact that Nigerians, particularly our members and supporters in Kogi and Bayelsa states, are still in trauma over the murderous November 16 elections.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“A lot of our people have been killed and our members are still grieving.”</i>
