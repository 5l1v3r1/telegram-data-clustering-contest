      <p>After the release of the first <a href="https://www.glitched.africa/new-cs-go-operation-shattered-web-released-by-valve/">CS: GO Operation</a> in more than two years, Valve isn’t slowing down when it comes to improving the game and its maps. The latest CS: GO update introduces Storage Units, which store up to 1,000 Inventory items each which would otherwise exceed inventory limit.</p>

For those enjoying the new Shattered Web Operation, Valve has also added a countdown to see when new Operation missions become available.</p>
