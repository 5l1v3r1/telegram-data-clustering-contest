      <p>Toronto police say they are investigating two incidents of feces being thrown at students in university libraries in recent days.</p>
      <p>Const. Allyson Douglas-Cook says officers are investigating a link between similar incidents at the University of Toronto and York University.</p>
      <p>She says one incident occurred at the Robarts Library at U of T on Friday afternoon, while another took place Sunday afternoon at York University’s Scott Library.</p>
      <p>Douglas-Cook says detectives are looking to determine if the same suspect is responsible for both incidents.</p>
      <p>She says assault charges could be laid.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for York University confirmed that an “unknown male” entered the library around 5 p.m. Sunday and “deposited a substance, suspected of containing fecal matter, on a student.”</p>
      <p>“We have reached out to the victim of the assault to offer support,” Yanni Dagonas said in an email.</p>
      <p>The school has launched its own investigation and is also working with Toronto police, Dagonas said.</p>
      <p>U of T also said it’s supporting the Toronto police probe.</p>
      <p>“As a public university we work to make the resources of our libraries as open as possible,” the university said in a statement.</p>
      <p>“What happened was shocking and assistance was provided to those affected.”</p>
