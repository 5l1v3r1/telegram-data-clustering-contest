      <h1>Acast Open launches to give brands an on-ramp to podcasting</h1>
      <h2>The company is offering three different subscription levels, including a free "Starter" subscription.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-25T00:00:00+00:00">25 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Amy Gesenhues</a></address>
      <p>The podcasting platform Acast has launched <a href="https://medium.com/acast/open-to-everyone-c07d37cfe31c">Acast Open</a>, making available its podcast production offerings to any brand or publisher wanting to start a podcast. Acast Open includes three subscription models — Starter, Influencer and Ace — that come with different levels of support and analytics.</p>
      <h3>Why we should care</h3>
      <p>Adobe Analytics reported that <a href="https://marketingland.com/podcast-listening-growth-continues-mobile-app-usage-up-60-since-january-2018-study-finds-265608">podcast app usage grew 60% over the past year</a>. Not only does this translate to new <a href="https://marketingland.com/your-quick-start-guide-to-podcast-advertising-264662">advertising opportunities</a> for brands — the increase in podcast popularity opens the door for any company or executive ready to take their content marketing to a new level via a branded podcast.</p>
      <p>“Digital audio brings a new and untapped audience who are not reachable via traditional media,” says Sally Yu, director of research and insights for BBC Global News’ APAC division, during <a href="https://www.campaignasia.com/article/bbc-global-news-report-reveals-the-persuasive-power-of-branded-podcasts/455434">a recent event organized</a> by BBC News and Campaign Asia, “It brings additive value to the traditional media reach.” Outside of music streaming, the top three forms of audio content consumed right now are music (67%), news (50%) and podcasts (37%), according to a study commissioned by BBC News that focused on the commercial opportunities of branded podcasts.</p>
      <p>If your brand — or CEO — has value to add to a larger industry conversation, a branded podcast may be the piece of content marketing that sets you apart from your competition and helps you reach a whole new audience. Platforms like Acast and <a href="https://marketingland.com/spotifys-rumored-create-a-podcast-feature-could-be-a-valuable-resource-for-marketers-266413">Spotify’s “create a podcast” app</a> aim to make it easier for brands to join the ever-growing list of podcasters.</p>
