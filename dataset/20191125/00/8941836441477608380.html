      <p>SUN PRAIRIE, Wis. (AP) - The Sun Prairie Area School District is investigating a student who wore blackface at a girls basketball game.</p>
      <p>The district said in a statement Monday that the student attended the game on Saturday. The student wasn’t wearing blackface when he entered but apparently applied it during the game to his entire face and posted a photo of himself wearing it on social media. He removed the paint after his peers intervened.</p>
      <p>The district noted that it prohibits anything deemed to be disruptive, provocative or intimidating during the school day or at school events, including identity-obstructive masks, full face paint and any materials worn over the face.</p>
