      <h2>US expert cites the Belt &amp; Road initiative as actions taken by China to back up its commitment to multilateralism</h2>

      <p>China’s strong commitment to multilateralism is vital to the stability, security and healthy development of the entire world being threatened by an upsurge of unilateralism and protectionism, a leading US expert on China has said.</p>
      <p>“I am struck by the breadth and scope of China’s engagement with the world. There is now no matter of global importance in which China does not participate,” said Robert Lawrence Kuhn, chairman of the Kuhn Foundation, in a recent interview with Xinhua.</p>
      <p>Noting that China needs a “stable international environment to enable its domestic development,” the expert said the Asian nation has also recognized and shouldered its global responsibilities as a major country to make this world a better place.</p>
      <p>Speaking at the UN Office at Geneva in 2017, Chinese President Xi Jinping said that China will continue to pursue a win-win strategy of opening-up, share development opportunities with other countries and welcome them aboard the fast train of China’s development, the report said.</p>
      <p>Among all the actions taken by China to back up its commitment to multilateralism, Kuhn cited the Belt and Road Initiative as a fine example, adding that China’s expertise and experience in infrastructure construction is what the developing world needs to spur their economies.</p>
      <p>“China’s Belt and Road Initiative expands links between Asia, Africa and Europe and thus reduces imbalances in national development and promotes economic growth,” he said.</p>
      <p>“It is crucial for the developing world’s economy, and thus it is vital for the peace and prosperity of the entire world,” he added.</p>
      <p>Proposed in 2013, the BRI aims to build trade and infrastructure networks connecting Asia with Europe and Africa on and beyond the ancient Silk Road routes. It comprises the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road.</p>
      <p>So far, the BRI has become a platform of opportunities and a road to prosperity for all its participants. China has signed cooperation documents with more than 160 countries and international organizations.</p>
