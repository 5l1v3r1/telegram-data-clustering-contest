      <p>It is not a secret for anyone that <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/real-madrid">Real Madrid</a> have thought on more than one occasion about the possibility of signing Mauricio Pochettino as coach.

      <p>The arrival of the ex-Spurs coach to <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/bayern-munchen/">Bayern Munich</a> as also been talked about. <b>Bayern are now managed by Hans-Dieter Flick</b> after the sacking of Niko Kovac as coach. </p>
      <p>But in reach hours, <b>a new rumour has started to link the 47 year-old coach</b> with Arsenal. Specifically, it's 'The Sun' who are speaking of the possible arrival of Pochettino<b> because of the poor results Unai Emery has been getting. </b></p>
