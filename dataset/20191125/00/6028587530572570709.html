      <p>A ten-year boy has just been charged as a sex offender as a result of a schoolyard game of tag that got out of control. As <a href="https://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2019/11/22/10-year-old-boy-charged-sex-offense-marbury-maryland-school/">reported by the local CBS news affiliate</a>: “the fourth-grade students were playing a game of tag that escalated when a boy began making inappropriate comments and movements toward the girls. One of the boys also wrapped his arms around one of the girls.”Obviously, this incident should not be dismissed as a “boys will be boys” prank. The comments were very sexually aggressive. The boys should be disciplined, and, even more importantly, taught the error of their ways. But charging a 10-year-old as a sex offender is a devastating, merciless response. The boy has been charged with a fourth-degree sexual offense. Even if he avoids prison time, under Maryland law someone convicted with a fourth-degree sexual offense will be put on a sexual offender registry for fifteen years. This casts serious doubt on whether he will ever go to college or find gainful employment.</p>
      <p>This sort of devastatingly punitive treatment of children is not an anomaly and it destroys the lives of girls and boys alike. <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/03/14/when-kids-are-accused-of-sex-crimes">Writing in <i>The New Yorker</i>,</a> Sarah Stillman tells the story of 10-year-old Charla Roberts: “In Charla Roberts’s living room, not far from Paris, Texas, I learned how, at the age of ten, Roberts had pulled down the pants of a male classmate at her public elementary school. She was prosecuted for ‘indecency with a child,’ and added to the state’s online offender database for the next ten years. The terms of her probation barred her from leaving her mother’s house after six in the evening, leaving the county, or living in proximity to ‘minor children,’ which ruled out most apartments. When I spoke to the victim, he was shocked to learn of Roberts’s fate. He described the playground offense as an act of “public humiliation, instead of a sexual act”—a hurtful prank, but hardly a sex crime. Roberts can still be found on a commercial database online, her photo featured below a banner that reads, “<i>protect your child from sex offenders</i>.”</p>
      <p>As Stillman documents, some of the measures taken against these young people by the government are themselves borderline sex abuse. She tells the story of a young man who, at the age of 18, had a brief consensual sexual relationship with a girl three years his junior. As a result of his sex offender conviction, he has to undergo incredibly sexually intrusive and humiliating procedures for the next decade: “He would also have to submit to a ‘penile plethysmograph,’ or PPG. According to documents produced by the state of Texas, the PPG—known jokingly to some patients as a ‘peter meter’—is ‘a sophisticated computerized instrument capable of measuring slight changes in the circumference of the penis.’ A gauge is wrapped around the shaft of the penis, with wires hooked up to a laptop, while a client is presented with ‘sexually inappropriate’ imagery and, often, ‘deviant’ sexual audio. [He] would be billed around two hundred dollars per test.</p>
      <p>This highly punitive approach to punishing even very young minors is not limited to sex crimes. This past summer,<a href="https://pittsburgh.cbslocal.com/2019/07/30/10-year-old-aggravated-assault-dodgeball/"> a 10-year-old Michigan boy was charged with aggravated assault</a> for throwing a ball at the head of another boy in a schoolyard game similar to dodgeball. Aggravated assault is a felony that can result in a lengthy prison term. It is usually reserved for cases that go well beyond a simple blow to another person, such as the use of a deadly weapon or <a href="https://legaldictionary.net/aggravated-assault/#ftoc-heading-15">“assault with the intent to commit another felony crime such as robbery or rape.”</a> Apparently, the authorities believed this was aggravated assault because it resulted in a concussion. Concussions are nothing to laugh at, but they occur in sports all the time. To charge a 10-year-old boy with such a serious crime for a dodgeball infraction is insanely disproportionate.</p>
      <p>As I have written about many times, American society has become far too punitive. The trend toward ever-greater punitive measures has continued through both Republican and Democratic administrations, with Presidents Reagan and Clinton both signing major crime bills pumping up mass incarceration. Because sex offenses are seen as disproportionately affecting women and girls (<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/evangerstmann/2019/07/15/women-sexually-assault-men-far-more-often-than-you-think/#62fd4d7276ad">although that might be less true than people think</a>) progressives can sound a lot like law and order Republicans when it comes to such crimes. In addition, concern over everything from schoolyard bullying to school shootings has created an atmosphere of panic over student safety. All these forces have combined to create an atmosphere of punitive mercilessness even towards 10-year-old’s. These are children who need to be educated, not felons to be severely punished.</p>
