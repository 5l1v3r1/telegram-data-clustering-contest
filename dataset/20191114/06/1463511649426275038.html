      <h1>Nigeria expecting $400m Abacha loot from US, compensation on Malabu case — ICPC</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T06:17:02+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 06:17</time> by <a rel="author">The Eagle Online</a></address>
      <p>The Chairman of the Independent Corrupt Practices and other related offences Commission, Prof Bolaji Owasanoye, has said that Nigeria is expecting the return of $400 million hidden in the United States of America by former Head of State, late General Sani Abacha, and a compensation on the disputed Malabu Oil case.</p>
      <p>Owasanoye disclosed this on Wednesday in a keynote address in Lagos at the 42nd Annual Conference of the Nigerian Society of International Law.</p>
      <p>The theme of the three-day event is: “Is International law at a cross-road?”</p>
      <p>Owasanoye said securing the return of looted funds is not easy because of legal hurdles and huge financial implications.</p>
      <p>He said the Abacha loot is hidden in over 12 countries, each with different legal requirements on asset return.</p>
      <p>Owansanoye said international legal instruments empower Nigeria to demand the return of its stolen assets.</p>
      <p>He said: “Nigeria is presently awaiting the return of about $400 million from in the US, which is part of Abacha loot.</p>
      <p>“We have $322 million returned from Switzerland two years ago as part of the Abacha loot, which is been used for the conditional cash transfer.</p>
      <p>“We also recovered $73 million from the UK, which was abandoned in England as part of proceeds from Malabu oil transaction.”</p>
      <p>Owasanoye said some countries are reluctant to return assets because of what they benefit from it.</p>
      <p>For instance, he said the $73 million the UK returned was short of $12 million, which the country said was withheld as administrative costs.</p>
      <p>On the Malabu case, Owasanoye said: “Nigeria is an interested party in that case and is asking for compensation for the corruption that was inflicted on the country by the illegal award of that licence.”</p>
