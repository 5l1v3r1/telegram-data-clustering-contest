      <p>If you’ve kept up with the rest of the internet lately, you’ve probably heard about WeWork. The company has struggled to create a sustainable business model and failed to go public, with its most recent debacle being a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/13/wework-q3-2019-earnings-lost-1point25-billion-on-934-million-in-revenue.html">loss of over $1 billion</a> in the third quarter of the year.</p>
      <p>Going public might not be in WeWork’s future, but SoftBank did make a heavy investment in the company and has a short list of new potential CEOs for the office-sharing company. You might recognize <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/215404-softbank-selecting-brightstars-marcelo-claure-as-new-sprint-ceo/">SoftBank</a> as the current major owners of Sprint, and you might recognize John Legere on that shortlist as<a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/306897-t-mobile-ceo-john-legere-stars-in-an-un-carrier-christmas-carol/"> T-Mobile’s current CE</a>O. What a small world.</p>
      <p>Legere isn’t definitely going to be the next CEO, but he is on the list that SoftBank is looking at. They want a high-profile, high-energy CEO to turn the company around, especially after a rocky few months. After taking over T-Mobile, Legere has certainly done an excellent job of building T-Mobile up into an incredibly competitive wireless carrier after lagging behind for so many years. He’d fit the bill.</p>
      <p>But he’s also in charge of T-Mobile, the company that’s currently in the middle of one of the <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/335691-t-mobile-and-sprint-get-the-green-light-to-merge-as-long-as-they-dont-use-anything-from-huawei/">biggest mergers ever</a> in the wireless industry. With SoftBank looking to have a new CEO start in January, it would look <i>terrible </i>for Legere to dip out right after most of the <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/345354-fcc-approves-sprint-t-mobile-merger/">approval process</a> has finished for the Sprint/T-Mobile acquisition. That’s not a great look on a resume, and it might give both parties pause about actually wanting that merger.</p>
      <p>Take it all with a grain of salt, but we might have a very interesting end to 2019.</p>
