      <p><a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Ekta-Kapoor">Ekta Kapoor</a> is celebrating her son, Ravie Kapoor’s first Children’s Day and the filmmaker posted an adorable video of her kid with his grandfather Jeetendra. Ekta has never showed her toddler’s face in all the pictures and videos she posts and this time too the kiddo was a part of the frame but the clip was taken from behind. <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Jeetendra">Jeetendra</a> held Ravie Kapoor in his arms while the kid tried to pull his mother’s hair and this fun video made for an adorable Children’s Day memory.</p>

      <p>Interestingly, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Neena-Gupta">Neena Gupta</a> asked Ekta to show her son’s face and commented on the post, “Dikha do na shakal” which evoked a hilarious response from Ekta who replied, “neena_gupta maaam meri maa mjhe ghar se nikal degi.” Neetu Kapoor too dropped hearts and kisses on the adorable click. Ekta had announced the arrival of her son through <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/surrogacy">surrogacy</a> in January this year.</p>
