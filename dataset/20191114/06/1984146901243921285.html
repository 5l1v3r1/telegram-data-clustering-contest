      <h1>New jobs on the way as 24/7 gym prepares to open in Whitley Bay town centre</h1>
      <h2>Snap Fitness will open a club on Park Avenue, in Whitley Bay, in December, at a site previously occupied by a McColl’s store</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T06:00:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Sonia Sharma</a></address>
      <p>A new 24/7 gym is preparing to open its doors in a town centre, creating around 10 jobs.</p>
      <p>Snap Fitness is setting up a base on Park Avenue, in <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/whitley-bay">Whitley Bay</a>, and is scheduled to open in December.</p>
      <p>The site was previously home to a McColl’s store and a post office. They both closed towards the end of 2017, though the post office later re-opened nearby on Whitley Road.</p>
      <p>Now, work is under way to turn the Park Avenue premises into a fitness club.</p>
      <p>The 8,000sqm facility will include a range of equipment from Matrix Fitness including cardio machines, a training area with a sled track, battle ropes, core bags and plyo boxes, as well as a weights area with dumbbells from 2kg to 50kg.</p>
      <p>The club will have three group exercise studios including a dedicated spin section offering over a hundred classes for members to choose from. There will also be private changing facilities, with individual showers.</p>
      <p>Isaac Buchanan, CEO of Snap Fitness, said: "We're excited to be opening a new site here in Whitley Bay and to have the town as part of the growing Snap Fitness UK family.</p>
