      <p>Bengals coach Zac Taylor <a href="https://www.daytondailynews.com/sports/report-bengals-will-evaluating-colin-kaepernick-workout/GaAmxqWi39aiTEU8YdURMK/">did not wish to comment</a> on whether the team would have scouts there, but the <a href="https://www.cincinnati.com/story/sports/nfl/bengals/2019/11/13/colin-kaepernick-cincinnati-bengals-evaluate-qbs-nfl-workout/4180496002/">Enquirer</a> reported Wednesday afternoon that sources confirmed Cincinnati will be looking at how Kaepernick performs during the workout.</p>
      <p>“Our personnel staff does a great job evaluating everyone that’s on the (waiver) wire and available,” Taylor said when asked about the workout Wednesday. “I’d prefer not to announce where all our scouts are going.”</p>
      <p>The NFL is recording every part of the event, which includes an interview, measurements, timing and testing, as well as quarterback drills. The film will be available to all 32 teams.</p>
      <p>Kaepernick was a second-round pick of the San Francisco 49ers in 2011. He started 58 games for the 49ers in six seasons with 72 touchdown passes and 30 interceptions. Kaepernick led the 49ers to the playoffs in 2012 and 2013.</p>
      <p>Cincinnati is seeking a franchise quarterback after benching veteran Andy Dalton and replacing him with rookie fourth-round draft pick Ryan Finley. Kaepernick might not be the long-term solution but could at least be a short-term option for the organization, which still seeks its first win under Taylor.</p>
