      <h3>‘March past’ should be knocked into shape</h3>
      <p>The large gathering of caring folk of all ages for Victoria’s Remembrance Day tribute was a warming sight for those present and for us who now, sadly, must settle for television coverage.</p>
      <p>The organization of representatives was as laudable as ever, both for dignitaries in immaculate uniforms as well as others in civilian dress. The slightly undisciplined scramble to assemble wreaths at the memorial was, as always, a touching tribute and those involved should be complimented for the way they played their part.</p>
      <p>But then came what was billed as a “march past,” and sadly, this was nothing more than a shameful shambles that must have had our heroes turning in their graves. There was no pride nor discipline in that parade, because very few participants seemed to realize that they were supposed to march in step with each other, and instead settled for an uninspiring and uninspired shuffle that was more comical than regimental.</p>
      <p>I do hope that some sergeant major somewhere is given the job of knocking next year’s parade of marchers into shape (ahead of time), so they understand their role on the day.</p>

      <h3>Why mar ceremony with jarring gunfire?</h3>
      <p>Why does the beautiful and meaningful Remembrance Day ceremony held in front of the legislative buildings have to be punctuated so frequently by the jarring roar of gunfire? No doubt it’s on account of some time-honoured military tradition.</p>
      <p>But what is its impact on the local birds and wildlife, the pets people frequently bring to the ceremony, very young children and people who might be suffering from debilitating conditions such as PTSD and autism?</p>
      <p>Throughout my life, I have been given to understand Remembrance Day is to remind us of the great damage brought about by war (gunfire playing an enormous part), so that it will not be repeated. Why, then, so much gunfire at this ceremony?</p>

      <h3>Show of force was unnecessary</h3>
      <p>I was part of the large crowd that attended the parade and ceremony at the Sidney cenotaph on Monday. It was a very respectful group of families, old and young. It was encouraging for us who remember the ravages of war.</p>
      <p>What was not encouraging was the policeman who paced back and forth in front of us throughout the whole ceremony with his assault rifle held in front of him with both his hands — nine times in fact.</p>
      <p>He did not even stop his pacing for the singing of O Canada. Was this show of force necessary at an otherwise beautiful tribute to those people who gave so much so we can live in peace in Canada? It looked like we were preparing for an imminent attack.</p>

      <h3>Cherry only exercising free speech</h3>
      <p>I find it extremely ironic that Don Cherry was fired for exercising his right to freedom of speech at the same time we were commemorating our war veterans and our fallen heroes who fought to give us the right to exercise our freedoms, including the right to freedom of speech.</p>
      <p>If he is to land on his sword, possibly Ron McLean should go as well for his nod of the head and thumbs up in agreement.</p>

      <h3>Close herring fishery to restore Salish Sea</h3>
      <p>Re: “Groups call for closure of herring fishery in Strait of Georgia,” Nov. 5.</p>
      <p>The lack of Pacific herring in our marine ecosystems caused by decades of overfishing continues to have huge negative repercussions on the abundance of our wildlife.</p>
      <p>Among other things, it explains largely why there are so few birds — loons, grebes, ducks, etc. — along our coast today compared to the past.</p>
      <p>If we are serious about restoring the Salish Sea, we need a heck of a lot more herring.</p>
      <p>We need to rein in the herring fishery here as in other parts of the Pacific coast in Canada and the United States.</p>
      <p>We hope to see the First Nations of Vancouver Island take an active role in making this closure happen, as other First Nations have done elsewhere in British Columbia.</p>
