      <h1>Man, 46, has been sleeping rough in Colwick Woods for a year after relationship breakdown</h1>
      <h2>He tried living on city centre streets - but was getting beaten up and urinated on</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T06:00:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Jamie Barlow</a></address>
      <p>A 46-year-old man whose relationship broke down has explained why he has spent the last year sleeping rough in a makeshift 'hideout' deep in Colwick Woods.</p>
      <p>"I am deep in the woods so no-one can find me," said Nigel Hutchby. "It's all like brambles and tree ends and stuff like it where I have camouflaged myself.</p>
      <p>"To keep myself from the wet I have got all my stuff, it's all covered up."</p>
      <p>He explained he wore extra clothing to keep himself warm in bad weather and curled himself up into a ball.</p>
      <p>Mr Hutchby had worked for a recycling company and lived in <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/local-news/driver-fears-could-face-several-3529652">Eastwood</a>.</p>
      <p>But his downward spiral began when he spilt with his fiancée in February 2018.</p>
      <p>They were engaged for about 14 years, and after the breakup Mr Hutchby found himself on the streets, initially spending time in <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/local-news/driver-fears-could-face-several-3529652">Ilkeston</a>.</p>
      <p>Out of work, he relocated to Nottingham city centre - and said every day was different there.</p>
      <p>"When you can find a heater blowing out from a café or restaurant, you snuggle up to that heater to keep yourself warm," he said.</p>
      <p>He searched bins for food to stay alive and encountered problems before moving to the woods.</p>
      <p>"You get all these pickpocketers, I've had no end of phones go missing out my pockets.</p>

      <p>"I was in the city for a good month. But then I thought to myself 'fine, I'm getting beaten up and getting urinated on - enough's enough, I'll go a bit further'.</p>
      <p>"Now I'm out the way in Colwick. In the woods down near the race course.</p>
      <p>"It's quiet, it is very quiet which I enjoy.</p>
      <p>"It sounds daft, it wasn't sheltered. But now I've been breaking brambles off, it's more or less like a shelter. It's damp and cold."</p>
      <p>He described his shelter as a 'hideout'.</p>
      <p>After several months of being homeless, Mr Hutchby was told about the services offered by Emmanuel House, a support service based in Goose Gate. The charity offers a lifeline to people in tough situations.</p>
      <p>"The winter nights are here now, so of course they are getting warmer clothes in which has helped me out," he said.</p>
      <p>"It's hard on the streets but with Emmanuel House here it does not seem as hard."</p>
      <p>Mr Hutchby is hoping to find a job and he has been in touch with Housing Aid, a homelessness prevention and support service run by Nottingham City Council, in a bid to find private-rented accommodation.</p>
      <p>Councillor Linda Woodings, the city council's portfolio holder for panning and housing, said: "Homelessness and rough sleeping have sadly been on the increase in recent years and as a council we remain committed to providing support where it’s needed and prevention where it’s possible."</p>
      <p>Mr Hutchby spoke to Nottinghamshire Live on Wednesday (November 13) at the launch of a Christmas appeal for Emmanuel House called Think Christmas, Give Hope.</p>
      <p>Emmanuel House offers year-round support for homeless and vulnerable adults in Nottingham.</p>
      <p>The charity provides people with hot food and drinks. People can use shower and laundry facilities and receive mental health support.</p>
      <p>Denis Tully, chief executive of Emmanuel House, said: “In 2018/19, Emmanuel House specifically supported over 1,000 people alongside which there were over 20,000 visits to the centre.</p>
      <p>"We continue to explore new ways to engage people in our services, preventing people from becoming homeless in the first place and helping people confront the barriers that prevent them from moving from homelessness into resettlement.</p>

      <p>"It costs £10,000 a week to run our service and as we receive no statutory funding we are reliant on goodwill donations to provide the support and services to centre users. Of all the gifts you give this year, give the gift of hope.”</p>
      <p>Local musician Benje Howard, 33, of Beeston - <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/local-news/beeston-rapper-who-ran-gangs-1334506">known as Kingdom Rapper</a> - has written a track called Feed The Need, highlighting the homelessness crisis. Released next week, money raised will support Emmanuel House.</p>
      <p>A video for the song was released on Wednesday (November 13).</p>
      <p>Mr Howard said: "I do a lot of different projects like this. It's where my heart is.</p>
      <p>"I really feel like I get to meet with people, salt of the earth people, who are going through real things and making music around that and shining a light on society's issues. Having a chance to have a choice for those people is exactly why I would do something like this."</p>
      <p>Money, food and clothing can be donated to Emmanuel House in several ways.</p>
      <p>People can organise a collection and arrange for a cheque or cash to be brought to the centre.</p>
      <p>Money can also be transferred by bank transfer. The charity can provide the relevant details.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, money can be donated to a fundraising page by clicking <a href="https://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/charity-web/charity/displayCharityCampaignPage.action?charityCampaignUrl=thinkchristmasgivehope">here</a>.</p>
