      <p>Eric Hill’s charming Spot books have been transformed to the stage and are guaranteed to entertain child fans in the audience</p>
      <p>[three and half stars]</p>
      <p>Details: Arts Centre Melbourne, until 17 Nov.</p>
      <p>Reviewer: Andrew Fuhrmann</p>
      <p>Eric Hill’s iconic <i>Spot</i> books have all the ingredients necessary for a kiddie-pleasing preschoolers’ theatre show.</p>
      <p>The colours are bright. The stories are simple but engaging. And Spot – surely the world’s most famous puppy – is irresistibly cuddly.</p>
      <p>This show brings to life the classic <i>Spot Goes to the Farm</i>, first published in 1987. Spot and his blue hippopotamus friend visit a farm to meet the animals and help with chores.</p>
      <p>It’s produced by the same company that recently toured live versions of Julia Donaldson’s <i>Gruffalo</i> books and Andy Griffiths and Terry Denton’s <i>Treehouse</i> franchise.</p>
      <p>And they’ve done well to create puppets that are as eye-catching and adorable as Hill’s illustrations while also seeming wonderfully alive.</p>
      <p>Eric Hill pioneered lift-the-flap books and this show cleverly adapts the same idea. There are colourful surprises lurking under every surface of James Browne’s compact set.</p>
      <p>The three cast members are adept puppeteers and also vibrant personalities. Spot has plenty of song and dance and pantomime high jinks.</p>
      <p>Kailah Cabanas is wonderfully expressive as Helen the hippo. Enya Daly is bubbly and enthusiastic as Spot. And Chris Vernon, as Spot’s dad and various other animals, is charmingly daggy.</p>
      <p>Director Liesel Badorreka makes good use of the whole space and the production fits comfortably on the large Playhouse stage.</p>
      <p><i>Spot</i> has a relaxed performance style with an even tempo throughout. It’s a sunny bit of kids’ theatre with all the charm and innocence and simplicity of the book.</p>
