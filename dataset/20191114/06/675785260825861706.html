      <h2>Euro 96 winner had no idea why Houllier wouldn't play him - and was left fighting for his life after a dead leg while playing for Spurs in 2002</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T06:21:34+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 06:21</time> by <a rel="author">Gareth Bicknell</a></address>
      <p>Christian Ziege has opened up on why he regretted his transfer to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> .</p>
      <p>The former Germany wing-back joined Liverpool in 2000 having already won two Bundesliga titles and the UEFA Cup with Bayern Munich, as well as the Serie A title with AC Milan.</p>
      <p>He was also a Euro 96 winner after helping Germany win the tournament staged in England.</p>
      <p>And it was after experiencing football in the UK that <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/christian-ziege">Ziege</a> decided he wanted to test himself in English football.</p>
      <p>Middlesbrough gave him that chance, and after enjoying an impressive season with the Teessiders, Ziege was snapped up by Gerard Houllier's Liverpool as the Reds activated the Â£5.5million release clause in the German's contract.</p>

      <p>But with hindsight he acknowledges it was a bad move. He played just 16 games in the 2000-1 season, and while he helped Liverpool win the League Cup, Ziege was a bystander as Houllier's side trousered five trophies that year.</p>
      <p>"I didn't play enough and still don't know why," Ziege told the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7682337/Christian-Ziege-played-Euro-96-admits-Gazza-run-straight-scored.html">Mail</a> . "I scored a penalty in the shootout to win the League Cup but then didn't play in the FA or UEFA Cup finals.</p>
      <p>"Gerard Houllier had a problem that he never bothered to explain. It made me think, 'If I'm a coach, I'll always tell my players the truth'."</p>
      <p>Ziege subsequently joined <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> where he had a more successful time, scoring seven goals in 47 appearances between 2001 and 2004.</p>

      <p>However, his spell with Spurs almost had a tragic end when a freak injury reaction left him fighting for his life on Boxing Day 2002.</p>
      <p>"I had a dead leg, no big deal," he said. "But my thigh was swelling and swelling. I learned later that the blood was trapped between two skins, it had nowhere to go.</p>
      <p>"I did not want to go to hospital, not at Christmas, but my wife insisted. Thank God she did. By the time we arrived I was unconscious. There was pressure on everything inside my body, I was fighting for my life.</p>
      <p>"They opened the leg and it went down like a balloon. But it left a big hole, something went completely wrong. I still suffer now, but I am also lucky. Another 30 minutes and they would have cut off my leg to save me.</p>
      <p>"In this moment, you realise that life is so much more than just a football game."</p>
