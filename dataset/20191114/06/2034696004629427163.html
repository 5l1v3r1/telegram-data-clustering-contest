      </p>
      <p>A video has surfaced online showing a message sent by <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/GREEN-DAY">Green Day</a> frontman Billie Joe Armstrong to a fan who hung up on him twice after assuming it was a prank call. Check it out below.</p>
      <p>Recorded in 1996, the clip was shared by Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Jmsmnn/">u/jmsmnn</a> along with the story of how his wife sent fanmail to Armstrong before he attempted to call her. She didn’t believe it was real so hung up on him, and later attempts to get back in touch failed. In the video, Armstrong assures the fan that it’s really him by showing off a Valentine’s Day card she’d sent, as well as a Green Day flyer and a letter he was sending back.</p>
      <p>“In 1996, Billie Joe Armstrong took time to call my wife when she was 15,” they wrote. “She would send him letters often. One day he called her house to thank her,” he shared. “Being a young girl from a small town, she couldn’t believe it was really him so she assumed it was a prank call and hung up on him. His wife immediately called back to try to convince her it was real. She hung up on her too.</p>
      <p>“A week or so later a package showed up with a video in it. In the video he held up the letters she had sent him and thanked her for them.”</p>
