      <p>India is at the cusp of a clean and green mobility revolution, and with air pollution choking our very existence, this is truly a step in the right direction. With environment sustainability as the centrepiece, electric vehicles promise to provide cleaner air, economical modes of transport and eventually, financial security in the long-term.</p>
      <p>A recent report by The Climate Group states that India is one of the top three EV100 regions – EV100 is a global corporate initiative to accelerate the transition to electric vehicles. This presents a huge opportunity for automobile giants to be a part of this evolution, which also holds the promise of being an integral part of the global movement that aims to promote a healthy and sustainable environment.</p>
      <p>Over the last 95 years, automobile giant MG Motor has become synonymous with credibility and innovation. Earlier this year, the brand launched the MG Hector, a true revolution in digital connectivity features for automobiles. The SUV has received an overwhelming response from the Indian market. Over 38,000 units of Hector have been booked until now, and in the months of July-September, MG Motor sold 6,134 units of the SUV.</p>

      <p>Already known as a global forerunner in the field of electromobility, MG Motor is taking yet another revolutionary step, with the launch of the MG ZS EV, an SUV that aims to spark change and promote environmental conservation through the use of electric vehicles. The switch to electric vehicles is the future for the world, including India. In fact, the Indian government has set ambitious targets to accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles. There are incentives being offered to automobile makers to develop new EV models and manufacturing components, like lithium-ion batteries. The Indian government has created momentum through its Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles Scheme that encourages the adoption of electric vehicles, with a goal of reaching 30% EV penetration by 2030.</p>
      <p>MG Motor’s new campaign featuring Benedict Cumberbatch, #ChangeWhatYouCan, emphasises taking small steps individually to make a huge difference. The association with the acclaimed actor is because both him and the brand share similar values that revolve around community-related causes. The actor is well known for voicing his opinion on gender equality in the entertainment industry. He was recently seen at the Extinction Rebellion protests in London, taking a stand against climate change.</p>
      <p>MG Motor has previously launched a range of initiatives to spread awareness on EV mobility and continues to partner with global players to bring about a revolution!</p>
      <p>The MG ZS EV is a global offering that blends in the brand’s capabilities in electromobility and state-of-the-art technology and design. This variant is likely to pack in a 44.5 kWH lithium-ion battery coupled with a 150hp electric motor. The charging time is pegged at 7 hours using a 7kW AC charger and 40 minutes using a 50kW DC fast-charger.</p>

      <p>Having won the hearts of the Indian population with the MG Hector, the brand is marching ahead with the expansion of its product portfolio in the country. It aims to leverage the untapped EV potential in India by launching the all-electric ZS SUV as its next offering. This variant is already being sold in international markets like UK, Thailand and China. In fact, the carmaker has already received 2,000 orders within two months of its UK launch.</p>
      <p>Founded in the UK in 1924, Morris Garages vehicles were much sought after by many celebrities, including the British Prime Ministers and even the British Royal Family for their styling, elegance, and spirited performance. The MG Car Club, set up in 1930 at Abingdon in the UK, has more than a million loyal fans, making it by far one of the world’s largest clubs for a car brand. MG has evolved into a modern, futuristic and innovative brand over the last 95 years. MG Motor India has begun its manufacturing operations at its car manufacturing plant at Halol in Gujarat.</p>
      <p>The EV revolution is certainly not going to be a silent one - with MG Motor India helming the state of affairs in electromobility, this journey is going to be pleasant and a clean one for sure!</p>
