      <h2>Allan Steel's side smashed Strathaven to set up a showdown with Allan Glens next month</h2>

        <b>Strathaven...12 East Kilbride...50</b>
      </p>
      <p>Allan Steel saluted a ‘best-ever’ performance from his East Kilbride players as they marched into the West Regional Shield final.</p>
      <p>The Torrance House outfit beat Strathaven 50-12 on Saturday to set up a final with league rivals Allan Glens on December 7.</p>
      <p>EK dominated their lower-league opponents from start to finish and gaffer Steel said: “It’s the best performance in the whole time I’ve been at the club.</p>
      <p>“The level of focus and commitment was spot on and for the first 70 minutes we didn’t give Strathaven a look in.</p>
      <p>“We prepared excellently and stood up well to a potential banana skin.</p>
      <p>“I am absolutely delighted with the way the boys went about it.”</p>

      <p>EK are now hoping to land their first trophy in 17 years.</p>
      <p>“We’ve not lifted silverware since around 2002 when we last won the shield, so this is a big incentive for the boys to do that,” Steel added.</p>
      <p>“We’ve had a few promotions, but it’s always been as runners-up, so this is a chance to get our hands on a trophy.”</p>
      <p>Competitive fixtures between the neighbours have been rare over the years, and with Strathaven currently sitting top of the division below East Kilbride there could have been concern in the Torrance House camp going into the tie.</p>
      <p>However, a week off from competition had left EK, in the words of captain, Mark Ellison, “buzzin” beforehand and they blew their hosts away pretty much from the off.</p>
      <p>An early Grant Dryburgh penalty was followed by tries from Chris Mclellan, Robbie Greenfield and Ellison to leave the visitors home &amp; hosed by the half.</p>

      <p>Ellison’s try prompted some debate over whether VAR had a place in amateur sport, as he was so far offside on his interception try that he could have put the kettle on back in his EK flat. Either that or he is faster, much faster, than anyone previously thought and was actually onside.</p>
      <p>The second half carried on in a similar vein, with Jonno Ford and Chris O’Neil both touching down twice before a late Strathaven rally brought them some reward with a brace of scores.</p>
      <p>It was appropriate that both Ford and O’Neill went over as they were amongst the more prominent members of a dominant EK pack.</p>
      <p>Strathaven carry some big laddies up front but they were unable to cope with the physicality and technique of the EK forwards.</p>
      <p>Credit, though, to Allan Steel’s side in that they did not seek just to play, ‘up the jumper’ rugby, and instead spun the ball wide at every opportunity.</p>

      <p>Wingers Iain Brown and Dryburgh were both on fire and despite neither touching down wrought havoc in the Strathaven defence and created space for colleagues to exploit.</p>
      <p>East Kilbride will now face Allan Glens in early December at a venue to be confirmed. Scotstoun, home of Glasgow Warriors, was a potential venue but there now seems to be some conjecture over this. Details will be announced in due course.</p>
      <p>Steel added: "I'm very happy with the win and the performance.</p>
      <p>"We knew going into the game it would be really tricky because Strathaven are a team who haven't lost in a long time this year.</p>
      <p>"We showed them respect because of that with our preparation and that preparation was key. We knew if we got our set-pieces right and defending then we'd win the game and that's exactly what happened.</p>

      <p>"The boys knocked Starthaven back well and didn't give them an inch. We were totally dominant at the set-pieces and they couldn't do much about it."</p>
