      <h1>Joe Cole explains how Chelsea and Frank Lampard have put Man United's youth policy in the shade</h1>
      <h2>The Blues are in the top four whilst Manchester United sit in seventh</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T06:00:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Elliott Jackson</a></address>
      <p>Former Chelsea midfielder Joe Cole has insisted the Blues' youngsters are much better than Manchester United's current crop.</p>
      <p>The Blues have enjoyed unrivalled success this season with bringing through academy graduates under Frank Lampard.</p>
      <p>Tammy Abraham, Reece James, Fikayo Tomori, Mason Mount and Callum Hudson-Odoi have all established themselves as first-team regulars.</p>
      <p>For the likes of Abraham, Tomori and Mount they have hit the ground running, whilst James and Hudson-Odoi are now finding their best form after recovering from serious injuries.</p>
      <p>Their success has helped the Blues up to third in the table, nine points clear of top four rivals Arsenal after the 2-0 win over Crystal Palace.</p>
      <p>Given the transfer ban imposed on Lampard, the success he's had with such a young group of inexperienced players is remarkable.</p>
      <p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has tried to implement a similar philosophy at Manchester United but he hasn't enjoyed the same success.</p>
      <p>The Red Devils are already 10 points behind Chelsea after 12 matches.</p>

      <p>Whilst the approaches of the two managers have been similar, Cole has explained the reason behind Chelsea's success is simply because their young players are better than United's.</p>
      <p>"I don't think you'll ever get the perfect storm which happened when Fergie [Sir Alex Ferguson] brought through all the young players through at Manchester United," Cole told BT Sport.</p>

      <p>"They were all local lads and then they went on to win things, there are a mix and a blend to have for that and I think Chelsea are the closest club to achieving it.</p>
      <p>"The players coming through at Manchester United are good players but I don't see any Callum Hudson-Odois, no Mason Mounts but they are good players.</p>
      <p>"Credit Manchester United for developing them."</p>
