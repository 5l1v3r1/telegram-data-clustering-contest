      <p>REUTERS: Promising batsman Will Pucovski has ruled himself out of selection for Australia's test series against Pakistan due to "matters pertaining to mental wellbeing", Cricket Australia said on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The 21-year-old right-hander was in the running to make his test debut but reported the issue to team management in Perth while playing for Australia A against Pakistan, where he was out for five in the first innings and did not bat in the second.</p>

      <p>Ben Oliver, Cricket Australia’s EGM of National Teams, said Australian cricket would always place the wellbeing of its people ahead of performance.</p>
      <p>“We applaud Will for having the courage to discuss his situation with team management,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Will’s decision not to nominate for test selection was the right one in the circumstances and one that everyone in the Australian cricket family supports."</p>
      <p>Pucovski, who hit 243 for Victoria in a Sheffield Shield game against Western Australia last year, has previously taken a six-week break from cricket because of mental health issues and left the Australia squad that played Sri Lanka this year for the same reason.</p>
      <p>Australia will name their squad later on Thursday for next week's first test in Brisbane.</p>
