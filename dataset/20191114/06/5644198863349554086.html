      <p>WASHINGTON: The U.S. Senate Commerce Committee will hold a November 20 hearing on the testing and deployment of self-driving vehicles that will include top U.S. safety officials as Congress has struggled to pass legislation on autonomous vehicles.</p>
      <p>The hearing will come one day after the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) meets to determine the probable cause of a March 2018 Uber Technologies Inc self-driving vehicle crash that killed a pedestrian in Arizona.</p>
