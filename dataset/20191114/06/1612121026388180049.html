      <p><a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/345309-google-stadia-november-19/">Google Stadia</a> is on the horizon, with the official launch on November 19th. We already know <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/340822-heres-everything-you-need-to-know-about-google-stadia/">what 12 games will be available</a> at launch with several more following close behind, but it looks like the small game library won’t be the only thing disappointing at launch. Google has confirmed a few other features that won’t be available right away, including support for the currently <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/309806-unboxing-the-google-chromecast-ultra/">available Chromecast Ultra</a>.</p>
      <h3>Stadia’s barebones launch</h3>
      <p>Yup, if you already have a Chromecast Ultra and were planning on using that to <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/346143-download-google-stadia/">play Stadia games</a> on November 19th, you’ll have to wait. The new Chromecast that’s shipping with Stadia preorders will be fine, but older models will need a firmware update to work with the service. How that’s not ready to go already is beyond me.</p>
      <p>Other features, like Stream Connect, State Share, and Crowd Play, also won’t be ready for launch. Games will specifically have to support them, and while Google anticipates the first game to use Stream Connect by the end of the year, the State Share and Crowd Play features won’t be integrated until early next year. These are the features that were touted as major, defining aspects of Stadia, since they allow other people to control and interact with games instead of it just being another game streaming service.</p>
      <p>The achievements system for Stadia <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/338867-google-play-music-proves-why-google-stadia-is-going-to-fail/">will be half-baked</a> at launch too. Your progress will be recorded, but you won’t get achievement notifications or be able to check your achievements anywhere until Google finishes that system. The same goes for the family sharing system, which isn’t done yet. Buddy Passes will also take a few weeks to ship out, too.</p>
      <p>Basically, this is going to be a very, very barebones launch, with just the core game streaming available for the <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/345642-google-opening-stadia-game-development-studio-in-montreal-and-theyre-hiring/">handful of available titles</a>. I hope the early adopters have a good time with this, because it sounds like it’s going to be rough.</p>
