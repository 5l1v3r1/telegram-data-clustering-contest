      <h1>'A good place' - Nottingham Forest legend assesses Reds' start to the season</h1>
      <h2>European Cup winner Garry Birtles reflects on the start to the Championship campaign for Sabri Lamouchi's men</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T06:00:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Sarah Clapson</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Nottingham Forest</a> have gone into the international break in a good place.</p>
      <p>Winning away at Luton Town and winning <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/match-reports/nottinham-forest-derby-county-analysis-3521884">a massive game</a> at home against Derby County, that’s a good way to go into the break - and to put those successive defeats behind us.</p>
      <p>We just need to make sure we come out of the break in the right way, unlike last time when we lost two on the bounce.</p>
      <p>We’re fifth at the moment, which isn’t a bad position to be in. And we’ve got a game in hand.</p>
      <p>We always talk about how difficult the Championship is, though. It’s a beast. You can see that in how tight the table is.</p>
      <p>No-one is really pulling away at the top yet.</p>
      <p>West Bromwich Albion are obviously doing well and are leading the way at the moment. They look like they could be in contention to open up a bit of ground at the top.</p>
      <p>But it’s not happened yet. They are still within touching distance of plenty of other teams.</p>
      <p>Forest are only five points behind them, with that game in hand.</p>

      <p>West Brom looked good against us on the opening day of the season, but we still could have beat them. <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/match-reports/outlandish-fluke-leaves-aro-muric-3170237">We went 1-0 up</a> then sat back and did nothing for the rest of the game.</p>
      <p>The Championship is there for the taking, if anyone wants it. Someone just needs to take it by the scruff of the neck.</p>
      <p>There are so many teams still in contention - right down to midway in the table.</p>
      <p>That tells you the quality of the division.</p>
      <p>West Brom have been winning games. We’ve been winning games. Preston are still doing brilliantly. You’d expect Leeds will be there or thereabouts.</p>
      <p>But at the minute, there’s no one standout team.</p>
      <p>It’s a cliche but anyone really can beat anyone.</p>
      <p>Luton could quite easily <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/match-reports/normal-service-resumed-how-nottingham-3496887">pick up a good result</a> against someone. Stoke might turn their season around. Teams like Hull have put together decent runs.</p>
      <p>I thought Cardiff would be one of the teams up there, but it’s not worked out like that yet.</p>
      <p>It’s a real shame to see Neil Warnock go from there.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>He steered the club through a difficult time, on and off the pitch, and did a magnificent job.</p>
      <p>Wherever he’s been, I don’t think you can knock what he’s done.</p>
      <p>He’s been a terrific manager, he’s a character and if he does decide to call it a day now, it will be a sad loss to the game.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/nottingham-forest-name-among-early-3527330">It will be interesting to see how Cardiff do now.</a>
      </p>
      <p>At the moment, the table is so tight.</p>
      <p>If you lose a few games you can drop down to mid-table and if you win a few, you’re right up there.</p>
      <p>All Forest can do is keep winning games. Keep doing what we have been doing.</p>
      <p>We’re very resilient; a solid side. Teams don’t score many goals against us - and we’ve got to keep it that way.</p>
      <p>With the players we’ve got, we’ve always got a chance then, of going forward and creating something.</p>

      <p>Sooner or later <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/revelation-outstanding-more-come-how-3532587">that attacking midfield</a> is really going to click, and when that happens we’ll be a very dangerous team.</p>
      <p>But we’re still looking okay at the moment. Some people might say it’s better than okay, but we can’t get ahead of ourselves.</p>
      <p>It’s just great because in the past we’ve always been looking at the bottom half of the table.</p>
      <p>This time, there is a lot of hope and positivity around the City Ground.</p>
      <p>It’s great to be a Forest fan at the moment, but we can’t rest on our laurels.</p>
      <p>The biggest game is always the next one.</p>
