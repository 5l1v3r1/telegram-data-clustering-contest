      <p>Australia's Melbourne Zoo is celebrating the arrival of its newest koala - an unnamed five-month-old joey - the first to be born at the zoo in more than eight years.</p>
      <p>The baby has just started to peek out from its mother's pouch where it has been growing for the past few months. <br/><br/>The zoo's Australian Bush keeper Maddy Jamieson said the joey and first-time koala mum Karri were doing well.</p>
      <p>"Karri has been a fantastic mum so far," Jamieson said. "She is feeding the joey really, really well and she is looking after her and doing everything that she is supposed to be doing."</p>
      <p>Karri was the last koala to be born at the zoo.</p>
      <p>Her joey's gender is not yet known, and it is not expected to emerge fully from her pouch for about a month, when it will start to eat the gum leaves that make up the adult koala's diet.</p>
      <p>Koalas have been listed as a vulnerable species in many parts of <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/australia.html">Australia</a> with their population under threat from habitat destruction and disease.</p>
      <p>They prefer to live in coastal forests, which are being cleared for suburban expansion, and are thought to have been <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/10/tragedy-koalas-burned-death-australia-bushfire-191030050748421.html">victims of the ferocious bushfires</a> that have swept through the country's eastern coast in recent weeks. </p>
