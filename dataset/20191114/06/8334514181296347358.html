      <p>FRANKFURT (Reuters) - To unclog bottlenecks last year at his Tesla Inc (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/TSLA.O">TSLA.O</a>) plant in California, Elon Musk flew in six planeloads of new robots and equipment from Germany to speed up battery production for its Model 3.</p>

      <p>Now the Tesla CEO is trying to tap that German automation ecosystem directly with Tuesday’s announcement that the electric carmaker will build a European car and battery factory near Berlin.</p>
      <p>So far, Musk has failed in his plans to create a factory so highly automated that it allows Tesla to make cars more efficiently than much bigger rivals. As a result, the automaker has struggled to meet production goals and been hit with defections of key staff members to rival firms.</p>
      <p>The new German factory is designed to help change all that.</p>
      <p>“Everyone knows German engineering is outstanding for sure. You know that is part of the reason why we are locating Gigafactory Europe in Germany,” Musk said at a prestigious German car awards ceremony in Berlin late on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>BMW (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/BMWG.DE">BMWG.DE</a>) has a factory in Leipzig, where it builds its i3 electric vehicle and it will source battery cells from a factory in Erfurt run by China’s Contemporary Amperex Technology Ltd (CATL) (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/300750.SZ">300750.SZ</a>)..</p>
      <p>VW is retooling a plant in Zwickau to build 330,000 electric cars and German engineering giant Siemens AG (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/SIEGn.DE">SIEGn.DE</a>), which has an industrial and technology hub in Berlin, last week said it met with Musk to discuss projects in the area of advanced manufacturing and car charging.</p>
      <p>German carmakers and suppliers are tapping in to a 1 billion euro ($1.10 billion) fund set up by Germany to increase battery cell production and are further aided by a government-funded research facility to increase battery cell development know-how.</p>
      <h3>PRODUCTION GOAL</h3>
      <p>Tesla has yet to meet its goal of building more than 500,000 Model 3 cars by 2018. That goal was set back in 2016 and since then Tesla’s production guru, Peter Hochholdinger, a former Audi production expert, quit to joined rival Lucid.</p>
      <p>This year Tesla expects to deliver 360,000 to 400,000 cars, a target that includes selling all models.</p>
      <p>By contrast, the Volkswagen brand delivered 6.24 million cars last year and is readying its global production network to build 22 million electric cars by 2028.</p>
      <p>To ramp up manufacturing, Tesla started making its Model 3 in a tent, but the California-built cars often failed to meet German quality standards.</p>
      <p>In August, German car rental company Nextmove walked away from a 5 million-euro ($5.55 million) order for 85 Tesla Model 3 electric vehicles, following a dispute over how to fix quality issues.</p>
      <h3>POTENTIAL FOR AUTOMATION</h3>
      <p>Although Tesla has chosen a high-cost location, there is higher potential for automation with electric cars since they are less complex to build than combustion engined vehicles.</p>
      <p>A combustion engined car has 1,400 components in the motor, exhaust system and transmission. By contrast, an electric car’s battery and motor has only 200 components, according to analysts at ING.</p>
      <p>While the average combustion engine takes 3.5 hours to make, and the average transmission requires 2.7 hours of assembly, an electric motor takes only about 1 hour to assemble, consultants at Alix Partners said in their Global Automotive Outlook study.</p>
      <p>“Personnel is not a high cost factor in the production of electric cars,” Evercore ISI analyst Arndt Ellinghorst said.</p>
      <p>Today the biggest cost factor is still battery packs, which amount to between 30% and 50% of the cost of an electric vehicle.</p>
      <h3>QUALITY VS SCALE</h3>
      <p>By adding the “Made in Germany” quality, Tesla could significantly boost sales of its electric cars, which are already class-leading.</p>

      <p>On Tuesday Tesla’s Model 3 was awarded the “Golden Steering Wheel” by Germany’s Auto Bild magazine, with jury member Robin Horning saying the Model 3 had beaten the new BMW 3 series and the Audi A4 in “mid and premium class” category.</p>
      <p>Volkswagen Chief Executive Herbert Diess congratulated Musk on winning the prize.</p>
      <p>“I want to congratulate you. With all this competition in Germany it is a great achievement,” he said at the awards ceremony. “I thank you for pioneering, for pulling us and pushing us. Elon is the innovator.”</p>
