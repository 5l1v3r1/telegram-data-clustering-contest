      <h1>Julian Gordon’s WeChat ‘Hasn’t Stopped Buzzing’ Since Xi Jinping Went Pro-Blockchain</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T06:26:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 06:26</time> by <a rel="author">Hisashi Oki</a></address>
      <p>Speaking at BlockShow Asia 2019, Hyperledger Vice President APAC Julian Gordon described the personal impact that the Chinese president’s <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/breaking-chinas-xi-jinping-urges-accelerated-blockchain-technology-adoption?utm_source=Telegram&amp;utm_medium=social">pro-blockchain remarks</a> have had on him: </p>
      <p>“Xi Jinping made that announcement 10 days ago. The reason I know that is because my phone is sitting on my desk — my WeChat started buzzing and hasn’t stopped since.” </p>
      <p>Hosted by the Linux Foundation, Hyperledger is an open-source blockchain project aiming to be a hub for open blockchain development across industries. It has gathered companies from different backgrounds such as IBM, Airbu, and J.P.Morgan to further advance cross-industry blockchain technologies. </p>
      <p>Hyperledger is also collaborating with Chinese companies in areas like trade finance, letters of credit (L/C), and e-visibility. For example, they are working with top Chinese banks like China Minsheng Bank and China CITIC Bank to remove the need for SWIFT in China’s domestic L/C settlement. </p>
      <p>Expectations for the Chinese blockchain market are quite high. Referring to big Chinese tech companies like Alibaba and Tencent, Gordon said that they were always amazed by Chinese entrepreneurship. </p>
      <p>Hyperledger is a permissioned blockchain project, which is different from a permissionless technology with anonymous participants. Yet Gordon claims that the two different ecosystems can coexist. Last June, the Ethereum Foundation <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/hyperledger-gains-microsoft-and-ethereum-foundation-among-raft-of-new-members">joined</a> Hyperledger.</p>
