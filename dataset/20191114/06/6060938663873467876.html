      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T06:35:07+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 06:35</time> by <a rel="author">TIMESOFINDIA.COM</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Deepika-Padukone">Deepika Padukone</a> and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Ranveer-Singh">Ranveer Singh</a> took everyone by surprise when they announced their marriage last year. The actors, who have been dating for about six years, finally got hitched in a grand ceremony in <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Italy">Italy</a> in presence of their family and friends. Deepika Padukone opted for a grand wedding ceremony, away from the glares of the media. They took their nuptial vows in presence of their families and close friends only. Not only that, the couple also got married twice on November 14 and then on November 15.</p>
      <p>According to reports, Deepika belong to Konkani family and Ranveer to Sindhi family. As they came from different cultural backgrounds, they wanted to honour both the traditions in the best possible way and looks like they pulled it off just perfectly!</p>
      <p>Deepika and Ranveer are today celebrating one year of togetherness. They are currently in <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/tirupati">Tirupati</a> seeking blessings of the almighty. After visiting Balaji and Padmavati Temple on November 14, the couple will fly to Amritsar to offer prayers at the Golden Temple on November 15</p>
      <p>On the work front, they will be seen together on screen once again in Kabir Khan’s ‘’83’.</p>
