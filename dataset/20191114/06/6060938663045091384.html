The couple decided to celebrate their first wedding anniversary in a very spiritual manner. They are going to visit a few divine places to seek the blessings of almighty. A while ago, the couple offered their prayers at the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/tirupati">Tirupati</a> Balaji Temple. Pictures of the two from the divine location has got surfaced and are going viral over the internet.</p>
      <p>In the pictures, Ranveer can be seen dressed in an embroidered golden sherwani paired with brown specs. While Deepika is seen wearing a heavily embellished red traditional saree. She accessorised her look with a traditional choker set, a gold necklace and adorned sindoor on her forehead. Both the actors looked gorgeous in the traditional outfits.</p>
      <p>However, as we were going through the beautiful pictures we observed that Deepika was wearing the same saree which was gifted to her by her in-laws during the Konkani wedding rituals. In one of the pictures from the wedding album, we can see the actress holding the 'shagun thaal' in her hand. The saree kept on the tray has the same design like that of the red saree the Bhavnani bahu is wearing today at Tirupati.</p>
