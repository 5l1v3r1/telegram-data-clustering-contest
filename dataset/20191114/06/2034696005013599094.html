      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/nine-inch-nails">Nine Inch Nails</a> frontman <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/trent-reznor">Trent Reznor</a> has shared a cowboy-inspired reaction to his first ever Country Music Association Award win.</p>
      <p>The industrial metal icon and acclaimed film score writer (along with collaborator Atticus Ross and YoungKio) shared in the glory of <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/lil-nas-x">Lil Nas X</a> and <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/billy-ray-cyrus">Billy Ray Cyrus</a>‘ runaway hit ‘Old Town Road’ taking home the prize for Musical Event of the Year at the CMA Awards on Wednesday – as the track features a short banjo composition sampled from NIN’s 2008 track ’34 Ghosts IV’.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>To celebrate the news, Reznor took to Instagram to share Photoshopped images of himself and Ross and Country And Western stars, complete with cowboy hats and the usual outfit. “New world, new times,” he captioned one image, adding “Thank you CMA Awards” to the other.</p>

      <p>“At first when you hear your stuff turned into something else, it always feels awkward because it’s something that intimately came from you in some way,” <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/trent-reznor-finally-talks-nine-inch-nails-sample-used-old-town-road-2561374">said Reznor last month, discussing his music being sampled for ‘Old Town Road</a>‘. “You feel a little bit violated, you know? And then you get over that and you realise it’s become something else and the [2002] <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/nme-851-1269888">Johnny Cash [cover of ‘Hurt’]</a> is incredible. It’s very flattering.”</p>

      <p>He also called Lil Nas X’s single “undeniably hooky,” and, while he didn’t explicitly admit whether he liked the track or not, he added that “it’s been stuck in my head enough.”</p>
