      <p>The justice minister has directly appealed to the public to stand up to far-right activists trying to stir up anti-migrant sentiment.</p>
      <p>Charlie Flanagan has told the Dáil he was “very disappointed” to see demonstrations outside premises due to house asylum seekers.</p>
      <p>“I understand that those demonstrating may feel they are sending a message to the Government but I would ask them to be conscious that it is not only the Government who is listening.</p>
      <blockquote>“The women and girls that were to be given shelter on a temporary basis are also listening. Every person from a minority background in the country is listening.”</blockquote>
      <p>Mr Flanagan said: “Far-right anti-immigrant activists are also listening and looking for opportunities to incite fear and hatred — as far-right groups have done throughout history.”</p>
      <p>The minister asked the public to speak up to show support for asylum seekers and the local communities that are being asked to welcome them.</p>
      <p>Fianna Fáil justice spokesman Jim O’Callaghan said there is a “limited amount of information” around the asylum system and the international obligations this country has in relation to those seeking refuge.</p>
      <p>He warned that those looking to “stir up trouble” often take advantage of this information vacuum.</p>
      <p>Mr O’Callaghan said the application process must be made quicker as many asylum seekers are waiting long periods in unsuitable direct provision centres.</p>
      <p>He said the Government needs to “up its game” and should begin to build specific accommodation instead of looking to hotels to house asylum seekers.</p>
      <p>Sinn Féin’s Martin Kenny, who received death threats after supporting plans to house asylum seekers in his constituency, said there are often legitimate concerns.</p>
