      <h1>Reddit’s official Android app now lets you view subreddit wikis and makes it easier to format links</h1>

      <p>Android users are spoilt for choice when it comes to third-party Reddit apps on the Play Store. From BaconReader to Boost, there is a variety of different apps to choose from. While third-party apps for Reddit were a necessity a while ago, it all changed when the company released its official app on iOS and Android. Since its release, the Reddit app has undergone several changes. And with each successive update, Reddit <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/reddit-android-version-3-21-interactive-post-previews-chat/">adds new features</a> to the app to improve user experience. Most recently, the app <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/reddit-for-android-android-q-dark-mode/">received support for Android 10’s dark mode</a> toggle. And now, with the latest update, the app is getting two more handy features.</p>
      <p>Update 3.40 of the Reddit app is now rolling out to users worldwide and it brings a couple of noteworthy changes to the way you format links and view subreddit wikis. But before we get to the details, here’s the official changelog for Reddit 3.40:</p>

      <p>Now that we’ve got that out of the way, let’s focus on the new way to format links on the app. Reddit makes use of markdown for formatting, so inserting a link to a specific word or phrase requires you to first add your text in square brackets, which is followed by the link in parenthesis. This could get a bit cumbersome on mobile, so Reddit has now added a button that helps you generate these formatted links.</p>

      <p>Furthermore, the update also adds subreddit wikis to the app, which means that you won’t be redirected to the browser if you wish to view the wikis. The subreddit wikis can be found within the Menu tab and tapping on the option opens it up in the app itself.</p>
