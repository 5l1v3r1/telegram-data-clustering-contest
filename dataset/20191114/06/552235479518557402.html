      <h1>Neil Warnock receives Hearts backing as he's tipped to relish taking down Celtic and Rangers</h1>
      <h2>Warnock wants the Jambos hotseat and his former player Kirk Broadfoot insists he's the right man for the job.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T06:00:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Scott Burns, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/scott-burns/</a></address>
      <p>Kirk Broadfoot reckons his old gaffer Neil Warnock would turn <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hearts-fc">Hearts</a> into a major force again and relish taking down the Old Firm.</p>
      <p>St Mirren defender Broadfoot was Warnock’s skipper when they worked together at Rotherham.</p>
      <p>And the former <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> star claims it would be great for Scottish football if the veteran boss succeeded Craig Levein at Tynecastle.</p>
      <p><i><b>Record Sport</b> </i>has revealed the former Cardiff manager’s name has been put forward for the vacant head coach’s job in the capital.</p>
      <p>Warnock has previously spoken of his desire to take over one of the Edinburgh clubs and have a crack at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> and Rangers.</p>

      <p>And Broadfoot said: “He would be a great appointment for Hearts but great for Scottish football in general.</p>
      <p>“There would never be a dull moment if Neil was to come up here.</p>
      <p>“He is some character but more importantly he is a top manager, as he has proved throughout his career. If Neil was to go to Hearts then he would turn Tynecastle into a fortress and nobody would like going there.</p>
      <p>“It is a hard place to go just now but Neil would definitely take it up a notch or two.</p>
      <p>“He would unite everyone, the players and the fans, get everyone in it together.</p>
      <p>“That is one of his great strengths. He loves being the underdog and trying to beat the big teams so a job like Hearts would be perfect.</p>
      <p>“They have a good squad and have been unlucky with injuries but if they get the right manager in then I would expect them to climb quickly to the other end of the table.”</p>

      <p>The 70-year-old is one of the most successful managers in Football League history, boasting a record eight promotions and umpteen successful survival bids.</p>
      <p>Broadfoot saw Warnock’s man-management skills first hand when Rotherham dodged the drop from the second tier in 2015-16.</p>
      <p>He recalled his first meeting with the charismatic gaffer and it was certainly different to what he had been used to with <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/st-mirren-fc">St Mirren</a>, <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a>, Blackpool and Scotland.</p>
      <p>He said: “I remember when Neil first walked into the dressing room and he was really funny.</p>
      <p>“He came in and said to the boys, ‘What am I doing here? We’ve got no chance, have you seen our fixtures?’</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“He just said what everybody else was thinking. We were really struggling and most people thought we were already relegated.”</p>
      <p>Warnock joined the Millers when they were in the relegation zone and had lost eight of their previous 12 fixtures but soon began to weave his magic.</p>
      <p>The wily old fox then took man-management to the next level when he gave Broadfoot the captain’s armband.</p>
      <p>The defender said: “We were pre-match for Burnley away and he slaughtered me in front of everyone.</p>

      <p>“I was fizzing because I think I had only played a game or so under him.</p>
      <p>“Then when we headed to Burnley on the bus he took me down the front.</p>
      <p>“He told me he was making me captain because we were struggling. He wanted me to get my arm around the boys and get them going.</p>
      <p>“Neil said he had only slaughtered me to try to take some of the pressure off the boys and galvanise them.</p>
      <p>“He also joked he didn’t want me to look like one of his favourites!”</p>
      <p>It looked like an almost impossible task but Warnock soon delivered Championship safety on the back of an amazing run.</p>
      <p>Broadfoot added: “It was weird but we soon started to pick up results and ended up going on an 11-game unbeaten run.</p>
      <p>“He just got the confidence up and set us up so we were hard to beat. We just managed to churn out results against some of the biggest teams in the Championship.</p>

      <p>“He was brilliant to play for and you just wanted to go out and win for him because he put so much belief and faith in you as a player.</p>
      <p>“Kevin Blackwell, his assistant, did a lot of the coaching but Neil had game plans and just made things so simple as we all knew what jobs we had to do.</p>
      <p>“He didn’t make many changes but he got everyone onside and wanting to play for him.</p>
      <p>“He kept us in the Championship by nine points and we had one of the lowest budgets in the league. That was some achievement.”</p>
      <p>Warnock then tried to line Broadfoot up again after he left Rotherham that summer.</p>
      <p>The stopper said: “Neil phoned me in the summer and said he might be taking the Blackburn or Nottingham Forest jobs and if he did then he would sign me.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“But those moves didn’t come off and I ended up signing at Rotherham again.”</p>
      <p>Warnock has spent almost 40 years in management with clubs such as Leeds, Sheffield United, Crystal Palace, QPR and Cardiff.</p>
      <p>Many thought he would retire after leaving the Bluebirds but now wants one last challenge.</p>
      <p>And Broadfoot said: “I would love to see him come up here to have a crack at Scottish football.”</p>
