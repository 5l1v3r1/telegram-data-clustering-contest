      <h1>Havoc at BTS Phra Khanong when SUV flees street justice (Video)</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T04:37:54+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 04:37</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/Coconuts%20Bangkok" target="_blank">Coconuts Bangkok</a></address>
      <p>Several motorbikers follow a hit-and-run driver in a low-speed pursuit down a busy downtown Bangkok street. But when the vigilantes manage to trap the sport utility vehicle and demand for the driver come out to take responsibility, it speeds away, crashing through more motorbikes and even dragging along a courier’s package – to the shock and horror of onlookers.</p>
      <p>Footage of the incident in the capital’s buzzing Pra Khanong district is going viral today along with news that police detained the driver and charged him with reckless driving.</p>
      <p>The driver in question, identified as 76-year-old former military man Maj. Gen. Surasak Jitboon, told reporters he did not know he crashed into anyone and refused to come out of the car because he was scared of the many bikers surrounding him.</p>
      <p>Videos from the incident suggest otherwise.</p>

      <p>At the beginning of the roughly 2-minute clip of the incident, Warayoot Pinjai, the person filming, says the silver Fortuner driven by Surasak had crashed into a motorbike and was trying to escape.</p>
      <p>“This was a hit and run. The driver won’t even come out to see the damage,” Warayoot says, narrating the low-speed chase before reciting the Fortuner’s license plate number.</p>
      <p>Right before the vehicle reaches BTS Phra Khanong, several motorcyclists manage to catch up, surround and block it. Warayoot goes to the front of the car, blocking Surasak’s path and demands that he “park your car and come out.”</p>
      <p>That’s when Surasak crashes into Warayoot’s motorbike while he’s still rolling tape. The clip shows Warayoot’s Vespa lying on the street before the Fortuner as onlookers demand Surasak exit the vehicle.</p>
      <p>He does not. Instead he backs up and speeds past the vigilantes, crashing into at least one more biker, a LalaMove deliveryman, in his path.</p>
      <p>In another video shot from another angle and posted to Facebook by user Lookmai Chanakarn, the courier’s carrier is trapped under the SUV’s front wheels as it speeds off.</p>

      <p>Warayoot <a href="https://www.khaosod.co.th/breaking-news/news_3055082">told reporters</a> that several vigilantes kept following the car until they managed to stop him near Ekkamai BTS station but was unable to negotiate with a frustrated Surasak. Warayoot, then decided to file a police report at Khlong Tan Police Station. </p>
      <p>A test revealed that Surasak did not have any alcohol in his system. While he was brought into the police station, Surasak is evidently still frustrated and at one point even shoves a reporter away. </p>
