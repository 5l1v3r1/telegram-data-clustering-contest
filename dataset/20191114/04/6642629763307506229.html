      <h4>Egypt working to calm Israel-Gaza fighting</h4>
      <p>Egyptian officials said Cairo is attempting to de-escalate tensions in the Gaza Strip amid the worst bout of fighting there in recent months.</p>
      <p>The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to brief the media, said Egypt's general intelligence agency has stepped up communications and has "opened channels" with the US and the European Union.</p>
      <p>Egypt often acts as a mediator between Israel and Palestinian factions, and brokered a <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/05/palestinians-truce-reached-israel-vowed-massive-strikes-190506022134617.html">ceasefire deal</a> in May.</p>
      <h4>Analysis: 'Neither side wants a full-scale war'</h4>
      <p>Yonah Jeremy Bob, an intelligence, terrorism and legal analyst for The Jerusalem Post, said neither Israel nor the Palestinian group Islamic Jihad "will actually want a full-scale war at this point".</p>
      <p>"If both sides operate according to some unwritten rule about not striking beyond a certain amount, probably after a few days things will settle down as has happened a few times over the last year," he told Al Jazeera via Skype from Modi'in-Maccabim-Re'ut in central Israel.</p>
      <h4>Palestinian wounded in Israeli attack dies: Gaza ministry</h4>
      <p>A Palestinian man wounded in an Israeli attack has died from his injuries, the Gaza Health Ministry said.</p>
      <p>The health ministry in the Palestinian enclave identified the latest man killed as Ibrahim al-Dabous, 26. It said he was hit in an attack on Beit Lahia in the northern Gaza Strip.</p>
      <p>The latest casualty brought the toll to at least five people killed, including Abu al-Ata and his wife, with another 30 wounded since the morning, according to the Gazan health ministry.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Israeli medics said they had treated 39 people.</p>
      <h4>Israel-Gaza border area 'under lockdown'</h4>
      <p>The areas around the fringe of the border between Israel and Gaza are under a tight security lockdown, Al Jazeera's Harry Fawcett reported.</p>
      <p>"We are unable to go any further than about five kilometres or so away from the border because of a police road closure," Hawcett said, reporting from the Gaza border.</p>
      <p>"The rocket fire still continues and so does the Israeli response. We heard and saw a rocket coming out from Gaza territory behind us heading north. It was intercepted by the Iron Dome in the skies overhead.</p>
      <p>"We also heard Israeli warplanes overhead, so it seems another round of air attacks could well be under way over Gaza and inside Gaza."</p>

      <h4>Netanyahu slammed by Arab MKs</h4>
      <p>Arab members of the Knesset, the Israeli Parliament, accused Prime Minister <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/benjamin-netanyahu.html">Benjamin Netanyahu</a> of escalating the situation in the Gaza Strip for his political survival.</p>
      <p>"The man who lost consecutive elections will leave the ground burned in a desperate attempt to stay in his position," MK Ayman Odeh said on Twitter.</p>
      <p>"For a decade, he [Netanyahu] worked every morning to prolong the occupation and undermine prospects for peace and this is what he did today as well."</p>
      <p>MK Walid Taha warned Netanyahu's policy of escalation would drag the region into a "real disaster".</p>
      <p>"What is happening threatens the security of the entire region and the lives of millions of innocent people in Gaza Strip," he said."Israel is in danger as a result of Netanyahu's aggressive policies."</p>

      <p>"Israel is not interested in escalation, but we will do everything required to protect ourselves," said Netanyahu, who heads a caretaker government following two inconclusive elections.</p>
      <p>"This could take time. What is needed is stamina and cool-headedness," added Netanyahu, who accused Abu al-Ata of "plotting additional attacks", without elaborating.</p>
      <h4>Analyst: Further escalation 'depends on behaviour of Hamas'</h4>
      <p>Mulhaimar Abu Sadaa, a professor at Al Azhar University in Gaza, says the besieged city might witness "further escalation" after Abu al-Ata's killing by Israeli forces, which prompted retaliatory rocket fire.</p>
      <p>"We are going to witness further escalation in the coming hours and days, but it all depends on the behaviour of Hamas," he told Al Jazeera, referring to the group administering the besieged enclave.</p>
      <p>"If Hamas is going to join the Islamic Jihad we are going to approach further escalation with Israel, but if Hamas is able to contain the Islamic Jihad with the help of the Egyptians the situation might be contained or brought under control within two-three days."</p>
      <h4>EU urges 'complete de-escalation'</h4>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/european-union.html">European Union</a> called for a "rapid and complete de-escalation".</p>
      <p>"The firing of rockets on civilian populations is totally unacceptable and must immediately stop," the bloc's diplomatic service said in a statement.</p>
      <p>"A rapid and complete de-escalation is now necessary to safeguard the lives and security of Palestinian and Israeli civilians."</p>
      <h4>Palestinian man killed, 12 others wounded, in fresh Israeli air raid</h4>

      <h4>Islamic Jihad leader: Israel to pay hefty price</h4>
      <p>"[Israeli PM Benjamin] Netanyahu will pay a hefty price for the assassination of Abu al-Ata … His troops and settlers will pay a hefty price for these crimes," Khaled al-Batsh, an Islamic Jihad leader, told crowds in Gaza.</p>
      <p>"Today, we tell our people, the only option available is to face [this aggression]," he said in televised remarks.</p>
      <h4>Hamas spokesman decries Israeli attack on Gaza</h4>
      <p>Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem said the Israeli attacks and the assassination of Abu al-Ata is a "continuation of Israeli aggression towards the Palestinian people".</p>
      <p>"Our people are being targeted all over, inside and outside Palestine," he told Al Jazeera Arabic from Gaza.</p>
      <p>"The attack reflects Israel's unsuccessful tactics … Assassinations cannot and will not put an end to resistance, and are not enough to stop Palestinians from supporting the cause," Qassem said.</p>
      <p>"After every attack, the will of the resistance grows and becomes more persistent," he added.</p>
