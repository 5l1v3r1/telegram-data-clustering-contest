      <h2>The alleged killer of British backpacker Grace Millane said she told him she had tried BDSM techniques after their Tinder date in Auckland, New Zealand - she was found buried in a suitcase in a shallow grave</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T04:47:42+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 04:47</time> by <a rel="author">Matthew Dresch, Stephen D'Antal, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matthew-dresch/</a></address>
      <p>British backpacker Grace Millane told the man who killed her to choke her during sex because she was a fan of 50 Shades of Grey, his murder trial heard today.</p>
      <p>In a police interview a week after the man shared a Tinder date with the British university graduate in New Zealand, the man said she told him she had practised a number BDSM sex techniques with a previous boyfriend.</p>
      <p>Two days earlier, he had insisted he parted from Grace on the street with “a hug and a kiss on the cheek”, hoping to see each to celebrate her 22nd birthday the next day.</p>
      <p>But admitting for the first time that she was dead, the unnamed 27-year-old man said he had struggled to put her body in a suitcase bought for the purpose “because it just didn’t seem right.”</p>
      <p>The next morning he buried her in a shallow grave in the woods and took dozens of pills to try and kill himself, he told police.</p>

      <p>Grace’s parents, from Wickford in Essex, sat in the public gallery watching a recording of the interview played to the jury at Auckland High Court.</p>
      <p>The suspect still denied being responsible for her death, saying he had woken to find her lying dead on the floor, bleeding from the nose.</p>
      <p>“I picked her up and tried to wake her,” he said. “I was like screaming 'Grace, Grace'.</p>
      <p>“I was trying to shake her. I was listening to see if her breathing was coming through and that’s when I panicked. She was cold.”</p>
      <p>The powerfully built man said he had begun dialling for an ambulance.</p>
      <p>He said: “But I didn’t hit the button because I was scared how bad it looked. There’s a dead person in my room. I thought it looked terrible.</p>

      <p>“I was just terrified and scared. I went to The Warehouse (a chain store) and bought a suitcase.”</p>
      <p>Asked in the interview by his own lawyer why he was changing his story, he said: “I want her family to know that it wasn’t intentional but I also want her family to have closure.”</p>
      <p>He said he had invented his previous, bogus account because “I was still shocked and I apologise for misleading”.</p>
      <p>He agreed to show officers where he had buried Grace’s naked body in a shallow grave in dense woodland 10 miles from the city centre.</p>
      <p>The court has heard that prior to his arrest police had discovered CCTV footage from a number of bars and shops which exposed his 'lies' and showed him entering the CityLife hotel, where he lived in a £190-a-week room, arm in arm with Grace.</p>

      <p>They had been seen kissing and cuddling as they shared a number of cocktails and tequila shots, and Grace had messaged a friend to tell her: “I click with him so well.”</p>
      <p>Inside the room, he told Detective Sergeant Ewen Settle, “she asked me to turn the TV off so I turned it off.</p>
      <p>“I had it on the music channel and she started talking to me about 50 Shades of Grey which is a sex fantasy movie that’s out.</p>
      <p>“She told me that were a few things she likes doing and that she had done with her ex-partner.</p>
      <p>“I remember her saying that her partner and her had done things from the first couple of movies,” he told DS Settle.</p>
      <p>“They had binding, bondage with handcuffs, there was spanking with belts, choking, holding the hands down.”</p>

      <p>They started having sex, said the man, whose job had ended the previous day.</p>
      <p>He said: “At first it was just normal, it was very placid, and then she asked me if we could get into bondage and she started biting and then she asked me to bite her and so i did .</p>
      <p>“I stopped at first and said, ‘Is this something you really want to to do?’ and she said, ‘We are in the moment, let’s just go with it’.</p>
      <p>“I said I’m new to all all that sort of stuff. I’m used to having sex that is just sex and at first I was uncomfortable but I liked it so I was open to the idea,” said the 27-year-old local man, who cannot be named for legal reasons.</p>
      <p>The accused said Grace bit him twice on the upper arm and shoulder, leaving teeth marks and bruises which he saw the next day.</p>

      <p>The prosecution have told the jury their case is that Grace was already dead when the man took a series of intimate pictures of her having searched on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/google">Google</a> minutes before for “waitakere ranges”, the hills where she was later buried, and “hottest fire”.</p>
      <p>Grace’s phone has never been found, and the defendant has admitted dumping it in a rubbish bin along with her clothes, bag and shoes.</p>
      <p>According to data from his phone, the Crown have told the jury that as she lay dead in the room, the man also searched for and watched a number of hardcore pornographic videos</p>
      <p>In his police interviews, however, the man made no mention of porn.</p>

        <figcaption>Grace and the accused were filmed in an elevator just before her death</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>He said after rough sex when both were drunk, he had fallen asleep slumped on the floor of his shower with the water running and later gone to bed thinking Grace had left the hotel.</p>
      <p>He did not see her on the floor, he said. By 8am, the defendant was arranging another Tinder date that afternoon at a bar, he admitted. But he had trouble finishing his beer with the second woman because he was “not 100 per cent there”.</p>
      <p>He was still thinking Grace “would wake up and she would be okay.”</p>
      <p>“I spewed up a few times because I couldn’t put Grace in the bag because all I could think about was what we shared the night before,” he said.</p>
      <p>“And then I put her in the bag and the whole time I just kept saying, ‘I’m sorry, I’m sorry’.”</p>
      <p>The man denies murder, saying Grace’s death was an accident.</p>
      <p>The trial, expected to last four weeks in total, continues.</p>
