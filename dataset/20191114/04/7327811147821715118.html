      <p>Garth Brooks bested Carrie Underwood to win the top prize at Wednesday's show, which kicked off with a performance featuring country female acts across generations, included three female hosts and had Maren Morris as its top nominee.</p>
      <p>Brooks did highlight female acts during his acceptance speech at the Bridgestone Arena in Nashville, Tennessee.</p>
      <p>"If they gave this award for this show tonight, I'd have to give it to Reba McEntire's performance," Brooks said, also praising Kelsea Ballerini and Luke Combs, who won two honors.</p>
      <p>All eyes seemed to be on Underwood, who had a successful year with her album "Cry Pretty" and an all-female tour, for an entertainer of the year win. The last woman to win the prize was Taylor Swift in 2011 and Underwood was this year's sole female nominee.</p>
      <p>Underwood hosted the show alongside McEntire and Dolly Parton, though she didn't win any awards. Underwood did win in a way - she won over the audience: She was a vocal beast, hitting all the right notes and more during a smoky performance of "Drinking Alone."<br/><i>The Associated Press contributed to this report.</i></p>
