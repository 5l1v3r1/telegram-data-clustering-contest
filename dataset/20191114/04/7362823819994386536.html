      <p>“I would be really remiss if I didn’t mention a huge facet of why this album sounds the way it does, and we miss him so dearly,” Morris said. “He texted me the morning that we got the nomination for album of the year this year, and we were so excited — that’s our friend, Busbee.”</p>
      <p>Busbee produced 11 of the songs on "GIRL" and lent his musical talents to the album in the form of percussion, bass guitar and more.</p>
