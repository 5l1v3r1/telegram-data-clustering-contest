      <h3>Kessie plan - and a warning to Neves' admirers</h3>
      <p>Head of recruitment John Marshall believes it’s unlikely Wolverhampton Wanderers will rekindle their interest in AC Milan midfielder Franck Kessie in January.</p>
      <p>Kessie has been on Wolves’ radar for some time with head coach <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/nuno-espirito-santo">Nuno Espirito Santo</a> known to be an admirer of the 22-year-old Ivorian.</p>
      <p>But, despite plenty of speculation to the contrary, a deal to bring Kessie to Molineux this season isn’t high on Wolves’ agenda according to Marshall.</p>

      <p>Asked whether <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> will act on their interest in January, he added: "I don't think so, we have so many players in midfield."</p>
      <p>One of those players is the increasingly important <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/ruben-neves">Ruben Neves</a> , who scored his second goal of the season against Aston Villa on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Neves continues to be linked with a host of top European clubs, with Real Madrid reportedly among his many suitors.</p>
      <p>"Without a doubt, he is a real top player,” says Marshall. “We are aware of the fact that so many top clubs follow him around Europe but we are focusing on him. He is not for sale.”</p>

      <h3>Adama hoping for another Spain call</h3>
      <p>Adama Traore is ready to pledge his international future to Spain - despite being unable to fulfill his maiden call-up due to injury.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> winger has been in stunning form this season with two goals and eight assists in 20 matches in a variety of positions under Nuno Espirito Santo.</p>
      <p>His latest star turn arrived against his former club Aston Villa on Sunday as he had a say in both of Wolves’ goals in the 2-1 win.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/progressing-wolves-provide-injury-update-17243362">a hamstring injury sustained against Villa forced him to pull out of Spain duty</a> less than 24 hours after his first senior call-up.</p>

      <p>Speculation has been rife about Traore’s international future in recent weeks with the 23-year-old considering an offer to represent the country of his parents’ birth, Mali.</p>
      <p>But Traore has always spoken of his desire to play for Spain after earning caps at youth level - and he hopes to force his way back into Robert Moreno’s squad.</p>
      <p>“I’m happy because the country where I was born, they trust me, and they call me to be there,” Traore said. “But I’m focused on working every day to be my best.”</p>

      <h3>Wolves chase wonderkid</h3>
      <p>Wolverhampton Wanderers are among a clutch of big names chasing 15-year-old Scottish wonderkid Bruno Davidson, <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-transfer-news/brendan-rodgers-steals-march-celtic-20846259">according to reports.</a></p>
      <p>Davidson has caught the eye playing for Edinburgh boys’ side Hutchison Vale and has attracted interest from clubs north and south of the border.</p>
      <p>And <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves,</a> who have recruited academy players in bulk over the last 12 months, are said to be keen on signing Davidson.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-transfer-news/brendan-rodgers-steals-march-celtic-20846259">The Daily Record reports</a> Celtic have already offered him a three-year deal, but there's been further interest from England with Liverpool, Southampton, West Ham and Sunderland also keen on the winger.</p>
      <p>However, Leicester City boss Rodgers has jumped in front of his old club by offering Davidson a trial and he played for the club's under-16s against West Ham recently.</p>
      <p>And Davidson has also been invited for a trial later this month by Southampton as the battle to land the highly-rated talent hots up.</p>
