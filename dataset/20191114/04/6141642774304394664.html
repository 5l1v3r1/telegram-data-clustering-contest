      <p>With a new Island Plan set to be developed and finalised over the next 18 months, ministers faced questions this week from States Members about the future of La Gigoulande Quarry.</p>
      <p>Currently used for the extraction of building materials, the quarry has been described by Jersey Water as an ideal location for a reservoir that would meet the Island’s future demand for water.</p>
      <p>The site has also been suggested as an option for future waste disposal once the current inert waste site at La Collette reaches capacity.</p>
      <p>Responding to a question from Deputy Steve Luce, Infrastructure Minister Kevin Lewis said that La Collette could reach capacity before the end of 2021, although it was hoped there could be an extension to that date.</p>
      <p>Deputy Lewis said he recognised that there might be better future uses for the quarry than waste disposal, and said other potential sites would be considered.</p>
      <p>The issue was raised again shortly afterwards when St Brelade Constable Mike Jackson asked Environment Minister John Young whether he would support the reservoir proposals in preference to using the quarry as a ‘tip’.</p>
      <p>Deputy Young told the JEP the issue was complex, because there was an existing consent for extracting minerals and there needed to be measures in place to ensure future supplies for the construction industry.</p>
      <p>‘We have a perfect storm, with lots of significant issues coming together at once,’ he said. ‘Population, housing, infrastructure, water supplies, our ageing community and climate change – it’s an important time and the Island Plan is the key policy driver for managing these decisions.’</p>
      <p>Jersey Water has predicted that the Island could face future shortages of up to eight million litres of water per day during drought years if no action is taken. A new reservoir could provide 30% of total supplies, the company said.</p>
      <p>The company’s chief executive, Helier Smith, said it was essential that the issue of future water supplies formed part of the Island Plan, alongside strategies for mineral needs and waste disposal.</p>
      <p>Jersey Water’s proposals have previously been described as ‘speculative’ by Granite Products, the company which operates at La Gigoulande. General manager Simon Clowes said he expected the site to continue meeting the Island’s need for core building materials for many years to come, but also expressed a willingness to discuss the matter with Jersey Water.</p>
      <p>Drafting of the Island Plan is set to begin early next year, followed by a public inquiry in the autumn and a debate in the States Assembly in spring or summer 2021.</p>
