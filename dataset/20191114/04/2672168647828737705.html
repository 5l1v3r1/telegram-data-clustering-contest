      <p>Union Election Commission has a plan to hold the 2020 general election in all constituencies in Rakhine State even though it is unable to compile the list of eligible voters in Maungdaw and Buthidaung Townships in Northern Rakhine State, Myint Naing, Spokesperson of the Union Election Commission, told the media at the opening of capacity building course for election at Grand Amara Hotel in Nay Pyi Taw on November 13. </p>
      <p>Till date, the UEC has decided to hold the election in all constituencies and townships,” said Myint Naing who is also a member of the UEC. </p>
      <p>Myint Naing denied the news that the 2020 General Election is likely to be held in May next year. The UEC has not fixed the date for the election yet. </p>
      <p>The UEC said it would hold the 2020 General Election later in the year of 2020. Rakhine State is composed of 17 townships. The ongoing fights between Tatmadaw and the Arakan Army (AA) are taking place in nine townships including Yathaedaung, Minbya, MraukU, Ponnagyun and Kyauktaw Townships. The curfew (Section-144) remains in place in some townships there.</p>
      <p>Tun Aung Kyaw, member of Policy Affairs Leading Commission of Arakan National Party said: “Holding the election largely depends on whether both armed organizations actually want peace or not and negotiations between the two groups. The public will suffer major loss rather than political parties. The reason is that only elected representatives have the rights to present losses, oppression, lack of freedom and desires in parliament. The public will suffer major loss if the MPs cannot be elected due to the lack of election.”</p>
      <p>The UEC was unable to hold the 2015 election in some townships in Shan, Kachin, Kayin and Mon due to security concerns. </p>
