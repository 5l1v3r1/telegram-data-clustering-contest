      <h1>Jennifer Nettles Sent a Message to Country Radio With Her Outfit at the CMAs</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T04:15:26+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 04:15</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Murphy</a></address>
      <p>Jennifer Nettles, one half of the band Sugarland, attended the 53rd CMA Awards with a message she needed get off her chest. And by chest, we actually mean the inside of her jacket. Nettles graced the CMAs red carpet wearing a white pantsuit with a train attached to the jacket. Inside that bright pink train was a very specific, very clear message directed at country-music radio that Nettles proudly displayed: “Play Our F***in’ Records Please &amp; Thank You.” Nettles’s colorful outfit directly addressed the issue of <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/04/country-gals-are-being-wrangled-out-of-country-radio.html">gender inequality in radio play that is currently plaguing country music.</a> Nettle’s train not only demanded more radio time for female artists, but also addressed the gender-wage gap, as <a href="https://twitter.com/SapphireSwiftie?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1194754335441330176&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.billboard.com%2Farticles%2Fnews%2Fawards%2F8543546%2Fjennifer-nettles-equal-pay-power-suit-2019-cma-awards-red-carpet">the words “Equal Pay” were written on her back</a>. Maybe after watching <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/watch-cma-award-women-of-country-performance-dolly-parton.html">the stellar “Women in Country” opening number</a>, which Nettles participated in, country radio will listen to the words written on Nettles’s outfit. After all, she did ask nicely!</p>
