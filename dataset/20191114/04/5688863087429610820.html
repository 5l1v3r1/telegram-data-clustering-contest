        <b>Opening batsman Shikhar Dhawan continues to believe that wicketkeeper-batsman Rishabh Pant will come good for India in the long run despite the recent poor performances. Dhawan also reckons that team India is a strong contender to win the T20 World Cup in Australia late next year.</b>

      <p>The concerns surrounding <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/pant">Pant</a> has refused to die down since the World Cup after the national selection committee came out to publicly back him to be the heir to <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/ms_dhoni">MS Dhoni</a>. Three limited-over series — away to West Indies, and home to South Africa and Bangladesh — has come and gone with the 22-year-old not having done anything to cement his spot in any form of the game. In addition to his poor showing with the bat, Pant has been careless with his glovework and DRS calls. </p>
      <p>However, ahead of the third and final T20I versus India, stand-in skipper <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/rohit_sharma">Rohit Sharma</a> requested the media leave the youngster alone. Now, Rohit’s opening partner and senior-pro Dhawan, too, has extended his support to the Delhite.</p>
      <p>"I keep telling him that don't see what is being said or written about you in the media. See, the point is that whatever you see or read will come into your mind. I don't read any newspapers.</p>
      <p>"I have trained myself that way because I know that if I have done well, they will write good things and if I don't, they will write that. It is a journey. When I started, I also saw, but that is how you learn. Rishabh is a great talent and he will do really well in the long run," Dhawan told IANS.</p>
      <p>With the World T20 in sight, India has already begun full-swing preparations and the 33-year-old Dhawan is confident about India's chances Down Under.</p>
      <p>"We are strong contenders. From now onwards we will play so many T20s that we will get refined and be ready for the World T20. I am sure that we will do really well there," Dhawan added.</p>
