      <h3>Ripple Price Analysis</h3>
      <p>This week, ripple remained in a downtrend below the $0.2850 pivot level against the US Dollar. Moreover, XRP/USD broke many key supports near $0.2780 and settled below the 100 hourly simple moving average.</p>
      <p>The last decline gained pace below $0.2700 and the price traded to a new monthly low at $0.2668. Later, there was an upside correction above the $0.2700 level. However, the price faced a strong resistance near the $0.2760 level and the 100 hourly SMA.</p>
      <p>A high was formed near $0.2763 and the price is currently declining. Ripple is trading below the $0.2720 level and testing the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.2668 low to $0.2763 high.</p>
      <p>On the downside, an immediate support is near the $0.2700 level. Besides, the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.2668 low to $0.2763 high is also near the $0.2700 area.</p>
      <p>If there is a downside break below the $0.2700 support, the price could revisit $0.2665. Any further losses may perhaps push ripple price below the $0.2600 area. The <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/13/ripple-xrp-price-following-downtrend-risk-of-breakdown-persists/">next key support area</a> is near the $0.2540 level.</p>
      <p>On the upside, the price is facing a strong resistance near the $0.2740 and $0.2760 levels. More importantly, this week’s significant bearish trend line is still active with resistance near $0.2735 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair.</p>
      <p>Therefore, a clear break above the trend line, $0.2760, and the 100 hourly SMA is needed for a decent recovery in the near term. The next major resistance is near the $0.2850 level.</p>
