      <h1>Scot wore padded body suit to hide weight loss from pals in secret transformation</h1>
      <h2>Ashley Anderson went undercover for a TV show on which she reveals her secret weight loss to her family and friends.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T04:30:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">Maria Croce</a></address>
      <p>When Ashley Anderson had previously <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/slimming?pageNumber=2">tried to lose weight</a> she felt under too much pressure from other people knowing she was on a diet.</p>
      <p>So she went undercover for a new body transformation TV show to keep her weight loss a secret.</p>
      <p>Ashley, 30, from Aberdeen, had a special body suit made for her that kept her looking the same by adding foam padding – even though she was <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/slimming?pageNumber=2">shedding pounds</a> underneath.</p>

      <p>And after a 12-week programme of exercise and healthy eating she stepped out of the body suit <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/slimming?pageNumber=2">to reveal to family and friends</a> that she’d secretly lost three stone and shed 26 inches.</p>
      <p>Ashley appears in new TV show Secret Body which is screened on BBC Scotland on Thursday 14 November.</p>
      <p>She’d been struggling to control her weight for 10 years and used to be very fit when she was younger.</p>
      <p>Ashley was a black belt in martial arts, became an instructor and swam a mile, three times a week.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>She was dating a fellow instructor and when they split in her 20s she decided to give up the sport and without the exercise piled on the pounds and went up to a size 24-26 and weighed around 20st.</p>
      <p>She admitted she didn’t like how she looked in the mirror and would eat too much pasta, pizza and cheese.</p>
      <p>She runs a property maintenance company with her dad Colin but is also a make-up artist and was desperate to get back to the size 12-14 she used to be.</p>
      <p>And she wanted to be fit enough to join her dad on his regular mountain climbs.</p>

      <p>“I was ashamed of what I had become not because there’s any shame in being a bigger person – but because I know that’s not me and where I’m comfortable and where I’ve come from,” she explained.</p>
      <p>“I got to the stage where I was gaining weight and was too embarrassed to go back to exercise and I was comfort eating. If I’d had a stressful day I would treat myself to a takeaway.</p>
      <p>“I had joined a slimming class previous to this and although I had the support of my family, every time they’d see me they’d ask how I was getting on and had I lost weight. There was a pressure to lose weight and I almost wanted to rebel against that.”</p>
      <p>For the TV show, costume makers created a body suit for Ashley that would hide the fact she was losing weight. And expert trainers Rab Shields and Stephen Clarke came up with a food and exercise programme for her.</p>

      <p>Only her mum Maggie was in on the secret – and everyone else including her dad, who is separated from her mum, was kept in the dark.</p>
      <p>Keeping her weight loss a secret was tough as was hiding herself in the body suit. “You’d get invited to barbecues and everyone would be in summer dresses and I’d be there with a jumper on getting funny looks.”</p>
      <p>One time her dad popped round and she had to quickly run upstairs to get her suit on.</p>
      <p>“That was really tough – but it was worth it to keep the secret.”</p>
      <p>After 12 weeks of exercise and healthy eating she’d dropped 3st and got down to a size 18/20 and was fit enough to go hill walking with her dad.</p>

      <p>“It felt wonderful. When I took off the body suit it was a lot bulkier than I’d thought. Even though 12 weeks is not a long period of time I could still see how far I’d come. It was a lot more emotional that I thought it would be.”</p>
      <p>Ashley is planning a party with friends and family to watch the TV show together.</p>
      <p>She said friends and family were proud of her weight loss and shocked she’d managed to keep it a secret. But it’s set her on a path to being healthier.</p>
      <p>“It was the kick-start I needed and it’s given me back my confidence.”</p>
      <p>Secret Body is on Thursday 14 December at 9pm on BBC Scotland.</p>
