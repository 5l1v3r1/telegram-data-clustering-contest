      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 14): The FBM KLCI remained firmly below the crucial 1,600-point level at the midday break, tracking regional markets as disappointing China economic data spooked investors.</p>
      <p>At 12.30pm, the FBM KLCI fell 2.63 points to 1,594.59.</p>
      <p>Losers outpaced gainers by 264 to 208, while 534 counters traded unchanged. Volume was 1.12 billion shares valued at RM690.77 million.</p>
      <p>The top losers included Nestle (M) Bhd, British American Tobacco (M) Bhd, Petronas Gas Bhd, Malaysian Pacific Industries Bhd, Panasonic Manufacturing Malaysia Bhd, Petronas Dagangan Bhd, Oriental Holdings Bhd, Hap Seng Consolidated Bhd and Hong Leong Financial Group Bhd.</p>
      <p>The actives included Sapura Energy Bhd, NetX Holdings Bhd, XOX Bhd, Tanco Holdings Bhd, Spring Art Holdings Bhd, IFCA MSC Bhd, JAKS Resources Bhd and Malayan Flour Mills Bhd.</p>
      <p>The gainers included Heineken Malaysia Bhd, KLCC Property Holdings Bhd, Bintulu Port Holdings Bhd, Carlsberg Brewery Malaysia Bhd, JAKS, KKB Engineering Bhd, Genting Bhd and Kumpulan Powernet Bhd.</p>
      <p>Asian stocks fell on Thursday after soft Chinese economic data showed the trade war between Beijing and Washington hitting growth in the world's second-largest economy, according to <i>Reuters</i>.</p>
      <p>MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan, which had drifted into positive territory in morning trade, turned negative to trade 0.4% lower, it said.</p>
      <p>Affin Hwang Capital Research said the FBM KLCI Index turned lower in yesterday's session, dropping 12.51 points or 0.78%, closing at 1,597.22.</p>
      <p>It said the index has retraced to below the 1,600 level, from the 1,615 immediate resistance, in yesterday's session, erasing the gains made the past week and a half.</p>
      <p>"It seems that current market behaviour looks to be waiting for opportunities to sell on strength and also indicating the lack of fresh buying. Hence, we may see the index drift lower from current levels.</p>
      <p>"Technical relief rebound in progress," it said.</p>
