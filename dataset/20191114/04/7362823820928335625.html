      <p>Some <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/georgia">Atlanta</a> homeowners filled with holiday spirit decided to fill a troublesome pothole this week using a lighted, decorated <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/special/occasions/christmas">Christmas</a> tree -- in hopes that their stunt might galvanize city officials to more permanently fix the problem.</p>
      <p>“Instead of being negative and screaming and stomping our feet and being ugly about it, why not have fun with it -- and still get attention and get the job done so it’s not so dangerous for the neighborhood?,” Archwood Drive neighbor Sharon Magruder told Atlanta's WGCL-TV.</p>

      <p>Neighbors in the area gathered around the pothole tree to harmonize a parody version of the popular Christmas carol, "O Christmas Tree."</p>
      <p>"O, Archwood Tree, O Archwood Tree," they sang, "how scary is that sinkhole?</p>
      <p>“Oh Archwood tree, Oh Archwood tree, when will our street be pothole-free?”</p>

      <p>The city took notice and came out to temporarily fill the pothole Wednesday until they can fix it permanently.
