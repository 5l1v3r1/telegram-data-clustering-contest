      <p>Seahawks backup quarterback Geno Smith's call during the overtime coin toss in Seattle's <a href="https://www.kiro7.com/news/photos-seahawks-vs-49ers-on-nov-11-2019/1007554677">Monday night win over the San Francisco 49ers</a> has people divided. </p>

      <p>Seahawks head coach Pete Carroll was even asked about the call at his Tuesday press conference: </p>
      <p>"It didn't sound like heads when you watch the TV copy. Both the official and Richard [Sherman], they didn't have anything (to say). Richard would've griped, I would think. He would for sure if he heard something different than what happened. I'm going with that more than anything," <a href="https://www.seahawksmedia.com/transcripts/carroll-pete-11-12-19/">Carroll said</a>. </p>
      <p>Even though the Seahawks won the toss and received the ball, their opening drive ended in a Russell Wilson interception in the red zone. </p>
      <p>The 49ers had two drives in overtime before Jason Myers <a href="https://www.kiro7.com/news/local/heads-or-tails-overtime-coin-toss-on-monday-night-football-sparks-online-debate/1008215375">eventually</a> kicked a game-winning 42-yard field goal to give the Seahawks a win. </p>
      <p>The Seahawks are now 2-0 in overtime games this season.</p>
      <p>Seattle has a bye this week and will travel to Philadelphia to play the Eagles on Nov. 24. </p>
