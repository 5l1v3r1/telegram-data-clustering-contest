      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T04:30:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">Jeremy Armstrong, Gerard Couzens</a></address>
      <p>Former <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/english-premier-league">Premier League</a> star ­Faustino Asprilla has told how he stopped a rival player being killed by a Pablo Escobar hitman.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Newcastle United</a> legend claimed the drug baron’s feared gang had offered to murder ­Paraguay ­goalkeeper Jose Luis Chilavert.</p>
      <p>It came after Colombian Asprilla had a fight with the goalie during a 1997 World Cup qualifier in Paraguayan capital Asuncion.</p>
      <p>The 50-year-old said he got a call from assassin Julio Cesar Correa Valdes, dubbed Fierro, asking him to go to his hotel. He added: “When I arrived, he was with about 10 other people, all drunk and partying with Paraguayan women.</p>

      <p>“He said to me, ‘We need you to give us authorisation so two men here stay in as they want to go and kill Chilavert.’</p>
      <p>“I said, ‘What? Are you mad? You’re going to finish off Colombian football, that can’t happen. What happens on the pitch stays on the pitch’.”</p>
      <p>Asprilla, who was a Newcastle striker from 1996 to 1998, made the shock ­confession in a mini-series about his life on ­Colombian TV. Fierro was later killed by paramilitaries in the country.</p>
