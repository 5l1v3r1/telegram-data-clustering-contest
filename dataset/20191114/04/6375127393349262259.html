      <h3>Speedy probe on Iloilo pole fires sought. ILOILO City’s lone representative and a party-list representative in the House of Representatives asked the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) yesterday to conclude speedily the investigation into the complaint of Mayor Jerry Treñas against Panay Electric Co. (PECO) for its alleged failure to address the alleged numerous incidents of fire affecting its electricity poles.</h3>
      <p>Iloilo City Rep. Julienne Baronda said Mayor Treñas acted correctly in asking Malacanañg to investigate PECO and the supposed incidents of electricity pole fires that were allegedly caused by aged transformers or overloaded wires.</p>
      <p>Baronda said she was alarmed by the report of the Bureau of Fire Protection (BFP) that PECO’s failure to maintain the quality of its distribution equipment like transformers and the overloading of old electricity wires hanging in the city’s streets had caused nine incidents of fire in three days from October 19 to 21 alone.</p>
      <p>She pointed out that Mayor Treñas filed the complaint against PECO with the Office of the President after PECO repeatedly failed to act on Ilonggos’ complaint against its alleged electricity poles and exploding distribution assets.</p>
      <p>“The authorities must look into the matter with dispatch to avert any further fire incident,” Baronda said.</p>
      <p>Baronda said a formal ERC finding that PECO failed to maintain or replace its aged distribution equipment and electricity poles could be enough basis for ERC to cancel its two-year provisional Certificate of Public Necessity (CPCN) or permit to operate.</p>
      <p>PBA Party-list Rep. Jericho Jonas B. Nograles, vice-chairperson of the House committee on energy, said ERC should exercise its power and responsibility to protect consumer interests as requested by Mayor Treñas.</p>
      <p>He said the House leadership is closely monitoring the ERC investigation to ensure that of Ilonggos are protected by utilities like PECO.</p>
      <p>Peco failed to renew its legislative franchise after it expired last January 18.</p>
      <p>The House and the Senate both awarded the legislative franchise to operate as Iloilo City’s distribution utility to More Electric and Power Corp. (MORE) in December last year, ending PECO’s 95-year-monopoly in electricity distribution in the city.</p>
      <p>Under Republic Act No. 11212 which gave MORE the franchise, the ERC was authorized to issue PECO a two-year CPCN to ensure continuous electricity supply in the city until MORE completes the transition to full takeover as Iloilo City’s electricity utility.</p>
      <p>In a resolution it issued in 2008 on the issuance of CPCNs to distribution utilities, the ERC required all recipients of the permit to strictly follow the standards set under the Philippine Distribution Code and the Philippine Grid Code, including those that concern public safety and the quality of their equipment or face revocation of their CPCN.</p>
      <p>Baronda noted that prior to the passage by both the House and the Senate of MORE’s legislative franchise, the Department of Energy and the ERC gave assurance that the DOE was ready with a contingency plan that involved the National Electrification Administration (NEA) taking over Iloilo City’s electricity distribution network from PECO until MORE completes its takeover.</p>
      <p>A legal battle had been waged by PECO to stop MORE from taking over its distribution assets in the city after rejecting an almost P500 million offer by MORE for its aged facilities.</p>
      <p>MORE has vowed to spend at least P1.7 billion in the next three years in modernizing Iloilo’s electricity transmission system to ensure it would provide local residents and businesses efficient and safe electricity supply.</p>
      <p>Majority of the complaints received by the House and the Senate before deciding to junk PECO’s application for the renewal of its franchise were the incidents of fire or falling transmission wires that threatened the safety of Ilonggos. </p>
