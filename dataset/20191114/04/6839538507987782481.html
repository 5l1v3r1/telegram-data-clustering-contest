      <p>Kiss’ planned tour of Australia has been cancelled after front man Paul Stanley developed a throat infection.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, the tour’s first show in Perth was rescheduled to the end of the run after doctors advised Stanley he needed to rest after a bad case of influenza.</p>
      <p>But an additional throat infection has quashed hopes the End of the Road tour could get off the ground at all, with doctors now saying he needs complete vocal rest for at least two weeks and possibly longer.</p>
      <p>It was to be the band’s final tour after a 45-year career and was promoted as their biggest show yet.</p>
      <p>In a statement on the Ticketek website, concert promoters TEG Live and One World Entertainment apologised for the cancellation.</p>
      <p>“Earlier this week it was announced that U.S doctors had advised Paul Stanley to rest due to a bad case of influenza, prompting the rescheduling of the tour’s first show in Perth to the end of the run and the cancellation of New Zealand.</p>
      <p>“It was hoped the extra few days rest would allow Stanley the chance for a complete recovery so the tour could proceed as planned.</p>
      <p>“However unfortunately this has not occurred. Stanley has an additional infection in his throat requiring complete vocal rest and medication for at least two weeks and possibly longer.”</p>
      <p>Tickets purchased by credit or debit card will be refunded in full within 10 working days.</p>
