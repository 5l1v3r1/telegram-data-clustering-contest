      <h2>Ray "Jeff" Cromartie, 52, was put to death for murdering shop owner Richard Slysz in Georgia, USA, in 1994 before fleeing with two 12-packs of beer - and he ordered a gigantic last meal before his execution</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T04:23:49+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 04:23</time> by <a rel="author">Bradley Jolly, Matthew Dresch, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/bradley-jolly/, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matthew-dresch/</a></address>
      <p>Death row inmate Ray "Jeff" Cromartie has been executed for gunning down a shop owner during a robbery.</p>
      <p>Cromartie, 52, had always admitted he and his co-defendant Corey Clark were guilty of the raid, but claimed neither he or his pal knew who pulled the trigger to shoot Richard Slysz in Georgia, USA, in 1994.</p>
      <p>Cromartie was originally scheduled to die on October 30 but his execution was delayed as an appeal was still pending with Georgia's Supreme Court.</p>
      <p>However, his argument was dismissed and he died by lethal injection at 10.59pm local time in Georgia Diagnostic Prison today.</p>

      <p>He declined to make a final statement.</p>
      <p>His last meal - the second he has had - consisted of macaroni and cheese, steak, rice and gravy, a steak and cheese sandwich, a double cheeseburger, French fries, a side of ranch dressing, a strawberry milkshake and layered cake with white icing.</p>

      <p>He had a previous last meal in October before his execution was delayed.</p>
      <p>Mr Slysz, 50, was murdered at Junior Food Store in Thomasville, near the Florida border.</p>
      <p>But Clark and getaway driver, Thad Lucas, were both cleared of murder charges.</p>
      <p>They were imprisoned for the roles in the heist but released in the early 2000s.</p>
      <p>Speaking previously after Cromartie made his appeal, Melven Johnson, of the Thomasville Police Department, said: "A jury has found him guilty and sentenced him to death.</p>

      <p>"I think to give these families and this victim some satisfaction and let them get this off their minds, it needs to happen."</p>
      <p>In April 1994, Cromartie borrowed a gun from his cousin and went to the Madison Street Deli in Thomasville and shot and wounded store clerk, Dan Wilson, in the face, court papers said.</p>
      <p>Three days later, Cromartie and his friends Corey Clark and Thaddeus Lucas went to Junior Food Store in Thomasville, Georgia to steal beer.</p>
      <p>When they entered the store, Cromartie shot Mr Slysz twice in the head, killing him, prosecutors said.</p>
      <p>The two criminals then tried to open the cash register but were unsuccessful.</p>
      <p>Cromartie took two 12-packs of Budweiser beer and the men fled, according to court papers.</p>
      <p>He is the third person to be executed in Georgia this year.</p>
