        <b>The SoftBank-backed Yahoo and South Korea's Naver-owned Line would become the dominant mobile payment service provider in Japan if the deal pulls through.</b>
      </p>
      <p>SoftBank is planning to consolidate Yahoo Japan with messaging app provider Line, <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Business-deals/SoftBank-backed-Yahoo-to-merge-with-Line-app">according to <i>Nikkei</i></a>.  <br/><br/>The Japanese telecom giant, which owns 45% of Yahoo Japan's parent company Z Holdings, and South Korean internet company Naver, which owns 73% of <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/qualcomm-and-line-team-up-for-clova-ai-platform/">Line</a>, are in the final stages of negotiations for a merger. The two companies are aiming to reach a basic agreement by the end of the month, the media reports.  <br/><br/>One proposal is for SoftBank and Naver to form a new 50-50 venture that would become the top shareholder of Z Holdings. Yahoo Japan and Line would then become separate wholly-owned subsidiaries of Z Holdings. <br/><br/>Z Holdings will remain listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. <br/><br/>Tokyo-based Line is the most popular chat app in Japan and the second most popular one in South Korea. <br/><br/>Z Holdings hopes to bolster services like mobile payments, e-commerce, and a news-search engine through the deal, Nikkei said. <br/><br/>The plan would be similar to that of chat app services like <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/wechat-pay-follows-alipay-in-allowing-foreign-visitors-to-make-payments-in-china/">Tencent of China</a> with WeChat and <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/sk-telecom-and-kakao-enter-share-exchange-for-5g-partnership/">Kakao of South Korea</a> with Kakao Talk that have integrated payment services, social media, and e-commerce to their platforms. The combined entity would boast a user base totalling 100 million people and become the dominant mobile payment service provider in Japan, <i>Nikkei</i> said. <br/><br/>"Line is reviewing various ways to increase the value of the company," a Line spokesperson told ZDNet. "What has been reported is among one of them but nothing has been decided yet."</p>
