      <h1>Reserve Bank says Lindsay Jenkin is leaving, while a new Assistant Governor role will be created in Auckland</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T04:02:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 04:02</time> by <a rel="author">David Hargreaves</a></address>
      <p>The Reserve Bank says that Assistant Governor <b><a href="https://www.rbnz.govt.nz/about-us/organisation-chart-and-senior-management/lindsay-jenkin">Lindsay Jenkin</a></b>, who has been with the bank since 2007, but in her current role for just under a year, is leaving.</p>
      <p>Jenkin was <b><a href="https://www.rbnz.govt.nz/news/2018/11/rbnz-to-establish-new-senior-leadership-team">announced as an Assistant Governor</a></b> as part of a re-organisation and new leadership team late last year. She took up her current role in December 2018.</p>
      <p>A statement from the RBNZ said the bank was creating a new Auckland-based Assistant Governor position "to lead the Bank’s ambitious growth and transformation work, and further develop its people and culture".</p>
      <p>The RBNZ says recruitment for the new role "will begin later this year".</p>
      <p>As a result of the new position, the Assistant Governor/General Manager of People and Culture, currently held by Jenkin, will be "disestablished".</p>
      <p>RBNZ Governor Adrian Orr says Jenkin supports the new role’s purpose, but will not take up the Auckland-based role.</p>
      <p>“Lindsay has made an incredibly valuable contribution to the Reserve Bank’s success over many years, and remains a significant support of the Bank and its vision. She will leave the Bank with my and Board’s full support, respect, and friendship.”</p>
      <p>The new role - Assistant Governor/General Manager, Transformation and People - will be responsible for all people and culture, growth and transformation work, as well as building the Bank’s Auckland presence.</p>
      <p>Orr says the structural change will support the Bank’s growth and transformation plans, particularly in Auckland.</p>
      <p>“As we explained in our Statement of Intent, we have a vision of ‘Great Team, Best Central Bank’. This means growing our Auckland presence, better connecting with our stakeholders, and building a culture which supports transformation and achievement.”</p>
