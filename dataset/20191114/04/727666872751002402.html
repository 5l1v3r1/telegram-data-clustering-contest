      <p>Cardi B has suggested that Nicki Minaj can make things right between the two of them!</p>
      <p><b>(AllHipHop Rumors) </b>Cardi B and Nicki Minaj continue to be on the tip of our tongues at all time. I mean, I want to get away from them, but people still want to read about it. Now, I read the comments. Some people have complained, but there is a silent contingency that reads this stuff and I am the conduit! Here is the latest!</p>
      <p>Cardi B had suggested on IG that she wants SOMEBODY to apologize to her so they can leave all that beef and shade in 2019. Now, think about this. Cardi B has been seemingly really happy this year. Her man doesn't have any rumors of infidelity. Her baby is healthy. She really seems to be in a good space. The only thing that is outright negative...is Nicki Minaj. Now, some of this could be her own fault. Just the other day, she poked at Nicki over a song, where she was allegedly offered a guest feature before her adversary. She took it back, but she still pulled up on one of the male Barbz right in Times Square. </p>
      <p>Look at this and you tell me ANYBODY else that she could be referring to. </p>
      <p>That's right...she said, “I don’t want to end this year on bad terms with anyone. Apologize to me.” Nicki won't go for that tone! </p>
      <p>I really believe this is all a game and we are unwitting participants...well some very willing. LOL! </p>
