      <p>As expected, Motorola today officially announced the new razr foldable smartphone. The new razr opens and closes like a classic flip phone.</p>
      <p>The zero-gap hinge in the razr enables it to close with both sides perfectly flush. The touch-enabled Quick View display on the outside of the device will allow users to do several interctions like playing music, taking selfies, checking notifications and more—all without ever opening your phone. The two displays work together. The content you see on Quick View will move to the larger Flex View display the moment you flip open.</p>
      <p>The razr is powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 710 processor and 128 GB of storage. The device is also water-repellent making it more durable. Like other Motorola smartphones, razr runs on pure Android experience.</p>
