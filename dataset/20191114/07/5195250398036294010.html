      <h1>New-Gen Maruti Ertiga, XL6 Sales Cross 1 Lakh Units In 12 Months</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T07:00:33+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 07:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://gaadiwaadi.com/author/surendharm/" target="_blank">Surendhar M</a></address>
      <h3>The second-generation Maruti Suzuki Ertiga and recently launched XL6 have combined to register 1,02,935 units over this past one year</h3>
      <p>The Ertiga is one of the top-sellers for Maruti Suzuki in the better part of this decade and it put a lot of pressure on the new generation model before its arrival late last year. The biggest carmaker in the country utilised the popularity of the nameplate and brought in a host of updates.</p>
      <p>The second-generation Ertiga, based on the lightweight Heartect platform unlike its predecessor, gained premium revisions on the inside as well as out. Despite the sales slowdown that shook the auto industry over the last year, the Ertiga’s numbers fared quite impressively compared to other models within the lineup.</p>
      <p>The Ertiga is priced between Rs.7.55 lakh and Rs. 11.29 lakh (ex-showroom) and it has averaged more than 7,700 units over its tenure in the past 12 months. In July 2019, 9,222 units of the MPV were retailed and it was the highest monthly tally thus far.</p>

      <p>Between November 2018 and October 2019, Maruti Suzuki sold 92,411 units of the Ertiga domestically. Taking advantage of its good reception among family-oriented customers, Maruti Suzuki expanded its range by introducing the more upscale XL6 in August 2019.</p>
