      <h1>Newborn babies at Pittsburgh hospital dressed up as Mr. Rogers for Cardigan Day</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T07:36:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 07:36</time> by <a rel="author">Alaa Elassar, CNN</a></address>
      <p>You know its a beautiful day in the neighborhood when you're surrounded by cute, snuggly babies. Babies in cardigans, to be exact.</p>
      <p>In celebration of World Kindness Day, Allegheny Health Network's West Penn Hospital in Pittsburgh dressed up their newborns in cardigans and ties.</p>
      <p>"In Pittsburgh, we are also celebrating Cardigan Day, in honor of Pittsburgher Fred Rogers, who modeled kindness and compassion to children," Stephanie Waite, a spokesperson for the Allegheny Health Network, told CNN.</p>
      <p>The adorable costumes were inspired by the iconic Mister Rogers, who hosted the children's television show "Mister Rogers' Neighborhood," often while wearing his red cardigan and tie.</p>
      <p>"At AHN, we wanted to join in the spirit of kindness with our most adorable ambassadors, our newborn babies," Waite said.</p>
      <p>Parents were able to watch their babies from the nursery window as nurses dressed them up in their costumes and photographed them.</p>
      <p>According to Waite, West Penn, one of the network's eight hospitals and home to their biggest birthing center, often dresses up newborn babies for holidays and special occasions.</p>
      <p>"We always get such a positive reaction to the photos -- the babies are so adorable," Waite said. "It puts a guaranteed smile on everyone's face."</p>
      <p>After the photo shoot, parents got to keep the photos and costumes -- cardigan and tie included.</p>
      <p>A new <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/11/entertainment/tom-hanks-mister-rogers/index.html">film</a> about Mister Rogers, "A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood," starring Tom Hanks, is set to premiere November 22.</p>
