      <p>A delivery driver has been savagely beaten in a harrowing attack by a car-jacker in the Midlands.</p>
      <p>Gerald Wallbanks may now need facial surgery after he was left bloodied, battered and bruised.</p>
      <p>Mr Wallbanks has told how he was viciously attacked by a violent car-jacker after dropping off a Mercedes at a customer's house, reports <a href="https://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/news/stoke-on-trent-news/there-blood-rushing-down-face-3532648">StokeonTrentLive.</a></p>
      <p>The Blurton resident, aged 58, suffered a cracked cheekbone and broken eye socket during Monday's incident.</p>
      <p>He was rushed to the Royal Stoke University Hospital, in Staffs, following the attack and may now need facial surgery.</p>

      <p>Gerald, of Blurton, said: "I was delivering the Mercedes and sat outside the customer's house. I went to open the door and just started receiving punches.</p>
      <p>"It was a housing estate and it was hailing so I was being slow with the paperwork hoping it would pass.</p>
      <p>"I couldn't even see the person approaching me. The doctors told me he might have been using a knuckle-duster because the damage is that bad."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The attack happened in Melton Close, Congleton, at 4.26pm on Monday, November 11. It was witnessed by Gerald's colleague. The car-jacker fled empty-handed.</p>
      <p>Gerald added: "My colleague was parked 20 metres away - because we work in twos - and just saw a figure throwing punches at me. He went to chase them but saw blood rushing down my face.</p>
      <p>"It was a devastating attack and I was left shocked."</p>

      <p>Gerald is currently signed off work and says he will be more vigilant of potential car-jackings when delivering vehicles.</p>
      <p>He added: "I've never been in anything like this, I've had a few fights but have always fought back.</p>
      <p>"It's always going to stay with me and I think I will look around before I open the door in the future - I will be a bit more vigilant now.</p>
      <p>"I'm hoping that other people can learn from this. If I can stop one other old guy falling victim to this then these people will be losing."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Police have recorded 86 violent crimes and 11 vehicle crimes across Congleton in the past month. They have issued a description of the would-be car-jacker.</p>
      <p>A Cheshire Police spokesman said: "The offender is described as being 5ft 8in tall. He was wearing a black bubble coat with the hood up and black trousers. His face was covered with a scarf or balaclava."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Witnesses should call the police on 101, quoting incident number 562638.</p>
