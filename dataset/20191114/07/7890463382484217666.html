      <h1>You expected a Jojo Minecraft mod, but it was me, Dio!</h1>

        <b>There are two constants in this world of inescapable, ever-changing memes: Minecraft and Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure. Now we can put our chocolate with our peanut butter, thanks to the latest in <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/minecraft/twenty-best-minecraft-mods">Minecraft mods</a>. A full Jojo texture pack transforms the world of the block builder into, er, ZA WARUDO of the block-builder.</b>
      </p>
      <p>All the basics are covered – diamonds and their resulting equipment transform into Crazy Diamond variants. Emeralds are Hierophant Green. Ender pearls are The Hand. Flint and steel bring their fire-making power to Magician’s Red. Mobs get the treatment too – Creepers become Killer Queen, Husks turn into Diavolo, and you thought they were zombies, but it was him, Dio!</p>
      <p>Item names naturally get changed to match all the new aesthetics, and there are more extensive cosmetic changes, too. The main menu gets a facelift with loads of Jojo art along with messages like “ora ora” and “yare yare daze,” and a selection of music disks now play tracks from the show.</p>
      <p>You can grab the mod through <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/jojos-bizarre-pack">CurseForge</a>.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/minecraft/minecraft-player-count">Minecraft player count</a> continues to reach frankly absurd highs, so there’s likely no limit to the types of ridiculous <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/minecraft/the-100-best-minecraft-skins">Minecraft skins</a> you can don in the future.</p>
