      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: Mercedes make their debut in Formula E next week as they join the most competitive grid in world motorsport in an exciting new era for F1's power brokers</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T07:05:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 07:05</time> by <a rel="author">Aaron Flanagan, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/aaron-flanagan/</a></address>
      <p>Ian James admits he is living a “childhood dream” as he leads Mercedes into a new era of motorsport.</p>
      <p>F1 juggernauts Mercedes make their bow in <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/formula-e">Formula E</a> at next week’s season opener in Saudi Arabia, as they look to take their success from Grands Prix to E-Prix. </p>
      <p>James has been something of an unsung hero in Mercedes motorsport, having been instrumental in the reintroduction of KERS in F1 in 2011, leading to Mercedes’ first race win since 1955 - and then the development of the power units that led to 2014 and 2015 world titles and subsequent success that has followed.</p>
      <p>But now James comes out from behind the shadows and leads Mercedes into an exciting new electric world. He puts on a professional face, but the giddiness is clear for all to see.</p>

      <p>“It has been an incredibly varied career so far but this is the culmination of a childhood dream,” said James. </p>
      <p>“To be able to on one side get back into motorsport and with something as exciting and as cutting edge as Formula E, but at the same time, in a truer sense of the word, start up a start-up organisation and bring the necessary ingredients together is something that comes along very seldom.</p>
      <p>“As cheesy as it might sound, it really is a once in a lifetime opportunity.”</p>
      <p>James, 42, has worked his way through the ranks in a 15-year career with Mercedes, which has seen him live in Germany - learning the language on the job - and Alabama, United States. </p>
      <p>The Coventry University graduate is now back in the UK, living alongside his wife Claire and two children, Cameron, 10, and Chloe, 8.</p>

      <p>But he knows there will be no home comforts as he faces the busiest period of his career. </p>
      <p>Despite his new job title, James refuses to be known as the Toto Wolff of Formula E - because the F1 chief is very much down the end of the phone keeping him in check.</p>
      <p>“Since I have come on board, we have struck quite a nice balance between him being there for advice when needed and really acting as a consultant for any of the key issues that we have.</p>
      <p>“But at the same time, he has left me to my own devices and let me make my own mistakes along the way. </p>
      <p>“I have no doubt that on WhatsApp and other media, he will definitely be keeping me on my toes!”</p>
