      <p>Young’s pub chain blamed “poor and unpredictable weather” for a fall in profit in its latest half-year results today, but still raised its interim dividend to book its 23rd consecutive rise.</p>

      </p>
      <h3>The figures</h3>
      <p><b>Profit before tax dropped</b> 6.4 per cent year on year to <b>£24.3m</b> in the six months to the end of September.</p>
      <p>That fall came despite a 7.3 per cent <b>increase in revenue</b> to <b>£168.2m</b>, compared to the same period a year ago.</p>
      <p><b>Net debt rocketed</b> 23.6 per cent to <b>£227.2m</b> as <b>net cash flow rose</b> £3m to <b>£37.7m</b> year on year.</p>
      <p><b>Basic earnings per share fell </b>8.3 oer cent to <b>38.16p</b>, down from last year’s 42.5p.</p>
      <p>But Young’s still <b>hiked its interim dividend</b> six per cent to <b>10.57p per share</b>.</p>
      <h3>Why it’s interesting</h3>
      <p>Young’s CEO Patrick Dardis said his company had recovered from a weak start to the year as “poor and uncpredictable weather was a far cry from last year’s exceptional early summer sunshine”.</p>
      <p>But the May bank holiday weather and a warm September helped like-for-like sales rise 1.1 per cent over the period.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Last year the World Cup helped Young’s post strong summer gains, and Dardis said Young’s had struggled to keep pace with those tough comparative sales.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile net debt climbed as Young’s was forced to recognise an extra £72.2m in lease liabilities under a change in accounting rules.</p>
      <h3>What Young’s said</h3>
      <p>CEO Patrick Dardis said:</p>
      <blockquote>I am very pleased with the performance of our business during the first half of the year. In what was a challenging period up against tough comparatives, we continued to grow profits, make acquisitions, invest organically and increase the dividend: a reflection of the consistent execution of our strategy and the hard work of our teams throughout those six months.<br/><br/>The start of the half year was challenging as the poor and unpredictable weather was a far cry from last year’s exceptional early summer sunshine. However, the summer Bank Holiday temperatures and late-September sunshine contributed to strong like-for-like sales growth in the second 13 weeks which helped to balance the first half, with like-for-like sales finishing up 1.1%.<br/><br/>We have added the White Bear, a freehold pub in Tunbridge Wells, into our managed house estate and continue to seek out the right opportunities in exciting new locations where we believe our premium offer will flourish.<br/><br/>Although the upcoming general election prolongs the unpredictability of the political environment, it does not change our approach or confidence in our winning strategy of running high-quality, well-invested premium pubs.<br/><br/>Our expectations for the full year remain unchanged and we remain confident in our ability to deliver long-term growth and sustainable superior investor returns.</blockquote>
