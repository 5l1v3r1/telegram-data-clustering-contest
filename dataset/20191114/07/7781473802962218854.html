      <h1>2020 Honda City to debut in Thailand on November 25</h1>

      <p>The next-generation <a href="http://overdrive.in/cars/honda/city-m58/">Honda City</a>, set for an India debut around the beginning of next year, will be unveiled in Thailand on November 25. The highlight for this generation is that a hybrid version will be available. We think it could be a version of Honda's eHEV two-motor hybrid system. The eHEV is a new nomenclature for all of Honda's electrification efforts in both the two and four-wheeler space. Also, some level of connected car tech can also be expected.</p>

      <p><a href="http://overdrive.in/news-cars-auto/next-generation-2020-honda-city-global-debut-in-november/">Spy photos have shown that big changes are in order.</a> The car seems to have grown a bit dimensionally and there seem to be chunkier bumpers and sharper panels at the rear. Also seen is a shark-fin antenna and a new multi-spoke alloy-wheel design. Further, the roofline seems to be a tad more swooping but still having a significant glass area. The look seems to have been inspired by that of the Civic and the low nose and sharp-faced look of that car seems to have been carried over.</p>
      <p>We expect the engine options to be close to that of the current car. Expect to find BSVI versions of the current 1.5-litre petrol and diesel engines under the hood, paired with either a six-speed manual or a CVT.</p>
