      <h3>‘Like if Nixon Had a TikTok’</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/13/us/politics/impeachment-hearings.html?module=inline">Public impeachment hearings kicked off in Washington on Wednesday</a>, with the top United States diplomat in Ukraine, William B. Taylor Jr., and a senior State Department official in charge of Ukraine policy, George P. Kent, testifying before the House Intelligence Committee.</p>

      <blockquote>“Today’s live testimony was as dramatic as it was historic. It was the biggest ratings hit for C-SPAN 3 since ‘Drunk History’ starring Brett Kavanaugh.” <i>— STEPHEN COLBERT<br/></i><br/><br/>“Today was the first time in over 20 years that Congress has held a public impeachment hearing. And if this one is anything like the last one, Trump will be impeached, then be acquitted in the Senate, and then in 20 years, his wife will lose an election to some idiot.” <i>— SETH MEYERS<br/></i><br/><br/>“Today the new evidence against President Trump was called ‘damning.’ Some say this could end his presidency. No, wait I’m sorry — this joke is from two years ago. That joke is also from one year ago — and six months ago. We have — we’ve used that cue card, like, 15 times.” <i>— CONAN O’BRIEN</i></blockquote>
      <p>Taylor testified that a member of his staff overheard Trump on a phone conversation with Gordon Sondland in which the president asked about “the investigations,” with Mr. Sondland responding that Ukraine was “ready to move forward” with them.</p>
      <blockquote>“‘Unexplainable, illogical, crazy’ — that’s the description Bill Taylor gave of Trump’s actions. It’s also the title of Trump’s new memoir. Same thing, yes. <i>[Imitating Trump]</i> It’s my full story and it’s a coloring book, folks. You’re gonna love it.” <i>— TREVOR NOAH<br/></i><br/><br/>“O.K., this is just unbelievable. Trump’s people were discussing their Ukrainian plot in public in a restaurant — that’s what he’s saying. I mean, first of all, that is rude. You are in a restaurant, you put your phone away; you engage.” <i>— TREVOR NOAH<br/></i><br/><br/>“A good criminal would call and say, ‘Are you alone?’ Trump would say, ‘Are you alone? If not, go find some people to stand next to. Put me on speaker phone — this is a doozy.’” <i>— SETH MEYERS<br/></i><br/><br/>"So this staffer overheard Trump asking about a foreign nation investigating his political opponent. That’s like if they had a picture of Nixon breaking into the Watergate.” <i>— STEPHEN COLBERT</i></blockquote>
      <blockquote>“This is big news because it appears to confirm that Trump knew about the attempt to pressure Ukraine to investigate the Bidens, which is the first time we’ve gotten hard confirmation of that since Trump himself. This is what these hearings are going to be like all the way through. Every bombshell will just be confirming things we already know. It will be like if, instead of a secret taping operation, Nixon had a TikTok.” <i>— SAMANTHA BEE</i></blockquote>
      <blockquote>“So Trump got caught before he could force Zelensky to do it. He failed, but the fact that he’s a bad criminal doesn’t make it not a crime. Because if being bad at something makes you not that thing, then Trump is not a business owner or a husband.” <i>— STEPHEN COLBERT</i></blockquote>
      <h3>The Punchiest Punchlines (a Joke, a Sham and a Hoax Edition)</h3>
      <blockquote>“The president called the hearing a joke, a sham and a hoax and he said he didn’t watch it. A White House spokesperson said the president was too busy working. Right. They might as well have said he was at a zumba class.” <i>— JIMMY KIMMEL</i></blockquote>
      <blockquote>“When asked what he was doing, Trump said, ‘I was cleaning out my desk.’” <i>— CONAN O’BRIEN<br/></i><br/><br/>“There’s no way you were too busy to watch. Trump watches T.V. all the time. I’m shocked there wasn’t a T.V. next to him while he was answering that question.” <i>— SETH MEYERS</i></blockquote>
      <blockquote>“Trump wanted to, but he threw his T.V. remote out the window when he wasn’t named People magazine’s ‘sexiest man of the year.’” <i>— JIMMY FALLON<br/></i><br/><br/>“Also those hearings he didn’t watch? He doesn’t like the cast.” <i>— SAMANTHA BEE</i></blockquote>
      <blockquote><i>”</i>President Trump criticized the use of outside counsel for questioning at today’s impeachment hearing, saying, ‘I see they’re using lawyers that are television lawyers. They took some guys off television.’ Which is ironic, because Trump would love to take one of his lawyers off television.” <i>— SETH MEYERS</i></blockquote>
