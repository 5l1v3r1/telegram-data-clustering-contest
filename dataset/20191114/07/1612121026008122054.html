      <p>The iconic <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/tag/motorola-razr/">Motorola RAZR</a> is back, firing shots over Samsung’s bow as a foldable phone that folds completely flat and without a conspicuous crease. Comparable to the Samsung <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/tag/galaxy-fold/">Galaxy Fold’s</a> AT&amp;T exclusivity, the foldable RAZR is exclusive to Verizon, although there won’t be an unlocked option this time. If you’re itching to get one, you’ll have to wait a couple of months and drop $1,500, but the novelty factor and high dose of nostalgia might be worth it.</p>

      <p>The phone is surprisingly faithful to the original Motorola RAZR from 15 years ago with similar dimensions and outward appearance. The similarities end there, however, as the basic functionality and physical keys of the original are replaced with a modern Android OS and single pOLED panel inside (from <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/tag/tcl/">TCL</a>). Unfolded, you’re looking at a 6.2-inch screen with a tall 21:9 aspect ratio (same as the recent Sony devices) sporting an HD resolution of 2142 x 876. When snapped close, a second external 2.7-inch gOLED display has a 4:3 aspect ratio and resolution of 600 x 800.</p>

      <p>Taking note of Samsung’s design flaws, the hinge is capped and protected like the re-released Galaxy Fold, and two protective layers cover the pOLED panel to help prevent scratches and dings. As noted by many who went hands on with the device recently (there was an earlier event before the advertised November 13th one), you can’t tell that the screen folds when open. This is a huge step up from the efforts of Samsung and Huawei (foldable <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/tag/mate-x/">Mate X</a>), where that definitely isn’t the case. Creases and ripples abound.</p>
      <p>The frame is stainless steel and although there’s no official IP rating, Motorola says its splash proof thanks to it’s well established nano-coating. Again, that’s a big upgrade over the Galaxy Fold that has no water resistance whatsoever. The form factor is a first for foldable phones as well, opening into a conventional smartphone and shutting like a flip phone from the good old days. You’re not getting the benefit of a phone/tablet combo like the Galaxy Fold, but that’s not the point of the RAZR. And I suspect more will like this concept.</p>

      <p>Many of the specs are mid-range as this is all about the form factor, but despite the $1,500 price tag, it’s not a flagship device. And that’s important to keep in mind. It has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 710 processor (the Galaxy Fold has a Snapdragon 855), 2,510mAh battery, 128GB of internal storage (not expandable), 6GB of RAM, a single 16MP main camera (apparently the same as on the OnePlus 6) and 5MP selfie camera. The main camera is on the front when folded and can be used for selfies on the small screen, which is cool. There’s also no wireless charging or external SIM tray (eSIM only), so if you take a Verizon unit to another carrier, they have to support the eSIM tech. In fact, this is the first phone in the US to have it’s primary SIM an eSIM and not a replaceable SIM card. Motorola says that an unlocked Verizon unit has the necessary bands for both AT&amp;T and T-Mobile.</p>
      <p>The 2.7-inch external screen is called the Quick View display and allows for notifications, music, camera controls with the 16MP shooter and NFC payments. It’s actually similar to a smartwatch without an Android interface like the Galaxy Fold. That makes perfect sense as you’ll only want to do quick and easy tasks on the small screen, flipping it to a standard smartphone for the heavy lifting. A fingerprint scanner sits on the chin below the folded screen.</p>

      <p>The RAZR has been in development for quite awhile. Motorola started working with flexible displays back in 2015, while components were finalized in early 2018 and the final launch doesn’t come until early 2020. It launches with Android Pie, reinforcing that this has been worked on for a long time, but the company claims that Android 10 will land soon after launch.</p>
