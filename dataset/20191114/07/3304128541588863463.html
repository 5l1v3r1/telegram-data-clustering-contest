      <p>A US court has issued a warrant of arrest for a man of Kenyan descent for allegedly sexually assaulting a cellmate while being detained in the ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) section of the York county jail in February.</p>
      <p>Clifford Kamau Ibirithi, 34, is accused of sexually assaulting and choking a cellmate to unconsciousness.</p>
      <p>The victim recounted being unconscious for three minutes and when he came to, he was on the floor with his pants off.</p>

      <p>On the night of February 21, the victim said, he woke up to use the bathroom when he felt pressure on his neck and figured it was a choke-hold.</p>
      <p>But Ibirithi told the police that the act was consensual.</p>
      <p>Medical reports do however confirm that the fluids collected from the victim match DNA samples taken from the accused person.</p>
