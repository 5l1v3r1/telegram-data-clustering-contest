      <h1>Not leaving Tottenham till my contract expires, claims Danny Rose</h1>

        <b>With less than 18 months left on his current deal, Tottenham star Danny Rose has admitted that he will not leave the club till the summer of 2021. The 29-year-old was put on the transfer list during the summer but no move materialized and the full-back has managed to find a way back into the team.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 29-year-old defender played a large part in Tottenham’s run to the Champions League final last season but come the summer and Danny Rose found himself transfer listed. But no move materialized for the Englishman, despite links to PSG and Schalke with Tottenham eventually forced to keep him at the club. However, all has not hopeful well for Rose with Mauricio Pochettino giving the full-back a chance to make an impact.</p>
      <p>But in an interview, the former Leeds United star went on to admit that there were no bids for him in the summer and will only leave Tottenham once his contract expires. Rose also added that he was indeed placed on the transfer list by people upstairs at Tottenham and he will not consider a January move to anywhere despite having been incessantly linked with a move away.</p>
      <p>"It's pretty obvious what happened [in the summer]. People upstairs at Tottenham were trying to do what they were trying to do. I've said [to them] I've got 18 months left on my contract and I'm not going anywhere until my contract has ­finished. In January, you're probably going to hear something [about my future]. I'm telling you right now that I'm not going anywhere until my contract is finished,” Rose told the Evening Standard.</p>
      <p>"Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy told me in the summer there was no new contract for me at Tottenham, which is fine. I respect that. We move on. My contract is up in 18 months' time and I'll leave the football club then. People [in the media] can save their time ­trying to get stuff ready for January about me being sold. Because I can tell you now: it ain't happening. I know what people were trying to do in the summer... There were no bids — that was rubbish."</p>
      <p>While Rose’s future isn’t a big concern as he does have eighteen months left on his current contract, Tottenham will walk in the 2020 January window with a lot of problems. They face the prospect of losing Christian Eriksen, Toby Alderweireld, and Jan Vertonghen for next to nothing with the trio’s contract coming to an end. However, unlike the trio, Rose’s contract hasn’t affected his game time and the full-back went on to admit that when that changes, he’ll consider leaving the club.</p>
      <p>"When the manager stops calling me into his office, stops giving me advice, that's when I'll think it's time to leave Tottenham. But until then, I'm not going ­anywhere. I'm lucky to have a manager at Tottenham who, from the first day we met, has always stuck by me, regardless of anything, regardless of the rubbish in the media about me being sold or not part of his plans — all that nonsense,” concluded the 29-year-old.</p>
