      <p>Transport for London (TfL) urged commuters to use other routes to work during rush hour, saying London buses will accept their tickets.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile the incident led to the District Line being suspended between Edgware Road and High Street Kensington, with a good service on the rest of the line.</p>
      <p>The Jubilee Line was experiencing minor delays while engineers work to repair a “a fault on some of our trains”, according to TfL.</p>

      <p>Angry passengers took to Twitter to vent their frustration with the morning delays.</p>

      <p>Has this become the Bermuda Triangle of the London tube service?”</p>

      <p>Steven replied to the District Line’s Twitter update by saying: “Again and again and again …. when will you get on top of these repeated failures?”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile Lucy Rhodes added: “There seems to be a faulty train or signal issue most days at the moment. It is a real disruption to my commute. Why is this the case and are there any plans to tackle problems on the circle line?”</p>

      </p>
      <p>The RMT union said 1,000 cleaners could strike in a bid for a salary bump and pensions and sick pay.</p>
      <p>RMT general secretary Mick Cash warned: “The cleaners on the London Underground are key to keeping services moving – if a train is soiled by a member of the public it cannot move on until it has been cleaned and that happens more often than you would think.”</p>
