      <p>A double killer slashed a serial rapist - leaving him with a gaping wound from his forehead to his mouth - for stealing his <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/pornography">porn</a> DVDs in prison, a court heard.</p>
      <p>Krzysztof Gadecki, 40, fused razor blades into two pieces of plastic cutlery to create a shank that he used to attack Colin Mathieson, 42, at Glenochil Prison in Scotland.</p>
      <p>Mathieson suffered a six-inch gash from his forehead to his mouth on the left side of his face, a four-inch cut across his right cheek, a one-inch wound on his right heel and a 1.5-inch "gaping" injury on his right arm.</p>
      <p>The rapist needed 35 stitches to close his wounds in an attack that Gadecki says Mathieson brought on himself for taking his porn films and "being rude".</p>

      <p>Gadecki was jailed for life in 2017 with minimum terms of 26 years for fatally stabbing Holly Alexander, 37, and her partner Ronnie Kidd, 40, in their Dundee flat.</p>
      <p>Mathieson was jailed for life in 2001 after a judge ruled he was too dangerous to be allowed to live on the outside. He preyed on women alone in their homes.</p>
      <p>Speaking through an interpreter at Falkirk Sheriff Court, Gadecki disputed a prosecution account that he had initially lent Mathieson some DVDs.</p>
      <p>With a detachment described as “chilling” by seasoned court-watchers, he said: “I found that person in my cell. I caught him rummaging through my DVDs.</p>

      <p>“I told him to stop and he didn’t reply. </p>
      <p>“He was very rude and arrogant and extremely disrespectful to me and kept touching my stuff. </p>
      <p>“He took a whole box of 15 Polish DVDs and a couple of light porn movies as well. </p>
      <p>“I said to myself, ‘I’m not happy with it, maybe if I break his nose he’ll realise it’s a big deal to me’."</p>
      <p>He added: “I made the weapons with razor blades and plastic cutlery. It took me about 40 minutes to make them, and I went to his cell with the intention to hurt him.</p>

      <p>“For eight months nobody made me so angry as this guy. </p>
      <p>“He was lying on his bed and he was quite cheeky - he said ‘just take your stupid movies away’. </p>
      <p>“I punched him with a closed fist and headbutted him. He hit his head on the safety rail of his bed. </p>
      <p>“He was in the foetal position. I was on top of him and I pushed my knee between his arms and legs. </p>
      <p>“He said to me ‘Is that all you’ve got?’ so I pulled out both my weapons and I cut him. </p>
      <p>“Then I asked him, ‘Is that enough’?”</p>
      <p>Gadecki represented himself because he claimed there was “no point” getting a solicitor to defend him over the July 25, 2018, attack at the top security prison in  Clackmannanshire.</p>
      <p>The court heard Mathieson ran, streaming with blood, to warders.</p>
      <p>In hospital, medics inserted 18 stitches into the wound on the left hand side of his face, nine into the right side, six into his arm, and two into his heel. </p>
      <p>Gadecki admitted assaulting Mathieson to his severe injury and permanent disfigurement. He also admitted possessing three bladed weapons in jail - two modified plastic knives and a plastic spoon.</p>
      <p>He told Sheriff Derek Hamilton: “I’m concerned I’m not safe to be around.” </p>
      <p>Sheriff Hamilton sentenced Gadecki to a further 26 months imprisonment, to be served at the expiry of his 26-year life term. </p>
      <p>He said: “Such extreme violence in custody cannot go unrecognised.” </p>
      <p>Before he was led the cells, Gadecki turned and muttered to the interpreter.</p>
      <p>She said: “He says he’ll probably not live to see the end of his sentence, and if he does, things will have changed so much there’ll be no planes or buses and he will just be able to teleport himself back to his country."</p>
      <p>Gadecki had been jailed for rape, robbery and fraud in Poland, but was at liberty when he committed the murders having appealed against deportation. </p>
