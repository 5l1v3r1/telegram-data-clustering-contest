        <b>After a decade of Test cricket’s exile from Pakistan soil, it’s set to mark its return as Sri Lanka have agreed to tour the nation for a two-match Test series. The Lankans had recently toured, in September-October, Pakistan for a limited-overs series comprising three ODIs and as many T20Is. </b>
      </p>
      <p>The last time Pakistan hosted a Test on home soil was in March 2009, when the ghastly terrorist attack on the Sri Lankan team bus had occurred. Quite obviously, the nation was barred from hosting international cricket. But things look positive for them now after 10 years of waiting.</p>
      <p>After a second-string Sri Lankan side successfully completed a limited-overs tour on the soil of the estranged hosts, the visitors were quite impressed with the security arrangements there. The Sri Lanka Cricket Board has now agreed to tour Pakistan once again and this time it will be a Test encounter, comprising two games in the month of December. </p>
      <p>"We are pleased to confirm our return visit to Pakistan as, based on our earlier visit, we are comfortable and convinced conditions are suitable and conducive for Test cricket,” SLC chief executive Ashley de Silva revealed.</p>
      <p>"We also believe all cricket playing countries should host international cricket at home and in this relation we are happy to play our part in complete resumption of international cricket in Pakistan, which not only has a proud history but has been one of our biggest supporters in our early days as a cricket nation."</p>
      <p>The two-match Test series will be a part of the ongoing <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/tournament/icc">ICC</a> World Test Championship, in which India are leading by a mile. The first Test is scheduled to be played from December 11-15 at the Pindi Cricket Stadium in Rawalpindi, followed by which the National Stadium in Karachi will host the second Test from December 19-23. </p>
      <p>Director of Pakistan Cricket Board Zakir Khan announced the series officially on Thursday, November 14. He heavily praised Sri Lanka for agreeing to tour Pakistan one more time and promised high standards of security arrangements.</p>
      <p>"This is fabulous news for Pakistan and its reputation of being as safe and secure as any other country in the world. We are thankful to Sri Lanka Cricket for agreeing to send their team for the longer version of the game, which will contribute significantly in the PCB's efforts and drive for regular resumption of international cricket, and help in its endeavours of attracting new audiences and younger generation," Zakir Khan was quoted as saying by Cricbuzz.</p>
      <p>"Now that the itinerary has been confirmed, we will shift our focus on series preparations to ensure we deliver arrangements as per our very high standards. This series is part of our cricket celebrations and we will leave no stone unturned in putting up a show which is a memorable one for the players, officials, fans and media," he added.</p>
      <p>International cricket has been slowly regaining its footing in Pakistan since then, and the upcoming series will be a huge shot in the arm for PCB's bid to restore international cricket played in the country to normalcy.</p>
      <p>A second-string Sri Lanka side recently visited Pakistan for a limited-overs series, with the security measures in place during this tour impressing Sri Lanka Cricket and prompting them to give a green signal for the Test series. As per the original schedule, Sri Lanka were to play the Test matches in October and then come back to Pakistan in December for the limited-overs games but the swap for done to provide the visitors an opportunity to assess the situation.</p>
