      <p>Apple is considering bundling its subscription services as early as 2020, including Apple Music, Apple TV+, and Apple News+, according to <i><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-14/apple-mulls-bundling-digital-subscriptions-as-soon-as-2020">Bloomberg</a></i>.</p>

      <p>The report indicates that Apple has included a provision in its contract with Apple News+ publishers that permits Apple to bundle News+ with its other services if it desires. The monthly price of the bundle would presumably be lower than the cost of paying for each service separately in a bid to attract more subscribers. <br/><br/>Apple Music and Apple News+ each cost $9.99 per month in the United States, while Apple TV+ is $4.99 per month. <br/><br/>Apple is already experimenting with at least one services bundle. Last month, the company began offering <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/10/30/apple-musics-apple-tv-plus-5-a-month-bundle/">free access to Apple TV+ to students who subscribe to Apple Music</a>. The offer is available for a limited time only. <br/><br/>The report goes on to cite "some media executives" who said the amount of money they have received from Apple News+ so far has been less than expected. On the other hand, some executives are pleased with the service so far, including <i>Los Angeles Times</i> executive editor Norm Pearlstine.</p>
