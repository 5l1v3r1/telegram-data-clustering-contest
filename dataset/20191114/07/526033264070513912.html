      <p>A pair of Colorado Springs police officers will not face charges in connection with the fatal shooting of a black man in August.</p>
      <p>The decision was announced by Fourth Judicial District Attorney Dan May, who said body camera footage of the incident provided "the best view of an officer-involved shooting" he had ever seen, <a href="https://coloradosprings.gov/police-department/article/news/officer-involved-shooting-2100-block">according to police</a>.</p>
      <p>De’Von Bailey, 19, was shot Aug. 3 by officers investigating a report of an armed robbery. Body camera footage of the incident was reviewed by a grand jury, who found that the officers’ use of lethal force was justified because they had evidence leading them to believe Bailey was armed while he was fleeing, police said.</p>

      <p>The footage shows Bailey and another man with their hands up, as officers tell them they have a report of people matching their description with a gun. Officers inform the men that they are going to check them for weapons. Bailey then flees and appears to reach for his waistband, before officers fire on him.</p>
      <p>Bailey was shot three times in the back and was taken to the hospital, where he later died. The El Paso County Sheriff's Office said a weapon was recovered at the scene of the shooting.</p>
      <p>Bailey’s death prompted peaceful protests Colorado Springs, and his family called for an independent investigation into his death.</p>
      <p>A family representative said the family was disappointed by the district attorney's decision not to charge the officers.</p>
      <p>"It is certainly not a surprise when a tainted investigation is presented by a biased prosecutor," Bailey family attorney Mari Newman said after the announcement. "This is the exact reason why we have called for an independent investigation and an independent prosecution."</p>

      <p>It is not clear if the Bailey family will file a civil lawsuit or pursue any additional legal action in relation to the shooting.</p>
      <p>“We fully acknowledge that there has been confusion and frustration surrounding this incident,” Colorado Springs Police Chief Vince Niski said <a href="https://twitter.com/CSPDPIO/status/1194774659998322689/photo/1">in a statement</a> released after the announcement.</p>
      <p>He added that the shooting was investigated by an outside law enforcement agency -- the El Paso County Sheriff’s Office -- and that the results of their investigation led to the grand jury’s decision.</p>
      <p>The officers involved in Bailey’s shooting have not been identified.</p>
