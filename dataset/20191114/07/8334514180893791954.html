      <p>School and college shootings are rare in Russia which has strict gun laws, and it was not immediately clear what the shooter’s motive was.</p>
      <p>Investigators said the student opened fire with a hunting rifle at the college, which is located in the city of Blagoveshchensk, around 3,500 miles (5,600 km) east of Moscow near Russia’s border with China.</p>
      <p>He shot dead another 19-year-old male student, and three other students had been taken to hospital after receiving gunshot wounds, investigators said.</p>
      <p>One of the wounded was in a serious condition and was being operated on, the RIA news agency reported.</p>
      <p>Russia’s Investigative Committee opened a criminal case.</p>
      <p>Vasily Orlov, the governor of the Amur Region, described the incident as a tragedy.</p>
      <p>“I express my deep condolences to the relatives of the victims,” Orlov said in a statement on social media.</p>
      <p>“We will give them all necessary assistance. And I promise that from our side we will make sure we investigate why such an incident was possible in an educational institution.”</p>
      <p>In 2018, a teenager killed 19 people in another college shooting, in the Black Sea region of Crimea which Russia annexed from Ukraine, before also killing himself.</p>
      <p>And in October, a Russian conscript shot dead eight fellow soldiers in Russia’s Far East.</p>
