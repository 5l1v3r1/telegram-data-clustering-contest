      <p>This year’s <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/reviews/john-lewis-christmas-advert-2017-review-watch-song-elbow-golden-slumbers-michel-gondry-a8045966.html">John Lewis Christmas advert</a> has been released.</p>
      <p>The musician to follow in the footsteps of <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/EllieGoulding">Ellie Goulding</a>, Tom Odell and Gabrielle Aplin as singer of the annual trailer is <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/bastille-interview-dan-smith-new-album-quarter-past-midnight-best-laid-plans-tour-dates-a8344826.html">Bastille</a> frontman Dan Smith.​</p>
      <p>REO Speedwagon’s 1985 power ballad “Can’t Fight This Feeling”, which features on the US bands band’s record <i>Wheels Are Turnin</i>‘, is this year’s song of choice.</p>
      <p>The touching advert, which tells the story of a little girl and her friendship with an excitable dragon named Edgar, marks John Lewis &amp; Partners’ first ever joint campaign with Waitrose &amp; Partners.</p>
      <p>Last year’s edition was a tribute to <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/EltonJohn?CMP=ILC-refresh">Elton John</a>, which saw the “Your Song” star reminisce about his life and career in reverse. </p>
      <p>Previous John Lewis Christmas ad covers include <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Oasis">Oasis</a> song “Half the World Away” and “Somewhere Only We Know” by Keane.</p>
      <p>Martin George, Partner and Customer Director, Waitrose &amp; Partners, said: “The magic of friendship and making our loved ones feel special, are some of the most wonderful things about this time of year.</p>
      <p>“The Christmas pudding in the final scene is not just the showpiece of a spectacular feast which brings all the villagers together. It’s a reminder that a thoughtful gesture – whether that’s a delicious meal or a special gift – can mean so much.” </p>
