      <p>Therapy dogs will be ruff-ing it on Wednesday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. in Room 902 of the Hart Senate Office Building and rooms 2043 and 2044 of the Rayburn House Office Building.</p>
      <p>“Who better to bring comfort and relief to the hardworking folks on Capitol Hill than a furry group of loving, intuitive, and bipartisan Pet Partners therapy animals?” the groups asked in a news release touting the event.</p>
      <p>The animals, which ITK hears will be registered therapy dogs, are meant to “offer congressional staff a break from the stress of wrapping up<a href="http://sputniknews.com/us/20191113/1077300994.html"> an exceptionally busy year</a>” and to demonstrate the “health and wellness benefits of the human-animal bond.”  According to therapy animal organization PAWS for People, the scientifically-proven benefits of pet therapy include decreasing anxiety, providing comfort, and even lowering blood pressure.</p>
      <blockquote>“This is a happy accident,” PIJAC President Mike Bober told People. “We had this planned for several months, so when they announced the date of the hearings, we thought ‘if there was ever a time for a bipartisan source of comfort and relief, it’s today.’”</blockquote>
