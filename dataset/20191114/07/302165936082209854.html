      <p>SAN FRANCISCO, Nov 14 — WeWork posted third-quarter losses of US$1.25 billion despite the beleaguered office space start-up nearly doubling its revenue, US media reports said yesterday.</p>
      <p>The firm has suffered a dramatic reversal in fortunes since its US$47 billion (RM195.5 billion) valuation at the start of the year.</p>
      <p>In the last two months WeWork canceled its IPO and pushed out co-founder Adam Neumann, albeit with a reported severance package of more than US$1.5 billion.</p>
      <p>The record-high loss was more than double the red ink logged over the same period a year earlier while revenue soared to US$934 million, according to the Wall Street Journal, which cited a report to debt holders by parent company We Co</p>
      <p>Japanese conglomerate SoftBank Group will pump a total of US$9.5 billion into WeWork and increase its stake in the firm from 29 per cent to around 80 per cent in an agreement announced last month.</p>
      <p>SoftBank Group last week announced an operating loss of US$6.4 billion for the third quarter, the worst in its history, as it took a hit from investments in start-ups including WeWork and Uber.</p>
      <p>WeWork offers flexible and shared workspace arrangements, with operations in 111 cities across 29 countries.</p>
      <p>To cut costs, the firm stopped construction of new buildings and is selling off some business units, according to SoftBank chief executive Masayoshi Son. — AFP</p>
