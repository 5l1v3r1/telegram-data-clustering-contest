      <p>A 26-year-old man has been reported by police over the Kingsford crash that claimed the life of Kieran Modra, but officers have not yet decided on a final charge.</p>
      <p>The low-vision five-time Paralympic gold medallist was cycling to Clare from his home at Hallett Cove when he was hit by a Kia sedan on the Sturt Highway about 7am on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Modra, 47, died at the scene.</p>
      <p>The driver of the Kia – a 26-year-old Greenwith man – was not injured but taken to Lyell McEwin Hospital as a precaution.</p>
      <p>Major Crash officers on Thursday reported the man for driving offences and are continuing their investigations to determine the final charge.</p>
      <p>The man will be summonsed to appear in court at a later date.</p>
      <p>Modra’s death took South Australia’s road toll to 97, compared with 63 at the same time last year.</p>
