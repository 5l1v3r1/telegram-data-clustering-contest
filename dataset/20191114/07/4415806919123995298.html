      <h1>FG executive council meets today to discuss Maria Bailey's future</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T07:36:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 07:36</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/digital-desk-staff/" target="_blank">By Digital Desk staff</a></address>
      <p>Fine Gael's national executive council will meet this evening to discuss the political future of Maria Bailey.</p>
      <p>The TD may be removed as a general election candidate in the Dun-Laoghaire Rathdown constituency.</p>
      <p>Last month, Fine Gael party members voted for an urgent review of the constituency's election ticket.</p>
      <p>Maria Bailey has been in the spotlight since it emerged she had taken a personal injuries claim against a Dublin hotel.</p>
      <p>It came after she fell off a swing, a case which she later dropped.</p>
      <p>It is expected that the executive council will be given a recommendation from the Taoiseach on what should happen next.</p>
      <p>If Deputy Bailey is removed, Minister of State Mary Mitchell O'Connor and Cllr Barry Ward would be the FG candidates in Dun-Laoghaire Rathdown.</p>
      <p>Or, another person could be added to the ticket, with councillors Lorraine Hall and Jennifer Carroll MacNeill tipped for selection.</p>
      <p>Leo Varadkar has refused to be drawn on her Maria Bailey's future, but said he would be guided by the view of members.</p>
