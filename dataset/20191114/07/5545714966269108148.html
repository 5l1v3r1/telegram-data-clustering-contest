      <h1>The new Smash Ultimate patch mainly just fixes a Terry glitch</h1>
      <h2>Involving his Buster Wolf</h2>

      <p>After much fanfare (and naturally, a lot of warnings about saving replays and converting them to videos!), <i>Smash Ultimate</i>'s 6.1.0 patch is now live. But what does it entail? Not much actually, as its major feature is a glitch fix.</p>
      <p>6.1.0 primarily addresses a bug with new fighter Terry, which has befuddled players for the past week or so: "A rare issue has been fixed when Terry's Super Special Move 'Buster Wolf' connects with an opposing fighter, causing both Terry and that fighter to become unable to move from their positions." As usual you need the latest patch to play online.</p>
      <p>Although folks were expecting balance changes (a sequential middle digit usually denotes bigger patches, in which replay data is cycled), it looks like we're going to have to wait a bit for that. You can find the full notes below.</p>
      <blockquote><b>You can now update the game to Ver. 6.1.0.</b>   <b>Update Details</b> The latest software version is needed to enjoy the following features:<br/><br/>General<br/>・A rare issue has been fixed when Terry's Super Special Move "Buster Wolf" connects with an opposing fighter, causing both Terry and that fighter to become unable to move from their positions. <b>Compatibility Notes</b> ・The latest software version is required to enter Online mode.<br/>・Local wireless play is not compatible with Ver. 6.0.0 and earlier.
