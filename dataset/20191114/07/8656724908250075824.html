      <h1>Detailed Guide on how to download your Snapchat data – Techjaja</h1>

      <p>When you sign up for Snapchat and use their services, they will collect certain information from you, like your phone number and email address as clearly stipulated in their <a href="https://www.snap.com/privacy/privacy-policy">privacy policy</a>. They also collect information about you and how you’ve used their services, like which Snaps you’ve submitted to Our Story. But some users have been wondering if they can retrieve all the data that they store with Snap Inc. There are a couple ways to access your data and sometimes update most of this data.</p>
      <h3>Information available in the Snapchat app</h3>
      <p>Your key account information is available in the Snapchat app. This includes your name, username, birthday, mobile number, email, Snapchatters you’ve blocked, Memories, Bitmoji, Snapcode, your orders (like custom Filters and Lenses), information about Spectacles, Shazam history, and Snapcash transactions.</p>
      <p>In the app, you can also update your privacy settings, ad preferences, lifestyle categories, permissions, Our Story Management, and Snap Map settings.</p>
      <h3>Information is available in ‘Download My Data’ section</h3>

      <p>It should be noted that the file that you will download with your snapchat info from your ‘My Data’ download will arrive in the form of a ZIP file. To open and view a ZIP file, you’ll need to have compatible software on your device! Here are some of the categories of data you’ll be able to find in your ‘Download My Data’ file:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Login History and Account information</li>
        <li>Snap History</li>
        <li>Chat History</li>
        <li>Our Story and Crowd-Sourced Content</li>
        <li>Purchase History</li>
        <li>Snapchat Support History</li>
        <li>User Profile</li>
        <li>Friends</li>
        <li>Ranking</li>
        <li>Account History</li>
        <li>Location History</li>
        <li>Search History</li>
        <li>Terms History</li>
        <li>Subscriptions</li>
        <li>Bitmoji</li>
        <li>In-app Surveys</li>
        <li>Reported Content</li>
        <li>Bitmoji Kit</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>How to access or update your data</h3>
      <p>1. You can access and update some of your data (like your name, email address, phone number, and Bitmoji) by logging into Snapchat and going to <b>Settings</b>. Just tap your Profile icon at the top to go to your Profile, then tap the gear in at the top to go to Settings.</p>
      <p>2. To access other data, like the date your account was created and which devices have logged into your account, you can visit <a href="https://accounts.snapchat.com/accounts/welcome">their accounts website</a> and then follow the steps below. Since they take the security of your data very seriously, you’ll need to have a <a href="https://support.snapchat.com/a/change-email">verified email address</a> to download your data.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Log into your account on accounts.snapchat.com</li>
        <li>Click ‘<b>My Data</b>‘</li>
        <li>Click ‘<b>Submit Request</b>‘ at the bottom of the page</li>
        <li>If you have verified an email address with Snapchat, they’ll send you an email with a link once your data is ready to download</li>
        <li>Follow the link in your email to download your data</li>
        <li>Click the link to download your data</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It should be noted that you cannot download your data using the Snapchat app.</p>
