      <p>Harry and wife <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/meghan-markle">Meghan Markle</a> broke with tradition at Archie's christening back in July by not inviting members of the press to photograph them arriving at the service.</p>
      <p>However they released a number of official shots and have treated fans to even more over the last few months - including the new one today.</p>

      <p>Prince Charles is celebrating his birthday India, where he is currently completing a Royal Tour.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, he hitched a ride on an electric rickshaw and flipped chapatis in a Sikh temple as he celebrated Indian culture and its people.</p>
      <p>The Prince of Wales - Charles, a prominent climate change campaigner - began a hectic two-day trip by learning about India’s efforts to combat the dense smog that covers New Delhi most autumns.</p>
      <p>He was taken for a spin in a non-polluting battery powered three-wheeler rickshaw after visiting India’s equivalent of the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/met-office">Met Office</a> in the capital New Delhi.</p>

      <p>Later he was mobbed by visitors when he visited the Bangla Sahib Gurdwara Sikh Temple to celebrate the 550th anniversary of the birth of Guru Nanak, the founder of Sikhism.</p>
      <p>Driving the rickshaw was Maria who has benefited from a programme, run by SMV Green, a sustainable transport organisation, which is training some of India’s first female rickshaw drivers.</p>
      <p>Ahead of the two day visit Charles posted his first personal message on the royal family’s Instagram page.</p>
      <p>In a message to Britain’s Sikh community, and others in the Commonwealth, he wrote: “The principles on which Guru Nanak founded the Sikh religion, and which guide your lives to this day, are ones which can inspire us all.”</p>
