        <b>Virat Kohli’s spirit as a pure team man has never been doubted and he has proved it yet again in front of the Holkar audience at Indore. Seeing the crowd cheering for him, even though Mohammed Shami had just taken the wicket, the Indian skipper gestured the crowd to cheer for the pacer instead.</b>

      <p>Be it his sweet gesture of asking Indian fans to stop booing <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/steve_smith">Steve Smith</a> to making people rally behind him, Kohli has always been involved in some theatrics which has made him the most watched cricketer on the ground, and that is not merely because of his batting exploits. Today, he showed his sportsmanship and how good a team man he is by deflecting the attention to <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/mohammed_shami">Mohammed Shami</a>, just after the pacer has taken a wicket. Shami was mixing the reverse swing and conventional swing to great effect to trouble the Bangladeshi batsmen, and <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/mushfiqur_rahim">Mushfiqur Rahim</a> was left stranded when the pacer angled the cherry in. Rahim was left thinking whether to leave or not and in the moment of misjudgement, the ball crashed into the sticks.</p>
