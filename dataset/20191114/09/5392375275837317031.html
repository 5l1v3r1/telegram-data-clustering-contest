      <p>Chinese manufacturing giant, <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/xiaomi">Xiaomi</a>, is one of the top smartphone brands globally. To be at this level, you must be consistent with smartphone releases and innovation. The company currently prides itself as the first brand to mass-produce a phone with a 108MP camera. However, this does not mean that its time to stop. Recent information shows that a new smartphone, Xiaomi M1912G7BE, got the Chinese 3C certification. We do not know the exact name for this phone but “M1912G7BE” is the model number on the 3C certification.</p>

      <p>On the certification, Xiaomi M1912G7BE will come with a 27W fast charging function. This is about the only information that the certification gives. Furthermore, Xiaomi’s new phone issuance date is November 13th and it will be produced by Yinghuada Technology Co., Ltd.</p>
      <p>In addition to Xiaomi’s new mobile phone, a new device from the Redmi brand also got 3C certification. Many believe that this will be the upcoming Redmi K30 series which will support 5G. Lu Weibing, vice president of Xiaomi Group and general manager of Redmi brand has since revealed that the Redmi K30 will support 5G and it will be the first Xiaomi/Redmi phone to come with dual SA/NSA networking mode. As of now, Xiaomi has two 5G phones which include Xiaomi Mi MIX 3 5G and Xiaomi Mi 9 Pro 5G. Xiaomi’s CEO, Lei Jun, has said that the company will release 10 5G smartphones next year and they will cover all categories. This means that we will certainly have mid-range 5G devices next year and with luck, we might see entry-level 5G smartphones.</p>
