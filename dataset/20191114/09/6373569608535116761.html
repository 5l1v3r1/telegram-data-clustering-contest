      <p>A popular darts event in Plymouth has been cancelled last minute due to 'legal issues'.</p>
      <p>Champion of Champions at Plymouth Guildhall, due to be held on February 15, 2020 has been cancelled along with several over shows across the UK organised by Stepback Concerts Ltd.</p>
      <p>Event attendees have been sent an email via Eventbrite informing them of the cancellation and how to obtain refunds.</p>
      <p>Stepback Concerts Ltd, which is run by Daniel Nelmes, is still active according to Companies House, although earlier this month, an official notice was posted to say compulsory strike-off action against the company has been discontinued.</p>
      <p>A message on the company's website says: 'It is with deep regret that we must advise due to legal issues we are having to cancel all events organised by Stepback concerts Ltd. We have explored all options in order to try and restructure the events but unfortunately have not been able to do so.'</p>
      <p>Tickets for the Plymouth darts event were being sold for between £32.33 - £65.76. The event was due to feature eight world champions who would battle it out to become the 'Champion of Champions'.</p>
      <p>It had been marketed as the 'BIGGEST darts event of the year' and was due to feature Phil 'The Power' Taylor, Raymond 'Barney' Van Barneveld, Anastasia 'Anastasia' Dobrymoslova, among other big darting names.</p>
      <p>But people who had already purchased their tickets have received an email informing them of the cancellation due to 'legal reasons'.</p>
