      <h1>China says holding 'in-depth' talks with US on phase one of trade deal</h1>
      <h2>The degree of tariff cancellation should fully reflect the importance of a 'phase one' agreement, China said</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T09:21:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 09:21</time> by <a rel="author">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>China and the United States are holding "in-depth" discussions on a first phase trade agreement, and cancelling tariffs is an important condition to reaching a deal, the Chinese commerce ministry said on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The degree of tariff cancellation should fully reflect the importance of a 'phase one' agreement, ministry spokesman Gao Feng told a regular briefing.</p>
      <p>"China has emphasised many times that the trade war began with additional tariffs and should end with the cancellation of additional tariffs," said Gao.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, U.S. President <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/donald-trump">Donald Trump </a>said a trade deal with China was "close" but offered no details and warned that he would raise tariffs "substantially" on Chinese goods without such a deal.</p>
      <p>Trump's threat was a reference to previously announced tariffs of 15 per cent on about $156 billion of Chinese consumer goods set to take effect on December 15, according to trade experts and a source close to the White House.</p>
      <p>Those tariffs would hit video game consoles, computer monitors, Christmas decorations and items given as gifts during the approaching festive season.</p>
      <p>Last week, White House advisers said the December 15 tariffs would probably be averted if a 'phase one' trade deal was reached.</p>
      <p>"If both sides reach a 'phase one' deal, the degree of tariff cancellation should fully reflect the importance of the 'phase one' deal; and its importance should be appraised by both sides together. Both sides are conducting in-depth discussions on this now," said Gao.</p>
      <p>Highlighting the volatile state of play in the 16-month long trade war, officials of both sides had said last week they had a deal to roll back tariffs, only to have Trump deny any deal had been agreed.</p>
      <p>Trump has imposed tariffs on billions of dollars of Chinese goods to force major changes in China's trade and industrial policies.</p>
      <p>The U.S. administration is demanding that China end the theft and forced transfer of American intellectual property and curb subsidies to state-owned enterprises, while granting US.</p>
      <p>companies more access to China's markets.</p>
      <p>Trump also wants China to substantially increase its purchases of US farm products.</p>
      <p>China and the United States were near a deal in May when Beijing pulled away, prompting Trump to raise tariff rates and embark on new rounds of punitive duties.</p>

      </p>
      <p>If an interim deal is finished and signed, it is widely expected to include a U.S. pledge to scrap tariffs scheduled for December 15.</p>
      <p>A source previously told Reuters that Chinese negotiators wanted the United States to drop 15 per cent tariffs on about $125 billion worth of Chinese goods that took effect on September 1.</p>
      <p>They also sought relief from earlier 25 per cent tariffs on about $250 billion of imports, ranging from machinery and semiconductors to furniture.</p>
      <p>Gao said last week that both countries must simultaneously cancel some tariffs on each other's goods to strike a first phase pact.</p>
      <p>"Cancelling tariffs is in the interests of producers, consumers, China, the U.S., and the world," said Gao on Thursday.</p>
      <p>A Reuters poll of economists showed the trade war is unlikely to see a permanent truce over the coming year.</p>
      <p>China's economic growth has further slowed since the trade war erupted last year, expanding at its weakest pace in almost three decades.</p>
      <p>Chinese factory output slowed substantially more than expected in October, weighed by the ongoing trade war and broad weakness in global and domestic demand.</p>
      <p>The disappointing numbers show China is off to a rough start in the final three months of 2019 and will bolster calls for Beijing to roll out fresh support.</p>
      <p>The U.S. economy is forecast to have expanded at an annualised pace of 1.9 per cent in the July-Sept period, slightly down from 2.0 per cent in the second quarter.</p>
      <p>Growth is expected to hover around that rate in each quarter through to the second half of 2021, according to economists.</p>
