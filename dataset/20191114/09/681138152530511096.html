      <p>Across the hotel chain's 34 locations in Suffolk and Essex, staff are usually happy to go the extra mile to make sure their customers are comfortable.</p>
      <p>Some requests however are a little more complicated, like one customer in Ipsiwch's Beacon Hill hotel - who asked for a pillow made of chocolate.</p>

      <p>The teams receive thousands of strange requests throughout the year across the country - but you can see the 14 strangest, most specific demands customers made below:</p>
      <p>- "Can you get me a unicorn pedal boat and arrange for a rainbow to be above the hotel at 4.16pm?"</p>
      <p>- "Can you turn my room into a massive gingerbread house for Christmas?"</p>
      <p>- "I have a telephone interview today, can you stand in for me and take the interview?"</p>
      <p>- "Can I have a pillow made out of chocolate?"</p>
      <p>- "Are there any Romans still living in Colchester?"</p>
      <p>- "Can you get me a special appearance on TOWIE?"</p>
      <p>- "Can you dress up as the Greatest Showman and be a master of ceremony at my wedding?"</p>
      <p>- "Can you arrange for me to woken up by the sound of real nightingales singing outside my room?"</p>
      <p>- "Can I have 100 baked beans minus the tomato sauce for breakfast?"</p>
      <p>- "Does the Bentley car come from Great Bentley?"</p>
      <p>- "Can you arrange for a carriage and six white horses to take me to Chelmsford Races?"</p>
      <p>- "Can you come shopping with me at Lakeside and carry my bags and give your opinion on my new summer collection?</p>
      <p>- "Can you help me write 1,000 thank you cards to my clients?"</p>
      <p>
        <b>What do Travelodge think of the questions?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Travelodge spokesman Shakila Ahmed said: "Annually we welcome around 19million customers at our 570 hotels which include 34 properties in Essex and Suffolk.</p>
      <p>"Our hotel teams receive thousands of interesting requests from business and leisure guests.</p>
      <p>"Where possible, our hotel teams will go above and beyond to help customers as they relish a good challenge.</p>
      <p>"However there are some requests beyond their control such as getting a raft of ducks to go to sleep, stopping the traffic on the M5, getting the Northern Lights to make an appearance and getting a herd of sheep as a sleep aid."</p>
