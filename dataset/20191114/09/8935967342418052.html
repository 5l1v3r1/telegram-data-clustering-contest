      <p>Japanese operator Softbank confirmed it is considering a merger of its internet services unit Z Holdings with the messaging app Line. SoftBank said it is in discussions "regarding various possibilities, including such a merger". Line issued a similar statement, saying no decision had been taken yet. </p>
      <p>The Nikkei reported earlier that Softbank's company Z Holdings, which controls Yahoo Japan, was in final talks with Naver, the Korean internet group and controlling shareholder of Line. </p>
      <p>The addition of the messaging app and its growing range of content and payment services is expected to strengthen Yahoo's expansion in to e-commerce. It already operates the PayPay service and earlier this year acquired the commerce platform Zozu. Line would also help Yahoo reach a younger audience of consumers. </p>
