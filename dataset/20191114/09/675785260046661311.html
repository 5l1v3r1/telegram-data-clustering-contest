      <p>Tyson Fury claims Anthony Joshua was happy to lose to Andy Ruiz Jr.</p>
      <p>Joshua was knocked down four times and stopped in the seventh round by Ruiz in New York earlier this year.</p>
      <p>The pair will rematch in Saudi Arabia in December as Joshua bids to win back his three heavyweight world titles.</p>
      <p>And Fury believes Joshua was not mentally right for the first fight.</p>
      <p>"This was the first time Joshua was in a big fight away from his home country and when that happens you react in one of two ways – you either feel out of your comfort zone and shrink, or you rise to the occasion," he writes in his autobiography.</p>

      <p>"If you’re totally confident in your ability you’d be happy fighting in outer space. When I go to the ring, I’m there to fight, no matter what is in my way – it’s as simple as that. I bring my heart to the ring every time.</p>
      <p>"But in New York against Ruiz, it just seemed like Joshua had left his heart back in the dressing room. Joshua was a 1/25 favourite and he knocked Ruiz down in the third round.</p>
      <p>"But then in one of the all-time biggest shocks, Joshua himself went down twice in the same round before being knocked down repeatedly again in round seven when he was stopped on his feet, having spat out his gumshield after hitting the canvas.</p>

      <p>"As the referee waved it off, a few of us jumped and shouted, ‘He quit! He quit!’ He seemed to have given in. It was shocking to see the way the fight ended.</p>
      <p>"To me, it was no surprise that Joshua struggled to recover after being put down, because any time he has been hit in his career that has been the case.</p>
      <p>"But this time he seemed happy to lose. That’s something that I can’t comprehend, a concept that’s alien to me because I’m not bred that way – there’s no quit in me.</p>
      <p>"The little fat guy beat the body beautiful and the heavyweight division was turned upside down."</p>
