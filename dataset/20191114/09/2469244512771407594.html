      <p>Drivers have been warned about hazardous conditions on the roads after a car spun on black ice and crashed this morning.</p>
      <p>The incident happened on the A361 North Devon Link Road near Knowstone at 5.15am.</p>
      <p>Police were called to reports of a single vehicle collision in which icy conditions saw the car lose control.</p>
      <p>Initial reports suggested there were two crashes, but police say they only have a log of one incident.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for Devon and Cornwall Police said: "The car had spun on black ice on the road and sustained damage.</p>

      <p>"It doesn't appear there were any injuries caused to those in the vehicle."</p>
      <p>The road was partially blocked for more than three hours while the vehicle was reecovered.</p>
      <p>The road was fully reopened by 8.55pm.</p>
      <p>It comes the morning after snow fell on higher parts of Devon with police reporting hazardous driving conditions on the A30 at Okehampton and Sourton.</p>
      <p>Gritters were out in parts of the county last night and weather warnings are in place at several locations around the south west.</p>
      <p>Highways England has advised motorists to act with caution and ensure they are prepared for journeys.</p>
      <p>In a tweet they said: "Please ensure you drive to the conditions, allow extra time for your journeys and have water and snacks with you.</p>
      <p>"We will keep you updated throughout the morning. Safe Travels."</p>
