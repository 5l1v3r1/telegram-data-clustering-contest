      <p>A JSPL spokesperson said that Jindal Steel &amp; Power Limited’s step-down subsidiary, Jindal Mining South Africa Proprietary Limited (JMSA), a company incorporated in South Africa has ‘turned around and reported cash profits in the recently completed quarter ending September 2019.’</p>
      <p>JMSA had entered into Voluntary Business Rescue in April-May 2019. With a view to protecting the interests of various stakeholders and with a long-term vision of turning it profitable &amp; sustainable, the company had taken the strategic decision to take the Business Rescue (BR) route. As part of the BR, the company engaged with stakeholders to restructure the liabilities (both Operational and Financial) to make the business profitable in the long run.</p>
      <p>The operations at JMSA are now stable and ramping up well and is out of the Business Rescue (BR) process. JSPL will be looking to monetize this anthracite coal asset as part of its International Portfolio Rationalisation Plan.</p>
