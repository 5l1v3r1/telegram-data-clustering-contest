      <h1>Pertahok: Former Jakarta governor in contention to lead state-owned enterprise, has Jokowi’s backing</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T09:20:06+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 09:20</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/Coconuts%20Jakarta" target="_blank">Coconuts Jakarta</a></address>
      <p>Former Jakarta Governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama has mostly shied away from politics ever since his release from prison in January after serving his highly controversial two-year sentence for blasphemy.</p>
      <p>Now, rumors are swirling around that Ahok is set to make his return to a strategic official post, albeit this time to lead a state-owned enterprise (BUMN).</p>
      <p>The rumors were fueled (excuse the pun) after Ahok recently met with BUMN Minister Erick Thohir about taking up a leadership post at a BUMN. </p>
      <p>“To me, if there is a chance to help the country, I’ll be ready,” Ahok told reporters yesterday.</p>
      <p>Among the leadership positions that have been rumored to be filled by Ahok are those of state-owned oil and gas company Pertamina and state-owned utility firm PLN.</p>
      <p>Pertamina was hit with a huge scandal earlier this year when its former boss Karen Agustiawan was named <a href="https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2018/09/24/ago-detains-ex-pertamina-boss.html">suspect in a graft case</a>, while PLN in August left Jakarta, Banten and West Java <a href="https://coconuts.co/jakarta/news/jakarta-court-rules-in-favor-of-pln-in-lawsuit-over-dead-koi-caused-by-blackout-blames-trees/">literally in the dark</a> in the worst blackout in recent memory.  </p>
      <p>Adding weight to the rumors, President Joko Widodo, who is known as a close political ally to Ahok after the two served as governor and vice governor of Jakarta respectively, said he backs the 53-year-old to succeed in a BUMN post.</p>
      <p>“We know Ahok’s work. So, right now we are in the selection process,” Jokowi told reporters today, without specifying which BUMN Ahok would lead.</p>
      <p>Some politicians have voiced their opposition to Ahok’s potential appointment to a BUMN leadership role, arguing that his criminal record should come under consideration and that political motivations should not play a part in picking BUMN bosses.</p>
      <p>During his time as governor, Ahok was seen as an incorruptible, no-nonsense figure who didn’t mince his words when attacking his enemies nor pull his punches when carrying out policies he believed were of the greatest benefit to the capital’s citizens.</p>
      <p>While that endeared him to many of his supporters, it also led to his imprisonment for blasphemy against Islam as it was a speech he made mentioning that his enemies had used a certain verse in the Quran to convince others not to vote for him — a Chinese Christian — that triggered his conviction and defeat in the 2017 Jakarta gubernatorial election.</p>
