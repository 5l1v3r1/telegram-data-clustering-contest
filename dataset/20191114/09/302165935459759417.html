      <h1>One week in prison, Shariah Court to decide on stay appeal for five men accused of gay sex</h1>

      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 14 — The five men sentenced to jail, fined and caning for attempted gay sex will know if their appeal for a stay of execution will be granted by the Shariah High Court tomorrow morning.</p>
      <p>The men have been in holding in Kajang prison since last Friday and were finally able to get their affidavits signed and presented before a Shariah Court Judge this evening.</p>
      <p>Four of the men were sentenced to six months’ jail, six strokes of the cane, and a RM4,800 fine for “attempting intercourse against the order of nature while a fifth man was sentenced to seven months’ jail, six strokes of the cane and a RM4,900 fine for the same offence.</p>
      <p>“The judge gave us 24 hours to put in a reply in writing and we will do so by tomorrow morning,” the men’s lawyer Nurul Ain Kamaruddin told <i>Malay Mail</i>.</p>
      <p>“The judge was aware these men have been in prison for seven days and said a decision will be made tomorrow at 10am.”</p>
      <p>Islamic enforcement officers detained the five accused with seven other men during a November 2018 raid on a two-storey apartment and were reportedly convicted of attempting to have intercourse against the order of nature, a crime under Islamic laws.</p>
      <p>Gay rights activist Numan Afifi, who attended the hearing today, told <i>Malay Mail</i> they are hoping to be granted a stay as they are planning to appeal against the Court’s decision.</p>
      <p>“If tomorrow we’re granted a stay, then the punishment will be postponed pending an appeal.</p>
      <p>“We are also exploring whether we can launch a constitutional challenge but it’s not been decided, we’re just exploring these options.</p>
      <p>“We’ll make the decision this week and brief the press and the civil societies then as well.”</p>
