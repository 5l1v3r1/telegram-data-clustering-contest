        <b>Jorge Lorenzo's future will be revealed today at 3pm, at the Valencia circuit. The Spanish champion has called for a special press conference, which will also be attended by Dorna CEO Carmelo Ezpeleta.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>At this point, the most likely hypothesis is that Lorenzo will announce his retirement.</b> The rumours about Jorge's future have been circulating for months and his recent race results haven't exactly inspired optimism. Although the man himself, and Honda management too, have said that they plan to respect the already signed 2020 contract, it appears that the adventure may be coming to an end.</p>
      <p>
        <b>If the Majorcan does decide to stop, there is no other ride available to him for next year. One option may be to take a year-long sabbatical, before returning to MotoGP in 2021.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Everything will be revealed in just a few hours' time.</p>
