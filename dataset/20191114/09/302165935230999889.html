      <p>BEIJING, Nov 14 — An influential state-backed Chinese newspaper today withdrew a tweet saying the Hong Kong government was expected to announce a weekend curfew, after its editor said there was “not sufficient” information to back up the report.</p>
      <p>China’s <i>Global Times</i>, citing unidentified sources, had put the news out on its English-language Twitter feed, but the post was later deleted.</p>
      <p>“I just checked how the information was obtained. My conclusion is that the information is not sufficient to support this exclusive news. I have demanded to delete the tweet,” <i>Global Times</i> editor Hu Xijin tweeted in English.</p>
      <p>The Hong Kong government did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
      <p>Hong Kong pro-democracy protesters paralysed parts of the Chinese-ruled city for a fourth day today, forcing schools to close and blocking highways as students built barricades and stockpiled makeshift weapons, setting the stage for campus showdowns.</p>
      <p>The <i>Global Times</i> is a widely read tabloid run by the ruling Communist Party’s official <i>People’s Daily</i>.</p>
      <p>Twitter is blocked in China, but state media are generally given special dispensation to run their own Twitter accounts as the government seeks a wider international audience for its publications. — Reuters</p>
