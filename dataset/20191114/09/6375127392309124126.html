      <h3>A SUSPECTED gun trafficker in Cebu was arrested in an entrapment operation in Danao City which resulted in the recovery of a dozen unlicensed firearms, one of them even fitted with a silencer, a report to Philippine National Police Criminal Investigation and Detection Group director, Brigadier General Joel Napoleon M. Coronel said yesterday.</h3>
      <p>CIDG Region 7 chief, Colonel Rommel Ochave, said suspect Rernato Ramonida alias ‘Jr.’ was placed under arrest after he sold the weapons to an undercover officer in Barangay Guinsay in Danao City at 3:30 p.m. Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Members of the CIDG Region 7, the Regional Intelligence Unit 6, Regional Mobile Force Battalion 7 and the Danao City Police Station were involved in the sting which led in the confiscation of two KG-9 machine pistols, six caliber .45 pistols, four cal. 9mm semi-automatic pistols, eight .45 magazines, two 9mm magazines, four KG-9 magazines and a sound suppressor commonly known as ‘silencer,’ and the buy-bust money.</p>
      <p>Ochave described Ramonida as a member of the newly-identified ‘Nabi Group’ involved in illegal drugs, gun-for-hire and gunrunning activities in Cebu and other parts of Central Visayas.</p>
      <p>The suspect is now facing charges for violation of Republic Act 10591 or the Comprehensive Firearms and Ammunition Regulations Act of 2013, the official said.</p>
