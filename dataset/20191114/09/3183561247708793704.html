      <p>The good Doctor is on <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/hbo-max-is-bringing-a-tardis-load-of-doctor-who-with-it-1836890629">her way back</a> and she’s got some new companions this time around. They just happen to be the ones who help from behind the camera.</p>
      <p>As fans prepare for the November 23 trailer for season 12 of <i>Doctor Who</i>, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/doctorwho/entries/f4d504e6-b228-4931-8d85-b1f9f30a0d2d">the BBC revealed</a> the new writers and directors who’ll be joining the team for this <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/07/doctor-who-could-return-to-our-screens-sooner-than-wed-thought">latest instalment</a>. Showrunner Chris Chibnall said in a statement, “We’re thrilled that <i>Doctor Who c</i>ontinues to attract some of the most exciting and dynamic talent working in television. Along with our returning faces, we’re excited to welcome new members to the <i>Doctor Who</i> family. The <i>Doctor Who</i> team is crammed with British television’s brightest writers and directors: we’ve adored working with them, and can’t wait to show you the explosive stuff they’ve created!”</p>
      <p>The three new writers are Nina Metivier, Maxine Alderton, and Charlene James. They join <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2018/08/idoctor-whosi-11th-season-is-being-created-by-a-very-diverse-group-of-people">returning season 11 writers</a> Vinay Patel, Ed Hime, and Pete McTighe, who wrote <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2018/11/doctor-who-season-11-episode-6-review-demons-of-the-punjab"><i>Demons of The Punjab</i></a><i>,</i> <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2018/12/doctor-who-season-11-episode-9-it-takes-you-away"><i>It Takes You Away</i></a><i>,</i> and<i> </i><a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2018/11/doctor-who-season-11-episode-7-recap-kerblam"><i>Kerblam!</i></a> respectively. Metivier had a smaller role on a few episodes of last year’s <i>Who</i> series, but more recently worked on <i>The A-List</i>. Alderton wrote for the long-running British soap <i>Emmerdale</i> and James wrote episodes of <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/01/a-medievalists-guide-to-magic-and-alchemy-inadiscovery-of-witches"><i>A Discovery of Witches</i></a>.</p>
      <p>Four new directors join the series as well. There’s Nida Manzoor, who directed episodes of a show called <i>Enterprice</i> (not “Enterprise,” despite what Google says); Emma Sullivan, who worked a lot on the BBC soap <i>Doctors;</i> Jamie Magnus Stone who, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3833743/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1">according to IMDB</a>, may be doing four episodes this season; and Lee Haven Jones, who has worked on basically everything in the UK for the past decade.</p>
      <p>Most of these creatives aren’t household names, but <i>Doctor Wh</i>o is a place where that can happen. Plus, it’s a big, broad, <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2018/10/doctor-whos-producers-discuss-their-outlook-and-hopes-for-season-11">diverse group of talent</a>. Just what the Doctor ordered.</p>
      <p>Season 12 of <i>Doctor Who</i> will air next year.</p>
