        <b>Parliament’s intervention follows reports on Monday where school administrators of Top Care secondary school in Iganga Municipality barred fifteen senior six students from sitting exams over fees balance.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Lawmakers across the political divide have asked the ministry of education to reprimand private school owners who have barred students with fees balance from sitting their final exams.</b>
      </p>
      <p>During Wednesday’s plenary session, Gulu Municipality MP, Lyandro Komakech described the actions of some school administrators as “a fundamental breach of the right to education.”</p>
      <p>“The actions of some school administrators should not go unpunished. You cannot bar students from sitting exams because of school fees balance. It’s just inhumane,” Komakech said.</p>
      <p>Although the state minister for sports, Charles Bakabulindi promised to inquire into the complaints, he was explicit that paying fees is the responsibility of parents.</p>
      <p>However, Speaker of Parliament Rebecca Kadaga reminded Bakabulindi of a government policy sanctioned a few years ago obliging schools to let school fees defaulting students sit exams and clear the balance later.</p>
      <p>Although Kadaga did not permit a full debate on the issue, the reaction of lawmakers was indicative of the fact that the impugned practice was widespread in many parts of the country.</p>
      <p>Parliament’s intervention follows reports on Monday where school administrators of Top Care secondary school in Iganga Municipality barred fifteen senior six students from sitting exams over fees balance.</p>
      <p>Ministry of education later intervened with the assistant commissioner in charge of private schools, George Mutekanga promising to crack the whip on school administrators.</p>
      <p>A number of well-wishers have since chipped in by contributing funds meant to clear the sh3.6m the affected students owed the school.</p>
