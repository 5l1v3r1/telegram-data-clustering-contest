      <h2>Half-empty halls are embarrassing to the people on stage and look awful if you're taking pictures or filming an event. So, in an attempt to make it look busier, people are being paid really rather a lot to just stand in a crowd</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T09:27:40+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 09:27</time> by <a rel="author">James Andrews, http://www.facebook.com/jameswritesmoney/</a></address>
      <p>Members of the public can now earn £40 an hour for standing in a crowd, with no real other skills needed.</p>
      <p>That's after online exhibition platform <a href="http://www.expocart.com/">ExpoCart</a> went on the hunt for people to populate events or exhibition stands to make them look busier than they would otherwise be.</p>
      <p>ExpoCart co-founder Jasmine Eilfield said: “No one wants to give a talk to an empty audience, or visit an empty stand.</p>
      <p>"So, we thought why not create a service that solves both these problems - customers are more inclined to engage with a business or person if somebody else already is, and on the flip side professionals can be confident knowing they are keeping up appearances!"</p>

      <p>The firm said the ideal candidate would be confident talking to strangers and comfortable in busy environments.</p>
      <p>Applicants need to be over 18 with a full driving license and be able to work around the country. Some jobs include dressing in formal attire, as well as evening work.</p>
      <p>“We’ve already got some actors signed up to the service, but after speaking to our event partners, we anticipate demand to be high, so need a lot more actors onboard," Eilfield said.</p>
      <p>"If you’re a confident person who wants to work in a flexible, varied job role, I encourage you to get in touch with us!”</p>
      <p>Events and exhibitions that need crowd actors include trade shows, comedy gigs, wedding shows and tech and consumer exhibitions.</p>
