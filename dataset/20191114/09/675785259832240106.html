      <h1>How to offset your carbon footprint - 7 ways to reduce your impact on the environment</h1>
      <h2>Climate change is the biggest challenge to face the human race in the modern world, but there are ways in which we can help by reducing our own carbon footprint</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T09:16:06+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 09:16</time> by <a rel="author">Lewis Knight, Daisy Naylor, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/lewis-knight/, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/daisy-naylor/</a></address>
      <p>Conversation around the globe is rightly turning to ways in which we can all try to better our environment and ensure we leave a better world for generations to come.</p>
      <p>Environmentalist campaigners such as <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/greta-thunberg">Greta Thunberg</a> have led the way in discussing how we can try to prevent climate catastrophe as we see further examples of declining Arctic Sea, increasing numbers of extreme <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/weather">weather</a> events and warming oceans.</p>
      <p>While it may seem too large a job for one person, we can all help to contribute to making a difference in our own small ways.</p>
      <p>Making some minor changes to our daily lives and routines will dramatically offset your own personal carbon footprint and ultimately add to making a huge difference for our environment.</p>
      <h3>Ways you can reduce your carbon footprint</h3>
      <h3>1. Stop eating meat (or just eat less)</h3>

      <p> </p>
      <p>Cutting down on your meat consumption can make a huge difference to your carbon footprint.</p>
      <p>Farming beef produces 20 times the emissions as farming beans, and requires 20 times as much land.</p>
      <p>If you really can't give up your Sunday roast, choosing poultry instead of red meat is much better for the environment, with chicken believed to have the lowest carbon footprint.</p>
      <h3>2. Switch off and unplug devices</h3>
      <p>Anytime a device is plugged into a socket it's using up energy - even if it's powered down or already fully charged.</p>
      <p>Instead of leaving your phone or other devices plugged in overnight, disconnect as soon as you hit 100%, and you'll reduce both your carbon footprint and your energy bill.</p>
      <h3>3. Cut down on single use plastic</h3>

      <p> </p>
      <p>There are more and more zero waste stores where you take your own containers to be filled with groceries - whether it's pasta, oil or coffee.</p>
      <p>If you don't have a convenient zero waste store, you can still cut down on unnecessary plastic. You can take your own bags to the supermarket, use "shampoo bars" instead of buying bottles, or invest in a reusable coffee cup.</p>
      <h3>4. Drive your car less</h3>
      <p>Using public transport, cycling or walking instead of driving can have a significant impact on your CO2 emissions. Reducing your mileage from 15,000 to 10,000 miles a year could reduce your carbon footprint by around 15 percent.</p>
      <p>If you're in the market for a new car, consider a more efficient electric vehicle.</p>
      <h3>5. Dry your clothes naturally</h3>

      <p>It's faster and easier to use a tumble dryer or dry on a radiator. However, this uses up valuable energy when some basic organisation makes this unnecessary. Instead, hang your clothes up on the line.</p>
      <h3>6. Buy less fast fashion</h3>
      <p>It can take up to 20,000 litres of water to make just one new t-shirt and one new pair of jeans. That's more water than the average person drinks in 12 years.</p>
      <p>Consider buying your clothes second hand, or invest in pieces that will last for years.</p>
      <h3>7. Fly less</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>One return flight from London to New York emits 0.67 tonnes of CO2 per passenger - which is a whopping 11 percent of the total average annual emissions of someone living in the UK.</p>
      <p>It can be hard to find alternatives to flying - especially when you're going long-haul - but cutting back on air travel will make a huge difference to your carbon footprint.</p>
