      <h1>MG Maxus D90 SUV spotted testing in India, to rival Toyota Fortuner</h1>

      <p>A spy image has shown that SAIC's India arm, MG Motor India has begun testing the Maxus D90 SUV. This could mean that the body-on-frame seven seater SUV could be launched here sometime next year. The D90 is sold largely under the Maxus brand, the SAIC arm that sells light heavy-duty vehicles like MPVs and pick-ups. It is also sold under the MG and LDV brands in certain regions.</p>

      <p>The D90 competes with cars like the <a href="http://overdrive.in/cars/toyota/fortuner-m163/">Toyota Fortuner</a>, <a href="http://overdrive.in/cars/ford/endeavour-m53/">Ford Endeavour</a> and <a href="http://overdrive.in/cars/mahindra/alturas-g4-m719/">Mahindra Alturas G4</a>. It is 5,005mm long, 1,875mm tall and 1,932mm wide, with a 2,950mm wheelbase. This makes it larger than the Fortuner and the Endeavour. A 2.0-litre turbo petrol with 225PS and 350 Nm but we think MG will bring it to India with the FCA-sourced 2.0-litre diesel, as seen on the Hector. This could be paired with a six-speed manual or six-speed torque-convertor auto. A four-wheel-drive system is also available as an option which adds off-road modes, alongside driving modes.</p>

      <p>We also expect this SUV to come with numerous segment-first features, given that this is a strategy MG has used to gain popularity in our market. We think the D90 could come with features like a 360-degree camera, TPMS, sunroof, dual-zone air-conditioning, an eight-way power-adjustable driver seat, a 12-inch touchscreen infotainment system, a panoramic sunroof, connected car tech, six airbags, hill descent control and so on.</p>

      <p>We also think the D90 could be priced very aggressively. It will sit above the seven-seat Hector in the brand's line-up and we think could be priced under the Rs 25 lakh mark.</p>
