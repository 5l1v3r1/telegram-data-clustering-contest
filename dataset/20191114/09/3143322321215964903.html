      <h1>Economic climate has South Africans holding onto their cars for longer</h1>
      <h2>Among the findings of a recent Automobile Association (AA) study is the fact that more than 90% of South Africans are keeping their vehicles for longer due to the current economy, with just over 40% keeping their cars for between five and ten years.</h2>

      <p>“The purpose of the research was to determine if current economic factors are playing a role in vehicle ownership. The findings confirm anecdotal evidence that cars are being kept for longer. Just under 35% of people say they are keeping their vehicles for longer than ten years, which is a long lifespan for a vehicle,” said the AA.</p>
      <p>More than 35% of respondents say they are also keeping their vehicles longer because newer models are more reliable. According to the data, more than 25% of primary vehicles are older than five years, and more than 30% are older than ten years.</p>
      <blockquote>“These results point to the increased need for better maintenance of vehicles, and for proper insurance. While our results indicate that more than 60% of the respondents have insurance, national data points to a much lower rate of 35% insurance. If this is indeed the case, there is a cause for concern, as insurance is part of a good maintenance plan for any car,” noted the AA.</blockquote>
      <p>Another interesting finding is that just under 50% of owners say they pay out of pocket for maintenance costs, with only around 20% have maintenance plans for their vehicles. About 20% of owners actively save and plan for maintenance while only 5% do not plan financially at all for maintenance expenses.</p>

      <p>“These results confirm that too many people are relying on their car to never break down and, when it does, they would rather pay out of pocket than have a financial plan – such as a paid maintenance plan in place. Having a maintenance plan, or service plan – even one which is not sourced from the original dealer – is easy to obtain and budget-friendly,” said David Chard, managing director of AA Warranties.</p>
      <p>He said there are some important steps vehicle owners must take to keep their vehicles running for longer. These include:</p>
      <p>• If you are starting a vehicle from cold, allow it to idle for five minutes for the oil to circulate.<br/>• Avoid excessive acceleration, turning and braking.<br/>• Avoid over-revving your vehicle.<br/>• Attend to warning lights immediately. Do not think these will go away in time, as they may indicate serious issues.<br/>• Regularly check tyre pressure. Do this when you stop to refuel. Also check your oil when refuelling.<br/>• Check wheel alignment and balancing every six months, especially after extensive travel.<br/>• Replace serviceable items (e.g. brake pads, fan belts) according to the service schedule of your vehicle.<br/>• Request the parts which were replaced during a service to ensure they were in fact replaced.<br/>• Stick to the servicing schedule of your vehicle. Being proactive about your vehicle’s well-being is part of being a responsible car owner.<br/>• Consider a mechanical warranty to provide “medical aid” cover for your vehicle.

      <p>If you are going on holiday in December, you cannot gamble with a vehicle that is not properly serviced or maintained.</p>
      <p>Apart from the fact that a breakdown could ruin your holiday plans, driving in a vehicle which has not been regularly serviced is dangerous to you and other drivers, and could, in the long run, cost you a whole lot more than just the cost of a service,” concluded the AA.</p>
