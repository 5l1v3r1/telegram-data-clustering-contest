      <p>The Conservatives have claimed immigration would “surge” if Jeremy Corbyn became Britain's Prime Minister.</p>
      <p>But Labour branded it the latest from the Tory Party’s “make-believe research department”.</p>
      <p>The Tories said analysis of new research into Labour’s proposals for open borders suggests net migration “could increase to 840,000 per year if Mr Corbyn is elected as Prime Minister”.</p>
      <p>They said the analysis, described as “fake news” by Labour, was based on official figures and the Government’s own methodology.</p>
      <blockquote>This is equivalent to the combined populations of Manchester and Newcastle moving to the UK every single year</blockquote>
      <p>According to the party, the research shows extending free movement to the rest of the world would result in average net immigration to the UK of 840,000 a year over the next 10 years.</p>
      <p>“This is equivalent to the combined populations of Manchester and Newcastle moving to the UK every single year,” the Tories said.</p>
      <p>“This means that levels of net migration would more than treble if Labour introduced their proposals for completely open borders.”</p>
      <p>The Tories added the analysis is “deliberately cautious and is likely to provide a significant underestimate of net inflows from non-EEA countries under Labour’s plans”.</p>
      <p>The party also said maintaining free movement with existing EEA members would result in average net immigration to the UK of 260,000 a year over the next decade.</p>

      <p>Home Secretary Priti Patel said: “Under Corbyn’s Labour, immigration would surge and put huge strain on schools and our NHS.</p>
      <p>“Jeremy Corbyn has no credible plan for how to deal with the consequences of his open borders policy.</p>
      <p>“The biggest risk to our NHS is Corbyn’s plans for uncontrolled and unlimited immigration, forever.”</p>
      <p>She added: “His plan to hold another two referendums next year – and all the chaos that will bring – will mean that his Government will not have time to focus on the people’s priorities.</p>
      <p>“By contrast, the Conservatives will get Brexit done, end free movement and introduce an Australian-style points system so that we can control our borders and protect our public services.</p>
      <p>“We will reduce immigration overall while being more open and flexible to the highly skilled people we need, such as scientists and doctors.</p>
      <p>“This can only happen if people vote for a Conservative majority Government so we can leave the EU with a deal.”</p>
      <blockquote>Unlike the Tories, we won't scapegoat migrants or deport our own Windrush-generation citizens</blockquote>
      <p>Diane Abbott, Labour’s shadow home secretary, said: “This is more fake news from the Conservative Party’s make-believe research department.</p>
      <p>“Unlike the Tories, we won’t scapegoat migrants or deport our own Windrush-generation citizens.</p>
      <p>“The damage done to our society has been through damaging Conservative cuts to our public services, not by EU nationals coming to work in them.”</p>
