      <p><i>Macrocilix maia</i> is a moth with a most unusual camouflage: it looks like two flies enjoying a delicious supper of fresh bird shit. Is this merely some amusing human poop-pareidolia, or did Macrocilix truly evolve an appearance that made avian predators think it was a poisoned meal? <a href="http://www.myrmecos.net/2011/08/30/a-mural-on-moth-wings/">There is "scant research,"</a> writes research scientist Alex Wild.</p>
      <blockquote>The scant published research on the mural moth is systematic in nature, with nary a mention of the incredible mimicry. In fact, the photo-sharing site Flickr has outpaced any academic work: photographer Allan Lee reports in 2009 that the moth reinforces the imagery with a pungent odor. That’s the extent of our knowledge. Macrocilix maia is a Ph.D. project waiting to happen.</blockquote>
      <p>Wild was writing in 2011. Has anything interesting been learned of Macrocilix since? Google Scholar <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Macrocilix+maia&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C39&amp;as_ylo=2010&amp;as_yhi=">suggests</a> only fleeting references in papers and a book, saying nothing more than Wild's summary. There are <a href="https://www.flickr.com/search/?text=macrocilix%20maia">many splendid specimens on Flickr</a>, all with nearly-identical caco-camo.</p>
