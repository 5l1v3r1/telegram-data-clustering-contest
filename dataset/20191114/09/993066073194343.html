      <p>Offering a peaceful and idyllic lifestyle on Northern Ireland’s only inhabited offshore island, the level of solitude on Rathlin Island is unmatched by anywhere else in this part of the world.</p>
      <p>But the beauty about Rathlin - as well as its rugged landscapes, ocean views, varied wildlife and welcoming locals - is that it maintains a close connection to the mainland if and when you need it.</p>
      <p>Ferry crossings to and from Ballycastle run daily, while services ranging from medical to a mobile library operate on a regular basis.</p>
      <p>If you want to add to the island’s population of around 150, there’s a great opportunity to do so with Rue Cottage - a deceptively spacious accommodation that delivers as a permanent home or excellent holiday retreat.</p>
      <p>Although some modernisation is required, the location, character and those spectacular views over the Sea of Moyle will prove to be more than enough to persuade interested parties to make the crossing.</p>
      <p>The property occupies a spacious site on grounds of approximately two acres and should appeal to a wide range of purchasers, with further inspection strongly recommended by its selling agents to truly appreciate the wondrous surroundings.</p>
      <p>As well as acquiring a superb new home, the successful buyer will become part of the island’s history, and embrace the joys of its burgeoning tourism industry. The island really comes alive in summer as visitors relish the six-mile crossing from Ballycastle, eager to catch a glimpse of what you’ll have on your doorstep.</p>

      <p>Whether its watching the seals come ashore, absorbing the stillness of the harbour or make the descent to the top of the island to see what the island’s puffins are up to - the seabird centre opens from April - there’s much to discover and rediscover time and time again.</p>
      <p>There’s opportunities for sightings of dolphins and golden hares too. But perhaps even rarer is the chance to buy a coveted home in a cherished island that has witnessed a renaissance in recent times and a great community at its heart.</p>
