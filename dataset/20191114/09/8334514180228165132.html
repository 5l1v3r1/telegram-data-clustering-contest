      <p>“The Mandalorian,” which runs on Walt Disney Co’s new Disney+ streaming service, is the first live-action series set in the galaxy far, far away that was first seen on screen in the 1977 movie “Star Wars”.</p>
      <p>The series stars Pedro Pascal as a bounty hunter sent on a sensitive mission. The first season will run for eight episodes.</p>
      <p>“There are lots of surprises in the show. Part of what is fun about doing eight episodes is that each one could have a surprise and twist,” Favreau said in an interview at the premiere in Hollywood.</p>
      <p>The audience was composed largely of fans, some of whom carried bounty-hunter helmets.</p>
      <p>The first episode, released on Tuesday, ended with the Mandalorian finding a character that looks like a baby version of the Jedi Master Yoda from “Star Wars” films.</p>
      <p>It was unclear how the baby may be related to Yoda or fit into the story, sparking debate among fans.</p>
      <p>Favreau and cast members did not shed much light at Wednesday’s premiere. Disney is releasing “Mandalorian” episodes weekly starting on Friday.</p>
      <p>“You have to see the shows to figure out who this baby Yoda really is, and what he is all about, or even if he is really a baby Yoda,” said Carl Weathers, who plays Greef Carga, a man who gives bounty assignments to the Mandalorian.</p>
      <p>“He has his own name, and he is very interesting and very knowledgeable and very cute,” Weathers said. “I never use that word, but he is a cute little guy.”  </p>
