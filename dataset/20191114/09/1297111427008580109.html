      <p>The Regina Pats brought in some new blood as they look to turn things around after a tough start to the WHL season.</p>
      <p>The club announced Wednesday that it had acquired 18-year-old forward Carter Chorney from the Swift Current Broncos.</p>
      <p>Going the other way is 17-year-old defenceman Sam McGinley. The 6’2, 180 pound blueliner was drafted by the Pats in the fifth round of the 2017 WHL Bantam Draft. He has one assist in 11 games.</p>
      <p>Chorney, listed at 6’1 and 171 pounds, was originally a second round pick of the Spokane Chiefs in 2016. The Sherwood Park, Alta. product came into the WHL as a former Alberta Bantam Hockey League 2015 Rookie of the Year. He’s tallied 17 goals and 33 points in 120 WHL games split between the Chiefs and the Broncos.</p>
      <p>The Pats (2-12-2-0) are back in action Saturday when they’ll host the Prince Albert Raiders at the Brandt Centre.</p>
