      <h1>Two ‘Survivor’ Contestants Admit To Exaggerating ‘Inappropriate Touching’ Claims</h1>

      <p>Two “Survivor: Island of the Idols” contestants have confessed to exaggerating claims of inappropriate touching to help get a contestant eliminated.</p>
      <p>Kellee Kim has come forward over recent episodes with allegations of “inappropriate touching” levied against Dan Spilo. To date, Kim has stood by the allegations. Players Missy Byrd and Elizabeth Beisel subsequently shared similar experiences.</p>
      <p>“It’s inappropriate touching. I’m not an object,” Byrd told an upset Kim, per <a href="https://people.com/tv/survivor-contestant-accused-inappropriate-touching-scandal/"><i>People</i></a>. Byrd and Beisel — when Kim was not around — later admitted to exaggerating the allegations to help leverage votes against Spilo.</p>
      <p>Byrd even told Beisel to voice her exaggerated concerns about Spilo to group mom Janet Carbin.</p>
      <p>“You tell her how uncomfortable you are,” Byrd said. “Like, you have a very open mom-daughter moment about how uncomfortable you are. Right now, that’s our only play.”</p>

      <p>“My job is to do whatever it takes to get on the right side of the numbers,” Beisel argued. “The original Vokai are not the biggest fan of Dan, so if I can play up that card in whatever way possible, I’ll do it.”</p>
      <p>Beisel added: “Honestly, I’ve felt safe this entire time and if I had felt uncomfortable I would have said, ‘Please stop.’”</p>
      <p>Kim spoke to producers off-camera and Spilo was given an official warning.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, Carbin voted Spilo off the island but Byrd and Beisel back-doored Kim, the latter of whom was kicked off the island. The truth about Byrd and Beisel’s ploy was subsequently revealed.</p>
      <p>“I feel anything that has to do with sexual uncomfortability has no place in a game environment,” Kim said in a post-game confessional. She added how Byrd and Beisel’s action “disgusts” her.</p>

      <p>Host Jeff Probst explained to <a href="https://ew.com/tv/2019/11/13/survivor-jeff-probst-island-of-the-idols-epsiode-kellee-dan/"><i>Entertainment Weekly</i></a> what the protocol is for handling allegations of sexual misconduct. Probst said the producers have 24/7 access to the contestants and investigate any serious concerns expressed by the players.</p>
      <p>“After Kellee and Missy’s conversation about Dan, one of our co-EP’s interviewed Kellee. This is normal ‘Survivor’ protocol,” Probst explained. “And, as you saw, in the interview Kellee got upset, so our producer stopped the interview to ask if Kellee wanted production to intervene.”</p>
      <p>“Kellee stated that she felt the issue could be handled by the players involved and did not want us to take any action on her behalf,” he added. “The producer immediately shared the story with me and I immediately contacted CBS. The decision was made to meet with all players, both as a group and individually, to remind them of personal boundaries and hear of any concerns.</p>
      <p>“When we met privately with Dan, we told him that his actions were making some of the women uncomfortable and reminded him that personal boundaries must be respected at all times. We also informed him this was an official warning.”</p>
      <p><i>ET Canada</i> has reached out to CBS for comment.</p>
