      <p>Sally showed off their stunning new home with a photo on her official Instagram page, simply writing alongside a yellow heart emoji: "We're in #homesweethome #thelightisntwonkyhonest."</p>

      <p>Sally, 38, and Joe, 49, reportedly told their <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/coronation-street-stars-sally-carman-joe-duttine-real-life-couple-find-love-off-screen-dating/">Corrie co-stars they were dating back in August last year</a>, and went public with their romance at the soap's summer party the same month.</p>
      <p>At the time, a source told <a href="http://thesun.co.uk/">The Sun</a>: "Both Joe and Sally had been single for a while and just met at the right time in their lives.</p>
      <p>"Sally thinks Joe is a funny and caring guy and he’s really fallen for her, too."</p>
      <p>The insider added: "They've now told their castmates and everyone thinks it's a match made in heaven."</p>
      <p>The couple are also said to have known each other from both starring on hit TV show <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/eastenders/eastenders-norma-from-shameless-appears-as-chantelles-nurse/">Shameless</a>.</p>
