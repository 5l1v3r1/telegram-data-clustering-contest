      <h1>Alexandre Lacazette speaks out in support of under-fire Arsenal boss Unai Emery</h1>
      <h2>Emery has come under mounting pressure following a string of poor performances and a record of just two wins from their last 10 Premier League games</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T09:38:28+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 09:38</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Maltby, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matt-maltby/</a></address>
      <p>Alexandre Lacazette has insisted that the Arsenal squad are fully behind Unai Emery despite the club's woeful start to the season.</p>
      <p>The Gunners head coach has come under mounting pressure following a string of poor performances and a record of just two wins from their last 10 Premier League games.</p>
      <p>A 2-0 loss at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> on Saturday evening saw <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> fall eight points behind the current top four, with Emery's target of a return to the Champions League looking as far away as ever.</p>
      <p>But Lacazette says that the squad are desperate to turn things around - and wants to keep Emery in his job.</p>

      <p>"We're working together everyday on a constant basis to pick up the slack," he told the  <a href="https://www.arsenal.com/news/were-very-tight-group-and-doing-all-we-can#">club website</a> .</p>
      <p>"The group definitely supports the coach and I'm sure the club does as well.</p>
      <p>"We're a very tight group, and we're doing everything we can to improve."</p>
      <p>Lacazette's comments come after head of football Raul Sanllehi and managing director Vinai Venkatesham insisted the club still have the right man in charge.</p>

      <p>"We are as disappointed as everyone else with both our results and performances at this stage of the season," they told Arsenal staff at a pre-planned meeting.</p>
      <p>"We share the frustration with our fans, Unai, players and all our staff as they are not at the level we want or expect. Things need to improve to meet our objectives for the season, and we firmly believe Unai is the right man for the job, together with the backroom team we have in place."</p>
      <p>Sanllehi and Venkatesham added: "We are all working intensively behind the scenes to turn things around and are confident we will.</p>
      <p>"We never take our fantastic support for granted. We hope we can all stick together and get behind the team in this challenging period, as together we are stronger."</p>
