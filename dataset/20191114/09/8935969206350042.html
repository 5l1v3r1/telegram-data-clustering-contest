      <p>Disney announced that it's new streaming service Disney+ has registered 10 million customers in just two days since its launch. The company said this was an exceptional announcement, and it would not give further subscriber numbers outside earnings reports. </p>
      <p>Disney+ launched on 12 November in the US, Canada and Netherlands, after a two-month trial in the Netherlands. The service experienced high demand in the first days, with users <a href="https://www.telecompaper.com/news/disney-stutters-at-launch-after-demand-exceeds-expectations--1315965">reporting problems connecting to the site</a>. Disney said this was due to higher-than-expected demand. </p>
