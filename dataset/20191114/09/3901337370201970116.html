      <p>Taking to twitter to share the news, the former Manchester United star bowed out in a way that only he can.</p>
      <p>“I came, I saw, I conquered. Thank you @lagalaxy for making me feel alive again. To the Galaxy fans- you wanted Zlatan, I gave you Zlatan. You are welcome. The story continues...Now go back to watch baseball,” he wrote.</p>

      <p>Ibrahimović exits the league having scored 53 goals in 58 games, contributing a further 15 assists.</p>
      <p>There is still uncertainty as to where his next destination might be, however, with goalscoring figures like that, it’s safe to say Zlatan is far from finished.</p>
