      <p>CONSTRUCTION of the new domestic violence facility in the Peel region is due to start early next year.</p>
      <p>Tenders to construct the new facility were advertised on November 4.</p>
      <p>Mandurah MLA David Templeman said an additional women’s domestic violence service was badly needed.</p>
      <p>“For over 30 years our region has relied on one women’s refuge to provide services to women and families escaping domestic violence,” he said.</p>
      <p>“In the lead up to the 2017 State Election, I was lobbied heavily by numerous stakeholders in the region, including Pat Thomas House, that an additional Women’s Domestic Violence Service was so badly needed.”</p>
      <p>Mr Templeman said the new service would be based on a leading edge therapeutic model, using the latest service delivery, evidence based considerations.</p>
      <p>“This is exciting for our region because we will have a new service that continues to focus on the health and wellbeing of the women and children that will be accessing this service,” he said.</p>
      <p>“I am extremely supportive that we deliver the most modern and effective model for the increasing number of women and families that need domestic violence related services.”</p>
