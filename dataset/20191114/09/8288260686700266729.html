      <p>Argos has launched a stunning TV deal on a 60-inch LG set weeks before Black Friday.</p>
      <p>The early TV Black Friday deal has been spotted by eagle-eyed bargain hunters on deals website <a href="https://www.hotukdeals.com/">HotUKDeals</a> and it has proved to be a hit with over 600 users voting it as a good deal.</p>
      <p>Argos has cut the price of the <a href="https://fave.co/2CGsNn3">4K Active HDR TV to just £449</a> , down from over £500, while a 55-inch version is priced at £429.</p>
      <p>Users of the site say the TV was originally around £550 in the summer, meaning the price has dropped by over £100 in the last few months.</p>
      <p>The same TV is listed on eBay for over £600, <a href="https://amzn.to/2Qkg3KH">Amazon for £684.</a> It is also the same price as the same model LG TV but with a 50-inch screen on <a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=213635&amp;awinmid=1599&amp;clickref=Birmingham-Argos&amp;platform=dl&amp;p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.currys.co.uk%252Fgbuk%252Fsearch-keywords%252Fxx_xx_xx_xx_xx%252F60um7100plb%252Fxx-criteria.html%5D%5D">Currys PC World.</a></p>
      <p>The deal represents a saving of up to £200 compared to Amazon and other online retailers and could be one of the biggest Black Friday TV deals weeks before the big event.</p>
      <p>Black Friday takes place on 29 November and typically sees retailers drastically reduce the price of TV sets and other electronic items.</p>
      <p>Argos will launch an official Black Friday sale closer to the day. A landing page is already up and running on <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=76202X1531042&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.argos.co.uk%2Fevents%2Fblack-friday&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.birminghammail.co.uk%2Fwhats-on%2Fshopping%2Fargos-selling-60-inch-tv-17254137">the Argos website</a> detailing how their customers can get a head start on their Christmas shopping.</p>
      <p>A special email list has already been created to update customers on all Black Friday deals and savings, while, elsewhere, early discount codes have been released and clearance sales have already begun on categories including everything from gifts and jewellery to toys and technology.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/whats-on/shopping/amazon-black-friday-2019-deals-17088511">Amazon will launch its Black Friday sale,</a> which will also include TV sets, on 22 November with an eight-day sale.</p>
