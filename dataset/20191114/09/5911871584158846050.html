      <p>Spike Lee is headed to the 1980s hip-hop scene.</p>
      <p>The filmmaker, who last directed <i>BlacKkKlansman</i>, has closed a deal to direct <i>Prince Of Cats</i>, Legendary’s adaptation of a graphic novel written and illustrated by Ron Wimberly. Lee will also rewrite the script and work with Wimberly and scribe Selwyn Seyfu Hinds.</p>
      <p>The project is described as an ’80s-set hip-hop take on Shakespeare’s <i>Romeo &amp; Juliet</i>, with the tragic star-crossed love story seen through the eyes of Tybalt, Juliet’s angry and duel-loving cousin.</p>
      <p>The film centers on Tybalt and his Capulet brothers, who navigate Da People’s Republic Of Brooklyn, where underground sword dueling — including katanas — with the rival Montagues blossoms into a vibrant world. That world includes hip-hop essentials such as DJing, emceeing, breakdancing, and graffiti.</p>
      <p>Hinds wrote the initial script for the adaptation of the graphic novel that originated from Vertigo and was then reissued by Image Comics. Hinds’ knowledge of the hip-hop world stems from his time as editor-in-chief of <i>The Source</i> magazine. Hinds also serves as a comic writer, having penned an episode of Jordan Peele’s update of <i>The Twilight Zone</i>.</p>
      <p>Janet and Kate Zucker of Zucker Productions will produce <i>Prince Of Cats</i>, with Legendary’s Jon Silk and Ali Mendes overseeing for the company.</p>
      <p>Though originally slated to star, <i>Knives Out</i> actor Lakeith Stanfield is no longer attached to the project.</p>
      <p><i>BlacKkKlansman </i>put Lee back on top of Hollywood studios’ phone sheet, netting him Oscar nominations for best picture and director and a win for best adapted screenplay. He is in postproduction on <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/chadwick-boseman-star-spike-lees-next-movie-netflix-1186145"><i>Da 5 Bloods</i></a>, a thriller which counts Chadwick Boseman, Paul Walter Hauser, and Jonathan Majors in its ensemble.</p>
      <p><i>Prince Of Cats</i> returns Lee to telling sagas featuring his beloved Brooklyn, which has been the setting of many of his films, including <i>She’s Gotta Have It</i>, <i>Do The Right Thing</i>, <i>Jungle Fever</i>, <i>Crooklyn</i>, <i>Clockers</i>, <i>He Got Game</i>, and <i>Red Hook Summer</i>.</p>
      <p>Lee is repped by ICM Partners.</p>
