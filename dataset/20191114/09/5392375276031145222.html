      <p>For Android smartphones, the triple rear camera setup have now been relegated to mid-range devices. This means that flagship smartphones now go after Quad- or Penta-rear camera setup. Also, the arrangement of these cameras also matters and the upcoming Vivo V17 shows just that. Recently some real images of the <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/vivo">Vivo</a> V17 appeared online. The smartphone design shows that it uses a water drop full-screen display. However, it is its diamond-shape quad-rear camera setup that catches the eye.</p>

      <p>The diamond read quad-camera setup uses a 48MP + 8MP + 2MP + 2MP configuration. On the front, we have a 32MP camera while a 4390 mAh (no information on the fast charge). battery keeps the lights of this phone on. This smartphone also comes with a gravity sensor, a distance sensor, a light sensor, an on-screen fingerprint sensor, and a fast charge. The name “Vivo V17” is for the global version.
