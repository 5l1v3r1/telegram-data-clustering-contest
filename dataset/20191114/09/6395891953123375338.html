      <p><b>BRUSSELSÂ (AP)</b> - The European Union's top migration official is warning Bosnian authorities of a likely humanitarian crisis this winter due to appalling conditions in overcrowded migrant camps in the country.</p>
      <p>EU Migration Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos called Thursday for the closure of the Vucjak camp near Bihac in northwest Bosnia, an old landfill site located near a minefield.</p>
      <p>Avramopoulos says adequate accommodation must be provided for around 8,000 migrants "to prevent a major humanitarian crisis in the coming winter."</p>
      <p>He says the EU has given Bosnia over 36 million euros ($40 million) in aid, but that conditions at Vucjak are so bad that "no EU financial support can, or will be, provided for it."</p>
      <p>An estimated 50,000 migrants have crossed Bosnia since last year bound for the EU.</p>
