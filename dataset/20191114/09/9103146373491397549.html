      <p><b>The report quoted a Google executive as saying the company’s approach "is going to be to partner deeply with banks and the financial system" in what might be seen as a longer but safer route.<br/></b><u>TECHNOLOGY</u><b><br/><br/>Google plans to launch a checking account service next year in a collaboration with Citigroup and a credit union in Silicon Valley, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday.<br/></b> <br/>In a project code-named Cache, Google is working on a system that will host checking accounts clearly bearing the brands of the financial institutions, which will handle security and regulatory compliance issues, according to the Journal report.<br/> <br/>The report quoted a Google executive as saying the company’s approach "is going to be to partner deeply with banks and the financial system" in what might be seen as a longer but safer route.<br/> <br/>The move would come as internet titans become increasingly involved in online financial transactions and e-commerce.<br/> <br/>Apple and Google both offer digital wallets that can be used on smartphones to pay for purchases online or in real-world shops.<br/> <br/>Apple also recently released a credit card.<br/> <br/>Amazon has been reported to be in talks with banks about creating a checking account service.<br/> <br/>Meanwhile, Facebook has been steadily building up e-commerce tools at the social network as well as the ability to send money using its messaging apps such as WhatsApp.<br/> <br/>Facebook has gone a major step further, releasing controversial plans for a global cryptocurrency called Libra.<br/> <br/>Facebook had originally hoped to roll out Libra next year but has met fierce resistance from regulators and governments who see it as a threat to their monetary sovereignty.<br/> <br/>The social media giant's chief executive Mark Zuckerberg last month opened the door to scaling back plans for Libra if it cannot win approval as a new currency for global exchanges.<br/> <br/>Zuckerberg told US lawmakers on October 23 that the goal of Libra was "to build a global payment system rather than a currency".  </p>
