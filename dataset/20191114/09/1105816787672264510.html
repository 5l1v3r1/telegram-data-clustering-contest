      <p><b>ISLAMABAD: </b>Special Assistant to Prime Minister Imran Khan on Information and Broadcasting Firdous Ashiq Awan asked Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) on Thursday not to do politics on the health of former premier Nawaz Sharif, according to <a href="http://www.radio.gov.pk/14-11-2019/dr-firdous-invites-opposition-to-sit-with-govt-for-resolution-of-problems-faced-by-masses"><i>Radio Pakistan</i></a>.</p>

      <p>Speaking to the media in Islamabad, she said PML-N should act responsibly and take advantage of the facility extended by the government for Nawaz’s treatment abroad.</p>
      <p>“The government has demonstrated flexibility and gave him out-of-the-box one-time waiver to get the treatment abroad,” said Awan.</p>
      <p>The minister added, “As per law, names of the convicted persons are not removed from the Exit Control List (ECL).”</p>
      <p>Awan said the government only sought guarantee in the form of an indemnity bond which she termed “a legal requirement”.</p>
      <p>“The PML-N should not make it a matter of its ego. Submit the indemnity bond and take Nawaz Sharif abroad for the treatment,” she maintained.</p>
      <p>According to Awan, Prime Minister Imran had directed his team to refrain from doing any politics on the health of the PML-N supremo.</p>
      <p>She also invited opposition parties to sit with the government for the resolution of problems faced by the masses.</p>
      <p>“The parliament is functional and the opposition should cooperate with the government for the passage of people-friendly legislation.”</p>
      <p>Awan said, “The government has put the country on the right track and the economy is heading towards stability.”</p>
      <p>Commenting on Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl’s (JUI-F) ‘Azadi March’, she said the people would not support the elements bent upon stoking instability in the country.</p>
      <p>“JUI-F’s plan B will also flop like his Plan A. People fully understand the motives behind party chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman’s move.</p>

      <p>“Shakespeare has written that the world is a stage. People come here, play their character and go. In the play of Pakistani politics, the role of Nawaz Sharif and [Asif Ali] Zardari has ended. New characters don’t give them any importance now other than using them to increase their roles,” said the minister in a tweet while criticising the PML-N and Pakistan People’s Party (PPP).</p>
