      <h1>Hong Kong Open: Srikanth advances to quarter-finals; Sindhu, Prannoy, Kashyap knocked out</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T09:22:56+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 09:22</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toireporter/author-Suhas-Nayse-479106005.cms" target="_blank">Suhas Nayse</a></address>
      <p>HONG KONG: Kidambi Srikanth remained the lone survivor as other Indians including PV Sindhu crashed out of the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Hong-Kong-Open">Hong Kong Open</a> BWF World Tour Super 500 <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Badminton">badminton</a> tournament on Thursday.</p>
      <p>It was a disastrous day for the Indian shuttlers as they went down fighting in their respective categories. Srikanth survived the onslaught as he edged past his Indian counterpart Sourabh Verma to seal his place in the quarterfinals.</p>
      <p>The most disappointing result among the Indian camp was the second round exit of Sindhu. The sixth seed had never lost against Busanan Ongbamrungphan of Thailand in their last ten encounters since 2012. But on Thursday, the Thai girl turned the tables on her nemesis to avenge her earlier defeats. The reigning world champion bit the dust despite dominating the second game.</p>
      <p>Breaking the series of earlier lossses, Busanan won 21-18, 11-21, 21-16 in a marathon match which lasted for an hour and nine minutes.</p>
      <p>Sindhu struggled in the first game against world No. 18 Busanan, who surprised her fancied rival by claiming the opener at 21-18.</p>
      <p>Stunned by the reversal, Rio Olympics silver medallist produced a far better display as she raced to a quick-fire 21-11 win in the second game.</p>
      <p>Despite thrashing, Busanan did not give up. The 23-year-old Thai player put Sindhu under tremendous pressure by taking an early lead in the decider. She then maintained her lead to hand Sindhu yet another early defeat since her triumph in the World Championship in August.</p>
      <p>Srikanth halted the impressive run of qualifier Sourabh Verma with a nail-biting 21-11, 15-21, 21-19 win in the men's singles second round.</p>
      <p>In an all-Indian clash, world No. 13 Srikanth needed almost an hour to pip reigning national champion Sourabh. In their only previous outing six years ago in French Open, Srikanth also needed three games to down gutsy Sourabh. Former world No. 1 Srikanth will now square off against fifth seed Chen Long of China.</p>
      <p>It was a heart-breaking defeat for Parupalli Kashyap. The former Indian top player Kashyap wasted three match points to lose 21-12, 21-23, 10-21 against second seed Chou Tien Chen in an hour. Kashyap, world No. 25, was so close to pull out upset of the day but could not capitalize on three match points in the second game.</p>
      <p>In the mixed doubles, Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Ashwini Ponnappa wasted a fine start to lose against fourth seeds Yuta Watanabe and Arisa Higashino of Japan 19-21, 12-21.</p>
