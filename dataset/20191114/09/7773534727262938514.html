        <b>A new international survey from Merck has demonstrated a significant lack of knowledge about the risk factors associated with type 2 diabetes. </b>
      </p>
      <p>The survey, undertaken for Merck by YouGov between 14-22 October 2019, included 9,350 participants across nine countries (Brazil, Mexico, Russia, UAE, Malaysia, Vietnam, China, Saudi Arabia and Chile). The findings coincide with World Diabetes Day, a global awareness campaign focused on diabetes mellitus.</p>
      <p>Findings from the research show that 56% of respondents were unaware that the condition can be prevented, and a further 41% have no knowledge of the steps that can be taken to prevent or delay the development of the condition.</p>
      <p>Globally, more than 450 million people are currently living with diabetes – it is believed that one in two of those are undiagnosed.</p>
      <p>According to the International Diabetes Federation, the vast majority of these cases are type 2 diabetes, which can be prevented or delayed by a variety of lifestyle factors.</p>
      <p>Additional findings demonstrated that 46% of respondents across all countries are either unaware or unsure that having a family member with diabetes increases the risk of developing the condition.</p>
      <p>A further 29% believe that symptoms of early stage diabetes can be observed – however, it usually has no signs or symptoms and can only be diagnosed with lab tests.</p>
      <p>“The results of this international survey demonstrate that more needs to be done to raise awareness of diabetes and its causes. With close to 700 million people predicted to develop type 2 diabetes by 2045, we need to act now to address pre-diabetes and help prevent a disease that can cause many long-term and permanent complications for people,” said Francois Feig, head of general medicine &amp; endocrinology at Merck.</p>
      <p>“We know that type 2 diabetes can, in many cases, be delayed or prevented, which is why it is crucial that we continue to educate people about the risk factors and the lifestyle changes that can really make a difference,” he added.</p>
      <p>Diabetes is a chronic condition, and is a leading cause of blindness, lower-limb amputation, cardiovascular disease and kidney failure. It can, in severe cases, lead to early death and is on the rise in most countries across the world.</p>
      <p>However, people who are at a high risk of developing diabetes can prevent the onset of the condition through adopting a healthier lifestyle and taking certain <a href="http://www.pmlive.com/pharma_news/type_1_diabetes_prevention_promise_sends_provention_bio_soaring_1290512">medications</a>, if necessary.</p>
      <p>Individuals who are at high-risk of developing diabetes include those who have family members with the condition, among other factors.</p>
