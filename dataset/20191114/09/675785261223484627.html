      <h1>England v Montenegro prediction and odds as in-form striker Marcus Rashford's hot streak set to continue</h1>
      <h2>Your best bets for Thursday night's international football action</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T09:53:02+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 09:53</time> by <a rel="author">Dave Prentice</a></address>
      <p>Montenegro's nickname is the Brave Falcons, but the Balkan birds of prey have had their wings clipped even before Thursday's trip to Wembley. <br/><br/>Devoured 5-1 by the Three Lions in March, they head to Wembley without the majority of their first choice defence. <br/><br/>Six of the seven defenders in the Montenegran squad boast no more than seven international caps - and that has to influence our punting on the match.</p>
      <h3>Best bets</h3>
      <p><b>England -3 handicap 13/10 - bet</b> <b><a href="https://play.thepools.com/sportsbook/SOCCER/IG_FR/4183938/?utm_medium=inline-editorial&amp;utm_source=reach-nationworkwide&amp;utm_campaign=football_odds_editorial">here</a></b></p>
      <p><b>Republic of Ireland to win and Under 2.5 goals 11/4 - bet</b> <b><a href="https://play.thepools.com/sportsbook/SOCCER/IG_FR/4183938/?utm_medium=inline-editorial&amp;utm_source=reach-nationworkwide&amp;utm_campaign=football_odds_editorial">here</a> </b><br/><br/>Of course England will also be missing Raheem Sterling, but that just means that Jadon Sancho and Marcus Rashford are likely to flank Harry Kane up front. <br/><br/>And England should score goals. <br/><br/>All five of England's group wins so far have seen them winning at half-time, so the half-time/full-time prediction is a slim <b><a href="https://play.thepools.com/sportsbook/SOCCER/IG_FR/4183938/?utm_medium=inline-editorial&amp;utm_source=reach-nationworkwide&amp;utm_campaign=football_odds_editorial">4/11</a> </b>. <br/><br/>But more reliable is England to win and <b><a href="https://play.thepools.com/sportsbook/SOCCER/IG_FR/4183938/?utm_medium=inline-editorial&amp;utm_source=reach-nationworkwide&amp;utm_campaign=football_odds_editorial">over 3.5 goals, which is is 4/5</a> </b>, but even better is <b><a href="https://play.thepools.com/sportsbook/SOCCER/IG_FR/4183938/?utm_medium=inline-editorial&amp;utm_source=reach-nationworkwide&amp;utm_campaign=football_odds_editorial">England -3 handicap at 13/10</a> </b>. <br/><br/>So who will score the goals?</p>

      <p>Marcus Rashford is bang in form, witness that filthy piece of skill which Match of the Day 2 highlighted against Brighton, and has scored six goals in seven games since opening the scoring against Bulgaria in October. <br/><br/>He's <b><a href="https://play.thepools.com/sportsbook/SOCCER/IG_FR/4183938/?utm_medium=inline-editorial&amp;utm_source=reach-nationworkwide&amp;utm_campaign=football_odds_editorial">23/10</a> </b>to score first at Wembley. <br/><br/>Republic of Ireland are also in action the same night, in an international friendly against New Zealand. <br/><br/>Just days before a crunch tie with Denmark, Mick McCarthy will rotate his squad and blood some youngsters. <br/><br/>The Kiwis are on a solid run of six games unbeaten .... but New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea and Vanuatu, currently ranked 155, 165 and 163 in the world, were hardly likely to threaten.</p>

      <p>And that run kicked off with a 13-0 demolition of Tonga.</p>
      <p>The Republic are currently 36th in the world, to New Zealand's 121 ranking. <br/><br/>So <b><a href="https://play.thepools.com/sportsbook/SOCCER/IG_FR/4183938/?utm_medium=inline-editorial&amp;utm_source=reach-nationworkwide&amp;utm_campaign=football_odds_editorial">4/7</a> </b>is a solid enough price for the home win, but don't expect a goalfest. <br/><br/>Twelve of the Republic’s last 16 home matches have seen fewer than three goals scored, and McCarthy’s side have averaged just 0.7 goals per game since the beginning of 2018. <br/><br/>That tallies well with New Zealand's record on the road (only six of their last 16 trips have yielded three or more) so <b><a href="https://play.thepools.com/sportsbook/SOCCER/IG_FR/4183938/?utm_medium=inline-editorial&amp;utm_source=reach-nationworkwide&amp;utm_campaign=football_odds_editorial">under 2.5 goals at 3/4</a> </b>is the value call. <br/><br/>But best call of all is Republic to win and Under 2.5 goals, which is a great <b><a href="https://play.thepools.com/sportsbook/SOCCER/IG_FR/4183938/?utm_medium=inline-editorial&amp;utm_source=reach-nationworkwide&amp;utm_campaign=football_odds_editorial">11/4 price</a> </b>.</p>
