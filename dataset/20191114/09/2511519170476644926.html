      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Olivia_Colman">Olivia Colman</a> has condemned the treatment of <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/PrinceHarry">Prince Harry</a> and <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/meghan-markle">Meghan Markle</a> by some parts of the British press, calling it “evil” and “mean”. </p>
      <p>The actor, who is set to play Queen Elizabeth II in the third series of <i>The Crown</i>, was asked if her new role has given her a greater understanding of the pressures faced by the royals.</p>
      <p>"It's just evil," she told <i><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/crowns-olivia-colman-slams-treatment-20877361">The Mirror</a></i>. "They're mean to them. Everything they do, they step outside their house and it's something.</p>
      <p>"I don't know why they're so mean to a fellow human being. It always strikes me as odd." </p>
      <p>The royal couple recently confirmed they will spend Christmas with Markle’s mother Doria Ragland in the US rather than staying with the Queen, a decision which has been met with some criticism.</p>
      <p>Colman said: "Everyone wants a little Christmas on their own every now and again. It's alright." </p>
      <p>The new episodes of <i>The Crown</i> begin in 1964 and will cover the Queen’s Silver Jubilee, the moon landing and Prince Charles’s relationship with a young Camilla Shand.</p>
      <p><i>The Crown</i> season three will arrive on Netflix on 17 November. </p>
