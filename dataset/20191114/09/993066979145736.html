      <p>A new detached family home in the stunning Newry and Mourne region, 21B Lower Carrogs Road, Burren occupies a pleasant rural setting - yet is only three miles from the centre of Newry.</p>
      <p>Sitting on a site of c. 0.45 acres, the home has been thoughtfully designed for modern living and offers flexible accommodation.</p>
      <p>Finished to a good specification, the property will have broad appeal and an internal viewing is highly recommended.</p>
      <p>The lounge features an opening for a fireplace, tv point and radiator, while a multi-fuel burning stove can be utilised in the family room.</p>
      <p>French doors to the hallway add a touch of class in a home that blossoms with a high quality finish from every corner and surface.</p>
      <p>The kitchen - benefitting from recessed lighting and USB ports - opens to the coveted sun room, which in turn paves the way for access to the rear patio area.</p>
      <p>Four generous sized bedrooms are perfect for families, with one featuring built-in wardrobes.</p>
      <p>The gardens to the front, side and rear set the tone for the roaming landscapes in the distance, serving up peace and tranquility that will prove irresistible to many interested purchasers.</p>
      <p>The opportunities for a high quality standard of living here are endless.</p>
      <p>It’s just a few miles from the spectacular Kilbroney Forest Park and with it an abundance of activities, while the beauty of Carlingford Lough and the Cooley Peninsula can be absorbed and explored time and time again.</p>
      <p>A good roads network and the magnificent Scenic Carlingford Ferry increase the number of options for getting around this remarkable region, whether it’s for work or leisure.</p>
      <p>There are plenty of hidden gems in Warrenpoint and Rostrevor, but for extensive business and retail opportunities, Newry is only a short drive away.</p>
      <p>But if you truly want to get away from it all, seaside retreats - with Newcastle a mere 20 miles away - are plentiful.</p>
