      <p>UPDATE: The bushfire warning in Wundowie has been downgraded to a watch and act alert as firefighters battle to bring the blaze under control.</p>
      <p>There is still a possible threat to lives and homes in the area, as volunteer and career firefighters are on the scene.</p>
      <p>The fire started near the intersection of Werribee Road and Vineyard Road at 3.45pm, with homes in Hawke Avenue previously under threat.</p>
      <p>Locals should leave now for a safer place if the way is clear.</p>
      <p>If they cannot leave, they should get ready to shelter in their homes and actively defend them.</p>
      <p>Residents should close all doors and windows and turn off evaporative air conditioners, but keep the water running through the system if possible.</p>
