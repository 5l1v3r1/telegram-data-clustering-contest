      <p>With the game due for release tomorrow, Currys has launched an early Nintendo Switch Black Friday bundle with Pokémon Sword or Pokémon Shield for £279.</p>
      <p>It's all a part of their 'Black Friday Now' sale, which guarantees the price you pay now will not be beaten on Black Friday proper - or they'll refund you the difference.</p>

      <p>Considering that a Nintendo Switch would usually set you back £279 on its own, you're essentially getting Game Freak's latest Pokémon entry for free. It's the kind of Nintendo Switch Black Friday deal we'd expect to see once the sales event has kicked off at the end of the month. But, hey, we'll take it at this early stage too!</p>

      <p>Bundles featuring the Nintendo Switch Lite in its various colours and either Pokémon Sword or Pokémon Shield are also available. However, these will set you back £219. That puts the price of the monster-gathering RPG down to just £20, but it's not quite as appealing as free, is it? Nevertheless, you may be after the handheld-focused version of the Nintendo Switch instead.</p>

      <p>Honestly, I really don't expect this to be beaten on Black Friday. We've already seen that the US is getting a Nintendo Switch with Mario Kart 8 Deluxe bundle for $299 as their main Nintendo Switch Black Friday deal. That's the old version of the console, too, with the shorter battery life. Seems like a poorly-disguised attempt at stock clearance more than anything.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, in the UK, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-11-05-amazon-drops-some-early-nintendo-switch-black-friday-bundles">Amazon launched a range of new Nintendo Switch bundles from £299.99</a>. Perhaps we could see some of these discounted to match the latest Currys PC World offer, but who knows if they'll match it! Definitely snap this up, then, if a Nintendo Switch with Pokémon Sword or Shield is the gift you're after this Christmas.</p>
