      <p>Set to Can't Fight This Feeling by REO Speedwagon, and re-recorded by Bastille's Dan Smith, fans are calling the two-and-a-half-minute advert adorable.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The ad, which will air on TV for the first time this Saturday, during the ad break of <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/x-factor/">X Factor: Celebrity</a>, centres around the theme of bringing people together at Christmas through delicious food and thoughtful gifts.</p>

      <p>But sadly for Edgar, the excitement is just too much to bear. The enthusiastic dragon is unable to contain his excitement for the festivities, finding it increasingly hard to control his instinct to breathe fire.</p>

      <p>He ruins the town's Christmas decorations, a snowman built by a group of kids and he accidentally melts an ice rink.</p>

      <p>Worried he will ruin the Christmas festivities even further, Edgar shuts himself away. But his best friend Ava dreams up the ideal way to show Edgar how much she cares about him.</p>
