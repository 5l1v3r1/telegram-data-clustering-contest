      <h2>Henderson and Suarez clashed soon after the midfielder arrived at Anfield</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T09:39:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 09:39</time> by <a rel="author">Harry Latham-Coyle</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Jordan_Henderson">Jordan Henderson</a> has revealed why he was “ready to kill” Luiz Suarez after joining <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/LiverpoolFC">Liverpool</a>.</p>
      <p>Henderson joined the club from Sunderland during the summer transfer window in 2011, six months after Suarez arrived from Ajax.</p>
      <p>The midfielder, then just 20, has now revealed that Suarez used to denigrate Henderson in training while he was still embedding himself at the club.</p>
      <p>“I was trying to do the best I can do. Being a footballer, there is criticism and people doubting you all the time,” Henderson told <i><a href="https://audioboom.com/posts/7423129-jordan-henderson">The Greatest Game with Jamie Carragher</a> </i>podcast.</p>
      <p>“At that time, I was a young player and there were one or two things Luis did in training that I didn’t like.</p>
      <p>“It made me feel I wasn’t good enough to be in the same team in training.</p>
      <p>“The arms were up like ‘what the f***, what is he doing’, like I shouldn’t be there.</p>
      <p>“That really hurt me. He did it three times and then I exploded and I was ready to kill him.”</p>
      <p>Suarez and Henderson would both become integral figures in the Liverpool side, particularly in pushing <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/ManchesterCity">Manchester City</a> close in the race for the 2013/14 <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/PremierLeague">Premier League</a> title.</p>
      <p>Suarez departed Anfield after that season, while Henderson has since gone on succeed <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/StevenGerrard">Steven Gerrard</a> as club captain.</p>
      <p>And despite those early incidents, Henderson did confirm that the pair soon patched things up and Suarez became a guiding presence for the midfielder.</p>
      <p>From that point, I had a good relationship with Luis. The next game I set him up for his goal.</p>
      <p>“He was brilliant with me after that and I was really close to him after that and he was another big player I learned from.”</p>
