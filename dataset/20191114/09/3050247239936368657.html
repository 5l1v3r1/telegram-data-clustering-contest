      <h1>Bitcoin Fixes This: PayPal Cuts Payouts to Over 100,000 Pornhub Models</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T09:00:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 09:00</time> by <a rel="author">William Suberg</a></address>
      <p>Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price-index">BTC</a>) is being championed as the solution to a new payment crisis affecting the adult entertainment website Pornhub. In a <a href="https://www.pornhub.com/blog/9122">blog post</a> on Nov. 14, Pornhub revealed that payment processor <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/paypal">PayPal</a> had abruptly stopped servicing its models. </p>
      <h3>Pornhub hits out at attack on “livelihoods”</h3>
      <p>Previously, models throughout the world received payouts via PayPal, which has not publicly stated why it cut them out of its platform. </p>
      <p>“We are all devastated by PayPal's decision to stop payouts to over a hundred thousand performers who rely on them for their livelihoods,” the blog post reads.</p>
      <p>Pornhub is now using direct funds transfer alternatives, which models must set up themselves. The website <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-accounts-for-less-than-1-percent-of-pornhub-purchases">began a deal</a> with cryptocurrency project Verge (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/verge">XVG</a>) last year, while users can purchase products with various cryptocurrencies via Pornhub’s <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/pornhub-partners-with-pumapay-to-accept-crypto-as-payments">partnership</a> with merchant gateway PumaPay.</p>
      <h3>Models unaware of cryptocurrency</h3>
      <p>The debacle is just the latest in a string of skittish moves from PayPal, which has become well known for its seemingly <a href="https://twitter.com/getongab/status/1056283312522637312">arbitrary</a> account shutdowns. </p>
      <p>In each case, Bitcoin proponents highlight the benefit of using censorship-resistant cryptocurrency instead. Bitcoin transactions cannot be canceled or denied by a third party since they are peer-to-peer.</p>
      <p>Pornhub’s problems, despite the Verge deal, nonetheless put the lack of overall knowledge of cryptocurrency in the spotlight. </p>
      <p>“Crypto, personal portal... LOL. I don’t understand what that even is. I’m cool with just direct deposit into my bank account,” Shyla Jennings, a prominent model on the site, responded to the news on <a href="https://twitter.com/shylajdotcom/status/1194823038228934659">Twitter</a>.</p>
      <p>Jennings added she did not use PayPal herself, as the service had had her “blacklisted for years.”</p>
