      <p><b>INTERVIEW</b>: Indiegogo CEO Andy Yang (<i>pictured</i>) explained the company developed a feature to enable entrepreneurs to continuously raise capital, as the crowdfunding platform moves to expand its offerings.</p>
      <p>The executive outlined its InDemand feature as a key difference between the company and its competitors, as it “helps entrepreneurs fund beyond their initial campaign”, enabling them to stick with the platform “and continue to raise capital”.</p>
      <p>“We have this entrepreneur community and this backer consumer community, and we are trying to connect them through conversation and different campaigns”.</p>
      <p>Since the start of his tenure in May, Yang said he has seen a rise in the number of repeat entrepreneurs and campaigners using the platform. This is currently concentrated on North America, which comprises about a third of the company’s business.</p>
      <p>Yang also discussed some of the most notable projects in the mobile tech sector which are supported by the platform, along with its participation in the 4 Years From Now event at MWC19 Los Angeles.</p>
