      <h1>Four things West Ham fans should watch out for during the international break ahead of Spurs</h1>
      <h2>The Hammers host their bitter rivals after the international break with manager Manuel Pellegrini hoping for no new injury concerns</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T09:00:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 09:00</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Inkersole</a></address>
      <p>The first batch of international break fixtures arrive on Thursday but there are still nine days of the arduous stoppage in the Premier League to get through before we can concentrate on club matters once again.</p>
      <p>The break has come at a good time for the Hammers though as they need to regroup following a dismal run of form which has seen them pick up no wins in their previous six matches and just one victory in their past nine outings.</p>
      <p>That has seen Manuel Pellegrini's side nosedive from fifth in the standings to a lowly 16th and their good start to the campaign has been thrown away quickly.</p>
      <p>Spurs too have problems of their own heading into next weekend's matchup, only two places above the Hammers in the table and haven't won away from home since January and some reports claiming a defeat to the Hammers could see Mauricio Pochettino sacked from his job just a few months after taking Tottenham to the Champions League final.</p>
      <p>But, there is still some football to be played over the international break, so what should Hammers fans be looking out for?</p>
      <h3>Winston Reid's comeback</h3>
      <p>The Hammers centre back hasn't played in the Premier League in 19 months, having had three outings in pre-season and 65 minutes for the U23s ten days ago.</p>
      <p>The centre back has been called up to the New Zealand squad for their friendly against Ireland and is expected to feature at the Aviva Stadium on Thursday.</p>
      <p>With Fabian Balbuena struggling for form and Angelo Ogbonna frozen out by Pellegrini, it could be interesting to note if and how Reid comes through his outing with the All Whites in terms of a potential Premier League recall.</p>

      <p>Ireland manager Mick McCarthy has taken the unusual step of naming his starting eleven a day early, announcing it on Wednesday and Hammers midfielder Josh Cullen will start in the Irish midfield.</p>
      <p>Cullen has been excelling once again on loan with Charlton Athletic and is out of contract in east London at the end of the season. But there are some calls for him to be given a chance in midfield back at his parent club.</p>
      <p>The academy graduate has been progressing well but seemingly not done quite enough to impress Pellegrini. If he bosses at international level, then the manager will have to take notice.</p>
      <h3>Declan Rice's England performance</h3>
      <p>Some have, bizarrely, called Rice's place in the England squad into question over the last two breaks and there is a very odd theory going around that because of the nature of his first call-up, Gareth Southgate feels obliged to pick him. Nonsense.</p>
      <p>Rice is going through his first dip in form since establishing himself as a first team regular at the Hammers, he's putting out fires all over the pitch as his teammates struggle and his own form has been affected as a result.</p>
      <p>The 20-year-old is a key cog for the Hammers in midfield and they need him to rediscover his early season form if they are to start hauling themselves back up the table.</p>
      <h3>Spurs' long-distance travellers</h3>

      <p>Son Heung-min, who will be available for the Hammers game after his suspension was overturned, plays for South Korea away at Lebanon and Brazil in Abu Dhabi across the international break. Gionavi Lo Celso and Juan Foyth also play Brazil for Argentina in Saudi Arabia and against Uruugay in Israel.</p>
      <p>Davinson Sanchez has a trip to the USA as he plays to games for Colombia against Peru in Florida and Ecuador in New Jersey with the later game on Wednesday at am UK time, meaning he won't be potentially back in England until very late on Thursday.</p>
      <p>While they aren't massive journeys, it can still take its toll and the Hammers players certainly don't have such long journeys ahead of them during the break.</p>
