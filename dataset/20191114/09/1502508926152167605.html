      <p>Surplus rainfall in August and September is likely to keep food and vegetable prices elevated going forward, and <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/retail-inflation">retail inflation </a>may average at around 4 per cent in FY20, an SBI research report said.</p>
      <p>In October, inflation based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) spiked to a 16-month high of 4.62 per cent on costlier food items.</p>
      <p>In 2019 five states- Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Karnataka bore the brunt of excess rainfall and were affected by severe floods.</p>
      <p>The surplus rainfall during August and September seriously damaged many Kharif crops.</p>
      <p>"Going forward, thus, food and vegetable prices could remain elevated and inflation prints in November still may be on a higher side due to the low base in 2018. We expect FY20 CPI to now average closer at 4 per cent," SBI research report- Ecowrap said.</p>
      <p>In the fourth bi-monthly monetary policy announced in October, RBI had projected at 3.5-3.7 per cent for H2 of FY20 and 3.6 per cent for the first quarter of FY21.</p>
      <p>The report said even as food CPI will remain elevated, core CPI will go below 3 per cent in this fiscal.</p>
      <p>According to the report, RBI may cut repo rate in the upcoming December monetary policy meeting and may pause thereafter on concerns over inflation.</p>
      <p>"We expect a December rate cut, but beyond December it will be a close decision (as inflation prints beyond October will remain elevated). Thus, it will be better if the rate cut is front loaded in December," the report added.</p>
