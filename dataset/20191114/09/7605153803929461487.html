        <b>NAIROBI, Kenya, Nov 14 – Nairobi Jubilee MCAs allied to the ousted Majority Leader Abdi Guyo now want the party to conduct elections, days after it unveiled temporary Assembly leadership following leadership wrangles pitting Guyo against Speaker Beatrice Elachi.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Led by Mowlem MCA Benson Mwangi, the MCAs are questioning how the party arrived at the names that were presented to Speaker Elachi, since they didn’t participate in the selection process.</p>
      <p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
      <p>The MCAs accused the party of imposing leaders on them.</p>
      <p>“It is a pity that Jubilee party can turn from being a democratic party to that of dictatorship, we will not allow that,” the Mowlem MCA said on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The Guyo axis claimed the new leadership doesn’t have the support of most members, adding that it’s only through an election that peace will prevail.</p>
      <p>“What we want now is an election where we will come up with leaders that we desire and life continues,” Mwangi said.</p>
      <p>Through a communication from Jubilee Secretary General Raphael Tuju to the Nairobi Assembly Speaker Beatrice Elachi on Tuesday, Tuju said the changes were necessary for clarity.</p>
      <p>“In order to bring clarity on the issue of leadership in the House; we have decided to respect the list as brought to you by Hon June Ndegwa,” reads the letter.According to the changes, Dandora 3 MCA Charles Thuo will be the Majority Leader and will be deputized by Ziwani Kariokor MCA Millicent Mugadi.</p>
      <p>Majority Whip will now be nominated MCA June Ndegwa who will be deputized by Hassan Abdikadir.</p>
      <p>South B MCA Waithera Chege, Riruta’s James Kiriba and Ngara’s Chege Mwaura lost their seats.</p>
      <p>Mwangi said due process was not followed when the changes were made as required by the Assembly’s Standing Orders as well as Jubilee Party’s constitution.</p>
      <p>The Assembly Standing Orders proves for a two-thirds threshold for the removal of a Majority Leader.</p>
      <p>The respective party’s whip is expected to convene a meeting during which a motion to remove an Assembly leader is tabled after which signatures backing the bid are presented alongside with minutes of the meeting to the Assembly Speaker who then communicates the changes to the Party.</p>
      <p>“If law is not followed, and Article 9 of our party’s constitution is not followed, then be assured that these fracases will never end,” Mwangi said.</p>
