      <p>Consumers have come to expect specific services and features from their banks. New research conducted by PYMNTS, however, reveals that banks and other financial institutions (FIs) appear to be lagging in terms of meeting these expectations. Specifically, banks are failing to enab</p>

      <p>le the authentication controls that consumers want in their mobile banking apps.</p>
      <p>PYMNTS’ research indicates that nine out of 10 U.S. consumers want to be able to set their own authentication requirements when they access their bank accounts using digital channels. Only five out of 10 consumers have access to banking apps that provide this option, though. In other words, consumers want greater control over their financial apps’ authentication requirements, and they aren’t getting it.</p>
      <p>To examine how FIs can bridge this gap, PYMNTS surveyed 2,835 U.S. consumers on their mobile banking app usage patterns. The findings presented in the <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/study/consumer-centric-authentication-november-2019/">Consumer-Centric Authentication Playbook: In Search Of</a></p>

      <p><a href="https://www.pymnts.com/study/consumer-centric-authentication-november-2019/">Authentication Controls</a> edition, a collaboration with <a href="https://www.entersekt.com/">Entersekt</a>, offer actionable insights on providing the right mix of authentication controls that are key to attracting new banking customers, retaining existing ones and boosting satisfaction overall.</p>
      <p>The Playbook highlights an interesting finding for FIs to consider: Providing greater authentication controls will not necessarily placate the consumers who want them. In fact, 80.8 percent of frequent users with full authentication controls, and 79.9 percent of those without full control, want to add authentication checks for more transactions, such as mobile check deposits. The Playbook also includes a Deep Dive that explores how attitudes on mobile app authentication controls vary by different generational groups.</p>
      <p>Among the key findings presented in the Playbook:</p>
