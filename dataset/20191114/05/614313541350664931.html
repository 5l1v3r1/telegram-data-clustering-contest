      <h1>Disney Plus Has Rare Deleted Scenes From Star Wars and Marvel</h1>
      <h2>Disney+ Features a Bunch of Rare Deleted Scenes</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T05:00:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 05:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.askmen.com/authors/matt_shea" target="_blank">Matt Shea</a></address>
      <p>The recent launch of Disney Plus came with good news (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/13/20963172/disney-plus-subscribers-10-million-star-wars-marvel-pixar-launch">10 million subscribers in one day</a>. Yes!), and some bad news (“The Mandalorian” is just… <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/nov/12/the-mandalorian-review-star-wars-jon-favreau">OK</a>). But 48 hours in and we’re starting to get a deeper understanding of the kinds of more specialized content the streaming service is offering.</p>

      <p>Take the Star Wars and Marvel film franchises, for example — both already have a clutch of cool little curios for you to explore.</p>

      <h3>NEW NEW HOPE</h3>
      <hr/>
      <p>Some of the most fascinating content is a collection of deleted scenes and rough cuts from the original Star Wars trilogy. </p>
      <p>In “A New Hope” there’s Luke at Tosche Station, where you might remember he wanted to go to pick up some power converters; and a meeting with Biggs Darklighter, an X-wing ace who takes part in the iconic Death Star raid — here, he’s preparing to defect from the Empire.</p>
      <p>There’s also a rough cut of the Cantina scene that features the infamous “Han shot first” moment.</p>
      <p>“The Empire Strikes Back” features a romantic scene between Leia and Luke (before we knew they were brother and sister), and “Return of the Jedi” has Death Star Commander Jerjerrod questioning Emperor Palpatine’s order to destroy the Endor moon (while there are still Imperial troops on the ground) and Luke building his new lightsaber.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>ENDGAME’S MANY ENDGAMES</h3>
      <hr/>
      <p>But Star Wars isn’t the only franchise to get some extra content. Remember the <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/noradominick/avengers-endgame-extra-footage-post-credits-scene">theatrical re-release</a> of “Avengers: Endgame” that included a bunch of extra scenes? Well it turns out Marvel isn’t done just yet.</p>
      <p>The Disney Plus release of “Endgame” features an emotional scene between Robert Downey Jr.’s Tony Stark and an adult version of his daughter, Morgan (played by Katherine Langford from “13 Reasons Why”), in which Tony questions his decision to put on the Infinity Gauntlet.</p>
      <p>In the context of the film, the scene would have taken place just after he snaps his fingers while wearing the Gauntlet, with Stark transported to what’s known as the Way Station, a realm where he must “confront or reconcile something that's unresolved in yourself, in your soul,” Anthony Russo says in the accompanying director’s commentary.</p>
      <p>“I’m scared I made a mistake,” Stark tells Morgan, who has previously only been seen has a child.</p>
      <p>“I know,” she responds. “And I know it's going to be tough for you to let go, but if someone had to do that so the rest of us could [live]... I'm proud of you. I’m strong, like mom. And I'm happy. I'm happy that we had the time that we did and that you were there for me — until you couldn't be.”</p>
      <p>It’s pretty intense stuff, and you might wonder why it was left out of the final cut. But as the Russo brothers explain, it both had the potential to hurt the film’s momentum and confuse viewers (who were only familiar with a young Morgan).</p>
      <p>Also, it felt like “Endgame” was starting to have too many endings, particularly when Tony delivers his own eulogy in a following scene. “When you have too many sequences in a row, you can dilute the value of each one of them,” Joe Russo says.</p>
      <p>If you’re interested in checking out these scenes for yourself, <a href="https://zdcs.link/dnnXj">Disney+</a> has a 7-day free trial offer.</p>
