      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 14 — The Health Ministry inspected 146,607 restaurant premises from January up till November 3 this year to ensure that the smoking ban is observed.</p>
      <p>Health Minister Datuk Seri Dzulkefly Ahmad told the Dewan Rakyat during the Minister’s Question Time that 31,422 warning notices have also been issued.</p>
      <p>“Out of that figure, 27,759 premises were given a warning because they failed to put up no-smoking signs and a further 3,889 notices were issued to individuals who were smoking at restaurant premises,” said Dzulkefly in his reply to Ledang PH MP Syed Ibrahim Syed Noh.</p>
      <p>He said his ministry received 23,805 complaints in the period, adding that full enforcement of the smoking ban will begin on January 1.</p>
      <p>He also said that the minimum three-metre buffer from eateries was not an arbitrary decision but set after a study on the smallest safe distance to protect the public from the harms of passive smoking.</p>
      <p>Replying to Syed Ibrahim’s supplementary question, Dzulkefly said that in 2018, the Health Ministry’s mQuit programme had a 32 per cent success rate and that 20,032 smokers had registered with the programme.</p>
