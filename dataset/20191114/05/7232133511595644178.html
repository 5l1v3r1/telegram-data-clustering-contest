        <i>Bitcoin (BTC) and the crypto market cap are still in a bearish zone.

      </p>
      <h3>Bitcoin Cash Price Analysis</h3>
      <p>In the past few sessions, BCH price corrected lower after it failed to surpass the $300 resistance against the US Dollar. BCH is now trading near the key $285 and $280 support levels. If the bulls fail to protect the $280 support, there is a risk of an extended decline towards the $265 support.</p>
      <p>On the upside, an initial resistance is near the $295 level. However, the main hurdles for the bulls are near the $30 and $305 levels.</p>
      <h3>Binance Coin (BNB), Litecoin (LTC) and Tron (TRX) Price Analysis</h3>
      <p>Binance coin (BNB) remained well bid above the $19.50 and $20.00 levels. Recently, BNB price climbed higher and broke the $21.00 resistance area. It is up more than 3% and it is testing the $21.20 resistance. Any further gains may perhaps push the price towards the $21.50 resistance.</p>
      <p>Litecoin price is under pressure and it recently failed to hold the $62.00 support area. LTC is currently declining and it is approaching the $60.50 support area. The main support is near the $60.00 level, below which the price could decline heavily in the coming sessions.</p>
      <p>Tron price remained well supported near the $0.0190 level and recently started a fresh upward move. TRX price is up close to 4% and it is now trading above the $0.0200 resistance. The next key resistance is near the $0.0205 and $0.0208 levels.</p>
      <h3>Crypto Market Cap</h3>
      <p>Looking at the total cryptocurrency market cap 4-hours <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/CRYPTOCAP-TOTAL/">chart</a>, there are many hurdles forming near the $235.0B and $240.0B levels. Moreover, it seems like there is a short term head and shoulders pattern forming with support near the $225.0B level. On the upside, a break above $235.0B and $240.0B is needed for a decent recovery in the crypto market.</p>

      <p>If there is a downside break below the $225.0B support, there could be a sharp decline in bitcoin, Ethereum, EOS, litecoin, ripple, binance coin, BCH, TRX, XMR, XLM and other altcoins in the near term.</p>
