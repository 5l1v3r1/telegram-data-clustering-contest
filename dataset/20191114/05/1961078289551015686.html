      <h1>Hong Kong’s University Students Dig in for Battles With Police</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T05:29:51+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 05:29</time> by <a rel="author">Mike Ives and Katherine Li</a></address>
      <p>HONG KONG — Protesters armed on Thursday with firebombs and bows and arrows reinforced the fortifications they had built on Hong Kong university campuses in anticipation of clashes with the police, as demonstrations disrupted Hong Kong’s morning commute for a fourth straight weekday.</p>
      <p>At the Chinese University of Hong Kong, the site of battle scenes earlier in the week that evoked <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/12/world/asia/photos-hong-kong-protests.html?module=inline">citadels under siege</a>, young protesters built brick walls outside the campus’s entrances. On the fringes of other school campuses, students built elaborate roadblocks that some in the movement call “Stonehenges.”</p>
      <p>The protests started in June over an extradition bill that has since been withdrawn, and have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/13/world/asia/hong-kong-protests.html?module=inline">morphed into broader demands for democracy and police accountability</a>. In recent days, the locus of tension between protesters and the police has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/13/world/asia/hong-kong-protests-students.html?module=inline">moved from the streets to university campuses</a>, which were once sanctuaries for the students at the core of the movement.</p>
      <p>Here’s the latest on the Hong Kong protests.</p>
      <h3>Fears of a police crackdown on campuses.</h3>
      <p>The police kicked off the workday on Thursday by spraying tear gas at an entrance of Hong Kong Polytechnic University. Around the same time, the university sent an email to the staff urging them to leave the campus “in view of the escalating danger and a high risk of bodily injury.”</p>
      <p>Tensions were also running high on other campuses. At least two other universities — CUHK and Hong Kong Baptist University — have already canceled<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/13/world/asia/hong-kong-protests-campuses.html?module=inline"> on-campus lectures for the remainder of the fall semester</a>.</p>
      <p>At CUHK on Thursday, protesters were seen building brick walls around the campus entrances. “All day all night,” read a slogan someone spray-painted on one of the walls, “We are gonna fight.”</p>
      <p>Across town at the University of Hong Kong, protesters used bricks and bamboo poles to erect elaborate roadblocks.</p>
      <p>In a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hkuofficial/posts/2443594762584661?__xts__[0]=68.ARCJlDJXq_gfEuI9xBE4AKxrmYKFu_ogyu2MasbJNkYm6Doa4L3E1T34s9I2hYTTwrZcl15AwTjEDFXbRrm0A6_X-ECC8g9IhCxOwc3NP9hYPNjTWZhlesCmX7pY274fb6LCogtztVWSBMUkHV70y7WZWLCCUYEtjMetDAkq0CQ85GbvHdopLD-HW5zI3XHbyK_zOLnYqVLfYQ_Y6n91dt_ftDoVx2NYxsU4coaCq3TRzXeZCoY7LT_cm3leLbO1nPaOMxCieWsFn7R-o7LVvq47mdS3nBMuH6r-TS2zBAan3tAkWAFBoCuev1tJh5yAHqM1HYhN2AJ6TQXlujcHB8m6&amp;__tn__=-R">Facebook post</a> on Wednesday night, the university’s president urged members of the campus not to “create any situation which will lead to police entering the campus to search, to investigate or to make arrests.”</p>
      <p>“I urge you NOT to resort to violence as it will not solve any problems,” wrote the president, Xiang Zhang.</p>
      <h3>Transit disruptions across town.</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The disruptions this week are notable because they have strained the city’s infrastructure for four straight workdays, forcing commuters to choose whether to venture outside and risk being caught up in clashes and tear gas.</li>
        <li>On Thursday morning, there were delays or closures on seven of Hong Kong’s 11 subway lines, although the scale of the disruptions appeared to be smaller than on other days this week.</li>
        <li>A section of Tolo Highway, a major thruway in northern Hong Kong, was blocked by debris that protesters had thrown down from a bridge.</li>
        <li>Protesters blocked a key tunnel linking Hong Kong Island with the Kowloon Peninsula with makeshift barricades, a day after throwing gasoline bombs at some of its toll plazas.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>The Education Bureau has canceled all classes — kindergarten through secondary school — from Thursday through the weekend.</li>
        <li>Parts of the city were eerily quiet during the Thursday morning commute. A reporter found Chater Garden, a downtown park that normally hums with pedestrians, deserted excerpt for an old man doing Tai Chi, and a young man on a bench who was checking his cellphone.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>A week of chaos and violence.</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Protesters have been rallying for months over a range of demands, but they are particularly angry this week over the<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/11/world/hong-kong-protests.html"> police shooting on Monday of a young demonstrator at point-blank range on a street corner</a>. He was in serious condition as of Wednesday.</li>
        <li>Before the shooting, tensions had been building over <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/07/world/asia/hong-kong-protest-student-dies.html">the death last week of a student who fell from a parking garage</a> amid demonstrations. The circumstances leading to his death remain unclear, but many in the protest movement now see him as a martyr.</li>
        <li>On Tuesday, the Chinese central government’s Liaison Office in Hong Kong condemned the flare-up of violence, warning in a statement that months of protests had pushed the city into an “extremely dangerous place.”</li>
        <li>The Hong Kong police said on Wednesday that some police officers from the city’s marine unit had been deployed to help evacuate mainland Chinese students who attend CUHK.</li>
        <li>China’s Communist Youth League, the youth division of the ruling Communist Party, has offered mainland students fleeing Hong Kong seven days of free accommodation.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>The injury toll mounts.</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The Hospital Authority said that 64 people received medical treatment related to clashes across Hong Kong on Wednesday.</li>
        <li>Some were gravely injured, although it was unclear how many of the injuries were specifically linked to violence by protesters or the police.</li>
        <li>A man working for Hong Kong’s Food and Environmental Hygiene Department was believed to have been hit on the head on Wednesday by “hard objects hurled by masked rioters,” the government said in a statement hours later.</li>
        <li>The police said in a separate statement on Thursday that the man, 70, appeared to have been attacked with a brick, and that he was in critical condition.</li>
      </ul>
