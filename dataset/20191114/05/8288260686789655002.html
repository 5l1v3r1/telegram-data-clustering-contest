      <h1>The Birmingham neighbourhoods where kids are most affected by deprivation</h1>
      <h2>The government has published official rankings of childhood poverty across the country</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T05:30:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 05:30</time> by <a rel="author">James Rodger, Annie Gouk, https://www.facebook.com/jamesrodgerjournalist</a></address>
      <p>A neighbourhood in Birmingham has some of the highest levels of child poverty in England, new analysis has revealed.</p>
      <p>The government has published official rankings of childhood poverty across the country.</p>
      <p>The figures rank individual neighbourhoods - small areas with a population of around 1,500 people each - based on how many children aged 0 to 15 are living in income deprived families.</p>
      <p>They include children in families on income support, jobseeker’s allowance, employment and support allowance, pension credit, certain types of universal credit, and some other benefits.</p>
      <p>A neighbourhood in the Rubery area of Birmingham emerges as the 13th most deprived out of any of the 32,844 neighbourhoods in England.</p>

      <p>An estimated 305 of the 473 children in the area are living in poverty.</p>
      <p>The figures also show that Birmingham as a whole has significant levels of childhood poverty.</p>
      <p>Neighbourhoods that fall into the top 10% of the country for child poverty can be defined as being particularly affected.</p>
      <p>Some 31% of neighbourhoods in the city fall into this category.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The area with the next-highest levels of child poverty in Birmingham is a neighbourhood in Druids Heath, ranking in 23rd place nationally, affecting an estimated 225 children.</p>
      <p>It’s followed by a neighbourhood in Short Heath in 31st place (280 children), and a neighbourhood near the Jewellery Quarter in 33rd place (55 children).</p>

      <p>In total, there are estimated to be more than 36,600 children in Birmingham aged 0-15 who are in the top 10% of the country when it comes to income deprivation.</p>
      <p>The figures come from the Index of Multiple Deprivation - the official measure of relative deprivation in England.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>It is a broad definition of deprivation involving 29 separate indicators across seven categories.</p>
      <p>As well as income deprivation - also known as poverty - it looks at employment, education, health, crime, barriers to housing and services, and living conditions.</p>
      <p>Just because an area sees high levels of childhood poverty doesn’t mean it is necessarily deprived in other ways.</p>
      <p>For example, the neighbourhood in Rubery that ranks at number 13 for child poverty comes in at 206th place for overall deprivation.</p>
