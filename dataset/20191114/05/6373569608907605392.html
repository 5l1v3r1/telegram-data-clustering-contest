      <p>Scores of children were entered into Baby of the Year 2019 and more people than ever before cast their votes to help crown the winner.</p>
      <p>Over two million votes were submitted, with 300,000 going to the top three alone.</p>
      <p>But it was Bear Burgess, who celebrates his third birthday on November 28, that came top of the pile this year.</p>
      <p>Parents Joanne and Adam Burgess were both thrilled that their eldest son won <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/all-about/baby-of-the-year">the competition</a>, which saw them receive plenty of support from the locals of Brixton, where they live.</p>
      <p>Speaking to the Herald, Joanne said: “My husband and I are thrilled. Bear is such a lovely boy and it is nice to have some acknowledgement for him.</p>
      <p>“When we entered, we didn’t expect to get anywhere but I have been walking around Brixton and people have approached me telling me that they were buying papers and voting for him.</p>
      <p>“That was really nice, it was the icing on the cake that we had support from him.</p>
      <p>“People were saying ‘oh your little toddler, we have been voting for him’, which is cute.”</p>

      <p>Bear wasn’t the only member of the Burgess family to enter, his younger brother Beauden was also in the Baby of the Year competition.</p>
      <p>Voting was paused to find the top 80 babies and the five-month-old did make it into that list alongside his brother.</p>
      <p>It was then reopened and it was Bear who received the most votes, followed by Neo Asmael and Spencer Warren who came second and third respectively.</p>
      <p>The top prize was £300 in cash, with £150 going to second place and £50 going to third.</p>
      <p>Joanne stated that she would recommended entering the competition to other people, saying that it was nice just to see her children named in the paper.</p>
      <p>“It is worthwhile, it is nice as a family just to see your kid in it,” she said.</p>

      <p>“It was his first competition and it was just nice to get involved.</p>
      <p>“I have also been supporting my friend’s child, which was nice, to be able to do that and buy the Herald for her as well.</p>
      <p>“It was really nice to buy the Herald and see their names.</p>
      <p>“My mum and dad, nans and grandads, aunties, friends were all buying the paper.</p>
      <p>“I’d love to say thank you for all of his supporters, especially the people that have approached me and my family and friends that have taken the time to buy the Herald, get the vouchers out and give me the tokens.”</p>
