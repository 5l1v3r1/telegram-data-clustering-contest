        <figcaption>For the Times, Wednesday was a "chaotic" day of campaigning for Labour. The party's leadership appeared to be "split" over whether NHS staff would be included in its plans for a four-day working week and Mr Corbyn "stumbled" over his position on the union, says the paper.</figcaption>

        <figcaption>The Daily Mail reports the Labour leader was branded "naive to the point of being dangerous" for questioning the killing of the world's most wanted man. Mr Corbyn had said arresting Islamic State leader Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi would have been "the right thing to do" - but his comments were said to have provoked "ridicule" from military and security experts.</figcaption>

        <figcaption>The Conservatives offered an electoral pact to Nigel Farage aimed at getting the Brexit Party to target just 40 key seats, the Daily Telegraph reports. Boris Johnson offered to put up "paper candidates" in these Labour-held constituencies in return for the Brexit Party not standing in other seats the Tories hope to win, according to the paper. However, Mr Farage is said to have turned the deal down.</figcaption>

        <figcaption>The i leads on news that the estranged wife of a former Tory MP is standing for election in his seat. Kate Griffiths, who was selected as the Conservative candidate for Burton, has said she is divorcing her husband, Andrew, who sent thousands of sexual messages to two women.</figcaption>

        <figcaption>Elsewhere, Boris Johnson vowed to unleash Britain's "full potential" after Brexit during his first major election campaign speech, reports the Daily Express. The prime minister also warned the country would wake up to a "nightmare" on 13 December if Jeremy Corbyn was elected into power and "propped up" by Scotland's first minister, Nicola Sturgeon.</figcaption>

        <figcaption>Stepping away from the election, the Daily Mirror has released a special "climate issue". Its front page features a photo of baby Layton, warning that he is only hours old but the climate crisis threatens his future. "Give me a world I can grow up in", the paper's front-page headline declares.</figcaption>

        <figcaption>The Sun reports that child killer Ian Huntley was sent to solitary confinement twice within days after a "meltdown" at prison officers. A source told the paper: "He was sobbing and looks like a man with no fight left."</figcaption>

        <figcaption>Some of the UK's most popular health websites are sharing people's sensitive data with dozens of global companies, according to a Financial Times investigation. The paper says 79% of sites dropped "cookies" - code embedded in web browsers allowing third-party companies to track people around the internet.</figcaption>

        <b>Most of the papers continue to focus on developments in the election campaign.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Guardian says a call by the leader of the Unite union, Len McCluskey, to curb free movement, has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/13/mccluskey-tells-corbyn-defy-calls-extend-freedom-of-movement">infuriated Labour party activists</a> who've been campaigning for a pro-migration stance.</p>
      <p>Mr McCluskey - a key ally of Jeremy Corbyn - suggests the shadow cabinet should not upset Labour's carefully crafted Brexit position.</p>
      <p>The Guardian says Mr Corbyn has not been drawn into the argument, saying the issue would be discussed at the weekend.</p>
      <p>Boris Johnson is pictured in several papers visiting the flood-hit areas of South Yorkshire, where he faced criticism from local residents.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/breaking-boris-johnson-heckled-finally-20872191">Daily Mirror</a> and <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10342492/boris-johnson-heckled-floods/">the Sun</a> adopt the same headline to describe his uncomfortable visit: "Sandbagged".</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/11/13/uk-weatherflooded-farmer-says-could-12-months-can-plant-crops/">Daily Telegraph</a> uses a striking aerial image taken by a drone showing the extent of the flooding in Lincolnshire where a road disappears into a a muddy sea.</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/454c1ed0-060b-11ea-9afa-d9e2401fa7ca">Financial Times</a> pictures the Liberal Democrat leader, Jo Swinson, on its front page in yellow boxing gloves. It calls her "hard-hitting" as she once again ruled out a parliamentary pact with Labour.</p>
      <p>The Daily Telegraph says the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/11/13/tories-offer-nigel-farage-eleventh-hour-deal/">Conservatives offered Nigel Farage an electoral pact</a> but talks broke down.</p>
      <p>Under the deal, the paper says the Tories would have carried out minimal campaigning in 40 key Labour-held marginal constituencies to give an advantage to Brexit Party candidates.</p>
      <p>But Mr Farage wanted the Tories to withdraw completely from the seats.</p>
      <p>Several papers, including the Sun, report that <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/uncategorized/10342159/one-in-four-illegal-migrants-eu-illegal-migrants-in-britain/">one in four unauthorised migrants in the EU are thought to be living in the UK</a>.</p>
      <p>Research by the American think-tank, Pew Research Center, suggests there could be up to 1.2 million migrants - many of whom have overstayed their visas or are failed asylum seekers.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/britain-has-most-illegal-immigrants-in-the-eu-wvg9wlcmx">The Times</a> suggest that more than half are from the Asia Pacific region.</p>

      <p>The Financial Times warns on its front page that <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/0fbf4d8e-022b-11ea-be59-e49b2a136b8d">some of the UK's most popular health websites are sharing people's sensitive data</a> with dozens of global companies, which target adverts.</p>
      <p>The FT suggests symptoms put into WebMD's checker were shared with Facebook; ovulation cycle data from BabyCenter ended up with Amazon Marketplace, and that most data went to Google's advertising arm, Double-Click.</p>
      <p>The companies denied any wrongdoing.</p>
      <p>Google insisted no information was used for personalised adverts; Amazon that it wasn't used for advertising. Facebook said it would investigate, saying such a practice would violate its rules.</p>
      <p>And finally, the real life James Bond may enjoy a drink, but it will be in a bar in the headquarters of MI6 in central London, rather than a tropical beach hotel, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/11/13/mi6-spies-unwind-secret-bar-c-reveals/">according to the Daily Telegraph</a>.</p>
      <p>The head of the Secret Intelligence Service, Sir Alex Younger, explains that spies need to unwind but given that they're not allowed to talk even to their closest friends about their work, they need a place where they can.</p>
      <p>Sir Alex tells the paper that the bar is therefore "one of the most exclusive in London".</p>
      <p>But he doesn't reveal whether the bar adheres to Bond's recipe for the perfect martini.</p>
