      <h1>Liverpool told Ryan Fraser is 'exactly the player they need' in January transfer window</h1>
      <h2>Fraser was Arsenal target over the summer but move to Liverpool 'makes perfect sense' to former Chelsea man</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T05:00:27+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 05:00</time> by <a rel="author">Gareth Bicknell</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool have been told that transfer target Ryan Fraser is 'exactly the player they need' as they look to stay ahead of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> in the Premier League title race.</p>
      <p>Jurgen Klopp has been linked with a January swoop for Fraser as he looks to add strength in depth to his fearsome forward line of Roberto Firmino, Mo Salah and Sadio Mane.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> are eight points ahead of second-placed <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> City in the title race, and nine points better off than reigning Premier League champions City.</p>
      <p>But the Reds are involved in the Club World Cup next month amid a busy December fixture list, and will be looking to steer clear of injuries going into the business end of the season.</p>
      <p>Fraser was the Premier League's second highest assist provider last season with 14 - one behind Eden Hazard who left <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> at the end of the campaign.</p>

      <p>And former Chelsea player Jason Cundy reckons Fraser - who was also on Arsenal's radar over the summer - would be the perfect player to strengthen Liverpool's squad.</p>
      <p>“I think you can see exactly the sort of player that Liverpool need if one of those players out wide [got injured], whether it be Mane or whether it be Salah," Cundy told the <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/1203527/Liverpool-news-Ryan-Fraser-transfer-Tottenham-Bournemouth">Daily Express</a> .</p>
      <p>“He’s got the raw minerals actually to step in. He’s quick with the ball, travels with it, he’s got a brilliant delivery.</p>
      <p>“I can see it, it’s a no-brainer as far as I can see.</p>

      <p>“Certainly the price tag wouldn’t be expensive, he can sign for four or five years and they’d still have a residue value on him, so it makes perfect sense for me.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://talksport.com/football/628484/liverpool-talks-january-ryan-fraser-transfer-bournemouth-harry-wilson/">TalkSport</a> have claimed Livepool are in advanced talks with Bournemouth over signing Fraser.</p>
      <p>With his contract due to expire in the summer, Liverpool may be able to land Wilson for a cut price £10m.</p>
      <p>It is anticipated the Cherries could ask Liverpool to sweeten the deal by offering Wales winger Wilson as part of the exchange.</p>
