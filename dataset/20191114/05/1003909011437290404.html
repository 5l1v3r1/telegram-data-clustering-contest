      <h1>Braid: Worries building again over punishing business tax</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T05:00:51+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 05:00</time> by <a rel="author">Don Braid, Calgary Herald</a></address>
      <p>Calgary’s small business owners, like medieval serfs, once again hope the tax collector leaves them enough beans to survive the winter.</p>
      <p>Angst is building fast about another round of devastating tax bills for the city’s most powerless ratepayers. City hall, typically, has dodged the issue until Nov. 18.</p>
      <p>It is remarkable, but emblematic of city waffling, that council is now considering overall <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/2020-budget-city-tax-scenarios-include-cuts-to-police-and-fire-loss-of-236-workers">budget</a> documents that don’t even deal with the business tax problem.</p>
      <p>The long-term solution is to raise the proportion of tax, now less than 50 per cent, paid by home and condo owners.</p>
      <p>This is the only fair way to fill the mammoth assessment gap created by the hollowing out of the downtown towers.</p>
      <p>The average tax hike spread over such a large group — 520,825 residential tax accounts — would be quite minor.</p>
      <p>Right now the whole problem is pushed to 13,985 business accounts. This is downright cruel.</p>
      <p>But those numbers also explain council’s inaction. On election day, business owners with one vote each are virtually meaningless.</p>
      <p>How would a homeowner feel if the annual tax bill, humming along for years at, say, $5,000, was suddenly hiked to $20,000?</p>
      <p>And would that homeowner enjoy hearing that the property is suddenly much more valuable, even though they know it’s worth less, and that’s why the taxes went up?</p>
      <p>All those techniques and more have been used to put the screws on small business people. They’re paying for the trials of, say, <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/business/calgary-based-encana-plans-to-move-base-to-u-s-amid-pipeline-crunch">Encana</a>, which is <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/commodities/energy/encana-picks-denver-for-new-headquarters-in-relocation-to-u-s/wcm/6a1e8efc-2bd6-42b9-b7e7-8409ac728cba">moving its headquarters to Denver</a>.</p>
      <p>So, once again, we hear from Kelly Doody, owner of the Social School in Inglewood, who this spring became one leader of a tax revolt against city hall.</p>

      <p>The assessed value of her business jumped from $811,000 in 2018 to $2.12 million.</p>
      <p>That led to a mammoth monthly tax increase, pushing her yearly total close to $70,000.</p>
      <p>Doody appealed and won. The assessed value was lowered to $1.4 million (still a mammoth jump from $811,000).</p>
      <p>Her tax bill went down, but only by $15,000. The company fighting the case for her got $7,000 of that.</p>
      <p>“So we end up just spending money AND still owing the city more,” she says.</p>
      <p>“And we get to do it all over again in a few months. It’s just ludicrous.”</p>
      <p>Colleague Chris Varcoe recently <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/business/commercial-real-estate/varcoe-with-distractions-elsewhere-new-report-reminds-us-business-tax-crisis-is-still-festering">cited Owl’s Nest Books, in Britannia Plaza Shopping Centre.</a> The store is trying to shrink its taxes by shrinking the business.</p>
      <p>This one’s personal for me. Owners Mike and Susan Hare are friends. Our daughter worked at Owl’s Nest as a teenager, often bringing home more books than wages.</p>
      <p>The growing popularity of ebooks and the big chains have made life tough for small independent booksellers. But Mike and Susan, full of ideas and always presenting a beautiful-looking store, fought through it all.</p>
      <p>They just never counted on their city tax going from $7,000 to $32,000 in four years.</p>
      <p>They’ve decided to close their popular children’s section. In January, a wall will go up, splitting their business space in two.</p>
      <p>They signed a new lease with their landlord for less than half the previous square footage.</p>
      <p>Susan says they hope their tax will consequently be cut in half. “If it doesn’t shrink, we’d have to close.”</p>

      <p>This isn’t a business problem, it’s a tax problem inflicted by the city.</p>
      <p>To help them fight through, Susan and Mike have come up with a typically original idea.</p>
      <p>They’re asking customers to buy <a href="http://www.owlsnestbooks.com/friends-of-the-nest">a $100 annual sponsorship,</a> which comes with benefits like advance reading copies, free gift-wrapping, reserved seating at store events and more.</p>
      <p>The money would go toward operating costs; that’s how tight the situation is.</p>
      <p>Every council member should buy a sponsorship. It might even be good for the conscience.</p>
