      <h2>Boris Johnson suggested only fielding "paper candidates" in Labour-held constituencies to give the Brexit Party a better chance - but the offer was rejected by Nigel Farage who wanted the Tories to stand down entirely</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T05:04:04+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 05:04</time> by <a rel="author">Joshua Taylor, Catherine Wylie, https://www.facebook.com/dailymirror/</a></address>
      <p>Nigel Farage has turned down an 11th-hour electoral pact offer from the Conservatives, according to reports.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> suggested the Tories could put up "paper candidates" in Labour-held seats and do minimal campaigning.</p>
      <p>This would give the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brexit">Brexit</a> Party a stronger chance of winning in Leave-supporting areas.</p>
      <p>But the deal was reportedly rejected by Mr Farage - who wanted the Tories to step aside entirely in the constituencies.</p>
      <p>He also feared it would leave the Brexit Party with just 40 target seats.</p>
      <p>The talks broke down on Tuesday and the deadline to nominate candidates arrives at 4pm today.</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson's final offer came after after the Brexit Party withdrew its own candidates from all 317 seats currently held by Conservatives, the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/11/13/tories-offer-nigel-farage-eleventh-hour-deal/">Telegraph</a> reports.</p>
      <p>Mr Farage described this as the first step towards building a "leave alliance".</p>

      <p>But the Brexit Party leader remains under pressure to withdraw even more candidates.</p>
      <p>The Prime Minister has insisted voting Conservative is the "only way" to get Brexit done.</p>
      <p>Mr Farage has said he will field candidates in every Labour-held seat - in a move that could hamper Tory efforts to win a majority.</p>

      <p>Â </p>
      <p>A Brexit Party source said: "At every election the Tories have upwards of 100 paper candidates.</p>
      <p>"If this offer was made it was an offer of the status quo, in in other words, no offer at all.</p>
      <p>"It looks like an attempt to portray the Brexit Party and Nigel Farage as unreasonable, despite the huge concessions that we have made, both on a policy and on the unilateral decision not to stand in the 317 Tory held seats.</p>
      <p>"If the Tories are serious then this isn't the way to show it."</p>
