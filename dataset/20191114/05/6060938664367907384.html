        <b>Question: I work in a global organisation in mid-level management and have two bosses — one based locally and the other in a different time zone. Both give me conflicting directions. Moreover, they don’t give their orders in writing and hold me responsible if anything goes wrong. Both blame each other if I try to bring up my tricky situation. This has resulted in trust issues and has also hampered my relations with other key stakeholders in the organisation. I am unable to function effectively. Different time zones and location have compounded my troubles. How should I handle the situation?</b>

        <b>Prabir Jha replies:</b>
      </p>
      <p>Matrix structures are often a mixed blessing. While multiple stakeholders and managers help build inclusion and collective ownership, it also creates its traps. You clearly are struggling with the trap. Some of your issues could be structural, but most of it looks like being caught in the crossfire of two conflicting personalities. You are in an unfortunate, but not a unique predicament. Many matrix structures run this risk if different managers don’t speak and clarify with each other. Many a time they indeed do not. And the situation can get very stressful and unproductive for someone in your situation.</p>
      <p>Let me suggest some steps to get out of this impasse.</p>
      <p>“ <b>Self-reflect:</b> Could you be over-reacting to a situation? Could you be not pushing back or clarifying enough? Do you struggle to say no and over-promise? Are you struggling with bandwidth issues? Have you asked for feedback from stakeholders? Is there something that you should be working on? Are you managing your time, priorities and stress as well as you should be? Is there something beyond work that is causing you stress and distraction, which is apparently being attributed to difficult bosses? If you have fairly and squarely critiqued yourself and do not think a problem lies within you, you need to then do the obvious thing.</p>
      <p>“ <b>Do the obvious:</b> Ask to get both people on a common call or video-conference. Raise your discomfort. Highlight specific examples. Share why it is impacting your work, your decision-making and your relationships &amp; reputation with other stakeholders. Both sides need to listen to you together, not hear you separately. Allow them to clarify to you and to each other. Possibly, you are missing some perspective that is creating a disturbance. It allows them both the moment to coach and clarify. Maybe you also need to ask for weekly or fortnightly common virtual meetings till the issues are resolved and there is a common rhythm. Sometimes, these common conversations do help managers realise they need to discuss issues in real-time to avoid the noise that they are creating for team members like you.</p>
      <p>But it is also possible that both stick to their position and your situation does not change. Maybe their animosity makes it worse for you. Then what?</p>
      <p>“ <b>Raise the impasse with the skip level:</b> Reach out to your supervisor’s boss in your territory, copying the skip-level boss in the other geography. Possibly, they will have a wider perspective and be able to talk with maturity. They may be able to help agree on guidelines of information and decision flow. A sharper clarity on SOPs may indeed help improve communication for all, including you. Please remember that cultural differences are real. And higher-level managers will help coach their respective reports to enhance their own mutual understanding. In the worst case, they may agree to even move the respective manager(s) to help improve the effectiveness in the larger team. But if this too does not work?</p>
      <p>“ <b>Reach out to HR:</b> A good HR ecosystem should ideally pick these issues up if it is impacting people. Otherwise, raise your challenge with HR. The HR team normally cuts across functions and time zones. They may be able to surface this issue with any line managers or the CEO, if needed. It is HR’s job to ensure multiple perspectives are heard and a decision, soft or hard, secured and delivered. This is their accountability for organisational effectiveness.</p>
      <p>But what if this too does not work?</p>
      <p>“ <b>Move out of the team or workplace:</b> In spite of attempting at various levels, if no one can or is able to change things, the organisation has a major cultural change. Many companies indeed deny the issue or stay an ostrich. Your health and your happiness are yours to ensure. You cannot allow that to be sacrificed because of the indifference of managers or a company. Cut your losses and move away from the toxicity, even if there is a temporary setback. Either move to another role within the organisation or leave the company altogether. Start afresh. Nothing is the end of the world. Remember: Continuing to suffer in silence only will make you get bullied more. And you will lose your sense of self-worth and self-esteem. Nothing is worth this.</p>
      <p>The problem that you have then is either your own creation, or that of your managers, or of an indifferent organisation. Iterate on your possibilities. And you will reach a logical conclusion. But don’t necessarily assume that the reason is beyond you. These are not just work experiences but life learnings which eventually can build us as stronger people for difficult situations.</p>
