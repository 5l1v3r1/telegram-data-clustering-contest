      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T05:36:52+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 05:36</time> by <a rel="author">James Brinsford, https://www.facebook.com/james.brinsford</a></address>
      <p>Pink has confirmed that she will be leaving music and performing behind, for a year at least.</p>
      <p>The 40-year-old singer has spent the past two years on the road with her successful Beautiful Trauma World Tour and she is now looking in a different direction for her future.</p>
      <p>Pink arrived at the Country Music Association Awards for 2019 with her kids in tow as she and husband Carey Hart made the event a family affair.</p>
      <p>Speaking about her future on the red carpet, Pink confirmed: "It’s time to do something else for a minute."</p>
      <p>Ahead of the ceremony Pink posed for pics with Carey and their two kids, daughter Willow, 8, and son Jameson, 3.</p>

      <p>While Pink was stunning in a burnt-orange dress and black hat, it was Jameson that stole the show.</p>
      <p>The toddler wore a cowboy hat, studded jacket and cowboy boots and looked every inch the country music legend.</p>
      <p>Willow was equally as adorable with a white dress that had detailing of two horses.</p>
      <p>As well as giving music a rest for now, Pink hailed her husband Carey as they approached their 14-year-anniversary.</p>
      <p>Pink said: "He deserves a trophy! It’s been a while. We used to make a big deal out of it. Now, we’re just lucky to be together.”</p>
      <p>When asked what the secret was for their longevity, Pink joked: "We fight nicer."</p>

      <p>Pink opened up recently to Billboard about turning 40 and how her husband and kids threw her a surprise party.</p>
      <p>She said: "Forty was the first birthday I’ve had where I’ve been like, ‘F*** yeah, this is awesome! Yes! I know exactly who I am!’ And now I can just chill out a little bit.</p>
      <p>“And then 60 is going to be like, ‘F*** that, turn it back up.’ I’m going to be on roller skates, with rollers in my hair, house plants everywhere."</p>
