      <h1>Scientists design built-in controls for mini-chemical labs on a chip</h1>

      <p>ST. LOUIS - Since the 1990s, scientists have been exploring the possibilities of miniaturized chemical "laboratories" on a chip, which have potential as point-of-care diagnostics, analysis kits for field research and someday even conducting chemical tests on other planets.</p>
      <p>In a normal lab, chemists use beakers to mix chemicals and study reactions. In a miniaturized laboratory, microfluidic systems can conduct chemical experiments on a chip through a series of small connected tubes the size of a hair.</p>
      <p>This technology currently is in use, most notably in the medical field, which creates organs-on-a chip for research. However, the technology's potential has not fully been reached because the chemical reactions are controlled by large equipment that is often external to the chip.</p>
      <p>In a recent study published in Nature, researchers from Saint Louis University along with colleagues from Northwestern University and Normandie Universite shared their discovery of a way to program built-in controls in a microfluidic network.</p>
      <p>"We took our inspiration from electronics, in which a chip's controls are self-contained," said Istvan Kiss, Ph.D., professor of chemistry at Saint Louis University. "When we started the research in this field, we said 'Why don't we build tiny little reactors, sub-millimeter-sized. We used only a small number of reactors, so directing the flow was easy with simple, tiny tubes. But now, to advance the technology, we need the chip to be a bit more complicated, with many reactors and tubes in between, to operate more like a circuit."</p>
      <p>To solve this problem, researchers combined network theory and fluid mechanics and created controls operated entirely on the chip.</p>
      <p>Together with Yifan Liu, Ph.D., graduate research assistant at SLU and other colleagues, Kiss designed a network with a nonlinear relationship between the applied pressure and flow rate, which can be used to switch the direction of liquid flow simply by changing the input and output pressure.</p>
      <p>Taking a cue from a counterintuitive theory about traffic patterns, the scientists found that shortcuts aren't always the fastest way from point A to point B. A phenomenon known as Braess's paradox has demonstrated -- in traffic patterns, electronics, springs - that sometimes having more pathways to travel actually slows down traffic rather than speeds it up.</p>
      <p>"We've built a network that shows that paradox," Kiss said. "As we studied how water molecules go around obstacles, it created a 'valve.' Water molecules are diverted from their paths. At low flow rates, they go towards the obstacles, while at high flow rates, they go the opposite way."</p>
      <p>"When we close a shortcut channel, it results in a higher, rather than lower, total flow rate. We're interested in how such changes in flow rates and directions will eventually change the chemical reactions in the reactors."</p>
      <p>This technology could be used to create portable lab testing systems as well as to design new applications, such as health monitoring wearables or deployable space systems.</p>

      <p>Other researchers on the study include Daniel J. Case, Jean-Regis Angilella, and Adilson E. Motter.</p>
      <p>The research was funded by The National Science Foundation (PHY-1001198 and CHE-1900011), the Simons Foundation (342906) and a Northwestern University Presidential Fellowship.</p>
      <p>Kiss's research also has been supported by the Saint Louis University Research Institute.</p>
