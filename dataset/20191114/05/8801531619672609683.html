      <h1>Chowkidar Remark : SC Closes Contempt Case Against Rahul Gandhi With A Word Of Caution</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T05:48:07+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 05:48</time> by <a rel="author">LIVELAW NEWS NETWORK</a></address>
      <p>The Supreme Court on Thursday closed the contempt case against Congress MP Rahul Gandhi for attributing 'chowkidar chor hain' remarks to the Supreme Court.</p>
      <p>The bench of CJI Ranjan Gogoi, Justices S K Kaul and K M Joseph dropped further proceedings in the petition filed BJP leader Meenakshi Lekhi taking note of the apology expressed by Rahul Gandhi.</p>
      <p>The Court however added a word of caution observing that Gandhi should have been more careful.</p>
      <p>"The Court cannot be dragged into a political discourse", observed Justice Kaul, who wrote the judgment for the bench.</p>
      <p>The contempt case was heard along with the review petitions filed against the December 14, 2018 judgment which had refused to order probe into corruption allegations in Rafale deal.</p>
      <p>On April 10, the SC had overruled the preliminary objections raised by the Centre against accepting the media reports produced by the review petitioners and had decided to hear the review petition on merits.</p>
      <p>In this context, Rahul Gandhi made a remark during the election campaign that the Supreme Court had said 'chowkidar chor hain', alluding to Prime Minister Narendra Modi.</p>
      <p>Following this, BJP leader Meenakshi Lekhi filed the contempt case, alleging that Rahul Gandhi was twisting Supreme Court verdict for political campaigning.</p>
      <p>The then Congress chief later expressed apology to the court for attributing the comment, and said that the remark was made in the heat of political campaigning.</p>
