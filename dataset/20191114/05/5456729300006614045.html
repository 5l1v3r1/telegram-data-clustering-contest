      <p>Thirteen persons died on Wednesday in an auto crash at Sapade-Ogere axis of Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, the Federal Road Safety Corps has said.</p>
      <p>The tragedy happened where a diversion was created by RCC, the construction company rehabilitating the corridor.</p>
      <p>The FRSC Ogun State sector commander, Clement Oladele, said 37 persons comprising 20 men and 15 women, and two children were involved in the accident.</p>
      <p>He said four men, seven women and two children lost their lives.</p>
      <p>“The unfortunate incident involved three vehicles comprising a speeding truck heading towards the Lagos axis of the expressway. It suddenly suffered a burst tyre and in the process collided head on with two other speeding commuter buses heading towards the Ibadan axis, with one of them in the process attempting to wrongfully overtake within the diversion area,” Mr Oladele said.</p>
      <p>The official also gave the details of the vehicles as: “KTU93XW, a yellow coloured MAZDA bus, while the second vehicle is a white Toyota bus with registration number KEY847XA. The third vehicle has registration number KAB97XA and is a MAN Diesel Truck.”</p>
      <p>Mr Oladele requested relatives of the injured to contact the FRSC Command in Ogere Ogun State or Victory Hospital, Ogere.</p>
      <p>He said the bodies had been deposited at the Ipara mortuary.</p>
