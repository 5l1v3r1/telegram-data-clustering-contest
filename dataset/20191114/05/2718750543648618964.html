      <p>You gotta hand it to Reba McEntire. Juggling double duty as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfxhTfJNJg0">a single mom who works two jobs who loves her kids and never stops</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZbxuBM1HOE">the face of KFC</a> has gotta be exhausting, but you’d never know it after watching her perform at the CMAs. Reba stepped up to her role as special guest co-host of the 53rd CMAs with Dolly Parton and Carrie Underwood and performed her classic song, “Fancy,” about a girl named Fancy whose mama’s just trying to help her get uptown. Completely alone onstage, Reba sang her heart out, told us a story, and gave us three (three!) outfit reveals, all in the span of four minutes. <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/12/kennedy-center-honors-2018-hamilton-cher.html">While Reba’s no stranger to the limelight</a>, it was nice to see her performance had everyone <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=reba%20fancy&amp;src=typeahead_click">singing her praises</a>, including record-breaking seven-time Entertainer of the Year winner Garth Brooks, who name-checked McEntire and her performance during his acceptance speech at the end of the night. Brooks is right: We want more Reba, more covers of “Fancy,” and more sensible quick changes!</p>
