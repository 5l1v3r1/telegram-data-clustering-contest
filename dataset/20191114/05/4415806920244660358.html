      <p>In a statement, Keys said: “At first, I did think last year was a one-time thing, but when the opportunity came back around, there was no question about returning as host.</p>
      <p>“Last year was such a powerful experience for me. Not only did I feel the love in the room, but I felt it from around the world, and it confirmed the healing and unifying power of music.”</p>
      <p>Keys, who has won 15 competitive Grammys, will be the third woman to host the ceremony more than once.</p>
      <p>US talkshow host Ellen DeGeneres hosted in 1996 and 1997 while comedian Rose O’Donnell had the honour in 1999 and 2000.</p>
      <p>Keys released her debut album, Songs In A Minor, in 2001. She has since become one of the biggest-selling artists ever, with hit singles including Un-thinkable (I’m Ready), No One and Fallin’.</p>
      <p>Nominees for the 62nd annual Grammy Awards will be announced on November 20.</p>
      <p>The main ceremony will take place on January 26, 2020.</p>
