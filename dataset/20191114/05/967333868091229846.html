        <b>US trade talks with China reportedly have hit a snag over Beijing's reluctance to increase its purchases of US agricultural products, adding another obstacle to locking down the limited trade deal US President Donald Trump outlined last month.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Trump had originally said that China had agreed to buy between $40 billion and $50 billion in agricultural products from the United States over two years, but China is reticent to write a full amount into the deal, the Wall Street Journal reported, while noting that similar disagreements between the two countries have scuttled trade talks in the past.</p>
      <p>The Journal also reported that China was objecting to tighter provisions on technology transfer and an enforcement mechanism, citing people familiar with the matter.</p>
      <p>President Trump announced last month that the US and <a href="http://sputniknews.com/analysis/20191112/1077282912.html">China</a> had agreed on a “phase one” deal to scale back the trade war that’s been raging since last summer, scrapping a planned five percentage increase on $250 billion of goods. Another round of tariffs on $156 billion of Chinese products is still scheduled for December.</p>
