        <b>Former India keeper Nayan Mongia has reckoned that Rishabh Pant should use the team nets sessions to improve his glovework in the coming days. Mongia believes that Pant, who has been under fire recently, can use his wicket-keeping to boost his confidence while batting and vice-versa.</b>

      <p>Since breaking onto the international scene with much promise, it has been a bumpy ride for 22-year-old <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/pant">Pant</a>. And in the absence of the legendary <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/ms_dhoni">MS Dhoni</a>, his heir apparent has come under constant criticism for his repeated failures, especially since the World Cup. Mongia, a wicket-keeper himself during his playing days, sympathises with Pant and has a suggestion for him. </p>
      <p>“He (Pant) needs to keep more in the nets. That’s the most important thing for a keeper. Nowadays, you don’t get enough space for a keeper in the nets, but there should be five or six batsmen at the nets and he should stand behind the stumps as if he is playing a match,” Mongia told Sportstar.</p>
      <p>“But whatever limited time you get at the nets, you need to perfect your skills. If you take a good catch or effect a stumping at the nets session, that will boost the confidence. He needs to ensure that he doesn’t fumble at the nets,” he said.</p>
      <p>Mongia recalled how time spent alongside other batsmen would immensely help him gain confidence during his playing days.</p>
      <p>“I used to practice as if I was playing in a match. I used to take hundreds of catches and would stand behind the stumps when five or six batsmen would be at the nets. I made sure that not a single ball slipped out of my gloves. It was also important to concentrate and focus on the ball. The basics had to be right and if the basics are right, you can’t make mistakes,” Mongia said.</p>
      <p>Adding to his woes behind the stumps, Pant has also had a miserable time with the bat — having mustered only 56 runs from his last five T20Is. Mongia noted that while Pant may be more of a batsman than a wicket-keeper, a balancing act between the two will help the youngster improve his game.</p>
      <p>“He has looked more like a batsman than a keeper, but he needs to focus on his keeping as well. If you keep well, you will gain confidence in your batting and if you are batting well, you will be confident to stand behind the stumps. So, that balance has to be there,” he said.</p>
      <p>“There is a lot of competition and quite a few other keepers are also in the line, so he needs to grab opportunities. He is a young talent, and I am sure, with his potential, he will go far,” Mongia added.</p>
