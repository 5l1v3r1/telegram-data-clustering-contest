      <p>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — The China-friendly opposition candidate in Taiwan’s upcoming presidential election is urging Hong Kong to adopt universal suffrage as the best way of stemming months of anti-government protests.</p>
      <p>Han Kuo-yu (Hahn GWOH’-yoo) of the Nationalist Party told reporters Thursday that Taiwan stood as an example of how it was possible to transition to full democracy without major changes to national identity.</p>
      <p>Han faces a tough race in the January 11 election against incumbent Tsai Ing-wen, whom Beijing has sought to isolate politically over her refusal to acknowledge that Taiwan is a part of China.</p>
      <p>Han has endorsed a 1992 agreement with Beijing that Taiwan is a part of China, while maintaining its own interpretation of what that means.</p>
      <p>He said that is the “best foundation” for interaction between the sides.</p>
