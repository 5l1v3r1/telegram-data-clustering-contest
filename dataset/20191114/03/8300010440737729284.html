      <p>At the time it entered service, Stealth technology was still considered classified and the aircraft were't publicly acknowledged until 1988.<br/><br/>It joins other aircraft on display at the library, including Air Force One. It will be exhibited outdoors, near the library's F-14 aircraft.<br/><br/>Lockheed Martin in the Antelope Valley restored and prepared the aircraft for display.<br/><br/>A formal ribbon-cutting ceremony for the aircraft is expected on Dec. 7.</p>
