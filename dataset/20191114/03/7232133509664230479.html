      <h3>Ethereum Price Analysis</h3>
      <p>In the past few days, Ethereum consolidated in a broad range above the $180 support against the US Dollar. ETH bears made a few attempts to push the price below the $180 and $178 support levels, but they failed.</p>
      <p>Similarly, there was no upside break above the $188 and $190 resistance. Recently, the price revisited the $182 support area and started a fresh increase. It broke the $185 resistance and the 100 hourly simple moving average.</p>
      <p>Moreover, there was a spike above the $188 resistance. However, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/13/ethereum-eth-holding-key-support-but-for-how-long/">Ethereum failed to surpass the $190 resistance</a> area and it is currently correcting recent gains. It is now trading below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $182 low to $190 swing high.</p>
      <p>At the moment, the price is approaching the $186 level and the 100 hourly simple moving average. Besides, there is a short term ascending channel forming with support near $186 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.</p>
      <p>More importantly, the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $182 low to $190 swing high is just below the channel support. Therefore, the price could find bids near $185 and continue higher.</p>
      <p>On the upside, the $188 and $190 levels are important hurdles for the bulls. A successful close above the $190 level is needed for a bullish continuation.  The next key resistances are near $200 and $205.</p>
      <p>Conversely, the price could break the channel support and decline below $185. In the mentioned case, the price is likely to revisit the range support area near the $182 level.</p>

      <p>Looking at the <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/ETHUSD/">chart</a>, Ethereum price is stuck in a broad range above the $182 and $180 supports. If the bears continue to struggle near $182, the price is likely to start a strong upward move above $190 in the near term.</p>
