      <p><b>MEDFIELD, Mass.</b> - A Medfield mom has donated a part of her liver to save a baby she's never even met. She learned about the baby in need through her mothers' Facebook group.</p>
      <p>"I promise you don't need to be a superhero to do this," she said.</p>
      <p>Andrea Alberto claims she's just a normal mom. But she's much more than that after saving a baby's life.</p>
      <p>"It's really been amazing for me to get to watch him do so well," she said. </p>
      <p>Alberto learned baby Cal needed a new liver after his mom posted about his condition in a mother's Facebook group. Even though she didn't know this family from Connecticut, Alberto jumped to help.</p>
      <p>About seven weeks ago she donated 30% of her liver to baby Cal, and they both spent two weeks in the hospital recovering.</p>
      <p>"At this point, 7 weeks out, [it's] almost entirely regrown to its original size and my liver will continue to grow in Cal to be the size he needs it to be," she said.</p>
      <p>Alberto was only the 97th person in the U.S. to donate a liver to a stranger. She says her friends, who were also donors, inspired her to do it. Plus, as a single mom of two boys with a full-time job, she says it truly takes a village for all mothers to help each other out.</p>
      <p>"I have a friend right now who comes every week and takes my trash and I have friends who bring me dinner and I have so many people in my life who have supported me in so many different ways," she said. "And I feel like this just falls under the umbrella of the way people help each other."</p>
      <p>For Alberto, donating her liver wasn't a big deal. But she knows just how big of a deal it was for baby Cal and his family.</p>

      <p>"He's doing great," she said. "He had his birthday this week, he just turned one, and he ate birthday cake!"</p>
      <p>She says many people don't realize livers regenerate, and the risks for her were very low. Now she hopes to inspire other donors to save more lives.</p>
      <p>"As long as you're willing to sacrifice a few weeks of your life and get a really cool scar then you can change someone's whole life, which is really incredible," she said.</p>
      <p>Alberto says most people need to wait for a deceased donor to get the liver they need. But the surgery can be so much more successful if there's a living donor willing to help.</p>
