      <p>LONDON: Debutant <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Stefanos-Tsitsipas">Stefanos Tsitsipas</a> crushed defending champion <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Alexander-Zverev">Alexander Zverev</a> 6-3, 6-2 on Wednesday to book his place in the last four of the ATP Finals with a match to spare.</p>
      <p>The 21-year-old, the first Greek player to qualify for the elite eight-man season-ender, backed up his opening win over <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Daniil-Medvedev">Daniil Medvedev</a> with a virtuoso performance at the O2 Arena.</p>
      <p>His straight-sets victory secured a top-two place in the group and left Zverev, world number one Rafael Nadal and Medvedev scrapping to join him in Saturday's semi-finals.</p>
      <p>The evening clash was the youngest, in terms of combined age, at the ATP Finals since Andy Murray played Juan Martin del Potro in 2009, but produced a performance of maturity and sustained quality by Tsitsipas to leave Zverev, 22, in his wake.</p>
      <p>Zverev defeated 19-times Grand Slam champion Nadal in his opening match on Monday, having beaten <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Roger-Federer">Roger Federer</a> and Novak Djokovic back-to-back to win last year's title, but he had no answer to the all-court game of Tsitsipas.</p>
      <p>The Greek broke in the eighth game when Zverev opted to serve and volley on a second serve but made a mess of a low volley and from that point on it was one-way traffic.</p>
      <p>Zverev's level tailed off alarmingly in the second set and Tsitsipas wrapped things up with an ace.</p>
