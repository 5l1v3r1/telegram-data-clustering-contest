      <p>Chris Jericho was out next. He entered the ring and said he proved to be the greatest of all time, following his win over Cody Rhodes at <i>Full Gear.</i> He once again demanded a thank you, but he wanted it from people that matter. He said he’s beaten everyone put in front of him. The lights went out and MJF came out to Cody’s pyro and music.</p>
      <p>MJF said that fans have been booing him as if he’s the villain, but they’ve been cheering the guy who’s the villain all along, Cody. MJF said that Cody didn’t care about any of them, that he only cared about himself. He said that he knows the real Cody and that man is a liar. He also said that Rhodes wanted to make him a puppet, but that Cody’s thumb wasn’t big enough to hold him down.</p>
