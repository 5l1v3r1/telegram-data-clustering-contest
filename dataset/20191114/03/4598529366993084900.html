      <p>Coming off today’s hearing Joe DiGenova and Victoria Toensing appeared on Lou Dobbs show this evening pushing a noxious set of bananas conspiracy theories about George Soros controlling the State Department and the FBI.</p>

      <p>These may sound funny or loopy. But they are right out of the propaganda mills of Hungary’s Viktor Orban and other rightist anti-Semitic movements in Eastern Europe. Indeed, it’s basically the same set of conspiracy theories which led to Judicial Watch’s Chris Farrell being banished from Fox a year ago.</p>
      <p>I was <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/protocols-redux">the first one to highlight what he’d said</a> and what was behind it. That was also on Lou Dobbs show. Farrell’s rhetoric and theories were <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/a-country-awash-in-foxs-dark-toxins">identical to those which had only a short time earlier inspired</a> the massacre at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh.</p>
      <p>DiGenova and Toensing didn’t use the same “Soros-occupied State Department” line which is <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/a-country-awash-in-foxs-dark-toxins">a reference to stock phrases used in neo-Nazi</a> and white supremacist literature. But it’s the same argument, with the same origins.</p>
