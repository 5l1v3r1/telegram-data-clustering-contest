      <p>The minute-long spot, published to the official <a href="https://appleinsider.com/topic/apple+tv+">Apple TV+</a> YouTube account, is titled "Made with love" and takes a closer look at Jericho, the eerily lifelike baby doll that appears to be the centerpiece of the M. Night Shyamalan produced miniseries. <br/><br/>As with <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/11/06/full-length-servant-trailer-hints-at-thriller-storyline-for-nov-28-release">previous clips</a>, today's trailer features a melodic and gentle backing track that contrasts dark and somewhat disturbing imagery. <br/><br/>A bespectacled man is seen caressing Jericho's hands and face, examining his handiwork. The scene cuts to a close-up of the doll's brow, where the craftsman inserts a single hair. Piano cords swell as he moves on to a set of glass eyes, placing one in the doll's right eye socket. <br/><br/>The picture fades out and fades back in, where we find Jericho lying in a crib, arms outstretched. A woman, thought to be the mother figure in the series, picks the doll up and coos to him gently as the "Servant" title board bleeds into view. <br/><br/>Not much is known about "Servant" aside from what little is offered by Apple in a blurb accompanying each ad.<br/><br/>"From M. Night Shyamalan, Servant follows a Philadelphia couple in mourning after an unspeakable tragedy creates a rift in their marriage and opens the door for a mysterious force to enter their home," the text reads.</p>
