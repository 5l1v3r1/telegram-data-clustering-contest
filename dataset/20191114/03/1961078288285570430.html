      <p>As a city dweller for the past 16 years, I’ve inhabited various small apartments measuring 600 square feet or less — and none of them have had ample room for entertaining. In one of those small spaces, I threw a birthday bash with over 20 friends, and I had to toss a blanket over my coffee table so it could serve as extra seating. Needless to say, I’ve learned to be creative, and I’ve found clever workarounds to overcome cramped rooms with awkward layouts when hosting.</p>
      <p>You don’t need to buy a slew of expensive items to make the most of your tiny space. Just a few small changes can help reduce clutter, add comfort and improve the flow of foot traffic. All of these things make a big difference when your guest list swells.</p>
      <p>In collaboration with <a href="https://thewirecutter.com/">Wirecutter</a>, a New York Times company that reviews and recommends products, here are five cheap(ish) things to help make your next party more enjoyable and less chaotic for you and your guests.</p>
      <h3>A wood cutting board</h3>
      <p>A wood cutting board is not only great for meal prep, it also doubles as a way to serve cheese and hors d’oeuvres. You can clear it away right before you sit down to dinner, and it’s just one dirty surface, so you have less to clean up at the end of the night. Wirecutter recommends the <a href="https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-cutting-board/">Proteak Rectangular Edge-Grain Cutting Board</a>. This teak board is perfect for parties because it’s handsome enough to use as a serving platter, and it’s large enough to hold a substantial spread. You can cut directly on the board and scrape crumbs straight into the trash when the party is over.</p>
      <h3>All-purpose wine glasses</h3>
      <p>Having a large collection of stemware specifically for red, white and sparkling wines isn’t feasible in my small kitchen, where cupboard space is at a premium. It’s far more practical to entertain using all-purpose wine glasses that are suitable for every type of wine. You’ll save space by having fewer glasses and also cut down on the amount of cleaning needed at the end of the night. Wirecutter recommends an array of <a href="https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-wine-glass/#why-you-should-trust-us">all-purpose wine glasses</a> made from glass and nonleaded crystal, between $9 and $30 per glass. (If your cupboards are bursting at the hinges and you’d rather hang your stemware from a rack, Wirecutter also recommends the 10-inch <a href="https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/small-kitchen-ideas/#zone-4-non-food-storage">Winco GHC-10 Chrome Plated Wire Glass Hanger</a>.)</p>
      <h3>Folding chairs</h3>
      <p>A set of extra chairs saves the day when friends and family descend on my tiny apartment, whether I’m hosting a Thanksgiving dinner for 14 or just having a low-key movie night with a few friends. I’ve found that folding chairs are best for tight quarters because they take up very little space in my embarrassingly full closet. I like the inexpensive <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Winsome-Wood-Folding-Chairs-Natural/dp/B004XYNE52/ref=sr_1_4?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIyajn2Zfl5QIVVeWGCh0HegOvEAAYASAAEgIb0fD_BwE&amp;hvadid=323459797865&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvlocphy=9060351&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvpos=1t1&amp;hvqmt=b&amp;hvrand=10010221197385604948&amp;hvtargid=kwd-314706575190&amp;hydadcr=3753_9861310&amp;keywords=wood+fold+chair&amp;qid=1573579339&amp;sr=8-4">Winsome Robin Folding Chair Set</a>. These handsome wood chairs are a bit more classy than your typical folding metal or plastic chairs. They’re surprisingly comfortable to sit in for long periods, and they add a warm, cozy touch to any dinner party.</p>
      <h3>A reversible window fan</h3>
      <p>When the oven is cranked and the burners are blazing, my entire apartment quickly becomes a sweltering hotbox — even in the coolest months. If your kitchen lacks sufficient ventilation like mine, a window fan will help prevent the fire alarm from going off when you’re searing meat over high heat, and it will also keep you and your guests cool. Wirecutter’s pick is the <a href="https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-window-fans/">Bionaire Twin Reversible Airflow Window Fan</a>. It’s powerful enough to provide a substantial breeze that can be felt up to 24 feet away. The fan’s reverse setting is great for sucking smoke out of your kitchen, and its easy-to-use interface allows you to adjust the fan speed.</p>
      <h3>A kitchen cart</h3>
      <p>When it comes to throwing parties in my small apartment, a rolling cart is a lifesaver. If you have limited counter space, a cart provides more surface area for chopping vegetables and preparing dinner. Once the party is underway, I roll mine out of the kitchen and turn it into a bar cart. Not only does it free up space for guests to mingle, but it also redirects foot traffic away from the stove, where I may be doing some last-minute cooking. Wirecutter recommends the Ikea <a href="https://wclink.co/link/33525/0/4/96605/?merchant=IKEA">Bekvam</a> kitchen cart. It’s inexpensive, sturdy and easy to assemble. And it has two shelves that provide plenty of extra storage space for mixing bowls, small appliances or booze.</p>
