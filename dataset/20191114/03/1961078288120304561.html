      <h1>How to Do 2 Simple Magic Tricks — and Why You Should Learn Them</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T03:00:01+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 03:00</time> by <a rel="author">Ian Frisch</a></address>
      <p>I could see the gold lion even before my cab came to a stop: the flowing mane, the three-foot-long fangs — leg muscles knotted, ready to pounce. It was as if he was taunting me to enter the 30-story building that he was so aggressively guarding: a massive casino.</p>
      <p>It was August, 2017, and the lion was a statue outside the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. I was in Sin City for Magic Live, the largest convention for magicians in the United States. But this trip wasn’t just a playful jaunt. I was there to film a magic trick that I had invented, which would then be sold to other magicians through a prominent online retail outlet.</p>
      <p>The two years leading up to this event had been sensational, almost impossible to believe: I stumbled into the underground world of magic, became friends with the most influential young magicians in the world, and I eventually became a magician myself. I got to rub elbows with David Blaine and Penn Jillette, and I even had the opportunity to perform magic for the late Anthony Bourdain. <a href="https://info.harpercollins.com/magicisdead/">The entire adventure became my first book, “Magic is Dead.”</a></p>

      <p>My trip to Vegas was a success, and <a href="https://magicstream.com/programs/flip-side?autoplay=true">the trick is now available online</a>, where you can pay to learn how it’s done. But how did I, the random journalist who stumbled upon this world, come to understand magicians’ secrets? Aren’t magicians just, like, <i>born</i> with their abilities?</p>
      <p>Nope. The secret — or method, in magic-speak — behind a trick is normally quite simple, but it’s the magician’s performative flair and masterly execution that makes it come to life.</p>
      <p>Deception-as-performance, however, is not just finger dexterity or a cleverly designed contraption. Magic comes alive when it’s shared between two people; it’s meant to build a connection between performer and spectator. Moreover, a magician’s goal is not merely to create a fantasy for their audience, but to bend, twist, or break their sense of <i>objective</i> reality. That’s a powerful thing.</p>

      <p>And when that happens, a profound element of trust is instilled in the magician. Magic shows you what is possible in the world, and the spectator expects a magician to take them on a journey that they can’t obtain anywhere else. But, sure, we all know it’s just a trick, that some duplicity is afoot. But that break from reality is captivating. It’s something that we can’t find anywhere else. Magic isn’t just silly card tricks; it’s the <i>art</i> of deception — something wholly unique in its experience, an encounter so profound that we can’t help but carry it around with us for a while. The moment of astonishment, fleeting as it may be, becomes a crease in your heart.</p>

      <p>But what is life if not a quest for the spectacular? That’s why humans are naturally drawn to magic. It’s the only situation where people willingly say, without hesitation, <i>Yes, please trick me, please lie to me — and don’t tell me how you did it.</i></p>
      <p>And, really: Who, even as an adult, doesn’t want a break from reality once in a while?</p>
      <p>I came away from my three-year adventure in the underground world of magic convinced that everyone should know a few simple magic tricks. Whether you’re at game night with your friends, a holiday party with co-workers or on an awkward first date, knowing a handful of easy effects can go a long way in breaking the ice, becoming the center of attention or merely jazzing up a night on the couch with your significant other.</p>
      <p>Magic can bring people together, and when it’s done right, an unforgettable moment is shared. I myself have become someone who people call upon to spice up a low-key gathering by performing a handful of card tricks. And now I’m going to bestow onto you some of what I’ve learned during my journey alongside the world’s best magicians.</p>
      <p>Whether you were the recipient of a kiddie magic kit that has since collected dust or met its fate at a family garage sale, or you’re someone who has never even touched a deck of cards, here are two simple magic tricks that you can start performing today.</p>
