      <p>Alternative Airlines, a travel company based in the United Kingdom, has partnered with cryptocurrency service Utrust to facilitate payments with crypto.</p>
      <p>On Nov. 13, the Swiss-based digital payments processor Utrust <a href="https://medium.com/utrust/utrust-takes-to-the-sky-as-we-welcome-alternative-airlines-d3a30901dfb">announced</a> a new partnership with its first merchant in the travel industry, Alternative Airlines. The two companies plan to provide customers with the ability to book flights while paying with cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price-index">BTC</a>), Ethereum (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price-index">ETH</a>), <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/dash-price-index">Dash</a>, DigiByte (<a href="https://coin360.com/coin/digibyte-dgb">DGB</a>) and Utrust’s native token <a href="https://coin360.com/coin/utrust-utk">UTK</a>. </p>
      <h3>Search over 650 airlines and pay with crypto</h3>
      <p>The collaboration between the two companies will introduce instant cross border transactions, buyer protection, and crypto-to-cash settlements to the clients of Alternative Airlines. The travel firm’s website allows customers to search from over 650 airlines such as Delta, United, British Airways, Virgin and Emirates, among others. Utrust CEO, Nuno Correia, said:</p>
      <blockquote>“For business or leisure, flight travel can be expensive with consumers saving for months to afford a trip. Considered a high ticket item, it is imperative that consumers are protected when booking flights. Utrust is providing Alternative Airlines’ customers with the increased security and convenience of cryptocurrency payments, and reducing processing fees, to bring greater transparency and trust to the world of online payments.”</blockquote>
      <p>In August, it was <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/sl-benfica-offers-cryptocurrency-payment-option-for-online-store">reported</a> that Portuguese sports club SL Benfica had partnered with Utrust to facilitate payments via cryptocurrency for tickets and merchandise. The new payment option will allow fans and customers to buy tickets and any products on the club’s website with Utrust’s native <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/tokens">token</a> (UTK), and with top cryptocurrencies Bitcoin and ether.</p>
      <h3>Bitcoin ATM installed at Miami International airport </h3>

The airport’s first Bitcoin ATM was last reported to be in concourse G, next to gate 16. </p>
      <p>Bitstop co-founder and chief strategy officer Doug Carrillo pointed out that more and more people prefer to travel with Bitcoin instead of cash for convenience and security. He said:</p>
      <blockquote>“Miami International Airport is a perfect place for our customers to conveniently exchange their dollars for Bitcoin and vice versa when traveling domestically or abroad.”</blockquote>
