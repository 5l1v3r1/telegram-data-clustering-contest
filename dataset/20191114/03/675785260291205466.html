      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T03:08:22+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 03:08</time> by <a rel="author">Hayley Parker, Kelly Ashmore</a></address>
      <p>A millionaire businessman who left his girlfriend to die after 'rough sex' is fighting against his prison sentence.</p>
      <p>Property tycoon John Broadhurst was <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/breaking-millionaire-property-tycoon-who-13743995">jailed for three years and eight months</a> for the manslaughter of mum-of-one Natalie Connolly, 27.</p>
      <p>Former deputy Labour leader Harriet Harman described the 41-year-old's prison term as "unduly lenient".</p>
      <p>But now Broadhurst is the one launching an appeal against his sentence.</p>
      <p>The case will be heard at the Court of Appeal today, <a href="https://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/news/stoke-on-trent-news/staffordshire-millionaire-businessman-who-left-3533144">Stoke on Trent Live</a> reports.</p>
      <p>The court heard Natalie was found lying in the hallway at her home she shared with Broadhurst in Kinver, Staffordshire, in December 2016.</p>
      <p>He had gone to bed and left her there after a night of drinking.</p>

      <p>She had more than 40 separate injuries - including serious internal trauma and a 'blow-out' fracture to her left eye – and a post mortem showed she had died from acute alcohol intoxication and blunt force injuries.</p>
      <p>Natalie had told witnesses that she and the defendant had an interest in masochistic sex.</p>
      <p>The defendant - said during his trial to be worth up to £15 million - had separated from a former partner, who was pregnant with their second child, around three months before Natalie's death.</p>

      <p>Broadhurst was cleared of murdering Natalie and causing her grievous bodily harm on the directions of the judge following legal submissions part-way through his trial at Birmingham Crown Court.</p>
      <p>As he jailed Broadhurst for 44 months, Mr Justice Julian Knowles told the father-of-three: "You were capable of taking decisions and making choices.</p>
      <p>"This was grossly irresponsible behaviour by you.</p>

      <p>"You left that vulnerable young woman to die in the saddest and most avoidable of circumstances. You showed blatant disregard for a very drunk and injured woman."</p>
      <p>Detective Inspector Victoria Downing, of Staffordshire Police, said after the case: "Natalie was callously and cold-heartedly left fatally injured at the bottom of the stairs by Broadhurst.</p>
      <p>"Yet he didn't call for help until 9.30am and then showed total disregard for what he had done when he spoke to the emergency services."</p>
