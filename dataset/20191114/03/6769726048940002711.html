      <p>THE family of a man who died at a Balga pool are trying to raise money for a funeral to honour the doting father-of-two, amid questions over the circumstances of his death.</p>
      <p>Jonathan Massandy (29) died in hospital following an accident at Leisurepark Balga on November 3 while swimming with his six-year-old daughter.</p>
      <p>Sarah Prijt (26), the mother of Mr Massandy’s daughter and nearly two-year-old son, has started a Go Fund Me page on behalf of his parents to cover funeral costs.</p>
      <blockquote>“…He was the love of my life”</blockquote>
      <p>The couple met eight years ago and though they separated not long after their son was born, Ms Prijt said they were starting to repair their relationship.</p>
      <p>“Now I feel so broken because he was the love of my life,” she said.</p>
      <p>“We’d just talked about him having more time with them so we could slowly take steps forward to possibly coming back together and now that’s gone.”</p>

      <p>Ms Prijt described the Balga landscaper as “superman” and a kind, generous and loving person who put everyone before himself.</p>
      <p>“He’s just a good person and he’s an amazing dad,” she said.</p>
      <p>“He loves them.”</p>

      <p>The circumstances surrounding his death are being investigated but Ms Prijt believes there was no lifeguard watching.</p>
      <p>“I’m absolutely heartbroken for my daughter because she’s the one that actually had to go find help,” she said.</p>
      <blockquote>“A six-year-old little girl shouldn’t ever see her dad die”</blockquote>
      <p>“She went up to a lady that had to go find a lifeguard.</p>
      <p>“A six-year-old little girl shouldn’t ever see her dad die. I know he’d be so upset right now his little girl had to go through it all by herself.”</p>
      <p>She also believes the pool stayed open after the incident but the City of Stirling, which runs the pool, said it could not comment while it was being investigated.</p>

      <p>“Given the matter is currently under coronial investigation, it is not appropriate for the City to comment on the particulars of the incident at this time,” community development director Michael Quirk said.</p>
      <p>The City said its thoughts were with the family.</p>
      <p>Ms Prijt said she had been in constant contact with Mr Massandy’s parents since the tragedy and his older brother and sister were also struggling with his death.</p>

      <p>“It’s a pretty broken family at the moment,” she said.</p>
      <p>“I have to keep my head strong for the kids, which is really hard because all I want to do is cry.”</p>

      <p>The online fundraiser has raised more than $6000 of its $10,000 goal and Ms Prijt said they just wanted to give the “all round top person” the send-off he deserved.</p>
