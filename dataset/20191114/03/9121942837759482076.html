      <p>PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) — Officials in Cambodia have ordered that elephants that serve as tourist attractions at the country’s famed Angkor temple complex be moved to a new home in a suitable jungle area.</p>
      <p>The agency that oversees the Angkor site said in a statement Thursday it is important for the animals to be able to live in their natural habitat, and there are other ways to provide attractions and rides for tourists.</p>
      <p>Some of the 14 elephants officially at the site are old and in ill health. They have been providing rides for tourists since 2001. A female elephant there died of heart failure in the heat after giving a tourist a ride.</p>
      <p>The agency said tourists will be allowed to see the elephants at their new location but not ride them.</p>
