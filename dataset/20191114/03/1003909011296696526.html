      <h1>Students should be protected from being 'blindsided' by harmful expression, committee hears</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T03:33:42+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 03:33</time> by <a rel="author">Meghan Potkins, Calgary Herald</a></address>
      <p>The city could proceed with plans to draft a bylaw aimed at protecting children from “harmful” demonstrations near Calgary schools, following a vote at a council committee Wednesday.</p>
      <p>City staff have been working with local school boards since April when council voted to explore creating “safe zones” around schools — a move that was partly in response to an <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/city-councillor-says-its-time-to-debate-protest-buffer-zone-for-schools">incident at a Hillhurst school where demonstrators targeted students with graphic anti-choice abortion pictures</a>.</p>
      <p>A number of school administrators and educators urged committee members to proceed with creating a bylaw to protect students.</p>
      <p>“We’re not trying to shut down free speech here,” said Gord Baldwin, principal of Central Memorial High School. “People are entitled to their passionate arguments and their opinions on any number of topics. But I would argue that we should continue to preserve and protect the safety around our schools.</p>
      <p>“When they walk out of their school and are blindsided by graphic images and unwanted presentation — that, I think, is where we need to draw the line.”</p>
      <p>A guidance councillor at Crescent Heights High School said a number of students at her school are particularly vulnerable to being disturbed by graphic imagery because of past experiences of violence and abuse, or as a result of experiences they survived in conflict zones where they lived before coming to Calgary.</p>
      <p>“The signs and shouting are definitely disruptive to students,” she said. “When protesters come, it’s literally right outside our front door and it’s usually around lunch time.</p>
      <p>“(Students) go for their lunch with their friends down on Centre Street and that’s what they see . . . We spend the afternoon trying to regulate them. Some of them shout at the protesters, some of them hide in the bathroom; some of them, we’ve just got to call parents and say, ‘they’re not feeling safe here today so we need to get them home’.”</p>

      <p>Somewhat similar provincial legislation already exists creating safe-access zones around Alberta’s abortion clinics. Safe-access laws also exist in B.C., Newfoundland and Labrador, Quebec and Ontario. Alberta’s former health minister had previously suggested the NDP government would amend legislation to prevent such protests around K-12 schools — though no such law was passed before the NDP was voted out of office.</p>
      <p>Committee members voted 6-1 directing city staff to begin drafting a bylaw.</p>
      <p>Only Coun. Jeromy Farkas was opposed. He called the demonstrations and events described in Wednesday’s committee “heinous” — but said he couldn’t support proceeding with a bylaw. Farkas said the city only consulted administrators and failed to consult students on the potential effects of such a law on them.</p>
      <p>“I do not disagree with what the outcome is that we’re trying to achieve here, but I believe that it does not strike the thoughtful balance on protecting the freedom of expression of the students themselves,” said Farkas.</p>
      <p>Council will vote on the matter at a future meeting.</p>
