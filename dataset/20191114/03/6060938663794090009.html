      <p>INDORE: <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/ravichandran-ashwin">Ravichandran Ashwin</a> bowling with the new ball was a common sight during the home series against South Africa in 2015. The Indian team management was probably not as confident about its pace bowlers <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/ishant-sharma">Ishant Sharma</a>, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/mohammed-shami">Mohammad Shami</a> and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/umesh-yadav">Umesh Yadav</a> then.</p>
      <p>Four years later, the scenario has changed. India has a lethal pace bowling attack, even at home. Such is the confidence of the team management now that they are happy to play on green tracks.</p>
      <p>One could see this confidence when <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Virat-Kohli">Virat Kohli</a> talked about his pace battery here on Wednesday. "If you ask me, we are right at the top. I won't even count ourselves in the top three. These guys deserve it. As a captain when we started off, I really wanted to see it happen," Kohli said about his pacers.</p>
      <p>"Batting was never an issue; spin was never an issue. After Zak (<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Ramachandra-Guha">Zaheer Khan</a>) and all the stalwarts went away, we talked about how we could get back to the top, have the ability and the firepower to pick 20 wicketsâ€¦ (now) it's the belief that stands out. Any kind of pitch, any kind of opposition, they believe they can get more out of the pitch than the opposition. That belief matters a lot. In fact, it is everything for a fast bowler," Kohli said.</p>
      <p>"I couldn't be happier for them and the best thing is they are still not done yet. They're getting hungrier every time they step out and that's their biggest strength," he said.</p>
      <p>On the opposition, Kohli said: "We have to have absolute respect for the game, and in that process the opposition we play against. The intent and respect towards that match or the game of cricket cannot change."</p>
      <p>The core of Indian team has remained pretty much the same in the since 2014-15. "All of us have been part of taking the team from the stage that we were in 2014-15 to No. 1 in Test cricket. We understand how much effort each one of us has put to take the Indian team to No. 1 position over the 4-5 years. That's one reason why we play the way we do because we just love playing," he said.</p>
