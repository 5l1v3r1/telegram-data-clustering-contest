      <h1>It’s Been Confirmed: All Of ‘The Simpsons’ Will Be On Disney+ At Launch</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T03:09:23+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 03:09</time> by <a rel="author">Joseph Earp</a></address>
      <p>Ever since we first heard the news that <a href="https://preview.disneyplus.com/au">Disney+</a> was coming to Australia, there was only one question on the lips of most fans: was the streaming service going to host <i>The Simpsons</i>?</p>
      <p>It wasn’t obvious that it would. After all, in Australia, the show is the domain of cable, so it was always possible that contracts might stop Disney+ from rolling the show out here as they have already done in America (<a href="https://junkee.com/simpsons-disney-plus-ratio/229360">to some ire from hardcore fans.</a>)</p>
      <p>But nope, looks like nobody has the power to stop the mouse: <i>The Simpsons</i> will be available on Disney+ Australia at launch.</p>
      <p>And not just some content either: all of it.</p>
      <p>Disney+ will host every single season of the show, along with <i>The Simpsons Movie</i>.</p>
      <p>What more could you possibly want?</p>
      <p>To celebrate, let’s enjoy this perfect gag from one of the <a href="https://junkee.com/longform/simpsons-best-episodes">best episodes.</a></p>
