      <h3>You can spend a lot of money in Los Cabos, the two towns at the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula that make up one of Mexico’s most popular tourist spots.</h3>
      <p>You’ll see a fair number of wealthy people around, and you can shell out $500 a night to be pampered at a ritzy all-inclusive resort, if you want.</p>
      <p>For my husband and myself, it’s just not in the budget, and frankly not our style. We’re do-it-yourself vacationers, leery of package deals (there’s always a lot of rules in the fine print) and not keen to be crowded around a pool with fellow tourists overdoing it on the margaritas, while never encountering a local resident who isn’t paid to serve us.</p>
      <p>Instead, we booked early and for the price of a room at a typical hotel in Saskatoon or Regina, we rented a two-bedroom suite with a full kitchen in a gorgeous boutique hotel on the beach, where we often felt like we had the whole place to ourselves.</p>
      <p>It was February. The weather at home was frigid and we were relaxing in the heat, playing dominoes by the pool as the waves crashed into shore a few yards away and fishermen tossed nets into the water.</p>

      <p>Los Cabos (often simply called “Cabo”) is a catch-all term to describe two separate towns — San Jose del Cabo, where international flights land, and Cabo San Lucas, a marina town where yachts and cruise ships dock — linked by a short stretch of seaside highway that passes a string of resorts and hotels. We chose a hotel about midway between the towns, and spent time in each.</p>
      <p>We had no need to rent a car. Taxis provided our airport transportation and we found the local minibuses a handy and inexpensive way to get around the rest of the time, alongside regular folks going about their lives.</p>
      <p>The food: both towns are packed with restaurants, as expected. Cabo San Lucas is home to some tourist-trap spots, including the famous Cabo Wabo Cantina, founded by Sammy Hagar and other members of Van Halen. We got a different sort of kick from lunching at places catering to sport fishing enthusiasts — they often have great fish and drinks for lower prices — and visiting restaurants recommended by people we met along the way. Vendors around the marina were selling fresh shrimp ceviche to snack on.</p>
      <p>Our hotel’s restaurant served high-quality food on a raised, shaded terrace overlooking the beach. Staff left binoculars on the tables so diners could watch passing whales.</p>
      <p>Speaking of whales: the winter months are whale-watching months here. Of course, pricey tours are available from Cabo San Lucas on large boats crammed with tourists. We chose instead to share a water taxi with a handful of new acquaintances for a ride past the famous rock arch (El Arco) to the beautiful Playa del Amore (Lovers Beach) — and along the way our driver happily detoured to get us closer to a pod.</p>
      <p>A word about the beaches around Cabo: most of the hotel beaches are not suitable for swimming. They are beautiful and clean, but the undertow is too dangerous to risk. The beach outside our hotel was often deserted, which afforded us plenty of opportunities for peaceful strolls by the surf.</p>
      <p>Several safe public beaches are located along the coast, however. We rented snorkel gear from a dive shop in town and spent a lovely day at Chileno Beach, one of the most popular. Lovers Beach is also not to be missed.</p>
      <p>Feeling particularly adventurous and in need of exercise one day, we splurged on one of the many zip-line excursions available in the hilly tropical desert nearby. The staff were friendly and professional, and we went home with a collection of unforgettable photos.</p>
