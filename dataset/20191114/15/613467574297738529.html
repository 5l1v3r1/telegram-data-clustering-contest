      <p>The Tesla Model 3 has been named as one of three finalists in <i>Motortrend</i>‘s 2020 Car of the Year award rankings, alongside the Chevrolet Corvette and the Kia Soul.</p>
      <p><i>Motortrend</i> released the lists of finalists on November 12 and will evaluate each vehicle by six different criteria to determine the winner: Safety, Efficiency, Value, Advancement in Design, Engineering Excellence, and Performance of Intended Function.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.motortrendgroup.com/motortrend-announces-its-2020-awards-podium-finalists/"><i>Motortrend</i> notes the 2020 Tesla Model 3</a> as the best sport sedan on the market. “The 2020 Model 3’s interior design continues to be modern and minimalistic, but it’s elegant in its simplicity. The 2020 Model 3’s seats offer more bolstering, and rear passengers now enjoy a more ergonomic position, as the bench has been raised for improved comfort. In terms of driving, the Model 3 offers impressive dynamic performance as well as battery-pack range that continues to be the benchmark for electric vehicles,” the publication wrote.</p>
      <p>In terms of the six criteria, the Model 3 will be extremely competitive with both the Chevy Corvette and Kia Soul. The Model 3 was <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-model-3-earns-flawless-5-star-safety-rating-from-nhtsa/">given a five-star safety rating</a> from the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA) and was given the <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-model-3-iihs-top-safety-pick-plus-award/">“Top Safety Pick+” award</a> by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS). The conjunction of these two awards could allow <i>Motortrend</i> to recognize the Model 3 as the safest vehicle on the road today.</p>
      <p>The Model 3 is one of the most efficient vehicles on the road today as well. The Long Range All-Wheel Drive variant offers drivers 322 miles of range on a single charge, while the Performance trim offers 310 miles. Not to mention, the Model 3’s environmental efficiency is top-ranked due to the car’s zero-emissions nature.</p>
      <p>Advancement in Design is another one of the Model 3’s most impressive features. The car, along with the rest of Tesla’s released models is able to improve through the company’s frequent updates, like the most recent V10 software. Not only does Tesla improve upon the entertainment and accessibility features, but the updates can also affect performance features. The Model 3 is constantly improving with these updates, thanks to Elon Musk and his team at Tesla.</p>
      <p>Recognized as having an “excellent design” by former General Motors car designer <a href="http://www.automobilemag.com/news/2018-design-of-the-year-tesla-model-3/">Robert Cumberford</a>, the Model 3 is competitive to the Corvette and Soul in engineering excellence. Cumberford stated that the “function is embodied in a minimalist manner, providing elegant simplicity” compared to other vehicles, and compared its “deceptive” simpleness to Apple products.</p>
      <p>The Performance trim of the Model 3 is one of the highest quality vehicles on the market with a 0-60 MPH time of 3.2 seconds. <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-model-3-vs-toyota-supra-2020-race/">The Model 3 has outperformed vehicles</a> like the Ferrari F12, the 2020 Toyota Supra, and a 2020 Ford Mustang GT on drag races, proving you do not need a loud, gas-powered motor to win 1/8 and 1/4-mile races. In fact, electric vehicles are more likely to outperform their petrol-based counterparts, as they utilize instant torque for quick acceleration.</p>
      <p>The Model 3 has been given multiple awards since its initial deliveries in July 2017. Most recently, Tesla CEO Elon Musk was given the Golden Steering Wheel Award for the Model 3 in Berlin, Germany, the future home of Gigafactory 4. The list of the Model 3’s <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-model-3-car-of-the-year-parkers-guide/">recognition as one of the best vehicles in the world</a> is lengthy, and the vehicle makes a strong case that it could be the recipient of <i>Motortrend</i>‘s 2020 Car of the Year award.</p>
