      <p>An amateur boxer accused of breaking Co Fermanagh businessman Kevin Lunney's nose is to contest charges of assaulting two police officers during his arrest, a court heard today.</p>
      <p>Bernard McGovern's lawyer confirmed he intends to deny the allegations connected to his detention in September.</p>
      <p>Up to five witnesses will now give evidence at a trial listed for hearing in Belfast early next year.</p>
      <p>McGovern, 22, of Springtown Road in Kinawley, Co Fermanagh, is facing extradition proceedings after being detained on a European Arrest Warrant.</p>
      <p>He is wanted in the Republic of Ireland over claims he was involved in an attack on two Quinn Industrial Holdings (QIH) executives at a service station in Co Cavan on February 1.</p>
      <p>Previous courts were told Mr Lunney suffered a broken nose, while his colleague Dara O'Reilly had a cup of hot water poured onto his face.</p>
      <p>McGovern is not accused of any role in subsequent, separate events on September 17 when Mr Lunney was abducted and tortured.</p>
      <p>In that incident the businessman was beaten, stabbed and dumped by a roadside across the border in Co Cavan.</p>
      <p>Mr Lunney is a director in a company made up of elements of the former business empire founded by ex-tycoon Sean Quinn Sr.</p>
      <p>Mr Quinn, at one time Ireland's richest man, has repeatedly condemned any targeting of those now running QIH.</p>
      <p>Attempts to have McGovern extradited are on hold pending the outcome of the case against him in Belfast.</p>
      <p>He faces charges of assaulting two PSNI officers - one male and one female - and resisting police.</p>
      <p>The alleged offences were committed on September 19 - when he was detained on the arrest warrant.</p>
      <p>McGovern was not present for today's review hearing at Belfast Magistrates' Court.</p>
      <p>A prosecution lawyer said body-worn footage of the alleged incident has been obtained and will be served on the defence "as soon as possible".</p>
      <p>Pressed by District Judge Steven Keown, defence solicitor Michael Brentnall confirmed McGovern will be contesting the charges.</p>
      <p>It was also set out that five witnesses, including the two injured parties, are expected to be called.</p>
      <p>Adjourning proceedings, Mr Keown listed the case for trial on February 12.</p>
