      <p>Surge protectors are boring, but completely necessary in tons of situations. Whether you’re trying to hook up everything to your home theater system or get your computer workstation sorted out, you’re very likely going to need more than just two outlets from the wall. Having something to protect them from surges and other damage is just icing on the cake.</p>
      <p>They don’t have to be expensive, though. Right now Amazon is running a lightning deal on an 8-outlet surge protector from Bestek that knocks its price down to just $19.99. It offers 600 joules of protection, and even has four USB ports to directly connect things like phones and tablets without wasting an outlet on a charging adapter.</p>
      <p>This lightning deal won’t last all day, though, so if you need it, jump on it before it’s gone.</p>
