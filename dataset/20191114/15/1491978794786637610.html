        <i>• Former Plymouth manager appointed last month <br/>• Dismissal follows slump in form and shock FA Cup exit</i>
      </p>
      <p>Carl Fletcher has been sacked as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/leytonorient">Leyton Orient</a> manager only 29 days after being appointed.</p>
      <p>The former Plymouth manager took over last month after the interim head coach, Ross Embleton, stood down, but has seen his side’s form slump, with one point from three <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/leaguetwofootball">League Two</a> games and a painful home FA Cup exit to eighth-tier Maldon and Tiptree last Sunday.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.leytonorient.com/2019/11/14/club-statement-carl-fletcher/">A statement</a> from the east London club’s chairman, Nigel Travis, said: “It’s unfortunate for the club that we have parted company with Carl after such a short time, particularly as we are a club that tries to preserve stability. However,we felt this was in the best interests of all parties and we thank him for his hard work and wish him every success in the future.”</p>
      <p>Embleton, Danny Webb and Jobi McAnuff will take control of first-team affairs in the meantime, as they did for the early part of the season following the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/09/justin-edinburgh-will-be-missed-for-his-spirit-as-much-as-his-success-leyton-orient-football">death in June of Justin Edinburgh</a>, who led Orient to the National League title last season.</p>
      <p>Orient are 16th in League Two and face Scunthorpe at home on Saturday.</p>
