      <p>A man who took intimate pictures and a video of his ex-partner while she was sleeping has been placed on the sex offenders’ register.</p>
      <p>James Brown sexually assaulted the woman while she was sleeping and took creepy pictures of the ordeal.</p>
      <p>The 29-year-old pleaded guilty to sexual assault and taking the pictures and video when he appeared before Kilmarnock Sheriff Court this week.</p>
      <p>The prosecutor told the court how Brown, of Lanehead Terrace New Cumnock, had been in a relationship with the woman which ended in November 2016.</p>
      <p>He said: “After the relationship had ended the accused moved in with a family member.</p>
      <p>“At the end of July 2018 the accused had left a USB stick within a game console which was discovered by the accused’s brother who looked at the content.</p>
      <p>“On examining it he was concerned.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The court heard how the USB contained a number of pictures and a video which “appeared to show the complainer when she was asleep in bed.”</p>
      <p>The pictures, which were taken at an address in Kilmarnock, show the woman under the covers with two showing the woman’s private parts and five showing Brown’s performing a sexual act on the woman.</p>
      <p>The fiscal depute described how Brown had a number of tattoos which helped to identify him in the pictures.</p>
      <p>The woman was made aware of the files and confirmed that they had been taken without her consent.</p>
      <p>A video, taken while the woman was visibly asleep, also shows Brown performing a sexual act on the woman.</p>
      <p>The prosecutor said: “The accused was arrested and interviews and his position was that he accepted that he had taken the pictures and video when the complainer was asleep.</p>
      <p>“The interview with the accused shows a lack of understanding in terms of what consent is.”</p>
      <p>Brown was then cautioned and charged.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>His defence agent told the court: “Taking pictures on a consensual basis was a part of the relationship and there appears to be a lack on understanding about consent.”</p>
      <p>Brown’s lawyer told the court that his time serving in the armed forces had led to a number of health issues.</p>
      <p>He was made subject to the sex offenders register and will be sentenced next month.</p>
