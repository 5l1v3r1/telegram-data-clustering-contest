      <p>Instead, ITV are making room for live coverage of England's Euro 2020 qualifier against Montenegro.</p>
      <p>Even though the Group A qualifier doesn't kick off until 7.45pm, the pre-match build up will begin at Wembley Stadium at 7pm.</p>
      <p>The Live International Football will be presented by Mark Pougatch, and marks England's 1,000th international match.</p>
      <p>Analysis will come from Roy Keane, Lee Dixon and Ashley Cole, and commentary by Clive Tyldesley and Glenn Hoddle.</p>

      <p>This all means that Emmerdale's regular 7pm and 8pm showings are being shunted from the schedule.</p>
      <p>Emmerdale has only missed one instalment out of six this week, having aired two episodes together on Tuesday.</p>
      <aside>Once again, Emmerdale's double episode is replaced by football.</aside>
      <p>But fans aired their frustrations on Twitter, after becoming increasingly fed up with the changes to the schedules.</p>
      <p>One wrote: "Once again, Emmerdale's double episode is replaced by football."</p>

      <p>Another said: "Horror! No Emmerdale on Thursday because of the football!"</p>
      <p>A third added: "How dare football replace Emmerdale?!"</p>
      <p>Emmerdale will make up for tonight's absence by showing seven episodes next week - a double on Tuesday (November 19), and the usual split double bill on Thursday (November 21).</p>
