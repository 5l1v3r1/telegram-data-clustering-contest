        <b>Greater Anglia say that lines have re-opened after rail passengers were told not travel following an emergency incident.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Emergency services were dealing with an incident close to the railway between Chadewell Heath and Romford in Essex meaning that some lines were blocked.</p>
      <p>Services between Ipswich and London Liverpool street were cancelled, delayed or revised and will remain so until 4pm today.</p>
      <p>A number of services into the capital from Suffolk and Essex were cancelled.</p>
      <p>As a result Greater Anglia were warning travellers to stay away as they run a reduced service.</p>
      <p>Greater Anglia tickets are being accepted on the London Underground , c2c sevices and First Essex bus routes between Colchester and Colchester Town.</p>
      <p>In a statement on their website the rail operator said: "Greater Anglia and Network Rail are sorry if your journey has been affected by this disruption."</p>
