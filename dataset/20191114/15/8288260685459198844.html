      <p>A Tamworth football mum has come up with a great idea to reuse and recycle your little ones’ football boots whilst saving the cost of growing feet!</p>
      <p>Mum-of-four Emily Cole came up with the idea ‘Boot Buddies Swap Shop’ to give outgrown football boots a new lease of life.</p>
      <p>According to Emily, the idea is simple. You grow out of your football boots and, if they’re in a good, clean, usable condition, you can donate them to ‘Boot Buddies’ and in return you can take another pair home in your new required size.</p>

      <p>The not-for-profit service is completely free, with Emily saying: “My boys have been playing football for years so we went through a lot of boots.</p>
      <p>“When my kids outgrow them sometimes they’re like brand new and I always think, ‘what can I do with them?’ Throwing them out is a waste when someone else could benefit from them.</p>
      <p>“So I came up with Boot Buddies to help other football families and reduce waste.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“Just in our club there are so many teams. Our kids’ feet grow so quick they only wear them for a little while and when boots are £50 a pair it can get very expensive.</p>
      <p>“There are parents who can’t afford new boots, so we’re thinking of those families too.</p>

      <p>“There’s no cost and as long as you bring in a pair in good, reusable condition you can take another pair home.”</p>
      <p>Currently, Emily is looking for donations before she holds the first swap shop event.</p>
      <p>She said: “At the moment I’m looking for as many people to donate as possible. I want there to be a good choice for people to choose from.</p>
      <p>“If people donate now they will get a redeemable voucher to use at the first swap shop event.</p>
      <p>“Thank you to everyone who has donated so far, your generosity has not gone unnoticed.”</p>

      <p>The best way to donate any old boots to the scheme is to message Emily on the ‘Boot Buddies Swap Shop’ Facebook page. She can then arrange with you a time or place to pick them up or drop them off.</p>
      <p>When a date for the first swap shop event is announced people can turn up on the day with boots to swap as long as they are clean and in good reuseable condition.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, Emily hopes the scheme will save money, cut down on waste and help the football community by giving a little back.</p>
