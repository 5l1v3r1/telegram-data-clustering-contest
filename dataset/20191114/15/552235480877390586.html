      <h1>Plans for 37 plush homes at eyesore Seafield House get go-ahead</h1>
      <h2>At risk mansion is saved after decades of lying empty</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T15:58:56+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 15:58</time> by <a rel="author">Sarah Hilley, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/sarah-hilley/</a></address>
      <p>An historic Ayr mansion will be saved after plans for 37 homes got the go-ahead today. </p>
      <p>Eyesore Seafield House has lain empty for nearly 30 years. </p>
      <p>But this  morning developer Robin Ghosh scored planning permission to convert the building into 10 flats with 20 car park spaces.</p>
      <p>And 27 four and five bedroom houses complete with garages will  be built  on the grounds. </p>
      <p>Objectors voiced concerns about hundreds of trees being chopped down to make way for builders. </p>
      <p>Mr Ghosh said his firm Econstruct had poured “considerable resources” into making sure the landmark survives for future generations.</p>
      <p>Justifying the building of 27 houses, he said they are necessary to absorb the financial hit of transforming the crumbling former Seafield hospital. </p>
      <p> South Ayrshire Council's regulatory panel heard there is a blanket tree preservation order on the site. </p>
      <p>But it is understood 446 trees will be chopped down. </p>
      <p>Councillors decided saving the endangered building took precedence over the trees. </p>
      <p>Former bank manager Alison Donnan who lives near the Seafield property said: “The prospect of the trees being cut down fills me with absolute horror.”</p>
      <p>She pointed out the area was rich with wildlife. </p>
      <p>Another objector John Lees said the removal of mature trees on coastal land between two rivers could have a “significant effect” on flooding in this time of climate change. </p>
      <p>He was worried about the impact of more vehicles on Doonfoot and Seafield Roads.</p>

      <p>The Doonfoot Road pile was once home to famous Scottish engineer William Arrol.</p>
      <p>Later it was a hospital for sick children before it closed in the early 1990s. </p>
      <p>Friends of Seafield House support the planning application.</p>
      <p>Representing the group, architect Patrick Lorimer said: “One reason the building survived a fire and years of neglect is its iron frame structure.</p>
      <p>"That frame was designed by Arrol.”</p>
      <p>“It is time Ayr took some action to preserve its heritage.</p>
      <p>"This would seem the ideal opportunity.”</p>
      <p>Econstruct Estates Seafield has teamed up with Glasgow Westpoint Homes to deliver the development.</p>
      <p>Councillor Craig Mackay pointed out there are no affordable homes or a play area as part of the proposed development.</p>
      <p>He said: “I recognise without the new development we would lose another historic building in Ayr. "</p>
      <p>Councillor Ian Cavana said he didn't  want see another "Holmston House" which has been empty for years.</p>
      <p>He voiced concern about the loss of trees and said it was ironic that no bats were spotted during a wildlife survey at the site. </p>
      <p>He said: “I have to take the word that no bats have been seen.”</p>
      <p>Mr Ghosh said 200 trees would be planted and no protected species were found during the survey.</p>
      <p>Bats, otters and great crested newts are among the wildlife that are covered by the special protection. </p>
      <p>Councillors approved the application. </p>
      <p>One resident was heard muttering it is a joke as people left the council chambers. </p>
      <p>A crowd of supporters chatted outside the meeting room  afterwards in celebratory mood.</p>
      <p>NHS Ayrshire &amp;Arran  objected to the proposals for a number of reasons including parking concerns. </p>
      <p>One problem voiced in the NHS objection said: “The works proposed to the former bus shelter, lie within the board’s title and no permission has been sought or given.”</p>
      <p>The board operates the neighbouring Arrol Park Resource centre. </p>
      <p>Bosses are worried about visitors to the development parking in Arrol Park. </p>
