      <h1>Vietnam have long way to go after UAE victory: coach Park - VnExpress International</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T15:33:36+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 15:33</time> by <a rel="author">VnExpress</a></address>
      <p>Vietnam still have four games left in the 2022 World Cup qualification, and their next game will come in another five days, against big regional rival Thailand.</p>
      <p>"We would soon forget tonight’s victory and would go back to practice tomorrow to prepare for that match," said Park at a press conference after the UAE game in Hanoi.</p>
      <p>He said the victory against UAE was meaningful, bringing Vietnam to top of the group.</p>
      <p>"It was an effort from all players, not any individual," he said.</p>
      <p>While noting that there were some moments when the Vietnamese team’s performance faltered, Park also thought his players played to the best of their abilities and thanked them.</p>
      <p>Nguyen Tien Linh scored the match's only goal from a beautiful swerve from outside the penalty area in the 44th minute.</p>
      <p>"He's one of the young forwards who shows the most potential in Vietnam at the present," Park said.</p>
      <p>Park and his UAE counterpart were at odds about the red card handed to UAE's midfielder Khalifa Al Hammadi in the 37th minute for a foul against forward Linh.</p>
      <p>Park said he agreed that the referee was right to hand out a red card.</p>
      <p>"If it weren’t for that foul, Vietnam could have scored," said Park.</p>
      <p>But Bert van Marwijk, the Dutch coach for the UAE team, said he has watched the moment again and believed it was not a foul. "I’ve never seen a referee handing out a red card so quickly. I was shocked."</p>
      <p>"The red card decided the game’s result tonight. I am very disappointed because we did not deserve a result like this," he said.</p>
      <p>He insisted that his team did not deserve a loss, but still congratulated Vietnam for their win.</p>
      <p>"Vietnam are a good team. They have very interesting playstyle, with an impressive defense roster.</p>
      <p>"Vietnam played well tonight. You guys stand a very good chance to advance in the qualifiers," he said.</p>
      <p>The UAE match was Vietnam's fourth for the 2022 World Cup qualifiers. They started the run with a draw against Thailand in September, before beating both Indonesia and Malaysia.</p>
