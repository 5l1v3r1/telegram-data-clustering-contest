      <h2>Bhavkiran Dhesi died in August 2017; five members of the same family are charged in connection with her death</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T15:30:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 15:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.northdeltareporter.com/author/tracy-holmes/" target="_blank">Tracy Holmes</a></address>
      <p>The five people accused in the August 2017 death of Surrey teen Bhavkiran Dhesi made brief appearances in Surrey Provincial Court Wednesday morning – though not in person.</p>
      <p>All five – Harjot Singh Deo, Inderdeep Kaur Deo, Manjit Kaur Deo, Gurvinder Singh Deo and Talwinder Khun Khun – were represented by counsel for the proceedings, which took place in Court 104. The matter was adjourned until Jan. 20, 2020.</p>
      <p>In requesting the adjournment, Crown Mike Fortino cited ongoing disclosure.</p>
      <p>There is a publication ban on any evidence that has been presented. Charges against the accused range from second-degree murder to interference with a dead body. All five have been released on bail, following proceedings in B.C. Supreme Court; Harjot Deo was the most recent to be granted release.</p>

      <p>He was arrested in May at Vancouver Airport in connection with Dhesi’s death. The 19-year-old’s body was found in a torched SUV in South Surrey in the early morning hours of Aug. 2, 2017.</p>
      <p>Police have said Dhesi and Deo had been in a romantic relationship, and that Dhesi had “recently recovered from a kidney transplant.”</p>
      <p>The four other accused are Harjot Deo’s mother, sister, brother and cousin.</p>
