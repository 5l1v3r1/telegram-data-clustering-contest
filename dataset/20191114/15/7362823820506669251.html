      <p>A <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/trials">jury</a> in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southwest/texas">Texas</a> has handed down a death sentence for a self-proclaimed <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/topic/mexican-cartel-violence">Mexican drug cartel</a> hitman who was convicted in the 2017 <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime">murders</a> of his roommate, who was beheaded, and the roommate’s 17-year-old girlfriend.</p>
      <p>Hector Acosta-Ojeda, originally from Mexico, was sentenced Wednesday in a Tarrant County court a week after he was found guilty of capital murder in the killings of Erick Zelaya and Iris Chirinos.</p>

      <p>Acosta-Ojeda shot Zelaya and Chirinos in their sleep at the Arlington home they shared in September 2017, the <a href="https://www.star-telegram.com/news/local/crime/article237110334.html">Fort Worth Star-Telegram</a> reported. He beheaded Zelaya and mutilated the couple’s bodies with a machete and two-by-four.</p>
      <p>He buried the bodies in a shallow grave in his backyard and left on a bicycle with Zelaya’s head. He brought Zelaya’s head to a walking trail near AT&amp;T Stadium in Arlington, where he left it alongside a sign that threatened more violence, <a href="https://dfw.cbslocal.com/2019/11/13/cartel-killer-hector-acosta-sentenced-to-death-in-shooting-beheading-of-arlington-roommate/">KTVT-TV</a> reported.</p>

      <p>“He is extraordinarily violent,” lead prosecutor Kevin Rousseau told the jury in closing arguments. “He deals in terror. It’s his job.”</p>
      <p>Prosecutors said Acosta-Ojeda called the killings retribution for a past drive-by shooting he believed Zelaya participated in.</p>

      <p>Defense attorneys had asked for a life sentence, saying Acosta-Ojeda grew up surrounded by violence and a brain injury may have affected him.</p>
      <p>“Some people can get better,” prosecutor Tim Rodgers said. “Some are just bad.”</p>

      <p>The jury deliberated for just over four hours before handing down the sentence, the station reported. If the jury couldn’t agree on death, Acosta-Ojeda would have received a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment without parole.</p>
