      <p><b>Nike Will No Longer Sell Directly to Amazon (<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/13/nike-wont-sell-directly-to-amazon-anymore.html">CNBC</a>)</b><br/>In an effort to sell to customers online directly, Nike will no longer sell wholesale goods to Amazon. “As part of Nike’s focus on elevating consumer experiences through more direct, personal relationships, we have made the decision to complete our current pilot with Amazon Retail,” a spokeswoman told CNBC. “We will continue to invest in strong, distinctive partnerships for Nike with other retailers and platforms to seamlessly serve our consumers globally.” The athletic brand originally partnered with the e-commerce giant in 2017. In exchange for Amazon being stricter on counterfeits and “unsanctioned sales of its products,” Nike sold products directly to Amazon.</p>
