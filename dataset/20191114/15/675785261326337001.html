      <p>Thugs stamped on an innocent dad's face so hard that he lost almost all his teeth in an unprovoked attack.</p>
      <p>Paul Capel has released images that show the horrific facial injuries he suffered in the hope that it will help to catch the violent pair who attacked him.</p>
      <p>The 47-year-old told the <a href="https://www.hertfordshiremercury.co.uk/news/hertfordshire-news/father-speaks-out-after-suffering-3531060">Hertfordshire Mercury</a> : “I’ve got hairline fractures to my face and I’ve next to no teeth left because they stamped them out. There was no gain they got nothing out of this.”</p>
      <p>The night worker and his wife were walking in Ware, Hertfordshire, when they were confronted by the pair who become aggressive to the couple.</p>
      <p>Mr Capel said despite telling the men to stop they “taunted” him.</p>
      <p>He said: “When we get to the end of the church path they made a beeline to attack my wife, I pulled her backwards and stood in front,” he explained.</p>

      <p>“I don’t remember the rest. They went past me to get to her.</p>
      <p>“From what I gather, my wife said it was all a bit frenzied but she remembers being spun around and some lady shouting, that startled them and they ran off.</p>
      <p>“I don’t recall anything from the point at the end of the path to being in the hospital - I don’t recall any of that in between time.”</p>
      <p>Mr Capel was knocked to the floor and suffered serious facial injuries including fractures and cuts.</p>

      <p>Since the attack on November 3, he has been inundated with support from the disgusted community.</p>
      <p>“It’s crazy - I’ve been made famous for the wrong reasons in many respects,” he said.</p>
      <p>“I get people coming up to me in Tesco which is nice, I’d rather people talk to me than stare at me.</p>
      <p>“It feels intimidating and I hate people staring, I think it’s rude but in general, people are very supportive and very understanding.</p>

      <p>“I’m shocked more than anything, it’s only a small town. Everyone says I can’t believe this has happened in Ware.”</p>
      <p>Mr Capel said he is now wary to go out after dark, adding: “I tend to be looking over my shoulder which I wouldn’t normally be.”</p>
      <p>But given the same situation again, he said he would “100 per cent” step in to protect his family.</p>
      <p>He said: “If someone ever goes for my family, I’d step in. One hundred per cent I’d do the same again because they are my world.”</p>

      <p>The attack happened hours after Mr Capel had enjoyed a family get together to celebrate the upcoming Bonfire Night.</p>
      <p>He is unable to remember descriptions of the men but described them as English and as having “no build about them”.</p>
      <p>Police describe the suspects as white men, aged in their late 20s to early 30s.</p>

      <p>“I am appealing for anyone with information about what happened to please get in touch. Did you witness two men acting suspiciously in the area around the time?</p>
      <p>“I am particularly keen to hear from the member of the public who shouted at the men.</p>
      <p>“If this was you, please get in touch.”</p>
