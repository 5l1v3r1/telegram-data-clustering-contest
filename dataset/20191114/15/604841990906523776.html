      <p>Former Dunshaughlin footballer Fearghal Delaney has added the 'Player of the Year' award he won for his Sydney-based Gaelic football club Young Ireland to a regional All-Stars accolade he claimed Down Under only two weeks ago. </p>
      <p>Delaney, who is the son of well-known Meath GAA official Mairead Delaney, has been working in the Sydney area the past three years while playing Gaelic football for the Young Ireland club. </p>
      <p>Delaney has clearly put in a series of impressive, committed performances as he was voted the Young Ireland  'Player of the Year'. Only two weeks previously he was chosen on the All-Stars Gaelic football team that was selected following the New South Wales state games which were held in Brisbane recently. This is Delaney's second All-Stars award in three years. </p>
      <p>Delaney played under-age football for Dunshaughlin and Meath before he joined many other young Irish people in moving to Australia where he has carved out a new career putting in the infrastructure for a broadband in and around the Sydney area. </p>
      <p>As well as Gaelic football he also plays hurling for the Central Coast hurling team. </p>
      <p>He has also continued with his Gaelic footbabll career - and clearly with considerable success. </p>
