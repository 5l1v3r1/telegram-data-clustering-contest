      <p>The Frenchman was in charge of Ligue 1 side Monaco between October 2018 and January 2019, but only managed to win five of his 20 games in the club's hot seat.</p>
      <p>Before his nightmare spell at Monaco, he was an assistant coach to Roberto Martinez with Belgium, and was part of the coaching staff when the country finished in third spot at the 2018 FIFA World Cup.</p>
      <p>However, he has now been appointed as head coach of Major League Soccer side Montreal Impact, signing a two-year deal with an option to extend for another year, and will be hoping to replicate the success of his playing days in the MLS after finishing his career in the US.</p>
      <p>"It's an honour to coach the Montreal Impact and return to MLS," Henry, who holds a UEFA Pro Licence, told the Canadian club's official website.</p>
      <p>"It's a league I know well, in which I had some very nice moments. To be in Quebec, in Montreal, which has an enormous multicultural heritage, it's extraordinary. I've always kept an eye on the club and now I'm here."</p>

      <p>Montreal Impact sporting director Oliver Renard revealed his delight at securing the Frenchman's signature.</p>
      <p>"We are extremely happy with the arrival of Thierry Henry," he said.</p>
      <p>"Young and dynamic, he's very familiar with MLS and meets the qualities we were looking for in our search. This nomination, two months before the start of camp in January, will give us a chance to build our squad with the man that will lead it."</p>
