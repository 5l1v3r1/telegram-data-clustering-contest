      <h1>Cambuslang man ends up in court after being viciously attacked by his dog</h1>
      <h2>Allan Forsyth was pounced upon by his Johnson American Bulldog, and suffered multiple bites to his body and leg</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T15:02:29+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 15:02</time> by <a rel="author">Rutherglen Reformer, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/rutherglen-reformer/</a></address>
      <p>A Cambuslang man who was viciously attacked by his own dog ended up in the dock last week.</p>
      <p>Allan Forsyth, 30 was pounced upon by Bronson, his Johnson American Bulldog in April this year, and suffered multiple bites to his body and calf.</p>
      <p>He was charged under the dangerous dogs act of being the owner of the dog which attacked him to his severe injury at his former home in Rutherglen.</p>
      <p>Forsyth admitted the charge at Glasgow Sheriff Court last Thursday, which could result in Bronson being put down.</p>
      <p>Sheriff Alan Findlay has ordered a report on Bronson by an animal expert to see if it is a danger to the public.</p>
      <p>The court heard that Bronson mauled Forsyth after he allegedly annoyed it in the early hours of the morning.</p>
      <p>The court heard police were contacted at 2.45am by Forysth’s partner.</p>
      <p>When they arrived they found four dogs outside of the house and Forysth on the couch with “significant” leg and arm injuries.</p>
      <p>Prosecutor Louise McNeill said: “Officers were told by Forsyth’s partner that he had been drinking and was antagonising the dog.</p>
      <p>“She said Bronson lashed out and bit him several times repeatedly on the body.”</p>
      <p>The court heard that one of the other dogs saved Forsyth from more serious injury by attacking Bronson.</p>
      <p>Ms McNeill added: “One of the female dogs began to attack Bronson which caused him to lose his grip.”</p>
      <p>All four dogs were taken to police kennels by the officers where they have remained since the incident.</p>
      <p>The Dangerous Dogs Act was introduced in the UK in 1991 to prohibit people from having types of dogs bred for fighting, and to ensure that dogs are kept under proper control in order to protect the public.</p>
      <p>It is open to the sheriff to have Bronson destroyed for the attack.</p>
      <p>However, Sheriff Findlay replied: “It seems a bit unfair on Bronson if he has been harassed.”</p>
      <p>He deferred sentence on Forsyth for background reports and a report on Bronson.</p>
      <p>Sheriff Findlay will also determine whether Forsyth should be banned from owning animals.</p>
      <p>Forsyth, now living in Cambuslang, has been bailed meantime.</p>
