      <p><b>CONCORD, N.H.Â (AP)</b> - Former Illinois congressman Joe Walsh has filed for the New Hampshire presidential primary, officially giving President Donald Trump two major Republican primary challengers in the early voting state.</p>
      <p>Walsh has centered his longshot bid squarely on Trump. He's become a vocal critic of the president, saying Trump is unfit for the office.</p>
      <p>Former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld has also filed to challenge Trump in the New Hampshire primary.</p>
      <p>Both Walsh and Weld have struggled so far to have largescale fundraising success. Another would-be primary challenger, former South Carolina governor and congressman Mark Sanford, dropped his bid Tuesday.</p>
