      <p><b>PROVIDENCE, R.I.Â (AP)</b> - Students at Rhode Island's three state colleges could be paying more in tuition next fall following a vote by state education officials.</p>
      <p>WJAR-TV reports the proposal would boost tuition $438 per year at the University of Rhode Island for in-state students; $681 a year for in-state students at Rhode Island College; and $160 a year for in-state students at the Community College of Rhode Island.</p>
      <p>The Office of Post-Secondary Education says the hikes are needed to help meet Gov. Gina Raimondo's goal of having 70% of Rhode Islanders earn a post-secondary degree or certificate by 2025.</p>
      <p>The proposed hikes will be reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget and the governor may then submit them as part of her upcoming budget.</p>
      <p>Raimondo has said she opposes tuition hikes.</p>
