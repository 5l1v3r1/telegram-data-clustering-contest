      <h1>Notts manager Neal Ardley forced to halt training as rain batters Midlands</h1>
      <h2>Magpies session ended early as county issued with flood alerts</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T15:56:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 15:56</time> by <a rel="author">Leigh Curtis</a></address>
      <p>Neal Ardley revealed how he had to call a halt to Notts County’s training session ahead of their clash against Barrow as the deluge of rain continues to batter the East Midlands.</p>
      <p>Heavy downpours have left roads under water while flood warnings are also in place with forecasts predicting more downpours over the next 12 hours.</p>
      <p>With <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/notts-county-fc">Notts</a> now at their new training bases at Holme Road, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/neal-ardley">Ardley</a> said training hasn’t been too badly affected by the weather which has seen rivers burst their banks.</p>
      <p>But he said that he had no option to end his session early on Thursday morning due to standing water that made it impossible to pass the ball in certain areas.</p>

      <p>“It’s funny because when we were at the university earlier in the season we were crying out for rain because the pitches were dry,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Since we’ve moved over the road and the pitches aren’t as dry, it’s not stopped raining.</p>
      <p>“It was a tough morning. To be fair the ground staff have worked very hard on the pitches at the new base, and while they’ve been heavy, we’ve been able to get training sessions on.</p>
      <p>“Today the pitches were usable at 11am but then we got 25 minutes in and there were puddles everywhere.</p>
      <p>“You couldn't pass the ball from A to B. We had to call it a day early.</p>
      <p>“We got through the analysis and then we managed half-an-hour so we got something out of it.”</p>
