      <p>Presenter <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/holly-willoughby/">Holly Willoughby</a> was awkwardly told off by a doctor on <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/daytime-tv/this-morning/">This Morning</a> for using the word "miracle".</p>
      <p>The star, 38, and her co-host <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/phillip-schofield/">Phillip Schofield</a>, 57, were joined on today's (14.11.19) programme by Alex Lewis - a man who lost part of his face and all four limbs after contracting a flesh-eating disease in 2014.</p>
      <p>Alex was on to talk about his recent climb up Ras Dashen, the highest peak in Ethiopia and one of the largest mountains in Africa.</p>
      <p>With him was Dr Geoff Watson, who was on to talk about the disease that changed Alex's life.</p>

      <p>He said on the programme: "When I actually first laid eyes on [Alex], he was in bed on a ventilator, on a dialysis machine with multiple pumps running life-saving drugs, keeping his blood pressure up, trying to keep blood flow to the vital organs.</p>
      <p>"But he didn't look like he had a lot of chance of surviving."</p>
      <p>Holly responded: "We talk about miracles, but him being here and doing what he has gone on to achieve is somewhat... something of a complete miracle..."</p>
      <aside>Holly's been very quiet since that doctor told her off.</aside>
      <p>But Geoff interrupted her and said: "Yeah, I don't use the phrase miracle, I am supposed to be a scientist. But yeah... kind of."</p>
      <p>An awkward silence ensued before Geoff pressed on: "You can't predict who is going to survive these things and we certainly would've predicted that Alex wouldn't have."</p>

      <p>Speaking further, Geoff said doctors gave Alex "little chance of survival" and his family were, at one point, told they could come in and "say goodbye".</p>
      <p>A number of viewers on Twitter thought the awkward moment had been felt so keenly it affected Holly's demeanour for the rest of the episode.</p>
      <p>One said: "Holly has been on poor form today - she is still fuming after being told off by that doctor lol #thismorning."</p>
      <p>Another tweeted: "Holly's been very quiet since that doctor told her off for being unscientific and saying 'miracle'.</p>
