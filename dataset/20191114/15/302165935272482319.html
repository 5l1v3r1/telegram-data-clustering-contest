      <p>BEIJING, Nov 14 — The unrest in Hong Kong has “seriously challenged” the “one country, two systems” principle governing the semi-autonomous city, China’s President Xi Jinping said today in comments reported by Chinese state media.</p>
      <p>Pro-democracy protesters choked the city with barricades and rallies for a fourth straight day today, days after police shot a protester with a live round and a man expressing pro-Beijing views was set on fire.</p>
      <p>Xi said Beijing “firmly supports” Hong Kong’s government and police and that “stopping violence and controlling chaos while restoring order is currently Hong Kong’s most urgent task,” the <i>People’s Daily</i> reported.</p>
      <p>Recent actions by protesters have “seriously challenged the baseline principle of ‘one country, two systems’”, Xi said in rare comments on the violence in Hong Kong at a summit of BRICS countries in the Brazilian capital of Brasilia.</p>
      <p>Protests have rocked Hong Kong for nearly six months.</p>
      <p>Initially focused on opposition to a proposed extradition law, protestors’ demands have evolved into broader calls for democracy and investigations into police violence.</p>
      <p>Hong Kong was handed back to China by the British in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” policy which gives the territory rights unseen on the mainland — freedoms protesters say are being steadily eroded by Beijing.</p>
      <p>Clashes between protestors and police escalated after the recent death of a student who succumbed to head injuries sustained during a fall as police skirmished with demonstrators inside a car park. — AFP</p>
