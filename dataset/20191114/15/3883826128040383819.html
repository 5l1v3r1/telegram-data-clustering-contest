        <b>If you fancy your chances as a politician, you have now sadly missed the deadline to register as a candidate in this general election.</b>
      </p>
      <p>But here are the rules on who can stand and who decides which candidates voters choose from.</p>
      <h3>What is a parliamentary candidate?</h3>
      <p>People who want to become a Member of Parliament (MP) are known as a parliamentary candidate, or a prospective parliamentary candidate.</p>
      <p>They are usually chosen by a political party - groups of people with similar beliefs who come together to try to win power.</p>
      <p>A small number of candidates do not represent a party but stand alone as independents.</p>
      <p>The candidates compete against one another for votes in one of the UK's 650 voting areas, or constituencies.</p>
      <p>Whoever wins the most votes in a particular constituency is elected as an MP.</p>
      <h3>Can anyone become an MP?</h3>
      <p>Almost anyone can put themselves forward as an MP, which can lead to a crowded field. In one poll in 2008, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7501046.stm">no fewer than 26 candidates stood</a> for election - many of them as independents.</p>
      <p>Candidates must be at least 18 years old, a British citizen, or a qualifying citizen of the Commonwealth or Republic of Ireland who is resident in the UK.</p>
      <p>Certain groups of people are not allowed to stand. For example, prisoners, members of the police and armed forces and judges are excluded.</p>
      <p>To be on the ballot paper - which voters use to make their choice - candidates must complete nomination forms.</p>
      <p>They also have to pay a £500 deposit, which is returned to them if they win at least 5% of the votes cast.</p>

      <h3>What happens after the deadline for nominations?</h3>
      <p>The names of the nominated candidates will appear on the ballot paper and they cannot decide to withdraw.</p>
      <p>However, if a candidate of one of the registered parties dies, the election in their constituency is postponed. This <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/election_2010/england/8638371.stm">last happened in the 2010 general election</a>.</p>

      <h3>How do parties select their candidates?</h3>
      <p>The parties normally have plenty of time to select candidates for an election. All parties currently represented in the UK Parliament follow similar procedures.</p>
      <p>First of all, to be nominated, you have to be a party member for a certain period of time, which varies from three months to a year.</p>
      <p>Then there are application forms and assessments, with questions about life and political experiences and career.</p>
      <p>The parties then draw up centrally approved lists of candidates, which are then put to the local party members for a final decision.</p>

      <h3>What is emergency selection?</h3>
      <p>More than 70 MPs are stepping down at this election and it will not be possible to replace all of them using the parties' usual procedures.</p>
      <p>This is because there is so little time to make the decision on new parliamentary candidates before the election takes place.</p>
      <p>The parties' ruling bodies, composed of senior figures, are involved in making decisions about who should stand.</p>
      <h3>Are UK parliamentary candidates representative of the UK population?</h3>
      <p>In recent years, all major political parties have changed the way they choose their candidates, to improve the diversity of MPs.</p>
      <p>Some have introduced gender quotas, all-women shortlists, or lists of preferred candidates from minority backgrounds.</p>
      <p>Although the 2017 Parliament <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2017-40232272">was the most diverse yet,</a> it was still not representative of the UK population.</p>
      <p>For example, only 32% of MPs were female and just 8% were from ethnic minorities - compared with 14% of the population of England and Wales as a whole.</p>
