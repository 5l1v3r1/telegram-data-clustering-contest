      <h1>Nawaz Sharif shall return if he goes abroad: Khawaja Asif</h1>

      <p>ISLAMABAD (Dunya News) – Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leader Khawaja Asif Thursday said former prime minister Nawaz Sharif shall return to Pakistan if he goes abroad for medical treatment.</p>
      <p>The PML-N leader addressed the National Assembly and maintained that Nawaz Sharif is fighting for his life at the moment and he should not be put at stake.</p>
      <p>“The government will be held accountable here and hereafter if it creates hurdles in the PML-N supreme leader’s treatment.</p>
      <p>“Nawaz Sharif has been given relief by the courts. He does not want to leave Pakistan and has only agreed after being insisted by his mother and other family members.</p>
      <p>“Doctors have stated that no further treatment of the PML-N supremo is possible in Pakistan owing to lack of technology, and recommended Nawaz Sharif to go to Houston where all facilities are available under one roof.</p>
      <p>“The most valuable asset of a politician is his politics, and Nawaz’s politics belongs to Pakistan. The incumbent leaders desperately want to take political revenge and everyone witnessed how the process of legislation was mocked a few days ago.</p>
      <p>“The statements of Law Minister Farogh Naseem were different for former president General (retd) Pervez Musharraf and Nawaz Sharif.</p>
      <p>“It was said in Washington that facilities of air conditioner and fridge will be taken away [from Nawaz Sharif]. A prime minister should not give such remarks which are below his designation.</p>
      <p>“We are here as guarantors of Nawaz Sharif. Let him leave, I swear he shall come back.”</p>
