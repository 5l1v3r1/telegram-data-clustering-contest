      <p>"We expect clear condemnation of the instigators, not a message calling for both sides to act with restraint," Danon added.</p>
      <p>"It's time for the international community to understand that its silence is a prize for terror."</p>
      <p>There were more than a few international messages of support for Israel, in no small part thanks to the ceaseless campaign by Israeli diplomats.</p>

      <p>Many Jewish organizations around the world also expressed support for Israel while condemning the rocket fire from Gaza.</p>
      <p>U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman criticized the rocket fire on Israel, saying the Jewish state had a right to self-defense.</p>
      <p>"Palestinian Islamic Jihad, an Islamist terrorist org backed by Iran, is again attacking Israel with 100’s of missiles aimed at civilians.

      <p>Avi Berkowitz, Trump's incoming peace envoy to the Middle East said: "We fully support our partner &amp; ally Israel in their fight against terrorism and the terrorist group, Palestinian Islamic Jihad.</p>
      <p>The Administration strongly condemns the barrage of rockets on Israeli civilians and continues to monitor the situation. It’s clear that the main obstacles holding Gazans back are Hamas and the Islamic Jihad who put violence ahead of bettering the lives of the people of Gaza.”</p>
