      <p>London - Scotland's <b>Catriona Matthew</b> will again captain <b>Europe </b>for the <b>2021 Solheim Cup</b>, the Ladies European Tour announced on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Matthew successfully led her side to a thrilling 14.5-13.5 victory over the United States in September.</p>
      <p>She will attempt to become Europe's first multiple Solheim Cup winning captain at Inverness Club in Toledo, Ohio, in two years' time.</p>
      <p>"Winning the Solheim Cup in Scotland was a dream come true, but backing that up with a win in America would be even better," said Matthew.</p>
      <p>"It's always harder to win on US soil, but I'm honoured to be tasked with the mission.</p>
      <p>"I was lucky enough to be part of the first European team to win on US soil at Colorado Golf Club in 2013 and so know what's possible."</p>
      <p>Matthew made her Solheim Cup debut in 1998 and played for Europe nine times in the competition, winning it three times in 2003, 2011 and 2013.</p>
