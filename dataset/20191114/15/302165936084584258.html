      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 14 — Non-traditional security threats were among the things that were discussed in the Malaysia-Indonesia bilateral meeting in conjunction with the official visit of Indonesian Defence Minister Prabowo Subianto to the country.</p>
      <p>Defence Minister Mohamad Sabu said both sides also exchanged views on the dynamic aspects of the global security landscape.</p>
      <p>“Another matter discussed was the threat of terrorism which has become the focus of the two countries,” he told a press conference after receiving a visit from Prabowo at Wisma Perwira here today.</p>
      <p>He said with the existing 62-year diplomatic ties, Malaysia had always regarded Indonesia as the closest and important neighbour.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Prabowo expressed confidence that Malaysia and Indonesia would forge various new areas of defence cooperation in the future.</p>
      <p>“I believe that our defence relationship is improving...we share the same views and will look for new areas of defence cooperation such as in the defence technical industry,” he said.</p>
      <p>Prabowo’s two-day visit to Malaysia is his first after being appointed Indonesian Defence Minister on October 23. — Bernama</p>
