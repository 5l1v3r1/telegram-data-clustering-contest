      <p>Bedward, 24, of Norfolk Road, Erdington, was convicted of murder by a jury at Birmingham Crown Court this afternoon, Thursday, November 14.</p>

      <p>Police later found the Golf parked in Stonechat Drive. It had a laundry bag bearing the initials KB in the boot and a balaclava and gloves.</p>

      <p>Bedward was captured on CCTV walking away from the car with a female and later that day she bought a one-way ticket to Dubai from Manchester Airport.</p>
      <p>The defendant got on the flight and stayed there for ten days but was arrested on his return to the UK.</p>
