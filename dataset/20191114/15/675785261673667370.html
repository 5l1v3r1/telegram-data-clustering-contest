      <p>Video technology is “alive and kicking” after a crunch Premier League meeting on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Some clubs have been ready to scrap Video Assistant Referees (VAR) after a string of controversies since it was introduced in the summer.</p>
      <p>It was debated by the 20 clubs at a Premier League shareholders meeting in London on Thursday but it quickly emerged they are determined to stick with it and there will be no major changes midway through the season.</p>
      <p>PGMOL chief Mike Riley was in the meeting for more than three hours but the 20 clubs accepted despite it getting "fractious" at times as they have been unhappy with decisions and how VAR has worked.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> co-chairman David Gold said: “No significant change, There’s not going to be any significant change. There is going to be an investigation. What I can say is that VAR is alive and kicking.</p>
      <p>“There was a lot of debate. We are making good progress. This is a brand new system. We just have to be a bit more patient. We will get it right.”</p>
      <p>But Gold made it clear he is against the idea of using pitch side monitors which has been called for so referees can check their own decisions during games.</p>

      <p>Gold added: “I hate the idea. I hate the idea of a referee that has been running around for an hour having to run over to a pitch-side monitor. I’m absolutely against it.</p>
      <p>“Some don’t have that opinion. Some like the idea but personally I don’t think it’s supported.”</p>
      <p>Aston Villa chief executive Christian Purslow also stressed VAR “needs to improve.”</p>
