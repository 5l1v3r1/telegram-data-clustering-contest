      <p>She's had a pretty tough time of late so it's nice to see <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/meghan-markle/">Meghan Markle</a> smile.</p>
      <p>Fresh from the news that she and <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/prince-harry/">Prince Harry</a> <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/meghan-markle/harry-and-meghan-have-told-the-queen-they-wont-be-spending-archies-first-christmas-with-her/">wouldn't be spending baby Archie's first Christmas at Sandringham with the Queen</a>, the Sussex Royal Instagram account uploaded a new shot of Meghan.</p>
      <p>In the picture, the Duchess of Sussex is seen laughing as she takes part in a photoshoot to launch her Smart Works charity initiative.</p>

      <p>Sitting on the sidelines, it appears she is directing the shoot, or acting as something of a cheerleader to the women.</p>
      <p>The picture celebrated the fact that Smart Works dressed its 200th client with items from Meghan's SmartSet capsule collection.</p>

      <aside>Wonderful work Meghan. A lot of people around the world love you.</aside>
      <p>"Meghan actually gets things done. Royals shaking fingertips, cutting ribbons and digging up gardens is one thing, what I like is seeing one that is warm and makes a real difference in ordinary lives," said another.</p>
