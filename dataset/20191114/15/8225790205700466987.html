      <p>HONOLULU, Hawaii (HawaiiNewsNow) - Light winds and mostly dry weather will hold through Thursday.</p>

      <p>Starting Friday, a front will approach Kauai from the northwest.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, a weak surface trough will reach the Big Island from the east. This will bring increasing chances of showers over both Kauai and the Big Island on Friday.</p>
