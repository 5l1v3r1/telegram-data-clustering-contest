      <p>A$AP Twelvyy slowly released new music throughout the year but it appears as if it might be getting ready to drop a new project. The rapper released a handful of loose tracks. Some of them were freestyles, others were short singles, but overall, he's been testing out new sounds. The latest being "Spanglish," a brand new banger. With his voice pitched up and filtered, he delivers a <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/playboicarti/profile">Playboi Carti</a>-esque delivery as he banks on energy and adlibs over bars. He essentially flexes his very minimal Spanish speaking skills on the track over a cold, winded trap beat.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/asapmob/profile">A$AP Mob</a> recently announced the fourth annual Yams Day which happens on Jan. 17th at Brooklyn's Barclay Center. Pre-sale tickets already went on sale yesterday at 1 p.m. Tickets for the general public go on sale this Friday.</p>
