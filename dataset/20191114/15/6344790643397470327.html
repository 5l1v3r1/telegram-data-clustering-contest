      <p>Director<b> James Mangold</b>’s <b><i>Ford v Ferrari </i></b>is a film that I’ve been excited about seeing. I was already familiar with the story that it tells, and from what I saw in the trailers, it looked like it was going to make for a hell of a great film. Well, it was!</p>
      <p>I had the opportunity to see the film in a 4DX theater, which gives audiences a completely immersive movie-going experience. <i>Seeing Ford v Ferrari </i>in 4DX was quite a wild ride, especially with all of the racing scenes in the movie. Sitting in those moving seats with the wind blowing in your face gave it an extra boost of excitement.</p>
      <p>But you don’t need to see the movie in 4DX to enjoy this film! <i>Ford v Ferrari </i>is just an all-around incredible film that tells a great and classic underdog story! The film is set in 1966 and it tells the true story of how visionary American car designer Carroll Shelby (<b>Matt Damon</b>) and fearless British driver Ken Miles (<b>Christian Bale</b>) came together to build a race car for the Ford Motor Company that could beat Ferrari at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in France in 1966.</p>
      <p>This was not an easy task, and it was one that many people thought would be impossible. But through all of the drama, company politics, and chaos that Shelby and Miles had to go through, they ended up building a car that would give Ferrari a run for their money.</p>
      <p>It’s an incredibly thrilling and exhilarating movie, and Matt Damon and Christian Bale both give wonderfully fantastic performances. They perfectly brought Shelby and Miles to life in the most enjoyable ways, especially in how they handled their larger than life personalities. All of the performances in this film were top-notch, but it’s the story of these two misfit characters that really grabs you and pulls you in.</p>
      <p>On top of all that, the movie also delivers some great, edge-of-your-seat racing action. These scenes thrust the audience right into the action, and the way they play out is absolutely electrifying.</p>
      <p>The movie also stars <b>Jon Bernthal</b>, <b>Caitriona Balfe, Tracy Letts, Josh Lucas, Noah Jupe, Remo Girone,</b> and <b>Ray McKinnon</b>.</p>
      <p><i>Ford v Ferrari</i> is one of the best films of the year, and it’s one that you’ve definitely got to see on the big screen!</p>
