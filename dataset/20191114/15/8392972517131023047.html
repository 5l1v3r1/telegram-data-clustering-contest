      <p>Although Nate had the affair to ruin Cain's life as he believed he rejected him before he was born, <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/emmerdale-viewers-question-how-faith-knew-about-nate-and-cara/">Cain's mother Faith revealed Cain had no idea about his son</a>.</p>

      <p>But in Tuesday night's episode (November 12 2019), Nate became Charity's hero when he managed to bring her son Moses home.</p>
      <p>Moses had been kidnapped after getting caught up in Cain and Aaron's car theft and war with <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/emmerdale-newcomer-sean-used-to-be-in-coronation-street/">Sean</a>.</p>
      <p>Despite Cain and Aaron trying to get the little boy back, they had no luck and returned home without him.</p>
