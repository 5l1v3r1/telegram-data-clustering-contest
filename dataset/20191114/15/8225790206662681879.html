      <p>HONOLULU (AP) - Maui Forest Bird Recovery Project officials have announced the program will be halted after the deaths of nine endangered birds.</p>
      <p>Scientists say the decision to suspend the project at Haleakala National Park on Maui came after at least nine of 13 kiwikiu apparently succumbed to avian malaria.</p>
      <p>The birds also known as the Maui parrotbill were transported to the Nakula Natural Area Reserve in Haleakala in hopes they would breed.</p>
      <p>Officials say five captive and four wild birds died within a few weeks of their transfer to Nakula, some before they were released. Another bird was missing.</p>
      <p>The kiwikiu is a yellow and olive-green Hawaiian honeycreeper with an estimated remaining population of up to about 300 birds.</p>
      <p>Officials say they are hopeful for the survival of the programâ€™s remaining birds.</p>
