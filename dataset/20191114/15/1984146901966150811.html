      <p>The North East had an early taste of winter this week as temperatures plummeted.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday morning, drivers in parts of the region woke to find their car windscreen iced over.</p>
      <p>However, one man might have just made that morning task a lot easier after he coming up with a genius way of doing it.</p>
      <p>Daniel Harris shared his idea on social media and people are loving it.</p>
      <p>Remember, using hot water on your frozen windscreen can cause it to crack. Here is our guide to how to <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/how-to-deice-car-windscreen-12256768">de-ice your car without breaking the law.</a></p>
      <p>So instead of using a can of de-icer and a scraper, Daniel fills a sandwich bag with warm water.</p>
      <p>He then simply drags it over the windows and watches the ice melt immediately.</p>
      <p>He wrote: "Hot water in a food bag and bam you've got a de-icer and a hand warmer. Works a treat, and it's fast!"</p>
      <p>He added: "I used warm tap water so I could safely hold it and lower the risk of cracking my screen.</p>
      <p>"The de-icer cans are so cold in the morning and this way keeps you nice and toasty. Oh and yes it was ice not condensation.</p>
      <p>"I know it looks it but try it and you won't be disappointed."</p>
