      <p>Back in 2016 it was the only year since in the hybrid era that a World Championship was not won by Hamilton after teammate Nico Rosberg pipped the Brit to the title by five points, retiring from Formula 1 five days later, opening up the seat to Bottas.<br/> <br/>The Finn has produced one of his best seasons yet for the Silver Arrows, winning four races and guaranteeing himself a second-place finish but is still focused on becoming World Champion.<br/> <br/><i>“[To be] very honest. Already bored about that question because every driver is individual,” </i>said Bottas when asking if he was going to be more aggressive or political to Hamilton.<br/><i> </i><br/><i>“I’m me, I’m not Nico.</i><br/><i> </i><br/><i>“For sure I always have plans finding how I want to achieve my goal which is ultimately the championship that requires me to beat my teammate but also many other drivers.”</i><br/> <br/>The Finn knows that if he is performing well and consistently it can cause a bit of an upset on the other side of the garage, whilst fully knowing what that is like himself.<br/> <br/><i>“I’ve always preferred to do the talking on track,” </i>he added.<br/><i> </i><br/><i>“If I can keep up my performance and focus all my energy that I have into my own performance I think that is going to be the best bet for me.</i> <i>If I start wasting energy elsewhere it might take my mind off the driving and what really matters.</i><br/><i> </i><br/><i>“If I can then perform at the level I want to normally that tends to upset the other side of the garage a little bit.</i> <i>I know being on the other side as well it can lead to mistakes and so on.</i><br/><i> </i><br/><i>“I have a plan for next year and not really willing to share it, so we’ll find out."</i></p>
