We call upon the fans to come and fill up the stadium as we look for our first victory in this campaign. We need more 11 points to be fully assured of making it to the 2021 AFCON finals,” stated McKinstry.<br/> <br/>“We expected a very difficult game in Ouagadougou since Burkina Faso has one of the best home records in Africa. They have one loss and five draws out of the last 25 matches they have played at home. This shows how strong there. Picking a point is positive although we would have loved to win the match,” he added.<br/> <br/>Cranes fought for a precious away point during the goalless draw in the AFCON 2021 group B qualifier at the Stade Du 4 Aout in Ouagadougou on Wednesday night.<br/> <br/>Left-back Johnson Benson Ochaya had an early goal-line clearance before captain Denis Onyango made point-blank saves to keep the national side in contention.<br/> <br/>Abdul Lumala, Farouk Miya, Emmanuel Arnold Okwi and Patrick Henry Kaddu all came close to the opponents' box which had a solid backline.<br/> <br/>Cranes had the best scoring moment when Okwi headed onto the crossbar a curling corner kick by Miya in the second half.<br/> <br/>The national side who returned in the country today will now shift their attention Malawi this weekend in their first game at home.<br/> <br/><b>Uganda Cranes XI:<br/></b> <br/>Denis Onyango (GK, Captain), Bevis Mugabi (Nico Wakiro Wadada), Joseph Benson Ochaya, Timothy Denis Awany, Murushid Juuko, Khalid Aucho, Mike Azira, Faruku Miya (Alexis Bbakka),Emmanuel Arnold Okwi, Abdul Lumala, Henry Patrick Kaddu (Isaac Muleme)<br/> <br/>Subs Not Used: Robert Odongkara (GK),Charles Lukwago (GK),  Hassan Wasswa, Halid Lwaliwa,Taddeo Lwanga, William Kizito, Allan Kyambadde, Fahad Bayo, Allan Okello</p>
