      <p>A woman’s panicked decision to cover up an accidental killing spirals out of control when her conscience demands she return the dead man’s body to his family.</p>
      <p>Bloody Disgusting has learned that Vertical Entertainment has acquired <b><i>Blood On Her Name</i></b>, the feature debut from <b>Mathew Pope</b>, out of the ongoing AFM. It will release on VOD platforms in 2020.</p>
      <p>In the film, the dead body lies at her feet, its blood still draining onto the floor. It was an accident, borne of self defense, but its discovery could have devastating consequences for local garage owner Leigh Tiller (<b>Bethany Anne Lind</b>) and her son. In a panic, Leigh decides to conceal the crime, cleaning the bloody scene and scrambling to dispose of the body.</p>
      <p>But can she actually disappear a man from the earth— from his family— leaving them forever wondering? As Leigh is torn between her primal instincts and tortured conscience she struggles to keep her sins hidden from her estranged father– a cop with a long history of moral compromise (<b>Will Patton</b>)– and from the keen-eyed girlfriend of the deceased (<b>Elisabeth Rohm</b>).</p>
      <p><i>Blood On Her Name</i> is a character-driven thriller that explores questions of guilt, moral identity, and the irrevocability of choices in the direst circumstances.</p>
      <p>The Southern Gothic Neo-Noir World Premiered July 17th at the Fantasia International Film Festival in Montreal, Canada.</p>
