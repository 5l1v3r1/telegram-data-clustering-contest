      <p>Claims that two senior members of staff employed by Stagecoach are currently on leave as result of an investigation into last month’s double decker bus crash have not been confirmed.</p>
      <p>More than 50 passengers and the driver of a bus travelling along the A385 between Totnes and Paignton were injured on Saturday, October 5, when it overturned in a field.</p>
      <p>The major emergency services rescue operation included more than 140 police officers, paramedics and firefighters. Of those injured, 37 needed treatment at five different hospitals.</p>
      <p>Last month, a transport union official told Devon Live the driver of the Stagecoach Gold double-decker bus was 19 years old and claimed he only passed his passenger carrying vehicle (PCV) driving test in July this year.</p>

      <p>He added it was the first time he had driven the route.</p>
      <p>The Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) has confirmed it is working alongside the police to carry out an investigation into the incident.</p>
      <p>The DVSA has the power to carry out vehicle examinations, scrutinise maintenance and driver daily defect reports and request the production of drivers’ hours records, time sheets, fuel receipts and clocking in/out records.</p>
      <p>If any compliance issues are identified, the licence holder and transport manager will probably be called to a public inquiry.</p>
      <p>A member of staff told Devon Live the chief operations officer for Stagecoach nationally, Mark Threapleton, attended a meeting with a senior member of staff in Exeter on October 31.</p>
      <p>They said: "He has not been seen in the Exeter office since November."</p>
      <p>Another employee also confirmed the absence and said another senior member of staff has also not returned to work since.</p>

      <p>Stagecoach said it would not comment specifically on any of its employees, but confirmed the two senior member of staff named to Devon Live are still employed by Stagecoach. </p>
      <p>A spokeswoman said: “They continue to be employed by and work for Stagecoach South West.”</p>
      <p>Police have confirmed the investigation and enquiries are still ongoing for this incident.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for the DVSA said: “We are working on an ongoing investigation being led by Devon and Cornwall Police, and as such cannot comment on progress.”</p>
