      <h2>Ruth Ruano defended her motherhood after being criticised for breastfeeding her newborn in a dugout while practising football for her team Sporting Son Ferrer</h2>

      <p>A footballer has vowed to continue breastfeeding her newborn baby at training - despite receiving huge criticism for it.</p>
      <p>Ruth Ruano was slammed after a picture of her feeding her two-month-old Julia in the dugout went viral.</p>
      <p>Ruth, from Son Ferrer, Mallorca in the Spanish Balearic Islands insisted that she had not done anything illegal but felt that most of the criticism came from men.</p>
      <p>She said: "Mostly men but also, there are females as well, that are [involved in the] controversy.</p>
      <p>"Because they, being mothers as well, I don't know, it's like a competition, so they're being better mothers than I am because I bring my child to this field."</p>

      <p>She says she enjoys the support of her fellow players who are more than willing to aid her with juggling motherhood and football.</p>
      <p>"They also help look after my baby. We're like a family," she explained.</p>
      <p>"During training, we can stop so I can breastfeed, or someone can come and help me out."</p>

      <p>De Futbol y otras Pasiones, a <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> account dedicated to football-related news, shared the video and wrote: "Ruth Ruano, a Sporting Son Ferrer player not only takes her daughter to training, she also has time to breastfeed her."</p>
      <p>Ruth, dressed in football jersey and shoes, said she is puzzled that people don't understand why she do that in public.</p>
      <p>She added: "I don't know why people don't understand that a mother or a woman go to do sport, and you can bring your baby with you if you can because I do breastfeeding.</p>
      <p>"I bring somebody who can look after her, otherwise, my team, my colleagues, my soccer players, they also [look after] my baby.</p>
      <p>"So we are like a family, so whenever I'm training, I can stop and do breastfeeding or somebody[who] has come can maybe help me out."</p>
