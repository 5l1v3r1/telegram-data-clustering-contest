      <p>LOS ANGELES, Nov 14 — A Nutella-themed hotel is set to open next year for diehard fans of the chocolate hazelnut spread. And it will be called: Hotella Nutella.</p>
      <p>For one weekend only, three winners and their travel companions will be flown to Napa, California to stay in a hotel with celebrity chefs and life-sized jars of the dessert spread.</p>
      <p>Peanut butter fans beware: Hotella Nutella will be chocolate and hazelnut-themed everything. That includes a Nutella-themed breakfast for dinner with celebrity chef Geoffrey Zakarian; a Southern-style brunch with Nutella; and a lesson in creating Instagram-friendly pancake art.</p>
      <p>In cities like New York and Chicago, fans can already get their fix at standalone Nutella Cafes, where croissants, puddings, pancakes and pound cakes are slathered in the sticky, chocolate spread.</p>
      <p>To enter the hotel contest, fans are asked to submit a video of 60 seconds or less about their “passion for Nutella and connection to breakfast.” The contest closes December 8 and is open to US residents only.</p>
      <p>Three winners and their travel companions will be flown to the pop-up hotel in California for a weekend stay January 10-12, 2020.</p>
