        <b>NEW DELHI (AP) — Schools in India’s capital are shut on Thursday and Friday after a thick gray haze of noxious air enveloped the city for the third consecutive day, and angry residents blamed authorities for holding an annual children’s race.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Buildings and monuments were largely obscured by smog and an official health advisory urged people to avoid all physical activity outdoors.</p>
      <p>The air quality index exceeded 460, nine times the level recommended by the World Health Organization, according to the state-run Central Pollution Control Board. In some places, the index crossed the 500 level.</p>
      <p>Still, hundreds of children took part Thursday in the annual “Run for Children” race organised by a nonprofit group called Prayas.</p>
      <p>Residents took to social media and blamed authorities for allowing the run after pictures were shared of children without protective masks.</p>
      <p>The event was organised to mark the birthday of India’s first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, which is celebrated as Children’s Day in India.</p>
      <p>“It was a symbolic event and children didn’t run beyond 200 meters,” organiser Amod K. Kanth told The Associated Press.</p>
      <p>Kanth said the organization had permission from the authorities and he was not directed to cancel the event.</p>
      <p>Many decried the rising pollution levels and said the government is not doing enough.</p>
