      <h1>Rawlings appeals for work to restart on Volta roads</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T15:30:24+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 15:30</time> by <a rel="author">Maxwell Awumah, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Ho, Nov. 14, GNA - Former President Jerry John Rawlings has appealed to the Minister of Roads and Highways to urgently instruct contractors working on the main road entering the Ho township to restart work.</p>
      <p>He noted that roads in some parts of the Region were in very deplorable states and needed urgent attention to prevent road crashes and other inconveniences road users faced.</p>
      <p>President Rawlings made the appeal when he signed the book of condolence for the late Victoria Adzagli Ametefee, wife of Mr Henry K. Ametefee, Volta Regional Chairman of the National Democratic Congress (NDC) in Ho.</p>
      <p>He also called for the Eastern Corridor segment to be given maximum attention to facilitate movement of goods and services.</p>
      <p>Former President Rawlings said the linkages between road infrastructure and economic growth could not be detached from each other and prayed that urgent attention be given to roads in the Region.</p>
      <p>He called for love in families, saying, “it was a wrong time to lose one's wife.”</p>
      <p>President Rawlings donated US$1,000 to the family and promised to be present at the burial and funeral service. </p>
      <p>Mr Ametefee said the presence of President Rawlings had assuaged his pain and hoped the whole NDC fraternity, political partners, family and friends would assist him to give a befitting burial to his wife.</p>
      <p>Reverend Samuel K. Dzamesi, Ho Central Pastor, Church of Christ and Proprietor of Sonrise Christian High School, on behalf of the bereaved family thanked President Rawlings for his presence to commiserate with them.</p>
      <p>Mr James Gunu, Regional Secretary, NDC, on behalf of the Party thanked the Founder of the NDC for showing leadership and empathising with the bereaved family.</p>
