      <p>The call for a classic cocktail can be hard to resist, but going out to bars gets pricey, and trying to combine the perfect amount of different juices, bitters, and liquors on your own is a tough skill to master. <a href="https://bartesian.com/products/the-bartesian">The Bartesian</a>, available on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bartesian-55300-Premium-Cocktail-Maker/dp/B07PJ5Q943/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=mf-bartesian-20&amp;linkId=e62551b4a9b4e8b485159555008b72d2&amp;language=en_US">Amazon for $350</a>, wants to take the hassle out of homemade cocktails by serving up classic drinks in just a few simple steps.</p>
      <p>To start, purchase the <a href="https://bartesian.com/collections/cocktails">cocktail capsules</a> of your choice, which contain all of the bitters, extracts, and juice concentrates you need for cocktails like old fashioneds, margaritas, martinis, Long Island iced teas, and more. Then, pour your preferred liquor—whiskey, vodka, rum, gin, and tequila—into one of the five glass bottles that comes with the Bartesian and screw it into its proper reservoir on the machine. (Vodka and gin occupy the same reservoir, so the machine will double-check that you're using the right one before making a drink with either.)</p>
      <p>Once you’re set up, simply insert the capsule and the Bartesian will instantly identify your cocktail selection and the spirit will be automatically drawn. You can even specify the strength of your cocktail, whether you want a mocktail or something strong after work. If you want to make the concoction even more authentic, the machine will also suggest the proper glassware for each.</p>

      <p>Bartesian provides an automatic rinse after each use, and the reservoirs are easily removed and dishwasher safe.</p>
      <p>So whether you're looking to gift yourself or the cocktail lover in your life this holiday season, the Bartesian makes mixed drinks easy.</p>
