      <p>When the super-sleek – and <a href="https://futurism.com/crypto-mining-machine-beautiful-utterly-pointless">super-divisive</a> – <a href="https://coindesk.com/tag/Coinmine">Coinmine</a> machine hit the crypto markets, people were at once impressed and annoyed.</p>
      <p>The device, looking like the love child between a monochromatic cyborg and an Xbox, was made to allow anyone to run a full node without the fuss of downloading an entire blockchain or even having to understand the command line.</p>
      <p>The device, which we <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/the-799-coinmine-one-will-look-like-an-xbox-and-mint-crypto-money">profiled here a year ago</a>, is now adding more tricks to its arsenal. First, the miner is $100 cheaper, down from $799, and the system now offers 6.5 percent APR on earnings held in Coinmine wallets.</p>
      <p>The goal? To get Coinmines into more (early-adopting) homes.</p>
      <p>“As more people purchase Coinmines, the better pricing we can get from our supply chain,” Coinmine CEO Farbood Nivi told CoinDesk in a video interview in New York. “Our philosophy is to make things better, faster, and cheaper.”</p>
      <p>The company doesn’t exactly want a miner in every home, although Nivi as said he wants to expand the market. Instead, he sees the device as a gateway into the world of crypto.</p>
      <p>“Crypto actually creates a single financial world for everyone in the world to live in,” he said. “I think you’ll have a ton more control over your actual wealth.”</p>
      <p>In this interview with CoinDesk’s Danny Nelson, Nivi talks about growth plans as well as the effects of recent tariffs on products manufactured in China.</p>
