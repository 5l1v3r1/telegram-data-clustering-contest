      <h1>Statistics South Africa: Decrease In Inequality For White, Indian, Asian People</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T15:05:13+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 15:05</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.iafrica.com/author/neelket/" target="_blank">NT Editor</a></address>
      <p>Statistics South Africa said there was a decrease in inequality for white, Indian and Asian people in South Africa but an increase for black people between 2006 and 2015.</p>
      <p>Statistician-General Risenga Maluleke released the inequality trends in South Africa on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The report is the first to be released in South Africa and is a multidimensional diagnostic of inequality in the country.</p>
      <p>It shows that some aspects of inequality have declined while others have increased over the past several years.</p>
      <p>“We should be able to unpack further and say the household expenditure share for black South Africans grew from 41.8% to 49.3% between 2006 and 2015,” Maluleke explained.</p>
      <p>He said research showed that labour market income was the main driver of income inequality in the country.</p>
      <p>Maluleke added while economic income increased for black South Africans, it remained constant for coloured people, while it decreased for Indian, Asian and white people.</p>
