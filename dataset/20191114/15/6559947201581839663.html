      <p>The headphone market continues to evolve and adapt. Whether you stick to traditional wired sets or embrace Bluetooth completely, there should be a deal for you.</p>
      <p>The best bargains can be found during the Black Friday weekend, but you should fully expect a wide range of other deals in the build up to the shopping event. Best sellers last year included half-price Sony, Beats, and AKG headphones, so definitely keeps an eye out for similar deals in 2019.</p>

      <h4>Where to shop on Black Friday</h4>
      <hr/>
      <p>In 2019, Black Friday will officially start on November 29, but that doesn't mean you won't find top headphone deals throughout the whole month.</p>
      <p>Predictably the biggest offers for the shopping event will run throughout the weekend and end on the Monday. Although deals can merge into Cyber Monday, and even beyond, as the two events are now basically the same thing.</p>
      <p>There will be a decent variety of retailers participating in the Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales this year. Many of the best deals can be found at Amazon, which normally stretches out its sales as long as possibly. UK bargain hunters should also keep an eye on the likes of John Lewis, Currys PC World, and Argos.</p>
      <p>While most of these retailers will be discounting items throughout November, it's worth addressing that these deals can alter and change as the month progresses.</p>
      <h4>What to expect on Black Friday</h4>
      <hr/>
      <p>Black Friday can be incredibly unpredictable, so its best to bookmark the relevant <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/deals/118221/black-friday-uk-the-best-deals-on-laptops-tvs-gaming-and-tech">PCMag</a> articles to make sure you're kept up to speed with all the brilliant deals that drop.</p>
      <p>With that being said, we can normally air a few predictions prior to the sales event, by looking at what sold well last year, where the focus was, and what products have been released since.</p>
      <p>As a given, older products that are surplus to requirements will almost always go on sale to make way for the more advanced models. The drop in price may convince some buyers to overlook the latest model in favour of a great deal, even if you get something a little outdated.</p>
      <p>With more phones starting to abandon the headphone jack, the wireless Bluetooth revolution is really starting to take shape. Although we are far away from all phones ditching the 3.5mm jack, a lot of mainstream devices have opted to remove it to create room for other innovations. Notably this applies to the <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/smartphones/122867/apple-iphone-11-pro">iPhone</a>, and <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/smartphones/122203/samsung-galaxy-note-10">most recently</a> the <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/news-analysis/121935/galaxy-note-10-dongle-leak-confirms-no-headphone-jack">Galaxy Note10</a>.</p>
      <p>With the increasing popularity of these headphones, we expect many to receive at least some kind of discount. The <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/headphones/120302/apple-airpods-2nd-generation">Apple AirPods</a> even got a 2019 update, so older models of the tiny ear-pods may prove popular, and cheap, come November.</p>
