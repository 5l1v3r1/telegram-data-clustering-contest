      <h1>TV crew will be at Nottingham Arts Theatre to film Miscarriages of Justice season</h1>
      <h2>There are three plays based on real life cases</h2>

      <p>The People's Theatre Company is presenting a trio of plays in its Miscarriages of Justice season at Nottingham Arts Theatre. Director Chris Teasdale explains why a TV production company will be filming one of the plays...</p>
      <h3>Why present a Miscarriages of Justice season?</h3>
      <p>In early January 2019, I watched a documentary about Patrick Maguire's life since his prison sentence. it highlighted how so many years later he still suffers the lasting effect of being wrongfully imprisoned. The documentary mentioned the book, My Father's Watch and that a play had been adapted. I read the book and then contacted John Dunne (writer), who gave us permission to perform the play for the first time outside of London.</p>
      <p>I then thought about other potential plays we could do in a week on the subject and soon came up with Example about Derek Bentley and Your Ever Loving, a play based on prison letters of Paul Hill, a member of the Guildford Four.</p>

      <p>I have had a longstanding interest in criminal history - I'm currently studying a criminology degree - and have spent time working in the prison service. I remember being interested in the Craig and Bentley case, as I lived near Croydon in south west London, and for years my film of choice was In The Name of the Father.</p>
      <p>Our justice system is one of the best, but it does have a history of major miscarriages of justice. These stories are uncomfortable to read and learn about, often, in years gone by, ending with the death of the defendant.</p>
      <h3>What are the plays about?</h3>

      <p><b>Example - </b>by Belgrade Coventry Theatre in Education Company. The play is based on the case and execution of Derek Bentley in 1953 for the murder of a police officer in a bungled attempted burglary. PC Miles was actually shot by Christopher Craig who was 16 years old. Christopher Craig and Derek Bentley were tried under the law of ‘Joint Enterprise’. Following conviction and the sentence of death given to Derek Bentley, there was a call to the home Secretary to commute this to a life sentence. Due to his age, Craig was given a life sentence. Derek Bentley was hanged at Wandsworth Prison on January 28, 1953. He eventually received a posthumous pardon in 1998, following years of campaigning by his family.</p>
      <p><b>Your Ever Loving - </b>by Martin McNamara. A play based on the bombing of two pubs in Guildford in 1974 which killed five people. Public outrage meant that pressure was on the police to catch and convict those held responsible. The government passed a new law to help with this - The Prevention of Terrorism Act. This play tells the story of Paul Hill, the first person to be held under the new Act and a member of the Guildford Four, who spent 15 years in prison before the convictions were quashed and he walked free. The play is based on letters he sent from the many prisons he was held in.</p>
      <p><b>My Father's Watch - </b>by Patrick Maguire II, adapted by John Dunne. A play devised from the book of the same name, written by Patrick Maguire, a member of the family labelled The Maguire Seven, alleged to be an IRA support group who built bombs in their suburban house in London. As a member of the ‘Seven’, Patrick was sentenced at the age of 14 to four years in prison and separated from his family for a crime he did not commit. A brutal and honest tale of how those days had a lasting effect on his own and others lives.</p>

      <h3>Why will a film crew be recording Example?</h3>
      <p>When I was researching the play, I contacted Maria Dingwall Bentley (Derek's niece) who has been very supportive. She was taking part in a documentary on the topic of 'Joint enterprise' being produced by 'Movement in media' and suggested they contact us. From this they are filming our production to use in their upcoming film on 'joint enterprise' the legal argument the Bentley case was based upon.</p>
      <h3>How did you go about casting for each play?</h3>
      <p>We have tried to use actors of similar ages to those in the plays, but two of the plays tell their story over a number of years (14 in one of them) so the character develops through the play. The group of actors fitted the characters I imagined them to be. They have taken the plays to heart and worked hard to tell the tragic and harrowing tales. We have both experienced and new actors . Many have multiple roles over the three plays.</p>

      <h3>How are they being presented?</h3>
      <p>Each play is done in the round with some acting on the small stage of the studio. This is designed to ensure the audience experience the difficult journeys of the characters as well as being close to the interrogations by the police.</p>
      <h3>How do you hope the audiences will react?</h3>
      <p>I hope the audiences will feel empathy towards the characters whilst experiencing the uncomfortable subject matter.</p>

      <h3>Anything else?</h3>
      <p>We are hoping to have a visit from both John Dunne (My Father's Watch) and Maria Dingwall Bentley (Example) to see the plays and conduct a Q&amp;A with the audience.</p>
