      <p>Now this is an awesome feel good story to start your day.</p>
      <p>The Comanche County Sheriff’s Department has some good karma coming their way after giving away around 200 turkeys to families for Thanksgiving. I had no idea, but this is an annual event that the Sheriff's Department does. <a href="https://www.kswo.com/2018/11/16/comanche-co-sheriffs-department-delivers-turkeys-area-families/">According to KSWO</a>, each year, the department collects names of families who may need a little extra help for the holiday and then they deliver turkeys to their door.</p>
      <p>“It’s pretty cool to be able to go out and help people, and it’s a big project that we put on every year, and the only way we do it is by people giving us the money to do it," said Sheriff Stradley. "The more people that will help each other, it’ll turn our world around, and possibly getting to respect each other -- and that’s the neat thing about this, just giving back and showing people care about you.”</p>
