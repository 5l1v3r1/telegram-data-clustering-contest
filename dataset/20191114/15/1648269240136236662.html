      <h1>Tesla Registers Cybertruck And CYBRTRK Names For Electric Pickup</h1>
      <h2>What else would it be for?</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T15:54:05+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 15:54</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.motor1.com/info/team/greg-fink/" target="_blank">Greg Fink</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.motor1.com/tesla/">Tesla</a>'s forthcoming <a href="https://www.motor1.com/body-styles/truck/">pickup truck</a> likely has a name. The automaker recently filed the trademarks for <a href="http://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=88682192&amp;caseType=SERIAL_NO&amp;searchType=statusSearch">Cybertruck</a> and <a href="http://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=88682748&amp;caseType=SERIAL_NO&amp;searchType=statusSearch">CYBRTRK</a> with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. The latter filing even includes a proposed logo design.</p>

      <p>Elon Musk has referred to Tesla's upcoming electric pickup truck as the Cybertruck on his personal <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1192113294036754432?lang=en">Twitter feed</a>. Combine that with these trademarks and it seems all-but assured the brand's upcoming model will bear some variation of this name.</p>
      <p>Of course, we'll know more on November 21st once the brand reveals its long-anticipated pickup truck in Los Angeles, California. The model will serve alongside the <a href="https://www.motor1.com/tesla/model-s/">Model S</a> and Model 3 sedans, <a href="https://www.motor1.com/tesla/model-x/">Model X </a> and Model Y crossover SUVs, and the forthcoming second-generation <a href="https://www.motor1.com/tesla/roadster/">Roadster</a> sports car. Like the Roadster, the Cybertruck (or CYBRTRK) seems set to forgo the brand's typical naming scheme, which includes the word "Model" followed by a letter or number. </p>

        <a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/377204/rivian-rv-concept-rendered/"/>

      <p>With <a href="https://www.motor1.com/ford/f-150/">the Ford F-150</a> serving as America's best-selling vehicle and EV competitors like Bollinger and Rivian entering the segment (not to mention Ford's own plans to release an <a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/368920/ford-f-150-electric-2021/">electric F-150</a>), Tesla is certainly eager to dip its proverbial toes in the profitable waters of the pickup segment. Whether the brand aims to target the masses with an F-150-like range of models and a reasonably affordable starting price or opts to follow in the footsteps of <a href="https://www.motor1.com/rivian/">Rivian</a> with a pricier luxury leaning offering remains up in the air. </p>
      <p>Regardless of what it's called, we're eager to see Tesla's pickup truck in the metal when it debuts next week in LA.</p>
