      <p>The constituency of Wells, which Boris Johnson visited on Thursday, is one of a number of seats across south-west England where the Conservatives are on the defence.</p>
      <p>Challenging them are the Liberal Democrats, who are hoping to make big gains in a region that was once their heartland.</p>
      <p>Wells was last held by the Lib Dems between 2010 and 2015, when the MP was Tessa Munt.</p>
      <p>She is standing again this time, and needs a 6.3% swing to take the seat from the Tories.</p>
      <p>Facing her is the Conservative candidate James Heappey, who won the seat from Ms Munt in 2015 and held it in 2017 – though his majority slipped from 7,585 to 6,582.</p>

      <p>As such, tactical voting could be a factor this time.</p>
      <p>Might some Labour supporters “lend” their vote to the Lib Dems, to increase the likelihood of a Tory defeat?</p>
      <p>Brexit may also have an impact.</p>
      <p>Both the Greens and the Brexit Party have stood down from the contest, to try to boost the chances of the Lib Dems and Conservatives respectively.</p>
      <p>The constituency covers a diverse area, from the city of Wells to the seaside town of Burnham-on-Sea, along with the site of the Glastonbury Festival.</p>
      <p>There is a diverse range of views within the seat as well.</p>
      <p>The constituency boundaries of Wells include parts of the local authorities of both Mendip and Sedgemoor.</p>
      <p>In the 2016 EU referendum, Mendip voted Remain while Sedgemoor voted Leave.</p>
      <p>If the Lib Dems manage to monopolise the Remain vote within the constituency, besides wooing a chunk of former Tory supporters, they might stand a good chance of winning.</p>
