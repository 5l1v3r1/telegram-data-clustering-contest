      <p>LA PAZ (Reuters) - Bolivian interim President Jeanine Anez said on Thursday former President Evo Morales will not be able to take part in upcoming elections because he is barred from running for a fourth consecutive term.</p>
      <p>Addressing a news conference, Anez added that Morales’ vice president, Alvaro Garcia, would also not be allowed to run for president.</p>
      <p>Both resigned after a damning audit on vote irregularities was released and a “suggestion” by the military to do so to end unrest after the disputed Oct. 20 election. Morales later went into exile in Mexico.</p>
      <p>Anez did not announce a new date for elections but under the constitution must call for them within 90 days of her taking office on Tuesday.</p>
