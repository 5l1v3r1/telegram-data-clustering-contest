      <p>Where have all the AR games gone? Oh, they're either region exclusive, in development, or named <i>Pokemon Go</i>.</p>
      <p>While I'm still waiting for the localization of <i>Yo-Kai Watch Go</i> and <i>Dragon Quest Go</i> (which is evidently doing very well in Japan), we're getting <i>Minecraft Earth</i> very soon. How soon? December soon! But for the time being, certain regions of the world can enjoy an Early Access event of sorts.</p>
      <p>The first events will be held on Saturday, November 16, in New York City (Hudson Yards - a shopping district), London (Queen's Walk - same idea along the River Thames) and Sydney (Campbell's Cove - a waterfront area near the Opera House). From there more events will pop up in those locations from November 23-24, then November 30-December 1 at 10AM-7PM local time.</p>
      <p>What happens after that? The global launch of <i>Minecraft Earth</i> sometime in December. Good luck if you happen to live in one of those locations!</p>
