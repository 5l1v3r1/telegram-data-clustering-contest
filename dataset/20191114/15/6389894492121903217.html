      <h1>General Election: Labour has 'close to zero' chance of majority, says pollster John Curtice</h1>

      <p>Labour has “close to zero” chance of securing a majority this election, according to one of the country’s foremost polling experts. </p>
      <p>Sir John Curtice today said the most likely outcome was either an outright Conservative victory or a hung parliament. But he noted that could still result in a Remain-led coalition and second referendum.</p>

      <p>However, a straight win for Jeremy Corbyn when Britain heads to the polls on 12 December is next to impossible.</p>
      <p>“The chances of the Labour party winning a majority are frankly as close to zero as one can safely say it to be given they look utterly incapable of regaining anything in Scotland,” he said.</p>
      <p>Curtice added that the election was “a pretty binary contest”. </p>
      <p>“Either Boris gets a majority and we’re leaving the EU on the terms he’s negotiating, or we get a hung parliament in which case we have to anticipate that a minority Labour administration which will apply for an extension and there will be a referendum, the result of which we do not know.”</p>

      <p>Labour’s policy on Brexit – which is to renegotiate a new deal with Brussels and hold another referendum next summer – has eroded their support, Curtice warned. </p>

      <p>“The problem the Labour party has is they’ve tried to satisfy everybody and have ended up satisfying nobody,” he said.</p>
      <p>Scottish polling expert professor Ailsa Henderson and Welsh expert professor Roger Awan-Scully backed that view. </p>
      <p>Speaking at the Institute for Government this morning, Henderson said while many voters were still undecided: “No one is moving to Labour – no one. </p>
      <p>“This is the consequence of having an on-the-fence policy… with no articulated vision on the constitution, and when it is articulated is immediately contradicted by London.”</p>

      </p>
      <p>A worst case scenario could see Labour lose all six seats in Scotland, she warned. At best, she estimated the party would retain Edinburgh South. </p>
      <p>Meanwhile in Wales, which voted to leave in 2016, Labour risks losing its position as the most dominant party for first time in over 100 years, Awan-Scully said. </p>
      <p>He pointed to five seats in North East Wales as a “key battleground”, which Labour must hold if they are serious about making Boris Johnson “an ex-prime minister by Christmas”. </p>
