      <p>IT is a momentous month for west Belfast man William Pimley.</p>
      <p>And as he prepares to celebrate his 100th birthday, he went back in time yesterday and returned to his former school after more than eight decades.</p>
      <p>Smiling as he walked through the doors of St Malachy's College, the visit had added poignancy as he was met by his great-grandson Deaglán Pimley, who has recently started the north Belfast school as a year 8 pupil.</p>
      <p>Accompanied by several members of his family, Mr Pimley, who is originally from the Falls Road area, was given a tour by principal Paul McBride and archivist Gerry McNamee.</p>
      <p>He visited the historic O'Laverty Library where he recalled memories of his school days and viewed a framed picture featuring the names of the teachers who had taught him in 1933 when he joined the college.</p>
      <p>But there was one particular place Mr Pimley wanted to see again - the chapel in the school.</p>
      <p>And in a touching moment in the church, the 99-year-old broke into song, singing the hymn Hallelujah.</p>
      <p>He said it was "lovely" to be able to return.</p>
      <p>"It's 86 years since I started here, the last time I was in this building was in 1937," he said.</p>
      <p>"I sang in the choir of the centenary year of the school in 1933 as that was the year that I started.</p>
      <p>"They formed a choir for the centenary and they picked me, even though I was only through the door."</p>
      <p>Mr Pimley was also shown the school register from August 30 1933, which featured his name marking his first day at the school.</p>
      <p>It recorded that he left the college on February 22 1937 to start a job in the GPO as a technician and then the traffic division.</p>
      <p>"As a pupil I left in 1937 as the GPO called me and I was there for 46 years," he said.</p>
      <p>Mr Pimley, who will celebrate his 100th birthday on November 25, also pursued a sporting career, competing in the Commonwealth Games in New Zealand in 1974 representing Northern Ireland in bowling.</p>
      <p>He also played rugby and hurling in Derry after living in the city for a time.</p>
      <p>He has been blessed with five children, 10 grandchildren and 16 great grandchildren.</p>
      <p>His son David said it was wonderful for his father return to the school.</p>
      <p>"I think he is overawed, but it's lovely for him to be able to visit," he said.</p>
      <p>"Obviously 1933 is a long time ago, but it's good for him to come back and see the school again."</p>
      <p>Deaglán, who started in St Malachy's in September, said he was "excited" to have his great-grandfather visit the school.</p>
      <p>"It's nice to see him back here to the school he once went to and get a tour of what it is like today," he said.</p>
      <p>As the tour came to a close yesterday, Mr Pimley presented a copy of the 1933 school magazine to be donated to the St Malachy's College archives.</p>
