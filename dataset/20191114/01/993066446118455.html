      <p>HOLLYWOOD actor Tom Cruise was falsely accused of stealing somebody's cigarettes in a Co Kerry pub while he was filming 1992 epic Far and Away, politician Michael Healy-Rae has claimed.</p>
      <p>The independent TD claimed an elderly punter threatened the Top Gun actor with a stick when he visited the pub during a break from filming.</p>
      <p>Speaking on Newstalk's Pat Kenny Show, Mr Healy-Rae said the punter saw Cruise reach across the counter to get more ice for his soft drink but thought the actor was going to steal the barman's cigarettes.</p>
      <p>The punter, known as Ger The Manny, "jumped up off his stool, he caught his stick and drew a belt at yer man’s hand trying to hit him across the hand," Mr Healy-Rae said. "But he just missed and there was a big bang down on the counter right near the Yank’s hand."</p>
      <p>According to Mr Healy-Rae, Cruise shouted: "My goodness I was just leaning in to get a bit more ice."</p>
      <p>"Ger The Manny shouted out, ‘You b**ta*d you were trying to steal Matt’s fags’."</p>
