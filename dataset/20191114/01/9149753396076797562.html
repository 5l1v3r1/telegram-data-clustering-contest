      <h1>A new BioShock game seems more likely than ever</h1>

      <p>A follow-up to BioShock Infinite is currently in development, if a flurry of recent hints and job listings are anything to go by. While work on a new BioShock game has reportedly been in progress <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/a-new-bioshock-game-is-reportedly-in-the-works-at-a-top-secret-2k-studio/">at a "top-secret" 2K studio</a> since at least 2018, recent activity seems to lend credibility to that rumor.</p>
      <p>Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick said during the company's latest fiscal report that it has "the strongest development pipeline in history",  a big claim coming from the parent company of Rockstar Games. For reference, during the last decade Take-Two has shipped Grand Theft Auto 5, Red Dead Redemption 2, three Borderlands games, as well as BioShock Infinite and a slew of NBA 2K games. </p>
      <p>Zelnick added that the company plans to release "sequels from our biggest franchises as well as exciting new IP". Barely a week later, <a href="https://26-allgamesdelta.s-ul.eu/vKdZ7hwA">this job listing</a> from 2K Publishing in Novato, California was unearthed, advertising for an 'End Game Design Lead'. For reference, the "top-secret" 2K studio alluded to above is located in Novato.</p>
      <p>"We want to build a post-narrative set of systems, quests and player progression that gives our fanatic fangirls and fanboys more content to experience on an ongoing, live-services basis," it reads.</p>
      <p>Nothing about that screams "BioShock", except when you take into account <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bioshock/comments/dviyom/meet_the_likely_bioshock_4_team/">this reddit thread</a>, which compiles all of the current talent working at the Novato studio. It's a substantial list, with five of the twelve listed having previously worked on BioShock games. There's no clear indication regarding a release window, but it does seem likely that BioShock will return.</p>
