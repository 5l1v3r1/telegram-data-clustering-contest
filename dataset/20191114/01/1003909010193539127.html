      <h1>Exterminator says cockroaches widespread in Calgary after restaurant ordered closed</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T01:23:23+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 01:23</time> by <a rel="author">Brodie Thomas</a></address>
      <p>A northeast Calgary restaurant was ordered closed by AHS earlier this month due to a host of health violations, including live cockroaches.</p>
      <p>Mongolian Hotpot, also known as Happy Lamb, in the Pacific Place Mall is now closed until it has been reinspected and deemed suitable by a public health officer.</p>
      <p>The notice of closure, <a href="https://www.albertahealthservices.ca/assets/wf/eph/wf-eph-cgy-happy-lamb-hot-pot-100a-999-36-street-ne-calgary-november-7-2019-a.pdf">published on the AHS website</a> and dated Nov. 8, lists eight infractions including live and dead cockroaches throughout the kitchen area, improper food storage and a “heavy accumulation” of debris on floors and walls.</p>
      <p>The notice requires the owner to hire a pest management company to certify the restaurant is cockroach free.</p>

      <p>Bill Martin, owner of Martin’s Pest Control, said he didn’t get many calls for the notorious bugs when he started his business, but lately they’re becoming commonplace.</p>
      <p>“There’s a huge explosion of cockroaches in Calgary right now,” said Martin. “It’s just getting worse and worse all the time.”</p>
      <p>He said they’re getting calls to treat cockroaches in all sorts of buildings, including restaurants, apartments, small businesses and even single-family homes.</p>
      <p>Martin believes the sharing economy is part of the reason for the increase in cockroaches.</p>
      <p>“You can go out and buy a bed from somebody, you can buy used clothing . . . or you might buy a box of old records and there might be roaches in the box,” he said.</p>

      <p>He also said that ease of travel means people may be inadvertently bringing them back on international flights.</p>
      <p>He said treatment options are dwindling as well.</p>
      <p>“One of the problems is with Health Canada because they register which chemicals we’re allowed to use, and we don’t have much left to use these days,” said Martin, who added that he is losing about one chemical each year from his arsenal.</p>
      <p>Martin said people tend to rush to the hardware store for a can of bug spray, but those don’t really treat the problem. He said they are generally flushing agents, which primarily bring the bugs out from hiding places without necessarily killing them.</p>
      <p>He said cleanliness is the most effective way of preventing cockroaches in the first place. Once a space has been treated, keeping it clean is necessary to ensure the roaches stay away.</p>
      <p>Given what he’s seen, Martin expects calls for cockroaches to remain high in and around Calgary.</p>
      <p>“This problem is going to get much worse before it gets better,” he said.</p>
