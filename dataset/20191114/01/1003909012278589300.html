      <h1>Smartphone ticketing coming to all CTrains and buses by next year</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T01:03:25+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 01:03</time> by <a rel="author">Sammy Hudes</a></address>
      <p>CTrain and bus commuters will be able to use their smartphones to pay for rides as of next year, according to Calgary Transit.</p>
      <p>Through a mobile ticketing program, riders will have the option of paying for and validating their transit fare using the smartphone app <a href="http://www.calgarytransit.com/MyFare">My Fare</a>.</p>
      <p>The rollout will take place mid-2020 on all buses and trains. It will act as a complement to paper ticketing options, which Calgary Transit plans to keep.</p>
      <p>“We anticipate a pretty good uptake for the convenience of using an app to pay for the system, including on buses,” said Chris Jordan, manager of service design for Calgary Transit. “This is just a convenience that customers are looking for, not a full-scale change to our system.”</p>
      <p>The cost of the program is $5.5 million.</p>
      <p>Validators will be installed on Calgary Transit vehicles by next year. After registering a credit card through the app, users can purchase electronic adult or youth monthly passes, or single-ride tickets.</p>
      <p>To validate a ticket, riders must scan it on board the bus or train.</p>

      <p>Jordan said the transit agency is hoping 10 to 25 per cent of riders will gradually migrate to mobile payment over the coming years.</p>
      <p>The 2020 rollout follows a <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/calgary-transit-to-test-pay-by-smartphone-on-four-routes-with-full-rollout-by-2020">90-day mobile ticketing pilot</a> that took place from late June to September on four Calgary Transit routes.</p>
      <p>Riders participating in the pilot were given the chance to download a test version of the My Fare app to pay for single-ride trips and monthly passes.</p>
      <p>They were then asked to complete a survey at the end of each month, as feedback was used to learn how the app was functioning and “iron out the wrinkles,” according to Jordan.</p>
      <p>He called it a “success,” noting 250 users participated in the test phase. About 150 of those submitted their thoughts throughout the pilot.</p>
      <p>“They overwhelmingly said that they would use the app again,” he said.</p>
      <p>“A third of the participants said that they would use it with some tweaks, and mostly what they’re looking for is to have products that are not part of our initial offering — so to have something other than monthly passes for youth and adults, or single-ride tickets for youth and adults.”</p>
      <p>Those products, including the low-income transit pass, seniors pass and UPass, won’t be available through the app upon the initial rollout, but Jordan said Calgary Transit plans to add them at a later date.</p>
      <p>The app relies on a platform called <a href="http://www.justride.com/">Justride</a>, created by London-based tech company Masabi. It’s had success in cities such as Las Vegas, Boston, London and Denver, according to Calgary Transit.</p>
      <p>The move toward electronic fare collection follows a long process that began more than a decade ago, including an ill-fated attempt by Calgary Transit to implement a pay-by-card system.</p>

      <p>But the $5-million Connect Card project <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/calgary-transit-cancels-connect-card-vows-legal-action-to-recover-money">was cancelled in 2015</a> due to <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/transit-riders-can-now-tap-credit-cards-at-ctrain-stations-but-still-no-electronic-fare-system">reliability issues</a> with the system and its supplier.</p>
      <p>Jordan said mobile ticketing is a “modern and efficient” approach that would be a good fit for Calgary.</p>
      <p>“What we’ve seen over the past decade is an evolution in the ways that transit agencies and even other retailers have migrated to mobile payment, where customers don’t want to carry around a whole bunch of cards,” he said.</p>
      <p>“They would prefer to just have the method of payment stored on their smartphone.”</p>
