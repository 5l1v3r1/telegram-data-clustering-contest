      <p>Walt Disney Co on Wednesday said its new streaming service, Disney+, has reached 10 million sign-ups since launching on Nov. 12.</p>
      <p>REUTERS: Walt Disney Co shares soared to a record high after the entertainment firm said its new streaming service, Disney+, had been met with "extraordinary consumer demand," reaching 10 million sign-ups in its first day.</p>
      <p>The strong performance, which added US$18 billion to its market capitalization, appears to establish Disney as a leading player in the streaming wars that pit it against industry leader Netflix Inc , Amazon.com Inc's Prime Video service, Apple Inc's Apple TV+ and AT&amp;T Inc's forthcoming HBO Max service.</p>

      <p>Combined with Disney's other streaming businesses - Hulu, which has 26.8 million subscribers, and ESPN+, which serves 3.5 million subscribers - the company now serves 40.3 million viewers in the United States, compared to about 60 million for Netflix.</p>
      <p>Disney shares rose 7.5per cent to US$149 in late day trading on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
      <p>Disney+, which launched in the United States, Canada and the Netherlands on Tuesday, was hit with technical glitches that the company said were caused by higher-than-expected demand.</p>
      <p>The service costs US$7 per month and features roughly 500 movies and 7,500 TV episodes from the company's deep family entertainment catalog, as well as new programming. A bundle including ESPN+ and Hulu costs US$13.</p>
      <p>In April, Disney said it plans to reach 60 million to 90 million Disney+ subscribers globally by 2024.</p>
      <p>In a note on Wednesday, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives wrote that at its current pace, Disney could hit that subscriber goal potentially two years earlier.</p>
      <p>PROMOTIONS</p>
      <p>Although Disney's day one numbers were more than three times the size of some forecasts, it was not immediately clear how many of these new customers were from free promotions.</p>
      <p>In October, Disney and telecom provider Verizon Communications Inc announced a promotion that made all new and existing Verizon unlimited wireless customers, as well as new Fios and 5G home internet customers, eligible for a free, one-year subscription to Disney+.</p>
      <p>Ahead of the launch, Disney executives said they expected between 17 million to 19 million new subscribers as a result of the Verizon promotion. Verizon told Reuters in October it expected even more of its customers to have access to the deal.</p>
      <p>Disney said it had no future plans to release Disney+ subscriber data outside of the company's quarterly earnings calls.</p>
