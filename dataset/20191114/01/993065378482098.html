      <p>DON'T look back in anger, move forwards with unfettered resolve to succeed where others have tried and failed.</p>
      <p>Automotive designer Carroll Shelby and daredevil driver Ken Miles did just that in 1966 when they turbo-charged the racing division of Ford Motor Company to glory ahead of reigning constructor champion Ferrari at the Le Mans 24-hour endurance race in France.</p>
      <p>The battle royale between the two brands on the undulating asphalt of the Circuit de la Sarthe is recreated in muscular fashion by director James Mangold, working from a script penned by Jason Keller and London-born brothers Jez and John-Henry Butterworth.</p>
      <p>Le Mans '66 is a crowd-pleasing drama of triumph on four wheels, anchored by terrific lead performances from Matt Damon and Christian Bale, who fire on all cylinders as human trailblazers behind the roaring engines.</p>
      <p>As Shelby, Damon threads his innate everyman charm with a mischievous streak to defy the interfering men in suits and reduce chief executive Henry Ford II to a whimpering wreck after a spin in the GT40 prototype.</p>
      <p>Bale has the showier role as Miles. The Welsh actor achieves another extreme body transformation, dropping 70lb in weight after his Oscar-nominated turn as Dick Cheney in Vice to portray a scowling, anti-authoritarian maverick.</p>
      <p>Initially, the film focuses on marketing executive Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal), who persuades hard-nosed boss Ford (Tracy Letts) that the key to revitalising the ailing brand is to make Ford sexy.</p>
      <p>"James Bond does not drive a Ford," argues Lee.</p>
      <p>"That's because he's a degenerate!" growls Ford.</p>
      <p>Eventually, the chief executive dispatches Lee to Italy to court Enzo Ferrari (Remo Girone) and sign a commercial deal to draw on Ferrari's expertise.</p>
      <p>Discussions break down at the last minute and Ferrari insults the Americans by telling them to "go back to your big, ugly factory making big, ugly cars".</p>
      <p>In response, Ford orders his company's racing division to build a car capable of humiliating Ferrari at the 1966 Le Mans.</p>
      <p>Stetson-wearing Carroll Shelby (Damon) accepts the seemingly impossible challenge and he approaches Ken Miles (Bale) to sit behind the wheel of the Ford GT40.</p>
      <p>Lee's boardroom rival, fellow executive Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas), denounces the appointment – "Ford means reliability. Ken's not a Ford man!" – but Carroll is adamant that Miles is the only driver for the job.</p>
      <p>Le Mans '66 excels during breathlessly staged racing sequences in an era when the need for speed heightened inherent dangers of the sport.</p>
      <p>Damon and Bale jump-start a winning on-screen partnership, leaving Bernthal and Lucas's under-nourished rivalry in their exhaust fumes, and Catriona Balfe is poorly served as Ken's doting wife – the only female character of note.</p>
      <p>Mangold shifts sweetly through the gears, screeching through a saggy middle section before he hits thrilling top speed with the titular showdown.</p>
