      <h1>Massachusetts firefighter killed trying to save baby from fire</h1>
      <h2>He saved two firefighters but was trapped</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T01:35:41+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 01:35</time> by <a rel="author">Carma Hassan, CNN</a></address>
      <p>(CNN) - Just hours before a planned family vacation to Disney World, a veteran firefighter was killed early Wednesday when his ladder crew got trapped while searching for residents in a four-alarm fire, authorities in Worcester, Massachusetts, said.</p>
      <p>Lt. Jason Menard, 39, was among the firefighters who responded to calls of a fire on the second floor of a multifamily home, with a baby possibly trapped on the third floor, his department said in a <a href="http://www.worcesterma.gov/announcements/statement-from-the-worcester-fire-department">statement</a>.</p>
      <p>"Lt. Menard heroically and selflessly saved his crew, helping a probationary firefighter to the stairs and then returning to rescue another trapped firefighter, assisting him out the window," fire Chief Michael Lavoie said.</p>
      <p>But when fire overtook the third floor, Menard couldn't escape, his chief said. And his comrades couldn't reach him.</p>
      <p>A married father of three, Menard and his family "had planned this morning to be on a trip to Disney," said Michael Papagni, president of Menard's firefighters' union, Local 1009. "They are now instead planning a hero's sendoff."</p>
      <h3>Extreme weather complicated firefighting efforts</h3>
      <p>Strong winds and frigid cold complicated firefighting efforts, Lavoie said, with the overnight low recorded at 18 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
      <p>Menard and three other firefighters were taken to UMass Memorial Medical Center. Two firefighters have been treated and released. A third remains hospitalized in serious but stable condition, the chief said.</p>
      <p>A woman who lived in the building was taken to the hospital with serious injuries, the fire department reported. Everyone else was accounted for and is OK.</p>
      <p>Multiple law enforcement agencies are investigating the fire's cause, Lavoie said.</p>
      <p>Menard had been a firefighter with the Worcester Fire Department since 2010.</p>
      <p>"He was a passionate fire officer who absolutely loved being a firefighter," Lavoie said. "He took his job very seriously, performed it admirably, and his dedication to the residents of Worcester was unwavering."</p>
      <h3>The city is 'no stranger to loss'</h3>
      <p>Worcester on Tuesday had announced memorial tributes to honor <a href="https://www.wcvb.com/article/at-least-three-firefighters-injured-battling-intense-worcester-fire/29781948">eight firefighters who died in the line of duty over the last 20 years</a>, City Manager Edward Augustus Jr. said.</p>
      <p>The tributes, set for December, will recognize the so-called <a href="http://archives.cnn.com/1999/US/12/08/firefighters.killed.01/">Worcester 6</a> -- firefighters Timothy Jackson, James Lyons III, Joseph McGuirk, Paul Brotherton, Jeremiah Lucey, and Lt. Thomas E. Spencer -- who were killed in 1999 in a warehouse blaze allegedly started by a <a href="http://archives.cnn.com/1999/US/12/06/firefighters.killed.01/index.html">quarreling homeless couple</a>.</p>
      <p>Jon Davies, who was killed in 2011, and Chris Roy, who died last December, will also be remembered, Augustus said.</p>
      <p>"To have this cruel loss early this morning is almost more than one city can bear," Augustus said.</p>
      <p>"Sadly, we're here again with heavy hearts," Papagni said. "We're no stranger to loss."</p>
