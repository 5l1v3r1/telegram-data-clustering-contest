      <p>KAMPALA, Uganda -- A human rights lawyer in Uganda says 75 people will be charged in court after police raided a gay-friendly bar. Activists call it the latest attack on the LGBT community.</p>
      <p>Nicholas Opiyo said Tuesday that police have released 50 other people after Sunday's raid in the capital, Kampala. He calls the bar popular with the LGBT community as a place where they won't be judged.</p>
      <p>Gay rights activist Kasha Jacqueline says the bar is used for health outreach programs. Jacqueline rejects police allegations of drug possession.</p>
      <p>A police spokesman denies the raid targeted the LGBT community.</p>
      <p>Homosexuals face discrimination in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa. Uganda punishes sex acts "against the order of nature" with up to life in prison.</p>
