      <p>LAKE Macquarie City Council is offering local artists $1100 to create 11 award trophies for next year's Lake Mac Awards.</p>
      <p>It's an opportunity for an artist to have their artwork immortalised at Lake Mac's night of nights, a spokesperson for the council said.</p>
      <p>Council is seeking expressions of interest for a suite of bespoke awards to be presented to the winners at a ceremony in February 2020.</p>
      <p>Council's arts, culture and tourism manager Jacqui Hemsley said the trophies would be more than just a keepsake for the award winners, becoming an art piece to display in their homes for years to come.</p>
      <p>"The Lake Mac Awards celebrate the achievements of individuals in our community that strive for excellence in business, community services, sport and in the creative industries," Ms Hemsley said.</p>
      <p>"We want to see artists submit creative designs that reflect the significance of these awards and the achievements of the award winners.</p>
      <p>"We are excited to have the opportunity to work with a local artist to create something beautiful that our winners will cherish for many years."</p>
      <p>Artists will be given $1100 to design, fabricate and deliver 11 award trophies.</p>
      <p>The design can be suitable for display or practical use. Materials include, but are not limited to, wood, sculptured form, ceramic, glass, metalwork or plaster.</p>
      <p>This commission is for artists located in the Lake Macquarie Council local government area.</p>
