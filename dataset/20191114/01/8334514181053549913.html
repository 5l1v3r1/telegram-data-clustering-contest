      <p>Briton Murray, on the comeback trail after hip surgery, was initially set to face Roger Federer in a blockbuster Group C clash in Sydney but the 20-times Grand Slam champion pulled out of the Jan. 3-12 tournament, making Switzerland ineligible.</p>
      <p>Bulgaria have replaced Switzerland in the group, meaning Murray instead faces a prospective match with Dimitrov, dubbed “Baby Fed” for his similar playing style to the Swiss master.</p>
      <p>Chile, Poland, Uruguay, Moldova and Norway are the other five teams that qualified for the 24-nation field at the close of the second and final deadline.</p>
      <p>The six group winners and the two best second-placed finishers across the groups reach the ATP Cup Finals in Sydney.</p>
      <p>Each tie comprises two singles and one doubles match.</p>
      <p>World number one Rafa Nadal kicks off his tournament with Spain in Perth against Group B rivals Japan, Georgia and Uruguay, the tournament draw confirmed on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Serbia, led by world number two Novak Djokovic, play Chile, France and South Africa in Group A in Brisbane.</p>
      <p>Russian young gun Daniil Medvedev, beaten in the U.S. Open final by Nadal, will highlight Group D for Russia against the United States, Italy and Norway.</p>
      <p>Group F has Germany, Greece, Canada and Australia playing off in Brisbane and boasts a mouthwatering array of young talent.</p>
      <p>German world number six Alexander Zverev is likely to feature in the singles along with Greek tyro Stefanos Tsitsipas and tempestuous Australian Nick Kyrgios.</p>
