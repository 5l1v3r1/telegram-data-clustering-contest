      <p>THE PSNI has nominated an officer to handle reports of vandalism of Irish language road signs in Mid Ulster after a spate of attacks.</p>
      <p>Details were revealed after a special meeting between Mid Ulster councillors and police.</p>
      <p>Sources have said there were heated exchanges among councillors during the meeting in Cookstown on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Last week <a href="http://www.irishnews.com/news/northernirelandnews/2019/11/07/news/almost-100-attacks-on-irish-language-signs-in-mid-ulster-in-two-years-1758647/">The Irish News revealed</a> that from June 2017 to mid-October this year there were 93 “incidences of vandalism” involving dual language signs across the council area.</p>
      <p>One sign at Gulladuff, near Maghera in Co Derry, has been targeted 12 times since February.</p>
      <p>Council officials recently erected a temporary CCTV camera overlooking the site at Gulladuff Hill.</p>
      <p>The cost to repair or replace the 93 road signs was £12,314.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for the PSNI last night confirmed that “an officer from a local neighbourhood team has been identified as a single point of contact in relation to reports already received and any further reports of damage to signs”.</p>
      <p>Police have said that between January 2017 and November 8 this year they received 39 reports in relation to theft or criminal damage of bilingual signs across the district.</p>
      <p>The figures show that 32 of the reports were made this year, with just one received in 2017 and six in 2018.</p>
      <p>Mid Ulster District Commander Superintendent Mike Baird said: "Some of these reports involved multiple incidents, which occurred at the one location.</p>
      <p>"We are linking each of these reports which, at this time, are being treated as hate crimes.”</p>
      <p>Sinn Féin representative Sean McPeake said the council “has adopted `best practice` policies aimed at promoting minority languages in line with the EU Charter for Regional and Minority Languages”.</p>
      <p>“Perpetual griping from unionism around why minority language protections are put in place only contributes to the demonising and intolerance towards the language by those with a sectarian agenda,” he said.</p>
      <p>DUP councillor Paul McLean claimed the signage “is being used as a territory marking process”.</p>
      <p>SDLP council chair Martin Kearney said Irish is "flourishing in Mid Ulster and there’s a culture that goes along with that and that culture must be respected".</p>
      <p>UUP councillor Trevor Wilson said: “Obviously I condemn all acts of vandalism no matter who or where they come from and nobody should be afraid of a language.</p>
      <p>“But when it’s used as a political weapon then it becomes harder to sell.”</p>
