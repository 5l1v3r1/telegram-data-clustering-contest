      </p>
      <p>AWARD-winning Australian film-maker Damon Gameau grows deeply concerned about the future his four-year-old daughter will inherit if humanity continues to plunder resources and global warming gathers pace.</p>
      <p>He embarks on a mission to meet pioneers and thinkers in the fields of agriculture, civil society, economics, education, sustainability and technology to better understand what the future might look like in the year 2040.</p>
      <p>Taking on board real-life examples of renewable energy projects and marine permaculture, Gameau uses visual effects to realise one potential vision of 2040 for his daughter in the hope that he can inspire urgent change across the globe.</p>
      <p>
        <b>MARRIAGE STORY (15, 137 mins)</b>
      </p>
      <p>OSCAR-nominated writer-director Noah Baumbach (The Squid And The Whale) draws on his own divorce from actress Jennifer Jason Leigh for a bruising portrait of a marriage in crisis, which is being heavily tipped for glory at next year's Academy Awards.</p>
      <p>Charlie Barber (Adam Driver) is a successful stage director, who works closely with his actress wife Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) and the theatre company they established in New York.</p>
      <p>They raise a young son, Henry (Azhy Robertson), and the relationship is a vision of harmony until Nicole's job takes her to Los Angeles.</p>
      <p>Maintaining a long-distance relationship proves too taxing for the couple and the marriage breaks down.</p>
      <p>Nicole secures the services of cut-throat lawyer Nora Fanshaw (Laura Dern) to retain primary custody of Henry.</p>
      <p>Blindsided by his wife's actions, Charlie reluctantly responds by securing his own legal counsel, Bert Spitz (Alan Alda).</p>

      <p>A zombie apocalypse threatens to disrupt a kindergarten class trip in writer-director Abe Forsythe's gore-drenched comedy horror.</p>
      <p>Washed-up musician and professional layabout Dave (Alexander England) endures a messy break-up from his girlfriend. He licks his wounds by gate-crashing the home of younger sister, who has a son called Felix.</p>
      <p>The boy is her priority and Dave half-heartedly makes himself useful by volunteering to chaperone Felix and classmates on a school field trip to a farm led by perpetually perky, ukulele-strumming teacher Miss Caroline (Lupita Nyong'o).</p>
      <p>As the group tour the farm, zombies escape from a neighbouring US testing facility.</p>
      <p>Miss Caroline and Dave bravely shepherd the class to temporary safety inside a gift shop, where they discover children's entertainer Teddy McGiggle (Josh Gad) cowering in the aisles.</p>
      <p>Forsythe's film is simultaneously available to stream on Sky Cinema.</p>
