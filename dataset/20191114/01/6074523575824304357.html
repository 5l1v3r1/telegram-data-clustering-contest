      <h1>Fintech Arm of Chinese Insurance Giant Files for US IPO After Blockchain Push</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T01:08:08+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 01:08</time> by <a rel="author">David Pan</a></address>
      <p>SoftBank-backed OneConnect Financial Technology, the fintech arm of China’s largest insurance company Ping An Insurance, filed a prospectus on Wednesday for an initial public offering (IPO) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>
      <p>The firm plans to list its American Depository Shares on NYSE or NASDAQ with the ticker “OCFT.”</p>
      <p>OneConnect’s <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1780531/000104746919006277/a2239965zf-1.htm">filing</a> with the SEC today called for a target raise of $100 million, though that figure could go higher.</p>
      <p>Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ping-an-ins-oneconnect-ipo/ping-ans-oneconnect-plans-new-york-listing-in-mid-november-source-idUSKBN1W50I7">reported in September</a> that the company was looking for a New York listing after it failed to go public in Hong Kong with a higher valuation. According to the report, the company had hoped to raise $1 billion through the IPO with a valuation of $8 billion.</p>
      <p>OneConnect reported $217.5 million in revenue and net loss of $147 million for the first nine months of 2019, according to the filing. The IPO’s underwriters include Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, HSBC.</p>
      <p>The company is a unit of Ping An Insurance and directly backed by Japanese private equity giant SoftBank, which <a href="https://www.chainnews.com/articles/025476601621.htm">led</a> a Series A funding round valuing OneConnect at $7.5 billion in 2018, according to Ping An’s <a href="http://vip.stock.finance.sina.com.cn/corp/view/vCB_AllBulletinDetail.php?stockid=601318&amp;id=5079927">2018 annual report</a>.</p>
      <p>Ping An has filed for the second-most blockchain patents in China, with 274 at the end of the first half of 2019, according to its annual report, which said that OneConnect will dedicate 1 percent of its annual revenue to blockchain development.</p>
      <p>OneConnect has eight dedicated research institutes and 50 technology labs working on blockchain projects across financial services industries. Its FiMax blockchain network is said to improve data-sharing and privacy processes, according to a OneConnect <a href="https://www.oneconnectft.com/pdf/05.pdf">white paper</a>.</p>
      <h3>Grand ambitions</h3>
      <p>The white paper detailed both its existing and future projects across trade finance, asset securitization and supply-chain financing, as well as 14 use cases that can be applied to sectors outside of banking – including healthcare, real estate and smart-city management.</p>
      <p>OneConnect was the first member of the R3 enterprise blockchain consortium in 2016, while exploring some of its applications with the Hyperledger-based technical infrastructure.</p>
      <p>Blockchain is one of the company’s four major business lines along with artificial intelligence, big data and cloud services that could use blockchain technologies, according to OneConnect’s website.</p>
      <p>Two of its projects were included in the latest blockchain projects <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/from-banking-giants-to-tech-darlings-china-reveals-over-500-enterprise-blockchain-projects">registration list</a> filed with the China Cyberspace Administration in October. They included a data analytics platform and a blockchain-based voting and decision-making system.</p>
      <p>According to the 2018 annual report, OneConnect has worked for more than 200 Chinese banks, 200,000 enterprises and 500 government and commercial institutions.</p>
