      <p>When going gets tough, the tough get going. 24-year-old Karan proved this saying to be true when he lost massive 22 kilos in less than a year. Tired of looking older than his age and being mistaken for his elder brother, he decided to lose weight and get back in shape. Here is a breakdown of his inspiring <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/weight-loss">weight loss</a> quest.</p>
      <p><b>Name: </b>Karan Giridhar</p>
      <p><b>Occupation:</b> Businessman</p>
      <p><b>Age:</b> 24 years</p>
      <p><b>Highest weight recorded:</b>100 kgs</p>
      <p><b>Weight lost: </b>22 kgs</p>
      <p><b>Duration it took me to lose weight: </b>11 months</p>
      <p><b>The turning point:</b> I was rapidly putting on weight and my health was taking the beating. I felt really tired and out of breath all the time, which is when I decided to get my lipid profile tested. The reports were an eye-opener as my cholesterol and triglycerides levels had gone through the roof. Also, everyone who used to come to the office used to mistake me for my elder brother, even though I was four years younger to him. That was the point I realised that enough was enough and I needed to get my health back on track.</p>
      <p><b>My breakfast:</b> I start my morning with a bottle of lukewarm water and a cup of green tea. I keep switching my breakfast between sugarfree dalia, poha, a mixture of beans, corns and fruits, paneer-brown bread or paneer-multi grain bread sandwich. I drink two glasses of pineapple juice between breakfast and lunch.</p>
      <p><b>My lunch:</b> A portion of sabzi and 2 chapatis</p>
      <p><b>My dinner: </b>I make it a point to have light dinner which includes a bowl of dal and a portion of dalia or poha</p>
      <p><b>I indulge in: </b>I have reserved my Sundays as the cheat day. On this day, I eat whatever I feel like including tikka, chap and faluda ice cream. However, I make it a point to eat in moderation.</p>
      <p><b>My workout: </b>I exercise for 6 days a week and take the Sunday off to rest. I do 20 minutes of cardio and 40 minutes of weight training.</p>
      <p><b>Low-calorie recipes I swear by: </b>Whenever I crave to eat anything delicious, I eat paneer tikka which is high in protein and low in calories.</p>
      <p><b>Fitness secrets I unveiled: I</b> have realised that there is no shortcut to losing weight. I did not take any supplements, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/weight-loss">fat loss</a> tablets or even protein shake to lose weight. Instead, I made it a point to stay hydrated, have two mugs of green tea, two glasses of pineapple juice daily and workout regularly.</p>
      <p><b>How do I stay motivated?</b> My brother is my biggest and constant source of motivation. He always keeps me motivated. Secondly, I keep taking pictures to track my weight loss journey and these photos are enough to keep me going.</p>
      <p><b>How do you ensure you don’t lose focus? </b>Whenever I feel that I am losing sight of my journey, I take a look at my transformation photographs which inspire me to stay consistent and focused.</p>
      <p><b>What’s the most difficult part of being overweight?</b> The worst part of being overweight is definitely battling low self-esteem and low confidence level.</p>
      <p><b>What shape do you see yourself 10 years down the line? </b>I definitely do not want to gain weight again and wish to stay fit and healthy.</p>
      <p><b>What are the lifestyle changes you made? </b>Before losing weight, I had the habit of beginning my day with a cup of tea with sugar in it. It was the hardest habit to get rid off and I had to really fight myself to change it. So, I replaced my morning cup of tea with green tea and drinking three litres of water, throughout the day.</p>
      <p><b>What was the lowest point for you? </b>Since no mother wants her child to diet or stay away from food, it was really heartbreaking when my mother used to say that I had grown really fat.</p>
      <p><b>Lessons learnt from weight loss: </b>You have to change your mindset from “I want to lose weight” to “I want to become healthy.” Do not take unnecessary pressure and do your workout religiously. Everything in life can be achieved if you stay focused and work towards it.</p>
