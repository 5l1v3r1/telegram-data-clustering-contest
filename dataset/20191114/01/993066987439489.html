      <p>THE Greens will not be fielding a candidate in North Down in an effort to "maximise the pro-Remain vote".</p>
      <p>The move is expected to give a boost to Alliance, which has consistently rejected calls to stand aside for other anti-Brexit candidates elsewhere.</p>
      <p>The Green Party <a href="http://www.irishnews.com/news/northernirelandnews/2019/11/08/news/green-party-opts-out-of-belfast-seats-to-help-pro-remain-parties-1759834/">has already stood aside in Belfast's four constituencies</a>, with the withdrawal of party leader Clare Bailey in the south of the city specifically designed to help SDLP candidate Claire Hanna unseat the DUP's Emma Little-Pengelly.</p>
      <p>The Greens plan to run in West Tyrone and may announce candidates for other constituencies today ahead of the 4pm deadline for nominations.</p>
      <p>They will not be running in South Antrim, won in 2017 by the DUP's Paul Girvan.</p>
      <p>The contest in North Down has become a focus of close attention following Lady Sylvia Hermon's decision not to defend the seat she has held since 2001.</p>
      <p>The independent unionist's majority over the DUP has since been steadily eroded and was 1,208 at the last election.</p>
      <p>Lady Hermon's withdrawal significantly increases the likelihood of victory for DUP candidate Alex Easton, who is an MLA in the constituency.</p>
      <p>Both Sinn Féin and the SDLP withdrew from the seat to maximise the pro-Remain vote ahead of Lady Hermon's decision not to run.</p>
      <p>Alliance's candidate is deputy leader and North Down MLA Stephen Farry, while fellow assembly member Alan Chambers is running for the Ulster Unionists, who haven't contested the seat since Lady Hermon left the party in 2010.</p>
      <p>Mr Farry is a committed Remainer, while Mr Chambers voted to stay in the EU before accepting the outcome of 2016 referendum.</p>
      <p>However, reflecting his party's shifting stance, the Ulster Unionist MLA is opposed to Boris Johnson's withdrawal agreement and insists he is not contesting next month's election as Brexiteer.</p>
      <p>"I'm inclined towards the best outcome for the people of Northern Ireland," he told The Irish News.</p>
      <p>"If that means remaining in the EU then great, I've no problem with that, but if it's going to be Brexit then it's vital that we get the best deal."</p>
      <p>Announcing her party's decision to withdraw from the contest in North Down, Ms Bailey did not endorse any particular candidate.</p>
      <p>She said the general election came "during extraordinary times" and the priority was to maximise the pro-Remain vote in North Down.</p>
      <p>"Let’s remember that the majority of people across the constituency voted to Remain and they should have an MP that reflects a pro-European view," the Green leader said.</p>
      <p>"I want to see the new MP for North Down follow Lady Sylvia Hermon’s lead in defending our position in the European Union at a time when Brexit threatens our way of life."</p>
      <p>She said it was "imperative" to remain in the EU and use its institutions "to tackle climate breakdown, advance workers right and protect our peace process".</p>
