      <p>A Stormont department that denied threatening to fine community and charity groups for unauthorised signage had told a council that such displays faced a £50 charge, newly uncovered emails show.</p>
      <p>The Department for Infrastructure (DfI) faced criticism after being accused of the warning given inaction over paramilitary flags and 'Soldier F' banners.</p>
      <p>Newry, Mourne and Down District Council said in September it relayed the message to community groups at the department's request, but DfI said it had "not issued any threats".</p>
      <p>Correspondence obtained by The Irish News shows that a DfI official emailed the council about unauthorised signs being erected on Roads Service property.</p>
      <p>The official said he was asked at an inter-agency meeting to "supply details of what can, and cannot, be removed" and referenced the relevant legislation.</p>
      <p>"Basically if someone erects a sign (without permission) on any pole, tree, railing or verge adopted by Roads Service, we can remove it, and charge a fee of £50 (per sign) for doing so," he wrote.</p>
      <p>He said that due to a lack of resources officials had not been enforcing this recently, but in some areas "things are starting to get out of hand, so we will be taking action again very soon".</p>
      <p>"So if you are affiliated to any club, charity, organisation or offering advice to a new business etc, please pass on the word," he added.</p>
      <p>The email gave a list of the "types of signs that can be lifted", including football clubs promoting events; groups organising "coffee mornings/fun runs for charities such as Marie Curie"; and resident groups "with things such as neighbourhood watch, traffic speeding signs etc".</p>
      <p>Some days later, a council official emailed to community contacts much of the same information and wording contained in the DfI official's correspondence, but changed the heading to "fines for advertisements, pictures, signs etc" on roads infrastructure property.</p>
      <p>The correspondence was uncovered by The Irish News through Freedom of Information requests.</p>
      <p>DfI has previously faced criticism for not removing unauthorised and paramilitary flags from its lampposts along public roads.</p>
      <p>Controversy has also surrounded banners erected across the north supporting 'Soldier F', a former paratrooper facing a murder trial over Bloody Sunday in Derry in 1972.</p>
      <p>Sinn Féin's Chris Hazzard had described the fee warnings as "bizarre".</p>
      <p>The South Down representative said it meant parents faced fines for putting up 'children at play' signs, "designed to reduce speeding and, ultimately, save lives".</p>
      <p>"Parents could be penalised in this way while others are apparently allowed to erect signs, paramilitary flags and banners – designed to cause hurt and offence to the families whose loved ones were killed by the British army on Bloody Sunday – with impunity across the north," he said.</p>
      <p>In an initial statement in September, DfI said it had "not issued any threats to councils or anyone else in relation to this issue", adding: "It did not generate and was not aware of this communication from the council."</p>
      <p>The head of DfI, permanent secretary Katrina Godfrey, was involved in email correspondence discussing how to respond to press queries.</p>
      <p>Replying to a press officer, Ms Godfrey wrote: "PS. It is disappointing that CH [Chris Hazzard] didn't contact us first but I accept that we don't need to say that atm [at the moment]."</p>
      <p>DfI issued a new statement the following day after the council's statement conflicted with its position.</p>
      <p>The department again maintained it had "not issued any threats", but confirmed that following a meeting it provided "information in relation to unauthorised signage and the removal process".</p>
