      </p>
      <p>The central government has objected to the reported comments of Nick Read, chief executive of Vodafone, that the India unit of the telecom major was headed for liquidation due to, among other factors, the Supreme Court decision requiring payment of Rs 28,300 crore as spectrum dues. According to media reports, Union Telecom and Communications Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad spoke to Vodafone Idea Chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla to express displeasure.<br/><br/>Vodafone Plc, the parent entity, says its chief's comments were taken “out of context”, presenting an incorrect picture. <a href="https://mybs.in/2XAfCil">Read more</a>. <br/><br/><b>3.
