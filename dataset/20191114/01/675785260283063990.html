      <h2>Dairy producer Arla has decided to create a huge climate database in order to become the greenest producer of milk, cream, cheese and other cow-sourced products</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T01:13:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 01:13</time> by <a rel="author">Milo Boyd, Ruki Sayad, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/milo-boyd/</a></address>
      <p>Britain’s biggest dairy producer is creating a huge climate database in a bid to become the greenest on the planet.</p>
      <p>Arla, owned by 2,300 UK farmers and thousands in Europe, wants to become carbon neutral by 2050.</p>
      <p>The co-operative’s farmers will generate an individual eco-score by inputting information including the size of herds and fuel usage.</p>
      <p>Experts will then visit each one to create a bespoke plan for how they can slash pollution levels.</p>
      <p>The group produces 14 billion litres of milk a year and claims its farmers already emit less than half the industry’s global average CO2.</p>
      <p>Senior director Graham Wilkin-son said: “We want to ensure dairy has a sustainable future.”</p>

      <p>Boss Ash Amirahmadi added: “Whilst there is a lot of negative comment about the impact of food production, farmers are, in reality, the caretakers of the countryside.”</p>
      <p>It follows Arla’s move to scrap use-by labels this year to stop people binning perfectly good milk.</p>
      <p>Shoppers will be urged to use the sniff test to check if milk is off.</p>
