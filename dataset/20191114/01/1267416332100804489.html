      <h2>Pokémon Sword and Shield spoiler alert ahead</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T01:08:35+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 01:08</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mobilesyrup.com/author/brad-bennett" target="_blank">Brad Bennett</a></address>
      <p>It looks like some of the new Pocket Monsters from <i>Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield</i> are going to make their way to <i>Pokémon Go. </i></p>
      <p>Data miners have found references to the new regional Pokémon in the mobile game. The running theory is that these Pokémon will launch alongside the release of <i>Sword</i> and<i> Shield </i>on Friday.</p>
      <p>Regional Pokémon from the 3DS games <i>Sun </i>and<i> Moon </i>made their way to<i> Pokémon Go </i>in special 7km eggs that players could gift to each other. These new monsters will likely be introduced to the game in a similar way.</p>
      <p>The data miners found the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/dlrt8m/pokeminers_indepth_teardown_of_01590_rocket_hq/">code for <i>Sword </i>and <i>Shield</i> Galarian forms</a> on October 22nd, but it only seemed to mention Linoone, Zigzagoon and Weezing.</p>
      <p>That said, hackers have been able to find 20 Galarian Pokémon, so there could be that many in the game.</p>
      <p>Unlike the <i>Sun </i>and <i>Moon </i>regionals, there are a few new Pokémon that evolve from regionals but were not in any of the previous games. This includes Perrserker, Cursola, Sirfetch’d, Mr. Rime and Runegrigus.</p>
      <p>While all of this is based on leaked code and past <i>Pokémon Go</i> content releases, we’ll have to wait until Friday to know for sure.</p>
