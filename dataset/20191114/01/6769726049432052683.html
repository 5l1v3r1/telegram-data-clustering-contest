      <p>LOTTERYWEST is still waiting to hear from a missing division one winner from the November 2 Superdraw.</p>
      <p>The online player is $1.67 million richer, but is yet to claim their prize.</p>
      <p>“Most of our winners come in straight away to claim their prizes, but we do have winners who want to take time to process the win privately,” Lotterywest spokesperson Hermione Coleman said.</p>
      <p>“We respect that, but we do encourage online players to check their entries, just in case they have missed it.”</p>
      <p>The winning numbers were: 1, 2, 10, 12, 21, 42</p>
      <p>In Western Australia, players have 12 months from the date of the draw to claim their prize.</p>
