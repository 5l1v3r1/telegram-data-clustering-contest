      <p>A <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/hunter-mcgrady-plus-size-bride-struggles">plus-size </a>blogger’s re-creation of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/celebrity-news/meghan-markle">Meghan Markle</a>’s most memorable looks is showing women that they can be <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/style-and-beauty">stylish </a>in any shape or size.</p>
      <p>Katie Sturino, a 36-year-old body-positivity advocate based in New York City, shared a recent fashion shoot in which she dressed like the Duchess of Sussex with some side-by-side comparisons.</p>
      <p>“The only woman who can get me to love a purple dress! #supersizethelook Meghan Markle edition. It’s not about who wore it better, style has no size!” <a href="https://www.instagram.com/katiesturino/?hl=en">Sturino </a>captioned with one photo of her in a purple dress similar to what Markle wore at the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/meghan-markle-awkward-encounter-one-world-summit">One Young World</a> summit in London.</p>

      <p>Other popular looks she recreated included Markle’s South African Tour fashions and the denim-wrap dress the royal wore at this year’s US Open.</p>
      <p>Sturino, who is the founder of Megababe Beauty, regularly recreates popular looks worn by celebrity women for her series “Super Size the Look.”</p>
      <p>“Women often feel that celebrity style is inspiring yet unattainable. Quite often because they feel that they need to be a size 0 to pull off the look,” Sturino told Fox News on Wednesday. “I want to show women that style has no size.”</p>
      <p>She started channeling Markle’s wardrobe choices around the time she got engaged to Prince Harry, according to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/10338413/plus-size-blogger-recreates-meghan-markles-favourite-fashion-looks-to-prove-you-dont-have-to-be-skinny-to-be-stylish/">The Sun</a>.</p>

      <p>The beauty blogger said she chose Markle as her muse because she’s an “international fashion star” and “women like to dress like the royals.”</p>
      <p>“Ironically she has some of the easiest styles to translate because her look is very classic,” she said.</p>
      <p>Sturino has also recreated looks worn by Duchess of Cambridge Kate Middleton.</p>

      <p>She points out that while her series may be perceived as a “who wore it better,” her only goal is to celebrate beauty in every size.</p>
      <p>“It’s not about who wore it better...we both look great!” Sturino captioned in a “Super Size the Look” post recreating an outfit worn by <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/kendall-jenner-kardashians-fitting-in">Kendall Jenner</a>. “Put your confidence on first!”</p>
