      <p>It's that time of year again: get ready for traffic, rerouted buses and street closures (oh my!) as the Dreamforce conference is set to take over Moscone Center.</p>
      <p>As crews feverishly work to get everything set for the start of Dreamforce on Nov. 19 — and as SOMA prepares to host 170,000 of Salesforce's closest (and conference-registered) friends — a key street near Moscone Center has already shut down. <b>Howard Street between Third and Fourth streets</b> was closed as of Tuesday, and will remain closed for the remainder of this week and next, before reopening Sunday, Nov. 24 at 8 p.m.</p>
      <p>The Howard Street closure will affect drivers who are used to traversing Howard Street; traffic will be rerouted to Harrison Street via 2nd Street, or to Folsom and Harrison streets via New Montgomery Street and Hawthorne Street, Muni said in its <a href="https://www.sfmta.com/press-releases/sfmta-weekend-transit-and-traffic-advisory-saturday-november-9-2019">street closure announcement</a>.</p>
      <p>Along with the street closures, bus routes will also be shifted due to the conference. The following Muni routes will be affected: 8 Bayshore; 8AX Bayshore A Express; 8BX Bayshore B Express; 10 Townsend; 12 Folsom; 14 Mission; 14R Mission Rapid; 14X Mission Express; 30 Stockton; 45 Union/Stockton; 81X Caltrain Express; and 82X Levi Plaza Express. Expect to add some time for your bus to navigate around the street closures, as Muni predicted "significant traffic congestion" between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. during Dreamforce.</p>
      <p>For those bicyclists who traverse down that stretch of Howard Street, you'll be re-routed as well: Expect to head north on Second Street and turn onto Market Street for your commute. Those who would rather avoid biking on Market Street will be given the option of getting off their bike at Howard and Third streets and walking them on the north sidewalk of of Howard Street, Muni said. (There will be signs signaling the detour for bicyclists on the street.)</p>
      <p>And lastly, Muni is discouraging visitors and locals from using their cars to get to the conference, but if you're the type to catch a ride in a taxi, there are two temporary taxi stands set up on the eastside of Third Street between Howard and Minna streets (for those heading northbound), and the southside of Howard Street between Fourth and Fifth streets (heading westbound).</p>
      <p>If that's not enough, there may be another unexpected street closure in store (and yet to be announced): Barack Obama is scheduled to be keynote speaker for the conference and his appearance could force more street closures depending on where he stays, as <a href="https://sfist.com/2019/11/12/the-dreamforce-street-shutdowns-begin-today-avoid-that-part-of-soma-at-all-costs/">SFist points out</a>.</p>
