      <p>An investigation is underway after a man's body was found in burnt bushland north-west of Kempsey last night.</p>
      <p>Local residents found the body on the southern end of the Kyuna Track at Willawarrin, about 34 kilometres from Kempsey, shortly before midnight on Wednesday November 13.</p>
      <p>The person is yet to be formally identified; however, it's believed to be a 58-year-old man who lived in a shed nearby.</p>
      <p>Officers from Mid North Coast Police District have been told the man was last seen on Friday November 8.</p>
      <p>The Carrai East fire in the area where he was found has now burnt through more than 93,000 hectares and remains at 'watch and act'.</p>
      <p>A post-mortem examination will be conducted to determine the cause of death and confirm identity.</p>
      <p>A report will be prepared for the information of the Coroner.</p>
