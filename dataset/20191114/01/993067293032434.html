      <p>SPECIALIST building products firm AG in Tyrone has opened a new specification centre in Dublin in a move that underlines its commitment to the Irish market and gives it a post-Brexit foothold in the EU.</p>
      <p>The third-generation family-owned business, which employs around 200 staff throughout Ireland and the UK, manufactures and sells a wide range of specialist walling, paving and facing brick products used in domestic and commercial hard-landscaping projects.</p>
      <p>The Dublin expansion comes on the back of a 30 per cent year-on-year increase in general sales across the business and will see the new centre focus on commercial growth in the Irish market through relationship building with architects, engineers, local authorities and key influencers across multiple sectors.</p>
      <p>Eamon Cullen, specification consultant at AG, said: “Our mission is to create innovative quality solutions that are better, safer and faster. We believe this commitment is one of the things that sets us apart in our current markets and that this new facility will provide tangible evidence of our long-term confidence in the Irish marketplace.</p>
      <p>“This investment will underline our objective to establish AG as one of the most efficient, innovative and productive companies in our sector.</p>
      <p>“Regardless of what happens as a result of Brexit, AG will remain focused on growing sales, profit and performance wherever the opportunities present themselves."</p>
