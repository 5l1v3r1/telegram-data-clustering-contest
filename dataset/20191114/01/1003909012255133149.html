      <h1>Health minister uncertain about constitutionality of doctors' conscience rights bill</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T01:36:50+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 01:36</time> by <a rel="author">Bill Kaufmann</a></address>
      <p>A controversial doctors’ conscience-rights bill won’t impede services for abortion, transgendered people and those seeking medically assisted death, Alberta Health Minister Tyler Shandro said Wednesday.</p>
      <p>But the minister admitted he isn’t entirely familiar with some aspects of private member’s Bill 207, which passed first reading in the legislature last week.</p>
      <p>Those comments came the same day the Alberta Medical Association expressed opposition to the bill, calling it “unnecessary” while saying it threatens to “limit access to patient services.”</p>
      <p>Speaking to reporters at a news conference held to assure Albertans the construction of the Calgary Cancer Centre is on schedule and budget for a 2023 opening, Shandro said he supports the notion of providing physicians conscience rights.</p>
      <p>But he wouldn’t say if he will support the bill if it’s put to further votes.</p>
      <p>“I think there’s a lot of apprehension that people have about what this bill means,” he said.</p>

      <p>Bill 207 would provide immunity from discipline for health providers who refuse to address patient needs that offend their conscience, including opting to decline to provide a referral.</p>
      <p>Shandro reiterated his stance that the legislation would have no effect on health care access to those three groups, adding he takes seriously his role as health minister to protect those rights.</p>
      <p>“I’m going to make sure it’s not going to impact access,” he said.</p>
      <p>But he couldn’t say what purpose the bill would serve if it didn’t affect the level of medical services by supplying physicians with power to define conscience, saying that’s better known by its sponsor, Peace River UCP MLA Dan Williams.</p>
      <p>“That’s for Mr. Williams to answer,” said Shandro.</p>
      <p>And when pressed about the constitutionality of the bill, Shandro said he couldn’t comment, particularly given the time he devotes to the $23-billion ministry.</p>
      <p>“You’re over my head a little bit,” he said.</p>
      <p>Shandro said he also isn’t entirely certain if the bill would meet the codes of conduct, ethics and professionalism set out by the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Alberta, but added he believes those codes banning discrimination would remain paramount.</p>
      <p>“I can get back to you on that. I actually don’t know to the extent (Bill 207) would be different from what’s provided already (by the college),” he said.</p>
      <p>“Very clearly, discrimination based on gender identity or sexual orientation is prohibited by that health profession.”</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, Williams’ office noted retired supreme court justice John C. Major has said he considers Bill 207 to be constitutional.</p>
      <p>Shandro’s uncertainty over aspects of a bill that could severely affect patient rights and health is troubling, said Janis Irwin, the NDP’s LGBTQ issues critic.</p>
      <p>“I find it surprising he’s not very knowledgeable about its impacts,” said Irwin. “It’s a bill that very much impacts his ministry.”</p>

      <p>The Edmonton-Highlands-Norwood MLA said the bill could well be unconstitutional and that its intention to remove any consequences for physicians refusing to make referrals is unacceptable.</p>
      <p>“This is an attack on women and gender-diverse folks regardless of whether it’s passed or not,” she said.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Alberta Medical Association president Christine Molnar said doctors’ conscience rights are already protected under College of Physicians and Surgeons’ standards.</p>
      <p>“The more serious issue is the bill may have unintended consequences in limiting patient access to services,” she said in a letter to Shandro.</p>
      <p>“For physicians, the current state protects conscience rights while also ensuring patients are given information or referral to allow them to pursue access to the desired service. This arrangement has served Albertans well and should be maintained.”</p>
      <p>The Alberta College of Physicians and Surgeons echoed those sentiments and noted its standard of practice demands its members “not withhold information about the existence of a procedure or treatment because providing that procedure or giving advice about it conflicts with his/her Charter freedom of conscience and religion.”</p>
      <p>A University of Calgary medical bioethicist said she’s astounded by the bill’s priority.</p>
      <p>“It’s focusing on the person who’s well (physicians). Why aren’t we focused on the person who’s unhealthy?” said Dr. Juliet Guichon.</p>
      <p>She noted the Ontario Court of Appeal earlier this year ruled making referrals is a physician’s requirement.</p>
      <p>“The first concern is the acute suffering of the patient,” said Guichon.</p>
