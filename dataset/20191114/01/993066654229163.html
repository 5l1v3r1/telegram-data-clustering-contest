      <p>THE Portadown firm which is Ireland's biggest scrap metal exporter saw its turnover surge to £85.5 million last year - up £10 million on the previous year.</p>
      <p>Clearway, which was established in the mid 1960s when John Murphy started in the waste management and scrap recycling business, also saw its bottom line profit jump from just shy of £10m to more than £14.6m, according to its latest set of accounts.</p>
      <p>But retained earnings at the end of last December almost halved to £35.5m after the family-owned firm paid out dividends of £41.5m.</p>
      <p>The firm - which is still controlled by members of the Murphy family - has depots in Belfast, Dublin, Derry and Sligo.</p>
      <p>It also runs the Aughrim Landfill site near Lisburn, which has the capacity to receive up to 250,000 tonnes of waste a year.</p>
      <p>The directors said they are pleased with the company's performance and are "cautiously optimistic" for the year ahead.</p>
      <p>But they admit they are "acutely aware" of the present instability around Brexit and the volatility in world markets in general.</p>
      <p>Clearway processes all grades of ferrous and non-ferrous scrap metals which is then supplies to local and export markets.</p>
      <p>It is also a specialist in crushing end-of-life vehicles.</p>
      <p>According to its accounts, it had 97 staff on its books at the end of last year, and its wages bill rose to £3.5 million.</p>
      <p>The UK metal recycling industry is currently worth more than £5 billion a year, making the market prices for metal extremely competitive.</p>
      <p>As scrap is a commodity, prices often fluctuate in the same way as oil or any other natural resource.</p>
