        <b>An Australian policeman has been charged with murder over the shooting death of an Aboriginal teenager in a case that has drawn national attention.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Kumanjayi Walker, 19, died after being arrested at a house in the Northern Territory (NT) on Saturday.</p>
      <p>His death has sparked community anger and protests across the country.</p>
      <p>Constable Zachary Rolfe, 28, was arrested on Wednesday, NT Police said. He will plead not guilty to murder, a police union said.</p>
      <p>Mr Rolfe was granted bail following a court hearing and has been suspended with pay.</p>
      <p>Police said they would also conduct an internal investigation into the shooting in Yuendumu, a remote community 300km (190 miles) north-west of Alice Springs.</p>

      <p>The territory government has called for calm amid rising community tensions that have seen crowds converge on the police station in Yuendumu.</p>
      <p>NT Chief Minister Michael Gunner said he acknowledged the Yuendemu community - 85% of whom identify as indigenous - was "hurting and grieving".</p>
      <h3>What is known about the case?</h3>
      <p>Mr Walker was shot sometime after two police officers went to arrest him for breaches of his suspended sentence, local media reported.</p>
      <p>He died in the police station at Yuendumu. There was no medical care in the town at the time - medical staff from another town arrived after he had died.</p>
      <p>NT health officials said the medical clinic in Yuendumu had been unstaffed due to safety concerns about break-ins.</p>

      <p>The Royal Flying Doctor Service said it had also delayed travelling to the site because of safety concerns.</p>
      <p>Mr Walker's family was notified of his death hours after he died, Australian media reported. Officials have classified his death as a "death in custody".</p>
      <p>He is the second Aboriginal person to have died in the past two months after being shot by police. Joyce Clarke, 29, was fatally wounded in Western Australia in September.</p>
      <p>Australia conducted a royal commission inquiry in 1991 into Aboriginal deaths in custody, but critics say recent reviews have been misleading and not enough is being done to address the issue.</p>
