      <p>TWO trade union activists who were strip searched while leaving Israel earlier this month have described the experience as “humiliating”.</p>
      <p>The woman were part of an Irish Congress of Trade Unions sponsored trip to the region.</p>
      <p>Unison representative Deborah Yapicioz (57) and Irish National Teachers Organisation (Into) member Michelle McCrystal had taken part in a nine-day visit to the Palestinian territories, including the West Bank.</p>
      <p>The delegation visited a UN refugee camp for Palestinians and health centre along with a number of schools.</p>
      <p>They said they were among a group of seven trade union members who were stopped at Ben Gurion airport on November 3.</p>
      <p>It is claimed that of the five women present, four were later fully or partially strip searched.</p>
      <p>Neither of the men were singled out.</p>
      <p>Ms Yaticioz, who is based in Armagh, said she was taken into a small cubicle by a female member of security staff.</p>
      <p>“The security woman had a metal detector and started to pat me down and search me in a far more intimate way than Belfast, touching me in the chest area,” she said.</p>
      <p>She said that she was eventually told to remove her clothes.</p>
      <p>“There I was standing in my birthday suit and she was scanning between my legs and said the metal detector had picked something up.</p>
      <p>“It was intimidating and she made me sit down and I had to open my legs and she had the scanner close to my genital area.”</p>
      <p>Ms Yaticioz said the experience was “completely humiliating” and claimed that those who carried out the search were “unfriendly and hostile”.</p>
      <p>“There was no empathy shown,” she said.</p>
      <p>“I was worried I had to go somewhere else for a more invasive procedure, that was my big fear.”</p>
      <p>Teacher Michelle McCrystal, from near Maghera in Co Derry, believes her group was “marked” before they entered the airport.</p>
      <p>“We were interrogated, everything about it was antagonistic,” she said.</p>
      <p>Ms McCrystal said she was also scanned and forced to remove her bra during a search.</p>
      <p>“It was obvious they were targeting the women in particular,” she said.</p>
      <p>“These were young women doing this and there was an indifference to what they were doing, you were next to nothing.</p>
      <p>“Humiliating is the best word (to describe it).”</p>
      <p>Paul Woods, who teaches in west Belfast and took part in the trip, said he believes the searches were “deliberate”.</p>
      <p>“It was degrading and upsetting for them and it was done with a purpose of humiliating and to send a message that they (Israel) are in control,” he claimed.</p>
      <p>The Israeli Embassy in London was approached for comment.</p>
