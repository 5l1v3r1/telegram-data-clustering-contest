      <h1>‘Paspas Permit’ for biz launched in Valenzuela</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T19:30:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 19:30</time> by <a rel="author">Jun David</a></address>
      <p>Long city hall queues, piles of paperwork, and extended waiting periods could soon be a thing of the past for residents, entrepreneurs, and potential investors wanting to do business in Valenzuela City.</p>
      <p>Starting Nov. 13, an integrated permit application system called the 3S Plus Valenzuela City Online Services will provide a single platform for the application of permits and request for documents.</p>
      <p>This is the first and the fastest of its kind in the country, which spares applicants from the cost and time required of personal applications at the city hall, the city government said in a statement.</p>
      <p>With the City’s commitment to be in full compliance to the Ease of Doing Business (EODB) Law, the highlight of the system is the “Paspas Permit”, the 10-second business permit application system.  It allows the issuance of provisionary business permits within 10 seconds after the payment confirmation.</p>
      <p>Prior to this project, the issuance of business permits at the City Hall takes about 15 to 30 minutes.</p>
      <p>The introduction of the ‘Paspas Permit’ system will accelerate Valenzuela’s adoption of digital technology to streamline services for more than 18,000 businesses in the city.</p>
      <p>According to Mayor Rex Gatchalian, the new platform “demonstrates the local government’s commitment to make services more efficient and innovative, which in turn can attract more investors and spur further development.”</p>
      <p>“Entrepreneurs are indispensable to our country’s growth and so we are empowering them through improved systems of service delivery,” Gatchalian said.</p>
      <p>“At this point, the adoption of digital technology has become essential to fostering growth.  The launch of 3S Plus Valenzuela City Online Services shows how we are leveraging on the innovative use of new technologies for better, faster services to our constituents,” he added.</p>
      <p>City of Valenzuela’s efforts uphold E-Governance have earned accolades from numerous reputable institutions.  It is a Hall-of-Famer to the Most Business Friendly Highly Urbanized City award of the Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry (PCCI), a distinction that it held in 2012, 2014, 2015, and again, in 2019 after a mandatory three-year hiatus from the Search.</p>
      <p>Using the 3S Plus Valenzuela City Online Services, permit applicants can apply for the following documents and services: </p>
      <p>●      Renewal or Application of New Business Permits </p>
      <p>●      Building and Construction Permit application </p>
      <p>●      Real Property Tax (RPT) payments</p>
      <p>●      Requests for Certified True Copy of Tax Declaration, Tax Mapping Certificate, Certificate of Non-Improvement and Appraisal of Real Property</p>
      <p>●      Requests for Certified True Copy of Birth, Death, and Marriage Certificate, and Court Decision</p>
      <p> Actual business permit and documents can be delivered within three to five working days through W Express (formerly DHL Philippines) or Grab Express.</p>
      <p>Payments, on the other hand, can be processed via Visa, Mastercard, debit cards, Bancnet or PayMaya.</p>
      <p>Documentary requirements submitted through the platform are reviewed realtime between 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM on Mondays to Fridays.  Those who were applied beyond office hours shall be processed promptly on the next morning.</p>
      <p>Provisionary Building and Construction permits can also be obtained through the system within 10 seconds upon confirmation of payment.  A provisionary permit shall be sent to the applicant’s email and they can commence construction.</p>
      <p>However, the applicant must submit the original documents to the Office of the Building Official (OBO) within 15 days, so they can get their actual permit.  Failing to do so will revoke their provisionary permit.</p>
      <p>“Simpler and faster processes reflect good governance and this is what we want to achieve through our 3S Plus Valenzuela City Online Services. This platform is a one-stop-shop for permits and documents needed by residents, investors, and entrepreneurs who want to do business in our city,” Gatchalian concluded.</p>
      <p>Trade Secretary Ramon Lopez, in his speech during the launch, called the  project “trailblazing” and called on other local government units and national agencies to emulate it.</p>
