      <p>Anti-narcotics officers in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/thailand">Thailand</a> on Tuesday seized nearly 390 pounds of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/drugs">crystal methamphetamine</a> inside treadmills that had been bound for <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/japan">Japan</a>.</p>
      <p>Authorities were tipped off after their counterparts in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/australia">Australia</a> told them they had busted a similar case with drugs hidden inside exercise equipment from Thailand, Police Maj. Gen. Yingyot Thepchamnong told <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-thailand-drugs/thailand-seizes-176-kg-of-crystal-meth-in-treadmills-bound-for-japan-idUSKBN1XO1JO">Reuters</a>.</p>

      <p>“So we followed up in the belief there must be other cases,” he said.</p>
      <p>Officers at Bangkok’s Suvarnabhumi airport discovered 80 pounds of crystal meth hidden inside the metal frames of the treadmills, Yingyot said.</p>
