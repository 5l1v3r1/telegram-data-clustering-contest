      <h1>5 Important Takeaways From Walmart's Robust Q3 Earnings</h1>
      <h2>The world's largest retailer continues its strong e-commerce growth, with sales up 41% year over year.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T19:02:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 19:02</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fool.com/author/7018/" target="_blank">Danny Vena (TMFLifeIsGood)</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/how-to-invest-in-consumer-discretionary-stocks.aspx">Retailing</a> giant <b>Walmart</b> (<a href="https://www.fool.com/quote/nyse/walmart-inc/wmt/">NYSE:WMT</a>) reported its fiscal 2020 third-quarter earnings before the market opened Thursday. The company delivered better-than-expected profits, driven by strong comparable-store sales and robust growth in e-commerce.</p>
      <p>The continued strong results have been ongoing since early 2018, showing Walmart has cracked the code for competing in a world increasingly geared toward e-commerce.</p>
      <p>Let's look at a few of the most important metrics that led to the positive results. Here are five takeaways from Walmart's robust earnings report.</p>

      <h3>1. Strong sales growth continues</h3>
      <p>For the quarter ending Oct. 25, Walmart delivered revenue of $128 billion, up about 2.5% year over year. This was slightly below analysts' consensus estimates of $128.65 billion. Excluding the headwinds from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, however, the results would have been better, with revenue of $129 billion, up 3.3%. Exchange rates hit the top line by about $1 billion.</p>
      <p>Net sales at U.S. locations grew 3.2% year over year, while sales at international locations increased by 1.3%, reversing <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/08/15/5-takeaways-from-walmart-strong-q2-earnings.aspx">declines from Q2</a>. Excluding the impact of negative foreign currency headwinds, international sales shined, increasing 4.8% in constant currency.</p>
      <h3>2. Comps continue to trek upward</h3>
      <p>Comparable-store sales in the U.S. were instrumental in Walmart's continued success, increasing 3.2% year over year. This marked the 21st consecutive quarter of positive comps in the U.S. for the retail powerhouse. On a two-year stacked basis, comps accelerated sequentially to 6.6%, marking comp growth of more than 6% for five of the past six quarters.</p>
      <p>The improving comparables were driven by comp transactions (customer traffic) that increased 1.3% and comp tickets (the average register tape) that grew by 1.9%.</p>
      <h3>3. Earnings per share soared</h3>
      <p>After several <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/05/16/5-biggest-takeaways-from-walmart-earnings.aspx">quarters</a> of heavy investment that took a toll on the bottom line, Walmart's profits jumped. Earnings per share of $1.15 nearly doubled compared to the prior-year quarter. This was driven by U.S. operating income that increased by 6.1%.</p>
      <p>That's not to say there weren't challenges. Including international operations, operating income declined by 5.4%, or 4.1% in constant currency, partially the result of a noncash writedown in the value of Walmart's investment in Chinese e-commerce operator <b>JD.com</b> (<a href="https://www.fool.com/quote/nasdaq/jdcom/jd/">NASDAQ:JD</a>). Excluding that charge, operating income would actually have risen slightly.</p>

      <h3>4. There was surging e-commerce growth</h3>
      <p>Walmart continued to demonstrate its growing strength in the digital sales arena. The company reported e-commerce sales that increased 41% year over year, driven by a "meaningful contribution" from online grocery sales. E-commerce sales at <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/how-to-invest-in-warehouse-club-stocks.aspx">warehouse outlet</a> Sam's Club continued to improve, up 32% compared to the prior-year quarter. Digital sales also improved in Walmart's international markets, led by China, which nearly doubled year over year, and Mexico, which grew by 65%.</p>
      <p>In prepared remarks, CFO Brett Biggs said that since the launch of NextDay delivery in May, Walmart has expanded the service to more than 75% of the U.S. population. Increased adoption by consumers is helping lower the cost by reducing the need to split shipments.</p>
      <h3>5. Omnichannel initiatives are gaining steam</h3>
      <p>Walmart continued the omnichannel offensive that has proved to be such an effective technique for increasing sales while also drawing shoppers into its stores.</p>
      <p>CEO Doug McMillon said the company was seeing growing success in online grocery ordering, pickup, and delivery in more than a dozen countries. In the U.S., more than 3,000 locations now allow customers to pick up their orders, and more than 1,400 locations provide delivery services.</p>
