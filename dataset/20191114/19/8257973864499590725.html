      <p>Nov. 14 (UPI) -- Wait times for Britons who need to be seen at emergency rooms nationwide are now the longest they've been in 15 years, a government report said Thursday.</p>
      <p>The study by Britain's National Health Services <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/nhs-england-records-worst-a-e-waiting-times-since-records-began-11860793">said 84 percent</a> of patients received treatment within four hours last month in hospitals' accident and emergency department -- a decline from about 86 percent in September. Attendances and emergency room admissions, however, have risen significantly since October 2018, the report said.</p>
      <p>"Today's figures highlight that the NHS is desperately struggling to stay afloat," Dr. Rebecca Fisher, a senior policy fellow at the Health Foundation, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/nov/14/ae-waiting-times-in-england-hit-worst-ever-level">said</a>.</p>
      <p>"The NHS does not have enough staff, or enough equipment, to meet the needs of the population it serves."</p>
      <p>Shadow Health Secretary Jonathan Ashworth blamed Prime Minister <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Boris_Johnson/?tps=1">Boris Johnson</a>'s Conservative Party and its policies.</p>
      <p>"The Conservatives have ushered in the worst NHS crisis on record," he said. "Under Boris Johnson, the NHS is in crisis and we're heading for a winter of abject misery for patients."</p>
      <p>"[Emergency rooms] are overwhelmed, more so than ever," he added. "In every community, there's an ever-growing queue of people waiting for treatment."</p>
