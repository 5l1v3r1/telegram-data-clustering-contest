      <p>San Fernando, Pampanga—A financial assistance package worth P360,000 and jobs were given to 45 rebel returnees who surrendered to the government Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Police Brig. Gen. Trodel Sermonia, newly designated regional director of the Police Regional Office 3 in Central Luzon, said the rebel returnees received an initial P15,000 each from Gov. Dennis Pineda after they were presented to him during a simple ceremony here.</p>
      <p>Pineda urged the former rebels to take advantage of the health and education program of the provincial government, which includes their family members.</p>
      <p>“The rebel returnees belong to the ‘white areas’ who do not carry own firearms but are involved only in legal front groups, which aim to tarnish the government’s reputation,” Sermonia said.</p>
      <p>Myrvi Apostol-Fabian, Provincial Director of the Department of the Interior and Local Government in Central Luzon, said the ex-rebels would receive another P15,000 and P50,000 as livelihood assistance soon.</p>
      <p>Fabia said the returnees will only get the P50,000 livelihood assistance from the Enhanced Comprehensive Local Integration Program after getting clearance from a joint Armed Forces of the Philippines-Philippine National Police panel.</p>
      <p>To fully enjoy their integration into society, the government will also help them get Postal IDs and other valid identification by facilitating their birth and marriage registrations.</p>
      <p>Upon integration, the returnees will be enrolled with the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority to acquire skills and knowledge for employment, livelihood and business ventures, Fabia added.</p>
