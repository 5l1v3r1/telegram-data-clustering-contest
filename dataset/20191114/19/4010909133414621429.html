      <p>The main reason why these smart bands were selling like hotcakes, was due to the fact that not only are they priced at only RM79. But also the fact that both the bands mentioned come equipped with a plethora of features, such as up to 14 days in battery life, 0.95-inch AMOLED display,Â  24/7 health monitoring, Pulse Oxygen Saturation monitoring and more.</p>
