      <p>An uninsured teenage Vauxhall Corsa driver led cops on a wild goose chase through the streets of Exeter before crashing into a hedge.</p>
      <p>Police flashing blue lights raced through the city in the direction of the brazen black vehicle after it mounted a pavement in an attempt to escape.</p>
      <p>The Corsa then rammed another nearby police vehicle, cops say, before recklessly pounding through 'several' red lights.</p>
      <p>But the Corsa's getaway on Wednesday, November 13, soon came to an end after police caught up and 'assisted' it into a bush.</p>
      <p>The law finally caught up with the brazen youngster shortly after 11.35am that morning.</p>

      <p>The 17-year-old male Corsa driver appeared before North and East Devon Magistrates Court today - Thursday - to plead guilty to four charges brought forward following the incident.</p>
      <p>Police have released to the public via Twitter details and imagery of what happened in an effort to raise awareness that dangerous driving will not be tolerated by authorities.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The teen - who cannot be legally named because he is under 18 and classed as a minor - pleaded guilty to dangerous driving, using a vehicle while uninsured, driving otherwise than in accordance with a licence and failing to stop after accident.</p>
      <p>He was remanded on conditional bail on all counts and is to be sentenced by the courts in December, police confirmed.</p>
      <h3>UK driving points - what you need to know</h3>
      <p>Guidance <a href="https://www.gov.uk/penalty-points-endorsements/endorsement-codes-and-penalty-points">issued by the UK Government</a> stipulates courts can fine you and ‘endorse’ your driving record with penalty points if you’re convicted of a motoring offence.</p>
      <p>Endorsements must stay on your driving record for 4 or 11 years, depending on the offence.</p>
      <p>The endorsement and penalty points are put on your driver record. View your driving licence record to see what penalty points you have and when they’ll be removed.</p>
      <p>You can be disqualified from driving if you build up 12 or more penalty points within a period of 3 years. There are different rules for new drivers.</p>
      <h3>Endorsement codes and penalty points</h3>
      <p>Each endorsement has a special code and is given ‘penalty points’ on a scale from 1 to 11. You get more points for more serious offences.</p>
      <p>The table shows the offence codes that can be put on your driving record. It also shows how many penalty points you can get for them. Some offences may also involve a disqualification.</p>
      <p>Offence codes and penalty points must stay on your driving record for 4 or 11 years depending on the offence.</p>
      <h3>Accident offences</h3>
      <p>These codes must stay on a driving record for 4 years from the date of the offence.</p>
