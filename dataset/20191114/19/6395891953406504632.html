      <p><b>BROWN COUNTY, Ohio</b> - A girl in Georgetown, Ohio, can thank a teacher who was administering an online test for getting her out of an alleged horrible situation.</p>
      <p>The teacher asked her what was wrong after the girl was having trouble paying attention, <a href="https://www.newsdemocrat.com/2019/11/14/girl-beaten-and-staved/">The News Democrat of Georgetown reported</a>.</p>
      <p>The girl told the teacher she was hungry and was only allowed to eat a small plate of rice, <a href="https://apnews.com/0b8c654ea59f420f855b3c3a692a8ffd">The Associated Press reported</a>. </p>

      </p>
      <p>She was being home-schooled and the test was being given to her to continue the program.</p>
      <p>The teacher reached out to police, who found the girl and removed her from the home. </p>
      <p>Police said she weighed 47 pounds or about 30 pounds under the average weight of a girl her age when she was found in September, <a href="https://apnews.com/0b8c654ea59f420f855b3c3a692a8ffd">the AP reported</a>.</p>
      <p>Not only was she malnourished, but she was also living in filth and kept in isolation for at least three years, sleeping on a urine-stained mattress and forced to wear a diaper. </p>
      <p>She lived in a locked trailer monitored by security cameras, Brown County Prosecutor Zac Corbin said, <a href="https://apnews.com/0b8c654ea59f420f855b3c3a692a8ffd">according to the AP</a>.</p>
      <p>The girl's guardians admitted to having a camera in her room because she would try to get out, police said.</p>
      <p>Margaret Breeze has been charged with child endangering, kidnapping and felonious assault and pleaded not guilty, <a href="https://apnews.com/0b8c654ea59f420f855b3c3a692a8ffd">the AP reported</a>.</p>
      <p>The girl had been living with Breeze since the woman was granted custody when the girl was 6 years old. Police said she was last taken to a doctor when she was 8, <a href="https://apnews.com/0b8c654ea59f420f855b3c3a692a8ffd">the AP reported</a>.</p>
      <p>The girl spent two weeks in the hospital being treated for the effects of being malnourished, and has gained 15 pounds since she was rescued, <a href="https://apnews.com/0b8c654ea59f420f855b3c3a692a8ffd">the AP reported</a>.</p>
