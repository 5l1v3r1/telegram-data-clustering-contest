      <p>Trying to boost Republican efforts to defeat Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards, President Donald Trump rallies again in Louisiana on Thursday evening, just two days before a Saturday runoff election that's being closely watched by leaders in both parties.</p>
      <p>It's second time in eight days that the President has come to the Bayou State for a campaign rally to help Republican Eddie Rispone, as polls have basically shown a dead heat.</p>
      <p>"You're going out to replace a radical, liberal Democrat," Mr. Trump said to cheers last week, using an attack line which has had mixed success for Republicans in recent elections.</p>
      <p>"John Bel Edwards has not done the job," the President added ahead of Louisiana's unusual November 16 runoff.</p>

      <p>For Republicans, the Louisiana race for Governor is a chance to offset a loss earlier this month in Kentucky, where GOP Gov. Matt Bevin lost by just over 5,000 votes to Democrat Andy Beshear.</p>
      <p>While the President campaigned for Bevin - as he has for Rispone in Louisiana - Bevin was an unpopular Governor, as he netted fewer votes than other Republicans on the ballot running in statewide elections.</p>
      <p>After making various unsupported claims about possible voter fraud, and holding out the possibility of an extended challenge to the results, Bevin on Thursday afternoon conceded defeat.</p>
      <p>That came after a recanvass in each Kentucky county showed no evidence of any changes in vote totals, as the Governor never produced any evidence of voter fraud.</p>

      <p>There were three races for Governor in 2019 - Democrats won in Kentucky, and Republicans kept control with a victory in Mississippi.</p>
      <p>That makes the Louisiana runoff the rubber match for this political year.  Recent polls have shown a dead heat between Edwards and Rispone.</p>
