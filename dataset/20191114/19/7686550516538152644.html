      <h1>Senior Tory wants Ross England to be removed as Assembly candidate after causing rape trial to collapse</h1>
      <h2>Darren Millar believes Ross England should resign as a Conservative Assembly candidate</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T19:04:45+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 19:04</time> by <a rel="author">Will Hayward</a></address>
      <p>A senior Conservative AM said he "strongly believes" that Ross England should be ejected as a Tory Assembly candidate.</p>
      <p>Mr England, who is due to stand for the Conservatives in the Vale of Glamorgan in the 2021 Assembly election, <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/politics/rape-trial-deliberately-sabotaged-conservative-17166210">caused a rape trial to collapse</a> last year through a "deliberate" and "stupid" attempt to tell the jury about the victim's sexual history.</p>
      <p>The incident has already caused the resignation of Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns and Mr England is currently suspended from the party pending an investigation.</p>
      <p>However he is still technically the prospective candidate for the Assembly election in 2021.</p>
      <p>Long standing Conservative AM Darren Millar called on Mr England to resign and, if no resignation was forthcoming, for him to be ejected.</p>

      <p>Speaking on the <a href="https://audioboom.com/posts/7422220-this-is-not-a-hustings-episode-2">This is Not a Hustings podcast</a> , he said: "It's been pretty horrible to be honest.</p>
      <p>"I know you've alluded to one particular person who's not actually standing in this election but is a candidate for the Assembly, and frankly he should resign.</p>
      <p>"He should not be a candidate and, if he doesn't resign, he should be ejected from the approved candidates list that we have here in Wales for the Welsh Assembly, and certainly not be able to stand under the Conservative banner.</p>
      <p>"That's my view, my personal view, and I hold it very, very strongly.</p>
      <p>"It does call into question the size of the pool all parties are fishing from in terms of quality of candidates."</p>
      <p>Following the incident it took over a week for the Tories to offer an apology to the victim in the collapsed trial.</p>
      <p>Eventually a spokeswoman for the Conservatives said the party was "deeply sorry" for the distress caused to the victim.</p>
      <p>In a statement, the party said: "We are deeply sorry for the circumstances surrounding the collapse of the trial and the deep distress this must have caused the victim, her family and friends.</p>
      <p>"Mr England has been suspended from the party and a full investigation is under way.</p>
      <p>"We are proud to support the many women who work for or engage with our party and employ a strict ethical code for staff and volunteers as part of our human resource strategy."</p>
