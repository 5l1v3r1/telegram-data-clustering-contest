      <h1>Jack Ross wins Hibs race as Easter Road club prepare to make big boss announcement</h1>
      <h2>The former Sunderland and St Mirren boss has agreed to take over at Easter Road.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T19:06:07+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 19:06</time> by <a rel="author">Gordon Waddell, Scott Burns, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/gordon-waddell/, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/scott-burns/</a></address>
      <p>Hibs are preparing to announce <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/jack-ross">Jack Ross</a> as their new manager after the 43-year-old won the race to be the club's new head coach.</p>
      <p><i><b>Record Sport</b> </i>understands the former St Mirren and Sunderland boss has agreed to take over at the Easter Road side.</p>
      <p>Ross interviewed for the Hearts job earlier this week but their city rivals will be his next destination.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hibernian-fc">Hibs</a> sacked <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/paul-heckingbottom">Paul Heckingbottom</a> on Monday, November 4 and have found his replacement after just 10 days of searching.</p>
      <p>Eddie May and Steven Whittaker took charge of the win over St Johnstone following the departure of Heckingbottom.</p>
      <p>But now Ross is set to be in the dugout for their home clash with Motherwell on Saturday, November 23 after he was identified as the club’s top target.</p>

      <p>Ross will then make an emotional return to St Mirren three days later as the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scottish-premiership">Premiership</a> 's bottom club host Hibs in Paisley.</p>
      <p>The 43-year-old was sacked as manager of Sunderland in early October but was desperate to get straight back into work.</p>
      <p>He has seen off competition from the likes of Spanish coach Raul Caneda Perez, Harry Kewell and John Hughes. John Kennedy was also linked with the job but Celtic’s assistant manager was not approached by Hibs – and Ross was <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/leeann-dempster">Leeann Dempster</a> and Graeme Mathie’s preferred candidate.</p>
      <p>Now he has just to put the finishing touches to his contract with the Leith side, who are eighth in the table.</p>

      <p>Ross is yet to manage in the Premiership having left St Mirren following promotion from the Championship - where he also managed Alloa.</p>
      <p>Hibs earned just their second league win of the season on Saturday when the beat St Johnstone 4-1 at McDiarmid Park.</p>
      <p>Their only other win came against St Mirren on the opening day of the campaign. Heckingbottom was sacked after a 5-2 defeat to Celtic in the Betfred Cup semi-final.</p>
      <p>Ross bowled over chief Dempster and sporting director Mathie while being interviewed and his CV also impressed them.</p>
