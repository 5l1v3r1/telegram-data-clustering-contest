      <p>Fans had to wait 13 years for a new Tool album, now the seven-year wait to see the US rock band live in Australia is about to come to an end.</p>
      <p>The American band will play Rod Laver Arena on February 22.</p>
      <p>Tickets go on sale November 22 at 2pm from Ticketek, with a Frontier Touring presale starting 2pm next Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The tour comes on the back of their ARIA No. 1 album <i>Fear Inoculum</i>, their first release in 13 years.</p>
      <p>The record, which knocked Taylor Swift’s <i>Lover</i> from top spot, is being reissued on December 13 in an expanded book edition.</p>
