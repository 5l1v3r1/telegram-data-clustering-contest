      <p>Thousands of French health workers took to the streets of Paris and other cities on Thursday with a rallying cry: "Save public hospitals`".</p>
      <p>Protesters say recent spending cuts have harmed care in a country with a health system once the envy of the world.</p>
      <p>President Emmanuel Macron promised to respond to demonstrators with "strong decisions" to be announced next week.</p>
      <p>"We must (...) take responsibility to invest more strongly than we had planned," Macron said on Thursday, adding that he "heard the anger and indignation" of health workers.</p>
      <h3>Health spending cuts</h3>
      <p>As French hospitals were forced to cut €9 billion from their spending since 2005, hundreds of beds were scrapped while stagnant salaries fuelled a flight to the private sector.</p>
      <p>The protesters are demanding €3.8 billion in emergency investment in public hospitals — twice as much as set aside in the draft 2020 budget currently before parliament.</p>
      <p>They held aloft placards with messages such as: "Exhausted caregivers = endangered patients", "Public hospitals in a life-threatening emergency" and "The hospital is suffocating, let's save it."</p>

      <p>Protests began in March when emergency room staff went on strike. They complained of elderly patients being left for hours on trolleys in corridors while waiting for a bed.</p>
      <p>Over 260 emergency rooms nationwide are affected by the movement.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, staff from other hospital departments joined the protest to demand a cash injection from the state.</p>
      <h3>Protester convergence?</h3>
      <p>Authorities fear that hospital staff could band together with other disgruntled groups such as transport workers or students.</p>
      <p>Railway workers are planning mass strike action in December over pension reforms.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, students have demonstrated across France to protest over precarity and living conditions and show solidarity with a destitute young man who set himself on fire.</p>

      <p>Protests marking the first anniversary of the "yellow vest" movement are also planned this weekend.</p>
      <p>In an attempt to head off another winter of discontent, the government has promised to take action. Yet it seems to have little room for manoeuvre.</p>
      <p>Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire warned that "if we spend money on hospitals," the country will need "save it somewhere else".</p>
