      <h1>Taiwan Bans The Sale Of Huawei P30, P30 Pro And Nova 5T</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T19:08:40+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 19:08</time> by <a rel="author">https://www.facebook.com/ADSoomeet</a></address>
      <p>Taiwan has suspended the sales of <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/huawei">Huawei</a>'s three recent smartphones after they were reported to be incorrectly labeling "Taiwan" as "Taiwan, China". Following a recent security update, <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/Huawei+P30+%26+Mate+20+Smartphone+Sales+Hit+37+Million">Huawei's P30</a>, P30 Pro and Nova 5T smartphones were found to be listing "Taiwan" as "Taiwan, China" for timezones and contacts. Taiwan's National Communications Commission (NCC) has subsequently banned the sale of the three smartphones and has communicated the same to local distributor Xunwei Technologies.</p>
      <p>Xunwei Technologies said it is communicating with Huawei over the issue, <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/taiwan-halts-sales-of-three-huawei-phones-in-wording-row-12093468">CNA</a> reports. The smartphones will remain banned until the Chinese phone maker makes the necessary corrections. NCC also threatened to permanently ban the sales if Huawei refuses to bow.</p>
      <p>"The labeling in these phones does not reflect the facts and has even hurt the dignity of our country," the NCC said in a statement. The commission vows to take strict measures to maintain national dignity.</p>

      <p>The political status of Taiwan is a hugely sensitive issue. While China claims Taiwan to be a part of its territory awaiting reunification, the latter has remained a self-governed, democratic state for the last seven decades and refuses to consider itself a part of China.</p>
      <p>Big international brands, however, often bow to China's stance on Taiwan. Huawei itself has previously come under fire in the country for an exactly opposite offense â€“ not labeling the cities of Taipei, Hong Kong, and Macau as part of China.</p>
      <p>Most recently, French luxury goods company Dior had to issue an apology for using a map of China that excluded Taiwan in a presentation. "Dior always respects and upholds the One China principle, strictly safeguards China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and treasures the feelings of the Chinese people," the company said in a statement.</p>

      <p>Last month, Italian luxury car manufacturer Maserati also cut sponsorship ties with Taiwan's Golden Horse film awards, under pressure from China.</p>
      <h3>Taiwan threatens to revoke the certification</h3>
      <p>In response to Huawei's recent actions, the NCC has asked phone and tablet makers across the world to list Taiwan properly in their devices. The commission threatens to revoke their certification if they fail to do so in the future, <a href="https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3817113">Taiwan News</a> reports.</p>
      <p>Going forward, NCC would require mobile device manufacturers to sign an affidavit while applying for certification. They would require to correctly label Taiwan in their operating systems, as well as built-in applications. If they make any undesirable changes afterward, the certification will be revoked and the product will be banned permanently in Taiwan.</p>
