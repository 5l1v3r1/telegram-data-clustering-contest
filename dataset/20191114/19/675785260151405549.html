      <h1>EastEnders Mel Owen's biggest moments: Ian Beale wedding, kidnap and family tragedy</h1>
      <h2>EastEnders aired Mel Owen's death on Thursday, but the character has had a pretty dramatic time in Walford since 1998</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T19:57:40+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 19:57</time> by <a rel="author">Charlotte Tutton</a></address>
      <p>Mel Owen died on EastEnders in surprise scenes on Thursday, with the character killed off moments after surviving an explosion.</p>
      <p>After a car chase with Sharon Mitchell she ended up crashing, but was pulled out of the vehicle moments before it blew up.</p>
      <p>In a twist though, Mel headed back to the burning car claiming she could hear her dead son Hunter inside.</p>
      <p>She walked into the path of an incoming lorry and was killed instantly, marking an end to the character's time on the BBC soap.</p>
      <p>Tamzin Outhwaite returned in January 2018 after around 16 years away - having left the Square back in 2002 - while she always revealed she wouldn't be sticking around for too long.</p>
      <p>After almost a two-year stint back on the show, fans witnessed the character die - but what were her biggest moments on the show since her debut in 1998?</p>

      <h3>Disastrous wedding to Ian Beale</h3>
      <p>Back in 1999 as the Millennium was about to arrive, Mel tied the knot with Ian Beale.</p>
      <p>She only married him out of guilt after he told her his daughter Lucy had cancer.</p>

      <p>But she soon discovered the truth moments after saying "I do", leading to one of the most iconic splits of all time.</p>
      <p>After confronting him during the fireworks, as Walford residents counted in January 2000, she told him: "Well guess what Ian, I don't love you and I never have done."</p>
      <p>She then stormed her way down George Street in her wedding dress, tearing her tiara from her head.</p>
      <h3>Dan Sullivan kidnap horror</h3>
      <p>After Phil Mitchell was shot outside his home, there were five key suspects including Mel Owen's husband Steve.</p>
      <p>But Steve set up criminal Dan Sullivan for the crime with him also a suspect.</p>

      <p>Dan retaliated by kidnapping Mel and holding her hostage in a week of dramatic episodes - Phil Mitchell was on hand to rescue her.</p>
      <p>The scenes saw Mel be told by Dan all about Steve's dodgy dealings and criminal lifestyle, leaving her horrified.</p>
      <h3>Demise of Steve Owen and iconic exit</h3>
      <p>Steve Owen was killed off in the soap in an explosion, as a result of him crashing his car after being chased by Phil Michell in 2002.</p>
      <p>He had baby Louise in the back of the car, and while he remained trapped in the wreckage he managed to save little Lou by passing her to Phil.</p>

      <p>But seconds later the car burst into flames killing him, leaving wife Mel distraught.</p>
      <p>Shortly after this Mel turned against everyone in Walford and learnt of her husband's betrayal with Sam Mitchell - she also found out Lisa was Phil's shooter despite Steve being blamed.</p>

      <p>Mel soon found herself caught up in a drug smuggling crime thanks to late husband Steve who had implicated her - and with the police on her case she had to leave the Square.</p>
      <p>Helped by Phil who gave her £30,000 after finding out she was pregnant with Steve's baby, she left to start a new life.</p>
      <h3>Lisa Fowler friendship</h3>
      <p>One of the best and most-loved friendships ever on the Square is that of Lisa Fowler and Mel Owen.</p>
      <p>They helped each other when in need, including Mel's attempts to get Lisa to Portugal with baby Louise to escape Phil.</p>

      <p>Their friendship was revisited this year when Lisa made her return, and fans were loving it.</p>
      <h3>Wedding showdown with husband Ray</h3>
      <p>New Year's Day 2019 saw Mel's latest wedding to partner Ray Kelly end in death.</p>
      <p>She had rumbled the fact he had two other partners and decided to steal everything from him.</p>

      <p>But Ray learned this on their wedding day and strangled her, believing he had killed her.</p>
      <p>A bruised Mel showed up at the ceremony though and the pair were wed only for him to be arrested for bigamy when the police showed up - he later kidnapped her son Hunter before she could carry out her plans.</p>
      <p>Ray then tried to kill Mel again in the woods, but was shot dead by Hunter.</p>
      <h3>The Vic siege and Hunter's death</h3>
      <p>Most recently Mel faced heartache on the Square as her teenage son Hunter Owen was shot dead by police - she had been hiding him after he escaped prison.</p>
      <p>He almost killed Ben Mitchell, while also risking the lives of Louise Mitchell and Keanu Taylor, as he held everyone hostage in The Queen Vic.</p>

      <p>After shooting Ben and Keanu, he then turned the gun on pregnant Louise leading to armed police shooting him.</p>
      <p>Mel cradled her dead son in her arms and broke down, while she never got over losing him ahead of her own death.</p>
