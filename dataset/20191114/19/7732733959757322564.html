      <h4>In brief: Razer on Thursday announced a new gaming headset featuring THX Spatial Audio technology for improved positional accuracy. And if $129.99 is outside of your budget, there's a second option on the table that's just $59.99.</h4>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.razer.com/gaming-audio/razer-kraken-ultimate">Razer Kraken Ultimate</a> is <a href="https://press.razer.com/product-news/razer-kraken-ultimate-delivers-the-winning-edge-for-competitive-gamers/">described</a> as a competitive gaming headset. It packs custom-tuned 50mm drivers beneath over-ear, RGB backlit cups featuring cooling gel for improved comfort and hidden channels for gamers that wear glasses. Razer said it produces the richest, most immersive and lifelike audio in the Kraken line.</p>
