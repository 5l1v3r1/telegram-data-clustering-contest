      <h1>Documentary about the life and death of Terry Davis, creator of TempleOS</h1>

      <p><a href="https://youtu.be/HB0_VFRe_n8">TempleOS</a> was one of the last bizarre wonders of the Internet, a 64-bit operating system <a href="http://www.codersnotes.com/notes/a-constructive-look-at-templeos/">made entirely from scratch by one man, Terry Davis</a>, in pursuit of singular religious goals. Davis was mentally ill and <a href="https://bbs.boingboing.net/t/terry-davis-is-dead/129741">died tragically at 43</a>. The BBC's Elizabeth Ann Duffy <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m000b4r3">set out to find out what he made, and what made him</a>: "Perhaps we shouldn't think of TempleOS as a technical achievement, but an artistic one."</p>
      <blockquote>When a homeless man was accidentally killed by a train on the 11/08/18 in The Dalles, Oregon, no one realised how many people it would effect. The man was a computer programmer called Terry Davis and he was on a mission from God.<br/><br/>He'd designed an entire operating system called Temple OS and according to Terry its creation had been a direct instruction from God himself. As a fellow programmer explained it, 'you can imagine how over time one man might build a house, but this is like building a sky scraper, on your own!' And this was all done while Terry battled a diagnosis of schizophrenia.<br/><br/>Aleks Krotoski searches the emails, web posts and live streams to piece together the life of a remarkable individual who's work touched so many and is now celebrated not just as a technological achievement but an artistic one.</blockquote>
