      <h1>SNP Health Secretary has known about child cancer scandal at Glasgow hospital for two months</h1>
      <h2>Labour MSP Anas Sarwar says a whistleblower contacted him about the infection case and that the death was later hushed up.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T19:42:34+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 19:42</time> by <a rel="author">Paul Hutcheon, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/paul-hutcheon/</a></address>
      <p>Health Secretary Jeane Freeman is at the centre of an alleged “cover up” <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/claims-emerge-cancer-kid-died-20876487">over claims a child with cancer died from a water infection</a> at Glasgow’s £842 million super hospital.</p>
      <p>Freeman has confessed to knowing for two months about the case at the Queen Elizabeth University <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hospitals">hospital</a> (QEUH) campus – but did not make it public because of patient confidentiality.</p>
      <p>Labour MSP Anas Sarwar, who was passed the “heart breaking” details of the case by a whistleblower, said: “This is a remarkable confession from the Health Secretary.</p>
      <p>“There are now incredibly serious questions for the government and NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde to answer, and a huge challenge to rebuild trust.</p>

      <p>“This devastating death has been covered up since September. Jeane Freeman says she acted, but the most important act would be to inform the parents.</p>
      <p>“At the centre of this scandal is a tragic loss of life, and the priority must be seeking answers for the parents who lost a child.”</p>
      <p>An official probe this year found “widespread contamination” in the water supply at the QEUH hospitals and found 23 cases of children in two cancer wards acquiring bloodstream infections in 2018.</p>
      <p>The hospitals are run by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde.</p>
      <p>However, the Daily Record revealed yesterday that an internal investigation went back further by looking at 2017 but the findings were never published.</p>
      <p>According to a whistleblower who contacted Glasgow MSP Anas Sarwar, the doctor-led probe found another 26 infection cases in children in 2017 and concluded that bacteria had led to the death of one of the kids.</p>
      <p>The results from the internal investigation were circulated within NHSGGC this year but Sarwar said the child’s parents had not been informed.</p>

      <p>It has now emerged that Freeman was told in September.</p>
      <p>She said yesterday: “I receive a great deal of correspondence from individuals about particular patient issues and I don’t reveal that, because that would be entirely wrong for me to do. Not revealing it is not the same as not acting on it, and I acted on it.”</p>
      <p>At First Minister’s Questions, Sarwar told Sturgeon that “something is seriously wrong” at the QEUH and said the case had “broken” him.</p>
      <p>He said: “Central to this whistleblowing evidence is that there were 26 infections at the children’s cancer ward, and in one case a child died as a result. To this day, parents have never been told.”</p>
      <p>He added: “First Minister you aren’t being told the truth.</p>
      <p>“I implore you, for the sake of the staff who have been put in this unforgivable situation, for the sake of all the patients who use this hospital, for the sake of public trust in our institutions, but most of all for the sake of those parents particularly of the child that has lost their life, will you please personally intervene to seek answers?”</p>
      <p>Sturgeon replied: “The Health Secretary is personally involved in all of these issues, and regularly keeps me appraised of developments.”</p>
      <p>An NHSGGC spokesman said: “When a patient dies in our care, our clinical teams discuss with family members the cause of death and the factors that have contributed to this, where they are known.</p>
      <p>“Patients who are very sick are prone to infections and we closely monitor all infections to ensure patients are appropriately cared for. In 2017, we investigated two individual cases of Stenotrophomonas which were not linked. We reported these cases both to the national expert body, Health Protection Scotland and to our Board.</p>
      <p>“These cases were also reviewed again in July 2019 when the clinical view was that no further action was required. At the time of the initial investigation into these cases, national guidance did not include a requirement for health boards to test for Stenotrophomonas in the water supply.</p>
      <p>“Stenotrophomonas is widespread and is present throughout the general environment. As no tests were carried out at the time, it is not possible to conclude that these infections were connected to the water supply. It is extremely disappointing therefore that a whistle-blower has made this claim causing additional distress to families and to other families of cancer patients.”</p>
