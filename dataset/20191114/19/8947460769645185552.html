      <p>The new 1 Series managed to win the hearts of readers and experts, already proving to be a very successful proposition in the compact segment.

The actuator contiguous wheel slip limitation is a technology sourced directly from the BMW i3 electric vehicle and it helps the driver to achieve a maximum grip when touching down the gas pedal.</p>
      <p>As well, the new 1 Series comes packed full of the latest assistance and infotainment system, such as the Active Guard Plus, the Speed Limit Info, the lane departure warning system, the collision and pedestrian accident warning with city braking function, the new <a href="https://www.bmwblog.com/2018/10/22/demo-idrive-7-0-gesture-control-digital-key/">BMW OS 7.0 digital architecture</a> and the new <a href="https://www.bmwblog.com/2018/09/06/video-bmw-intelligent-personal-assistant-to-make-world-debut-at-paris/">BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant</a>.</p>
