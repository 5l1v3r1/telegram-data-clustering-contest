      <h1>Mayweather wants Pacquiao rematch</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T19:02:51+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 19:02</time> by <a rel="author">The Eagle Online</a></address>
      <p>Floyd Mayweather vs Manny Pacquiao II has been in the making for some years now after their “Fight of the Century” back in 2015.</p>
      <p>Mayweather won that bout courtesy of a unanimous decision. Since then, both fighters have called the other out on social media, but a deal has never quite been finalised between the two megastars.</p>
      <p>However, according to SunSport, Mayweather has an added incentive to seek a rematch with the Philippine fighter as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>That’s because the 42-year-old American is looking to build a casino empire out in Asia and a rematch with Pacquiao in Japan would be the perfect way to start the campaign.</p>
      <p>Back in June, Mayweather launched TMT Japan in Tokyo, as well as his partnership with management company Libera and Kyoei boxing gym.</p>
      <p>Hong Kong based promoter Jay Lau told SunSport: “In Asia more and more casinos are setting up.</p>
      <p>“Mayweather came to Tokyo to set up TMT Japan because of the Japan casinos that open in the next year.</p>
      <p>“There are casinos opening in Cambodia, Singapore and China as well. It means boxing will get more and more popular.</p>
      <p>“The Manny rematch is the biggest thing that can happen. I hope it does happen, it could be a big possibility that fight is the grand opening for the Japan casinos.”</p>
      <p>Lau went on to reveal that Mayweather has put the brakes on any potential exhibition fights in the near future as he is solely focused on securing the Pacquiao rematch.</p>
      <p>The promoter said: “Mayweather came two times to Hong Kong, he spoke with my son Jayson and we had communications but now he is focusing on the Pacquiao rematch.</p>
      <p>“We were talking about an exhibition in China, a big event but not a recorded professional boxing fight. Something like Mayweather vs Tenshin in Japan.</p>
      <p>“We spoke a bit about doing a special fight in China, but half way through he turned to the Pacquiao rematch so we stopped.”</p>
      <p>Given Pacquiao is still an active world champion and Mayweather’s last bout was an exhibition against Tenshin Nasukawa, the Philippine would surely go into the rematch as the favourite.</p>
      <p>In his last fight, Pacquiao defeated fellow welterweight champion Keith Thurman, proving that he is still one of the best in the game.</p>
