      <h1>‘Brooklyn Nine-Nine’ Season 8 is Coming to NBC; Season 7 Debuts in Three Months</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T19:30:11+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 19:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.slashfilm.com/author/ben-pearson/" target="_blank">Ben Pearson</a></address>
      <p><i><b>Brooklyn Nine-Nine</b></i>, one of the best network comedies of the past decade, has officially been given the go-ahead for an eighth season. And no, you haven’t missed anything, because Season 7 hasn’t aired yet – that debuts in February 2020. But NBC, which <a href="https://www.slashfilm.com/brooklyn-nine-nine-renewed-for-season-6/">rescued the show</a> after Fox cancelled it two summers ago, evidently wants to keep it alive for a little while longer.</p>
      <p><a href="https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/brooklyn-nine-nine-renewed-season-8-nbc-1203405038/">Variety</a> reports that NBC has given a greenlight to <i>Brooklyn Nine-Nine</i> season 8, renewing the series early just in time for other NBC shows like <i>The Good Place</i> and <i>Will and Grace</i> to finish up their runs. The leadership at NBC loves the show, and viewers do, too – Variety says Nielsen’s measurements show that season 6 averaged a 1.2 rating and 3.2 million viewers overall in Live+Same Day ratings, a 15% increase in total sets of eyeballs when compared to the previous season that aired on Fox.</p>

      <p>Season 7 will consist of 13 new episodes and will debut on <b>February 6, 2020</b>. No word yet on how many episodes will be in season 8, but I expect it to be in that same ballpark; the show used to have 20+ episode seasons when it was on Fox, but dropped to 18 episodes in its first season at NBC.</p>
      <p>I came to this series very late, but it’s quickly become one of my favorite TV shows of all time. It’s a heartwarming blend of lovable characters and often-ridiculous situations peppered with a steady stream of laugh-out-loud jokes, and its characters genuinely care about each other. It may be the perfect television antidote to the godforsaken hellfire real world we find ourselves living in right now.</p>
      <p>Despite the heavy sarcasm evident in the video I’m about to embed, this early renewal truly is very cool news.</p>
