      <h1>Trump bribed Ukraine and committed acts that 'make what Nixon did look almost small', Pelosi says</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T19:04:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 19:04</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/" target="_blank">Chris Riotta</a></address>
      <p><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/nancy-pelosi">Nancy Pelosi</a> has said an investigation into Donald Trump's phone call with <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Ukraine">Ukraine</a> found evidence of “bribery” — an impeachable act — that was corroborated by two key impeachment witnesses in public testimonies this week.</p>
      <p>Speaking at her weekly press conference on Capitol Hill, the House speaker told reporters on Thursday that Mr Trump’s alleged wrongdoings “make what Nixon did look almost small,” referring to the impeachment of former President Richard Nixon.</p>
      <p>“The devastating testimony corroborated evidence of bribery uncovered in the inquiry and that the president abused power,” Ms Pelosi said, “and violated his oath by threatening to withhold military aid and a White House meeting in exchange for an investigation into a political rival.”</p>
      <p>She added: “The bribe is to grant or withhold military assistance in return for a public statement of a fake investigation into the elections — that's bribery.”</p>
      <p>Ms Pelosi appeared to be instating some new messaging by referring to Mr Trump’s apparent demands for political investigations as “bribery” rather than “quid pro quo”, a term that has been used by Democrats to describe the president’s dealings with Ukraine.</p>
      <p>She added: “Well, you know we’re talking Latin around here: e pluribus unum, from anyone, quid pro quo, bribery — and that is in the Constitution — attached to the impeachment proceeding."</p>
      <p>The House speaker provided updates on the Democrat-led impeachment inquiry into Mr Trump the day after career diplomat <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/william-taylor">William Taylor</a> and State Department official <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/george-kent">George Kent</a> delivered joint-testimony to the House Intelligence Committee, which is spearheading the investigation along with two other subcommittees.</p>
      <p>The officials described an “irregular channel” for US-Ukraine relations involving Mr Trump’s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, who has been accused of trying to cook up “political dirt” in the country on one of the president’s political rivals, <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/JoeBiden">Joe Biden</a>.</p>
