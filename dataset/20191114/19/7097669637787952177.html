      <h1>Trump news: Second staffer claims to have heard previously undisclosed call, as Pelosi says president admitted committing bribery</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T19:12:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 19:12</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/" target="_blank">Joe Sommerlad, Chris Riotta, Alex Woodward</a></address>
      <p><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/DonaldTrump">Donald Trump</a> has said he “doesn’t remember” a compromising call he allegedly had with <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/gordon-sondland">Gordon Sondland</a>, the US ambassador to the EU, which top diplomat <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/bill-taylor">Bill Taylor</a> raised at the House <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/impeachment-inquiry">impeachment inquiry</a> on Wednesday, saying a member of his staff had overheard Mr Trump asking Mr Sondland about “the investigations”.</p>
      <p>House investigators heard from Mr Taylor and State Department official <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/george-kent">George Kent</a> yesterday, with both men describing the administration’s “irregular” dealings with <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Ukraine">Ukraine</a> as the president’s personal lawyer <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/rudy-giuliani">Rudy Giuliani</a> and his allies pushed for an anti-corruption probe into domestic political rival <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/JoeBiden">Joe Biden</a>.</p>
      <p>Republican counsel <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/steve-castor">Steve Castor</a> was ridiculed for his part in proceedings.</p>
      <p>While the president entertained Turkish counterpart <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/recep-tayyip-erdogan">Recep Tayyip Erdogan</a> at the White House and said he was not following the drama unfold, a federal appeals court in DC cleared the path for Congress to pursue Mr Trump’s tax records, setting up a potential Supreme Court battle.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, the president petitioned the Supreme Court to shield his tax returns from federal prosecutors.</p>
      <p>The news arrived as he boarded Air Force One for yet another rally in Louisiana to boost support for a Republican running against the state's Democratic governor.</p>
      <p>The upcoming legal battle will likely test the limits of Mr Trump's presidential powers.</p>
