      <h1>Black Friday monitor deals 2019</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T19:49:51+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 19:49</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/author/wes-fenlon/" target="_blank">Wes Fenlon</a></address>
      <p>The biggest deals of the year are nearly at hand: Black Friday is coming in just two weeks. Of course, these days the deals start <i>before</i> Friday itself, which is why we'll be keeping this page regularly updated with the best monitor deals we can find.</p>
      <p>Taking advantage of Black Friday monitor deals can save you hundreds of dollars. Monitors can get expensive when you add in high-quality gaming features like G-Sync, HDR, and 144Hz refresh rates. That's why Black Friday is such a good time to buy one. Monitors with vivid colors and fast refresh rates (typically with IPS and VA panels) still cost a premium, but they're worth it. A high-end gaming monitor can be one of the biggest upgrades you make to your PC, and it's a big investment that will last you for years to come.</p>
      <p>If you find the right deal, though, a great monitor becomes more affordable. Before you buy, check out our guide to the <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/best-gaming-monitor/">best gaming monitors</a> to figure out what you're looking for, and how much you're willing to spend. If you scrimp on features when you invest in a monitor, you'll miss out on stuff like 4K and 240Hz down the road, even if your current <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/best-gaming-pc/">gaming PC</a> can't take full advantage of everything your monitor is capable of. Think about where you want your gaming to be in a couple of years time, and that should inform your monitor choice.</p>
      <p>Plan now, keep an eye on prices, bookmark this article and we'll help you find a superb display when Black Friday gets here. For deals on other hardware, check out our big guide to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/black-friday-deals-2019-gaming/">Black Friday deals</a>.</p>

      <p>While actual Black Friday isn't until November 29, you can expect the deals to start well before then. In previous years we've seen sales start about 2 weeks in advance, so you should keep an eye on the monitors you're considering from about November 15 onwards. Because Black Friday is relatively late in the month this year, you can expect to see the sales running straight into Christmas. There's usually a bit of a lull in early December, but with Cyber Monday happening on December 2 and all the deals from that expected to run until a week after (December 9) then you're realistically going to be seeing cheap prices on monitors right up until Christmas eve.</p>
      <p>In terms of knowing when to pounce, that's a bit trickier. Most retailers save their absolute best deals for Black Friday itself, but there's really no guarantee that your chosen monitor will be a part of that. There's always a headline laptop or two, and you'll definitely find plenty of quality keyboards and mice, but because monitors vary so much and cater to specific needs, it's unlikely that the specific screen you want becomes a headline deal.</p>
      <p>Our advice: If it's late-November or December and you see a decent discount on the gaming monitor you want, don't hold out for a deal that <i>might</i> be better. Grab it.</p>
      <h3>How to save money on monitors during Black Friday</h3>

      <p>Perhaps the biggest problem with Black Friday is that the choice of offers is too bewildering. Every online store is shouting loud about everything it's selling, and it's tough to cut through the madness to separate the genuinely good deals from the overpriced garbage. While we'll be here to guide you during the event itself, here are some money saving tips to help you navigate the savings.</p>
      <p><b>1. Know what you need in advance</b><br/>Don't be dazzled by retailers trying to sell you the benefits you don't actually need on your gaming monitor. Sure, it'd be great to have a 4K display and, oh gosh, you'll save 20 percent on this super shiny panel that does all kinds of 4K but... is the rest of your rig really up to that? And will it be 4K ready any time soon? Would you rather boost your fps instead, and get a monitor with an ultra-fast refresh rate? If you sort the rough spec that you're actually looking for before the sales begin, and look at the screens that offer best-in-class performance for those things, it's easier to cut through the noise and find what you're looking for.</p>
      <p><b>2. Keep a couple of price comparison sites bookmarked</b><br/>While PC Gamer will be bringing you the best deals we can find on monitors, you need to decide whether or not you're buying at the right price for you. Looking at price comparison sites like <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/">CamelCamelCamel</a> can give you a sense of your chosen monitor's price history, and whether or not you're actually getting a good deal. It's often tempting to hold out for the 'lowest price ever' but our advice is to just look for a decent saving and not get too hung up on the screen hitting rock bottom, because that might not happen during Black Friday and—before you know it—the gaming monitor of your dreams is back up to full price.</p>
      <p><b>3. Look out for extras</b><br/>What we're increasingly starting to find is that retailers will offer extra items with gaming monitors to sweeten a specific deal. So, whereas you might see that Asus monitor you've been desperate to buy at the same price on Amazon, Newegg and B&amp;H, one of those sites may give you a rebate, or a code for some free games, or a discount code that is only valid when you check out. It pays to have a nice long read of each product description to make sure you're not missing out on some cheeky extras.</p>
      <h3>Best gaming monitor deals right now</h3>
      <p>Not everyone wants to wait until Black Friday to get that sweet new screen. Sometimes, you want something right here and now. We're keeping this page updated with the best deals we can find, but there may not always be deals listed here in the leadup to Black Friday.</p>
