      <p>The king of ranch dressing has come through with the perfect stocking stuffer for my fellow ranch lovers.</p>
      <p>I kid you not – Hidden Valley has introduced a plastic stocking filled with 52 ounces of ranch complete with a spout on top so you can douse everything on you plate with creamy goodness.</p>
      <p>It’ll set you back $35 and is currently available for preorder at <a href="https://www.hiddenvalley.com/ranch-shop-products/ranch-filled-stocking-preorder/">hiddenvalley.com</a>.</p>
      <p>The stockings are scheduled to ship in early December.</p>
      <p>Or if you’re on a budget, just by a plastic stocking a dump and bunch of bottles in it for a DIY solution.</p>
