      <p>Walmart has dropped the <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/best-cell-phone-deals">price</a> of the Xiaomi Mi Box S, bringing it down to just $39.99. That's $20 off of its regular price.</p>
      <p>And to sweeten the deal, Walmart is also offering up $10 in VUDU credit for those that purchase the Mi Box S. That's good for a couple of movie rentals.</p>
      <p>The Mi Box S is an Android TV set-top box. It's going to connect to your TV and bring you all of your favorite apps and games.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>With Android TV, all of the big name apps are available. Including Netflix, Hulu, Google Play Movies &amp; TV, YouTube, Disney+, BET+, HBO GO and so much more. So you'll be able to watch all of your favorite shows on the Mi Box S with ease.</p>
      <p>This is a cheaper Android TV set-top box â€“ really the only other one available is the NVIDIA SHIELD TV, which is $149. But that doesn't mean that it's missing 4K or HDR. In fact, the Mi Box S has both. So you're still going to get a really good picture out of this one.</p>
      <p>The only downside is that there is no support for Dolby Vision, and the Mi Box S can be a bit slow at times. But if that's not an issue for you, then the Mi Box S is a really great choice for your home entertainment system. It might be a better choice for a bedroom or secondary TV, rather than the one in your living room or den. Seeing as it isn't quite as good as the SHIELD TV.</p>
