      <p>Why the Lemon Bucket Orkestra only made its Regina debut this week, I will never understand.</p>
      <p>The sellout crowd at The Artesian Wednesday night might agree with me.</p>
      <p><a href="https://leaderpost.com/entertainment/local-arts/lemon-bucket-orkestra-sousaphonist-ian-tulloch-happy-for-homecoming">The Toronto-based “Balkan-Klezmer-Gypsy-Party-Punk-Super Band”</a> had the standing-room audience dancing the entire night — informally moving to the music, and formally following Stephania Woloshyn for the step-four-right, step-two-left chain dance to “Ajde Jano.” (I imagine the people in the full pews at the back of the venue tapping their feet and clapping along, too.)</p>
      <p>Roughly translated, the Serbian folk song repeats, “come on Janice,” with the message, let’s sell the horse and let’s sell the house, just so we can dance.</p>
      <p>The 11-member band also had the crowd singing along in Romani — “Caje Sukarije” (ka-yay soo-ka-ree-yay), a song by Esma Redzepova — to instruments like sousaphone (played by Regina expat Ian Tulloch), flugelhorn (band co-founder Michael Louis Johnson), darbuka drum (Jaash Singh) and violin (Mark Marczyk).</p>

      <p>Overall, it was a high-energy show: With all the stomping and dancing, at times I didn’t trust that the floor wouldn’t cave in.</p>
      <p>But, there were a couple of points that hushed the crowd, as band co-founder Marczyk joined in haunting vocal harmonies with wife Marichka Marczyk (an ethnomusicologist from Ukraine, who celebrated five years in Canada on Wednesday) and Woloshyn.</p>
      <p>After two sweaty sets, the Lemon Bucket Orkestra ended the night by parading into the audience and performing a lone English-language song — a brass band version of “I Like To Move It.”</p>
      <p>From the centre of the room, the finale was another singalong, this time a cappella.</p>
      <p>Mark Marczyk led the swaying spectators to participate in Yiddish song, “sholem, sholem, sholem.” When it was over, he told the room the translation of our words: “If I had the strength, I would run out into the streets and scream peace, peace, peace.”</p>
      <p>In a world that seems to get more hateful by the day, Lemon Bucket Orkestra reminded us of love, community and celebrating our differences, just by getting people together in a good time.</p>
      <p>After the show — co-presented by the Regina Folk Festival — one of the players remarked that the band has had its eye on the RFF for the past seven years, but has never been invited to perform.</p>
      <p>Just like the 12-piece <a href="https://leaderpost.com/entertainment/local-arts/queer-songbook-orchestras-regina-debut-a-homecoming-for-artistic-director-shaun-brodie">Queer Songbook Orchestra wowed a Regina audience last fall,</a> then returned for the festival 10 months later, I’m crossing my fingers that the Lemon Bucket Orkestra can do the same.</p>
      <p>For a festival that loves Ukrainian band DakhaBrakha (rightly so) and the Dirty Catfish Brass Band, Lemon Bucket Orkestra would be a perfect fit.</p>
