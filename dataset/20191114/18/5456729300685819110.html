      <h1>Bayelsa Election: APC supporters protest disqualification of governorship candidate - Premium Times Nigeria</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T18:23:40+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 18:23</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/regional/south-south-regional/362997-bayelsa-election-apc-supporters-protest-disqualification-of-governorship-candidate.html" target="_blank">Adejumo kabir</a></address>
      <p>A protest is ongoing at Igbogene in Yenagoa, capital of Bayelsa State, by supporters of the All Progressives Congress (APC).</p>
      <p>The protesters blocked the road and waved placards and APC flags, chanting: “We no go gree ooo. PDP must go, we no go gree.”</p>
      <p>The protest followed the disqualification of the APC governorship candidate by the Federal High Court on Thursday.</p>
      <p>PREMIUM TIMES earlier reported how the court in Yenagoa, on Thursday, declared that the APC did not have a candidate in Saturday election in Bayelsa State.</p>
      <p>This declaration by Justice Jane Inyang was in a case filed by Heineken Lokpobiri, one of the APC governorship aspirants.</p>
      <p>Mr Lokpobiri, a former minister of state for agriculture, had asked the court to declare him, and not David Lyon, the authentic candidate of the APC.</p>
      <p>The Court of Appeal in Port-Harcourt, however, granted a stay of execution on the judgement.</p>
      <p>The state has been governed by PDP since 1999.</p>
