      <h1>Celtic kid Lee O'Connor makes Ireland debut as teenager earns Mick McCarthy's trust</h1>
      <h2>The 19-year-old has been handed his first cap as he makes the starting XI to face New Zealand.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T18:48:32+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 18:48</time> by <a rel="author">Robbie Copeland</a></address>
      <p>Lee O'Connor will make his senior debut for the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/republic-of-ireland-football-team">Republic of Ireland</a> as they take on New Zealand in a friendly on Thursday night.</p>
      <p>The 19-year-old arrived at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> from <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united">Manchester United</a> on deadline day, and is yet to make his first team debut under Neil Lennon.</p>
      <p>He has continued his development behind the scenes, however, impressing international boss Mick McCarthy enough to call him up to his most recent squad.</p>
      <p>And with a key Euro qualifier with Denmark just around the corner, the Ireland boss has opted to give O'Connor a run out in Thursday evening's friendly with New Zealand in Dublin.</p>

      <p>He earns his first cap in an experimental-looking side which also features <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> 's Troy Parrott, though it comes in unconventional circumstances, as a result of a suspension at under-21 level.</p>
      <p>McCarthy had previously confirmed he would start.</p>
      <p>“Lee has been good, he looks to be settling in," he said on Wednesday.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“Young players come in and they're always a bit quiet but the other lads are great in making sure they settle in well.</p>
      <p>“Lee is in a bit by default I guess, given the fact that he is suspended for the under-21s for their game against Armenia.”</p>
      <p>Ireland are looking for a win that will give them some momentum heading into the key Denmark clash, in which a win will make sure of their passage into Euro 2020 in the summer.</p>
