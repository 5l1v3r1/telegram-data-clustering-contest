      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T18:41:05+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 18:41</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mobilesyrup.com/author/aisha-malik" target="_blank">Aisha Malik</a></address>
      <p>Brant County in Ontario has unveiled a new form of public transportation with RideCo tech called <a href="https://www.brant.ca/en/resident-services/brant-eride.aspx#Background-and-additional-resources">Brant eRide</a>, which is an on-demand transit service.</p>
      <p>The service seems similar to Uber and Lyft in the sense that it lets users book a ride online or through an app. It launched on October 15th and is meant to be flexible, affordable and accessible.</p>
      <p>Residents can access the service from Monday to Friday between 6am to 9pm, and on Saturday and Sunday from 8am to 6pm. Brant eRide will not be available on holidays.</p>
      <p>It offers two types of fares. Users can request a community rideshare for $3 CAD a trip, which will pick up and drop off riders at specific locations. They also have the option to request a commuter rideshare for $1 a trip, which then provides a mutual meeting and drop-off location.</p>
      <p>Brant eRide says that all of the drivers for the service have been screened and trained for the job.</p>
      <p>The service replaces the previous subsidized transportation program that operated in Brant County for several years for people with physical disabilities.</p>
      <p>Users can receive four free rides with the code ‘4FREE’ when booking a ride through the app. The code expires on December 31, 2019.</p>
      <p>You can download the Brant eRide on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/brant-eride/id1479499652">iOS App Store</a> and on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rideco.erides">Google Play. </a></p>
