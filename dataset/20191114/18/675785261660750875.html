      <h2>WARNING: GRAPHIC IMAGES Milton Wingert was diagnosed with pleomorphic sarcoma six months ago and avoided leaving his house because he was 'self-conscious' due to the size of the tumour</h2>

      <p>A man is recovering at home after surgeons removed a tumour the size of a football from his neck.</p>
      <p>Milton Wingert, 81, had seen several physicians to ask about removing the tumour over the past six months, but most of them were concerned about its size.</p>
      <p>Medics in New Jersey also believed the surgical removal was dangerous because of where the tumour was.</p>
      <p>The man from Journal Square, New Jersey, was diagnosed with pleomorphic sarcoma six months ago.</p>
      <p>He eventually referred to Dr. Nazir Khan, a head and neck surgeon at Mount Sinai Hospital, New York City, who realised it was possible to get rid of the tumour.</p>
      <p>The pair had thorough conversations about the surgery, including potential complications.</p>

      <p>“When I was referred the patient, the referring doctor sent me a clinical picture and picture of the MRI and my initial reaction was that’s a pretty massive tumour,” Dr. Nazir Khan said, according to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/new-jersey-man-tumor-size-head-removed-neck">Fox News</a> .</p>
      <p>The 81-year-old said several doctors had previously turned him away out of concern that removing the tumour could impact his carotid artery or clavicle.</p>
      <p>He also added he was afraid to leave his house because he was "self-conscious" as he could not cover up the massive growth on his neck, the <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/12/man-gets-massive-soccer-ball-sized-tumor-removed-from-his-neck/">New York Post</a> reports.</p>
      <p>However Dr. Khan said he collaborated with other doctors at the New York hospital, including a thoracic and a vascular surgeon.</p>
      <p>“We were all hands on board hoping for the best but anticipating the worst,” Khan said.</p>
      <p>The surgery, which was a success, was performed on November 5 and took about seven hours, according to <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-7680589/New-Jersey-man-81-cancerous-tumor-size-soccer-ball-removed-neck.html">Mail Online</a> .</p>
      <p>Khan said the tumour he removed weighed between five and seven pounds.</p>
      <p>"I'm happy for him, because I know that he was very scared before the surgery...it was a relatively quicker surgery than we anticipated, we didn't have to do a reconstruction, and he did well," the surgeon told <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/11/13/health/neck-tumor-surgery-trnd/index.html">CNN</a> .</p>
      <p>The patient was released from hospital yesterday, but the doctor said there were still microscopic pieces of cancer that will need to be treated separately from the surgery.</p>
      <p>“I’m going to celebrate my 82nd birthday,” the retired electrician said.</p>
      <p>“It’s a miracle.”</p>
      <p>Mr Wingert is now recovering at home but will be facing chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy after Christmas.</p>
