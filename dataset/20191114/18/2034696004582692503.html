      <p><a href="http://nme.com/artists/queen">Queen</a> have launched a new app which allows fans to sing like <a href="http://nme.com/artists/freddie-mercury">Freddie Mercury</a>.</p>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The app entitled <i>FreddieMeter</i>, shows users how closely their voice matches the late singer’s legendary range by analysing pitch, timbre, and melody to assign them a score of 0 to 100.</p>
      <p>Fans can pick one of four songs on the app – ‘Bohemian Rhapsody’, ‘Don’t Stop Me Now’, ‘Somebody to Love’ or ‘We Are the Champions’ – and challenge friends.</p>
      <p>The device created by Google Creative Lab and Google Research has been trained on Mercury’s isolated vocals as well as samples of people trying to sing like him.</p>
      <p>It has been launched in support of <a href="https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%253A%252F%252Fwww.mercuryphoenixtrust.com%252F&amp;data=02%257C01%257CCaryn.Tomlinson%2540umusic.com%257C33a09be5435d4b78983308d766d46da7%257Cbbcb6b2f8c7c4e2486e46c36fed00b78%257C1%257C0%257C637090934872713446&amp;sdata=RLVKhc9Q3KVP5JfcO17NLqkArIS3ajklAX6ctMrW3vA%253D&amp;reserved=0">Mercury Phoenix Trust</a>, a charity founded by <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/brian-may">Brian May</a>, Roger Taylor and Jim Beach to raise awareness and funds for the fight against HIV/AIDS, and in honour of the 44th anniversary of the band’s first-ever live performance of ‘Bohemian Rhapsody’ at the Empire Theatre in Liverpool in November 1975.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, May recently ruled out plans for the rock giants – who are touring with Adam Lambert – to play <a href="https://www.nme.com/festivals/glastonbury">Glastonbury</a> next year <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/brian-may-explains-why-queen-will-never-play-glastonbury-2560947">after clashing with Michael Eavis over the badger cull</a>.</p>
      <p>“We won’t [play Glastonbury] and there are a lot of reasons for that,” he said.</p>
      <p>He continued: “One of them is that Michael Eavis has frequently insulted me, and I don’t particularly enjoy that. What bothers me more is that he’s in favour of the badger cull, which I regard as a tragedy and an unnecessary crime against wildlife.</p>
      <p>“There’s a little bit of a schism there, I wouldn’t do Glastonbury. Unless things changed radically.”</p>
