      <h1>Newcastle United's January transfers - 5 of the best and 5 to forget</h1>
      <h2>The January transfer window will be open for business in a few weeks</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T18:00:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 18:00</time> by <a rel="author">Stuart Jamieson</a></address>
      <p>The cliche is the January transfer window is a difficult time in which to do business.</p>
      <p>Clubs needing to make big chances know they will be charged a premium, with sides reluctant to lose key players at this stage of the season.</p>
      <p>Good business can be done however, if the right player is drafted in it can change the entire season - whether for a push for honours or a battle against relegation.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Newcastle United</a> have been drawing up plans for the window, and there is believed to be money available to manager Steve Bruce if he decides he wants to strengthen his squad.</p>
      <p>The Magpies are not averse to spending in the winter window and broke their club transfer record to land Miguel Almiron in the January of this year.</p>
      <p>So which winter signings and worked out well, and which are best forgotten about? Here we look at five of the best, and worst.</p>
      <h3>Best</h3>
      <h4>Papiss Cisse</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.chroniclelive.co.uk/incoming/article12812477.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/Football-Chelsea-v-Newcastle-United-Premier-League-Stamford-Bridge-02052012.jpg"/>

      </figure>
      <h4> </h4>
      <p>The Senegal striker was a £9m signing from Freiburg in 2012 and he made an instant impact, scoring on his debut in a 2-1 win over Aston Villa.</p>
      <p>His brace at Chelsea in a stunning 2-0 win later that season is still talking about today, and in total he netted 13 times in his first half-season on Tyneside.</p>
      <p>Demba Ba, Hatem Ben Arfa and <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/papiss-cisse">Cisse</a> formed a lethal attacking partnership which helped propel Alan Pardew's side into the Europa League - only just missing out on Champions League qualification.</p>
      <h4>Moussa Sissoko</h4>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>Moussa Sissoko.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h4> </h4>
      <p>Forget his acrimonious departure, and remember just how good Sissoko was in those first few seasons. A snip at just £1.8m from Toulouse in 2013, the powerful midfielder was quick to show the St James' Park crowd just what he could do.</p>
      <p>After setting up a Cisse goal on his debut at Aston Villa, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/moussa-sissoko">Sissoko</a> then put Chelsea to the sword in a pulsating 3-2 win, scoring twice in an incredible performance.</p>
      <p>His decline in a black-and-white shirt went hand in hand with the Magpies' own reversal of form - but his displays for France at Euro 16 persuaded Tottenham to pay £30m for his services following United's relegation.</p>
      <h4>Martin Dubravka</h4>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <h4> </h4>
      <p>If we're talking bargains, then they don't come much better than <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/martin-dubravka">United's Slovakian goalkeeper</a>. When Rafa Benitez signed him on a loan deal in January 2018 he was largely unknown. A few weeks later he was the talk of the Premier League after a stunning debut in a 1-0 victory over Manchester United.</p>
      <p>A permanent deal followed, with the popular keeper signing a new contract earlier this season.</p>
      <h4>Kevin Nolan</h4>

      </figure>
      <h4> </h4>
      <p>Not much good came from Joe Kinnear's time in charge of Newcastle. But signing Kevin Nolan was a brilliant bit of business.</p>
      <p>Already a favourite at Bolton, United paid the Trotters just £4m for the box-to-box midfielder in 2009 and, while he wasn't able to stop the club from slipping into the Championship, his real impact at the club was still to come.</p>
      <p>Nolan was a key member of the side which stormed to the second-tier title under Chris Hughton, and then led the club back into the Premier League. Who could forget his 'chicken dance' celebrations in that 5-1 win over Sunderland?</p>
      <p>A man who wore his heart on his sleeve, Nolan's contribution to United at a difficult time shouldn't be underestimated.</p>
      <h4>Jonathan Woodgate</h4>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>Jonathan Woodgate and Sir Bobby Robson during a Newcastle United press conference</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h4> </h4>
      <p>Bobby Robson knew a player when he saw him - and Woodgate was supposed to be the final piece in the jigsaw which would lift his side from almost-men to title challengers.</p>
      <p>The former Leeds defender arrived for £9m in 2003, and immediately strengthened United's back line. His battle with Marseille's Didier Drogba in the UEFA Cup semi-final the following April was titanic. He missed the second leg through injury - and Drogba scored twice.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, injuries were to hamper his time on Tyneside, before a £13.4m move to Real Madrid. What a player though.</p>
      <h4>Honourable mentions</h4>
      <p>With a then club record fee paid for <b>Miguel Almiron</b>, it would be wrong to overlook the Paraguayan. He may not have scored yet, but after impressing initially, the forward's form dipped somewhat. Recent performances have shown his is approaching his best form, however.</p>
      <p><b>Andros Townsend's</b> time at the club was short - but what an impact he made under Steve McClaren and then Rafa Benitez. If only he could have been persuaded to stay. <b>Jonjo Shelvey</b> arrived at the same time and played a massive role in the Magpies bouncing back from relegation at the first time of asking.</p>
      <p>He has been in and out of the side in the Premier League, but on his day is one of the best around.</p>
      <p>United had wanted <b>Mathieu Debuchy</b> for a while before landing him in 2013, and the French full-back did demonstrate just why they were so keen, before an ill-fated switch to Arsenal.</p>
      <p>And what about the Gouff? <b>Yoan Gouffran's</b> Newcastle United career was a positive rollercoaster - from first-team to outcast and then back int he Championship when he was an important figure under Benitez.</p>
      <h3>Ones to forget</h3>
      <h4>Seydou Doumba</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.chroniclelive.co.uk/incoming/article15880043.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_IBP_NEC_130216football_52JPG.jpg"/>

      </figure>
      <h4> </h4>
      <p>Steve McClaren needed goals from somewhere, and so took a punt on the Ivory Coast international in 2016. His record was impressive, but fans on Tyneside so little evidence of his goalscoring pedigree.</p>
      <p>He had made little impact by the time McClaren was replaced by Rafa Benitez, and Doumbia's time at the club ended with just 29 minutes of first-team football to show for his effort.</p>
      <h4>Henri Saivet</h4>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <h4> </h4>
      <p>Another McClaren recruit in 2016 - and one who is still on United's books. The Senegal midfielder arrived from Bordeaux and as a low-key signing, compared to those of Shelvey and Townsend. He could argue he hadn't done much wrong when given a chance, but he's spent most of his Newcastle career out on loan, and didn't make <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/steve-bruce">Steve Bruce's</a> Premier League squad at the start of the season.</p>
      <h4>Luuk de Jong</h4>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <h4> </h4>
      <p>The brother of Unted forward Siem, Luuk de Jong was brought in on loan to get some much-needed goals in 2014. It really didn't work out like that though.</p>
      <p>He failed to score in any of his 12 appearances in a black-and-white shirt and, not surprisingly, was back at Borussia Monchengladbach. He went on to impress for PSV and now plays for Sevilla in La Liga.</p>
      <h4>Jean-Alain Boumsong</h4>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <h4> </h4>
      <p>Graeme Souness paid £8m from his old club Rangers for the French defender's services, but it was move which didn't work for all parties.</p>
      <p>While the big defender played plenty of times, he never really looked comfortable in the Premier League, and joined Juventus in 2006 as the Italian giants worked their way out for Serie B following relegation.</p>
      <h4>Islam Slimani</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.chroniclelive.co.uk/incoming/article14931661.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_IBP_NEC_230418football_11JPG.jpg"/>

      </figure>
      <h4> </h4>
      <p>Rafa Benitez brought three players to the club in January 2018 - Brazilian midfielder Kenedy, Martin Dubravka and striker Slimani on loan from Leicester City.</p>
      <p>It's safe to say the Algerian was the least effective of the three.</p>
      <p>Plagued by injuries and a loss of form, the front man struggled for gametime for United and never looked like a player the Foxes had paid £28m for. His time at United effectively came to end when he was given a three-match ban for a clash with West Brom' Craig Dawson.</p>
