      <p>Indore - Skipper <b>Mominul Haque</b> took the blame for <b>Bangladesh's</b> batting collapse after <b>India's </b>pacemen combined to bowl them out for 150 on the opening day of the first Test on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Mohammed Shami claimed three wickets, while fellow quicks Ishant Sharma and Umesh Yadav took two apiece to pack off the tourists early in the final session in Indore.</p>
      <p>Mominul's decision to bat first on a green wicket backfired after they slipped to 31 for three with Yadav, Sharma and Shami sharing the spoils in the morning session.</p>
      <p>The captain then put on 68 runs for the fourth wicket with Mushfiqur Rahim, who made 43, before Ravichandran Ashwin bowled Mominul for 37 to start the slide for Bangladesh.</p>
      <p>"If we had started well, the question wouldn't have been asked in first place," Mominul said on his decision to bat on a green pitch.</p>
      <p>"Me and Mushfiq had a good partnership. I think I should take the blame for getting out at the wrong time. If I would have stayed on, it could have been different."</p>
      <p>Mominul said he thought he "made a tactical error" after the left-hander misjudged an incoming delivery from Ashwin that rattled the batsman's off stump.</p>
      <p>India were 86 for one at stumps after Rohit Sharma was caught behind off paceman Abu Jayed for six.</p>
      <p>Mayank Agarwal, on 37, and Cheteshwar Pujara, on 43, put on an unbeaten 72-run stand to see off the day's play.</p>
      <p>Agarwal survived a reprieve on 32 when Imrul Kayes dropped an easy chance at slip off Abu. Pujara looked solid in his 61-ball stay so far as he hit seven boundaries.</p>
      <p>But it was the Indian bowlers who stood out as Shami ended Mushfiqur's resistance after getting wickets on successive deliveries to stop the Bangladesh tail from wagging.</p>
      <p>Shami bowled Mushfiqur and then trapped new man Mehidy Hasan lbw, prompting the umpires to break for tea.</p>
      <p>Taijul Islam then played out Shami's hat-trick ball after the break, but was later run out for one. Yadav cleaned up Ebadat Hossain to wrap up the innings in 58.3 overs.</p>
      <p>At the start, Bangladesh endured three maidens before getting their first run through Imrul, but he managed just five more before becoming the first wicket.</p>
      <p>Sharma struck in the next over to send Shadman Islam back to the pavilion, also for six.</p>
      <p>Batting remained tough for Mominul and Mohammed Mithun, who was trapped lbw for 13 by Shami finding swing and seam movement.</p>
      <p>"Sometimes you feel that every spell they bowl, something is happening or they make it happen," Ashwin, who claimed his 250th wicket in home Tests, said of his team's pacemen.</p>
      <p>"I think Shami, Ishant and Umesh have been bowling well as a pack and if you add (Jasprit) Bumrah to it over the last few months or a year in Test cricket, I think it's one of the most lethal pace attacks going around in the world."</p>
      <p>The champion off-spinner added though that the hosts were surprised by Bangladesh's decision to bat first on a wicket with a green tinge.</p>
      <p>It could have been worse for Bangladesh had India not been sloppy in the field.</p>
      <p>Rahane, who spilled three chances at first slip, dropped Mominul when he had made only three, and Mushfiqur survived when put down by skipper Virat Kohli at third slip.</p>
      <p>Bangladesh, who lost the preceding Twenty20 series 2-1, had a troubled build-up when star player and captain Shakib Al Hasan was banned for two years, with one year suspended, for failing to report approaches by bookmakers.</p>
      <p>The two-match series is Bangladesh's first in the new world Test championship currently led by India.</p>
