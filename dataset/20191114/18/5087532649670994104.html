      <h1>GitHub Releases iOS App in Beta</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T18:12:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 18:12</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.macobserver.com/author/charlotte-henry/" target="_blank">Charlotte Henry</a></address>
      <p>GitHub announced a beta iOS app<i> </i>at its Universal conference on Wednesday. The Microsoft-owned company also extended its sponsor program, <i>Techcrunch</i> reported.</p>
      <blockquote>The new mobile app, which is now out in beta for iOS, with Android support coming soon, offers all of the basic features you’d want from a mobile app like this. The team decided to focus squarely on the kind of mobile use cases that would make the most sense for a developer on the go, so you’ll be able to share feedback on discussions, review a few lines of code and merge changes, but this isn’t meant to be a tool that replicated the full GitHub experience, though at least on the iPad, you do get a bit more screen real estate to work with.</blockquote>
