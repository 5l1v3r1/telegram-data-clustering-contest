      <h1>Grab a Radeon RX 5700 graphics card for just $290 right now</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T18:31:06+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 18:31</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/author/corbin-davenport/" target="_blank">Corbin Davenport</a></address>
      <p>AMD's Radeon RX 5700 is a great <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/the-best-graphics-cards/">graphics card</a>, if you can't spend a little extra money for the 5700 XT. The card has dropped to $290 a few times, and now one model from XFX has returned to that price. For comparison, most other RX 5700 cards <a href="https://www.newegg.com/p/pl?d=rx%205700&amp;Order=BESTMATCH">start at $330</a>.</p>
      <p>The model on sale uses AMD's reference design, meaning there is no factory overclock, no custom cooler, and so on. Don't worry, thoughâ€”<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/amd-radeon-rx-5700-review/">our review</a> of the reference 5700 found that it still out-performed the RTX 2060 and AMD's own Vega 64. It's a great graphics card for 1440p and 1080p gaming, though you may have to turn settings a bit on the latter (at least in super-demanding games) to maintain silky-smooth 60 fps.</p>
      <p>The exact hardware specifications include a core clock of 1465 MHz, a boost clock of 1725 MHz, 8GB of GDDR6 memory, and 2304 Stream Processors. For video output, you get one HDMI 2.0b and three DisplayPort 1.4.</p>
