      <p>After years of hinting and hoping, Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson has confirmed that he’s officially bringing Black Adam to the screen, in a blockbuster due in December 2021. It’s unclear if the movie’s a direct sequel to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/comics/2019/4/4/17888520/two-captain-marvel-shazam-dc-warner-bros-comics">Warner Bros.’ <i>Shazam!</i></a> or a movie meant to kickoff a bigger DC universe, but Johnson will play the villainous Black Adam, former avatar of the Wizard, who was condemned for using his powers for selfish reasons.</p>
      <p>Johnson shared the news with a post on his instagram, complete with concept art by Jim Lee of himself in Adam’s black and gold:</p>

      <p>Johnson was cast as Black Adam all the way back in 2014, but delays in the production of <i>Shazam!</i> caused the film to conflict with his schedule. A solo <i>Black Adam</i> was subsequently floated. That could be what Johnson is hinting at with the release date here — or it could be the currently in pre-production sequel to <i>Shazam!</i>.</p>
      <p>Black Adam, given name Teth-Adam, was born in 13th-century Egypt, and, as an adult, was chosen to receive the power of Shazam, just like Billy Batson in the modern day. <i>Shazam!</i> even referenced this, explaining that after gaining the power of the lightning, Black Adam freed the Seven Deadly Sins and nearly destroyed the world.</p>
      <p>Functionally, Black Adam is every bit Billy Batson’s equal, with all the same powers — making him strong enough to go toe-to-toe with Superman. In the modern DC Comics Universe, however, he’s also had role as a world leader. After being revived/released in the modern day, he returned to Khandaq, the made-up middle eastern country that he once ruled in antiquity. There, the descendants of his original subjects received him as a theocratic ruler.</p>
      <p>Adam is prideful, powerful, and follows his own code of honor. His stated goal is to protect his people and foster their growth as a society, and he believes that American superheroes have an outsize influence on global norms.</p>
      <p>Which side of Black Adam we’ll see in the next <i>Shazam!</i> installment remains to be seen, but I think it’s safe to bet that either way, The Rock will have some fun bringing him to life.</p>
