      <p>Koforidua, Nov. 14, GNA - Mr Ahmed Tia, the Deputy North East Regional Minister, has called for the strengthening of cultural studies in the educational curriculum to promote interest in the Ghanaian culture from childhood.</p>
      <p>He said cultural dances, weaving, needle work and basketry were skills that, when acquired from childhood, had the potential to create means and sources of livelihood for the youth to support national development.</p>
      <p>The Minister made the call at the Third Regional Day presentations by Greater Accra, Bono East and North East regions at the National Festival of Arts and Culture (NAFAC) 2019 underway in Koforidua.</p>
      <p>Mr Tia noted that children had talents that could be tapped to enrich the culture and creative arts industry and boost employment creation.</p>
      <p>He urged stakeholders to take a critical look at promoting the teaching of such skills in the basic schools.</p>
      <p>Mr Kofi Amoakohene, Bono East Regional Minister, said the Region was endowed with tourists’ attractions such as the Kintampo Waterfalls, the European Cemetery, the Kumsu Slave Market and Buabeng Fiema Monkey Sanctuary and that the Regional Coordinating Council and the Ministry of Tourism, Arts and Culture were working to develop those sites to create jobs for the youth.</p>
      <p>Mr Ishmael Ashitey, the Greater Accra Regional Minister, on his part, said youth unemployment was a huge burden that needed to be looked at from the culture perspective to effectively address.</p>
      <p>Display and cultural performances continue at the NAFAC on regional basis with the Volta and Savannah regions taking their turn on Thursday.</p>
