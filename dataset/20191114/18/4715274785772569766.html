      <p>Airing on CNN Philippines every Saturday at 9.30 P.M., <i>TGIW</i> features top and emerging local destinations that will surely make your weekends more fun and exciting. The former beauty queen and fitness enthusiast, who is also known for her gorgeous travel photos that inspire serious wanderlust, takes us deeper into each trip and shares the stories behind the social media snaps. “As they say, a picture tells a thousand words and we want to do exactly just that on the show - share the story behind that beautiful photo on Instagram or Facebook from your weekend getaway. Traveling is all about the experience - the conversations with people we meet, the history of a place, the different flavors we taste, and that’s not always captured in a single post,” Wilson says. <b>Supporting the local tourism industry</b> <i>TGIW</i> comes at an opportune time when the country’s tourism industry is experiencing remarkable growth, including a continuous increase in the number of domestic tourists. The weekly 30-minute show capitalizes on this by featuring destinations ideal for 48 to 72-hour weekend trips. “There’s always something for everyone in every place we go to. Whatever your interests are, we make sure to feature it to also help our viewers plan their next trip and say Thank God It’s the Weekend!” Wilson excitedly shares. <i>TGIW</i> highlights a destination’s nature and adventure-based attractions, culture and history, local cuisine, and health and wellness activities. It might seem a lot in a single weekend, but Wilson’s natural charm and effortless grace makes <i>TGIW’s</i> itineraries something to look forward to every weekend.</p>
