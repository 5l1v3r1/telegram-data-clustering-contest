      <h1>Support government to achieve vision for new regions – Prez Akufo-Addo</h1>

      <p>Sunyani, Nov. 14, GNA – President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo at the weekend, called on Ghanaians to support his government to achieve the vision and aspiration for the creation of the new regions.</p>
      <p>“We have a duty therefore to be each other’s keeper to ensure that the vision and aspiration with which Nananom asked for the creation of these regions are materialised and these include development in all spheres of life,” President Akufo-Addo stated.</p>
      <p>President Akufo-Addo made the call in a speech read on his behalf by Professor George Gyan-Baffour, the Minister of Planning and Member of Parliament for Wenchi during a colourful durbar of chiefs and people of the three Regions.</p>
      <p>The durbar, held in Sunyani was to climax the 60th anniversary celebration of the creation of then Brong-Ahafo Region.</p>
      <p>The theme for the anniversary was "United in Separation for Progress”, </p>
      <p>“Ahafo, Bono and Bono East are now separate entities but things that bind us all together as a nation remains intact,” President Akufo-Addo told the chiefs and the people of the three regions.</p>
      <p>Before the Region was divided into three, history shows that Brong-Ahafo was carved out from the then Western Ashanti on April 4, 1959 and named after the dominant and native inhabitants - the Bonos and Ahafos, mainly Akans.</p>
      <p> According to traditional authorities in the area, though the Region had been separated to push forward development, the people remain united, thus the need for the celebration to reminisce lessons from the past, possibly strategies towards the realisation of the aspirations for the separation of the Region.</p>
      <p>Dressed in traditional regalia and carried in palanquins, the about 56 paramount chiefs drawn from the three Regions, together with their subjects, spiced the atmosphere in the regional capital with cultural displays amidst dancing to traditional drumming.</p>
      <p>As the chiefs arrived at the Jubilee Park, venue of the event, there was spontaneous firing of musketries by traditional warriors to portray their shooting prowess.</p>
      <p>President Akufo-Addo underlined the need to pay homage to the memories of the pioneer chiefs and queens as well as their compatriots whose sense of vision and nationalism contributed in no small measure to the great stature Brong-Ahafo Region assumed.</p>
      <p>“Those who are heroes, those who live forever are those who lay down their lives so that as a result of their suffering, sacrifices and their self-giving, those who come after them may have freedom, and the opportunity to live their lives as they think best” he said.</p>
      <p>“Nananom of old from this area, as I have read from the account of how the Region was created, were dedicated and futuristic in outlook. They gave their utmost for the region and for Ghana and thought not only about their times, but a time like this too.</p>
      <p>"The onus is now on the present generation to also think about the next generation. It is when we are able to think this way that the sustainable development of our country can be assured.</p>
      <p>“I therefore call on the people of Ghana to hold fast to the very basic tenets that define our being and let each person try in their own small way to work towards the aspirations of our country’s founding fathers,” the President said.</p>
      <p>Professor Christopher Ameyaw Akumfi, the Chairman of the anniversary’s Planning Committee, said the celebration was worthwhile, and paid glowing tribute to people who stood behind and fought for the creation of the Region.</p>
