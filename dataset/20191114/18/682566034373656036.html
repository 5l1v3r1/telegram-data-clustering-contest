      <p>London - <b>Novak Djokovic</b> and <b>Roger Federer </b>prepared to face off for a place in the last four of the ATP Finals on Thursday after <b>Matteo Berrettini</b> made history with a consolation win in London.</p>
      <p>The heavyweights, who have won the season-ending tournament 11 times between them, will meet for the 49th time in a repeat of this year's Wimbledon final.</p>
      <p>Djokovic, who holds a 26-22 advantage, has won their past five meetings, including their epic five-set battle in the final at Wimbledon in July, during which he saved two championship points.</p>
      <p>The Serbian is bidding to equal Federer's record of six ATP Finals titles and is also challenging Rafael Nadal for the year-end number one ranking.</p>
      <p>The second seed, 32, will leapfrog Nadal to finish in the top spot if he wins the title at the O2 Arena and Nadal does not reach the final.</p>
      <p>The Serbian, who can claim a record-equalling sixth year-end number one finish, is hungry to finish the year on top.</p>
      <p>"One of the two biggest achievements that you can have as a professional competitive tennis player is winning a Grand Slam and being number one in the world at the end of the season," he said before the tournament started.</p>
      <p>Federer was asked earlier this week whether the Wimbledon defeat had left emotional or mental scars.</p>
      <p>"We'll find out, but I think it's all flushed away from my side," said the 38-year-old. "A lot of water has gone under the bridge since then."</p>
      <p>He added: "Actually, it's good for me to play him again, and maybe that all helps to get a chance to get him back or whatever it is, but at the end of the day, I'm here for the World Tour Finals and not because of the Wimbledon finals."</p>
      <p>In Thursday's early match in Group Bjorn Borg, which was a dead rubber, eighth seed Berrettini beat Austria's Dominic Thiem 7-6 (7/3), 6-3.</p>
      <p>In doing so, the 23-year-old became the first Italian to win a match at the season-ending championships.</p>
      <p>Berrettini finished with a 1-2 record this week. Thiem had already qualified for the semi-finals after his win on Tuesday against Djokovic.</p>
      <p>Berrettini arrived in London at a career-high number eight in the ATP rankings after starting the season outside of the top 50.</p>
      <p>"I always had great fights against (Thiem)," said the Italian. "I was able to stay mentally focused, especially in the first set.</p>
      <p>"I played a great tie-break, so I'm very happy with my performance."</p>
      <p>Fifth-seed Thiem did not hit the heights he reached during his three-set win against Djokovic, notching just 12 winners compared with 50 against the Serbian.</p>
      <p>Stefanos Tsitsipas has already qualified for the semi-finals from Group Andre Agassi, leaving Nadal, defending champion Alexander Zverev and Daniil Medvedev to scrap it out for the other spot on Friday.</p>
