      <p>(Reuters) - Ford Motor Co (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/F.N">F.N</a>) will tag its new electric sport utility vehicle (SUV) with the Mustang name, the automaker said on Thursday, seeking to entice customers into a new era by linking it to the model whose groundbreaking design in the 1960s combined sportiness and affordability.</p>

      <p>Ford confirmed its new electric SUV will be called the Mustang Mach-E ahead of a debut event scheduled for Los Angeles on Sunday. Until now, the Mustang name has been used only on a line of sporty coupes associated with Detroit’s 1960s muscle car era.</p>
      <p>Customers in the United States, Canada and Europe can start ordering the electric vehicles on Nov. 17, Ford said.</p>
      <p>While Mustang coupes are built in Michigan, the Mach E will be built at a factory in Cuatitlan, Mexico.</p>
      <p>The Mach E is the first of a more than dozen all-electric automobiles the company plans to launch by 2022 with an investment of $11.5 billion as it moves away from traditional gasoline-powered cars.</p>
      <p>Electric vehicle market leader Tesla Inc(<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/TSLA.O">TSLA.O</a>) has used speed and power to sell its vehicles, along with upgradable software and big display screens.</p>
      <p>Using the Mustang name signals that Ford intends to do the same, leaving behind the prior strategy of positioning electric vehicles as practical, “green” cars.</p>
      <p>Competition for electric vehicle customers will intensify over the next several years as more mainstream automakers launch electric models, and Tesla expands into new market segments.</p>
      <p>Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk has said he will unveil a high-performance electric pickup truck at an event in Los Angeles on Nov. 21, coinciding with the Los Angeles Auto Show.</p>
      <p>Ford and General Motors Co (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/GM.N">GM.N</a>) are working on electric pickup trucks as well.</p>
      <p>In April, the No. 2 U.S. carmaker invested $500 million in electric automaker Rivian and said it planned to use the Michigan startup’s platform to build a new Ford-branded electric vehicle.</p>
      <p>Ford has also formed an alliance with Volkswagen AG (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/VOWG_p.DE">VOWG_p.DE</a>) to use the German automaker’s compact electric vehicle platform for new vehicles in Europe.</p>
