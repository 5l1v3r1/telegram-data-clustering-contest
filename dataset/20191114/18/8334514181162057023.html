      <p>(Reuters) - U.S. health officials on Thursday reported 2,172 confirmed and probable cases and 3 more deaths from a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, taking the death toll to 42, so far this year.</p>
      <p>Last week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 2,051 confirmed and probable U.S. lung injury cases and 39 deaths associated with use of e-cigarettes, or vaping products.</p>
      <p>As of Nov. 13, 42 deaths have been confirmed in 24 states and the District of Columbia, the agency said. (<a href="http://bit.ly/2NrLYXW">bit.ly/2NrLYXW</a>)</p>
      <p>Health officials last week also dubbed the discovery of Vitamin E acetate — believed to be used as a cutting agent in illicit vaping products containing marijuana components — in all lung samples from 29 patients as a breakthrough in their investigation.</p>
      <p>Investigators have not linked the cases to any specific product or compound, but have pointed to vaping oils containing THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana, as being especially risky.</p>
