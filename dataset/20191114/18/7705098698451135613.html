      <p><b>Sonic The Hedgehog </b>is a live-action adventure comedy based on the global blockbuster videogame franchise from Sega that centers on the infamously brash bright blue hedgehog. The film follows the (mis)adventures of Sonic as he navigates the complexities of life on Earth with his newfound – human – best friend Tom Wachowski (James Marsden). Sonic and Tom join forces to try and stop the villainous Dr. Robotnik (Jim Carrey) from capturing Sonic and using his immense powers for world domination. The film also stars Tika Sumpter and Ben Schwartz as the voice of Sonic.</p>
      <p>The film should have originally hit theaters on November 14. After very negative reviews from audiences surrounding the design of the iconic character, though, Paramount delayed the release to February 14, 2020. Subsequently, they used that extra time to redesign Sonic to better fit his look from the video games.</p>
      <p><b>Sonic The Hedgehog</b> hits theaters on February 14, 2020. What do you think about the new <b>Sonic The Hedgehog </b>international posters? Let us know in the comments section below.</p>
