      <h1>Fans to get more information as Premier League and PGMOL agree to VAR changes</h1>
      <h2>More information is set to be given to fans in stadiums after clubs met with Mike Riley in London</h2>

      <p>Fans inside stadiums will get more information about VAR checks after the Premier League and PGMOL agreed to make changes to the system.</p>
      <p>Representatives from all 20 top flight clubs were in London on Thursday to speak with the head of referees, Mike Riley, and raise their concerns about the controversial system.</p>
      <p>VAR has been dogged with issues since being introduced at the start of this season, but the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/barclays-premier-league">Premier League</a> and PGMOL say they are committed to improving the consistency of decisions, speeding up the processes, and increasing the communication to supporters inside stadiums.</p>
      <p>The changes are set to come into effect from the start of next month.</p>
      <h3>Speed and consistency</h3>
      <p>Riley has earmarked the speed and consistency of decision-making as “priority areas of work”.</p>
      <p>The referees’ chief has stated that this will improve as officials become more experienced with the technology and protocols, and reaffirmed the ‘clear and obvious test’ for subjective decisions to narrow the area of debate.</p>
      <h3>Information for fans</h3>
      <p>It has been agreed that more information will be made available for supporters inside stadiums, as well viewers watching at home.</p>
      <p>Reasons for checks will be explained in more detail – for example, a VAR graphic stating “Checking Penalty” under the current process will say “Checking Penalty – Possible Handball” from next month.</p>
      <p>The definitive clip or image for overturned decisions will continue to be shown in stadiums, but under IFAB protocol, video clips or stills cannot be shown in stadiums until the referee has made a decision.</p>
      <p>The same protocol also means direct audio communication from the referee or VAR official is not permitted.</p>
      <h3>Pitchside monitors</h3>
      <p>Use of pitchside monitors, or Referee Review Areas, was also under discussion, with it being reemphasised that they would be reserved for unseen incidents, or when information from the VAR is outside the expectation range of the referee.</p>
      <p>The PGMOL are keen to ensure the pace and tempo of Premier League games remains an important focus for clubs, with “minimum interference for maximum benefit”.</p>
      <p>The clubs agreed that VAR should be under constant review, and research will now take place with fans and other relevant stakeholders to gauge how VAR could be improved.</p>
      <h3>Improvement in accuracy</h3>
      <p>Clubs were told at the meeting that the introduction of VAR has “improved the accuracy of match officials around ‘key match incidents’ (KMI)”.</p>
      <p>Last season, officials achieved 82 per cent KMI accuracy, with that figure rising to 91 per cent with VAR this season.</p>
