      <h1>Let telecos pay taxes on mobile money transaction fees</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T18:44:51+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 18:44</time> by <a rel="author">Godwill Arthur-Mensah, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Accra, Nov. 14, GNA - Mrs Ursula Owusu-Ekuful, the Communications Minister on Thursday implored the Finance Minister and the Ghana Revenue Authority to let telecommunication companies pay taxes on fees they receive on mobile money transactions.</p>
      <p>Currently, the telecommunication companies charge one per cent transaction fees on every mobile money transaction and generate GH¢71 million per month.</p>
      <p>Addressing the media in Accra, to update the public on the Common Platform that monitors the activities of telecos, Mrs Owusu-Ekuful said telecos ought to pay taxes on monies they earned on transaction fees so that government in turn would provide the requisite developmental projects to the people.</p>
      <p>The Minister noted that apart from saving the nation millions of dollars, the platform also offered real-time monitoring of 2.5 billion transactions per day within the telecom sector, including; calls, SMS and monitoring of mobile money transactions as an added component.</p>
      <p>Besides, the platform saved the nation GH¢205.6 million from the fraud management component since its inception and expected to deliver tax savings of approximately GH¢795.9 million.</p>
      <p>On mobile money monitoring, it reported an average monthly usage of GH¢29.1 billion and GH¢195.8 million transactions, with the Mobile Network Operators generating GH¢71 million per month in transaction fees.</p>
      <p>Mrs Owusu-Ekuful observed that prior to the introduction of the platform, the nation lost GH¢300 million in taxes between 2015 and the first quarter of 2017 due to potential under declaration, while an estimated GH¢470 million was saved in taxes between March 2017 and to date, while a potential GH¢1.5 billion would have been lost, if the platform had not been implemented.</p>
