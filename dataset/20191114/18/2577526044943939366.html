      <h1>A Complete List of Video Games I Played on Paternity Leave</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T18:40:49+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 18:40</time> by <a rel="author">Jason Schreier</a></address>
      <p>I had a baby a couple months ago, and I took a few weeks off work to hang out with her. Mostly that meant giving her bottles, changing her nappies, and holding her on my lap as I played video games, because it turns out there’s nothing babies hate more than NOT being held at any given moment.</p>
      <p>Here, in no particular order, are the video games I played during leave, along with my thoughts and what I assume were my daughter’s thoughts at the time.</p>
      <h3>Dishonored 2</h3>
      <p>I played a tonne of Arkane’s immersive sim back when it came out in 2016 but never finished it, so I figured I’d give it another chance. Just like the first time, I loved it until I got to the Royal Conservatory, which was annoying enough to make me put it on pause for a while.</p>
      <p><b>My daughter’s review: </b>“Either those witches can see through walls or you just suck at stealth games, daddy.”</p>
      <h3>Dark Souls 3</h3>
      <p>Just a great game – it’s always fun to jump into a <i>Souls </i>and re-familiarize yourself with the level design, play for an hour or so, and maybe kill a boss or two along the way.</p>
      <p><b>My daughter’s review: </b>“I may be only three weeks old but this generic medieval fantasy feels a little trite to me. Do we really need more games with knights and dragons? I prefer the Lovecraftian undertones of <i>Bloodborne</i> and am very much looking forward to seeing what <i>Elden Ring</i> has in store. Miyazaki AND George R.R. Martin? I mean, come on.”</p>
      <h3>Pillars of Eternity 2</h3>
      <p>I bounced off <i>Pillars 2</i> when it first came out in 2018, mostly because I’d just played the superb <i>Divinity: Original Sin 2.</i> But the developers at Obsidian added a turn-based mode earlier this year that completely changes the way the game feels to play, very much for the better.</p>
      <p><b>My daughter’s review: </b>“I appreciate the evocative way this game builds a living, breathing world and fills it up with culture and history, but all those accents and proper nouns can get a little distracting. Also, I just pooped all over my onesie.”</p>
      <h3>Disco Elysium</h3>
      <p>This game captivated my attention right from the start and never let go. You can read my full review <a href="https://www.kotaku.co.uk/2019/11/08/disco-elysium-the-kotaku-review">here</a>.</p>
      <p><b>My daughter’s review: </b>“When I grow up, I also want to be ‘an absolute disaster of a human being.’”</p>
      <h3>Final Fantasy VIII Remastered</h3>
      <p>I was really into my latest playthrough of <i>Final Fantasy VIII</i> on Switch – and the remastered version is well done! – until I died to a cheap attack and lost an hour of progress, which is just not something I can tolerate in 2019.</p>
      <p><b>My daughter’s review:</b> “The Draw system is fundamentally broken and a tedious waste of time. Also, I just dropped my dummy and I’m going to scream my head off until you put it back in my mouth.”</p>
      <h3>Death Stranding</h3>
      <p>I’m glad this game exists, but it’s not for me. Especially not right now. As soon as it told me I had to soothe a crying baby, I turned it off.</p>
      <p><b>My daughter’s review:</b> “How DARE you hang out with other babies.”</p>
      <h3>Destiny 2</h3>
      <p><i>Shadowkeep </i>came out while I was on leave, so obviously I had to do that. I find myself less enamoured of <i>Destiny</i> these days than I have been in the past, but I don’t think I’ll ever stop jumping back in whenever they release new story content.</p>
      <p><b>My daughter’s review: </b>“Daddy, you’ve played more hours of this game than I’ve been alive. Reconsider your life choices.”</p>
      <h3>The Witcher 3</h3>
      <p>When I first played <i>The Witcher 3</i> I was on PS4, but since then I’ve built a gaming PC, and my lord, playing at 1440p/60+fps just makes such a big difference. I’ve really enjoyed hanging out with Geralt again in the swamps and hills of war-torn Velen.</p>
      <p><b>My daughter’s review:</b> “Cool game. But I just have one question: Why would a thriving media company purposefully sabotage one of its strongest assets, costing itself countless amounts of revenue and irrevocably damaging staff morale? I need a bottle.”</p>
