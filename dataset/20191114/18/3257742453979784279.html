      <p>HomeKit Secure Video allows users to safely store activity detected by the Circle 2 in iCloud and view live and recorded video from their Circle 2 camera in the Apple Home app on an <a href="http://appleinsider.com/topic/iphone">iPhone,</a> <a href="http://appleinsider.com/topic/ipad">iPad</a> or <a href="http://appleinsider.com/topic/mac">Mac,</a> according to the <a href="https://blog.logitech.com/2019/11/14/circle-2-now-works-with-apple-homekit-secure-video/">Logitech press release.</a><br/><br/>Apple will store up to <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/10/08/homekit-secure-video-features-interface-leaked-from-apple-store-ipad">ten days of recordings</a> inside of iCloud for one camera if subscribed to the 200GB iCloud Storage Plan, and will store up to ten days of recordings for five cameras if on the 2TB iCloud Storage Plan.</p>
