      <h1>Brave Urges Congress to Require Ad Blocking Browsers for Govt Employees</h1>

      <p>In a letter to the U.S. Congress, Brave urged Homeland Security Committee members to make it mandatory for all federal employees to use a browser that blocks advertising by default. </p>
      <p>Brave states that without a browser that blocks ads by default, federal employees would be vulnerable to malvertising, which could allow foreign and domestic threat actors to gain access to government devices or a foothold in sensitive networks.</p>
      <p>"I represent Brave, a rapidly growing Internet browser based in San Francisco. Brave’s CEO, Brendan Eich, is the inventor of JavaScript, and co-founded Mozilla/Firefox. Brave is headquartered in San Francisco. I write to urge action to protect federal agency and employee computers and devices from cyberattacks by foreign state actors and criminals through “malvertising”."</p>
      <p>Brave's letter also includes letters from U.S. Senator Ron Wyden, who since 2017 has been urging the federal government to take a stronger stance regarding the blocking of malicious advertisements.</p>
      <p>One year ago, on November 16, 2017, I wrote to then-White House Cybersecurity Coordinator, Rob Joyce, regarding the threat posed by foreign government hackers using online advertisements to deliver malware to the computers of federal workers. In that letter, I urged the administration to direct DHS to require federal agencies to block delivery of all internet ads containing executable computer code to employees computers. In its response on April 20, 2018, DHS stated that it was continuing to investigate these risks and working with representatives from the online advertising industry to address this threat.</p>
      <p>In June 2018, the National Security Agency (NSA) issued public guidance related to the threat posed by malicious advertisements. In the attached document, which NSA published on its website, the agency observed that advertising has been a known malware distribution vector for over a decade and as such, the agency recommends that organizations address this risk by blocking potentially malicious, internet-based advertisements.</p>
      <p>As Brave sent <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6549463-Letter-to-Senate-and-Congress-to-Homeland.html">this letter</a> on the same day they officially released Brave Browser 1.0, this can be seen as a clever marketing ploy by the browser developers.</p>
      <p>Included in the letter is a browser comparison table that outlines the security features found in each browser, with the chart showing Brave as having the best security of them all. </p>

      <p>While Brave is a terrific browser with excellent security features, this letter's clever marketing and obvious self-promotion can be summed up by the last sentence from Brave to the committee members.</p>
      <p>"Allow me to take this opportunity to draw to your attention that Brave 1.0 launches on all platforms today"</p>
      <h3>Malvertising is a problem</h3>
      <p>While Brave's letter to Congress can be seen as a marketing ploy, it is not without merit.</p>
      <p>In discussion with Confiant's <a href="https://twitter.com/eliyastein">Eliya Stein</a>, BleepingComputer was told that their fraud and malicious ad filtering platform commonly blocks malvertising campaigns on mainstream ads.</p>
      <p>"It absolutely makes it into mainstream advertising. We have actually seen an increase in desktop targeted malvertising, and that is more likely to take a victim to something like a fake flash installer. Those are all malware."</p>
      <p>In most of these mainstream campaigns, Stein told BleepingComputer that the malware is delivered through sites that promote fake updates for Adobe, Flash, and other programs. When installed, though, they deliver information-stealing Trojans, scareware, browser extension that track your browsing, <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fake-adobe-flash-update-sites-pushing-cpu-miners/">miners</a>, <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/locky-ransomware-being-distributed-through-fake-flash-player-update-sites/">ransomware</a>, and <a href="https://blog.confiant.com/osx-shlayer-new-shurprise-unveiling-osx-tarmac-f965a32de887">malware downloaders</a>. </p>
      <p>It is even worse on low quality ad networks used on web games, adware redirects, and adult video sites as actors behind exploit kits commonly used them to infect victims.</p>
      <p>Over the past few month, exploit kit researchers have been sharing a constant stream of reports about exploit kits being used to <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/maze-ransomware-now-delivered-by-spelevo-exploit-kit/">install ransomware,</a> information-stealing Trojans, and Remote Access Trojans (RATs) on victim's computer without their knowledge.</p>

      <p>Any of these malware payloads could have disastrous effects on a government network, whether it be the encryption of critical workstations or allowing threat actors access to internal networks.</p>
