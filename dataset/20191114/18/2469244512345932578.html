      <h1>Early Christmas presents help bring festive cheer to Eastern Europe</h1>
      <h2>Residents across Tiverton and the Culm Valley have been donating hundreds of shoeboxes full of goodies</h2>

      <p>Underprivileged families, children and elderly in Romania have been given an early Christmas present thanks generous Tivertonians.</p>
      <p>Gelvin Williams and Steve Gardner drove to Hunedoara, Transylvania, with 264 shoeboxes containing Christmas gifts and items on November 5.</p>
      <p>Steve said: “it’s something we do every year, but we don’t usually take the shoeboxes ourselves as we put them on a lorry.</p>
      <p>“I’m looking forward to seeing old friends and being able to have the first-hand experience of delivering all those really lovely things people have donated.</p>
      <p>“The boxes have come from various sources, from church groups, schools, and a whole host of people in the community who have given. So many people have been involved.”</p>
      <p>Gelvin, who is a firefighter in Tiverton, thanked Safe South West for donating £250 towards expenses.</p>
      <p>He added: “We took a fire engine a couple of years ago and trained up some of the volunteer firefighters over there. We did some community safety, took over 250 smoke alarms and carbon monoxide alarms. Their lifestyle is a little different there, the risks are higher, and that’s why we took the fire engine.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile residents in Hemyock have also been collecting boxes of their own for the Christian Response to Eastern Europe (cr2ee) for Moldova.</p>

      <p>As well as collecting almost 150 boxes of presents for all ages and families the village was able to deliver more than 100 jumpers, 50 pairs of gloves, 50 hats, 21 large blankets and 34 bags of clothes and other humanitarian aid. This was thanks to knitters in the upper Culm Valley and as far as Dunkeswell, Morchard Bishop, Tiverton, Wellington to the other side of Taunton.</p>
      <p>Janice Bawler, from Hemyock said: “Many will know we have a seven-seater car which was filled with the boxes whilst a trailer 8x4 feet and a roof box were also full. It took almost 20 minutes for everything to be unloaded with the help of the cr2ee volunteers at the Exmouth collection point.</p>
      <p>“For a variety of reasons 2019 has seen a remarkable amount of clothing and bedding donated to this charity whose members visit Moldova throughout the year and we have felt privileged to take your gifts to them to distribute to one of the world’s poorest countries.</p>
      <p>“It is hoped that although it is not yet possible to confirm a date, we will be able to arrange early next year a speaker with video of this year’s distribution of your gifts. Please look out for details in the local press, posters and social media.”</p>
