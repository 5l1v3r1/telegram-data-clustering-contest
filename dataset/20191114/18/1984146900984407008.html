      <p>As the cold winter months draw closer, food banks are facing an increased demand to help struggling North East families.</p>
      <p>After volunteering at the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/foodbanks">West End Food Bank,</a> Masitano Sichon saw first hand how it is helping people get by.</p>
      <p>Now, the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-university">Newcastle University</a> graduate has launched an app to help the food bank through the festive period.</p>
      <p>Users who download the app get notifications when the food bank is low on essential items.</p>
      <p>Masitano, who has a master's degree in in E-Business, said: "While volunteering I noticed that there were certain types of food that came in that they didn't have a lot of.</p>
      <p>"They had no way to exactly tell people what they needed to be donated.</p>
      <p>"They do have wish lists in supermarkets but sometimes they don't get updated.</p>
      <p>"I thought that in this world of tech, why don’t we have a more up-to-date digital solution.</p>
      <p>"I came up with the idea of an app to replace their traditional methods and to create an extra channel to get more food."</p>

      <p>The app, called Spareable, allows food banks to notify people which essentials they are low on.</p>
      <p>People can then purchase the items to make a donation which are then delivery directly from wholesalers to the food banks.</p>
      <p>In 2017, Masitano pitched his idea at a boot camp event at Newcastle University as part of their START UP programme which offers support to students and recent graduates.</p>
      <p>And after winning the competition, the budding entrepreneur was awarded a foundership from the university who provided him with support and funding to help them bring his ideas to life over the next six months.</p>
      <p>After launching in August this year, Spareable has received an amazing response with more than 300 people using it and as a result the food donations to West End Food Bank have increased by 25%.</p>
      <p>John McCorry, chief executive at The West End Food Bank, said: "We are really grateful for every donation we receive but find that we do have a lack of donations of essential items such as long life milk, tinned rice or jams.</p>
      <p>"We are now running into the busy months from November to February with the demand increasing by a third.</p>
      <p>"Part of the reason for this is the demand on family budgets over the holiday period, people will pay for gifts for their children before eating.</p>
      <p>"Masitano’s app has been really helpful as the app is useful for people with busy lifestyles and easy to use, and it has helped us to reach out to a new market of people."</p>
      <p>Following the success of the app, Mansitano is now determined to reach out to more food banks across the UK.</p>
