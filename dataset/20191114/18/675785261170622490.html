      <h1>Sam Allardyce snubs FA invitation to attend England's 1000th game celebration</h1>
      <h2>COLUMN: Allardyce was on the guest list for Thursday night's match against Montenegro, but the FA never heard back from the former Three Lions boss</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T18:45:19+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 18:45</time> by <a rel="author">John Cross, https://www.facebook.com/johncrossmirror/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/sam-allardyce">Sam Allardyce</a> was invited by <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/the-fa">the Football Association</a> to attend the 1,000th England game celebrations.</p>
      <p>Despite only being in charge for one game and losing his job amid a major scandal, the FA wanted to make sure Allardyce and all ex-managers, former captains and those with over 50 caps were on the guest list.</p>
      <p>However, unsurprisingly, Big Sam did not reply and the FA never heard back from the manager whose reign lasted for just one game before he was sacked following a newspaper sting.</p>
      <p>There was surprise at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/sven-goran-eriksson">Sven Goran Eriksson’s</a> claim that he was not invited as the FA have an e-mail which went to the ex-England boss’s inbox.</p>

      <p>Gary Lineker could not attend as he was taking his traditional holiday in the international break away from Match of the Day duties while David Beckham was on a business trip to Asia and could not go.</p>
      <p>Legends like Wayne Rooney and Peter Shilton were all invited and given a silver plate in a presentation by FA chairman Greg Clarke in a suite before the game and that will now be the norm for every player in future as soon as they pass 50 caps.</p>

      <h3>Emery's mark on Arsenal's pre-match routine</h3>

      <p>Unai Emery has implemented his own pre-match routine for away games.</p>
      <p>Back in Arsene Wenger’s glory days, Arsenal would often go up the day before night matches whereas now they often fly up on the day of games rather than catch the train as, for example, they jetted into Doncaster on the day of the Sheffield United game last month.</p>
      <p>They have also begun using a Hilton Hotel closer to the Emirates rather than staying at the Four Seasons in Canary Wharf and, while they are having a purge on spending at the club, it has not reached first team level and any change to travel plans is Emery’s choice rather than cutbacks.</p>
      <p>Arsenal spent big in the summer - including £72million on record signing Nicolas Pepe - and, despite it being underwritten by owner Stan Kroenke they definitely splashed the cash in the hope it would get them back into the top four.</p>
      <p>It has been a difficult season at Arsenal but there was still surprise at Steve Morrow, a club legend and head of youth scouting, being marched off the premises after being axed.</p>

      <h3>Sterling set for warm welcome in Kosovo</h3>

      <p>Raheem Sterling has had a difficult week to say the least - but can expect a warm welcome in Kosovo where he will be recalled to England’s starting line-up.</p>
      <p>One clothes shop in Pristina has put up a giant poster of Sterling with the headline “Miresevjen Broo” which translates to “Welcome Brother” and has been championed by the group Kosovars Against Racism.</p>
      <p>Amid all of the furore over Sterling, what has been lost is Joe Gomez’s behaviour after their row in the England players’ canteen at St George’s Park.</p>
      <p>Gomez has conducted himself impeccably, accepted Sterling’s apology and moved on, even urging Gareth Southgate not to take punishment against his England team mate.</p>

      <p>James, 19, said: “I look forward to a great partnership with Roc Nation who will manage my off-the-pitch activities as only they can.”</p>
      <h3>New job for ex-Reading chief Gomes</h3>
      <p>Former Reading boss Jose Gomes, who performed miracles to keep them in the Championship last season, is back in management with CS Maritimo.</p>
      <p>He has signed until the end of the season with an option for another year.</p>
