      <h1>Ireland U19s lose opening European qualifier to Switzerland</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T18:39:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 18:39</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/digital-desk-staff/" target="_blank">By Digital Desk staff</a></address>
      <p>The Republic of Ireland have lost the opening game of their UEFA Under-19 European Championship qualifiers 2-1 to Switzerland in Salzburg.</p>
      <p>Goals from Julian Vonmoos and Lorent Tolaj were enough to completed the turnaround from Oisin McEntee’s early goal with Ireland ending the match with 10 men following Mazeed Ogungbo’s 65th-minute dismissal for a second yellow card.</p>
      <p>The game had been due to take place Wednesday afternoon but heavy snow in Austria meant the game was postponed until today.</p>
      <p>It had been the dream start for Ireland when they took an early lead. Armstrong Oko-Flex crossed in from a short corner and McEntee provided the back-post finish to give Tom Mohan’s side a superb lead.</p>
      <p>From that moment on, Switzerland grew into the game. On 12 minutes they had a great opportunity when Vonmoos went one-on-one but Jimmy Corcoran was quick to close down the advancing attacker and the ball went harmlessly wide.</p>
      <p>Halfway through the first half the Swiss had another chance when Felix Mambimbi collected a fine chip over the top, however, he saw his effort from inside the 18-yard-box deflect over the bar.</p>
      <p>Ireland battled hard to preserve their lead and did well to thwart any threats from the Swiss attack and went in at the break ahead.</p>
      <p>In the second half, Switzerland continued the pressure and they got back on level terms on 57 minutes. Vonmoos took advantage of a counter-attack from an Ireland free-kick and the Basel forward was able to apply the finish.</p>
      <p>Less than 10 minutes later came a big moment in the game. Ogbungo, who had already received a caution, was shown a second yellow card by referee Kirill Levnikov and sent off.</p>
      <p>On 79 minutes came what proved to be the winning goal. Substitute Tolaj, who had only been on the pitch a matter of minutes, reacted fastest to a rebounded shot to convert his effort.</p>
      <p>Despite being a man down Ireland had several chances to equalise late on. First Oko-Flex had his shot well saved by Nils De Mol. Then Mark McGuinness' header found Thomas Cannon for an overhead kick but De Mol was equal to that too.</p>
      <p>Mohan’s side now face a crucial game on Saturday against Gibraltar in Straßwalchen at 12pm (Irish time).</p>
      <p>Ireland: Corcoran; Ebosele, Ogungbo, McGuinness, McEntee (C); O’Reilly, Everitt (Gilbert 46), Coffey, Noss (Cannon 86), Oko-Flex (Richards 67); Cassidy (Wright 86)</p>
      <p>Switzerland: De Mol; Frei, Mistrafovic, Stergiou, Omeragic; Sohm (C) (Cuemi 90+1, Males (Vasic 65), Jankewitz; Vonmoos (Bunjaku 90+1), Azevedo, Mambimbi (Tolaj 74)</p>
      <p>Referee: Kirill Levnikov (Russia)</p>
