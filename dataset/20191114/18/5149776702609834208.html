      <h1>Major FFP blow for Nottingham Forest's Championship rivals</h1>
      <h2>The Owls could face serious sanctions after the EFL charged them with breaking the financial rules</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T18:03:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 18:03</time> by <a rel="author">Barry Cooper, Elliott Jackson</a></address>
      <p>Sheffield Wednesday have become the latest Championship club to be charged with breaking financial rules by the English Football League.</p>
      <p>The governing body announced on Thursday evening that the Owls had been charged with multiple breaches of EFL rules.</p>
      <p>In a statement on Thursday evening, the EFL wrote: "Following a formal investigation into financial information provided by Sheffield Wednesday in relation to the Club’s 2017/18 Profitability and Sustainability (P&amp;S) submission, the EFL has today issued a number of charges relating to alleged breaches of EFL Rules.</p>
      <p>"Earlier this year the EFL launched an investigation into the Club’s financial submission for the period ending July 2018 under the relevant P&amp;S Rules following the completion of the sale of Hillsborough Stadium.</p>

      <p>“The EFL has reviewed a large number of documents obtained from the Club as part of this process and concluded there is sufficient evidence to justify issuing charges of Misconduct. The charges are in respect of a number of allegations regarding the process of how and when the stadium was sold and the inclusion of the profits in the 2017/18 accounts.</p>
      <p>"All charges will be considered by an independent Disciplinary Commission and, if the charges are proven, the Commission can impose any of the sanctions set out in EFL Regulation 92.2.</p>
      <p>"The EFL Board has previously agreed and communicated with all Championship Clubs a set of sanctioning guidelines, but the Commission, under EFL Regulations, has the ability to invoke a full range of sanctions should the breach be confirmed.</p>
      <p>"The EFL continues to review the Club’s 2018/19 P&amp;S submissions.</p>

      <p>As these matters are now subject to proceedings, the EFL will be making no further comment at this time."</p>
      <p>The Owls, in turn, responded with a statement of their own, reading: "Sheffield Wednesday note the statement issued today by the EFL and the charges contained within.</p>
      <p>"These charges will be vigorously defended and the Club will be making no further comment at this time."</p>
      <p>Birmingham City became the first Championship club to be docked points as they received a nine-point deduction in the 2018/19 season for breaching Financial Fair Play rules, while Forest found themselves under a transfer embargo previously.</p>
      <p>Under EFL Regulation 92.2, as quoted in the EFL's statement, Wednesday could face the same fate, which would prove a massive blow to Gary Monk's play-off chasing side, who sit 8th in the Championship table after 16 matches.</p>
