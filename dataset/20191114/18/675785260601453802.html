      <h1>Hector Bellerin monitoring how Arsenal's season plays out amid transfer interest from Italy</h1>
      <h2>The Spanish defender is a long-term target for Juventus and Bellerin's agent has admitted one club has already been in contact over a potential move</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T18:31:13+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 18:31</time> by <a rel="author">Darren Wells, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/darren-wells/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/hector-bellerin">Hector Bellerin's</a> agent has stated his client is 'seeing how the season goes' at Arsenal after receiving transfer interest from Italy.</p>
      <p>The Gunners full-back has only recently returned to regular action after suffering a serious knee injury back in January.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> have struggled so far this season, despite their current standing of sixth in the Premier League table.</p>
      <p>And with potential options opening up in Serie A for Bellerin, it seems he may well be inclined to jump ship next summer.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.football-italia.net/146441/agent-italian-club-wanted-bellerin">Sky Sports Italia</a>, Bellerin's agent Alberto Botines said: "At the moment, he’s focused on the team's commitments.</p>

      <p>“He comes from a bad injury and is returning to his usual level. He likes Italy, there’s already been interest from an Italian club but I can’t reveal it.</p>
      <p>“He has a long contract and it won’t be easy to take him away from Arsenal, he’s their vice-captain.</p>
      <p>“We’ll see how the season goes.”</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/juventus-fc">Juventus</a> are long-term admirers of the Spaniard, who joined Arsenal's youth system in 2011 from <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fc-barcelona">Barcelona</a>.</p>
      <p>Bellerin has developed into a key figure at the Emirates, hence boss Unai Emery's decision to make him part of the captain's group after Granit Xhaka's outburst cost him the armband.</p>
      <p>Speaking at the time, Bellerin said: "It’s been a tough couple of weeks in terms of the results but I always say the thing with football and especially in a club like Arsenal is you have the chance to redeem yourself every two, three days."</p>
      <p>Arsenal have opportunities to turn their fortunes around after the international break, with a string of fixtures that could prove pivotal to Emery's job.</p>
      <p>They start with home clashes against relegation battlers <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/southampton-fc">Southampton</a>, followed by Eintracht Frankfurt in the Europa League, before a trip to bottom club Norwich.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brighton-and-hove-albion-fc">Brighton</a> then travel to the Emirates before an away tie with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a>, both of whom are currently in the bottom half.</p>
