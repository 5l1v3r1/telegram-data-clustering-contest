      <h1>Groote Schuur Hospital Gets New Facility To Fight TB</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T18:16:20+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 18:16</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.iafrica.com/author/suzziegitau/" target="_blank">SG Editor</a></address>
      <p>The establishment of a new medical diagnostic facility at Groote Schuur Hospital is set to drastically improve the study and treatment of tuberculosis.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, a pet-CT scanner was unveiled at the hospital. According to clinicians, computed tomography is an imaging method that combines the body’s metabolic information with the morphological data obtained by the CT scan.</p>
      <p>The Western Cape has the highest tuberculosis prevalence rate in the world.</p>
      <p>But with the rollout of the new pet-CT facility, which is jointly run by the University of Cape Town and Groote Schuur Hospital, it’s hoped TB treatment will be vastly improved.</p>
      <p>UCT medicine department head Ntobeko Ntusi said: “We’ll see how we can use this to better understand disease and tuberculosis.”</p>
      <p>Health MEC Nomafrench Mbombo highlighted the importance of collaboration.</p>
      <p>“Partnership is about sharing skills, expertise and resources, as well the risks.”</p>
      <p>Funding to establish, the scanner was donated by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Technology Innovation Agency, Aspen Holdings and UCT.</p>
