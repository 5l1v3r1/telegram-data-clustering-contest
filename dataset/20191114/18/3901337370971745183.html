      <p>While he did not give a conclusive medical report on his Mamelodi Sundowns midfield duo, coach Pitso Mosimane this week suggested a likely return date for the injured pair of Themba Zwane and Gaston Sirino.</p>
      <p>They both sat out Sundowns’ 3-2 defeat against Golden Arrows in an Absa Premiership clash played at a rain-soaked Sugar Ray Xulu Stadium as the weekend.</p>

      <p>Zwane was also forced to withdraw from the Bafana Bafana squad that travelled to Ghana for an Africa Cup of Nations qualifier on tonight.</p>
      <p>“We refreshed the team and kept (Tiyani) Mabunda and (Hlompho) Kekana out as well as (Lebo) Maboe. We needed to freshen up the team. And we also had (Sibusiso) Vilakazi on the bench because we believed in the team that played could beat Arrows, and the first half said that,” Mosimane told reporters.</p>
      <p>The coach added that he expected them to return after the Fifa international break – ahead of Downs returning to the same venue for the Telkom Knockout semifinal clash on November 23.</p>
      <p>“We need to keep our players ready for the programme that’s coming – obviously the Fifa break will give us some time to get Themba Zwane back and Gaston Sirino back, hopefully. When we come back here next time we will be at full force. We controlled the match and we believed that the players we fielded can do the job,” Mosimane said.</p>
