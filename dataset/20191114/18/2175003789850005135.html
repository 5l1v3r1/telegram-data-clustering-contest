      <h1>Huawei Y9s and Band 4 Launched in Kenya: See Specs and Price</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T18:40:13+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 18:40</time> by <a rel="author">Clinton Madegwa</a></address>
      <p>Huawei is no doubt one of the top players in Kenya’s mobile industry. In a market where flagship smartphones cost <a href="https://www.dignited.com/51379/top-5-smartphones-under-kes-30000-in-august-2019/">not more than Ksh 40,000</a>, it is clear that the mid-range segment is vibrant. I mean look at just how popular Huawei Y9 2019 is.</p>
      <p>Competition in the mid-range segment of the market is still. Players like OPPO, Samsung, Nokia, TECNO and Infinix aren’t pulling punches.</p>
      <p>Today, Huawei is throwing yet another hat in the ring with the launch of the Huawei Y9s in Kenya.</p>
