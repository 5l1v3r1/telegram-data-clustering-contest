      <p>“Aussie Aussie Aussie Oi Oi Oi!” Perry said in an Instagram post using the Australian sporting chant.</p>
      <p>“Let’s break some records - join me in Melbourne on March 8, 2020 for the ICC @T20WorldCup Women’s Final. We’ll Roar in support of these awesome women on International Women’s Day!”</p>
      <p>The International Cricket Council said Perry would perform both before and after the final in “what is anticipated to be the biggest women’s cricket match of all time.”</p>
      <p>It said it was an opportunity to set a new world attendance record at a women’s sporting fixture.</p>
      <p>The current record crowd of 90,185 was set at the 1999 FIFA Women’s World Cup final in Pasadena, California. </p>
