      <p>Singer <a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/Eric%20Nam">Eric Nam</a> recently held a press conference for his upcoming <a href="https://www.allkpop.com/article/2019/11/listen-to-a-highlight-medley-of-eric-nams-first-all-english-album-before-we-begin">full-english album</a>.</p>
      <p>During the conference, he was asked to comment on the ongoing vote-rigging controversies surrounding the '<b>Produce</b>' series, as he also made his debut through an audition program.</p>
      <p>To this, Eric Nam first shared that he does not know the details about the issue as he was too busy in preparation for his new album.</p>
      <p>Instead, he left a message for the members of the final project groups of 'Produce 48' and 'Produce X 101'―<a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/IZ*ONE">IZ*ONE</a> and <a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/X1">X1</a>.</p>
      <p>He said, <i>"Those kids would probably be extremely anxious, and they must be having a hard time now. I hope they can find strength and that everything gets resolved. I honestly don't know the details, but I really hope them to find strength."</i></p>
