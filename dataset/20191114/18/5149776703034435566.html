      <h1>Sixth former's work on climate change has led to academy launching scheme to ditch plastic</h1>
      <h2>Nathaniel McLaughlin, 16, has led a host of projects on the issue</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T18:58:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 18:58</time> by <a rel="author">Matthew Bunn</a></address>
      <p>At just 16 years of age, inspirational sixth former Nathaniel McLaughlin has already led a host of impressive projects to tackle climate change - not just at his school but within the local community.</p>
      <p>Thanks to the <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/sneinton">Sneinton</a> student’s tireless research and hard work, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/special-features/nottingham-academy-enables-pupils-flourish-3375336">Nottingham Academy</a> is introducing a new scheme to completely eliminate plastic across all its sites by spring term 2020</p>
      <p>Nathaniel has also helped create a new greener waste disposal system at the academy, as well as working with local schools and businesses to increase awareness and share new eco ideas.</p>
      <p>And to top it all, Nathaniel has recently been announced as one of 50 new ambassadors for the national campaign #iWill - a scheme run by the Prince of Wales to empower dynamic young people to take part in positive social action.</p>
      <p>No wonder he’s also been nominated in the ‘keeping it green’ category of this year’s Nottinghamshire Live Education Awards.</p>
      <p>Nathaniel, who is studying for A levels in geography, sociology and philosophy at Nottingham Academy, first became interested in the environment three years ago when he watched a series of videos on the internet showing the stark impact of climate change on the planet.</p>
      <p>“I guess it was that which led to me to want to tackle the issue head on,” he explained.</p>
      <p>Inspired by science teacher Sarjit Gidda - who won last year’s ‘inspirational teacher of the year’ category at the Education Awards - Nathaniel had already become a keen diversity and equality campaigner.</p>
      <p>Deciding to use the skills he’d developed for green issues seemed the next logical step.</p>

      <p>He said: “The first thing I really tackled was the use of plastic in the canteens at school.</p>
      <p>“I wanted to reduce plastic use and I had to do my research and then present my ideas for a compostable alternative to members of the senior team at the academy and in front of the education trust.”</p>
      <p>Thanks to Nathaniel’s determination, the academy is now committed to having zero plastic across all sites by spring term 2020.</p>
      <p>Working alongside big organisations such as Ward Recycling and Severn Trent, he is also organising the introduction of commercial composting and improved waste disposal systems at school.</p>
      <p>“We’re introducing a totally new waste disposal system, turning food waste into fertiliser," Nathaniel explained.</p>
      <p>“We’re going to have compostable packaging in canteens and we’ll hopefully have recycling bins and composting bins across all sites by 2021.”</p>
      <p>Since early 2019, the teenager has been working with a number of businesses to lessen their environmental impact - with The Avenues Cafe in Sneinton currently taking advantage of his tips on introducing greener ways of working.</p>
      <p>At the same time, Nathaniel has teamed up with art education organisation PicMeUp Shuffle and Nottingham City Council to push for on-street recycling bins in Bakersfield.</p>
      <p>And he’s even helped deliver lessons to primary school pupils about how their actions affect the environment.</p>
      <p>Nathaniel says he gets a little nervous having to stand up in front of panels and organisations to present his ideas - but it’s worth it when he gets one of his schemes up and running.</p>
      <p>“It’s nerve-racking but the teams here at Nottingham Academy are very open minded and they have a great outlook for the future,” he said.</p>
      <p>As for his new ambassador role, Nathaniel is looking forward to making a real difference, with new opportunities to meet top decision makers and CEOs of large companies.</p>
      <p>He said: “It’s going to be great to attend more events and raise the profile of environmental issues to more people.”</p>
      <p>Fellow student Jasmine Karakoyunlu was amongst those nominating Nathaniel for the Nottinghamshire Live Education Awards 2019.</p>
      <p>She said: “Nathaniel is a hard working, determined and ambitious individual and I admire him for all the work he has done. He has a passion for his projects and this is shown throughout. He is an inspiration and definitely deserves this award.”</p>
      <p>Nathaniel said: “It’s overwhelming to be nominated and I’m very grateful. It’s not really the point of my work but also it’s always great to be recognised.”  </p>
