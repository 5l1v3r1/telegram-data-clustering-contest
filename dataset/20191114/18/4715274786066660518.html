      <p>Viewers are excited to find out the answers to these questions as Wagas: Wait Lang…Is this LOVE? airs its finale tomorrow.</p>
      <p>Sandie is fuming after discovering that Cedrick has already developed true feelings for Yummy. </p>
      <p>To get her revenge, Sandie reveals everything—from the original plan to have Yummy fall for Cedrick so that they can sabotage Walang Kapares to the fact that everything was orchestrated by Rex (Rey PJ Abellana).</p>
      <p>Yummy and her aunts, Tita Gloria (Yayo Aguila) and Tita Sonya (Tina Paner), cannot believe that they played right into the hands of Rex. What’s worse is that Tita Gloria and Tita Sonya even had misunderstandings before because of Rex. </p>
      <p>It seems Walang Kapares is facing more problems. One customer complains that a cockroach is supposedly in the bowl of pares that has been served.</p>
      <p>The bad news does not end here. Walang Kapares catches fire and Yummy’s life is put in danger.</p>
      <p>Will Yummy get to turn their lives around or will another misfortune befall her?</p>
      <p>With all these devastating news, Eugene is quick to be right by Yummy’s side. Will he finally get his chance to win Yummy’s heart and will Yummy realize what real love is?</p>
      <p>Don’t miss the thrilling ending of Wagas: Wait Lang…Is this Love? before Eat Bulaga on GMA-7.</p>
