      <p>Aston Villa chief executive Christian Purslow says ‘grave concerns’ about video assistant referee (VAR) technology were raised at a Premier League meeting on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Purslow was <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa’s</a> representative at a conference held between top-flight clubs to discuss the use of VAR.</p>
      <p>Referees' chief Mike Riley led the discussion over the technology, which has caused weekly controversy since its introduction in the league at the start of the season.</p>

      <p>Purslow told Sky Sports: “I’ve got grave concerns, but so has everybody in the room. We had a very robust discussion.</p>
      <p>“The messages got though to the League and the Referees’ Association that fans are unhappy and many other stakeholders in the game think we’ve got to do a whole lot better.</p>
      <p>“I expect to see real improvement in the speed of decisions, consistency - which is what everybody craves - and I think above all else for those of us in stadia, we want much better communication of what’s going on before, during and after.</p>
      <p>“I think if we get those three ingredients then things will be a whole lot better in a a few months’ time.”</p>
