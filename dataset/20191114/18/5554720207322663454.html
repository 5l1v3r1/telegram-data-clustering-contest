The show is set to turn into a battlefield after Shehnaaz Gill destroys the rival team’s house. Devoleena will be seen slamming Hindustani Bhau for physically hurting her.</p>
      <p>The show will also see Paras Chhabra and Mahira going to jail. While inside the jail, Hindustani Bhau will reveal that Paras had once made fun of Mahira’s ‘big lips.’ Mahira will not take kindly to the revelation since Paras is someone she’s always considered as her best friend in the reality show up until now.</p>
