      <p>No one could ever forget Gene Simmons’ iconic <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=es1tGHY7R00">I Am Indy</a> promo song for the 2007 IndyCar season, but lost to the annals of time is the fact that another 1980s hair metal legend <i>also</i> had some ties with the American open-wheel scene. Mötley Crüe singer Vince Neil did, in fact, have a brief stint as a part-time race car driver in the 1992 Indy Lights season.</p>
      <p>A friend mentioned this mind-blowing fact to me last night, and it genuinely kept me up at night, much to my husband’s dismay (“Literally everyone who gave a fuck about open-wheel back then knew this. Everyone,” he told me, as if he was not a tiny baby fresh from the womb at the time and therefore would not know what it was personally like).</p>

      <p>Back in 1984, Neil was convicted of vehicular manslaughter after killing Razzle Dingley, drummer of the band Hanoi Rocks, while crashing head-on into another car while driving drunk. While he did admittedly get the rich person treatment of a mere <a href="https://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/music/motley-motorheadthe-only-crue-vince-neil-needs-these-days-is-in-the-pit-6426536">thirty days in jail</a> alongside $US2.6 ($4) million in lawsuits, it still serves as a pretty dark mark on the singer’s record.</p>
      <p>But by the time he <a href="https://www.racing-reference.info/rquery?id=neilvi01&amp;trk=t0&amp;series=IL">made his racing debut</a> at Phoenix International Raceway on April 4, 1992, Neil was clean and sober (yes, the first race track they sent this man out on was a goddamn <i>oval</i>). Jim Kofakis, vice president for the sanctioning body in charge of Indy Lights, <a href="https://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/music/motley-motorheadthe-only-crue-vince-neil-needs-these-days-is-in-the-pit-6426536">assured everyone</a> that Neil has passed all the requisite medical examinations and drug tests and would have to pass plenty more random tests throughout the season.</p>
      <p>But Neil made damn sure no one could think him the coked-out star he was just mere years ago. His P.I.G. Racing car was sponsored by Say No To Drugs, according to <a href="https://www.racing-reference.info/rquery?id=neilvi01&amp;trk=t0&amp;series=IL">Racing Reference</a>. But, just so no one could forget the crass cheekiness that hair metal artists were known for, his car number was #69. (Nice.)</p>

      <p>Neil started four races (Phoenix, Long Beach, Portland, and Milwaukee) in 1992 and finished three. With a best finish of tenth in Milwaukee, Neil took home five points at the end of the season, which saw him finish 23rd overall in the final championship standings. He earned a total of $US6,900 ($10,099) (<i>nice</i>) and called it quits.</p>
      <p>What blows my mind most about this whole thing is the fact that I spent most of high school being a massive Crüe fan. I read all the autobiographies, listened to all the music (yes, even <i>Generation Swine</i>), and even dressed up as Vince Neil for Halloween in like 2011. Somehow I remained entirely oblivious to the fact that my two main interests—race cars and hair metal—had actually briefly intertwined.</p>
      <p>So, for all of you out there who had no idea this brief moment in motorsport had happened—now you know.</p>
