      <h1>Wikipedia co-founder wants to give you an alternative to Facebook and Twitter</h1>
      <h2>WT:Social will be funded by user donations, not advertising.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T13:12:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 13:12</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.engadget.com/editors/christine-fisher" target="_blank">Christine Fisher</a></address>
      <p>Two years ago, Wikipedia co-founder <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/04/25/wikitribune-fake-news-jimmy-wales/">Jimmy Wales launched <i>Wikitribune</i></a>, an online publication meant to combat fake news with original stories by reporters and "citizen journalists." <i>Wikitribune</i> never really caught on, so now, Wales is shifting gears. <i>Wikitribune</i> is relaunching as <a href="https://wt.social/">WT:Social</a>, a social-networking site and news sharing platform. He hopes it will be an alternative to Facebook and Twitter.</p>
      <p>Like those platforms, WT:Social will let users share articles. But WT:Social will be funded by donations, rather than advertising. "The business model of social media companies, of pure advertising, is problematic," Wales <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/9956ff9c-0622-11ea-a984-fbbacad9e7dd">told <i>Financial Times</i></a>. "It turns out the huge winner is low-quality content."</p>
      <p>Unlike Facebook and Twitter, which use algorithms to bump posts with the most comments or likes to the top, WT:Social will show the newest links first. It may add an "upvote" button in the future.</p>
      <p>WT:Social will also support small, niche communities. Those sound wholesome now (think: beekeeping), but we've seen how <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/04/13/facebook-removes-pages-richard-spencer/">small communities can fester</a> online. WT:Social promises, "We will foster an environment where bad actors are removed because it is right, not because it suddenly affects our bottom-line."</p>
      <p>WT:Social will be free to join, but at the moment, you either have to sign up for a waitlist, donate or invite friends. Just a month old, it already has 50,000 users, Wales told <i>FT</i>, adding "Obviously the ambition is not 50,000 or 500,000 but 50m and 500m."</p>
