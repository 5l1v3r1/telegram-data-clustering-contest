      <p>Should BBC One dance show <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/strictly-come-dancing/">Strictly Come Dancing</a> ever be looking to recruit a member of the royal family to its line-up, we have some good news.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/prince-william/">Prince William</a> has revealed that his wife, the Duchess of Cambridge, is a huge fan of the show and has given it her royal seal of approval.</p>
      <p>So much so that she's made him watch it a couple of times, too!</p>

      </p>
      <p>Kate's mum Carole Middleton is also a fan and, William said, he's joined them to watch it "a couple of times".</p>
      <aside>Catherine is a huge fan and my mother-in-law loves it. I have watched the show a couple of times.</aside>
      <p>"Catherine is a huge fan and my mother-in-law loves it," he said.</p>
      <p>He added: "I have watched the show a couple of times."</p>

      <p>Prince William also had a question for Claudia, who hosts the show alongside Tess Daly.</p>
      <p>"Why does Claudia never dance?!" he wondered.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Laughing, she revealed: "I'm too creaky!"</p>
      <p>As avid fans of both Strictly and Kate, we would love to see her take to the Strictly ballroom.</p>
      <p>After all, we already know from her recent tour of Pakistan that she looks good in sequins!</p>

      <p>We expect the duchess will be tuning into the show this week as the contestants head to Blackpool, the home of ballroom dancing.</p>
      <p>Sadly BBC Breakfast's Mike Bushell won't be travelling with them, <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/strictly-come-dancing/strictly-come-dancing-mike-bushell-voted-out-in-week-8/">having been eliminated last Sunday night</a>.</p>
