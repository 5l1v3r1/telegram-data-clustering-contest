      <h1>Report: Mo’Nique Suing Netflix For Gender, Race Discrimination</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T13:51:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 13:51</time> by <a rel="author">Becca Longmire</a></address>
      <p>Mo’Nique is reportedly suing Netflix for racial and gender discrimination, accusing them of making her an unfair offer for a one-hour comedy special around November 2017.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/actress-mo-nique-suing-netflix-race-gender-discrimination-n1081436?cid=sm_npd_nn_tw_ma">NBC News</a>, the docs, filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court, stated that the streaming giants gave a “biased, discriminatory” offer to the comedian, while others got a much higher pay check.</p>
      <p>Mo’Nique is now seeking unspecified damages, claiming she was offered $500,000 as a “talent fee” while the likes of Jerry Seinfeld, Dave Chappelle and Chris Rock were reportedly offered much more.</p>
      <p>Seinfeld was said to have signed a $100 million deal in 2017, while Amy Schumer is thought to have bagged $13 million for her stand-up special.</p>

      <p>The lawsuit, which was filed on Mo’Nique’s behalf by attorneys at the deRubertis Law Firm, APC and Schimmel &amp; Parks, APLC, claimed: “Despite Mo’Nique’s extensive résumé and documented history of comedic success, when Netflix presented her with an offer of employment for an exclusive stand-up comedy special, Netflix made a lowball offer that was only a fraction of what Netflix paid other (non-black female) comedians.”</p>
      <p>“When the talent was not a black woman, Netflix offered to pay, and did pay, astronomically more than it pays to black women like it offered to Mo’Nique.”</p>
      <p>“Thus, Netflix reportedly offered or paid Rock, Chapelle, Degeneres, and Gervais forty (40) times more per show than it offered Mo’Nique, and it offered Schumer twenty-six (26) times more per show than Mo’Nique.”</p>
      <p>“In short, Netflix’s offer to Mo’Nique perpetuates the drastic wage gap forced upon black women in America’s workforce.”</p>

      <p>The docs also stated the actress accused Netflix’s Chief Communications Officer of using the n-word in a 2018 meeting (Mo’Nique was not present at the time), as well as accusing Kevin Spacey of using the n-word on the set of “House of Cards”.</p>
      <p>ET Canada has contacted Netflix for comment.</p>
