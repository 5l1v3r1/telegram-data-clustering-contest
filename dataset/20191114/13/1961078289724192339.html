      <h1>Smith &amp; Wesson’s Owner to Break Away From Gun Business</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T13:55:28+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 13:55</time> by <a rel="author">David Yaffe-Bellany and Amie Tsang</a></address>
      <p>As gunmakers face growing pressure from the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/05/business/dealbook/investors-gunmakers.html?module=inline">public and investors </a>to curb violence after mass shootings, the owner of Smith &amp; Wesson firearms plans to split the gun business into a separate company.</p>
      <p>American Outdoor Brands said on Wednesday that it would become an outdoor products business that sells everything from Hooyman tree saws to Bubba fishing gear, with Smith &amp; Wesson as a separate publicly traded company.</p>
      <p>American Outdoor Brands’ share price has tumbled as retailers have faced growing public outcry over mass shootings and a decline in gun sales. Sales from the company’s firearms segment have fallen 38 percent over two years through April.</p>
      <p>In October, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/08/business/dicks-sporting-goods-destroying-guns-rifles.html?module=inline">Dick’s Sporting Goods</a> said it destroyed more than $5 million of military-style semiautomatic rifles and was considering whether it would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/25/business/ed-stack-dicks-sporting-goods-corner-office.html?module=inline">continue to sell guns </a>at its stores. In September, Walmart said it would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/03/business/walmart-guns-ammunition-sales.html?module=inline">stop selling ammunition</a> that could be used in military-style assault rifles after a shooting at one of its stores in El Paso.</p>
      <p>The decision to spin off Smith &amp; Wesson was motivated by “significant changes in the political climate as well as the economic, investing and insurance markets,” Barry M. Monheit, chairman of American Outdoor Brands, said in a statement.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, the Supreme Court allowed relatives of shooting victims at the Sandy Hook Elementary School to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/12/us/politics/supreme-court-sandy-hook-remington.html?module=inline">sue the Remington Arms Company</a>, the maker of the rifle used in the massacre.</p>
      <p>American Outdoor Brands is not the first major outdoors company to spin off its firearms business. After the fatal 2018 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., which involved an AR-15 rifle, the outdoor goods retailer REI <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/02/business/anti-gun-movement-is-infecting-an-outdoor-brands-other-products.html?module=inline">suspended orders</a> of bike helmets and water bottles made by Vista Outdoor because of the company’s production of assault-style firearms.</p>
      <p>Two months later, Vista Outdoor <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/01/business/vista-outdoor-firearms.html?module=inline">moved</a> to sell its gun-making business.</p>
      <p>The specific AR-15 involved in the Florida massacre, however, was <a href="https://fortune.com/2018/02/16/smith-wesson-parkland-florida-school-shooting/">manufactured by Smith &amp; Wesson</a>, whose products have been implicated in several other high-profile shootings. A 9-millimeter Smith &amp; Wesson handgun was used in the attack on YouTube’s headquarters in San Bruno, Calif., in 2018. One of the firearms owned by the gunman who attacked a Colorado movie theater in 2012 was manufactured by Smith &amp; Wesson.</p>
      <p>And in February, a disgruntled employee who had been fired from his job returned to a suburban Chicago factory with a .40-caliber <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/03/us/mass-shootings.html?module=inline">Smith &amp; Wesson handgun</a> with a laser sight, which the authorities said <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/16/us/aurora-illinois-shooting.html?module=inline">he used to kill five of his former co-workers</a>.</p>
      <p>After the restructuring, James Debney, the president and chief executive of American Outdoor Brands, will lead the outdoor pursuits business, while Mark Smith, the president of the manufacturing services division, will take up the role of chief executive at Smith &amp; Wesson Brands, the firearms business.</p>
