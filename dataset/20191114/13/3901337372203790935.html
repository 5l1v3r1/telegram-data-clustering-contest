      <p>Should a non-South African player get their permanent residency permit (PRP) while playing in the Premier Soccer League, that would help their club free up a foreign spot – making what can seem a tedious administration process worthwhile.</p>
      <p>The Siya crew has looked at the official squad lists for the 2019-20 season and established that as many as NINE players currently on the books of various clubs can qualify to be registered as locals next year – but the tricky part is the waiting period.</p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>Players in question must also have been in the country for a minimum of five years to be eligible for permanent residency.</p>
      <p>It is understood that it takes between three and eight months for a PRP to be approved by local authorities, and that proof of long-term employment must be provided for the government to approve the process.</p>

      <p>This document is key in clubs planning ahead and knowing exactly how many foreign players they will need to register, as the PSL only allows them to have contracts with only five at any given point. Those who have their PRP will not be affected by that rule.</p>
      <p>Below is a list of the players that – if they decide to apply sometime next year, can qualify for the permit, though they waiting period could have a bearing on whether they can be registered as locals for the 2020-21 season.</p>
