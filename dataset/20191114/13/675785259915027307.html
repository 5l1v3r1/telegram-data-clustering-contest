      <h1>Willian snubs Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo as he names best player of all-time</h1>
      <h2>Chelsea star Willian believes the title belongs to another star: Barcelona's former Brazilian playmaker Ronaldinho</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T13:31:07+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 13:31</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Maltby, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matt-maltby/</a></address>
      <p>Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi have long battled it out for bragging rights as the best player of all-time.</p>
      <p>But <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> star Willian believes the title belongs to another well-known name: Barcelona's former Brazilian playmaker Ronaldinho.</p>
      <p>Between 2003 and 2008, Ronaldinho made more than 200 appearances for Barca, winning La Liga twice and also lifting the Champions League with the club in 2006 after they beat <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> in the final.</p>
      <p>After leaving Spain for a stint in Italy with AC Milan, the World Cup winner wound down his career back in Brazil with a string of clubs including Atletico Mineiro and Fluminese, before hanging up his boots in 2015.</p>
      <p>And Willian has heaped praise on his compatriot.</p>

      <p>"Ronaldinho was the best of all time. Better than Messi and Cristiano," he said.</p>
      <p>"They score goals, but what Ronnie did was incredible. He was amazing on the field and also scored."</p>
      <p>Ronaldinho was rewarded was his stunning form with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fc-barcelona">Barcelona</a> by clinching the coveted Ballon d'Or trophy in 2005.</p>
      <p>But Willian reckons the former Nou Camp hero would have collected more personal accolades had he remained with the Spanish giants.</p>
      <p>"As a fan of his, I have to say that he left too soon," he added.</p>

      <p>"If he had kept up the level a couple of years, he would have won many more Ballon d'Or's"</p>
      <p>Brazil international Willian is currently prepare to face Messi's Argentina in Saudi Arabia.</p>
      <p>The South American giants meet at the King Saud University Stadium in Riyadh on Friday to renew their fierce rivalry following a 2-0 victory for Brazil in the Copa America semi-finals.</p>
      <p>However, since lifting the trophy on home soil, the Selecao have not won a game, with three draws and also a defeat against Peru in Los Angeles.</p>
      <p>Argentina are expected to have captain Messi playing for the first time since his three-month suspension.</p>

      <p>Chelsea midfielder Willian knows the importance of keeping Messi at close quarters.</p>
      <p>"He's a great player, unrivalled, the best in the world. But we've faced Argentina before and this will be no different to those times," said Willian, quoted by Spanish newspaper Sport.</p>
      <p>"We have to give him a lot of attention, we must restrict the space he has.</p>
      <p>"We won't man-mark him, what needs to happen is we need to close down the space around him. Above all we can't allow him time to think."</p>
