      <p>Facebook Pay launched in the U.S. Thursday, <i>Computing</i> reported, following a trial in India. The service supports payments on the Facebook and Messenger platforms.</p>
      <blockquote>“Facebook Pay supports most major credit and debit cards as well as PayPal,” said Deborah Liu, vice president of Facebook’s marketplace and commerce division. She continued: “Payments are processed in partnership with companies like PayPal, Stripe and others around the world. Facebook Pay is built on existing financial infrastructure and partnerships, and is separate from the Calibra wallet which will run on the Libra network.” In addition to enabling users to buy goods on the social network’s various platforms, it will also enable them to send money to friends and donate to fundraisers.</blockquote>
