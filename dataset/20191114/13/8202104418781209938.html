      <h3>The last local vestige of a law that prevented commercial activity from taking place on Sundays appears headed for the dustbin of history.</h3>
      <p>Saskatoon city council voted Tuesday at its governance and priorities committee meeting to remove the Lord’s Day Act bylaw from the books.</p>
      <p>The bylaw was deemed “obsolete” in a City of Saskatoon report because the provincial Lord’s Day Act on which it was based was repealed on May 9, 2018.</p>
      <p>The provincial law provided an exemption from the federal law that prohibited commercial transactions on Sundays to allow spectators to pay to watch sporting events. The provincial law allowed cities to decide if they wanted to permit residents to pay to watch sports.</p>
      <p>The federal law banning commerce on Sundays was enacted in 1906, and struck down by the Supreme Court in 1985 as a violation of the freedom of religion guarantee in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.</p>
      <p>Saskatoon’s Lord’s Day Act bylaw was included among four bylaws that are now deemed outdated. Council approved their removal by unanimous vote at Tuesday’s committee meeting, so it seems likely official removal will happen at Monday’s council meeting.</p>
      <p>Saskatoon’s Lord’s Day bylaw was passed on Nov. 29, 1965 and signed by former mayor Ernie Cole. As outlined in the now-repealed provincial law, Saskatoon’s bylaw allowed people to pay to watch sports on Sundays between 1:30 p.m. and midnight.</p>
      <p>Saskatoon’s bylaw lists 22 sports where a charge for spectators is permitted, including hockey, baseball, fastball, soccer, tennis and swimming. Also included are “soaring,” model aircraft flying, lawn bowling and “pleasure skating” and billiards, snooker and pool.</p>
      <p>Saskatoon voters have previously weighed in on Sunday shopping and other activities in referendums. In a 1969 referendum, voters in the city that was first founded as a temperance colony approved allowing billiards to be played on Sundays.</p>
      <p>Sunday shopping was finally approved in 1991 after the results from a series of referendum questions three years earlier failed to resolve the issue.</p>
