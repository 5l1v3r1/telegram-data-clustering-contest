      <p>A man has been jailed after disturbing CCTV showed him forcing his dog to attack a defenceless cat.</p>
      <p>Amos Price, 30, watched on as his lurcher-type dog brutally mauled the cat to death in Woodlands Crescent, Walsall.</p>
      <p>Cleo the cat sadly died after the attack, with her distraught owner saying his loyal companion will be ‘very much missed’.</p>

      <p>The horrific act was caught on CCTV outside of the house, showing Price approaching the home with his dog on a lead.</p>
      <p>The sickening footage then shows Price using a torch to provoke his dog to attack Cleo, before the animal lurches at the cat.</p>

      <p>Walsall Magistrates Court heard how Price fled the scene after the attack, returning a short while after to find his dog.</p>
      <p>Cleo’s owner Gary Truefitt, who found the footage after Cleo failed to return home, said that he has had ‘many sleepless nights’ since the horrific discovery.</p>

      <p>Price pleaded guilty to causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal under the Animal Welfare Act.</p>
      <p>The court was told that he was ‘ashamed and sorry’ for the attack and was intoxicated at the time.</p>
      <p>The thug has been jailed for 18 weeks and banned from keeping animals for life.</p>
      <p>In addition to his jail sentence, Price must pay a victim surcharge of £122 and compensation of £250.</p>
