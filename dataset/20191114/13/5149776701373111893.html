      <h1>Santa's Grotto axed due to Broadmarsh redevelopment - but Christmas is still coming to Victoria Centre</h1>
      <h2>Don't panic, Christmas has not been cancelled!</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T13:53:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 13:53</time> by <a rel="author">Rachel Gorman</a></address>
      <p>Father Christmas will be taking a break from <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/broadmarsh-centre">intu Broadmarsh</a> this year as the multi-million pound redevelopment of the shopping centre continues.</p>
      <p>Santa's annual family grotto, which last year stood between Wilkos and Greggs on the ground floor, will not return for 2019 due to major construction works currently taking place at the site.</p>
      <p>However, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/christmas">Christmas</a> is far from cancelled with intu Victoria Centre stepping in to provide a free family pop-up.</p>
      <p>Described as a "blizzard of fun" the new Snow Room guarantees everyone a white Christmas.</p>
      <p>Opening from December 9 to January, 5, the magical winter wonderland will be filled to the brim with whimsical white confetti, puzzling pulleys and polar-themed props for families to play.</p>
      <p>Free tickets for the Snow Room can be booked in advance at intu.co.uk/victoriacentre or visitors can walk up on the day.</p>
      <p>Slots take place every 15 minutes.</p>
      <p>There will also be a festive photo booth featuring a snowy ski lift chair and wonderful winter props.</p>
      <p>intu Family Club members can get their ski selfies printed and put into a Christmas bauble while non-members can have their photo emailed to them on the house.</p>
      <p>Nigel Wheatley, centre director at intu Broadmarsh, said: “We’re sorry to say that there will be no Grotto at intu Broadmarsh this year.</p>
      <p>"With the regeneration works now well underway we decided it wouldn’t be fair for Santa to be in the mall as our own merry elves work around him.</p>
      <p>"The centre will remain open though and we’re excited to see the snow room at intu Victoria Centre this year, as well as all the other festive goings on in the city.”</p>
