      <p>Today only, you can save up to 38-percent on DOSS Bluetooth Speakers. This brings them down as low as $19. Now these were already pretty inexpensive, but now they are even cheaper, making it a really great time to pick one (or two) up. This is part of Amazon's Gold Box Deal of the Day, so it's not going to last long.</p>
      <p>It's time to step up your audio game, with a new sound bar. And Amazon has the Sony HT-S350 Soundbar with wireless subwoofer on sale for just $198 right now. This is down from its regular price of $278. It also has some really good audio quality, thanks to that wireless sub that is going to give you some deep bass. And that sound bar that just sounds amazing. We all know that Sony knows audio.</p>
      <p>Amazon has brought back one of its all-time most popular Amazon Music Unlimited promotions. Where you can get four months of the service for just $0.99. That is a pretty crazy deal. And gives you a good few months to check out the service, before you need to pay the full price – which is $8 per month. Amazon Music Unlimited has millions of songs available, as well as curated radio stations. And it of course works on Alexa.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>Disney+ is now available. You can start streaming all sorts of Disney movies and TV shows on this new streaming service, and it'll cost you just $6.99. Or you can bundle Disney+ with Hulu and ESPN+ for just $13. Which is a really great price – considering, these would cost you $18 per month separately.</p>
      <p>These deals are all available until midnight PST on the expiration date specified below. These prices are also as up-to-date as possible, but beware that prices will fluctuate throughout the day.
