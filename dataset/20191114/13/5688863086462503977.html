        <b>South African international David Miller has emphasised the necessity to look after mental health and he personally is moving forward in the same direction. Miller has further stated that it is important to take time off from a demanding sport like cricket as it will help players focus better.</b>

      <p>With multiple cases of cricketers struggling with mental health surfacing, taking care of a cricketer's mental health has become the need of the hour. Miller is the latest in a long line of players who has taken time off to get his focus back after a hectic schedule for him. The South African last featured for his country during their tour of India and had also participated in the 2019 World Cup and the <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/tournament/indian_premier_league">Indian Premier League</a>. </p>
      <p>“I have taken some time off over the last couple of months. I have been in the Kruger (National Park) recently to just get away from the demands of the game,” Miller was quoted as saying in Sport24.co.za.</p>
      <p>“It’s really important to look after your mental state during your career and it is something that moving forward I am going to pay a lot more attention to.</p>
      <p>“Cricket is a sport that so much can go against you that you need to have time to reflect. Hopefully, I still have a lot of years left playing cricket but I want to make sure that I look after myself mentally.”</p>
      <p>Recently, even India skipper <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/virat_kohli">Virat Kohli</a> had come forward and recalled a phase in his career- the year 2014- when he thought that the world was ending for him. Moreover, ever since <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/glenn_maxwell">Glenn Maxwell</a> decided to take an exile from cricket, two other Australian cricketers- Nic Maddinson and Will Pucovski pulled out of Australia’s Test squad for the upcoming Pakistan series at home.</p>
