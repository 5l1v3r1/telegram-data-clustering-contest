      <h3>People move to Saskatchewan for a ton of reasons — we are pretty darn awesome, after all.</h3>
      <p>B.C.-born cidermaker Samantha Chamberlain moved to Saskatoon sight unseen in 2018, for a job at Crossmount Cider Company. She’s now the woman responsible for carrying forward the delicious, handcrafted Flatlander Cider brand.</p>
      <p>When she arrived at Crossmount, the company had established the Flatlander flagship line plus various seasonal releases. Chamberlain got to work, releasing her first cider last fall. To make her zesty ginger apple cider, the team crushes many pounds of ginger to make a tea and then infuses the cider. It’s on shelves again now for the winter season.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, she released her rosé blend. Infused with strawberry and hibiscus, it’s semi-dry, fruity and forward on the nose with a botanical feel from the hibiscus.</p>
      <p>“It’s been one of our best sellers,” she says. “I’m proud of the fact the market has received it so well.”</p>
      <p>An ongoing collaboration with the University of Saskatchewan Fruit Department attracted Chamberlain to Crossmount.</p>
      <p>“The orchard is really unique. There’s trees on this property that aren’t anywhere else in the world,” she says, adding there are also experimental trials, including ice cider, done in collaboration with the U of S. One day, she hopes to make ice cider; Saskatchewan’s climate is ideal for the sweet fermented drink made from apples picked after they’ve frozen on the trees.</p>
      <p>The cidery’s apple orchard was first planted in 2014, amid the rolling hills in the community that also houses The Village at Crossmount (with housing for retirees) and The Glen at Crossmount (an event space). A little more was planted each year, including pears. It’s now bearing fruit — 2019 marked the first small harvest (Crossmount sources apples from B.C. orchards until its orchard is fully mature).</p>
      <p>For Chamberlain, innovation best describes Saskatchewan’s food industry, especially when it comes to cider (thus far, Crossmount is Saskatchewan’s only major player; the majority of Canada’s apple cideries are in B.C. and Ontario). She’s happy to be part of it all.</p>
      <p>“These leaders in Saskatchewan’s food and beverage industry are all innovating in some way — not only because of the geography of where we are, but also the climate.”</p>
      <p>Crossmount’s atmosphere helped her feel quickly at home when she moved to her new prairie city, she says.</p>
      <p>“There was this feel that it wasn’t just a job; I was going to be a part of something that was up and coming. Saskatchewan is a really exciting place right now. It’s a bit slower. The community really cares here.”</p>
