      <p><b>PAWTUCKET, R.I.Â (AP)</b> - The Rhode Island attorney general's office says Pawtucket violated the state's public record slaw by refusing to release police officers' hometowns to a member of a nonpartisan group promoting transparency.</p>
      <p>Special Assistant Attorney General Sean Lyness gave Pawtucket's city attorney Frank Milos ten days to comply with the state's Access to Public Records Act on Oct. 28.</p>
      <p>Milos says the city has been receiving opposition to the directive from members of the police department and asked Attorney General Peter Neronha to reconsider his office's decision.</p>
      <p>Police union lawyer Joseph Penza Jr. argues that divulging the officer's hometowns violates their right to privacy and "would endanger their physical safety."</p>
      <p>The Providence Journal reports that the state attorney general's office is evaluating a request from Milos for an additional 20 days to comply.</p>
