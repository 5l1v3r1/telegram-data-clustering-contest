      <p>A Boeing 737-800 carrying 196 passengers burst into flames shortly after landing at Sharm el-Sheikh Airport in Egypt.</p>
      <p>The aircraft (UR-SQH), operating flight PQ7153 from Zaporizhia on November 9, had turned into its parking bay after landing when, shortly after it stopped, flames erupted on the left-hand main gear.</p>
      <p><i><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/travel/10336539/sharm-el-sheikh-airport-fire-flight/">Sun UK</a></i> revealed that airport CCTV footage captures the moment the plane came to a stop and the wheels on the left side of the aircraft turned into a fireball.</p>
      <p>The fire was “quickly extinguished” by airport staff “without the use of special equipment.</p>
      <p>None of the 189 passengers and seven crew members was injured.</p>
      <p>Reacting to the fire incident, the Egyptian civil aviation ministry said the fire “could have turned into a disaster” but for the staff from EgyptAir Ground Services who dealt “professionally” with the fire, preventing it from spreading to other parts of the aircraft.</p>
      <p>The regulatory body attributed the fire to a leak of hydraulic oil.</p>
