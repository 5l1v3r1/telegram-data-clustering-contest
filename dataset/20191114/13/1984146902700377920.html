      <h1>Louis Saha reveals which club out of Newcastle and Sunderland he feels more allegiance to</h1>
      <h2>Saha represented both Tyne and Wear clubs during his 12 seasons in England as a player</h2>

      <p>Former Premier League winner Louis Saha has revealed he feels more allegiance to Newcastle than he does towards Sunderland - despite featuring for both clubs during his career.</p>
      <p>Saha won two Premier League titles and the Champions League at Manchester United, while he also excelled for Fulham and Everton in English football's top flight.</p>
      <p>The 41-year-old also took a spell in at Tottenham but his career in England started at Newcastle and ended at Sunderland.</p>
      <p>Saha joined Newcastle on a half-season loan deal in 1999 from French side Metz and was part of the side that reached the FA Cup final. He scored one goal in 11 games before he returned to France.</p>
      <p>In the summer of 2012, Saha joined <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/sunderland-afc">Sunderland</a> on a one-year deal but was well past his best as he made just 14 appearances before his contract was mutually terminated in January 2013.</p>
      <p>As a result, Saha looks back with more fondly at his time at <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Newcastle,</a> and revealed as much when he was asked which club he feels more allegiance to.</p>
      <p>“I had a better experience at Newcastle,” said Saha in <a href="https://www.fourfourtwo.com/"> issue 307 of Four Four Two (December 2019, page 11).</a></p>
      <p>“I didn’t play at Sunderland – I didn’t like what happened to me in terms of chances I had there.”</p>
