      <p>It feels like yesterday when we were eagerly waiting for the first pictures from Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh’s wedding. The two tied the knot in Lake Como in two beautiful ceremonies according to rituals followed by both the families. One year later, the couple is happily married and celebrating their landmark anniversary with a holy vacation in Tirupati. Accompanied by family, Deepika and Ranveer visited the famous Venkateshwar temple and shared a beautiful picture from their visit on social media.</p>

      <p>Standing in front of the grand temple, DeepVeer were all smiles in the picture they shared. But that’s not all that’s special about the picture. Deepika was pictured in a beautiful red Banarsi saree by Sabyasachi and if you’re wondering where you’ve seen this saree before, we’re here to tell you. Deepika was gifted this saree during her grand wedding last year. Pictures from her South Indian wedding show her holding a thali with the same saree and other paraphernalia.</p>
