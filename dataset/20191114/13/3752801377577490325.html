      <h1>All police stations now have rape evidence collection kits, Cele assures MPs</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T13:43:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 13:43</time> by <a rel="author">Jan Gerber</a></address>
      <p>All police stations now have sufficient rape evidence collection kits, Police Minister Bheki Cele assured the National Assembly on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>In September, Cele said all police stations would have the kits by October 14. However, he missed the deadline, despite President Cyril Ramaphosa having said he would monitor this himself.</p>
      <p>When Ramaphosa answered questions in the National Council of Provinces on October 10, DA MP Cathy Labuschagne asked him to undertake that this would indeed be the case.</p>
      <p>"We are now on a drive to ensure all police stations will have their own rape kits," Ramaphosa said.</p>
      <p>"I will monitor this myself," he said without committing to a date. Two weeks later, when Ramaphosa answered questions in the National Assembly, DA MP Siviwe Gwarube said the money allocated to fight gender-based violence meant nothing if the police couldn't gather evidence.</p>
      <p>She said Cele hadn't met the deadline he set for when each police station was supposed to have had the rape evidence collection kits for adults and children. 76% of police stations didn't have adult kits, and 69% didn't have kits for children.</p>

      <p>Ramaphosa said he was "really, really disturbed" to hear this and promised to speak to the minister.</p>
      <p>"I want to put the minister on the spot," he said.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, Cele was answering questions in the National Assembly, when DA MP Andrew Whitfield asked him whether all the stations now had the kits.</p>
      <p>"All provinces have no single police station that is minus the kits at the moment," Cele said.</p>
      <p>"All police stations have enough kits."</p>
      <p>Whitfield then asked why he had not met the initial deadline.</p>
      <p>Cele said some of the kits had to be taken away from stations to family violence, child protection and sexual offences units.</p>
      <p>He said there now was a contract in place for the provision of the kits for the next three years.</p>
