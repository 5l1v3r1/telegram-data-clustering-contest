      <h1>Way of Monitoring Stem Cells Maturing in Nerve and Other Cells May Aid Parkinson’s Understanding, Treatment</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T13:00:54+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author">Marisa Wexler</a></address>
      <p>A new biosensor system may make it easier to monitor stem cells changing into mature cells like neurons, which could allow for a better understanding of diseases like <a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/what-is-parkinsons-disease/">Parkinson’s</a> and support the development of new treatments.</p>
      <p>The system was described in the paper, “<a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.nanolett.9b03402"><u>Dual-Enhanced Raman Scattering-Based Characterization of Stem Cell Differentiation Using Graphene-Plasmonic Hybrid Nanoarray</u></a>,” published in <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/journal/nalefd"><i>Nano Letters</i></a>.</p>
      <p>Stem cells are able to continuously divide and to differentiate into other types of cells. Because of these properties, stem cells have gained interest in a number of fields, including regenerative medicine for neurological conditions like Parkinson’s and <a href="https://alzheimersnewstoday.com/">Alzheimer’s</a>. The basic idea is that they could be used to ‘replace’ brain cells (neurons, a type of nerve cell essential for cell-to-cell communication) that become damaged in the course of the disease.</p>
      <p>However, applications like this would require exquisitely precise monitoring of these cells.</p>
      <p>“A critical challenge is ensuring high sensitivity and accuracy in detecting biomarkers — indicators such as modified genes or proteins — within the complex stem cell microenvironment,” KiBum Lee, MS, PhD, a study co-author and professor at Rutgers University, said in a <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/11/191111084925.htm">press release</a>. “Our technology, which took four years to develop, has demonstrated great potential for analyzing a variety of interactions in stem cells.”</p>
      <p>The new technology relies on a technique called <a href="https://www.horiba.com/en_en/raman-imaging-and-spectroscopy/">Raman spectroscopy</a>. In simple terms, this technique involves analyzing the way light scatters off of molecules, which — with the help of computational analyses — allows scientists to figure out details about the molecules being studied.</p>
      <p>The signals generated by Raman spectroscopy are, by their very nature, tiny. In essence, the new system uses a combination of gold nanostructures and very thin layers of graphene to amplify these signals, a technique called surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS).</p>
      <p>By analyzing what molecules a cell is making, particularly in terms of <a href="https://www.yourgenome.org/facts/what-is-the-central-dogma">RNA</a>, researchers can gain insight into what genes in a cell are ‘on’ or ‘off’ (gene expression), which is critical for understanding the development of stem cells.</p>
      <p>Of note, gene expression is the process by which information in a gene is synthesized to create a working product, like a protein.</p>
      <p>As a proof-of-concept, the researchers analyzed neural stem cells, a specific subset of stem cells that, as their name suggests, can differentiate into neurons. They confirmed that their system showed that the pre-differentiation stem cells had high expression of the stem cell marker <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/nestin-protein">Nestin</a>, whereas cells that differentiated into neurons had high expression of a neuron marker called <a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/content/14/9/5399">TuJ1</a> (class III β-tubulin).</p>
      <p>“Utilizing our developed system we can confirm approximately 2 orders of magnitude increase in Tuj1 RNA level [in differentiated cells],” the researchers wrote. Importantly, this finding was consistent with the results of analysis with <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/biotech-dna-technology/dna-sequencing-pcr-electrophoresis/a/polymerase-chain-reaction-pcr">polymerase chain reaction (PCR)</a>, which is a well-established technique for measuring RNA levels and, by extension, gene expression.</p>
      <p>“Collectively,” the researchers concluded, “we believe that our graphene−Au [gold] hybrid SERS nanoarray system will not only be used for high-quality and high throughput bio/chemical molecule screening assays but will also help us to understand cellular phenomena such as disease progression and stem cell differentiation, thus leading to more effective therapies.”</p>
