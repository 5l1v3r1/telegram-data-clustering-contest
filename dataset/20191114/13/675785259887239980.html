      <h1>Thierry Henry named as new Montreal Impact boss as Arsenal icon returns to management</h1>
      <h2>Arsenal legend Thierry Henry was sacked after a brief spell with Monaco but is now back in management in the MLS</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T13:11:02+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 13:11</time> by <a rel="author">Liam Prenderville, http://www.facebook.com/mirrorfootball</a></address>
      <p>Thierry Henry has been appointed as head coach of Major League Soccer club Montreal Impact.</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> striker has signed a two-year contract with the option of a further season, following an unsuccessful stint in charge of Monaco, which ended in January.</p>
      <p>Henry finished his playing career in MLS, scoring 51 goals in 122 appearances for the New York Red Bulls.</p>
      <p>He is widely regarded as one of the finest strikers of his generation and scored a whopping 228 goals for Arsenal to become their all-time record goalscorer.</p>
      <p>“It’s an honour to coach the Montreal Impact and return to MLS,” said Henry.</p>

      <p>“It’s a league I know well, in which I had some very nice moments. To be in Quebec, in Montreal, which has an enormous multicultural heritage, it’s extraordinary. I’ve always kept an eye on the club and now I’m here.”</p>
      <p>The legendary Frenchman will be formally presented at a press conference on Monday and will begin his new management stint in January.</p>
      <p>“We are extremely happy to announce the nomination of this legend of the game,” added Montreal Impact president and CEO Kevin Gilmore.</p>
      <p>“Henry will bring a new energy to our club. He shares our vision to elevate this club and will help us achieve our goals on and off the field. He is a competitor and a leader who has proven himself at the highest level throughout his career.</p>

      <p>"He now brings these qualities with him to Montreal, a place he wants to be.”</p>
      <p>His imminent stint in the MLS will be his first managerial role since his miserable spell with Monaco.</p>
      <p>Henry replaced Leonardo Jardim at the French side last November but it turned out to be a disastrous spell for the Frenchman.</p>
      <p>The former Gunners striker managed just five wins in 20 games before he was sacked and, bizarrely, replaced by Jardim who returned to the helm at Monaco.</p>
