      <h1>Bajaj Chetak e-scooter bookings to open in January 2020</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T13:52:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 13:52</time> by <a rel="author">Firoze Irani</a></address>
      <p>The Bajaj Chetak is expected to have a price tag upwards of Rs 1 lakh but under 1.4 lakh.</p>
      <p>Bajaj has revealed that it will begin accepting bookings for the recently unveiled Chetak e-scooter in January 2020, the price of which will also be announced then. This was revealed at the conclusion of the 'Chetak Electric Yatra' that came to an end in Pune, earlier today. Initially, <a href="https://www.autocarindia.com/bike-news/bajaj-chetak-to-be-sold-initially-through-ktm-showrooms-in-india-414663"><b>the Bajaj Chetak will be sold through KTM showrooms in India</b>.</a></p>
      <p>The Chetak will be Bajaj’s first electric two-wheeler and is reminiscent of the original iconic scooter to carry the moniker. The new Chetak features retro-styling with large body panels and smooth lines. It features some modern touches as well, like multi-spoke wheels and a contoured seat. We also know that the Chetak is powered by a 4kW motor and has two riding modes – Sport and Eco – which will enable a range of 85km and 95km, respectively.</p>
      <p>We will have to wait until January to know the exact pricing of the Chetak, but we do know that Bajaj will position it as a premium product. Special attention has been paid to smaller details like the ‘feather touch’ switchgear, full-LED lighting, digital console and high quality of materials used in areas like the mirror stalks, side stand and flush-fitting pillion foot pegs. This indicates that we could see a price tag upwards of Rs 1 lakh; and Bajaj, at the reveal, did say that it will be priced within 1.4 lakh. Stay tuned for the latest details!</p>
