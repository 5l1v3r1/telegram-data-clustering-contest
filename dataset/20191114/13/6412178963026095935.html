      <p><b>Arsenal legend Thierry Henry has been appointed as head coach of Major League Soccer club Montreal Impact</b>.</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/arsenal"><b>Arsenal</b></a> striker has signed a two-year contract with the option of a further season, following an unsuccessful stint in charge of Monaco, which ended in January.</p>
      <p>Henry finished his playing career in MLS, scoring 51 goals in 122 appearances for the New York Red Bulls.</p>
      <p>“It’s an honour to become head coach of the Montreal Impact and return to MLS,” Henry told the club’s official website.</p>
      <p>“It’s a league that I know well (and) where I had a great time.</p>
      <p>“Being in Quebec, in Montreal, which has a huge multicultural heritage, is something extraordinary. I have always had an eye on this club and now I am there.”</p>
      <p>Sports director Olivier Renard added: “We are very happy to have Thierry join us.</p>
      <p>“Young and dynamic, he is very familiar with MLS and meets the criteria we set.</p>
      <p>“This appointment, two months before the resumption in January, will allow us to have the time to build the team with the one who will pilot it.”</p>
