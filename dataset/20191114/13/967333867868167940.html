        <b>The release comes just days before another highly-debated book is scheduled to see the light of day - The Warning, penned by the same author of a dubious 2018 op-ed in The New York Times focusing on an alleged plot against POTUS.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Donald Trump has taken to Twitter to sing the praises of his son’s Donald Jr.’s newly released book titled “Triggered”, citing its top rating on The New York Times’ shortlist.</p>
      <p>However, reactions have varied greatly, with many questioning if the author himself or perhaps his family should be credited for the overwhelming success in sales.</p>
      <p>Some assumed - some laughingly  - that all of the copies of the book had perhaps been bought by the Trumps, their inner circle, or affiliated structures…</p>

      <p>While others noted the top spot hardly came as a surprise:</p>

      <p>A different netizen referenced Trump Jr.’s remarks that he is a private citizen entitled to share whatever he prefers to online:</p>

      <p>“Someone has to buy the book. Libs can barely read", another directed a veiled dig at Democrats, who were deemed unlikely to express interest in such a book. However, one person struck back saying it’s the “red hats” that can’t read:</p>

      <p>Trump's book was released on 5 November and outlines his view of the left-wing political camp, their tactics, and what he sees as a series of tricks meant to push conservatives out of politics.</p>
      <p>The book's leap to the top comes just days before the tell-all "A Warning" is set to be released, penned by the anonymous author of a controversial <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201809071067846281-us-trump-nyt-sessions/">op-ed that enraged President Trump</a> in 2018.</p>
      <p>The article, "I Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration", depicted President Donald Trump's decision-making and problem-solving as uninformed and irresponsible, and said that many current members of his White House administration intentionally undermine his proposals and orders for the good of the country.</p>
      <p>The White House referred to the book as a "work of fiction” calling the author a “coward”. The release prompted Mike Pence, who is reportedly mentioned in the book, to <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201911071077248398-mike-pence-denies-claim-he-was-ready-to-kick-trump-from-wh-become-acting-president/">insist he had never floated using the 25th Amendment</a> to oust Trump and replace him, with the latter reportedly assumed in the book.</p>
