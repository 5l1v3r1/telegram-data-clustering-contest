      <p>The voluntary recall has been undertaken to address an issue related to the 'head cover bolt loosening.'</p>
      <p>India Yamaha Motor has issued a recall for a total of 13,348 motorcycles, comprising 12,620 units of the FZ 25 and 728 units of the Fazer 25 manufactured from June 2018. The voluntary recall is being undertaken to address an issue related to the 'head cover bolt loosening'.</p>
      <p>The affected motorcycles will be repaired free of cost at any of the Yamaha-authorised dealers and the owners will be contacted individually. Yamaha is working closely with its dealer partners to ensure the repair experience is as convenient and efficient as possible.</p>
      <p>Back in January 2019, Yamaha had launched the ABS variants of the FZ25 and Fazer 25. Both bikes came equipped with dual-channel ABS. The naked FZ25 comes with a price tag of Rs 1.33 lakh and the Fazer 25 will set you back Rs 1.43 lakh. Thatâ€™s a hike of a little over Rs 13,000 as compared to the non-ABS variants that cost Rs 1.19 and Rs 1.29 lakh, respectively.</p>
