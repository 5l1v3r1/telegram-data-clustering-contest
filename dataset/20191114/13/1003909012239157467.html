      <h3>Going to pot over cannabis</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Re: City report pegs pot-related costs at $10M, Nov. 12</b>
      </p>
      <p>The article describes that both the Calgary and the Alberta governments are spending more money than they are receiving to manage cannabis sales in the province. Furthermore, the recent UCP budget foresaw “no sign of turning a profit in the near future.” Therefore, recreational cannabis use has effectively become a social program.</p>
      <p>We may struggle to find money to build hockey arenas for kids or to fund other social programs, but this endeavour has been federally prioritized for investment. Maybe, one day, encouraging marijuana use will be defined as a charitable purpose, and cannabis stores can seek registration as charitable organizations, for their service.</p>

      <h3>Pension plan one of the best</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Re: Kenny’s ideas neither separatist nor dangerous, Opinion, Nov. 13 and Critics see flaws with Jason Kenney’s proposal for ‘fair deal’ panel, Nov. 13</b>
      </p>
      <p>I am herewith registering my strong opposition to any attempt by Jason Kenney and the Government of Alberta to take Albertans out of the Canada Pension Plan. The CPP is arguably the most successful national pension plan in the world. It has been apolitical and extraordinarily well-managed, yielding consistently high returns year after year. Hundreds of thousands of Alberta seniors depend on a fair and regular monthly income from their CPP contributions. The CPP has proven itself worthy of their trust.</p>

      <h3>Will the real Kenney please stand up</h3>
      <p>Jason Kenney has brought a bad habit with him from Ottawa — talking out of both sides of his mouth. Kenney has said he would not interfere with abortion services but then, lo and behold, he got an underling —Peace River UCP MLA Dan Williams — to introduce a private member’s bill that would sanction a backdoor approach to abortion. Nothing like stirring the embers of a long-dead fire.</p>

      <h3>Future of medicine</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Re: Antibiotic Resistance At ‘Alarming’ Level; Superbugs study Warns Of More Deaths, Fewer Surgeries, Nov. 12</b>
      </p>
      <p>This is a very scary article. But there is hope for those for whom antibiotics no longer work. It is called “Phage Therapy.” Simply put, phages are microscopic bacteria that consume “superbugs.” Phage therapy was discovered in the 1930s but was put aside when penicillin and antibiotics were discovered.</p>
      <p>My granddaughter, a microbiologist, has put aside her research to set up a Phage Directory which curates a database of labs and host strains to advance research and therapy.</p>
      <p>The World Health Organization should be looking into this.</p>

      <h3>Show veterans respect by voting</h3>
      <p>For many years now Don Cherry has attempted to shame Canadians into wearing poppies.</p>
      <p>I choose to honour my family members from earlier generations who fought in war, and in some cases died in war, by doing the following: I vote. Their sacrifices have allowed me to live in one of the best democracies, and therefore I vote, even when it’s inconvenient, or time consuming, or even when I think my vote won’t count. I vote because to not do so would be to disrespect those who have served in the Armed Forces.</p>
