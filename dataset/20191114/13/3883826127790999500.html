        <b>Seventeen people have been arrested in early morning raids across east London in an international human trafficking investigation.</b>
      </p>
      <p>A total of 29 women aged 20 to 40 were rescued in the operation by the Met, supported by officers from Romania.</p>
      <p>The potential victims were taken to a "place of safety", and the suspects, 14 men and three women, remain in custody.</p>
      <p>Sixteen warrants were executed at properties in Redbridge, Havering, Barking and Dagenham and Tower Hamlets.</p>
      <p>The suspects, who were aged between 17 and 50, were held on suspicion of modern slavery, controlling prostitution, Class A drug offences and firearm offences relating to a stun gun.</p>
      <p>They remain in custody in a central London police station.</p>
      <p>Four warrants were carried out in Romania at the same time, leading to the arrest of a man in Constanta.</p>
      <h3>'One fell swoop'</h3>
      <p>Det Ch Insp Richard McDonagh, said: "The Met recognises the seriousness of modern slavery and the devastation it brings to people's lives.</p>
      <p>"Today's synchronised operational activity [had] the aim of, in one fell swoop, dismantling an organised crime network and providing support to the victims."</p>
      <p>A spokesman for Romanian police in the UK said: "Romanian police officers working shoulder to shoulder with our British partners is a great achievement, a proof of our mutual permanent support and a great professional reward."</p>
