      <p>Ten suspects have been identified as part of the investigation into the killing of community worker Ian Ogle, a court heard today.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors revealed the scale of inquiries at a progress report in cases against two men charged with the murder in east Belfast.</p>
      <p>Mr Ogle, 45, was killed close to his home at Cluan Place on January 27 against a background of a long-running feud.</p>
      <p>He was beaten and stabbed 11 times in an attack said to have lasted for around 30 seconds.</p>
      <p>According to the prosecution he was targeted in response to an earlier altercation earlier the same night.</p>
      <p>Five men arrived at the scene, allegedly launched the fatal assault and then escaped.</p>
      <p>A house in east Belfast was then allegedly used as a "clean-up" base following the attack, a previous court was told.</p>
      <p>Murder charges have been brought against three people so far, including Jonathan Brown, 34, and 33-year-old Glenn Rainey.</p>
      <p>They are on bail, but were not present at Belfast Magistrates' Court for today's review of the case against them.</p>
      <p>Neither defendant's address is being disclosed due to death threats issued by loyalist paramilitaries.</p>
      <p>A Crown lawyer said detectives were seeking another eight weeks due to ongoing forensic work on clothing, a car and telephones.</p>
      <p>He also set out details of the investigation into the wider circumstances surrounding the killing.Â </p>
      <p>"It's a large file with ten suspects," the lawyer confirmed.</p>
      <p>District Judge Steven Keown was told inquiries are "progressing well".</p>
      <p>Defence solicitor Mark Austin did not object to the case being being put back.</p>
      <p>Adjourning proceedings to January, Mr Keown again excused the defendants from attending on that occasion.</p>
