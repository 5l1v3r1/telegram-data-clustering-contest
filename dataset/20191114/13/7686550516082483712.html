      <p>Firefighters battled 14% more blazes in the last year, according to figures.</p>
      <p>In the year to June fire and rescue services attended 573,221 incidents, up 2% on the previous period.</p>
      <p>Of these, 182,491 were fires compared to 160,408 the previous year.</p>

      <p>Number of incidents, up 2% on the previous period</p>

      <p>The rise was due to a high number of small outdoor fires which did not involve people or buildings during the hot, dry 2018 summer, according to Home Office figures.</p>
      <p>Fires accounted for 32% of all call-outs attended, 40% were false alarms after reports of a fire and 28% were other incidents like car crashes, floods and medical emergencies.</p>
      <h3>Type of call-outs</h3>

      <p>Last month separate figures showed the number of full-time firefighters had fallen by 23% in a decade.</p>
      <p>There were 32,233 staff employed by fire and rescue services as firefighters in England at the end of March.</p>

      <p>In 2018 there were 32,245 but five years ago, in 2014, there were 37,170 and 41,953 in 2009, figures from the Home Office showed.</p>
      <p>This is around 9,700 fewer firefighters - counting those who were working full-time and on-call up to the end of March this year - compared with 2009.</p>
