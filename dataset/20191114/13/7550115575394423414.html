        <b><a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/jurgen-klopp/">Jurgen Klopp</a> has recalled his switch from striker to right-back as a player in Germany, and explained how versatility is key for Liverpool.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Klopp played for a number of sides throughout his youth career, but can be considered a one-club man at senior level as he broke through at Mainz and stayed there until his switch to management.</p>
      <p>That came in strange circumstances, as he was asked to take duties as manager midway through the 2000/01 season after Eckhard Krautzun’s dismissal, steering them clear of relegation after retiring as a player.</p>
      <p>Prior to that, he made 340 appearances for Mainz, with 95 coming under Wolfgang Frank, who he credits as his biggest influence as a manager.</p>
      <p>It was Frank who made the decision to switch Klopp from the role of first-choice centre-forward to starting right-back, and speaking to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPHXEjiP1wU">Pro:Direct Soccer</a>, the 52-year-old reflected on the change.</p>
      <p>He said he was “always a striker” because he “had a good header and was really quick,” but “technical-wise I was not too good.”</p>

      <p>“From a nowadays point of view, I would say [moving to right-back] makes complete sense: I would have done the same to me,” he continued.</p>
      <p>“I would have made myself, maybe a centre-half, but I would have put me in the back. Because really quick, good attitude…but not brilliant with the ball.”</p>
      <p>Elaborating on the game that changed his career, Klopp explained how it allowed him to go from his own “biggest enemy” to having been “just happy to have a game.”</p>
      <p>“We were a lower-league team, but I scored 10 to 12 goals a year. That was OK,” he said.</p>
      <p>“But then at one point a new manager came in, he was the best manager I ever had: Wolfgang Frank.</p>
      <p>“He changed the system. It was a friendly game in the pre-season, we had a game against a team from one league lower, they were first in that league, we were last in the [one above].</p>
      <p>“That’s a difficult game to play as friendly, and he said ‘OK, we change the system’. He made the lineup and in that lineup I was at right-back.</p>

      <p>“Half-time in that game was 6-0 to us, we played incredibly, we defended like lions, it was really brilliant.</p>
      <p>“Then we changed completely and the second half team played 0-0, so we won 6-0 and from that moment on, the team from the first half played for the next 50 games and I was right-back.</p>
      <p>“That’s how it started, and from that moment on I was the right-back. [I was] 100 percent [fine with changing]. For me there’s was no problem.</p>
      <p>“I was my biggest enemy, because I hated my football, I really didn’t like it. When I tried to stop a ball, it bounced. I had these inner talks.</p>
      <p>“I was really not a supporter of myself, but only wanted to play. If he told me ‘you look like a decent goalkeeper’…give me the gloves, I do it.</p>
      <p>“So I was just happy to have a game, and the pressure went off my shoulders as well. Because in a team [like Mainz] and you don’t score a lot of goals as the main striker, each chance you miss it’s not like there’ll be another one.</p>
      <p>“I was not involved anymore in that, and I still scored two, three, four goals on average, it was OK.”</p>

      <p>Klopp was asked about the number of versatile players throughout the Bundesliga, and he disagreed that it was German-specific, highlighting a host of examples in his Liverpool squad.</p>
      <p>And he stressed that it “helps a lot” to have a variety of options for every role, spread out over a smaller core of multi-talented players.</p>
      <p>“We have them as well, <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/james-milner/">James Milner</a> can play around 13 positions probably, he probably would be the first choice if all the goalies were out,” he said.</p>
      <p>“<a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/fabinho/">Fabinho</a> can play at least two, Trent can play a lot, so we have that. We don’t have that many specialists.</p>
      <p>“People think sometimes it’s a weakness if you’re that versatile, because you think ‘OK, I don’t have a fixed position, he puts me in there, there, there, then I’m out’.</p>
      <p>“It is [a strength]. It helps in building a squad, especially. That helps a lot.</p>
      <p>“Because you don’t have a specialist in these positions, you have three, four, five players that can play really different positions, that helps you a lot.”</p>

      <p>Klopp’s assertion of versatility being seen as a “weakness” by some is an interesting callback to <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/georginio-wijnaldum/">Gini Wijnaldum</a>‘s comments in 2018, when he said: “It is a quality, but also a weakness.”</p>
      <p>“If players can only be in one position, managers do not even think about moving them,” the Dutchman continued.</p>
      <p>Of course, Wijnaldum is one of Liverpool’s most versatile players, but this has also helped him to make the third-most appearances under Klopp since his appointment in 2015, with 157.</p>
      <p>Only Milner (184) and <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/roberto-firmino/">Roberto Firmino</a> (203) have featured more over the past four years.</p>
