      <p>The Juventus superstar was taken off after just 55 minutes in his side's 1-0 win over AC Milan on Sunday, with his replacement Paulo Dybala scoring the only goal of the game.</p>
      <p>While some reports suggested that Ronaldo was substituted because of an injury niggle, one of his Portugal teammate's has since declared <a href="https://www.soccerladuma.co.za/news/articles/international/categories/messi-ronaldo-neymar-watch-1/portugal-star-cristiano-ronaldo-doesn-t-look-injured/667438">he seems fully fit in training</a>.</p>
      <p>It is understood that Ronaldo was once again upset about being substitute, and there are claims that he <a href="https://www.soccerladuma.co.za/news/articles/international/categories/messi-ronaldo-neymar-watch-1/cristiano-ronaldo-s-foul-mouthed-rant-at-juventus-coach-revealed/667320">hurled some foul language</a> in the direction of Juve coach Maurizio Sarri on his way off the pitch and down the tunnel on Sunday.</p>

      <p>Initially, it was thought that Ronaldo might have to apologise to his teammates for his antics, but according <i>Tuttosport</i>, this is not expected and he will not be punished by his club either, with it also being said that his colleagues are not upset about the superstar's reaction as they know it is part of his character as a serial winner.</p>
      <p>The Portugal captain reportedly regrets the incident and may take his teammates out for dinner when he comes back from national team duty.</p>

      <p>A Selecao, meanwhile, will count on the 34-year-old for their games against Lithuania on Thursday and Luxembourg on Sunday – they need two wins to keep their hopes of qualifying directly for the 2020 UEFA European Championship alive.</p>
