        <b>The Hong Kong government is expected to announce a weekend curfew, China's Global Times reported on its Twitter feed on Thursday, citing sources, but the tweet was later deleted.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Hong Kong government did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
      <p>Hong Kong pro-democracy protesters paralysed parts of the Chinese-ruled city for a fourth day on Thursday, forcing schools to close and blocking highways as students built barricades and stockpiled makeshift weapons, setting the stage for campus showdowns.</p>
      <p>The Global Times is a tabloid run by the ruling Communist Party's official People's Daily.</p>
