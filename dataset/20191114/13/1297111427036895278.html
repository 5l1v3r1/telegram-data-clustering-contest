      <p><a href="https://leaderpost.com/entertainment/local-arts/sask-film-industry-survivors-editor-tim-thurmeier-making-ends-meet-through-corporate-work">There aren’t too many Saskatchewan-made feature-length films these days,</a> but Begonia is one of them. “Stuck in a small isolated room, two young women live only with the basic necessities. Tensions begin to rise as the relationship disintegrates, slowly unraveling the true reason of their stay.” Directed by Gavin Baird, the film is up for four Saskatchewan Independent Film Awards this month. Making its Regina premiere, it’s screening at the RPL Film Theatre on Thursday, Nov. 14, 6:30 p.m. Free admission.</p>
