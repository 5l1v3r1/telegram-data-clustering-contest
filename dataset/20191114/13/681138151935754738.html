      <p>The dual carriageway was <a href="https://www.eadt.co.uk/1.6374617"><b>closed from around 3.37am onwards between junction 42 and 43 when a lorry smashed through the central reservation</b></a> in the early hours of the morning.</p>
      <p>Suffolk Constabulary confirmed that the driver had to be taken to hospital for treatment following the incident but that his injuries were not believed to be life-threatening.</p>
      <p>Highways England were also assisting on the scene and a recovery truck was called at 5am but did not manage to clear the site for a long time due to the debris.</p>
      <p>A spokesman from the police warned that the recovery would take hours and said this morning: "There is a lot of damage that's been caused and it's going to take quite some time to clear."</p>
      <p>Highways England were aiming to have one lane in each direction moving by 9am if the recovery had gone smoothly but an hour later than that it was still closed.</p>
      <p>Drivers were advised to exit on the roundabout before they reached the closure and instead use the A134, A1302 and A1101.</p>
      <p>Traffic flow is now back to normal following hours of standstill.</p>
