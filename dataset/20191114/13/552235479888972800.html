      <p>Celtic are interested in Gillingham starlet Joe Walsh, according to a report.</p>
      <p>But they face stiff competition from Manchester City, Everton and Tottenham for the young goalkeeper's signature.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scottish-premiership">Scottish Premiership</a> champions currently have no shortage of senior shot-stoppers, with Fraser Forster currently holding the gloves, while Scott Bain and the experienced Craig Gordon wait in the wings.</p>
      <p>Further down the pecking order is the highly-rated Conor Hazard, on loan at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/dundee-fc">Dundee</a> , while teenager Tobi Oluwayemi was recruited from <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> in the summer.</p>
      <p>The recruitment team at Parkhead never stop in their pursuit of new talent, however, and recent endeavours have led them to Gillingham, according to the <a href="https://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/sport/18036120.celtic-keeping-tabs-young-gillingham-goalkeeper-joe-walsh/">Evening Times</a> .</p>
      <p>According to the the report, they watched towering keeper Walsh, who starred for the senior side at just 17-years-old against Tottenham's under-23 side on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>He has been the League One side's substitute keeper for league and FA Cup duty so far this season, but has been given his chance to shine for the senior side in the EFL trophy, and kept a clean sheet in a 2-0 win over Spurs' reserves.</p>
      <p>Having signed a first senior deal with the club in May, the keeper's star continues to rise, as English champions City -  along with Spurs, Everton and German high-flyers RB Leipzig - are all believed to have kept tabs on his development.</p>
      <p>But <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> , it's thought, are right up there among the frontrunners to lure the prospect away from South-East England, and could make him the latest highly-rated youngster to be brought to the club.</p>
      <p>Jeremie Frimpong was signed from Manchester City in the summer, while Lee O'Connor was recruited from Manchester United as the Parkhead giants continue to build for the future.</p>
