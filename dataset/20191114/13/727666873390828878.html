      <h1>Jennifer Lopez: Super Bowl Halftime Show Will Show Latinos' Have Culture, Worth &amp; Value</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T13:55:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 13:55</time> by <a rel="author">Yohance Kyles (@HUEYmixwitRILEY)</a></address>
      <p>SBLIV is set to take place in Miami.</p>
      <p><b>(AllHipHop News)</b> The last two Super Bowl halftime performances were met with mixed reviews. Justin Timberlake (2018) and Maroon 5 (2019) didn't wow the general public like previous performers Beyoncé, Bruno Mars, and Lady Gaga. Will next year's entertainers return to form? </p>
      <p>Super Bowl LIV in Miami will feature a mid-game concert by Puerto Rican singer Jennifer Lopez and Colombian singer Shakira. Some football fans - such as South Florida rap legend <a href="https://allhiphop.com/news/uncle-luke-suggests-jay-z-is-the-nfl-s-token-black-guy-Iy4UKK3I5UqsGXpguaWgYw/">Luther "Uncle Luke" Campbell</a> - questioned why no African-Americans were named as headliners.</p>
      <p>In a conversation with actor Robert Pattinson for<a href="https://variety.com/2019/music/news/jennifer-lopez-super-bowl-halftime-show-1203402591/"> <i>Variety</i></a>, Lopez spoke about her upcoming gig inside Hard Rock Stadium on February 2, 2020. The <i>Hustlers</i> star expressed her excitement about representing the Latinx community.</p>

      <p>“I’m putting it together now. Me and Shakira together. We’re both excited to have been given the opportunity to do that, to stand there as two Latin women, in Miami and to bring that flavor," said J.Lo.</p>
      <p>She added, "I think it’s important in this day and age for two Latin women to be standing on that stage, when Latinos are being treated a certain way in this country or looked at a certain way, to show that we have a really specific and beautiful culture and worth and value, and we bring something to this country that’s necessary.”</p>
      <p>The native New Yorker went on to say she hopes her SBLIV set will be a unifying moment. Lopez stated, "That night, I want it to be a celebration of who we are. All of us, because we’re in this together. I want to bring everybody together in that moment."</p>
