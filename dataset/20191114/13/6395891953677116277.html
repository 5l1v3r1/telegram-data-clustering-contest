      <p><b>ROMEÂ (AP)</b> - Ferrari has unveiled a new sports coupe aimed at enticing new buyers and competing with the Porsche 911, part of an overhaul of its model lineup by 2022.</p>
      <p>The new Ferrari Roma presented Thursday is the fifth new car launched by the luxury sportscar maker this year, and one of 15 to be rolled out under its five-year business plan.</p>
      <p>The Roma and the SF90 Stradale, the carmaker's first production plug-in hybrid, represent new segments for Ferrari.</p>
      <p>Commercial Director Enrico Galliera said that the Roma is designed "for people who would like to drive a sports car, or a Ferrari, but are afraid of Ferrari and sportscars."</p>
      <p>The Roma will be priced at over 200,000 euros ($220,000), and the first deliveries will be made by summer.</p>
