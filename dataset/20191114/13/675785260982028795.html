      <p>A "brave" teenager was stabbed to death in an alley after standing up to a vengeful knifeman who threatened to stab people in a row over £5, a court heard.</p>
      <p>Connor Brown was out with friends just four days after turning 19 when he and his friend were approached in a busy alley by Leighton Barrass and Ally Gordon - who Connor knew from school.</p>
      <p>Trouble flared between Connor's friend, Stephen Nunn, and Barrass, a jury was told.</p>
      <p>Newcastle Crown Court heard Barrass was said to have short-changed Mr Nunn after asking to swap a £10 note for two £5 notes, after Connor and Mr Nunn had declined Barrass and Gordon's offer to sell them drugs.</p>
      <p>Jurors at Newcastle Crown Court heard Barrass became angry and Mr Nunn ended up punching him on the nose, fearing an attack, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/">Chronicle Live</a> reports.</p>
      <p>After retreating briefly, Barrass, with his "pride dented", together with alleged accomplice Ally Gordon, came back "out for revenge", it is claimed.</p>

      <p>He is claimed to have told one witness "watch what I'm going to do" while allegedly armed with a spring-loaded knife.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors say Barrass threatened to stab "any one" of the people in the alley behind The Borough pub, in Sunderland, although Mr Nunn was no longer present.</p>
      <p>As people backed away, Connor stepped forward to confront Barrass, the court heard.</p>
      <p>Jamie Hill QC, prosecuting, said: "As Barrass was threatening to stab someone, Connor Brown stepped forward and punched him, we say to stop him carrying out his threat.</p>
      <p>”Barrass then proceeded to stab Connor Brown in the chest.</p>
      <p>“Connor tried to fight back but he was bleeding heavily, and the pair ended up crashing into some bins and then falling on the floor with Barrass on top, continuing to wield the knife, delivering blows to the front and back of his body.</p>
      <p>"This part of the incident is clearly visible on the CCTV. As is Gordon’s involvement.</p>
      <p>”Gordon, who had followed close behind Barrass, took the opportunity of Connor Brown being on the floor with Barrass on top to join the attack, kicking and stamping at Connor.</p>
      <p>“Gordon and Barrass then retreated again.</p>

      <p>"Connor Brown was helped to his feet but quickly staggered and collapsed due to loss of blood, he quickly lost consciousness.”</p>
      <p>Connor had been stabbed five times to the chest and back.</p>
      <p>He had been stabbed so hard that three of the motions of the knife had damaged bones.</p>
      <p>Mr Hill said: “One wound had pierced his bowel, part of which was protruding from his body, but even more critically, one stab wound had entered the left ventricle of his heart and it was this which would prove fatal.”</p>
      <p>Despite attempts to save him, including opening his chest in the street and massaging his heart, he died.</p>
      <p>Mr Hill told the court: “It was just four days past Mr Brown’s birthday when he died in the early hours of February 24.</p>
      <p>“The prosecution case is that the first defendant, Leighton Barrass, repeatedly stabbed him with a knife when the second defendant, Ally Gordon, was there deliberately encouraging and assisting Barrass, joining in the attack by kicking and stamping on Mr Brown.</p>
      <p>“The prosecution say each of these defendants intended that Mr Brown should suffer at least really serious harm and because he died as a result of the injuries inflicted, we say they are both guilty of murder.”</p>
      <p>The prosecutor added: “A sad footnote is the fact that one of the young people in the alley phoned Connor’s parents who travelled to the scene and then followed the ambulance to the RVI, and were therefore in the hospital when he died, and able to identify their son to the police and hospital staff.”</p>

      <p>Doormen chased Barrass down and after he tripped and fell, one of them, fearing he was still armed, kicked him in the head and he was restrained until police arrived.</p>
      <p>While in the police station and under observations, Barrass made various comments to officers, including saying that he had not intentionally stabbed Connor, that Connor had come onto the knife giving Barrass a shock, and that he had acted in self-defence.</p>
      <p>The knife Barrass allegedly used was recovered from the alleyway near to where Connor Brown fell.</p>
      <p>It is unclear whether he lost the knife during the attack or whether he discarded it as he tried to leave the scene.</p>
      <p>Gordon travelled to Edinburgh the following evening, where he was arrested.</p>
      <p>Mr Hill said: "It seems he took to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> to defend Barrass’s actions, claiming that Connor Brown and five friends had attacked him and Barrass, and questioning what else Barrass was supposed to do.”</p>
      <p>The prosecutor said it may be that both defendants claim they acted in reasonable self defence.</p>
      <p>But he added: "Although Barrass may have been punched by Stephen Nunn, and then by Connor Brown, the first time he was acting aggressively and stealing money and the second time he was wielding a knife and threatening to stab people.</p>
      <p>”It was in fact Mr Nunn and Mr Brown who were entitled to use self-defence. Particularly so in Connor Brown’s case where it was entirely reasonable to punch a man running around with a knife threatening to stab innocent members of the public.</p>
      <p>”In fact it was a brave thing to do.</p>
      <p>“Having been punched by Stephen Nunn, Barrass had no reason to return, threatening people with a knife. You cannot retreat from a fight and then claim that it is necessary to go back looking for the other party in order to defend yourself.</p>
      <p>“It is never reasonable to threaten people in the street with a knife, and running down an alley at 1.30am saying you are going to stab someone does not allow you to then claim self-defence if someone is brave enough to try and stop you by delivering a punch."</p>
      <p>Barrass, 20, of Hartside Square, Sunderland and Gordon, 20, of Polmuir Road, Plains Farm, Sunderland, who were allegedly acting as a "team", deny murder.</p>
      <p>Barrass has admitted having a knife in the back alley that night while Gordon denies possessing a different knife on his way to Scotland.</p>
      <p>The trial continues.</p>
