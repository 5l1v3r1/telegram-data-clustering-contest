      <p><b>BOSTONÂ (AP)</b> - A man who was considered a suspect in the heist of about $500 million worth of artwork from a Boston museum has been released from prison.</p>
      <p>The Boston Globe reports that David Turner was freed on Wednesday after serving 21 years for his role in the 1999 planned armed robbery of an armored car.</p>
      <p>According to court records, FBI agents told Turner he was a suspect in the 1990 heist at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum and could receive leniency if he returned the stolen masterpieces. Turner said he knew nothing about the theft.</p>
      <p>The art, including works by Rembrandt and Vermeer, has never been recovered.</p>
      <p>The 52-year-old Turner will remain on probation for three more years.</p>
      <p>Neither Turner nor his lawyer answered questions about the missing art outside of court.</p>
