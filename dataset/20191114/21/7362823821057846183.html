      <h1>Groom’s wedding-day speech to stepdaughter leaves everyone in tears</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T21:34:59+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 21:34</time> by <a rel="author">Alexandra Deabler</a></address>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/weddings">groom</a> brought an entire crowd to tears with his vows – though not the ones intended for his <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/weddings">bride.</a></p>
      <p>Jimmy Gisondi prepared his vows to read to his now-wife Kelsea at their Pennsylvania wedding on Nov. 2. However, once he was done, he read vows to his new stepdaughter, Olivia, leaving the 9-year-old – and the rest of the wedding attendees – in tears.</p>

      <p>"Olivia, from this day forward, I promise to remind you every day how truly loved you are. I promise to teach, guide, respect you for the rest of our days. I promise to never treat anything less than my own child. I'm very happy to say that you’re my daughter. From this day forward, you will truly be my daughter and the other love of my life. I love you, Olivia,” Jimmy read.</p>
