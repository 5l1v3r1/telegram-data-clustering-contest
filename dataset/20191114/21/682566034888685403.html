      <p>Sao Paulo - <b>Valtteri Bottas</b> has a set out a secret plan for beating <b>Formula One</b> king <b>Lewis Hamilton</b> next season, the world champion's Mercedes teammate told reporters on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The Finn, already condemned to the runners-up spot behind six-time champion Hamilton this year, said he would follow his instincts and focus on the areas where he believes he can overcome the Briton.</p>
      <p>"I have plans to find the different ways of how I want to achieve my goal, which is ultimately the championship," he explained ahead of this weekend's Brazilian Grand Prix.</p>
      <p>"I always prefer to do the talking on track and if I am able to keep up my performance and put all the energy I have into my performance, then that is best for me.</p>
      <p>"If I can perform at the level I want, that normally upsets the other side of the garage a little bit and I know being on the other side as well it can lead you to mistakes.</p>
      <p>"I have a plan for next year, but I am not willing to share it so we will find out."</p>
      <p>Bottas said he had focused on his work with his race engineers and was satisfied with his progress, but recognised that he still had to eliminate some mistakes.</p>
      <p>"Overall, it's been my best so far in F1, but still not the season I am aiming for," he said.</p>
      <p>"I still need a bit more consistency and fewer mistakes, but the thing that gives me a good feeling, and confidence for the future, is really starting to see the work with the engineers and myself."</p>
      <p>Bottas has been Hamilton's teammate for three years in which the Englishman has lifted the world title each time -- completing this season's triumph in Texas two weekends ago with two races to spare.</p>
