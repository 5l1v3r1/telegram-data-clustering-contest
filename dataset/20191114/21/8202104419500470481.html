      <h3>A Saskatoon man remains in custody, charged with aggravated sexual assault and unlawful confinement against a 19-year-old man who alleges he was held over two days in a Willowgrove neighbourhood home.</h3>
      <p>Kyle Edward Norman, 36, was charged on Oct. 29, but during his first appearance in Saskatoon provincial court, it was unclear if the charges would stick. Norman told the Crown that he had just spent three hours with an investigator who was waiting for more information that could result in his charges being dropped. The case was then adjourned to allow the Crown to speak with police.</p>
      <p>Provincial court staff confirm Norman, who briefly appeared by video on Thursday, was denied bail following a hearing last week. Defence lawyer Logan Marchand requested more time to review disclosure and the case was set over to Nov. 28.</p>
      <p>A police news release stated that on Oct. 5, a 19-year-old man reported being assaulted and confined between Oct. 3 and 5 at a home in the 200 block of Stensrud Road. According to police, the man escaped by crawling through a window.</p>
      <p>Norman and the man met through a social networking app, but police would not specify which one they used.</p>
      <p>Police said it is possible there are more complainants and encourage anyone who may have been victimized to contact them.</p>
