      <p>CORVALLIS, Ore. (AP) — Taylor Jones had 24 points and nine rebounds, and No. 7 Oregon State exploited a significant height advantage to beat No. 18 DePaul 98-77 Thursday night in the semifinals of the Preseason WNIT.</p>
      <p>Jones, a 6-foot-4 freshman, scored the Beavers’ first eight points and added three blocks. She scored 15 first-half points, helping OSU (3-0) take a 46-31 lead at the break.</p>
      <p>Kennedy Brown, a 6-6 freshman, had nine of her 13 points in the first half for the Beavers.</p>
      <p>OSU hosts Missouri State on Sunday in the championship game.</p>
      <p>The Blue Demons (2-1), who do not have a player taller than 6-2, had no answers for OSU’s inside strength.</p>
      <p>The Beavers broke open a close game with a 13-0 second-quarter run, ending with Destiny Slocum’s 3-pointer that extended the lead to 41-27.</p>
      <p>Aleah Goodman connected from half court at the third-quarter buzzer, giving OSU a 73-54 advantage.</p>

      <p>The lead grew to 27 points in the fourth quarter.</p>
      <p>OSU shot 55.7 percent from the field compared to 36.1 percent for DePaul, and the Beavers had a 56-34 advantage on the boards.</p>
      <p>Slocum (17 points, six assists) Goodman (16 points), Jasmine Simmons (10) and Mikayla Pivec (10) also were in double figures for the Beavers.</p>
      <p>Sophomore guard Sonya Morris led DePaul with 29 points. Leading scorer Chante Stonewall added 16 points, but was just 7 of 25 from the field, including 0 for 10 on 3-pointers.</p>
      <p>BIG PICTURE</p>
      <p>DePaul: The Blue Demons took a step up in competition but didn’t shoot well enough to compensate for their lack of height. Playing a Top 10 team on the road figures to help DePaul as they prepare for the Big East season.</p>
      <p>Oregon State: OSU senior guard Kat Tudor made her season debut after missing the last 21 games of last season with a knee injury. With 178 career 3-pointers, Tudor’s long-range shooting could be a major asset for the Beavers as she works her way back into the rotation. She was 0 for 3 from behind the arc Thursday.</p>
