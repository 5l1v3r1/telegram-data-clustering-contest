      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T21:20:18+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 21:20</time> by <a rel="author">The Eagle Online</a></address>
      <p>The Nigerian Stock Exchange on Thursday posted the biggest gain in over six months due to declining yields in fixed income securities.</p>
      <p>Specifically, the market capitalisation inched N245 billion with six hours of trading to cross N13 trillion, closing at N13.067 trillion against N12.822 trillion on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Also, the All-Share Index increased by 504 points or 1.91 per cent to 26,843.11 compared with 26,339.11 achieved on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>This development also saw the major sectors of the market closing positive; with the banking sector seeing the biggest move.</p>
      <p>The upturn was impacted by gains recorded in medium and large capitalised stocks, amongst which are; Guinness Nigeria, Guaranty Trust Bank, Zenith Bank, Dangote Sugar Refinery and Access Bank.</p>
      <p>The News Agency of Nigeria reports that market analysts attributed the emergence of the bulls strong to lower yields offered by fixed income instruments.</p>
      <p>Analysts at Afrinvest Ltd., stated that “Following the marked improvement in sentiment in the equities market, we expect a mixed market performance in the short term as bulls continue to battle bears for dominance”.</p>

      <p>An analysis of the price movement table shows that Ekocorp led the gainers’ table in percentage terms, gaining 9.79 per cent to close at N3.70 per share.</p>
      <p>Caverton Offshore followed with a gain 9.76 per cent to close at N2.70, while Guinness appreciated by 9.70 per cent to close at N26 per share.</p>
      <p>United Capital rose by 9.66 per cent to close at N2.27, while FBN Holdings appreciated by 9.65 per cent to close at N6.25 per share.</p>
      <p>Conversely, Ikeja Hotel led the losers’ chart in percentage terms with a loss of 9.38 per cent to close at 87k per share.</p>
      <p>Champion Breweries followed with a decline of 9.09 per cent to close at 90k, while MTN Nigeria lost 0.12 per cent to close at N121.90 per share.</p>
      <p>Also, the volume of shares traded closed higher as investors bought and sold 624.84 million shares worth N10.02 billion traded in 6,426 deals.</p>
      <p>This was in contrast with a turnover of 610.58 million shares valued at N11.10 billion traded on Wednesday.</p>
