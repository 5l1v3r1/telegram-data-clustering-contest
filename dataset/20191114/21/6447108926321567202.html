      <h1>Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5, 2.5 Remix &amp; 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue coming to Xbox One in 2020</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T21:29:45+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 21:29</time> by <a rel="author">Stefan L</a></address>
      <p>Square Enix’s Japanese RPG arm are embracing the Xbox one in 2020, with the company completing the Kingdom Hearts story on the platform. After Kingdom Hearts III came to Xbox One earlier this year, the company have confirmed that the rest of the series will be joining it in 2020.</p>
      <p>That’s right, Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 Remix, Kingdom Hearts HD 2.5 Remix, and Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue will all be coming to Xbox One in 2020.</p>
      <p>In addition, the company have created a new demo for Kingdom Hearts III which is available today to try out.</p>
      <p>Beyond that, there’s good news for Xbox fans of Final Fantasy. Basically every 3D Final Fantasy game is coming to Xbox Game Pass in 2020. It’s a huge step, running from Final Fantasy VII through to Final Fantasy XV.</p>
      <p>The one omission is Final Fantasy XIV at this time, but it’s something that Phil Spencer said during the press preview to XO19 that it’s something that they’re trying to make happen on Xbox One. When the game fully embraces cross-platform play with PC and PS4, Xbox One would have to join that ecosystem.</p>
