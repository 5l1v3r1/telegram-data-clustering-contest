      <h1>England thrashing of Montenegro a fitting tribute on an historic night for the Three Lions</h1>
      <h2>The Three Lions put Montenegro to the sword on an evening when past and present were celebrated in some style in England's 1,000th game</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T21:52:14+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 21:52</time> by <a rel="author">Andy Dunn, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/andy-dunn/</a></address>
      <p>If this really is the latest golden generation, they did the olden generation mighty proud.</p>
      <p>On a night when every England player from the past 147 years was saluted, this celebration romp was as much as about the future as the long and storied past.</p>
      <p>Sure, this Montenegro team would rank amongst the worst England have faced in a thousand games but the youthful vigour with which they went about their task must have brought a smile to the faces of former luminaries such as Wayne Rooney and Paul Gascoigne.</p>
      <p>Not to mention the precocious talent and, yes, cockiness that ran through this performance.</p>

      <p>Gascoigne would certainly have appreciated the impudence that seems a standard trait amongst the likes of Marcus Rashford, Ben Chilwell, Jadon Sancho and Trent Alexander-Arnold.</p>
      <p>It was good to see Gazza, standing out in a summer suit while everyone else was dressed in the darkness of winter.</p>
      <p>He always was out on his own.</p>
      <p>He joined a knot of England ‘legends’ on the pitch at half-time, some - it has to be said - more legendary than others.</p>
      <p>Rooney, Gareth Barry, Tony Adams, Gerry Francis, Jermain Defoe, Des Walker, Martin Keown, Trevor Francis, David Seaman, Glen Johnson.</p>
      <p>But this was a landmark day that belonged to every footballer who has represented England.</p>

      <p>There are some who reckon nostalgia is not what it used to be, that history is essentially irrelevant.</p>
      <p>Not England and the Football Association. Oh no.</p>
      <p>If there were trophies for ceremony, for tradition, for remembering the past, there would be more than a single World Cup in the vault.</p>
      <p>And while the actual achievements of the national team might not warrant too much fanfare, it was still right and proper that the occasion of the 1,000th game was marked with such dignified commemoration.</p>
      <p>Performances at major tournaments might have been so often disappointing but the England team remains at the heart of the country’s sporting consciousness.</p>

      <p>And those who have played a part in that team down the years deserve the sort of recognition given last night.</p>
      <p>At the very least, they got a legacy number. Which is nice.</p>
      <p>Raheem Sterling’s is #1190, although the legacy he left on this particular match was a curved scar on the face of Joe Gomez.</p>
      <p>All seems sweetness and light now with Sterling dropping by to collect a silver salver given to those players with more than 50 caps to their name.</p>
      <p>Low-fiving a cordon of kids on his way into the stadium, he then posed on the pitch with peacemaker Jordan Henderson - suspended for this mis-match - and FA chairman Greg Clarke.</p>
      <p>Whether or not there is any lasting fallout from canteen-gate remains to be seen.</p>
      <p>There could have been seething discontent among the squad, there could have been as many divisions as you like … and this would still have been one of the most one-sided contests you could imagine.</p>
      <p>For now, the only thing Sterling was probably perturbed about was missing the chance to help himself at this goalscoring buffet.</p>

      <p>It really was help yourself.</p>
      <p>And that is why reading too much into this ceremonial victory is fraught with danger.</p>
      <p>But there WAS significance, aside from Harry Kane’s hat-trick and the goals from Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Rashford and the own goal from Aleksandar Sofranac..</p>
      <p>When James Maddison, who turns 23 in just over a week’s time, replaced Oxlade-Chamberlain, he became the 1245th player to be capped by England.</p>
      <p>The only thing this current wave of talented proud patriots could do was celebrate them ALL in style.</p>
      <p>And that is exactly what they did.</p>
