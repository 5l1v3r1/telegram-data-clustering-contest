      <h3>A Canadian man who lost his bid to appeal his extradition to the U.S. in Saskatchewan courts to face fraud charges has won a challenge in a North Carolina district court to dismiss the indictment against him.</h3>
      <p>The indictment against James Alan Rowan, who was indicted in 2013 on one count of securities fraud and one count of wire fraud in connection to his wind turbine venture that attracted the attention of celebrities, was dismissed on Oct. 23 by Chief United States District Judge Terrence W. Boyle. The StarPhoenix obtained a copy of the written judgment.</p>
      <p>Boyle found that the three-year delay between a North Carolina grand jury electing to indict Rowan and the extradition request, which was received by Canadian authorities in September 2016, was too long.</p>
      <p>“It was entirely within the government’s control and resulted from its own negligence in completing his extradition request. Defendant asserted his right and his ability to defend himself has been impaired. At bottom, the government asks the court to suspend the Speedy Trial Clause because it cannot do its job efficiently,” Boyle wrote.</p>
      <p>“This is untenable.”</p>
      <p>Boyle pointed to the constitutional right under the Sixth Amendment to a trial without unnecessary delay, saying the government failed in this regard.</p>
      <p>After Rowan’s December 2016 arrest by RCMP in Saskatoon, he fought an extradition order brought against him by the Attorney General of Canada’s office for three years, which had been upheld by Saskatchewan courts. He was extradited to the U.S. in June.</p>
      <p>Rowan was accused in connection with the sale of unregistered securities in his company, Enviro-Energies LLC. It was alleged that he misled investors with claims that Enviro-Energies had developed roof-mounted wind turbines that could generate enough energy for a household. RCMP tracked him to Saskatoon, where he had resided at two addresses, one being his parents’ home.</p>
      <p>The U.S. government, Boyle noted in his decision, argued it needed the time to “prepare an extradition packet that would withstand the high degree of scrutiny it would receive by Justice Canada.” Boyle dismissed this argument, writing that the government’s timeline was characterized by periods of “protracted inaction” and “inefficient resolution of questions about the extradition request.”</p>
      <p>Boyle found in favour of Rowan’s argument that he could have recovered pieces of evidence that would have helped his defence if it weren’t for the delay.</p>
      <p>He added that the delay compounded the government’s wait to bring the charges — which neared the five-year statute of limitations for the charges for conduct alleged to have taken place in 2008.</p>
      <p>The U.S. attorney’s office could not comment as to Rowan’s current whereabouts.</p>
