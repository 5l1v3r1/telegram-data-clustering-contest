      <p>Now that Apple's late-2019 16-inch MacBook Pro is available to order, AppleInsider breaks down who should and who shouldn't upgrade to the newest portable powerhouse.</p>

      <p>The new 16-inch <a href="https://appleinsider.com/topic/macbook_pro">MacBook Pro</a> is here and it is making a lot of waves. Creative professionals are already loving the great price, powerful graphics, more reliable keyboard, and even the extra battery life. <br/><br/>It's no surprise that we are already seeing an influx of questions that can be summarized as "should I upgrade?" That's what we are going to try to answer, for at least the majority of users.</p>

      <p>There are two main things that need to be considered when deciding whether or not to upgrade: what machine you have now and what your workload is like.</p>
      <h3>Your current machine</h3>
      <p>If you just upgraded earlier this year to the mid-2019 15-inch, it is very hard to justify upgrading out of the gate. It is a pricey proposition, and probably not worth it for almost any users in that situation.</p>

      <p>Where we would draw a line is if you have a 2016 15-inch MacBook Pro or earlier, as it is going to be worth it to upgrade. There will be a significant performance improvement in that time, and with a more reliable keyboard, you should feel safe investing for the long-term.<br/><br/>If you fall into those middle years in between, it is going to largely depend on your workflow to decide if it is worth it.</p>
      <h3>Your workflow</h3>
      <p>Workflows tend to be categorized into three areas. Consumption, CPU-intensive tasks, and GPU-intensive tasks.<br/><br/>For those who are pure media consumers, there likely isn't anything in the new MacBook Pro that is going to be a must-have upgrade. The slightly larger screen is nice and the speakers are huge upgrades, but that probably isn't worth the cost of upgrading if you bought a MacBook Pro in the last few years.</p>

      <p>Users who have CPU-intensive tasks but already have a Core i9 processor should also hold out. The new MacBook Pro has the same CPU options as the mid-2019 series, and while the cooling system has been improved and boosts performance a bit, it won't make that much of a difference compared to the past i9 machines.<br/><br/>Lastly, if you have a GPU-intensive workflow, the upgraded AMD graphics are likely going to be hugely beneficial, especially if you don't want to use an eGPU or work on the road. There is a significant graphics boost over even the mid-2019 machines, and any machines earlier have a larger performance gap.</p>
      <h3>The decision of a new machine</h3>

      <p>The new late-2019 16-inch MacBook Pro looks amazing. They have a lot of tech packed in there and answer a lot of questions that professionals had.<br/><br/>Some may have been holding out for a new keyboard for taking the plunge and those that were can finally do so. Others may want the impressive-sounding microphones for recording on the go and could use that as a reason to justify the cost.<br/><br/>No matter your camp, it is clear Apple is listening and the future of the Pro line seems strong.</p>
