      <p>Old prescription bottles have a way of accumulating in every drawer and cabinet of a home. During your next cleaning spree, don’t be so quick to toss them in the <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/section/recycling">recycling</a> bin (or the trash can). Those perfectly-good containers have many potential uses beyond their original purpose. From thrifty organizers to gardening projects, here are some clever ways to upcycle empty pill bottles.</p>
      <h3>1. Organize jewelry.</h3>
      <p>Tossing your jewelry loose into a box is a recipe for tangled chains and missing valuables. Keep things neat and organized by repurposing your old prescription bottles. If you have enough of them at home, you can designate separate bottles for each type of jewelry you need to store. Now, instead of spending 10 minutes looking for the mate to your favorite earring, you’ll know exactly where you left it.</p>
      <h3>2. Make travel-size toiletry bottles.</h3>
      <p>Buying travel-size toiletries is a hassle—and throwing away your full-sized bottles at airport security when you inevitably forget to buy the smaller ones is even more frustrating. Reusing <a href="https://www.our-habitat.com/blog/15-clever-packing-hacks-that-will-make-traveling-easier">old pill bottles</a> saves you a trip to the drug store. When packing, just squeeze a dollop of your shampoo, conditioner, sunscreen, and whatever other liquid products you need into separate containers. You can customize the amount you need for the length of your trip, and then wash and save the bottles when you get home. But the best part is that you won’t need to wait until you get off the plane to moisturize.</p>
      <h3>3. Sort coins.</h3>
      <p>You can’t spend coins when they’re loose in your drawers and the pockets of your winter coat. Old prescription bottles are the perfect size for organizing spare change. Keep a few empty bottles out at home so you can empty your purse and pockets after you walk in the door. You can even use different bottles to separate coins by value, which will make your life easier if you ever get around to rolling those coins and taking them to the bank.</p>
      <h3>4. Grow seedlings.</h3>
      <p>An old pill bottle makes a great first home for any plants you’re trying to grow from seeds. Just stuff <a href="https://hellohomestead.com/how-to-reuse-pill-bottles/">damp cotton balls</a> into the bottom of the canister, add the seeds, and cover them with a layer of soil. You can even attach a magnet to the side of the bottle to make a decorative mini-planter for your fridge. Once the seedling is big enough, transfer it to a larger home and find new seeds for your upcycled plant container.</p>
      <h3>5. Store spices.</h3>
      <p>Do you need matching containers for your dried herbs and spices? Before spending extra money, see if you have any prescription bottles in your medicine cabinet at home. The containers fit snugly onto a spice rack and are just wide enough for you to scoop a <a href="https://www.thekitchn.com/hot-or-not-prescription-bottle-80251">tablespoon</a> past the opening. Plus, the same amber plastic designed to protect medications from harsh light is just as effective at protecting spices.</p>
