      <p>Aston Villa are sweating on the fitness of Tom Heaton and Jed Steer ahead of the visit of Newcastle United.</p>
      <p>The Magpies, managed by Steve Bruce, travel to Villa Park a week on Monday after the final international break of the year.</p>
      <p>Heaton and Steer are both nursing injuries during the break from domestic action.</p>
      <p>Heaton was missing for the <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/match-reports/wolves-vs-aston-villa-live-17231152">West Midlands derby defeat to Wolverhampton Wanderers at the weekend</a> with a calf problem that also forced him to withdraw from Gareth Southgate’s England squad.</p>

      <p>Steer was subsequently handed his first Premier League start of the season at Molineux but lasted just eight minutes before limping off.</p>
      <p>It was feared Steer had ruptured his Achilles and although his injury isn’t thought to be as serious as that, <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/aston-villa-injury-news-steer-17236454">the 27-year-old is still facing up to two months on the sidelines.</a></p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/aston-villa-injury-news-heaton-17256399">Orjan Nyland made his first appearance since last December</a> when he was brought on to replace Steer and he went on to concede twice as Wolves secured a deserved victory.</p>
      <p>He said afterwards: “It's about being ready when the opportunity arises. They're betting on me to the extent that they want me to be there.</p>
      <p>"They have clear goals for me, and I think I'm a Premier League 'keeper."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/aston-villa-injury-news-newcastle-17253010">Villa will be hoping to have Heaton available as soon as possible</a> but Newcastle fans are hoping their side can take advantage of the potential double 'keeper lay-off.</p>
      <p>One said: "They had to used their 3rd choice last game."</p>
      <p>"Couldn't happen to a nicer club," said another.</p>
      <p>A third added: "We will beat them with or without a decent 'keeper anyway."</p>
