      <p>Today, Microsoft announced a number of phenomenal additions to <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/xbox-game-pass">Xbox Game Pass</a> at X019. While it's great to see franchises like Final Fantasy and Yakuza hit the service, there was one announcement you may have missed. If you're an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscriber, it doesn't matter if you're a new one or have an existing membership, you can get one month of EA Access, three months of Discord Nitro, and six months of Spotify Premium.</p>
      <p>A press release Windows Central received said the following.</p>
      <blockquote>For a limited time, all eligible Xbox Game Pass Ultimate members get one month of EA Access, three months of Discord Nitro, and six months of Spotify Premium included as part of their member benefits. That's not just to new... members, these perks are for all Xbox Game Pass Ultimate members. Just go to the membership area on your console and grab yours. It's like a gift, but to yourself! And you don't have to wrap it!</blockquote>
      <p>This is an excellent promotion and should entice even more gamers to subscribe to the service. Coupled with the fact that amazing games like <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/review-witcher-3-wild-hunt-xbox-one">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a> are joining the service this holiday season, it's a great time to become a member.</p>
