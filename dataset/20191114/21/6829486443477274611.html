      <h1>Please Enjoy ‘The Not Today Show’, Where Climate Change Is Never On The Agenda</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T21:49:44+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 21:49</time> by <a rel="author">Joseph Earp</a></address>
      <p>Gladys Berejiklian and Scott Morrison are putting a lot of effort into <a href="https://junkee.com/scott-morrison-nsw-fires/229359">pretending that the urgent need to address climate change is a distraction</a> from the real news: the NSW fires.</p>
      <p>Of course, the fires are devastating, and the loss of life and massive environmental damage they have caused deserve to be discussed. But talking about the infernos without talking about the thing that caused them is a little like scolding your throbbing thumb, and not the hammer that you just accidentally whacked it with.</p>

      <p>After all, the writing has been on the wall for a long time: climate change is increasing drought, and drought is increasing the occurrence of massive bushfires. It’s not complicated — <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/13/nsw-public-servants-at-climate-conference-told-not-to-discuss-link-with-bushfires">Australian politicians are just putting a lot of effort into pretending that it is.</a></p>
      <p>That’s where <a href="https://junkee.com/mark-humphries-scott-morrison-tourism/207109">Mark Humphries</a> comes in. Yep, Humphries has come out swinging for those weak-willed politicians, backing them up with <i>The Not Today Show</i>, a morning infotainment program dedicated to all those politicians who aren’t ready to talk about climate change.</p>
      <p>Along with his co-host, Jan Fran, Humphries ignores the elephant in the room with the gusto of a real TV pro.</p>
      <p>“Our top story again today is bushfires,” Humphries says, “and we’re joined now by the government’s non-spokesperson for climate change. Non-spokesperson, what do you have to say about the role climate change may have played in this disaster?”</p>
      <p>“Not today Mark,” the non-spokesperson replies.</p>
      <p>“Well, that’s a shame. We were going to discuss the link between extreme weather events and climate change with our resident scientist on hand Dr. Karl,” Fran says. “But as we’ve heard mate, not today.”</p>
      <p>The whole thing is terrifying, and wonderful, and will make you absolutely weep for the future of this country, which will keep catching on fire with increased frequency from now till the whole planet slides into total chaos.</p>
