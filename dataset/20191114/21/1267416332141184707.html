      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T21:25:26+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 21:25</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mobilesyrup.com/author/brad-bennett" target="_blank">Brad Bennett</a></address>
      <p>Jabra’s high-end wireless earbuds, the Elite 75t, are now available for purchase in Canada at <a href="https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/jabra-elite-75t-in-ear-passive-noise-cancelling-truly-wireless-headphones-black-only-at-best-buy/13899157">Best Buy. </a></p>
      <p>These truly wireless earbuds offer 28 hours of total battery life with the included charging case, which is about 50 percent more than the headphone’s older sibling, the <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2018/07/09/jabra-elite-65t-elite-active-65t-active-review/">65ts</a>. Per charge, users are looking at about seven and a half hours of usage.</p>
      <p>Jabra also says the earbuds are dust and water protected with an IP55 rating. This means that while you can’t submerge the earbuds, you can use them if it’s a bit rainy out.</p>
      <p>Notably, these headphones feature Bluetooth 5.0, four microphones and the ability to connect to your phone’s virtual assistant.</p>
      <p>You can order the Elite 75t earbuds from <a href="https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/jabra-elite-75t-in-ear-passive-noise-cancelling-truly-wireless-headphones-black-only-at-best-buy/13899157">Best Buy for $239 CAD. </a></p>
