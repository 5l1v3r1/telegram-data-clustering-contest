      <p>Park-building sim <b><i>Jurassic World: Evolution</i></b> let you make your own dino theme park, and that was pretty awesome in itself, but with the game’s latest update, you’ll be able to go back to 1993 and run John Hammond’s <b><i>Jurassic Park</i></b>!</p>
      <p>In a forum post on the game’s site, the developer detailed this big new update that arrives in a few weeks on December 10.</p>

        <i>Jurassic World Evolution: Return to Jurassic Park allows you to revisit some of the iconic islands from the film in an all new, captivating storyline delivered by the original cast. Join Dr. Ian Malcolm, Dr. Alan Grant and Dr. Ellie Sattler, as you return, reclaim and rebuild the beloved locations of Isla Nublar and Isla Sorna, and open the gates of Jurassic Park to the public for the first time in history.</i>

        <i>Complete with a whole range of new buildings like the Visitor Centre and Aviary, as well as a plethora of classic dinosaur skins including the 93′ T. rex and Velociraptor, this exciting new expansion is sure to bring back fond memories for any Jurassic Park Fan.</i>
      </p>
      <p>New dinos are being added to, with the Compy and the Pteranodon coming along with the update.</p>
      <p>A free update full of new features is also set to release soon as well. There’s little more in the way of details beyond that right now though.</p>
      <p>It seemed like a matter of time until we saw some retro content for the game, and this is a pretty cool way of doing it.</p>
      <p><i>Jurassic World: Evolution</i> is out now on PS4, Xbox One, and PC.</p>
