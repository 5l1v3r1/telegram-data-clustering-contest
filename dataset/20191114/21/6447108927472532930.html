      <p>Set in an 80s inspired post-apocalyptic world, with a new story set in the frozen wastes of Colorado. You’re still a Ranger trying to bring peace and harmony to the world, trying to get back to the comparatively idyllic 1987, your actions ripple out through the people that you meet as with any good western RPG.</p>
      <p>It’s been a long, long wait for the game, having first been announced and been crowdfunded way back in 2016. It follows in the footsteps of Wasteland 2, which was part of that first wave of crowdfunded games, reviving the classic RPG setting for PC and spreading to consoles in 2015.</p>
      <p>Since the company’s acquisition by Microsoft, Wasteland 3 now has full voice work, there’s been a big visual upgrade, and just a lot more refinement thrown at the game. The game drew plenty of praise and plaudits from critics that saw it back at E3 this year, and is sure to be worth keeping an eye on as it heads toward release next year.</p>
