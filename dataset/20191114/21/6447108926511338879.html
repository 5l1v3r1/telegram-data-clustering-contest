      <p>Announced back at E3, we got a fresh look at Microsoft Flight Simulator at XO19, with a trailer that brings the drama with its soundtrack and majesty with the photogrammetric graphics. It’s coming to Xbox One, PC and Xbox Game Pass in 2020.</p>

      <p>It really is staggeringly pretty. The game is built around detailed satellite imagery that’s been fed it into Azure AI to turn it into realistic looking maps for you to fly around in civilian aircraft. It looks really quite stunning in a lot of cases, with day and night conditions as well as weather to contend with.</p>
      <p>We got to go hands on with the game at XO19, playing with a ridiculous flight controls. Make sure to keep an eye out for that preview, even if you’re just going to end up playing with a gamepad or frantically waving your mouse around.</p>
