      <p>U.S. stocks slipped on Thursday, weighed down by technology shares after Cisco's dour forecast raised worries of a global economic slowdown and overshadowed strong results from big box retailer Walmart.</p>
      <p>REUTERS: Wall Street's main indexes slipped from near record levels on Thursday, as a dour forecast from tech stalwart Cisco Systems raised fresh questions about the global economy's health and overshadowed a strong report from big box retailer Walmart.</p>
      <p>Cisco shares tumbled 7.8per cent after the network gear maker forecast second-quarter revenue and profit below expectations as increasing global economic uncertainties kept clients away from spending more on its routers and switches.</p>

      <p>Cisco's share decline weighed the most on the major indexes and helped drag the technology sector down 0.3per cent.</p>
      <p>In contrast, Walmart raised its annual outlook and the world's largest retailer posted better-than-expected earnings, comparable sales and e-commerce growth in its largest market during the third quarter.</p>
      <p>Walmart shares fell 0.8per cent after hitting a record high earlier in the session, but the S&amp;P 500 retail and consumer discretionary indexes were higher after company's report.</p>
      <p>â€œWe have on display this front-end of the economy, the U.S. consumer, that remains resilient and remains in a healthy place in front of a very key holiday spending timeframe for the economy," said Margaret Reid, senior portfolio manager at The Private Bank at Union Bank in San Francisco.</p>
      <p>That compares, Reid said, to "the back-end of the economy that still seems to be plagued and weighed by U.S.-China trade and global economic and political volatility."</p>
      <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 36.93 points, or 0.13per cent, to 27,746.66, the S&amp;P 500 lost 1.41 points, or 0.05per cent, to 3,092.63 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 12.35 points, or 0.15per cent, to 8,469.76.</p>
      <p>Stocks have recently run to all-time highs, with the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 posting record closing levels on Wednesday, helped by the Federal Reserve's interest rate cuts, third-quarter earnings topping low expectations and signs the economy may be bottoming.</p>
      <p>Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Thursday said the risk of the U.S. economy facing a dramatic bust is remote, and investors will next be looking to U.S. retail sales data on Friday to gauge the health of the economy.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, real estate was the top-performing S&amp;P 500 sector, rising 0.5per cent, while energy and consumer staples lagged along with tech.</p>
      <p>Dillard's Inc shares jumped 14.8per cent after the department store chain's quarterly results.</p>
      <p>Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.20-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.21-to-1 ratio favored decliners.</p>
      <p>The S&amp;P 500 posted 23 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 64 new highs and 105 new lows.</p>
