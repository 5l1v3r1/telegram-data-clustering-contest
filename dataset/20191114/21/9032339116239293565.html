      <p>Thank you, Jimmy Kimmel, for releasing yet another installment of one of his show's best series, <i>Celebrities Read Mean Tweets</i>, last night in honor of the Country Music Association Awards. This time, Kimmel assembled musical talent, from Billie Eilish to Chance the Rapper and Monsta X. But Lizzo and Cardi B were the real stars of this episode because they had truly incredible responses to their mean tweets.</p>
      <p>Lizzo read hers aloud first in the clip: "Lizzo. Bus passes and happy meals. Two things that I imagine #Lizzo has seen a lot of." Then she replied back, with a lot of spirit, "Yeah, I’m a big bitch and I ride a bus. A tour bus, motherf*cker. Where’s yours?"</p>
      <p>Cardi B came last, but she gave the installment a strong close. Her tweet read, "I just watched a muted performance of Cardi B and that bitch just looks loud without any sound on. Like no thank you."</p>
      <p>Cardi was incredulous, responding, "How do I look loud? How do I look loud? I'm loud? I don't even think I'm like loud. Suck my ass."</p>
      <p>Really, come for Cardi and Lizzo, stay for everyone else. Watch the entire thing here:</p>

      <p>Kimmel released his last episode of Mean Tweets at the end of September. The standout stars in that episode where Kim Kardashian and Zendaya. Zendaya had the most dramatic reaction to her tweet. Her user wrote, "I bet Zendaya’s feet smell like Funyuns."</p>
      <p>Zendaya responded, "Let’s check, shall we?" Then the actress literally took her Christian Louboutin shoe off, smelled her foot, and quipped, "No, smells like success to me." Savage and worth the rewatch:</p>
