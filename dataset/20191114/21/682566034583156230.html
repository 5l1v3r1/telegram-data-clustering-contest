      <p>Cape Town - England defence coach<b> John Mitchell</b> has revealed that he turned down a coaching opportunity at Super Rugby outfit the <b>Chiefs</b>.</p>
      <p>In an interview with the <b><a href="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&amp;objectid=12285074">New Zealand Herald</a></b>, Mitchell said he was offered the assistant coach role at the Hamilton-based franchise.</p>
      <p>He would have worked alongside head coach <b>Warren Gatland</b>, who recently returned to his home country after coaching Wales.</p>
      <p>Mitchell said the job had the added incentive of stepping into the head coaching role while Gatland takes a sabbatical in 2021 to coach the British and Irish Lions on their tour to South Africa.</p>
      <p>"Emotionally it felt really good but sitting down with family and looking through it I've made the right decision at this time in my career," Mitchell said.</p>
      <p>Mitchell <a href="https://www.sport24.co.za/Rugby/john-mitchell-appointed-england-defence-guru-20180918">became England defence coach</a> in September last year after ending his tenure at the Bulls, where he was executive of rugby.</p>
      <p>He accepted two-year contract extension prior to the Rugby World Cup to stay on as England defence coach under Eddie Jones.</p>
      <p>Mitchell and Jones recently masterminded a 19-7 demolition of the All Blacks in the Rugby World Cup semi-finals, before their team lost 32-12 in the final to the Springboks.</p>
