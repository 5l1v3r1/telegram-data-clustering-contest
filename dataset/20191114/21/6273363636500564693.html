      <p><a href="https://venturebeat.com/2016/12/01/annapurna-pictures-forms-studio-to-bring-storytelling-of-films-like-her-to-video-games/">Annapurna Interactive</a> revealed Last Stop, a new game from Variable State, the creators of the award-winning Virginia game.</p>
      <p>Annapurna released a trailer during Microsoft’s <a href="https://venturebeat.com/tag/x019/">X019 event in London</a>.</p>
      <p>The game is a single-player third-person adventure set in present-day London, where you play as three separate characters — John, Meena, and Donna — and whose worlds collide in the midst of a supernatural crisis. Last Stop is an anthology connecting three stories in one, centered on secret lives, the ties that bind, and how magic can be found in the mundane.</p>
      <p>Players will have a chance to experience an anthology drama with three stories featuring three unique protagonists. Make choices to shape their conversations.</p>

      <p>The trailer mentions body-swapping and some kind of villain who brings women into his apartment and they never leave. It looks like a thriller, but the trailer closes with some kind of giant supernatural bird.</p>
      <p>The game is fully voice-acted and features multiple-choice dialogue as one of its core mechanics. The game also features an original soundtrack composed by Lyndon Holland, the BAFTA-award-winning composer who scored Virginia, and performed by the City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra.</p>
      <p>And Annapurna also announced that The Artful Escape, a music game, will debut in 2020.</p>
