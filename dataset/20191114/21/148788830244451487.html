      <h1>Watch ‘The Mandalorian’ Q&amp;A Session as the Show Gets Nominated for Best Publicity Campaign</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T21:30:06+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 21:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.slashfilm.com/author/ethan-anderton/" target="_blank">Ethan Anderton</a></address>
      <p><b><i>The Mandalorian</i></b> has been <a href="https://www.slashfilm.com/the-mandalorian-spoiler-discussion-podcast/">buzzed about all week</a> since the debut of the first episode on Disney+. While we have to wait until tomorrow to see how the story continues with the second episode, a crowd in Los Angeles was treated to a screening of the first three episodes of the series on the big screen at Disney’s El Capitan theater right in the heart of Hollywood. Following the screening, there was a live Q&amp;A that was streamed through the <i>Star Wars</i> YouTube channel that you can watch in full now.</p>
      <p>The big push for <i>The Mandalorian</i> being all over the place and dominating social media conversation is largely thanks to the publicity team behind the Disney+ series, and they were just nominated for International Cinematographers Guild Publicists’ Maxwell Weinberg Award for Television Publicity Campaign. Find out more below.</p>

      <p>Unfortunately, since the general public hasn’t seen the second and third episodes of <i>The Mandalorian</i>, this is a spoiler-free Q&amp;A session that can’t really dig into the more intriguing details of the series that have been revealed so far. But even so, there are some fun behind the scenes stories from executive producer <b>Jon Favreau</b>, directors <b>Dave Filoni, Bryce Dallas Howard, Rick Famuyiwa</b> and <b>Deborach Chow</b>, cast members <b>Pedro Pascal, Carl Weathers, Gina Carano</b>, and <b>Werner Herzog</b>, and finally, composer <b>Ludwig Göransson</b>.</p>
      <p>If you’ve been enjoying all of the coverage here and everywhere else on the internet about <i>The Mandalorian</i>, it’s largely thanks to the publicity team putting in so much effort to spreading awareness about the series. Even though it might not be as big of a deal to general audiences as your average <i>Star War</i>s movie, there has been plenty of chatter thanks to the show’s creators and cast making the rounds to promote the show.</p>
      <p>The International Cinematographers Guild took special notice of <i>The Mandalorian</i> team for their annual ICG Publicists Awards, honoring innovative, creative and strategic publicity campaigns for the television with the Maxwell Weinberg Award. Here’s the full list of nominees, which features a handful of other streaming series nominees:</p>
