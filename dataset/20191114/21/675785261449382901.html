      <h1>England 7-0 Montenegro: 6 talking points as Harry Kane nets hat-trick in Three Lions rout</h1>
      <h2>The Three Lions didn't need Raheem Sterling as they destroyed Montenegro at Wembley, booking their place at next summer's European Championship finals</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T21:36:29+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 21:36</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Richards, https://www.facebook.com/AARichards/, Alex Milne</a></address>
      <p>On the night where England celebrated 147 years of history with their 1000th game, the Three Lions enjoyed one of their easiest nights out, destroying Montenegro to book their place at the Euro 2020 finals.</p>
      <p>Gareth Southgate’s men had no need for the axed Raheem Sterling at Wembley, scoring five times in 26 first-half minutes.</p>
      <p>Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, making his first international start since suffering a serious knee injury in the Champions League in April 2018, opened the scoring after 11 minutes, brilliantly firing home after being found by Ben Chilwell.</p>
      <p>Skipper Harry Kane soon got in on the act, scoring twice - both from balls by Leicester left-back Chilwell - before Marcus Rashford coolly made it 4-0 on the half hour mark.</p>

      <p>Kane helped himself to a history-making third after 37 minutes, before a thumping own goal from Aleksandar Sofranac in the 66th minute.</p>
      <p>Tammy Abraham, Chelsea's in-form centre-forward, completed the rout late in the day, turning home Jadon Sancho's cross.</p>
      <p>On a night where England scored seven, here are six talking points from Wembley....</p>
      <h3>1. Oxlade-Chamberlain back with a bang</h3>

      <p>Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain is a man who has had to be patient for his opportunities with England, and tonight was his first start since he suffered that serious knee injury in 2018.</p>
      <p>If manager Southgate had forgotten the impact 'The Ox' can have, however, he was well reminded after just 11 minutes, when the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> man fired home for his first international goal since 2017.</p>
      <p>It was a brilliant moment for the 26-year-old, and set the tone for what was to be a hugely satisfactory night for England.</p>
      <p>Oxlade-Chamberlain gives Southgate yet another welcome selection problem, and the manager now has an embarrassment of riches in midfield.</p>
      <h3>2. Chilwell's assist hat-trick helps him pass left-back audition</h3>

      <p>Ben Chilwell has been a huge part of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> ’s success so far this season, and took his fine form at the Foxes onto the international stage with a scintillating performance at Wembley.</p>
      <p>He completed an assist hat-trick in the first-half, providing three goals in just 24 minutes, and his attacking verve and threat brought back memories of how he helped Leicester tear apart <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/southampton-fc">Southampton</a> in their 9-0 thrashing of the Saints last month.</p>
      <p>With Danny Rose out of form and ageing, Chilwell surely has to continue as Southgate’s number one choice from now on.</p>
      <p>If he can repeat this type of performance on a regular basis for the Three Lions, he and Trent Alexander-Arnold on the opposite flank could cause no end of problems for teams in the future.</p>
      <h3>3. No need for Raheem</h3>

      <p>Ok, it was only Montenegro, who were defensively, frankly, appalling.</p>
      <p>But England still showed they can cope with arguably their most important player, and there was no lack of attacking threat from all over the pitch.</p>
      <p>Remember the days they would scrape through these games one or two nil? Those days are long gone, and with the likes of Kane, Jadon Sancho and Marcus Rashford in their ranks, England should never have to worry about where the goals are coming from.</p>
      <p>It's just a slight shame about the other end of the pitch...</p>
      <h3>4. England's defensive issues remain - even against such limited opposition</h3>

      <p>At half-time, as part of the night’s celebrations, a number of legends were out on the field, including Tony Adams, Martin Keown and Sol Campbell.</p>
      <p>Mirror Sport colleague John Cross <a href="https://twitter.com/johncrossmirror/status/1195079023971512327">remarked on social media</a> “that would be some defence” and even on a night like this, you couldn’t get away from the fact that England’s defence is still a little bit shaky.</p>
      <p>Montenegro, despite being absolutely outmatched, managed two attacks of note in the first period.</p>
      <p>Both times, once from open play, once from a set piece, Jordan Pickford was forced to make a fine save.</p>
      <p>As exhilarating as Southgate’s men are going forwards, they still need to clean up defensively.</p>
      <h3>5. Record-breaking night for Kane</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>England’s skipper didn’t waste his evening.</p>
      <p>The Spurs striker notched a hat-trick for the second successive Three Lions outing at Wembley - becoming the first England player to do so.</p>
      <p>His treble took him past England legends Alan Shearer, Nat Lofthouse and Tom Finney in the scoring charts.</p>
      <p>And it also put him out on his own in terms of goals as England captain, with 24.</p>
      <p>Kane is still only 26.</p>
      <h3>6. No.1245 come on down</h3>

      <p>On a night where the legendary Paul Gascoigne was honoured out on the field, a similarly creative, mercurial midfield playmaker stepped out for his senior England debut.</p>
      <p>James Maddison withdrew from the squad last month due to illness and was then spotted in a casino - something which Gareth Southgate wasn’t exactly best pleased about.</p>
      <p>Since then, Maddison has been in outstanding form for Leicester City, creating chances galore and shining in Brendan Rodgers’ side who currently sit second in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>Maddison bring inventiveness, arrogance and no shortage of quality to central midfield, a position where, all too often, England have been found wanting at the elite level.</p>
      <p>The ex-Norwich and Coventry man has no shortage of confidence and has a different skill-set to the likes of Jordan Henderson, Dele Alli, Oxlade-Chamberlain et al.</p>
      <p>Now he’s finally got his foot through the door, it will be interesting to see whether he can not only keep his place in the squad for next summer, but whether he can force his way into Southgate’s starting XI.</p>
