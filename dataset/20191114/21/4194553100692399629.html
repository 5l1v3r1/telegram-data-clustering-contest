      <h1>(Video) Some England fans boo LFC’s Joe Gomez as he’s subbed on after Sterling bust-up</h1>

      <p>In an absolutely pathetic display, many England fans booed Joe Gomez as he was brought on for the Three Lions in the latter stages of the fixture against Montenegro.</p>
      <p>It’s a disgrace – the 22-year-old Liverpool man has just been hounded by his own “fans” because Raheem Sterling decided to try pick a fight with him.</p>
      <p>The squad will be fuming with the supporters inside the stadium, the delusion is staggering, and so will Gareth Southgate.</p>
      <p>To be fair to Raheem, he did applaud Gomez as he entered the field – he did say that they had patched things up, mind. So why the England fans think this is appropriate is beyond me.</p>
      <p>
