      <p>D’Tigress started their FIBA Africa Pre-Olympics Qualifiers started on a winning note after strolling over DR Congo, 20-0 points.</p>
      <p>The Otis Hughley side performed a walk over ceremony over DR Congo who failed to show up for the competition holding in Maputo,  Mozambique.</p>

      <p>The reigning African Champions will now shift their attention to their last group game against Mozambique on Saturday after booking an automatic semi final ticket.</p>
      <p>Winners of the semi final encounters will qualify for the Olympics Qualifying Tournament to be held next year.</p>
      <p>It would be recalled that Hughley settled for Ezinne Kalu, Promise Amukamara, Elo Edema, Atonye Nyingifa, Sarah Imovbioh and Pallas Kunaiyi-Akpannah.</p>
      <p>Others include Upe Atosu, Aisha Balarabe, Evelyn Akhator, Ifunnanya Ibekwe, Adaora Elonu and Victoria Macaulay.</p>
