      <h1>Xbox Game Pass gets flood of new games, EA Access, and more</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T21:15:44+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 21:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://venturebeat.com/author/jeff-grubb/" target="_blank">Jeff Grubb</a></address>
      <p>If it wasn’t clear already, <a href="https://venturebeat.com/tag/microsoft/">Microsoft</a> really wants you to give <a href="https://venturebeat.com/tag/xbox-game-pass/">Xbox Game Pass</a> a try. To ensure you consider jumping aboard this holiday, the company <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2019/11/12/inside-xbox-x019-tune-in-announce/">overloaded the pot with sweetener</a> at its <a href="https://venturebeat.com/tag/x019/">X019 event in London today</a>. Game Pass is getting over 50 new games. And the $15-per-month Ultimate tier starts at $1 for the first 3 months while also coming with a ton of bonsues.</p>
      <p>Let’s start with those bonuses. Xbox Game Pass Ultimate already includes Xbox Live Gold as well as Game Pass for both PC and console. It’s a great service at $15-per-month, and $1 for 3 months makes it harmless to try. Game Pass also gets you discounts when you go to buy content like expansions or even full games. But Microsoft is adding to the list of goodies through some key partnerships. Ultimate subscribers now get 1 month of EA Access, 3 months of Discord Nitro, and 6 months of Spotify Premium.</p>
      <p>EA Access is the Madden and Battlefield publisher’s subscription service for consoles. It gets you a trial version of all EA games. You also get discounts if you decide to continue your save and purchase the full product. EA Access also includes a library of older games as part of its Vault.</p>
      <p>Discord Nitro is a subscription for the communication app’s premium features. It enables you to boost your favorite server to unlock more capabilities for an entire community, and you can also have an animated avatar, which is why I subscribe.</p>
      <p>And then Spotify Premium is a commercial-free music-streaming service. What’s cool about this is that Xbox One and the Xbox Game Bar app on PC have Spotify integration. This enables you to seamlessly stream music over your gameplay sessions.</p>
      <p>So for $1, you are set for most of your subscriptions through December and beyond.</p>
