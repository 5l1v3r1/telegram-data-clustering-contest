      <h1>Halsey and Lady Antebellum's Stripped-Down CMAs Performance Gets a Standing Ovation</h1>

      <p>Halsey and Lady Antebellum gave us the mashup we never knew we needed at the 2019 CMA Awards on Wednesday night. While you may not usually associate Halsey with the country music genre, she fit right in on stage while performing a mashup of "What If I Never Get Over You" and <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/halsey-graveyard-music-video-featuring-sydney-sweeney-46731645">her own "Graveyard."</a></p>
      <p>Halsey strummed her guitar for <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/halsey-graveyard-acoustic-version-video-46896336">the stripped-down number</a> as she sang along with Hillary Scott and Charles Kelley. Dave Haywood accompanied them on the piano, and the quadruple combination made for some stunning sounds. Did anyone else get goosebumps? The CMAs audience certainly enjoyed the rendition, as shown by a brief clip of their standing ovation at the end. See what everyone's so excited about by watching the full performance above.</p>
