      <h1>Jurassic World Evolution: Return to Jurassic Park DLC out in December</h1>

      <p>Dinosaur fans may be happy to know that Jurassic World Evolution is getting a brand new DLC pack, and it is a nostalgia trip. Return to Jurassic Park takes players all the way back to near the beginning and follows the events of the original Jurassic Park movie. Isla Nubar and Isla Sorna are the islands where players will attempt to rebuild the park over seven new missions with Dr. Alan Grant, Dr. Ellie Sattler, and Dr. Ian Malcolm all on hand to give a hand. Film fans will be particularly happy to know that all of the original actors have lent their voices to the games so be prepared to hear from Sam Neill, Jeff Goldblum, and Laura Dern.</p>

      <p>The pack will contain items from the original movie including the iconic gates and tour, the dinosaurs will get skins from the era including the T-Rex and velociraptors. New dinosaurs including Compsognathus and Pteranodon will also be added. There will be a range of updates too including ranger and dinosaur interactions, as well as visitor toilet needs.</p>
      <p>In the review Dom wrote:</p>
      <blockquote>Business management games don’t come much cooler than Jurassic World Evolution, and as subject matter goes it has done the franchise proud. The dinosaurs look fantastic, the park building is easy and coherent, and the ensuing chaos when it goes a little bit off the rails can be frantic and enthralling. It’s pacing where the game struggles a little, with a few too many sedentary moments stretching your patience, but you’re not likely to get any closer to building your own park packed with once extinct animals than this.</blockquote>
