      <h3>Severe Intel Graphics Driver LPE affects Windows, Linux devices</h3>
      <p>As part of the security updates issued this week, Intel also addressed vulnerabilities in the Intel Graphics Driver for Windows and Linux that may allow for escalation of privilege, denial of service, and information disclosure.</p>
      <p>Out of all the flaws detailed in the <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/security-center/advisory/intel-sa-00242.html">INTEL-SA-00242</a> advisory, only the insufficient access control one tracked as <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-0155">CVE-2019-0155</a>, and allowing authenticated users to potentially enable escalation of privilege via local access, impacts Linux devices.</p>
      <p>The i915 Linux Driver for Intel Processor Graphics before versions 5.4-rc7, 5.3.11, 4.19.84, 4.14.154, 4.9.201, and 4.4.201 is the driver affected on the Linux platform.</p>
      <p>Windows devices with an Intel Graphics Driver before 26.20.100.6813 (DCH) or 26.20.100.6812 and before 21.20.x.5077 (aka15.45.5077) are also vulnerable to attacks attempting to exploit this high severity Intel Graphics Driver bug rated with an 8.8 CVSS Base Score.</p>
      <p>The bug is present in a subsystem for Intel processor graphics in:</p>
      <p>• 6th, 7th, 8th and 9th Generation Intel Core Processor Families; <br/>• Intel Pentium Processor J, N, Silver and Gold Series; <br/>• Intel Celeron Processor J, N, G3900 and G4900 Series; <br/>• Intel Atom Processor A and E3900 Series; <br/>• Intel Xeon Processor E3-1500 v5 and v6, E-2100 and E-2200 Processor Families</p>
      <p>Intel advises users to update the Intel Graphics Driver for Windows and the i915 Linux Driver to their latest versions by downloading it from <a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics-Drivers%20%C2%A0">here</a> and, for Linux users, by contacting their Linux OS vendor.</p>
      <h3>Critical issues in BMC firmware and Intel TXE</h3>
      <p>Intel also fixed a critical heap corruption found in the Intel Baseboard Management Controller firmware, rated with a 9.0 CVSS Base Score, and allowing unauthenticated attackers to remotely enable information disclosure, escalation of privilege and/or denial of service.</p>
      <p>The full list of products affected by the vulnerability tracked as <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-11171">CVE-2019-11171</a> is available in the <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/security-center/advisory/intel-sa-00313.html">security advisory</a>.</p>
      <p>The company recommends that all users of Intel BMC firmware update to version 2.18 or later to patch against attacks trying to abuse it.</p>
      <p><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-0169">CVE-2019-0169</a> is a heap overflow that can lead to escalation of privileges, information disclosure, or denial of service on devices with Intel CSME before versions 11.8.70, 11.11.70, 11.22.70, 12.0.45 or Intel Trusted Execution Engine (TXE) before versions 3.1.70 and 4.0.20.</p>
      <p>This is also the highest-rated critical vulnerability patched during Intel's November 2019 Patch Tuesday and the CPU maker advises Intel CSME and TXE users to update to the latest version provided by the system manufacturer that addresses the issue as soon as possible.</p>
      <h3>Latest Intel CPUs patched against new speculative execution side-channel attacks</h3>
      <p>A new speculative vulnerability called ZombieLoad 2 found in the TSX Asynchronous Abort (TAA) and targeting the Transactional Synchronization Extensions (TSX) feature in Intel processors was also fixed.</p>
      <p>According to Intel, the <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-11135">CVE-2019-11135</a> is caused by a TSX Asynchronous Abort condition on some CPUs that use speculative execution which may allow a locally authenticated attacker to potentially enable information disclosure via a side-channel.</p>
      <p>The list of affected Intel CPUs is quite extensive and it includes their Cascade Lake line of processors(the full list is available in the <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/security-center/advisory/intel-sa-00270.html">advisory</a>), which are not affected by previously disclosed speculative execution attacks like <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-ridl-and-fallout-attacks-impact-all-modern-intel-cpus/">RIDL and Fallout</a>.</p>
      <p>Intel urges users of affected processors to immediately update to the latest firmware versions provided by the system manufacturer known to address this issue. Microsoft <a href="https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2019-11135">released security updates</a> designed to mitigate the ZombieLoad 2 vulnerability in the Windows Server and Windows Client OS editions.</p>
      <p>Redmond also provides advice on how <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4531006/guidance-for-disabling-intel-transactional-synchronization-extensions">to disable the Intel TSX capability</a> on systems with vulnerable Intel processors to block potential Zombieload 2 speculative execution side-channel attacks.</p>
      <p>The following command allows you to set a registry key to disable Intel TSX on your Windows machine via the Command Prompt:</p>
      <pre>reg add "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Kernel" /v DisableTsx /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f</pre>
      <p>If you want to re-enable the Intel TSX capability, you can do it with this command:</p>
      <pre>reg add "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Kernel" /v DisableTsx /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f</pre>
