      <p>The six times world champion, like most of his rivals, is out of contract after next season with a major shakeup of the sport scheduled for 2021.</p>
      <p>He recognized at the Brazilian Grand Prix, however, that he was “kind of joined at the hip” with Mercedes after seven years together.</p>
      <p>There could also be change at the helm of Formula One post-2020 and Austrian Wolff has been talked of as someone who could play such a role.</p>
      <p>“I know that being stuck in any position for too long can also not always be a positive so I always want people to spread their wings and do what’s best for their careers,” said Hamilton.</p>
      <p>“I don’t know what that is for him (Wolff), only he will know,” added the Briton, who said Wolf has been “the perfect match” for him and Mercedes.</p>
      <p>“Naturally I don’t want him to leave, particularly if I’m staying in the sport. It is important to me and I am waiting also to see where his head is at.”</p>
      <h3>SCHUMACHER’S RECORD</h3>
      <p>Wolff is not in Brazil for Sunday’s penultimate race of the season, with Mercedes having already won both titles for an unprecedented sixth year in succession.</p>
      <p>Hamilton clinched his sixth championship in Texas this month and will be aiming to equal Michael Schumacher’s record seven next year, when he will be 35 years old.</p>
      <p>The Briton’s last contract negotiations were protracted and fans still speculate on whether he might end his career at Ferrari.</p>
      <p>“I’ve obviously considered the next couple of years. I know that I want to continue racing, I love what I’m doing. I see no reason for me to stop any time soon,” Hamilton said.</p>
      <p>“It’s almost like I only just did this contract and I’ve already got to start talking about the potential of the next one.</p>
      <p>“It’s another stressful moment where you have to... get into the ring and have a friendly yet intense conversation about terms and all those kind of things. But I’m used to it and like to think I’m a relatively good negotiator.”</p>
      <p>Hamilton also revealed he had received text messages from 2007 McLaren team mate Fernando Alonso and former McLaren boss Ron Dennis after Austin.</p>
      <p>“Seeing Ron’s text, it really touched me inside,” said the champion, who first met Dennis as a 10-year-old go-karter.</p>
      <p>“He saw something in me that no one else did except for my dad. He gave me an opportunity to showcase my abilities and to learn and to grow. Without him, I most likely wouldn’t have made it to F1.”</p>
