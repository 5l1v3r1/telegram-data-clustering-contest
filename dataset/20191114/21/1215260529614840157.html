        <b>In a startling revelation, a self-proclaimed former gang member this afternoon testified that the 2008 murder of then Jamaica Urban Transit Company (JUTC) Chairman Douglas Chamber was a contract killing. </b>
      </p>
      <p>The witness, who has been incarcerated at a maximum-security prison for the last two years on a murder conviction, said this was told to him by accused Tesha Miller. </p>
      <p>The court has ordered that the witness’ name should not be published.</p>
      <p>Miller is being tried for accessory before and after the fact to Chambers' murder in the Home Circuit Court in downtown Kingston.</p>
      <p>The witness, who yesterday testified that he was a member of the Spanish Town-based Clansman Gang, today told the court that on the morning of the incident he was instructed by Miller to hand over two guns to a crony named ‘Blackman’ who has now been identified as Andre Bryan. </p>
      <p>Yesterday, the witness testified that ‘Blackman’ was ordered by Miller to carry out the killing. </p>
      <p>According to the witness, on the day in question, he and other men stood at a stall across from the JUTC depot in Spanish Town, St Catherine. </p>
      <p>He said while there, Bryan and another man only identified as ‘Brucky’ drove up in a motor vehicle and waited for Chambers. </p>
      <p>The JUTC chairman, the witness said, came to the entrance of the depot where he was smoking a cigarette and Bryan and ‘Brucky’ opened fire shooting him. </p>
      <p>The trial will continue tomorrow. </p>
