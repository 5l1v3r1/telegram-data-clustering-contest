      <p>TD Maria Bailey has been taken off the General Election ticket in Dun Laoghaire.</p>
      <p>The decision was taken at a meeting of the Fine Gael Executive Council on Thursday evening following a recommendation from leader Leo Varadkar.</p>
      <p>Ms Bailey said she was disappointed, adding she will now take time to reflect.</p>
      <p>The executive council added Councillor Jennifer Carroll MacNeill to the ticket in Ms Bailey’s place.</p>
      <p>Minister Mary Mitchell O’Connor along with councillors Barry Ward will join her to contest the Dun Laoghaire constituency for Fine Gael at the next General Election.</p>

      <p>In a statement posted on Twitter, Ms Bailey said she feels she has been sanctioned twice, adding: “I had hoped to be able to move on and work hard to rebuild my reputation.”</p>
      <p>Ms Bailey stated that after meeting with Paschal Donohoe and the party's General Secretary Tom Curran , that her "deselection was based on the motion passed the Dun Laoghaire Fine Gael constituency.</p>
      <p>"I raised serious issues regarding the procedures of that meeting."</p>
      <p>Ms Bailey added that she received a "copy of a letter from An Taoiseach that my deselection was now being proposed under rule 44A(v) of the Fine Gael Constitution.</p>
      <p>"An Taoiseach has now decided to sanction me again and I have been deleted as a candidate for the next general election in the Constituency of Dun Laoghaire."</p>
      <p>Ms Bailey concluded by saying: "I am a proud member of Fine Gael and I would also like to thank my fellow Fine Gael members for their support.</p>
      <p>"I will continue in my role as a Public Representative."</p>
      <p>Fine Gael members in Dun Laoghaire carried a motion asking party HQ to urgently review the General Election ticket in Ms Bailey’s constituency two weeks ago.</p>
      <p>That meeting heard that the party had taken a knock in the opinion polls following the controversy regarding Ms Bailey.</p>
      <p>The Dun Laoghaire TD has been under scrutiny since her compensation case for falling off a swing at the Dean Hotel in Dublin in 2015 came to light earlier this year.</p>
      <p>Ms Bailey was demoted following an internal review which found that she “overstated” the extent of her injuries.</p>
      <p>Court documents lodged as part of Ms Bailey’s case stated that she could not run for three months after her fall but she took part in a 10km race three weeks after the incident.</p>
      <p>In an RTÉ radio interview in May, she said the swing had not been properly supervised at the time of her fall.</p>
      <p>Ms Bailey has since withdrawn proceedings she filed against the Dean Hotel and was demoted by being removed as chairwoman of the Oireachtas Housing Committee.</p>
