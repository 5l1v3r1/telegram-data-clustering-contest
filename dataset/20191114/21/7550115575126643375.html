      <p>The biggest talking point of the week has been the bust-up between <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/joe-gomez/">Joe Gomez</a> and Raheem Sterling, both at Anfield and on international duty.</p>
      <p>Sterling’s actions saw him dropped for Thursday’s game – the 1,000th in England’s history.</p>
      <p>Gomez had to make do with a place on the substitutes’ bench at Wembley, but Oxlade-Chamberlain and Alexander-Arnold started.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/jordan-henderson/">Jordan Henderson</a> was suspended, affording him the night off and an opportunity to regain some freshness in his legs.</p>
      <p>It was Oxlade-Chamberlain who got the ball rolling, smashing home to score his first international goal since returning from a serious knee injury.</p>
      <p>Harry Kane registered a first-half hat-trick and Marcus Rashford also found the net, with Alexander-Arnold teeing-up the <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/tottenham">Tottenham</a> striker for his third of the night, making it 5-0 before half-time.</p>

      <p>The Liverpool pair shone alongside rumoured Reds transfer target Jadon Sancho, often linking well down the right-hand side.</p>
      <p>Oxlade-Chamberlain was replaced by Leicester’s James Maddison before the hour mark, earning a warm ovation from the crowd.</p>
      <p>It’s now five goals in his last six appearances for club and country, as the 26-year-old continues to stake a claim for a regular starting berth.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, Alexander-Arnold was pushed into a midfield role late on, with Gomez introduced with 20 minutes remaining.</p>
      <p>Bizarrely, Gomez was actually booed by a section of the England supporters – people wonder why some Liverpool fans can’t get behind the national team!</p>
      <p>An Aleksandar Sofranac own goal and a Tammy Abraham strike finished off the scoring, on a night when Gareth Southgate’s side sealed their place at Euro 2020.</p>
