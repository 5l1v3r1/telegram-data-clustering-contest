      <p>The incredible footage shows one fighter using a metal bar to smash a counter that another scrapper had just jumped over. In another scene, a man hits another man in the head with a metal bar.</p>

      <blockquote>This was an isolated incident which has never happened in any of our 5 establishments in the 10 years we have been open. We do not condone violence in any of our gyms and take this very seriously. The police are aware and appropriate action is being taken. The individuals concerned have been banned from our gyms for life. We do our very best to safeguard all members of the public and our staff across all gyms. We are deeply sorry to anyone who witnessed this incident or has been affected by it. We are aware that videos are going around on social media and would be very thankful if these videos could be removed.</blockquote>
