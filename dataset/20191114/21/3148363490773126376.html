      <p>Blankfein ran Goldman from 2006 until retiring at the end of 2018. He is now senior chairman of the firm.</p>
      <p>Blankfein was one of the billionaires featured in her latest political ad, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/13/elizabeth-warren-blasts-billionaires-in-campaign-ad-calling-for-wealth-tax.html">which aired on CNBC on Thursday</a>. The ad calls for a wealth tax and features clips of billionaires criticizing Warren. It arose after Warren’s dispute with Wall Street billionaire Leon Cooperman.</p>
      <p>Blankfein <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2019/07/12/ex-goldman-chief-lloyd-blankfein-calls-bernie-sanders-a-snob/">traded</a> jabs with Senator Bernie Sanders, a rival of Warren’s for the Democratic presidential nomination, in July.</p>
