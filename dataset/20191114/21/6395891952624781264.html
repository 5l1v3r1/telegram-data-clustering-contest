      <p><b>WORCESTER, Mass.Â (AP)</b> - A Massachusetts fire lieutenant who died looking for a baby possibly trapped inside a burning home will be laid to rest next week.</p>
      <p>The city of Worcester announced Thursday that calling hours for Lt. Jason Menard are scheduled for Sunday at the Mercadante Funeral Home.</p>
      <p>A funeral Mass is scheduled for St. John's Catholic Church in Worcester on Monday morning, followed by private burial.</p>
      <p>The 39-year-old husband and father of three died fighting a fire in the early morning hours Wednesday. He and his crew went into the home to look for a baby reportedly trapped on the third-floor. He helped two of his colleagues escape but was unable to get out himself.</p>
      <p>A fund for Menard's children has been set up at the Worcester Fire Department Credit Union.</p>
