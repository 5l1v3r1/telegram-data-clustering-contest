      <p><b>BANGKOK — </b>A 44-year-old Thai man was arrested Thursday after 158 kilograms of methamphetamine were seized from treadmills bound for Japan, according to Thai authorities.</p>
      <p>Police called it the largest single seizure of methamphetamine or "ice" in the country headed to Japan.</p>
      <p>A tipoff led the Central Narcotics Bureau on Tuesday to a consignment of two treadmills at a shipping company. Sending such heavy and bulky exercise equipment via costly air freight to Japan raised suspicions, and a search of the consignment found packets of methamphetamine concealed within steel tubing.</p>
      <p>The police subsequently found 10 other treadmills similarly stuffed with methamphetamine at a Bangkok warehouse rented by the Thai man. The drugs have an approximate street value of about $89 million.</p>
      <p>The man was arrested on suspicion of attempting to export illicit drugs. He denies the charges.</p>
      <p>Smuggling of stimulant drugs to Japan appears to be on the rise. The Thai police announced Wednesday the seizure of about 8 kg of methamphetamine hidden in two wall clocks that were to be shipped to Osaka.</p>
