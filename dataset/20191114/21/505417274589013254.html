      <h1>Player Ratings As Ireland Record Comfortable Victory Over New Zealand</h1>

      <p>
        <b>Republic of Ireland 3 New Zealand 1.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Mick McCarthy’s much-changed side recorded a comfortable win over modest opposition at a bitterly-cold, and sparsely populated, Aviva Stadium on Thursday night.</p>
      <p>Derrick Williams, Sean Maguire and Callum Robinson got the goals, after Callum McCowatt opened the scoring for New Zealand. And here is how we rated the Ireland players:</p>
      <p>
        <b>Kieran O’Hara – 6</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Manchester United goalkeeper, currently on loan with League One side Burton Albion, got the nod to earn his second cap – with McCarthy keeping Darren Randolph in reserve until Monday’s match against Denmark. O’Hara could do little about New Zealand’s goal, but looked a bit shaky when making a save in the second-half, misjudging the flight of the ball and palming it towards his goal.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Lee O’Connor – 7</b>
      </p>
      <p>Celtic full-back O’Connor was not just making his Ireland debut – he was appearing in his first game at senior level. The 19-year-old Waterford-native has yet to play for the Scottish club, whom he joined from Manchester United, but has excelled for Stephen Kenny’s Ireland Under-21 team. O’Connor looks every inch the modern full-back, comfortable in possession, collecting the ball in tight spaces and making overlapping runs, he started the game brightly. O’Connor linked up well with his teammates and was always available for a pass. The youngster should be happy with his international debut, which was capped off with a wonderful cross for Callum Robinson to score. He will surely feature again for Ireland in the not too distant future.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Kevin Long – 6</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Burnley central defender earned his 13th cap against the All-Whites and was defensively solid, handling the threat of Chris Wood. Long was also comfortable on the ball, only misplacing one of his first-half passes.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Ciaran Clark – 6</b>
      </p>
      <p>Clark has been out of favour at club level for Newcastle United for most of 2019, but returned to the starting line-up in recent weeks and has impressed, scoring two goals in five appearances and helping the Magpies move up the Premier League table. As a result, Clark returned to the Ireland starting lineup for the first time since the 4-1 defeat to Wales in September 2018 and was generally solid at the back.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Derrick Williams – 7</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Blackburn Rovers defender scored Ireland’s equaliser with a powerful, accurate header from Robbie Brady’s corner just before half-time. Williams has played predominately as a centre-half this season but featured at left-back on Thursday night and improved in general play after a slow start to the game.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Josh Cullen – 7</b>
      </p>
      <p>Cullen was named man of the match for his display against Bulgaria in September and carried that form into Thursday’s game. The West Ham United midfielder, on loan at Charlton Athletic, is a tidy midfielder, capable of dictating play and covering a lot of ground. He provided the base to mount attacks and linked up well with Byrne and Browne alongside him in midfield. Cullen is also a brave player, unafraid to get physical with opponents, and reads the game well, winning several headers through smart positioning. There is a strong argument to suggest he should already be in Ireland’s strongest side, but his time will come.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Alan Browne – 7</b>
      </p>
      <p>After a patchy performance last month against Switzerland, Browne appears to have dropped out of McCarthy’s first-choice starting XI given his inclusion from the start against New Zealand. The Preston North End midfielder was impressive in the opening half, making some deft passes and creating space with some nice pieces of individual skill. Browne created a promising chance with a cross to the back post, where Williams shot wide, and linked up well with his teammates in midfield.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Jack Byrne – 8</b>
      </p>
      <p>Byrne has had a fantastic year, the best of his career to date. Capped by Ireland after excelling for Shamrock Rovers in the Premier Division and in the Europa League, the 23-year-old also helped the Hoops end a 32-year wait to win the FAI Cup and was named the PFAI Player of the Year for his displays. On Thursday night against New Zealand, Byrne earned his second cap for Ireland and his first start, after making a successful cameo appearance in a friendly against Bulgaria in September.</p>
      <p>The Dubliner played a key part in two goals that night, and although he didn’t register a similar return against the All Whites, he was just as impressive. Byrne demanded the ball in every phase of play, regardless of how many opponents were nearby. He was creative and constructive in possession, passing through the lines and linking up well with Cullen, Browne and Parrot. He is the most creative midfielder in the Ireland squad, but is, unfortunately, unlikely to feature against Denmark.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Robbie Brady – 6.5</b>
      </p>
      <p>Brady returned to the squad and the starting XI after missing Ireland’s last four games and was named the team’s captain. The Burnley midfielder, who has his playing time limited over the last two seasons, understandably looked rusty at times. But Brady’s excellent delivery set-up Ireland’s equaliser and he improved as the game went on.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Sean Maguire – 8</b>
      </p>
      <p>Earning his seventh cap, Maguire started on the left of a front three and was a threat all night. The Preston North End forward, who has three goals and five assists for the in-form Championship side this season, carried that form into this game – scoring a stunning strike from the edge of the box to put Ireland ahead. Named the man of the match.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Troy Parrott – 7</b>
      </p>
      <p>At 17 and 283 days, the Tottenham Hotspur forward became the third-youngest player represent Ireland and the youngest since Robbie Keane in 1998. Parrott, who had only played one senior game before Thursday night, was lively during his time on the pitch. He was mostly on the edge of the game, but he did draw a save in the second half when through on goal and has a handy knack of drawing fouls and winning free-kicks.</p>
      <p>Parrott set-up Maguire’s stunning goal through by winning the ball back on the edge of New Zealand’s box and laying it off to his teammate in space. A promising first cap of many from a rare talent.</p>
      <p>
        <i>Substitutes</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Callum O’Dowda – 5</b>
      </p>
      <p>The winger was a second-half substitute and played at left-back.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Alan Judge – 5</b>
      </p>
      <p>Rarely involved during his time on the pitch.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Callum Robinson – 7</b>
      </p>
      <p>He wasn’t on the field long, but made his presence felt with several efforts. Robinson found the net with a header and deserved his goal, his first for Ireland.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Mark Travers – 6</b>
      </p>
      <p>He made a decent save late on but was otherwise untested.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Conor Hourihane – 5</b>
      </p>
      <p>The game had already been won by the time he came on, little opportunity to influence it.</p>
      <p>
        <b>James Collins – 5</b>
      </p>
      <p>Missed a chance late in the game.</p>
