      <p>NEW YORK CITY (WABC) -- Late Wednesday, the New York State Department of Health released a list of medical facilities impacted by an emerging and deadly drug-resistant fungus following repeated requests for the information from 7 On Your Side Investigates.</p>
      <p>The list made public in the state's annual "Hospital Acquired Infections Report" identified facilities that have treated patients with confirmed cases of the bug called, Candida auris.</p>
      <p>The fungus results in common symptoms such as fever and fatigue and typically sickens people with weakened immune systems.</p>
      <p>Roughly one out of three patients who catch the bug will die, according to doctors at the Centers for Disease Control.</p>
      <p>Prior to 2013, doctors were not aware of the fungus that appeared suddenly at various locations around the globe and spread quickly, particularly in New York, which has seen more cases than any other state.</p>
      <p>The identified 64 hospitals, 103 long-term care nursing homes, a long-term care hospital, and three hospice units in New York that have cared for patients with the fungus.</p>
      <p>Data from the health department indicates roughly two out of three cases occurred in Brooklyn.</p>
      <p>Back in May, 7 On Your Side Investigates <a href="https://abc7ny.com/health/ny-officials-wont-disclose-facilities-hit-by-deadly-superbug/5287285/">reported on the bug's spread</a>. And in September, 7 On Your Side investigates was among the first to <a href="https://abc7ny.com/health/case-of-deadly-super-bug-confirmed-in-nyc-nursing-home/5536001/">identify a facility in New York</a> encountering patients with the disease even as the state refused to release a list of impacted facilities.</p>
      <p>"It's a very serious health threat," said Dr. Irwin Redlener, Columbia University professor and an expert on public health policy. "It's a superbug, meaning resistant to all-known antibiotics."</p>
      <p>The bug has forced hospitals to implement new sanitation requirements as well as infection prevention and control techniques, including screening for the bug, in some cases when a patient is admitted, according to a health department spokesperson.</p>
      <p>Once patients are confirmed to have the bug, loved ones say they end up in quarantine requiring anyone who has contact to wear gloves and masks.</p>
