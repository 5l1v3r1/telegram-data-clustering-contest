      <p>Port Jervis police say they responded to the scene near the intersection of Orange St. and Hornbeck Ave. shortly before 10:30 p.m. Tuesday, and “located the deceased infant who appeared to have been born recently.”</p>
      <p>Based on circumstances and information encountered at the crime scene, officers say they sealed it off for forensic processing.</p>
      <p>An autopsy has been performed on the baby, but detectives are awaiting toxicology results and further testing.</p>
      <p>Detectives say they've identified and interviewed the mother of the infant, but her name is not being released at this time because the investigation is still ongoing.</p>
      <p>Police added that they’re asking the public to “keep the young infant in their thoughts and prayers.”</p>
      <p>Anyone with information regarding this case is asked to contact the Port Jervis Police Department at 845-856-5101.</p>
      <p>Currently, all 50 states have Safe Haven Laws, which allow mothers to leave their unwanted babies in designated locations such as hospitals or churches without fear of being charged with a crime. <a href="https://www.childwelfare.gov/topics/systemwide/laws-policies/statutes/safehaven/">Learn more here.</a></p>
