      <p>Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has revealed that the iPhone maker is expected to release new iPad Pro models with rear 3D sensing in the first half of 2020.</p>
      <p>Kuo in a research note with TF International Securities said the iPad Pro models will gain 3D sensing through the rear-facing camera system, MacRumors reported on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>As per report, Apple is expected to use a time-of-flight system, which measures the time that it takes for light to bounce off of objects in a room to generate a 3D map.</p>
      <p>Additionally, Kuo also reiterated that Apple plans to release its low-cost iPhone " SE 2" in the first half of 2020 too.</p>
      <p>The iPhone SE 2 will use a 10-layer Substrate-like PCB (SLP) for its motherboard, the same technology used by the iPhone 11's version.</p>
      <p>Kuo expects the device to look similar to the iPhone 8 and believes it will be a popular upgrade option for existing iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S owners.</p>
