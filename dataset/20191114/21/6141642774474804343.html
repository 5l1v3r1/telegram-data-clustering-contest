      <p>Controversial plans to redevelop the former home of Britain’s oldest manufacturing company – a foundry that produced some of the world’s most famous bells – have narrowly been given the green light.</p>
      <p>But campaigners branded the proposals “heritage vandalism”, and said they will consider the decision and then decide whether to launch a judicial review.</p>
      <p>The Whitechapel Bell Foundry was established in east London in 1570 and is famed for making Big Ben and the Liberty Bell, the symbol of American independence.</p>

      <p>A contentious planning application to turn part of the site into a 103-room hotel was approved by Tower Hamlets Council’s development committee on Thursday by the chair’s deciding vote.</p>
      <p>The UK Historic Buildings Preservation Trust (UKHBPT) had proposed an alternative plan for the site, which it does not own, with the aim of restarting foundry manufacturing.</p>
      <p>Chairman Stephen Musgrave said he was “very disappointed” with the committee’s decision.</p>
      <p>Speaking after the meeting, he said: “We have an extremely strong planning case.</p>
      <p>“The people we gave put up tonight were not able to explore the full detail of all that so therefore the case was not properly able to be put.</p>
      <p>“It was all very disappointing, it should have been deferred in order that we could have a proper debate.”</p>
      <p>Mr Musgrave said the UKHBPT would review the meeting and a decision to decide whether a judicial review could be launched.</p>
      <p>The proposals, submitted by Raycliff Whitechapel LLP – an Oldham-based limited liability partnership, proposed refurbishing part of the Grade II* listed foundry to create new workshops and a cafe.</p>
      <p>The redevelopment would see an unlisted 1980s extension to the rear of the site demolished and replaced with a hotel along Plumbers Row and Fieldgate Street.</p>
      <p>Part of the listed foundry building would be refurbished to provide new workshops and a cafe, which will serve as a “living museum” and provide “long-term public access through the site”, a council report on the application said.</p>
      <p>While the plans were recommended for approval, there were around 780 objections and two petitions against the scheme lodged with the council.</p>
      <p>The foundry’s former owners said they both supported the plans, according to the council report.</p>
      <p>Historic England said it believed the proposals would provide a “high degree” of heritage benefits through repair, restoration and public access.</p>
      <p>But Councillor Ehtasham Haque told the committee that approving the plans would amount to “historical vandalism”.</p>
      <p>He added: “There is no justification for this substantial harm because a, the hotel can be built anyway, and b, the foundry can continue as a working foundry.</p>
      <p>“Stop this heritage vandalism and throw out this application.”</p>
      <p>After the first objector had given their presentation, Councillor John Pierce asked the audience not to clap the speakers.</p>
      <p>The foundry is listed in the Guinness World Records as the oldest manufacturing firm in Britain and moved to the Whitechapel Road site in 1738.</p>
      <p>Its most famous creation was Big Ben, the bell in Elizabeth Tower at the Palace of Westminster.</p>
