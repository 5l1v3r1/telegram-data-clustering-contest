      <p>We were finally given a look at Age of Empires 4 today during X019.</p>
      <p><b>Age of Empires 4 </b>is still in development, which means a release date was not provided.</p>
      <p>What we do know, is it’s set during the medieval period and the factions shown in the trailer are the Mongols and English.</p>

      <p>The game is still in its alpha stage, so we will have a bit of a wait.</p>
      <p>Until then, you can always play Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition which arrived today. It’s also available through Xbox Game Pass.</p>
