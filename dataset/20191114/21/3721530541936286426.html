      <p>Microsoft showed an <i>Age of Empires</i><i> 4 </i>trailer at X019, but has still not announced a release date. <i>Age of Empires 4</i> was <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/8/21/16180714/age-of-empires-4-pc-relic-entertainment-definitive-edition">first announced at Gamescom in 2017</a>, but Microsoft has been quiet about the game since then. It’s being developed by Relic Entertainment, a Sega-owned company best known for the well-respected Company of Heroes games.</p>
      <p>Microsoft also released its <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/6/9/18658913/microsoft-xbox-e3-2019-age-of-empires-definitive-edition-new-campaign-console"><i>Age of Empires 2 Definitive Edition</i></a> today, an updated version of the game that was first released in 1999. This follows the release of the original <i>Age of Empires’ Definitive Edition</i> last year.</p>
      <p>In Age of Empires games, players control citizens, soldiers and buildings from one of various historical eras, including samurai Japan, the Roman empire, and British redcoats. Resources are collected to create buildings which churn out fighting units. These buildings are upgraded via an elongated tech-tree, which creates more advanced fighters including melee, range and artillery. Each civilization’s units have their own advantages and disadvantages.</p>
      <p><i>Age of Empires 4</i> continues this tradition, but today’s trailer shows how much detail Relic is aiming for, both in terms of static items like buildings, and via the number of combat units on screen at any one time. We’ll have more on <i>Age of Empires 4</i> in the months ahead.</p>
