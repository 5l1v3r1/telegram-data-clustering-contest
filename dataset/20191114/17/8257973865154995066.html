      <p>Nov. 14 (UPI) -- A pair of British doctors broke a Guinness World Record by riding over 18,000 miles across the world on a tandem bicycle in 218 days, 22 hours.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2019/11/doctors-pedal-more-than-28-000-km-to-circumnavigate-the-globe-on-a-tandem-598302/">Guinness announced</a> Thursday, designated as this year's <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Guinness_World_Records/?tps=1">Guinness World Records</a> Day, that Lloyd Collier and Louis Snellgrove broke the previous record for fastest circumnavigation by tandem bicycle (male) by nine days.</p>
      <p>The pair, who both work as doctors in Australia, set off from Adelaide, South Australia, Aug. 7, 2018, and finished their journey May 16, 2019.</p>
      <p>The men rode more than 18,000 miles across Australia, Asia, Europe and North America to raise money for Spinal Research and the Brain Foundation.</p>
      <p>"The entire journey was littered with mechanical failures and makeshift repairs," Collier said. "Cycling through India in particular, we became incredibly inventive in fixing mechanical components in non-conventional ways."</p>
