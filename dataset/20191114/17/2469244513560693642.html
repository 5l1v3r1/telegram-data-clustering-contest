      <p>“As soon as a member of staff was made aware of the man choking, staff and customers called the emergency services.</p>
      <p>“The duty manager then spoke with the emergency services. He was guided through some procedures. A customer stepped in saying they were first aid trained and started to give CPR until the paramedics arrived 5-10 minutes later and they then took over.</p>
      <p>“At this time the duty manager started to clear the immediate area of customers and also stopped people coming into the pub.</p>
      <p>“The paramedics managed to revive the customer and then an air ambulance took the customer to hospital.</p>
      <p>"The family of the customer called the pub the following day to say he had passed away and thanked the team for their efforts.</p>
