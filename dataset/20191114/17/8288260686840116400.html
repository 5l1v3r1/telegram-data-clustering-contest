      <p>A gunman who fled to Dubai after shooting a man dead in a gang-related feud has been jailed for life.</p>
      <p>Keanu Bedward will serve at least 30 years after being found guilty of murdering Remal Hunt by a jury at Birmingham Crown Court.</p>
      <p>The killer dumped the revolver in a reservoir after fatally shooting the 28-year-old victim in Church Road, Erdington, on April 18 this year.</p>
      <p>Bedward, 24, of Norfolk Road, Erdington, had denied the charge.</p>
      <p>After the sentencing hearing, the victim's family said the killer had "ripped their hearts out".</p>

      <p>Passing sentence, Judge Simon Drew QC said: "This was an incident that took place in a public street in the middle of the day.</p>
      <p>"After the incident you made a speedy get away and disposed of the weapon in circumstances where you no doubt hoped it would never be found.</p>
      <p>"You then fled abroad at speed.</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>"It would appear this offence was in some way gang-related. Certainly you were known to each other.</p>
      <p>"Whether this in fact involved gangs is not entirely clear.</p>
      <p>"Undoubtedly there was bad feeling between the two of you.</p>

      <p>"Precisely what caused that I am not in a position to make a determination.</p>
      <p>"Clearly this was not pre-planned and it was, to that extent, spontaneous.</p>
      <p>"You were armed and ready to deal with the situation if it arose."</p>
      <p>In a statement the victim's sister, Shannon Dempsey, said: "The first born dead at the age of 28, cut short by the evil actions of an individual.</p>
      <p>"He was a happy and smiling young man with three beautiful children.</p>

      <p>"You ripped our heart out and stamped on it. That pain will never leave us."</p>
      <p>The court heard both men had been in cars and that, after the incident, Bedward sped off in a Golf.</p>
      <p>Mr Hunt, who was shot in the chest, was pronounced dead shortly afterwards.</p>
      <p>Bedward boarded a flight to Dubai but was arrested when he returned ten days later.</p>
      <p>West Midlands Fire Service crews found a black Nike bag filled with stones when they conducted a training exercise near Bartley Green Reservoir a few days before Bedward returned to the UK.</p>
      <p>Inside it was the revolver used in the shooting which had four bullets still in the chamber.</p>
      <p>Kevin Metzger, defending, said the defendant had come back to face justice.</p>
      <p>He said the shooting came against the background of WhatsApp messages and a previous shooting when a shotgun was found, bearing the DNA of a number of people including Mr Hunt.</p>
      <p>Mr Metzger said, on the day, the victim had been a passenger in a car which had stopped in the middle of Church Road, causing the vehicle behind it to come to a halt.</p>
