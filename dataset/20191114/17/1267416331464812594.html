      <h1>Apple might bundle TV, news and music under one subscription in 2020</h1>
      <h2>It's unclear how much this bundle would cost</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T17:48:34+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 17:48</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mobilesyrup.com/author/patrickorourke" target="_blank">Patrick O'Rourke</a></address>
      <p>It’s been rumoured for months that Apple could have plans to bundle all of its platforms under one fee to bolster its subscription offerings.</p>
      <p>Now, according to a recent<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-14/apple-mulls-bundling-digital-subscriptions-as-soon-as-2020"><i> Bloomberg</i></a> report, this shift might happen as soon as 2020. The publication states that Apple’s recent deal with publishers includes a provision that would allow News+ to be included in this bundle. Reports have also emerged regarding Apple working out a similar deal with record <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/10/07/apple-super-bundle-news-arcade-music-media/">labels when it comes to Apple Music</a>.</p>
      <p>Packing all of its platforms —<a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/03/25/list-canadian-publications-apple-news/"> Apple News+</a>, <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/11/01/apple-tv-plus-canada-primer/">Apple TV+</a>, <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/11/14/apple-music-playlist-recaps-music-2019/">Apple Music</a> and <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/09/19/apple-arcade-now-available-in-canada/">Apple Arcade</a> — under one unified banner makes sense given the company’s push to transition to services over the last few years.</p>
      <p>What’s unclear is precisely how much this bundle might cost, particularly in Canada.</p>
      <p>Apple News+ is priced at $12.99 CAD, Apple TV+ is $5.99, Apple Music costs $9.99 and Apple Arcade is $4.99. The price for all these services under one bundle would likely be somewhere in the $25 CAD range. There’s also a possibility that Apple could charge $30 and include some amount of addition iCloud storage.</p>
      <p>It’s also unclear how the record label and publisher cut of subscription fees would change with this bundle.</p>
      <p>As always, these are just rumours. We’ll have to wait for 2020 to know for sure what Apple’s plans to bundle its services are.</p>
