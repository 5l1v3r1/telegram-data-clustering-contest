      <h1>Sonny Bill Williams is unveiled by his new Canadian side... in London</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T17:14:49+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 17:14</time> by <a rel="author">Josh Raisey</a></address>
      <p>Former <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/new-zealand">All Blacks</a> centre <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/blues/players/sonny-bill-williams/">Sonny Bill Williams</a> has been unveiled by rugby league’s Toronto Wolfpack ahead of the 2020 Super League season.</p>
      <p>The event took place at the Emirates Stadium, the London home of Arsenal Football Club, revealing what is the most lucrative deal in either rugby codes’ history.</p>
      <p>The dual World Cup winner finished his union career for <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/new-zealand">New Zealand</a> against <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/wales">Wales</a> in the bronze final of the 2019 RWC earlier this month, but his future was still unclear after that game.</p>
      <p>The 34-year-old Williams even revealed to Sky Sports that “at the start of this year I’d never expect to be sitting here right now”, explaining that his sole attention had been on playing for the All Blacks.</p>
      <p>But after Steve Hansen’s side failed in their bid to win three successive tournaments when they were beaten by <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/england">England</a> in the semi-final, there would have been a <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/news/its-official-sonny-bill-williams-joins-toronto-wolfpack/">surge of interest for one of the game’s biggest stars</a>.</p>

      <p>Williams is unquestionably the biggest dual code rugby player, having won the NRL with both the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/mitre-10-cup/teams/canterbury">Canterbury</a> Bulldogs and the Sydney Roosters, as well as the plethora of titles in union.</p>
      <p>Williams’ two-year deal with the Canadian outfit is worth $NZ5m a season, which is the biggest deal in rugby’s history.</p>

      <p>However, this is widely regarded as the most high profile deal in Super League history and is expected to boost the code’s popularity immeasurable in England, the southern hemisphere and North America.</p>
      <p>The Wolfpack have only just been promoted to the Super League but they are clearly intent on making a statement in 2020. They have also been linked with England’s <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/leicester/players/manu-tuilagi/">Manu Tuilagi</a>, as well as fellow RWC star <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/bordeaux/players/semi-radradra/">Semi Radradra</a>, who also had a successful spell in league.</p>
      <p>The new Super League season does not start until late January, with Toronto opening their schedule against Castleford as part of a double-header at Headingley on February 2.</p>
