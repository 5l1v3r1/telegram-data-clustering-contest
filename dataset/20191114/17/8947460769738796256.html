      <p>Designworks, a BMW Group company specialized in coming up with innovative industrial designs, unveiled its latest creation today. Working with Taiwanese startup airline, Starlux, the BMW subsidiary unveiled the cabin design for the upcoming A321neo aircraft which will start flying in early 2020. Designworks has worked across all interior touchpoints as well as the seating in Starlux’s A321neos economy and business class.</p>

      <p>With the design focusing entirely on the passenger experience, <a href="https://www.bmwblog.com/2019/05/31/bmw-designworks-helped-design-this-fuel-cell-powered-flying-taxi/">Designworks</a> created a homelike atmosphere for the traveler. The new interiors feature warm colors, rich appealing texture and innovative materials to provide superior comfort and convenience. All features like seating, fabrics and surfaces are custom-made designs. Unlike many other agencies in the field, the BMW subsidirary benefits from its global network of innovative manufacturers that are closely linked to the automotive industry.</p>
      <p>The project was directed by the company’s <a href="https://www.bmwblog.com/2011/04/19/bmw-group-designworksusa-opens-new-studio-in-shanghai/">Shanghai studio</a> in close collaboration with its two other studios in Los Angeles and Munich. “It is an extremely rare opportunity to be able to collaborate with a new airline to bring a modern luxury approach into aviation” says Nils Uellendahl, Design Director at Designworks’ Shanghai studio. “We design with a human-centric, systems approach; our overarching goal was to create memorable comfort experiences and a feeling of ‘being at home’ – we believe then, passengers will feel at ease and truly relaxed.”</p>
      <p>“With our unique portfolio and deep understanding of the Asian market, Designworks is an excellent partner for STARLUX, a startup company that also has connectivity, technology and dynamism as its core values. Future mobility for us means better human experiences. With Designworks’ holistic design approach, we were able to come up with a concept that once again challenges the perception of aviation”, said Holger Hampf, President of Designworks.</p>
      <p>Economy class seating features bright and natural colors, and ultra-thin seatbacks engineered to increase legroom. For a maximum of personal space on the business class, Designworks created an even more settled and tranquil environment. The seat is the first narrow-body airliner seat in Taiwan that can transform into an 82-inch fully flat bed – with a seat control panel beside the headrest so that the passenger can easily return the seat to an upright position.</p>
