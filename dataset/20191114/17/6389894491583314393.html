      <h1>David Pipe: Ramses will relish every drop of rain that falls</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T17:37:50+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 17:37</time> by <a rel="author">Bill Esdaile</a></address>
      <p>AFTER a summer break it’s great to be back with my regular weekly column, and I can start with the news that we are already up and running with our new City AM syndicate horse.</p>
      <p><b>COLLINGWOOD COURT</b> made a pleasing enough start for us at Ascot a fortnight ago in what was a pretty hot bumper.</p>
      <p>Tom [Scudamore] was pleased with him and feels he will come on plenty for the run.</p>
      <p>I guess it will be hurdles for him next time and I’m hoping he has a bright future.</p>
      <p>It was lovely to meet a few of you at the races and I look forward to getting to know a lot more over the coming weeks and months.</p>
      <p>We are also in the process of looking out for a second horse for the syndicate, so if you are interested in getting involved do get in touch.</p>
      <p>The National Hunt season supposedly really gets going with this weekend’s November Meeting at Cheltenham, so it’s a real shame that all this rain has caused this afternoon’s first day to be abandoned.</p>
      <p>I had declared four runners, but we will have to think up other plans for them.</p>
      <p>That said, <b>WARTHOG</b> will now join <b>EAMON AN CNOIC</b> in tomorrow’s feature, the BetVictor Gold Cup (2.25pm).</p>
      <p>Both will love all this rain and I have genuine grounds to be optimistic about both of them.</p>
      <p>Warthog lost his way a little last term but goes well fresh and sneaks in here off a light weight.</p>
      <p>As for Eamon An Cnoic, he ran a cracker behind favourite Siruh Du Lac when fourth in the Festival Plate.</p>
      <p>I’m hoping the swing at the weights will get us closer to him, although he’s only a young horse and I’m conscious he will improve again too.</p>
      <p>Our fella often shapes like this trip stretches him, but he ran well for a long way in the 3m1f handicap here at the Festival a couple of years ago so that shouldn’t be a problem.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere tomorrow, I’m looking forward to seeing <b>RAMSES DE TEILLEE</b> back out in the staying handicap (1.50pm).</p>
      <p>He is another who will relish all this rain and should go well despite having to shoulder a big weight.</p>
      <p>The ground was pretty bad when he won over hurdles here last time and it’s nice to come here with a decent run under his belt.</p>
      <p>Another one of mine to keep an eye on tomorrow is <b>REMASTERED</b> who will probably run in the 2m5f handicap hurdle (3.30pm).</p>
      <p>Regular followers of this column will know that he is a horse I have always held in high regard and both the trip and ground should be spot on for him.</p>
      <p>His recent run at Chepstow should have blown the cobwebs away and I’m hoping he will run a decent race.</p>
