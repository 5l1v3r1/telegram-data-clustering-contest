      <p>Mr Menard, a father of three, had been planning on going on a family trip to Disney World - but now his loved ones have to plan his send off.</p>
      <p>A tweet by Worcester Fire Dept said: "It is with a heavy heart that Chief Michael Lavoie announces the devastating loss of Lt. Jason Menard, a member of WFD since 2010 assigned to Ladder 5, Group 2 at McKeon Road Fire Station.</p>

      <p>"He leaves behind his wife Tina, 3 children &amp; parents. Please keep them in your prayers."</p>
      <p>Mr Lavoie told a news conference Mr Menard "heroically and selflessly saved his crew, helping a probationary firefighter to the stairs and then returning to rescue another trapped firefighter, assisting him out the window."</p>
      <p>The blaze then overtook the third floor and Mr Menard was not able to escape.</p>
      <p>Mr Menard helped with search and rescue mission inside the house, and made sure the mum and baby escaped safely.</p>
      <p>He also helped free two colleagues, newlywed Chris Pace, and a probationary firefighter.</p>

      <p>Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker said: "It's because of brave men and women like Lt. Menard and his team that we all rest easy at night.</p>
      <p>"We must always be eternally grateful for their service and their sacrifice.</p>
      <p>"He epitomised the devotion, camaraderie and bravery that make up the fabric of the Worcester Fire Department."</p>
