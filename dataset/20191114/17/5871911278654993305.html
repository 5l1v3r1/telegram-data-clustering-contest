      <p>Andrew Ladd’s stay in Bridgeport is going to be extended.</p>
      <p>The Islanders placed Ladd on waivers on Thursday for the purpose of re-assigning him to AHL Bridgeport, according to <a href="https://www.newsday.com/sports/hockey/islanders/andrew-ladd-waivers-bridgeport-1.38577156?utm_source=tw_sp">Newsday’s Andrew Gross</a>. Islanders general manager told Gross that the move was a deviation from their original plan for Ladd, but the veteran forward was made aware and is supportive of the plan.</p>

      <p>Ladd had been in Brideport on a five-game conditioning stint and told <a href="https://thesportsdaily.com/2019/11/02/andrew-ladd-feels-good-after-first-game-back/">Islander Insight’s Michael Zahn</a> that his knee felt good after his first game on Nov. 2.</p>
      <p>“That’s what I wanted to feel today,” Ladd said. “The hands weren’t quite there yet. They’ll catch up to the feet eventually.”</p>
