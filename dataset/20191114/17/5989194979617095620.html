        <b>Six Glock-17 pistols and 300 dumdum bullets have been stolen from the building that houses the offices of Sweden's prime minister, to the embarrassment of the country's government.</b>

      <p>"They don't want this to come out, it's all being hushed up," a source told <a href="https://www.dagensjuridik.se/nyheter/dagens-juridik-avslojar-vapen-stulna-inne-pa-rosenbad/">Dagens Juridik</a>, Sweden's leading legal newspaper, which broke the story.</p>
      <p>The weapons and the ammunition were kept in a weapons cabinet in the Rosenbad building, next to Stockholm's Royal Palace. They were intended to be handed out to the buildings security guards in the event of a major security incident, such as a terror threat or attack.</p>
      <p>But when it were moved during the current renovation of the building, the arms cache disappeared. Securitas, the company responsible for the building's security and for the weapons cabinet, has so far not been able to find them despite an extensive search.</p>
      <p>"Someone has probably managed to get them out of the building," Dagens Juridik's source said. "The weapons are supposed to be signed out by whoever has them. No one knows how someone got inside the cabinet and took them."</p>
      <p>The source said the disappearance of the dumdum bullets, which expand on impact to make a large wound, was perhaps more worrying than that of the pistols themselves.</p>
      <p>"It's ammunition which is created to do as much damage as possible," the source said.</p>

      <p>Joanna Ljunggren, a press secretary for the Swedish Police Authority, confirmed that a police report had been filed over the case on October 25th.</p>
      <p>The Swedish Government Offices (Regeringskansliet), which is also housed in the building, also confirmed that Securitas had reported an incident to the police.</p>
      <p>"The Swedish Government Offices has received information that one of our security contractors has made a police report," said Cajsa Holm, the organization's press spokesperson.</p>
      <p>Stockholm city prosecutor Lucas Eriksson, meanwhile, confirmed that he was leading an investigation into a robbery from the Swedish Government Offices, but would give no further details of the case.</p>
      <p>As well as the offices of Prime Minister Stefan Löfven, the Rosenbad building holds the offices of Justice Minister Morgan Johansson.</p>
      <p>Stefan Löfven's press secretary Gösta Brunnander told the Expressen newspaper that the prime minister had no comments to make on the incident.</p>
