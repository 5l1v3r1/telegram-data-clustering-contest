      <h1>Nokia's Black Friday Sale Knocks £20 Off a Couple of Handsets</h1>

      <p>If you're after a new phone but don't want to break the bank, Nokia has slashed prices on the 7.2 and 6.2.</p>
      <p>The Black Friday discount is live now and runs up until December 3, which means you don't have to splurge pre-payday to make the most of it, which is always a good thing. Admittedly, the offer isn't <i>that</i> generous, but then the handsets aren't <i>that</i> pricey to start off with.</p>
      <p>First up is the <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/08/nokias-camera-company-has-leaked-a-photo-of-the-7-2-showing-off-a-triple-lens-circular-camera-array/">Nokia 7.2</a> with a 48MP triple camera and and special Zeiss optics, offering three bokeh modes, reduced from £229.99 from £249.99. It's joined by the Nokia 6.2 which comes sans Zeiss, and with a cameras that isn't quite as good as the 7.2, but that's reflected in the price, which is usually £199.99 but has been dropped down to £179.99.</p>
      <p>The devices are <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/09/ifa-2019-nokia-also-has-new-versions-of-the-7-2-and-6-2-smartphones-coming-soon/">refreshed versions</a> of the of the original Nokia 7.2 and 6.2 and only just <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/10/nokia-7-2-6-2-uk-release/">launched last month</a>.</p>
      <p>You can pick up the 6.2 in Ceramic Black, and Ice, with the black variant being a Carphone Warehouse exclusive colour until December 3, which is when the offer ends. The 7.2 is available in Cyan Green, Charcoal, and Ice.</p>
