      <h1>Which Newcastle United players are out of contract in 2020?</h1>
      <h2>As the Magpies look ahead to the January transfer window, we look at who is at risk of leaving the club next summer</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T17:30:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 17:30</time> by <a rel="author">Sean McCormick</a></address>
      <p>After a difficult start to the season, Newcastle United sit in a solid 13th position as we enter the final international break of 2019.</p>
      <p>New Magpies boss Steve Bruce will have one eye on the forthcoming January transfer window, but will first assess if he needs to strengthen his squad.</p>
      <p>However, a number of his players are into the final year of their deal at the club and it will be interesting to see how many earn a new contract.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/mo-diame">Mo Diame</a> was the only senior player to leave the club last summer on a free transfer.</p>
      <p>But what of the players who could leave United on a free next summer?</p>
      <p>Below, we profile the senior <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Newcastle</a> players whose contract runs out in 2020, according to <a href="https://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/afc-sunderland/vertragsende/verein/289">transfermarkt.co.uk.</a></p>
      <h3>Karl Darlow</h3>
      <p>The arrival of Martin Dubravka in January 2018 resulted in Darlow losing his place as Newcastle No 1.</p>
      <p>The Magpies shot-stopper has been linked with moves away in the past but as of last summer he was keen for contract talks with Newcastle.</p>
      <p>The 28-year-old was restricted to just one appearance last season though and as he heads in to his prime years he may well want to seek pastures new at the end of his contract.</p>

      <h3>Rob Elliot</h3>
      <p>Elliot is in his eighth season at Newcastle United and bar an exceptional change of circumstances, it is likely going to be his last.</p>
      <p>The 33-year-old was Newcastle's Player of the Year during the 2015/16 season but he now finds himself as United's fourth choice goalkeeper.</p>
      <p>The former Charlton keeper has been deemed surplus to requirements, but is settled in the area and has no plans to leave the club this summer.</p>

      <h3>Javi Manquillo</h3>
      <p>Manquillo has often polarised opinion among Newcastle supporters.</p>
      <p>The former Liverpool, Atletico Madrid and Sunderland right-back has shown glimpses of quality during his two seasons on Tyneside but DeAndre Yedlin's return from injury has seen him drop down the pecking order again.</p>
      <p>Emil Krafth was signed in the summer, and Manquillo now struggles to feature in the matchday squad.</p>

      <h3>Federico Fernandez</h3>
      <p>Fernandez began the season out of the United line-up, but Fabian Schar's knee injury gave him his chance - and he hasn't looked back. He scored in the 3-2 win at West Ham, and helped set up Ciaran Clark's winner against Bournemouth, along with some impressive performances at the back.</p>
      <p>At 30, Fernandez is at the wrong end of the preferred age scale of Newcastle's hierarchy and a lot will depend on game-time and the importance of the former Swansea man to Newcastle in the season ahead as to whether he stays at the club beyond the 2019/20 campaign.</p>
      <p>Jamaal Lascelles' injury means he is likely to continue to feature, although Florian Lejeune is also set to return from injury soon.</p>

      <h3>Ki Sung-yueng</h3>
      <p>The South Korean international endured a stop-start first season at Newcastle, and is out of the first-team picture all together now.</p>
      <p>Injuries and the Asian Cup restricted Ki to just 18 appearances last term and and he is now sbehind Sean Longstaff, Jonjo Shelvey and Isaac Hayden and Matty Longstaff in the midfield pecking order.</p>
      <p>Like Fernandez, a lot will depend on the extent of the 30-year-old's contribution to the Newcastle cause this season as to whether he is offered fresh terms.</p>

      <h3>Jack Colback</h3>
      <p>Colback spent the past two seasons on loan at Nottingham Forest, and didn't make Steve Bruce's Premier League squad this term.</p>
      <p>The former Sunderland man appears to have no future on Tyneside.</p>

      </figure>
      <h3>Matty Longstaff</h3>
      <p>United are keen to tie the younger Longstaff brother down to a new deal, with his current contract expiring in June 2020.</p>
      <p>He burst on to the scene in the 1-0 win over Manchester United, earning an England Under-20 call up.</p>
      <p>Talks are ongoing, but there has yet to be a breakthrough.</p>
