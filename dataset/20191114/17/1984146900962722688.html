      <p>Martin, a financial guru who has become a household name thanks to his handy tricks, tips and hacks, has his own ITV1 show.</p>
      <p>And he also regularly appears on a string of ITV daytime favourites, from Good Morning Britain and This Morning to Lorraine.</p>
      <p>His latest advice, issued to Brits across the country, will earn you a welcome windfall of just under £200.</p>
      <p>All you need to do is switch bank accounts, as currently four banks will pay you to join them.</p>
      <p>"Switching only takes seven working days, and with most, you can get the bonus within a month of that," Martin says.</p>
      <p>"That's about 40 days, meaning it's still possible to bag the cash before 25 December, though even if you don't quite make that date, you'll have it to ease the Jan squeeze - when the gap between paydays is long."</p>
      <h3>Martin says switch to any of these four accounts NOW:</h3>
