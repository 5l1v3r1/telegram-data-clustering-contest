      <h1>Man dubbed Plug Sadist 'made girls give themselves electric shocks over Skype'</h1>
      <h2>The 30-year-old was allegedly so persuasive that he even managed to convince the girls' parents to help in his 'experiments' and made recording of their suffering using Skype</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T17:23:06+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 17:23</time> by <a rel="author">Kathryn Quinn, Chiara Fiorillo</a></address>
      <p>A man is facing 88 counts of attempted murder after he allegedly made girls as young as 15 give themselves electric shocks while he watched on Skype.</p>
      <p>The 30-year-old, known as the Plug Sadist, is in court in Munich, Germany, accused of giving instructions to the women on how to give themselves potentially deadly 230v shocks.</p>
      <p>The man from Rimpar, in the German state of Bavaria, is identified only as David G. because of local privacy laws.</p>
      <p>He was so persuasive that he even managed to convince the girls' parents to help in his "experiments" and made recordings of their suffering using Skype, it is reported.</p>
      <p>It is claimed he targeted victims aged between 15 and 30 via eBay adverts, claiming to be Dr Christian Vogel who was looking for participants for a study on sexual electric shock fetishes saying they would receive £2,572 (3,000 EUR) for their participation.</p>

      <p>The court heard none of those that took part were ever paid.</p>
      <p>The electric cable was allegedly obtained by the women under his instructions when it was usually cut off of electrical devices in the house like clothes irons and music players.</p>
      <p>A video of one woman, 27, was shown to the court displaying scenes of her chat with David G.</p>
      <p>She allegedly agreed to take part in the so-called study.</p>
      <p>In the video, which has not been released, the alleged victim can be seen turning round, before the camera moves to her naked feet where cables and a power distributor can be seen.</p>
      <p>The woman is seen putting her toes around a nail sticking out of a plug socket, then kneeling down, putting a plug in the plughole and using a spoon to stroke across her feet.</p>
      <p>She then screams loudly before grabbing her foot.</p>
      <p>The woman, from the German capital Berlin, told the court that it happened four years ago and she agreed to the experiments as she was desperate for the money.</p>
      <p>In court, judge Thomas Bott asked Natalie P.: "Do you know this man?"</p>
      <p>She answered: "Of course I know him, but I have never met him in person."</p>
      <p>When asked why she participated, she said: "I had little money, and was looking for jobs on eBay ads. The accused contacted me and said he was working as a scientist and was conducting experiments into electric stimulation. He really made a serious impression. I agreed as I needed the money."</p>

      <p>The man's apparent academic title persuaded the woman, who said she also has a background in science.</p>
      <p>She added: "He gave me instructions and I had to use cables, a lamp, a metal and a wooden spoon. He then told me to put a metal nail between my toes and then touch the power and then to take the metal spoon and stroke it over the bottom of my foot. He said it would tickle a bit."</p>
      <p>She was asked to carry out two trial runs before David G. asked: "Can you try and keep your foot on there longer and show your foot to the camera."</p>
      <p>The woman said: "Do I really have to?" He answered: "Yes, unfortunately, I need you to do it on both feet."</p>
      <p>"In one of the attempts, I caught the cable and got a large shock. Every muscle cramped, my back spasmed, I struggled to breathe and was lying on the floor. On my hand I got a blister."</p>
      <p>She told the court: "230 volts of electricity were sent through my body, I realised it was a stupid idea. Who would build something with spoons and cables and connect it to the power? I was so embarrassed. But he appeared so serious and I just wanted the money."</p>
      <p>The case came to light after a 16-year-old was taken to hospital after falling unconscious.</p>
      <p>The prosecutor said: "When she regained consciousness she carried out the experiment again at least three times, losing consciousness every time. The girl was taken to hospital where she told doctors about the experiments and they informed the police."</p>
      <p>David G., who is an IT specialist and who the court heard had a fetish for feet, was arrested in February 2018.</p>
      <p>Judge Thomas Bolt, 52, ordered much of the proceedings to take place behind closed doors because the evidence in the court in part had to do with the man's sexual desires.</p>

      <p>He ruled that the public had no right to know about his sadism and his foot fetish saying: "It is a characteristic of this case that involves the satisfaction of sexual urges. Therefore the evidence will revolve around the sex life and intimate personal desires of the defendant. Accordingly the right to protect this information outweighs the desire to keep the public informed about the details."</p>
      <p>The prosecutor outlined details including the fact that many victims carried out the experiments multiple times and many suffered burns, cramps, heart irregularities and some even lost consciousness.</p>
      <p>He added: "The victims believed he was a scientist and there was no danger to them to carry out the experiment, that's why they agreed. But the accused was fully aware that 230 volts was enough to kill a person."</p>
      <p>David G.'s defence lawyers Klaus W. Spiegel and Matthias Bohn claim their client had diminished responsibility for his actions as he suffers from Asperger Syndrome and autism.</p>
      <p>He told his lawyers: "It was an attempt to communicate with the environment."</p>
      <p>Police were able to track down a large number of his alleged victims as he kept over a hundred Skype videos of the experiments on his PC.</p>
      <p>According to some reports, not all his alleged victims have been tracked down.</p>
      <p>The case continues.</p>
