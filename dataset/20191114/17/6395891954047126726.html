      <p><b>PROVIDENCE, R.I.Â (AP)</b> - A federal judge has sided with two Rhode Island cities that challenged the conditions of U.S. Department of Justice public safety grants they said in a lawsuit would turn local police into federal immigration agents.</p>
      <p>District Court Judge John McConnell Jr. in a ruling Thursday said "Congress has not granted the power to impose the conditions the DOJ imposed."</p>
      <p>The federal government, among other things, wanted cities receiving public safety grants to notify federal agents when immigrants in the country illegally are about to be released.</p>
      <p>Attorneys for Providence and Central Falls in a statement said they are pleased the court "found DOJ's attempts requiring our police departments to be agents of a federal immigration system to be unlawful."</p>
      <p>An email was left with the Justice Department seeking comment.</p>
