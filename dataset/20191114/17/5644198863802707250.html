      <p>GURGAON, India: The start of a leading Asian Tour golf tournament was held up Thursday (Nov 14) by <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/india-new-delhi-smog-haze-air-pollution-weather-12089708">toxic smog that has engulfed the Indian capital</a> with hazardous levels of pollution.</p>
      <p>Organisers of the four-day Panasonic Open India event said the tournament could be shortened if the pollution remains serious, as completing the event would be "a big challenge".</p>

      <p>Delhi and other cities across northern India are blanketed by a poisonous haze each winter due to build-up of traffic fumes, industrial emissions and smoke from agricultural fires.</p>
      <p>"The opening round of the Panasonic Open India was delayed due to poor visibility and weather conditions," an Asian Tour organiser told AFP.</p>

      <p>The first golfers went on the course five hours late and some wore anti-pollution masks.</p>
      <p>A photo posted on Twitter by the Asian Tour showed Bangladeshi golfer Mohammad Siddikur Rahman hitting a shot while wearing a face mask.</p>
      <p>The amount of PM2.5 - deadly tiny particles that get into the bloodstream and lungs - soared to about 20 times the safe limit set by the World Health Organisation.</p>
      <p>Delhi authorities <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/india-air-pollution-smog-quality-schools-reopen-12068778">closed all schools until Friday</a>, banned construction and are only allowing cars on the road depending on whether the registration is an odd or even number.</p>
      <p>The road rationing is meant to end on Friday, but Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said it could be extended.</p>
