      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T17:23:10+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 17:23</time> by <a rel="author">Hamilton Advertiser, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/hamilton-advertiser/</a></address>
      <p>A thug has been jailed for ten months after ordering his dog to attack three men, including a police officer.</p>
      <p>The men were all bitten by Stephen McCafferty’s Staffordshire bull terrier in Hamilton’s Burnbank area on June 21.</p>
      <p>McCafferty, 22, a prisoner, appeared at Hamilton Sheriff Court last week and admitted ordering the attacks.</p>
      <p>He also admitted assaulting an employee and robbing her of alcohol and scratchcards at Costcutters in the Burnbank Centre on the same day.</p>
      <p>McCafferty further admitted kicking a door that slammed into and injured a member of staff at nearby Optical Express and stealing a mobile phone from a car.</p>
      <p>Defence agent Andy Iles said his client was addicted to street valium and had little memory of events.</p>
      <p>Mr Iles added: “He was shocked by what he did and shows genuine remorse. He has a limited number of previous convictions and nothing as serious as this.”</p>
      <p>Referring to a criminal justice social work report, Mr Iles said McCafferty had a difficult upbringing.</p>
      <p>He told Sheriff Thomas Millar: “These incidents were a culmination of various factors and were two decades in the making.”</p>
      <p>The sheriff told McCafferty: “This was a quite horrendous course of conduct which has to be marked by a period in custody.”</p>
