      <h1>Cardiff Council branded 'the grinch' after Christmas decorations budget slashed</h1>
      <h2>There's no big light switch on event again this year</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T17:01:30+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 17:01</time> by <a rel="author">Thomas Deacon</a></address>
      <p>Cardiff Council have been likened to the grinch after cancelling a hugely popular Christmas festival through the streets of the <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/cardiff">capital</a> and slashing the cost of their decorations.</p>
      <p>Less than ten years ago Cardiff Council spent £220,000 on lights and decorations and <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/christmas">festive shoppers</a> would look forward to a big event to mark their switch on.</p>
      <p>It was one of the highlights of the Christmas season and normally a famous face with a Welsh link, including Doctor Who's David Tennant, would switch on the Christmas lights to big fanfare as thousands lined the streets.</p>

      <p>Now only a few years later Cardiff Council said they now spend nothing on Christmas decorations and lights - with any money spent being recouped from revenue.</p>
      <p>In 2018 the city was lit up with the Step into Christmas event that saw dozens of different acts performing across Cardiff in front of hundreds of families.</p>
      <p>But this year Christmas is being introduced in a much more low key way - with no official light switching on ceremony and no return of the Christmas themed festival.</p>
      <p>In 2018 the council spent £40,000 on the Step into Christmas event - but shoppers in Cardiff won't see it returning this year.</p>
      <p>Although a number of other popular Christmas attractions are coming back this year, including Winter Wonderland and the market stalls around the city centre, a number of people aren't happy with what they say is a more "lacklustre" approach.</p>

      <p>According to a freedom of information request, between 2010 and 2014 the council had cut the Christmas light and decoration budget by almost half.</p>
      <p>In 2010 the council spent £220,000 on Christmas decorations and lights. But by 2014 that figure stood at £124,000.</p>
      <p>The council said for the past three years Christmas lights and decorations in Cardiff have been put up at a net-zero cost.</p>
      <p>Officials added that any money spent had been recouped through "revenue" - such as fees charged to operators of the Christmas markets and Winter Wonderland in the city centre.</p>

      <p>However, this year the Christmas lights in Cardiff will be switched on this Friday - but there will be no event to mark the occasion.</p>
      <p>Christopher Dawson, a professional Father Christmas, branded the local authority as the "grinch council that stole Christmas".</p>
      <p>He said: "Santa is sad to have to serve notice that Cardiff Council are on Santa's 'Naughty List' for letting down city centre shops, the open market and most of all, the children of Cardiff.</p>
      <p>"They really are the grinch council that stole christmas."</p>
      <p>A council spokesman said: “Last year the council faced a budget gap of approximately £25 million and difficult decisions had to be taken across all areas of the council. As part of plans to bridge this gap, Step into Christmas was removed from the city’s events calendar in the budget approved by Full Council in February 2019.</p>
      <p>"However, Cardiff is still recognised as having one of the strongest Christmas offerings in the UK.</p>
      <p>"Residents and visitors will be able to see the Christmas lights and tree, which will kick off the festive season alongside the 'Christmas Things’ late night event at Cardiff Central Market.</p>
      <p>"Visitors will also be able to enjoy the ever-popular Christmas chalets selling a range of gifts and crafts, and there is the return of Winter Wonderland with its ice rink, rides and an exciting new ice trail.</p>
      <p>"Families will be able to visit Santa as he takes up residence on Queen Street, and the first ever City of Arcades Day on November 16 should also be bring more festive cheer to the city.”</p>
      <p>Winter Wonderland is already open this year with a new layout to previous years.</p>
      <p>Last year's massive <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/tried-cardiff-winter-wonderlands-new-15419262">drop tower might be gone</a> - but it's been replaced with an equally impressive Big Wheel.</p>
      <p>Executive director of FOR Cardiff Adrian Field said: “FOR Cardiff have arranged some exciting activities and events over the festive period in the heart of the city. These include The City of Arcades Day on Saturday 16th November, the return of the Gingerbread Mun House and an exciting surprise from the 1 of December.</p>
      <p>"We’ve invested heavily in our Christmas campaign which includes a TV advert that premiers on screens from Monday 18th November with supporting advertising across Cardiff, Swansea and Newport.</p>
      <p>“We hope it will all inspire people to choose Cardiff as their destination for a festive day out.”</p>
