      <p>Toure spent eight highly successful seasons with City in the Premier League, and won three league titles between 2010 and 2018.</p>
      <p>The 36-year-old most recently plied his trade in China with Qingdao Huanghai, but seemingly hinted at a return to the EPL during a recent interview with<i> Sky Sports.</i></p>
      <p>"I would love it (to return to the Premier League), but it depends on which kind of team," Toure said.</p>
      <p>"We will see because, sometimes in Europe, people look at ages in a different way – it's not about that. It depends on the club and what they want to achieve.</p>
      <p>"I don't want to go too far and propose myself, but I just want them to give me a chance, we will see."</p>

      <p>The Ivorian is currently preparing to acquire his coaching badges, but believes he still has a few years left as a player.</p>
      <p>"In my mind, I give myself one or maybe two years maximum playing football. After that, I want to enjoy myself with my family and try to work in other ways,” Toure added.</p>
      <p>"I want to be proud of myself. As a footballer, sometimes when you stop it early, it is because people are trying to stop you, it's not coming from your heart, it's complicated.</p>
      <p>"I remember when I was in Greece and people were speculating about my career – I was not happy. Something was missing. I want to be in control.</p>
      <p>"I think I have to start to do my badges. Football has been all my life from when I was a kid until now. Football is part of me and I can stop watching football or being part of it."</p>

      <p>Toure scored 62 league goals in 230 appearances for City according to the Premier League's official website, and ranks as the competition's fifth-highest African goalscorer of all time.</p>
