      <p>Accra, Nov. 14, GNA - Dr Mary Chinery-Hesse, the Chancellor of the University of Ghana (UG) Thursday said she is satisfied with the processes put in place to interrogate the recent allegations of harassment against some staff members.</p>
      <p>The University, she said, would not condone any form of sexual harassment but remain committed to its zero tolerance of sexual abuses policy.</p>
      <p>Speaking at the Congregation of the College of Humanities, at Legon, the chancellor said the Management was resolute about making the campus completely free from all forms of sexual harassment and abuses.</p>
      <p>At the ceremony, 385 students were honoured with first degrees as part of the three-day November Congregations.</p>
      <p>Two senior lecturers have been interdicted to pave way for investigations into sexual harassment complaints against them.</p>
      <p>This follows a BBC documentary titled,”Sex for Grades”, which captured their alleged misconduct.</p>
      <p>Dr Chinery-Hesse cautioned members of the University Staff against indulging in any behaviour that contravened the University’s Code of Conduct.</p>
      <p>The name and recognition of the University must be preserved under any circumstance, she emphasised.</p>
      <p>She urged the students to take advantage of the complaint structures to report any sexual abuse, assuring that: “No one will suffer any form of victimisation a result of report”.</p>
      <p>The graduates should consciously let the experiences they had gathered in school to guide them in their future endeavours, she advised.</p>
      <p>Prof Ebenezer Oduro Owusu, the Vice chancellor, said a total of 18,212 applicants had been enrolled into the 2019/2020 Academic Year to pursue various programmes, with a female to male ratio of 51:49.</p>
      <p>He said the Management was considering various approaches towards addressing the accommodation challenges, especially in the anticipation of the first cohort of the Free Senior High School Policy.</p>
      <p>The University’s Land Lease Committee was, therefore, in negotiations with private bodies to expand the housing options on campus; while the Students’ Representative Council had also started the processes to embark on a 25,000-bed capacity hostel project.</p>
      <p>Prof Oduro Owusu urged the graduates to go out to the world with respect, commitment, integrity and loyalty, which he said, were the core values of the University.</p>
      <p>Mrs Doris Ahiati, Co-Founder and the Chief Executive Officer of Crescendo Consult, said as technology was changing the world, graduates ought to appreciate the ability to work in every environment.</p>
      <p>“Your office may even be in your bedroom; while working with colleague team members in a virtual environment.</p>
      <p>She urged the graduates to become leaders for themselves, adding that, leaders were open to new ideas and technology.</p>
      <p>They were also disciplined and paid the price of sacrifice when demanded.</p>
      <p>She advised them to expand the scope of their networks, explaining that networks thrived on emotional intelligence.</p>
