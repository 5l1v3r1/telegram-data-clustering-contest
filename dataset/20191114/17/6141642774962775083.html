      <p>Former Catalan minister Clara Ponsati has been released on bail after appearing in court in Edinburgh as Spanish authorities seek her extradition.</p>
      <p>Ms Ponsati, a professor at St Andrews University, handed herself in to police on Thursday as she faces a charge of sedition over her role in Catalonia’s unsanctioned independence referendum in 2017.</p>
      <p>She could be sentenced to 15 years behind bars if convicted, with nine other Catalan officials given jail sentences of between nine and 13 years for the same offence last month.</p>

      <p>“Clara trusts that her fate now lies in the hands of the Scottish justice system, which she believes to be impartial, robust and independent.</p>
      <p>“Our legal system will not be swayed by such interference or threats and will come to a decision based on the law.</p>

      <p>Ms Ponsati faces a single charge of sedition which relates to the organising of the referendum in her role as education minister, Mr Anwar said.</p>
      <p>The legal team has been instructed to defend her from what she describes as “judicially motivated revenge”, he added.</p>

      <p>However, the warrant was accepted by UK authorities for execution following a clarification from Spain’s Supreme Court judge Pablo Llarena.</p>
      <p>A procedural hearing is scheduled to take place on December 12 and the full hearing is likely to take place in the spring.</p>
