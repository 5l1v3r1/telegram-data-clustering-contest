      <p>TORONTO — The Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada is now requiring the mandatory reporting of any cybersecurity incidents at occur at the investment firms it regulates.</p>
      <p>Under the new rules, firms have to report to the industry regulator any cybersecurity incidents in two stages.</p>
      <p>In the first stage, firms have three days to provide a preliminary description of the incident and steps taken.</p>
      <p>The second stage allows firms 30 days to provide a detailed investigation report, outlining the cause and scope of the issue, and steps taken to mitigate the risk of harm to investors and to the firm.</p>
      <p>IIROC says the mandatory reporting will allow it to analyze the information received for any trends, insights or intelligence and help improve the industry's cybersecurity preparedness.</p>
      <p>IIROC is the self-regulatory organization that oversees investment dealers and their trading activity in Canada's debt and equity markets.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, the Bank of Canada's chief operating officer said government bodies and the private sector need more ways to share information about cybersecurity threats.</p>
      <p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published Nov. 14, 2019.</p>
