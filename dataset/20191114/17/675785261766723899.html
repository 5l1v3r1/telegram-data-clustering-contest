      <h2>Caitlyn Jenner hopes to end her feud with the Kardashians and win their respect, along with that of the British public</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T17:45:35+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 17:45</time> by <a rel="author">Verity Sulway, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/verity-sulway/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/caitlyn-jenner">Caityln Jenner</a> hopes that her appearance on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!</a> will help to mend fences with the Kardashians.</p>
      <p>The 70-year-old will be starring in the show from next weekend, and is already in Australia getting to know her new camp mates.</p>
      <p>It's reported she signed up to the show in a bid to win back the respect of ex <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/kris-jenner">Kris Jenner</a> and her children and stepchildren Kylie, Kendall, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/kim-kardashian">Kim</a> , Khloe and Kourtney.</p>
      <p>Things have been tense for Caitlyn and the rest of the clan, following her divorce from Kris and later claims that Kris had been unsupportive of her transition.</p>

      <p>Kris recently responded publicly to every single individual tribute from her family - all except Caitlyn - revealing their relationship is still not on track.</p>
      <p>Khloe even branded her a "liar" and "not a good person" on Keeping Up With The Kardashians in 2017, and they did not speak for years.</p>
      <p>But her former nanny, Pam Behan, told <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/">The Sun</a> Caitlyn wants to prove herself to her estranged family.</p>
      <p>“I would say this is a move to gain the Kardashian girls’ and her ex Kris’s respect", she said.</p>

      <p>“The whole time I knew Bruce it seemed like none of them respected him that much.</p>
      <p>“What Kris said went. They loved him but he didn’t have too much of a say.</p>
      <p>“It’s no secret to anybody that Kris is a controlling person and she dominated that relationship.</p>
      <p>“I think Caitlyn finally feels she has a say. There might be a little bit of her trying to beat them at their own game too.</p>

      <p>“She is a super nice wonderful person but she is very competitive.</p>
      <p>“I think she wants to tell her story on her own terms. Is it meant to harm the Kardashians? I don’t think so.</p>
      <p>“But I just think she’s been quiet for so long and wants to tell the world what’s been going on all this time.</p>
      <p>“She knows that there are other people who have dealt with the same issues as her and she wants to let those people know its OK.”</p>

      <p>Pam added that she thinks Caitlyn was sick of the "judgemental people" in the US, and thinks the UK will receive her differently.</p>
      <p>She was nanny to the Kardashian children in the 90s, and wrote about her experiences in her memoir Malibu Nanny.</p>
      <p>She said she became aware of Caitlyn, then Bruce's gender identity when she walked in on her wearing women's underwear, but she chose to keep it private.</p>

      <p>Pam believes the Olympic gold medal-winning decathlete has the dedication and strength to go on to win the show.</p>
      <p>She said: “If you spend five minutes with Caitlyn you realise this is somebody who accomplishes what she sets out to do.</p>
      <p>“Her transition shows that – this is something she planned all her life and she was determined to make it happen.”</p>
