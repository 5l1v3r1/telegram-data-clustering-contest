      <p>A shocked mother claims she caught a nurse kicking, slapping and shaking her wheelchair-bound son on a hidden camera set up in her living room.</p>
      <p>Dawn Caldwell, from Tennessee, USA, was shocked when she witnessed the alleged abuse through a home security camera in July.</p>
      <p>Her 20-year-old son has Cerebral Palsy and is unable to speak or defend himself.</p>
      <p>Dawn told <a href="https://news3lv.com/news/nation-world/tennessee-mom-captures-nurse-assaulting-wheelchair-bound-son-with-cerebral-palsy">NBC News</a> : "He was hollering out, smacking the tray on his chair for hours after she [the nurse] would get him out of bed."</p>

      <p>Dawn decided to install a camera to monitor the situation while she and her husband went out for work.</p>
      <p>"On July 7, 2019 my husband and I left the house for a few hours. On our way back home something told me to pull up the cameras and watch what was going on," she added.</p>
      <p>"I pulled up the camera in the living room and something told me to hit the record button, I did."</p>
      <p>The video shows what appears to be the nurse kicking her son's foot, poking him in the face and shaking him.</p>
      <p>Smith was watching television while flipping pages of a book for him.</p>

      <p>Dawn rushed back home and asked Smith to leave the house.</p>
      <p>She then reported the incident to the Jackson County Sheriff's Office.</p>
      <p>Adult Protective Services and the Director for the Board of Nursing were notified as well.</p>
      <p>She said: "I don't want to see him upset. He doesn't cry like you and I, he doesn't have tears rolling down his face like you or I if we were to cry.</p>
      <p>"He can't come to me and say, 'hey, she has done this and I didn't like it' or something."</p>
      <p><a href="https://news3lv.com/news/nation-world/tennessee-mom-captures-nurse-assaulting-wheelchair-bound-son-with-cerebral-palsy">FoX 17 News</a> said nurse Malana Smith was charged with Class B Misdemeanor Assault and did enter into a pretrial diversion set for December.</p>
      <p>According to the Tennessee Department of Health, Smith's licence is set to expire on August 31, 2021.</p>
