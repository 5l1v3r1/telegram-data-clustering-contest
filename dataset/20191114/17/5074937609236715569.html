      <h1>CESRUD presents educational materials to KGs</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T17:55:43+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 17:55</time> by <a rel="author">Anthony Apubeo, GNA,</a></address>
      <p>Sumbrungu (UE), Nov 14, GNA- The Centre for Sustainable Rural Development, a humanitarian non-profit organisation has presented educational materials to 16 Kindergarten (KG) schools in the Bolgatanga North and West ‘B’ Circuits to improve teaching and learning.</p>
      <p>The materials included; the new curriculum for the KGs, pencils, sharpeners, crayons, cardboards, erasers and copies of My First Copy Book.</p>
      <p>The NGO is also constructing about 50 hexagonal tables and chairs to distribute to the various deprived schools to help reduce the furniture deficit in the area.</p>
      <p>The support is being sponsored by the Amsterdam- Bolgatanga Foundation, a Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO) that have over the years worked with CERSUD to improve the quality of education in the Bolgatanga Municipal of the Upper East Region.</p>
      <p>At a brief ceremony to hand over the items to the heads of the schools, Mr Rex Asanga, the Executive Director and Founder of CESRUD, explained that the gesture was part of their resolve to build the foundation of children for academic success.</p>
      <p>He said as part of the Amsterdam- Bolgatanga Foundation’s 2019 support to the schools, earlier this year, 44 hexagonal tables, 264 children’s chairs, 11 teachers’ tables and 11 teachers’ chairs were presented to the schools.</p>
      <p>He said also about 45 KG and Nursery teachers were trained on the new curriculum to make them appreciate the tenets of the new curriculum so as to impart positively onto the children.</p>
      <p>Mr Asanga noted that one’s educational success was founded on the quality of education the person received at the basic level especially the KG and Nursery levels, hence it was imperative for collective efforts to be forwarded at addressing some of the challenges facing basic schools.</p>
      <p>He challenged all the Metropolitan, Municipal and District Assemblies to prioritize basic education by providing the necessary infrastructure and materials that the schools were confronted with and make readily available teaching and learning materials.</p>
      <p>“What sin have children below five years committed such that when they go to school they do not have chairs to sit, some sit on the ground not floor because some of the classrooms’ floor are not good. We owe it a responsibility to get things right at the KG level by providing the necessary atmosphere for them to learn and appreciate things that are good,” he added.</p>
      <p>While commending the NGO for the support over the years, the Executive Director appealed to other NGOs and philanthropists to help improve quality of education in the area particularly at the KG level.</p>
      <p>Mr Godfrey Titigah, the Municipal Special Needs Education Coordinator, who represented the Mrs Anne Estella Kyee-ebo,  the Municipal Director of Education, commended CESRUD and its sponsors supporting education in the municipality.</p>
      <p>He said lack of furniture and poor sitting arrangements had affected the ability of children to write properly and therefore urged the teachers to put the materials into good use to achieve academic successes.</p>
      <p>The headteachers expressed gratitude to CESRUD and Amsterdam Bolgatanga Foundation for the support particularly the new curriculum for the KGs and said it was one of the facilities the schools lacked.</p>
