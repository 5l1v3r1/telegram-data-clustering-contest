      <p>Friends and family of a young Blantyre man who was found dead last week will don red, white and blue to his funeral tomorrow (Friday).</p>
      <p>The body of 20-year-old Kyle Monteith was discovered on Station Road, Blantyre, last Thursday morning, leaving his family, friends and girlfriend devastated.</p>
      <p>Police said that there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding his death.</p>
      <p>Mourners have been asked to wear red, white and blue in memory of the popular Rangers fan.</p>
      <p>Kyle’s heartbroken mum Keli Louise Alexander told the Advertiser this week: “We have asked everybody to wear red, white and blue as this is the colours of Kyle’s beloved Rangers Football Club.</p>
      <p>“He would have loved this.</p>
      <p>“We are also asking that people make a donation to Chris’s House charity – a charity set up by a Lanarkshire mum who lost her son to tragic circumstances.”</p>

      <p>Kyle’s mum said that the outpouring of support she has received over the last week has been overwhelming and <br/>that it reinforces just how loved her son was.</p>
      <p>She added: “I would like to thank my family and friends for all of their support.</p>
      <p>“I would also like to thank Young’s Funeral Directors for everything they have done for me.</p>
      <p>“I also must thank John Higgins for taking Kyle on as an apprentice, that was something I won’t forget.</p>
      <p>“Thanks also to Kyle’s best friends Graham and Ajay and, of course, his wider circle of friends. There are too many to mention individually, but thank you all.”</p>

      <p>Last weekend, in a touching gesture, more than 600 people attended a balloon release at Blantyre’s Kirkton Park in memory of Kyle.</p>
      <p>They also looked on as fireworks lit up the night sky.</p>
      <p>And on Remembrance Sunday, ahead of Blantyre Vics Amateur Football Club’s fixture, players and officials observed a minute’s silence for both Kyle and the country’s fallen war heroes.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for the team said: “Kyle was a friend and former teammate to many of the boys in our squad and also had been trained by some of our coaches back when he played through the ranks with Lanarkshire Sports Club and Blantyre Thistle.</p>
      <p>“The community has been left in a state of shock by his sudden death and we send our sincerest condolences to his family.</p>
      <p>“RIP Kyle.”</p>

      <p>His devastated girlfriend Elle Jean took to social media this week to post a touching tribute and said: “You were so, so loved, Kyle.</p>
      <p>“The past year and a bit I have known you has been the happiest time of my life and I will cherish those memories forever.</p>
      <p>“Never knew heartache like this. If only he could see how loved he really was.</p>
      <p>“If anybody is ever feeling low or down, my DMs are open to absolutely anybody.</p>
      <p>“No matter where you are in life or what’s going on, someone always loves you and you will leave so many people heartbroken.”</p>
      <p>Kyle will be laid to rest on Friday, November 15, at 9.30am at South Lanarkshire Crematorium, High Blantyre.</p>
