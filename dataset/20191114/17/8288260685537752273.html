      <h1>Pundit makes big Leeds United transfer claim - and it will interest Aston Villa and Man United</h1>
      <h2>Latest Aston Villa transfer news includes claims over Kalvin Phillips who has recently been linked with Manchester United</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T17:03:52+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 17:03</time> by <a rel="author">Shane Ireland, https://www.facebook.com/ShaneIrelandJournalist</a></address>
      <p>Kalvin Phillips has a release clause in his contract allowing him to leave if Leeds United don’t win promotion, according to Noel Whelan.</p>
      <p>Phillips, 23, has been linked with a move to the Premier League after becoming a mainstay of Marcelo Bielsa’s side at Elland Road.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa</a> were firmly interested during the summer transfer window when Phillips was a leading target after the play-off triumph in May.</p>
      <p>But they couldn’t agree a fee with Leeds, who rejected bids, and the midfielder stayed put for another shot at promotion with his boyhood club.</p>
      <p>Since then, Manchester United have also been credited with an interest amid <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/leeds-phillips-man-united-villa-17239857">reports they have been scouting Phillips this season.</a></p>

      <p>He signed a new contract in August and Whelan has claimed that as part of that deal, suitors can activate a get-out clause in the summer if Leeds fail to return to the Premier League.</p>
      <p>“Kalvin’s contract is based on promotion," the former Whites player told <a href="https://www.footballinsider247.com/whelan-names-first-two-leeds-united-stars-to-go-if-promotion-fails/">Football Insider.</a> "He has a release clause allowing him to go for a set price – more than £20million – if we don’t go up.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Leeds are believed to have turned down offers in the region of £20m for Phillips in the summer and Villa looked elsewhere to add to their options in the middle of the park.</p>
