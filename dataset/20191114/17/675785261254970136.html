      <h1>Barcelona star responds to claims about Lionel Messi and Antoine Griezmann relationship</h1>
      <h2>Griezmann is yet to set pulses raising at the Nou Camp following his big-money move in the summer, prompting suggestions of a rift with captain Messi</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T17:54:52+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 17:54</time> by <a rel="author">Darren Wells, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/darren-wells/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fc-barcelona">Barcelona</a> defender Clement Lenglet has suggested the relationship between Lionel Messi and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/antoine-griezmann">Antoine Griezmann</a> is a work in progress.</p>
      <p>Frenchman Griezmann was Barca's marquee signing in the summer from La Liga rivals Atletico Madrid for an initial Â£107 million.</p>
      <p>But he's yet to make a real impression at the Nou Camp, netting just four times since his arrival.</p>
      <p>Much has been made of how he would adapt from being the superstar talisman at Atletico to being under <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/lionel-messi">Messi's</a> watch, and Lenglet has shed some light on the situation.</p>
      <p>"The same thing that happened to me is happening to Antoine," Lenglet told a press conference. "Dialogue comes little by little.</p>

      <p>"Messi has a strong nucleus around him, he gets on very well with Luis Suarez, but he is very open and contact will come with time."</p>
      <p>However Lenglet was keen to dampen any suggestions of cagey behaviour between Messi and Griezmann.</p>
      <p>He added: "You can talk about a lot of things with Messi, not just football, he helps us every day."</p>

      <p>While Griezmann has struggled to make his mark, Messi has been in rampant form, scoring nine goals in his last seven appearances.</p>
      <p>But Lenglet feels his teammate will only get better once he becomes more settled in his new surroundings.</p>
      <p>"It is not easy to earn your place in a club like Barca because there are a lot of players that have as much experience as you," he said.</p>
      <p>"Barca has a very particular style of play which Antoine is not accustomed to. He needs time to adapt to feel his best on the pitch."</p>

      <p>Asked whether Griezmann plays better for his country than his club, Lenglet replied: "Different' is a big word, but when he's with the national team, he's having a lot of fun.</p>
      <p>"He's been there for a long time, he played a few big tournaments with the team, and he won a really beautiful one. Of course, he knows this place very well, he's very happy to be here, he has a strong history with the team.</p>
      <p>"But he's also very happy to be at Barcelona, even if you're saying otherwise. He's smiling every day and likes to be happy on and off the pitch."</p>
