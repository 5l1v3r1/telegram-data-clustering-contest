      <h2>A 10-storey building is on the way</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T17:49:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 17:49</time> by <a rel="author">Jamie Barlow</a></address>
      <p>Work has started on a major £45 million student flats development behind the intu Victoria Centre.</p>
      <p>A vast 10-storey building called York Place is planned at the site of a former office block <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/business/intu-agrees-sale-york-house-2277604">which was demolished a number of years ago and known as York House</a>.</p>
      <p>The original development plan was to <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/400-bed-student-accommodation-next-2551354">create 422-bed student bedrooms</a>. However, developers went back to the drawing board and have since put forward proposals to revise the scheme to create an extra 50 beds.</p>
      <p>The latest proposals were given the green light in August.</p>
      <p>Alex Newbold, land manager at the Cassidy Group, said: "Cassidy Group are pleased to be bringing the York Place development as one of a number of upcoming developments that we are bringing forward to Nottingham, building on the success of our previous developments within the city.</p>
      <p>"We are very excited to be developing <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/">York Place</a> for our clients Student Roost, part of the Brookfield Group.</p>
      <p>"York Place will be the fourth site within the city for Student Roost which will add to their existing student portfolio maintaining their position as one of the market leaders in high-quality student accommodation."</p>
      <p>Work started on the project at the end of October.</p>
      <p>Cassidy Group confirmed the scheme was designed in such a way to protect historic caves under the site.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.business-live.co.uk/all-about/east-midlands">company</a> also confirmed that nmcn, formerly North Midland Construction, had been appointed as the main contractor.</p>

      <p>The development is expected to be ready by August 2021.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.business-live.co.uk/all-about/east-midlands">Business leaders</a> have said the project could be beneficial to local shops.</p>
      <p>“The student economy is worth about £63m a year to Nottingham.</p>
      <p>"The quality of the universities in the <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/kfc-nottingham-plans-restaurant-city-3536995">city</a> attracts students from all over the world," said Scott Knowles, chief executive at the East Midlands Chamber, speaking previously.</p>
      <p>“Providing good quality accommodation within walking distance of academic centres and in central locations where it encourages use of local shops and other amenities and boosts both the day and night-time economies has to be good for the city.”</p>
      <p>Cassidy Group has also acquired a derelict factory site in London Road, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/17m-apartment-bid-site-near-3491829">where a £17.4m project is expected to deliver 150 apartments</a>.</p>
      <p>Plans have also recently been revealed for several large developments across the city.</p>
      <p>A £100m development featuring a <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/major-100m-landmark-development-including-3510444">170-bed hotel, hundreds of new homes and student housing</a> are in the pipeline for the junction of London Road and Queen's Road, near Nottingham Railway Station.</p>
      <p>While a vast £30m 15-storey 'landmark' apartment block is earmarked to transform a <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/landmark-30m-15-storey-apartment-3491624">car park at the junction of Traffic Street and Wiford Road</a>.</p>
