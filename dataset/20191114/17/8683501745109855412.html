      <p>The James Bond franchise has enthralled moviegoers for decades, and is showing no signs of slowing down. While Eon productions will continue 007's adventures on the big screen, Cary Joji Fukunaga's <i>No Time to Die</i> will mark Daniel Craig's final appearance as the MI6 agent. The pressure is on for the <i>Beasts of No Nation</i> director to deliver an appropriate swan song, and the latest report indicates that Bon may be married in the highly anticipated (<a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484093/no-time-to-die-is-the-most-expensive-bond-movie-ever">and expensive</a>) blockbuster.</p>
      <p>While <i>No Time to Die</i> has wrapped filming, much of the film's contents and plot remain a mystery, as the generations of fans patiently wait for the first trailer. But there have been some reports out of the movie's set, and the latest indicates that Daniel Craig's James Bond may be off the market in his final appearance. Namely, that he'll be marrying <i>Spectre</i> character Dr. Madeline Swann.</p>
      <p>This latest update comes to us from <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-7668333/Bond-gets-electric-car-wife-refuses-second-Time-Die-film.html">Daily Mail</a>, and is sure to be exciting for all the Bond fanatics who are hoping for a glimmer of new information. The story was about how <i>No Time to Die</i> will apparently <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484180/no-time-to-die-star-says-the-women-wear-the-pants-in-new-bond-movie">be more "woke"</a> than its predecessors, in the wake of the #MeToo movement. Emmy winner Phoebe Waller-Bridge was <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483752/no-time-to-dies-daniel-craig-drops-f-bomb-defending-phoebe-waller-bridge">brought on as a writer</a> to help bring a female perspective to the blockbuster, and it looks like one of the changes to Daniel Craig's Bond <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483288/rami-maleks-no-time-to-die-bond-villain-safin-is-a-nasty-piece-of-work">in the new movie</a> is get him off the market.</p>

      <p>James will apparently marry Léa Seydoux's Dr. Madeline Swann during the course of <i>No Time to Die</i>. Madeline was the main Bond girl in <i>Spectre</i>, aiding James on his mission against Blofled. The two ultimately left for places unknown together, and it looks like their romantic connection continued to grow off camera. Rather than writing Madeline off like the franchise has done in the past, her story with James will continue in <i>No Time to Die</i>. And apparently even take her down the isle.</p>
      <p>In addition to being more realistic and less gadget-focused, Daniel Craig's tenure as James Bond saw the franchise <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2481692/yes-no-time-to-die-will-wrap-up-the-last-two-bond-movies">embrace serialized storytelling</a>. The movies aren't anthologies, but one linear story. Characters pop back up, and 007's experiences are influenced by his past adventures. That'll also be the case with <i>No Time to Die</i>, and I'm eager to see <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2482825/rumor-no-time-to-die-is-shooting-three-endings-to-keep-bonds-secrets">what type of ending</a> this incarnation of Bond gets.</p>
      <p>James Bond isn't typically a character who married his Bond Girls, but it has happened onscreen before-- decades ago. James married Diana Riggs' Tracy Draco in 1969's <i>On Her Majesty's Secret Service.</i> Unfortunately, the <i>Game of Thrones</i> actress' character was killed on their wedding day in the final scene of the movie. Since then, we haven't seen James marry anyone on the big screen.</p>
      <p>Our questions will be answered when <i>No Time to Die</i> hits theaters on April 8, 2020.
