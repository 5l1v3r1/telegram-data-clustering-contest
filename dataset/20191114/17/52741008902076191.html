      <p>Freshii Inc. continued to see traffic to its health-food eateries fall during its most recent quarter, but believes upcoming initiatives including a loyalty program can win over consumers.</p>
      <p>Same-store sales, a key retail metric, fell 3.7 per cent for the quarter ended Sept. 29.</p>
      <p>"Turning around our same-store sales will not happen overnight, but we are optimistic about the opportunity to grow the Freshii brand long term," said Daniel Haroun, the chief financial officer, during a conference call with analysts Thursday.</p>
      <p>CEO Matthew Corrin said the company's current program, which focuses on offering limited-time menu items, isn't driving new traffic.</p>
      <p>Freshii's digital marketing campaigns and other initiatives expected to roll out next year will look to lure new customers into its stores, he said.</p>
      <p>The eatery chain is working on improving its customer feedback and measurement program, said Corrin, to help determine what diners value and where the company can improve.</p>
      <p>The company is also developing a new mobile app that Freshii expects to roll out in the middle of next year.</p>
      <p>"The mobile, I think most importantly, is going to come with loyalty," said Corrin, which the company thinks will be "a very significant contributor" to same-store sales growth.</p>
      <p>Elizabeth Johnston, a consumer products analyst at Laurentian Bank Securities, had expected same-store sales to fall two per cent.</p>
      <p>"System sales exceeded our forecast, with a higher number of net new store openings offsetting the lower SSSG," Johnston wrote in a report.</p>
      <p>Freshii, which keeps its books in U.S. dollars, reported a loss of US$415,000 or a penny per share in the quarter compared with a loss of $446,000 or a penny per share a year ago.</p>
      <p>Revenue totalled nearly $5.9 million, up from $5.6 million in the same quarter a year ago.</p>
      <p>System-wide sales grew 7.4 per cent to $49.2 million in the quarter compared with $45.8 million a year ago. The revenue growth was driven by 10 net new stores being added in the quarter. Freshii opened 16 locations and closed six.</p>
