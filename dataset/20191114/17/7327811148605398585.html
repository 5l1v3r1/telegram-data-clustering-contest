      <p>BOROUGH PARK, Brooklyn (WABC) -- Police arrested one person accused of throwing eggs at Orthodox Jewish people in Brooklyn.</p>
      <p>Mohib Hoque, 18, is facing various hate crime charges.</p>
      <p>In three separate incidents over the weekend, <a href="https://abc7ny.com/police-egg-throwing-incidents-in-nyc-may-be-hate-crimes/5690276/">eggs were thrown at people</a> and at a synagogue in Borough Park.</p>
      <p>Two of the attacks were caught on camera.</p>
      <p>In one incident, someone threw eggs at a mother and her four children while they were walking to the synagogue.</p>
      <p>Not all of the children were struck, but the mother, who didn't want to be identified, said it doesn't mean it's less traumatic for her children.</p>
      <p>"They had eggs thrown at them," said the mother, whose children were crying after the incident. "We're being laughed at, they felt. And then they just ran home."</p>
      <p>Police are continuing to look for others involved.</p>
      <p>The investigations are ongoing, and anyone with information in regard to this incident is asked to call the NYPD's Crime Stoppers Hotline at 1-800-577-TIPS (8477) or for Spanish, 1-888-57-PISTA (74782).
