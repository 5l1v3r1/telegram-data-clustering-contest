      <p>SANIBEL, Fla. â€” A federal grant will give Southwest Florida Refuge resources to enhance the wetland habitat for roosting and nesting birds.</p>
      <p>The National Fish and Wildlife Foundation announced its award of 5.3 million dollars to the Ding Darling National Wildlife Refuge on Sanibel Island.</p>
      <p>The money will be used to restore the newly acquired, <a href="https://www.dingdarlingsociety.org/articles/wulfert-bayous-preservation?fbclid=IwAR0zZFO6JMMVMr-B7Z7ieZilroM2dhLBm-apyNwax6RyFPMv4FUM94xv24k">68-acre "Wulfert Bayous," adjacent to the refuge.</a></p>
      <p>The hope is to replace bird populations affected by the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010.</p>
      <p>The refuge will improve 16 acres of functional mangrove habitat to attract species impacted by the oil spill, including roseate spoonbills, white ibises, brown pelicans, wood storks, and several egret and heron species.</p>
