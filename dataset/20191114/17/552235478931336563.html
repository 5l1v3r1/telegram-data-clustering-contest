      <h2>Blantyre man who was left in a vegetative state following a vicious assault has died.</h2>

      <p>A Blantyre man who was left in a vegetative state following a vicious assault has died.</p>
      <p>Family man David Black was 35 when he was attacked by Raymond Bell, then 29, and left for dead following a Rutherglen house party in November 2014.</p>
      <p>His injuries, including a bleed on the brain, were so severe they changed his life forever and rendered the dad-of-two bed bound and only able to communicate with his family by blinking.</p>
      <p>Sadly, the 40-year-old Celtic fan passed away at Kilbryde Hospice on October 27 from bronchial pneumonia.</p>
      <p>His heartbroken mum Kate Neil told the Advertiser this week: “David was an amazing son, brother and dad and he gave our life meaning and faith and showed us what love was. He will be extremely missed and loved forever and left a lasting impression on everyone he met.</p>
      <p>“He fought the hardest battle on earth and even until the end continued to show us just how strong, brave and beautiful his soul truly was.</p>
      <p>“I laid a crucifix on his chest and he passed away peacefully. David was not afraid to die and I was not afraid to let him go.”</p>

      <p>David’s mum featured in the Advertiser in 2017 after being forced to turn her living room into a makeshift hospital ward in a bid to provide her son with at-home rehabilitation and care while awaiting the offer of an appropriate adapted property.</p>
      <p>Both his mum and partner Helen Gillies felt they faced a constant fight to get David the level of rehabilitation, and essential safety physio equipment, needed for the former landscape gardener to “have some quality of life.”</p>
      <p>Following a charity event at Blantyre Miners’ Welfare that same year the family were able to buy the physio equipment required and David was later offered an adapted house in Blantyre.</p>

      <p>Kate added: “What a massive difference the adapted house made to David, the family and indeed his carers in these last months.</p>
      <p>“However, his health took a turn for the worse and he was admitted to Hairmyres Hospital in September where he was very uncomfortable, before being moved to the wonderful Kilbryde Hospice where David, being his usual self, bounced back, looking so handsome and healthy in lovely tranquil surroundings.</p>
      <p>“A huge thank you to the staff at the hospice. From the minute he was admitted there he had a cheeky grin and his blue lips turned pink again. He was at peace and so were we.”</p>

      <p>David was found barely alive in a coma five days after the attack took place in November 2014. The following year, Raymond Bell was jailed for nine years for the assault.</p>
      <p>The court heard that Bell inflicted horrific injuries on David, repeatedly kicking and stamping on his head.</p>
      <p>Bell denied the attack but was convicted of attempted murder.</p>
      <p>A date for David’s funeral is yet to be confirmed.</p>
