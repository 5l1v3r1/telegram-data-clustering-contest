      <p>Laurent Simons is pursuing a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering at the Eindhoven University of Technology (TUE) in the Netherlands. He's 9 years old. After graduation, he intends to earn a PhD in electrical engineering along with a medical degree. His longterm goal is to develop artificial organs for transplant. From <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/14/europe/university-graduate-child-genius-scli-intl/index.html">CNN</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>While Laurent comes from a family of doctors, his parents have so far not received any explanation as to why their child prodigy is capable of learning so quickly.<br/><br/>But (mother) Lydia has her own theory.<br/><br/>"I ate a lot of fish during the pregnancy," she joked.<br/><br/>The TUE has allowed Laurent to complete his course faster than other students.<br/><br/>"That is not unusual," said Sjoerd Hulshof, education director of the TUE bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering, in a statement.<br/><br/>"Special students that have good reasons for doing so can arrange an adjusted schedule. In much the same way we help students who participate in top sport."</blockquote>
