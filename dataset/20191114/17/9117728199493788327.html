        <b>In 2016, <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/max-verstappen">Max Verstappen</a> demonstrated his skill in the wet weather as he ended up on the podium. The <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/aston-martin-red-bull-racing">Aston Martin Red Bull Racing</a> driver doesn't want similar conditions this weekend in Interlagos. </b>
      </p>
      <p>In Austin, Verstappen was catching up with <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/lewis-hamilton">Lewis Hamilton</a> and would have had an opportunity to overtake had their not been a yellow flag on the final lap of the race. The Dutchman believes his RB15 has the ability to win in Brazil, as long as the conditions stay dry.</p>

      <p><i>"I hope so because normally that means we can win the race,"</i> says the Red Bull driver when <a href="https://www.gptoday.net/nl/nieuws/f1/252269/max-verstappen-hebben-geen-regen-nodig-om-in-brazilie-competitief-te-zijn">GPToday.net</a> asks him if he expects a copy of last year's weekend.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“Looking at the last races, there is certainly a chance that we will be competitive here. I have no problems if it stays dry. Last year we also had a good race here, so I don't care."</i>
