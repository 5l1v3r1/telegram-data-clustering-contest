      <h1>Brother of OneCoin’s ‘Cryptoqueen’ pleads guilty, could serve 90 years in prison</h1>
      <h2>Konstantin Ignatov now fears violence against him and his family</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T17:42:22+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 17:42</time> by <a rel="author">David Canellis</a></address>
      <p>The brother of OneCoin’s missing “CryptoQueen” has pleaded guilty to money laundering and fraud charges, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-50417908">BBC reports</a>.</p>
      <p>Konstantin Ignatov admitted to his role in the multi-billion dollar OneCoin scam when he signed a plea deal on October 4. That document has since been obtained by <a href="https://twitter.com/innercitypress">Inner City Press</a>.</p>
      <p>Ignatov is yet to be sentenced, but now faces up to 90 years in prison.</p>
      <p>OneCoin’s alleged ringleader Dr. Ruja Ignatova is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/nov/04/the-missing-cryptoqueen-the-hunt-for-a-multi-billion-dollar-scam-artist">still on the run</a>, while Ignatov is reportedly worried that his recent plea deal may “reveal activities of individuals” who might use violence against him and his family.</p>
      <p>As such, BBC reports that he might be assigned a new identity under the US’ witness protection program.</p>
      <h3>OneCoin scam could be even bigger than BitConnect</h3>
      <p>Authorities say OneCoin operates as a classic pyramid scheme, built on a multi-level marketing network somewhat akin to the infamous BitConnect fraud.</p>
      <p>The firm dupes buyers into purchasing supposedly lucrative investment packages made entirely of a fake cryptocurrency, OneCoin.</p>
      <p>In March, Hard Fork reported that the US had <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/manhattan-us-attorney-announces-charges-against-leaders-onecoin-multibillion-dollar">laid charges</a> against Ignatov, Ignatova, as well a third accomplice, US lawyer Mark Scott, who’s accused of laundering $400 million for the scam. He’s pleaded not guilty.</p>
      <p>According to Ignatov’s testimony featured in Scott’s ongoing trial, Ignatova says critics of OneCoin are “haters,” and that she worried somebody was going to snitch on her to the FBI.</p>
      <p>Ignatov reportedly claims to have not spoken to his sister since her disappearance, despite supposedly hiring a private investigator to find her. She’d previously told him that she’d acquired a “big passport,” and requested plane tickets to Austria and Greece.</p>
      <p>The firm that oversees OneCoin’s operation, which is headquartered in Bulgaria, still appears to be running, although its press department has not released any information since June.</p>
