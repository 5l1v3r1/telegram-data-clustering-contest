      <p>Huawei To Launch 5G Smartphones In Japan In 2020<br/>3.7 (73.33%) 3 votes</p>
      <p>Today, Huawei and Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics issued <a href="https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2019/11/e785983aa024-huawei-to-introduce-5g-smartphone-handsets-in-japan-next-year.html">an important statement</a>. They said the company will introduce several new smartphones supporting 5G next summer.</p>
      <p>Particularly, a senior official at the company’s Japanese unit, Wu Bo said in an interview that Huawei will “put a priority on using Google’s services” among apps for the new models. But as we know Huawei has been included in the US blacklist and the American companies can’t offer their products to this manufacturer. As a result, the latest flagship smartphone of the company has no Google service and runs on only the open-source system.</p>

      <p>US President Donald Trump views this company as a national security threat. And this is related not only to the smartphones but the 5G equipment as well. But the way, Huawei is an absolute leader of 5G terminals and has managed to sign a number of international contracts. The US thinks its equipment could be used for cyberespionage. Huawei denies the allegations.</p>

      <p>‘Even if the U.S. government limits the use (of Google services), we have the capability to build our own services,’ Bo said. He also added that Huawei will be looking for other cooperation opportunities. And Huawei’s cooperation with Japanese engineers is one of them.</p>
      <p>As said, Japan is going to launch a nationwide 5G network next spring. This technology ensures a 100-times faster data transmission speeds than 4G. It is expected to be widely used in areas such as autonomous driving, gaming and remote medical surgery.</p>
      <p>As for the Japanese market, Huawei is the fifth largest smartphone provider in the country. It lays behind Apple, Sharp, Sony, and Samsung. At the moment, its smartphone shipments account for 6.2% of the total in the last fiscal year ended March.</p>
