      <p>The DC character <b><i>Black Adam</i></b> is getting his own movie in a couple years, and star <b>Dwayne Johnson</b> has taken to social media today to share the first poster and release date.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B42odCrFF42/">Johnson wrote over on Instagram</a>:</p>
      <p>
        <i>“I’m honored to join the iconic #DCUniverse and it’s a true pleasure to become, Black Adam. Black Adam is blessed by magic with the powers equal to Superman, but the difference is he doesn’t toe the mark or walk the line. He’s a rebellious, one of a kind superhero, who’ll always do what’s right for the people – but he does it his way. Truth and justice – the Black Adam way.”</i>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>“This role is unlike any other I’ve ever played in my career and I’m grateful to the bone we’ll all go on this journey together.”</i>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Created by Otto Binder and C.C. Beck, Black Adam first came onto the scene in December 1945. Johnson was originally going to appear as Black Adam in the <i>Shazam! </i>feature film.</p>
      <p>Black Adam has long been Shazam’s nemesis, though Johnson’s comments make it sound like he’s going to be something of an anti-hero in the character’s solo movie? Interesting…</p>
      <p><i>Black Adam</i>, being directed by <b>Jaume Collet-Serra</b> (<i>Orphan, The Shallows</i>), will arrive in theaters on<b> December 22, 2021</b>. You can check out your first look at the film below.</p>
