      <p>The European Commission has launched “infringement proceedings” against Britain after Boris Johnson refused to nominate a new British EU commissioner.</p>
      <p>In a statement, the commission said that it considered that the UK was “in breach of its EU treaty obligations”.</p>
      <p>It said that the Government had until November 22 to respond to the notice.</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson has repeatedly said he would not appoint a new commissioner – even though all member states are legally obliged to do so.</p>

      <p>But in a letter to the commission on Wednesday, the Government said official pre-election guidance meant it could not make international appointments ahead of polling day on December 12.</p>
      <p>In its response, the commission said that under EU case-law, a member state “may not invoke provisions prevailing in its domestic legal system to justify failure to observe obligations arising under union law”.</p>
      <p>The launch of infringement proceedings could be the first step on referring the case to the European Court of Justice.</p>
      <p>However, Mr Johnson may well calculate that by the time it reaches that stage, Britain will be out of the EU – at least if he is able to deliver Brexit by the latest deadline of January 31.</p>
      <p>The greater danger for the Government may be that it will sour forthcoming negotiations with Brussels if the refusal to appoint a UK commissioner delays the formation of the new commission.</p>
