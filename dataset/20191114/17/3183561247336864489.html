      <p>The "cheap" 16-inch MacBook <a href="https://www.apple.com/au/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/16-inch">starts at <b>$3,799</b></a> and comes with a 2.6GHz six-core Core i7 Processor, 16GB of RAM, 4GB AMD Radeon Pro 5300M GPU, and a 512GB SSD drive.</p>
      <p>It also comes with a new 100-Wh battery which will apparently gift you will 11 hours, as well as 3 USB-C ports. What you won't find is a built-in SD card slot. Sorry.</p>
      <p>If you're looking for more power and storage, you can opt for the <b>$4,399</b> unit, which comes with a 2.3GHz eight-core Core i9 processor, 4GB Radeon Pro 5500M GPU and a 1TB SSD.</p>
      <p>Both laptops can further boosted with a 2.4GHz eight-core Core i9 processor, Radeon Pro 5500M 8GB GPU, up to 64GB of RAM and a whopping 8TB SSD.</p>
      <p>If you really want to go out with the specs it will set you back a casual <b>$9,679</b>.</p>

      <p>Besides the giant display, the most significant new design feature is the 'Magic Keyboard', which we're hoping will work better than bothersome butterfly keyboard which, well, sucked.</p>
      <p>The new keyboard now has a scissor mechanism, minimal wobble and only one millimetre of travel. Fans of the Touch Bar will also be rejoicing at its continued presence.</p>
      <p>Let's see if Apple lives up to its promise of this new keyboard causing less headaches.</p>
      <p>The new 16-inch MacBook Pro <a href="https://www.apple.com/au/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/16-inch">is available in Australia now</a>.</p>
