      <p>Alcohol, tobacco and cigarettes were stolen in an early morning ramraid at a <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/cardiff">Cardiff</a> supermarket this morning.</p>
      <p>Extensive damage was caused to the Co-op store in Llanrumney after thieves used a vehicle to force entry into the shop.</p>
      <p>Police said a vehicle was used to ram the shutters open of the shop on Countisbury Avenue, at around 2.25am.</p>
      <p>Pictures from the scene show the external shutter was left in a crumpled mess, with the main doors also appearing to have been forced open.</p>
      <p>There were also smashed bottles at the scene of the break-in.</p>
      <p>The supermarket has been closed today as a result of the damage.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for the Co-op said: "An incident occured at our Llanrumney store at around 2.30am in the early hours of this morning.</p>
      <p>"Extensive damaged has been caused and we are appealing to anyone who may have seen or heard anything to come forward to police who are investigating.</p>
      <p>"This week is respect for shopworkers week and as a community based organisation we see the impact of social issues in our stores - this incident further highlights the need for greater resources to tackle the root causes of crime.</p>
      <p>"Our store is expected to reopen tomorrow morning, Friday November 15, to serve the community."</p>
      <p>South Wales Police has launched an appeal for information.</p>
