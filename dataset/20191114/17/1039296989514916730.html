      <p>The model will be come to our market by late-2020; rivals include the Mahindra Alturas G4, Toyota Fortuner and Ford Endeavour.</p>
      <p>MG Motor India has begun testing one of its future products, the Maxus D90-based SUV, which is expected to see a market launch sometime by end-2020; Maxus is a brand owned by MG Motor India’s parent company, SAIC. We broke the news earlier this year that <a href="https://www.autocarindia.com/car-news/mg-maxus-d90-suv-india-bound-by-diwali-2020-412933"><b>MG is would bring the Maxus D90 SUV to our market by late-2020</b></a>.</p>
      <p>The Maxus D90 is a large SUV and has three rows of seating. In terms of dimensions, the SUV measures 5,005mm in length, 1,932mm in width, 1,875mm in height, and has a 2,950mm-long wheelbase. Based on its size, the Maxus D90 will sit above the Hector seven-seat SUV in MG’s India range. According to sources, the D90 has also already been spotted being benchmarked against the recently launched <a href="http://www.autocarindia.com/cars/mahindra/alturas-g4"><b>Mahindra Alturas G4</b></a>. Other rivals in the Indian market which will include the <a href="https://www.autocarindia.com/cars/toyota/fortuner"><b>Toyota Fortuner</b></a> and <a href="http://www.autocarindia.com/cars/ford/endeavour"><b>Ford Endeavour</b></a>.</p>
      <p>Internationally, the Maxus D90 comes equipped with a 2.0-litre petrol engine that makes 224hp and 360Nm torque (the India-spec Maxus D90 is also expected to get this engine). However, MG is also expected to offer the D90 in India with a 2.0-litre diesel engine, the same unit present in the Hector. Abroad, the Maxus D90 is offered with both, a 6-speed manual and a 6-speed torque convertor automatic gearbox. The India-spec model is also expected to get a four-wheel drive option with a low-range transfer case and seven driving modes (which includes Automatic, Economy, Motion, Snow, Sandy, Mud and Rock). India will most-likely be the first market for this new SUV to be sold with a diesel engine option.</p>
      <p>Coming to the interiors, the D90’s cabin is a features rich area with equipment like a 12.3-inch touchscreen infotainment system, an 8.0-inch digital instrument cluster, three-zone climate control, cooled/heated seats, a panoramic sunroof, a 360-degree camera and more on offer.</p>
      <p>When launched in India, MG is expected to price the SUV around the Rs 30 lakh (ex-showroom) mark.</p>
