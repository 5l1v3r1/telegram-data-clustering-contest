      <p>The legendary director will return to Brooklyn to shoot a hip-hop version of William Shakespeare's classic.</p>
      <p><b>(AllHipHop News) </b>Spike Lee is to direct a version of William Shakespeare's "Romeo And Juliet" set in the 1980s New York hip-hop scene.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/spike-lee-direct-romeo-juliet-tale-prince-cats-1254584">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, the "BlacKkKlansman" filmmaker has closed a deal to direct "Prince of Cats," an adaptation of Ron Wimberly's graphic novel.</p>
      <p>The 2012 book tells Romeo and Juliet's story through the eyes of her hot-headed cousin Tybalt and transports the story to a fictionalized version of 1980s Brooklyn.</p>
      <p>The project has been in development since 2018, when it was to star Lakeith Stanfield, but the "Knives Out" actor has since dropped out of the movie.</p>
      <p>Spike Lee will rewrite the script with Wimberly and former The Source editor Selwyn Seyfu Hinds, who wrote the original adapted screenplay. Casting details are yet to be announced.</p>
      <p>In "Prince of Cats," Tybalt and his Capulet brothers, battle with their rival Montagues for control of Da People's Republic of Brooklyn, where underground sword duelling has become a method of settling disputes, among youngsters obsessed with hip-hop, DJing and graffiti.</p>

        <a href="https://allhiphop.com/news/spike-lee-s-blackkkklansman-features-an-unreleased-prince-song-rW9fZsLFyEC1-qZVqOucvA/">Spike Lee's last film, "BlacKkKlansman" was nominated for six Academy Awards, and won for Best Adapted Screenplay, the 62-year-old's first non-honorary Oscar.</a>
      </p>
      <p>His follow-up project is "Da 5 Bloods," a Vietnam War thriller starring Chadwick Boseman.</p>
