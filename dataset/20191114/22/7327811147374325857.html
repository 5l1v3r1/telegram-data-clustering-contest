      <p>EAST BRUNSWICK, New Jersey (WABC) -- Five employees of an adult day care in New Jersey are accused of abusing two disabled adults in their care.</p>
      <p>The employees of Broadway Respite and Home Care were charged Tuesday on multiple charges.</p>
      <p>During an investigation, officials say two severely disabled individuals were physically abused in May of 2019.</p>
      <p>Court documents allege that the facility failed to protect the physical or mental health of the victims.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors say Asia Lunn, 22, Kenitra Hicks, 34, Kieasha Morgan, 24, Hugo Lorenzo, 25, and Janella Allen, 31, were indicted for two counts of abandonment and neglect of a disabled person and two counts of endangering another person, for two separate victims, both third degree crimes.</p>
      <p>Lunn was also indicted for one count of aggravated assault in the third degree.</p>
      <p>Todd Harrison of McDermott Will &amp; Emery LLP made a statement on behalf of Broadway Respite &amp; Home Care:</p>
      <p>
        <i>"In May, two incidents occurred on the same day at Broadway Respite and Home Care involving two adults attending the facility. Immediately upon learning about the incidents, the company took action - they reported to the police, they notified the relevant state agencies in New Jersey, they immediately put the relevant individuals on leave and commenced an internal investigation to determine the extent of the wrongdoing, which resulted in the termination of all the employees named in the indictment. The company also complied with all appropriate regulations in the hiring of these employees, including background checks. The company was surprised and disappointed that these charges have been filed against it. This a good company with an exceptional, long-standing track record, which provides an incredibly valuable service to its community. It will continue to care for its patients with the utmost care."</i>
      </p>
      <p>The investigation is active and is continuing. Anyone with information is asked to call Detective Farrace at (732) 390-6900, or Detective Ankudowicz at (732) 745-5547.</p>
