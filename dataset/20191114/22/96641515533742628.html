      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T22:36:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 22:36</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.facebook.com/mariellamoon" target="_blank">Mariella Moon</a></address>
      <p>You no longer have to fire up Target's desktop website to access its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/12/18/target-shipt-same-day-delivery-for-all-major-categories/">Shipt</a> same-day delivery service if you need to get your purchase as soon as possible. The retail giant is <a href="https://corporate.target.com//article/2019/11/shipt-on-target-app">bringing</a> the service to its iOS and Android mobile apps, just in time for some on-the-go (and possibly last-minute) Thanksgiving shopping.</p>
      <p>While the service doesn't require a membership to use, it costs $10 per delivery unless you pay $99 per year for unlimited deliveries on orders worth $35 or more. Target's taking an extra step to win customers over, though, and is offering free same-day shipping for a limited time. From November 17th to the 26th, the company will ship orders that reach $75 or more placed via its website or its app at no cost. Of course, those who've never tried Shipt before can still sign up for a four-week trial to get free shipping.</p>
      <p>Target <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/06/13/target-shipt-same-day-delivery/">expanded</a> its same-day delivery service throughout the US and launched a dedicated Shipt shopping experience on its website in mid-2019. In the past, you'd have to go to Shipt's website or use its separate mobile app to be able to enjoy its perks. With same-day delivery's arrival on mobile, Target's more equipped to go head to head with Amazon this holiday shopping season.</p>
