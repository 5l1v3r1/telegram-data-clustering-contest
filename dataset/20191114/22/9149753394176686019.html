      <h1>Halo Reach, Flight Simulator, and Yakuza games are coming to Xbox Game Pass PC</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T22:02:17+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 22:02</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/author/tyler-wilde/" target="_blank">Tyler Wilde</a></address>
      <p>There's a certain screenshot I wanted to use for this article, but sadly can't: The Witcher 3 is coming to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/xbox-game-pass-pc-game-list/">Xbox Game Pass</a>, but not the PC version of the subscription. Oh well, Halo Reach will suffice. It and a ton of other games will be available with a Game Pass PC subscription this year and next.</p>
      <p>The new games available now are: Age of Empires 2, Hearts of Iron 4, The Talos Principle, and Tracks: The Train Set Game. Hadn't heard of that last one, but checking it out <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/657240/Tracks__The_Family_Friendly_Open_World_Train_Set_Game/">on Steam</a> brought me right back to childhood railroad engineering.</p>
      <p>Before the end of 2019, Halo Reach, Darksiders 3, The Red Strings Club, The Escapists 2, Vambrace: Cold Soul, and My Friend Pedro will be made available for Games Pass PC owners.</p>
      <p>Let's switch to bullet points for the 2020 Xbox Game Pass PC announcements, because a lot of games are coming to the service:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ori and the Will of the Wisps</li>
        <li>Minecraft Dungeons</li>
        <li>Forager</li>
        <li>Grounded</li>
        <li>Bleeding Edge</li>
        <li>Wasteland 3</li>
        <li>Flight Simulator</li>
        <li>Yakuza 0</li>
        <li>Yakuza Kiwami</li>
        <li>Yakuza Kiwami 2</li>
        <li>Carrion</li>
        <li>Cyber Shadow</li>
        <li>Double Kick Heroes</li>
        <li>Haven</li>
        <li>Levelhead</li>
        <li>Phogs</li>
        <li>Skate Bird</li>
        <li>Streets of Rage 4</li>
        <li>Touhou Luna Nights</li>
        <li>She Dreams Elsewhere</li>
        <li>Final Fantasy VII</li>
        <li>Final Fantasy VIII: Remastered</li>
        <li>Final Fantasy IX</li>
        <li>Final Fantasy X: HD Remastered</li>
        <li>Final Fantasy X-2: HD Remastered</li>
        <li>Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age</li>
        <li>Final Fantasy XIII o Final Fantasy XIII-2</li>
        <li>Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII</li>
        <li>Final Fantasy XV</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Yakuza games and Final Fantasys are a nice surprise. Wasteland 3, Ori and the Will of the Wisps, Flight Simulator, and Minecraft Dungeons also add a lot of value to game pass, which we will continue to recommend at its $5 introductory price.</p>
      <p>Also coming in 2020 is the ability to play Game Pass games via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/xcloud-game-streaming-is-coming-to-xbox-game-pass-and-windows-next-year/">Microsoft's xCloud streaming service</a>, which is currently in testing. Or you can just install them, like the sensible PC gamer you are, but it'll be an option.</p>
