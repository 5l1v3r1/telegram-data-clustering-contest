      <h1>Stocks Climb After Kudlow Talks Up Trade Progress: Markets Wrap</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T22:13:17+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 22:13</time> by <a rel="author">Samuel Potter</a></address>
      <p>(Bloomberg) -- European and Asian stocks climbed alongside U.S. equity futures on Friday after a senior American official <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-15/kudlow-says-phase-one-china-deal-down-to-the-short-strokes-k2zgbx0k">signaled progress</a> on a trade deal between the world’s two largest economies. Treasuries slipped with the yen and gold retreated.</p>
      <p>The Stoxx Europe 600 Index rose led by mining stocks as almost every major national gauge in the region advanced. Contracts for all three main U.S. benchmarks were also in the green after White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said an agreement is “coming down to the short strokes.” Equities climbed in Seoul, Tokyo and Sydney but fell in Shanghai. China’s yuan strengthened against the dollar.</p>

      <p>Concerns about the chances of the U.S. and China completing a phase-one pact had propelled Treasuries earlier this week, and acted as a headwind to a stock rally that keeps taking American gauges to record highs. The S&amp;P 500 closed slightly higher on Thursday, though a mixed bag of global economic data has also given investors plenty to think about.</p>
      <p>Next up is Friday’s U.S. retail sales report, which will show whether consumption bounced back in October after a drop the previous month.</p>

      <p>Traders also have one eye on the unrest in Hong Kong, where concerns have fed through to money markets. Liquidity conditions in foreign-exchange are the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-14/hong-kong-money-markets-show-investor-calm-is-starting-to-crack">tightest since the late 1990s</a>.
