      <h1>Hawaii Man Proposes to His Girlfriend While Surfing, Promptly Drops the Ring in the Ocean. (She Still Said Yes)</h1>

      <p>(HONOLULU) — A Hawaii man was surfing with his girlfriend when — instead of hanging 10 — he knelt down on one knee on his board and proposed.</p>
      <p><i>Hawaii News Now</i> <a href="https://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/2019/11/12/he-proposed-while-surfing-then-lost-ring-luckily-he-was-prepared/">reported</a> that Lauren Oiye said yes just before Chris Garth dropped the ring in the ocean. Luckily, he had a spare.</p>
      <p>Multiple photographers nearby captured the Sunday moment.</p>
      <p>Garth said he knew it could go wrong, so he used a stand-in while they were out in the water. The real ring was on shore at Queen’s Beach in Waikiki, where the two met years before.</p>
      <p>Details about the rings were not released.</p>
