      <p>Kerry Katona displayed her incredibly slender figure after taking Skinnyjab injections.</p>
      <p>The singer, 39, has lost more than one stone in four weeks and she has credited her weight loss to the controversial hunger-curbing jabs on social media.</p>
      <p>With incredible confidence, the songstress posted her envy-inducing snap on her <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> account on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Kerry showcased her toned figure in a sky blue crop top and matching bottoms while she posed in her gym gear.</p>
      <p>The blonde bombshell had spent the whole day modelling up a storm for Skinnyjabs as she worked on collaborating with the weight loss product.</p>

      <p>Previously, Kerry has documented her fitness journey after she begun taking the weight loss jabs.</p>
      <p>She wrote on Instagram: "Soooooo I would like to reveal my amazing secret with you all, I have been doing SkinnyJab for 4 weeks now &amp; I have lost over a stone doing the weekly programme! I feel amazing, fit &amp; healthy.</p>
      <p>"The dietary programme &amp; aftercare is fantastic and super easy, I’m truly thrilled with Caroline &amp; her amazing team." (sic)</p>
      <p>The cost of SkinnyJab begins with an initial three-week plan costing £250 and top-up treatments are priced at £135 each.</p>
      <p>According to the SkinnyJab website, the injection works by "removing hunger from the equation" while regulating blood sugar levels and helping the body to turn fat into energy.</p>
      <p>Recently, Gemma Collins has also credited her weight loss to SkinnyJab injections.</p>
      <p>Kerry returned to the red carpet and to her modelling duties after she was rushed to hospital with a mystery illness.</p>
      <p>In the wake of her hospital visit, she has discussed her health and fears she has endometriosis.</p>
      <p>It is a condition where tissue similar to the lining of the womb starts to grow in other places such as the ovaries and fallopian tubes.</p>
      <p>In early November, she wrote: "You may have seen me out and about looking very uncomfortable - it's because I'm still in such awful pain with my back. I can barely stand up straight. I'm sick of crying about it, but it's really restricting me.</p>
      <p>"I'm going to a clinic later this month to see a gynae specialist, but early indications suggest it's endometriosis, which can take years to diagnose."</p>
