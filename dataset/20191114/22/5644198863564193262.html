      <p>MADRID: Triple MotoGP world champion Jorge Lorenzo announced on Thursday (Nov 14) he would retire after this weekend's season-ending race in Valencia.</p>
      <p>The 32-year-old Mallorcan's departure after an injury-blighted season leaves a coveted vacancy alongside compatriot Marc Marquez, the six times MotoGP world champion, at the Repsol Honda team.</p>

      <p>He said his difficulties this season led to his decision to retire.</p>
      <p>"I love this sport but above all I love winning," he said at a special news conference also attended by series CEO Carmelo Ezpeleta.</p>
      <p>"I have let myself down and I have let down Honda but I think this is the best decision for me and the team. We are both winners and we always have to fight to win."</p>
      <p>Lorenzo moved from Ducati at the end of 2018 but has struggled with fitness and the handling of the RC213V bike.</p>
      <p>He is 19th overall with a meagre 25 points from 18 races, and without a single top 10 finish, compared to Marquez's runaway tally of 395.</p>
      <p>Lorenzo said earlier this month that he needed a month or a month and a half without racing in order to recover fully for next season but has now decided to call it a day.</p>
      <p>"In this stage in my career it has been impossible to stay concentrated, I feel very bad for Honda," he added.</p>
      <p>"I'm fortune to have the career I've had. I've battled with a lot of riders who have not been able to fight to win a world championship like I have. I will always feel very fortunate for having that opportunity."</p>
      <p>The Spaniard, who also won two world titles in the 250cc category (now Moto2) in 2006 and 2007, was MotoGP champion in 2010, 2012 and 2015 with Yamaha.</p>
      <p>He missed four grands prix after crashing during practice at Assen in the Netherlands in June and suffering fractured vertebrae.</p>
      <p>He was also ruled out of the opening pre-season test in Malaysia last February after fracturing his left wrist while training in Italy and undergoing surgery.</p>
