      <p>“He is done with all the hard training. It is now time for light sessions to conserve energy,” stated Kiwanuka manager Emmanuel Mwesigwa. “He will do more swimming, sprints, shadow boxing and hitting pads.”</p>
      <p>Mwesigwa explained that Kiwanuka has gained the required stamina and power and it is now time to relax. IUEA will host the 12 round fight in its 1,600 seater auditorium. The auditorium is part of an over sh60m offer towards boxer Kiwanuka’s upcoming fight.</p>
