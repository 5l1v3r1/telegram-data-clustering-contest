      <p>Ricky Martin will be hosting the 2020 awards that will also honour Ellen DeGeneres with the Carol Burnett Award and Cecil B. DeMille Award honoree Tom Hanks.</p>
      <p>“For the first time in Golden Globe history, we’ve proudly selected two brothers to represent the Hollywood Foreign Press Association this awards season,” said President of the HFPA Lorenzo Soria. “Dylan and Paris Brosnan have already achieved tremendous success in the fashion world and are following in their father’s footsteps in entertainment. We’re excited to see how they’ll use this platform to contribute their talents to elevate the important issue of childhood hunger.”</p>

      <p>The boys have picked FEED, an organization that delivers nutritious meals to school children around the globe as their platform of choice.</p>
      <p>Dylan, 22, who is getting ready to graduate from the USC School of Cinematic Arts said they are looking forward to “honour our dad’s legacy.” Paris, 18, went on to talk about how their father has inspired them.</p>
      <p>“The biggest lesson our dad taught us is to ‘be kind,’ which was an essential factor in Paris and my decision to study filmmaking and our desire to tell important stories. Having this opportunity to turn the spotlight outward on kids experiencing hunger is a true privilege,” Paris said.</p>

      <p>While talking about FEED, he added, “I’ve never had to worry about where my next meal might come from – I’m lucky in that respect; but I know that millions of children worldwide don’t have that luxury. School meals provide critically important nutrition, and also incentivize parents to keep kids in school, giving them a fighting chance for a better life.”</p>
      <p>Pierce also has three other children. Sean, 36 from his marriage to Cassandra Harris and Harris’ two children from her previous marriage who Pierce had adopted: Christopher, 47, and Charlotte who died in 2013 from ovarian cancer, the same disease that claimed her mother’s life in 1991.</p>
