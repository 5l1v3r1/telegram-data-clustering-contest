      <h1>New trademark confirms Tesla’s cybertruck will in fact be called “CYBRTRK”</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T22:47:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 22:47</time> by <a rel="author">Surur</a></address>
      <p>Tesla is announcing their new truck on the 21st, and today <a href="https://electrek.co/2019/11/14/tesla-sends-out-invites-to-cybrtrk-event/">started sending out invitations</a> to the media to the event.</p>
      <p>The invite actually gives us another glimpse of the vehicle, if you squint enough.</p>

      <p>The wheels can be seen in the crop above, showing the relatively high ground clearance and light strip headlines. The truck will clearly have a tall front profile.</p>
      <p>Equally interesting is that Telsa has confirmed that the truck will be called “CYBRTRK”, following<a href="http://tess2.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=doc&amp;state=4806:dji1m3.2.2"> a trademark filed by Tesla</a> on the 6th November being discovered. CYBRTRK.com redirects to Tesla.com at present.</p>

      <p>The font used by the trademark confirms the car’s Bladerunner credentials.</p>
      <p>Musk has said the truck will look like an <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/elon-musk-says-their-long-awaited-electric-truck-will-look-like-an-armored-personnel-carrier-from-the-future/">“<i>armoured personnel carrier from the future”.</i></a></p>
      <p>He has also said it will feature a 400-500 mile range, dual-motor all-wheel-drive drive train and dynamic suspension, and “300,000 lbs of towing capacity,” and will cost less than $50,000 and “be better than a Ford F150.”</p>
      <p>Musk promised their truck would be “a better sports car than a standard Porsche 911”, as well as a “better truck than a Ford F-150 in terms of truck-like functionality.”</p>
      <p>The Tesla CYBRTRK will be unveiled in Los Angeles near the SpaceX rocket factory.</p>
