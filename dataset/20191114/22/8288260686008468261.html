      <p>Instagram is expanding its hidden "likes" trial globally, the social network has announced.</p>
      <p>The Facebook-owned app began hiding users' likes in countries including Ireland, Italy and Australia earlier this year.</p>
      <p>Feedback from early testing has been positive, Instagram said.</p>
      <p>"We're continuing our test to learn more from our global community," the company said.</p>

      <p>"In addition, we understand that like counts are important for many creators, and we are actively thinking through ways for creators to communicate value to their partners."</p>
      <p>The move was aimed at removing "pressure" and stopping the platform feeling "like a competition".</p>
      <p>Rather than showing the number of likes on a particular post, the platform instead displays that the post has been liked by one user name "and others".</p>

      <p>It does allow users to see how many likes they have received on their own posts.</p>
      <p>People entered into the trial will be informed via a message at the top of their Instagram app feed, reading: "We want your followers to focus on what you share, not how many likes your posts get.</p>
      <p>"During this test, only you will be able to see the total number of likes on your posts."</p>
