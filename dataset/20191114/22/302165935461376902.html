      <p>LONDON, Nov 15 — Roger Federer lit up the O2 Arena with a dazzling 6-4 6-3 defeat of Novak Djokovic to hand the Serb an early ATP Finals exit and wreck his bid to end the year ranked number one.</p>
      <p>In the 49th meeting between the two great rivals, Federer snapped a five-match losing run against Djokovic and gained some consolation for his heartbreaking Wimbledon final defeat.</p>
      <p>After both men had been beaten by Dominic Thiem earlier in the group, their eagerly-anticipated duel was a straight shoot-out to join the Austrian in the semi-finals.</p>
      <p>Roared on by the majority of the 17,000 fans in the arena, Federer produced an astonishing display of power, grace and precision and Djokovic simply had no answer.</p>
      <p>Defeat for Djokovic means Rafael Nadal will end the year as world number one for the fifth time.</p>
      <p>Djokovic served two double faults in the third game of the match and Federer pounced to break.</p>
      <p>With Federer dropping only three points on serve in the opening set and serving eight aces, Djokovic was not given a sniff of an opportunity.</p>
      <p>Federer faced only one break point in the match, in the fourth game of the second set, and saved it with a volley after battering a forehand deep into the corner.</p>
      <p>He broke in the next game to lead 3-2 and again in the final game to win to deafening roars. — Reuters</p>
