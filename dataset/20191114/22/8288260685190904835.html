      <h1>'Freedom' - The Leeds United change for Helder Costa after Wolves transfer</h1>
      <h2>Latest Wolves news | Costa delivered an improved performance for Marcelo Bielsa's side last weekend</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T22:11:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 22:11</time> by <a rel="author">Shane Ireland, https://www.facebook.com/ShaneIrelandJournalist</a></address>
      <p>Danny Mills thinks a small tactical change from Marcelo Bielsa has taken the shackles off Helder Costa at Leeds United.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/weve-been-mugged-leeds-united-17231948">The winger produced one of his best performances this season</a> as Leeds beat Blackburn Rovers 2-1 last Saturday to keep their Championship promotion bid on track.</p>
      <p>Costa has struggled to make a real impact for the Whites so far after joining from <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolverhampton Wanderers</a> and <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/helder-costa-leeds-wolves-news-17200705">has been criticised by pundits.</a></p>
      <p>But he gave a far more encouraging display against Rovers at Elland Road and Mills reckons it’s all down to a slight tweak from Bielsa.</p>

      <p>“It was a bit more of a 3-4-3 formation, tweaked a little bit,” the former Leeds and England full-back told <a href="https://www.footballinsider247.com/exclusive-danny-mills-raves-over-little-change-which-has-had-big-impact-on-leeds-united-25-yr-old/">Football Insider.</a></p>
      <p>“More or less with wing backs and of course that just allows Costa to play a little bit higher up the pitch and to use that pace and ability go forward – not just having to defend as a wing-back.</p>
      <p>“Sometimes it’s those little changes, those small, little, tactical changes that can often help a player out, release you of your defensive duties and allows you freedom going forward.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Costa signed for Leeds on a season-long loan from Wolves in the summer and he’ll become their record buy when the move is made permanent for £15m next year.</p>
      <p>When Bielsa was asked for his verdict on Costa after the game, he said: “In the second half, better than in the first one.</p>
      <p>“He had the ability of unbalance that he showed. He has to achieve more than just chances than those ones that he has got in the match.”</p>
