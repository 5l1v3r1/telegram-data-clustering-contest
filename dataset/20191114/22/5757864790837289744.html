      <p>Unicorns may not be real (sorry), but we know there's at least one puppy in the world with a tail growing out of its head. As <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/laurenstrapagiel/narwhal-dog-unicorn-extra-tail">Buzzfeed News</a> reports, Narwhal (<a href="https://pittsburgh.cbslocal.com/2019/11/13/unicorn-dog-narwhal-has-tail-growing-out-of-his-head/">short for</a> “Narwhal the Little Magical Furry Unicorn”) was born with an extra tail where a unicorn's horn would be.</p>
      <p>Rochelle Steffen, founder of the Jackson, Missouri, animal rescue <a href="https://www.facebook.com/macthepitbull/?tn-str=k*F">Mac's Mission</a>, noticed the one-of-a-kind dog in a Facebook post. The puppy had been abandoned and was in need of a new home. Mac's Mission takes in a lot of animals with histories of abuse, injuries, or <a href="https://www.iampitbullstrong.com/sponsors">physical abnormalities</a> that make them harder to adopt. When Steffen saw the unicorn dog, she knew that he was a perfect candidate for her rescue.</p>

      <p>Narhwal's "tusk" is about a third of the size of his regular tail, and according to his veterinarian, it causes him no pain or medical issues. He can't wag the bonus tail, but it does wave <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/13/us/narwhal-unicorn-puppy-tail-intl-hnk-scli/index.html">back and forth</a> when he plays.</p>
      <p>Mac's Mission shared a picture of Narwhal on Facebook, and it soon became clear that they would have no trouble finding him a forever home. The original post has been shared nearly <a href="https://www.facebook.com/macthepitbull/posts/2563926487021638">2000 times</a>. While many people have <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/13/us/narwhal-unicorn-puppy-tail-intl-hnk-scli/index.html">expressed interest</a> in adopting him, the rescue plans to care for him a little longer and make sure he's healthy and adjusted before placing him with a family.</p>
