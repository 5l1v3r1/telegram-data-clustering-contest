      <p><b>Genesis Motors Australia</b> has announced <b>David Lederer</b> as its new head, in advance of a new product onslaught to come in 2020.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/hyundai/">Hyundai</a> luxury arm's local division has been operating without a proper boss for a number of months now, after former general manager, Peter Evans, <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/748557/genesis-australia-boss-peter-evans-steps-down-months-before-brand-launch/">stepped down in April</a> just months ahead of <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/genesis/">Genesis's</a> local launch.</p>
      <p>Mr. Lederer has spent "the majority of his working life at <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/bmw/">BMW</a>", with experience "in numerous departments across the business including finance, product planning, sales and sales channel development", including leading the redevelopment of the Bavarian marque's flagship Sydney showroom.</p>
      <p>He will be overseeing all aspects of the Genesis brand in Australia, including sales, aftersales, marketing and retail development.</p>
      <p>Next year the company plans to launch two key new products Down Under, the first being the all-new <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/genesis/g80/">G80</a> limousine which will take on the <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/bmw/5-series/">BMW 5 Series</a> and <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/tag/mercedes-benz-e-class/">Mercedes-Benz E-Class</a>, along with its first-ever SUV – believed to be named <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/tag/genesis-gv80/">GV80</a>.</p>

      <p>"I am excited to be joining Genesis, and very much look forward to the challenge of establishing Korea’s first true luxury automotive brand here in Australia," Lederer said.</p>
      <p>"Our first electric vehicle is also on the horizon, and our goal is to eventually offer alternative propulsion in all segments of our product portfolio."</p>
      <p>"With such a diverse range of impressive new products it really is an exciting time to be joining the brand."</p>
      <p>According to VFACTS data, Genesis has sold 90 vehicles year-to-date (to October 31) across its <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/genesis/g70/">G70</a> and G80 sedan model lines.</p>
      <p>Given the brand only officially launched in June, and currently only has one proper dealership in Sydney, named <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/769245/genesis-studio-sydney-opens-its-doors/">Genesis Studio Sydney</a>, there's a way to go for the Korean marque.</p>
      <p>Two more Genesis Studio showrooms are due to hit Melbourne and Brisbane in 2020.</p>
