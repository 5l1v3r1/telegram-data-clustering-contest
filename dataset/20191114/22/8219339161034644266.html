      <h1>Selling your MacBook? Hereâ€™s how to repair the butterfly keyboard for free and get more money</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T22:48:28+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 22:48</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5mac.com/author/michaelpotuck/" target="_blank">Michael Potuck</a></address>
      <p>Ready to <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/11/14/15-inch-vs-16-inch-macbook-pro-comparison/">pick up the 16-inch MacBook Pro</a> with the scissor switch Magic Keyboard? If youâ€™re thinking of selling your current MacBook to upgrade to Appleâ€™s latest, follow along for how to repair or replace your current butterfly keyboard for free to get more money when you sell your notebook.</p>
      <p>Appleâ€™s butterfly keyboards in MacBooks that date back to 2015 have seen <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/04/09/macbook-pro-keyboard-problem/">serious problems</a> with debris being caught under keys. This causes keys to not work, or in some cases the computer registering a double press when keys are just pressed once.</p>
      <p>All of Appleâ€™s <a href="https://amzn.to/2LS5Io4">MacBooks</a> with butterfly keyboards are eligible for the free service program. The 2018 MacBook Pro and MacBook Air featured the third-generation butterfly keyboard that includes a new gasket, but <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/03/27/apple-keyboard-sorry/">that didnâ€™t fully solve the issue for many users</a>.</p>
      <p>Finally, even after 2019 MacBook Pro models <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/05/21/apple-announces-more-powerful-8-core-macbook-pro-with-updated-butterfly-keyboard-design/">included a new material in the keyboards</a> (a fourth iteration), theyÂ <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/05/21/apple-expands-macbook-keyboard-service-program/">becameÂ eligible for the keyboard service program</a> as soon as they debuted.</p>
      <p>So if youâ€™re looking to sell your current MacBook, particularly on <a href="http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?ff3=4&amp;pub=5575250918&amp;toolid=10001&amp;campid=5338001361&amp;customid=&amp;mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com">eBay</a>, <a href="https://swappa.com/">Swappa</a>, Craigslist, or to a friend or family member, youâ€™ll likely be able to sell it for more with a fully functioning, and maybe brand-new keyboard (and youâ€™ll probably feel better handing it off knowing the keyboard isnâ€™t glitching too ðŸ˜„).</p>

      <p>Per Appleâ€™s keyboard service program, in some cases, they will replace the entire keyboard, and others may repair certain keys.</p>
