      <p>He spoke on Thursday in Manchester, New Hampshire, with ABC News' Whit Johnson on his decision to announce.</p>
      <p>Patrick, as it currently stands, won't be on the primary ballot in Arkansas or Alabama, but he still believes that he can win the party's nomination.</p>
      <p>"I wouldn't be in it if I didn't think I could win it," Patrick told Johnson.</p>
      <p>Patrick said he also believes he can be competitive in South Carolina, a state where former Vice President Joe Biden has a foothold.</p>
      <p>"I think you know," he told ABC News, "the objective is to be competitive everywhere."</p>

      <p>Patrick dismissed the notion that he was getting into the race late, saying, "From the voters' perspective, it's not so late."</p>
      <p>He may turn out to be right. According to a CNN/University of New Hampshire poll, 61% of likely democratic New Hampshire primary voters said they might change their mind on supporting a candidate before the primary.</p>
      <p>But that doesn't mean it's not an uphill climb.</p>
      <p>"We have to do the work. We have to build the organization," Patrick said.</p>
      <p>Prior to entering the race, Patrick consulted with those who've done so before. Johnson spoke with former President Barack Obama this week and told him, "I was close to a decision. Then when I had made one, I called him and said that we were going. And he's been great."</p>
      <p>The former Massachusetts governor spent time with Obama last year as he considered a presidential run. Patrick said the former president gave him insights into his own campaign and addressed the potential strengths and weaknesses of Patrick's.</p>
      <p>"He's equally encouraging and open to others who have thought about it and who have gotten in. And I appreciate it," Patrick said of Obama.</p>

      <p>Patrick said he expects he can carve out his own path on a densely populated campaign trail.</p>
      <p>He said he supports a public option in the Affordable Care Act and believes private insurance can play a role. The Bain Capital alum also said he's against a wealth tax.</p>
      <p>"Wealth to me is not the problem. It's greed. And it's the way the system has been so skewed to favor the well-connected," he added.</p>
      <p>Patrick, who's scheduled to attend the California Democratic Party's Presidential Forum on Friday and the Nevada Democratic Party's "First In The West" dinner on Sunday, won't appear on next week's debate stage -- and he may not see December's either. He didn't seem particularly worried.</p>
      <p>"I'm not sure, having watched all the debates, that it's something to aspire to, as a practical matter," he told ABC News. "It's just that it hasn't really functioned as a way to inform people about what the candidates are about."</p>
