      <p>This adorable puppy, only ten weeks old, has a thing on its little face that looks like a tail. He can't wag it, though.</p>
      <p>His name is Narwhal. He's become internet famous as the Unicorn Puppy.</p>
      <p>The founder of the rescue facility caring for the dog says Narwhal doesn't seem to be mindful of or affected by his extra tail.</p>
      <p>The video is from the Associated Press, which explains:</p>
      <blockquote>Narwhal was rescued over the weekend and sent to Mac’s Mission in Jackson, which specializes in fostering animals with special needs.<br/><br/>Mac’s Mission founder Rochelle Steffen says Narwhal doesn’t notice the extra tail and is otherwise a happy, healthy puppy. Although it looks like a tail, Narwhal cannot wag it.<br/><br/>Steffen says the rescue group has been flooded with requests from people wanting to adopt Narwhal since his picture hit social media. But he’ll remain at Mac’s Mission so his caretakers can be sure the tail doesn’t grow out of proportion to his face and cause him problems.</blockquote>

      <blockquote>The million dollar question about Narwhals extra tail on his face. Is it connected and does it wag? The extra tail is not connected to anything and has no real use other than making him the COOLEST PUPPY EVER! One of our followers said, “It appears they assembled the puppy wrong. Always follow the directions people!” This is a true experience of having “extra parts” during assembly. Dr. Heuring said there is no real reason at this time for the unicorn tail to be removed (and we all wish it wagged)!! Pretty sure the staff at Cape Small also gushed all over this little nugget! The unicorn face tail does not bother Narwhal and he never slows down just like any normal puppy. He seems completely healthy other than some usual puppy worms he got meds for. He is not available for adoption immediately as we want him to grow a bit more and truly make sure the tail doesn’t become a bother or problem. Right now he is pretty much the most unique amazing example of what we do here and we are so thankful to have the chance to be part of his journey. Thank you everyone for helping us help them!</blockquote>
