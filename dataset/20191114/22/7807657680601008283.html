      <h3>What you need to know</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Microsoft announced a number of games coming to Xbox Game Pass at X019.</li>
        <li>Unfortunately, Final Fantasy XIV wasn't one the list.</li>
        <li>Xbox's Phil Spencer says that it's going to be on Xbox.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For years, Xbox One owners have been requesting Microsoft to partner with Square Enix and bring <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/final-fantasy-xiv-gets-nier-automata-raid-month-pc">Final Fantasy XIV</a> to the console. While we've known that the two companies have been in negotiations for years at this point, it looks like the game may be coming sooner rather than later.</p>
      <p>According to an interview between Xbox's Phil Spencer and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/14/20964604/final-fantasy-microsoft-xbox-game-pass-vii-viii-ix-x-zodiac-age-remaster-xiii">The Verge</a>, the Microsoft executive revealed that he was working with Square Enix to bring the came to "Xbox." You can read an excerpt from the report below.</p>
      <blockquote>The big two games missing from this list are... Final Fantasy XI and XIV. However, speaking to members of the press at X019 earlier today, Microsoft's gaming chief, Phil Spencer, said that the company plans to bring Final Fantasy XIV to the service at a later date. 'I wanted you to know, rest assured that we will be bringing that game to Xbox,' said Spencer. 'We have a great relationship with Yoshida-san and we're working through what it means.'</blockquote>
      <p>Hopefully, both companies will announce concrete plans soon. It's unclear what the hold-up is at this point because it's been going on for years. Would you play Final Fantasy XIV on Xbox One? Let us know.</p>
