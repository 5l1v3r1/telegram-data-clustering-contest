      <p>US studio <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/tag/the-new-design-project/">The New Design Project</a> has decorated this West Village cookie shop with speckled terrazzo, beige tiles and creamy walls to reference the baked goods for sale.</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://thenewdesignproject.com/">Brooklyn studio</a> was enlisted to design the Chip Cookies and Cream shop on Bleecker Street in Manhattan, following its completion of the first shop in Astoria, Queens in 2017.</p>
      <p>In addition to the cookies, <a href="https://thenewdesignproject.com/">The New Design Project</a> took cues from Chip Cookies and Cream's branding, which comprises a thick, curvy logo and typeface thick in a shade of chocolate brown.</p>

      <p>"Curved architectural forms evocative of the Chip logo are paired with a colour palette of biscuit beiges and chocolate browns to create an aesthetic that feels warm, comforting and nurturing," The New Design Project said.</p>

      <p>Display cases and coffee machines rest atop a curved white bar counter that snakes through the bakery's interior. An amber, beige and black speckled terrazzo countertop covers the sculptural piece. Terrazzo also forms a small shelf that bisects one of three large, sculptural bronze mirrors placed on an adjacent wall.</p>
      <p>Behind the counter, a cabinet clad with rectangular beige tiles provides additional storage for appliances, machinery and ingredients.</p>

      <p>Three sculptural openings also puncture the rear wall of the bakery to connect the main area to an adjoining hallway. The latter is painted in a contrasting shade of brown and decorated with circular, terrazzo sconces.</p>
      <p>Furnishings in the seating area include two built-in benches upholstered with dark brown velvet and several small side stools topped with circular grey cushions.</p>
