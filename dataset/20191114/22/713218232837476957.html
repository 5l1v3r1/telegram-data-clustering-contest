      <p><b>UPDATE</b>: <i>Due to fires and other concerns, the working group has decided to postpone the survey information night. They hope to reschedule in December.</i></p>
      <p>An information night about conducting a social survey to gauge community opinion on logging native forests in the Kalang valley originally scheduled for November 20 has been delayed.</p>
      <p>Officially supported by the Bellingen Chamber of Commerce and the Bellingen Environment Centre, the survey will be conducted by community volunteers and overseen by reputable social research firm, Inca Consulting.</p>
      <p>Logging in the Kalang headwaters remains a contentious issue. The recent public rallies in the forests, meetings, marches, fundraisers and anti-logging signs in many Bellingen shopfronts indicate strong public opposition.</p>
      <p>But just how many local residents are actually opposed to native forest logging?</p>
      <p>Regardless of the outcome of the survey, a clear understanding of local residents' opinions will provide the basis for communicating effectively to key stakeholders and decision-makers.</p>
      <p>It is held by many politicians and those in the private sector that Australian organisations are bound by the unofficial notion of social licence; that any company, corporation or organisation is required to act in a trustworthy, credible and legitimate manner, in keeping with the values and expectations of the community in which it operates.</p>
      <p>A survey is a great way to get involved in forest management and contribute positively to a quality outcome for our forest and community.</p>
      <p>If you would like to be involved in the survey process, you can attend the public information night.</p>
      <p>Results of the community-led survey, its key findings, and an official report will demonstrate public opinion and potentially elicit appropriate political action.</p>
