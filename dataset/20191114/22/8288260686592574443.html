      <p>A chip shop owner has denied murdering his wife by burning her with scalding cooking oil, a court has heard.</p>
      <p>Geoffrey Bran, 71, said wife Mavis Bran, 69, was "confused" when she alleged he had attacked her at the Chipoteria chip shop in Hermon, Carmarthenshire, before she died in hospital six days later.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, Bran told Swansea Crown Court his wife was horrifically burned after she slipped and pulled a deep fat fryer down on top of herself.</p>
      <p>But he said he "couldn't find an answer" as to why he then ignored her for two hours, leaving a friend to call for an ambulance after she ran home while he continued to serve customers.</p>
      <p>Prosecutor Paul Lewis QC asked Bran: "You knew your wife was in a bad way for two-and-a-half hours, yet you paid her not one jot of attention. Do you agree?"</p>

      <p>Bran answered: "Yes, totally."</p>
      <p>Asked why he didn't tend to Mrs Bran or call her an ambulance, Bran replied: "I can't find a reason why I didn't."</p>
      <p>Mr Lewis asked: "Was it shame? Fear? A guilty conscience?"</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Bran replied: "No."</p>
      <p>He added: "I was in another world, I think. I just lost the plot."</p>
      <p>Bran was asked by the prosecutor if he still loved his wife, to which he said yes, then began to cry when confirming that he missed her.</p>
      <p>Bran said his wife had in the past spread lies about him abusing her, and claimed she was "halfway" to being drunk on the afternoon she suffered her injuries after drinking glasses of red wine.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>When she was treated by paramedics Mrs Bran had a blood alcohol reading of 108 mg/dl, higher than the drink-drive limit of 80mg/dl.</p>
      <p>Bran also said he believed his wife pulled the deep fat fryer on top of herself by grabbing a frying basket attached to it after she slipped, but Mr Lewis reminded him his evidence was the basket had been removed.</p>
      <p>Mr Lewis said: "You've told the jury the baskets were removed. The fish was overcooked, Mavis got the hump and threw the fish onto the trays.</p>
      <p>"You didn't say a word about the basket being put back in. Not a word."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Mrs Bran told witnesses her husband of 38 years had "flipped" and attacked her with a fryer because she was "nagging" him.</p>
      <p>She suffered burns to 46% of her body and died in Morriston Hospital in Swansea six days after the alleged attack on October 23 last year.</p>
      <p>Bran, from Hermon, denies murder.</p>
      <p>The trial continues.</p>
