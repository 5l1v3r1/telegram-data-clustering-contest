      <p>LONDON, Nov 15 — England’s Premier League has promised to improve and speed up the use of the VAR system following several controversial decisions and widespread criticism from fans and pundits.</p>
      <p>The Premier League, using the technology for the first time this season, said in a statement that VAR was discussed at length during a shareholders meeting yesterday and Mike Riley, its chief referee, accepted that “improvement is required”.</p>
      <p>“The Premier League and PGMOL (match officials) committed to improving the consistency of decisions, speeding up processes and increasing communication to fans,” it said.</p>
      <p>Riley told clubs that speed and consistency of decision-making “are priority areas of work and will improve as the officials become more experienced with the technology and protocols”.</p>
      <p>More information will be provided to fans, such as explaining why an incident was being looked at, Riley said.</p>
      <p>“Ensuring the pace and tempo of Premier League football remains an important focus for clubs,” the statement added.</p>
      <p>“The core principles of VAR were reiterated. These are minimum interference for maximum benefit, maintaining the pace and tempo of Premier League football and correcting clear and obvious on-field errors.”</p>
      <p>Unlike other leagues which use VAR, such as Serie A and the Bundesliga, Premier League referees do not routinely view incidents on the pitchside monitor and this is to remained unchanged.</p>
      <p>“It was reemphasised that it would be reserved for unseen incidents, or when information from the VAR is outside the expectation range of the referee,” said the statement.</p>
      <p>Aston Villa chief executive Christian Purslow told reporters there was a “very robust discussion”.</p>
      <p>“Messages to through to the league and the referees’ association that fans are unhappy and many other stakeholders think we have got to do a whole lot better,” he said. — Reuters</p>
