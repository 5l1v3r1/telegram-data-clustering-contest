        <b>A British woman convicted of killing a US patient by giving her botched buttock-enhancement injections has been sentenced to a year in New York jail.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Donna Francis had pleaded guilty to criminally negligent homicide for the 2015 death of Kelly Mayhew after she was extradited from the UK in August.</p>
      <p>Francis was given the maximum sentence allowed in the extradition agreement.</p>
      <p>"The phrase 'getting away with murder' certainly applies to you," New York Judge Kenneth Holder said on Thursday.</p>
      <p>"If you have a conscience, this is going to haunt you much longer than the one-year sentence you're going to serve."</p>
      <p>Francis, 39, who is originally from Loughton, Essex, was sentenced in the Queens Supreme Court in New York for causing the death of Mayhew in May 2015.</p>
      <p>At her sentencing, Francis was in tears, and said she regretted the incident.</p>
      <p>"It wasn't my intention to hurt anyone," she said. "I'm sorry for all the years this has been going on. I'm just sorry."</p>
      <p>Mayhew and her mother had travelled to New York from Maryland to pay Francis - who has no medical licence - $1,600 (Â£1,200) for a buttock enhancement procedure.</p>
      <p>Mayhew went into cardiac arrest after the botched silicone injections were administered in the basement of a house.</p>
      <p>Her brother, who read a statement on behalf of their mother in court, said Francis had refused to call 911 or provide an address to give first responders, <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/14/queens-woman-who-gave-fatal-butt-lift-sentenced-to-one-year-in-prison/">the New York Post reported</a>.</p>
      <p>Mayhew eventually died from systemic silicone emboli, when the unencapsulated silicone entered her bloodstream and caused an embolism, the medical examiner found.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors said Francis had left the dying woman and her mother and fled to London, where she remained until the extradition deal was reached this summer.</p>
