      <h1>UFC fighter rankings: Zabit up at 145, Volkov up at heavyweight</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T22:00:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 22:00</time> by <a rel="author">Tim Burke</a></address>
      <p>The rankings weren’t exactly lit afire following UFC Moscow. While the main event was highly relevant, there wasn’t much of note otherwise - just a lot of local fighters plying their trade and trying to keep their jobs. Zabit Magomedsharipov did his part in trying to earn a featherweight title shot by defeating Calvin Kattar, and Alexander Volkov dispatched Greg Hardy rather easily. But other than that, it’s slim pickings.</p>
      <p>Here’s a look at the few changes for this week.</p>
      <p>P4P - No changes.</p>
      <p>Heavyweight - Volkov is up one spot into a tie for six with Alistair Overeem after his co-headlining win. Walt Harris is up one to eight. Shail Abdurakhimov fell one spot to nine.</p>
      <p>Light Heavyweight - No changes.</p>
      <p>Middleweight - No changes.</p>
      <p>Welterweight - No changes.</p>
      <p>Lightweight - No changes.</p>
      <p>Featherweight - Zabit is up one to four. Frankie Edgar falls to five, and presumably lower in the near future since he’s dropping to 135.</p>
      <p>Bantamweight - No changes.</p>
      <p>Flyweight - No changes.</p>
      <p>Women’s Bantamweight - Irene Aldana fell two spots from eight to ten for some reason. Marion Reneau and Sara McMann are up one to eight and nine.</p>
      <p>Women’s Flyweight - No changes.</p>
      <p>Women’s Strawweight - No changes.</p>
