      <h1>Red Symons explains why he never takes time to smell the roses, or deodorant</h1>

      <p>Phantosmia. Remember that word.</p>
      <p>The afternoon was temperate and sunny. Promenading towards me, hand in hand, came a mother and six-year-old daughter.</p>
      <p>The daughter was holding forth and the mother was pleased and attentive.</p>
      <p>As we met the mother gave the slightest nudge to the daughter and she performed for us. She offered a small piece of paper with a flower printed on it.</p>
      <p>“Would you like to smell this?”</p>
      <p>A pause. I held her gaze. “No,” I said.</p>
      <p>Shock registered on the child’s face. Welcome to showbiz.</p>
      <p>A pause.</p>
      <p>“I have no sense of smell. I bumped my head and now I can’t smell anything.”</p>
      <p>They processed this information. I pursued the newly interesting topic.</p>
      <blockquote>If you had to lose a sense, which would it be?”</blockquote>
      <p>I pointed to my ears, “Hearing?” I pointed to my eyes, “Sight?”</p>
      <p>Back in the game, the child leapt in with enthusiasm, “Taste”.</p>
      <p>This was an answer worthy of psychoanalysis in 20 years time. It may mean nothing. It may mean more.</p>
      <p>It was time for the curtain closer. I offered this.</p>
      <p>“The good thing about having no sense of smell is that if you’re at a party with a lot of people, you can fart really loudly and you don’t smell anything.”</p>
      <p>On cue, the little girl laughed at the taboo word and the mother laughed with, presumably, a more complex understanding.</p>
      <p>We parted happily, each with a story to tell.</p>
      <p>As a friend once said, you’ll either have a good time or a story to tell. Excellent. There’s a good time either way.</p>
      <p>When I was her age, my mother and I collected lavender in the park and made little silken bags to scent the wardrobe.</p>
      <p>Now I cannot pass a lavender bush without grasping a flower, crushing it in my palm and breathing it in. Scent is beyond description. I could not arrange adjectives to convey it.</p>
      <p>It smells like lavender.</p>

      <p>I discovered, a few years ago, that the lavender scent had become non-existent and duly reported this to the olfactory specialist. She gave me a bunch of scratch-and-sniff tests.</p>
      <p>Petrol spill … Nothing</p>
      <p>Dead animal … Nothing</p>
      <p>House on fire … ?</p>
      <p>With the benefit of first-world technology, she announced the self-evident.</p>
      <p>“You have no sense of smell.”</p>
      <p>With requisite care, she produced a small, intelligent, electrical device.</p>
      <p>“This is a gas detector.”</p>
      <p>Fair enough. We can all create an unhappy ending with a match and an explosion.</p>
      <p>She then braced and, with halting concern, said “there is something else you should be mindful of”.</p>
      <p>I was all ears and no nose.</p>
      <p>“Personal hygiene.”</p>
      <p>I laughed out loud.</p>
      <p>At my local parfumerie they know my well-rehearsed routines and stand back with wry smiles and rolling eyes.</p>
      <p>I pluck the eau de cologne that I once preferred from the shelf and approach unsuspecting customers for advice.</p>
      <p>I explain that I cannot smell and stretch my arm up into the air.</p>
      <p>I proffer my armpit, press it towards them and ask: “What would you do with this smell?”</p>
      <p>They draw back laughing at the rich mixture of smell and the impropriety.</p>
      <p>Yes, I can still taste. Must I list all five? Or is it six?</p>
      <p>Perhaps it’s like being colour blind. I can make out the shapes, but I’ve lost some of the detail.</p>
      <p>Imagine having a phantom limb. You simply feel an itch in your arm and then discover that your arm’s not there. It feels the same.</p>
      <p>It turns out that there is something called phantosmia. Phantom smells.</p>
      <p>It’s the neurons still firing in the brain despite the nose not sending the alert, like a car engine still running after you’ve taken the keys out.</p>
      <p>The smells are often burning rubber, cigarettes, rotting and mouldy. Sometimes they are like nothing you’ve ever smelt before.</p>
      <p>If I had phantosmia I could re-enter the world of bad smells. Fortunately I don’t fall into the unfortunate category of those with phantosmia..</p>
      <p>Hang on! Was that a smell or a memory?</p>
