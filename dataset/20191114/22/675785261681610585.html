      <h1>Cristiano Ronaldo closes on 100 international goals after latest Portugal super-show</h1>
      <h2>PORTUGAL 6-0 LITHUANIA: The Juventus superstar took his Seleccao total to 98 with another treble in their Euro 2020 qualifier in Faro</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T22:33:48+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 22:33</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Richards, https://www.facebook.com/AARichards/</a></address>
      <p>Portugal captain Cristano Ronaldo continued his quest to net 100 international goals, bagging a hat-trick in the Seleccao's 6-0 thrashing of Lithuania.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/juventus-fc">Juventus</a> striker had arrived in Faro with questions being asked of a supposed knee injury after being substituted last weekend after a below-par display against AC Milan.</p>
      <p>But the 34 year-old responded with the 55th treble of his illustrious career and his ninth for his country.</p>
      <p>Ronaldo opened the scoring at the Estadio Do Algarve after just seven minutes, scoring from the penalty spot.</p>
      <p>And after 22 minutes he doubled the hosts' lead, curling home wonderfully after being sent clear by Goncalo Paciencia.</p>

      <p>Ronaldo went close to adding a third, but that honour fell to Pizzi, seven minutes into the second half.</p>
      <p>Paciencia made it 4-0, before Manchester City's Bernardo Silva bagged a fifth, with a delightful left-foot finish.</p>
      <p>Ronaldo had been frustrated in his bid to notch his hat-trick, but finally made his mark in the 65th minute, ruthlessly finding the net to take his international tally to 98.</p>
      <p>He was substituted by coach Fernando Santos with seven minutes remaining, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> ' forward Diogo Jota coming on for his senior Portugal debut.</p>

      <p>Ronaldo will now look to score twice on Sunday when Portugal face Luxembourg, to seal his century.</p>
      <p>Ronaldo is seeking to become only the second man to reach 100 international goals, and the first European, after Iran's Ali Daei.</p>
      <p>Portugal boss Santos, when asked if it was a perfect showing post-game, said: "It never is, but it was good, within what we had planned.</p>
      <p>"We were strong offensively, we controlled the game."</p>
      <p>Asked about Ronaldo's knee, Santos continued: "I asked him if he was okay to play, it was just a case of having a conversation with him.</p>
      <p>"I never had any doubts about his condition, it was other people who had them. Nothing surprises me about Cristiano."</p>
