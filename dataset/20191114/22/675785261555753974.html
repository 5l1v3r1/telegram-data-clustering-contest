      <h2>Two-time Rugby World Cup winner Williams is Toronto Wolfpack's new signing - and now the highest-paid player in the history of either league or union</h2>

      <p>Toronto boss Brian McDermott insists the Canadian city is exactly the right place for Sonny Bill Williams to take rugby league's appeal global.</p>
      <p>New Zealander Williams was unveiled by the Wolfpack yesterday as the two-time Rugby World Cup winner becomes the highest-paid player in the history of either code.</p>
      <p>McDermott explained that owner David Argyle stressed the lure of Toronto to him - telling of how a top NRL club had asked the Wolfpack supremo to invest in them - simply on the strength of the Toronto name.</p>
      <p>And ex-Leeds coach McDermott believes the signing of Sonny Bill will make the world sit up and take note of Super League.</p>

      <p>"Leeds, Wigan, Hull, St Helens - they are all big clubs," he explained. "And if something happens there - it's big in Super League. But it's not big around the world.</p>
      <p>"I don't think any multi-millionaire that wants to get involved in the sport on a significant level is going to get excited if Salford win the Grand Final. Or Featherstone get promoted.</p>
      <p>"Within the sport - it's brilliant - and I don't want to trivialise it. On a coaching level - go and look at that. But it is not exciting to people around the world.</p>
      <p>"What Toronto are doing is making people around the world take note of Super League.</p>

      <p>"There were a billion eyeballs on the World Cup semi-final. How many of those people are now clicking on one of the biggest players in the world and where he has gone to?</p>
      <p>"They may have no interest in Super League whatsoever - but they are now going to do that.</p>
      <p>"I don't want to put words into David's mouth - but if Sonny is an OK player - he'd probably be happy with that. Because he is paying for Sonny's brand.</p>
      <p>"Everyone is cool with that because it absolutely works."</p>
