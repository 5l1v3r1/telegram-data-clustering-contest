      <h1>James Dean Will Be Resurrected For A New Film: Here’s Why It’s Gross.</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T22:03:42+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 22:03</time> by <a rel="author">Ben Strum</a></address>
      <p>Movie legend <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000015/?ref_=nv_sr_1?ref_=nv_sr_1">James Dean</a> is getting resurrected for war film <i><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7176706/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1">Finding Jack</a></i>. Dean’s return to cinema is thanks to CGI and it’s upset a lot of Hollywood actors.</p>
      <p>Bringing back James Dean sets a dangerous precedent for the movie industry. Why? Because it challenges the whole idea of consent and potentially leaves thousands of actors without work.</p>
      <p>When it comes to starring in movies after death, James Dean’s CV looks good. The actor is acclaimed for his role in <i><a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/rebel_without_a_cause">Rebel Without A Cause</a></i>, which was released three weeks after his untimely death in a car crash.</p>

      <p>But while Dean filmed his part for that film, the studio behind <i>Finding Jack</i> got permission from his family to re-animate him. Basically, the lack of involvement from a living, breathing James Dean is what’s sparked controversy.</p>

      <h3>Since When Is Regenerating Dead Actors A Thing?</h3>
      <p>Well, studios have done it a bunch of times since the 90s but usually for good reason. In 1994, Canadian actor <a href="https://junkee.com/simpsons-disney-plus-ratio/229360">John Candy</a> died during the production of <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/wagons_east"><i>Wagon’s Eas</i>t</a> and he was cut into later scenes using existing footage. Then, CGI was used to resolve Brandon Lee’s role in <i>The Crow</i>; Oliver Reed in <i>Gladiator</i>; Roy Schneider in <i>Iron Cross</i> and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0908094/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1">Paul Walker</a> in <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/furious_7"><i>Furious 7</i></a>.</p>

      <p>VFX departments have gotten so good that in <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/blade_runner_2049"><i>Blade Runner 2049</i></a>, it’s virtually impossible to tell the real Rachael apart from the animated one. Basically, a combination of motion capture, some serious facial studies and hand animation can actually <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/2017/10/blade-runner-2049-vfx-replicant-sean-young-rachael-1201889072/">replicate someone’s face</a>.</p>

      <h3>So, If We’ve Done It Before, Why Can’t We Do It Again With James Dean?</h3>
      <p>The big difference between all those films and <i>Finding Jack</i> is that James Dean’s likeness isn’t getting used to complete a half-finished movie or bring back an iconic character.</p>
      <p>Instead, his CGI double will play a freshly written role.</p>
      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/zeldawilliams?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Zelda Williams</a>, daughter of the late <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000245/">Robin Williams</a>, said “It sets such an awful precedent for the future of performance.”</p>
      <p>The fact that studios are happy to invest in reincarnating vintage stars could make actual actors redundant –– and that’s a huge loss for creativity and employment.</p>
      <figure>
        <iframe data-src="https://twitter.com/zeldawilliams/status/1192141551171854338?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-embed-type="twitter-tweet" width="100%" height="0" data-service="Twitter" scrolling="no" nowide=""/>
      </figure>
      <p>While James Dean’s family consented to all of this, the actor himself never agreed to do the role.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.cmgworldwide.com/">CMG Worldwide</a>, which represents Dean’s family, said the technology: “Opens up a whole new opportunity for many of our clients who are no longer with us.”</p>
      <p>But since those clients are dead, the people raking in cash from these decisions are agents, producers and extended relatives. For example: the cousins of James Dean who run his estate.</p>
      <p>In 2013, Bruce Lee’s daughter let <a href="https://www.johnniewalker.com/en-au/">Johnnie Walker</a> re-animate her dad with CGI to promote their scotch in a Chinese ad. Fans of the late martial-arts movie star were pissed because, well, <a href="https://brucelee.com/">Bruce Lee </a>didn’t drink.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Basically, just because the rights to someone’s image goes to their next of kin doesn’t mean it’ll get used how that person would’ve wanted.</p>
      <p>Beyond how profitable dead actors might be, it’s hard to explain why they should play lead roles.</p>
      <p>Wouldn’t it be better to have new and diverse talent appear onscreen?</p>
