      <p>DETROIT — A <a href="https://www.wxyz.com/news/michigan-teacher-found-strangled-to-death-with-feet-and-hands-bound-in-dominican-republic">Michigan woman who was teaching at a Montessori school in the Dominican Republic was found dead</a> inside her apartment in Puerto Plata with her hands and feet bound.</p>
      <p>The Dominican Republic National Police said in a statement that Patricia Ann Anton was strangled to death inside her home. Anton’s cellphone, laptop, 40-inch TV, sheets and a pair of sports shoes were all stolen.</p>
      <p>The 63-year-old has been living in the Dominican Republic for the past five years working as a consultant at an elementary school.</p>
      <p>“She dedicated her life to helping children,” wrote Anton’s brother-in-law, Thomas Anton, on Facebook.</p>
      <p>Anton's cousin, Adrianne Machina, said in a statement to WXYZ that "Patty" was passionate about the Montessori school philosophy and had been working at a school in Traverse City, Michigan before she decided that — with her husband traveling for work and her children out of the house — she wanted to travel to South America and teach. She first taught in Guatemala but then found the right fit in the Dominican Republic at 3 Mariposas Montessori.</p>
      <p>"(Patty) ... believed Montessori education is the path out of poverty and the way to teach children to explore their world and build self-reliance," Machina wrote.</p>
      <p>3 Mariposas Montessori is celebrating it’s 10th anniversary Saturday, and will have a celebration of Anton’s life Sunday on the beach.</p>
      <p>"I imagine heaven for Patty is having her feet in the sand, the sun on her face, and basking in all of our love," Machina wrote.</p>
