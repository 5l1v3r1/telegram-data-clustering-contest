      <p>TWO Mandurah locations have been transformed into a tourism drawcard aimed at creating fantastic additional photo opportunities for visitors and locals alike.</p>
      <p>Visit Mandurah has commissioned Australia’s most highly awarded pavement artist, Jenny McCracken to create impressive 3D illusions people can pose with.</p>
      <p>The pavement outside the Mandurah Visitor Centre on Mandurah Terrace boasts a remarkable depiction of the Peel-Harvey Estuary, while the side wall of Blue Gatehouse on the corner of Dolphin Drive and Spinnaker Quays is adorned with a giant pelican.</p>

      <p>Visit Mandurah general manager Anita Kane said the locations were strategically selected to encourage people to linger a little longer in the city centre’s tourism precinct, and encourage them to walk over to the marina.</p>
      <p>“Visit Mandurah has identified public 3D art and 3D street painting as a great way to entertain and interact with visitors,” she said.</p>
      <p>“It also encourages people to stop and pose with the art and share their photos on social media, promoting our wonderful city.</p>

      <p>“The subjects of the artworks are designed to educate people about Mandurah’s abundant marine wildlife and the fact our estuary is twice the size of Sydney Harbour.”</p>
      <p>Each artwork has clear position markers and viewing points on the ground to instruct people where they need to stand to get the best 3D effect.</p>
      <p>There is a fact about Mandurah and its wildlife next to the view point markers and people posting photos will be encouraged to use the hashtag #visitmandurah to help raise awareness.</p>
      <p>The 3D artworks are expected to last for around 12 months, acting as a longer-term visitor attraction. For more information on things to do in Mandurah, go to visitmandurah.com.</p>
