      <p>Kieffer Moore plans to fire Wales to the 2020 European Championship just nine months after a fractured skull left him fearing for his future.</p>
      <p>Moore suffered the horror injury – similar to the one which ended the career of Hull and England midfielder Ryan Mason in 2018 – playing for former club Barnsley at Gillingham in February.</p>
      <p>The 6ft 5ins striker was unconscious on the pitch for eight minutes after challenging for a header.</p>

      <p>Moore was rushed to hospital and in the following days the 27-year-old was forced to contemplate retirement and a future career as a personal trainer.</p>
      <p>“It was a horrendous injury,” Moore recalled ahead of Wales’ vital Euro 2020 qualifier in Azerbaijan on Saturday.</p>
      <p>“At the time I didn’t remember much. But as the weeks went on I started remembering it all again.</p>
      <p>“The defender headed the side of my head, I fractured my temporal bone and had a really nasty concussion.</p>

      <p>“I wasn’t in a good way. My agent was there and he was ringing my mum and girlfriend – and they weren’t best pleased.</p>
      <p>“I had blood streaming out of my ears. It was quite graphic.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t have an operation, but I had a CT scan and multiple other scans and they determined the outcome.”</p>
      <p>Moore spent two months out before playing a few games at the end of the season and then joined Wigan in a reported £3million summer deal.</p>
      <p>Torquay-born Moore – who qualifies for Wales through his maternal grandfather – made his international debut in a September friendly against Belarus and scored on his first competitive outing in Slovakia, a 1-1 draw in Euro 2020 qualifying.</p>

      <p>“I believe that moment (fracturing his skull) has put a lot of things into perspective for me,” Moore said.</p>
      <p>“How l live my life and what I want from my career as a footballer.</p>
      <p>“There were talks about retiring, but I made a very good recovery and now I’m here.</p>
      <p>“I still have to go up for headers, and if I believed I couldn’t do that anymore I would walk out of the game.</p>

      <p>The exotically named Moore – he was christened after the actor Kiefer Sutherland and owes his middle names Roberto and Francesco to his Italian family heritage – has had to be patient for his success.</p>
      <p>Moore trod the non-league boards at Truro and Dorchester, played in the cold of Norway at Viking FK, and journeyed to Yeovil, Forest Green, Torquay, Ipswich and Rotherham before ending up at Barnsley.</p>
      <p>All of which seems a long way from joining Gareth Bale and Daniel James in attack as Wales chase six points from qualifiers against Azerbaijan and Hungary to book a place at next summer’s Euro 2020 finals.</p>

      <p>“When you look back on it, it’s mental how my life has changed in such a short space of time,” Moore said.</p>
      <p>“But I know what I can do and I’ve done it on big stages.</p>
      <p>“It was all about proving myself to even get on the pitch, and then once I was there I knew that it would shine through.</p>
      <p>“Qualifying for the Euros would be a massive achievement and honour, not just for me but the whole nation. It would be unbelievable.”</p>
