      <h1>Meghan Markle and Prince Harry are right to cancel Christmas with the royal rellies</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T22:11:28+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 22:11</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/author/kate-halfpenny/" target="_blank">Kate Halfpenny</a></address>
      <p>In a twist that will shock nobody, the British have reacted predictably to Meghan Markle and Prince Harry’s decision to ditch the traditional royal Christmas celebrations at Sandringham.</p>
      <p>With tabloids including the <i>Daily Express</i> slamming the Sussexes’ move as <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/royal/1203614/Meghan-Markle-latest-news-Prince-Harry-Queen-Elizabeth-Christmas-royal-family-updates">“a snub” to the Queen</a>, “callous” and “cold” Meghan and Harry were predictably piled on by social media critics.</p>
      <p>The duke (“Hazbeen”) should reconsider, given his poor grandad is deep in his twilight years etc, insisted Twitter users. Not to mention what Diana – famously bored to tears by Sandringham – “would think”.</p>
      <p>But Meghan was the real villain, with calls to “dump her at once”. Said the <i>Express</i>, “It can’t be about her.”</p>
      <p>Can’t it? If I was still my school debating captain, the core of my argument would be the Brits can’t have it both ways.</p>
      <p>They can’t loathe the Sussexes yet at the same time never want to let them out of sight.</p>
      <p>If you want to keep her around, make her feel welcome.</p>
      <p>It’s interesting and dispiriting that a country that has royally stuffed up the path of its own future is so judgmental about where a family eats its Christmas turkey.</p>
      <p>What also gets my goat is the notion Meghan, a woman, is now owned by the family of Harry, a man, and that being with his family somehow trumps being with hers, small and ordinary though it may be.</p>
      <p>Most people ‘share’ Christmas, spending one year with one partner’s family, the next with the other’s.</p>
      <p>It’s hardly unusual for Meghan and Harry to do the same, especially when she rarely sees her mother and will want son Archie’s first Christmas to be about him.</p>

      <p>Rather than be a knife to the heart for the Queen, the pair’s festive news came direct from Buckingham Palace.</p>
      <p>Its wording was deliberate and its message clear: The monarch is on board. It has been done before. Nothing to see here people, so move on.</p>
      <p>Towards the end of November, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex will stop official duties for “extended family time”, the palace said in a statement on Wednesday afternoon (UK time).</p>
      <p>“Having spent the last two Christmases at Sandringham, Their Royal Highnesses will spend the holiday this year, as a new family, with the Duchess’ mother Doria Ragland.</p>
      <p>“This decision is in line with precedent set previously by other members of the Royal Family, and has the support of Her Majesty The Queen.”</p>
      <p>The precedent? The Queen’s other grandchildren including Zara Tindall and her brother Peter Phillips have celebrated with the in-laws because, 21st century.</p>
      <p>Most importantly, <a href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/entertainment/celebrity/2019/11/10/meghan-harry-kate-william/">Kate Middleton and Prince William</a> chose in 2016 to spend Christmas with her family.</p>

      <p>The Cambridges, with Prince George and Princess Charlotte, stepped out on Christmas Day in a perfect Pantone colour co-ordinated display for church near the Middleton home at Bucklebury.</p>
      <p>And the very understanding Brits loved it.</p>
      <p>Kate, not an American and not known for airing opinions, was lauded for her loyalty to her parents and for her terrific burgundy coat and glossy hair.</p>
      <p>The palace didn’t say where Harry and Meghan will spend Christmas but a <i>People</i> source claimed it won’t be at Ms Ragland’s (relatively) modest Los Angeles home.</p>
      <p>“The plans have not been finalised,” a source told<i> Vanity Fair.</i></p>
      <p>Harry has never before missed a Christmas with his family, so he’s long overdue to get out a bit more.</p>

      <p>Meghan has done her time, spending the past two years trotting off to a church she’s only recently joined, sipping Dubonnet and opening the joke gifts the Windsors adore.</p>
      <p>The “family time” for the Sussexes comes after Meghan – who is suing a UK tabloid – admitted in an interview that trying to adopt a <a href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/entertainment/celebrity/2019/10/19/meghan-markle-reveals-her-struggle-with-media-scrutiny-motherhood/">“stiff upper lip”</a> is “probably really damaging”.</p>
      <p>She’s told Harry (“H”) “It’s not enough to just survive something. That’s not the point of life. You have got to thrive,” she said.</p>
      <p>“You have got to feel happy.”</p>
      <p>If that means wearing your paper hat next to your mother in a familiar place, you do you, Meghan.</p>
      <p>Merry early Christmas. And bah humbug to mean-spirited Brits.</p>
