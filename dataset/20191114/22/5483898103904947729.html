      <h3>Adelaide media icon and FIVEaa’s Jane Reilly has announced she will retire next year.</h3>
      <p>Jane told David and Will on Friday’s FIVEaa Breakfast show:</p>
      <blockquote>“I love you dearly but I’ve decided that coming into 2020 I am hanging up the microphone… after 44 years.<br/><br/>“I walked in the doors of SAS Channel 10 back in 1975. I’ve been here for seven years. I’ve loved every minute of it except getting up early.<br/><br/>“I’m calling next year, my first year of retirement, my big gap year… no plans for next year I’m just going to freewheel, I’m going to misbehave, I’m going to have a lot of fun. I hope you will still let me back occasionally.”<br/><br/>Jane will remain on air for the next month.<br/><br/>“I’m going to have the best time -- I’m really going to act up. The other side of Jane Reilly you haven’t seen!”</blockquote>
      <p>Penbo paid tribute to Jane:</p>
      <blockquote>“Working with you has been one of the most enjoyable parts of my career.”</blockquote>
