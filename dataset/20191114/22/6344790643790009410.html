      <p>We’ve got a new red band trailer for the adaptation of the semi-autobiographical novel by <b>James Frey</b>, <b><i>A Million Little Pieces</i></b>. The film stars <b>Aaron Taylor-Johnson</b> as James, a 23 year old who has lived a drug and alcohol-addled life, sent to rehab by his brother as his last chance to save himself. The film is directed by <b>Sam Taylor-Johnson</b>, Aaron Taylor-Johnson’s wife, and co-scribe of the adapted screenplay.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <i>An alcoholic and a drug addict, 23 year-old James has two options: treatment or death. After waking up on a plane with a smashed up face and no memory of the past few weeks, he heads to rehab where he discovers much more than detox and therapy. As James endures the white-knuckle journey of mending his broken body, he heals his broken soul by connecting with other kindred spirits who also yearn and fight for a better life.</i>
