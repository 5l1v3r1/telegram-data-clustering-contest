      <p>Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson has announced the release date for his upcoming superhero film Black Adam.</p>
      <p>The Hollywood star said the DC Comics film, a spin-off from the Shazam! movie, will arrive in December 2021.</p>
      <p>Johnson shared the news with a post on Instagram, explaining how he had wanted to be a superhero growing up, specifically Superman.</p>
      <p>However, the former professional wrestler said he was always attracted to more rebellious characters - perfect for the anti-hero Black Adam.</p>
      <p>"Black Adam is blessed by magic with the powers equal to Superman, but the difference is he doesn't toe the mark or walk the line," Johnson said.</p>

      <p>"He's a rebellious, one of a kind superhero, who'll always do what's right for the people - but he does it his way.</p>
      <p>"Truth and justice - the Black Adam way. This role is unlike any other I've ever played in my career and I'm grateful to the bone we'll all go on this journey together."</p>
      <p>Black Adam was originally set to appear in 2019 superhero Shazam! which starred Zachary Levi as the titular superhero.</p>
      <p>However, producers reportedly decided to give each character their own film before bringing them together.</p>
      <p>Jaume Collet-Serra is set to direct Black Adam, which has a US release date of December 22 2021.</p>
