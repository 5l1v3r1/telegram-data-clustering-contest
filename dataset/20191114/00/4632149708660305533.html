      <p><i>By Pallavi Rabinathan Dugar<br/></i><br/>Eve teasing” – a male chauvinistic, regressive and sexist practise- is a problem encountered by women all over the world. Though it has a casual tone to it, eve teasing in truth is a rather grave offence which could in certain circumstances result in dire consequences. In common parlance eve teasing refers to an intentional act of annoying a woman in a public place. Cat calling, jeering, heckling etc. are other colloquial names used to refer to this despicable misdemeanour which has effectively been criminalised by the Indian Penal Code, 1860. Though the Code does not specifically mention the phrase ‘Eve teasing’ it encompasses the meaning of eve teasing within its ambit under several sections. <br/><br/>I chose to write on this topic primarily to create awareness amongst women about the gravity of the offence of eve teasing and its rightful classification as a crime. Contrary to common understanding eve teasing is not a causal wrongdoing and should most certainly not be treated as one. Women need not and should not suffer in silence when they are victims of eve teasing, they should promptly report it and ensure the perpetrators are penalised thereby ensuring effective curtailment of this awful offence. <br/><br/>Did you know that eve teasing as a practise has its origin and is unique only to South Asian countries? Milder forms of it are witnessed all over the world but it is rampant primarily in countries such as India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal etc. Indian women grapple with the problem of eve teasing on an everyday basis – at work, in schools, colleges, public transport, roads and every other possible public place. <br/><br/>Legal provisions pertaining to Eve teasing are contained under several Sections of the Indian Penal Code and have been classified as ‘cognizable’ (the police can arrest the accused without a warrant) and ‘non- compoundable’ (cannot be settled out of court) offences. The sections dealing with Eve teasing are: <br/><br/>Section 294: This section penalises annoying acts of obscenity by a man against a woman in a public place. Such acts include but are not limited to singing songs, reciting poems, stating words or making gestures against a woman which are obscene in nature. Thus where an auto driver passes obscene remarks at a lady passenger, or a group of men brazenly whistle hoot and pass obscene comments at a woman, or where a man tries to annoy a girl by singing vulgar songs he shall be guilty of the offence under this section and is liable to punishment for the same. <br/><br/>Section 354: This section prescribes punishment for instances of eve teasing which cross the line of verbal harassment and convert to molestation and physical abuse. Section 354 applies to acts of the accused which not only cause insult and outrage the modesty of a woman, but also causes or threatens to cause physical harm to her. Since this is a rather grave offence it is non-bailable and non-compoundable and punishable with imprisonment for a term of 1-5 years. <br/><br/>Section 354 A: This section gives protection to women from eve teasing that has underlying sexual innuendos. Thus where a man in private or in a public space verbally asks for sexual favours, makes sexually coloured remarks, or sings songs which are sexually explicit he has committed an offence under this section and can be punished with imprisonment for a term of up to 3 years. <br/><br/><br/>Section 354 D: This Section applies to acts of eve teasing which take on the form of pursuing and stalking a woman against her wishes. Thus where a man stalks a woman either in the real world or in the virtual world (through chats, emails etc.) with an intention to forge a personal relationship with her despite a clear indication of disinterest by her, shall be guilty of the offence envisaged under this section and liable to punishment which shall be fine and imprisonment for a term of three years. <br/><br/>Section 509: This section punishes all acts of eve teasing which are intended at outraging and insulting the modesty of a woman. Where a man through words, sounds, gestures, or any objects intrudes upon the privacy of a woman and outrages her modesty he shall be liable to punishment under this section with imprisonment for a period up to three years. <br/><br/><br/>Where a woman is victim to any of the offences described herein above it is in her best interest to promptly go to the nearest police station and file a First Information Report (FIR) Lodging an FIR at the earliest, is crucial to efficient investigation and prompt nabbing of the accused. Reporting the offence ensures the perpetrators is taken to task immediately thereby preventing the possibility of recurrence of the crime. It is our duty as women to not only keep abreast of the laws that have been passed in our interest but to also endeavour to ensure they are enforced at the right time. Let’s vow to do as much as we can to safeguard and protect the interests of our tribe... to stay smart... and stay safe!</p>
