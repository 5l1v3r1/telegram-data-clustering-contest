      <p><i>Earth mover is parked on lake bund as contractor hasn’t paid the owner<br/></i><br/>Over 20 days and several complaints later, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has finally managed to clean the idol immersion pond at Ulsoor Lake. The contractors have managed to clear thousands of immersed idols from the community pond. Now, the pond looks neat and clean except for the huge earth moving machine, brought from Chikkaballapur, kept on the lake bund. The earth mover lies idle on the lake bund and has been causing serious inconvenience to the hundreds of people who visit the lake in the morning and evening for a stroll from nearby areas. <br/><br/>Visitors of the lake have strongly opposed the parking of the machine. One can also see garbage tippers being parked adjacent to the fence near the idol immersion pond. “The earth mover should not be parked on the lake bund, it’s a hindrance to walkers. I want the authorities to remove it immediately,’’ said Kalidasa Reddy, a resident of Kallahalli. <br/><br/>“I will appeal to the authorities concerned to remove the earth mover from the lake bund,’’ said Mahendra Jain, president, Ulsoor Lake Residents Welfare Association. <br/><br/>It may be recalled that the BBMP Commissioner BH Anil Kumar had personally instructed the engineers concerned for being negligent in removing the immersed idols from the pond, after they had failed to clean up 20 days after the Dasara festival. “The residue of the immersed idols was an eyesore for the visitors and only recently it was cleaned. Now, the pond is clean but the contractor has to remove the earth moving machine from the lake bund which has become a hurdle for those who want to walk here,’’ said a visitor on a condition of anonymity. <br/><br/>According to reliable sources, the contractor did not pay money due to the owner of the earth mover, thus compelling the latter to park the vehicle on the lake bund, in the hope to get paid soon. <br/><br/>However, Suresh, the contractor of the idol immersion pond denied the allegation. “I will ask the vehicle owner to remove it from the lake bund,’’ said Suresh. When contacted, BBMP East Zone Chief Engineer BS Prasad said, “I am not aware of the stationary earth moving machine on the lake bund. You can contact Executive Engineer Maradi Rangappa for further details.’’ The executive engineer explained that the cleaning of the idol immersion pond requires more work. “I will ask the contractor to remove the earth mover from the lake bund as soon as possible,’’ assured Maradi Rangappa.</p>
