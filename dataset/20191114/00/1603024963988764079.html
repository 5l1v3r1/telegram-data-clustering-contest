      <p>The Indian equity market witnessed a rebound in the second half of the trading session on Thursday, November 14 as bulls pushed benchmark indices back in the green. The S&amp;P BSE Sensex rallied by more than 100 points while Nifty50 closed above 11,850.</p>
      <p>Let’s look at the final tally on D-Street – the S&amp;P BSE Sensex rose 170 points to 40,286 while the Nifty50 closed 31 points higher at 11,872 on Thursday.</p>
      <p>In terms of sectors, action was seen in IT, consumer durables, finance, and banking stocks while profit booking was seen in telecom, metals, energy, and capital goods index.</p>

      <p>Indian market started on a muted note tracking weak CPI numbers which rose to a 16-month high, and mixed cues from global markets. But, value buying at lower levels helped Nifty50 defend 11800 levels.</p>
      <p>Moody's Investors Service on November 14 cuts India's economic growth forecast to 5.6 percent for 2019, saying government measures do not address the widespread weakness in consumption demand.</p>
      <p>Experts feel that despite weakening macro data, the central bank is likely to focus on boosting growth in Asia’s third-largest economy. The government will unveil the September quarter GDP number towards the close of the month.</p>
      <p>“Trend of the market is dictated by macro releases, as WPI inflation numbers indicated weak demand in the manufacturing segment. RBI is likely to give more focus on growth rather than rising inflation in the near term which may influence a few more rate cuts,” Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services Ltd told Moneycontrol.</p>
      <p>“In terms of earnings growth, we notice that the strength of Q2 result slowed by the end of the season, which can put pressure on stock performance,” he said.</p>
