      <h1>R29’s Entertainment &amp; Culture Picks For November</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T00:00:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Jazmin Kopotsha</a></address>
      <p>It’s not all doom and gloom, kids. The descent into this deep dark winter may have arrived rather suddenly, but there’s joy to be had in this intermediary month before Christmas. <br/> <br/>November brings a hell of a selection of films as we start the slog towards awards season in 2020. <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/2018/06/202487/new-shows-on-netflix">Over on Netflix</a> you’ve got the likes of <i><a href="https://refinery29.com/en-gb/2019/10/8546197/the-king-timothee-chalamet-review">The King</a></i>, <i><a href="https://refinery29.com/en-gb/2019/10/8602398/the-crown-season-3-trailer-prince-charles">The Crown</a></i> and <i>The</i> <i>Irishman</i>, but there are a couple of gems worth making the trip to the cinema for, too. Brace yourself for a couple of big TV moments as the BBC releases its long-awaited adaptation of <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/2019/10/8605656/his-dark-materials-bbc-one-plot">Philip Pullman’s famous fantasy books</a> and Channel 4 drops us back in the middle of <i><a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/2019/10/8545664/the-end-of-the-fucking-world-season-two-first-look-netflix">The End of the F***ing World</a></i><a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/2019/10/8545664/the-end-of-the-fucking-world-season-two-first-look-netflix">.</a><br/> <br/>You’ll not be disappointed by this month’s music offerings either. Queen Celine Dion has an album to share and <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/uterine-fibroid-tumours-fka-twigs">FKA twigs</a>’ new record is finally due to drop as well. If it’s art you’re after, we’ve got offerings on various ends of the spectrum – traditional portraiture and a multisensory exhibition are both on the agenda. And no, that is not all. Here’s the best in culture and entertainment to fill your calendar over the next month.</p>

      <p><i><b>The Crown</b></i><br/><br/>At long last, the royals are back on our screens. This month we'll finally see Oscar-winner <a href="https://refinery29.com/en-gb/2019/11/8679106/the-crowns-olivia-colman-left-wing-face-queen-elizabeth">Olivia Colman as Queen Elizabeth II</a> in her highly anticipated tun in the role alongside Helena Bonham-Carter as Princess Margaret. Season three of <i>The Crown </i>promises more of that addictive drama and turmoil as we navigate through the 70s and 80s. And if you're somehow yet to sort yourself out with a Netflix account, the streaming service is offering up <a href="http://www.netflix.com/thecrown">the first episode to everyone for free</a>!<br/><br/><i>Available on Netflix from 17th November</i></p>

      <p><i><b>Harriet</b></i><br/> <br/>Tony, Emmy and Grammy award-winner Cynthia Erivo stars as the incredible Harriet Tubman in this moving biopic – the first to <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/02/224730/harriet-tubman-movie-cynthia-erivo-plot-details">document her life achievements in such depth since 1978</a>. We’ll follow her escape from slavery and how she came to lead hundreds more slaves to freedom on the Underground Railroad. Janelle Monáe, Joe Alwyn and Leslie Odom Jr all co-star.<br/><br/><i>In cinemas from 22nd November</i></p>

      <p><a href="https://www.somersethouse.org.uk/whats-on/247"><b><i>24/7:</i> <i>A Wake-up Call For Our Non-Stop World</i></b></a><br/> <br/>Life is intense. Everything is tiring. We’ve got too much on. Etcetera, etcetera. It’s a feeling that has come to define a generation and bringing it all together in a multisensory experience is this new, provocative exhibition. More than 50 different works across the visual arts and beyond will "hold a mirror to our always-on culture and invite you to step outside of your day-to-day routine to engage, reflect and reset".<br/><br/><i>At Somerset House, London until 23rd February 2020</i></p>

      <p><i><b>The End Of The F***ing World<br/></b></i> <br/>The teen cult favourite is back for a second series and if the trailer is anything to go by (shocker, they normally are), Alyssa and James’ future is very uncertain. To bring you up to speed: they ran away together though James’ plan was to kill her at some point and – BANG! – without giving too much away from the first series, their adventure is wildly interrupted. All we know is that there’s going to be a new character called Bonnie involved.<br/><br/><i>On Channel 4 from Tuesday 5th November</i></p>

      <p><i><b>Courage</b></i><b> by Celine Dion<br/></b> <br/>There’s no introduction to an album by Celine Dion that will do her, or her work, justice. So we’re not even going to attempt to say any more than that her 12th (English) record is finally available for your listening pleasure this November. No, it’s not quite like the classic ballads you were first drawn to in the '90s. But it's Celine and the album will still be excellent. <br/><br/><i>Available 15th November</i></p>

      <p><a href="https://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/whats-on/135673-hannah-gadsby-douglas-2019"><b>Hannah Gadsby: <i>Douglas</i></b></a><br/> <br/>If you’ve not seen it, you’ve probably heard about Australian comedian Hannah Gadsby’s solo show <i>Nanette</i>. It’s on Netflix, go check it out. But if you want to see her stand-up live she’ll be in London for her brand new show <i>Douglas </i>this month. There’s little to know beyond the fact that you’ll laugh and be surprised. Then again, what more do you need? <br/><br/><i>Southbank Centre, London on 3rd November</i></p>

      <p><i><b>Blue Story </b></i><br/> <br/>This crime/drama is a feature-length adaptation of Rapman’s YouTube series. Timmy and Marco are two young men from rival London postcodes. They’re childhood friends, but very different people. They attend the same school in Peckham but their gang rivalry is brewing and their relationship is quickly torn apart. <i>Top Boy</i>'s Michael Ward stars, and if you enjoyed his turn in the breakout Netflix series last month, you really need to see this film too. <br/><br/><i>In cinemas from 22nd November</i></p>

      <p><i><b>His Dark Materials<br/></b></i> <br/>Phillip Pullman’s epic fantasy trilogy is up for another screen adaptation which, thankfully, looks a damn sight better than the Daniel Craig and Nicole Kidman film from 2007. Over eight episodes we’ll be told the story of young Lyra Belacqua, an orphan who’s thrust into the middle of a complex conflict between scientific research, religious rule and dark forces that put her world (and other secret ones) in danger. <br/><br/><i>On BBC One from Sunday 3rd November</i></p>

      <p><i><b>Magdalene</b></i><b> by FKA twigs<br/></b> <br/>So far we’ve had three singles from FKA twigs' self-produced new album, <i>Magdalene</i>: "holy terrain", "cellophane" and "home with you". You might remember news of her live shows in the States earlier this year where she performed music from the new record and some old, familiar favourites. Look forward to her ethereal blend of strength and vulnerability in this one. <a href="https://i-d.vice.com/en_uk/article/zmjny4/fka-twigs-interview-magdalene-new-album">She also told <i>i-D</i> magazine</a> that the album is about "every lover that I’ve ever had, and every lover that I’m going to have". <br/><br/><i>Available 8th November</i></p>

      <p><a href="https://www.donmarwarehouse.com/production/7193/blank/"><b><i>[Blank]</i> at Donmar Warehouse</b></a><b><br/></b> <br/>Playwright Alice Birch’s ambitious new show <i>[Blank]</i> is one to be excited about. Focusing on the impact of the criminal justice system on women and their families, this intense and heartrending play has earned rave reviews all over for its stark exploration of womanhood. You’ll meet a huge array of characters that’ll challenge and provoke many perceptions. <br/><br/><i>At the Donmar Warehouse, London until 30th November</i></p>

      <p><a href="https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/exhibition/lucian-freud-self-portraits"><b><i>Lucian Freud: The Self-portraits</i></b></a><b><br/></b> <br/>Lucian Freud is likely one of those famous names and widely celebrated artists that you haven’t really engaged with beyond conversation or secondary school art lessons. But the new exhibition gathering his self-portraits in one place (a world first, by the way) is definitely worth having a nose around. The collection is described as an "engrossing study into the process of ageing" but if you’re generally fascinated by the whole idea of self-image, you might take more from this one than you think. <br/><br/><i>At the Royal Academy of Arts, London until 26th January 2020</i></p>
