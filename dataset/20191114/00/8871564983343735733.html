      <h1>Going Green: San Miguel Corporation to switch to biodegradable plastic packaging</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T00:54:45+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 00:54</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/Coconuts%20Manila" target="_blank">Coconuts Manila</a></address>
      <p>One of the country’s biggest manufacturers, San Miguel Corporation (SMC), announced yesterday that it will start using biodegradable plastic in the grocery bags, food bags, and other single-use plastic packets used as packaging for its various products.</p>
      <p>SMC said in a statement that they hope to become the first Filipino company to use bio-plastics as packaging, using materials <a href="https://www.sanmiguel.com.ph/article/smc-to-use-biodegradable-plastics-packaging">developed and tested</a> over the past five years. The Filipino multinational conglomerate — perhaps best known as the creator of the renowned San Miguel beer, but also a producer of everything from plastic-wrapped hotdogs to instant coffee packets — will be sourcing its biodegradable packaging from local firm Philippine Bioresins Corporation.</p>

      </p>
      <p>SMC said tests done by the Department of Science and Technology confirmed that the material produced by Bioresins Corp. breaks down by 65 percent in 24 months — 14 times more than non-biodegradable plastics disintegrate in the same time span.</p>
      <p>SMC President Ramon Ang said that they will be using the product initially to package cement, and later for food items, though he did not say when this will happen.</p>
      <p>“This is another way that we are helping turn plastic wastes that would have otherwise ended up in landfills or bodies of water, into useful and much-needed products — in this case, [for packaging] cement, which is used to construct buildings and infrastructure,” Ang said.</p>
      <p>He added that the move is just the latest step in the company’s shift towards sustainability, which includes the zero-waste returnable glass bottle system for SMC’s beers, cleaning up the Tullahan River near Manila Bay earlier this year, as well as shutting down SMC’s plastic-bottled-water business.</p>

      </p>
      <p>“We are very serious when it comes to sustainability. We have stopped our plastic bottled water business; we have taken on the challenge to reduce group-wide non-product water use by 50% by 2025, and we’ve poured more resources into major projects to clean up bodies of water as well as into research that supports plastic waste reduction,” Ang said.</p>
      <p>The Philippines’ plastic problem is no secret. Most Filipinos buy products in tiny sachets made of plastic because they’re more affordable than buying in bulk, and these non-biodegradable items end up clogging the country’s landfills for years. In fact, a study released by the non-profit Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives in March found that nearly <a href="http://www.no-burn.org/wp-content/uploads/PlasticsExposed-3.pdf">60 billion tiny sachets</a> and <a href="http://www.no-burn.org/waba2019/">17.5 billion plastic bags</a> are disposed of in the Philippines every year.</p>
