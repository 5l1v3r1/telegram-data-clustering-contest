      <p>On Sunday, the 24th season of Major League Soccer came to an end with the Seattle Sounders winning the MLS Cup for the second time in four years. Back in March, I set out five questions that would be answered as the 2020 season unfolded.</p>
      <p>Time to look at how things turned out.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Can Atlanta United repeat as MLS Cup winners?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Apart from Miguel Almiron moving to Newcastle United of the Premier League and Gonzalo "Pity" Martinez, the South American Player of the Year joining Atlanta there were no other significant squad moves from 2019 to 2020.</p>
      <p>The major change was Frank de Boer stepping in to replace  Gerardo "Tata" Martino as coach. It is not unusual for champion teams to struggle the next season and so it was for Atlanta United. It took until game #5 to record a win, their only win in the first six games.</p>
      <p>From there, Atlanta built momentum but not enough to overtake Eastern Conference winners, New York City FC. Even with 11 points fewer than 2018, Atlanta was still good enough for second in the east.</p>
      <p>With two shutout wins against the New England Revolution and the Philadelphia Union and New York City FC losing to Toronto FC, things were shaping up nicely for Atlanta.</p>
      <p>Things looked even better when Atlanta took an early lead on TFC and were awarded a penalty just a few minutes later. It turned into the turning point of the game. TFC goalkeeper parried Josef Martinez’s penalty kick to safety. A few minutes later TFC equalized and then scored the winning goal with a little over 10 minutes to play.</p>
      <p>The 2018 champions (and the best team MLS had ever seen) beaten by the 2017 champions (then the best team MLS had ever seen).</p>
      <p>
        <b>Can the LA Galaxy make the playoffs?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Galaxy had to scrape and scratch but they did make it back to the playoffs for the first time since 2016. The Galaxy did it with a game to spare with 56 goals scored and 55 nicely capturing the sort of season it was.</p>
      <p>Over 50% of the Galaxy’s goals came from Zlatan Ibrahimovic who will become a free agent at the start of 2020. The next highest scorer was Uriel Antuna with just 6.</p>
      <p>A first round 2-1 playoff win away win set up a Los Angeles derby in the Western Conference semi-final and the game did not disappoint. It was a game that will remembered a recounted for many years. The eight goals tied the record for most goals in an MLS playoff game and LAFC won 5-3.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Which version of DC United will we see in 2019?</b>
      </p>
      <p>It turned out to a far more consistent DC United than we saw in 2018 when a horrible start morphed into a frenetic finish and a playoff spot.</p>
      <p>This season DC United avoided the roller coaster and there was little doubt that United would make the 2019 playoffs. The worst run of results came after it was announced that Wayne Rooney would be returning to England at the end of the 2019 MLS season to play for Derby County in the Championship.</p>
      <p>DC United lost three straight games but that run masks the fact that DC’s point production dating from the Rooney announcement to season’s end was slightly better than before his departure plan was announced.</p>
      <p>Nonetheless, DC United and MLS will miss Rooney.</p>
      <p>In the end, United missed out on home advantage in the first round of the playoffs to Toronto FC by just one goal. A 5-1 loss after extra time flattered Toronto FC and left DC United wondering what might have been.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The Crew saved, what now?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Columbus Crew fans know that the long-term future of the club is secure but 2019 was anything but a success. The team did attract more fans with the average attendance increasing from 12,447 in 2018 to 14,856 but the on-field performance was sadly lacking.</p>
      <p>A 16-game run between mid-April and mid-July delivered just 1 win and 2 draws and left the Crew with too much ground to make up with less than half the season remaining. Two defeats in the final 13 games might provide hope to some Crew fans for next season but always beware of a team that plays well once the pressure is off.</p>
      <p>Federico Higuaín missed the remainder of the season after suffering an ACL injury in May and, as it stands, the Argentine midfielder has played his last game for the Crew after signing in 2012.</p>
      <p>Darlington Nagbe looks set to take Higuaín’s place and there are sure to be more new faces when the 2020 season gets underway. The Crew’s GM, Tim Bezbatchenko, has a big task ahead as he looks to build a team worthy of the new $230M stadium that should be ready in the summer of 2021.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Who will be the first coaching casualty of 2019?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The first to fall was Anthony Hudson of the Colorado Rapids, fired on May 1. Others who followed were Alan Koch (FC Cincinnati), Mike Petke (Real Salt Lake), Wílmer Cabrera (Houston Dynamo), and Rémi Garde (Montreal Impact).</p>
      <p>Three teams are already looking for a new coach for 2020 - Montreal Impact, Orlando SC, and New York City FC.</p>
