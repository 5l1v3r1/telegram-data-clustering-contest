      <h1>Bitcoin Miner Maker Canaan Sets $100 Million Target for US IPO</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T00:03:39+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 00:03</time> by <a rel="author">Wolfie Zhao</a></address>
      <p>Canaan, the world’s second-largest bitcoin miner maker, intends to raise about $100 million in its initial public offering (IPO) in the U.S.</p>
      <p>The Hangzhou, China-based manufacturer of the Avalon bitcoin miner <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1780652/000119312519291117/d773846df1a.htm">updated</a> its IPO application with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Wednesday. It’s aiming to offer 10 million American depositary shares (ADS) with each at a price of between $9 and $11.</p>
      <p>If Canaan receives enough investment interest, the offering would rake in $100 million, making it the first major bitcoin miner maker to go public in the traditional stock market.</p>
      <p>With that offering size, it would also mean Canaan commands a diluted market value of about $1.5 billion with about 2.3 billion outstanding ordinary shares after the offering. Each ADS would represent 15 Class A ordinary shares of Canaan, according to the updated filing.</p>
      <p>In Canaan’s initial IPO filing from <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/avalon-bitcoin-miner-maker-canaan-officially-files-for-400-million-us-ipo">late October</a>, the company set a placeholder amount of $400 million for its IPO ambitions. The latest figure may still be revised prior to its final listing.</p>
      <p>Previously, Canaan revealed on Nov. 5 that it brought home a profit of $13 million on revenues of $95 million for the third quarter of 2019. It reported a net loss of $45 million for the first half of 2019.</p>
