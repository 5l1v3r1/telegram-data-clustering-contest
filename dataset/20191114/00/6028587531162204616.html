      <p>If you're looking for a more stripped-down laptop that still has the horsepower to get the job done, the Lenovo IdeaPad 330s could be your salvation! You won't believe the price, either.</p>
      <p>Lenovo is well-known for creating rugged, durable machines that you can take absolutely anywhere, from the cafe to the boardroom to the LAN party down the hall. You won't have to settle for some pocket-sized NetBook either, as the Lenovo IdeaPad 330s still boasts an above-standard <b>15.6" monitor</b> with a <b>distinctive beveled edge</b>, to maximize as much of your screen as possible. It makes up for the difference with a tablet-thin design that is <b>15% thinner</b> than other 330s on the market.</p>
      <p>The Lenovo Ideapad 330s is your gateway to productivity. It features the fastest boot-up imaginable, thanks to the <b>Intel Optane Memory</b> chip, which stores your most commonly used files and programs for the fastest-possible retrieval. You won't have to mess with endless external hard drives, either, as the Lenovo Ideapad 330s comes equipped with a <b>1TB HDD</b>.</p>
      <p>All of this can be yours for only<b> $349</b>, a <b>$150 savings</b> from the <b>$620.99 list price</b>.</p>

Completing the ensemble, however, is an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1660Ti graphics card — which should be powerful enough for most gaming and video editing performance.
