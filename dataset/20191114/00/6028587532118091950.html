      <p>AEW Dynamite featured the debut of Wardlow, who joined forces with MJF and laid out Cody after MJF teased joining The Inner Circle. In the night’s main event, the aforementioned Chris Jericho and Sammy Guevara came up short against SCU for the AEW World Tag Team Championships with Scorpio Sky shockingly pinning Jericho.</p>
      <p>Last week’s episode of AEW Dynamite drew 822,000 viewers. WWE NXT is hot on the heels of AEW Dynamite as WWE’s Wednesday night flagship drew 813,000.</p>

        <b>AEW Dynamite Results: Wednesday, November 13, 2019</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Jon Moxley def. Michael Nakazawa</b>
      </p>
      <p>Where in god’s name did Michael Nakazawa find a full bottle of baby oil in a locker room full of wrestlers?</p>
      <p>Now that Jon Moxley has defeated Michael Nakazawa, AEW would be wize to recreate the bromance he had with Shota Umino.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The Dark Order def. Jurassic Express</b>
      </p>
      <p>This crowd seemed committed to loving Marko Stunt, which isn’t always the case with the polarizing little guy.</p>
      <p>Luchasaurus’ short-term injury was a blessing in disguise, because he was a rising star before the injury, and after a little time away, he’s an even bigger star upon his return.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Darby Allin def. Shawn Spears and Peter Avalon</b>
      </p>
      <p>If Shawn Spears ever becomes AEW world champion I’ll donate $1,000 to my least-favorite charity.</p>
      <p>Darby Allin and Jon Moxley sounds like it’s going to be another garbage wrestling match. If this is the hill Moxley wants to die on, he’s a damned fool.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Nyla Rose def. Dani Jordan</b>
      </p>
      <p>The key to Nyla Rose not looking too green is to keep her matches under three minutes. Well done.</p>
      <p>Eventually, Awesome Kong will be able to make a wig out of all the different pieces of hair she is chopping, and it will look exactly like it belongs to Tekashi 6ix9ine.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Chris Jericho goes Face-to-Face with MJF</b>
      </p>
      <p>MJF’s level of heat can only be described as <a href="https://youtu.be/_-uvR1X7cm0?t=593">VinceMcMahon circa 1997.</a></p>
      <related>
        <a href="https://youtu.be/_-uvR1X7cm0?t=593"/>
      </related>
      <p>As much as these fans violently hated MJF, they all took a break from booing him after he mentioned “a little bit of the bubbly.”</p>
      <p>As big of a pop as “a little bit of the bubbly” received, it was nothing compared to the massive pop for Jericho’s Juventud Guerrera reference.</p>
      <p>The idea of MJF in the Inner Circle makes so much sense it bores the crap out of me. Thank goodness this does not appear to be the case.</p>
      <p>Jericho and MJF essentially <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lao92ha9u-o">cut this same promo.</a></p>
      <p>Wardlow choking Cody with a Burberry tie is the least-intimidating move that otherwise intimidating big-man could have made.</p>
      <p>
        <b>PAC def. Hangman Adam Page</b>
      </p>
      <p>Jim Ross compared PAC to the Dynamite Kid, which is technically a compliment in wrestling but it also translates to “slow the heck down, kid.”</p>
      <p>Chants of “Bastard [expletive]” were way funnier than the chants for “Cowboy [expletive].”</p>
      <p>If wins and losses truly do carry value in this company, a win by Hangman Adam Page would make him a No. 1 Contender in a rematch against Chris Jericho that nobody wants to see again.</p>
      <p>Some will come down on AEW for 50/50 booking here, but this is technically the rubber match.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Proud and Powerful Lay out The Young Bucks</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Young Bucks are going to keep being “good bosses” by doing jobs and letting others get over on them and by the time they’re ready to start winning they’ll realize they morphed into the East Hampton Polo Boys.</p>
      <p>The best part of an otherwise entertaining brawl was Orange Cassidy making a cameo in the men’s bathroom.</p>
      <p>
        <b>SCU def. Chris Jericho and Sammy Guevara—AEW World Tag Team Championships</b>
      </p>
      <p>It feels too early for Chris Jericho to be on the losing side of anything, even a tag team match.</p>
      <p>AEW is building up Jake Hager like he’s Brock Lesnar and I love it.</p>
