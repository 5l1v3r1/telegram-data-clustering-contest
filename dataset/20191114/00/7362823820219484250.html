      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/reba-mcentire">Reba McEntire</a> is stepping out for the CMAs red carpet, but this time, she's a single lady.</p>
      <p>McEntire, 64, was all smiles as she sparkled in a black long-sleeved gown with fuzzy cuffs. She is co-hosting the show along with Dolly Parton and Carrie Underwood.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/reba-mcentire-boyfriend-anthony-skeeter-lasuzzo-split">McEntire confirmed</a> that she and her boyfriend, Anthony "Skeeter" Lasuzzo, broke up earlier this year.</p>

      <p>“Skeeter and I broke up in May, so, unfortunately, we will not be spending that time together,” McEntire told the <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/reba-mcentire-skeeter-lasuzzo-split-after-2-years-together/">Us Weekly</a>. "We still talk and we’re friends, but just decided to go our separate ways."</p>
