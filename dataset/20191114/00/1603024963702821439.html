      <p>The company attributed the fall in revenue to the headwinds in commodity prices.</p>
      <p>The company saw a one-time deferred tax benefit of Rs 1,891 crore in the quarter.</p>
      <p>Consolidated EBITDA margin stood at 20.1 percent against 22.6 percent (YoY), while the company registered a one-time loss at Rs 422 crore against a one-time gain of Rs 320 crore (YoY).</p>
      <p>EBITDA of Rs 4,497 crore, down 15 percent YoY, is primarily due to lower commodity prices, the company said.</p>
      <p>The company claimed its balance sheet improved during the September quarter.</p>
      <p>"Gross debt reduced by Rs 3,279 crore, in line of our continued focus on deleveraging and net debt reduced by Rs 8,322 crores in Q2FY2020. Net Debt/EBITDA at 0.9 times is lowest among Indian peers," Vedanta said.</p>
      <p>In the Zinc India segment, ore production rose by 3 percent YoY at 3.6 million tons with strong growth at Rampura Agucha and Zawar Mines, the company said. In the Zinc international segment, Gamsberg production stood at 24kt in Q2 and the ramp-up is in progress.</p>
      <p>Alumina production of 410kt is up 18 percent YoY and hot metal cost at $1,852/ton is lower by 10 percent YoY.</p>
      <p>Vedanta emerged as the highest bidder for Jamkhani coal block in Odisha, the company said.</p>
      <p>"We are at an exciting transition that will see the company accelerate in the expansion of its reserves and resource base over coming quarters. As we look forward to the year, we have in place the building blocks to enhance our performance in the three key businesses,” said Srinivasan Venkatakrishnan, Chief Executive Officer, Vedanta.<a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/promos/pro.php">Get access to India's fastest growing financial subscriptions service Moneycontrol Pro for as little as Rs 599 for first year.
