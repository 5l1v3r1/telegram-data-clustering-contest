      <p>THE DALLES, Ore. (AP) - Authorities say two people and a dog were found dead in a camper trailer outside The Dalles and that carbon monoxide poisoning may have been a factor in their deaths.</p>
      <p>Wasco County Sheriff’s detective Sgt. Jeff Hall says Yamhill County authorities on Tuesday requested help to find 47-year-old Deon Louise Patterson and 48-year-old Brian Thomas Paulsen who had been reported missing by family members.</p>
      <p>Hall says deputies went to an area outside The Dalles where Patterson was known to camp and found Paulsen’s pickup and camper trailer on a property near a cabin.</p>
