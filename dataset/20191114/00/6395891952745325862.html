      <p><b>JERUSALEMÂ (AP)</b> - The latest on the new escalation between Israel and Gaza (all times local):</p>
      <p>2:10 a.m.</p>
      <p>Palestinians say a new Israeli airstrike has killed five people from a single family in central Gaza Strip.</p>
      <p>Hamas' al-Aqsa Radio reported early Thursday that the dead include parents and their children.</p>
      <p>Witnesses in Deir al-Balah town say they heard two explosions followed by the sound of ambulance sirens.</p>
      <p>The Palestinian Red Crescent Society says crews are still searching the area.</p>
      <p>The latest incident puts the death toll at 31 for Palestinians killed in the worst surge of violence between Israel and Gaza militants in a month. It began when Israel killed a senior Islamic Jihad commander in an airstrike at his house early Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Among the dead are 16 militants, a woman and three minors. Ages of those killed in the latest strike are yet to be announced.</p>
      <p>___</p>
      <p>11 p.m.</p>
      <p>The head of the Islamic Jihad says the Palestinian militant group is willing to agree to a cease-fire if Israel accepts certain "conditions."</p>
      <p>Ziad al-Nakhalah told Lebanese Al-Mayadeen TV Wednesday that Egypt was brokering truce talks to end the worst round of fighting between Israel and Gaza militants in months.</p>
      <p>He specified three conditions, foremost a commitment by Israel to stop targeted killing of Palestinian leaders and senior militants.</p>
      <p>Israel killed a senior Islamic Jihad commander in an airstrike on his Gaza City home on Tuesday, sparking retaliatory rocket fire from Gaza and Israeli airstrikes have killed 26 Palestinians, including 16 militants.</p>
      <p>Al-Nakhalah also demanded Israel stop shooting Palestinians at weekly protests along Gaza's frontier, and honor the indirect understandings with Gaza's Hamas rulers to ease the territory's economic hardships.</p>
      <p>___</p>
      <p>4:35 p.m.</p>
      <p>The U.N. Mideast envoy says negotiators are "working to urgently de-escalate" fighting between Israel and Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip.</p>
      <p>Nickolay Mladenov said in a statement Wednesday during a trip to Cairo that he was "very concerned about the ongoing and serious escalation" of hostilities.</p>
      <p>Mladenov was to meet with Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi as part of efforts to broker a ceasefire.</p>
      <p>The heaviest round of fighting in months was triggered early Tuesday by Israel's targeted killing of a senior Islamic Jihad commander in Gaza.</p>
      <p>Israel's military says Islamic Jihad has since fired 250 rockets from Gaza into Israel.</p>
      <p>The death toll from Israeli airstrikes in Gaza has risen to 23 Palestinians, including a 7-year-old boy and two other minors.</p>
      <p>The U.N. diplomat condemned the Islamic militant group's attacks as "absolutely unacceptable."</p>
      <p>___</p>
      <p>12:35 p.m.</p>
      <p>Egyptian officials say U.N. Mideast envoy has arrived in Cairo in efforts to deescalate the worst escalation between Israel and Gaza militants in recent months.</p>
      <p>The officials say that Nickolay Mladenov landed on Wednesday from Tel Aviv and is scheduled to meet President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi.</p>
      <p>The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media.</p>
      <p>Egypt has stepped up communication with Israel and the militants in Gaza, and has "opened channels" with the U.S. and the European Union. Cairo often acts as a mediator between Israel and Gaza militants, and brokered a cease-fire deal in May.</p>
      <p>The latest bout of violence started after a pre-dawn Israeli airstrike in Gaza killed a senior Islamic Jihad commander on Tuesday. The militants in Gaza responded with barrages of rockets fired into Israel.</p>

      <p>___</p>
      <p>11:55 a.m.</p>
      <p>Gaza's Health Ministry says two more Palestinians have been killed by ongoing Israeli airstrikes, bringing the death toll in the escalation over the past two days to 18.</p>
      <p>Among the dead are 11 confirmed Islamic Jihad militants, including Bahaa Abu el-Atta, a senior Islamic Jihad commander whose killing in a pre-dawn airstrike at his Gaza City home on Tuesday sparked the new round violence.</p>
      <p>Among the latest casualties were a father and two sons whose identities remain unclear. Mobile video shows they were hit while travelling on a motorbike.</p>
      <p>The Israeli military says more than 250 rockets have been fired since Tuesday in the heaviest round of fighting in months. Gaza's Hamas leaders have stayed out of the fray.</p>
      <p>___</p>
      <p>11:25 a.m.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel is prepared to keep pounding Islamic Jihad militants in Gaza as long as rocket fire continues.</p>
      <p>Netanyahu said on Wednesday at the start of a special Cabinet meeting that the Iranian-backed militant groups better internalize Israel's determination before it is too late for them.</p>
      <p>Netanyahu says militants have a choice: "Either stop these attacks or absorb more and more blows."</p>
      <p>Israeli airstrikes have killed 16 Palestinians since Tuesday, nearly all Islamic Jihad militants.</p>
      <p>The Israeli military says more than 250 rockets have been fired at Israeli communities since the violence erupted following an Israeli airstrike that killed a senior Islamic Jihad commander accused of being the mastermind of attacks. It marks the heaviest round of fighting in months.</p>
      <p>___</p>
      <p>10:20 a.m.</p>
      <p>Israel's new defense minister says the country will not hesitate to target more Gaza militants.</p>
      <p>Naftali Bennett's comments on Wednesday were his first as Israel's new defense minister.</p>
      <p>He says Israel is sending a clear message to its enemies: "Whoever plans to hard us during the day, will never be safe to make it through the night."</p>
      <p>The message comes a day after a pre-dawn strike killed a senior Islamic Jihad commander in Gaza and triggered hundreds of rockets fired toward Israel, the heaviest fighting in months between Israel and the Iranian-backed militant group that's even more hard-line than Gaza's Hamas rulers.</p>
      <p>Bennett took office on Tuesday to fortify Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's political base. Bennett has long advocated tougher action against Palestinian militants.</p>
      <p>___</p>
      <p>10:15 a.m.</p>
      <p>Gaza's Health Ministry says four more Palestinians have been killed in Israeli airstrikes across the coastal enclave.</p>
      <p>The latest killings raised on Wednesday the overall death toll to 16, most of them militants.</p>
      <p>Ten Palestinians were killed in Gaza when the latest round of violence erupted early on Tuesday after an Israeli airstrike hut the home of a senior Islamic Jihad commander, killing him alongside his wife.</p>
      <p>The ministry also says 50 Palestinians have been wounded since Tuesday.</p>
      <p>___</p>
      <p>9:05 a.m.</p>
      <p>Gaza officials say new Israel airstrikes have killed two militants, raising the death toll to 12 since the latest escalation erupted.</p>
      <p>The Islamic Jihad says two of its fighters were targeted Wednesday, as rocket fire into Israel resumed along with Israeli retaliation after a brief overnight lull. Nearly all the casualties were Islamic Jihad members.</p>
      <p>The military says some 220 rockets have been fired since Tuesday, following an Israel strike that killed a senior Islamic Jihad commander.</p>
      <p>It's the heaviest fighting in months between Israel and the Iranian-backed militant group that's even more hard-line than Gaza's Hamas rulers.</p>
      <p>But Hamas has yet to join the fray, a possible sign the fighting could be brief. With Gaza's economy in tatters, Hamas appears to have little desire for another round of fighting.</p>
