      <h1>Watch Protestors Kill a Drone Using Hundreds of Laser Pointers</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T00:00:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Dan Robitzski</a></address>
      <h3>Pull!</h3>
      <p>In response to rising public transit costs, Chileans have taken to the streets in ongoing protests that have now evolved to encompass broader concerns about inequality — and they’re using high-tech tricks to push police back.</p>
      <p>Particularly, a police drone was disabled and fell to the ground after hundreds of protestors aimed their laser pointers at it, <a href="https://www.nextgov.com/emerging-tech/2019/11/how-chilean-protesters-took-down-drone-standard-laser-pointers/161288/">according to <i>NextGov</i></a>. The impromptu light show, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nextfuckinglevel/comments/dvlvwr/chilean_protesters_take_down_a_police_drone_with/?sort=confidence">captured on video</a>, provides a poignant illustration of an on-going, futuristic arms race.</p>
      <h3>Blinding</h3>
      <p>The Chileans aren’t the first protestors to disable police tech with lasers: the Hong Kong protests used lasers to <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/hong-kong-protesters-lasers-facial-recognition">shut down surveillance cameras</a> equipped with facial recognition tech. Nor are they the first to use lasers to disable drones — it’s an increasingly-common <a href="https://futurism.com/military-mounting-laser-weapons-tanks">military technique</a>, though those lasers are more powerful.</p>
      <p>In this case, the lasers probably didn’t burn through the drone as a military laser cannon might. Rather, <i>NextGov </i>reports that the lasers likely blinded either a human pilot’s camera feed or interfered with the drone’s built-in altitude sensors and forced an emergency descent.</p>
      <h3>One-Off</h3>
      <p>Christopher Williams, the CEO of the military tech contractor Citadel Defense Company, pushes back against the idea that laser pointers will become a common anti-surveillance tool.</p>
      <p>“There are many other technologies that are less disruptive that provide a superior, more scalable, more reliable and more cost-effective countermeasure,” he told <i>NextGov</i>.</p>
      <p>However, it’s not clear which of those technologies could become as ubiquitous for protestors on the street as a consumer laser pointer.</p>
