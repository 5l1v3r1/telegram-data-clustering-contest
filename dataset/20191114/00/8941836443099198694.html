      <p>PHOENIX (AP) - A doctor who treated an incapacitated woman who was raped and later gave birth at a Phoenix long-term care facility can no longer practice medicine.</p>
      <p>Arizona Medical Board records show Dr. Phillip Gear agreed last week to a consent order to surrender his license and not contest the matter in court.</p>
      <p>Gear was the victim’s physician on and off at Hacienda HealthCare from 1992, when she was 3 years old, until September 2018.</p>
