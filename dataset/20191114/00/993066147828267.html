      <p>A test pilot is set to soar alongside Brighton Pier on Thursday in hot pursuit of a new world record.</p>
      <p>“Iron Man” Richard Browning will attempt to zoom past the world record for fastest speed in a body-controlled, jet engine powered suit – a record he set himself in 2017.</p>
      <p>Not content with the blistering 32.02mph record he set at Lagoona Park in Reading, Mr Browning hopes to double his speed to show how the suit has developed since then.</p>
      <p>Mr Browning is the founder and chief test pilot of Gravity Industries, which designs, builds and flies jet suits.</p>
      <p>His latest attempt will be overseen by Guinness World Records editor in chief Craig Glenday, who will be able to verify if it’s a success.</p>
      <p>The attempt forms part of the Guinness World Records’ Spirit of Adventure theme, which celebrates adventurers and boundary pushers from around the world.</p>
