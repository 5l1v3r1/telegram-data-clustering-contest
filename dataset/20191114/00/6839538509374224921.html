      <p>A man has been charged over his alleged involvement in suspected thoroughbred horse doping in Queensland.</p>
      <p>The state police force's Racing Crime Squad charged the 25-year-old Toowoomba man with aggravated fraud, alleging he bought and administered supplements.</p>
      <p>His arrest is part of an ongoing probe into the administration of unregulated performance enhancing supplements designed to avoid detection by racing officials.</p>
      <p>The man is expected to appear in the Toowoomba Magistrates Court on December 2.</p>
      <p>A police operation into suspected horse doping has been running for more than a year, with three men charged with fraud in June.</p>
      <p>Police alleged then that the men had dishonestly benefited financially from thoroughbred race winnings.</p>
