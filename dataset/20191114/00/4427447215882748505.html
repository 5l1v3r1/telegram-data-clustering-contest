      <p>The Taipei Ethereum Meetup recently hosted <a href="http://crosslink.taipei/">Crosslink Taiwan 2019</a>. It was a wonderful event and a perfect opportunity for the Ethereum Foundation‚Äôs <a href="https://ecosystem.support/">Ecosystem Support Program</a> (ESP) to provide a <a href="https://notes.ethereum.org/@tw/grants">Taiwan-specific wave</a> of grants! The recipients are as follows.</p>
      <h3>üçç Group 1: Ethereum-based Technical Projects: USD$5,000 awarded to each project</h3>
      <ul>

      <h3>üçç Group 2: Ethereum-related Education Programs or Research Groups: USD$2,000 worth of ETH awarded to each project</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Ironman-Blockchain: New <a href="https://ithelp.ithome.com.tw/users/20092025/ironman/2109">Web3.js</a> and <a href="https://ithelp.ithome.com.tw/users/20092025/ironman/1759">Solidity</a> tutorials for 30 consecutive days!</li>
        <li><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/16V3HBwE78-vOex58P8s59TMxifhQi85_-whUd1ACd40/edit">Open teaching materials</a>: Open sourcing the materials for an Ethereum DApp Development course at National Chengchi University (NCCU).</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>üçç Free Devcon Ticket Award</h3>
      <p>This award was designed to recognize long-term contributions made by local community members. <a href="https://medium.com/@juinc">Juin Chiu</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/@kimiwu">Kimi Wu</a> have interpreted and translated numerous hard research ideas from English to Mandarin, helping greatly with reducing language barriers and accelerating the spread of Ethereum knowledge. We were delighted to host Juin and Kimi at Devcon in Osaka and to see both of them again in Taipei shortly thereafter.</p>
      <h3>What‚Äôs Next?</h3>
      <p>One of Ethereum‚Äôs superpowers is the independent flourishing that occurs throughout its vast and vibrant ecosystem. Countless local Ethereum communities around the world are a big part of why Ethereum feels simultaneously global and personal for so many people.</p>
      <p>Accordingly, the EF is continuously experimenting with ways to support communities around the world. We‚Äôre excited to apply what we‚Äôve learned with our recent Korea, Japan, and now Taiwan focused grants programs in order to expand this concept even further.</p>
      <p>Thank you to all of the community contributors who help make blockchain knowledge more accessible, thereby facilitating innovation, Ethereum adoption, and sharing Ethereum‚Äôs spirit around the world!</p>
