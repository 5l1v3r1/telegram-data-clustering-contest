      <p>PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) — Pakistani police say gunmen opened fire on a police vehicle, killing a senior counter-terrorism officer and wounding his driver and a passer-by before fleeing the scene.</p>
      <p>Police chief Zahur Babar Afridi in northwestern city of Peshawar says deputy superintendent of police, Ghani Khan, was killed in Thursday’s attack, which occurred on the city outskirts.</p>
      <p>No one immediately claimed responsibility and the motive behind the attack was unclear. However, the slain officer had led several raids on militant hideouts in recent years.</p>
      <p>Peshawar is the provincial capital in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, which borders Afghanistan, and which has witnessed dozens of militant attacks in recent years, most claimed by the Pakistani Taliban.</p>
