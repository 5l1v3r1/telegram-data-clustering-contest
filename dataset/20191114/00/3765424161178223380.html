      <p>POLICE have dismissed as false, social media reports claiming that they intercepted wads of new bank notes linked to Media, Information and Broadcasting Services Deputy Minister, Energy Mutodi.</p>
      <p>The social media reports further falsley stated that police had addressed a Press conference announcing the arrest of some youths and recovery of new notes from a Toyota Wish vehicle in Harare.</p>
      <p>National police spokesperson Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi denied ever investigating Deputy Minister Mutodi over the said case and arresting people with a Toyota Wish vehicle.</p>
      <p>“The Zimbabwe Republic Police wishes to categorically dismiss social media posts that they held a Press conference on the arrest of occupants of a Toyota Wish vehicle with money allegedly being linked to Honourable Mutodi or some political party youths.</p>
      <p>“Police did not hold such a Press conference as falsely depicted on social media and any other statement being attributed to the police, is totally false.</p>
      <p>“If at all there was such an arrest, it would be communicated through the normal channels and not through ghost media posts,” reads the statement.</p>
      <p>Asst Comm Nyathi said the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) and the police were now investigating the “mischievous” posts which were believed to be part of a campaign to tarnish the Government of Zimbabwe.</p>
