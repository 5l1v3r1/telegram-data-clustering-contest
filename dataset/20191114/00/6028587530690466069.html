      <p>Lego, the world’s number one toy maker, ahead of rivals Mattel and Hasbro is back on an upswing after a rough 18 months. The privately held toy maker reported <a href="http://kidscreen.com/2019/02/27/lego-revenue-increases-4-in-fiscal-2018/">$5.5 billion in fiscal 2018</a>, an increase of 4% over the previous year. Like every other toy manufacturer they were impacted by the Toys R Us bankruptcy. But their fortune’s have taken a turn since adding <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/lego-returns-to-growth-as-it-builds-on-china-expansion-11551259001">20,000 retailers</a> to its US distribution network, including Kohl’s, Michaels, and Dollar General.Today’s Lego brand bears little resemblance to the simple 5-color block set that most of us boomers and Xers grew up with. Lego is selling over 70 billion pieces a year in over 130 countries and now includes over 3,400 different shapes and 60-plus colors. The breath of the company’s focus runs from STEM to Ninjas, cars to coding, real life heroes to robots for kids.</p>
      <p>Lego’s product licensing agreements run the gamut from Jurassic world to Powderpuff Girls, Minecraft to Star Wars, Speed Champions to Friends (yes, the TV series).  In fact the companies renowned <a href="https://www.brickartist.com/about-nathan-sawaya.html">“The Art of the Brick” artist Nathan Sawaya</a>, just completed a 700 square foot <a href="https://people.com/travel/friends-central-perk-lego-set-las-vegas/">replica of Central Perk, the Friends iconic coffee shop</a> to celebrate the series’ 25<sup>th</sup> anniversary. Warner Brothers commissioned the work which utilized just under one million bricks. It made its Las Vegas debut in October.</p>
      <p>During this holiday season of giving Lego is encouraging kids to share their unused Lego bricks with kids who are less fortunate through a pilot program called <a href="https://people.com/parents/lego-replay-kids-donate-unused-bricks-give-back-box/">Lego Replay</a>. The program accepts any previously used Lego bricks and donates them to children’s nonprofits in the United States. They encourage kids that wish to donate to put them into a cardboard box and visit <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/campaigns/replay">www.lego.com/replay</a> to print out a free UPS shipping label.</p>

      <p>This past weekend, my wife and I experienced, firsthand another Lego themed holiday promotion that captured both of our imaginations. Rosedale Shopping Center, a Twin Cities suburban shopping mall, was host to <a href="http://www.startribune.com/family-fun-lego-escape-room-at-rosedale/564612132/">the "first-of-its-kind" escape room, called Lego Create Your Escape.</a> The pop-up designed for children ages 6-12 had a short, weekend preview, before traveling to Los Angeles. The admission-free, approximately 500 square foot themed space challenges teams of four to cooperatively solve a series of clues in search of three Lego keys. Competitors are challenged on their knowledge of Lego <i>Star Wars</i>, Lego <i>Marvel Avengers</i>, Lego <i>Speed Champions</i> and <i>Minecraft</i>. Participants are given 15 minutes to solve clues and find the Lego keys.</p>

      <p>New York based <a href="https://setcreative.com/">Set Creative</a>, was the brainchild behind the interactive exhibit’s development. Set’s Lee Kociski was kind enough to allow my wife and I to partake during the “resetting” of the exhibit, even without age-appropriate accompaniment. We were both impressed by the interactive nature of the experience and the degree to which it was designed to be a collaborative experience for participants. The exhibit’s design includes a small “viewing room” giving parents the ability to view the activity. </p>
      <p>The relatively “soft marketing approach” taken by Lego in the overall theming was noteworthy. And, for a two-day pop-up experience, they spared no expense in creating a highly memorable discovery event that will create new memories around an already beloved brand. And it was all done without a single video touchscreen. </p>
