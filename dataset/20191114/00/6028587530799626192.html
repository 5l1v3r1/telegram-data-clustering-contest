      <p>For the sake of pace and stating the obvious, the New Orleans Pelicans have only two wins after ten games this season. In those two wins, the team had 77 (Denver Nuggets) and 75 (Charlotte Hornets) shot attempts. Those two wins are the only games the Pelicans attempted more than 30 free throws and shot above 50% from the field. In the eight losses, the Pelicans hoisted between 94 and 103 shots per game and shot only 15 free throws in the home loss to the Dallas Mavericks.</p>
      <p>This is not the start to the season Alvin Gentry imagined. David Griffin and the rejuvenated fanbase were expecting more going on media day quotes and season ticket sales. However, for a team in no rush off the court, there seem to be too many losses littered with hurried shots early in the shot clock.</p>
      <p>It’s early in the season’s shot clock but the numbers are showing a team being forced to run when it would rather play at a slow rumble with a quick-strike capability. The same description could fit Zion Williamson’s play once he returns. The Pelicans are third in pace of play, sitting fifth in points scored per game (117.0). They excel on the break (3rd) like most other Gentry-coached squads. That fifteen percent of the offense is running fine, it is the other 85% that is leading to these close losses that are crippling such a promising season.</p>
      <p>No need mentioning the injury report. Zion is still out of action until December and everyone is well aware he will be eased into minutes to start his rookie season. Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram and Jrue Holiday have all missed time. Josh Hart could be out several games after battling for a respectable home loss against the Houston Rockets.</p>
      <p>Too many times the Pelicans run into rushed shots that hurt the team’s field goal percentage (46%, 13th)) and leaves the team shorthanded on the ensuing break by the opposition. The rush to get up the court leads to too many turnovers (17.9 per game, 4th worst) and not enough players in position to grab rebounds (46 per game, 14th). Out of positions players commit fouls. The end results being giving up the most points per game (122.4) while fouling the most (25.2) in an effort to catch up.</p>
      <p>Gentry said at practice that the ‘freelance’ offense has “definately” caused a delay in the team being on the same page. Once the team starts seeing the simple plays their is believe things will start to come together.</p>
      <p>“Until you have a good feel for what we are doing...Some of the guys that have been here, that’s why E’Twaun looks a lot more comfortable, obviously it’s why Jrue looks more comfortable, and even Jahlil with the year that he has been here, he looks a lot more comfortable...We just got to understand the whole concept of passing and cutting and not standing, setting screens and using screens. That takes a little while but that’s not our problem.”</p>
      <p>Gentry has diagnosed the problem. A little T.L.C. is needed and the Pelicans will be just fine. Time and Labor will bring Chemistry. Still regarding the offense, Gentry is sticking to his guns.</p>
      <p>“(The offense) is not our problem. Our offense is okay. We were 6th last week as far as pace and everything but what doesn’t tell the true story is our offense has caused our defense a lot of angst too. We’ve just simply, by turning the ball over, increased points in the paint, fast break points, field goal percentage, all of those thing go up. It is pointed to your defense but as a coach and the way we look at it our offense has hurt our defense as much as anything by turning the ball over.”</p>
      <p>Though his career is built on being a player’s coach and his running style, this edition of the New Orleans Pelicans are young and looking for structure. The veterans are looking for a bit more routine. Those plays that are unstoppable if run correctly and are staples of almost every basketball game. Ball movement and cuts create space and mismatches to exploit if the situation is given the time to develop.</p>
      <p>Going by the eye test and <a href="https://www.nba.com/pelicans/video/teams/pelicans/2019/11/13/2883607/1573670258676">J.J. Redick’s comments after practice,</a> that 85% percent of the game has not been the team’s highest priority. When asked how freelance this offense was as compared to the rest of his career Redick immediately spurted out, “The most.”</p>
      <p>He followed with the retort of “You mean not drawing it up?” which was meant in jest. Redick explained the offense was meant to be “intentionally unpredictable...At times you’re just going out and playing. I think for us we can do a better job when there are, and we’ve talked about this as a team, when there are those set pieces. ATOs, SOBs, BOBs, after free throws, like that’s when we can really lock in on executing more of the set pieces.”</p>
      <p>When asked about giving up a bit of pace to get more ball security Gentry said, “You would have to but I don’t see us being that kind of team. I think we take away the advantages that we have like Brandon in the open floor and Jrue in the open floor. The easiest thing to scout in this league is if you are going to be a half court team and call a bunch of plays. Then I think you can gameplan for that easier. It no different than like if you are in football. If you got run-play options it different than a team you know is going to hand it off or going to do certain things. We want to be the team that is run-play option so you have got to guess what we are doing in those situations.</p>
      <p>The team can still play fast without leaving teammates guessing at the next move. Get the ball up the court quickly, of course. But if a good shot is not available kick the ball out and find the second option. There are 18 seconds still left on the shot clock to work with afterall. The Pelicans have played well going sideline to sideline with Ingram working the wings and Redick is finding his range. Running plays using the trailing players can still get the opposition out of sorts, leading to open shots later in the shot clock.</p>
      <p>With more threatening wing plays Holiday could find free lanes to the rim to dunk his way out of a slump before Thanksgiving. Holiday, sitting cold at 36.4% from the field, is having the worst shooting season of his career by far. He is close to a career-high mark for turnovers as well. If this season was to go only as far as Holiday carried the team, perhaps he needs to be given time to catch up to the play and find a rhythm.</p>
      <p>The Pelicans need more time to build the chemistry that leads to entertaining wins. Zion Williamson will solve many of the rebounding woes and will help the problems finishing at the rim. Let Williamson freelance all he wants once he returns but the rest of the team is looking for professional options to keep on the fringes of the playoff race.</p>
      <p>The clock is ticking towards Williamson’s return but also the point of bankruptcy in terms of playoff hopes. Williamson is not expected back until December. Should the team continue running into losses, there will be no need to rush him back on to the court. Any delay to his debut would dampen spirits further. At that point, the only area for the Pelicans to push the pace would be to start a coaching search for next season.</p>
      <p>Playing fast leads to playing straight forward basketball. Basic playground basketball with improvisation by great players is enough to carry most teams to a respectable record. Gentry’s career win-loss record shows as much. All teams want to play fast and have fun while winning. The return on investment for playing at a fast pace comes at a cost.</p>
      <p>Right now that balance is off and the return on investment is one of the worst records in the league.</p>
