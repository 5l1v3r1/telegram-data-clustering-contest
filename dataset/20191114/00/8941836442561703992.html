        <p>STREAKS, STATS AND NOTES - Eagles beat Patriots 41-33 in Super Bowl 52. Backup QB Nick Foles was MVP of game. … Win guarantees Patriots winning record for 19th consecutive season (2001-2019). That would be most consecutive winning seasons since 1970 merger and second most all-time behind only Dallas with 20 straight winning seasons from 1966 to 1985. … Since 2002, Patriots are 44-8 in regular-season games following a loss. … New England ranks at or near top of NFL in several defensive categories. Patriots are allowing fewest points (10.9) and yards (249.3) per game; rank first in interceptions (19), second in passing yards allowed (150.2) and fourth in sacks (32). … Patriots have also held teams to NFL-low 18.9% (20 of 106) on third down and lead league with plus-17 turnover margin through Week 10. …. QB Tom Brady has six TDs and no INTs (115.9 rating) in two career road games against Eagles. … WR Mohamed Sanu coming off season-high 10 catches for 81 yards in Week 9 loss at Baltimore. … S Devin McCourty is tied for league lead with five INTs. … LB Jamie Collins leads team with six sacks. … Eagles QB Carson Wentz makes first career start vs. Patriots. … Wentz has seven TDs and no INTs for 100 rating in four home games. Has TD pass in 12 consecutive games, second-longest active streak in NFL. … RB Jordan Howard has six rushing TDs in last seven games. … RB Miles Sanders is only rookie in 2019 with 300-plus yards rushing and 300-plus yards receiving. … TE Zach Ertz leads team with 527 yards receiving. Ertz caught go-ahead TD pass from Foles vs. Patriots in Super Bowl. … Eagles 2-1 after bye under coach Doug Pederson. … DE Brandon Graham has team-best six sacks, all coming in last five games. Graham had strip-sack on Brady to help seal Super Bowl win. … Fantasy tip: Sanu against a suspect secondary that Brady carved up for 505 yards in the Super Bowl is a good bet.</p>
