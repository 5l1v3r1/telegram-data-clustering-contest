      <h1>Detecting Water Before It’s Too Late</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T00:00:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://hackaday.com/author/dammitcoetzee/" target="_blank">Gerrit Coetzee</a></address>
      <p>[mcu_nerd] is like any engineer, which is why his problem of an occasionally leaky water heater sure looks like a <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/164512-water-alert">research project with no end in sight</a>. Sure there’s probably a commercial product out there that can be had for half the cost and a few clicks of the mouse, but what’s the point in actually solving the problem?</p>
      <p>His log starts with research into detecting <a href="https://hackaday.com/2014/11/08/adding-a-battery-gauge-to-a-project-with-zero-parts/">low battery voltages</a>. Then it was a quick exploration in designing low-power circuits. When the <a href="https://hackaday.com/2019/03/06/new-contest-flexible-pcbs/">Flexible PCB contest</a> came along, he realized that there was a chance to design a better electrode, and he ended up winning one of the vouchers; which is where he’s at now.</p>
      <p>It’s definitely a work in progress, and if anything it’s just a quick five minute read and an opportunity to commiserate with another wayward soul. We do like his clever use of a tealite candle tin as both the second electrode and case for his water detection circuit. There are also some KiCad files and code.</p>
