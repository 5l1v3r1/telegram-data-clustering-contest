      <h1>Helen Mirren, Ian McKellen relish roles in ‘The Good Liar’</h1>

      <p>NEW YORK (AP) - Roles for older actors can fall into some predictable tropes, but <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/helen-mirren/">Helen Mirren</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ian-mckellen/">Ian McKellen</a> say their new film, “The Good Liar,” let them brush aside cliches and even their characters’ mortality for a good cat-and-mouse thriller.</p>
      <p>“Elderly characters are sort of there to be the lovely old grandfather or granddad that the kids go and visit,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/helen-mirren/">Mirren</a> said. “As you get older and you realize, ‘You know what? I still have agency in my life. Things are still happening in my life. It doesn’t all stop when you’re 50.”</p>
      <p>The film, which opens in theaters Friday, brings <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/helen-mirren/">Mirren</a>, 74, and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ian-mckellen/">McKellen</a>, 80, together on the big screen for the first time.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ian-mckellen/">McKellen</a> plays Roy, a man who has spent his life swindling others and sets his sights on <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/helen-mirren/">Mirren</a>’s character, a lonely widow named Betty. Roy is hoping to cash in on Betty’s life savings.</p>
      <p>While Betty’s grandson, played by Russell Tovey, senses danger in his mother’s new suitor, the film’s focus stays squarely on Betty and Roy.</p>

      <p>“This film could not happen unless these people were the age they were at,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ian-mckellen/">McKellen</a> said.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ian-mckellen/">McKellen</a> is keenly aware that audiences may balk at seeing a film with two older leads in it, but there are advantages.</p>
      <p>“Although my heart sinks when I go, ‘Oh, do I have to go see a film with two old actors in it.’ What you do get … on the whole is pretty good acting because they’ve been at it and they know what they’re up to,” he said.</p>
      <p>“There is nothing about mortality in this movie and that I love,” director Bill Condon said. “Putting them into a very contemporary thriller, it’s a good reminder of the fact that people should get to do everything.”</p>

        <p>Condon said he’d seen <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/helen-mirren/">Mirren</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ian-mckellen/">McKellen</a> act together on Broadway, so he knew what to expect.</p>
        <p>“I knew they were great together, but it is - well, it’s like what we always complain about, right? The paucity of parts for people of a certain age,” Condon said. “They should go on and do four movies now, and I hope they do because they have an incredible kind of rapport.”</p>
        <p>Both <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/helen-mirren/">Mirren</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ian-mckellen/">McKellen</a> have some blockbuster projects on the horizon. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ian-mckellen/">McKellen</a> appears in Tom Hooper’s “Cats” adaptation, and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/helen-mirren/">Mirren</a> is set to appear in the ninth installment of the “Fast and Furious” franchise in 2020.</p>
        <p>This story has been corrected to show that Russell Tovey plays the grandson.</p>
