      <h1>‘Sonic The Hedgehog’ Creator Still Isn’t A Fan Of Paramount’s Re-Redesign</h1>

      <p><b>90s video game icon</b> <i>Sonic the Hedgehog</i> has been under the limelight in the past year, albeit not for the best reasons. <br/><b>Paramount Pictures thought</b> it was a good idea to “fix” the fan favorite by not only giving it a film, but also overhauling his appearance with <a href="https://designtaxi.com/news/404512/Sonic-The-Hedgehog-s-Horrifying-Human-Like-Teeth-Leave-The-Internet-Traumatized/">humanlike teeth</a>, <a href="https://designtaxi.com/news/403754/Sonic-The-Hedgehog-s-Live-Action-Face-Gets-Leaked-By-Branding-Agency-And-Well/">wide-set eyes</a>, a <a href="https://designtaxi.com/news/402886/Sonic-The-Hedgehog-Plays-Along-With-Trolls-Tweets-Horrifyingly-Swole-Photo/">freakishly swole</a> body, and white hands instead of gloves.</p>

      <p><b>Fans were critical</b> about the extreme changes, but perhaps <a href="https://designtaxi.com/news/403771/Sonic-The-Hedgehog-s-Maker-Isn-t-A-Fan-Of-The-Live-Action-Character-Design/">not as much</a> as Yuji Naka, the originator of <i>Sonic the Hedgehog</i> franchise. In March, Naka commented that the redesigned character’s “head, body and stomach” were not “balanced.” <br/><b>The global backlash</b> drove Paramount Pictures to return to the drawing board, pushing the film’s November 2019 release date to February 2020 despite all this talk about going fast. <br/><b>This week,</b> the studio emerged with a <a href="https://designtaxi.com/news/407324/Sonic-The-Hedgehog-Gets-A-Glow-Up-And-The-Internet-Is-Turning-It-Into-A-Meme/">re-redesign</a> closer to Sonic’s original appearance this week, and the glow-up has been met with more positive reactions.</p>

      <p><b>However, while Naka agrees</b> it’s an improved effort, he still thinks Sonic 3.0 looks a little off. Taking to Twitter, Naka <a href="https://twitter.com/nakayuji/status/1194242281508753408?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">wrote</a> that he thought the new character design was “more Sonic-like,” now that his white hands have been replaced with gloves. Unfortunately, “his eyes are still not connected.” <br/><b>“I feel uncomfortable</b> [about that],” remarked the <i>Sonic</i> creator. “But I’m looking forward to seeing the movie.” <br/><b>While he clearly</b> wasn’t into the previous design, Naka expressed that he wished Paramount Pictures had kept the marketing materials on its social media channels instead of deleting them altogether as if they “never existed.” <br/><b>Not to worry,</b> the failed iteration is still all over the internet, so there’s no need to feel too disappointed about that. <br/><b>Interestingly, one fan</b> also spotted that Sonic’s sneaker brand has been swapped from Nike to Puma.</p>
