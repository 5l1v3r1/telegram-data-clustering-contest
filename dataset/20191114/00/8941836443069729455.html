      <h1>Review: FKA twigs outdoes herself on 2nd album ‘MAGDALENE’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T00:00:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">MELANIE J. SIMS</a></address>
      <p>FKA twigs, “MAGDALENE” (Young Turks)</p>
      <p>FKA twigs’ latest album, “<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mary-magdalene/">MAGDALENE</a>,” is not about the ups and downs of love. No, the 9-track set finds twigs solidly in the down-and-out throes of heartache. And the pain is beautiful.</p>
      <p>The album was written and produced by twigs, with contributions from Skrillex, Benny Blanco, Jack Antonoff and more. Fans who’ve waited long for twigs’ follow-up to her 2014 debut, “LP1,” will be happy to find that artistically, the singer just might be at her best. She is certainly more vocally and emotionally vulnerable than ever before.</p>
      <p>That’s especially true on beautifully gut-wrenching tracks like “mirrored heart,” with its clash of metal and delicate keys. “Did you want me all?/ No, not for life/ Did you truly see me?/No not this time,” she sings.</p>
      <p>She turns the hurt outward on the headnod-worthy “fallen alien,” co-produced by electronic music artist Nicolas Jaar. And twigs’ voice rings out like a morning prayer on the enchanting “thousand eyes.”</p>

      <p>Named for the oft-misunderstood biblical figure <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mary-magdalene/">Mary Magdalene</a>, twigs weaves her album with mentions of the ancient woman. “I’m fever for the fire/True as <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mary-magdalene/">Mary Magdalene</a>/Creature of desire/Come just a little bit closer to me/Step just a little bit closer to me/I can lift you higher,” she sings on “mary magdalene.”</p>

        <p>Through her lyrics and sounds, twigs summons the spiritual and the sensual, and the result of her dabbling is sometimes cryptic, but always intriguing. Most importantly, it sounds amazing.</p>
