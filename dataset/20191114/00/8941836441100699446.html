      <p>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) - The Tennessee State Museum is collecting stories of cultural identity, immigration and migration from the public.</p>
      <p>The project called Your Story, Our Story uses everyday objects as an entry point for these personal stories. Members of the public can add their own stories and read the stories of others on the Tennessee State Museum’s website under the “stories” tab.</p>
      <p>Because the museum is currently showcasing an exhibit on Tennessee food, it is especially encouraging visitors to add images and stories of recipes, cookware, dinnerware and ingredients that carry meaning in their families.</p>

        <p>Your Story, Our Story is an initiative of the Tenement Museum in New York City and partners across the U.S. that include museums, colleges, schools, libraries, and community groups.</p>
