      <p>The New York art gallerist <a href="https://www.jamescohan.com/">James Cohan</a> recently celebrated his 20<sup>th</sup> anniversary.With two concurring exhibitions that recently opened at the gallery's two locations, for a two-part group show called <a href="https://www.jamescohan.com/exhibitions/james-cohan-twenty-years">James Cohan: Twenty Years</a>, which features new, recent and historical works from the gallery’s roster of artists.</p>
      <p>On view are works by Bill Viola, wall-works by Beatriz Milhazes, Simon Evans and Fred Tomaselli, as well as sculptures by Kathy Butterly.</p>
      <p>James Cohan gallery first opened in 1999 in a space on West 57<sup>th</sup> Street, featuring the early works of London-based performance duo, Gilbert &amp; George, followed by exhibitions featuring Robert Smithson, Trenton Doyle Hancock and others.</p>
      <p>After the gallery moved to their Chelsea location in 2002, they showed works by Xu Zhen, Yinka Shonibare CBE, Spencer Finch and Elias Slime, among others.</p>

      <p>But art collecting seems to have always been on Cohan’s mind. “My first exposure to art dealing was when I was 10 years old, when my uncle Carl Solway would bring a Volkswagon van full of art to my family's home in Cleveland, Ohio from his gallery in Cincinnati,” recalls Cohan. “It was at that moment that I understood that there was a valued role to be played in between the artist and the collector.”</p>

      <p>The gallery opened their Shanghai location (which ran from 2008 to 2015) and their second New York location, which has been in the Lower East Side since 2015. This September, they recently opened their latest space in Tribeca, at 48 Walker Street, which is part of the thriving new <a href="https://www.tribecaartnight.com/home-1">Tribeca Arts District</a>.</p>

      <p>The James Cohan gallery has also added new artists to their roster like Mexican artist Teresa Margolles, Dominican artist Firelei Báez, and American painter Grace Weaver, who will all have upcoming exhibitions.</p>
      <p>Looking back, Cohan has spent roughly 38 years working in the art world. “I have worked with world-class artists to realize, and exhibit, important works that are now in museums and major collections all over the globe,” he said. “The last 20 years have allowed us to cultivate a program of artists who are motivated to delve into relevant and timely issues while also creating things of beauty.”</p>
