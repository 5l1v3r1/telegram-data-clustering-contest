        <b>New Jaguar Formula E driver James Calado says his return to single-seater racing for the first time in six years is "like learning to ride a bike".</b>
      </p>
      <p>Sometime Force India Formula 1 reserve Calado has raced in sportscars since leaving GP2 at the end of the 2013 season - winning the World Endurance Championship's GTE title with Ferrari in '17 and taking honours for that class at this year's Le Mans 24 Hours with the same team.</p>
      <p>He will return to single-seater action at next weekend's FE season opener in Riyadh - where he will also be making his category debut.</p>
      <p>Calado said that despite the long gap since his last GP2 race, single-seater competition is not something a driver forgets.</p>
      <p>"It's not strange - it's like learning to ride a bike," he said. "You sit in it and you don't forget.</p>
      <p>"What is strange is all the energy management, and the fact that it's an electric [powertrain in FE]. That's what's really bizarre.</p>
      <p>"And to get your head around why you need to be efficient is really key.</p>
      <p>"So that will be my weak point - it won't be my one-lap performance, it will be that.</p>
      <p>"But we've got days in the sim, we've got time [ahead of the first race].</p>

      <p>"I'm not expecting to go into Saudi and just win straight off. Got to be realistic - score points and just do as well as I can."</p>
      <p>Ahead of the Saudi Arabian race, Calado gained some FE racing experience via the two test 'races' the series held at its group pre-season test at Valencia last month.</p>
      <p>Calado said it was "kind of a different experience to when I remember single-seaters last", but added "it was good fun".</p>
      <p>"We had some issues in the second one, with the controls, so I had to box a lap early due to something [going] wrong," he continued.</p>
      <p>"Even so, the pace is good - the Jaguar looks strong.</p>
      <p>"[Team-mate Mitch Evans] was super quick in the last session [of the test], so we know the performance is there, which is great. Just got to take it step by step and keep pushing."</p>
      <p>Calado has confirmed he will miss the FE race at Sanya that clashes with the Sebring WEC event next March, as his deal with Ferrari takes priority.</p>
      <p>He called the situation "frustrating", before adding: "That's the way it is - I can't do anything about it."</p>
