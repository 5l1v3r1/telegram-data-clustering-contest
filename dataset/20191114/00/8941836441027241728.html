      <p>MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) - Five Vermont groups are sharing more than $1 million to use phosphorus recovery technologies as the state works to reduce algae-causing phosphorus runoff into Lake Champlain and other waterways.</p>
      <p>It’s part of the Vermont Phosphorus Innovation Challenge announced last year to generate creative solutions to the phosphorus pollution in Vermont.</p>
      <p>Officials estimate that about 38% of the phosphorus load in the lake comes from agricultural land.</p>
