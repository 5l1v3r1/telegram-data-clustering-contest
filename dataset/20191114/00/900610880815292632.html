      <p>Organised by Messe Berlin, one of the leading world trade fair companies, ITB India will be a three-day business-to-business travel trade show and convention. It will be held from April 15 to April 17, 2020, at Bombay Exhibition Centre in Mumbai. The event will cater to MICE, corporate and leisure travel sectors of the Indian and south Asian travel market. Exhibitors from every sector of the industry, including travel agencies and operators, business travel and MICE, travel technology, accommodation, and transport companies are all expected to attend<b>.</b></p>
      <p>Along with this, Messe Berlin has also announced a strategic partnership with a global corporate travel leader, the Association of Corporate Travel Executives (ACTE). The agreement inks a significant partnership to be the 2020 Corporate Travel Day Partner for ITB India, which will bring industry professionals from Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities in India and South Asia under one roof.</p>
      <p>Katrina Leung, managing director of Messe Berlin (Singapore), co-organiser of ITB India, says,<b> “</b>Given the success of two editions of the Corporate Travel Day at ITB Asia, it is only logical to join forces with ACTE for the inaugural ITB India as well. The partnership is the perfect pairing of two industry leaders sharing a common vision of drawing more corporate travel buyers to both India and southeast Asia. As one of the most important partners for ITB India in the corporate sector, ACTE, with its wide international representation from over 100 countries, will play a leading role in promoting our premiere event.”</p>
      <p>Commenting on this partnership, Leigh Bochicchio, executive director of ACTE “We are delighted to have concluded the agreement for ITB India 2020, and the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to continue partnership with ITB Asia from 2020 to 2022. At ACTE, we continue to lead global education, advocacy and initiatives to support impactful changes in safety and security, privacy, duty of care and Corporate Travel compliance, along with traveller productivity that supports global commerce. The expanded partnership in India and extended cooperation between ITB Asia and ACTE will undoubtedly foster another unprecedented horizon in our vision for global education in the corporate travel and MICE sectors.”</p>
