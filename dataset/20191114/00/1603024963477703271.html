      <p>SoftBank's latest round of funding in Paytm will take place on the condition that the company would go public within five years from the time of funding, The Economic Times <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/startups/newsbuzz/softbanks-paytm-top-up-to-come-with-riders/articleshow/72047970.cms">reported</a>.</p>
      <p>Sources told the paper that SoftBank Vision Fund (SVF) will reserve the right to sell its stake in Paytm to a rival company if the IPO does not take place within the stipulated time period.</p>

      <p>This development comes in the wake of the latest botched-up IPO plan of WeWork, which amounted to a loss of around $4.6 billion for SoftBank, the report said.</p>
      <p>Another source quoted in the report said that SoftBank has been taking more time in funding new ventures as they are carrying out greater due diligence.</p>
      <p>The latest round of funding, worth nearly $1 billion, might also see US asset manager T Rowe Price investing around $150 million to $200 million in the digital payments player<a href="http://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/computers-software-medium-small/one97communications/OC03"> One97 Communications</a>, which is the parent company running Paytm.</p>
      <p>The remainder of the $1 billion might come from existing investors of Paytm- SoftBank and Alibaba Group affiliate Ant Financial, the report added. This round of funding may push the value of the digital payment company to around $15 billion, according to several reports.</p>
      <p>Since early this year, Paytm has been trying to raise funds amid increased losses, with stiff competition from players like Google Pay and Walmart-owned PhonePe.  The company's last round of equity funding happened in 2018. At the time, Warren Buffett-led Berkshire Hathaway invested $356 million and potentially pushed its <a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/warren-buffett-backed-berkshire-hathaway-buys-stake-worth-rs-2500-crore-in-paytm-2887441.html">valuation</a> to $10 billion.<a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/promos/pro.php">Get access to India's fastest growing financial subscriptions service Moneycontrol Pro for as little as Rs 599 for first year.
