      <p>Nisha Dua is the co-founder and General Partner of BBG Ventures, an early stage consumer VC fund, and the founder of BUILT BY GIRLS, every future tech leader’s secret weapon a platform which prepares young women to step boldly into careers powered by technology. Prior to her time at BBGV, she was the General Manager of AOL’s Cambio and the Chief of Staff for the AOL Brand Group. I sat down with Nisha to discuss the personal drive behind her ventures, what makes a great founder, and how to navigate entrepreneurial uncertainties.</p>

      <p><b>Sanyin</b>: Fill in the following blank for us: If we really knew you, we would know that... </p>
      <p><b>Nisha</b>:<b> </b>You would know two things. First, inclusivity, equality, and fairness are my core values. Second, despite appearances, I’m not all head in the workplace. I’m a lot of heart. Bringing your heart and soul with you when you show up every day to work—and to life—is critical to leading a full life. </p>
      <hr/>
      <p><b>Sanyin</b>:<b> </b>I think the heart and soul are key parts of leadership and entrepreneurship, but we don’t hear about it very often. Walk us through your journey as an entrepreneur. How did you arrive where you are today, and how was “heart” part of that?</p>
      <p><b>Nisha</b>: I launched a platform called BUILT BY GIRLS, which connects young women in high school and college with young professionals in tech. The goal was twofold. First, we wanted to help young women break into a club that felt really inaccessible. Second, we wanted to help them build a network while arming them with practical skills they could take from the classroom to their careers.</p>
      <p>I saw a problem and wanted to solve it. When I was growing up, I had access to people ahead of me who had all these skills, and they shared their knowledge with me. That shared knowledge enabled me to take leaps in my career—those people had networks, and those networks facilitated leaps in my career. When I looked at the broader population, I realized that most people don’t have access to those things. Most people don’t have someone in their life who cracked into a big job at a tech company or startup. If you’re a young woman in Ohio whose parents run a 7-Eleven, you may never get access to those things. That felt unfair to me. </p>
      <p>It felt like something we could easily solve by leveraging the talent that was already out there. The question was simply:, “How do you bring these two parts of the population together in a highly scalable way?” That’s what led me to start BUILT BY GIRLS. </p>
      <p>A lot of that was about my heart and soul. I knew there were young, incredibly capable women out there, and that we have the capacity to rebuild the world we live in and build the world of tomorrow. It was a question of access to the right opportunities and the right people, and I wanted to put those opportunities in the hands of young women.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p><b>Sanyin</b>: I love that story because it reflects your own origin story and your recognition of this gap in access. Your own experience taught you the value of connection and so your platform is driven by this deep sense of purpose, which is about equity. But it’s just social impact to feel good about yourself. It leads to tangible value for society as a whole.</p>
      <p><b>Nisha</b>: Yes, your purpose and mission is critical. We should be building products and platforms that are best-in-class, but we should also be building things that have the capacity to change the current paradigm - for the better. </p>
      <p>When I describe BUILT BY GIRLS, a lot of people ask, “Is that a mentorship program?” But, actually, critically, it’s not. We don’t call the people on our platform mentors because we think mentorship is a slightly outdated word and a hard-to-sell concept. The question for us was, “How do provide the most opportunity—and highest quality opportunity—to the largest number of young women?” </p>
      <p>That’s where we set out to use technology to build a program that can scale. When you look at mentorship programs and the country and world, they’re actually very hard to meaningfully scale. But in the last 2 years, we’ve connected over 9000 young women and professionals in tech. And we’ve just started. We’re still a very young startup, but the three-monthly cohorts we’ve built are growing 50% cohort-on-cohort. The demand is high, and we’ve built a platform that enables quick growth while maintaining quality. Scaling is, I think, something that sometimes gets lost in the journey to purpose.</p>

      <hr/>
      <p><b>Sanyin</b>:<b> </b>What's the age group of the population you're serving?</p>
      <p><b>Nisha</b>:<b> </b>The girls on the platform are anywhere between 15 to 22 years old. The professionals on the platform are probably as young as 25 but go up to 40 years old. </p>
      <hr/>
      <p><b>Sanyin</b>:<b> </b>And I bet for the professionals on the platform who are serving as quote-unquote mentors—I know you use a different word than that—they're also getting a pulse on the next generation and insights as well. </p>
      <p><b>Nisha</b>: I think that’s right, and that’s part of the value proposition. The value proposition is twofold. One: I get to meet with the next generation and understand how they’re thinking about products. How are they thinking about a company I’m currently at? What are the insights I can learn from them to improve the work I’m doing today? When these people join my team, how should I be thinking about managing them in a different way? Young women can also start to learn how to best work with the generation above them.</p>
      <p>The second part of the value proposition is what we talked about earlier: heart and soul. So many of the people who joined the platform have said, “This is something I wish I’d had when I was their age.” We’re also seeing that it’s becoming more important for companies to enable their employees  to say, “I spent time helping someone else in a way that I needed when I was younger,” rather than just saying, “We donated to an organization.” We have Advisors on the platform from Uber, Amazon, Twitter, Spotify, Verizon—top tech companies because of this drive for individual citizenship.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p><b>Sanyin</b>:<b> </b>Along with BUILT BY GIRLS, the organization, there's also BBG Ventures, which you co-founded. Can you tell us more about that? </p>
      <p><b>Nisha</b>: BBG Ventures  is an early-stage venture fund that invests in consumer startups with at least one female founder. We launched in 2014 based on 3 data points. First, women are the dominant consumers. They drive or influence 85% of purchasing decisions. </p>
      <p>Second, women are the power users of most mobile, social and e-commerce platforms. They use Facebook more. They use Instagram more. They use Snapchat more. They use Pinterest more. They use their mobile phones more. They shop online more. They even use mobile gaming more.</p>
      <p>Third, women are the early adopters—especially young women. When you look at many early breakout successes—Snapchat, Prisma, Musically, and even Pokémon Go—all of the platforms had an early base of young women. </p>
      <p>So, we launched the fund because we felt that investing in founders who intuitively knew the end user would create a competitive advantage. And with the venture world still not focusing on female founders—only about 2.2% of funding goes to female-founded companies—we thought there was white space to take advantage of to  drive outsized returns.</p>
      <p>Since we launched the fund, we’ve invested in 63 companies across two funds in the last 4 or 5 years. The time after the 2016 election also revealed that women aren’t just the dominant consumers, the power users, the early adopters. They’re a transformational force in this nation. They’re community builders. They’re political disruptors. They’re social influencers. They’re brand builders. We’re seeing women as a dominant group in ways we’ve not seen before. </p>
      <hr/>
      <p><b>Sanyin</b>:<b> </b>This is a long-term play. You’re looking at the pipeline of talent with BUILT BY GIRLS and you’re investing in the long-term with BBG Ventures. But I want to make clear that this isn’t just about feeling good. Your venture was driven by concrete data. It’s backed by numbers.</p>
      <p><b>Nisha</b>: That’s exactly right. We don’t use words like “empower” when it comes to the fund. We know that female founders have advantages in building consumer companies, and that means they’ll drive great returns. The impact down the road is that many, many more unicorns or decacorns will be led by female founders. That’s a good thing for the world. It’s good for innovation. </p>
      <hr/>
      <p><b>Sanyin</b>: What makes a potential startup viable for BBG Ventures? What do you look for in a company?</p>
      <p><b>Nisha</b>:<b> </b>Like most people in VC, we are looking for a huge market opportunity. But more specifically, we’re looking for problems that need to be solved. There must be a significant pain point. We see a lot of founders who just want to build a startup. But the most successful founders have identified some pain point that’s critical to solve for the consumer. That’s where we get most excited. </p>
      <p>At the early stages, we look for founders who demonstrate high conviction and focus, but who also demonstrate a level of flexibility and self-awareness. The founder herself is critical. </p>
      <p>And what makes a great founder? The best founders are incredibly focused. They’re not distracted by side products. They focus on one thing and go after that. </p>
      <p>They have  conviction about the problems they’re solving. They’re relentless. They’re able to execute their ideas. They’re flexible, adaptable, and responsive to feedback.</p>
      <p>Great founders are curious. They’re lifelong learners. They’re always trying to improve themselves, and they’re okay with hiring people who are better than them. They can sell their ideas and their products. They’re great relationship builders and know that networking can build and scale their companies. They have comfort with discomfort.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p><b>Sanyin</b>: To that end, how do we manage discomfort? How do we thrive in the midst of uncertainty? </p>
      <p><b>Nisha</b>: I’d answer that in three parts. First, you have to have a purpose in what you’re doing. You have to know what problem you’re solving, and if it drives you. You have to have a bigger picture so that, even when you’re uncertain, you know what you’re working towards.</p>
      <p>Second, you need to ask yourself, “Does the thing you’re building give you energy? Does the very act of building give you energy?” If the answer is “yes,” then it is easier to get through those tough moments.</p>
      <p>And third, you need to know your framework—why you’re doing what you’re doing. Ultimately, managing discomfort isn’t just about building companies. It’s an approach to life. The way Buddhists and Hindus—I’m Hindu—describe one of life’s realities—that things come together, and things fall apart—can be applied to entrepreneurship. Things come together, and things fall apart. There’s no end point where you can finally say, “I made it. It’s perfect. I’m happy.” There’s always something better or something more. And there’s always going to be a challenge. The earlier in your life you can get comfortable with that, the easier it is to get unstuck when something goes wrong.</p>
      <p><b>Sanyin</b>: I always tell my students at Fuqua—at Duke—and coaching clients that “figuring it out” is only going to last for a second. Then you’ll have to figure it out all over again. That’s part of the stress, but it’s also part of the fun. Thank you so much for sharing your wisdom with us.</p>
