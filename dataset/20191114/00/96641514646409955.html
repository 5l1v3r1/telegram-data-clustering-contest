      <p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/BlackFriday/">Black Friday</a> is still a couple of weeks away but retailers are doing everything they can to get and keep your attention right now. For Walmart, that means <a href="https://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/2019/11/14/walmart-black-friday-deals-revealed-more-ways-to-save-starting-today">releasing its ad now</a> to tease Black Friday offers like a $129 Apple Watch Series 3, $99 Samsung Chromebook Series 3 or a 1080p 40-inch Roku Smart TV from its house brand onn. for $98.</p>
      <p>Deals you can jump on starting today include a 512GB 10.5-inch iPad Pro <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Apple-10-5-inch-iPad-Pro-Wi-Fi-512GB/55900709">for $599</a> -- the lowest price we've seen. This is the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/06/12/apple-ipad-pro-10-5-review/">2017-era second generation model</a>, so while it doesn't come with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/11/09/ipad-pro-2018-review/">newer features like FaceID, A12X Bionic CPU or a USB-C connector</a>, it still packs impressive power to multitask with Apple's new iPad OS, and at this price -- a comparable third-gen Pro costs <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-ipad/ipad-pro/11-inch-display-512gb-space-gray-wifi">$1,149</a> -- its performance is hard to beat. At the time we originally reviewed it, two problems were that it was expensive and iOS 11 wasn't out yet -- those have now been addressed.</p>
