      <h1>When Bitcoin? Shift From ‘Consumer’ to ‘Institutional’ Puts BTC at the Head of the Crypto Asset Class: Report</h1>

      <p>A new report from digital asset management firm CoinShares pulls data from several industry leaders to analyze the big crypto picture.</p>
      <p>The results show that over the past 10 years since the launch of Bitcoin, the market is transitioning from “consumer” to “institutional”, opening new segments with major players.</p>

      <p>The next evolutionary step for Bitcoin is expected to be “Bitcoin banking” with key services for clients – banking deposits, insurance, investment products, cross-border payments and sovereign currency. The timeline for this next phase is 2022 and beyond.</p>
      <p>For consumers, Bitcoin promises more financial inclusion.</p>
      <p>According to the report,</p>
      <p>
        <i>“Today, 3.8B people, or 50% of the world has access to the internet and 42% have access to a </i>
        <i>smart phone, and while many are participating in online communities, many users are still cut of </i>
        <i>from the global economy and financial access outside of the local areas where they reside.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>The digital reach for global payments won’t be driven by banks but by devices and social media platforms.</p>

      <p>Major tech firms, from Facebook to Samsung to Alibaba, are expected to usher in a more pervasive digital economy as millennials align their on-demand and on-the-go habits with their money.</p>

      <p>The expanding digital landscape is generating blockchain-based counterparts alongside traditional assets and legacy structures – with Bitcoin in the primary position.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“Comparatively, bitcoin has been volatile, but on an absolute basis, it’s outperformed every other asset class over a comparable time scale.”</i>

      <p>The report underscores the notion that crypto is still in its early days, still has a steep learning curve and still requires more time before its core concepts catch on and consumer traction takes off, generating new opportunities.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“The internet did not kill companies. It enabled new types of companies to grow and made existing ones more agile and efficient.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Bitcoin and open financial systems will not kill financial institutions. It will enable new types of companies to grow and make existing ones more resilient.”</i>
