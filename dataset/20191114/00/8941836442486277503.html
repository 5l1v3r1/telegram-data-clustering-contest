      <p>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) - The Latest on a Virginia doctor accused of performing unnecessary surgeries on his ob/gyn patients (all times local):</p>
      <p>10:45 a.m.</p>
      <p>A Virginia doctor accused of performing unnecessary surgical procedures on his patients has been ordered held without bail while he awaits trial.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/javaid-perwaiz/">Dr. Javaid Perwaiz</a> was charged last week with health care fraud after authorities said he performed unneeded procedures on many of his patients, including hysterectomies and tubal ligations.</p>
      <p>Magistrate Judge Robert Krask ordered <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/javaid-perwaiz/">Perwaiz</a> held without bail Thursday after a prosecutor said 173 women have come forward since his arrest to describe similar experiences. The judge called the allegations “deeply disturbing.”</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/javaid-perwaiz/">Perwaiz</a>’s attorney said he has received a flood of unsolicited emails from patients praising and supporting the doctor.</p>
      <p>The judge said that if the charges are proven, the doctor’s actions represent a “gross abuse of patient trust.”</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/javaid-perwaiz/">Dr. Javaid Perwaiz</a>, of Chesapeake, is due Thursday in U.S. District Court in Norfolk for a detention hearing.
