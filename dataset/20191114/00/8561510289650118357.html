      <h3>Dropping the Lander</h3>
      <p>China’s Mars lander just successfully completed its first public test: a spectacular drop from 230 feet onto a mountainous landscape north of Beijing. The lander hovered at first before slowly descending safely to the ground below.</p>
      <p>The stunt tested one of the most difficult parts of sending a spacecraft to the Red Planet: making a soft landing while avoiding obstacles. It’s a feat that only the United States has achieved so far.</p>
      <p>“[The simulation] is a critical milestone for the development of the Mars probe,” Wu Yanhua, vice administrator of the China National Space Administration, told reporters, as <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/14/asia/china-mars-lander-space-intl-hnk-scn/index.html">quoted by <i>CNN</i></a>.</p>
      <h3>Mars 2020</h3>
      <p>Both China and the U.S. are planning to launch uncrewed exploration missions to Mars next year. NASA has been <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/watch-nasa-builds-mars-2020-rover">working hard</a> on completing its Mars 2020 rover, which will hopefully collect rock samples and bring them back to Earth in 2021.</p>
      <p>The test is yet another sign that China is a force to be reckoned with when it comes to space exploration. Last winter, the country <a href="https://futurism.com/china-landed-probe-change4-far-side-moon">successfully landed</a> a rover on the far side of the Moon, <a href="https://futurism.com/chinas-lander-sprouted-tiny-cotton-plants-moon">becoming the first</a> to sprout plants on the lunar surface as well.</p>
      <p>China is also planning for a <a href="https://www.space.com/china-new-spacecraft-crewed-moon-missions.html">crewed mission</a> to the Moon in the 2030s. The China Academy of Space Technology <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/china-spacecraft-astronauts-moon">recently showed off</a> its next-generation spacecraft that could one day take Chinese astronauts to the Moon, thereby becoming only the second country after the U.S. to do so.</p>
