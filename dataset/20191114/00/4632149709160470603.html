      <p>The High Court on Tuesday expressed its displeasure at the Bruhat Bangalore Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) for failing to initiate the tree census in the city. <br/><br/>The civic agency was ordered in June this year by the Court to undertake the survey. <br/><br/>Despite giving sufficient time, the survey has not begun. <br/><br/>During the hearing of a petition in this regard on Wednesday, the court said it would have to initiate contempt of court proceedings against the Government and the BBMP for their failure to follow court orders.</p>
