      <p>Great Britain is in the middle of a knife-edge General Election with present Prime Minister Boris Johnson fighting his political life by promising to make Brexit happen and ensure the country leaves the European Union by January 31. So far in the election campaign, the two main political parties – Conservative and Labour – have both been promising a massive rise in public spending.While the Conservatives have promised more money for the country’s National Health Service and expansion of gigabit broadband, the Labour Party has announced a raft of nationalisations whereby the state will take vital services and utilities into public ownership by a massive issue of public bonds. Today the Labour Party also announced its intention to provide high-speed fibre broadband to all UK homes by 2030.</p>
      <p>The ambitious plan was announced by John McDonnell MP, the Labour Party’s shadow chancellor. The policy is estimated to cost around £20 billion. The Conservatives had already pledged spending £5 billion to help the broadband industry to roll out fibre gigabit broadband to every home by 2025.</p>
      <p>The plan was announced by Labour this evening an would give free and unlimited fibre broadband to every home and business in the country and the running costs of the network would be paid for by taxing multinational businesses that make the bulk of their revenues from the internet, companies such as Google, Apple, Amazon, and Netflix.</p>
      <p>Mr McDonnell told the BBC’s political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, that Labour would add an extra £15bn to the government's existing £5bn broadband strategy. “Everywhere I go they're saying [they have] either not got broadband at the speeds they need, holding our economy back, or it's actually impeding on people's social engagement,” he said. </p>
      <p>Currently, high-speed broadband costs for UK households start around £30 a month, depending on the speed of service and the amount of traffic used. To offer every household and business a free version of what they currently pay for is a big inducement for the electorate and has certain appeal for households already struggling to pay bills for utilities like electricity, gas and water.</p>
      <p>In order to carry out its plans, Labour says it will take BT’s Openreach, the company the currently builds and manages the UK’s main fibre network, into public ownership by issuing long-term government bonds to finance the purchase and the building of the network to every house in the UK.</p>

      <p>Quite what the effect of this policy will have on the UK’s competitive broadband market is difficult to say. It could certainly kill any further investment that’s already being put into the market by major players like Liberty Broadband. Why would consumers or businesses pay for a broadband service if they can get it from the government for free? Also, if Labour doesn’t end up leaving the European Union, should it win the General Election, it’s not at all clear if their plans would be legal under the EU’s directives on state aid, something which is strictly controlled and only allowed in certain circumstances for short periods of time.</p>

      <p>The new network would be called British Broadband and would be charged with running and maintaining the network at an estimated to cost £230m a year. Labour hasn’t ironed out all the details of how the tax on Internet giants would work, but said it would be based on a percentage of global profits and UK sales, raising potentially as much as £6bn a year. Mr McDonnell said that if other broadband providers did not want to give access to British Broadband, then they would also be taken into compulsory public ownership. He claimed the scheme would be beneficial for the environment because it would reduce the need for workers to commute while enabling people to move out of cities to more rural areas.</p>
      <p>Mr McDonnell said that ensuring fibre broadband was free to everyone would mean that people would be able to participate in society economically or socially, in a way that they had not been previously able to.</p>
