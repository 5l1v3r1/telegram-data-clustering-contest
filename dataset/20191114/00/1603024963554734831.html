      <p>Retail giant Walmart saw profits surge in the latest quarter on an explosion in online sales and a boost from Indian retailer Flipkart, according to results released Thursday.</p>
      <p>"The sales environment in the US continues to be positive, while internationally its softer and we're responding appropriately," Walmart chief Doug McMillon said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The world's largest retailer's net income jumped more than 92 per cent to nearly USD 3.3 billion in the three months ended October 31 compared to the same quarter a year earlier, the company reported.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Total revenue rose 2.5 per cent or USD 3.1 billion, to USD 128 billion.</p>
      <p>This resulted in adjusted earnings per share, a key US benchmark, of USD 1.16, well above the median estimate of USD 1.09 expected by analysts.</p>
      <p>The company now projects the full year results to be "up slightly" -- a modest improvement over its previous outlook.</p>
      <p>US ecommerce sales surged 41 percent, including a big jump in online grocery sales.</p>
      <p>US sales rose at Walmart and Sam's Club, despite some impact from reduced tobacco sales, and the company saw solid performance in China and at Walmex in Mexico.</p>
      <p>Walmart Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs said the company is "continuing to monitor the ongoing tariff discussions and are hopeful that an overarching long-term agreement can be reached."</p>
      <p>But sales in Britain were soft due to concerns over Brexit, while business in Chile has been impacted by civil unrest there forcing many stores to close.</p>
      <p>The chain marked the first anniversary of the acquisition of Flipkart, which boosted international sales.</p>
      <p>McMillon pointed to good customer traffic in US stores, but said the retailer needs to do a better job selling general merchandise online. "Looking ahead, we're prepared for a good holiday season. Our integrated offering with stores and eCommerce delivers value and convenience for our customers."<a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/promos/pro.php">Get access to India's fastest growing financial subscriptions service Moneycontrol Pro for as little as Rs 599 for first year.
