      <p>NEW DELHI: The department of telecom (DoT) on Wednesday shot off notices to financially crippled mobile operators, including <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Airtel">Bharti Airtel</a> and the joint venture Vodafone Idea, seeking recovery of nearly Rs 93,000-crore outstanding. That amount became due after the Supreme Court’s October 24 order re-stated the definition of gross revenues of the industry.</p>
      <p><a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/The-move">The move</a> by the ministry — which is seeking the payment within three months from passage of the SC order — comes as a surprise, given that a high-powered Committee of Secretaries (CoS) has been tasked with working out a solution to address the financial woes of the industry.</p>
      <p>“It is the responsibility of the licensees to pay the licence fee and other dues after carrying out their own assessment as prescribed in the licence agreements,” sources said, while quoting from DoT’s communication. The notice, issued by the director in the licensing finance policy wing, assumes significance as it had been sent after a clearance by DoT’s member (finance).</p>

      <p>The Supreme Court’s restatement of the revenues, after a nearly 15 years long legal <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/battle">battle</a> between DoT and industry players, has resulted in a massive licence fee and other dues on the mobile companies.</p>
      <p>Speaking on condition of anonymity, DoT officials said that they have issued the notice as it has been prescribed by the top court. “We are in line with the legal directive. The CoS’ recommendations are being handled at a different level, and our action has no bearing or connection to their working,” an official said.</p>
      <p>However, it is understood that the CoS and the telecom ministry are working on an urgent basis to work out a solution to address the financial mess of the industry. There is a fear of massive multi-crore bank and statutory defaults in case a solution is not offered soon, and this will increase financial stress for the banking system. Also, a large number of job losses could follow.</p>
      <p>A top official in the telecom ministry said that the recommendations of CoS could come soon. “It is a <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/top-priority">top priority</a> and we are hopeful that some solutions can be arrived at as early as possible,” the official said.</p>
