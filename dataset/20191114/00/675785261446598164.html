      <h1>John Lewis Christmas advert 2019 - first look at Excitable Edgar the dragon</h1>
      <h2>Edgar the excitable green dragon teams up with best friend Ava for this year's heartwarming John Lewis Christmas advert</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T00:01:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 00:01</time> by <a rel="author">Ruki Sayid, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/ruki-sayid/</a></address>
      <p>He is the most adorable dragon since Puff made his screen debut in the Seventies - and Edgar is poised to steal the nation’s hearts this Christmas.</p>
      <p>For the star of the John Lewis Christmas advert 2019 will have the nation giggling - and weeping - on their sofas in a two and a half minute emotional rollercoaster.</p>
      <p>In a first, the department store has joined forces with sister chain Waitrose for the Christmas blockbuster that will see Edgar merchandise from cuddly toys and pyjamas to slippers, chocolates and cupcakes fly off shelves.</p>
      <p>The long-awaited ad - which has become a national institution and heralds the start of Christmas - centres on fire-breathing Edgar and his best friend Ava, played by ten-year-old schoolgirl Ruby Dailly of Glasgow.</p>

      <p>As the excitement for Christmas builds, the little green dragon can't wait to help the children build a snowman.</p>
      <p>But as he tries to complete the character with a carrot for a nose, he breathes over it and reduces it to a puddle to the dismay of the kids.</p>
      <p>And Edgar is beside himself when he see the youngsters skating on the village ice rink. He races over to them but his fiery breath melts the ice and the fed up children glare at him as they tumble into the ice-cold water.</p>

      <p>In a bid to help him keep the fire breathing under control, caring Ava ties a scarf around his jaws as the villagers gather to see the square festooned in Christmas decorations and admire the lavishly decorated tree.</p>
      <p>But flames escape through the hapless dragon's nostrils and within seconds the tree and trimmings are destroyed with distraught Edgar taking to his den and refusing to come out, fearing he will continue to ruin Christmas for everyone.</p>
      <p>Despite Ava's pleas, he remains shut away until she tempts him out with a special and thoughtful present to be shared with the rest of the village at the traditional festive feast in the hall.</p>

      <p>But when Edgar appears at the door, the villagers abandon their sumptuous food and dive for cover under the table until Ava produces a Christmas pud on a platter which Edgar flambes with the lightest of breaths.</p>
      <p>As the tagline "Show them how much you care" appears across the screen, Excitable Edgar is welcomed back into the fold - with not a dry eye in the house.</p>
      <p>The emotive soundtrack, REO Speedwagon's Can't Fight This Feeling performed by Dan Smith of pop band Bastille is likely to challenge for the number one spot in the charts.</p>
      <p>Filmed in Budapest, Hungary over two weeks in August the ad goes live online at <a href="http://johnlewis.com/">Johnlewis.com</a> and <a href="http://waitrose.com/">Waitrose.com</a> this morning and hits TV screens on Saturday during the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/x-factor">X Factor</a> Celebrity break.</p>

      <p>Cuddly Edgar toys for £15 are set for a sell-out at both chains within days along with £17 pyjamas, £16 slippers and Edgar story books for £9.99.</p>
      <p>And Waitrose No 1 Christmas puds for £8 are expected to do a roaring trade too as they are the finale in the ad.</p>
      <p>Edgar's sidekick Ruby who was chosen from thousands of hopefuls for the role said: "Ava keeps on being friends with the dragon, even though he sets everything on fire.</p>
      <p>"He doesn't mean to so he gets sad whenever I'm mad at him."</p>
      <p>Excitable Edgar was created by ad agency adam&amp;eveDDB which was behind the first John Lewis tear-jerker, the story of the little boy who couldn't wait for Christmas in 2011.</p>

      <p>Richard Brim, the London agency's chief creative officer, said experts whittled around 400 scripts down to a shortlist of 30 before choosing Edgar as this year's star turn.</p>
      <p>He added: "There was something we really liked about him. Edgar loves Christmas - like just loves Christmas. Every time he sees something Christmasy, he can't control his fire. But obviously this can be quite detrimental to the Christmas period."</p>
      <p>With Edgar fever expected to sweep Britain, fans can give themselves the dragon look on Snapchat by turning into Edgar fire breathers with smoke coming out of their ears.</p>

      <p>It is the first time since Puff the Magic Dragon that a mythical creature which normally strikes fear into children and adults is set to steal the nation's heart.</p>
      <p>Puff started life as a song by trio Peter, Paul and Mary in 1963 and was turned into a screen animation in 1978.</p>
      <p>Craig Inglis, customer director at John Lewis &amp; Partners, said of Edgar: "It started from a spark of an idea - a little dragon's excitement about Christmas - and became the story of how someone goes the extra mile for their best friend to give just the right gift.</p>
      <p>"It's a funny, heart-warming story that will resonate with our customers as they seek out the perfect gifts for their loved ones this Christmas."</p>
