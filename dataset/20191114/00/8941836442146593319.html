      <p>NEW YORK (AP) - <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kellyanne-conway/">Kellyanne Conway</a> told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer that he embarrassed himself following a tense exchange Thursday where he asked the White House counselor to respond to her husband’s criticism of President <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Donald Trump</a> on television.</p>
      <p>Lawyer <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/george-conway/">George Conway</a> has frequently attacked his wife’s boss on social media. MSNBC brought him into the studio Wednesday to serve as an analyst during its coverage of the House impeachment hearings.</p>
      <p>Blitzer, toward the end of an in-studio interview with <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kellyanne-conway/">Kellyanne Conway</a> on Thursday morning, said he had a sensitive but substantive question for her.</p>

      <p>“I don’t want to talk about your marriage,” he said. “I know there are issues there.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kellyanne-conway/">Conway</a> seemed taken aback.</p>
      <hr/>
      <hr/>
      <p>“What did you say?” she asked. “You don’t want to talk about my marriage but there are issues there? Why would you say that?”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kellyanne-conway/">Conway</a> noted that there was no shortage of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a> critics who appear on CNN and MSNBC and wondered why Blitzer brought up her husband.</p>
      <p>“Because he’s a legal scholar, he’s a lawyer and he was really going after the president of the United States,” Blitzer said. “He was all over television yesterday.”</p>
      <p>Responded <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kellyanne-conway/">Conway</a>: “And the relevance is, come on, wait for it, drumroll, he’s married to me.”</p>

        <p>CNN rolled a tape of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/george-conway/">George Conway</a> criticizing <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a> for using foreign policy to advance his own interests. It aired on a split screen, as another camera followed his wife’s reaction.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kellyanne-conway/">Kellyanne Conway</a> said it was “his opinion.’’</p>
        <p>“What you just quoted is said every single day by other voices,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kellyanne-conway/">Conway</a> said. “But you wanted to put it in my husband’s voice because you think somehow that will help your ratings or that you’re really sticking it to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kellyanne-conway/">Kellyanne Conway</a>. And let me make it very clear, you didn’t stick it to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kellyanne-conway/">Kellyanne Conway</a>. I think you embarrassed yourself and I’m embarrassed for you.”</p>
        <p>MSNBC didn’t bring up <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kellyanne-conway/">Kellyanne</a> when her husband was on the air Wednesday, although anchor Brian Williams gave a knowing reference to “yes, that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/george-conway/">George Conway</a>,” when introducing him.</p>
