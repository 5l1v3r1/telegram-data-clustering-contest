      <h1>Rihanna Dishes Out Timely Reminder To Maintain A Work-Life Balance</h1>

      <p><b>You might be</b> intrinsically driven to bring your A game all the time, but there’s a time and place for everything. Take it from Rihanna, who, in 2019, launched luxury fashion label <a href="https://designtaxi.com/news/405027/Rihanna-Receives-Praise-For-Deliberately-Leaving-Model-s-Facial-Scars-Unedited/">Fenty</a> with LVMH and is working on a “<a href="https://designtaxi.com/news/406671/Rihanna-Is-Writing-A-Visual-Book-Featuring-Over-A-Thousand-Photos/">visual autobiography</a>” with over 1,000 photos. <br/><b>Despite being hounded</b> by fans to release new music, the songstress knows when it’s time to relax. Taking to Instagram, Rihanna explained her hiatus from music, at the same time encouraging kindred, burnt-out souls to give themselves a break when needed. <br/><b>“To all my</b> friends/family/coworkers who I have yet to get back to in the past months… please forgive me,” she wrote. “This year has been quite an overwhelming one, and I’m working on that ish called Balance. BRB [Be Right Back].” <br/><a href="https://designtaxi.com/notice.html?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Advertisement</a> <a href="https://designtaxi.com/notice.html?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Advertisement</a> <br/><b>Balance.</b> If that word strikes a chord with you, perhaps it’s time to unwind. If Rihanna can find it, so can you.</p>
