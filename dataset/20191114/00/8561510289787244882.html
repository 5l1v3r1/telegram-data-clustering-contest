      <h1>Nobel-Winning Scientist: I Have No Idea if the Big Bang Happened</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T00:00:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Dan Robitzski</a></address>
      <h3>Revisiting History</h3>
      <p>Nobel-winning cosmologist James Peebles has a bone to pick with the scientific community: he wants the world to stop referring to the <a href="https://futurism.com/new-research-shows-the-universe-may-have-once-been-a-hologram">earliest moments of our universe</a> as the “Big Bang.”</p>
      <p>His main beef, <a href="https://www.afp.com/en/news/826/top-cosmologists-lonely-battle-against-big-bang-theory-doc-1m915e1">according to <i>Agence France-Presse</i></a>, is that there’s no good way to test whether such a thing actually happened — cosmologists have evidence of a rapid outward expansion, but not anything as discrete as a singular point that detonated to create everything in the universe.</p>
      <p>“It’s very unfortunate that one thinks of the beginning whereas in fact, we have no good theory of such a thing as the beginning,” he told <i>AFP</i>.</p>
      <h3>Interesting Idea</h3>
      <p>Peebles doesn’t have an alternative to the Big Bang theory to propose, but that’s his exact point: without sufficient data, scientists shouldn’t assume a convenient hypothesis is correct.</p>
      <p>“We don’t have a strong test of what happened earlier in time,” Peebles told <i>AFP</i>. “We have theories, but not tested.”</p>
      <h3>Martyrdom</h3>
      <p>But Peebles isn’t quite ready to die on this hill — he concedes that in the absence of a better way to describe the <a href="https://futurism.com/astronomers-found-ancient-remains-big-bang-fossil-cloud">beginning of the universe</a>, “Big Bang” does just fine.</p>
      <p>“I have given up,” he told <i>AFP</i>, “I use Big Bang, I dislike it.”</p>
      <p>“But for years, some of us have tried to persuade the community to find a better term without success,” he said. “So ‘Big Bang’ it is. It’s unfortunate, but everyone knows that name. So I give up.”</p>
