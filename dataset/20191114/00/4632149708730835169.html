      <h1>Illaiyaraaja to rock first-ever concert at airport</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T00:30:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 00:30</time> by <a rel="author">Bangalore Mirror Bureau</a></address>
      <p>The first-ever concert at the Kempegowda International Airport (KIA) to be held this weekend is going to be grand, because on the cards is a performance by music maestro Ilaiyaraaja. The concert will be held at the Concert Arena for which a plot has been allotted adjacent to the newly-built South Access Road that runs parallel to the existing Main Access Road. <br/><br/>Ilaiyaraaja is expected to present hit Kannada, Tamil and Telugu songs during the concert, which is expected to be attended by an audience of about 16,000 people. The concert will begin at 6 pm. <br/><br/>The Bangalore International Airport Limited (BIAL), operators of KIA, had in July proposed to develop the Concert Arena on a 6.3-acre plot on the airport premises making it the first-of-its-kind to be built in an airport in India. <br/><br/>“BIAL plans to develop a world-class Concert Arena on a 6.3-acre land parcel at the Airport campus to cater to the growing demand for entertainment events in Bengaluru. Once complete, this arena would be the first of its kind to be built at an Airport in India. It is proposed to be a cost-effective, semi-permanent marquee structure,” BIAL spokesperson had earlier told Bangalore Mirror. <br/><br/>The proposed location of the arena is such that visitors can go directly to the Arena besides it would have no impact vehicle movement towards to the airport terminals. <br/><br/><br/>And the operators of the airport have outsourced the arena to companies who specialise in the field. <br/><br/>“The operators have directed the organisers of the upcoming concert to take care of the traffic and crowd management so that there’s no impact vehicle movement towards to the terminal,” said a source. <br/><br/><br/>For the concert, parking arrangements have been made on a pay basis at the P1 and P2 Parking bays.</p>
