        <b>Dutch karting champion Marijn Kremers has secured a funded seat with Carlin in British Formula 4 next season after winning a shootout co-organised by 1997 Formula 1 champion Jacques Villeneuve.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Kremers, 21, triumphed in the competition held by racing school FEED Racing France at Magny-Cours earlier this week.</p>
      <p>Villeneuve founded the school alongside Patrick Lemarie - a test driver for the BAR F1 team for four years while Villeneuve drove for the outfit - and both were part of a judging panel for the shootout that also featured 1996 Monaco Grand Prix winner Olivier Panis.</p>
      <p>Nearly 100 drivers registered for the scholarship and these were whittled down to a final six that contested the shootout in Mygale F4 cars.</p>
      <p>Kremers, who won the CIK-FIA World KZ karting title this year, will now receive a funded British F4 season with leading squad Carlin - which has run the champion driver in every year it has been in the series.</p>
      <p>"It feels great!" said Kremers of his win. "I see the season in British F4 as a great opportunity for me to boost my racing career to the next level and it is a great feeling to have secured a seat with an amazing team as Carlin.</p>

      <p>"I'm very excited, Carlin is such a big name in motorsport and I'm sure I will be able to learn a lot from their experience.</p>
      <p>"Hopefully I'll be able to add another championship for them."</p>
      <p>Kremers becomes the sixth driver to commit to racing in British F4 next season.</p>
      <p>Ginetta Junior racer Casper Stevenson has also recently won a scholarship - this time a prize pot worth Â£35,000 from British F4 and the series' partners.</p>
      <p>His fellow Ginetta Junior driver Roman Bilinski has already signed up and will drive for Arden alongside karter Frederick Lubin.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, Brazilian Roberto Faria will continue with Fortec for a second season, while Peruvian karting graduate Matias Zagazeta will be a team-mate of Kremers at Carlin.</p>
