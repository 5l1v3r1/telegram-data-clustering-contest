        <b>The BBC will continue to screen live Formula E races in the 2019-20 season, with a second event to be broadcast on terrestrial TV compared to last season.</b>
      </p>
      <p>All FE races will be shown live on the BBC's iPlayer and Sport website platforms, with "select" races also available on its red button service - per an statement from the electric championship.</p>
      <p>The Marrakech race on February 29 2020 and the Rome E-Prix on April 4 will be shown on one of the BBC's network TV channels.</p>
      <p>In 2018-19, the BBC broadcast the Hong Kong race on BBC2, which FE claims was seen by "more than half a million viewers across all linear and digital platforms".</p>
      <p>"We are extremely pleased to be back on the BBC for yet another exciting year of electric racing, with more races selected to be shown live on network channels," said FE's chief marketing officer Jerome Hiquet.</p>
      <p>"Expanding our broadcast partnership and offering different ways to watch Formula E on the BBC helps bring British fans closer to the sport than ever before.</p>
      <p>"We want the ABB FIA Formula E Championship to be accessible to the widest possible audience and with five British drivers on the grid, Formula E fans in the UK will need to choose who they are getting behind when racing returns to London in July next summer.</p>

      <p>"The British contingent may outnumber the other famous names in the field, but they face stiff competition with the arrival of Mercedes-Benz and Porsche, as well as the current F2 champion Nyck de Vries choosing to join Formula E for the start of the new season.</p>
      <p>"With 22 drivers separated by less than one second in pre-season testing, it is anyone's guess who will come out on top in the first race on Friday next week.</p>
      <p>"That is what makes Formula E so special to watch. Tune in to find out for yourself who the winner will be."</p>
      <p>Autosport understands the reason the returning London E-Prix is not one of the two races the BBC will show live on one of its main TV channels is because of its commitments around next summer's Tokyo Olympics, which get under way on the same weekend - 25-26 July - as the FE season finale at ExCeL London.</p>
