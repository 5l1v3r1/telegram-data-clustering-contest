      <p>India were troubled only rarely on the first day of the first Test in Indore as they ended at 86/1, a deficit of 64, after their excellent bowlers had bundled out Bangladesh for 150 on Thursday, 14 November.</p>

      <p>Bangladesh won the toss, but on a pitch with a subtle tinge of green down the middle, Mominul Haque, their new Test captain, decided to bat. That suited the Indian pace attack just fine. They broke through within six overs, and apart from a 68-run for the fourth wicket between Mushfiqur Rahim and Haque, the bowlers bossed the innings.</p>
      <p>Bangladesh did well initially with the ball. Ebadat Hossain and Abu Jayed kept things tight, and when Rohit Sharma was dismissed, the visitors enjoyed their first real phase of control in the match. But Cheteshwar Pujara and Mayank Agarwal quickly ensured that was a brief moment, and their unbroken 72-run partnership helped India through to stumps without anything more eventful.</p>

      <p>The day began with the Indian pacemen showing yet again why they are so feared these days. Ishant Sharma tempted Shadman Islam into a drive, and the batsman was promptly caught behind for six. Imrul Kayes followed suit in the next over off Umesh Yadav, and when Mohammad Mithun was deceived by Mohammed Shami’s swing and was trapped in front, Bangladesh were 31/3, and all the Indian paceman were among the wickets.</p>
      <p>It was then that Rahim and Haque got together. It wasn’t the most comfortable partnership – both batsmen were dropped, with Mushfiqur particularly fortunate to survive twice after edging Umesh Yadav and R Ashwin, with Virat Kohli and Ajinkya Rahane dropping the catches when he was on 3 and 14 respectively.</p>
      <p>Slowly, they recovered, and nudged and prodded their way to add 68 runs. It helped boost the total to 99, but Ashwin got the breakthrough with a sliding delivery from around the wicket to Haque, and that triggered an almighty slide.</p>

      <p>Mahmudullah went across his stumps but was bowled by Ashwin, and Shami then took consecutive wickets with a brilliant display of swing bowling at the stroke of tea. He accounted for Mushfiqur and Mehidy Hasan, and Bangladesh were 140/7. It didn’t take long for India to bundle them out in the final session.</p>
      <p>India were tied up for a bit early in their first innings, with Rohit falling for six to Abu Jayed, flashing at one outside off. However, when Pujara walked out, he was in a rare mood. Having settled down, he launched into an attack on the bowlers – executing the cut to delightful effect repeatedly – and with Agarwal doing his bit to find the fence every other over, Bangladesh were under the pump.</p>
      <p>Agarwal could have been dismissed had Kayes held on to a straightforward chance off Jayed late in the day, but the reprieve meant India ended the day in firm control.</p>
