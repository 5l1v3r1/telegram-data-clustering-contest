      <p>Passengers travelling in and out of Manchester Airport now have the option of bypassing the main terminals completely.</p>
      <p>The airport has marked the official opening of Premiair, its new pay-to-access arrivals and departures facility, following a soft launch.</p>
      <p>It offers four price options:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Priority for £50, which allows passengers with hang baggage to arrive an hour before their flight, get a personal welcome, separate security channel and drive across the airfield to their aircraft;</li>
        <li>Premium for £100, which gives access to a private terminal with complimentary food and drink, luggage handling, a private security channel and transfer to the aircraft;</li>
        <li>Arrivals for £125, providing a private transfer to the Premiair terminal from the aircraft, a dedicated passport control lane, use of the lounge facilities and luggage delivery;</li>
        <li>Priority/Arrivals combined for £175, with further upgrades available.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Groups of between five and 50 can access one of three private suites, which are located before security so people who are not travelling can join events and meetings.</p>
      <p>The airport says these are available on enquiry and will be set up based on guests’ requirements.</p>
      <p>Premiair is <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/PremiAir+Manchester+Airport/@53.3604357,-2.2883831,14.75z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x487a530f61638163:0xabbea675ee054234!8m2!3d53.3544763!4d-2.2831948">located</a> south of the main terminals next to the Runway Visitor Park, an educational facility also popular with planespotters (some of whom have <a href="https://www.businesstraveller.com/business-travel/2019/07/02/manchester-airport-says-new-terminal-will-mean-changes-to-runway-visitor-park-view/">complained that the new building blocks a large part of the view</a>.)</p>
