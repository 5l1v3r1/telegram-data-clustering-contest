      <p>Oracle has launched two new solutions, the Digital Sales Solution and its customer data management (CDM) platform for Oracle Service Cloud. The Digital Sales Solution is the latest addition to the Oracle Customer Experience (CX) Cloud suite and has a new user interface to help sales representatives recognize and qualify good opportunities and move on from bad opportunities quickly.</p>

      <h3>Why we should care</h3>
      <p>B2B buyers have high expectations for brand interactions. Many expect timely, relevant and personalized engagements from brands — and the people representing them. The new solution is designed with a user interface that prioritizes speed and is intended to guide sales representatives through the process efficiently.</p>
      <p>The new solution also seeks to help sales representatives save time by reducing the number of fields needed to find and update customer relationship management (CRM) records. The Digital Sales Solution uses the Oracle Digital Assistant throughout the program to help users find key data on customer accounts and adding product or pricing information to records.</p>
      <p>Oracle’s new CDM for B2C Service includes a Customer Data Hub to connect access to data from disparate systems. It also uses AI and machine learning to merge and update data from multiple sources.</p>
