      <p>The European Union is about to increase its border patrol force by nearly tenfold. <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/statement_19_6237">Announced on Tuesday</a>, the expansion of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, commonly known as Frontex, will see the force grow from 1,300 to some 10,000 border guards. Most of these new hires will be Frontex's own officers, whereas in the past they have come from member states' forces. The agency also announced it will buy up its own equipment, including vessels, planes and other vehicles.“The European Union has achieved an ambitious task of transforming the EU border agency, Frontex, into a fully-fledged European Border and Coast Guard,” said First Vice-President Frans Timmermans and Commissioner for Home Affairs, Migration and Citizenship Dimitris Avramopoulos in a statement. "This Agency will be equipped to offer tangible support to Member States to manage the EU's external border – wherever and whenever needed.”</p>
      <p>This is a big step for Frontex. As a <a href="https://frontex.europa.eu/media-centre/news-release/we-are-recruiting-frontex-border-guards-qd1BSA">recruitment campaign</a> from last month read, “For the first time Frontex will have its owned uniformed service, working under the banner of the European Union.”</p>
      <p>Also part of the announcement is stepped up support for third, or non-EU, countries, meaning EU forces will operate outside of the union. Per the statement: “The Agency will also provide support beyond the EU's borders. With European Border and Coast Guard officers already deployed <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/eu-elections-2019/news/frontex-launches-first-joint-operation-outside-eu-in-albania/">in Albania</a> and soon in other Western Balkan countries also, the Agency will be able to cooperate with third countries beyond the EU's immediate neighbourhood.”</p>
      <p>This will all be to the delight of those more anti-migrant members of the union. Members such as the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia (commonly known as the Visegrad group) as well as Austria and Italy have been calling for a <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/visegrad-countries-urge-stronger-eu-border-defense/a-44336264">strengthened EU border force for years</a>.</p>
      <p>But human rights groups <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2011/09/21/eu-border-agency-exposes-migrants-abusive-conditions">are concerned</a> about the way the border force works in practice and the wisdom of militarizing Europe’s borders in general. Earlier this year, Human Rights Watch <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2019/07/15/human-rights-watch-letter-frontex">wrote an open letter</a> to the Head of Frontex, Fabrice Leggeri, addressing the allegations of illegal “<a href="https://www.european-views.com/2019/07/eu-border-guards-use-a-little-bit-of-force-to-push-migrants-back-to-bosnia-croatias-president-admits/">push-backs</a>” of asylum seekers from within the EU's bounds back out.</p>
      <p>In Tuesday's announcement, the EU said they have "spared no effort" in helping member states protect their borders. But Judith Sunderland, associate director for Human Rights Watch’s Europe and Central Asia division, says the European Commission and Council ought to apply the same assiduousness to making sure Frontex operates with proper oversight and in a way that respects human rights:</p>
      <p>“More boots on the ground shouldn’t mean more boots on the necks of migrants and refugees. Border guards, whether national or Frontex, take actions and decisions with enormous consequences for people’s health, well-being and future. They need to be properly trained and monitored, and held to account when abuses occur."</p>
      <p>Sunderland says Frontex needs to act with far more transparency and accountability, but the key to solving the issue lies with the EU's immigration policies overall: "Ultimately, a good, smart way for the EU to control its borders is to create more safe and legal ways for people to come to European countries for refuge, work, and education. That would help minimize dangerous migration journeys and increase security at EU borders.”</p>
      <p>This all comes as some EU members and neighbouring countries sound the alarm about the increasing pressure of migrants trying to get into Europe. On Tuesday the head of the Bosnian border police, Zoran Galic, <a href="https://apnews.com/ddca8a10cf8545ec9e20811598507ab1">told the Associated Press</a> his country could not withstand the amount of people trying to get through Bosnia to Croatia, an EU member country. Galic described the situation as a Sisyphean task: “We are in a constant struggle to deter migrants, but they never quit,” he told the AP.</p>
      <p>And on Tuesday, Hungarian Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade Péter Szijjártó <a href="https://www.kormany.hu/en/ministry-of-foreign-affairs-and-trade/news/increasing-migration-pressure-to-be-expected-in-the-upcoming-months">warned</a> of "increasing migration pressure" in the next couple of months. He said it was becoming "increasingly urgent for the focus of international migration policy to change, and shift to facilitating returns home and the on-site solution of problems, instead of encouraging further waves of migration.”</p>
      <p>His emphasis on <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/freylindsay/2019/10/30/the-eu-is-eroding-safeguards-for-migrants-sent-back-to-unsafe-countries/#a268b235c6a9">returns</a> and "on-site solutions," which is to say making sure migrants and asylum seekers stay where they are rather than making it to Europe, may be a forthright way of saying it but it reflects the direction the EU is taking on migration and asylum policy. In September, the new head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, wrote to incoming Home Affairs Commissioner Ylva Johansson <a href="https://bertie.forbes.com/#/compose?id=5dcc172308cfa000066f933c">urging her</a>, among other things, to focus on the implementation of the expanded Frontex, to ensure the EU have "strong external borders" and to "step up efforts to develop a more robust system of readmission and return."</p>
      <p>For her part, Johansson said in a hearing before the European Parliament's Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs that she had understood her mandate from the Commissioner: "I will be looking at the full range of migration policies; asylum, fighting irregular migration, strengthening external borders, return, legal pathways, integration and cooperation with partners outside the EU."</p>
      <p>She also gave a nod to one of the main, though often unstated, reasons the EU want to strengthen their borders. Aside from stated humanitarian concerns and acquiescence to the more anti-migrant members of the bloc, the EU are keen to restore full freedom of movement within its borders. This is a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=457">key part</a> of the whole European project, and one that was <a href="https://www.ecfr.eu/specials/scorecard/schengen_flash_scorecard">badly rocked</a> by the 'migrant crisis' of 2015/2016.</p>
      <p>As Johansson <a href="https://multimedia.europarl.europa.eu/en/hearing-of-ylva-johansson-commissioner-designate-home-affairs-opening-statement-by-ylva-johansson_I177902-V_v">explained in her hearing</a>, the importance of a strong border to internal movement had not gone over her head: "The swift return to a fully functioning Schengen area without internal border controls will be a key objective for me. The more successful our new pact on migration and asylum, the stronger our external borders (...) and the more effective our work against smuggling, the more trust there will be in the Schengen area."</p>
