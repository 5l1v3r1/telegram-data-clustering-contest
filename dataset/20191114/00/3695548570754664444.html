        <b>Formula 1 teams may be asked to vote on whether to abandon Pirelli's 2020 tyres after they are tested in Abu Dhabi next month.</b>
      </p>
      <p>If seven out of 10 teams are still unhappy with the new specification tyres Pirelli could be obliged to stick with its proven 2019 products for next season.</p>
      <p>All teams were given two sets of the 2020 tyres to try in Friday practice at Austin a fortnight ago.</p>
      <p>Drivers were so frustrated by a lack of grip that teams questioned whether Pirelli had gone in the right direction and suggested that it might be better to stick with the 2019 construction.</p>

        <li>Rows resume as 2020 tyres trialled</li>

          <a href="https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/146949/f1-2020-tyres-very-weird-or-too-soon-to-judge">'Very weird' or too soon to judge? The early verdict on 2020 tyres</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Pirelli's view was that the test was not representative, because of the cold conditions and the fact that teams did not adjust their set-ups to suit the new tyres.</p>
      <p>The company's F1 boss Mario Isola also pointed out that the 2020 tyres were expected to provide less grip, but would be more consistent.</p>
      <p>Teams initially agreed to take a more detailed look at the data from Austin, but some were pushing for a quick decision to be made on sticking with the 2019 tyres - even before the Abu Dhabi test on December 3-4.</p>
      <p>Last week FIA technical chief Nikolas Tombazis contacted all the teams and it has been agreed that the two days of 2020 running in Abu Dhabi should go ahead.</p>
      <p>Following a subsequent analysis of the data a vote could be held the following week, if some teams still have doubts about the 2020 tyres.</p>
      <p>In theory article 12.6.1 of the FIA technical regulations applies.</p>
      <p>The rule states: "Tyre specifications will be determined by the tyre supplier, in agreement with the FIA, no later than 1 September of the previous season for the construction and 1 December for the range of compounds to be used during the championship season.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Another F1 tyre debacle</li>
        <li>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>"Once determined in this way, the specification of the tyres will not be changed without the agreement of at least 70% of the competing teams.</p>
      <p>"Notwithstanding the above, the FIA may decide to change the specification during the championship season for safety reasons without notice or delay."</p>
      <p>Midfield teams in particular are frustrated because the September 1 deadline passed long ago.</p>
      <p>That was put in place specifically because the construction and hence shape of the tyres has a huge impact on aero, and teams need that information as soon as possible. In this case the 2020 tyres have a wider shoulder, as illustrated below by GIORGIO PIOLA.</p>

      <p>Amid the uncertainty teams have so far been running their 2020 aero programmes with two possible tyre shapes in mind - the current and the new versions - and that is much harder for those with less resource.</p>
      <p>Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel, one of the few drivers to have tried the final 2020 tyres before Austin, admitted that there are still some concerns.</p>
      <p>"It's probably good to give them another go," he said when asked by Autosport.</p>
      <p>"On the other hand the targets that were set out to achieve probably we didn't achieve.</p>
      <p>"I had a day in Barcelona, we had the cross-check in Austin.</p>
      <p>"I think the feedback wasn't positive, and in the end we try to make a step forward. So we'll see what comes out."</p>
