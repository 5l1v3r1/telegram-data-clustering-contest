      <p><b>Topline: </b>In the latest salvo in her war on the ultrarich and her public feud with longtime investor Leon Cooperman, 2020 hopeful Elizabeth Warren released a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN0a_ZhYjac&amp;amp=&amp;amp=&amp;amp=&amp;feature=youtu.be">new TV ad</a> that takes aim at a group of billionaires who have criticized her proposed wealth tax.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Set to air on CNBC on Thursday, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN0a_ZhYjac&amp;amp=&amp;amp=&amp;amp=&amp;feature=youtu.be">the ad</a> calls for a wealth tax and targets Cooperman as well as other billionaires, including former TD Ameritrade CEO Joe Ricketts, former Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein and Silicon Valley investor Peter Thiel.</li>
        <li>The clips featuring Cooperman, in particular, criticize the hedge fund pioneer for past insider-trading allegations (Cooperman paid a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/statement-leon-cooperman-settling-insider-trading-charges">$5 million settlement</a> to the SEC in 2017), according to CNBC.</li>
        <li>Cooperman didn’t hold back when responding to the ad in a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/13/elizabeth-warren-blasts-billionaires-in-campaign-ad-calling-for-wealth-tax.html?__source=sharebar%7Ctwitter&amp;par=sharebar">later interview</a>, in which he again blasted Warren for her attacks on billionaires: “In my opinion she represents the worst in politicians as she’s trying to demonize wealthy people because there are more poor people then wealthy people,” he told CNBC. </li>
        <li>“As far as the accusations of insider trading, I won the case. She’s disgraceful. She doesn’t know who the f—- she’s tweeting. I gave away more in the year than she has in her whole f——ing lifetime,” he said.</li>
        <li>The new TV ad—and Cooperman’s fiery response—yet again escalates the already very <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelsandler/2019/11/04/billionaire-leon-cooperman-escalates-feud-with-elizabeth-warren/#2b859a9d297a">tense public feud</a> between Warren and the billionaire investor.</li>
        <li>Cooperman wasn’t the only billionaire to respond: Former Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/14/lloyd-blankfein-mocks-elizabeth-warren-maybe-tribalism-is-just-in-her-dna.html?__source=twitter%7Cmain">said on Thursday</a> he was “surprised to be featured” in the ad given that he and Warren “align on so many issues,” also adding, “maybe tribalism is just in her DNA.”</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Key background:</b> Numerous other business leaders and billionaires, including JPMorgan Chase CEO <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2019/11/05/jamie-dimon-enters-warren-billionaires-debate-she-uses-some-pretty-harsh-words/#e594b2167ea6">Jamie Dimon</a>, <i>Shark Tank</i> investor <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2019/11/11/mark-cuban-becomes-latest-billionaire-to-criticize-warren-she-is-misleading-the-public/#6af91df81b8b">Mark Cuban</a> and Microsoft cofounder <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2019/11/07/gates-becomes-latest-billionaire-to-grapple-with-warren/#41da284c3d02">Bill Gates</a>, have criticized Warren for her attacks on the wealthy. With the 2020 election growing ever closer, many on Wall Street are becoming increasingly critical of Warren, whom they perceive as a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/04/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-wall-street.html">threat to big business</a>. It all started with the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelsandler/2019/11/04/billionaire-leon-cooperman-escalates-feud-with-elizabeth-warren/#2b859a9d297a">public spat</a> between Warren and Cooperman, which has now come to exemplify the backlash that has emerged since the Democratic senator announced her 6% wealth tax on billionaires to finance her ambitious “<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2019/11/01/heres-everything-we-know-about-elizabeth-warrens-205-trillion-medicare-for-all-plan/#6c05b7531d09">Medicare For All</a>” plan.</p>
      <p><b>Tangent: </b>Cooperman <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/08/leon-cooperman-says-he-will-support-mike-bloomberg-for-president.html">has said</a> that he is a “huge fan” of Michael Bloomberg and will “unequivocal[ly] support” the former New York mayor if he runs for president in 2020. Bloomberg is yet another billionaire who has criticized Warren’s anti-corporate rhetoric, describing her wealth tax as potentially unconstitutional and comparing it to socialism: “It’s called Venezuela,” he said <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/michael-bloomberg-takes-dig-at-warren-for-anti-corporate-rhetoric">earlier this year</a>.</p>
      <p><b>Crucial quote:</b> “A wealth tax makes no sense,” Cooperman <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/14/leon-cooperman-warren-wealth-is-tax-probably-constitutional.html">reiterated</a> to CNBC on Thursday. “It would lead to unnatural acts, be near impossible to police and is probably unconstitutional.”</p>
