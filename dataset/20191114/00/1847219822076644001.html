        <b>From 2020 onward unemployment status will be provided and benefits paid for eight months instead of nine, BNN was told by Saeima’s press-service.</b>
      </p>
      <p>This is provided by amendments to the Law on Unemployment Insurance approved by the Saeima in the final reading on Thursday, 14 November. These amendments are included in the next year’s budget package.</p>
      <p>Unemployment benefit will be paid in full amount for the first two months. Starting with the third month, however, it will be 75%, in the fifth and sixth month the amount paid will be 50%, and in the seventh and eighth month the amount will be reduced to 45%.</p>
      <p>Until now unemployment benefits were paid for nine months in a twelve-month period from the day benefits were provided. In the first three months the benefit was paid in full, 75% were paid in the next three months and 50% in the last three months.</p>

          <b>Unemployment benefits in Latvia to be paid for eight, not nine months</b>
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>Latvia’s Welfare Minister Ramona Petraviča had previously explained that this measure is meant to help save EUR 12 million.</p>
      <h3>Data from the State Social Insurance Agency shows that the average length of payment of unemployment benefits is 4.4 months. This means most unemployed people find jobs quickly and there is no need to spend more money on benefits.</h3>
      <p>Amendments were developed by Welfare Ministry. It was previously noted that no changes are planned for the first two months of unemployment period.</p>
      <p>Changes were initiated to motivate quicker and more efficient return to the labour market and involvement in the social insurance system. This will help reduce the shortage of labour force, as well as reduce state social insurance special budget expenditures, as mentioned in the annotation to amendments.</p>
      <p>The new order will be applied when deciding on provision of unemployment benefits for people who receive their status from 1 January 2020 onward.</p>
