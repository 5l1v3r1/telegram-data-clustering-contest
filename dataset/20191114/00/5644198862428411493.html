      <p>He added that the causes of the crash were unknown.</p>
      <p>The fire and rescue department said on its Facebook page that the toll was 12 dead and 17 injured.</p>
      <p>Minister of Health Andrea Kalavska told journalists at the accident site that of those killed, "at least four were underage".</p>
      <p>Interior Minister Denisa Sakova told the press at the site that the truck was "probably overloaded".</p>
      <p>According to reports on Slovak commercial TV channel Markiza, the truck skidded and hit the bus from the side.</p>
      <p>The bus serves as a regular line between Nitra and the village of Jelenec east of the city.</p>
      <p>Rescuers at first put the number of dead at 13, with 20 injured, before correcting the toll.</p>
      <p>Some 30 firefighters are at the scene to help the injured, while rescuers have deployed helicopters and sent in psychologists.</p>
      <p>They said rescue work was hampered by bad weather as Slovakia was hit by heavy rain on Wednesday, although there was no rain when the accident occurred.</p>
