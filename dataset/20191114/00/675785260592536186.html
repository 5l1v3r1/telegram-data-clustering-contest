      <p>Kylie Jenner has declared that she has "made the naughty list" this year.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old billionaire make-up mogul is once again in sparkling form as she teases the launch of a new cosmetic collection for the festive season.</p>
      <p>The Keeping Up With The Kardashians star revealed that there was something new from Kylie Cosmetics by posing in a sparkling red bow on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> .</p>
      <p>Kylie shared with her 151 million followers that she had something for Christmas lists across the world, with a sizzling pic that had amassed over a million likes in its first hour.</p>
      <p>Dressed in red, with a giant gift bow in hair, Kylie looked like the gift that would top many people's want list, as she made reference to a turbulent few months in her personal life.</p>

      <p>The reality star has split from rapper Travis Scott, the father of her daughter Stormi Webster, and has since been linked with a romantic liaison with Drake.</p>
      <p>She was seen at his side for much of his 33rd birthday party and there have been rumours that they have 'dated' since then.</p>
      <p>This has all been denied by sources close to Kylie, especially as Drake has been a long-term friend of the Kardashian family.</p>
      <p>Captioning the pic, Kylie wrote: "Made the naughty list this year..️ my HOLIDAY collection is around the corner. Who’s ready for the reveal?"</p>
      <p>Kourtney Kardashian's ex Scott Disick's current beau, Sofia Richie, was among the first to comment, saying: "In love w you"</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Kylie has been forced to deny that she threatened a small company with legal action after she trademarked the popular saying 'Rise and Shine.'</p>
      <p>She took to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> over the weekend to deny reports that her legal team contacted a small clothing business based in Australia - after they carried T-shirts with the well-known phrase emblazoned on.</p>
      <p>In response to the reports, the mother-of-one wrote: "Guys, please don't believe everything you read. I have not sent any Rise and Shine cease and desist letters."</p>

      <p>She explained: "Rise and Shine was an unexpected moment.. I had a lot of fun with it, and I have laughed so hard seeing everyone's memes since the video came out a few weeks ago."</p>
      <p>The make-up mogul then followed up with a second Tweet that read: "There are no law suits, no cease and desist letters. Happy Sunday."</p>
