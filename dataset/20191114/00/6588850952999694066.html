      <p>On December 17, 2019, Ghana will conduct a referendum alongside district level elections.</p>
      <p>However, the Editor-in-Chief of the <b>New Crusading Guide</b> newspaper, Kweku Baako Jnr wishes that the referendum would be deferred, especially with a recent press conference held by the opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC) where they urged Ghanaians to vote 'No'.<br/><br/><i>"I don't know whether it's too late to abandon the project . . . my whole sense is that it's not going to come on, they won't give us the two thirds,"</i> Kweku Baako said while contributing to a panel discussion on <b>Peace FM's</b> morning show 'kokrokoo'.<br/><br/>According to him if we underestimate the implications of what the main opposition NDC has done, "we will be joking."<br/><br/><i>"They've breached faith, they've shown that they can be very diabolical," </i>he told Kwami Sefa Kayi. <br/><br/>The opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC) has asked Ghanaians to vote against the proposed amendment of Article 55 (3) of the 1992 Constitution which will make local government elections partisan.<br/><br/>Article 55 (3) states that “subject to the provisions of this article, a political party is free to participate in shaping the political will of the people, to disseminate information on political ideas, social and economic programmes of a national character and sponsor candidates for elections to any public office other than to District Assemblies or lower local government units.’’<br/><br/>The referendum has become necessary because Article 55 is an entrenched provision of the Constitution and therefore can only be amended through a referendum.<br/><br/>At a press conference Tuesday, Chairman of the party, Samuel Ofosu Ampofo said the local government system should remain non-partisan and that individuals should contest the District Assembly and Unit Committee elections on their own merit.<br/>Listen to the video below to understand why the renowned journalist wants the referendum suspended.</p>
