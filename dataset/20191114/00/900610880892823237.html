      <h1>On Children’s Day, Spice Jet takes 118 cancer patients on a ‘joy-flight’</h1>

      <p>As the nation celebrates ‘Children’s Day’, SpiceJet took undertook a special initiative – <i>Sapnon ki Udaan</i> (a flight of dreams) – a day-long carnival with 118 underprivileged children and adult patients battling cancer.</p>
      <p>The initiative was supported by CanSupport, an NGO that runs India’s largest free home-based palliative care programme for cancer patients and their families. This ‘joy-flight’ included children aged between six to 20 years. Most of them had never travelled by air before and wished to ‘fly in a plane’.</p>
      <p>A SpiceJet Boeing 737 aircraft was especially designated to take these patients on the ‘joy-flight’ which included 60 children and 58 adults. SpiceJet flew with the patients along with their guardians on a sortie from New Delhi airport. With a total of 146 passengers on-board, the aircraft flew over the city of Delhi for about an hour.</p>
      <p>After landing at the Delhi airport, these patients were escorted to a hotel near Delhi Aerocity for a buffet dinner and fun activities for them to enjoy. The menu was especially curated taking into account all dietary restrictions.</p>
      <p>“It is both our responsibility and honour to be a part of such a noble cause. We are glad that through this initiative we are able to make a small difference in the lives of these patients who are bravely battling cancer. Spice Jet has taken many such initiatives in the past and will keep doing so in the future, contributing in our own small way to bringing happiness and joy,” says Ajay Singh, chairman and managing director, Spice Jet.</p>
