      <p>You can browse our full <b><a href="http://nyc-shows.brooklynvegan.com/events">NYC show calendar</a></b> for all of tonight’s shows, but here are some highlights…</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/seefeel-share-unreleased-song-from-new-warp-box-set-tour-starts-soon/"><b>Seefeel, The Veldt @ Warsaw</b></a><br/>Seefeel, the electronic-leaning UK post-rock/shoegaze group who released albums on Too Pure, Warp and Aphex Twin’s Rephlex Records, reunited in 2011 for a <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/seefeel-release/">new album</a>, and were supposed to tour North America for the first time ever. That tour got canceled but they’re finally doing it, and tonight is their first-ever NYC show.</p>

      <p><a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/christopher-tignor-preps-new-lp-playing-shows-with-low-this-will-destroy-you/"><b>This Will Destroy You, Christopher Tignor @ The Bell House</b></a><br/>Texas post-rock greats This Will Destroy You are on the road supporting their two very solid 2018 albums, <i>New Others Part One and Two</i>.
