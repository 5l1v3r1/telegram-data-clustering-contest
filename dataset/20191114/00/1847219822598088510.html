        <b>The level of suspicious interest of foreign people for Latvia’s military objects using different research methods, including drones, is considered medium-high, says Latvia’s Defence Minister Artis Pabriks.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Pabriks says reconnaissance activities from Russia’s side continue increasing. Other countries also perform reconnaissance activities. The minister did not mention any specific countries. This reconnaissance is performed in technological field.</p>
      <p>The minister revealed that movement of suspicious drones is observed near military installations. Several drone operators have been detained so far. Investigations continue.</p>

      <p>«I will not mention in more detail, but there were cases when activities of drone operators raised suspicions about their possible ties with military reconnaissance. When it comes to drones, not all of them can be associated with reconnaissance. One is able to catch all drones and their operators with 100% efficiency. Our objective is not shooting down drones in all situations. It is far more important to catch the operator and find out what information they wanted to gather,» said the minister.</p>
      <h3>Suspicious interest of foreigners and third parties has been observed near Ādaži base and other military installations.</h3>
      <p>No one climbs over gates of bases, adds the minister. «We are not toothless. However, this is about finding evidence,» adds the minister.</p>
      <p>The minister explains that catching foreign intelligence service officers in the act does not mean they will be successfully tried in court. There are other methods, such as expulsion cases not publicly reported. Expulsion is one of the methods that allows Latvia to control the presence of foreign intelligence officers in the country, claims the politician.</p>
      <p>Pabriks believes Latvia should perform legislative changes in order to perform drone identification. This is not just a topic for Latvia but Europe, too. «There was a drone noticed above my home, and it did not belong to neighbours,» added the minister.</p>
