      <p>July 2019 saw the 50th anniversary of Apollo 11, but the following five missions to the moon were—technically, at least—more impressive. The second crewed lunar landing mission, Apollo 12’s objective was to perform detailed scientific lunar exploration. Apollo 12 could easily have been the first moon landing. If Apollo 11 had failed, Apollo 12 was lined-up for launch in September 1969, and the ill-fated Apollo 13 for November. However, with Apollo 11’s success, Apollo 12 moved back, and on November 14, 1969 at 11:22 a.m. EST, astronauts Charles "Pete" Conrad, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3669037/Down-to-earth.html">future lunar artist Alan L. Bean</a> and Richard F. Gordon lifted-off from Kennedy Space Center on NASA’s second moonshot.</p>

Gordon Jr., command module pilot; and Alan L. Bean, lunar module pilot. Apollo 12 was the United States' second lunar landing mission.<cite>NASA</cite></figcaption>

Then again on 52 seconds. “We had everything in the world drop out”, said Conrad, but the rocket was unaffected and the systems soon came back to life. </p>

      <p>As the Apollo 12 command module returned to Earth, it went behind the planet relative to the sun, and the astronauts witnessed a total solar eclipse caused not by the moon, but by Earth. The above image was taken on November 21, 1969.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Apollo 12 had the first color TV camera on the moon–given to the crew three days before launch–and Conrad was successfully filmed descending to the lunar surface. However, while setting it up on the moon’s surface, Alan Bean accidentally pointed it at the sun, which destroyed its image pick-up tube. “Here is the TV. And it's pointing toward the Sun. That's bad.” he said. It was a serious setback with devastating consequences; TV networks had cleared their schedules to cover the Apollo 12 mission in in-depth and in exquisite color, and were left frustrated. Arguably, the Apollo missions never recovered from this major media mishap.</p>

      <p>The bottom of Apollo 12’s command module smacked-down hard on to the Pacific Ocean rather than splashing-down at a slight angle. Consequently, Alan Bean was knocked unconsciousness for five seconds by a 16mm film camera that dislodged and hit his forehead. He had to have six stitches in a 2cm laceration above his right eyebrow.</p>

A little more than two years after it landed on the moon with the goal of paving the way for a future human mission, the Surveyor 3 spacecraft got a visit from Apollo 12 Commander Charles Conrad Jr. and astronaut Alan L. Bean, who snapped this photo on November 20, 1969.<cite>NASA</cite></figcaption>

      <p>Apollo 12 purposely landed near the crash site of NASA’s probe <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveyor_3">Surveyor 3</a>, a robotic probe that had landed on the moon just 2 1/2 years before. Bean and Conrad walked over to it and retrieved various pieces of the probe to help scientists back home study how space affects mechanical parts, including its camera. No other space-probe has ever been visited by astronauts after launch.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Conrad and Bean performed two moonwalks, totalling 32 hours, and collected 34kg of samples and 45 moon rocks. They are mostly basalt, and <a href="https://www.lpi.usra.edu/lunar/missions/apollo/apollo_12/samples/">500 million years younger</a> than the rocks collected on Apollo 11.</p>
      <p>
        <b>10. The third man on the moon’s first word was "Whoopie!”</b>
      </p>
      <p>Conrad’s first words on the moon didn’t come close to Neil Armstrong’s “one small step” or Buzz Aldrin’s “magnificent desolation.” Instead he let out a high-pitched “whoopie!” and said “That may have been a small one for Neil, but that's a long one for me.”</p>

      </figure>
      <p>As part of the backup crew for what became Apollo 9, astronaut Clifton C. “C.C.” Williams should have been on Apollo 12 instead of Alan Bean. However, Williams was killed on October 5, 1967 when his T-38 aircraft crashed in Florida. In his honor the Apollo 12 crew included four stars on their mission patch, and his naval aviator wings were placed on the surface of the moon.</p>
