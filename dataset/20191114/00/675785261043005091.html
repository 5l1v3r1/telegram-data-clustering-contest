      <p>The John Lewis Christmas advert 2019 is dropping today - and we can reveal that the music in this year's iconic advert is a cover of the 1984 classic Can't Fight This Feeling.</p>
      <p>Originally performed by the American rock band REO Speedwagon, the song has been given a new lease of life thanks to Bastille frontman Dan Smith, who has recorded the cover specially for John Lewis.</p>
      <p>REO Speedwagon first released the track on their 1984 album Wheels Are Turnin'. It also shows up on a number of the band's greatest hits albums, thanks to its position at the top of the charts in the US - although it only reached number 16 in the UK.</p>

      <p>The band even performed Can't Fight This Feeling at the 1985 Live Aid concert, and it has since cropped up in TV shows, films and adverts from South Park and Stranger Things to an ad for Sheba cat food.</p>
      <p>There were two versions of the music video originally made - the first features footage that seems to be homemade, of the band performing in the studio.</p>

      <p>Pianist Kevin Cronin jokes around and pretends he can't find the right key to start the song in, then the music kicks in and Kevin says: "That warmed the cockles of my cockles."</p>
      <p>The second version of the video was directed by John Jopson and features a baby in the opening scene, before the video cuts to the band.</p>
      <p>It's likely Dan Smith's version of the song will challenge other contenders for the number one spot in the charts when the John Lewis advert drops online later this morning.</p>

      <p>Lily Allen and Gabrielle Aplin both topped the charts with their respective John Lewis soundtracks, in 2013 and 2012, while Tom Odell's Real Love reached number 7.</p>
      <p>Elton John, who both starred and performed in 2018's Rocketman-inspired commercial, saw his hit track Your Song swing up the charts again to number 7.</p>
      <p>This year's advert sees a little green dragon called Edgar hide away after causing destruction and ruin through his fire-breathing excitement.</p>
      <p>He's finally tempted out by his best friend, who gifts him a Christmas pudding to enjoy at the village feast.</p>
      <p>The ad will be released online this morning, and will air in full for the first time on Saturday evening during the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/x-factor">X Factor</a> : Celebrity break on ITV.</p>
