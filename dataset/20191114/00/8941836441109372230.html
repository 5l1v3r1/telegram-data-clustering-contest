        <b>ANALYSIS/OPINION:</b>
      </p>
      <p>So former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg have thrown their hats in the 2020 presidential ring (“Former Mass. Gov. Deval Patrick enters 2020 presidential race,” Web, Nov. 14). My reaction to the first candidate is, Who are you? My reaction to candidate number two is, Are you stupid?</p>
      <p>Do these unpopular, unenergetic individuals who enter presidential races do it to lose money? Are their egos so big that they actually believe they have a chance? Have they ever left their bubbles to put their thumbs on the pulse of the American people? I question their judgment and mental health, because obviously their common sense doesn’t exist. Please, by all means, waste your time and money.</p>
