      <p><b>Hyundai</b> has confirmed production of its <b>Santa Cruz</b> ute will start for North America <b>in 2021</b>.</p>
      <p>The brand has stopped short of confirming the development of a workhorse in the past, but Hyundai has previously said we're likely to see a ute of some variety in Australia <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/793821/hyundai-ute-due-in-2022-or-2023-with-australian-input/">during 2022 or 2023</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/hyundai/">Hyundai</a> also wouldn't confirm whether the US market Santa Cruz is the same ute we'll be offered Down Under, telling <i>CarAdvice: "</i>We look at the suitability of all international products for the Australian market and Santa Cruz is no different, we are currently studying the business case."</p>
      <p>Recently-replaced Hyundai Australia CEO JW Lee has previously described a pickup as "<a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/793821/hyundai-ute-due-in-2022-or-2023-with-australian-input/">necessary for the Australian market</a>", where the <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/toyota/hilux/">Toyota HiLux</a> and <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/ford/ranger/">Ford Ranger</a> dominate the sales charts.</p>
      <p>However Mr Lee, <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/807276/hyundai-australia-jun-heo-ceo/">who was earlier this week replaced</a>, said Hyundai is yet to work out exactly what form its ute will take.</p>

      <p>The Santa Cruz concept revealed in 2015 was a lifestyle-focused vehicle based on the <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/hyundai/tucson/">Tucson SUV</a>, something that wouldn't necessarily cut it in the Australian market – where a braked-towing capacity of 3500kg and a payload of around 1000kg and off-roading ability are a prerequisite.</p>
      <p>Although it has confirmed production for the USA market, Hyundai offered no further details about its upcoming ute.</p>
      <p>A team of experts from Hyundai recently visited Australia to study the ute market, having been to other Asian countries and the Middle East.</p>
      <p>This shows that Hyundai hasn't locked in the design, size, engines and global manufacturing locations for its ute, meaning it has a long road ahead to develop one of the most complex vehicle types in the automotive world.</p>

      <p>"There are still many areas we need to explore – 4x4, 4x2, single-cab, dual-cab," JW Lee told <i>CarAdvice </i>earlier this year.</p>
      <p>"Those areas are yet to be decided. We are going to develop this pick-up for various markets. Each market has different demands. I think the researchers need to study more to come to a final decision [regarding] which way we go."</p>
      <p>It's unlikely Hyundai would build a ute for the Australian market in the USA. It could, however, produce the vehicle at its Jeonju plant in South Korea.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, it could establish a manufacturing facility in Thailand, where most of Australia's best-selling utes are made, including the Toyota HiLux, Ford Ranger, Holden Colorado, Nissan Navara, Isuzu D-Max and Mazda BT-50.</p>

      <p>Hyundai has an annual sales target of about 15,000 vehicles, which would put it on par with the Mazda BT-50.</p>
