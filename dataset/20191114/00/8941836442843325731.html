      <h1>Woman arrested after criticizing Egypt’s president</h1>

      <p>CAIRO (AP) - Egyptian authorities have arrested a woman who voiced harsh criticism of President <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/abdel-fattah-el-sissi/">Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi</a> and his wife in a series of online videos, police and judicial officials said on Thursday, as the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/egyptian-government/">Egyptian government</a> prepared to defend its human rights record during a major U.N. rights review.</p>
      <p>Radwa Mohamed was arrested at her house on Wednesday evening and accused of spreading false news, according to officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to brief the media.</p>
      <p>In recent weeks, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mohamed-zaree/">Mohamed</a> appeared in several videos on YouTube where she dismissed <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/abdel-fattah-el-sissi/">el-Sissi</a> as an “unsuccessful” president and mocked <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/egypt/">Egypt</a>’s first lady Instissar el-Sissi. Using profane language, the videos denounced the misuse of public funds and deplored her country’s poor human rights records. Her videos have been viewed by tens of thousands.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mohamed-zaree/">Mohamed</a>’s videos recall the viral posts of the self-exiled Egyptian businessman, Mohamed Ali, that provoked scattered protests in Cairo and several provinces in September. Security forces arrested at least 3,000 people following the anti-government demonstrations, according to rights groups.</p>
      <p>Ali, a contractor who said he had worked with the Egyptian military for 15 years, accused <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/abdel-fattah-el-sissi/">el-Sissi</a> of corruption and called for his overthrow. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/abdel-fattah-el-sissi/">El-Sissi</a> dismissed the accusations as sheer lies.</p>

      <hr/>
      <p>In one of her videos, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mohamed-zaree/">Mohamed</a> warned that another outburst of public anger could end <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/abdel-fattah-el-sissi/">el-Sissi</a>’s rule. “I cannot recognize you as a president. Down with your rule,” she said in another posting.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mohamed-zaree/">Mohamed</a>’s arrest comes as the U.N. is holding its periodic review of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/egypt/">Egypt</a>’s human rights record in the Swiss capital, Geneva.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, representatives of several Western countries, including the U.S., the U.K. and Germany, called for Cairo to investigate accusations of torture and enforced disappearances.</p>
      <p>The Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies also accused the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/egyptian-government/">government</a> on Wednesday of silencing human rights advocates by continuing to bar them from travelling abroad.</p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p>The rights group called for the immediate lifting of the “unjust” travel ban imposed on dozens of Egyptian rights activists.</p>
        <p>“The state is scared that someone would go to Geneva with a different narrative about human rights in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/egypt/">Egypt</a> than the one it is propagating,” said <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mohamed-zaree/">Mohamed Zaree</a>, a rights activist with the Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies, who has been subject to a travel ban since 2016.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, an <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/egyptian-government/">Egyptian government</a> delegation addressed the U.N. Human Rights Council saying that “long strides” had been taken toward fulfilling “more of the aspirations, rights and freedom” of its people.</p>
        <p>The U.N. Human Rights Council will draft recommendations regarding <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/egypt/">Egypt</a>’s human rights situation following the meetings in Geneva.</p>
        <p>The country’s rights record under President <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/abdel-fattah-el-sissi/">Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi</a> has drawn growing international criticism following a crackdown on dissent and media freedoms.</p>
