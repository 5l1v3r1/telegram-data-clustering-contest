        <b>Lithuanian National Defence Minister Raimundas Karoblis has emphasised that European Union’s (EU) defence projects should be open to NATO allies from outside the EU to join in.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The <a href="https://kam.lt/en/news_1098/current_issues/we_will_ensure_quality_of_the_european_union_defence_projects_by_allowing_nato_allies_to_join_in_r._karoblis_says.html">Lithuanian National Defence Ministry wrote in a press release</a> that on Tuesday, November 12, Karoblis took part in a meeting of EU defence ministers, where they discussed EU’s permanent structured cooperation (PESCO).</p>
      <p>It is an instrument laid out in the Treaty of Lisbon, for deepening the cooperation in security and defence area for those EU member states that have military capabilities meeting higher criteria and are bound by greater commitments.</p>
      <p>«We have to make sure that flexible rules are provided for third states, especially NATO allies, to take part in PESCO projects because only participation of NATO allies can ensure quality implementation of prioritized PESCO projects, such as concerning military mobility or cybersecurity, and proper level of cooperation and transparency,» R. Karoblis pointed out.</p>
      <p>34 PESCO projects are currently underway, including Lithuania’s project on EU Cyber Rapid Response Teams (CRRTs) and Mutual Assistance in Cyber Security, one of the most significantly progressed PESCO projects, according to the ministry.</p>
