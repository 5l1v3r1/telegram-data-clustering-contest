      <p>The Regina Pats are to face the Swift Current Broncos on Tuesday in a rescheduled WHL game. Face-off is set for 7 p.m., at the Brandt Centre.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/hockey/regina-pats/fridays-pats-broncos-game-postponed-due-to-ice-plant-issue">The game was to have been played last Friday, only to be postponed due to a malfunction with the ice plant.</a>
      </p>
      <p>On Wednesday, the Pats announced that they had acquired forward Carter Chorney, 18, from Swift Current for defenceman Sam McGinley, 17.</p>
      <p>Chorney — a second-round pick of the Spokane Chiefs in the 2016 bantam draft — compiled 14 goals and 26 points in 62 games with Spokane and Swift Current last season. The 6-foot-1, 171-pounder has one goal and five points in 17 games this season.</p>
      <p>“We are looking forward to Carter joining our team,” Pats GM John Paddock said in a media release. “He brings some good ability to our forward group.”</p>
      <p>McGinley — a fifth-round pick in 2017 — has no points in eight games as a WHL rookie this season.</p>
