      <h1>Hallelujah For These Photos Singing The Praises Of Body Rolls</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T00:00:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Sadhbh O'Sullivan</a></address>
      <p>"The parts of ourselves we’ve been taught to hate should not just be pointed out, they should be rolled in (eco) glitter, covered in highlighter and shown the same adoration that 'traditionally' beautiful people are treated with every day."</p>
      <p>This is exactly what Ione Gamble, the editor-in-chief of <a href="https://polyesterzine.com/"><i>Polyester</i> zine</a>, together with beauty editor Mona Leanne and photographer Jender Anomie, do in their fifth anniversary issue "Beauty". It's one of four zines they are releasing to celebrate five years of encouraging us all, in their words, "to have faith in your own bad taste".</p>
      <p>One of the best features in "Beauty"? There are too many to choose from, but <i>Heavenly Bodies</i> – where fat bodies are literally transformed into a canvas, one covered in angelic cherubim, another in celestial iconography – is certain to be a firm favourite.</p>
      <p>Ione says that the original idea for the shoot was to transform the models themselves into full-scale cherubs. However, once the time and cost of this big-budget production became apparent, the team scaled down and came up with the idea of using the models' bodies as canvases, "[using the] body's rolls to distort and amplify the cherubs and to use skin and fat as the basis of something heavenly."</p>
      <p>The focus on beauty, for Ione, is complicated: "<i>Polyester</i>'s job as a zine is not to show you all the bits you’ve been taught to hate about yourself and command that you love them. I loathe the influx of 'real' imagery showing marginalised people with bare faces in beige underwear. Rather, I’ve always favoured exploring the radical possibilities of makeup to help us define who we are." This is exactly what they have done with the new issue – pushed the boundaries of how we think about beauty, the joy makeup can bring to our lives and the possibilities it holds when seeking to reframe the way we view ourselves.</p>
      <p>Ahead, Ione gives us an advance look at <i>Heavenly Bodies </i>and reveals which body parts the team used to make their celestial pics.</p>

      <p>"The cherubs were initially Mona’s idea; she was inspired by Andy Warhol’s cherub illustrations and initially wanted to bring them to life full-scale and turn the models themselves into the cherubs. <i>Polyester</i> is still independent and nonprofit, we have a really short lead time and are often working against the clock, so when a big production was no longer possible I started thinking about other ways in which we could use that seed of an idea to create an interesting series. I was chatting to the photographer, Jender Anomie, and had the thought that instead of replicating the cherubs with real bodies, we could use plus-size bodies to create works of art in themselves."</p>

      <p>"We wanted the images to be abstract in the sense that it’s impossible to tell which part of the body is featured in each image. It was important to me that the pictures included a roll of fat of some kind, or a fold in the skin or something similar. The body parts used on the day probably ended up being quite different to what I expected to use initially and was very much trial and error – we used elbows, stomachs, backs, cleavage, armpits and knee folds."</p>

      <p>"It was one of our more straightforward shoot days – usually we have big hair, huge makeup looks and multiple models. We only had a couple of people model for this shoot and it was fun hearing their ideas of where on their bodies could work to create the images. Both the girls kept their temporary tattoos on for the rest of the day too, which I love!"</p>

      <p>"I love the use of colour and texture in the images. Mona is a genius when it comes to experimentation but also putting together combinations of things I would never think of that end up looking amazing. I love how weird the images are but also still really soft and inviting – and how they completely take the body out of context and make the sections a work of art in and of themselves."</p>
