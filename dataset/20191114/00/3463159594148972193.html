      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The goalless draw in Beirut sees Turkmenistan jump to the top of Group H. Lebanon were playing in their 60th World Cup qualifier in history, while it was Korea Republic's six consecutive qualifier without conceding a goal, totaling an impressive 556 minutes.</li>

      </ul>

        <li>A stunning victory for Iraq, who scored in the 92nd minute through Alaa Abbas to move four points clear of their old rivals at the top of Group C. This was Iran's second successive World Cup qualifying defeat - a fate that has befallen them only twice before (in 1974 and 1998).</li>
      </ul>

        <li>Kuwait win convincingly in Kuwait City in what was their 50th victory in 97 World Cup qualifying matches. The result also equals their biggest-ever win in World Cup qualifying history (10-1 v Macau in 1993 and 9-0 v Myanmar in 2015).</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>
        <a href="https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/qatar2022/preliminaries/asia/matches/match/400080759/#match-timeline">Jordan 0-1 Australia</a>
