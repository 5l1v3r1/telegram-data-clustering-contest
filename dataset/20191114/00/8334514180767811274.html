        <figcaption><b>Trump slams impeachment hearings, says he'll release 2nd transcript<br/></b>U.S. President Donald Trump denied on Wednesday testimony from the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine who, while testifying during the first televised hearing of the impeachment inquiry against Trump, linked the president more directly to a pressure campaign on Ukraine to conduct investigations that would benefit him politically.</figcaption>

      <p>The transcript of a July 25 call Trump made with the Ukrainian president in which he asked him to investigate the son of his political rival Joe Biden has become the subject of a Democratic-led impeachment inquiry into the president.</p>
      <p>Trumpâ€™s critics accuse him of withholding almost $400 million in security aid to Ukraine as leverage to pressure Zelenskiy to publicly declare an investigation.</p>
