      <h1>Social Network For Moms Peanut Secures $5 Million In Funding And Launches A Community For Women Trying To Conceive</h1>

      <p>While the Tinders and Bumbles of the world are successful at matching individuals socially, romantically and professionally, there is one demographic that has been grossly underserved: moms. This is what Michelle Kennedy, who helped launch Bumble, discovered when she became a mother five years ago. The London-based mompreneur decided then and there to create a social network for all the moms who, like her, were looking for a platform to connect with other moms and to ask questions about motherhood. Today, <a href="https://www.peanut-app.io/">Peanut</a> boasts one million users and is rolling out an online community for women trying to conceive. "A lot of medical intervention services are being created to address the physical aspect of fertility issues, which is much needed,” said Peanut founder and CEO Michelle Kennedy, in an interview. “But what no one is doing is supporting the psychological process of going through it. Women need a platform to exchange and share as this process can be devastating."  </p>
      <p>The “Trying to Conceive” (TTC) community offers women a secure platform to share their respective experiences with infertility, alternatives to pregnancy and miscarriages. “No woman should ever feel lonely, isolated or muted on such important issues,” added Kennedy. </p>

        <b>Born in 2017</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Peanut app, which officially launched in early 2017, was originally created to match like-minded moms. Users can “wave” to one another by swiping up, or skip the profile by swiping down. Once both moms have waved, they match and can start chatting. Anyone who identifies as a woman can sign up on Peanut for free via Facebook, Apple and Gmail logins – a selfie is required for verification to keep the community safe (and men-free!). </p>
      <p>Users can then create their profile by uploading an image and choosing “packs” that best describe them. Examples include Spiritual Gangster”, “Geek Chic”, “Fashion Killa”, “Sleep Deprived”, “Solo” and “LGBTQ”. Women can also indicate if they are pregnant, how old their children are and where they are based. The algorithms will then search for other moms in the area with similar interests.  </p>
      <p> "The mechanisms and user experience we are using to build Peanut are very different from other social networks as this is tailored to a woman's experience,” said Kennedy. “We don't believe the same platform an 18-year-old boy uses to sell his new Yeezys is the exact same platform a woman who has just suffered a miscarriage should turn to for support. Our platform is about building long-term trust, engagement and relationships and is therefore not transactional." </p>

      <p>Technically speaking, this translates into building features like sentiment analysis to encourage supportive language amongst users, or including sensitive content filters so no woman sees content that can be triggering. </p>
      <p>Kennedy says that the activity on Peanut varies, with about 40% of women looking to "match" with other moms (Discovery) and 60% wanting to explore and chat on forums (Community). The latter figure may well expand now that the TTC community is live. The app is currently available in the U.S., Canada and the UK. </p>

        <b>Hollywood and Silicon Valley</b>
      </p>
      <p>Peanut occasionally works with women in the public eye who support the mission of connecting moms. One such figure is actress and jewelry designer Nikki Reed, who recently posted about the app on her Instagram feed. </p>

      <p>Motherhood is definitely a topic that resonates within the Hollywood community, as can be seen with Jessica Alba’s The Honest Company, Jennifer Garner’s Once Upon a Farm or the recent Baby2Baby gala in Los Angeles, which raised $4.7 million to support families in need by giving basic necessities like diapers and kids clothes.</p>
      <p>Beyond the glitz and glamour of Hollywood, moms have convinced the VC community that motherhood is a viable bet. Top tier investors like New Enterprise Associates (NEA), Greycroft and Sound Ventures backed Peanut’s vision at the seed stage. Across the pond, London-based Index Ventures just joined the roster by injecting $5 million into the startup. </p>
      <p>"This is literally a global market opportunity as all women go through similar stages and challenges in their lives, whether they end up becoming mothers or not," said Index principal Hannah Seal, who led the investment with partner Danny Rimer. </p>
      <p>The successful ascendance of Peanut isn’t surprising considering how massive the market is and how well-versed Kennedy is in social networks. The mother of two worked for several years at dating behemoth Badoo, where she served as the deputy CEO, and was an inaugural board member of Bumble, which was initially backed by Badoo founder Andrey Andreev. (Note: Andreev just sold his stakes in Badoo and Bumble to Blackstone). </p>
      <p>Peanut still has a ways to go to match Bumble’s 75 million users. But, similar to raising a child, scaling a startup takes time. With a total of $9.8 million under her belt, 16 employees and eager moms all around, Kennedy seems to be on the right track. </p>
