      <p>Imagine, for a moment, that a raging fire has broken out on a busy drag in your hometown. Local businesses, a library and essential city buildings are all in danger.A small group of your fellow residents has assembled a "bucket brigade" ready to do whatever it takes to put out the fire. But, sadly, most of the town sits idle, unwilling to provide any help, focusing their energies instead on how much water would be wasted if they were to call the fire department.</p>
      <p>This, oddly enough, is a good analogy for how the ESG (environmental, social and governance) investment community approaches making an impact on climate change. Indeed, it is becoming increasingly clear that it has failed to respond to the most urgent needs of the moment — something that was underscored by climate change activist Greta Thunberg's recent <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/09/23/763452863/transcript-greta-thunbergs-speech-at-the-u-n-climate-action-summit">address</a> at the United Nations Climate Action Summit.</p>
      <p>Her message was clear: Act now, or we'll all be sorry. It was a stirring call to arms, not to mention an encouraging sign that the next generation is poised to do a better job at halting climate change than earlier ones. But what about the people in positions of authority today?</p>
      <p>One way we can contribute is by backing green investing initiatives, a collection of projects available to both retail and institutional investors that can make an immediate impact. Still, if you spend time in traditional ESG investment conferences, you may find that the focus is on navel-gazing instead of action.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Screening And Checklists Versus Real Impact</b>
      </p>
      <p>Too often, asset managers, investment boards and fund consultants seem to spend more time discussing how to measure things instead of trying to enact change. Take, for example, the emphasis among many ESG investors on negative screening, which involves eliminating companies from consideration that fail to conform to their goals. The problem with negative screening is it doesn't tell you where to invest, only where not to.</p>
      <p>ESG investors should want to filter out bad environmental actors. But that effort cannot overshadow the more important task: identifying investments that are capable of making a real impact. In short, we need to put our money where our mouths are.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Toward A More Impactful Future</b>
      </p>
      <p>To make a tangible impact on the future, the ESG community would do well to shift its energies to investing directly in projects and companies that either create more clean-power alternatives or lessen our reliance on existing sources that contribute to climate change.</p>
      <p>Aside from the fact that many of these investments are making a positive difference, they do not force anyone to sacrifice returns. Some of the savviest investors in the world appreciate this, including Warren Buffett, who has backed major <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/16/energy-firm-backed-by-warren-buffett-to-build-wind-farm-in-canada.html">renewable energy</a> projects.</p>
      <p>Why, then, are so many members of the ESG community spending time contemplating metrics versus trying to create value? The answer is rooted in fear. Fund consultants have a hard time evaluating new asset classes, so investment boards adopt a wait-and-see approach.</p>
      <p>Certainly, understanding new asset classes requires hard work and could demand new expertise, which few thought would be necessary concerning renewables or other green investing options only a couple years ago, when the consensus was that they were a short-term, niche fad. That's changed. And, of course, measurement is undoubtedly necessary and proper for financial professionals — but it should not become a replacement for doing the work of finding investments that actually make an impact.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Time Is Not On Our Side With Climate Change</b>
      </p>
      <p>Combating climate change requires immediate action. The financial services industry includes some of the most highly educated people in the country, so collectively, we have the intellectual horsepower to figure this out. However, what we do not have collectively is the courage to break out of our shells and do anything about it.</p>
      <p>Asset managers, investment boards and other asset allocators should work to make sure fund consultants and advisors understand why these investments are crucial to the future. That, in turn, will open them up to a broader range of investors. At the same time, ESG conferences must focus more attention on investment strategies, not on tracking error, negative screening and greenwashing.</p>
      <p>Borrowing a page from Greta Thunberg and other young climate activists, the green investing movement must seize this opportunity before it's too late. In her words, "Why should I be studying for a future that soon may be no more, when no one is doing anything to save that future?"</p>
