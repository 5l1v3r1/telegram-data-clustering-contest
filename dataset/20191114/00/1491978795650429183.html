        <i>Returns to shareholders at UK’s top 100 firms surged by 56% in 2014-18 as wages rose by 9%</i>
      </p>
      <p>Shareholder payouts at Britain’s biggest companies have risen more than six times faster than workers’ wages since 2014, according to a study that shows how investors have won <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/aug/19/global-dividends-new-high-slower-growth-rise-financial-technology">the largest slice of company profits in recent years</a>.</p>
      <p>Returns to shareholders at FTSE 100 companies increased by 56% between 2014 and 2018, while wages edged up by just 8.8%, the report says. Firms maintained shareholder dividends and share buybacks <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jun/22/investors-demand-dividends-push-us-to-disaster-corporate-borrowing">“regardless of company performance”</a> through good times and bad.</p>
      <p>The drinks maker Diageo and the luxury retailer Burberry were among the companies to pay more in combined dividends and buybacks than they generated in net income.</p>
      <p>Some businesses, including the aerospace engine-maker Rolls-Royce and the commercial property owner Land Securities, even paid returns to shareholders when they made a loss, leading to accusations that Britain’s corporate sector has become focused on protecting shareholder benefits at the expense of long-term investments and workers’ wages.</p>
      <p>According to analysis by the TUC and the High Pay Centre thinktank, the UK’s top 100 companies generated £551bn in profit and returned £442bn to shareholders in dividends and buybacks in the five financial years to 2018 – equivalent to £1.7bn a week.</p>
      <p>The report found that FTSE 100 shareholders received £123bn in dividends and share buybacks in 2018, compared with £79bn in 2014.</p>
      <p>“This amounts to a 56% nominal increase in returns to shareholders, which is 6.4 times the 8.8% rise median wages for UK workers over the five years,” the report says.</p>
      <p>“If pay across the UK economy had kept pace with shareholder returns, the average worker would now be over £9,500 better off.”</p>
      <p>The TUC said the findings showed that reforms were urgently needed to directors’ duties and the composition of boards, which should include greater representation from the workforce.</p>
      <p>The TUC general secretary, Frances O’Grady, said corporate rules were “tilted in favour of wealthy shareholders and executives while families struggle to make ends meet”.</p>
      <p>The union group proposed banning dividend payments unless the employer adopts a “living wage”, which would mean raising the minimum pay of low-income workers. Company law should also be rewritten to downgrade the “primacy of shareholders” and introduce a broader list of aims that set workers’ interests alongside those of shareholders, suppliers, customers and local communities.</p>
      <p>The High Pay Centre’s executive director, Luke Hildyard, said Britain’s corporate culture prioritised shareholders over investments in the workforce, new equipment and protecting the environment.</p>
      <p>“We won’t raise living standards in the UK without a change of business culture. Boards remain too focused on generating short-term returns for wealthy investors, but are not doing enough to address their responsibilities to their workers, the environment and wider society,” he said.</p>
      <p>The report added: “The consequence of excessive rewards to shareholders is less money available for investment in long-term, organic growth, wages, R&amp;D, training and steps that would reduce environmental impact.”</p>
      <p>Official figures show that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/22/uk-pay-growth-employment-weekly-earnings">employment has climbed to record highs in the years since the 2008 financial crash</a> and unemployment has dropped to its lowest level since the 1970s.</p>
      <p>However, business investment has increased only modestly over the last 10 years and productivity growth, as measured by a worker’s output per hour, has averaged less than 1% a year in that time compared with more than 2% a year in the 20 years before 2008.</p>
      <p>Wages increased strongly in 2019 to hit an annual growth rate of 4%, but the rise is expected to be short lived and in September annual increases in wages had already fallen back to 3.6%.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/apr/15/dividend-income-holders-uk-shares-bhp">Figures from the data provider Link Asset Services</a> earlier this year showed that dividends paid to holders of all UK shares jumped almost 16% to a record high in the first three months of the year, putting investors on track for £100bn in payouts this year.</p>
