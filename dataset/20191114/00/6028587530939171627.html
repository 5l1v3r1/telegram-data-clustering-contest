      <h1>Tricky Words: New Google Search Feature Teaches Pronunciation</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T00:00:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">David Beasley</a></address>
      <p>Google today <a href="https://blog.google/products/search/how-do-you-pronounce-quokka-practice-search/">unveiled</a> an experimental search feature that can tutor you on how to pronounce tricky words.Previously, when you searched for something on Google, you could play an audio and hear how the word is pronounced. But that was no guarantee it would sound the same way when it left your lips. The new feature allows you not just to hear the word, but to practice saying it into the microphone on your phone. It provides feedback on how to improve the pronunciation. You can practice for as long as it takes to get it right.</p>
      <p>For now, the feature is in American English only but Spanish will be added soon.</p>
      <p>The new feature also includes images to help users better understand the meaning of words.</p>
      <p>“This can be useful with words that have multiple meanings like ‘seal’, or words like ‘avocado’ that aren’t commonly used in all languages or regions,” Google said.</p>
      <p>Google said it is starting with images that illustrate nouns, and will expand from there.</p>
