      <p>Borderlands 3 has resisted the siren’s song of post-launch monetization since launch two months ago, and now when it finally <i>is</i> going to start selling something, it appears to be what it’s always sold, meaty, paid DLC.Today, Gearbox <a href="https://borderlands.com/en-US/news/2019-11-14-borderlands-3-dlc-1-reveal-tune-in/">has revealed</a> the first teaser trailer for Borderlands 3’s initial DLC offering, where more details about it will be dropped during The Borderlands Show on November 20th.</p>
      <p>The brief teaser seems to tease a return to Handsome Jack’s perfect city of the future, Opportunity. We see a lot of Jack’s face (statues, holograms), though not the man himself, so don’t go starting to predict a resurrection just yet. But anything’s possible. A voiceover has Moxxi saying “Ready to bring down the house, sugar?” which implies that she’s a part of the proceedings as well.</p>
      <p>Most Borderlands 3 seem to like the game overall, though a common complaint is that new villains Tyreen and Troy simply don’t stack up to the all-time great Handsome Jack. Jack is dead, but he has lookalikes, the AI featured in Tales from the Borderlands, and hell, he even voices a <i>gun</i> in the current game. So who knows how he could return. Or this just could be a new story with alive characters told in his city. Though it would be weird to get Opportunity-focused DLC without him.</p>
      <p>We will learn more about this in less than a week during The Borderlands Show, which will also debut a lot more information about the upcoming Maliwan Takedown, the new raid-like activity that will arrive with new loot and Mayhem 4 difficulty, and is reportedly still scheduled for later this month.</p>
      <p>These Borderlands Show episodes usually seem to be airing about a month or so before the content goes live, so it stands to reason that we may see Borderlands 3’s first DLC in December, three months or so after launch, which does not seem unreasonable. I know players are itching for DLC above everything else, and I can’t wait to hear more details soon enough.</p>
      <p>Borderlands 3 does have its ongoing issues, but it does seem like it has what it takes to live a long life like its predecessors, especially since it seems to be following the same format of DLC boosts, and not abandoning that concept like say, Grand Theft Auto did.</p>
      <p>One significant change is that the DLC will <i>not</i> introduce any new vault hunters, which will disappoint some fans, but we’ll see what else it’s bringing shortly.</p>
