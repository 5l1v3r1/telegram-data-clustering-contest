      <h1>THE MANDALORIAN Could Possibly Get the Feature Film Treatment</h1>

      <p>The majority of<b><i> Star Wars</i></b> fans are flipping over the first episode of <b><i>The Mandalorian</i></b> series and how great it is. The hype surrounding the show seems to have met the expectations of the fans, and the future of the series is exciting! Well, it turns out that this series could lead to bigger things.</p>
      <p>According to Disney Co-Chairman <b>Alan Horn</b>, <i>The Mandalorian</i> could end up making its way to the big screen as a feature film at some point. He explained:</p>
      <blockquote>"The Mandalorian is already proving to be a big thing, so if that series proves to be so compelling that we reverse engineer it into a theatrical release, a two-hour film or whatever, ok.”</blockquote>
      <p>Hell, yeah! If they wanted to continue the story of <i>The Mandalorian</i> as a movie, of course I’d watch it! As of right now, Lucasfilm and writer, producer, and director <b>Jon Favreau </b>are currently shooting the second season. So, if a Mandalorian film did happen one day, it wouldn’t be for a while. In the meantime, I’m just going to enjoy watching the story of the series unfold.</p>
      <p>What do you think about the possibility of <i>The Mandalorian</i> coming to the big screen?</p>
