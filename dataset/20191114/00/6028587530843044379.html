      <h1>Meet The Young Inventors Of Sustainability At 2019 Dyson Awards</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T00:00:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Emanuela Barbiroglio</a></address>
      <p>The annual award scheme run by the James Dyson Foundation announced the international winner of 2019 edition today. The inventor Lucy Hughes will receive £30,000 in prize money to develop MarinaTex, a bioplastic made from natural ingredients.Inspired by the work of the British inventor, industrial designer and founder and chief executive of Dyson Ltd, James Dyson, the award “celebrates, encourages and inspires the designers of new problem-solving ideas.”</p>
      <p>When it comes to sustainability, here are the products imagined by Hughes and other students selected as national winners.</p>
      <p>
        <b>MarinaTex</b>

      </figure>
      <p>This is a translucent and flexible sheet material made from waste fish that can be used instead of plastic film.</p>
      <p>Hughes, product design graduate at Sussex University, said she “wanted to start with using waste as a resource”. In particular, when she found out that the UK alone produce over 492,000 tonnes of fish waste annually and that by 2050 the ocean will contain more plastic than fish, she looked for a solution and started by grinding scales in her kitchen. “Once I had come up with the basic material, I continued to experiment to see if it could be used as a food wrapping, or for other uses, and to see how biodegradable it is,” Hughes said.</p>
      <p>MarinaTex can be used as a home-compostable alternative to plastic packaging. It is also stronger, safer and much more sustainable than plastic. The production does not require much energy and uses temperatures below 100 degrees.</p>
      <p>“The James Dyson Award received some thought-provoking ideas this year – and more female entrants than ever – making the judging very difficult,’ Dyson commented on her victory. “Ultimately, we decided to pick the idea the world could least do without. MarinaTex elegantly solves two problems: the ubiquity of single-use plastic and fish waste.”</p>

        <b>YUNA</b>
      </p>

      </figure>
      <p>This is an anchor buoy, with a filtering technology that can gather and reduce microplastics.</p>
      <p>A student design driven community from Universitat Politècnica de Valencia designed it to eradicate the issue along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea. They have been inspired by the anatomy and shape of the ocean sunfish, so the micro-plastics will be collected by the buoy according to the sea currents. The system is formed by a few filters from higher to lower grammage, with active charcoal and other agents for picking even the tiniest particles. Once microplastics are filtered, they will be reused so that they don't return to the sea. The buoy will be made with polythene because its degradation doesn't pollute the environment thus, creating a circular and sustainable product.</p>

        <b>Jerry</b>

      <p>The Jerry Can Water Filter is a gravity-based system that does not require any electricity.</p>
      <p>When the can is placed on its side, water pressure pushes the contaminated water through three separate filters. The foam pre-filter removes the largest particles such as dirt and sand. Following, the micro-membrane filter removes 99.99% of bacteria and parasites from the water. Thirdly, the activated carbon removes chemicals such as chlorine and improves the taste of water.</p>
      <p>It was created by Olivier de Gruijter, from Delft University of Technology (Netherlands). Based on cost estimations, the filter can be produced for $3-4, making it one of the cheapest water filters currently available.</p>

        <b>SolMate</b>
      </p>

        <figcaption>Main use case of SolMate (balcony installation)<cite>The James Dyson Foundation</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>“The first smart plug-and-play photovoltaic and storage system for city dwellers and tenants,” SolMate is also the first mini-photovoltaic system worldwide with an integrated energy storage and aims at accelerating the transition to sustainable energy.</p>
      <p>It was developed by Chris Götze and Winfried Werthmann of FH Joanneum Graz (Austria).  Based on the patented measurement technology “Net Detection” invented by the start-up company Efficient Energie Technologie (EET), SolMate is able to measure the current energy consumption of any household and feed it with self-generated solar energy.</p>
      <p>The system consists of several lightweight photovoltaic panels and a compact storage unit. The self-generated electricity flows directly into the in-house power grid and is made available throughout the entire apartment. If no electricity is consumed, SolMate stores the electricity in the compact energy-storage unit for later.</p>
      <p>Besides the physical product development, this project also encompassed the complete design of the MySolMateApp.</p>
