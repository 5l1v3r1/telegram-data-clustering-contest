      <h1>Seth Rollins calls out CM Punk after surprise return to WWE</h1>
      <h2>Rollins had a simple message for former two-time champion after he made an unannounced appearance on WWE Backstage following spell in MMA</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T00:37:26+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 00:37</time> by <a rel="author">Gareth Bicknell</a></address>
      <p>Seth Rollins has wasted no time in calling out CM Punk after the former two-time champion's surprise return to WWE.</p>
      <p>WWE legend Punk <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/other-sports/wrestling/inside-details-cm-punks-wwe-20871223">stunned fans by making an unannounced appearance</a> on Tuesday night’s episode of WWE Backstage, on FS1 in the US.</p>
      <p>He is understood to have signed a lucrative deal for a role as a special contributor and analyst - but his sensational return to WWE after five years away has sparked furious speculation that will return to the squared circle.</p>
      <p>And Rollins responded to Punk's return with a two-word message on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> , simply saying: "Fight Me."</p>
      <p>Broadcaster Fox replied to his tweet, saying "Talk it over on <a href="https://twitter.com/WWE">@WWE</a> Backstage", with Rollins writing back to say "Glad to do it. Book me a flight."</p>

      <p>Punk has previously said <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/other-sports/wrestling/cm-punk-opens-up-what-20659031">it would take 'a very big bag'</a> to entice him into returning to the ring, having left WWE on bad terms after his contract was terminated back in 2014.</p>
      <p>His role with WWE Backstage was negotiated through broadcaster Fox rather than through the wrestling franchise, according to <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2862531-seth-rollins-to-cm-punk-after-wwe-backstage-appearance-fight-me">Bleacher Report</a> .</p>
      <p>But there is no doubt that a match-up with Rollins could prove a huge pay-per-view draw.</p>
      <p>After walking out of the company, Punk - real name Phil Brooks - was suspended for two months and claims he was never contacted by WWE when his suspension had ended.</p>

      <p>WWE chief executive <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/vince-mcmahon">Vince McMahon</a> later apologised on television for the manner in which Punk's time with the brand had come to an end, but the wrestler rejected the apology and was adamant he would "never ever" return to the sport.</p>
      <p>He then made a highly-anticipated transition to the Octagon, signing a multi-fight deal with the UFC.</p>
      <p>He lost his first bout to Micky Gall in 2015 and last year was defeated by Mike Jackson. That effectively signalled the end of his MMA career after UFC chief Dana White announced Punk would probably never fight for the company again.</p>
      <p>He has since done commentary for Cage Fury Fighting Championship.</p>
      <p>Then speculation of a return to WWE finally came to fruition when he appeared on WWE Backstage on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Punk , 41, arrived as the show approached its conclusion and entered to the sounds of his iconic “Cult of Personality” entrance music which he used throughout his storied career.</p>
      <p>“It’s as simple as this: Just when they think they’ve got the answers, I change the culture,” Punk told the camera, before adding: “I’ll see you here next week.”</p>
