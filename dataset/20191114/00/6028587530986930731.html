          <i>Credit Cards Have Gone Out of Style in China. Will the U.S. be Far Behind?</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Imagine opening Instagram not to post a photo or comment on someone's story, but instead to pay for your groceries. That's what more than 1 billion people in China do. Except instead of using Instagram or other popular social media outlets in America, they open up WeChatPay and Alipay to scan QR codes to pay for goods in place of a traditional checkout. WeChatPay is the Chinese equivalent of Facebook. AliPay is the Chinese equivalent of Amazon. Together these two platforms account for $41 trillion in transactions annually.

      <p>American Express says it absorbed a blow from JPMorgan's premium card, and is better for it. While AmEx initially lost customers after JPMorgan Chase introduced the popular Sapphire Reserve card in 2016, the firm said it has seen a 60% increase in growth in Platinum accounts after it added new benefits and perks the following year. More than half of new Platinum card customers are under the age of 35.

          <i>Goldman Hands Out $10 Billion in Credit Lines for Apple Card</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Goldman Sachs leaders have been coy about backing up their recent assertion that the Apple card is the industry's most successful credit card launch ever. Regulatory filings this week offer a first glimpse into the numbers that had the bank gushing. After a full roll-out of the card last quarter, credit lines the bank has extended to Apple customers totaled about $10 billion as of Sept. 30. The credit card is part of Goldman's recent foray to turn its attention to Main Street consumers after more than a century of catering to large corporations and big investors.

      <p>While it has struggled in the past to convert its success online into a presence in physical retail stores, PayPal is planning another go at it. CEO Dan Schulman said that the company will make new efforts starting next year under both the PayPal and Venmo brands. Schulman said that Paypal didn't have much to offer as a simple alternative to a credit card, but it can offer more in a world where people want to use reward points, split payments or even bypass the checkout line entirely.
