      <p>Being a streamer and/or gaming YouTuber is as realistic today as it has ever been. The number of success stories are countless. I’ve been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkvdORoTf3y30v0T0hb2KNg?view_as=subscriber">a YouTuber</a> with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkEJGHfwq3xS9z8-XPpAccg">multiple channels</a> for more than seven years, and I’ve gone through a bevy of equipment along this journey. With so many people looking to get into the hobby/career, it’s possible a start-up kit might make a good gift for someone on your Christmas list.</p>
      <p>If that’s the case, here is a list of key items you can get for your aspiring streamer/YouTuber. It’s possible you’ll find some quality Black Friday deal for each of these items.</p>
      <h4>Logitech BRIO - $199</h4>

      <h3>Logitech Brio</h3>
      <p>
        <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8842431/type/dlg/sid/11142019giftguideforstreamersBrianfranchiseplay/https://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/brio">SHOP NOW</a>
      </p>
      <p>Logitech Brio is an affordable 4K webcam that is perfect for streamers and YouTubers.</p>
      <p>When it comes to streaming or doing high-quality YouTube videos, you’ll want to make sure you look good to your viewers. That begins and ends with the camera. While many smartphones have cameras that will do more than enough for Vloggers and talking heads, streamers who keep themselves on the screen during gaming and other content that requires them to entertain or inform at a console or computer might need a webcam.</p>
      <p>Let’s be honest, most webcams force you to sacrifice clarity or that sharpness most of us want to deliver to our audience. After using the Logitech Brio, I can say I’m getting the best on-screen quality I’ve ever had from a webcam.</p>
      <p>At $199, it’s a little pricier than most webcams, but that’s because it offers true 4K video quality in most situations, and when it does scale back to 1080p or 720p for non-ultra HD video calling, the look is still clean. For a picture-in-picture look during gameplay, your aspiring streamer should be thrilled with the quality.</p>
      <p>The other aspect of the Logitech Brio package that I really enjoy is the Logi capture software. It’s much more intuitive than some of the other Logitech software I’ve used with their cameras in the past. It allows you to use two different sources and some other cosmetic customization options. It’s free to download on <a href="https://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/options">the website</a> and can be used with all or most of their cameras, including the BRIO.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The LS50X Snoop Dogg Limited Edition headset looks to continue the strong tradition of Lucid Sounds headsets.</p>
      <p>I haven’t had a chance to test these promising headsets out yet, as they aren’t released and there will be only 3,500 individually-numbered versions of the unit available at LucidSounds.com and <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=zmNbNw6aNM4&amp;mid=24348&amp;u1=11142019giftguideforstreamers1Brianfranchiseplay&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fxbox-one%2Faccessories%2Fheadsets%2Fproducts%2Fxbox-one-ls50x-snoop-dogg-edition-stereo-wireless-gaming-headset%2F11098253.html">GameStop.com</a>.</p>
      <p>I’ve had an opportunity to test the quality of Lucid Sounds headsets in the past, and I’m always pleased with the quality. These Snoop Dogg editions offer a little more, especially for streamers and gamers.</p>

      <p>The headsets are 100% wireless on Xbox One and Windows 10. PlayStation 4 users can use them through Bluetooth. You can switch between devices with the press of a button. It has a 20-hour of rechargeable battery, and a removable mic that would transform the headsets to pure listening devices. The final touch is the inclusion of Snoop Dogg signature voice prompts for different commands.</p>
      <p>This is a pricey option for a headset, and I’ll admit it’s overkill, but they look great. Remember, presentation is huge for gifts, and the quality is likely top notch based on Lucid Sounds’ track record.</p>

      <p>I’ve been using this microphone for a couple of years for voiceovers in gaming content as well as on podcasts. The sound quality is excellent, and the boom arm that comes with it sturdy and flexible.</p>

      </p>
      <p>No streaming or YouTube gaming setup is complete without a capture device, and if you’re on console (PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch) and no manufacturer produces better equipment than Elgato. I’ve used Elgato capture devices since I started my first YouTube channel, and they have evolved over the years.</p>
      <p>The model I’m using currently is the Elgato HD60 S+. My favorite features with this model is 4K60 HDR passthrough and the lag-free option. Being able to capture in 4K allows me to enjoy my games in top visual quality while capturing or streaming. The ability to experience it lag free on my PC monitor enables me to use one screen, rather capturing on one and viewing the gameplay on another.</p>
      <p>Anyone who has ever streamed knows how valuable this option will be during the process.</p>
      <h4>Key Specs</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Input:</b> HDMI (unencrypted)</li>
        <li><b>Output:</b> HDMI (lag-free pass-through)</li>
        <li><b>Passthrough Resolutions:</b> Up to 2160p60 HDR</li>
        <li><b>Capture Resolutions:</b> 2160p 30 fps, 1080p 60 fps HDR, 1080p 60 fps, 1080p 30 fps, 1080i, 720p 60 fps, 576p, 480p</li>
        <li><b>HDR:</b> HDR 10 bit for pass-through and capture (HDR capture is currently only available on Windows)</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>What’s In the Box</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>HD60 S+</li>
        <li>USB 3.0 cable</li>
        <li>HDMI 2.0 cable</li>
      </ul>
      <p>There are a few software application you can add to make thumbnails (some of them are free like <a href="https://www.canva.com/">Canva</a>) and to edit videos like Adobe Premiere (<a href="https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/plans.html?filter=video-audio">which isn’t free</a>), but from an equipment standpoint, everything your aspiring streamer or YouTuber needs is above.</p>
