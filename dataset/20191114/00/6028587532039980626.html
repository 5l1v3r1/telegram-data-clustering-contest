      <p>A new chapter will be added to the Colin Kaepernick saga when the former NFL quarterback returns to the field Saturday for a league sanctioned scouting combine.Early reports indicate that representatives from at least ten teams will be in attendance to watch the former Pro-Bowler perform a number of drills in hopes of making a lasting impression.</p>
      <p>Fans got their last look at Kaepernick durring the 2016 NFL season, and after entering the free-agency market in the spring of 2017, Colin has failed to officially earn a slot on another roster.</p>
      <p>With an unprecedented number of starting quarterbacks sidelined at the moment, the workout comes at a time where many teams are in dire need of answers under center.</p>
      <p>While Kaepernick earning a roster spot on a squad is far from a certainty, sportsbooks have already released odds as to which teams are most likely (or desperate) to sign on a quarterback who’s public image might overshadow his actual on-field performance.</p>

      <p>The Cincinnati Bengals, or “Second Chance U.” as SportsBetting.ag oddsmaker Adam Burns referred to them, currently sit as the most likely destination.</p>
      <p>Cincinnati passed on Kaepernick in the 2011 NFL Draft, opting for QB Andy Dalton instead in a move Bengals’ owner Mike Brown later claimed he regretted.</p>
      <p>Rookie quarterback Ryan Finley recently took over starting duties after Dalton did little more than lead his team to the doldrums of the league standings.</p>
      <p>Now win-less and the likely recipients of the 1st overall pick in the 2020 NFL Draft, the Bengals have more than one option when it comes to finding the signal caller of their future.</p>
      <p>The team can opt to give Finley a fair shot by allowing him to make the adjustment to the league on the back half of a pointless season. Should the rookie fail to impress, the team will have the option to rejuvenate the fan-base by bringing in a fresh face with the top choice in the upcoming draft.</p>
      <p>With all “prison stripes to Tiger stripes” jokes aside, the team has shown an affinity to bring in players with questionable pasts. While Kaepernick’s past isn't peppered with legal troubles, one could argue that he has gone out of his way to become as controversial as possible in hopes of creating a conversation where one shouldn't exist to begin with.</p>
      <p>Owners of a 0-9 record, signing Colin can’t possibly hurt the team any more, and at worst it would keep them relevant in the media for the foreseeable future. Even a slight improvement at the quarterback position would allow them to use their draft picks to add role players who, if the team is able to resign AJ Green, could help retool this franchises depleted options.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Playoff Hopefuls In The Conversation?</b>
      </p>
      <p>As the odds suggest, playoff hopefuls could be the biggest beneficiaries of a new option under center, with sportsbooks also liking the chances of Kap ending up on the Pittsburgh Steelers, Baltimore Ravens, Buffalo Bills or the Oakland Raiders.</p>
      <p>While Big Ben has announced plans to return to the field in 2020, backup QB Mason Rudolph has had nearly an entire season to sharpen his skills as a starter in the league. Pittsburgh also has two more quarterbacks on their depth charts and likely has little need for another option at the position.</p>
      <p>Baltimore is being tossed into the mix likely due to Kaepernicks connection with Ravens’ offensive coordinator Greg Roman who worked with Colin in his prime as a 49er.</p>
      <p>While a reunion might appear to be the equivalent of a sports love story, Roman has since found a new love in the budding Lamar Jackson who is quickly establishing himself as the face of the new guard of league quarterbacks. With RGIII and rookie QB Trace McSorley on the sidelines, this team has use for another arm.</p>
      <p>A move to Buffalo would see Kaepernick reunited with Frank Gore, and the system seems to fit his skill set pretty well, while the Raiders and their move to Las Vegas would see Colin return to his collegiate stomping grounds.</p>
      <p>Gruden prides himself as being a quarterback whisperer, and what better way to cement his reputation than to play part in the reconstruction of a former Super Bowl contender.</p>
      <p>Something sounds poetic about the thought of a new chance with a new team in a new city, but if truth be told, this workout might be nothing more than a way for the league to put a lid on the conversation once and for all.</p>
      <p>Kaepernick was on the decline in his final years, and while his anthem antics became a nationwide talking point, both fans and the league front offices have seen players come back from worse.</p>
      <p>Recent history has proven that teams are willing to turn a blind eye to domestic violence and drug charges if the talent outweighs the media backlash, and fans will eagerly cheer on a convict and don his jersey Sunday afternoon as they dash towards the endzone.</p>
      <p>Interesting how a scoreboard can lead to short term memory loss...</p>
