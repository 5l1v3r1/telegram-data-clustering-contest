      <p>Samsung has poured a ton of cash into developing its QLED TVs over the past few years, and they represent some of the best that TV technology currently has to offer. With a Samsung QLED TV, you’ll get bright, vivid colors with a natural look to them. Thanks to the fact that the TV has local dimming, you’ll have nice, deep black levels too -- which is always a handy touch. </p>
      <p>The TV is pretty smart too. The Q70 TV offers Samsung’s Tizen operating system, which allows you to install your favorite streaming apps and services. It also lets you integrate the device with your preferred smart home ecosystem, thanks to the fact that it’s compatible with Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa.</p>
      <p>The 65-inch model of the TV normally comes at $2,197.99, but it’s currently available for $1,197.99 -- which is an impressive $1,000 off.</p>

      <p>OLED TVs arguably offer an even better image quality than QLED TVs, and Sony makes some of the best. The Sony A8G not only offers an OLED panel, but it’s also super smart. That’s thanks to the fact that the TV has Android TV lt right it, including the much-loved Google Assistant. </p>
      <p>OLED panels look great for a number of reasons. For starters, they offer nice, bright, vivid colors. Beyond that, however, is the fact that OLED panels can switch on and off individual pixels -- meaning that in darker scenes, you’ll get super deep and natural black levels.</p>
