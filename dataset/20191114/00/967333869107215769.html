        <b>Tensions in the Gaza Strip escalated on 31 October when a rocket was launched at Israeli territory from the enclave. Since then, airstrikes have been continuously exchanged between the Israeli defence forces and Islamic Jihad militants.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Islamic Jihad leader Zeyad al-Nakhala has presented the group's terms for an Egyptian-mediated ceasefire with Israel in the Gaza Strip in an interview with Al-Mayadeen TV, Reuters reported. </p>
      <blockquote>"The Islamic Jihad is ready for a ceasefire with Israel on specific conditions — if [Israel] ceases its attacks and assaults on the Gaza Strip and observes agreements on easing the blockade", Nakhalah said live on al Kufiya broadcaster.</blockquote>
      <p>Nakhalah went on to say that it was Israel that began its aggressive actions against Palestinians, which led to the most recent escalation in the area.</p>
      <p>Earlier in the day, the Israeli military reported hundreds of rockets launched from Gaza at Israeli territory, with ''one rocket every seven minutes''.</p>
