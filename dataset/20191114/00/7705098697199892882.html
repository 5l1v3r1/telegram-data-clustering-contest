      <h1>Disney’s Alan Horn Says The Mandalorian Could Get His Own Movie</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T00:23:54+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 00:23</time> by <a rel="author">Jake Abbate</a></address>
      <p>Yesterday, millions of users rang in the launch of Disney+ by downloading the new platform to their mobile devices. Many of these subscribers likely tuned in to watch the first episode of its highly anticipated original series, <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/the-mandalorian"><b>The Mandalorian</b></a>. So far, early reactions to the first live-action <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/star-wars"><b>Star Wars</b></a> show have been generally positive. And if things continue going this way, the title character could have a future on the big screen as well.</p>
      <p>While appearing at <a href="https://variety.com/2019/biz/news/disney-chief-scorsese-marvel-mandalorian-1203403513/">Variety</a>’s Business Managers Breakfast in Beverly Hills, Disney’s chief creative officer and co-chairman Alan Horn addressed <b>The Mandalorian</b>’s recent success. Because of the series’ newfound popularity, he commented on the possibility of Pedro Pascal’s bounty-hunting protagonist showing up in a feature-length movie.</p>
      <h3>RELATED: <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tv/471618-star-pedro-pascal-may-have-revealed-the-mandalorian-real-name">Pedro Pascal May Have Revealed The Mandalorian’s Real Name</a></h3>
      <p>“<b>The Mandalorian</b> is already proving to be a big thing,” said Horn. “So if that series proves to be so compelling that we reverse engineer it into a theatrical release, a two-hour film or whatever, O.K.”</p>
      <p>To be clear, Horn might not be suggesting that Pascal’s character could star in his own standalone film. As <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/2019/11/disney-mandalorian-theatrical-movie-1202189395/">IndieWire</a> notes, his use of the phrase “reverse engineer” comes off as rather ambiguous. It also implies that he’s considering shaving down the first season’s eight episodes into one two-hour package fit for moviegoers. This sort of thing might impress non-Disney+ subscribers. However, it also seems like it would sacrifice too much of the season’s story and character development.</p>
