      <h1>Facebook’s Content Moderation Quiz Lets You Decide Which Posts Violate Policy</h1>

      <p><b>Facebook has</b> officially released a quiz that allows users to play the role of the third-party moderator, deciding which posts have violated the platform’s policy. <br/><b>A Facebook spokesperson</b> has told <a href="https://mashable.com/article/facebook-content-moderator-quiz/?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI"><i>Mashable</i></a> that the posts used for the quiz are actually “based on real posts” but have been modified to “protect user privacy.” <br/><b>For the comfort</b> of the users, the quiz does not include truly violent posts such as those dealing with child labor. However, there is a disturbing picture of the famous “napalm girl” running naked down the streets during the Vietnam War. <br/><b>Some posts</b> used in the quiz include one asking for fictional character King Joffrey to be “stabbed,” and another is a post selling prescription drugs. While the former is allowed as King Joffrey does not really exist, the latter should be banned as the sale is illegal. <br/><a href="https://designtaxi.com/notice.html?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Advertisement</a> <a href="https://designtaxi.com/notice.html?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Advertisement</a> <br/><b>Post indicating</b> a potential suicide attempt is allowed on Facebook as well, as it is a way for victims to call for help. Meanwhile, threats of violence against actual people or groups should be banned. <br/><b>While the quiz</b> contains scenarios that are perhaps easy to decide for the moderator, real life posts can be much more messed up and confusing. <br/><b>You can take</b> the quiz <a href="https://about.fb.com/enforcement/?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">here</a> to test your moderator skills.</p>
