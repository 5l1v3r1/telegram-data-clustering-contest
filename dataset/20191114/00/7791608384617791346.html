      <h1>Watch: Is Apple’s New 16-Inch MacBook Pro With Redesigned Keyboard Worth It?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T00:00:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Thanussha Priyah</a></address>
      <p><b>Apple has launched</b> its latest <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/16-inch?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">16-inch MacBook Pro</a> as a replacement to the 15-inch MacBook Pro, which has now been discontinued. <br/><b>The greatest changes</b> to the laptop involve its keyboard, which now has a physical Esc key to swap for the glitchy touch version in the previous model. While seemingly marginal, Apple users are <a href="https://twitter.com/MacRumors/status/1194610230778306561?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">evidently excited</a> about the add-on, as there is finally a legitimate “panic” button just in case. <br/><b>In addition,</b> Touch ID is now separated from the Touch Bar. The butterfly keyboard, along with sticky keys, is also no longer present. Apple took inspiration from its past models and the 15-inch MacBook Pro to create a refined hybrid keyboard. <br/><b>Another notable change</b> would be the six speakers integrated in the laptop to provide a more professional sound system. The new mic array also offers a “40-percent reduction in hiss and an improved signal-to-noise ratio,” making it a better option for videographers and animators. <br/><b>The MacBook Pro</b> is now thicker by 0.07mm, making it sturdier and giving it more room for better thermals and a larger battery. <br/><b>The new edition</b> is, of course, also more powerful with its 9th-generation Intel Core processors with 6 or 8 cores, giving it allowance of up to 64GB of memory and AMD Radeon Pro 5000M series graphics. <br/><b>Its thermal design</b> presents 28-percent more airflow and 35-percent less heat sink, and the battery has been increased by 100 Watts, allowing up to 11 hours of wireless usage. <br/><a href="https://designtaxi.com/notice.html?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Advertisement</a> <a href="https://designtaxi.com/notice.html?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Advertisement</a> <br/><b>If you’re wondering,</b> yes, the revised MacBook Pro can be <a href="https://designtaxi.com/news/405887/FAA-Bans-Certain-Apple-MacBooks-From-Being-Brought-Onto-All-Flights/">taken onto flights</a>, as it features the highest wattage allowed by airports yet being optimized for better performance and intensive workloads during travels. <br/><b>Though everything sounds</b> great, there are still some issues amiss. For example, users expecting a Micro SD port will be disappointed to know that the 16-inch MacBook Pro still does not have that. Apple has retained the four Thunderbolt 3 ports, with two on each side, but there is truly room for more for creatives always on the go. <br/><b>The 16-inch MacBook</b> Pro with 2.6GHz, 6-Core Processor, 512GB Storage and AMD Radeon Pro 5300M is priced at US$2,399, while the MacBook Pro with 2.3GHz, 8-Core Processor and 1TB Storage and AMD Radeon Pro 5500M is available at US$2,799. <br/><b>In short, if you’re</b> frustrated by the old butterfly keyboard or can’t bring your current MacBook on board flights, this could be a great option. Its improved sound system will also help boost the work process of videographers and animators. <br/><b>Apple is sadly</b> still holding back with the laptop’s availability of ports, though, so if that’s a concern for you, this model might fall short. <br/><b>For a more detailed</b> rundown of the latest MacBook Pro, check out the video below.</p>
