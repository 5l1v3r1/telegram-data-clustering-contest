      <p>NEW DELHI (AP) - <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/india/">India</a>’s <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/supreme-court/">Supreme Court</a> said Thursday it will set law on women’s entry into temples and mosques after being asked to review its decision lifting a ban on some women entering the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/sabarimala-temple/">Sabarimala temple</a> in Kerala state.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/supreme-court/">court</a> deferred a decision on petitions seeking a review of its 2018 ruling to lift a ban on women of menstruating age entering the temple’s grounds.</p>
      <p>Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi said seven judges will take up issues relating to women entering any house of worship.</p>
      <p>Gogoi said the question of whether women of all ages should be allowed into <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/sabarimala-temple/">Sabarimala</a> is part of a larger debate that includes issues like allowing Muslim and Parsi women to enter religious practices and female genital mutilation in the Dawoodi Bohra community.</p>
      <p>“Fresh opportunities to be given to all parties,” he said.</p>

      <p>It wasn’t clear if the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/supreme-court/">court</a> might broaden its consideration of issues regarding women and religion. Gogoi is retiring, so will not among the seven judges weighing the matters.</p>
      <p>The Sabarimala temple bars women age 10 to 50 from its grounds. It says the celibacy of the temple’s presiding deity, Lord Ayyappa, is protected by <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/india/">India</a>’s constitution and women of all ages can worship at other Hindu temples. Some Hindu figures consider menstruating women to be impure.</p>
      <p>When the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/sabarimala-temple/">Sabarimala temple</a>, one of the world’s largest Hindu pilgrimage centers, opened its doors to females of menstruating age after the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/supreme-court/">Supreme Court</a>’s verdict in September last year, women weren’t able to enter as hundreds of protesters fought street battles with police to keep them out.</p>

        <p>Indian courts have been gradually recognizing rights of women, challenging deeply conservative Indian society. It last year scrapped a law which did not allow wives to bring criminal charges against adulterous husbands.</p>
