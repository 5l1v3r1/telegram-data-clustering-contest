      <p>FIFA and the Local Organising Committee announced Tigo as a National Supporter of the <a href="https://www.fifa.com/beachsoccerworldcup/">FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup Paraguay 2019™</a> today. A leading provider of mobile phone services in Paraguay, the company will be supporting the event through its expertise in telecommunications.</p>
      <p>Tigo is committed to investing in the digital transformation of Paraguay through innovative products and services. In 1992, it became the first company to offer mobile phone services in Paraguay, and it is now the market leader in the country, providing coverage to 96 per cent of the nation’s territory. In addition, its pay television network Tigo Sports will be broadcasting the FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup on its channels in Paraguay.</p>
      <p>“We at Tigo Paraguay are pleased to be able to bring such an important competition to all sports fans. Through our investments, we promote the development of different disciplines, in particular football. We want to be partners and to boost the development of sport in our country,” said Gabriela Sacco, Tigo Paraguay’s Marketing Director.</p>
      <p>“Bringing on board local companies with specialist knowledge is key to the success of any FIFA tournament. We’re delighted to have Tigo join our efforts to deliver an exceptional event,” said FIFA’s Director of Marketing Services Jean-François Pathy. “Tigo and FIFA are passionate about sport and about connecting people, so this collaboration is a great fit.”</p>
      <p>The tenth edition of the FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup will be held in Asuncion from 21 November to 1 December. This is the first time that Paraguay will be hosting a FIFA event and the first time that the beach soccer world finals will be held in a landlocked country.</p>
