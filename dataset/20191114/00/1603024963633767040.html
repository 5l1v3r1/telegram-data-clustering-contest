      <p>The Centre may bring its stake in <a href="http://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/refineries/indianoilcorporation/IOC">Indian Oil Corporation</a> (IOC) to below 51 percent, according to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-14/india-is-said-to-mull-cutting-stake-in-indian-oil-to-below-51">report</a> in <i>Bloomberg</i>. The Cabinet is expected to discuss the matter next week.</p>
      <p>Currently, the government owns a 51.5 percent stake in the country's largest oil refiner, with another 25.9 percent ownership via Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) of India, <a href="http://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/oil-drilling-and-exploration/oilnaturalgascorporation/ONG">Oil and Natural Gas Corporation</a> (ONGC) and <a href="http://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/oil-drilling-and-exploration/oilindia/OI13">Oil India Limited</a>, the report said.</p>
      <p>However, the government can continue to have indirect control even after selling as much as a 26.4 percent stake in the entity.</p>
