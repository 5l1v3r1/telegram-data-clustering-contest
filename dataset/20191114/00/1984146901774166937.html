      <p>It's one of the festive season's mostly closely guarded secrets but we now know details of John Lewis' Christmas advert.</p>
      <p>The department store lead the way year after year when it comes to seasonal ad campaigns and this year it has teamed up with Waitrose to tell the tale of Excitable Edgar the dragon.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/whats-on/shopping/john-lewis-christmas-advert-dragon-17252578">The 2019 John Lewis Christmas advert</a> follows on from popular ads from the past including The Bear &amp; The Hare, The Man on the Moon and last year's Elton John life story.</p>
      <p>The song that soundtracks the advert has become just as important as its contents and stars who have previously lent their vocals to <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/john-lewis">John Lewis</a> campaigns include Lily Allen, Ellie Goulding and Elbow, with covers of everything from Keane's Somewhere Only We Know to Randy Crawford's One Day I'll Fly Away being used.</p>
      <p>The song for this year's advert is a cover of REO Speedwagon's epic 80s anthem Can't Fight This Feeling and you'll definitely know the singer - Bastille frontman Dan Smith.</p>
      <h3>When and where to see the advert</h3>
      <p>John Lewis and Waitrose are expected to share the ad across their social media channels from 6am on Thursday, and it first airs on television during ITV's X Factor Celebrity on Saturday November 16.</p>
