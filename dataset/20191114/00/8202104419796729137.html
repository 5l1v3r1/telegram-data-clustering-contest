      <h3>As the Saskatoon Farmers’ Market co-operative <a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/news/local-news/saskatoon-farmers-market-co-op-to-vote-in-a-week-on-building-near-airport">prepares to vote on a new location near the airport</a>, city hall is searching for a tenant for its current home.</h3>
      <p>On Friday, the City of Saskatoon issued a formal request for proposals for an entity to negotiate a five-year lease of the former power plant garage that has been home to the farmers’ market for the last 12 years.</p>
      <p>The Saskatoon Farmers’ Market co-operative membership is set to vote on Saturday on whether or not to support a 10-year lease of part of the Cavendish Building in the Airport Business Area.</p>
      <p>City hall believes the farmers’ market model is “evolving,” according to the 21-page document seeking proposals for the current building, and wants someone to operate an “animated” facility at least six days a week with a farmers’ market component.</p>
      <p>“The city seeks development of the site as a vibrant centre for the community and a destination location that provides dedicated farmers’ market days with verifiable Saskatchewan produce and content,” the document says.</p>
      <p>The co-operative and city council reached an impasse over the future of the group at the city-owned River Landing location. As the document suggests, city hall wants animation at the site six days a week.</p>
      <p>The co-operative operates three days a week at its current spot, offering locally grown food. The group has expressed concern about mixing the farmers’ market operation with a so-called public market that sells food from a variety of sources.</p>
      <p>Adi Ramachandran, president of the co-operative’s board of directors, declined to comment Wednesday on whether the co-operative would submit a proposal to the city, but said the board is not closing any doors.</p>
      <p>“What I can tell you is that this (request for proposals), like the previous one, specifies business activities six days a week, while our last proposal focused on animating the site with a mix of community and business activities,” Ramachandran said in an email.</p>

      <p>Regardless of the outcome of Saturday’s vote, the co-operative’s lease of the city building expires at the end of the year. Ramachandran said the last day for operations at the current site is set for Dec. 22.</p>
      <p>If membership rejects the Cavendish lease, Ramachandran said the co-operative will revert to the temporary site model used prior to 2007. The co-operative says it boasts the largest farmers’ market in the province with about 100 members.</p>
      <p>The city plans to begin repairs to the roof of the building sometime early in 2020 with the goal of completing the work by the spring.</p>
      <p>Those who want to lease the River Landing facility have until Dec. 31 to submit a proposal. A lease agreement is expected by March, according to the document.</p>
      <p>The successful proposal for the building must include a farmers’ market two days a week, year round.</p>
      <p>The lease pertains only to the 13,561-square-foot farmers’ market building at River Landing, although the tenant would get right of first refusal for renting the outdoor market square space from the city.</p>
      <p>The annual lease for the building, like the current deal with the co-operative, will cost $10. The tenant will also have to pay property taxes ($14,139 in 2019) and at least $27,000 a year into a building maintenance reserve fund.</p>
      <p>Ramachandran has said the co-operative’s total costs for the site ran about $100,000 a year.</p>
      <p>The space in the Cavendish Building the co-operative will vote on leasing is just slightly smaller than the River Landing building at 13,266 sq. ft.</p>
