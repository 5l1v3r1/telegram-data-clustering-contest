      <h3>McLaren Elva</h3>
      <p>British exotic car maker McLaren just unveiled its $1.7 million Elva supercar. Its most notable feature: the complete lack of a roof, side windows, or windshield.</p>
      <p>Instead, the high-performance vehicle uses “active air management system” — a world’s first, according to the<a href="https://cars.mclaren.com/en/ultimate-series/mclaren-elva"> company’s website</a> — to direct the whipping air up and around the cabin to envelop the driver in what the company refers to as a “turbulent free zone” or a “bubble of calm”in a <a href="https://www.cars.mclaren.press/releases/759">press release</a>.</p>

      <h3>A Rush of Air</h3>
      <p>And yes, it’s going to be a wild ride as a result. “[The air management system] means you get the full adrenaline rush, undistracted,” reads the company’s website.</p>
      <p>That’s likely an understatement. The twin-turbocharged V8 gives the supercar massive performance: over 800 horsepower allows it to accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in <a href="https://www.cars.mclaren.press/releases/759">under three seconds</a> and 0 to 124 mph (200 km/h) in just 6.7 seconds.</p>

      <h3>Open Cockpit</h3>
      <p>A “fixed windscreen derivative” will be available for those living in areas, including several U.S. states, where windshields are required.</p>
      <p>The “ferociously fast open-cockpit car” may be prohibitively expense to all but a select few — but the fact that drivers will be completely vulnerable to the elements will certainly make it an unforgettable experience.</p>
