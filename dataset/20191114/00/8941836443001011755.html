      <h1>Nwora leads No. 4 Louisville past Indiana State 91-62</h1>

      <p>LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) - <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/louisville/">Louisville</a> coach Chris Mack couldn’t find any fault with his team’s performance against Indiana State.</p>
      <p>The Cardinals started off hot from the field and cooled only slightly. When the Sycamores mounted their lone rally in the second half, Mack kept his head during a timeout. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/louisville/">Louisville</a> answered with a flourish on both ends to finish Wednesday night’s win.</p>
      <p>Jordan Nwora scored 21 points, Dwayne Sutton added 14 and the fourth-ranked Cardinals shot 59% from the field to beat Indiana State 91-62.</p>
      <p>Two days after moving up a spot in the AP Top 25, the Cardinals (3-0) made 14 of their first 17 shots for a 16-point lead through 11 minutes on the way to a 47-26 advantage at the break. Nwora’s 14 points, including a pair of 3s, got <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/louisville/">Louisville</a> going, and Sutton had 10 before the break.</p>
      <p>Nwora, a junior forward, finished 5 of 10 shooting for his third consecutive game of 20 points or more. Sutton and Steven Enoch each grabbed 10 rebounds as <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/louisville/">Louisville</a> owned the glass 42-21. The Cardinals shot above 50% for the third consecutive game and made 9 of 17 from long range.</p>

      <p>Freshman Samuell Williamson added 15 points and five rebounds and graduate transfer Lamarr “Fresh” Kimble scored 13 as <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/louisville/">Louisville</a>’s reserves outscored ISU’s bench 36-20.</p>
      <p>“(Mack) just wants to make sure we share the ball, get the ball to the paint,” said Sutton, who posted his first double-double this season and sixth of his career. “When we shoot 3s, we like to have the ball touch the paint first, so you get wide-open looks. For the most part, we did that.”</p>
      <p>Tyreke Key led the Sycamores (0-2) with 20 points including four 3-pointers, two of which came during a 14-2 early second-half run that got them within 51-40. They got no closer as <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/louisville/">Louisville</a> quickly answered to stretch the lead above 20 as it shot 58% in the final 20 minutes.</p>
      <p>“Really pleased with our response from Sunday,” said Mack, referring to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/louisville/">Louisville</a>’s 78-55 win over Youngstown State. “I thought we played a pretty complete game. I felt that Indiana State’s guards, namely Key and (Jordan) Barnes, really attack the lane. We did a pretty good job on those guys for most of the game.</p>

        <p>“We just wanted to keep the ball out of the lane. I thought our big guys did a great job hedging ball screens and keeping that lane as clean as we have all year. Really pleased with our rebounding difference, to double them on the glass.”</p>
        <p>Indiana State had two scoring droughts of at least three minutes and shot 34% in its only game this season against a Power Five opponent. The Sycamores haven’t beaten a ranked opponent since topping Butler 72-71 in December 2016.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/louisville/">Louisville</a> made sure Indiana State wouldn’t have a chance at the upset.</p>
        <p>“I don’t think we were nearly resilient enough, and they got right in the flow real quick,” Indiana State coach Greg Lansing said. “They were ready to go. I thought we’d fight them a little harder there at the start. We let them get comfortable right away.”</p>
        <p>BIG PICTURE</p>
        <p>Indiana State: After making two of their first three baskets, the Sycamores were no match physically against <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/louisville/">Louisville</a>’s taller lineup. Perimeter shooting was a bright spot as they extended their streak to 345 games with at least one 3-pointer.</p>
        <p>“Offense is there,” Key said. “But they outrebounded us and got second-chance shots. Once you do that it’s hard to get back into the game.”</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/louisville/">Louisville</a>: The Cardinals seemingly couldn’t miss at the start and stayed hot throughout. They never let up even after the outcome was settled.</p>
        <p>POLL IMPLICATIONS</p>
        <p>The Cardinals took a step toward remaining in the top five with another game to play this week.</p>
