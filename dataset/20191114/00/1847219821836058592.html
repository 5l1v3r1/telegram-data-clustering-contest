        <b>A court in Estonia has found Mati Alaver, a former national skiing coach, guilty of doping facilitation and convicted him to probation.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://news.err.ee/1002713/former-ski-coach-alaver-sentenced-to-probation-for-doping-involvement">Estonian public broadcaster ERR reports</a> on Thursday, November 14, that the judgment results from a plea bargain with the prosecutor’s office, in which Alaver himself did not plead guilty, but was sentenced to one-and-a-half-year’s of probation.</p>
      <p>The doping revelations emerged on February 27 at the world championships, where Austrian police and German prosecutors announced the exposure of an international criminal doping network and conducted searches of several national teams, including members of the Estonian team.</p>
      <p>Alaver admitted in an interview with ERR in March that he had contacted German sports physician Mark Schmidt, who had allegedly supplied Estonian skier Karel Tammjärv with doping substances, but denied claims that he, Alaver, had turned a blind eye on the activities.</p>

      <p>Mati Ombler, head of the corruption crime office, at the Estonian Central Criminal Police, commented: «A few cases of fraud in sports have been uncovered, but this case demonstrates a willingness to use unauthorized aids to bring better results; however these are long-term career and reputation-breakers.</p>
      <h3>We hope this investigation will send a broader message to athletes, coaches and sports organizations, that competitive sport must be fair».</h3>
