      <p>Several weeks ago, BTS surprised and delighted fans around the world when they rereleased their song “Make It Right” and took it from an album cut favored by millions of listeners to something of a big single. The track was reimagined with the help of pop singer-songwriter Lauv, and in the frames since it first appeared online, the cut has performed better and better. Now, it has officially landed on an important chart in the U.S., and its arrival proves once again that no other K-pop act can churn out a pop hit like BTS.</p>
      <p>This week, “Make It Right” debuts at No. 39 on <i>Billboard</i>’s Pop Songs chart (also sometimes referred to as the Mainstream Top 40), which every week ranks the “most popular pop songs, ranked by mainstream top 40 radio airplay detections,” according to the magazine <a href="https://www.billboard.com/charts/pop-songs">itself</a>. That may sound like a fairly low start, but it’s still important to the septet.</p>
      <p>“Make It Right” is BTS’s fifth song to appear on the Pop Songs ranking, and they are now the first K-pop act to reach that milestone. In fact, the group is one of only a handful of musicians working in that field to place a track on that list, and they already held the record for the most appearances before this frame. </p>
      <p>BTS first made it to the Pop Songs chart (which only features 40 spots, as the top 40 is typically what defines a true pop hit) in 2017 with the Steve Aoki remix of “Mic Drop,” which featured rapper Desiigner. In 2018, they sent a pair of tracks, “Fake Love” and “Waste It on Me” (another collaboration with Aoki) to the tally. Earlier in 2019, their single “Boy With Luv” with Halsey quickly became a success on the list as well.</p>
      <p>So far, “Make It Right” is BTS’s lowest-charting entry, but just by one position, as “Waste It on Me” only lifted to No. 38. In the coming weeks, that may change, as the Lauv collaboration seems to only be growing more popular every day. </p>
      <p>Impressively, while Lauv is known solely as an English-speaking pop musician, he has only appeared on the Pop Songs ranking four times, including with “Make It Right,” so K-pop outfit BTS has actually performed better in this regard than their homegrown counterpart.</p>
