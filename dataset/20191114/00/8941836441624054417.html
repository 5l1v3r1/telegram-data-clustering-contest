      <p>JERUSALEM (AP) - The Latest on the escalation between Gaza’s militant Islamic Jihad group and Israel (all times local):</p>
      <p>7:30 a.m.</p>
      <p>Israel’s foreign minister says his country intends to continue its policy of targeting Gaza militants with deadly strikes - a warning that came just a few hours after a cease-fire to end the latest round of Israel-Gaza fighting was announced.</p>
      <p>The fighting began when Israel killed a senior commander with the Islamic Jihad group in Gaza early on Tuesday, setting off a barrage of rockets and a two-day round of violence.</p>
      <p>Foreign Minister Israel Katz told Israeli Army Radio on Thursday that Israel intends to continue its policy of targeted killings.</p>

      <p>He says: “Israel will harm anyone who tries to harm it.”</p>
      <p>Islamic Jihad announced earlier that it had reached a cease-fire with Israel. The fighting killed at least 32 Palestinians and paralyzed much of southern Israel.</p>

        <p>The Islamic Jihad militant group says a cease-fire has been reached to end two days of heavy fighting with Israel.</p>
        <p>Spokesman Musab al-Berim says the Egyptian-brokered deal went into effect at 530 a.m. (0330 GMT) Thursday.</p>
        <p>He says the cease-fire was based on a list of demands presented by his group late Wednesday, including a halt to Israeli targeted killings of the group’s leaders.</p>
        <p>The fighting broke out early Tuesday after Israel killed a senior commander of the militant group.</p>
