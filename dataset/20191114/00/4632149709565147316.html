      <p><i>Police have recovered gold chain, bangles belonging to woman from 28-yr-old drug addict</i> <br/><br/>The Nelamangala Town police have cracked the murder of a home-alone woman and have arrested her nephew, a 28-year-old man, for strangling her with a mobile charger. <br/><br/>The accused, Raghu, 28, is allegedly a drug addict and unemployed and has been on the run after murdering his father’s sister, Sharada, 50. The police have arrested him now and recovered a gold chain and bangles he had stolen from her after killing her. <br/><br/>According to the police, Raghu is the son of Sharada’s younger brother. He had gone to her house on October 30 and demanded Rs. 10,000 as a loan. <br/><br/><br/>Sharada, who knew about Raghu’s drug habit, advised him to stay away from drugs and to start working. An argument broke out between the two over this and in a fit of rage, Raghu punched her face, grabbed a mobile charger and strangled her. He then took a pillow and suffocated her to death before fleeing with the gold jewellery that she was wearing. The incident came to light when her daughter who lives in Bengaluru came to visit her and found the door locked. The daughter called her several times, but there was no response from her and she informed her neighbours. They looked around and found the backdoor open. They found her dead body inside the house and alerted the police. <br/><br/>During the investigation, neighbours told the police that a youngster used to visit her often and on questioning Sharada’s relatives, they zeroed in on Raghu. The police with the help of Raghu’s friend called him to a place from where he was picked up for questioning. During interrogation, he confessed to killing her for money. <br/><br/><br/>Nelamangala Town police have registered a case.</p>
