      <p>Located just north of downtown Johannesburg, <b>Sandton</b> stands apart as a quaint and idyllic neighborhood–a serene respite from the hustle-bustle of its surrounding city. Here you’ll find some of the area’s best bars, its most acclaimed chefs, and its most luxurious lodges. As such, it remains one of the most appealing destinations for visitors in search of South African charm while touring <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannesburg">Jozi</a>. Arrive in spring–between September and December–and you’ll be treated to the vibrant violet bloom of jacaranda, rising in dense rows above the wide boulevards below. Ultimately it doesn’t really matter when you visit: wonder awaits–particularly if you incorporate the following stops into your itinerary. <b>STAY HERE</b></p>
      <p>A textbook urban retreat, <a href="https://morukuru.com/places/atholplacehotel/"><b>AtholPlace Hotel &amp; Villa</b></a> is one of only a handful of 5-star properties within Sandton–and its sole Relais &amp; Chateaux member. Its contemporary-classic design imbues it with more the feel of a country cottage than a commercial lodge. And with just 9 guest rooms in total, you won’t really be sharing the space with too many others. The suites are feel vast yet cozy, with raised ceilings and modern fittings; private balconies overlook a tranquil backyard patio and pool. Comfortable common areas are highlighted by a fireside library and outdoor sculpture garden. Detached from the main building, hidden from view, is a standalone 4-bedroom villa.</p>
      <p>AtholPlace’s parent group, <b>Morukuru Family</b>, also runs lodges along coastal South Africa as well as on the <a href="https://morukuru.com/locations/madikwe/"><b>Madikwe Game Reserve</b></a>. It’s quite common for quests to make a nightly stopover here upon arrival at <a href="https://ortambo-airport.com/index.html">O.R. Tambo International Airport</a>, before venturing off to safari. Rates start at $350 USD per night.</p>

        <b>EAT THIS</b>
      </p>
      <p>One of the greatest perks of a stay here is enjoying a three-course dinner at the exclusive, off-lobby <a href="https://morukuru.com/places/atholplacerestaurant/"><b>AtholPlace Restaurant</b></a>. Menus are crafted daily to include a seasonal assortment of surf, turf, and vegetable. A duo of beef, built with sirloin and lightly smoked tongue, makes frequent appearances. As does a monkfish caked in coriander, served under a squid ink velouté. Digestif hour commences in the adjacent bar, where an expansive selection of South African craft gins sit on shelf alongside classic scotches.</p>
      <p>If you’re looking to get off property, Sandton holds flavors to fit every palate and preference. At <a href="http://pigallerestaurants.co.za/sandton/"><b>Pigalle</b></a>, elegantly rendered seafoods are a speciality. The prawn dishes here rely on recipes that have stayed true over three decades, including a sensational Mozambique curry preparation that infuses coriander and coconut with the crisped crustacean.</p>
      <p>For something decidedly more playful, head to <a href="https://www.saigonsuzy.co.za/"><b>Saigon Suzy</b></a>–a Vietnamese fusion concept that features customizable orders of bao, bun cha, and broken rice. The cocktails are colorful, if not skewing sweet. And there’s a backroom dedicated to karaoke. In Nelson Mandela Square, adjacent to the Convention Centre, <a href="http://www.thebigmouth.co.za/"><b>The Big Mouth</b></a> is another fun affair incorporating Eastern influence. Here you can enjoy everything from sushi to ceviche; tacos to tempura. And it’s all surprisingly well-composed and never too precious.</p>
      <p>
        <b>DRINK THAT</b>
      </p>
      <p>When it’s time for cocktails, any sensible evening in Sandton either starts or ends at <a href="https://sintaxbar.com/"><b>Sin+Tax</b></a>, the standout speakeasy recently named the <a href="https://www.worlds50bestbars.com/worlds-50-best-bar-2019_51-100/">88th best bar in the world</a>. The menu rotates several times per year, but expect high-minded compositions incorporating ingredients from throughout South Africa. The Zazoo, for example, combines a summer tea-infused bourbon with pineapple and Campari into a burlier spin on a Jungle Bird. The dimly-lit lounge is enlightened by a lively staff behind the bar, pulling glass from one of the country’s widest spirit allocations.</p>
      <p>Inside the <b>Maslow Hotel</b>, <a href="https://www.suninternational.com/maslow/restaurants/lacuna-bar/"><b>Lacuna Bar</b></a><b> </b>offers a brighter approach to mixology from its poolside digs. Drinks here often lean on fresh muddled fruit and any of the numerous craft gins that have recently sprouted up–in great number–from the local landscape. At <a href="https://www.cafedelsol.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/LANDMARK-BAR2018.pdf"><b>The Landmark</b></a>, signature arrangements aren’t just inspired by South African cultural fixtures, they’re named after them. <i>Around the ‘Braai</i>’ is a rum drink imbued with Lapsang to impart the smokier notes of traditional regional barbecue. If you’re not feeling all that experimental, the bar also nails the classics with nearly 35 tried and true recipes on offer. Best of all, nothing costs more than $5 USD. In fact, you’re unlikely to see drinks listed for much more at <i>any</i> bar around town. Rideshares throughout the neighborhood are equally affordable. Sipping your way through any given night in Sandton is a matter of ease.</p>
