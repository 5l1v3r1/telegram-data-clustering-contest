      <p>Are you determined to get home for Thanksgiving this year by <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093748/">planes, trains or automobiles</a>? If you’re planning to fly, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) says you won’t be alone. The TSA is expecting a record-breaking number of flyers this Thanksgiving. The TSA is planning to welcome more than 26.8 million passengers (an increase of about 4% over last year) to its security screening checkpoints during the Thanksgiving period from Nov. 22 through Dec. 2. According to the TSA, one of the busiest travel days this Thanksgiving will be Wednesday, Nov. 27, the day before the holiday. That day, some 2.7 million passengers and crew are expected to “zip” through TSA checkpoints. The Sunday after Thanksgiving, December 1, promises to be even busier, with more than 2.8 million travelers stopping to remove belts and shoes before flying home.</p>
      <p>But if your friends and family can time-shift their turkey, you can avoid some of the crowd. As is typically the case with Christmas as well, the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2019-11-13/flying-thanksgiving-2019-record-airport-crowds">lightest travel day</a> is expected to be the holiday itself.</p>
      <p>Surprisingly, even the peak days of Thanksgiving week aren’t quite an order of magnitude higher than an ordinary day at the TSA. The agency says that on a typical weekday, it screens about 2.1 million passengers, or 30% less than on Thanksgiving’s biggest travel days.</p>

      <p>To process the plethora of passengers at airport security checkpoints, the TSA says it’s working closely with airports and airlines to project numbers and peak periods. Security operations <a href="https://wtop.com/travel/2016/12/inside-room-can-get-tsa-faster-photos/">at 20 major airports</a> are monitored at TSA Airport Operations Center in Pentagon City (Arlington, VA). The center tracks daily screening operations, addresses issues that arise, (such as how many security checkpoint lines are open at each airport and where delays are forming) and helps TSA deploy personnel, canine teams and technology where needed.</p>
      <p>“We expect record breaking travel volume this 2019 holiday season, following our busiest summer ever,” says TSA Acting Deputy Administrator Patricia Cogswell. “We want to ensure travelers are as best prepared as they can be.”</p>
      <p>The TSA has some travel tips to help travelers be prepared this Thanksgiving.</p>
      <p><b>Allow time.</b> The best way to ensure a quick trip through the security screening process is to arrive early (<i>at least</i> two hours early for domestic travel, three hours for international travel) and be prepared. Allow time to park your car, return a rental vehicle, check luggage and get your boarding pass—all <i>before</i> heading to the security checkpoint.</p>
      <p><b>Pack smart.</b> Don’t just pack for yourself or your loved ones; pack for security as well. Make sure there are no prohibited items in baggage. If you’re not sure, you can always check the <a href="https://www.tsa.gov/travel/security-screening/whatcanibring/all">“What Can I Bring?”</a> tool on TSA.Gov. The TSA says that as always, passengers can bring pies, cakes and other baked goods through checkpoints. However, liquids such as eggnog and maple syrup,and gels such as preserves and jellies, should go into checked bags.</p>
      <p><b>Get or renew TSA Pre✓® membership</b>. As you might guess, the TSA is a big fan of TSA Pre✓®. One big benefit: Travelers enrolled in a trusted traveler program like TSA Pre✓® do not need to remove shoes, laptops, liquids, belts and light jackets. There are other programs as well, however, such as Global Entry and SENTRI (for entry from Canada or Mexico). The Department of Homeland Service offers a trusted traveler <a href="https://ttp.dhs.gov/">comparison tool</a> to help understand the differences.</p>
      <p><b>Ask for passenger support. </b>Travelers or families of passengers with disabilities and/or medical conditions can call the TSA Cares helpline toll free at 855-787-2227 at least 72 hours prior to flying. It can provide help with screening policies and procedures or provide assistance at the security checkpoint.</p>
      <p><b>Make sure you have proper ID.</b> Before heading to the airport, travelers should make sure they have an acceptable ID. The TSA would also like to remind you that REAL ID enforcement is less than a year away. Beginning October 1, 2020, every air traveler 18 years of age and older will need a REAL ID-compliant driver’s license, state-issued enhanced driver’s license, or another acceptable form of ID to fly within the US.</p>

      <p><b>Talk to the TSA</b>. Travelers can get real time assistance by submitting questions and comments to @AskTSA on Twitter or Facebook Messenger on weekdays from 8am to 10pm and on weekends/holidays from 9am to 7pm ET. Travelers can also call the TSA Contact Center at 866-289-9673.</p>
      <p>And on Thanksgiving, as ever, the TSA reminds, If You See Something, Say Something™.</p>
