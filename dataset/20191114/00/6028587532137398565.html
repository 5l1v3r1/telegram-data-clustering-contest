      <p>Scotland-based brewery BrewDog announced that BrewDog USA, it’s American arm, is opening up its third round of its <a href="https://www.brewdog.com/usa/community/equity-for-punks">Equity for Punks crowdfunding campaig</a>n today, with plans to dramatically expand the brand’s footprint in the United States with a new distillery, west coast location, and expansions to its “DogHouse” hotel.“The community we’ve built in the U.S. in just three years is more than we could have dreamed. It is because of our people that we’re growing faster than ever, and we refuse to sacrifice anything to maintain that growth,” says co-founder James Watt. “Our Equity Punks have helped us achieve unbelievable accomplishments, and we’re giving them more of what they want by investing in the elements of our business that they value most: beer, experiences and community. We are looking forward to their support in helping us achieve our most massive growth goals yet.”</p>
      <p>So far more than 120,000 people have invested in BrewDog. It previously raised investment capital in 2017 and 2018 in the United States, with 13,000 stateside investors. The hope is this third round of investment will grow that number dramatically — to 100,000—allowing the company to quadruple production in the states. Hopes for this round of funding include:</p>
      <p>• Expanding The DogHouse, the world’s first crowdfunded craft beer hotel recently named one of the World’s Greatest Places by <a href="https://time.com/collection/worlds-greatest-places-2019/5654068/doghouse-hotel-and-brewery-columbus-ohio/">TIME</a>, with <b>shipping container lodging</b> and <b>pop-up “kennels”</b> connected to BrewDog bars in the U.S.</p>
      <p>• Launching <b>BrewDog Distilling Co.</b> in the U.S., bringing its made-from-scratch spirits to America</p>
      <p>Potential investors can get in on round three for a minimum investment of $60. The investment round is open from now until May 2020.</p>
