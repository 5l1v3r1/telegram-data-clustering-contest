        <b>Join The Explorer Academy by White Desert</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://white-desert.com/">White Desert</a> made quite an impression when it first began flying travelers out to Antarctica by Gulfstream jet, setting up the luxury, and carbon-neutral, Whichaway Camp. Earlier this year, the Antarctica specialist announced the launch of a new White Desert trip for the 2019/20 season. The Explorer Academy is a four-day journey led by world record-breaking adventurer, Ben Saunders, who has covered more than 7,000km of Antarctic terrain over the past two decades. After flying in from Cape Town, guests will settle into Whichaway Camp before embarking on a series of activities designed to introduce you to the skills of a polar explorer, from a rope walk over a 200ft cliff to exploring the atmospheric ice caves.</p>

        <b>Set sail on The Greg Mortimer by Aurora Expeditions</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.auroraexpeditions.com.au/">Aurora Expeditions’</a> newest ship, The Greg Mortimer, set sail on its inaugural Antarctic expedition last month. The new ship stands out for its ULSTEIN X-BOW technology, which provides better stability, as well as reduced fuel consumption, and virtual anchoring to remain stationary without disturbing the seabed. Other features include a 360-degree open viewing deck. Tying in with this launch, Aurora is becoming the first polar voyaging company to give passengers the opportunity to create their own polar pentathlon. You’ll be able to choose from activities including polar skiing, snorkelling and diving, ice climbing, kayaking and the daring polar plunge. Looking ahead, the Solar Eclipse in Antarctica voyage, which takes place in November 2021, will see NASA scientists join as special guests.</p>

        <b>Ski Antarctica with Cookson Adventures</b>
      </p>
      <p>The experiential travel specialist, <a href="https://cooksonadventures.com/">Cookson Adventures</a>, continually endeavors to push the limits of luxury adventure travel. Among Cookson’s latest adventures is a series of intrepid ski journeys. Greenland, the Kuril Islands and Iceland are all possible locations, but there’s also the chance to ‘ski the seventh continent’ on a trip to Antarctica with an expedition yacht as your base. Each trip is entirely bespoke but in this case could include guided tours by Zodiac or helicopter, camping on ice and seeking out the extraordinary wildlife, as well as skinning up the mountains with a guide before skiing down untouched slopes to an Antarctic beach. Top the trip off by arranging a submersible dive off the yacht.</p>

        <b>Step aboard the new expedition yacht, Scenic Eclipse</b>
      </p>
      <p>Scenic’s first Discover Yacht, <a href="https://www.scenic.co.uk/ocean-cruises/antarctica">Scenic Eclipse</a>, set sail on her inaugural cruise earlier this year. The summer voyage saw the ship sail from Reykjavik to Quebec but now as winter comes around, it’s time for the new expedition yacht’s first season in Antarctica. Panoramic veranda suites, numerous restaurants and bars, and an on-board spa complement the opportunities for exploration and the chance to venture out by Zodiac, kayak, helicopter and submarine. Scenic’s Antarctica itineraries take in Patagonia, the Falkland Islands and South Georgia before crossing the Drake Passage to the Antarctic Peninsula and Lemaire Channel. Other Antarctic itineraries encompass exploration of Chile, Brazil and Peru.</p>

        <b>Stop by Antarctica on a private jet journey with TCS World Travel</b>
      </p>
      <p>Only last month, TCS World Travel announced the new itineraries for its 2021 line-up of private jet journeys. Among these is the extraordinary 28-day <a href="https://www.tcsworldtravel.com/luxury-jet-expeditions/seven-continents-private-jet/2021/january">Seven Continents by Private Jet</a> itinerary. Throughout the epic journey, passengers will touch down in each continent, beginning in Miami then passing through countries including Chile, Fiji and Oman before ending the journey in London. A highlight is undoubtedly the Antarctica portion of the journey in which passengers will step aboard a six-day cruise before flying on to Easter Island from Ushuaia.</p>

      </p>
      <p>2021 will see the launch of <a href="https://www.seabourn.com/en_US.html">Seabourn</a>’s new ultra-luxury expedition ship. Seabourn Venture will combine the latest technology for expedition ships with the features Seabourn cruises have become known for. Expect spacious suites with their own verandas, a range of dining options and plush relaxation areas, along with one of the ship’s most distinguishing features — the inclusion of two custom-built submarines enabling you to explore over 900 feet below the surface. Explore by kayak and on board one of the ship’s 24 Zodiacs with an expedition team of wildlife experts, scientists, historians and naturalists. The ship’s Antarctica cruises will begin in November 2021 and its yet-to-be-named sister ship will launch in May 2022.</p>
