      <p>Accra, Nov. 14, GNA - A goal in each half by Thomas Teye Partey and debutant Kudus Mohamed was enough to aid the Black Stars secure an emphatic win over Bafana Bafana of South Africa in the 2021 Africa Cup of Nation qualifiers at the Cape Coast Sports Stadium on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The Stars now have three points in their basket and will fly to Principe and São Tomé for the second game of the group.</p>
