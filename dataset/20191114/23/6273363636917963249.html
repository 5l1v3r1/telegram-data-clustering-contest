      <h1>October 2019 NPD: Call of Duty and Outer Worlds deliver solid month</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T23:30:31+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 23:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://venturebeat.com/author/jeff-grubb/" target="_blank">Jeff Grubb</a></address>
      <p>Consumer spending on video games was not as bleak as it looks on the page. Gaming fans in the United States spent $1.03 billion on hardware, new full game software, and accessories, according to <a href="https://venturebeat.com/tag/the-npd-group/">industry-tracking firm The NPD Group</a>. While this is down 34% from last October, 2018 was an outlier due to the release of <a href="https://venturebeat.com/tag/red-dead-redemption-2/">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> and four weeks of <a href="https://venturebeat.com/tag/call-of-duty-black-ops-4/">Call of Duty sales</a>.</p>
      <p>October 2019 was actually above average, with strong sales performances from Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, <a href="https://venturebeat.com/tag/the-outer-worlds/">The Outer Worlds</a>, and <a href="https://venturebeat.com/tag/luigis-mansion-3/">Luigi’s Mansion 3</a>. Here are the full results:</p>
      <p><b>October 2019 Dollar Sales</b> <b>Oct’18</b> <b>Oct’19</b> <b>Change</b> Total Video Game Sales $1.57b $1.03b -34% Video Games Hardware $307m $182m -41% PC &amp; Video Games Software (PC, Console and Portable; Physical and Full Game Digital Formats from the STEAM, PlayStation and Xbox platforms) $983m $620m -22% Video Games Accessories &amp; Game Cards $277m $231m -4%</p>
      <p>“October 2019 tracked spending across video game hardware, software, accessories, and game cards totaled $1.03 billion,” NPD analyst Mat Piscatella said. “That’s the second highest total for an October month this decade, trailing only the record setting $1.57 billion in October 2018.”</p>
      <p>While 2019 was mostly keeping pace with 2018 through September, the former was always going to fall behind the latter in October. Most years, including this one, don’t have a game like Red Dead Redemption 2. And Call of Duty: Black Ops IV launched in early October 2018. Modern Warfare, meanwhile, launched halfway through the NPD’s reporting period.</p>
      <p>So as expected, 2019’s year-to-date sales are down significantly from the previous comparable period.</p>
      <p>“Year-to-date spending across tracked video game hardware, software, accessories, and game cards has fallen 10 percent when compared to 2018, to $9.3 billion,” said Piscatella.</p>
      <p>Let’s get to the software charts.</p>
      <h3>Software</h3>
      <p>
        <i>NPD tracks physical sales at retailers, but it also gets digital data directly from publishers. But not every company participates. For example, Nintendo doesn’t share its first-party sales, and Activision Blizzard does not provide its Battle.net sales.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>These charts are sorted by dollar sales — not number of units sold.</i>
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>Again, the comparison to 2018 is rough, but Piscatella notes that this is one of the best-performing Octobers ever.</p>
      <p>“Dollar sales of tracked video game software declined 37 percent in October versus a year ago, to $620 million,” said Piscatella. “Despite this decline, October 2019 tracked software sales represent the third highest total ever achieved for an October month, trailing only October 2008 and October 2018.”</p>
      <p>For the whole year, the bright spot is software for Nintendo Switch.</p>
      <p>“Year-to-date dollar sales of tracked video game software are down 7 percent, to $4.5 billion,” said Piscatella. “Gains in sales of Nintendo Switch software sales have been offset by declines across all other platforms.”</p>
      <h3>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</h3>
      <p>The latest Call of Duty is keeping that franchise’s momentum going strong.</p>
      <p>“Call of Duty: Modern Warfare debuts as the best-selling game of October 2019, and is now the best-selling game of 2019 year to date,” said Piscatella. “This is the 12th consecutive year a Call of Duty game has ranked as the best-selling game of its release month. Call of Duty remains the best-selling video game franchise in U.S. tracked history by dollar sales.”</p>
      <h3>Luigi’s Mansion 3</h3>
      <p>“Luigi’s Mansion 3 was the third best-selling game of October, while also being the month’s best-selling game on Nintendo Switch,”said Piscatella. “Luigi’s Mansion 3 set a new launch month franchise sales record, besting the previous high set by Luigi’s Mansion.”</p>
      <h3>Fighting games in 2019</h3>
      <p>“Year-to-date sales of fighting genre games are at an all-time high, with genre sales 11 percent higher than the previous year-to-date high set in 2015,” said Piscatella. “Both Mortal Kombat 11 and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate have significantly contributed to that success.”</p>
