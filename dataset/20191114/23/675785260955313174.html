      <h1>Voice of the Mirror: Tories have crippled our NHS during 10-year rule</h1>
      <h2>The target for cancer treatment has not been hit for four years, more patients are stranded on trolleys, and A&amp;E waiting times are the worst ever recorded</h2>

      <p>The NHS statistics stand as a damning indictment of nearly 10 years of Tory rule.</p>
      <p>On every measurement the health service is struggling to cope.</p>
      <p>More than four million patients are on the waiting list – the highest on record.</p>
      <p>The target for cancer treatment has not been hit for four years, more patients are stranded on trolleys, and A&amp;E waiting times are the worst ever recorded.</p>
      <p>We are so used to reading such grim statistics there is a risk we become blind to the stories behind them.</p>
      <p>Each number represents someone living in pain as they wait for treatment.</p>

      <p>It represents a worried cancer sufferer or an elderly person who has had their operation cancelled. And it represents a family member anxious about losing a loved one.</p>
      <p>The fact the NHS is close to imploding is entirely down to a Tory government that has starved it of funds. Only Labour is promising the cash it needs but that money must be spent wisely and coupled with reforms.</p>
      <p>The Tories have betrayed health service staff and their patients. For this alone, they deserve to be booted out of office.</p>
      <h3>Housing hell</h3>

      <p>Our housing system is so broken that councils spent more than £1billion last year on temporary accommodation.</p>
      <p>This included millions of pounds on housing families in B&amp;Bs. They are the victims of the failure to build enough affordable housing and to regulate the rental market.</p>
      <p>Greedy landlords have not only priced families out of their homes they are overcharging for shoddy emergency accommodation.</p>
      <p>We should be ashamed this is happening in 21st century Britain.</p>
      <h3>Bucket twist</h3>
      <p>Britbox has made Hyacinth Bucket the face of its US advertising campaign.</p>
      <p>It has been years since the show was broadcast in Britain but, in America, it keeps making appearances</p>
