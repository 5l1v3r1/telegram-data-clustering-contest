        <i>Harry Kane continues to close in on England’s all-time top goalscorers while Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain will be satisfied with his first start for 18 months</i>
      </p>
      <h3>England 4-3-3</h3>
      <p><b>Jordan Pickford </b>Two excellent saves showed great concentration on a night when he barely touched the ball otherwise. <b>7</b></p>
      <p><b>Trent Alexander-Arnold </b>Trademark crossfield ball led to opening goal and oozed confidence going forward. Must be close to a regular spot. <b>8</b></p>
      <p><b>Harry Maguire </b>So little to do that he was able to venture forward at will and could easily have added to England’s tally. <b>7</b></p>
      <p><b>John Stones </b>Slow to react when <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/montenegro">Montenegro</a> created a rare chance, although his distribution added an extra element to England’s play. <b>7</b></p>
      <p><b>Ben Chilwell </b>Incisive pass to set up the first goal and showed his set-piece ability with two sublime crosses to complete hat-trick of assists. <b>9</b></p>
      <p><b>Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain </b>Took his goal brilliantly on first start for 18 months and an energetic presence on the right of the midfield three. <b>8</b></p>
      <p><b>Harry Winks </b>Superb pass to play in Sancho early on and set the tone throughout with intelligent positioning. <b>8</b></p>
      <p><b>Mason Mount </b>Some nice touches yet did not impose himself as much as he would have wanted on second senior start. <b>7</b></p>
      <p><b>Jadon Sancho </b>Almost set up Kane for opener and looked to have rediscovered some of his confidence on the ball with late assist for Abraham. <b>7</b></p>
      <p><b>Harry Kane </b>The easiest hat-trick he will ever score. How long before he passes Michael Owen next on the top scorers’ list? <b>9</b></p>
      <p><b>Marcus Rashford </b>Took his goal well and looked a menace on both flanks. Almost into double figures for his country already. <b>8</b></p>

      <h3>Montenegro 4-5-1</h3>
      <p><b>Milan Mijatovic </b>Made a couple of decent saves but was helpless as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/england">England</a> bombarded his goal in the first half. <b>4</b></p>
      <p><b>Marko Vesovic </b>Lucky to escape a red card after an altercation with his tormentor-in-chief Rashford. <b>3</b></p>
      <p><b>Aleksandar Sofranac </b>Denied England an early lead with clearance on the line but will not want to see his shinned own goal again. <b>3</b></p>
      <p><b>Marko Simic </b>Unlucky not to score with header but was out of his depth in attempting to contain Kane. <b>4</b></p>
      <p><b>Risto Radunovic </b>Caught napping for England’s opening goal and must have been grateful to not have to re-emerge for the second half. <b>3</b></p>
      <p><b>Vladimir Jovovic</b> Forced to drop deep and at least helped stem the flow of goals after the break before being replaced. <b>4</b></p>
      <p><b>Nikola Vukcevic </b>The Levante midfielder is one of the few class acts in this poor side. Had to feel for him as his teammates struggled. <b>5</b></p>
      <p><b>Dusan Lagator </b>Pulled out of header at last minute to allow Kane easy goal and guilty of losing his man again for the third. <b>2</b></p>
      <p><b>Deni Hocko </b>Chasing shadows all night in midfield as Montenegro were pushed further and further back. <b>4</b></p>
      <p><b>Sead Haksabanovic </b>The West Ham loanee was a rare bright spot for the visitors and tried manfully to give his defence some respite. <b>5</b></p>
      <p><b>Fatos Beciraj </b>A golden opportunity to make his mark with a goal was squandered by the captain on a night to forget for his side. <b>4</b></p>
