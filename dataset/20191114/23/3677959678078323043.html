      <blockquote>In Wasteland 3 the fate of Arizona depends on the fate of Colorado. You’re a Desert Ranger, fighting a losing battle to keep your beloved Arizona alive, when the self-proclaimed Patriarch of Colorado radios, promising aid if you’ll do a job he can only entrust to an outsider—rescue his land from the ambitions of his three bloodthirsty children.<br/>Wasteland 3 is a post-apocalyptic RPG from inXile entertainment, featuring challenging tactical combat, hours of exploration, and a deep, reactive story full of twists, turns, and brutal ethical decisions. Play in single-player or co-op as you customize your squad with perks and abilities geared to your playstyle, and customize your vehicle -- the Kodiak -- turning it into a hardened war beast. Saving Colorado isn't going to be easy, but Arizona is counting on you, so...don't screw it up.</blockquote>
      <p>Despite InXile being owned by Microsoft, Wasteland is still coming to PC, Xbox One, and PS4. The game launches on May 19, 2020. <a href="https://fave.co/33UDWgc">Pre-orders are open now</a>, and everybody who reserves a copy gets the Ranger General’s Hat and Glasses, Polished Ranger Badge, and Snow Camo Weapons as bonuses.</p>
