Talking about the title track, the 2.5D-parallel singer-songwriters said:</p>
      <blockquote>To me, ‘My Hero Academia’ is like a lucky charm that turns my inner, little thoughts to a solid power. I wrote ‘About a Voyage’ out of my wish to sing a song like that. I hope you enjoy this ending theme song alongside the development of the story.</blockquote>
