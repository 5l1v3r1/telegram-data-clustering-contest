      <p>Connor McAliskey has left the Tyrone squad, and will play no part in the Red Hands’ challenge for honours in 2020.</p>
      <p>It’s understood the corner-forward has decided to opt out for a year, and the door has been left open for his return.</p>
      <p>Manager Mickey Harte confirmed the Clonoe man has informed him of his decision to take a break from inter-county football.</p>
      <p>“He doesn’t feel that he’s ready to commit for this particular year,” said Harte.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think it’s a retirement as such, it’s just a break.”</p>
      <p>McAliskey’s game time was limited during the 2019 season, chiefly due to a combination of injury and a shift in attacking strategy which saw Cathal McShane and Mattie Donnelly pushed into advanced positions.</p>
      <p>McShane’s move to the inside line proved to be a sensational success and earned him an All-Star award.</p>
      <p>McAliskey is not the first attacker to leave the Tyrone squad in recent times.</p>
      <p>Ronan O’Neill departed earlier this year, frustrated by a lack of game time.</p>
      <p>Darren McCurry also left the set-up last year but returned this season.</p>
      <p>And Mark Bradley missed the entire 2019 campaign after taking a year out to pursue post-graduate studies in Liverpool, but is back home, and set to return for the season ahead.</p>
      <p>Tyrone captain Mattie Donnelly will miss the National Football League due to a hamstring injury which is set to sideline him for six months.</p>
      <p>He suffered damage to a tendon which holds the hamstring to the bone while playing for Trillick in the Ulster Club Championship against Derrygonnelly of Fermanagh earlier this month.</p>
      <p>His absence will be a huge blow to the Red Hands’ hopes of challenging for the Division One title, and there’s also concern that the former All-Star could miss the Ulster Championship opener against Donegal.</p>
      <p>Midfielder Declan McClure is also likely to miss the early part of the season, having suffered a knee injury while playing for Clonoe in the club championship last month.</p>
      <p>Tyrone will get the new season under way when they begin the defence of their Dr McKenna Cup campaign on Sunday, December 29.</p>
