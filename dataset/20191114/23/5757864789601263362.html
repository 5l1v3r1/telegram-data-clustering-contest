      <p>Necco is perhaps best known for producing some of the most divisive candies in history, but its legacy isn't limited to chalky Necco Wafers and jaw-breaking Mary Janes. From 1938 to 2018, the company also made Sky Bars, a treat that packs four classic chocolate box flavors—caramel, vanilla, peanut, and fudge—into one segmented candy bar. After missing from shelves for more than a year, the vintage bar is making a comeback, <a href="https://boston.cbslocal.com/2019/11/13/sky-bar-returns-sudbury-duck-soup/">CBS Boston</a> reports.</p>
      <p>Sky Bars were discontinued along with the rest of Necco's line of candies when the company shuttered in <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/539723/people-are-panic-buying-necco-wafers-they-disappear-shelves">2018</a>. Less than a year later, the makers of <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/558440/circus-peanuts-saving-necco-wafers">Circus Peanuts</a> made moves to resurrect the failed brand, but eventually <a href="https://www.toledoblade.com/business/2018/06/02/Spangler-Candy-backs-out-of-deal-to-buy-NECCO-Wafers/stories/20180601183">backed out</a> of the deal. Necco brand products have since been <a href="https://newengland.com/today/food/new-england-made/necco-wafers/">sold off</a> to various manufacturers, with Louise Mawhinney, owner of the gourmet food store Duck Soup in Sudbury, Massachusetts, acquiring Sky Bar in <a href="https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2019/11/13/iconic-sky-bar-candy-once-thought-gone-being-made-again-in-mass">January 2019</a>.</p>
      <p>The bar is only available to purchase online in <a href="https://www.skybarcandy.com/shop/sky-bar-box-of-24">boxes of 24</a> at the moment, but on December 7, Duck Soup is opening an entire <a href="http://web-extract.constantcontact.com/v1/social_annotation?permalink_uri=32pgbvH&amp;image_url=https%3A%2F%2Fmlsvc01-prod.s3.amazonaws.com%2F59e8cb19401%2F521821a3-fe3f-4c94-b4fd-fc50156bfd65.jpg%3Fver%3D1571214409000&amp;fbclid=IwAR2cP7zfCHPuN8GCGeToD-eSTyCOpFax1IpQEP7GkelTLnycjBCOYPz1ryU">Sky Bar store</a> where customers can buy individual bars for $1.98. In 2020, the company plans to ramp up production and get the candy into more stores.</p>
