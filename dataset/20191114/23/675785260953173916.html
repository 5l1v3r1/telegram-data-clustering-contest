      <h1>General election 2019: When will the BBC, Sky and and ITV debates happen and who will take part?</h1>
      <h2>Between now and polling day you are going to see a lot of politicians on your TV screens - and it won't just be during the news</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T23:11:42+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 23:11</time> by <a rel="author">Oliver Milne, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/oliver-milne/</a></address>
      <p>Alongside all the real issues in any election, the TV debates always become a huge part of the contest.</p>
      <p>In 2010, they put Nick Clegg in the spotlight - even if it didn't do much for him at the polls.</p>
      <p>In 2015 they put the Ed Miliband through his paces - it didn't really do much for him either.</p>
      <p>Just two years ago, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/theresa-may">Theresa May</a> was too chicken to take part in them - but even not turning up didn't help her out all that much.</p>
      <p>So it seems like you're damned if you do, and damned if you don't.</p>
      <p>But that is why TV producers love them - and politicians hate them.</p>
      <p>This year Sky, the BBC and ITV have all proposed some form of debate - but they might not all go ahead.</p>
      <p>And with everything to play for things are tense before the first studio light has been turned on - with the Lib Dems and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/snp">SNP</a> pursing legal action against ITV for keeping them out of its first debate.</p>
      <p>
        <b>So with all the fun still to come, here is everything you need to know about the TV debates.</b>
      </p>
      <h3>When are the general election debates and who is hosting them?</h3>

      <p> </p>
      <p>First out the docks with their TV debate is ITV - who will host their debate on Tuesday November 18. <br/><br/>Sky News has proposed to hold the next debate on Thursday, November 28. <br/><br/>The BBC will host two national debates - one on Friday November 29 and a second on December 6. The Beeb has also said they will do a series of special Question Time programmes allowing people to quiz the party leaders in more detail.</p>
      <h3>What time do the general election TV debates start?</h3>

      <p>Johnson v Corbyn: The ITV Debate, Tuesday Nov 19 - 8pm (ITV). <br/>Sky News <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/general-election">general election</a> debate, Thursday Nov 28, TBC (Sky News). <br/>The BBC Election Debate, Friday Nov 29, TBC (BBC). <br/>The BBC Prime Ministerial Debate, Friday Dec 6, TBC (BBC).</p>
      <h3>Who will be in the ITV general election debate and why is it controversial?</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jeremy-corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a> will go head-to-head in the first televised debate next week.</p>
      <p>It is the first time the leaders of the two main parties have squared off since 2015 - and it is set to be dramatic.</p>
      <p>The debate will be hosted by Julie Etchingham - and campaign bosses will hope that a good performance will give their candidate an edge as the election hits its stride.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>But ITV is also facing legal action from the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liberal-democrats">Liberal Democrats</a> and the Scottish National Party - both of who feel they've been unfairly excluded.</p>
      <p>ITV say they will propose another format later in the campaign which will give the other parties a chance to be heard.</p>
      <h3>Who will be in the Sky News general election debate?</h3>

      <p> </p>
      <p>Well at the moment, just Jo Swinson.</p>
      <p>Sky has invited Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn to take part in the debate - but neither has confirmed.</p>
      <p>Details are sparse so far.</p>
      <h3>Who will take part in the BBC debates and how many are they hosting?</h3>
      <p>Perhaps not surprisingly the BBC has the most events as part of this election.</p>
      <p>The first debate will be a seven-way podium debate at 7pm on Friday, November 29 in Cardiff.</p>
      <p>Plaid Cymru. <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> , the Lib Dems, Greens, Conservative, SNP and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brexit">Brexit</a> Party have all been invited.</p>
      <p>The second debate will be a head-to-head clash beterrn Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn just six days before Britain goes to the polls.</p>
      <p>They will likely have scores to settle after their first battle on ITV.</p>
      <p>The broadcaster will then air another head-to-head clash, this time on on Friday, December 6 from Southampton - six days before the election date.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>This is where it gets a bit complicated - because they are are also holding a number of Question Time-style specials.</p>
      <p>A special two-hour long "Leaders' Special" will take place on November 22 from Cardiff.</p>
      <p>It will give an audience the chance to quiz the main party leaders.</p>
      <p>It will be followed by two more specials with the leader of the Brexit Party and the co-leaders of the Green Party.</p>
      <p>A Question Time special aimed at voters under 30 will be aired on Monday, December 9.</p>
      <p>And the BBC will also host debates in the devolved nations and regions.</p>
      <p>BBC Wales will be holding two live debates on Tuesday Nov 26 and Tuesday Dec 3.</p>
      <p>BBC Scotland is set to broadcast its Scotland Leaders debate live from Glasgow on Tuesday Dec 10.</p>
      <p>Later that same night BBC Northern Ireland will host a debate of party leaders there.</p>
