      <p>Optus has reported a solid second quarter to September 30 for its 2020 fiscal year, with revenue steady at AU$2.2 billion and profitability increasing by double digits. <br/><br/>Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) increased by 11% to AU$703 million, while net profit jumped by almost one quarter to shift from AU$105 million at the same time last year to AU$130 million this year. <br/><br/>Revenue for its consumer segment grew 5% to AU$1.9 billion, with mobile revenue down 4% due to lower average revenue per user and lower handset demand and fixed line revenue decreasing by AU$18 million to AU$439 million, the company said. <br/><br/>Filling in the revenue gap, and then some, was payments from NBN to migrate customers, which jumped from AU$23 million for the second quarter last year to AU$187 million. The company said it has added 80,000 customers in the past three months. <br/><br/>In terms of consumer numbers, Optus now has a total of 10.3 million mobile subscribers made up of 5.76 million postpaid customers, 3.35 million prepaid customers, and 1.18 million mobile broadband users. For fixed line, Optus saw a 40% drop in HFC and ADSL customers to 377,000, while the company's NBN customer base has grown to 726,000.</p>
      <p>For the consumer segment, EBITDA increased by 19% to AU$684 million. <br/><br/>The numbers for the enterprise segment were less impressive, with ICT revenue down by one quarter to AU$121 million as managed services saw a 28% drop in revenue to AU$97 million while cybersecurity posted AU$24 million in revenue for the quarter, a decrease of 13%.</p>
      <p>Operating revenue for the enterprise group fell 21% to AU$290 million and EBITDA plummeted from AU$57 million last year to a mere AU$14 million this quarter. <br/><br/>Earlier this month, the telco made its <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/optus-makes-5g-home-fixed-wireless-generally-available/">5G Home service generally available</a>. <br/><br/>Optus CEO Allen Lew said at the time that the service has so far delivered close to half a gigabit peak speeds. <br/><br/>"The reality today in Australia, is that there are large numbers of homes that want faster broadband, despite the National Broadband Network," he said. <br/><br/>Lew said that setting up the service was a "plug and play" with lights on the modem, allowing users to position it inside their home for better performance. <br/><br/>"No need to take a day off to wait for a truck role," Lew said in another swipe at NBN. <br/><br/>For Optus' Singaporean parent company, Singtel reported a 3% drop in revenue to SG$4.15 billion, however, EBITDA increased by 3% to SG$1.17 billion. <br/><br/>Net loss for Singtel was SG$668 million as the company posted a negative SG$1.4 billion exceptional item related to Airtel, which it pinned as <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/airtel-pinned-for-dragging-singtel-q1-down/">dragging down its previous quarter</a> as well.</p>
