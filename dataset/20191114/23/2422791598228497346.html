      <p>TORONTO -- Does Bigfoot exist? And if so, is it Canadian?</p>
      <p>Ontario hunter Gino Meekis <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo4VdvjTw3Y">recorded videos </a>of strange, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stISzPngwh4">loud, echoing howls </a>in the woods that have left biologists scratching their heads.</p>
      <p>He’d never “heard anything like this before,” he told CTVNews.ca in a phone interview. “It was more bass-y than anything I’ve heard scream before.”</p>
      <p>Meekis, who lives near Sioux Lookout in northern Ontario, took the footage on Oct. 3 while he was hunting grouse with his wife and grandson. The young child can be heard appearing to mimic the strange noises.</p>
      <p>The trio first heard the odd howling as they made their way back to their car at the end of the trail along the Vermilion River.</p>
      <p>Initially, Meekis thought it was a moose or a bear. “But then I started thinking of all the animals in the area -- I’d heard during my life -- and it didn’t match,” he said.</p>
      <p>“At first, I wasn’t scared because it sounded kind of far from where we were,” he added. “It sounded like it was a kilometre away. So if it started coming, (we had) enough time to get out of there.”</p>
      <p>“We could hear it moving … it sounded kind of heavy,” Meekis said. “But my wife, she got scared … picked up (our grandson) and started walking fast towards the vehicle.”</p>

        <b>GOV’T UNCERTAIN WHAT NOISE WAS</b>
      </p>
      <p>And if you’re looking for answers from the government, the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry’s guess is no better than anyone else’s.</p>
      <p>“Our biologists say it could be a larger mammal – for example a wolf – but because of a considerable distance from the recorder there is no way to be certain,” ministry spokesperson Jolanta Kowalski wrote in an email to CTVNews.ca.</p>
      <p>Since Meekis posted two YouTube videos of the interaction, they’ve both gone viral, racking up more than 303,000 views combined.</p>
      <p>In the comment sections, users have suggested the noise may have been the urban legend Bigfoot or a giant bear. Meekis said he can’t figure it out: “I’m in the same boat as them since I heard it.”</p>
      <p>Some users have accused Meekis of orchestrating a hoax, but he called that theory absurd. “They think there’s a speaker or a recording playing something,” he said. “I didn’t go out that day to deceive people.”</p>
      <p>None of his hunter friends have been able to put their finger on it either.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think we’ll ever find out,” Meekis said.</p>
