      <h1>Sask. teachers declare impasse, ask for conciliation</h1>
      <h2>The STF president said he sees no other way forward as the two sides remain far apart on compensation and whether class sizes should even be on the table.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T23:42:59+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 23:42</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://leaderpost.com/author/awhitecrummey" target="_blank">Arthur White-Crummey</a></address>
      <p>The Saskatchewan Teachers’ Federation (STF) has declared an impasse in bargaining for a new contract, as the government refuses to budge on class-size demands the education minister warned would lead to chaos in the classrooms.</p>
      <p>STF president Pat Maze told reporters on Thursday that he sees no other option than conciliation as talks broke down over class size, composition and teacher compensation. He said the STF applied for a conciliator through the Education Relations Board on Thursday morning.</p>
      <p>“We’ve decided that, after seven months of negotiating, it really doesn’t seem like government is interested in listening to our concerns,” said Maze.</p>
      <p>Education Minister Gord Wyant said the government is disappointed but will present its case at conciliation. He argued that the offer from the Government Trustee Bargaining Committee is fair.</p>
      <p>The two sides remain far apart on all of the STF’s priority issues. Teachers are seeking three years of three per cent raises, while the government has offered a one-time payout of $1,500 in year one followed by two years of two per cent hikes.</p>
      <p><a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/local-news/stf-wont-participate-in-government-class-size-composition-committee/wcm/c6c166f8-4d72-42ed-b333-855265a1572f">But the deepest divide is over the twin concerns of class size and composition</a>, meaning the number of students in need of extra supports in the classroom. The average class size in Regina and Saskatoon is about 25, though some are larger and many include students with complex needs. Teachers have sought to negotiate a solution at the bargaining table.</p>
      <p>The government has refused, instead pitching a separate committee that the STF refuses to participate in.</p>
      <p>Maze said the committee is “weighted in favour of government,” since five of nine members come from the government or the Saskatchewan School Boards Association. He said teachers have no faith in the committee.</p>
      <p>Wyant told reporters on Thursday that he won’t concede on that point, saying the committee — not the bargaining table — is the only place to have those discussions. According to Wyant, settling class size and composition through a collective agreement would be disastrous. He argued that it would turn teachers, principles and administrators into “compliance agents.”</p>
      <p>“If you go to look at jurisdictions where class size and composition have been included, quite frankly it’s a mess, and we’ve talked to those jurisdictions, particularly in British Columbia,” he said.</p>
      <p>“We’re not prepared to introduce that kind of chaos into our collective agreement or into our education system in Saskatchewan and so my position continues to be firm.”</p>
      <p>But Maze thinks teacher advocacy is the only reason Wyant is talking about action on class sizes at all. He said bargaining is the only way to compel the government to commit more funding for classrooms.</p>
      <p>“That’s the only process that has some teeth,” he said.</p>
      <p>Maze also argued that the class size and composition issue is closely connected to workload for teachers.</p>
      <p>“Class size has crept up. The diversity has increased,” said Maze. “So we’re actually wanting some form of compensation to address the concerns that teachers are working harder, quite simply.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/saskatchewan/sgeu-members-ratify-deal-with-zeros-covering-11000-public-sector-workers">Other public sector union locals have accepted or tentatively accepted far less generous deals</a>. The government has suggested that even a one per cent salary increase across the public sector would cost $80 million, erasing any hope of a balanced budget.</p>
      <p>Maze rejected that argument.</p>
      <p>“I think they’re trying to balance their budget on our students’ backs and we’re not going to accept that,” he said.</p>
      <p>Asked about whether job action will come next if conciliation fails, Maze said he hopes it doesn’t come to that. But he warned teachers won’t shrink from a fight.</p>
      <p>“I’ve never seen so much resolve from teachers right across the province,” he said. “They want to do their best for their students and under the current conditions, they’re not able to.”</p>
      <p>NDP education critic Carla Beck accused the government of not bargaining in good faith for refusing to discuss the STF’s main issues.</p>
      <p>“The minister needs to understand that we do have chaos in many classrooms right now, that we have unchecked growth and increased complexity in the classroom that simply is not being addressed,” she said.</p>
      <p>“I think the trajectory that we’re on currently is divisive and I lay that at the lap of the minister and the government.”</p>
      <p>She shared Maze’s hope that job action can be avoided and said it’s up to the ministry to find common ground.</p>
      <p>Wyant said he believes teachers will come to support the government’s offer. He noted that conciliations isn’t binding. In his view, job action is against the interests of kids and teachers.</p>
      <p>“We certainly hope it doesn’t come to that,” said Wyant. “But by the same token, we’re not going to vary from the position that we put forward on that issue.”</p>
