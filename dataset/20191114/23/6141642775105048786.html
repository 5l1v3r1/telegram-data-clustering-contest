      <p>Republic of Ireland boss Mick McCarthy welcomed teenager Troy Parrott to “men’s football” after seeing the striker hold his own on his senior international debut.</p>
      <p>The 17-year-old Tottenham frontman was thrown in at the deep end in the 3-1 friendly victory over New Zealand at the Aviva Stadium and although he did not emerge with the goal he craved, he furthered his football education after a run-in with experienced defender Winston Reid.</p>
      <p>McCarthy said: “Oh, he can handle himself at this level, I don’t doubt that. He was tracking back and he tackled their centre-half and he got all upset [Reid].</p>

      <p>“Welcome to men’s football, because then he was getting a little bit bullied by him. But he stood up to it, and he’s done fine.”</p>
      <p>Parrott was thrilled to make his senior debut after excelling at underage level and while he knows he still has much to learn, he has embarked upon a steep learning curve.</p>
      <p>The teenager said: “Of course I have been satisfied with the strides I’ve been making as I’ve made my debut for Tottenham and I’ve come in here and made my debut for Ireland.</p>

      <p>Parrott has inevitably been compared to Robbie Keane, who was handed his debut by McCarthy at the same age back in 1998 and went on to score a record 68 goals in 146 appearances for Ireland.</p>
      <p>However, McCarthy is refusing to put any pressure on a man who has only three appearances to his name for the under-21s.</p>
      <p>The Ireland boss said: “Troy did okay. He didn’t set the world on fire, but what he did I was really pleased with.</p>
      <p>“He ran the channels, had a couple of chances… I know everyone is desperate for him to score, but the keeper thwarted him. I was pleased, overall.”</p>

      <p>If Parrott did not cap his big night with a goal, three of his team-mates did, and they chose the perfect moment to do so ahead of Monday night’s crucial Euro 2020 qualifier against Denmark.</p>
      <p>Blackburn defender Derrick Williams cancelled out All Whites debutant Callum McCowatt’s opener with a header on the stroke of half-time, and Sean Maguire and substitute Callum Robinson struck after the break, all three registering for their country for the first time.</p>
      <p>McCarthy said: “Yes, I’m satisfied. I thought we played some decent football in the first half, but I could see their goal coming.</p>
      <p>“It was a good goal by them, but I wasn’t happy with the way we let them through us, so that was a bit disappointing.</p>
      <p>“But it was great that the lads got their first goals for the country, the debutants all did well in the game, so I’m really pleased.”</p>
