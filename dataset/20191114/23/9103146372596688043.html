        <b>Ssebaana Kizito  (1998-2005)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ssebaana Kizito was born in on 12 September 1934 and died on 3rd July 2017, Nakasero Hospital. Ssebaana went to King's College Budo and later to Makerere University. He also held a Masters of Arts degree in Economics received from the University of Oregon in Eugene in the US.</p>

      <p>He engaged in civil service as well as politics through Uganda's different regimes, including Idi Amin's, Milton Obote's and President Yoweri Museveni's leadership. From 1977 until 1980, Ssebaana worked as the chairman of National Insurance Corporation, after which he was elected Member of Parliament for Kampala South. He was also shadow minister of foreign affairs between 1981 and 1985, during which he was also Acting Leader of the Opposition.</p>

      <p>His vast political journey would later see him twice elected Kampala Mayor (between 1998 and 2006). This role was a sort of a ping-pong affair with Hajji Nasser Sebaggala. At first, Ssebaana replaced Sebaggala in 1999 before tables turned and he was replaced by Sebaggala himself in 2006.</p>

      <p>Another chapter of his political career saw Ssebaana run for the top seat in the 2006 presidential election as DP's flagbearer. In February 2002, Ssebaana again stood as a mayoral candidate and was re-elected.</p>
      <p>Ssebaana was replaced by Nasser Ssebagala who was also later replaced by Erias Lukwago.  Ssebana Kizito as the lord mayor was able to work with NRM representatives very well and appointed them to various positions and he did a lot in his regime.</p>

      <p>Ssebaana's lobbying for funds to construct the Nakivubo Channel was well utilized and the balance used to build the Rubaga and Kampala Central Division head offices. Roads were also built especially in Makindye as well as the installation of street lights in Gaba, Kabalagala, and Kansanga.</p>
      <p>The then-mayor also passed a number of ordinances, including the Solid Waste Management and Private Schools ordinances.</p>

        <b>Nasser Ntege Ssebagala (1998-2010)</b>
      </p>
      <p>He was the first directly elected mayor of Kampala in 1998-2010 and the first one to lose office as Kampala mayor because of court conviction.  Sebaggala’s problems were unique.</p>

      <p>After winning the first direct elections, Sebaggala who had created the impression as the mayor of the ‘illiterate’ class, was looked at as a lucky man. On several occasions, he failed to express himself in English, but he was still elected to the office, defeating candidates like Peter Ssematimba whose command of the English language is unquestionable.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>After securing the surprising victory, Sebaggala went to the US on official duty. While there, he was arrested and charged on eight counts of fraud before being sentenced to 15 months in jail.</p>

      </figure>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Because Sebaggala was academically lacking, he relied on powerful allies in the council, some of whom made decisions for their own benefit at the expense of the voters.</p>

      <p><b>Erias Lukwago (Ssaalongo) (2011 to date)</b> </p>
      <p>Lukwago was elected on 14 January 2011. He was born on 11th May 1970, he is a Lawyer by profession and a politician.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>From the time Erias Lukwago assumed office in 2011, he got entangled in power wrangles with city executive director, Jennifer Musisi. Lukwago accused Musisi of usurping his powers. But Musisi insisted she was working within the limits of the Kampala Capital City Authority (KCCA) Act.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>The battle between the two persisted until councilors petitioned the minister in charge of Kampala, Frank Tumwebaze, to intervene. The councilors accused Lukwago of failing to call meetings and fighting the KCCA tax project.</p>

      <p>Lukwago was once arrested by Police from his home as he was preparing to leave in a procession to the city Center to demonstrate against age limit removal.</p>
