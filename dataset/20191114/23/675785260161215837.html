      <p>They continued: "Details are being finalised, but it's all looking really hopeful and positive. Currently there are just plans for shows and maybe a few new tracks.</p>
      <p>"But if it really takes off for them it could fully relaunch the band."</p>

      <p>Aston took to the dance floor for the 15th series of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/strictly-come-dancing">Strictly Come Dancing</a> .</p>
      <p>Marvin - who is married to former Saturday Rochelle Humes - has forged a hugely successful broadcasting career.</p>
      <p>JB became a presenter on childrens' TV and began hosting Songs of Praise back in 2017.</p>
      <p>Oritse has had difficult three years yet he was recently cleared of rape claims.</p>
      <p>In May, he was unanimously cleared at Wolverhampton Crown Court.</p>
      <p>"It's been horrific," he said on Good Morning Britain. "I haven't been able to work for three years. I had this accusation hanging over my head every single day from when I woke up to when I went to sleep. It's just completely tormented me."</p>
