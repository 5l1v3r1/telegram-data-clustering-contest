      <p>The boys appeared in the "Mean Tweets" segment. The "Mean Tweets" segment features the Jimmy Kimmel team searching through a lot of tweets to find some of the not-so-nice things people write and then turn them over to the people they were written about. As you can see in the segment, this was filmed with all 7 members <a href="https://www.allkpop.com/article/2019/10/starship-entertainment-announces-wonhos-exit-from-monsta-x">including the recently departed Wonho.</a></p>
