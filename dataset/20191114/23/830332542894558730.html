      <p>"They destroy your property, destroy your beliefs and this has what America has become now," Buchmeier said in a Facebook video showcasing the damage. </p>
      <p>Buchmeier said both her American flag and President Donald Trump flag were ripped up and the words "Make a racist son" were spray-painted on the side of her home. A symbol that Buchmeier believes represents satanic anarchy was spray-painted beside the words. </p>
      <p>"I don't care what anybody believes or wants as far as a president, this is not OK," Buchmeier said in a Facebook video. "I don't care what other people think. I display my pride in my American flag and my beliefs. This is wrong in so many ways. It really saddens me that we have come to this."</p>
      <p>Buchmeier said she understands the vandalism to the Trump flag, but when she saw someone had destroyed her American flag, she said, "It just breaks my heart that somebody would do this to something that means so much to so many people. Everyone and every family that I know has someone that's served or is currently serving and we are so appreciative of those men and women and you just made a statement that that means nothing to you."</p>
      <p>Buchmeier said she filed a police report.</p>
      <p>"It's hard to hold back tears that I cannot even be the American that I want to be," she said. </p>
      <p>Buchmeier said people have offered her free flag replacements and free repairs to the side of her home. </p>
      <p>If you have any information that could lead to someone's arrest, you are asked to call Madison Area Crime Stoppers. </p>
