      <p>The Atlanta Braves signed All-Star closer Will Smith to a three-year, $39 million contract Thursday. The deal includes a 2023 club option for $13 million.</p>
      <p>The 30-year-old left-hander was an All-Star with the San Francisco Giants in 2019, finishing 6-0 with 34 saves and a 2.76 ERA in 63 appearances.</p>
      <p>Smith struck out 96 batters and walked 21 in 65 1/3 innings, holding opponents to a .196 average. Left-handed hitters batted just .157 against him with two extra-base hits.</p>
      <p>Smith is 26-22 with a 3.53 ERA and 49 saves in 359 career games with the Giants (2016, 2018-19), Milwaukee Brewers (2014-16) and Kansas City Royals (2012-13). He missed the 2017 season after having Tommy John surgery on his left elbow.</p>
