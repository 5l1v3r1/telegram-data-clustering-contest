      <p>But many people did not find the clip funny, pointing out that the less fortunate often go hungry.</p>
      <p>“Not Cool! So many people don’t have food it’s Very sad to see that,” wrote one person.</p>
      <p>Another added, “people are starving khlo.”</p>
      <p>And the comments didn’t end there. “Wasteful” is one word that was used often.</p>
      <p>“Because y’all rich y’all gon waste all that damn food,” read an additional comment, where someone else pointed out, “you all need to come to MEXICO and see how children starving to dead.”</p>
      <p>In the clip, Khloe did call out her family’s behaviour as “unacceptable.”</p>

      <p>“Am I bothered by this food fight right now? Who the f** wouldn’t be bothered by this?” she said during her one-on-one to the camera. “This is, in any normal person’s world, bizarre, disturbing, and unacceptable.”</p>
      <p>However, the laughing emoji on her Instagram post gives off the opposite feeling.</p>
