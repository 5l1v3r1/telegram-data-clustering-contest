      <p><a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/rage-2/40367"><i>Rage 2</i></a><i> </i>has a new zombie-themed DLC expansion coming, just in time for Thanksgiving.</p>
      <p>In TerrorMania, players will take on hordes of racist uncles, canned gravy mutants, and Durkee fried onions, and — oh wait, that’s <i>next month’s DLC</i>. Sorry! TerrorMania pits the player against “skeletal forces of darkness,” apparently bargain hunters scarfing up this year’s stale Halloween candy and decorations at the local Big Lots.</p>
      <p>It’s plainly late, but at least it’s free. Players will battle the Army of the Dead against <i>Rage</i><i> 2</i>’s other factions, in a new location — The Deadlands, which is “an alternate reality version of the wasteland.” There’s a new weapon, the Sword of Transitus, as loot.</p>
      <p>Bethesda Softworks announced its post-launch DLC ambitions for <i>Rage 2 </i><a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/4RaQB7ylQPgNXNycKtOGGE/rage-2-update-2-and-new-roadmap">back in July</a>, but it’s apparent that everything since then has gotten pushed back a month. The game’s first expansion, Rise of the Ghosts, was originally intended for an August release and it ended up launching at the end of September.</p>
      <p>And technically — which everyone knows is the best kind of correct — Bethesda did <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/cX7iWXU2VSAXxy1noD0Wz/rage-2-terrormania-expansion">sneak in TerrorMania’s announcement before Halloween</a>, even if it’s now launching three weeks after all the Jack O’Lanterns have rotted.</p>
      <p>Astute aficionados of ironic post-apocalyptic shooters also know that this isn’t the first piece of Halloween-themed DLC to come out past the expiration date of a fun-sized Zagnut. A decade ago, <i>Borderlands</i><i> </i>received the <i>Zombie Island of Dr. Ned</i> expansion on Nov. 24, 2009 — two days before Turkey Day.</p>
