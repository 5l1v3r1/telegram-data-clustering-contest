      <h1>Ashkelon Nixes School Friday Due to Ceasefire Violations, Rocket Fire</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T23:28:23+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 23:28</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.jewishpress.com/author/hlj/" target="_blank">Hana Levi Julian</a></address>
      <p>The city of Ashkelon announced late Thursday night that it, too, will close its schools Friday due to the risk of rocket fire, according to a report by Israel’s <i>Channel 12</i> television news.</p>
      <p>The announcement was made after Gaza terrorists launched their late-night attack on Israel shortly after 10 pm, violating the so-called “ceasefire” brokered by Egypt between Israel and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad terror group for the fourth time since it began 5 am Thursday morning.</p>

      <p>Community leaders have already announced their decision to close schools Friday in the Eshkol, Sdot Negev, Shaar Hanegev and Ashkelon Coast (Hof Ashkelon) Regional Council districts, as well as in the city of Sderot.</p>
      <p>There were nearly a dozen ceasefire violations on Thursday alone. Within a 48 hour period between Tuesday and Wednesday, more than 450 rockets and missiles were launched at Israel from Gaza.</p>
