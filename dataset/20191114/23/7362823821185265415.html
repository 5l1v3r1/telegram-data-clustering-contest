      <h1>Esper says military academy athletes can delay service to go pro, reversing Mattis decision</h1>

      <p>Athletes attending U.S. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/military">military</a> academies can now delay entry into the armed forces upon graduation to play professional <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports">sports</a> if they make the cut.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/defense/secretary-of-defense">Defense Secretary Mark Esper</a> signed a memo last week that allows students attending service academies such as <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/west-point-army-award-afghanistan">West Point</a> and the Naval Academy to seek a waiver that would delay their entry into the armed forces so they could play professional sports.</p>

      <p>The waiver would have to be approved by the defense secretary, and the athletes must eventually fulfill their military obligation or repay the cost of their education.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump">President Trump</a> asked Esper in May to come up with a policy to allow athletes to play professional sports upon graduation.</p>
      <p>Other service academy graduates can elect to attend prestigious graduate school programs and also delay entry into the armed forces.</p>

      <p>The decision reverses a policy by former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, who argued that the academies exist to train military officers, period.</p>
