      <p>BMW M CEO Markus Flasch introduces the all-new M8 Gran Coupe (F93) alongside its Coupe and Convertible siblings. Now, the high-end fleet of performance luxury models is complete. The 4-minute video takes a tour of the complete M8 lineup with Mr. Flasch presenting the latest masterpieces of his division. The first is the M8 Competition Coupe (F92) showcased in BMW Individual Malachite Green metallic color, followed by the M8 Competition Convertible (F91) specced in BMW Individual Frozen Silver paint finish and, last but surely not least, the new M8 Competition Gran Coupe (F93) adorned in a deep <a href="https://www.bmwblog.com/2019/09/11/2019-iaa-bmw-x7-in-the-bmw-individual-ametrin-metallic-color/">BMW Individual Ametrin metallic</a> shade.</p>

      <p>The new M8 Gran Coupe rounds up beautifully the fleet M at the upper end of the BMW portfolio. Its sleek and muscular design is characterized by a unique interpretation of the four-door coupe concept. The roof line is decisively low and rakish, extending virtually to the rear-end of the car thanks to the flowing design theme that was adopted.</p>
      <p>The key visual of the side profile, the iconic Hofmeister kink, is reinterpreted in a fashionable manner that perfectly integrates it into the whole styling. The powerful rear end is a complete eye-catcher, with its generously proportioned trunk spoiler, larger the one seen on the Coupe and Convertible versions.</p>

      <p>Inside, the pictured F93 is styled in a very elegant BMW Individual Silverstone gray-colored full leather upholstery, which adds a distinctive and upscale touch to the whole cabin. New is the M steering wheel with M1/M2 red buttons and the stylish M electronic gear lever finished in metal and leather with contrast stitching in M colors and an embossed M logo.</p>
      <p>For Markus Flasch, this new BMW M8 Gran Coupe seems to be a wonderful achievement. It is no surprise that he kind of discloses the F93 M8 as his favorite of the three variants. Frankly, it is obvious why he picked the performance four-door coupe.</p>
