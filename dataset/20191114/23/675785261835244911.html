      <p>EastEnders viewers were left reeling as Mel Owen was killed off in tragic scenes on Thursday, moments after a deadly crash.</p>
      <p>Tamzin Outhwaite bowed out of the role, with the character introduced to the BBC soap in 1998.</p>
      <p>Mel had only returned to Walford last year after initially departing in 2002, following the death of husband Steve Owen.</p>
      <p>In her final moments, still grieving the loss of her son Hunter who was killed during the siege in September, Mel stepped out into the path of an incoming lorry.</p>
      <p>She had just been saved from a burning car wreck by enemy Sharon Mitchell, only to be killed off in the same episode just as fans believed she was going to be okay.</p>

      <p>After the episode aired on BBC, actress Tamzin thanked fans for their support as she spoke of the death for the first time.</p>
      <p>Having filmed her final scenes weeks ago, keeping quiet until now, she took to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> to address her final episode.</p>
      <p>She said: "Thank you all ... tonight thankfully I’m busy as I’m too emotional to address any <a href="https://twitter.com/bbceastenders">@bbceastenders</a> messages tonight... but..." with a praying emoji.</p>

      <p>Viewers raced to comment under the message, praising the character for her time on the soap.</p>
      <p>Mel has been at the centre of some huge storylines since her original stint and her more recent stay in Walford.</p>
      <p>From her doomed wedding to Ian Beale back in 1999 and the loss of husband Steve Owen in 2002, to the more recent tragedy - she's faced a lot of heartache.</p>

      <p>Earlier this year her latest husband Ray Kelly was killed by her son Hunter after he tried to murder her.</p>
      <p>Then Hunter was killed after he took hostages in The Queen Vic, with him shot dead by police as he tried to kill pregnant Louise Mitchell - having already shot her brother Ben and fiancé Keanu Taylor.</p>
      <p>In the past weeks she's battled with her grief for her only child, desperate for revenge on the Mitchells.</p>
      <p>This revenge and the struggle to get over Hunter's death ultimately led to her own demise in heartbreaking scenes.</p>
