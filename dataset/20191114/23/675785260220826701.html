      <p>EastEnders Christmas is fast approaching, with spoilers and storylines for the 2019 festive period slowly being confirmed - including a return, an exit and a hostage drama.</p>
      <p>It's already been revealed that the Mitchells will take centre stage this year, as a shock affair is exposed causing devastation and drama.</p>
      <p>It's also been teased a big return is on the cards, with the character in particular having a festive plot of their own.</p>
      <p>Now, with Mel Owen dead and Lisa Fowler exposing Sharon Mitchell's baby secret, fans really don't know what to expect.</p>
      <p>Ahead of the official spoilers being confirmed by the BBC soap, with this thought to be just weeks away, here's what characters you can expect to see over the festive period and what plots are set to hit Walford.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h3>Sheanu affair explodes</h3>
      <p>Sharon Mitchell and Keanu Taylor's affair will explode with dramatic consequences this Christmas.</p>
      <p>After a fling last year the pair slept together again earlier on this year, with Sharon falling pregnant.</p>

      <p>Her pregnancy news came just days after her stepdaughter Louise Mitchell learned she too was pregnant with Keanu's baby - leading to the couple reconciling. Phil, meanwhile, thinks his wife's baby is his.</p>
      <p>The truth will finally come out in Christmas Day's huge episode, while it's not known how or whether Sharon or Louise will have had their babies at this point.</p>

      <p>Boss Kate Oates has promised several surprising characters will be caught up in the big event, as the secret is exposed with horrifying consequences.</p>
      <p>Cast members Danny Walters and Max Bowden, who play Keanu and Ben Mitchell, both promised "heart-wrenching" scenes, while also teasing a showdown for their characters.</p>
      <p>There's also been hints at some stunts for the big episodes.</p>
      <p>Lisa Fowler appeared to foreshadow the events in a recent episode hinting at a "bloodbath" for the family. Life for the Mitchells will never be the same again!</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Lisa did tell Phil in a recent episode that he wasn't the father of Sharon's baby, after Mel told her about Sharon's secret - but with Mel dead, will Phil believe her?</p>
      <h3>Mel Owen's revenge from beyond the grave?</h3>
      <p>Viewers were shocked when Mel Owen, played by Tamzin Outhwaite, was killed off in November.</p>
      <p>After a car chase with Sharon, as she prepared to tell Phil about the baby not being his, she crashed.</p>
      <p>Sharon managed to pull her out the burning wreckage, only for Mel to walk into the path of an incoming lorry, believing she was talking to her dead son Hunter.</p>

      <p>Fans were stunned as they believed Mel would be the one to unleash Christmas drama and expose Sharon and Keanu.</p>

      <p>New pictures from the cast filming on location show terror ahead for Linda Carter, as she appears to be kidnapped by Martin Fowler.</p>
      <p>He grabs the screaming character in a mystery location, which seems pretty empty, with the troubled character waving a gun around.</p>
      <p>Details on the plot have yet to be revealed - but will Martin end up killing someone?</p>
      <h3>Keanu Taylor killed off as actor leaves?</h3>

      <p>Danny Walters has confirmed he is leaving the role of Keanu Taylor - with viewers convinced he will die.</p>
      <p>Will Phil Mitchell take a deadly revenge for his fling with wife Sharon, or will son Ben finally take him down as their rivalry reaches dangerous heights?</p>
      <p>With him also on location for the Martin and Linda scenes, will he take a bullet when the gun goes off?</p>
      <p>Could Lisa, Sharon or even Louise be behind his exit and possible demise? Fans will have to wait and see.</p>
      <h3>Kim Fox's return</h3>

      <p>Kim Fox has been confirmed to be heading back to Walford this Christmas, for a new storyline.</p>
      <p>The actress told the Daily Star: "Kim has been working in Scotland as a tour guide. If anyone can do that, it's Kim.</p>
      <p>"But she's coming back soon. And I'm hoping it will be a big storyline. With Kim Fox it’s got to be big. We can't just have her turning up at the cafe.</p>
      <p>"I don’t know what I'll be doing. All I know is it will be a Christmas cracker!"</p>
      <h3>What else is going on?</h3>

      <p>At the moment fans are fearing Honey Mitchell could be battling an eating disorder, amid her heartache over partner Adam cheating on her.</p>
      <p>The Panesar brothers have just arrived in Walford, with a family feud brewing between them and their sister Ash.</p>
      <p>Tiffany and Keegan are facing trouble of their own amid their plans to get married.</p>
      <p>There's no confirmation that any of these storylines will be part of Christmas in Walford, but there will no doubt be new scenes to come in the weeks leading up to the festive episodes.</p>
