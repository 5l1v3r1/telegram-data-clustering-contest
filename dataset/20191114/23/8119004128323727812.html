        <b>MPs of both ruling and opposition parties have expressed frustrations in parliament over the rising prices of onion.</b>
      </p>
      <p>They also urged the government to check if there is any conspiracy behind the onion market turbulence as prices crossed Tk 200 a kg on Thursday.<br/><br/>In reaction to the MPs’ anger, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina narrated government efforts to calm the market.<br/><br/>The Trading Corporation of Bangladesh started selling onion at TK 45 a kg, she said. <br/><br/>Besides, businessmen opened LCs to import 50,000 tonnes of onion and the consignments would arrive in a few days, Hasina said.<br/><br/>“I’ve ordered the TCB to distribute those onions immediately on arrival.” The TCB will use trucks to sell onions in every district.<br/><br/>She also said researches are underway to boost onion farming throughout the year so that Bangladesh does not need to depend on other countries.<br/><br/>Awami League leader Mohammed Nasim started the discussion urging Commerce Minister Tipu Munshi and Finance Minister AHM Mustafa Kamal to take steps.</p>

      <p>Nasim described how the people were reacting to the hike in onion prices. <br/><br/>Former commerce minister Tofail Ahmed said the situation would not have taken place if the government had evaluated demand and supply and imported the product accordingly earlier. <br/><br/>Awami League leader ASM Feroz said he saw no reason behind the price hike as onion was not in short supply.<br/><br/>“I believe there is a conspiracy behind such price hike. The government must take steps against corrupt businessmen,” he said.<br/><br/>The Jatiya Party’s Mujibul Haque Chunnu also took part in the discussion.</p>
