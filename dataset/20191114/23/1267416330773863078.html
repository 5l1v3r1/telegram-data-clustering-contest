      <h1>Amazon files to trademark ‘Amazon Wallet’ in Canada</h1>
      <h2>Amazon Wallet initially rolled out in 2014 and died in 2015</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T23:43:28+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 23:43</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mobilesyrup.com/author/dean-daley" target="_blank">Dean Daley</a></address>
      <p>Amazon has filed a trademark for ‘Amazon Wallet’ with the <a href="https://www.ic.gc.ca/app/opic-cipo/trdmrks/srch/viewTrademark?id=1992926&amp;lang=eng&amp;tab=reg&amp;posNum=10&amp;search=%7B%22selectField1%22%3A%22tm%22%2C%22textField1%22%3A%22amazon%22%2C%22category%22%3A%22%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22%22%2C%22status%22%3A%22%22%2C%22viennaField%22%3A%5B%5D%2C%22searchDates%22%3A%5B%7B%22dateType%22%3A%22filedate%22%2C%22beginDate%22%3A%222019-01-01%22%2C%22endDate%22%3A%222019-11-14%22%7D%5D%2C%22selectMaxDoc%22%3A%22500%22%2C%22language%22%3A%22eng%22%7D&amp;length=25&amp;start=0">Canadian Intellectual Property Office</a> (CIPO).</p>
      <p>Amazon filed the trademark on October 29th, but it has yet to be officially formalized by the Canadian government.</p>
      <p>Amazon Wallet, which initially<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/7/22/5926415/amazon-wallet-app-launches-gift-loyalty-card-storing"> rolled out in 2014</a> in the U.S., was an all-in-one vault for loyalty cards and gift cards. However, Amazon killed <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/amazon-to-fold-its-mobile-wallet-app-beta-on-wednesday/">Wallet six months after it launched.</a></p>
      <p>It’s possible, however, that the U.S.-based company might be bringing back the app with a set of new features.</p>
      <p>The filing indicates that Amazon Wallet is used to store credit and debit card information and can make payments, similar to <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/08/24/google-pay-dark-mode/">Google Pay.</a> But when Amazon released Wallet back in 2014, it was unable to store credit or debit card information and was only used for gift and loyalty cards.</p>
      <p>But it’s possible that the description just describes the closest classification closest to the original Amazon Wallet app.</p>
      <p>It’s currently unclear what Amazon has up its sleeves; however, it might be a while before we find out.</p>
      <p>Apple submitted the trademark for<a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/07/17/apple-files-trademark-apple-cash-canada-apple-pay-cash-registered/"> ‘Apple Card’ and ‘Apple Cash’</a> back in July, but we’ve yet to hear any information about either feature coming north of the border.</p>
