      <p>After 4000 South Australians told us what mattered to them — Your Say SA 2020 survey has closed. We reveal the results of the state’s biggest survey on January 5, 2020.</p>
      <p>The Sunday Mail’s annual Your Say SA survey is back.</p>
      <p>While this year’s survey revisits some previous themes, it also focuses on South Australia’s “2020 Vision” — the big issues that will shape the future of our state over the next decade.</p>
      <p>The 100-question survey spans topics including the economy, health, education, climate change and the cost of living, and should take 15-20 minutes to complete.</p>
      <p>This year’s survey was filled out by <a href="https://www.perthnow.com.au/f34af3f18febe1a03541d738c748c8c3">more than 4300 respondents</a>.</p>
