      <h1>Netflix set to produce fourth instalment of ‘Beverly Hills Cop’</h1>
      <h2>It has been 25 years since the release of Beverly Hills Cop 3</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T23:54:16+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 23:54</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mobilesyrup.com/author/aisha-malik" target="_blank">Aisha Malik</a></address>
      <p>Netflix has made a deal with Paramount to make a fourth <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/beverly-hills-cop-sequel-netflix-eddie-murphy-jerry-bruckheimer-paramount-license-deal-1202785458/"><i>Beverly Hills Cop</i></a> movie with Eddie Murphy and Jerry Bruckheimer.</p>
      <p>The one-time licensing deal with the streaming service will allow Netflix to produce a fourth instalment of the franchise that will stream exclusively on its platform. If everything goes well with the fourth instalment, the contract includes the opportunity for Netflix to produce a <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/beverly-hills-cop-sequel-netflix-eddie-murphy-jerry-bruckheimer-paramount-license-deal-1202785458/">fifth movie</a> in the future.</p>
      <p>Paramount has previously attempted to revive <i>Beverly Hill Cop</i> in a number different ways, including a rumoured TV series that was going to feature Murphy, which never ended up happening.</p>
      <p>This is the third time that Paramount has formed a deal with the streaming service. Netflix previously formed successful deals with Paramount for distribution rights for <i>Annihilation</i> and <i>The Cloverfield Paradox</i>.</p>
      <p>However, this time around, Netflix has control over the director and script of the movie, while also being financially responsible for the movie.</p>
