      <h1>Surrey RCMP doesn’t expect big hit in light of projected $10M cut in B.C. budget</h1>
      <h2>Public safety minister says RCMP informed province about projected budget deficit</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T23:15:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 23:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.northdeltareporter.com/author/lauren-collins/" target="_blank">Lauren Collins</a></address>
      <p>Surrey RCMP’s operating budgets “will not be touched” despite a projected $10-million cut for RCMP’s policing costs in B.C.</p>
      <p>The RCMP must cut more than $10 million from its policing costs in B.C., as first reported by the Vancouver Sun after obtaining a copy of an email from the province’s top Mountie, Deputy Commissioner Jennifer Strachan.</p>
      <p>Surrey RCMP Constable Richard Wright said the detachment doesn’t know which portion of the budget is being cut.</p>
      <p>“We don’t know if it’s going to affect anything that affects Surrey, whether it’s going to be the investigational or the training or something like that,” Wright told the <i>Now-Leader, </i>adding that he can’t speak to how the budget has been “trimmed.”</p>
      <p>Under the City of Surrey’s current contract, the city pays 90 per cent of the RCMP’s costs and the federal government pays the remaining 10 per cent.</p>
      <p>Late Thursday, director of B.C. RCMP communications Dawn Roberts emphasized that the cuts are still just a projection, and the first things on the chopping block are travel expenses, overtime, non-mandatory training, and new equipment.</p>
      <p>That won’t be enough, however, she added, so senior officers will need to discuss options with the province.</p>
      <p>“We’re trying to be as transparent as possible. We do not want to impact front-line policing operations,” Roberts told Black Press Media in a phone interview.</p>
      <p>When asked whether integrated units could be affected, she said: “All of us are looking at our spending envelope and seeing whether or not we can make reductions.”</p>
      <p>Integrated units would include the Integrated Homicide Investigation Team and Combined Forces Special Enforcement Unit B.C., which are both run out of the BC RCMP’s headquarters in Surrey.</p>
      <p>In a statement to Black Press Media on Thursday, Public Safety Minister Mike Farnworth said the RCMP has informed the province about a projected budget deficit, and that the impact of budget constraints and inflation has become increasingly difficult to manage.</p>
      <p>“This has not impacted significant and continued provincial and federal investments into gangs and organized crime initiatives and prevention,” he said, adding that that includes the integrated anti-gang team, the Combined Forces Special Enforcement Unit.</p>
      <p>Brian Sauve, president of the National Police Federation, said he’s seen the internal email, and called the projected $10-million gap “deeply concerning.”</p>
      <p>His main questions focus on how to maintain adequate levels of service and ensure staff receive enough down time. He said he’s seen mention of a “possible freeze” in staffing areas such as transfers and promotions.</p>
      <p>However, Sauve said a lack of funding is nothing new.</p>
      <p>“Whether it has to do with extra work or working harder to get the job done, they’ll still do it,” he told Black Press Media by phone.</p>
      <p>The RCMP has not had union representation until now. The federation was finally certified as the official bargaining agent earlier this year following a historic court ruling in 2015.</p>
      <p>Sauve said it will take time to influence budget and other negotiations, but he hopes to provide “the other side of the story” soon.</p>
      <p>The Mounties’ B.C. division has not yet returned a request for comment.</p>
