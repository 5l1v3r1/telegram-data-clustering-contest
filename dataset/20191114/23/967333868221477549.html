        <b>A new report from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has found that previous death toll estimates of victims of drug-resistant infections may have unknowingly minimized the actual public health risk.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The CDC’s <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/pdf/threats-report/2019-ar-threats-report-508.pdf">2019 AR Threats Report</a> revealed earlier this week that there are over 2.8 million antibiotic-resistant bacteria and fungi infections in US people each year, and more than 35,000 people die as a result.</p>
      <p>This new government estimate presents a sharp uptick from the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/threat-report-2013/pdf/ar-threats-2013-508.pdf">2013 publication</a>, which was the first report of its kind and said at least 23,000 of the 2 million infected individuals per year died as a result of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms.</p>
      <blockquote>“New CDC data show that while the burden of antibiotic-resistance threats in the United States was greater than initially understood, deaths are decreasing since the 2013 report,” the release said. However, being that more antibiotic-resistant bacteria and fungi have been identified, the government health agency explained that “the number of people infected and who die is too high.”</blockquote>
      <p>Neither the 2013 nor the 2019 report includes viruses (such as HIV or influenza) or parasites.</p>
      <p>A total of 18 prominent antibiotic-resistant bacteria and fungi are divided into three threat categories - urgent, serious, and concerning - within the <a href="https://sputniknews.com/society/201911071077250057-cdc-report-finds-childhood-trauma-has-serious-impacts-on-adult-health/">CDC’s</a> latest data.</p>
      <blockquote>The “Urgent Threats” category is dominated (in terms of death toll) by two particular infections: Clostridioides difficile, which causes life-threatening diarrhea and was responsible for an estimated 12,800 deaths in 2017; and Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae or “nightmare bacteria,” from which at least 1,100 individuals died in 2017.</blockquote>
      <p>All infections included in the “Urgent Threats” portion of the report have been associated with or are a great concern for patients who have had recent care at a medical facility - aside from drug-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae, which is a form of gonorrhea that is sexually transmitted and “can result in life-threatening ectopic pregnancy and infertility, and can increase the risk of getting and giving HIV.”</p>
      <p>While the threat of antibiotic resistance was noted to “pose a catastrophic threat” within in the 2013 report and rapid detection and prevention strategies have been taken to increase awareness and lower the rate of infections, the <a href="https://sputniknews.com/society/201909071076742194-cdc-warns-against-e-cigarette-use-as-vaping-related-deaths-increase/">CDC</a> argued in its latest release that “more action” and “stronger focus and interventions” are necessary for the sake of public health.</p>
      <blockquote>In addition to identifying the top 18 antibiotic-resistant threats in its 2019 report, the <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201905311075495563-usa-cdc-measles-outbreak/">government health agency</a> also included a “Watch List” that includes two drug-resistant bacteria and one Azole-resistant fungus. The introduction of this precautionary list comes as CDC experts are admittedly alarmed at “the emergence and spread of new forms of resistance.”</blockquote>
      <p>While the CDC is designed to mainly focus on creating health solutions for the US, the agency has recommended a total of “five core actions” that it believes will not only be useful for Americans, but also communities worldwide, including infection prevention and control; tracking and data collection; antibiotic use and access; vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics; and environmental action and sanitation.</p>
