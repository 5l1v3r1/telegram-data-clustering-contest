      <p>Putin said it would be the “right” thing for Trump to attend a commemorative event in Moscow to mark the 75th anniversary of victory in World War Two, even as the U.S. president is campaigning for re-election.</p>
      <p>Putin presides over an annual parade on May 9 to commemorate the Soviet Union’s victory over Nazi Germany and uses the occasion to show off the country’s military hardware.</p>
      <p>Trump said last week he was considering attending the commemorative events after receiving an invitation from the Kremlin.</p>
      <p>Russia’s relations with the United States are at post-Cold War lows, but Trump and Putin have maintained the semblance of a good relationship.</p>
      <p>“Even in the framework of the election campaign it would be the right (thing). But it’s not up to us to decide,” Putin said, when asked about Trump’s possible attendance.</p>
