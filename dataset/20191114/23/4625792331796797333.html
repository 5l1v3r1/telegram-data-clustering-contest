      <p>Protesters donned red hooded cloaks and played Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony on a big screen outside of a black-tie dinner featuring Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.</p>
      <p>Kavanaugh was slated to speak Thursday night at the conservative Federalist Society’s annual convention at Union Station in Washington, D.C.</p>
      <p>Videos from outside the venue showed nearly a dozen people dressed as handmaids walking single file and a truck with a large screen showing Ford testifying during Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearings.</p>

      <p>Kavanaugh is likely to be received more warmly inside the event. He was given <a href="https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/417054-federalist-society-welcomes-kavanaugh-with-standing-ovation">a standing ovation</a> when he attended last year’s dinner in wake of the contentious confirmation hearings.</p>
