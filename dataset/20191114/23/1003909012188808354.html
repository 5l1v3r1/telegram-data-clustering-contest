        <b>The Calgary Municipal Land Corp. has named its new president and CEO.</b>

      <p>The Calgary Municipal Land Corp. has named its new president and CEO.</p>
      <p>Kate Thompson, who has served as the organization’s vice-president of development since 2013, will take the helm when current president and CEO Michael Brown exits in January to become president of Trico Homes.</p>
      <p>CMLC is the wholly owned subsidiary of the City of Calgary that has been responsible for implementing the city’s revitalization plan for the East Village and is now also working on the Rivers District Master Plan — a revitalization plan for the Victoria Park area that includes a <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/live-council-could-decide-fate-of-arena-deal-today">new $550-million arena</a> and the <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/federal-government-announces-166-million-for-expansion-of-bmo-centre">$500-million expansion of the BMO Centre</a>.</p>
      <p>In a news release, CMLC board chair Randy Magnussen said Thompson has played a leadership role in the success of many major infrastructure and development projects, most recently Calgary’s new Central Library.</p>
      <p>“Though there’s no good time to lose a leader of Michael’s quality, Kate’s outstanding leadership credentials give us full confidence that she will guide the organization through this complex period in our evolution,” Magnussen said.</p>
