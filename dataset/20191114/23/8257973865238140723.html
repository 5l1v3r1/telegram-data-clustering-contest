      <p>Nov. 14 (UPI) -- An elderly man hit in the head by a brick during Hong Kong's anti-government protests died Thursday, medical officials said.</p>
      <p>The 70-year-old man was <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/14/asia/hong-kong-protest-elderly-man-dies-intl-hnk/index.html">hit in the head</a> by the brick Wednesday as he worked in the road to gather bricks that had been thrown by demonstrators. Both anti- and pro-government groups threw the bricks at each other during the violence.</p>
      <p>He <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/society/article/3037622/hong-kong-protests-tear-gas-fired-city-begins-fourth">later died</a> at <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Prince/?tps=1">Prince</a> of Wales Hospital, becoming at least the second fatality associated with the months-long protests in the autonomous territory.</p>
      <p>The first was a 22-year-old demonstrator, Chow Tsz-Iok, who <a href="https://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2019/11/08/Hong-Kong-man-dies-from-injuries-during-protest/2401573251421/?upi_ss=kong">died Nov. 8</a> after he fell from the third story of a parking garage to the second floor. It's unclear what caused his fall, but police were firing tear gas in the parking garage at the time.</p>
      <p>Demonstrators began protesting in Hong Kong in June against a bill that would have allowed extraditions to China. Lawmakers in the autonomous region withdrew the bill from consideration, but protests continued over general anti-government sentiment and police use of force.</p>
      <p>Fresh demonstrations Thursday disrupted transportation in the city, and police fired tear gas and chemical canisters. At Chinese University, protesters barricaded the campus to prevent police from entering the campus.</p>
