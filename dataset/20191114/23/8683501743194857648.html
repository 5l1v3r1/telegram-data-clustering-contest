      <p>Among <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2465153/Adam-Driver-Admits-He-Knew-Where-Star-Wars-Episode-IX-Was-Going-From-The-Beginning">Adam Driver</a>’s deeply interesting career in independent projects such as <i>Frances Ha</i>, <i>Paterson</i> or <i>BlacKkKlansman</i>, his most iconic character is probably the biggest outlier. Because of this, you’d think he’d characterize his work in the new <i>Star Wars</i> trilogy as Kylo Ren as vastly different from anything he’s ever done. Yet, he’s found comparisons between his two upcoming movies: <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484740/star-wars-daisy-ridley-explains-why-the-rise-of-skywalker-was-her-favorite-to-film"><i>Rise of Skywalker</i></a> and Netflix drama <i>Marriage Story</i>. Here’s what Driver recently said:</p>
      <blockquote>In a way, Star Wars is a big blockbuster, which you would think would be maybe devoid of those conversations [about character]. But I haven’t found the process very dissimilar. You try to make <i>Star Wars</i> personal as much as anything else, and because J.J. [Abrams] was the director and because Rian Johnson was the director, it all came down to similar [things]… taking moments and breaking them into pieces and making sure you’re truthful.</blockquote>
      <p>As the Ben Solo actor tells it, what remains the most important part of his job on a movie set is discussing character, regardless of being on the massive $200 million budget blockbuster or a small indie passion project such as <i>Marriage Story</i>. Here are the differences per his recent Total Film Magazine (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/adam-driver-star-wars-marriage-story-interview/">Gamesradar</a>) interview:</p>
      <blockquote>The obvious difference is the rhythm of a set. A <i>Star Wars</i> set, there are 50 people all doing individual jobs, whether it be special effects or brushing a leaf or vacuuming something. There are just so many more moving pieces that finding your footing in the rhythm of that set… it’s just longer.</blockquote>
      <p>So, it’s just more crowded! There’s probably an awesome ship or <i>Star Wars</i> creatures around too! It’s refreshing to hear something like this from Adam Driver. He’s seasoned in smaller projects, but it’s nice to know his job isn’t compromised because there are more moving parts on the set of a big budget <i>Star Wars</i> movie. The actor namely attributed this to the directors behind the camera on the new trilogy: J.J. Abrams and Rian Johnson.</p>
      <p>Plot details for <i>Rise of Skywalker</i> are sparse, but Kylo Ren will reprise his role for the final installment of the Skywalker Saga. Fans will certainly be curious to see how the villian’s storyarc pans out – <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2482850/star-wars-the-rise-of-skywalker-is-teasing-kylo-rens-redemption-and-i-hate-it">perhaps with a redemption story</a>? And what about his <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2482501/daisy-ridley-confirms-the-rise-of-skywalker-will-address-the-reylo-relationship">peculiar relationship with Rey</a>?</p>

      <p>On the other side of things, Adam Driver has two buzzy performances for both <i>Marriage Story</i> and <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/previews/2480371/the-report"><i>The Report</i></a>. The first of which is a drama about his character Charlie and his wife Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) as they go through a divorce. CinemaBlend’s own Sean O’Connell rewarded the upcoming Netflix movie a <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/2484677/marriage-story-review-a-broken-relationship-but-two-of-the-years-best-performances">perfect 5 stars in his review</a>. <i>The Report</i> is a true story about the CIA’s secret torture program after 9/11. Driver plays Senate staffer Daniel Jones, who lead the investigation.</p>
      <p>There’s plenty of Adam Driver to go around! See <i>The Report</i> in select theaters on November 15 ahead of coming to Amazon Prime on November 29, <i>Marriage Story</i> on Netflix on December 6 and <i>Rise of Skywalker</i> on December 20.</p>
