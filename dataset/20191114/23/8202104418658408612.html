      <h3>More than 40 per cent of the thousands of calls received by the Saskatoon fire department so far this year have required some sort of emergency medical care.</h3>
      <p>That statistic is reflected in a change in the fire department’s focus to include a higher level of medical training for many of its responders.</p>
      <p>The fire department introduced emergency medical technicians in 1990, but now boasts more than 140 primary care paramedics among its 334 staff. That’s also just slightly more than 40 per cent.</p>
      <p>“Those are quite significant for us,” battalion chief Len Protz told reporters on Thursday at the fire hall on Idylwyld Drive.</p>
      <p>The fire department staged a demonstration for news media to show how a fire crew would respond to a skateboarder with a painful leg injury.</p>
      <p>Firefighter Marc Zimmer portrayed the injured skateboarder; Carter Tomyn, Steve Killick and Barret Husulak showed how a crew responds to such an incident.</p>
      <p>Specifically, the fire crew showed how Penthrox, a non-opioid painkiller that is inhaled, can be used to relieve pain in an instance like the injured skateboarder, whose leg had to be placed in a splint.</p>
      <p>Calls to the fire department have topped 14,000 so far this year; they reached that level in the entire calendar years of 2018 and 2017.</p>
      <p>Of this year’s calls, 5,821 were classified as emergency medical service calls. Medical calls topped 6,000 last year.</p>
      <p>Nearly two years ago, the fire department made the transition from emergency medical technicians to primary care paramedics. In January 2017, fire crews were trained to administer Naloxone, the drug used in opioid overdoses.</p>
      <p>Protz said fire staff respond to every call with a staff of four to five, including a paramedic. The fire department dispatches a full truck to every call, even if it’s to help assist a senior who has fallen.</p>
      <p>Many of the “hot zone” situations at which fire crews arrive, such as fires or vehicle crashes, can require medical care, Protz added.</p>
      <p>An agreement between the fire department and the Saskatchewan Health Authority determines which calls the fire department attends and which require an ambulance and a trip to hospital.</p>
      <p>“Anything that’s quite significant in nature, we would assist the ambulance,” Protz said.</p>
