      <p>NEW YORK CITY -- The MTA unveiled its final proposed 2020 budget and four-year financial plan Thursday, which includes laying off 2,700 people with administrative jobs and raising fares about 4% twice in the next four years.</p>
      <p>The agency faces staggering deficits even with the advent of congestion pricing, and riders are left scratching their heads.</p>
      <p>"It never ends, the cycle never ends," one straphanger said. "We never truly know where the money goes."</p>
      <p>Commuters have been promised spotless stations, gleaming new subway cars, and a state-of-the-art signal system to move trains faster with fewer delays, all of it paid for with $50 billion in revenue from congestion pricing.</p>
      <p>"And I have to say that significant deficits still remain," MTA Chief Financial Officer Robert Foran said.</p>
      <p>Foran said the new money is solely for modernizing the system, not for running it.</p>
      <p>"We're running the risk of having a system which is pristine, beautiful, new equipment in place and not having any operating money to maintain it," Transit Workers Union International President John Samuelsen said.</p>
      <p>The agency is proposing a "Transformation Plan," a series of proposals to help make up the difference. And it includes 4% increases in fares and tolls in 2021 and 2023 and the elimination of 2,700 jobs, mostly administrative positions, and mostly through attrition.</p>
      <p>They are changes implemented by Anthony McCord, the agency's new "transformation officer."</p>
      <p>"The transformation plan implementation is critical," Foran said. "Otherwise we're going to have unmanageable deficits in the future."</p>
      <p>Longtime MTA board member Andrew Albert said time will tell how it plays out.</p>
      <p>"There's unknowns in the picture, quite a few unknowns," he said. "And we'll just have to see how they turn out."</p>
      <p>Albert says he's optimistic, but he admits that all of the dominoes have to fall the right way -- which almost never happens at the MTA.</p>
      <p>Officials say the implementation of the Transformation Plan, the agency's first reorganization in half a century, is projected to deliver $1.6 billion in savings over the course of the financial plan -- including $253 million in higher fare revenue than previously projected due to increased ridership across the system.</p>
