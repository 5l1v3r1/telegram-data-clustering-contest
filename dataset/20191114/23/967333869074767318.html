        <b>LONDON (Sputnik) - A court in Edinburgh released ex-Catalan minister Clara Ponsati on bail hours after she handed herself in to police to have a European arrest warrant served on her, her lawyer said on Thursday.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The former top education official in Catalonia is wanted in Spain for her role <a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201911121077289138-catalan-parliament-adopts-draft-resolution-on-right-to-self-determination/">in the 2017 independence vote</a>. She has been living in exile in Scotland, where she teaches at the University of St. Andrews.</p>
      <blockquote>"Clara was … transferred to Edinburgh Sheriff Court for appearance at the Extradition Court before Sheriff Ross. After submissions from our legal team, Clara was released on bail", Aamer Anwar said.</blockquote>
      <p>The next hearing in her extradition case is scheduled for 12 December, the lawyer added. A date for the full hearing is likely to take place next spring.</p>
      <p>Anwar estimated that the 62-year-old faced a jail term of up to 15 years if handed over and convicted of sedition in Spain. The Supreme Court in Madrid <a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201910151077052264-over-130-protesters-injured-in-spain-after-court-imprisons-catalan-leaders/">gave nine other Catalan leaders sentences</a> ranging from nine to 13 years in prison in mid-October. Following the sentencing, thousands of people around the country took to streets in protest, with many of them getting injuries in clashes with police.</p>
      <p>Catalonia has been long striving to secede from Spain. On 1 October 2017, 90 percent of Catalans who took part in an independence referendum voted in support of secession. The Spanish government declared the vote illegal and arrested a number of pro-independence leaders, with former Catalan President Carles Puigdemon still being wanted by Madrid for his role in the independence bid.</p>
