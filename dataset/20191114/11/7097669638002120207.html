      <p>VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis on Thursday named the Vatican's new economy minister to succeed Cardinal George Pell, who is appealing a conviction in his native Australia for sexually assaulting two teenaged choir boys.</p>
      <p>The post, formally known as Prefect for the Secretariat of the Economy, has been vacant since Pell took leave of absence in 2017.</p>
      <p>The new head is Spanish Father Juan Antonio Guerrero, 60, a Jesuit like the pope.</p>
      <p>His appointment was announced a day after Australia's High Court agreed to hear a final appeal from Pell.</p>
      <p>Pell, who is serving a six-year jail sentence handed down by a lower court in March, turned to the High Court after a first appeal upheld his conviction.</p>
      <p>His absence had left one of the Vatican's most important economic departments without a leader.</p>
      <p>The Secretariat of the Economy, created by Pope Francis in 2014 to help oversee the implementation of financial reforms, coordinates the Vatican's economic and administrative affairs.</p>
      <p>The post of auditor-general has also been vacant since 2017, when Libero Milone resigned, saying he was forced to step down with trumped-up accusations after discovering evidence of possible illegal activity.</p>
      <p>The Vatican denies this and says he was spying on co-workers.</p>
