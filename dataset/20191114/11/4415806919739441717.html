      <h1>WATCH: 'I find it very hard to feel sorry for you': Piers Morgan challenges Michalla McCollum on her new book</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T11:46:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 11:46</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/digital-desk-staff/" target="_blank">By Digital Desk staff</a></address>
      <p>Perhaps the producers saw it coming when they asked Michaella McCollum, dubbed one of the 'Peru Two', to come on to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ji6UJKEvC8Q">ITV's Good Morning Britain</a> alongside Piers Morgan to promote her new book.</p>
      <p>Michaella has penned an autobiographical account of being caught smuggling £1.5 million worth of cocaine out of Peru back in 2013, and served three out of seven years in her sentence.</p>
      <p>She told GMB: 'When I agreed to it, I didn't know I was going to Peru, I didn't know how much drugs it was going to be, I just didn't really know. I wasn't told much about anything."</p>
      <p>At this point, Piers butts in: "Well, you were thinking, weren't you? You were thinking, I'm going to make €5,000 taking a load of illegal drugs out of the country. You knew that. And you knew it was against the law. You knew if you got caught, there'd be a heavy penalty. This idea that you weren't thinking, you were 20-years-old..."</p>
      <p>Michaela responded: "Well, I wasn't thinking correctly..."</p>
      <p>Piers: "Well you were thinking very correctly about lining your pocket with €5,000 to take a lot of cocaine out of the country. Even the most imbecilic person on earth knows that if you take a load of cocaine out of a country like Peru, it's a very bad thing to be doing."</p>
      <p>While Piers admitted that Michaella's experience in prison sounded awful, he said he found it very hard to feel sorry for her and that he find it very "problematic" that she is releasing a new book and "making money out of this whole experience".</p>
      <p>He said:</p>
      <blockquote>Why should anyone buy a book that's going to line your pocket, given that you took £1.5 million worth of cocaine out of the country illegally?</blockquote>
      <p>Michaella responded: "I'm writing the book to bring awareness, I don't think that I've gained from this. [I'm making] a small percentage. Authors make probably less than 10% of a sale..."</p>
      <p>Piers: "Why should you make any money?"</p>
      <p>Michaella:"I don't think I'm doing this for the money."</p>
      <p>Piers: "Why are you doing it then?"</p>
      <p>Michaella: "I want to bring awareness. I want to get my story out there."</p>
      <p>Piers: "Awareness of what, how to be completely stupid?"</p>
      <p>When asked what she would like to achieve with the book, Michaella insisted it wasn't about her, to which Piers challenged: "Well it is. The whole book is about you."</p>
      <p>The interview goes on for a solid ten minutes, before Piers advises her to give the money to charity. Watch the whole video below:</p>
