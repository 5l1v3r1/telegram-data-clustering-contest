      <h1>Premier League confirm dates and times for January transfer window</h1>
      <h2>The window will open on Wednesday 1 January and close at 23:00 (UK time) on Friday 31 January 2020</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T11:54:51+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 11:54</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Maltby, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matt-maltby/</a></address>
      <p>The Premier League has confirmed the dates and times for the January transfer window, when top-flight teams will be able to strengthen their ranks.</p>
      <p>The window will open on Wednesday 1 January and close at 23:00 (UK time) on Friday 31 January 2020.</p>
      <p>It has also been confirmed that top-flight clubs will be given an extension to finalise their 25-man squad for the second half of the campaign.</p>
      <p>Normally clubs need to register their final squad for the rest of the campaign the day after the transfer window closes, but because Deadline Day is the day before a round of fixtures, the deadline for submission of final squad lists will be on Wednesday 5 February 2020.</p>

      <p>The Premier League said: "New players signed on 1-2 January will not be eligible for Matchweek 21, but they can be made available for the following Matchweeks as clubs are permitted to make changes to their squad lists throughout the January window.</p>
      <p>"Clubs completing deals late on Deadline Day, 31 January, will be able to submit a Deal Sheet between 21:00-23:00 GMT.</p>
      <p>"Clubs will have until midnight on Deadline Day to complete the information needed by FIFA's Transfer Matching System to apply for international clearance for new signings."</p>
      <p>With almost a third of the season completed, the Premier League is starting to take shape.</p>

      <p>And it is <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> who are on track for a title triumph, with manager Jurgen Klopp enjoying a stunning start to the season.</p>
      <p>The Liverpool manager is the man with the Midas touch at the moment.</p>
      <p>Revered on Merseyside by the Reds faithful, Klopp's stock rose further still with last Sunday's 3-1 win over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> at Anfield, opening up an eight-point gap over nearest challengers <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a>, and a nine-point cushion to Pep Guardiola's side.</p>
      <p>The 52-year-old German has so far masterminded a near-perfect league campaign, with 11 wins and a draw from 12 matches.</p>
      <p>Under Klopp, this could well be the year Liverpool finally end their 30-year wait to land the league title.</p>
