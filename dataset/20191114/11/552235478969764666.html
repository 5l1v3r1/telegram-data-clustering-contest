      <p>Threave Rovers kept up their pursuit of Abbey Vale with a 2-0 win over Mid Annandale on Saturday.</p>
      <p>With Vale hammering Caledonian Braves on Friday night, Threave knew they had to deliver at Meadow Park the following day and took the lead with a spectacular Scott Milligan free-kick.</p>
      <p>The second was also a stunning strike, Andrew Donley finding the net from about 30 yards.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The Castle Douglas side had chances to extend their lead before the break, Dan Thom and Jack McMurdo going close.</p>
      <p>The same pair as well as Milligan also had opportunities in the second half but Threave had to be content with just two goals.</p>

      <p>The win moved them back level with Vale at the top of the league, the Maryfield Park side having a better goal difference but having played a game more.</p>
      <p>Tomorrow night sees Threave go to Newton Stewart in the league.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>And they will be returning to Blairmount Park at some point in the new year to replay the South of Scotland League Cup final.</p>
      <p>The game against Stranraer was abandoned earlier this month when the floodlights went out with Stranraer 3-2 ahead.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/dumfries-galloway">The South of Scotland Football League executive committee decided the match will be replayed with free admission for all spectators.</a>
