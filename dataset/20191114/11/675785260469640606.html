      <h1>Fake world of mummy bloggers exposed - after Mother Of Daughters caught in web of lies</h1>
      <h2>Instagram influencer Mother Of Daughters - real name Clemmie Hooper - was caught writing disgusting comments about her fellow mummy bloggers under a fake name</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T11:35:41+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 11:35</time> by <a rel="author">Emmeline Saunders</a></address>
      <p>In the wake of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/mother-daughters-blogger-clemmie-hooper-20838768">the Mother Of Daughters scandal</a> , the lid has been lifted on the fake world of mummy bloggers.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> influencer - real name Clemmie Hooper - was exposed earlier this month as being behind a fake profile that had been viciously trolling other bloggers, some of who Clemmie was friends with in real life.</p>
      <p>The part-time midwife, who found online fame through her Gas And Air blog before opening up her life on Instagram, admitted she had joined the gossip site Tattle Life and was the one posting vile comments about other people in the blogosphere.</p>
      <p>Clemmie had even dubbed her own husband, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/father-daughters-blogger-simon-hooper-20862331">Father Of Daughters blogger Simon Hooper</a> , a "class A t**t" in a bid to throw other site users off the scent as the net began drawing in.</p>

      <p>She was caught out when her alter-ego, AliceInWanderlust, began posting from St Lucia - at the same time Clemmie was sharing lavish pictures of her holiday in the same place on her public Instagram.</p>
      <p>Clemmie issued a grovelling apology after speaking to some of the influencers she'd been slating in private, begging them not to unmask her as the cruel troll who had been targeting them for eight months.</p>
      <p>"Earlier this year, I became aware of a website that had thousands of comments about my family and I," Clemmie said in a statement.</p>
      <p>"Reading them made me feel extremely paranoid and affected me much more than I knew at the time.</p>
      <p>"I decided without telling anyone else that I would make an anonymous account so that this group of people would believe I was one of them, so that I could maybe change their opinions from the inside to defend my family and I."</p>
      <p>She went on: "It became all consuming and it grew bigger than I knew how to handle. When the users started to suspect it was me I made the mistake of commenting about others.</p>
      <p>"I regret it all and am deeply sorry – I know this has caused a lot of pain.</p>

      <p>"Undoubtedly I got lost in this online world and the more I became engrossed in the negative commentary, the more the situation escalated."</p>
      <p>Husband Simon refused to defend the mother of his four children when he broke his silence several days later, admitting he was a hurt and angry by her actions.</p>
      <p>"In all honesty, I'm feeling both angry &amp; a bit sad. I can't condone or fully understand why Clemmie did what she did. Make no mistake about it - she made some bad choices - I just wish she could have spoken to me about this before it all got too much," he said in his own separate statement.</p>
      <p>"Actually, If we're wishing for things, I wish it had never happened in the first place. I’ve seen first hand what 3 years of being attacked online can do to a person and the dark places it can drive you to – I guess whereas I can happily ignore it all, she couldn't &amp; ended up getting lost.</p>
      <p>"To be clear, I'm not here to defend my wife's actions or provide excuses because I have none. What I do know is that online actions have real world consequences - this has impacted our family &amp; it will take some time to recover."</p>
      <p>But the scandal has damaged Clemmie's fans' trust - and will have a wider impact on how so-called mumfluencers' content is consumed.</p>

      <p>One thing Clemmie's lies has done is blown open the assumption all the mummy bloggers are good friends behind the scenes.</p>
      <p>A source told the Sun: "There is a lot of rivalry and people will support each other online just to get ahead. They will like each other's posts and comment on them so they get more prominence, but they're not really friends.</p>
      <p>"In public, they're all like, 'Oh babe', and behind their back they'll be calling them a bitch."</p>
      <p>Not only do parenting influencers have to watch their backs from their own friends, they also face a tide of scrutiny with every post they publish.</p>
      <p>From Photoshopping allegations to freebie holidays and lucrative sponsored content that sucks the life out of spontaneity - because every family outing must be mined for the perfect Instagram shot - mummy bloggers have to carefully balance business with pleasure.</p>
      <p>And with mental health becoming a hot topic in recent years, protecting themselves against trolling and online abuse has become more important than ever.</p>
      <p>A petition to shut down Tattle Life - the site where Clemmie's lies were published - has been launched, attracting more than 25,000 signatures, after beauty journalist and influencer Sali Hughes issued an emotional video calling for the vicious comments to stop.</p>
      <p>"I've been targeted on there myself with cruel jibes," said blogger Vicki Psarias, aka Honest Mum.</p>
      <p>"It seems to have become a site that allows people to hurt other people, venting their own issues and prejudices on to others. There’s a dark side to mummy blogging."</p>
