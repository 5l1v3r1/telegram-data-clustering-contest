      <p>Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh got married by South Indian customs on November 14 last year, following which they got married by Sindhi customs on November 15. So this year to celebrate their first wedding anniversary the couple planned a trip with their families to seek blessing in Tirupati on November 14 and in Amritsar on November 15.</p>

      <p>Just few minutes back, Deepika took to Instagram to post a picture with Ranveer from Tirupati and wrote, “As we celebrate our first wedding anniversary, we seek the blessings of Lord Venkateshvara. Thank you all for your love, prayers and good wishes. @ranveersingh”. One can see Ranveer and Deepika clad in heavy ethnic attire as they posed for a picture after seeking blessings in the temple. This happy picture surely makes us feel that they are truly made for each other. By planning to visit Tirupati and Amritsar back to back just to appreciate both their beliefs, the couple has surely shown that love trumps all.</p>
