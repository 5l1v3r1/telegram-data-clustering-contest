      <h1>Woman eats 5.5lb, 3ft hot dog with 5,000 calories in 25 minutes</h1>
      <h2>Kate says it was her longest food challenge to date</h2>

      <p>A top food blogger has taken on her lengthiest challenge to date - Britain's biggest hotdog, measuring a whopping three feet long.</p>
      <p>Social media star Kate Ovens demolished the oversized hotdog - which was topped with cheese and five types of bacon - in only 25 minutes, despite it needing two men to carry to her table.</p>
      <p>The blogger, famed for taking on and conquering giant food challenges, thought she had bitten off more than she could chew with the estimated 5,000-calorie feast - enough to feed a family-of-four.</p>
      <p>The specially-made pork, beef and bacon bockwurst was slathered in bacon jam and bacon mayonnaise, and topped with smoked pancetta lardons - with crushed Frazzle bacon-flavoured crisps sprinkled on top.</p>

      <p>But the 25-year-old managed to devour the Â£45 treat, dubbed the 'BFD', at Oh My Dog at their restaurant in Four Pure Brewery, in Bermondsey, south east London.</p>
      <p>Kate, who has more than 400,000 web followers and subscribers, regularly gets millions of views for her Kate Ovens Facebook videos.</p>
      <p>She said: "This was certainly one of my longest challenges.</p>

      <p>"Last year I ate a three-feet-long sausage roll, but the BFD was far thicker.</p>
      <p>"Normally when I get half way though, I get nervous about whether or not I'll finish.</p>

      <p>"But the BFD was so delicious, I knew I could keep on going' ."</p>
      <p>In order to accommodate the giant sausage, staff at Oh My Dog needed to make new utensils to steam the giant dog.</p>

      <p>Founder and head chef Joel Bowen created the challenge specifically for Kate, but is hoping to add it to his menus in the coming months.</p>
      <p>He said: "It was pretty fun, even though we had a few hurdles along the way.</p>
      <p>"We had to custom make a basting lid by welding together some baking trays - but they were so thin they kept catching fire when we were welding them.</p>

      <p>"For years I've wanted to make the ultimate hotdog, and I think we achieved that.</p>
      <p>"I've seen a few of Kate's videos, so I knew she would give it a good go, but I had my doubts."</p>
      <p>Joel reckons the sausage alone weighed about 3lbs, and the entire feast tipped the scales at an eye-watering 5-and-a-half lbs.</p>

      <p>It is thought to be the largest hotdog in the country regularly available to customers.</p>
      <p>Kate added: "It was absolutely delicious. Hotdogs are one of my favourite foods, if they're done right, and this one was brilliant.</p>
      <p>"There was lots of bacon in every bite, and everybody knows that every meal is better with bacon.</p>
      <p>"It was one of my longest challenges by far, but to be fair, I think it's pretty cool.</p>
      <p>"I have been wanting to do this challenge for ages.</p>

      <p>"I had never seen one so big, and afterwards I was completely stuffed.</p>
      <p>"It was pretty messy too - I ended up with sauce all over myself."</p>
      <p>University of Newcastle graduate Kate has more than 170,000 subscribers on her 'Kate Ovens' Facebook page and her eating challenges videos regularly rack-up millions of views.</p>
