      <p>Directed by Raj Mehta, this Dharma Productions’ venture promises to be an entertainer and today on Children’s Day the makers released the posters of the film. The film is about two couples who struggle with conceiving a child and when they finally do, the biggest goof-up of the year takes place or so the posters suggest. Well, we are super kicked  after seeing these, what about you?</p>
