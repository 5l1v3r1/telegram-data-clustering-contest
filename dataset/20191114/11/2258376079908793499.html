      <p>SASKATOON -- RCMP captured the second escapee from the Regional Psychiatric Centre (RPC) Thursday afternoon at the Sunset Estates east of Saskatoon.</p>
      <p>29-year-old Kendal Lee Campeau and 24-year-old Matthew Shaundel Michel escaped from the facility Wednesday around 8:40 p.m.</p>
      <p>Campeau was arrested early Thursday morning without incident at a home in the 500 block of Douglas Crescent.</p>
      <p>Michel travelled in a stolen vehicle from the Warman area to the Humboldt area, RCMP said in a news release.</p>

      <p>Police attempted to stop the vehicle near Humboldt, but the vehicle fled on Highway 5 toward Saskatoon, RCMP said. The vehicle ran out of gas near Sunset Estates.</p>
      <p>Michel walked into the residential area and officers from the Saskatoon and Humboldt RCMP detachments, Saskatoon Traffic Services, and Saskatoon RCMP Police Dog Services found Michel on the roof of one of the residences, RCMP said.</p>
      <p>Michel was threatening self-harm if approached and gave himself up to officers after a short verbal negotiation, RCMP said. Michel was arrested and taken into custody.</p>
      <p>Over 55,000 Saskatoon residents received an emergency alert Wednesday night notifying the public of the situation, according to the City of Saskatoon. It was the first time a city-wide notification has been sent through the system since it was introduced in 2014.</p>
      <p>“I think it upset us at all because it became a reality that someone did escape,” said Lynn Kotyk, a woman who lives in the neighbourhood across the street from RPC.</p>
      <p>“I thought twice about going out. I changed my walking route a little bit, so I stayed residential, but is it going to change my lifestyle, probably not,” she said.</p>
      <p>Larry Ayers said while news of an escaped inmate is concerning, he wishes there would have been more transparency in the alert regarding why the men were in custody.</p>
      <p>“If they were in there for nothing violent, then it won’t concern me very much,” he said.</p>
      <p>“If they were a serial murder I’d be concerned."</p>
      <p>It's premature to comment on the circumstances surrounding the escapes until an investigation is completed, Correctional Service Canada Isabelle Robitaille said in an email to CTV News.</p>
      <p>"Due to the vigilance of correctional staff the Saskatoon Police were notified immediately. We continue to work closely with the Saskatoon Police on this matter. Ensuring the safety and security of institutions, staff, and the public remains the highest priority in the operations of the federal correctional system."</p>
      <p>According to Robitaille, Michel is serving a six-year, eight-month, 19-day sentence for charges including assault of a peace officer, assault with a weapon, robbery, and dangerous operation of a motor vehicle.</p>
      <p>Campeau is serving a sentence of six years and eight months for possession of a substance for trafficking, assault use of force, robbery, theft, disguise with intent, and mischief in relation to other property.</p>
