      <h1>Jack Leach signs Somerset contract extension</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T11:19:46+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 11:19</time> by <a rel="author">ESPNcricinfo staff</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/england/content/player/455524.html">Jack Leach</a>, the England left-arm spinner, has signed a two-year contract extension with Somerset that will keep him at the club until the end of the 2022 season.</p>
      <p>Leach, who was born and raised in Taunton, has been part of the club's system since his childhood, and has been a first-team regular since the 2016 season, when his 65 wickets at 21.87 apiece nearly fired Somerset to a first Championship title.</p>
      <p>He was perhaps unfortunate to miss out on a red-ball central contract with England - he has been given an incremental contract instead - and is currently in New Zealand, preparing to play in the first Test at Mount Maunganui on November 21.</p>
      <p>"I'm very happy to sign this new contract," Leach said. "I'm a Somerset fan at heart so I'm very proud to represent the county. I have a great relationship with the members and fans, and I can't thank them enough for the support they give the team and me as an individual.</p>
      <p>"I'd also like to thank Jason Kerr [head coach] and Andy Hurry [director of cricket] for the belief they have shown in me. I'm looking forward to the winter and can't wait for next season."</p>
      <p>Hurry said: "Everyone at the club is delighted that Jack has committed his future to Somerset. He is an exceptional talent and a big influence in the dressing room. I can't speak highly enough of him both as a player and as a man.</p>
      <p>"He has a genuine passion for the game and in particular for Somerset. That shows itself every time he trains, in his diligent preparation and in his wholehearted performances every time he takes to the field. We feel that he has a major role to play for both Somerset and England over the forthcoming years."</p>
      <p>Leach's extension is something of a blow to <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/england/content/player/646847.html">Dom Bess</a>, the offspinner who played two Tests for England in May 2018 but found himself in the Somerset 2nd XI later that summer.</p>
      <p>Bess - who twice went on loan to Yorkshire last summer - is contracted until the end of next season, and is unlikely to change clubs this winter despite Yorkshire coach Andrew Gale publicly registering his interest in making that move permanent. But having played only nine times for Somerset in all formats last year - seven in the Championship and twice in the One-Day Cup - another frustrating season may leave Bess with no choice but to look elsewhere given he retains ambitions of a long international career.</p>
