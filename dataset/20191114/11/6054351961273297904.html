      <h1>Eminem To Commemorate 'The Slim Shady LP' With SSLP20 Merch Capsule</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T11:00:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 11:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://hiphopdx.com/author/Kyle%20Eustice" target="_blank">Kyle Eustice</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.53451/title.tech-n9ne-challenges-eminem-haters-to-defend-their-culture-vulture-claim">Eminem</a> has announced Drop 2 of the SSLP20 merch capsule to commemorate the 20th anniversary of <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.50387/title.eminem-reissues-the-slim-shady-lp-with-bonus-tracks"><i>The Slim Shady</i> LP.</a></p>
      <p>On Thursday (November 14), the project’s mastermind sent out a tweet alongside a video clip that includes Lego versions of Em and his longtime business partner Paul Rosenberg.</p>
      <p>Just like the skit on the album, as “Guilty Conscience” plays in the background, Rosenberg calls up Slim Shady. Simply put, Rosenberg isn’t happy with some of the lyrics. But, in typical Eminem fashion, he disregards Rosenberg’s advice.</p>
      <p>“There’s only so much I can explain,” the tweet reads. “#StillDontGiveAFuck #SSLP20 Drop 2 Coming 11/19 – Paul not included. Sign up for first access.”</p>

      <p>According to <a href="https://shop.eminem.com/pages/sslp20-preview">Eminem’s official website,</a> the bundles include vinyl, cassettes and other collectible items exclusive to the site. As he mentioned, a limited quantity will be available beginning on November 19.</p>
      <p><i>The Slim Shady</i> LP was released in 1999 and spawned singles such as “My Name Is,” “Just Don’t Give A Fuck” and the aforementioned “Guilty Conscience” featuring Dr. Dre.</p>
      <p>It’s one of Em’s only albums to debut at No. 2 on the Billboard 200, selling roughly 283,000 copies in its first week.</p>
