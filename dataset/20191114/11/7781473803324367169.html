      <p>Honda two-wheelers India has made its BSVI portfolio stronger by launching the SP 125 commuter motorcycle in India. The SP 125 has been launched in two variants - Drum brake-equipped and an optional disc brake-equipped variant. The former is priced at Rs 72,900 while the latter sees a sticker price of Rs 77,100 - both the prices are ex-showroom Delhi. The SP 125 is dearer by almost Rs 9,000 over the <a href="http://overdrive.in/bikes/honda/cb-shine-m138/">Honda CB Shine</a> SP 125 that it succeeds.</p>
