      <h1>Beck Drops Futuristic New Single “Everlasting Nothing”</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T11:48:26+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 11:48</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.spin.com/author/willgottsegen/" target="_blank">Will Gottsegen</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.spin.com/tag/beck/">Beck</a> has released a new song, “Everlasting Nothing,” from his upcoming album <a href="https://www.spin.com/2019/04/beck-hyperspace-saw-lightning/"><i>Hyperspace</i></a>. It’s the fifth single from the project, following “<a href="https://www.spin.com/2019/04/beck-hyperspace-saw-lightning/">Saw Lightning</a>,” “<a href="https://www.spin.com/2019/10/beck-hyperlife-uneventful-days/">Hyperlife</a>,” “<a href="https://www.spin.com/2019/10/beck-hyperlife-uneventful-days/">Uneventful Days</a>,” and “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW17lc9wMd4">Dark Places</a>,” all of which were written in collaboration with <a href="https://www.spin.com/tag/pharrell">Pharrell</a>. “Everlasting Nothing” is in keeping with the slick, spacious feel of those previous tracks, but ups the ante with backing vocals from a nine-person choir.</p>
      <p>In a recent interview with NME, Beck provided some insight into how the album came together: “There’d been a period of time where Pharrell had been really busy and an opportunity opened up so I went with it. Originally it was going to be a single or an EP, but I think we were both surprised when there was a body of work here.”</p>
      <p><i>Hyperspace</i> marks the 14th full-length studio album from Beck, and the first since 2017’s <i><a href="https://www.spin.com/2017/10/beck-colors-review/">Colors</a></i>, which <a href="https://www.spin.com/2019/02/grammys-2019-winners-list/">earned three Grammy nominations and won two of the awards</a>. Beck has been promoting the new album with a <a href="https://www.spin.com/2019/11/beck-paisley-park-sessions-prince/">surprise EP, <i>Paisley Park Sessions</i></a>, recorded at Prince’s studio in Minnesota. The project includes new versions of “Where It’s At” and “Up All Night,” as well as a medley of Prince tracks called “The Paisley Experience,” featuring “Raspberry Beret,” “When Doves Cry,” “Kiss,” and “1999.” The three tracks on <i>Paisley Park Sessions</i> are getting their own music videos on November 18.</p>
      <p><i>Hyperspace</i> will be available November 22.</p>
