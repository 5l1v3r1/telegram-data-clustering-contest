      <p>Instagram is making Like counts private for some users everywhere. From a report:<i> Instagram tells TechCrunch the hidden Likes test is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/14/instagram-private-like-counts/">expanding to a subset of users globally</a>. Users will have to decide for themselves if something is worth Liking rather than judging by the herd. The change could make users more comfortable sharing what's important to them without the fear of people seeing them receive an embarrassingly small number of likes. Instagram began hiding Likes in April in Canada and then brought the test to Ireland, Italy, Japan, Brazil, Australia and New Zealand in July. Facebook started a similar experiment in Australia in September. Instagram said last week the test would expand to the US, but now it's running everywhere to a small percentage of users in each country.</i></p>
