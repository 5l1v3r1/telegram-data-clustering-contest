      <p>An abandoned puppy has become a viral sensation after pictures of it were posted online - with what appears to be a tail growing from the middle of its forehead.</p>
      <p>Rescue organisation Mac's Mission found the pup along with another older dog and took them both into their care.</p>
      <p>Staff named the unusual but adorable canine 'Narwhal the Little Magical Furry Unicorn' and uploaded on a series of pictures and videos gaining him a legion of adoring fans.</p>
      <p>The centre, based in Missouri, US, 'specialises in special' and aims to help dogs which have been injured, abused or born with birth defects who wouldn't survive without some extra tender, loving care.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/weird-news/abandoned-unicorn-puppy-tail-head-20873412">The Mirror report</a> how the puppy was treated by a vets to try and discover why the tail is there, if it was connected to anything, and most importantly, if it wags when little Narwhal gets excited.</p>

      <p>"One of our followers said 'it appears they assembled the puppy wrong. Always follow the directions people!'</p>
      <p>"This is a true experience of having 'extra parts' during assembly.</p>
      <p>"Dr. Heuring said there is no real reason at this time for the unicorn tail to be removed (and we all wish it wagged).</p>

      <p>"Pretty sure the staff at Cape Small also gushed all over this little nugget!</p>
      <p>"The unicorn face tail does not bother Narwhal and he never slows down just like any normal puppy."</p>

      <p>The pup isn't quite ready for adoption as staff want to monitor the tail and ensure it doesn't become a problem, but it is expected there will be no shortage of takers when it comes to finding him his forever home.</p>
      <p>One online fan said: "Honestly the tail just makes him even cuter! And what great news that it's not causing any trouble up there!"</p>
