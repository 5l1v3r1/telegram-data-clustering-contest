      <h1>Cafe closure blamed on parking enforcement causing downturn in trade</h1>
      <h2>Customers refused to return after being fined £60</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T11:15:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 11:15</time> by <a rel="author">Lynette Pinchess</a></address>
      <p>A cafe at a picturesque marina is closing its doors from today (November 14) blaming a drop-off in trade after customers were stung with £60 parking fines.</p>
      <p>The owners said it was "with a heavy heart" but they have been struggling for months since the new parking enforcement system was introduced at Sawley Marina near Long Eaton - the UK's biggest inland marina.</p>
      <p>The Marina Cafe provided a welcome break for walkers, cyclists and families as well as boating people, serving hearty breakfasts, burgers, fish and chips and pizzas.</p>
      <p>British Waterways Marinas Limited, which has its head office at the<a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/whats-on/food-drink/food-sleuth-finds-tapas-restaurant-3204171"> Sawley</a> site, introduced a new system in April, with three hours free parking. Visitors, who failed to see signs and stayed for longer without paying in the office, were fined.</p>
      <p>The cafe owners had already reduced its hours for the winter period, opening Thursday to Sunday, when making the decision to close.</p>
      <p>Scores of customers said they were "gutted" by the news, which was announced in a Facebook post, saying: "It's time to say goodbye.</p>
      <p>"It is with a heavy heart that we have taken the difficult decision to close our doors from Thursday 14th November 2019.</p>
      <p>"In April 2019, our landlord BWML installed a Parking Enforcement System. Since this was introduced we have seen a massive downturn in trade, so much so that it is no longer viable to stay open."</p>
      <p>One dissatisfied customer left a 'terrible' Facebook review in September after being stung with a £60 parking fine.</p>
      <p>They complained: "DO NOT VISIT!!! Unless you want a £60 parking ticket.</p>
      <p>"I have been to the cafe on numerous occasions for breakfast at the weekend. One Sunday we decided to have a coffee after breakfast and enjoy the sun outside. However, apparently if you stay too long, and spend more money at the marina, you are slammed with a parking fine of £60.</p>
      <p>"Appalling way to treat paying customers, who are spending more money in the marina. Not worth the hassle, do not visit this place!!"</p>
      <p>Another customer Tony Cella complained on Facebook: "I certainly will never set foot, sail or use any of the services of any BWML marina again.</p>
      <p>"Ten of us travelled up for breakfast last month. I didn't see the new signage about the car parking. Lovely breakfast and walk round the marina... end result 3hrs 13min and £60 parking charge in the post. "</p>
      <p>More than 140 fans mourned the loss of the cafe.</p>

      <p>Shaz Zenith responded: "No way?! You are such an integral part of why it's so lovely at the Marina!! I hope the landlord sees a downturn in profits from people not going there and needing to use the parking. Pure selfishness and such a loss."</p>
      <p>Jane Russell posted: "Oh no, this is bad, what a greedy landlord. We loved going there for Sunday lunch and a little walk with the grandchildren. So sorry for the staff."</p>
      <p>Becky Henry said it was the best<a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/whats-on/food-drink/rb-brunch-coming-nottingham-bottomless-3524660"> breakfast</a> around. "Omg this is awful! I'm absolutely gutted. You will be so missed. Excellent service, every single time. I hope you find somewhere else to open as your customers will follow. Good luck."</p>
      <p>Fay Rumley said she had never tipped anyone as highly as at the Marina Cafe, adding: "The staff are exceptionally hard working. I am so sorry this has happened to you all, it is not a reflection on your work ethic or dedication."</p>
