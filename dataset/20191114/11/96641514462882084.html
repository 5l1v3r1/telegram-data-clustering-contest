      <p>Tomorrow marks the eighteenth anniversary of the original Xbox, the first console from Microsoft that kicked off a rivalry with PlayStation that still burns today. Stockier and arguably more stylish than the first PlayStation, the first generation Xbox featured a 733MHz Intel Pentium III processor and a built-in hard disk. The initial sales of the Xbox broke records, with 1.5 million units sold before the end of the year and a total of 24 million units moved over its four-year lifespan.</p>
      <p>While we didn't review the Xbox (its launch predated Engadget by three years), over 40 readers have shared memories and reviews of it on our<a href="https://www.engadget.com/products/Microsoft/xbox/1st-gen/"> Xbox product page</a>.
