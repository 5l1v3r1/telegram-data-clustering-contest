      <p>ISLAMABAD (Dunya News) – Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazal (JUI-F) is going to implement its Plan B of Azadi March, led by party president Maulana Fazal-ur-Rehman, from today by blocking all major roads across the country, Dunya News reported on Thursday.</p>
      <p>According to details, JUI-F has finalized preparations to shut Peshawar road, Grand Trunk Road (GT Road) in Rawalpindi, Quetta-Karachi highway, Indus Highway and Sukkur-Multan Motorway.</p>
      <p>Earlier on Wednesday, JUI-F had announced to implement its Plan B in a bid to put more pressure on the government for Prime Minister Imran Khan’s resignation by closing all major highways of Pakistan.</p>
      <p>Azadi March participants dismantled their tents and left the H-9 venue in Islamabad after packing up their belongings.</p>
      <p>JUI-F leader Maulana Atta Ur Rehman addressed the protesters and said we have staged sit-in protest on the Quetta-Chaman highway and we will block Chakdara Chowk in Lower Dir and Indus Highway according to our plan. Shahrah-e-Resham in KPK has been blocked by the Azadi Marchers, he claimed.</p>
      <p>We will block Indus Highway at the Link Road, he said while adding that workers of the JUI-F will start implementation on Plan B from Thursday at 02:00 PM.</p>
      <p>JUI-F leader Rashid Soomro also spoke to the Azadi March protesters and urged them to gather at Hub River Road on Thursday at 02:00 PM. Workers should not carry sticks to the sit-in protests and ambulances must be allowed to pass through, he said.</p>
