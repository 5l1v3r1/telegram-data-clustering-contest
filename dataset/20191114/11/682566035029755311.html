      <p>Karachi - Test cricket will return to <b>Pakistan</b> after a long gap of 10 years after Sri Lanka agreed to a tour for two matches next month, the Pakistan Cricket Board announced on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The vote of confidence from Sri Lanka is hugely symbolic, as it was the attack on their team bus during a visit to Lahore in 2009 which drove international cricket away from Pakistan as the country grappled with militancy.</p>
      <p>Six policemen and two civilians were killed while seven Sri Lankan players were injured in the attack.</p>
      <p>For years afterwards, Pakistan hosted all its "home" games in the United Arab Emirates as foreign teams refused to visit the cricket-mad country for security fears.</p>
      <p>But Pakistan has seen a dramatic improvement in security in recent years, and international cricket has begun to creep back.</p>
      <p>Minnows Zimbabwe became the first team to return Pakistan in 2015 for one-days and Twenty20s, followed by a Twenty20 series by a World XI in 2017, a one-off T20 match against Sri Lanka later that year, and a visit by the West Indies in 2018.</p>
      <p>Sri Lanka also completed three one-day internationals and as many Twenty20s in Karachi and Lahore last month.</p>
      <p>But the announcement of a Test series, still the most highly regarded cricket format, is an important step - especially when it involves Sri Lanka.</p>
      <p>"The Test series schedule was confirmed today after Cricket Sri Lanka gave their thumbs-up... following a highly successful visit last month," said a Pakistan Cricket Board statement Thursday.</p>
      <p>The first Test will be played in Rawalpindi from December 11-15, while the second Test will be held in Karachi from December 19-23.</p>
      <p>"Sri Lanka's one-day and T20 tour not only delivered security from the top draw, but packed houses sent out a loud and clear message about the security situation in the country as well as passion for the game," the PCB said.</p>
      <p>"This is fabulous news for Pakistan and its reputation of being as safe and secure as any other country in the world," added PCB director of international cricket Zakir Khan.</p>
      <p>The PCB statement quoted Cricket Sri Lanka's chief executive Ashley de Silva as saying they were "pleased" to confirm the tour.</p>
      <p>"We are comfortable and convinced conditions are suitable and conducive for Test cricket," he was quoted as saying.</p>
      <p>The two Tests will be part of the World Test Championship, which is being played between the top nine teams of the world, culminating in a final in June 2021.</p>
