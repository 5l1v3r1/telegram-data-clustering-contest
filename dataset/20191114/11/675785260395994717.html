      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/black-friday">Black Friday</a> is fast approaching on November 29th, but many retailers have been kicking off their sales ahead of the shopping event.</p>
      <p>Now health and beauty retailer <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/superdrug">Superdrug</a> has joined in by launching its early <a href="https://fave.co/34SHRdg">Black Friday sale</a> for 2019, with discounts on everything from beauty electricals to Christmas gift sets.</p>
      <p>The early deals are available in store and online at <a href="https://fave.co/34SHRdg">superdrug.com</a> until Tuesday December 3rd.</p>
      <p>What's more, Health &amp; Beautycard members can get an exclusive discount on top of sale items until Tuesday November 26th.</p>
