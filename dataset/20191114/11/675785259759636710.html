      <h1>General election: Actor Eddie Marsan brands Lib Dems 'political enema' as he attacks Labour</h1>
      <h2>The film star drew laughter with his comment about why he voted Lib Dem - but his message about anti-Semitism cases was deadly serious</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T11:53:09+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 11:53</time> by <a rel="author">Nicola Bartlett, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/nicola-bartlett/</a></address>
      <p>Film star Eddie Marsan today joined the Lib Dems on the campaign trail - claiming voting for them is like having an enema.</p>
      <p>The Gangs of New York actor prompted laughter at an event in London as he described voting Liberal Democrat as a “political enema” telling the audience “it feels good”.</p>
      <p>But there was a serious side to his intervention too - as he gave a moving speech about fighting racism.</p>
      <p>He spoke about how he had voted <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> since Neil Kinnock made his iconic speech at the Labour Party conference in 1985 about kicking out militant.</p>
      <p>Marsan, who grew up in a working class community in Tower Hamlets, said he was not able to “hold my nose” and vote for Labour with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jeremy-corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a> in charge because of his record on anti-Semitism.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>He said of the Labour leader who criticised the removal of an anti-Semitic mural in 2012 - “you are either antisemitic or you are ignorant”.</p>
      <p>He said: “Either way that should disqualify you from being the leader of the Labour Party and the Prime Minister.”</p>
      <p>At the time the mural emerged, Jeremy Corbyn <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/jeremy-corbyn-apologises-pain-caused-12250965">said he was "sincerely sorry"</a> for the pain caused by "pockets" of anti-Semitism in Labour.</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn added his 2012 comment on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> was about free speech, he had not looked at the mural properly, and that on second glance it was clearly anti-Semitic and it was right to remove it.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Labour officials have since insisted the dealing of anti-Semitism cases - which make up less than 0.1% of Labour members - has been sped up and improved.</p>
      <p>The actor, who left school at 15, described how he had often listened to far more educated people spouting anti-Semitism describing it as a “seductive racism for the left.”</p>
      <p>Adopting a strong cockney accent he demonstrated how racism could sound intellectual or terrify depending on how was saying it.</p>
      <p>But he said it did not seem so academic when it ended up with people being abused or living in fear.</p>
      <p>He spoke about the abuse that Luciana Berger had suffered as he introduced his friend who is running to be Lib Dem MP for Finchley and Golders Green - a seat which has a large proportion of Jewish voters.</p>
      <p>Berger described the difficult path she says she has been forced down because of the change in Labour over the last few years.</p>
      <p>Speaking slowly and deliberately she told an audience in central London: “Never did I think I would be forced out of the Labour party because of anti Jewish racism but that is what has happened - and I’m not the only one.”</p>
      <p>“Jeremy Corbyn has changed everything. I went from being a Labour MP to being seen as a Jewish MP”</p>
      <p>She added: "I will tell you at the intersection of anti-Semitism and misogyny you will find a quantity and a quality of hatred which is worse than one plus the other.”</p>
      <p>She called on the Equality and Human Rights Commission to publish their investigation into the party before the election so that voters know what they’re opting for.</p>
      <p>Speaking directly to those considering backing her former party she asked: “How can you vote for this? What message does that send?”</p>
      <p>The former Labour MP was speaking as her new party announced their plan to uphold equalities and human rights.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liberal-democrats">Liberal Democrats</a> have promised to protect places of worship from hate crimes and terror attacks if they win the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/general-election">general election</a> . The party is promising more funding for security - and also says it would bring in tougher sentences for hate crime. Home Office figures released last month showed a 10% rise in hate crimes- offences motivated by hostility towards someone's race, religion, sexual orientation, disability or transgender identity - in England and Wales in 2018/19.</p>
      <p>The Liberal Democrats say they will turn all such crimes into "aggravated offences", meaning maximum sentences would rise.</p>
      <p>Just under half of religious hate crime offences were targeted against Muslims in 2018/19, the Home Office said, and 18% were targeted against Jewish people.</p>
      <p>Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman Chuka Umunna said: "This election like no other in recent times is about the kind of country we want to live in".</p>
      <p>Umunna said the vote is a choice between an "open, liberal" society and "the forces of reaction".</p>
