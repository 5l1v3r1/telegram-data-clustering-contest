      <h2>Time Out's EAT List ranks restaurants in 50 cities around the world - the list celebrates 'the very best places to eats'</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T11:29:36+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 11:29</time> by <a rel="author">Simon Meechan</a></address>
      <p>Culture magazine Time Out has revealed which restaurant it considers to be the best in Newcastle.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.timeout.com/about/latest-news/the-eat-list-by-time-out-reveals-the-best-restaurants-in-cities-around-the-uk-110619">EAT List by Time Out</a> saw editors and writers crisscross the UK from Aberdeen to Brighton, and ate their way through hundreds of restaurants in Great Britain and Northern Ireland ahead of picking the best one for 20 cities.</p>
      <p>The list names Blackfriars as Time Out's favourite <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-restaurants">Newcastle restaurant</a> .</p>
      <p>Time Out says: "At Blackfriars Restaurant, diners can go full medieval-themed banquet (for large groups booking in advance) or simply enjoy fine European dining in a unique setting: a 13th-century friary.</p>
      <p>Those going all out can enjoy a whole suckling pig with all the trimmings, or simply the rare-breed pork belly, black pudding mash, leeks and apple gravy."</p>

      <p>James Manning, Global Projects Editor at Time Out, says: "The Time Out EAT List reflects the way people across the UK (and the world) love to eat right now, from classic curry houses to hip vegan joints.</p>
      <p>"We prize the places that combine great cooking with atmosphere and service, with an unashamed bias towards great-value restaurants you’ll want to visit again and again.</p>
      <p>"There has never been a better time to dine out in the UK, and this is your essential guide to the best spots for every occasion.</p>
      <p>"At Time Out, we've eaten our way through countless restaurants for more than 50 years on our quest to discover the best of the city.</p>
      <p>"Time Out's recommendations are made by expert, independent local writers and our reviewers visit anonymously and pay their way.</p>
      <p>"It's a given that for a venue to make one of Time Out’s recommended lists the food has to be amazing, but we're looking for a whole eating experience that’s truly memorable."</p>
