      <h1>Ryan Lowe issues 'hands-off' warning over Plymouth Argyle goalkeeper Mike Cooper</h1>
      <h2>The 20-year-old starred for the Pilgrims in a 1-1 draw with Everton Under-23s on Sunday</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T11:16:55+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 11:16</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Errington</a></address>
      <p>Ryan Lowe has issued a ‘hands-off’ warning to any clubs who have taken note of the potential of Plymouth Argyle’s 20-year-old goalkeeper Mike Cooper.</p>
      <p>The Pilgrims’ prospect is currently the back-up to first choice shot-stopper Alex Palmer, the loan signing from West Bromwich Albion.</p>
      <p>But when Cooper has played, such as in the 1-0 EFL Trophy defeat by Chelsea Under-21s at Home Park last month, he has been in fine form.</p>
      <p>Cooper followed that up by making a series of excellent saves when Argyle drew 1-1 with Everton in the Premier League Under-23 Cup at Southport FC last Sunday.</p>

      <p>Performances of that quality, against such high-level opposition, will not have gone un-noticed.</p>
      <p>Lowe was asked by Plymouth Live whether he expected other clubs to start showing interest in the talented young ‘keeper.</p>
      <p>He replied: “Good question, I haven’t thought of that because he’s my goalkeeper and he’s contracted to us.</p>
      <p>“He’s not going anywhere and if he does we want a lot of money for him.</p>
      <p>“Do you know what, I haven’t thought about it, but what about Adam Randell? He was the best player on the pitch in midfield.</p>
      <p>“No-one talks about him. Are people going to come calling for him?</p>
      <p>“Young Jarvis (Cleal) played right wing-back and was flying past their 23s as if no-one was there, so it weren’t just Coops.”</p>
      <p>Lowe added: “I wouldn’t think about anyone picking up the phone (about Cooper).</p>
      <p>“If they do, it’s going to cost them a lot of money so that’s fine, but he ain’t going nowhere because he’s my goalkeeper.</p>
      <p>“He’s only a youngster and has still got more to come.”</p>
      <p>Cooper signed a two-year contract with Argyle when he turned professional in 2018 which runs until the end of this season.</p>
      <p>To date, he has made a total of five starts and two substitute appearances for the Pilgrims.</p>
