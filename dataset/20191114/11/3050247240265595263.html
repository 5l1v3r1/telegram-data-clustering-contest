      <h3>Bitcoin trends downwards at $8.6K</h3>

      <p>Bitcoin has spent most of the week <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-stays-static-at-8-800-as-neo-bnb-steal-the-limelight">steadily eroding gains</a> it made previously, first losing support at $9,000 and exiting a trading corridor that had previously kept it rangebound between $9,000 and $9,500.</p>
      <p>Opinions remain mixed about the near-term prospects for traders, but bearish sentiment is creeping in as losses continue.</p>
      <p>In his most recent update for subscribers of his Telegram channel, regular Cointelegraph contributor <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/authors/filbfilb">filbfilb</a> warned that there was now potential for shorting BTC/USD and that a sharper drop could occur.</p>
      <p>“Looks like we need to go lower. Getting signs to flip short but waiting on candle closes,” he said during Thursday’s trading.</p>
      <p>As Cointelegraph reported, lower levels do not necessarily signal trouble for Bitcoin. According to some analysts, as well as the traditionally accurate Stock-to-Flow model for Bitcoin price forecasting, $8,300 is a <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-rallies-hardest-in-november-so-why-are-the-charts-bearish">realistic average price</a> from now until May 2020.</p>
      <p>Markets nonetheless continue to be erratic, with no one predicting October’s sudden advance to $10,500, which became the second-largest daily move in Bitcoin’s history.</p>
      <h3>Altcoins abandon bullish moves</h3>
      <p><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/altcoin">Altcoins</a> meanwhile have failed to keep hold of gains from earlier in the week, reversing Wednesday’s performance to shed a few percent on average.</p>
      <p>Ether (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price-index">ETH</a>), the largest altcoin by market cap, dropped 1.6% to $184, while others in the top twenty coins fared worse, losing up to 4.5%. Stellar (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/stellar">XLM</a>) brought up the rear, trading 5.5% lower.</p>

      <p>The overall cryptocurrency market cap was $238.7 billion at press time, with Bitcoin’s share 65.8%.</p>
