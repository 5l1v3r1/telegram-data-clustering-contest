      <p>Accurate and precise measurement of major, minor and trace elements in samples from environmental sources is a key requirement across the world. Samples such as surface waters, potable waters and soils must meet the concentration limits specified in a range of legislative standards, such as EPA Methods 6010, 6020, 200.7 and 200.8 and the European Water Framework Directive.<br/><br/>In this webinar, you will discover how the latest ICP-OES and ICP-MS instruments and software from Thermo Scientific meet and exceed analysis standards for different environmental sample types.<br/><br/>In this webinar you will learn about:<br/>- Environmental analysis legislation<br/>- Which trace elemental analysis instruments are best suited to different environmental measurements<br/>- Analysis performance for selected environmental applications</p>
