      <p>A dog walker mowed down by a driver is questioning “what police are for” after no action was taken after the accident which has left her bedbound.</p>
      <p>Jasmine Doherty, 48, was left with a broken arm and leg when a driver ploughed into her on Kirkmichael Road, Crosshill, near her home.</p>
      <p>The air traffic controller was out with her Pointer-cross pooch Loki when a car came over a blind bend at dusk on October 11.</p>
      <p>Police wrote off the accident as the driver had sun in his eyes due to it being low in the sky.</p>
      <p>But Jasmine, who has been signed off sick for eight weeks and will need a full medical assessment before returning to work, is questioning why no-one has faced any action.</p>
      <p>She told the Post: “I’d like the driver to know that it’s not open season on pedestrians- you can’t just mow people down and not face consequences.</p>
      <p>“I’ve always been very independent and in the space of a second I’m basically helpless.</p>
      <p>“I’ve got a wheelchair in my kitchen because I can’t prepare food.</p>
      <p>“My friend’s looking after my dog because I can’t.</p>
      <p>“I’d like the driver to face some consequences.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Jasmine was out walking Loki on the rural road when the driver came round the corner at 40mph.</p>
      <p>She said: “I don’t think he was speeding but he was driving too fast for the conditions.</p>
      <p>“He’s saying the sun was in his eyes- and it was low in the sky- but even without that he was going so fast he couldn’t react.</p>
      <p>“I just didn’t have time to step on to the verge.</p>
      <p>Fortunately Loki was unharmed but Jasmine was “screaming in pain” and was taken to hospital in an ambulance.</p>
      <p>Jasmine said: “I’ve had surgery on my arm and leg.</p>
      <p>“They put a pin right the way down one of the bones in my leg.</p>
      <p>“And they’ve put plates and screws on both bones in the arm.</p>
      <p>“One of the breaks actually goes down to the wrist so I imagine I’ll get arthritis from that.</p>
      <p>“And I’ll set off metal detectors everywhere I’ll go.”</p>
      <p>Jasmine, who admits she now doesn’t feel safe on the rural roads near her home, is questioning the police decision.</p>
      <p>She said: “I just wonder what the hell there for.</p>
      <p>“They go on about road safety all the time but you can literally run somebody over and they don’t do anything.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“I don’t think they took a statement from me until four or five days later in hospital.</p>
      <p>“And at that visit they told me they weren’t taking any action.</p>
      <p>“They said it was because the sun was in the driver’s eyes.</p>
      <p>“He could have killed me- would it still just be ‘oh well, never mind’?”</p>
      <p>A Police Scotland spokesman said: “At approximately 5.30pm on Friday, October 11, a road traffic collision occurred on Kirkmichael Road near the town of Crosshill.</p>
      <p>“Ayrshire Road Policing Officers attended and discovered that a female, who had been walking her dog at this location, had been struck by a Volkswagen Passat vehicle which was travelling towards Crosshill. The female was taken to Ayr Hospital by ambulance and found to have leg and arm fractures.</p>
      <p>“As a result a driver was subject to roadside procedures and a report detailing the circumstances was submitted for record.</p>
      <p>“The driver of the vehicle involved was not charged as a consequence of the incident.”</p>
