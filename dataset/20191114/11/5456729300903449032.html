      <h1>Enmeshed in arms scandal, Amosun seeks establishment of South West Development Commission - Premium Times Nigeria</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T11:06:39+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 11:06</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/top-news/362838-enmeshed-in-arms-scandal-amosun-seeks-establishment-of-south-west-development-commission.html" target="_blank">QueenEsther Iroanusi</a></address>
      <p>Ibikunle Amosun (Ogun Central, APC) who is enmeshed in arms scandal, is seeking the establishment of the South West Development Commission.</p>
      <p>The bill “South West Development Commission (Est, etc) Bill, 2019” was read for the first time during plenary on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The introduction of the bill comes a day after the Senate re-introduced a bill seeking to establish the South East Development Commission (SEDC).</p>
      <p>The south-east bill, which scaled first reading on the floor, was passed by the 8th Senate but failed to receive presidential assent.</p>
      <p>Already in existence is the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) and the North East Development Commission (NEDC), whose establishment bill received presidential assent in October, 2017.</p>
      <p>The lawmakers are expected to debate details of Mr Amosun’s bill on another legislative day.</p>
      <h4>The Arms Import</h4>
      <p><b><a href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/360875-exclusive-documents-show-ex-gov-amosun-illegally-imported-arms-ammunition.html">PREMIUM TIMES published exclusive documents</a></b> exposing how Mr Amosun illegally imported rifles and ammunition into the country during his tenure as governor between 2011 and 2019.</p>
      <p>The scandal was first exposed when PREMIUM TIMES reported in June that <b><a href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/336813-amosun-surrenders-1000-ak47-rifles-4million-bullets-acquired-before-2019-elections.html">Mr Amosun surrendered 1,000 units of AK-47 rifles</a></b>, millions of bullets, an armoured personnel carrier, bulletproof vests and helmets to the police in Abeokuta without evidence they were legally acquired.</p>
      <p>The report generated <b><a href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/336909-nigerians-unite-in-anger-over-amosuns-1000-ak47-4-million-bullets-stockpile.html">a nationwide outrage</a></b> and Mr Amosun posted<b> <a href="https://twitter.com/SIAmosun/status/1143655276903620608">a lengthy denial on his Twitter page</a></b>, in a desperate attempt to weaken the report.</p>
      <p>Further investigations showed Mr Amosun’s claim to be false and he did not get any authorisation to imports guns and ammunition into the country.</p>
      <p>The Nigerian government also confirmed to PREMIUM TIMES that the former Ogun State governor <b><a href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/361557-exclusive-govt-confirms-amosun-illegally-imported-1000-ak-47-guns-two-million-bullets.html">did not get approval</a> </b>to import the weapons.</p>
      <p>The police have refused to interrogate Mr Amosun even after<b> <a href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/340382-exclusive-arms-scandal-amosun-yet-to-account-for-780-bullets-police.html">their internal investigation indicted the former governor</a></b> of failing to explain how some packets of bullets were found opened when he handed them over.</p>
      <p>Mr Amosun is a regular contributor at the Senate. On Wednesday, a bill on Electronic Transactions – which he sponsored – was read for the first time.</p>
