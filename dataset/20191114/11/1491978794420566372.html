      </p>
      <p>Three more people have been arrested in connection with the murders of two 17-year-old boys at a house party.</p>
      <p>Dom Ansah and Ben Gillham-Rice were fatally stabbed by masked attackers at the private party on the Emerson Valley estate in Milton Keynes on 19 October.</p>
      <p>A 15-year-old boy from Milton Keynes was arrested on Thursday morning on suspicion of two counts of murder, Thames Valley police said. A 53-year-old man and a 40-year-old woman, both from Milton Keynes, were arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender. All three remain in police custody.</p>
      <p>The 15-year-old faces two additional counts of attempted murder.</p>
      <p>Ryan Brown, 23, and a 17-year-old boy who cannot be named for legal reasons were also stabbed in the attack and left with serious but non-life threatening injuries.</p>
      <p>Three other people have been charged in relation to the incident. Earl Bevans, 22, of no fixed address, Charlie Chandler, 21, of Bletchley, and a 16-year-old boy who cannot be named due to his age are accused of two counts of murder and two counts of attempted murder.</p>
      <p>The three charged suspects have been remanded in custody and will appear at Luton crown court in January.</p>
      <p>A 27-year-old man who was arrested on 26 October on suspicion of conspiracy to murder has since been released under investigation.</p>
