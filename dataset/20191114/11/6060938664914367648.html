      <p>Shashi Tharoor, a well-known politician, and a social media personality is proficient in a lot of things-most importantly, his vocabulary which amazes everyone. His speeches can even act as a learning material for kids and school students! Needless to say, the internet is in awe of him!</p>
      <p>A recent appearance at an interaction is winning him praise all over again, with the internet applauding him for giving out the perfect reply to a curious school student.</p>
      <p>A video of Shashi Tharoor's recent talk is going viral on the internet, making people think about the simpler school times when there were hardly any gadgets! The MP himself shared the same on his Twitter account.</p>
      <p>The politician was talking about his life experiences when a student posed an interesting question in front of him, asking him to educate him on a new word which he could add to his dictionary. The student said,</p>
      <p>"As you have been globally acknowledged as a man of vocabulary I would like you to give me and the crowd a new word for us to learn."</p>
      <p>While the intrigued audience, including the student, were expecting something new and different, the response was nothing like they had expected.</p>
      <p>Tharoor tweeted, "My reply to a student who asked me to give him a new word in view of my reputation as a fount of exotic vocabulary."</p>

      <p>Shocking his fans, the scholar said that despite what people think, he hardly ever made use of a dictionary and all of his knowledge was based on his prior learning, which he during his schooling.</p>
      <p>He can be heard saying,</p>
      <p>"I will give you a very simple, very old word. Read. Thatâ€™s the only way I acquired a vocabulary. People think I am some sort of nutcase who studies dictionaries all day long. I have barely opened a dictionary in my life. But I have read extensively. The reason I was like this because I lived in India without television, without a computer, without Nintendo, without Play Station, without mobile phones. All I had were books."</p>
      <p>The politician also encouraged the young audience to actively take up reading. He said that he was an avid reader, which helped him extensively understand a word and its usage. He also talked about how reading helped him pass time during his childhood whenever he was forced to spend time indoors due to his asthma.</p>
