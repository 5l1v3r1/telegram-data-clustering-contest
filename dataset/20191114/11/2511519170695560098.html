      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/tom-davies">Tom Davies</a> insists he is ready to make up for lost time with <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/england-under-21s">England Under-21s</a>.</p>
      <p>The in-form <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Everton">Everton</a> midfielder has returned to captain the Young Lions this term.</p>
      <p>A shoulder injury ruled him out of <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/euro-2019">Euro 2019</a> but he is now preparing to face Albania in Shkoder on Friday.</p>
      <p>England have won all three Euro 2021 qualifiers so far – extending their unbeaten record in qualification matches to 38 – with Davies eager to play his part again.</p>
      <p>“I was gutted to miss out on the Euros because we’d worked so hard and I was a big part of it,” said the 21-year-old, who has captained the Young Lions in three of their four games this term.</p>
      <p>“It happens to every player, getting injured. The start of the season was tough, not getting in the (Everton) team, but I’ve come to realise that it’s about keeping a level.</p>
      <p>“Not getting too high when you’re playing, not too low when you are not. Focus on what is next. I’ve had a few good games but the focus is Albania. That’s the general idea I’m working with.”</p>
      <p>Davies watched on as the Young Lions failed to qualify from Group C in Italy and San Marino, leaving winless after defeats to France and Romania and drawing with Croatia.</p>
      <p>The squad was accused of being over-confident following their premature exit and, while most of the team has moved on, Davies wants to put any lingering disappointment right.</p>
      <p>“It was a great group of lads with a lot of quality. They’ve all kicked on this year and a lot are doing really well with their clubs each week,” he said.</p>
      <p>“We were disappointed with how it went but you can’t affect that now. We want to qualify for the next Euros and that’ll be my chance to show how good I am. What’s happened, happened.</p>
      <p>“Every squad is going to be different. There are a few similar faces but you’re not going to have an exact like-for-like team.</p>
      <p>“We’ve a lot of attacking, pacey players in this group that we might not have had in the last one.</p>
      <p>“But we had a very good group of people who can handle a ball well and goalscorers. This group is exciting to be part of.”</p>
      <p>England are top of Group Three, ahead of Austria on goal difference with a game in hand, ahead of their final qualifier of the year while Albania sit fourth with five points from five matches.</p>

      <p>“It’ll be a tough game. Going away is always tough. They’ll make it difficult for us,” Davies, who scored his first goal for 18 months in Everton’s 2-1 win at Southampton last weekend, added.</p>
      <p>“It’s not going to be what we’re used to and might be a bit of a shock to some of the lads. We’ve got enough quality to beat them. We’ll be focusing on that all week.”</p>
