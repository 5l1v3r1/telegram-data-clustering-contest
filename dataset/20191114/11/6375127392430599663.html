      <h1>What Sanya and brother Jak are planning together</h1>

      <h3>SANYA Lopez plays Nora Aunor and Phillip Salvador’s daughter in “Isa Pang Bahaghari”, a drama film which was entered in the Metro Filmfest. How did she feel when their movie didn’t make it as a finalist entry when their director himself, Joel Lamangan, says she surprised him with her very effective acting and she has a good chance of bagging the best supporting actress award?</h3>
      <p>“For me, okay lang po kasi I believe everything happens for a reason,” she says at her launch as one Beautederm Kapuso endorsers. “I’m just too happy that I’m a part of such a great movie. Being given the chance to work with drama icons like Nora Aunor and Phillip Salvador is already a great blessing and honor for me, also getting to work with Joel Lamangan as our director since I learned so much from him.”</p>
      <p>Sanya is asked again about the male ABS-CBN starlet who claimed that they went steady she seems so tired of it. “Naku, luma na 'yan. Ilang beses ko nang sinagot 'yan. Never naging kami. He’s a good person and we became friends but we were never on. Tigilan na sana 'yan kasi ayokong magkaroon kami ng issue. I’m just too busy with my career right now and I’m not ready to be in a relationship.”</p>
      <p>What can she say now that Beautederm president-CEO Rhea Tan announced that she will give her and her other Kapuso endorsers, Camille Prats, Rita Daniela, Ken Chan and Pauline Mendoza, their own franchise outlet selling Beautiderm products? “Hindi ako agad nakaimik when I heard it. Imagine, she’s so generous gagawin niya kaming negosyante. If ever, I want to have a store sa Laguna and I will ask our mom to manage it. Isa sa talaga dreams namin ng kuya ko (Jak Roberto) na magkaroon ng sariling business at heto, sinagot agad ang panalangin namin. Isa pang plan namin is to buy our own house and lot. Sana, may makuha kaming malapit lang sa GMA-7 para hindi na kami mahirapang mag-commute when we report for work.”</p>
      <p>Ms. Rhea Tan is asked why she got Sanya, Camille and Pauline as Beautederm endorsers. “Sanya is very talented at napansin agad as Danaya in ‘Encantadia’. Then she shone on her own sa ‘Haplos’, ‘Cain at Abel’ and ‘Dahil sa Pag-ibig’. Now, may movie pa siya with Nora Aunor and has become a top and strong online influencer. As for Camille, fan ako niyan, Princess Sarah days pa niya. And she turned out to be a fine drama actress in hits like ‘Munting Heredera’ and ‘Borrowed Wife’, and now host of the women’s show, ‘Mars’. Pauine naman is one of GMA’s fastest rising young actresses who shone in such shows as ‘Kambal Karibal’ and ‘Love You Two’. I know she’ll go far kaya bagay siya sa Beautederm na available na not only here but also abroad.”</p>
