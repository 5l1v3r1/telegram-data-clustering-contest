      <h3>COMBINED agents of the Philippine National Police Integrity Monitoring and Enforcement Group and the National Capital Region Police Office on Wednesday afternoon arrested four members of the Manila Police District Station 5 accused of extorting P500,000 from the wife of an arrested drug offender reportedly in exchange for his release, PNP-IMEG director, Colonel Ronald O. Lee said yesterday.</h3>
      <p>In a report to PNP Officer-in-Charge, Lieutenant General Archie Francisco F. Gamboa, the official identified the four, all beat patrollers of the MPD Station 5 in Ermita district as Corporals Nickson Mina, Juan Carlo de Guzman and Francis Mikko Gagarin and Patrolman Tom Hikilan.</p>
      <p>Lee said that with the help of the NCRPO Regional Intelligence Division under Brigadier General Debold M. Sinas and the MPD District Intelligence Division under Brig. Gen. Bernabe M.

      <p>According to Lee, walk-in complainant Alaysa Panansang went to their headquarters in Camp Crame to report the presence of the four policemen whom she claimed have demanded P500,000 from her in exchange for the release of her husband Kelvie Kamid Pamansang who was allegedly arrested by the accused for violation of Republic Act 9165 or the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002 last Tuesday.</p>
