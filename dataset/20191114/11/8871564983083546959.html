      </p>
      <p>Although this will technically be more of an assembly than a parade <a href="https://coconuts.co/hongkong/news/end-of-the-rainbow-hong-kong-police-say-no-to-annual-pride-parade/">after police issued a letter of objection today</a>, don’t let that stop you from getting loud and proud this year. The past year saw some important developments for Hong Kong’s LGBTQ community, from the government <a href="https://coconuts.co/hongkong/news/government-recognise-sex-partnerships-spousal-visa-applications/">officially recognizing same-sex partnerships for spousal visas</a>, to a landmark ruling saying <a href="https://coconuts.co/hongkong/news/major-win-for-same-sex-couples-as-court-recognizes-right-to-spousal-benefits/">same-sex spouses were entitled to the same employer-provided benefits</a> as opposite-sex ones. Still, there’s a long way to go in terms of equality for the city’s LGBTQ community — as evidenced by another recent <a href="https://coconuts.co/hongkong/news/hong-kong-court-rules-against-same-sex-civil-partnerships/">ruling closing the door on same-sex civil partnerships</a> — so be sure to get out there this Saturday and make your voice heard.</p>

      <p>Did you know that Hong Kong is home to <a href="https://www.afcd.gov.hk/english/conservation/hkbiodiversity/speciesgroup/speciesgroup_birds.html">more than 530 species of birds</a>? One person who tried to capture some of them is urban sketcher Gary Yeung, who was last spotted by the <i>Coconuts HK</i> team <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B1pZNG3jVnJ/">sketching the Hong Kong Way</a>, and who is best known for his pen and paper sketches of the city. He will also be hosting an exhibition displaying his sketches of birds native to Hong Kong at this cozy gallery in Wan Chai. Some of the birds Yeung sketched include Eurasian tree sparrows, spotted doves, and a fork-tailed sunbird.</p>

F11 Foto Museum will be celebrating its fifth birthday with this exhibition of photos of old Hong Kong taken in 1959 and 1960 by Dutch photographer Ed van der Elsken. The collection will feature 130 black-and-white photos of Elsken’s 13-month stay in Hong Kong, a city he reportedly once described as “the prettiest of harbor cities.”</p>

      <p>Blue Lotus Gallery will present this exhibition featuring photographs of the famous and long-gone Kowloon Walled City by Greg Girard and Ian Lambot. For more than 50 years, the walled city was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dj_8ucS3lMY">a source of fascination for observers</a>; it began as a squatter settlement, and later became known as the most densely populated place on earth, a lawless labyrinth where crime, commerce, and community co-existed.</p>
      <p>Nearly 30 years on from the Walled City’s demolition — Kowloon Walled City Park now sits in its place — this project will offer a unique insight into the people who lived there.</p>
