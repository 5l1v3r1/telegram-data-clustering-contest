      <h1>Boffins uncover 5G flaws that could enable real-time location tracking</h1>
      <h2>Awww G</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T11:22:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 11:22</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theinquirer.net/author/profile/3180/roland-moore-colyer" target="_blank">Roland Moore-Colyer</a></address>
      <p><b>SECURITY FLAWS IN 5G</b> could let cyber creeps stalk your real-time location, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6544575-5GReasoner.html">according</a> to security boffins from Purdue University and the University of Iowa.</p>
      <p>They found that some 11 flaws exist in the 5G protocol that could enable hackers to spoof emergency alerts or secretly disconnect a phone from a network, as well as track users' real-time locations.</p>
      <p>And there's a kicker, as some of the flaws could also be exploited on existing 4G networks. </p>
      <p>The vulnerabilities take a bit of wrangling to exploit. For example, an attacker would need to create a malicious radio base station to carry out attacks. And the researchers built a tool called 5GReasoner to find and exploit the vulnerabilities.</p>
      <p>To track real-time location, the researchers had to obtain the new and old temporary network identifiers of a target's phone in order to discover the location paging occasion and thus extrapolate a person's real-time location.</p>
      <p>So exploiting them might be a bit out of the reach of your garden variety hacker. Though the researchers noted that anyone with a practical knowledge of 4G and 5G networks, as well as access to a low cost software-defined radio, could potentially exploit the flaws. Best keep an eye on any telecoms engineer mates you have with a dodgy look on their mugs.</p>
      <p>Regardless of how easy they may be to exploit, the potential for cyber deviants to able to stalk someone or send out fake emergency alerts - <a href="https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/3024423/glitch-in-emergency-alert-system-warns-hawaii-residents-of-ballistic-missle">think of the kind that had Hawaiians spooked that they were under imminent ballistic missile attack last year</a> - is rather concerning.</p>
      <p>The clever folks notified telecom network worldwide trade body GSM Association of new vulnerabilities they found. But the GSMA judged the threat of such vulnerabilities to be "null or low-impact", and its given no indication of if and when the flaws will be fixed.</p>
      <p>Maybe <a href="https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/3065654/iphone-12-release-date-price-specs-increase-in-costs-rumour-5g">Apple's move to wait until at least 2020 before coming up with a 5G iPhone</a> seems sensible, given it doesn't seem as secure as it was once made out to be. µ</p>
