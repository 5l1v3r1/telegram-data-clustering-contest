      <h1>Google Play Store autoplay videos are coming, but you'll be able to turn them off</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T11:45:48+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 11:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/author/manuel-vonau/" target="_blank">Manuel Vonau</a></address>
      <p>Many people find autoplaying videos incredibly annoying, but they help content creators and advertisers hook up consumers more efficiently. That's why many platforms try to find a balance by making autoplay opt-out and letting you turn it off in settings, all while hoping that only a small percentage of people will actually do that. After Google <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/08/30/play-store-autoplay-videos/">recently introduced autoplay videos to the Play Store</a>, the company now seems to be testing such a toggle.</p>
      <p>A tipster reached out to us to show us a new entry that has appeared in his Play Store's Settings called 'Auto-play videos.' When they tap that, a pop-up opens that lets them choose from three options that are pretty standard across many apps: 'Auto-play videos at any time,' 'auto-play videos over Wi-Fi only,' and 'do not auto-play videos.' Since none of us at AP can reproduce this just now, it seems that it's part of a limited A/B test.</p>

      <p>Hopefully, Google will roll out the option for everyone soon, as autoplaying videos can get annoying pretty fast.</p>
