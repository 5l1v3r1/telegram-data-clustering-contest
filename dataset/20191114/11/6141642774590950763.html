      <p>Britain will not appoint a new EU commissioner despite demands from Brussels to do so, the Government has confirmed.</p>
      <p>Britain’s ambassador to the EU Sir Tim Barrow sent a letter to European Commission headquarters on Thursday confirming the decision.</p>
      <p>A Government spokesman said: “We have written to the EU to confirm that pre-election guidance states the UK should not normally make nominations for international appointments during this period.”</p>

      <p>The incoming European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen has twice written to Mr Johnson demanding he provide a nomination to the new commission, in line with its obligations as a member state.</p>
      <p>European Commission spokeswoman Dana Spinant said they were considering how to respond to the UK letter.</p>
      <blockquote>It is an exceptional situation, we haven't been there before<cite>Dana Spinant, European Commission</cite></blockquote>
      <p>She said it was still Ms von der Leyen’s intention to go ahead with the formation of a new College of Commissioners on December 1, even though legally all member states are required to supply a commissioner.</p>
      <p>“We have had a few hours to consider the answer provided by the United Kingdom. This is a very special and complex situation,” she told reporters in Brussels.</p>
      <p>“It is an exceptional situation, we haven’t been there before.</p>
      <p>“Therefore all options and avenues are being discussed right now to see how we can – based on the position the UK has taken – achieve the forming of the next commission and have the commission in place by December 1, which remains our objective.”</p>
