      <p>While the prime minister is Croatia's main power in government, the president does have a say in foreign policy and defence issues.</p>
      <p>Despite this, the presidential role does not have a hand in vetoing the country's laws.</p>
      <p>In the upcoming election, the incumbent president Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic of the centre-right Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) will be up against a candidate from the Social Democrats and Croatia's former prime minister Zoran Milanovic.</p>
      <p>A recent opinion poll saw Grabar-Kitarovic taking the lead with 29% of the vote, while Milanovic polled at 24%.</p>
