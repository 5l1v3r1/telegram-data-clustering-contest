      <h1>Nipsey Hussle's Alleged Killer Has Motion Denied In Court</h1>

      <p>Los Angeles, CA – <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.53444/title.nipsey-hussle-artist-killa-twan-threatens-wack-100-blueface">Nipsey Hussle’s</a> alleged killer Eric Holder <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.50886/title.lapd-identifies-suspect-in-nipsey-hussle-shooting-death">pleaded not guilty</a> to all six charges brought against him in a Los Angeles courthouse last month.</p>
      <p>During court proceedings, Holder’s defense attorney motioned to have the two attempted murder charges dropped. According to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/theshaderoom/">The Shade Room,</a> a judge denied that motion on Thursday morning (November 14).</p>

      <p>Holder’s lawyers argued the “Kill Zone Theory” didn’t apply to the attempted murder charges related to the two other victims who were shot on March 31, the day the incident occurred. The defense wanted those charges dismissed.</p>
      <p>But Judge Robert J. Perry sided with the prosecution and stated, “I’m unwilling to do that.”</p>
      <p>The prosecution said Holder is guilty of attempted murder because of that same “Kill Zone Theory.” They say he may have only targeted one victim but due to his mode of attack — two firearms in this case — he had “intent to kill everyone in a particular zone, especially given that his initial target was not moving.”</p>
      <p>Nip was <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.50867/title.nipsey-hussle-reportedly-pronounced-dead-at-33">shot and killed</a> outside of his Marathon Clothing store in Los Angeles on March 31. Kerry Lathan, 56, and another man were shot in the melee.</p>
      <p>Holder’s trial is expected to begin in February 2020.</p>
