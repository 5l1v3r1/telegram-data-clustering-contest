In the 27th minute, Anju grabbed her second from a beautiful Amisha Baxla cross in which midfielder Nitu too had a role. However, Anju missed a sitter for her hattrick in the late minutes of the first half.</p>
      <p>After the half time, Panthers fought hard to silence Tigress. However, in the 57th-minute midfielder Nitu once again orchestrated a move to Amisha who struck it easily to make it 4-0 for Tigeress.</p>
      <p>Karen Estrocio scored the final goal for the Tigress as she received a ball from Amisha in the 66th minute.</p>
      <p>However, the Panthers were not ready to go down without a fight as Lalnun Siami slashed a ball past the Tigresses defence to Sree Lakshmi A who scored the consolation goal for the Panthers. Three minutes later, Siami, who was a standout performer for Panthers, scored the final goal of the game to make it 5-2.
