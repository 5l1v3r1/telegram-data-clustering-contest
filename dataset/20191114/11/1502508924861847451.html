      <p>Tougher emissions rules will hit Daimler's profits in 2020 and 2021, prompting the German carmaker to seek more than 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) in savings from cutting staff costs at its <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/mercedes-benz">Mercedes-Benz </a>business by the end of 2022, it said on Thursday.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/daimler">Daimler </a>shares were down 2.3% in early trading at 52.17 euros, the biggest decline on Germany's DAX blue-chip index, which was down 0.3%.</p>
      <p>Management positions will be cut by around 10%, and company said it would also seek more than 300 million euros from cutting personnel costs - plus another 250 million euros in fixed costs - at its trucks business.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/daimler">Daimler </a>said it needed to sell more electric vehicles to meet tougher <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/european-union">European Union </a>rules which force carmakers to cut carbon dioxide emissions from cars by 37.5% by 2030 compared with 2021 levels, and following a 40% cut between 2007 and 2021.</p>
      <p>The company said it expected to achieve a return on sales from operating activities at <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/mercedes-benz">Mercedes-Benz </a>Cars &amp; Vans of at least 4% in 2020 and at least 6% in 2022.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/mercedes-benz">Mercedes-Benz </a>expects <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/car-sales">car sales </a>to grow by around 3% in 2020, but said potential trade tariffs and Brexit could depress the return on sales by up to 1%.</p>
