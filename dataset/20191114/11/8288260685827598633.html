      <h1>General Election 2019: Cannock Chase candidates for Conservatives, Labour, Lib Dems, Brexit Party and others</h1>
      <h2>The Cannock Chase constituency includes: Cannock, Rugeley, and Hednesford</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T11:45:19+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 11:45</time> by <a rel="author">Charlotte Regen, https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/authors/charlotte-regen/</a></address>
      <p>A general election is set to take place on December 12- meaning voters across the Cannock Chase constituency will have their say on who gets the seat.</p>
      <p>The conservatives gained the seat in the 2010 poll after a 14 per cent swing in their favour.</p>
      <p>Every election since then they have managed to hold the seat.</p>
      <p>The party saw an increase of 10.8 per cent in votes in the 2017 election and have seen the parties votes rise in every poll.</p>
      <p>Here are the candidates:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Labour -  Anne Hobbs</li>
        <li>Liberal Democrats - Not standing due to Remain alliance</li>
        <li>Conservatives - Amanda Milling</li>
        <li>Green - Paul Woodhead</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Why are we having an early election?</h3>
      <p>A general election - which determines who runs the country - normally happens every five years.</p>
      <p>There are 650 constituencies, where voters are invited to select an MP to represent their area.</p>
      <p>Nearly three-and-a-half years ago voters were called to the ballot box to decide whether the UK should remain in or leave the European Union.</p>
      <p>The majority chose to leave and we were supposed to have left on March, 29 this year, however, it has since been delayed after MPs failed to back plans put forward by former Prime Minister Theresa May and now Boris Johnson.</p>
