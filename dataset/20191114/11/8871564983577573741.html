      <h1>Protesters gathering in Sheung Shui as videos circulate of men beating black-clad demonstrators</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T11:34:32+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 11:34</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/Coconuts%20Hong%20Kong" target="_blank">Coconuts Hong Kong</a></address>
      <p>Dozens of angry protesters have gathered in Sheung Shui this evening after videos began circulating online this afternoon appearing to show men beating pro-democracy demonstrators with metal rods.</p>
      <p>Video began circulating on social media platforms and apps like Telegram showing a group of at least 10 men — some with face masks — wielding metals rods and beating people wearing black, the color of choice for anti-government protesters.</p>
      <p>According to Stand News, the incident is said to have <a href="https://www.thestandnews.com/politics/%E4%B8%8D%E6%96%B7%E6%9B%B4%E6%96%B0-%E4%B8%8A%E6%B0%B4%E7%8F%BE%E6%8C%81%E6%A2%B0%E7%8B%82%E5%BE%92%E8%BF%BD%E6%89%93%E9%BB%91%E8%A1%A3%E9%9D%92%E4%BA%BA-%E5%A5%B3%E5%AD%90%E8%A2%AB%E4%B8%8D%E6%98%8E%E4%BA%BA%E5%A3%AB%E6%93%84%E8%B5%B0/">taken place close to North District Town Hall</a>, which yesterday was the scene of a clash in which pro-Beijing loyalists and pro-democracy protesters hurled bricks at each other, resulting in an elderly man being sent to hospital in a critical condition after <a href="https://coconuts.co/hongkong/news/2-in-critical-condition-following-clashes-in-new-territories/">being hit in the head with a projectile</a>.</p>

      <p>In one video circulating online, the men with long rods first attack a man carrying a backpack before walking away. A man off-camera can be heard remarking “that’s an extendable baton,” which as of September has been <a href="https://www.hongkongfp.com/2019/09/10/hong-kong-police-issue-extendable-batons-off-duty-officers-critics-concerned-potential-abuse/">issued to off-duty police officers</a> (though similar batons have also recently been spotted in the hands of civilians).</p>

      <p>Other videos show a man in a white shirt violently grab a woman dressed in black, holding on to her by either or her hair or her shirt collar.</p>
      <p>In one video posted by a youth media group called Spark, the woman in black can be heard yelling “help me!” as others from above look on and yell “don’t hit people!”</p>

      <p>In a second video of the incident, onlookers can be heard yelling at the woman “what’s your name?”, before the man in white drags the woman off.</p>

      <p>According to on.cc, police didn’t arrive at the scene until about 2:20pm, more than two hours after they said they received initial reports, prompting some protesters to label the incident “another 721,” a reference to <a href="https://coconuts.co/hongkong/news/chaos-and-bloodshed-36-in-hospital-after-men-in-white-shirts-brutally-attack-protesters-journalists-and-residents-in-yuen-long/">the brutal attack on pro-democracy protesters, commuters and journalists</a> at Yuen Long MTR station by a white-shirted mob on July 21. That incident caused a further erosion in public faith in the police force after officers took at more than 30 minutes to arrive at the brutal onslaught.</p>
      <p>Police confirmed in a press conference today that <a href="https://www.facebook.com/HongKongPoliceForce/videos/891059697958046/?notif_id=1573718593551354&amp;notif_t=live_video">they received a report about the Sheung Shui incident at around 12pm</a>, and attributed some of the blame for police not responding quickly enough to protesters blocking roads.</p>
      <p>“Sometimes there may be road blockages, and nearly 100 black-clad protesters at scenes shouting loudly or doing some disorderly conduct, which may affect work at scene,” Senior Superintendent Kong Wing-cheung said today.</p>
      <p>When asked why it took so long for police to respond, Kong said he didn’t “have sufficient information at this moment to provide to you.” As for whether the baton-wielding men could have been off-duty officers, Kong said the model seen in the video was not the same as the one issued to officers.</p>
