        <b>After much delay and debates, the All India Football Federation (AIFF) have finally found a broadcaster to show the I-League matches in Lex Sportel Vision Pvt. Ltd’s D Sport, who signed a three-year deal. The 13th edition of India's the now second-division football league starts on November 30.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The pausing of I-League matches last season was the first hints of the storm, which later brewed over I-League, ISL, and the AIFF later in the year. However, now with the dust settled, AIFF has finally sorted it out by handing over the responsibilities to D Sport.</p>
      <p>The 2019-20 season, which would again have 11 teams and 110 matches fighting for the country’s coveted football title, will have an eight-camera set-up by the joint Ireland-based Instat Limited who will produce the feed of the live audio-visual coverage for broadcast on DSport. </p>
      <p>Instat also signed a three-year agreement with AIFF with the last two seasons showcased on Star Sports. Now, the new broadcast partners would be providing exclusive rights for on-air and digital content with FSDL (Football Sports Development Limited) also contributing partly to the cost of production.</p>
      <p>AIFF General Secretary Mr. Kushal Das in his statement said, ''I need to thank Lex Sportel Vision for penning a three-year deal with AIFF. It has enabled us to bank on Instat Limited's expertise in producing live telecast of Hero I-League matches on DSport. The eight-camera set-up for all matches will surely add to enhanced viewing for the fans. I also need to thank FSDL for negotiating and facilitating the deal,” reported Sportstar.</p>
