      <h1>Eros Grezda in fresh Albania row as Rangers flop embroiled in more drama</h1>
      <h2>The 24-year-old hasn't been involved with Rangers since April and was also dropped by his country.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T11:11:26+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 11:11</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Walker</a></address>
      <p>Rangers flop <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/eros-grezda">Eros Grezda</a> has hit back at Albania boss Edy Reja and insists he hasn't refused to turn out for his country.</p>
      <p>The winger walked out of Albania's camp for a double header against Iceland and Moldova in June for 'personal reasons'.</p>
      <p>He's also not played for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> since April and was told he has not future at the club by <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steven-gerrard">Steven Gerrard.</a></p>
      <p>And Albania boss Reja didn't miss the 24-year-old when quizzed about why he hadn't been recalled since that summer incident.</p>
      <p>He said: "We have created a nice balanced squad which give us many options. I want my players to come here and support us whether they are in the final team or not.</p>

      <p>"It is my job to pick the side.</p>
      <p>"In the case of Eros Grezda, I'm sorry what's happened with him because he was a player with great potential, but he couldn't accept some decisions made.</p>
      <p>"We invited him along, but he decided he could not accept my invitation to the squad.</p>
      <p>"My priority is Albania. And there is no individual bigger than the country."</p>
      <p>But Grezda hit back at the criticism and insisted he hadn't been called up by his country.</p>
      <p>He pointed out: "For the sake of accuracy, I need to clarify the controversy surrounding my position in the squad.</p>
      <p>"I have received no invitation for the squads for the last two games from either the manager or the Albanian FA.</p>
      <p>"I have been and always will be ready to represent my country and defend the Albanian colours."</p>
      <p>Grezda last played for Rangers in a 3-0 win over <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/motherwell-fc">Motherwell</a> in April.</p>
