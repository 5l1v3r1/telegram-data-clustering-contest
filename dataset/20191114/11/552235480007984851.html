      <h1>Stewartry RFC continue fine home form with fourth win in a row over Irvine</h1>
      <h2>The Blacks ran out 31-13 winners over the Ayrshire side and sit third in Tennent's West One</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T11:49:25+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 11:49</time> by <a rel="author">Stuart Gillespie, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/stuart-gillespie/</a></address>
      <p>Stewartry notched up a fourth league win in a row in Tennent’s West One as they continued to rebuild Fortress Greenlaw.</p>
      <p>Visitors Irvine kicked off in the cold, dry conditions and Stewartry’s Mick McCulloch was first to show with Austin and Milligan winning a first penalty.</p>
      <p>But within 10 minutes the Blacks were reduced to 14 men when Mattie Taylor was yellow carded for a dangerous tackle.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>However, this just spurred the Blacks on as Irvine won the penalty line out but two Jason Forsyth tackles won possession. This gave Danny Boyd the chance to lead a charge into the Irvine 22, backed up by Milligan and Robert Austin who broke clear to score the first try. The conversion was missed.</p>
      <p>Irvine hit back immediately, taking play into the Stewartry 22. They attacked the Stewartry line for six minutes before scoring in the corner, a successful conversion giving them a narrow lead.</p>

      <p>From the restart Irvine won the ball and a penalty line out on the halfway was defended with Andrew Picken taking play back to the Irvine 22. He won a penalty which Mosey kicked into the corner.</p>
      <p>The Blacks won their lineout with Forsyth again driving to the try line and a final forward drive saw prop Mick McCulloch over the line for the second try, the conversion missed again.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Irvine again pushed Stewartry back into their own half and converted the second of two penalties to level things up at 10-10.</p>
      <p>From the restart, Stewartry kicked long and took play right to the try line where hooker Kieran McGuire scored the third try after being driven over with the pack behind him.</p>

      <p>Craig Mosey converted for a half time score of 17-10 to Stewartry.</p>
      <p>The hosts were fast out of the traps with replacements Hogg and McMorran leading the charge. Under pressure Irvine gave away three penalties before Jason Forsyth scored a deserved bonus point fourth try which Mosey again converted.</p>
      <p>In 55 minutes Irvine converted a second penalty. Stewartry scored a final fifth try in 63 minutes after Hogg broke down the middle, releasing Craig Mosey for a 30-metre sprint into the posts and where he then added the conversion.</p>
