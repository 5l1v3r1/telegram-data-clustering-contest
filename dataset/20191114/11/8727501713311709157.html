      <p>The news you’ve been waiting for is here. <a href="https://www.timeout.com/london/music/classic-rock-and-sad-wanking-harry-styles-debut-reviewed">Harry Styles</a> is officially going on tour next year. The former One Direction star announced the 11-month tour on Instagram. Love on Tour kicks off in Birmingham next April, hitting Sheffield and Dublin before arriving at The O2 in London on April 22 and 23. </p>
      <p>Two and a half years on from his debut solo record, the singer will be promoting his upcoming 12-track album ‘Fine Line’. He'll be supported by King Princess in the UK and Ireland, Jenny Lewis in the US and Canada, and Koffee in Mexico.</p>
      <p>Talking to <i>Rolling Stone</i> in August, Styles said ‘Fine Line’ is about ‘having sex and feeling sad.’ <a href="https://www.timeout.com/london/museums/tim-walker-wonderful-things-review">Tim Walker</a> has shot his album cover, and there’s already speculation about a <a href="https://www.timeout.com/london/blog/11-ways-to-stay-green-at-glastonbury-festival-062017">Glastonbury</a> set. Brace yourselves, H2 is full speed ahead. </p>
