      <h1>The Apprentice's Lottie Lion backs calls to get her on I'm a Celebrity 2020</h1>
      <h2>Fans have been pleading for her to enter the jungle</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T11:10:05+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 11:10</time> by <a rel="author">Jess Morcom</a></address>
      <p>She's still going strong as a candidate in this year's series of The Apprentice, and already fans are calling for Lottie Lion to star in I'm A Celebrity.. Get Me Out Of Here next year.</p>
      <p>Lottie, from Devon, has been acknowledging a series of tweets written by fans calling for her to star in the next season of the jungle favourite, which returns to our screens on November 17.</p>
      <p>The 19-year-old who was involved <a href="https://www.devonlive.com/news/devon-news/lottie-lion-race-row-apprentice-3423527">in a racism row</a> earlier on in the series, has been retweeting some of the pleas from fans for her to go into the jungle, but is so far yet to directly air her views on the proposal.</p>

      <p>One fan tweeted: "Lottie needs to be on I'm A Celeb next year"</p>
      <p>When the tweet received a few likes, the user wrote "Looks like people want you in there @LottieLion1 #junglelion."</p>
      <p>While another added: "Yes, Lottie in the jungle would be brill."</p>

      <p>Last week, Lottie came under fire in the boardroom when she told Lord Sugar: "I am not here to get on with everybody, I am here to be successful."</p>
      <p>When other candidates pointed out that Lottie was difficult to work with, she admitted: "Lord Sugar, I am not naive to the fact that I do not get on with everybody. That is not my aim, my aim is to be successful."</p>
      <p>However, the controversial candidate took to Twitter following Wednesday night's episode to admit she was 'fed up' with the editing team, claiming that show bosses cut out the other half of the statement she was making at the time.</p>
      <p>She tweeted: ‘”My aim is not to get everyone, but to win a business investment”, but I guess the editing team didn’t like the second half of my comment. I’m getting fed up with this."</p>
