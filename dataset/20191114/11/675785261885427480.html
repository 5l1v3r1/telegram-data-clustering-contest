      <h2>Timo Werner has been linked with a transfer move to Man Utd or Liverpool - and RB Leipzig boss Julian Nagelsmann says they will not stop him leaving for bigger things</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T11:54:42+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 11:54</time> by <a rel="author">Rich Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/rich-jones/</a></address>
      <p>RB Leipzig boss Julian Nagelsmann has opened the door for Timo Werner to leave the club - by stating they will not stand in his way if a bigger club comes calling.</p>
      <p>Werner has been attracting plenty of interest as a result of an impressive record of 76 goals in just 130 Bundesliga games.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old is considered one of the top talents in Europe with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> , <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> and domestic rivals Bayern Munich all linked with a move.</p>
      <p>And Nagelsmann has poured fuel on speculation he could be set for an exit by declaring they will not block an exit if he gets the right offer in January.</p>
      <p>"I’ve already advised many players to take off their wedding ring with their current club to move somewhere else," said Nagelsmann.</p>
      <p>"I’d do the same with Timo Werner if he were developing faster than the team at RB Leipzig."</p>

      <p>Werner inked a new deal at Leipzig at the summer, but that includes a release clause.</p>
      <p>Some reports in Germany have claimed that clause is as low as £27m, but others suggest it is over £50m and designed to reduce year upon year as he gets deeper into his four-year contract.</p>
      <p>Sporting director Markus Krosche did address transfer speculation, however, and warned United and Liverpool they do not intend to sell.</p>

      <p>Krosche told <a href="https://www.bild.de/">Bild</a> : "Timo just extended his contract with us recently, and we're not thinking about letting him go at all."</p>
      <p>United are known to be considering attacking options after struggling for goals so far this season with Erling Braut Haaland and Mario Mandzukic amongst those also linked with moves.</p>
      <p>But Klopp could bring in Werner as an addition to their powerful front three to add an extra dimension plus more squad depth with a hectic schedule coming up.</p>
