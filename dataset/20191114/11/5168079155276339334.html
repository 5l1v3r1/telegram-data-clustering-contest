      <p><b>Muscat: </b>Royal Oman Police has denied an international media report regarding the country’s e-visa regulations. In a statement issued on Thursday, ROP has confirmed that it did not change the visa procedures. <br/><br/>In a statement issued online ROP said: “ROP has observed an article published in one of the English newspaper in a neighboring country addressing some changes in the Omani entry visas.”<br/><br/>“Royal Oman Police reiterates that there has been no change in the current procedures and granting Omani visas remains same. Tourists wishing to visit Oman may still obtain a visa on arrival at all the Oman border posts but are urged to rather obtain an E-visa in advance to save both time and money. You can apply and find all the visa conditions in : <br/><br/><a href="https://evisa.rop.gov.om/"><b>https://evisa.rop.gov.om</b></a> and <a href="http://www.rop.gov.om/arabic/index.html"><b>www.rop.gov.om</b></a>.”</p>
