      <h1>Celine Dion Reveals What She Misses Most About Her Late Husband: ‘Everything’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T11:33:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 11:33</time> by <a rel="author">Brent Furdyk</a></address>
      <p>Celine Dion sat down with Gayle King for <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/celine-dion-courage-behind-the-scenes-of-first-north-american-tour-in-over-a-decade/">an interview</a> on Thursday morning’s “CBS This Morning”</p>
      <p>Dion, 51, opened up about the passing of her beloved husband Rene Angelil and what she misses most about him.</p>
      <p>“Oh, everything. His smell. His touch. His way of making me laugh,” Dion shared. “Yeah. It’s like, when I’m not on stage and my fans are home and I go in a hotel, for example, I don’t have any pillow talk.”</p>
      <p>The iconic Canadian singer also dished on the impending release of her 12th English-language studio album <i>Courage</i> (out Nov. 15).</p>
      <p>“I’ve been so much involved, not only in my album but into the production of this show,” she explained. “I say what I like, I have ideas. They can be tacky, wrong. I’m not asking to be right. I’m just asking to be heard.”</p>
      <p>Her favourite song on the project is the titular song “Courage”.</p>
      <p>“When I look back, my family went through a lot. Losing my husband, my manager, the father of my kids, my friend,” Dion said. “I feel his vibration and his support.”</p>
      <p>“I had to prove myself that I could do it,” she added. “I needed to prove to my family, my friends, the business people, the industry, the fans… that I can sing and continue on and not have only a hit, but a career.”</p>
      <p>Yesterday, “CBS This Morning” put out a short teaser. In the brief video, the Quebec-born chanteuse plays “Lightning Round”, with King serving up rapid-fire questions that Dion must quickly lob back like tennis balls.</p>
      <p>Among the revelations: she’s not much of a TV binge-watcher, but she does enjoy “Young Sheldon”, while she and her kids enjoy films such as “Monsters Inc.” and “Chitty Chitty Bang Bang”.</p>

      <p>When King asks Dion to name her favourite meal, things take a bit of a weird turn. At first, she can’t single out any one thing before finally settling on one odd item.</p>
      <p>“I love peanut butter so bad,” she admits, launching into a very fast version of the “Peanut Butter Jelly” song.</p>
      <p>In addition to peanut butter, she also enjoys “baba ghanoush, hummus and Lebanese food,” although hopefully without any added peanut butter.</p>

      <p>Dion also opens up about returning to the road for her first tour in more than a decade, telling King, “Every time you do it, you have to do it like it’s the first time.”</p>
