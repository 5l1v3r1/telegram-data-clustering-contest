      <p>From drowning to being buried alive, some of the creepiest dreams we have may have a much less sinister reason behind them.</p>
      <p>Here are 10 of the most common dreams and what you should learn from them, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/ten-terrifying-dreams-expert-says-20876315?_ga=2.102754947.300210913.1573647509-737870170.1571660793">according to The Mirror.</a></p>

      <p>
        <b>Submerged in water</b>
      </p>
      <p>Having dreams that you are drowning is a clear sign that you are letting your feelings make decisions for you in your waking life. Your mind is encouraging you to manage your emotions better.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Home</b>
      </p>
      <p>Having dreams about your dream house being damaged or destroyed suggests that you are not taking care of yourself, and your emotional health is at risk. Dreams about discovering new spaces in your home or home improvements could mean that some aspect of your waking life is improving.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Plane, train or car crashes</b>
      </p>
      <p>If you find yourself dreaming about an out--of-control car or vehicle, this suggests that events in your waking life are in danger of getting out of control.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Natural disasters</b>
      </p>
      <p>These frightening dreams can signal personal problems raging out of control. Your dreaming mind no longer wants you to ignore them.</p>

        <figcaption>Dreaming of a natural disaster is one of the most common dreams</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        <b>Death or illness</b>
      </p>
      <p>Dreams in which you are dead or dying can symbolise your desire to escape the responsibilities and burdens of life. In dreams where death is accidental, it can suggest that part of your life isn’t functioning and you need to make some changes.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Buried alive</b>
      </p>
      <p>Creepy dreams of being buried alive can signal confusion of conflict in your life. You urgently need to find a way to escape restrictions and get a new perspective. If you can’t do it alone, you need to get help from others.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Paralysed</b>
      </p>
      <p>Being paralysed in a dream can suggest that you are feeling stifled from taking on too much responsibility. Sometimes you have to make a decision to move forward, even if that decision isn’t the perfect one. Being stuck in mud in a dream indicated feeling stuck in some way in your life and needing to break free.</p>

        <figcaption>Expert Theresa Cheung has listed some of the most common dreams and what they mean</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        <b>Bereavement</b>
      </p>
      <p>Dreaming of loved ones who have died is very common and can be comforting for people who are grieving. These dreams may suggest that life is not all there is, and death may not be the end.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Superhero</b>
      </p>
      <p>Having dreams of being a superhero or being able to fly show that there is more to you than you realise. This suggests that you need to be bold and believe in your unique qualities.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Recurring dreams</b>
      </p>
      <p>Having the same dream over and over should never be ignored. Your mind is trying to tell you something for personal growth. These dreams will continue until you have fully understood the message behind the dream.</p>
