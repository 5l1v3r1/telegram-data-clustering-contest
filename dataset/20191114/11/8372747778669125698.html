      <p>A student gunman opened fire at a southern California high school Thursday morning, leaving two dead and several others injured, officials said.</p>
      <p>According to authorities, the male suspect, who is a student at the school, opened fire in the quad at Saugus High School in Santa Clarita around 7:38 a.m. before classes started. Authorities were on scene by 7:40 a.m. after receiving several 911 calls about the shooting.</p>
      <p>The suspected gunman shot and killed two students, a 16-year-old female a 14-year-old male, and injured three others before shooting himself in the head, police said. He is currently in custody and being treated at a local hospital, according to Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva. Officials say he is in grave condition.</p>
      <p>Video obtained at the scene showed the suspect taking a .45-caliber semi-automatic pistol from a backpack before shooting the five other students and then himself, said Capt. Kent Wegener of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.</p>
      <p>The other victims include two females, ages 14 and 15, and a 14-year-old male, police said. They were transported to local hospitals with gunshot wounds.</p>
      <p>Police are investigating the alleged shooter's home, which is near the school, authorities said at a press conference. Officials also said that Thursday was the student gunman's 16th birthday.</p>
      <p>The suspected shooter's mother and girlfriend are being interviewed by detectives. Other student witnesses are also still providing information to police.</p>
      <p>Other schools in the district were placed on lockdown amid the shooting.</p>
      <p>Police say they still don't have a motive in the shooting.</p>
