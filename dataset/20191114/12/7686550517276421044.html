      <h2>Jason Matthews has been described as a "cheeky chappy" with a big heart</h2>

      <p>A woman faces missing her brother's funeral after he died in a hospital hundreds of miles away.</p>
      <p>Jason Matthews, 48, died on October 31, in Birmingham Hospital after suffering complications from a blood clot in the brain.</p>
      <p>Tributes paid to Mr Matthews, from Trecynydd, <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/caerphilly">Caerphilly</a> , but who lived in <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/ebbw-vale">Ebbw Vale,</a> have described a "cheeky chappy" with a "caring heart".</p>
      <p>But his sister, and last remaining relative, faces missing his cremation after being unable to afford to make the journey to be by his side.</p>
      <p>Tracy Matthews, 49, said: "I haven't got the money for a funeral."</p>
      <p>"I have got illnesses so I can't work. It's been absolutely dreadful, I didn't expect to bury my younger brother.</p>
      <p>"There's only one year between us, I never thought I would have to be the one to bury him."</p>
      <p>Ms Matthews said her brother was transferred from Hereford Hospital to Birmingham after attempting to take his own life.</p>
      <p>After his death, a fundraising page was created to help Tracy, who lives in Cornwall, pay £400 for her brother's body to be transported privately back to south Wales.</p>
      <p>But now she has been told Mr Matthews may have to be cremated in Birmingham after struggling to meet her target.</p>
      <p>She said: "Jason has been gone two weeks and the hospital have said they can't keep him any longer so I will have to have him cremated.</p>
      <p>"I don't want him to be cremated in Birmingham but I think it will be out of my hands. I can understand where the hospital is coming from, they can only keep him for so long.</p>
      <p>"There are two lots of paperwork which is £164, and then there's the funeral director's costs and petrol on top so I get the cost [of taking him home].</p>
      <p>"I asked if the NHS could get him back to Wales so I could arrange for close friends to pick him up until I got there but they couldn't.</p>
      <p>"I'm shaking thinking about it. I'm not thinking of anything except him, it's constantly on my mind the thought of him being there."</p>

      <p>A fundraising page set up after Mr Matthew's death will now be used to help Ms Matthew travel from Cornwall to Birmingham to collect his ashes.</p>
      <p>She hopes to take his ashes back to Wales to allow him to be laid to rest near their parents.</p>
      <p>Ms Matthews said: "I want to get him back to Wales.</p>
      <p>"He's a Welsh boy, born in <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/cardiff">Cardiff</a> , and he needs to come back. Our parents and our older brother are buried in Caerphilly."</p>
      <p>She added: "I'm on bed rest but I have to do this for him.</p>
      <p>"I'm trying to get the travel costs for him. I've got to travel from Cornwall to Birmingham and take him back again. Then I want to make arrangements with close friends and people I know to do something in Caerphilly.</p>
      <p>"I would like a memorial, even if it's he just goes next to our parent's grave.</p>
      <p>"I don't travel back and for to Wales as it is because of my illness but money stops me as well. When Jason was in Birmingham I had to make the hard decision to say I couldn't go up [after he died]. It was really horrific that I couldn't get up there."</p>
      <p>Paying tribute to Mr Matthews, who had suffered from a stroke three years ago, Ms Matthews said: "Jason was well known in Caerphilly. He was very, very funny.</p>
      <p>"If he could help someone, he would held them. He had a caring heart.</p>
      <p>"For the last few years he was quite disabled - he was in a wheelchair and he lost the use of his left arm.</p>
      <p>"He struggled but he was quite independent. He tried to do everything himself but he couldn't take it any more."</p>
      <p>In a JustGiving page, Rhiannon Cornwall said: "Jason was 48 and had lived in Ebbw Vale for a good few years but was a Trecenydd/Caerphilly Boy.</p>
      <p>"He is fondly remembered by those who knew him as a cheeky chappy who would help anyone if he could. He was a caring man with a wicked sense of humour.</p>
      <p>"Please help get him home where he belongs."</p>
      <p>She added: "I went to school with Jason. He was a character always getting into scrapes, he had a great sense of humour and he was a sensitive, caring boy too.</p>
      <p>"He had a lot of time for people. I had no idea he had the stroke, or was in such a dark place, I wish I had known so I could of been there for him.</p>
      <p>"I’ll always remember him fondly."</p>
