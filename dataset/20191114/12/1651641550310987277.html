      <h1>Here’s where you can get the new folding Motorola Razr in UK</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T12:22:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 12:22</time> by <a rel="author">Surur</a></address>
      <p>Many of our readers would have woken up today to the news that there is a new Motorola Razr and that <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/motorola-razr-officially-announced-will-be-available-for-1500-from-verizon/">it is exclusive to Verizon</a>.</p>
      <p>For our European readers, this would have been rather unhelpful, and the good news is that the handset will, in fact, be coming to UK.</p>
      <p>UK’s largest network, EE, has announced that the handset will be hitting their shelves in the near future.</p>
      <p>The new Razr is constructed of premium stainless steel and 3D Gorilla Glass, and features a dark design which emphasizes its sleek lines.</p>
      <p>It features a zero-gap hinge that allows both sides of the customized polymer flexible display system to remain perfectly flush when closed and protects the display from debris and dust; and a re-engineered antenna’s to fit in a space twice as small as today’s smartphones; and is, therefore, water-resistant and splash-proof.</p>
      <p>Inside is a 6.2-inch Flex View display with 21:9 aspect ratio which folds up to fit in your pocket easily.</p>
      <p>On the outside is an external 2.7-inch interactive Quick View display which provides only the important information on the go, making it easy to stay connected while remaining present in the moment. You can make calls, reply to messages, pay with a tap, control your music, take selfies, use Google assistant and access customized settings, like turning on or off Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, your Hotspot and more, all without ever opening your phone.</p>

      <p>Sharon Meadows, Director of Devices, Partnerships &amp; Business Development, at EE “As the UK’s number one network, we always look to provide customers with the latest technology and experiences – whether that’s the fastest speeds, or ground-breaking smartphones. By partnering with Motorola on the new razr, our customers will get exclusive access to what already promises to be an iconic new smartphone. Only on EE will customers get the most out of the new razr with the UK’s best network, best in class unlimited plans and great swappable benefits.”</p>
      <p>In the USA the handset will arrive in January and cost $1500. Potential punters can register their interest<a href="https://ee.co.uk/motorola-razr"> at EE here</a> with final UK pricing and availability still to be announced.</p>
