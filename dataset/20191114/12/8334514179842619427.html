      <p>LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was not complacent about the outcome of the Dec. 12 election, because any vote for smaller parties could strip him of a majority and lead to a Labour-led coalition in power.</p>
      <p>Johnson’s Conservatives are comfortably ahead of Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour in the polls but analysts have warned that Brexit, which has divided parties and their voters, could make the result highly unpredictable.</p>
      <p>“We’re not complacent about any outcome,” Johnson told reporters in southwest England.</p>
      <p>“The real risk is that if people vote for the Liberal Democrats, or indeed any other party, you get a coalition led by Jeremy Corbyn in Number 10.”</p>
