      <p><b>…And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead</b> are back with their 10th album (and first in six years), <i><a href="https://orcd.co/godlessvoid">X: The Godless Void and Other Stories</a>,</i> which will be out January 17 via Dine Alone Records. The record was made after frontman Conrad Keely returned from a five-year stay in Cambodia. “I feel like I’m writing pop music,” Keely says, “it’s just not Top 20 pop. It’s the pop music I wish was on the radio, the pop music I would’ve grown up with.” The first single, “Don’t Look Down,” is indeed pretty poppy and Keely directed, edited and produced its rotoscope-animation-style video. Watch that below.</p>
      <p>Trail of Dead, who <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/trail-of-dead-playing-madonna-at-bv-sxsw-show-w-charly-bliss-ringo-deathstarr-more/">celebrated the 20th anniversary of <i>Madonna</i></a> this year, have also announced 2020 tour dates that don’t really go further east than Texas, but include stops in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Vancouver, Seattle, Portland, Santa Cruz, Fresno, Las Vegas, Tucson, and El Paso. All dates are listed below.</p>
