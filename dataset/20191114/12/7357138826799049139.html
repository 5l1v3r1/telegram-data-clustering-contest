      <h1>Policymakers Press Big Tech On Use Of Personal Data</h1>

      <p>Big Tech is under siege about its failure to respect users’ privacy as the House Judiciary Committee’s antitrust subcommittee expressed frustration over the companies’ many acquisitions, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-antitrust-congress-idUSKBN1XN2WY">Reuters</a> reported on Wednesday (Nov. 13).</p>
      <p>Antitrust enforcers are probing tech behemoths Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple.</p>
      <p>At a hearing of the antitrust subcommittee on Wednesday, head Makan Delrahim said they were focusing on how personalized advertising transactions work. </p>
      <p>“By understanding these competitive dynamics, we can understand how the market leaders have monopoly power, how they exercise that monopoly power and whether the source of that power is for merit-based competition or the source of that power is exclusionary,” Delrahim said.</p>
      <p>Similar inquiries are also underway at the Justice Department and by the attorneys general of dozens of states. </p>
      <p>The Justice Department and the committee are looking into all four companies while the FTC is investigating Facebook and Amazon. State attorneys general are probing Google and Facebook.</p>
      <p>“We continue to coordinate with the state AGs on both of the matters that have been made public,” said Delrahim.</p>
      <p>Subcommittee Rep. David Cicilline specifically pointed at Google about its continuous acquisitions — like the recent Fitbit and Looker — amid antitrust investigations.</p>
      <p>“The hubris of the executive team to pursue an acquisition of this size,” he said, referring to its $2.1 billion bid for Fitbit, “while under federal and state antitrust investigations is astonishing.”</p>
      <p>Several watchdog groups asked the FTC on Wednesday to block the deal.</p>
      <p>“Google knows more about us than any other company, and it should not be allowed to add yet another way to track our every move,” they said in a letter.</p>
      <p>GOP subcommittee member Rep. Doug Collinson warned against punishing success.</p>
      <p>“Companies that offer new innovations, better solutions and more consumer benefits at lower prices often become big — to the benefit of society. Proposals to break up big companies because of their size alone risk throwing the baby out with the bathwater,” he said.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.pymnts.com/antitrust/2019/house-to-unveil-big-tech-antitrust-probe-findings-early-next-year/">Cicilline said</a> last month that he anticipates having a final report in early 2020 about big technology companies and any breaches of antitrust law.</p>
