        <figcaption>How do I vote in the December 2019 general election?</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>There have been periods in British history when <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/general-election">general election</a> results were predicated.</p>
      <p>For example, in the late 1990s and early 2000s, it was clear that Labour was more popular than the Conservatives - while in the 1980s, the Tories were clearly ahead.</p>
      <p>But not any more. We're in a period now where politics is very unpredictable.</p>
      <p>That's partly because of <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/brexit">Brexit</a> , which might affect how people vote.</p>
      <p>It's also because smaller parties like the Brexit Party, the Green Party and the SNP have done well in recent elections. And both Labour and the Conservatives - but Labour most of all - have been through radical changes in recent years.</p>
      <p>Despite all that, it's still possible to make a guess about what might happen in this election.</p>
      <h3>Opinion polls show the Conservatives are in the lead</h3>
      <p>Recent opinion polls all show that the Conservatives are more popular than Labour.</p>
      <p>A poll by YouGov found 39% of voters plan to back the Conservatives, with 26% supporting Labour.</p>
      <p>A poll by Opinium found 41% backing the Conservatives and 29% supporting Labour.</p>
      <p>A Deltapoll survey also found 41% backing the Conservatives and 29% backing Labour.</p>
      <p>As we all know, the only poll that matters is the actual vote on December 12.</p>
      <p>But until then, these opinion polls are the only real measure of what the public is thinking.</p>
      <h3>Reasons why the Conservatives might win</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Boris Johnson might be more popular with voters than Theresa May, the last Conservative leader</li>
        <li>His promise to "get Brexit done" might appeal to people who support Brexit, and to people who don't really support Brexit but think we have to leave the EU and should get it over with</li>
        <li>He's abandoned austerity. Mr Johnson doesn't talk about cutting spending, he talks about spending more on police, schools and the NHS.</li>
        <li>Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, appears to be unpopular with some votes</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Reasons why Labour might win</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Mr Johnson is unpopular with some voters, and Labour is trying to convince voters that he's done a secret deal to sell the NHS to Donald Trump</li>
        <li>Labour is offering a second referendum on Brexit. If you want to stop Brexit then getting a Labour Government is probably your best hope of doing so</li>
        <li>The Conservatives have been in power for more than nine years and you can argue that some things have got worse. For example, there are fewer police officers, council services have been cut and more people are forced to use food banks</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Labour has moved to the left under Mr Corbyn and for some voters, that's exactly what they want. Labour's plans to introduce a four-day week and for the Government to own 10% of the shares in larger businesses may prove to be popular</li>
        <li>Labour probably doesn't need to get a majority of the seats in order to form the next Government (and the real definition of "winning " an election is being in power once it is over). In a hung Parliament, smaller parties such as the SNP and Liberal Democrats can help decide who forms a Government. Even if they don't do an official deal with Labour, they are likely to prevent Mr Johnson becoming Prime Minister if they possibly can, because they don't support Brexit. The SNP also wants a second Scottish independence referendum, which the Conservatives would block.</li>
      </ul>
