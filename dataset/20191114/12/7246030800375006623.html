      <h1>As Expected, Rockets Launched at Israel After Ceasefire Commences, PRC Takes Credit</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T12:17:51+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 12:17</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.jewishpress.com/author/newsbriefs/" target="_blank">Jewish Press News Desk</a></address>
      <p>Despite the commencement of the ceasefire at 5:30 AM on Thursday morning, rockets were launched at Israel multiple times.</p>
      <p>Rockets were first launched at Israelâ€™s south around 6 am and then at 7 am, with Iron Dome interceptions each time.</p>
      <p>Then there was a heavy barrage towards the Netivot area just before 11 am. 5 rockets were launched at Israel, 2 were intercepted by Iron Dome, and 3 fell in open areas.</p>
      <p>The IDF has not yet responded to the attacks.</p>
      <p>The Al-Nasser Salach Al-Deen brigade of the Popular Resistance Committee (PRC) terrorist organization in northern Gaza took credit for the attack.</p>
      <p>The PRC is the third strongest terrorist group in Gaza, after Hamas and Islamic Jihad.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the joke floating around Israel is that Islamic Jihad forgot to turn off the Shabbos clock that they had attached to the missile launchers the day before.</p>
