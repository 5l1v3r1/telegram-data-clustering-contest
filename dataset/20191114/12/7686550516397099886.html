      <h2>The creature could have given him a nasty bite</h2>

      <p>A brave engineer saved a snake at a sewage works by picking it up with his hands - not realising it was a venomous false cobra</p>
      <p>The Thames Water worker rescued the three-foot-long snake after it was spotted slowly slithering along a path at the site, without realising it packed a venomous bite.</p>
      <p>RSPCA inspectors were stunned when they arrived at Basingstoke Sewage Works, in Hamps., to pick up the serpent, because they expected it to be a completely harmless breed.</p>
      <p>They are named after their ability to flatten their neck to appear bigger, to take on the appearance of a deadly cobra.</p>
      <p>The fearsome snake was spotted as workers carried out an inspection at the site on November 7.</p>
      <p>Experts reckon the South American snakes are aggressive venomous predators, that can grow up to ten feet long, on a diet of animals as big as rats and birds.</p>

      <p>Sewage works manager Kenny Masters said: "We see some weird and wonderful things thanks to some of the bizarre objects that end up in the sewers - but a metre-long cobra slithering across the footpath in front of us is definitely up there.</p>
      <p>"We don’t think it was flushed down a toilet as there's no way it would have survived.</p>
      <p>"Our machinery which filters out everything other than pee, poo and paper would have killed it.</p>
      <p>"I can only fathom it was released or escaped.</p>
      <p>“My technician who grabbed it is not especially fearful of snakes and just walked up, grabbed it by the head and said ‘what do you want me to do with it?'</p>
      <p>"Casual as you like. Fair play to him, no one else was going near it."</p>
      <p>RSPCA animal welfare officer Justine Hermon said: “When the call came through, we were expecting it to be a common species such as a grass snake or a pet corn snake.</p>

      <p>“As an exotic animal specialist, my colleague Phil Hamilton attended the incident and when he arrived at the sewage plant he saw straight away this was a more unusual type of snake.</p>
      <p>"He took one look at the animal and spotted the ‘hood’ on its neck, identifying it to be a false water cobra, a snake which originally comes from South America and is reported to be mildly venomous.</p>
      <p>“We have now taken the snake to a nearby specialist facility where it will be cared for it until its owner can be tracked down or it can be rehomed.</p>
      <p>"Thankfully, it is in good condition and is eating well.</p>
      <p>"We’re grateful to the Thames Water staff who found the snake and got in touch as this snake would not have fared well in the cold weather.</p>
      <p>“It is possible this snake escaped from a property in the local area, in which case someone will be missing their beloved pet."</p>
