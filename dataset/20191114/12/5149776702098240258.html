      <h2>Just show your car keys at the bar</h2>

      <p>There has to be some perks for being the designated driver over the festive period. No hangover the next day is one - and free drinks is another.</p>
      <p>One of the country's leading pub chains is taking part in the annual Christmas anti-drink drive campaign with Coca-Cola for the tenth year in a row and this year has partnered with Heineken too.</p>
      <p>Greene King pubs, Hungry Horse, Chef &amp; Brewer and Farmhouse Inns will be taking part in the promotion which runs until last orders on January 1, 2020.</p>
      <p>Drivers will receive a voucher to use on their next purchase when they show their car keys at the bar and buy any 330ml bottles of Coca-Cola Original Taste, Diet Coke, Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, Heineken 0.0 or 275ml bottles of Appletiser.</p>
      <p>According to the Department for Transport, the estimated number of reported drink drive related accidents in Great Britain since 1979, has fallen by 71 per cent with recent figures of 5,700 compared to 19,470 almost 30 years ago.</p>

      <p>Phil Thomas, Greene King’s chief commercial officer, said: “As a leading pub company, we have an important role to play in helping to promote responsible drinking and we have given away around a quarter of a million free <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/whats-on/whats-on-news/coca-cola-christmas-truck-dates-3528481https://www.nottinghampost.com/whats-on/whats-on-news/coca-cola-christmas-truck-dates-3528481">Coca Cola </a>products over the past decade as part of the Designated Driver campaign.</p>
      <p>“We have seen a huge increase in the popularity of low and no-alcohol products in our pubs. Our range now offers more than 10 different low and no-alcohol products including beers, wines and ciders, so we are really excited to add Heineken 0.0 to our Designated Driver offering as we celebrate this significant milestone of the campaign.”</p>
