      <p>MAYO Senator Rose Conway-Walsh has again raised concerns with Health Minister Simon Harris about the agonising delays in administering Sprinraza for SMA patients.</p>
      <p>We now have a situation in Mayo when one child, Grace O’Malley from Hollymount, continues to be denied the treatment which was approved back in June.</p>
      <p>This, she said, is not acceptable.</p>
      <p>Speaking after raising the issue in the Seanad, Senator Conway-Walsh said: “Minister Simon Harris has assured me that the HSE is now in discussions with the three hospitals involved - Crumlin, Temple Street and Tallaght - with regard to arranging a schedule so that the administration of Spinraza can be performed for a number of patients across the three hospitals.</p>
      <p>“However, it appears that the resources are not being made available for some of the children, including Grace.</p>
      <p>“This is a inhumane situation I will not tolerate. Grace and her family were to the forefront of the long but successful campaign to have Sprinraza approved.</p>
      <p>“Now, they are once again thrown into despair. Minister Harris must ensure this situation is rectified without further delay.”</p>
