      <p>Nov. 14 (UPI) -- <i>The West Wing</i>,<i> Psych</i> and<i> Suits</i> alum Dule Hill will be heard as the character Mr. Manny in Friday's episode of Disney Junior's animated series <i>Muppet Babies</i>.</p>
      <p>Mr. Manny fills in for Miss Nanny -- the care-taker of toddler versions of Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy, Fozzie, Gonzo, Summer Penguin and Animal -- when she leaves the playroom to run an errand.</p>
      <p>Jenny Slate regularly voices the character of Miss Nanny, but is only seen from the waist-down.</p>
      <p>Disney released a photo showing Mr. Manny will be depicted in a similar fashion, with only his blue pants, purple, long-sleeved shirt, Argyle sweater vest, necktie and hands visible.</p>
      <p>The titular creatures are all sitting attentively at a table and looking up at Mr. Manny in the image.</p>
      <p>A trailer shows the Muppets greeting their new babysitter at the door and appearing surprised he is a man. Only his hands, sweater, pants, green-and-white, striped socks and wing-tip shoes can be seen.</p>
      <p>The show is a reboot of a popular cartoon that ran 1984-91. The new version debuted in 2018.</p>
