        <b>Syneos Health, an integrated biopharmaceutical solutions organisation, has partnered with AiCure for smarter clinical trials that optimise patient engagement. </b>
      </p>
      <p>AiCure is an artificial intelligence and data analytics company, which offers proprietary intelligent software and AI-driven insights.</p>
      <p>The partnership will see AiCure leverage Syneos’ behavioural insights-driven product development model, with the aim to capture, analyse and predict patient behaviours influencing clinical trial adherence.</p>
      <p>“The AiCure platform aligns with our unique product developmet model that harnesses behavioural insights to unlock real world experiences,” said Alistair Macdonald, chief executive officer of Syneos Health.</p>
      <p>“By deploying the AiCure platform to our investigative sites, we create insights-enriched patient communities to advance clinical research,” he added.</p>
      <p>Syneos Health will have access to AiCure’s digital biomarker assessments, evaluating facial, verbal, speech and movement variables to objectively study known clinical endpoints.</p>
      <p>The platform identifies adherence patterns and variations in site and participant engagement, providing the opportunity to modify behaviours that increase compliance for the improvement of overall trial success.</p>
      <p>Part of this includes providing patients with a smartphone application to guide and confirm proper administration in real-time – as opposed to self-reporting measures.</p>
      <p>“Syneos Health’s scale as a leading global CRO, and the largest contract commercial organisation, will enable valuable customer engagements and expands our reach with biopharmaceutical companies of all sizes,” said Adam Hanina, chief executive officer of AiCure</p>
