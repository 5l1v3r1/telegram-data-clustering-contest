      <p>A <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/gateshead">Gateshead</a> pub remains open after its licence was revoked as pub bosses plan their next move.</p>
      <p>The Bluebell was stripped of its premises licence last Monday, after Northumbria Police demanded a review following a string of allegations which raised concerns about its management.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/gateshead-council">Gateshead Council </a>confirmed that after a premises loses its licence, its owners legally have 21 days to lodge an appeal, which will then be heard by a magistrates' court. In the meantime it can stay open.</p>
      <p>This came some eight months after Trading Standards Officers seized 220 counterfeit Superkings and Richmond cigarettes and three pouches of tobacco at the Felling pub following a tip-off.</p>
      <p>Manager Julie Simpson insisted they were for her own "personal use".</p>
      <p>Now, bosses at Admiral Taverns, the firm which owns the Victoria Square venue say they are considering an appeal and the premises remains open.</p>
      <p>"We’re disappointed with the decision which has been made concerning the Blue Bell and are considering an appeal against the revoking of the licence," said a spokesperson for the pub company.</p>
      <p>"In the meantime, we’d advise our locals that it is very much business as usual at the pub and hope to see all the regulars there."</p>
      <p>An alleged unprovoked assault at the premises late September last year caused a customer to lose five teeth, and police claimed that staff at the Bluebell didn’t call them, instead leaving it to an anonymous member of the public.</p>
      <p>The part of the pub the alleged attack happened in wasn’t covered by CCTV and the victim, fearing reprisals, refused to give a statement.</p>
      <p>There was also allegations that a woman was punched to the ground inside the pub, and that paramedics had to be called out to attend to another woman who had blood all over her face.</p>
      <p>However, the alleged incidents couldn’t be substantiated or investigated “due to a lack of evidence such as CCTV” and “cultural fear of repercussions”.</p>
      <p>A report heard by <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/gateshead-council">Gateshead Council </a>licensing committee revealed that Northumbria Police raised fears the venue was failing to meet multiple licensing objectives.</p>
      <p>Also blocked was a bid to transfer the designated premises supervisor to Miss Simpson's, daughter Tania Hope.</p>
