      <h2>Wait, what did he just say?</h2>

      <p>Smyths Toys has shocked TV viewers with what sounds like a foul-mouthed expletive in its Christmas advert.</p>
      <p>In the retailer's 2019 entry, a little boy called Oscar imagines he is performing for a crowd of toys as he sings on stage about his favourite things to play with.</p>
      <p>The song is an alternate version of If I Were A Boy by Beyonc√©, as Oscar sings: "If I were a toy, even just for a day.</p>

      <p>"I'd wear armour for pjyamas, and ride around on llamas all day.</p>
      <p>"Take monster truck rides, I'd steal the spotlight. Singing harmonies with Barbies..."</p>
      <p>As he acts out the lyrics, he is seen riding on an armoured car and a llama, before jumping from a monster truck and grabbing a microphone in front of a line of Barbies.</p>
      <p>Oscar then takes a blue megaphone called a Farting Big Blaster, holds it up to a smiling Pikachu plush and continues: "I'd master the fart blaster for sure."</p>

      <p>But on Twitter, viewers were left in stitches as they thought they heard Oscar say something completely different.</p>
      <p>A number of hysterical users thought Oscar said the word that starts with B and rhymes with dastard.</p>
      <p>The official Smyths Toys Twitter account tweeted the advert and wrote: "Our lovable Oscar returns where his imagination has made Smyths Toys his theatre, with a whole cast of iconic performers, from Barbie to Buzz and Woody!</p>

      <p>"See the magic of the toy store come to life through the eyes of a child!"</p>
      <p>One Twitter user said: "That Smyths Toys ad... sounds like he says fat [bleep] while he's singing along."</p>
      <p>Another wrote: "How did he 'master the fat [bleep]'?"</p>
      <aside>I'd master the fart blaster for sure.</aside>
      <p>A third put: "I've mastered the fat [bleep], [bleeping] rolling about in stitches here. Superb."</p>
      <p>Someone else wrote: "That's similar to what I hear. I hear murdered the fat [bleep]."</p>
      <p>"OMG I'm so sure that line went 'I've mastered that fat [bleep]'," laughed a fifth, adding: "... surely no."</p>

      <p>The Smyths ad is one of a number of Christmas adverts to have garnered mixed or negative reactions this year.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/viewers-criticise-boots-christmas-advert/">Boots' effort was branded "horrible" and "appalling"</a> for focusing too much on the commercial side of the festive season, while some viewers <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/viewers-call-sainsburys-christmas-advert-scary-and-dreary/">found Sainsbury's entry "dreary" and even a bit "scary"</a>.</p>
      <p>Of course, the king of Christmas ads, John Lewis, <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/john-lewis-unveils-its-christmas-advert-for-2019-and-its-left-fans-in-floods-of-tears/">had viewers in tears with its 2019 advert</a>, which centres on a fire-breathing dragon called Excitable Edgar and his best friend, a little girl called Ava.</p>
