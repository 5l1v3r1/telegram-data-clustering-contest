      <p>One of the biggest nights to celebrate Devon and Cornwall’s fantastic businesses is now just one week away.</p>
      <p>The Western Morning News Business Awards shines a light on the best of the South West, crowning the people and companies which make our region proud.</p>
      <p>This year, the glittering gala held at the Plymouth Pavilions on November 21 will also celebrate 160 years of the Western Morning News.</p>
      <p>Bill Martin, editor of the paper, said: “The Western Morning News has been part of the fabric of the Westcountry for 160 years – and in this age of change – I think this is something we should recognise and celebrate.</p>
