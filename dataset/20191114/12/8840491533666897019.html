      <p>MINISTER Michael Ring has today announced funding to enable the My Open Library service to be provided in Ballina Library.</p>
      <p>This will allow the public to access and use the services of the library on a self-service basis from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m., 365 days a year. Minister Ring has approved €138,750 to enable Ballina Library to provide the My Open Library service.</p>
      <p>The minister has also approved funding to provide Ballina and Swinford libraries with Magic Tables, which benefit people with alzheimers, autism and learning difficulties</p>
      <p>Minister Ring’s public libraries strategy aims to introduce the My Open Library service to 100 library branches around the country by 2022. The service is currently available in 15 public libraries with a further three, including Swinford, due to open before the end of the year.</p>
      <p>The My Open Library service offers extended opening hours to library members including:</p>
      <p>* Opening hours of 8 a.m. to 10 p.m., 365 days per year.</p>
      <p>* Automated access to the branch for library members via membership card and pin code during unstaffed hours.</p>
      <p>* Provision of self-service activities including, but not limited to issue and return of books and other library stock, internet access on PCs, use of wi-fi, printing and photocopying, study/reading spaces, and meeting facilities.</p>
      <p>Said the minister: “The My Open Library service has been an amazing success. It is an exciting development and is transforming our libraries. I am delighted to provide this funding which will enable Ballina Library to provide the service.</p>
      <p>“The My Open Library service extends the availability of library services to customers at times that suit them best, providing greater flexibility and convenience through increased opening hours in addition to the invaluable staffed hours. It has facilitated increased access for students to study from early in the morning to late at night; families with working parents; commuters; people up-skilling; and community groups to use the meeting room facilities.”</p>
      <p>Magic Tables, meanwhile, have been piloted across the country over the last year and have been a great success, he said. “These tables are being used by carers and people with alzheimers, autism and learning difficulties and I have seen first-hand the joy they bring to people using them.”</p>
      <p>The My Open Library service is available to library members aged 16 years and over (under 18 years with parental consent).</p>
