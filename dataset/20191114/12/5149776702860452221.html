      <h1>Fuel storage tanks brought down as demolition continues at Total site in Colwick</h1>
      <h2>The work is due for completion at the end of the year</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T12:26:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 12:26</time> by <a rel="author">Matthew Bunn</a></address>
      <p>Demolition work is progressing well at a major fuel storage site in Colwick, which could be used for storage and warehousing in the future.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/demolition-total-fuel-depot-could-2622160">The Total Petroleum centre</a> off Colwick Loop Road was once used to distribute fuel across the country, but a decommissioning process started in the summer.</p>
      <p>The site did include storage tanks - which are now being brought down - loading bays and a control room.</p>
      <p>It is anticipated the work will be completed by the end of the year and the <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/local-news/deals-likely-coming-weeks-take-3457248">area has been marketed by property agency Savills</a>.</p>
      <p>Offers have been made on the site, but while it is not yet known what will be put in the depot's place, suggestions have included warehousing.</p>
      <p>Last month, a Total spokesman said: "Whilst we are considering offers for our site in Nottingham, work to complete the decommissioning process is ongoing and this is due to be completed on schedule by the end of the year.‚Äù</p>
