      <p>Taiwanese smartphone maker HTC has just expanded its desire series of smartphones with the launch of the HTC Desire 19s. The desire 19s comes as the sequel to the desire 19+, while it is in fact a true successor to the HTC Desire 12s. The arrival of the desire 19s is again a true testament that the ailing firm isn’t yet giving up on the smartphone market. But whether or not the Desire 19s is innovative enough to turn around the company’s declining mobile sales is yet to be known.</p>
      <p>The device shares a similar design with the HTC<a href="https://www.livemint.com/"> Wildfire X</a> featuring a thin bezel design with a teardrop-shaped cutout at the top of the screen to accommodate the selfie camera thin. And on the flip side, it gets a trio of cameras, fitted in a rear panel with a textured bottom half and a glossy top.

      <p>Upfront, it comes fitted with a 6.2-inch IPS display with an HD+ resolution and 19:9 aspect ratio, and a water-drop notch that is home to a 16MP selfie cam.</p>
