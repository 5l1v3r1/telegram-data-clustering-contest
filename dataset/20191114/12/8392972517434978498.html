      <h1>Coronation Street viewers mock Michelle for not realising Robert's cheating</h1>
      <h2>When will the penny drop?!</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T12:23:56+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 12:23</time> by <a rel="author">Helen Fear</a></address>
      <p>Michelle Connor STILL hasn't twigged that her fiancé Robert Preston is cheating on her - and <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/">Coronation Street</a> viewers have accused her of being "clueless".</p>
      <p>On Wednesday (November 13), Robert dodged some tricky questions from Michelle... But, after months of <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/coronation-street-viewers-want-robert-preston-to-be-caught-out/">leading a double life</a>, lying comes easily to the chef.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Michelle has been edging closer to finding out the truth about fiancé Robert's double life ever since he was <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/coronation-street-spoilers-robert-rushed-to-hospital-after-horror-car-crash/">involved in a car accident</a>.</p>
      <p>Her suspicions were raised when Robert was admitted to a hospital in Macclesfield, when he was supposed to be in Sandbach.</p>
      <p>Then, when Michelle visited him after the crash, he began rambling about a baby and had a mysterious necklace spelling out 'big daddy' by his bed.</p>

      <p>After confiding in Carla about her suspicions, Michelle confronted Robert in hospital...</p>
      <aside>Michelle is having a great deal of trouble adding two and two together.</aside>
      <p>But, ever ready with a bottomless pit of excuses and lies, Robert told her 'big daddy' was the nickname the young offenders he works with gave him.</p>
      <p>For good measure, he told her he had been in Macclesfield taking one of them home.</p>

      <p>With both Michelle and Vicky visiting him at the hospital, Robert promptly decided to discharge himself - leaving Michelle with even more questions...</p>
      <p>As the mounds of evidence piled up, Bistro manager Michelle - played by actress <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/10-facts-about-coronation-streets-kym-marsh-the-actress-who-plays-michelle-connor/">Kym Marsh</a> - finally seems to be piecing it all together.</p>
      <p>But not fast enough for the viewers, who have mocked her for being so slow at working it all out!</p>

      <p>Another wrote: "Why is it that Michelle used to catch Steve McDonald out on every little dodge he tried, but Robert tells more lies than Donald Trump and she hasn't a clue?"</p>
      <p>A third added: "She really is gullible, love is blind LOL. Robert is getting on my nerves!!!"</p>
      <p>"I gave up on this storyline months ago," admitted one more. "Never has a character been made to look so unbelievably stupid as Michelle has. No one with half a brain would have not figured out Robert's double life ages ago. It's silly and truly boring."</p>
      <p>Many more <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/coronation-street-viewers-question-how-thick-michelle-is/">begged the storyline to end</a>, accusing the ITV soap of dragging it out for too long, and demanding <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/coronation-street-viewers-want-three-major-characters-to-die/">two-timing Robert is found out</a>.</p>
