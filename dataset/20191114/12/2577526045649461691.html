      <p>Pearl Abyss is best known for <i>Black Desert</i> – and its eye-popping character creation tool. Today in South Korea, the studio <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkdj1ixw8aI">just announced</a> three games. They all look visually impressive.</p>
      <p>At the G-Star gaming expo (via tipster Sang), Pearl Abyss announced the following games:</p>
      <h3>Plan 8</h3>

      <p>Pearl Abyss is aiming to release this open world “exosuit MMO shooter” on PC and consoles and revealed that developer Minh Le, better known as “Gooseman” from his <i>Counter Strike</i> days, joined the studio in March 2018.</p>
      <h3>DokeV</h3>

      <p>This is an open-world MMO for mobile. It looks cute!</p>
      <h3>Crimson Desert</h3>

      <p>Pearl Abyss describes this game as an “epic fantasy open world MMORPG.” Heading to PC and consoles, it apparently has a single player campaign with multiplayer elements. The game seems to be a prequel of sorts to <i>Black Desert</i>.</p>
      <p>At the end of Pearl Abyss’s G-Star presentation, there was a message that read “See you at E3.”</p>
