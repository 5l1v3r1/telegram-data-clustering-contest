      <h1>Will you be my bridesmaid? Can I meet Ant and Dec? Odd questions posed to Newcastle Travelodge staff</h1>
      <h2>One guest asked if Ant and Dec could 'pop into the hotel' to visit their gran.</h2>

      <p>A bride-to-be asked a member of staff at a Travelodge to be her bridesmaid - after falling out with her real friend ahead of the wedding.</p>
      <p>The drama unfolded at a <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-city-centre">Newcastle</a> branch of the budget hotel chain.</p>
      <p>It has come to light after Travelodge revealed a list of the weirdest requests made to staff in the last 12 months.</p>
      <p>One guest asked if Ant and Dec could "pop into the hotel" to visit their gran.</p>

      <p>Another asked if their room at the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-city-centre">Quayside branch</a> could be made to look like a tropical island for a Love Island-themed proposal.</p>
      <p>However, perhaps the most dramatic involved the wedding hiccup in which the bride-to-be asked: "I have fallen out with my bridesmaid, so can you take her place?"</p>
      <p>It isn't known if the request was fulfilled - or if the friends reconciled before the ceremony.</p>
      <p>However, Travelodge spokeswoman Shakila Ahmed said requests like these are becoming more and more common.</p>
      <p>“Annually we welcome around 19 million customers at our 570 hotels which include four properties in Newcastle," she said.</p>
      <p>"Our hotel teams receive thousands of interesting requests from business and leisure guests. </p>
      <p>"Where possible, our hotel teams will go above and beyond to help customers as they relish a good challenge.</p>
      <p>"However there are some requests beyond their control such as getting a raft of ducks to go to sleep, stopping the traffic on the M5, getting the Northern Lights to make an appearance and getting a herd of sheep as a sleep aid.”</p>
      <p>“Interestingly, over the last 12 months, our hotel teams have reported a rise in customer requests to help with wedding proposals. </p>
      <p>"Requests have included a customer asking for a unicorn pedal boat and for a rainbow to appear above the hotel at 16:16 for a wedding proposal at Thurrock Travelodge.</p>
      <p>"The team at Rhyl Travelodge were asked to set up a romantic candlelit dinner on Rhyl beach with a path of red rose petals from the hotel to the table.</p>
      <p>"At Leamington Spa Travelodge the hotel team were tasked to get a full moon outside the customer’s room window in order to create a moonlight setting.”</p>
      <p>And on <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-city-centre">Tyneside</a> , the requests were among the weirdest in the country.</p>
      <p>Guests asked:</p>
      <p>·         Can you turn my room into a tropical island, I want to propose to my boyfriend - he’s a massive fan of Love Island?</p>
      <p>·         I have fallen out with my bridesmaid, so can you take her place?</p>
      <p>·         Can you arrange for a pair of llamas to attend my wedding ceremony?</p>
      <p>·         Can you arrange for Ant and Dec to pop into the hotel this afternoon as my nan is a massive fan?</p>
      <p>·         Can I check my miniature Shetland Pony, Newkie Brown, into the hotel?</p>
      <p>·         Can you teach me to change a car tyre?</p>
      <p>·         Can you translate my presentation into Georgie as I want to impress my client? </p>
