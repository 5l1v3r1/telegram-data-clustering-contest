      <p>A police hunt has been launched to try find a woman who was filmed using her backside to crush and suffocate an inconsolable toddler.</p>
      <p>The clip, which has been circulating on social media, shows the woman sitting on a little girl's head to stop her crying.</p>
      <p>The child becomes more upset but the woman seems unconcerned as she wraps her legs around the youngster and sits forcefully on her back.</p>
      <p>Later, she turns the girl over and locks her movement with her legs.</p>
      <p>The video has been widely shared within the community of Corpus Christi, Texas, USA.</p>
      <p>Facebook has chosen to leave the disturbing clip online in the hope it helps police track the woman down.</p>
      <p>Corpus Christi Police Department shared the clip and stressed that the woman has an easily-identifiable tattoo on her left ankle.</p>

      <p>Following an investigation, they posted an update on Monday and found out the incident did not occur in Corpus Christi but in Nuevo Leon, Mexico.</p>
      <p>It read: "This video was posted on a local <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> group and ultimately found its way to us.</p>
      <p>"Since then we have actively attempted to identify the suspect, child, and location of the incident so that this incident can be addressed.</p>

      <p>"At this time all indications are that the incident did not occur in our jurisdiction and that it occurred in Nuevo Leon, Mexico.</p>
      <p>"We have also received information that this incident may have happened over a year ago."</p>
      <p>Officers are working to identify the exact location where the assault happened and they have contacted the Child Protection Services equivalent in Mexico to launch an investigation.</p>
      <p>They shared photos of suspected women with tattoos on their ankles to help the search.</p>
      <p>One said: "I can’t find the post but, on one of the links to this video it was shared from an older woman from Nuevo Leon and she is now living in Corpus!</p>
      <p>"Just wondering if anyone seen the link and if she could be related to the family?"</p>
      <p>Corpus Christi Police replied in the comment: "The female that shared the video was not the originator of the video and we did contact her that night and ruled her out."</p>
