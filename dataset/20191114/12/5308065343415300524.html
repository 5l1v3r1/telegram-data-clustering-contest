      <p>Singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran had a surprise performance with Japanese band ONE OK ROCK in their Tokyo gig earlier this week although he announced an eighteen-month hiatus from live gigs at the end of his ‘Divide’ tour in summer.</p>
      <p>For several of the Asian dates on the ‘Divide’ tour, ONE OK ROCK supported Sheeran and now the singer of ‘Shape of You’ returned the favour at the Yokohama Arena.</p>

      <p>Following that, they partnered up on a hit of Sheeran’s own, playing the 2017 hit ‘Shape of You’ before Sheeran leaving the stage.</p>
      <p>This is not the first time Sheeran broke his self-imposed hiatus.</p>
      <p>Sheeran sang ‘Beautiful People’ with Khalid in his O2 Arena show in September.</p>
      <p>The singer have been named as the UK’s richest celebrity under 30 and his manager Stuart Camp is aware that Sheeran may be an ‘overkill’.</p>
      <p>Camp said that he doesn’t want anybody to be bored with Sheeran and that if the singer is on top of the charts, they are possibly not.</p>
      <p>He also added that Sheeran has been going at it for 10 years but no one seems to be sick of it yet.</p>
      <p>He added: “We are very conscious of too much Ed Sheeran.”</p>
      <p>Born Edward Christopher Sheeran on February 17, 1991, the British singer, songwriter, guitarist, record producer and actor released an independent play No.5 Collaborations Project in early 2011.</p>
      <p>In September 2011, Sheeran released his debut album, + after signing with Asylum Records.</p>
      <p>The album reached number one in UK, Australia and number five in the US. Since then, it is certified eight-times platinum in the UK.</p>
      <p>The single ‘The A Team’ earned Sheeran the Ivor Novello Award for Best Song Musically and Lyrically.</p>
