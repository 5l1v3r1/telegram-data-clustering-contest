      <h1>Apple TV Spreads Further, Makes its Way to Amazon Fire TV Devices</h1>

      <p>Back in the days when Apple wasn't all about the streaming business, the only place to find the Apple TV app was on the Apple TV box. Now that it's got Apple TV+ involved, and has lots of original content, Apple obviously wants people to tune in regardless of their streaming hardware. So the app spread, and now it's hit Amazon's streaming gizmos.</p>
      <p>This isn't the first third party integration of the Apple TV app, since it was announced <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/10/aw-yeah-apple-tv-is-now-on-roku/">the app had arrived on Roku devices about a month ago.</a> Clearly Apple wasn't content with leaving it there, with the news that the TV app is now available on <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/fire-tv-cube-hands-free-with-alexa-4k-ultra-hd-streaming-media-player/dp/B07MNBT68T/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=fire+tv&amp;qid=1573728529&amp;sr=8-3">Fire TV Cubes</a>, <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2017/10/amazons-tiny-new-4k-fire-tv-almost-does-it-all/">the Fire TV dongle</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Amazon-Fire-TV-Stick-Streaming-Media-Player-Alexa/dp/B0791RGQW3/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=fire+tv+4k&amp;qid=1573728549&amp;sr=8-2">2nd Gen Fire TV Sticks</a>, and the new <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Amazon-Fire-TV-Stick-4K-Ultra-Hd-With-Alexa-Voice-Remote-Streaming-Media-Player/dp/B079QB9BD7/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=fire+tv+4k&amp;qid=1573728549&amp;sr=8-1">Fire TV Stick 4K</a>. Sadly owners of the JVC Fire TV Edition TV will have to wait until early next year.</p>
      <p>But this means you can install the app to watch Apple's original programming, access your iTunes library, and use Alexa to control what you're watching on screen. You can't do that with a Roku, though the Apple TV box does have Siri for whatever that is worth.</p>
      <p>It may seem a little odd to do this, considering Amazon is one of Apple's biggest competitors in this sphere. But considering the company is starting to prioritise services over hardware, it makes sense to try and get those services to as many people as possible. It's something Apple hasn't been very good at in the past, and as long as they keep all the different versions of the Apple TV app up to date it should work in their favour.</p>
      <p>After all you can't make money from your new streaming service unless people can actually watch it. Who knows, maybe it'll make its way to Android next?</p>
