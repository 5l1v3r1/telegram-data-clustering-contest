      <p>While it's certainly easier to flick on your favourite streaming service and forget about the woes of the world, there's something uniquely special about reading a book. It's something that takes a bit more patience but pays off offering the ultimate form of escapism like few movie adaptions can.</p>
      <p>If one of your friends or family members is someone who actively dedicates the time to this fine art, buying a gift will probably be a little tough because they probably own all the good books. To help you on your way, we've crafted up this little list of Christmas gift ideas to help get those creative juices going during the season of giving.</p>

      <p>Most bibliophiles would shudder at the thought of Marie Kondo-ing their personal book library but the reality is, books are heavy and they take up a lot of space. While e-readers have been widely adopted by book lovers, there are still quite a few struggling to jump on the bandwagon. Give your friend a gentle nudge toward the future by gifting them the power of digital book reading. They'll either love or hate you for it.</p>

      <p>If your recipient is a complete book lover, there's a good chance they probably have a lot of the latest releases. So, yes, while gift vouchers are a bit lazy, they're also completely practical in these situations where you want to be thoughtful without the stress of figuring out what the hell they <i>don't</i> have.</p>
      <p>We've popped Booktopia in here because they're #Australian and their range is available online but there are plenty of other options to choose from. Booktopia offers gift certificates between $20 and $300 so you can decide how generous you're feeling and drop that precious cash.</p>

      <p>Yes, getting someone a bookmark sounds a bit basic but if you make a <i>fancy</i> bookmark then all's swell. Every avid book reader needs a bookmark and if they're anything like me, they'll need multiple because they're always leaving books halfway for the next one.</p>
      <p>These wooden bookmarks are beautifully stylish and there's four which should cover them for at least a month.</p>

      <p>Any physical book reader will know the pain of wanting to rest one hand but struggling to keep fresh books open with just one hand. Thankfully, there's an ingenious little tool to help out us less-dexterous folk keep books open with one hand.</p>
      <p>The little PagePal Page Holder comes in a bunch of different types of wood and looks insignificant but make book readers' lives that little bit easier. They're making time to read dammit, make it a bit easier on them.</p>

      <p>Reading books requires proper serenity and nothing says serenity like popping on your freshest candle. The Paddywax Library collection of candles fits in with the ~vibe~ of most book lovers and comes adorned with quotes from classic authors like Edgar Allan Poe, Jane Austen and Oscar Wilde.</p>
      <p>Getting a candle does seem a little <i>comme ci comme Ã§a</i> as a gift idea but this one shows you <i>know</i> their interests and you're doing your bloody best to be thoughtful about it.</p>

      <p>A bag to carry books to and from the library is necessary and that's why the tote bag was <i>probably</i> created. They've now entered the world of <i>farshun</i> so if your gift recipient is yet to attain their very own, why not give them the gift of convenience.</p>

      <p>Every book lover will know how hard it is to swim against the rising tide of new books but if they haven't yet read the classics either, it's almost an impossible task. Get them this neat little scratch-off poster of 100 books everyone should read and they can slowly scratch one book off at a time. It's got a good mix of old school and recent literary classics ranging from <i>Ulysses</i> and <i>Lolita</i> to <i>The Road</i> and <i>Fear and Loathing In Vegas</i>.</p>
      <p>It will serve as a visual reminder of some of the books they've yet to tick off, which could be inspiring or devastating, really.</p>

      <p>It wouldn't be a good book freak list without some actual books included but rather than offer you a specific title, it's best to explain <i>how</i> to look for the right book. If you know what your friend or family member tends to read then that's a great start. Look for titles similar to that in genre and age. If they're a true crime buff, for example, check <a href="https://www.bookdepository.com/">Book Depository</a> and <a href="https://www.booktopia.com.au/">Booktopia</a> menus, check ratings and reviews on sites like <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/">Goodreads</a> and see if they're are any relevant titles on the numerous Best Books of 20-whatever lists out there.</p>
      <p>Good contenders are likely included on longlists and shortlists for major book awards like the Pulitzer and Man Booker or the Australian-specific awards like the Miles Franklin or Stella Prize.</p>
      <p>For example, some of the biggest fiction book releases this year included Margaret Atwood's <i><a href="https://www.bookdepository.com/Testaments-Margaret-Atwood/9781784742324">The Testaments</a></i>, Sally Rooney's <i><a href="https://www.bookdepository.com/Normal-People-Sally-Rooney/9780571334650">Normal People</a></i>, Taffy Brodesser-Akner's <i><a href="https://www.bookdepository.com/Fleishman-Is-Trouble-Taffy-Brodesser-akner/9781472267061?ref=grid-view&amp;qid=1572998964841&amp;sr=1-1">Fleishman is in Trouble</a></i> and Kevin Barry's <i><a href="https://www.bookdepository.com/Night-Boat-Tangier-Kevin-Barry/9781782116172?ref=grid-view&amp;qid=1572999040263&amp;sr=1-1">Night Boat to Tangier</a></i>. In terms of non-fiction, Jia Tolentino's <i><a href="https://www.bookdepository.com/Trick-Mirror-Jia-Tolentino/9780008294922?ref=grid-view&amp;qid=1572999268065&amp;sr=1-1">Trick Mirror</a></i> essay collection, Lisa Taddeo's <a href="https://www.bookdepository.com/Three-Women-Lisa-Taddeo/9781526611659?ref=grid-view&amp;qid=1572999115248&amp;sr=1-1">Three Women</a>, the #MeToo reporters' <i><a href="https://www.bookdepository.com/She-Said/9781526603272">She Said: Breaking the Sexual Harassment Story That Helped Ignite a Movement</a></i> and the Pulitzer Prize-winning <i><a href="https://www.bookdepository.com/Catch-Kill-Ronan-Farrow/9780708899274?ref=grid-view&amp;qid=1572999327387&amp;sr=1-2">Catch and Kill</a></i> by Ronan Farrow have been very popular. Most book lovers will likely have already read those titles but it's a good start.</p>
