      <h1>Tesla Gigafactory 3 will aim to produce 17k Model 3 this year, claims report</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T12:13:08+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 12:13</time> by <a rel="author">Simon Alvarez</a></address>
      <p>A recent report from China has suggested that Tesla’s Gigafactory 3 in Shanghai will be aiming for a very ambitious goal with regards to its initial production output. Citing information acquired through its sources, local news agency <i><a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1169927.shtml">The Global Times</a></i> has noted that Tesla will aim to produce 17,400 Made-in-China Model 3 at Gigafactory 3 by the end of 2019. </p>
      <p>If the <i>Times</i>‘ information is accurate, this could mean that Tesla could start Model 3 production at a pace of 2,900 units per week. This is incredibly ambitious, though with six weeks left in the year, the target is pretty close to a previous estimate shared by Tesla Global VP Grace Tao, who noted in an interview with Chinese news outlets that Gigafactory 3 will be aiming for a <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-model-3-production-gigafactory-3-3k-per-week/">production rate of 3,000 Model 3 per week</a> to start. </p>
      <p>Inasmuch as Tesla’s reported target of 17,400 Model 3 before the end of the year is notably shocking, the company does have the necessary permissions to <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-gigafactory-3-gets-model-3-mass-production-license/">begin mass-production activities</a> for the Made-in-China electric sedan. Tesla’s mass-production permit was posted by China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology on its website on Wednesday. With this permit, Tesla could begin producing the China-made Model 3 at scale. </p>
      <p>Producing the Model 3 at scale at this point would be a smart move for the electric car maker. So far, Tesla is only waiting for its final permits to start delivering the Made-in-China Model 3 to local reservation holders. But while the company is waiting for these approvals, it could do what it is already permitted to do — manufacture the Model 3 at <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-gigafactory-3-battery-facility-buildout-model-3-china-video/">Gigafactory 3’s Phase 1 area</a>. This way, customer deliveries could begin as soon as Tesla’s final approvals are acquired. </p>
      <p>If Tesla can start the production of the Model 3 in Gigafactory 3 this month, the company could be well within reach of its self-imposed target of producing 360,000-400,000 electric vehicles in 2019. This ambitious goal has received a notable amount of mockery from Tesla critics, especially considering that the company’s Fremont factory is already operating at full capacity. With Gigafactory 3 in the picture, things become a bit different. </p>
      <p>Larger numbers of Made-in-China Model 3 units have been spotted by drone operators and Tesla enthusiasts <a href="https://twitter.com/realChaoZhou/status/1194595852225900545?s=20">Chao Zhou</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTrsRvDqoKw6DTJMLKCuM-Q">Jason Yang</a> in recent flyovers. Chao, for one, noted that he was able to spot around 50 Model 3 in Gigafactory 3’s parking lot. Neither Tesla nor its Chinese partners have provided details about these vehicles, though speculations are abounding that the Model 3 at Gigafactory 3’s parking lots are trial production units. If the <i>Times</i>‘ recent report turns out to be accurate, then Gigafactory 3’s premises may soon be filled with Made-in-China Model 3 vehicles sooner than expected.</p>
