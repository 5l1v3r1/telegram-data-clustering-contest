      <h1>'Awful' - Newcastle United fans in meltdown after major announcement</h1>
      <h2>Aston Villa v Newcastle United | When the Premier League returns after the break Dean Smith's side will play host to the Magpies on November 25 in a Monday night showdown</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T12:06:16+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 12:06</time> by <a rel="author">Richard Cusack</a></address>
      <p>Newcastle United captain Jamaal Lascelles will miss his side's clash with Aston Villa on November 25 because of a knee injury that has ruled him out until the New Year.</p>
      <p>Lascelles was hurt during a tussle with Callum Wilson during the 2-1 win over AFC Bournemouth on Saturday and was replaced by Paul Dummett just 20 minutes into the Premier League clash.</p>
      <p>The Magpies have run the rule over the injury and it has been announced that the 26-year-old will miss at least six weeks of football - the first match of that spell the trip to Villa Park next up for his side.</p>
      <p>Lascelles hadn't missed a single match for <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/steve-bruce">Steve Bruce</a> 's side and had played all-but-eight minutes of his side's League season before the collision with England striker Wilson.</p>

      <p>Dummett will likely be drafted in to fill the Lascelles-shaped hole against <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa</a> , with fellow central defenders Fabian Schar and Florian Lejeune on the comeback trail from injuries of their own.</p>
