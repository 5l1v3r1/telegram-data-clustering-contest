        <b>A jewel thief who beat two elderly people to death in their own homes has been convicted of their murders two decades on.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Michael Weir fatally attacked 78-year-old Leonard Harris and Rose Seferian, 83, in 1998, the Old Bailey was told.</p>
      <p>The original investigation missed clues to link the killings but DNA testing connected Weir to both London attacks after 20 years, the court heard.</p>
      <p>Weir, 52, of Hackney, had denied two counts of murder.</p>
      <p>Prosecutor Tom Little QC told the jury the "defenceless pensioners" had been struck repeatedly and "left for dead".</p>
      <p>Weir was originally found guilty of murdering Mr Harris by an Old Bailey jury in July 1999, but his conviction was quashed by the Court of Appeal in 2000 on a technicality.</p>
      <p>He was retried under the so-called double jeopardy law when new forensic evidence came to light, and prosecutors believe Weir is "the first convicted man to be convicted twice".</p>
      <p>Trial judge Mrs Justice McGowan told the jury they had made "legal history".</p>

      <p>On 28 January 1998, Weir broke into Mr Harris's flat in East Finchley, north London, leaving him with serious head injuries.</p>
      <p>The pensioner was found by an estate agent while his wife, who suffered from dementia, was left badly injured on a bedroom floor.</p>
      <p>An 18-carat gold watch Mr Harris had taken from a German soldier during World War Two and his gold ring were missing.</p>
      <p>Three days after the attack, police found a palm print on the bedroom door but missed the match to the defendant at the time, the court heard.</p>
      <p>On 5 March, Weir violently attacked Ms Seferian in her bedroom when she was at home on her own.</p>
      <p>He stole jewellery including a gold wedding ring with her husband's initials and the date of their marriage engraved on it, a diamond solitaire gold ring, and a silver diamond ring, as well as cash.</p>
      <p>Jurors were told a palm print found inside her Kensington flat on a window frame where Weir broke in was not matched to him until 2017.</p>
      <p>The trial heard that by 2018 new DNA evidence had been obtained and palm prints from both murder scenes were matched to Weir.</p>
      <p>It is believed to be the first time a defendant has been found guilty of the same murder twice, and where a second murder charge has been added to a double jeopardy case.</p>
      <p>Sentencing was adjourned until a date to be fixed.</p>
