      <h1>Jon Jones won’t hold out for ‘money games,’ says he’s fighting Dominick Reyes in ‘a few weeks’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T12:00:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 12:00</time> by <a rel="author">Anton Tabuena</a></address>
      <p>Jon Jones has been hinting at his next bout for about a week now. After saying he believes <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/11/7/20953804/jon-jones-dominick-reyes-corey-anderson-light-heavyweight-ufc-mma-news">Dominick Reyes is “more dangerous” than fellow contender Corey Anderson</a>, the light heavyweight champion then started some social media smack talk to build some heat between the two.</p>
      <p>Jones <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/11/11/20958085/ufc-mma-news-twitter-social-media-jon-jones-dominick-reyes-fight-respect">trashed Reyes for his “fake ass respect,”</a> then said he <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/11/13/20963740/ufc-jon-jones-submission-win-fight-dominick-reyes-light-heayweight-mma-news">wouldn’t submit him during their bout because that would be the “easy way out.”</a></p>
      <p>Now, the 32-year-old took to twitter to imply that the bout is officially on, and it would be happening sooner rather than later. According to Jones, he also decided against “holding out and playing money games” with the UFC so he can get in there as soon as possible.</p>

      <p>Jones didn’t reveal a specific date, but there isn’t really a lot of choices when talking about “a few weeks.” UFC 245 in December is finalized and has three title fights already, so that leaves UFC 246 as the most likely landing spot.</p>
      <p>That next pay-per-view is set for January 18, in Las Vegas, and has yet to have a main event announced.</p>
      <p>Jones’ last bout was in July, where he won a split decision over Thiago Santos. The undefeated Reyes, on the other hand, improved to 12-0 last October after knocking out former middleweight champion Chris Weidman.</p>
