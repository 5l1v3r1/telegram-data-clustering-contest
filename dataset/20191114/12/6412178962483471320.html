        <b>Manchester City playmaker David Silva is reportedly in talks over a move to Japanese club Vissel Kobe.</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>Calciomercato</i> had reported in September that the former Spain international is <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/beckham-ready-to-bring-man-city-legend-to-miami-in-2020"><b>being lined up by David Beckham’s Inter Miami</b></a> and was keen on a move, but <i>El Chiringuito TV</i> claims that the 33-year-old is bound for Japan instead.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/tag/david-silva"><b>Silva</b></a> amassed 409 appearances for City, scoring 73 goals, providing 134 assists and winning four Premier League titles after joining from Valencia in 2010, but is out of contract this summer and has already confirmed that he will be moving on.</p>
      <p>A top product of Valencia’s youth system, Silva played for Los Che across six seasons and previously stated that he wished to retire at his hometown club Las Palmas.</p>
      <p>However, Vissel Kobe, who already have Andres Iniesta, David Villa, Sergi Samper, Lukas Podolski and Thomas Vermaelen on their books, look like they are ready to snap up the midfield schemer.</p>
      <p>Although not a direct replacement, Silva is being tipped to come in for Villa at Kobe, with the former Spain striker retiring at the end of the current J-League campaign.</p>
