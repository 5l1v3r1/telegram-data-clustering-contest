      <p>Notts Countyâ€™s former title-winning manager Steve Cotterill could be handed a return to football after he was interviewed for the Hearts job.</p>
      <p>According to the Daily Record, the 55-year-old held talks with owner Ann Budge as he looks for a return to work after being sacked by Birmingham City last year.</p>
      <p>Cotterill is fondly remembered at <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/notts-county-fc">Notts</a> where he guided them to the League Two title in the latter half of the 2009/10 season.</p>
      <p>He immediately made an impact at the club where he was named manager of the month for March in April 2010.</p>
