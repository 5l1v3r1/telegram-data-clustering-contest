      <h1>Where was the John Lewis Christmas advert filmed? Inside Excitable Edgar's hometown</h1>
      <h2>Excitable Edgar is the star of John Lewis Christmas advert and the adorable dragon has the prettiest home you'll want to visit during the festive season</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T12:01:24+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 12:01</time> by <a rel="author">Julie Delahaye, https://www.facebook.com/juliedjourno</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/john-lewis-christmas">John Lewis Christmas</a> advert has dropped for 2019 and it's an emotional one.</p>
      <p>This year's highly-anticipated advert, joint with Waitrose, tells the story of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/excitable-edgar">Excitable Edgar</a> , a little green dragon who struggles to control his fire breathing when he gets excited about Christmas causing him to accidentally ruin the festivities.</p>
      <p>Luckily, best friend Ava is on hand to help him be accepted by his fellow villagers.</p>
      <p>All to the sound of Bastille's Dan Smith covering REO Speedwagon's Can't Fight This Feeling.</p>
      <p>But it's not just the touching storyline and emotional soundtrack which has been giving us major Christmassy vibes.</p>
      <p>Excitable Edgar and Ava live in a picture-perfect village that looks like the stuff of fairytales, with beautiful sweeping landscapes, frozen lakes that make idyllic ice skating scenes and perfect snowy weather.</p>
      <p>However, the advert was filmed in a very real location; Budapest, Hungary.</p>

      <p>Â </p>
      <p>Filming took place across two weeks in August with over 100 extras enlisted to create the village. (While the advert features snowy scenes, August would very much have been during the heatwave which swept across Europe!)</p>

      <p>It's no surprise that Budapest caught the attention of the cast and crew. There are heaps of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/travel/europe/top-things-see-budapest-how-13955751">beautiful places to visit</a> and we're talking everything from palace complexes, thermal spa baths, riverside views and lush green landscape surrounding the city.</p>

      <p>Of course the advert used special effects to create the snowy landscapes and Excitable Edgar himself, but those landscapes are very real.</p>
      <p>Oh, and Budapest already boasts some serious Christmas credentials.</p>
      <p>In fact, during the festive season the city transforms with its twinkling lights, wreaths and Christmas trees - and it boasts pretty incredible <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/christmas-markets">Christmas markets</a> too.</p>
