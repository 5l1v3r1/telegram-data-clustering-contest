      <p><a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Shraddha-Kapoor">Shraddha Kapoor</a> celebrated Children’s Day by sharing a rare click from her childhood album. The toddler was snapped with her actor brother <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Siddhanth-Kapoor">Siddhanth Kapoor</a> and their expressions are too cute for words. Shraddha doled out massive sibling goals with this childhood memory. Shraddha dressed in a green and red ethnic outfit is all things adorable while her brother Siddhanth looked curiously at the camera.</p>

The actress recently shot in Serbia for some high octane scenes. The film went on floors in September this year and the actress shared several glimpses of her shoot from Serbia. '<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Baaghi-3">Baaghi 3</a>' marks Shraddha and Tiger’s reunion after ‘Baaghi’ and will also feature Riteish Deshmukh, Ankita Lokhande and Ashutosh Rana in pivotal roles.

      <p>Shraddha was last seen in ‘Saaho’, romancing South sensation Prabhas. Speaking about her choice of films Shraddha had told IANS, “As an actor I am always looking for something different, looking for a new challenge. I know that not all my films have worked wonders at the box-office, but that has not stopped me from experimenting.”</p>
