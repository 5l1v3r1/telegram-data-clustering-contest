      <p>Festive attractions are popping up in Newcastle as the city prepares to open its Christmas Market.</p>
      <p>This year's market is set to be bigger than ever, with stalls and rides on Northumberland Street and Blackett Street, as well as in the area immediate to Greys Monument. To make space for the market, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/newcastles-christmas-market-blackett-street-17061791">Blackett Street is shut to traffic.</a></p>
      <p>Shoppers on Northumberland Street will have spotted some of this year's attractions, including a huge windmill and helter-skelter slide, while those who have squeezed onto Blackett Street may have noticed the toboggan run taking shape, along with a traditional carousel.</p>

      <p>Food stalls look to be concentrated around Grey's Monument. The market's organisers, Nottingham-based Mellors, say more than a third of stall-holders are from the North East, although Mellors was unable to supply the stalls' names after a request by ChronicleLive.</p>

      <p>Newcastle City Council's target aimed for at least 40% of the stalls to be from the North East area. The market opens on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Edward Mellors, a director of the Mellors Group said: "We have worked hard to encourage as many local businesses as possible to get involved and are pleased that over a third of the stall holders do come from the North East.</p>
      <p>"We had to extend our search geographically in order to get the numberÂ and variety of stall holders that we need to make new Christmas market as successful as possible for the city.</p>

      <p>"Hopefully once others see how well it has gone this year, we will be able to increase the number of local businesses involved year on year."</p>
