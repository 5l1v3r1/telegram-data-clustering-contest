      <h1>World Rugby's 'agreement' with the SRU hasn't gone down well in Scotland</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T12:39:54+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 12:39</time> by <a rel="author">Josh Raisey</a></address>
      <p>The saga between World Rugby and the Scottish Rugby Union is now over, but it has left a bitter taste in many mouths.</p>
      <p>World Rugby confirmed on Thursday that <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/news/scotlands-typhoon-stand-off-with-world-rugby-is-finally-over-following-release-of-latest-statement">the SRU have issued an apology and paid a donation of £70,000</a> for comments made by chief executive Mark Dodson in the build-up to their match with <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/japan">Japan</a> in Yokohama at the recent World Cup.</p>
      <p>The match was in danger of being cancelled as it coincided with the weekend that Typhoon Hagibis ravaged part of Japan.</p>
      <p>Cancellation would have eliminated <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/scotland">Scotland</a> from the RWC without playing their final pool match and Dodson accused World Rugby of disorganisation and unfairly treating his country.</p>
      <p>Given the circumstances, and the danger that the typhoon posed, these comments caused outrage, but many Scotland fans seem to still back what Dodson said.</p>

      <p>Scotland fans have accused World Rugby of bullying and have suggested that the SRU folded under pressure, as they clearly feel that Dodson was within his rights to say what he did.</p>
      <p>During the RWC, Scotland adopted a siege mentality as it seemed that the rest of the world backed World Rugby’s stance to potentially cancel their match. While the SRU have paid the fine, many fans seem to still have this siege approach.</p>

      <p>Three games were cancelled that weekend at the RWC – England versus France, Namibia versus <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/canada">Canada</a> and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/new-zealand">New Zealand</a> versus Italy. Although <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/italy">Italy</a> captain <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/stade-francais/players/sergio-parisse/">Sergio Parisse</a> did complain about the decision, there was no reaction comparable to Scotland’s. Equally, there was more riding on their contest with Japan.</p>
      <p>Both <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/england">England</a> and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/france">France</a> had already qualified from their pool, Namibia and Canada were already out (although it was maybe the Namibians’ best chance of securing a first-ever RWC win), and while Italy were still mathematically in the tournament, it would have required their first-ever victory over the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/new-zealand">All Blacks</a>.</p>
      <p>Scotland’s match with Japan did have a different feel to the other three, as Gregor Townsend’s side had a legitimate chance of qualifying, but these were extraordinary circumstances.</p>
      <p>However, many fans are still clearly aggrieved at their side’s treatment in the tournament and feel that there should have been contingency plans in place, which was one of the main criticisms at the time.</p>

      <p>The most disappointing thing for Scotland may be the fact that the game went ahead and they still lost in what was one of the most thrilling matches of the tournament. The punishment handed to them by World Rugby has only added insult to injury.</p>
