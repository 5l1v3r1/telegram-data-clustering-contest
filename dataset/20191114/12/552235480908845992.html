      <p>Detectives are hunting a robber who struck in Livingston yesterday (Wednesday).</p>
      <p>Around 5.20pm, a man walked into the Ladywell Store in Thymebank, threatened a member of staff, with a blunt weapon and demanded money.</p>
      <p>The suspect ran off from the shop, with a three-figure sum of cash, heading south on the Loan Path, Livingston.</p>
      <p>The female member of staff was not injured, however she has been left badly shaken and upset by the incident.</p>
      <p>The suspect is white, around five five inches in height, aged between 30 and 40 years old, with a heavy build.</p>
      <p>He has light brown hair and a local accent and was wearing a light-blue hooded top, with dark blue shoulders and sleeves, grey tracksuit trousers and dark-coloured trainers.</p>
      <p>He was also wearing a black tammy style hat with flaps at the side and a snood covering his face in an effort to conceal his identity and was carrying a white plastic bag.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Detective Constable Andrew Young said: “We are checking CCTV footage for any additional information on the suspect. I am appealing to people who were in the area around the time of the incident to think back and consider if they noticed this man near the store prior to the crime taking place or did you see him run off?</p>
      <p>“Any small piece of information could prove significant to the investigation, so please do get in touch with us.”</p>
      <p>Anyone with information is asked to call CID officers at Livingston Police Station via 101, quoting incident number 2833 of Wednesday, 13 November, 2019.</p>
