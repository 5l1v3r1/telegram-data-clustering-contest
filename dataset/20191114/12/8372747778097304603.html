      <p>Automation and artificial technology are generating developments in multiple industries.</p>
      <p>We've seen robots used to sort through recycling and artificial intelligence assisting in vertical farming.</p>
      <p>We'll soon even see its impact on Fort Myers Beach, where new automation will use artificial intelligence to house, sort and deliver boats right to the dock.</p>
      <p>Artificial Intelligence could also play a role in keeping you safe.</p>
      <p>Just to the north of us at the Port of Tampa, testing will soon be underway for new technology.</p>
      <p>Developers hope it will one day be used as a safety tool.</p>
      <p>Bill Riker is the CEO of Liberty Defense - the company behind the device.</p>
      <p>Designed inside of the Massachusetts Institute for Technology, the technology is called Hexwave.</p>
      <p>Riker says it uses a low-power radar to not only detect when a person could be carrying an "item of interest", but also identify the type of weapon that it could.</p>
      <p>It's a new screening system he believes could help in preventing mass tragedies.</p>
      <p>“We use a form of artificial intelligence to then go ahead to detect and recognize that image and identify whether it’s an image or other article of interest.</p>
      <p>We teach the A-I how to recognize that," Riker says.</p>
      <p>He says Hexwave does more that just threat detection and recognition.</p>
      <p>He explains when the technology finds a weapon or other other suspicios item, the A-I communicates back to a guard or security system.</p>
      <p>The units are also mobile, allowing threat assessment both in and outside of the port.</p>
      <p>Riker says Hexwave is a step in the right direction to minimizing mass tragedies.</p>
      <p>“We’ve got to find a way to prevent attacks from occurring.”</p>
      <p>FOX 4 asked Riker how this technology could impact jobs in the future, including those of security guards or TSA agents.</p>
      <p>He says jobs are safe, because Hexwave still requires an element of human decision-making and reaction.</p>
      <p>“It does not replace people. It enables them to do their jobs more effectively.”</p>
      <p>The City of Tampa will test Hexwave in 2020.</p>
