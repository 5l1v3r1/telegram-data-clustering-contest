      <p>Pakistan on Thursday denied any deal with Indian government on Indian <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/category/current-affairs-news-national-1150106.htm">national </a>Kulbhushan Jadhav, who has been sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court on charges of espionage and terrorism in April 2017.</p>
      <p>"The action on Kulbhushan will be taken as per the law. There will be no deal. Absolutely, no question about that," said Foreign Office spokesman Muhammad Faisal in a weekly press briefing.</p>
      <p>Earlier, there were reports about an amendment in the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/pakistan-army">Pakistan Army </a>Act to implement the International Court of Justice's condition to allow Kulbhushan to file an appeal in a civilian court.</p>
      <p>However, the Pakistani military rejected such reports.</p>
      <p>Kulbhushan's case is being tried in military courts and the Army Act forbids such individuals or groups from filing an appeal or seeking justice from a civilian court.</p>
      <p>On July 17, the ICJ ordered Pakistan to grant consular access to Jadhav and also continued stay on his execution, as well as "effective" review of the death sentence.</p>
      <p>During the press briefing, Faisal also talked about the Supreme Court's verdict in Babri Masjid-Ram janmbhoomi case.</p>
      <p>"India's top court verdict poses a threat to other mosques in the country. We will continue to raise Babri Masjid issue on international platforms," he said.</p>
      <p>Faisal said he has urged the Indian government to end Kashmir "lockdown" and restore Internet services.</p>
