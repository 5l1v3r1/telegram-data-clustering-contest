      <p>Argentina, with their top star leading the way, Lionel Messi, headed on Thursday from Palma de Mallorca to Saudi Arabia to face Brazil at the King Saud University stadium in Ryiad.</p>
      <p>They took three training sessions in Mallorca before heading to the Middle East. After the game against Brazil they head to Israel to play Uruguay in Tel Aviv.</p>
      <p>"We have to pay a lot of attention to him," said Chelseaâ€™s Brazilian winger Willian, when asked about Messi.</p>
      <p>"We must restrict his space. But we can't man-mark him, what we have to do is work together to close down the space he gets. Above all, we can't let him have time to think.</p>
      <p>"He's a great player, the best in the world. But we have faced Argentina in the past and this time is not going to be any different."</p>
