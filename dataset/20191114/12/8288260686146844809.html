      <h1>What was voter turnout in the last general election and what will happen this time?</h1>
      <h2>What does turnout mean and what can we expect in the 2019 general election?</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T12:12:13+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 12:12</time> by <a rel="author">Jonathan Walker, https://www.facebook.com/JonWalkerPolitics?pnref=story</a></address>
      <p>Something remarkable happened in the last general election, in 2017.</p>
      <p>Voter turnout was up. That means more people decided to vote in 2017 than voted in other recent elections.</p>
      <p>However, it's still not good news. Because turnout in general elections over the past 20 years, including in 2017, is much lower than it used to be.</p>
      <h3>What is turnout?</h3>
      <p>Turnout is the number of people who vote in an election as a proportion of all the people who were eligible to vote. So a turnout of 70%, for example, would mean seven out of ten people who could have voted actually did so.</p>
      <p>Turnout in 2017 was 68.8%. That means that for every 1000 people who were eligible to vote, 688 people actually voted.</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>If you simply look at the number of votes cast, you'll find that tends to go up as time goes by. But that's because the population of the country keeps on growing. So the turnout figure is a better guide to whether people are taking part in elections or not.</p>
      <h3>How has turnout changed over time?</h3>
      <p>The 2017 figure of 68.8% was an improvement over other recent elections. Perhaps the 2017 election seemed particularly interesting to people.</p>
      <p>Turnout in 2015 it was 66.4%. In 2010 it was 65.1%, in 2005 it was 61.4% and in 2001 it was 59.4%.</p>
      <p>However, if you look at elections before 2001, turnout used to be much higher.</p>
      <p>In 1997 it was 71.3%. In 1992 it was 77.7%, in 1987 it was 75.3%, in 1983 it was 72.7% and in 1979 it was 76%.</p>
      <h3>What will turnout be in 2019?</h3>
      <p>We don't know, but this election is similar to the 2017 election in many ways. Brexit is an issue, and Jeremy Corbyn is still Labour leader.</p>
      <p>Also, the election began with the Conservatives apparently in the lead - according to opinion polls - but nobody is sure what the final result will be. That's also what happened in 2017.</p>
      <p>So it's possible turnout might be similar too.</p>
