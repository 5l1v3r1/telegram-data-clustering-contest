      <p>Some Personal Mobility Device (PMD) users are organising a peaceful rally to voice their concerns over the Government’s recent ban on PMD use on public footpaths. The rally, which is set to take place on Saturday, 23 Nov from 5pm to 10pm at the Speakers’ Corner at Hong Lim Park, is hosted by All Singapore Stuff – a social media page with nearly half a million followers.</p>
      <p>The event description states:<i><b> “Come and speak your mind at Hong Lim Park. Let Lam Pim Min and the other ministers know that they are taking away our livelihoods by taking away your PMDs. This is a peaceful rally to revert the ban on PMDs on 23rd November 2019. 5PM – 10PM. All Singaporeans and PR are welcome, just bring your IC or Passport to join in.”</b></i></p>
      <p>The PMD ban, which was announced on 4 Nov and went into effect the very next day, prohibits PMD users from using public footpaths. Those who flout the ban will face fines of up to S$2,000 and/or imprisonment of up to three months, after a grace period ends on 31 Dec.</p>
      <p>The abrupt ban left food delivery riders who rely on PMDs to make a living in the lurch and hundreds of food delivery riders have been flocking to PAP MPs’ Meet-the-People sessions, seeking an alternative solution.</p>

      <p>Food delivery riders have lamented that the ban, which was imposed after a spate of accidents between PMD riders and pedestrians, will severely curtail their incomes and have held that the bulk of clashes between PMD riders and pedestrians are not caused by food delivery riders who use their PMDs for work, not play.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, an online petition calling for the reversal of the Government’s sudden ban on the use of PMDs has garnered over 25,000 signatures.</p>
