        <b>The 2021 rules and regulations have been in the public eye for two weeks now, but those are only the first editions. The teams still have a mindset of waiting. Honda are not yet signed up for the 2021 F1 season. <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/red-bull-racing">Aston Martin Red Bull Racing</a> team boss Christian Horner says this wait-and-see attitude is common. </b>
      </p>
      <p>Despite the fact that the main points of the regulations have now been clarified, everyone is still a little unsure. Horner is therefore not concerned about the lack of commitment from his Japanese engine manufacturer. <i>“So far, not one team has a contract beyond 2020. After the announcement of the new sporting and technical regulations, conditions are still being negotiated. Honda wants to see what Formula 1 looks like after 2020, without pre-binding. Other manufacturers also analyze the situation,"</i> Horner told Speedweek.</p>

      <p>The engines simplify from 2021 - making it easier for other manufacturers to get in but this has some disadvantages. <i>"You have to see it this way: A new engine would cause a lot of development costs and some of the current manufacturers would leave. That is why it has been decided not to change much in that area. Reducing the number of test days should also help to reduce costs,"</i> said the Brit.</p>
