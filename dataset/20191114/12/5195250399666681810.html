      <h3>BS6 Honda SP 125 has bigger proportions and updated design along with the addition of fuel-injection system</h3>
      <p>Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India (HMSI) has today introduced the BSVI SP 125 in the domestic market. The Japanese manufacturer wants to update its entire lineup to meet BSVI emission standards well ahead of the April 2020 deadline and the SP 125, dropping the CB Shine name, is part of the process.</p>
      <p>The company had already debuted the BSVI compliant Activa 125 and it was accompanied by mechanical updates including the addition of fuel injection and styling changes. The 2020 Honda SP 125 also gets an updated powertrain.</p>
      <p>It accompanies the design updates while dimensions are also altered in the BSVI SP 125. It is equipped with a fuel-injection system and the fuel economy is further improved. Honda has filed 19 new patents for the new SP 125 and it deals with the new engine, equaliser with CBS, Eco digital meter, three new design patents and ACG starter (for silent engine start).</p>

      <p>It has been made available in Striking Green, Imperial Red Metallic, Pearl Siren Blue and Matte Axis Grey Metallic paint schemes. The BSVI Honda SP 125 kicks out a maximum power output of 10.7 bhp at 7,500 rpm while the outgoing model had been making 10.16 bhp at 7,500 rpm and 10.3 Nm of peak torque delivered at 5,500 rpm. The slightly more powerful engine should ensure higher frugality as well.</p>
      <p>As for the proportions, it is longer, taller, wider and has a longer wheelbase than the outgoing model and is offered in two variants with deliveries beginning from next weeks onwards as bookings are underway. The high-spec model boasts a front disc brake and rear drum brake while the other has drum brakes on both ends with the mandatory CBS function.</p>

      <p>Along with bigger dimensions, the 2020 Honda SP 125 has a new swingarm and updated graphics bringing a youthful vibe. All the changes have added up to a hike in price of around Rs. 3,000 compared to the outgoing model. The base drum variant costs Rs. 72,900 (ex-showroom, New Delhi).</p>
      <p>Some of the highlighting features are an all-digital instrument cluster showing real-time economy, riding range, average fuel economy, service reminder and gear position indicator along with engine kill switch, diamond type frame, telescopic front forks, twin rear shocks and low rolling resistance tyres.</p>
