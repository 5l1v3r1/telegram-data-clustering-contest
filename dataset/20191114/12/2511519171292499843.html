      <h1>Arsenal must stop slacking to arrest poor form, says Alexandre Lacazette</h1>
      <h2>Arsenal are already eight points off the Premier League’s top four</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T12:46:16+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 12:46</time> by <a rel="author">Harry Latham-Coyle</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/alexandre-lacazette">Alexandre Lacazette</a> has called on <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Arsenal">Arsenal</a> to stop slacking in a bid to turn around their form.</p>
      <p>Arsenal already find themselves eight points off the top four of the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/PremierLeague">Premier League</a>‘s top four after a 2-0 defeat to <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/LeicesterCity">Leicester</a> at the weekend.</p>
      <p>And Lacazette admits the club are struggling for form, even if results have not been entirely bad.</p>
      <p>“Obviously we’re not at the top of our game at the moment,” Lacazette <a href="http://go.redirectingat.com/?id=44681X1458326&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.arsenal.com%2Fnews&amp;sref=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/arsenal-news-alexandre-lacazette-slacking-unai-emery-epl-a9202751.html">told the club’s website</a>.</p>
      <p>“But we remain leaders in the Europa League, we’re still in the running in the championship. I think now we just need to work on keeping things calm and moving forward with that.</p>
      <p>“We’re working together every day on a constant basis to pick up the slack.”</p>
      <p>The run of poor form has put pressure on Arsenal manager <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/unai-emery">Unai Emery</a>, with questions raised about his team selections and management of key characters in the dressing room.</p>
      <p>Emery has been publicly backed by the club’s board, but doubts remain over his long-term future at the club.</p>
      <p>Lacazette insists that the playing group are fully behind their manager.</p>
      <p>“The group definitely supports the coach and I’m sure the club does as well,” he added.</p>
      <p>“We’re a very tight group and we’re doing everything we can to improve.”</p>
