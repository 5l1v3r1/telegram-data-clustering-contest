      <p>A <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa-fb">Toledo Rockets</a> defensive end was ejected from Wednesday night’s game against the Northern Illinois Huskies for a brutal hit levied on a quarterback.</p>
      <p>Northern Illinois quarterback Ross Bowers received a snap in the third quarter and rolled to his left. However, Bowers stumbled and fell to the ground which signaled the end of the play. As Bowers was getting up off of his knees, Rockets defender Terrance Taylor hit him from behind.</p>
