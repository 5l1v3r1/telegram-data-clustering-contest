      <h1>Latino Marine vet wrongfully held by ICE will get $190,000 from Grand Rapids</h1>

      <p>Grand Rapids will pay a $190,000 settlement to a Latino American war veteran who was <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/marine-vet-held-by-ice-for-possible-deportation-is-u-s-citizen/">wrongfully detained </a>by federal immigration officials. The City Commission unanimously approved the payment to Jilmar Ramos-Gomez on Tuesday to resolve a Michigan Department of Civil Rights complaint.</p>
      <p>Customs Enforcement held Ramos-Gomez for three days last December before releasing the Michigan-born U.S. citizen. Police Capt. Curtis VanderKooi served a 20-hour, unpaid suspension for violating department policy after he alerted the federal agency about Ramos-Gomez' arrest at a hospital.</p>

      <p>The American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan and Michigan Immigrant Rights Center filed the complaint on Ramos-Gomez's behalf in April, saying VanderKooi discriminated against him based on his race, violating the state's Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act. The ACLU also said Ramos-Gomez has post-traumatic stress disorder.</p>
      <p>"He was decorated with a national defense service medal, a global war on terrorism service medal, an Afghanistan campaign medal, and a combat action ribbon, among other awards," the ACLU of Michigan said <a href="http://www.aclumich.org/article/aclu-demands-investigation-kent-county-sheriff%E2%80%99s-department-after-they-delivered-us-citizen">earlier this year.</a></p>
      <p>"Why did they think he was a non-citizen? Did they get him confused with someone else? Who knows," ACLU attorney Miriam Aukerman said. "This is an individual who's incredibly vulnerable with a mental illness."</p>
