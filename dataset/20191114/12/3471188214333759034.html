      <h1>There’s a new Montblanc Summit 2+ smartwatch with Wear OS and LTE in the works</h1>

      <p>The <a href="https://ausdroid.net/2018/10/16/montblanc-launches-summit-2-the-first-snapdragon-wear-3100-wear-os-smartwatch/">Montblanc Summit 2</a> was the first Wear OS smartwatch running the newer Qualcomm Snapdragon Wear 3100 chipset, and it’s now just on twelve months old. According to an FCC listing, there’s a Montblanc smartwatch just around the corner and it’s called the Summit 2+.</p>
      <p>The Montblanc Summit 2+ carries the model number S2C19, and while it includes the standard wireless communications for a smartwatch these days (NFC, Bluetooth and GPS), it also appears to include LTE support.</p>
      <p>This isn’t a common feature on Wear OS smartwatches, or really any, especially as Wear OS isn’t really a platform that fully lends itself to LTE connectivity.  Some of the common bands in use in Australia are included, but not all, so while this watch will likely work in metropolitan areas, in those areas using different or less common frequencies, it might just not.</p>
      <p>The disappointing change is the drop in battery capacity, from a somewhat respectable 340 mAh to just on 300 mAh. Given that LTE can draw a bit more power, you’d hope that there’s some competent power management here to offset the capacity drop.</p>
      <p>Fortunately, like most LTE-enabled watches, the LTE chipset is only active when <i>not</i> connected to your phone, so hopefully it won’t make a big difference.</p>
      <p>Being from Montblanc, you know this is going to be a good looking watch. I wouldn’t bet on it being an affordable one, though.</p>
