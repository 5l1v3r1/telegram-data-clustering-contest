      <p><i>Mad Men</i> actress Christina Hendricks has revealed that she’s a big fan of Britpop, sharing a playlist of her favourite tracks from the ’90s.</p>

      <p>The actress, who starred as Joan Holloway in the cult AMC drama, revealed that she started the playlist while working on <i>American Woman</i> – the acclaimed drama she stars in alongside Aaron Paul and Sienna Miller.</p>
      <p>“I was (am) a HUGE Britpop fan(always, forever),” she wrote.</p>
      <blockquote><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1EbU3t9uEpBA0hemxIts64?si=wGPvlB53QceLdfZ4oE-ugg">This Burning Woman, a playlist by Christina Hendricks on Spotify<br/></a>We and our partners use cookies to personalize your experience, to show you ads based on your interests, and for measurement and analytics purposes.

      <p>The eclectic playlist includes tracks from Britpop stalwarts such as The Verve, The Happy Mondays, Primal Scream, Blur and Elastica.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, there is no inclusion of some of the genre’s other giants – such as Oasis, Pulp and Suede.</p>
      <p>Despite persisting fondness for the generation-defining genre, Suede’s Brett Anderson admitted last month that<a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/suedes-brett-anderson-britpop-was-a-laddish-distasteful-misogynistic-nationalistic-cartoon-2555361"> he hated Britpop in the 90s</a> and he tried to distance the band from it.</p>
      <p>Speaking on <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/n13xtmdc">BBC Hardtalk</a>, he said: “I disassociated myself from that very early on, as soon as I saw what I saw as becoming this kind of laddish, jingoistic, cartoon happening, which became Britpop, I very quickly distanced Suede from that.”</p>
      <p>In response, Liam Gallagher said: ““I hear Burt out of Suede has said it was very laddish. See I disagree, I thought it was the opposite – I thought it was very BLOUSEY, which is why I distanced myself from it. LG x.”</p>
