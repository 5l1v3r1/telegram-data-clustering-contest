      <p>The Volkswagen Jetta wagon was kaput. After 15 years of transporting our family, the seats were torn, the radio was dead and the transmission was starting to go. It was time for a new car. In the spirit of supporting technology that reduces tailpipe emissions, we settled on a Chevy Bolt electric vehicle as our new daily driver.</p>
      <p>I love my car, and I often get stopped by people who are interested in buying an electric vehicle. At first, I couldn't answer all their questions, but now after owning my car for more than a year, I have answers. Below is a rundown of what I've learned from owning a so-called EV.</p>
      <p><b>Electric cars are not cheap. </b>While the average cost of a new light vehicle in the United States is $38,259, according to <a href="https://mediaroom.kbb.com/2019-11-01-Average-New-Vehicle-Prices-Up-Nearly-3-Year-Over-Year-According-to-Kelley-Blue-Book">Kelly Blue Book</a>, the average price on an EV is $53,664 (thank you, Tesla Model S). But many electric vehicles have lower sticker prices than that, including the Nissan Leaf ($30K), Hyundai Ioniq Electric ($31K), Volkswagen eGolf ($33K), Fiat 500e ($33K), Kia Soul EV ($34K), Tesla Model 3 ($36K), Chevy Bolt EV ($37K) and Honda Clarity ($37K).</p>
      <p><b>You can buy an electric vehicle at Costco. </b>Neither my husband nor I like to haggle, so we opted to buy our Chevy Bolt through the Costco Auto Program that offers "lower, prearranged pricing" from approved dealers on most any car. Incentives change from year to year, but at the time, we deduced we paid about $2,000 less than what we would have if we just walked onto the lot and didn't bargain with a salesperson.</p>
      <p><b>Tax credits are available on electric cars. </b>We received more than $7,000 in tax rebates by purchasing an electric vehicle. Do your homework. The <a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/electricvehicles/electric-vehicles-tax-credits-and-other-incentives">federal government</a>, several states and even some cities offer incentives on new EV purchases, and the fine print is constantly changing. The IRS tax credit currently ranges from $2,500 to $7,500, depending on the size of the new EV and its battery capacity. In <a href="https://ww3.arb.ca.gov/msprog/lct/cvrp.htm">California</a>, you can receive up to $7,000 to buy or lease a new EV if you fall within a certain income level.</p>
      <p><b>Driving an EV downhill recaptures energy. </b>In a gas car, when you go down a hill, you continue to use gas. When you go down a hill in an EV, the motor becomes an electricity generator. Most cars, like my Bolt, are equipped with a low mode that allows the battery to absorb more energy as you press on the brake — this is called "regenerative braking." It's fun to watch your mile range go up when you're braking downhill. Sometimes when I drive places in S.F. going mostly downhill, I gain miles rather than lose them.</p>
      <p><b>Charging stations can be hard to find.</b> More and more charging stations are popping up at places like parking garages and grocery stores, but from my experience, these are often in use or broken. My husband and I once stopped at three different charging stations on a drive from San Francisco to Sonoma and struck out at all of them. When we finally arrived in Sonoma with only a few miles of range, we were happy to find the city offers a free charging station — and it was open and working.</p>
      <p><b>We drove to Yosemite and it was a success.</b> Our Bolt's range is 238 miles when the car is driven efficiently. A trip from San Francisco to a lodge outside Yosemite was about 175 miles, but because a large portion of the drive was uphill into the Sierra, we knew the car's range would go down and we'd never make it. We stopped at a charging station at a mall about halfway, and got lunch while the car juiced up for an hour. (Thankfully, the mall chargers were working.) At the Evergreen Lodge, we filled up at another charging station before heading home. We didn't need to stop halfway on the return trip because this time we were regenerating electricity as we went downhill.</p>
      <p><b>Cyclists don't hear you coming.</b> Without an engine, electric vehicles are quiet, and pedestrians and cyclists — especially ones listening to music on headphones — might not hear you coming. I always drive with care and caution, but have found the need to be even more aware of all parties on the road.</p>
      <p><b>There's no spare tire in many EVs.</b> To save weight and run more efficiently, many EVs don't have a spare tire. This is a pain when you get a flat, but most new cars come with a roadside assistance plan. (With the bad roads and constant construction in the Bay Area, plan on going through a few tires from damaged sidewalls)</p>
      <p><b>We spend about $50 a month to charge our Bolt.</b> We drive about 1,000 miles a month and spend about $50 a month to charge our car, mostly plugging in at home during off-peak hours at night. My husband and I both take public transit (or bike) to our offices, but he drives to Sacramento and/or wine country almost weekly, and I drive around kids most afternoons when he doesn't have the car. According to the Environmental Protection Agency label on the Bolt, the estimated fuel cost is $550 per year, or about $46 per month. Compared with an average new vehicle of similar size, the EPA estimates that the Bolt EV could save you $5,000 in fuel costs over five years, or roughly $1,000 per year, or about $70 per month.</p>
      <p><b>Two levels of charging are available for your home. </b>We got a rebate from PG&amp;E to install a Level 2 charger at our home that almost covered the $500 purchase price of the charger.  Hiring an electrician to install a 240-volt outlet near the garage door was extra. With the Level 2 charger, we can fully charge the car overnight taking advantage of lower, off-peak electricity rates. With the Level 1 charger that plugs into your normal wall outlet, it takes 30 to 40 hrs to charge your car.</p>
      <p><b>Charging a vehicle can be painfully slow.</b> Even with a Level 2 charger, it takes several hours overnight for the car to recharge. At a commercial fast-charging station, it takes about an hour. If you haven't planned accordingly and find yourself in a pinch, the process can feel glacially slow — especially when you consider a gas station stop might take five minutes.</p>
      <p><b>Range anxiety is a thing.</b> In the first months of owning the car, I felt an uneasiness about getting stranded in a car with a dead battery. "Range anxiety" — a nagging fear your car battery doesn't have enough juice to get you to your destination — is a real thing. Mine quickly subsided after the first and only time I accidentally ran out the battery. I had only 5 miles of range left and was running the air-conditioner to pick up a kid, not realizing how quickly my efficiency dropped. Roadside assistance picked up the car and pulled it onto a flatbed truck and drove my vehicle home where I could plug it in to charge. It was an ordeal, but not the end of the world, and now that I better understand how the car works, I'm pretty certain it'll never happen again.</p>
      <p><b>Everybody thinks you're a Lyft driver.</b> Electric vehicles are a popular choice with Lyft and Uber drivers, and I'm often mistaken for one when I'm picking up and dropping off my kids around town — or at least that's what I assume when someone gives me a scowl or the finger — for pulling over to pick up one of my kids in the school loading zone.</p>
      <p><b>Wearing a jacket saves energy.</b> Running the heater to warm up any car cabin takes energy. Our Bolt came with heated seats (front and rear) and a heated steering wheel as more efficient alternatives to running the heater. I use these often and I also find myself wearing a jacket to avoid using the range-killing heater too much.</p>
      <p><b>Life is better without trips to the gas station.</b> I never knew just how much I would appreciate never stopping at gas stations where the smell of fuel lingers. I don't miss the pump a bit.</p>
