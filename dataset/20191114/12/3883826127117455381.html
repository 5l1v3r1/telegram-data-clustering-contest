        <b>A man accused of murdering his wife at their chip shop in Carmarthenshire told police he did not throw boiling oil over her, Swansea Crown Court heard.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Geoffrey Bran, 71, denies murdering his wife Mavis Bran, 69, on 23 October 2018.</p>
      <p>Mrs Bran died in Morriston Hospital six days after suffering burns.</p>
      <p>Mr Bran told detectives in the weeks following her death he had not lost his temper following an argument about burnt fish.</p>
      <p>He has claimed Mrs Bran sustained the burns in an accident.</p>
      <p>The court heard when paramedics arrived at Bryn Tawel, the family home, Mrs Bran had a blood alcohol reading of 108 mg/dl. The current drink drive limit in England and Wales is 80mg/dl.</p>

      <p>When asked whether he threw oil over his wife at The Chipoteria in Hermon, Mr Bran told detectives: "I would not throw oil over anybody."</p>
      <p>He was asked why he did not follow Mrs Bran back to their house after she was injured, and replied: "There was nothing I could do", adding he did not call for an ambulance because he believed their lodger was doing so.</p>
      <p>Steven Jeffery, a consultant burns and plastic surgeon, agreed with the pathologist's report that Mrs Bran's eyes were closed when her face was burnt.</p>
      <p>"The eyes were actually scrunched up," he said.</p>

      <p>Prof Jeffery was asked whether Mrs Bran's burns could have been sustained by her falling to the floor and pulling the fryer down over herself.</p>
      <p>"This version of events is consistent with her injuries," he said.</p>
      <p>He also agreed her injuries may have been caused by oil being thrown at her in an assault.</p>
      <p>Prof Jeffrey said there were no cuts or bruises to suggest Mrs Bran had pulled the fryer on top of herself.</p>
      <p>Christopher Clee QC, defending Mr Bran, said:Â  "If it's an act of throwing, he's more likely to have splashed himself with oil. There's no evidence of that?"</p>
      <p>"No," Prof Jeffery replied.</p>
      <p>He confirmed burns on Mr Bran's fingertips were consistent with his version of events.</p>
      <p>Mr Bran denies murder and the case continues.</p>
