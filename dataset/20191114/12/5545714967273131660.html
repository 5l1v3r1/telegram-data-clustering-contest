      <p>SNK has released the newest character trailer for its bloody-but-noble fighting game <i>Samurai Shodown</i>. The new video announces the coming of Kazuki Kazama, who will be made available to download on November 18.<br/><br/>Originally debuting in 1996's <i>Samurai Shodown IV</i>, Kazuki is a hot-blooded teen introduced as a new co-protagonist for the series. With a short temper and the attitude of reckless youth, Kazuki is a wild and unpredictable opponent. Matching Kazuki's hot-head are his incendiary pyrokinetic powers, allowing him to conjure up flames and fireball in battle. This manifests itself in counters and grab attacks, not dissimilar to SNK's <i>King of Fighters</i> character, Iori Yagami.<br/><br/>Kazuki Kazama will be made available to purchase on November 18, or comes as part of the previously released season pass. <i>Samurai Shodown</i> is available now on PS4 and Xbox. A Switch port arrives in Japan on December 12, with a localisation and PC port to follow.</p>
