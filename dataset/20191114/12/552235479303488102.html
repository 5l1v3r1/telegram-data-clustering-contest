      <h1>Major £420,000 refurbishment of Kilmarnock bus station to get underway</h1>
      <h2>Phase one starts on Monday.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T12:49:50+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 12:49</time> by <a rel="author">Ross Dunn, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/ross-dunn/</a></address>
      <p>The highly-anticipated refurbishment of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/ayrshire/">Kilmarnock</a> bus station will get underway next week.</p>
      <p>Phase one of the £420,000 project will concentrate on the waiting room/shopmobility and Stagecoach ticket counter area.</p>
      <p>The Shopmobility office will be completely refurbished and repositioned allowing for the installation of a fully accessible Changing Places Disabled Toilet. This is considered to be one of the first such installations within a bus station in Scotland.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The Stagecoach ticket counter will also be revamped and reposition through 90 degrees to face out into a new waiting room accessible from the bus concourse complete with new state of the art real time passenger information screens.</p>
      <p>The access corridor to the Foregate will be slightly repositioned and widened and the Burns Mall access will also be subject to improvements which are designed to enhance access to the Mall and help improve security.</p>

      <p>Project Management and Construction Ltd (PMC) have been appointed to carry out the work.</p>
      <p>The project was funded by Strathclyde Partnership for Transport, the project has been progressed by Ayrshire Roads Alliance in partnership with East Ayrshire Council and Wyllie Shanks Architects.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The initial bus station feasibility study and proposals were presented to the public in November 2018 where up to 200 members of the public gave their feedback on the proposals.</p>
      <p>The contract is anticipated to last 18 weeks with a completion date in early spring 2020. The bus station will remain fully operational throughout with no disruption to services.</p>
