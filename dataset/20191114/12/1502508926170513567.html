      <h1>Boeing drops automation system used to build 777 jets on reliability issue</h1>
      <h2>Boeing had faced delays last year when the fuselage automated upright build machine was tried out on existing versions of the 777</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T12:33:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 12:33</time> by <a rel="author">Reuters</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/boeing">Boeing </a>Co has abandoned a key <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/automation">automation </a>system used to make fuselage sections for its 777 jetliners amid reports of reliability issues, and will instead partially switch back to mechanics, the planemaker said on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The company began to build 777 fuselages in 2015 in an upright orientation, with robots drilling holes and installing fasteners, an initiative known as fuselage automated upright build (FAUB).</p>
      <p>The world's biggest planemaker said it had stopped using the system which, according to industry sources, caused problems with reliability and rework issues.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/boeing">Boeing </a>had faced delays last year when the FAUB machine was tried out on existing versions of the 777.</p>
      <p>Instead, the company will switch to "flex tracks" - an automated method to drill the holes along the circumference of the airplane that are then fastened manually.</p>
      <p>The system was developed by <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/boeing">Boeing </a>Commercial Airplanes and has been tested in commercial and defense programs, company spokesman Paul Bergman said in an emailed statement.</p>
      <p>Implementation of flex tracks for the 777 fuselage began in the second quarter and Boeing expects the transition to be complete by the year-end, Bergman said.</p>
      <p>There are no planned changes in total staffing and the company continues to implement robotic systems on areas such as wing manufacturing for the 777X.</p>
      <p>The setback highlights continuing pressure on the company's management at a time it is trying to obtain approval to return its grounded 737 MAX jetliner to service before the end of this year.</p>
      <p>The change in production strategy for the 777 was reported earlier by Bloomberg.</p>
