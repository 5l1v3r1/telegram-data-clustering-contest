      <h1>Plymouth Argyle team news for trip to League Two leaders Forest Green Rovers</h1>
      <h2>Pilgrims' boss Ryan Lowe has given an update on the calf injury to midfielder Jose Baxter</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T12:34:28+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 12:34</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Errington</a></address>
      <p>Plymouth Argyle midfielder Jose Baxter is struggling to overcome a persistent calf injury, manager Ryan Lowe has admitted.</p>
      <p>There is no timetable for the return of the talented 27-year-old, who has played only once since mid-September due to the problem.</p>
      <p>Baxter is on a short-term contract with <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/all-about/plymouth-argyle">the Pilgrims</a> until January so being out of action for so long is not doing him any favours at all.</p>
      <p>Lowe said: “He’s struggling a little bit with the injury. We will just keep monitoring him.</p>
      <p>“Soleus calf injuries are horrible. They are heart-breaking really. I done mine three times and you get a false sense of security.</p>
      <p>“One minute you think you are alright and one minute you are not.”</p>
      <p>Baxter is the only injured player in the Argyle squad ahead of the trip to League Two leaders Forest Green Rovers on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Lowe added: “I think he has done a bit of work this week and we will see where he’s at with that.</p>
      <p>“But it’s irrelevant to us at the moment. If he’s not available for us for the next week or two we just need to concentrate on what we have got.”</p>
      <p>Baxter has been limited to five starts and seven substitute appearances for Argyle so far this season.</p>
      <p>Right wing-back Joe Riley is available for selection against Forest Green after sitting out the 1-0 FA Cup first round win at Bolton Wanderers last Saturday.</p>
      <p>Riley missed out against the club where he started his career after falling heavily on his left arm in training last Friday.</p>
      <p>It was the arm which he broke during an away game against Blackpool at the end of March and he had an operation to insert a plate in it.</p>
      <p>Lowe said: “Joe is fine. I think it’s just when he has an impact on it, it’s sore, but it has settled down now.</p>
      <p>“He has trained Tuesday and he’s training today (Thursday) so he’s fine.</p>
      <p>“I think it’s broke still but he doesn’t want to get the operation because he’s going to potentially miss games.”</p>
      <p>Striker Dom Telford made his comeback from a hamstring injury as a late substitute against Bolton.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old then played for close to an hour for Argyle in their Premier League Under-23 Cup tie away to Everton on Sunday afternoon.</p>
      <p>Two of Argyle’s other forwards, Billy Clarke and Ryan Taylor, also gained valuable game-time against Everton.</p>
      <p>Clarke, who scored an equaliser from the penalty spot in the 1-1 draw, and Taylor were able to take part in the match as over-age players.</p>

      <p>Lowe said: “It’s tough sometimes when you go to them 23s’ games. What do the lads really get out of it?</p>
      <p>“But all three of them (Telford, Clarke and Taylor) wanted to play. We wanted to put a strong team out because we knew Everton would be strong.</p>
      <p>“It was minutes in the lads’ legs and that is what they have needed. Billy looked a lot sharper and Dom needed it certainly.”</p>
