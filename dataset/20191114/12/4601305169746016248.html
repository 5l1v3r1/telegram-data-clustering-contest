      <h1>The poorest half of Americans have nothing left, so now the 1%'s growth comes from the upper middle class</h1>

      <p>The Fed's latest figures on American household wealth paint a rosy picture -- in the aggregate. US households now own a record-breaking $107T worth of assets!</p>
      <p>But drill into those figures and you'll notice that almost all of this new wealth has landed in the pockets of the top 1% of households. That's not unusual: America has been on a glide-path to oligarchy since the Reagan years. What's also not new is that the share of wealth owned by the bottom 50% of American households has continued to fall, while their debts have continued to rise: the bottom half own 6.1% of all US wealth, while they are burdened with 36% of America's debts. When you subtract debts from assets, the bottom half of US households account for only 1.9% of America's assets.</p>
      <p>What that tells us is that the top 1%'s growth can no longer come from the bottom half, the people whose political woes and economic anxiety do not provoke regulators or lawmakers to actions.</p>
      <p>And indeed, when you look at the Fed's quarterly figures, you see that the biggest decline in household wealth is now coming from the upper middle class, the 50%-99% of households, who are, basically, the last people left in America with piggybanks for oligarchs to empty.</p>
      <p>There's lots of ways in which wealth-transfers from the upper-middles to the super-rich are effected: while upper-middles might own stocks, they don't get to buy into private equity funds or VC funds, where table-stakes are $5m. Meanwhile, the most common assets for the middles -- CDs, savings accounts -- have been stagnant for more than a decade, thanks to the Fed's low-interest policies.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the things that define middle-class life -- quality health care, post-secondary education, decent housing -- have soared in costs, far, far ahead of the modest gains experienced by the 50-99%. Those increased costs are largely due to market-cornering and price-gouging by companies that have been bought up by the private equity sector whose beneficiaries are almost exclusively the super-rich.</p>
      <blockquote>The top 1%’s share of household wealth over those ten years increased by 5 percentage points to 32%. The 1% now own nearly one-third of total household wealth, <br/><br/>But over those 10 years, the share of household wealth owned by the next 9% fell by 3 percentage points to 37%. <br/><br/>And the share of the 50% to 90%, the upper middle class, also fell by 3 percentage points to 29%. <br/><br/>Today, the share of the 1% is nearly 4 percentage points higher than the share of the 50% to 90%. <br/><br/>Back in 2002, it was reverse: The share of the 1% was about 10 percentage points lower than the share of the 50% to 90%. <br/><br/>The first time that the 1% had a larger share of household wealth than the 50% to 90% was in 2013, and the gap has ballooned since.</blockquote>
