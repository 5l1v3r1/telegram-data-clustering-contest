      <h3>River Landing arena</h3>
      <p>After 30 years of struggling with limited access to our northern arena, <a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/news/local-news/riversdale-site-tabbed-as-possible-location-for-new-saskatoon-arena">one of the sites on the short list for the new arena</a> has even poorer access — the River Landing site, located between the soon-not-to-be-farmers’-market and the river. While the old SEDCO induced arena had dangerous access on two sides, the River Landing site only has access on one side, the north side. How convenient is this?</p>
      <p>The river blocks access to the south. The configuration of freeway, Remai Modern, electrical substation and parks, reduces access to the proposed site from the north only.</p>
      <p>There’s another shortcoming with the proposed River Landing location: best practices in planning are to maximize a site’s potential. Thus, the best views in the city — of the riverbank — should be exploited with plenty of windows in the buildings. Witness the new trio of buildings east of Persephone Theatre. Lots of glass. Even Remai Modern, a building type usually with few windows, has a wall of glass on the river side. Full marks.</p>
      <p>An arena is inward looking — at the game. Hallways are to get to the concessions and the bathrooms, not to contemplate the view.  No need for windows there.</p>
      <p>The final use of land is resolved by resolution of many factors, which are usually in conflict with each other: city hall experts want one thing, the majority of council want to get re-elected, the neighbourhood wants peace and quiet, and nearby restaurants want post-game patrons. So, development rarely proceeds on a rational basis. Good access and best use of the land may be casualties.</p>

        <b>The Saskatchewan way</b>
      </p>
      <p>I am a ‘senior’ senior, born and raised here.</p>
      <p>I can’t recall ever that our province experienced such hatred and vitriol in the <a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/category/news/politics/election-2019">federal election</a>. This is very sad to see. Our premier, Scott Moe, contributed his worth to this behaviour. This is not the Saskatchewan way.</p>
      <p>Let’s hope we do better in the future.</p>

        <b>Western separatism</b>
      </p>
      <p>Regarding the slogan “the west wants out” I want to remind readers that “the west” is comprised of not only residents of Alberta and Saskatchewan, but also those of Manitoba, where four Liberals were elected, and British Columbia, which also elected several as well as NDP and Green Party members. In addition, there are numerous First Nations in Saskatchewan and Alberta. None of these has expressed an interest in leaving Canada.</p>
      <p>I feel concern for the people in Saskatchewan and Alberta who are in fear of losing their well paying jobs, but tearing up the country, or threatening to, is not an answer to the slowing down of the oil and gas industry, which is happening for many reasons, including technology and the world low price of oil.</p>
