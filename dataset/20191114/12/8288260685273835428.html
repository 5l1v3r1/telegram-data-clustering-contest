      <p>A happy couple have tied the knot at a special wedding ceremony where their PONY was the guest of honour.</p>
      <p>Courtney and Ben Small have been together for years and decided they wanted to become man and wife.</p>
      <p>They planned their perfect day, in the stunning grounds of St Elizabeth's House, in Plymouth, Devon, and wrote up a long guest list - with one special invitee.</p>
      <p>And they made sure that their pet pony named Joker was able to attend to celebrate with them.</p>

      <p>Majestic white-haired Joker took centre stage at the equestrian-friendly marriage ceremony, and even featured in the wedding pictures.</p>
      <p>The pair were joined by family and friend for their memorable day, and volunteers from Hoofbeats Equine Rehabilitation Sanctuary including Sharon Vieira.</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>Sharon said: "We were so pleased to be able to help bring an extra special touch to the wedding.</p>
      <p>"It was only right that Joker was able to be a part of the big day and we wanted to also repay all the hard work Courtney and Ben have done for us over the years."</p>
