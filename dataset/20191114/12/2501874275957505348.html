      <p>A Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Lieutenant has pleaded not guilty to charges stemming from a DUI collision on Highway 154 in September.</p>
      <p>Javier Jonathan Antunez, 44, appeared in Santa Maria Superior Court on Wednesday on crutches due to his injuries from the collision. </p>
      <p>On the evening of September 14, three vehicles collided near the entrance of Lake Cachuma. Antunez was driving a BMW with another occupant when it drifted into oncoming traffic and collided head-on with a Toyota Tacoma carrying four occupants. A Jeep with one occupant following behind subsequently collided with both vehicles. </p>
      <p>There were a total of seven patients with one patient flown to Santa Barbara Hospital via a CalStar helicopter with critical injuries. </p>
      <p>Two days after the collision, Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Office announced Antunez, an off-duty Custody lieutenant assigned to the Main Jail, was involved in the collision and was placed under arrest for driving a vehicle under the influence.</p>
      <p>Antunez was formally charged with two felony DUI charges, driving under the influence and causing injury, and driving under the influence with greater than a .08% blood alcohol content and causing injury, as well as one habitual offender enhancement. </p>
      <p>One victim of the crash has been identified as Judith Hall, a Santa Barbara County District Attorney's Office investigator. Hall was airlifted from the scene with major injuries.</p>
      <p>The California Attorney General's Office will try the case as the District Attorney's Office recused themselves due to a possible conflict of interest. </p>
      <p>Antunez has been employed with the Sheriff’s Office since 1999.  He has been placed on administrative leave pending an internal investigation, according to the Sheriff's Department.</p>
      <p>A preliminary hearing is set for January 6, 2020. Antunez is out of custody on $150,000 bail.</p>
