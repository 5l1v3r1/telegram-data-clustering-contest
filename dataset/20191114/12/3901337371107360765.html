      <p>With Zlatan Ibrahimovic announcing his exit from LA Galaxy this week, we throw it back to when the Swede announced himself to Major League Soccer with an inch-perfect 40-yard volley. Check it out!</p>
      <p>"Go back to watching baseball" is the message Zlatan left MLS fans as his time with LA Galaxy came to an end. On a personal note, the former Manchester United striker's time with the Los Angeles club was a prolific one, with the Swede having scored 53 goals in 58 games for the team.</p>

      <p>In typical "Ibra" fashion, Zlatan announced himself to the Galaxy fans in the most Zlatan way possible by scoring a 40-yard volley 19 minutes into his debut for the club.</p>
      <p>Facing rivals Los Angeles FC at the time, his strike ensured that the two sides were tied at 3-3 until the 90th minute. The ex-Barcelona man then scored another goal in added time to inspire Galaxy to a 4-3 win in the El Trafico derby.</p>
