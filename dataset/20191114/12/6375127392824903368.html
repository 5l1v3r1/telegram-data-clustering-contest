      <h3>PRESIDENT Rodrigo Duterte will order a separate investigation of two Cabinet members the Presidential Anti-Corruption Commission (PACC) previously flagged for alleged corruption.</h3>
      <p>PACC Commissioner Greco Belgica said they have already submitted their findings and recommendation to the Office of the President.</p>
      <p>But Duterte’s spokesman Salvador Panelo said the President would likely validate the commission’s report first and conduct his own investigation before he makes a move.</p>
      <p>“Of course, the President will order an investigation, he will validate it,” Panelo told reporters Thursday in Malacañang.</p>
      <p>The PACC revealed that it conducted a lifestyle check on the two Cabinet members last August.</p>
      <p>Duterte has fired several government officials over allegations of graft and corruption while in office.</p>
      <p>But he was also criticized for “recycling” officials he had sacked by reappointing them to other government posts.</p>
