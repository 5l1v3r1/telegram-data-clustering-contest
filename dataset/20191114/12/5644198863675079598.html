      <p>A dominant India remained on course for a big first-innings lead after skittling out Bangladesh for a meagre 150 runs despite some sloppy catching on day one of the opening test on Thursday.</p>
      <p>NEW DELHI: A dominant India remained on course for a big first-innings lead after skittling out Bangladesh for a meagre 150 runs despite some sloppy catching on day one of the opening test on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The hosts lost opener Rohit Sharma for six in their reply but finished the day on 86-1 with Cheteshwar Pujara and Mayank Agarwal putting on 72 runs for the flourishing second-wicket partnership.</p>

      <p>Pujara was batting on 43 with seven boundaries. Agarwal was lucky to reach 37 after being dropped in the slip by Imrul Kayes when on 32.</p>
      <p>Earlier, Mominul Haque won the toss in his first match as Bangladesh's new test captain but his decision to bat immediately backfired.</p>
      <p>India's three-pronged pace attack exploited the early morning conditions and reduced them to 31-3 at the Holkar Cricket Stadium.</p>
      <p>After repeatedly beating the tentative bats of both the openers, Umesh Yadav drew first blood in the sixth over, getting Imrul caught in the slip for six.</p>
      <p>Ishant Sharma sent back Shadman Islam in the next over before Mohammed Shami trapped Mohammad Mithun lbw for 13 to wreck the top order.</p>
      <p>Mominul and Mushfiqur Rahim combined pluck and luck to forge the only 50-plus partnership in the Bangladesh innings.</p>
      <p>Mominul was on three when he was spilled in the slip by Ajinkya Rahane, otherwise a safe catcher who had a terrible day, off Ravichandran Ashwin.</p>
      <p>Mushfiqur was dropped twice, first by Virat Kohli and then by Rahane, who also dropped Mahmudullah off Ashwin.</p>
      <p>Ashwin spared himself any more heartbreak by bowling out Mominul, who made 37, and Mahmudullah.</p>
      <p>A much-relieved Rahane, sporting a sheepish smile, ran to congratulate Ashwin after the spinner sent back Mahmudullah.</p>
      <p>Shami (3-27) dismissed Mushfiqur, who made 43, and Mehidy Hasan Miraz in the last two balls before the tea break though Taijul Islam denied him a hat-trick after tea.</p>
      <p>"I had to think of the conditions and situation and try to keep my line as tight as possible and stick to my plans," Shami told broadcaster Star Sports afterwards.</p>
      <p>"I have been bowling from wide of the crease in the last two years and I once again backed myself."</p>
