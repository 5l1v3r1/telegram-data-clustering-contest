      <h1>Parker: When it comes to air travel, Calgary's Flyht Aerospace Solutions a major global player</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T12:00:19+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 12:00</time> by <a rel="author">David Parker, Calgary Herald</a></address>
      <p>Most of us experience air travel, many quite frequently, so it is comforting to know of all of the safeguards an aircraft operator has available. And good for Calgary that we have a major global player to help these operators know where their aircraft is and how it is performing.</p>
      <p>Flyht Aerospace Solutions is a leading provider of real-time aircraft data streaming technology that has its Automated Flight Information Reporting System on commercial aircraft around the world.</p>
      <p>The company that was launched in 1998 has already had two moves because of growth needs and now CFO Alana Forbes is directing another relocation, from Deerfoot Court on 29th Avenue N.E. to Deerfoot Junction at the corner of Deerfoot Trail and 32<sup>nd</sup> Avenue N.E., to enable further expansion.</p>
      <p>The move into Deerfoot Court was orchestrated by the Colliers International team of Justin and Peter Mayerchak, who also helped the company expand within that building. So, it was a natural call to again ask for their help to find larger space.</p>
      <p>Forbes says the new location had certain restrictions, chief among them the need for a top floor that offered clear horizons necessary for testing purposes. A series of antennas will be mounted on the roof, giving the shortest distance possible for conduit to travel down into a testing facility that replicates an aircraft cockpit.</p>
      <p>Bill Tempany served as CEO of Flyht until 2015 when he decided to retire from day-to-day activities to become board chair, and he recruited Tom Schmutz to fill that role. Schmutz was at the time vice-president of engineering in the aviation recorder division for Florida-based L-3 Communication, and was well known to Tempany as he had been lead on development collaboration with Flyht.</p>
      <p>Schmutz moved his family to Calgary but has since returned to the U.S. as Flyht has acquired Panasonic Weather Solutions based in Colorado.</p>
      <p>The purchase gives Flyht a new revenue stream with its TAMDAR equipment that captures, processes and transmits data on temperature, pressure winds aloft and relative humidity.</p>
      <p>Currently, this information is provided through the use of 800 balloons that rise twice daily around the globe to take measurements that are supplied to meteorologists.</p>
      <p>Mounted in front of the wing of an airplane, the TAMDAR sensors can enhance that data and is currently providing critical information from more than 250 equipped airplanes.</p>
      <p>Forbes says today there are 40,000 licensed commercial aircraft, so Flyht’s sales teams in the U.K., U.S., China and Latin America have a huge target. She says the two companies are fully integrated and initial sales are usually made with its core products of voice communications, flight tracking, aircraft health monitoring and streaming black box data. Satisfied customers can then be introduced to the weather sensors.</p>

      <p>According to Forbes, 23 per cent of the company’s revenues come from businesses with airlines based in China, and 25 per cent of ordered new aircraft are destined for that country. Flyht currently has 190 contracted Air Asia aircraft that is also expected to substantially increase its fleet.</p>
      <p>It all bodes well for corporate headquarters in Calgary, where Forbes and other executive team members, CTO Derek Graham and COO Matieu Plamondon, are located.</p>
      <p>The office move will take place next spring and the increase in space to 16,500 square feet will allow it to increase staff from its current 50 to around 75, so Flyht will soon be looking for more qualified high-tech engineers and software developers.</p>
      <p>Notes:</p>
