      <p>Stacey Solomon has posted a picture on social media of her son wearing a <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic kit</a> while helping her clean.</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/x-factor">X Factor</a> star, 30, filmed son Leighton trying to tidy up his Lego using a mop as he wore a hoops shirt and shorts.</p>
      <p>She joked she had to resist taking over as his unique method of cleaning was beginning to stress her.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/loose-women">Loose Women's</a> first picture shows the youngster kneeling down, with Lego scattered all over the floor, as he slowly picked up the pieces.</p>

      <p>She captioned it : "What is life?"</p>
      <p>By the time she took the second photo, he had devised an unusual yet genius way of gathering it all up - using the mop.</p>
      <p>Stacey said: "10 points for imagination. I'm getting slightly obsessed with how he could be doing it so much more efficiently.</p>
      <p>"I want to get up and do it. Must resist."</p>
      <p>In each of the pictures, Stacey's boy can be seen wearing the green and white hoops.</p>
