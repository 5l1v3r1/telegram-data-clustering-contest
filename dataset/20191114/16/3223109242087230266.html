      <h1>‘Doctor Who’ Season 12 Writers, Directors Revealed</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T16:13:47+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 16:13</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.geek.com/author/stephanie_m/" target="_blank">Stephanie Mlot</a></address>
      <p>The next season of <a href="https://www.geek.com/news/hbo-max-scores-exclusive-doctor-who-streaming-rights-1798538/"><i>Doctor Who</i></a> still doesn’t have an official release date.</p>
      <p>But it does have an exciting lineup of writers and directors.</p>
      <p>BBC America on Wednesday <a href="http://www.bbcamerica.com/anglophenia/2019/11/all-new-doctor-who-seasons-writers-and-directors-announced">announced</a> a host of new and returning faces—including showrunner Chris Chibnall, who has <a href="http://www.doctorwhotv.co.uk/series-12-writers-directors-confirmed-91187.htm">reportedly</a> penned four episodes.</p>
      <p>Three dramatists and four auteurs will make their TARDIS debut in 2020, alongside returning writers Vinay Patel (“Demons of The Punjab”), Ed Hime (“It Takes You Away”), and Pete McTighe (“Kerblam!”).</p>
      <p>“We’re thrilled that <i>Doctor Who</i> continues to attract some of the most exciting and dynamic talent working in television,” Chibnall said in a statement. “Along with our returning faces, we’re excited to welcome new members to the <i>Doctor Who</i> family.”</p>
      <p>Perhaps most exciting, though, is the number of female voices being represented in the next series.</p>
      <h3>Writers</h3>
      <p><b>Nina Metivier</b> is co-creator and writer of teen thriller <i>The A List</i> (BBC/Netflix); she produced and wrote on the BAFTA-winning TV series <i>Dixi</i>.</p>
      <p><b>Maxine Alderton</b> has written for CBBC’s <i>The Worst Witch</i> and ITV’s long-running soap <i>Emmerdale</i>, for which she won a Yorkshire RTS award for a standalone episode about dementia. She has also been nominated twice for a Writers’ Guild award.</p>
      <p><b>Charlene James</b> previously wrote for television program <i>A Discovery of Witches</i>, and award-winning theatre play <i>Cuttin’ It</i>.</p>
      <p><b>Pete McTighe</b> is the originating writer on Netflix’s female prison drama <i>Wentworth</i>, and currently executive produces and writes season two of <i>A Discovery of Witches</i>.</p>
      <p><b>Ed Hime</b> was nominated for a Craft BAFTA for his first episode of <i>Skins</i>, and won the Prix Italia for radio play <i>The Incomplete Recorded Works of a Dead Body</i>.</p>
      <p><b>Vinay Patel</b>‘s TV debut, <i>Murdered By My Father</i>, won the 2016 Royal Television Society Award and was nominated for three BAFTAs.</p>
      <h3>Directors</h3>
      <p><b>Emma Sullivan</b>‘s short film <i>After Tomorrow</i> was nominated for a Palme d’Or at the 62nd Cannes Film Festival and won Best Short Film at the Edinburgh Film Festival in 2009. Her work has been seen on <i>Call the Midwife</i> and <i>Silent Witness</i>.</p>
      <p><b>Nida Manzoor</b> recently received an RTS nomination for her work on <i>Enterprice</i>. She is currently writing and directing an original music comedy for Channel 4 called <i>Lady Parts</i>.</p>
      <p><b>Jamie Magnus Stone</b> is a film director and animator who created and directed the BAFTA-nominated short <i>Orbit Ever After</i>. His recent work includes <i>Tripped</i> and <i>The Last Dragon Slayer</i>.</p>
      <p><b>Lee Haven Jones</b> has directed multiple episodes of <i>The Bay</i>, <i>Vera</i>, and <i>Shetland</i>. He’s won two Welsh BAFTAs for his work as a director; his first feature film, <i>Gwledd/Feast</i>, will premiere in 2020.</p>
      <p>“The <i>Doctor Who</i> team is crammed with British television’s brightest writers and directors,” Chibnall said. “We’ve adored working with them, and can’t wait to show you the explosive stuff they’ve created.”</p>
      <p>There’s no telling when that will be, though.</p>
      <p>The official <i>Doctor Who</i> YouTube channel on Sunday <a href="https://www.geek.com/television/doctor-who-teaser-hints-at-november-return-1809998/">released a teaser</a> for the upcoming season, which is “coming soon,” according to the 15-second clip. The video description tipped a Nov. 23 release date.</p>
      <p>But BBC America’s announcement suggests <a href="https://www.geek.com/television/doctor-who-returns-this-fall-with-interactive-vr-game-1788073/">Whovians</a> will have to wait until next year.</p>
