      <p>Want some data? Perhaps a lot of it? Australia’s newest telco Circles.Life is offering a 100GB mobile plan for the bargain basement price of just $28 a month.</p>
      <p>Correct. 100GB for just $28. That’s not a mistake.</p>
      <p>What you’re looking at is a promotion from Circles.Life to bring new customers onto their plans. For the first twelve months, new customers will receive 100GB data each month, and after that, it reverts to a much less impressive 20GB per month.</p>
      <p>However, there’s no contracts, so if you decide after 12 months to try your luck with a better deal somewhere else, then so be it – you can!</p>
      <p>For a similar allowance, you’re looking at some big plans from the big three carriers, starting with Vodafone at $65 a month on a 12-month contract. Optus charges more again, and Telstra a $1 more again, but there are options there.</p>
      <p>To take up the Circles.Life deal, you need to sign up online before 17 November, use the promo code 100GBFOR28, and activate your SIM card by December 31.</p>
      <p>There are other plans, too, from Circles.Life, including a more standard 20GB monthly plan which is only $18 per month.</p>
      <p>That’s a similar deal – for 12 months only – and requires the promo code 10FOR12. It’s valid until the end of November 2019.</p>
      <p>Why take up these deals? Both come with what Circles.Life calls “bill shock protection data”, where you can add on 3GB for $6 if you manage to use up all 100GB in a month.</p>
      <p>Unlike some other carriers – which charge monthly based on your sign-up date – Circles.Life aligns with calendar months, so you’ll pay a pro-rata fee in the first month, and also receive a pro-rata amount of data.</p>
      <p>Don’t go nuts with 100GB in the first month or you may be in for a surprise.</p>
