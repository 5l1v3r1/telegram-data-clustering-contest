      <h1>M. Night Shyamalan's Servant Has Another (Equally Creepy) Trailer</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T16:07:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 16:07</time> by <a rel="author">Rachita Vasandani  </a></address>
      <p>M. Night Shyamalan’s much-anticipated Apple series <i>Servant</i> has another trailer, titled “Making Jericho.” Spoiler alert: It’s creepy.</p>
      <p>The Apple TV+ exclusive premieres on Nov. 28 and tells the story of a Philadelphia couple in the midst of mourning the death of their baby, whom they replace with a disturbingly lifelike doll. Weirdness ensues, they have a creepy babysitter and Rupert Grint somehow doesn’t make it any less uncomfortable.</p>
      <p>The latest trailer focuses on the process of making the little baby doll, set to a backing track of Debussy’s “Clair de Lune.” Sounds artistic, but when you see it in the context of the <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2019/11/trailer-apple-servant-m-night-shyamalan.html">other trailer</a>, it’s hair-raising.</p>
      <p>Check out “Making Jericho” below.</p>
