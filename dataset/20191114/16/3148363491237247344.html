      <p>NBC Los Angeles <a href="https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/Saugus-High-School-Shooting-Santa-Clarita-California-564919052.html">reports</a> “at least six people were shot” but there is no information on their condition.</p>
      <p>KTLA <a href="https://ktla.com/2019/11/14/shooting-at-saugus-high-school-prompts-lockdown-of-campus-gunman-sought/">reported</a> that deputies “responded after receiving a gunshot wound call just before 7:40 a.m..”  The noted “at least three victims” were seen being treated.</p>
      <p>Police are now searching for the gunman, described as a “male Asian” wearing black:</p>

      <p>Saugus High School is on lockdown, as is a nearby elementary school.</p>
      <p>California has an “assault weapons” ban, universal background checks, firearm registration requirements, a one-handgun-a-month purchase limit, a requirement that would-be buyers secure a safety certificate from the state before purchasing a gun, a 10-day waiting period on gun purchases, and ammunition controls, among other things.</p>
      <p>Teachers in California are also prohibited from possessing guns with which to shoot back if under attack.</p>
