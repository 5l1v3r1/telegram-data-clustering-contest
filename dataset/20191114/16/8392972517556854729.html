      <h2>Lord Alan Sugar wouldn't have wanted anyone to see THAT</h2>

      <p>Lord Alan Sugar might have to point his stubby finger and regretfully say "you're fired" to a member of his crew, after an embarrassing gaffe left <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/tv/apprentice-viewers-are-disgusted-as-contestant-takes-part-in-poo-spitting-game-as-part-of-first-task/">The Apprentice</a> viewers scratching their heads last night.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday night (November 13), eagle-eyed TV viewers watching the dramatic boardroom firing joked that things had got out of hand when a 'mystery man' was seen apparently lifeless on the floor.</p>

      <p>When Pamela Laird and the other losing team members left the boardroom after another brutal assessment of their task, fans were distracted by a man LYING on the floor.</p>
      <p>Sharing a photo of the hilarious blunder on social media, one viewer tweeted: "What the hell happened in the boardroom?! Is that guy okay?"</p>
      <p>Another wrote: "Sorry but who is this man? And why is he lying on the floor? #TheApprentice."</p>

      <p>A third asked: "Why is there a guy lying on the floor in The Apprentice as they walk out the door?"</p>
      <p>Luckily Pamela, who survived another week on the BBC show, took to her Instagram page to reveal what was going on.</p>
      <p>She explained that the man was a member of production, typing: "Ha ha, OMG that was production pressing play on the videos."</p>

      <p>So not one of Lord Sugar's latest victims then...</p>
      <p>In the latest episode of the entertainment show, the teams were asked to put together a campaign to encourage summer tourism in Finland, which included making a digital billboard and video.</p>
      <p>After putting herself forward for team leader, Jemelin Artigas became the seventh casualty of the boardroom after her LGBT-themed travel idea failed to impress.</p>
      <p>This year, The Apprentice has been accused of favouring white contestants by some critics, who couldn't help noticing that six out of seven of the contestants fired so far have been from ethnic minorities.</p>

      <p>Souleyman Bah claimed he experienced racism on the show, while Lottie Lion is said to have called rival Lubna Farhan 'Gandhi' in a WhatsApp chat.</p>
      <p>Venezuelan Jemelin, however, insisted that Lord Sugar is not racist.</p>
