      <p>The lewd leak of Pakistani pop singer <a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201911041077222650-pakistani-singer-rabi-pirzada-quits-showbiz-after-twitter-gets-flooded-with-her-x--rated-videos/">Rabi Pirzada</a>’s photos and videos has triggered a social media campaign, with women posting their nudes along with the hashtags #IamRabiPizada and #SupportRabiPirzada.</p>
      <p>Mumbai-based Pakistani-Afghan actress <a href="https://twitter.com/MalishaOfficial/status/1194254872985473025?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1194254872985473025&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fsputniknews.com%2F_editorial_preview_%2Fasia%2F20191114%2F1077305613%2F">Malisha Heena</a> and Ishika Borah, who describes herself as “India’s only original pornstar” in her Twitter bio, have created special Twitter accounts to share their <a href="https://twitter.com/IshikaBOfficial/status/1194240969740152833?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1194240969740152833&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fsputniknews.com%2F_editorial_preview_%2Fasia%2F20191114%2F1077305613%2F">nude photographs</a> in a bid to show solidarity with Rabi.</p>
      <p>Days after the pictures spread online like a wildfire, the singer announced her decision to <a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201911041077222650-pakistani-singer-rabi-pirzada-quits-showbiz-after-twitter-gets-flooded-with-her-x--rated-videos/">quit the show business</a> and start a new life.</p>
      <p>She shared the pictures of “<a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201911111077281242-controversial-pakistani-singer-rabi-pirzada-announces-new-beginning-after-quitting-showbiz/">self-drawn sketches” of the Mecca Madina</a>, the Muslim pilgrimage centre in Saudi Arabia, in an apparent attempt to atone for her sins #savesoul.</p>

      <p>The singer has been top-trending news in Pakistan for days, with people criticising her for recording less-than-PG videos. Some are also coming up with various theories, speculating on the reasons behind the leaked pictures and videos. </p>
      <p>However, it is still unclear how her pictures made their way to cyberspace, but several people have suggested that she is a victim of revenge porn, while many have called it a political conspiracy.</p>
      <p>Earlier, Rabi had threatened to kill Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi over his decision on Kashmir by wearing a suicide vest in a picture and in another video <a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201909181076832928-after-snake-threat-to-indian-pm-pakistani-singer-now-says-her-lions-will-devour-him/">threatened to kill</a> him with snakes, a lion, and an alligator.</p>
