      <h2>Sheffield Wednesday have been charged after an investigation into their finances by the EFL</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T16:48:44+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 16:48</time> by <a rel="author">Rich Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/rich-jones/</a></address>
      <p>The EFL have confirmed they have charged Sheffield Wednesday with a breach of financial rules following an investigation into their 2017/18 season.</p>
      <p>An <a href="https://www.efl.com/news/2019/november/efl-statement-sheffield-wednesday-charged/">EFL statement read</a> : "Following a formal investigation into financial information provided by Sheffield Wednesday in relation to the Club’s 2017/18 Profitability and Sustainability (P&amp;S) submission, the EFL has today issued a number of charges relating to alleged breaches of EFL Rules.</p>
      <p>"Earlier this year the EFL launched an investigation into the Club’s financial submission for the period ending July 2018 under the relevant P&amp;S Rules following the completion of the sale of Hillsborough Stadium.</p>
      <p>"The EFL has reviewed a large number of documents obtained from the Club as part of this process and concluded there is sufficient evidence to justify issuing charges of Misconduct. The charges are in respect of a number of allegations regarding the process of how and when the stadium was sold and the inclusion of the profits in the 2017/18 accounts.</p>

      <p>"All charges will be considered by an independent Disciplinary Commission and, if the charges are proven, the Commission can impose any of the sanctions set out in EFL Regulation 92.2.</p>
      <p>"The EFL Board has previously agreed and communicated with all Championship Clubs a set of sanctioning guidelines, but the Commission, under EFL Regulations, has the ability to invoke a full range of sanctions should the breach be confirmed.</p>
      <p>"The EFL continues to review the Club’s 2018/19 P&amp;S submissions.</p>
      <p>"As these matters are now subject to proceedings, the EFL will be making no further comment at this time."</p>
      <p>Sheffield Wednesday swiftly responded with a statement saying they will contest the charges.</p>
      <p>Their statement read: "Sheffield Wednesday note the statement issued today by the EFL and the charges contained within."</p>
      <p>"These charges will be vigorously defended and the Club will be making no further comment at this time."</p>
