      <h1>How to Design Product Pages that Increase Online Sales</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T16:00:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 16:00</time> by <a rel="author">Colleen M. Harmeling, Alexander Bleier, Robert W. Palmatier</a></address>
      <p>No matter the size of your brand or the nature of your product, Amazon provides a storefront with access to millions of potential customers every day. But with hundreds of millions of products on display, competition is fierce. Sales depend not only on having superior offerings but also on how effectively product webpages create customer experiences that convert visitors into buyers. The question is, How do you create these kinds of experiences on Amazon?</p>
      <p><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0022242918809930">Our research</a> shows that carefully orchestrating the content on your product’s Amazon page is the key to boosting sales. Importantly, the online customer experience is about more than just conveying product information. It must also entertain, provide a human touch, and mimic the sensory sensations that products evoke in the offline world. Moreover, although designing product pages with a cookie-cutter approach may seem appealing when you have hundreds (or thousands) of products to sell, our research suggests that one-size-fits-all designs no longer work.</p>
      <p>To succeed on Amazon, companies must design pages that create the most effective customer experience for their products or brands. Our studies show that the type of page design that will most resonate with your customers depends on two primary criteria: (1) the trustworthiness of your brand and (2) the degree to which customers can evaluate the product by reading about it rather than experiencing it (for example, by touching it or trying it on). With this in mind, we found that a single design element on an Amazon page, when used effectively, can increase purchase intentions up to 10% — a substantial amount in today’s competitive online retail environment.</p>
      <p>To study the best ways to design pages for specific brands and products, we ran 16 experiments in the lab and one in the field.</p>
      <h4>Our Methodology</h4>
      <p>To identify the most important design elements, we reviewed 10 years of research on website design published in top academic journals, and conducted interviews with industry experts. We focused on design elements that relate directly to the product presentation on a webpage and are typically available to firms selling through retailers like Amazon. We excluded website-level structural elements, such as navigation, menus, icons, and overall organization, that are outside firms’ control. Our sample of brands and products was from four Fortune 1000 manufacturers and covered a broad range of industries such as consumer electronics, supplements, and CPGs. To test the effects of these pages, we recruited 10,470 consumers through Amazon Mechanical Turk. We presented each participant at random with one of the 256 mockup Amazon product pages and asked them to view the page in detail. Participants then responded to a series of questions about their perception of the page as well as their propensity to purchase the product.</p>
      <p>For the lab studies, we leveraged a Taguchi experimental design that allowed us to test the effects of 13 design elements (such as picture size, linguistic style of text, descriptive detail, and product video) for 16 real-world products. The products were from 11 real brands, and we created 256 look-alike Amazon product pages to run the tests in a controlled lab setting. We recruited over 10,000 participants and showed each of them one of the mockup product pages, asking them about their perception of the page and how likely they were to buy the product.</p>
      <p>Through these experiments, we found that online customer experiences have four dimensions: informative, entertaining, social, and sensory. While the entertainment aspect generally has the strongest influence on purchase (followed by the informative, social, and sensory aspects), the relevance of each dimension depends on the specific product and brand. For example, with <i>search products,</i> those that customers can shop for by evaluating factual information about them, we found that a more informative experience can increase sales, while a more social experience — one that that emphasizes a webpage’s warmth, sociability, and human touch — may suppress sales. By contrast, <i>experience products</i>, those that typically require a customer to physically examine them, benefit from a more social and sensory experience.</p>
      <p>Our collaboration with our partnering firm allowed us to validate some of our findings by running a field experiment on Amazon.com to test real-world sales. We selected three search products (wireless internet routers) with similar characteristics and historic sales trends from our partner firm’s inventory. We adapted the Amazon pages of two products to be either more informative or more social and left the third page unchanged as a control condition. For the next four weeks, we observed the daily sales of all three products. A corresponding difference-in-differences analysis confirmed our insights from the lab: Search products benefit from a more informative experience but not from a more social experience.</p>
      <p>The result of our studies led us to create a “design guide” that, in just three steps, can help companies increase their sales in online retail environments such as Amazon.</p>
      <h3>Step 1: Know Your Brand and Product</h3>
      <p>Before starting to build an Amazon page for any of your products, you should ask two questions:</p>
      <p><b>How much do current and potential customers trust your brand? </b>Knowing your brand’s trustworthiness will help you estimate customers’ uncertainty when they decide whether to purchase your product. The best way to measure your brand’s trustworthiness is to directly ask a sample of consumers. In our research, we surveyed people with statements such as: “[Brand] seems to have much knowledge about what needs to be done to fulfill online transactions”; “[Brand] appears to be well qualified in the area of e-commerce”; “[Brand] appears to try hard to be fair in dealing with others”; and “Sound principles seem to guide [Brand]’s behavior.” Participants responded on a scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree).</p>
      <p><b>How easily does your product convert to an online selling format? </b>Some products lend themselves more naturally than others to online selling. Take, for example, clothing and electronics. A customer searching for a blouse likely wants a sense of how the item will look and feel. By contrast, a customer shopping for a wireless internet router is interested in product specs and how its features compare with similar routers’, which are easily presented through text. Clothing, food, and beauty items are examples of experience products; wireless routers, books, and board games are search products. Whatever your product is, determining what type of experience customers are looking for and catering to those expectations will maximize the effectiveness of your online sales efforts.</p>
      <h3>Step 2: Inventory and Audit Your Design Assets</h3>
      <p>Before you create the product page in Step 3, where we detail which elements you need to deploy and when, it is important to figure out which design assets you have available. It’s easy to treat Amazon product pages as an afterthought, and simply recycle text and images from your other sites. While reusing assets such as product descriptions, pictures, or videos is a good way to start, your Amazon page doesn’t always need all available elements. Depending on your product, some just might not be necessary, and others should be avoided.</p>
      <p>And there may be additional elements that would be useful if you had them. New content can be costly to create (think for instance of product videos) and should be invested in only if it will contribute to the right kind of customer experience for your product. For example, when selling a wireless internet router, employing a conversational tone and glossy pictures of people using the product might be distracting and detrimental to the product’s sales. Rather, you might want to focus on developing comparison charts that allow customers to quickly assess product specs.</p>
      <h3>Step 3: Create the Customer Experience</h3>
      <p>To create the most effective online experiences, you should remember that, in general, entertainment exerts the strongest effects on customer purchase, followed by the informative, social, and sensory aspects of the customer experience. To determine which aspects to strengthen, combine product and brand knowledge (Step 1) with an assessment of your digital assets (Step 2). Begin by auditing your current pages to see how they match up with the recommendations below. Next, determine which approach is right for you to boost sales.</p>
      <p><b>If you’re selling a search product…</b><br/>Strengthen the informational aspects of your product page. When shopping for search products, consumers can gather the information they need to make a decision from the page’s text and visual elements. To build a more informative product page, you should:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use text blocks that detail the products’ important attributes, such as size, functions, or uses</li>
        <li>Use several bulleted features to summarize and emphasize product information</li>
        <li>Add charts that compare the product with similar products along relevant criteria (attributes, warranties, compatibilities, etc.)</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>If you’re selling an experience product…</b><br/>Strengthen the social and/or the sensory aspects of your product page. Online shoppers often have high purchase uncertainty about experience products, since they cannot touch, feel, or directly interact with them. Simply providing more product information does not always solve this problem. Instead, provide sensory-based signals or signals that convey social, human elements.</p>
      <p>To strengthen the social aspect, you should:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Describe the product in a personable manner, through a conversational style that uses adjectives, (“Wouldn’t you like faster internet?”), and pronouns (“you,” “your”)</li>
        <li>Add lifestyle photos that show the product in use; if possible, feature human actors</li>
        <li>Directly display all relevant information; avoid “show more” buttons, which require the customer to decide how much content appears on the page</li>
      </ul>
      <p>To strengthen sensory aspects, you should:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Add a video to display the product in an appealing, engaging way</li>
        <li>Include a cropped photo that highlights a key attribute of the product by zooming in on it; this helps shoppers better understand the product and its features</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>If your brand is trusted…</b><br/>Here, too, strengthen the informational aspects of your product page. The more trusted your brand is, the more consumers will find information relevant and helpful for their decision making. To build a more informative page, you should:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use text blocks that detail the products’ important attributes, such as size, functions, or uses</li>
        <li>Use several bulleted features to summarize and emphasize product information</li>
        <li>Add charts that compare the product with similar products along relevant criteria (attributes, warranties, compatibilities, etc.)</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>If your brand isn’t trusted…</b><br/>Strengthen the entertainment aspect of your product page. An entertaining page can often overcome the uncertainty that people feel toward an unknown or less-trusted brand. Entertainment is also helpful when consumers might rely more on emotional cues and feelings than on product information. Some simple ways to strengthen the entertainment aspect:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Increase the size of product pictures</li>
        <li>Highlight customer star ratings</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Using these guidelines to build the most effective customer experience for each of your brands and products can give you an edge in the competitive online retail environment. After all, customers have many, many choices when buying products. If your product pages don’t attract them, a competitor’s will.</p>
