      <p>It’s been <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/neon-indian-ann-3/">five years</a> since Alan Palomo released a <b>Neon Indian</b> album — he’s been dabbling in <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/neon-indian-announces-fall-north-american-tour/">film</a> since then — but things are stirring in his world now. He’s <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/neon-indian-announces-fall-north-american-tour/">on tour as we speak</a>, and he’s just shared this new single that has that familiar, nostalgic chillwave vibe, as well as a pretty cool video that he directed himself that co-stars a paper mache Donald Trump.</p>
      <p>“‘Toyota Man’ was filmed along the road map of what essentially was my path to American citizenship: Monterrey, the Nuevo Laredo border, San Antonio, and finally Austin,” says Alan. “The process is a multiple decade commute known by many Latinos and other Americans. Though my music has always been generally apolitical, I realized when recording this song that it was impossible to write biographically (in the rhetorical context of the Trump administration) without being entirely that: political. The story of my family, which before felt commonly American, was suddenly politicized. Recognizing the absurdity of it all, I thought it would be refreshing to address the social narrative around immigration through comedy – nods to Benny Hill, misremembered San Antonio car commercials, and School House Rock.” There’s a little nod to “Subterranean Homesick Blues” in there, too. You can watch the video below.</p>
      <p>Neon Indian’s <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/neon-indian-announces-fall-north-american-tour/">tour</a> kicks off tonight with a sold-out show at Brooklyn’s Elsewhere and he’ll be back at <b>Elsewhere for a New Year’s Eve DJ set</b> with <b>Amtrac</b>, <b>Sybil Jason</b> and <b>Half Moon</b> (<a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/elsewhere-nye-w-neon-indian-dj-set-amtrac-tiki-disco-sybil-jason-half-moon-sean-sato-elsewhere-tickets-70534307011?aff=ebdssbdestsearch">tickets</a>).
