      <p>Woot is currently <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/best-cell-phone-deals">selling</a> the Pixel 2 XL for just $265, meaning you can buy a really great phone at a really great price right now.</p>
      <p>The Pixel 2 XL is about two years old now, but it's still one of the best phones out there. Which is kind of insane. It will continue to get updates for another year (or longer) as well as security updates for a couple more years. That's definitely good to see.</p>
      <p>And it also still has that insane camera that Google is known for now. That's thanks to the Pixel Visual Core that's inside, making that 12-megapixel camera really impressive. And it is still getting updates.</p>

      <p>The Pixel 2 XL sports a 6-inch Quad HD+ OLED display, powered by the Snapdragon 835 chipset, with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. There is also a sizeable 3520mAh battery inside. This is going to get you through the day, for the most part. Though you may need to charge it at some point, depending on how much you use your phone.</p>
      <p>This phone is one of the favorites from 2017, and it's not hard to see why. Besides the quick updates to the next version of Android and the incredible camera that the Pixel 2 XL has, for just $265, this is a no-brainer. Especially if you are looking for a new phone that won't cost an arm and a leg.</p>
      <p>Woot is selling the Google Pixel 2 XL in both black and white, as well as black. The Black and White model is what many refer to as the "Panda" color, and the one that everyone wants Google to bring back.</p>
