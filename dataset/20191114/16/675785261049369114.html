      <h2>Marco seems to have put his partying days behind him as he welcomed his newborn daughter this morning</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T16:31:18+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 16:31</time> by <a rel="author">Verity Sulway, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/verity-sulway/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/marco-pierre-white">Marco Pierre White Junior</a> has released the first ever photos of his newborn daughter as his girlfriend gave birth via C-section.</p>
      <p>Their first child is named Arabella Rosa and she was born at 11:34am today, weighing 7.4oz.</p>
      <p>Delighted dad Marco, whose father is celebrity chef Marco Pierre White, posted several photos and videos of him cuddling his gorgeous baby, who was sporting an adorable knitted white hat.</p>
      <p>Marco, 24, appeared in <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/celebrity-big-brother">Celebrity</a> <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/big-brother">Big Brother</a> in 2016, and has since grabbed headlines with his drug taking and wild partying behaviour, including a cocaine-fuelled night with a prostitute he documented on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> .</p>

      <p>But it seem these days are behind him as he becomes a dedicated father to Arabella, and his excitement in the lead up to the C-section was palpable.</p>
      <p>This morning the heavily tattooed hunk posted a beaming photo with the caption: "It's the big day not long until I meet my little angel".</p>
      <p>He also posted a photo the night before where he kissed his girlfriend's bump and wrote "not long left".</p>

      <p>The identity of his girlfriend is not yet known, but Marco has said she isn't his ex and was someone he had met a year ago.</p>
      <p>Dressed in hospital scrubs, Marco planted a kiss on his newborn's head while she was swaddled in a blanket.</p>
      <p>He also posted a video with his girlfriend's sister who he covered in kisses and delighted in telling her she was an auntie.</p>

      <p>He told fans the birth went incredibly well, and that his girlfriend was sleeping while Arabella had just had her first feed and then cuddled up to her dad.</p>
      <p>Arabella already owns a puppy which her dad bought for her before she was born.</p>
      <p>Marco shared a clip of him cuddling up to a tiny puppy on Instagram, saying: "So I just bought this little puppy for my daughter.</p>

      <p>"A little Chihuahua.</p>
      <p>"I'm gonna spoil the f*** out of my girls," he vowed.</p>
      <p>He appears to have made an attempt to clean up his act, swapping his party ­lifestyle for the country life at his dad's ­Wiltshire farm last year and has been attending rehab.</p>

      <p>But in September last year he was seen snorting a white substance on a park bench with his then girlfriend Francesca Suter close by.</p>
      <p>Marco Senior, 56, supported his son during a battle with drink and drugs which saw him blow £250,000 on a binge in Ibiza when he was just 16.</p>
      <p>Arabella is Marco Senior's first grandchild.</p>
