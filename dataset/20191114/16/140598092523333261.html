      <h1>Priceless Rembrandts recovered in undergrowth after raid at London gallery</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T16:12:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 16:12</time> by <a rel="author">Martin Evans, CRIME CORRESPONDENT , Jamie Johnson</a></address>
      <p>Two priceless Rembrandt paintings are feared damaged after they were found dumped in the soaking, muddy undergrowth following a heist from a south London art gallery.</p>
      <p>Police were continuing to hunt the brazen thief, who is thought to have targeted the world famous works of art in order to claim a ransom from insurers.</p>
      <p>The paintings were stolen on Wednesday night from the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/culturepicturegalleries/8173355/Dulwich-Picture-Gallery-Masterpiece-a-Month.html">Dulwich Picture Gallery,</a> which has been hosting a major Rembrandt exhibition featuring more than 30 priceless works by the Dutch Master.</p>
      <p>Although police and the gallery refused to confirm which two works had been targeted, the exhibition included some of his most famous paintings, including Girl at a Window and The Pilgrims at Emmaus, which was on loan from The Louvre and was being displayed in the UK for the first time.</p>
      <p>While the thief managed to get out of the gallery with the paintings, he abandoned them in the grounds after realising he had triggered the alarm.</p>
      <p>They were recovered by police and security staff, but were being assessed by experts as to any potential damage that might have been caused.</p>
      <p>The break in occurred at around 11.30pm on Wednesday night when the thief entered the grounds of the gallery and managed to force entry into the building.</p>
      <p>The Dulwich Picture Gallery, which was set up in 1817 and is England’s oldest public art gallery, has been the scene of a number of heists in the past, most famously in 1966, when eight paintings, including three by Rembrandt were stolen.</p>
      <p>The gallery also has the inglorious accolade of an entry in the Guinness Book of Records for being the custodian of the most stolen picture in the world - a little Rembrandt portrait which had been stolen four times, most recently in the 1980s.</p>
      <p>The painting was so well known in the international art world that thieves found it impossible to sell.</p>
      <p>It was once recovered from then West Germany, returned anonymously once, on another occasion found on the back of a bicycle and then under a bench in a graveyard in Streatham, south London. Nobody was charged with any of the thefts.</p>

      <p>During the latest raid, the thief triggered an alarm and police arrived at the scene just after 11.30pm and spotted the suspect in the grounds.</p>
      <p>An officer gave chase but when he was challenged the suspect turned and sprayed him in the face with an unknown substance, before successfully making his escape.</p>
      <p>The officer, who was unhurt, then began searching the grounds and discovered one of the paintings abandoned close by.</p>
      <p>A short time later the other missing painting was found by security staff hidden in shrubbery within the grounds of the gallery.</p>
      <p>Christopher Marinello, one of the world's foremost experts in recovering stolen works of art, said the Rembrandts are likely to have been taken as part of a plot to recover an insurance payout.</p>
      <p>He explained: “In 30-years of working in this field I have only ever come across one incident in which a world famous work of art was stolen to order. </p>
      <p>“It is far more likely that this was an opportunistic thief who recognised that Rembrandts are valuable and was hoping to recover some sort of reward.</p>
      <p>Art historian and presenter of the BBC’s Britain’s Lost Masterpieces Bendor Grosvenor agreed and said the idea that it had been stolen to order by a wealthy art lover was fanciful.</p>
      <p>He said: “We have this idea from Hollywood that there are crazy art lovers out there who want a particular masterpiece for their downstairs loo, but that is not really realistic.</p>
      <p>“It is more likely that the thief was intending to try to claim a ransom because unfortunately in the art world there is a habit of people being willing to pay to recover priceless items.”</p>
      <p>In a statement a spokesman for the Dulwich Picture Gallery said: "Last night intruders attempted to remove two paintings from Dulwich Picture Gallery’s 'Rembrandt’s Light’ exhibition.</p>
      <p>"The intruders were detected by the gallery’s robust security systems and, thanks to the immediate intervention of security staff and the swift response of the Metropolitan Police, the paintings were secured at the scene.</p>
      <p>"The exhibition and gallery will remain closed until further notice, to allow the police to conduct a full investigation into the incident."</p>
      <p>A gallery spokesperson added that they were pleased to have the pieces back in their care there was concern about potential damage. </p>
      <p>“Our senior experts and advisors are working with curators to assess the intrusions on the paintings,” the spokesman said.</p>

      <p>Although the gallery would not confirm what if any damage had been done, the wet weather and muddy ground has sparked fears for their condition if they had been ditched by the perpetrator.</p>
      <p>Detective Inspector Jason Barber from the Flying Squad said: “This was an audacious attempted burglary and was clearly planned in advance. </p>
      <p>"Two paintings in the exhibition were targeted and it was only down to the prompt response of gallery security staff and the courage and swift intervention of officers that these two works of art were not stolen. </p>
      <p>"Thankfully both the paintings were quickly recovered and secured. Our enquiries now centre on finding whoever was responsible for this crime and I would ask anyone with information to call police.”</p>
      <p>Last night more than a dozen police officers could be seen combing through damp undergrowth around the gallery searching for evidence.  </p>
