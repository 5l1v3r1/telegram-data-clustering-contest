      <h1>PayPal stops processing payments for "over a hundred thousand" Pornhub performers</h1>
      <h2>Cryptocurrency could offer the anonymity that performers desire</h2>

      <h4>In a nutshell: Pornhub for many is little more than a seemingly endless supply of adult content but for some of the site’s performers, it is a platform that helps pay the bills and put food on the table. Now thanks to a recent decision by payment processor PayPal, many will have to go about collecting their earnings in a different manner.</h4>
      <p>Pornhub in a recent blog post <a href="https://www.pornhub.com/blog/9122">said</a> they are devastated by PayPal’s decision to stop payouts “to over a hundred thousand performers.”</p>
      <p>Models that got paid via PayPal are being asked to select a new payment method and update their information ASAP. Those with pending payments for October should contact Pornhub directly to get the matter resolved.</p>
      <p>The company said it is working around the clock to make sure all payouts are processed ASAP. Payments should start going out by the end of the week, we’re told.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for PayPal told <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/d3abgv/paypal-pulls-out-of-pornhub-payments">Motherboard</a> that after a review, they discovered Pornhub made “certain business payments through PayPal without seeking our permission.” The spokesperson added that they have taken action to stop such transactions from occurring.</p>
      <p>Pornhub offers the option of direct deposit but this is a risky alternative as many banks won’t do business with people if they know money is coming from a frowned upon industry like adult entertainment. <a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/74198-pornhub-now-accept-verge-cryptocurrency-payment-premium-features.html">Cryptocurrency</a> is another option that may gain a larger following thanks to the anonymity it affords.</p>
