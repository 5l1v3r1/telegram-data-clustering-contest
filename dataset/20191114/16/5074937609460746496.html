      <h1>Farmers in Binduri District get good harvest</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T16:45:48+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 16:45</time> by <a rel="author">Jerry Azanduna, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Binduri (UE) Nov. 14, GNA – About 10,058 farmers in the Binduri District, Upper East Region, who benefited from the Planting for Food and Jobs (PFJs) programme had a good harvest in the various staple crops they harvested.</p>
      <p>Under the programme, the farmers had access to subsidised farm inputs such as fertilizer, improved seeds and cashew seedlings that encouraged them to cultivate large farms.</p>
      <p>Mr Yakubu Ayinga Abagre, the District Chief Executive for the area, said this at Binduri when he met the press and some farmers to brief them on the progress of development in the district.</p>
      <p>Mr Abagre said as part of effort to promote food security in the area and the region at large, the district assembly with support from government would continue to empower farmers with the needed support including; loans, farm inputs such as fertilizer and seedlings and life skills training for good farming practices.</p>
      <p>Mr Abagre indicated that government would soon be furnishing the warehouse project in the district to help farmers to store and preserve farm products for local consumption and export, saying “this is the best way to fight food insecurity and promote quality livelihood conditions for the people”.</p>
      <p>He underscored the need for dry season farming and said the 10 dams allocated to the district under the one village, one dam project were near completion and would be used to irrigate farms this dry season.</p>
      <p>Mr Abagre said the district would soon be benefiting from a processing factory to be constructed under the one district, one factory programme, to process farm produce into final consumable products to safe farmers from post- harvest loses, which was a worry over the years. </p>
      <p>He urged the youth in the area to take the opportunity provided by the government programmes to engage in viable and profitable ventures that would improve their livelihood.</p>
