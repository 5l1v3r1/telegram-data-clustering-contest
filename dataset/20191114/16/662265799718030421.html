      <p>While the X-T2 underwent its latest revision last year to the X-T3, upgrading from a 24MP sensor and X Processor Pro (among other things) and the X-T30 following shortly after, the X-Pro line, meanwhile, remained unchanged from the X-Pro2 of 2016. That finally changed last month with the announcement of the <a href="https://www.imaging-resource.com/PRODS/fuji-x-pro3/fuji-x-pro3A.HTM">Fuji X-Pro3</a>. Like its <a href="https://www.imaging-resource.com/PRODS/fuji-x-pro3/fuji-x-pro3A.HTM">X-T3</a> and <a href="https://www.imaging-resource.com/PRODS/fuji-x-t30/fuji-x-t30A.HTM">X-T30</a> siblings, the new rangefinder-styled X Series camera sports the latest Fujifilm X Series imaging pipeline -- a 26MP BSI X-Tran APS-C sensor, latest-gen X Processor 4 imaging processor and high-performance 425-point hybrid AF system. Image quality, therefore, is unsurprisingly similar to these other APS-C X Series cameras. The X-Pro3 offers the same ISO range, too -- a native range of ISO 160 - 12,800, with an expandable low ISO 80 and high ISOs up to ISO 51,200.</p>
      <p>However, there's some dramatic physical and cosmetic updates to the X-Pro3. The general shape remains the same, but the body construction employs a new mixture of magnesium alloy for the chassis and titanium for the top and bottom plates. As before, the X-Pro3 offers thorough weather sealing, unlike the more compact X100F. Most striking, however, is the redesigned rear LCD, which uses a single-axis flip-down design for a hidden rear LCD and a non-backlit info panel display on the exterior surface. It's a unique design change, not found elsewhere on other X Series cameras. The usefulness of this design remains to be seen, and we're curious to get the new X-Pro3 out for some real world testing.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, we've completed our lab series of First Shots, our traditional ISO series of lab sample images. As always, our First Shots series uses a standard still life scene, allowing for a standardized comparison series of images across the camera's full ISO range. Of course, we have straight-from-camera JPEGs and RAW files for download, as well as ISO series shots with default noise reduction and NR processing set to its lowest-possible setting. For the full selection of sample images, check out our <a href="https://www.imaging-resource.com/PRODS/fuji-x-pro3/fuji-x-pro3A7.HTM">Fuji X-Pro3 Samples Page</a>, or to begin your own side-by-side comparison testing, use our handy <a href="https://www.imaging-resource.com/IMCOMP/COMPS01.HTM">Comparometer</a>.</p>
