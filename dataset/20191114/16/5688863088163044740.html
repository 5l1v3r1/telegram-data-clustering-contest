        <b>Former Australia international Ian Chappell has voiced his concern about the mental health issues troubling Aussie cricketers as it has reached an alarming state. Glenn Maxwell, Nic Maddinson and Will Pucovski stepping down for the same is what brought the issue to the limelight.</b>
      </p>
      <p>It seems like the world is finally taking mental health issues after as many as three top flight Aussie cricketers took a brake from the sport to nurse their mental well-being. While <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/glenn_maxwell">Glenn Maxwell</a> was the first to step down, he was followed by youngsters Nic Maddinson and Will Pucovski joined him on the sidelines for similar reasons. </p>
      <p>The former Australian International Ian Chappell has come forth to voice his concern about the sorry state of the mental health of the Kangaroos. Chappell said that it’s a grave problem as he shared that it has reached an alarming state.</p>
      <p>"It’s a helluva problem. It’s almost epidemic proportions. It’s all well and good to be saying it’s very courageous of these guys to come out and speak and yes, it is brave, but Cricket Australia has got to get to the bottom of what’s causing this,” Sportstar quoted Chappell.</p>
      <p>Pucovski, the latest addition to the list, also had taken a couple of similar brakes last summer to get his mental health right. He went on to inform the selectors about he being unavailable for Test selection citing mental health issues. Pucovski, who hit 243 for Victoria in a Sheffield Shield game against Western Australia last year, also withdrew from the Test squad against Sri Lanka last February for the same reason.</p>
      <p>Cricket Australia head of national team’s Ben Oliver supported Pucovski on his decision as he went to point how brave he is to make the call.</p>
      <p>"Will’s decision not to nominate for Test selection was the right one in the circumstances and one that everyone in the Australian cricket family supports. By Will bravely taking this position, he will undoubtedly inspire others facing similar challenges to speak up and take positive steps towards improving their mental wellbeing," Oliver said.</p>
      <p>Maxwell, who has played 110 one-day internationals, 61 T20Is and seven Tests, is on an indefinite break from cricket after pulling out midway through the Twenty20 series against Sri Lanka last month, where he seemed to be in great touch.</p>
      <p>India skipper <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/virat_kohli">Virat Kohli</a> came out in support of the Australian all rounder and hailed his decision as remarkable as he shared his own scuffle with such issues when he returned after a horrible series in England back in 2014. Kohli went to say that he didn’t even know how to communicate his situation.</p>
      <p>Maddinson, who played three Tests in 2016, withdrew from this week’s Australia A match on mental health grounds.</p>
      <p>In England, there have been players like Steve Harmison, Marcus Trescothick and Graeme Fowler, who have dealt with depression.</p>
