      <p>The Kardashian family is facing backlash from fans after sharing a clip from an upcoming episode of <i>Keeping Up with the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/kardashians">Kardashians</a> </i>that shows them having a food fight. </p>
      <p>In the clip, shared on Instagram by Khloe, the family can be seen laughing as they throw entire trays of food at one another during a sit-down meal outside.</p>
      <p>Speaking during a confessional, Khloe says: “Am I bothered by this food fight right now? Who the f*** wouldn’t be bothered by this? This is, in any normal person’s world, bizarre, disturbing and unacceptable.”</p>
      <p>Khloe then tells her family: “If anyone’s comfortable with this I’m gonna question them. This is no way to live,” to which her mother Kris responds: “No, this is no way to live. But if you can laugh at this and breathe then I think you’re doing A-OK.”</p>
      <p>However, not everyone was amused by the clip, with many people accusing the Kardashians of being “insensitive” and making light of the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/food-waste">food waste</a>. </p>

      <p>“Makes me cringe to think of all the food wasted,” one person commented. </p>
      <p>Another said: “Meanwhile there are people out there who have no money to buy food…”</p>
      <p>Others questioned why the family, who are worth billions, would record the “disturbing” scene.</p>
      <p>“Why would you even put this on camera when you know that this is completely wrong?” someone asked</p>
      <p>Despite the criticism, some fans came to the defence of the reality family, pointing out that many members of the Kardashian family engage in community service.</p>
      <p>In addition to regularly <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/kanye-west-kim-kardashian-birthday-charity-present-donate-justice-reform-prison-a9166991.html">donating</a> to charities, Kim has been <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/kim-kardashian-trump-prisoners-first-step-act-white-house-alice-mare-johnson-a8903781.html">lobbying</a> on behalf of criminal justice reform, while both Kylie and Kendall have raised awareness for various social causes.</p>
