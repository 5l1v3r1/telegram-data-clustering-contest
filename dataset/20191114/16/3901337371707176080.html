      <p>Kante has been a long-time target for Los Blancos boss Zinedine Zidane, and was previously the subject of a reported verbal agreement between his club and the LaLiga giants.</p>
      <p>In terms of that agreement, Chelsea are said to have given Real first option to sign the 2018 FIFA World Cup winner, sparking speculation that a bid would be imminent.</p>

      <p>"No, not really," Kante replied when asked by <i>Telefoot</i> if he could see himself playing in another league.</p>
      <p>"… Today I am with Chelsea until 2023. So, in my head, I hope to continue to have great seasons with Chelsea until 2023."</p>
