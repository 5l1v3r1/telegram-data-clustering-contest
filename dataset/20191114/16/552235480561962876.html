      <h1>Wishaw named one of the luckiest places to play the lottery in the UK</h1>
      <h2>“When I did and it told me that we’d won £1 million I thought the app must be broken."</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T16:15:56+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 16:15</time> by <a rel="author">Wishaw Press, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/wishaw-press/</a></address>
      <p>Motherwell and Wishaw residents could be quid’s in after being revealed as one of the luckiest in the UK.</p>
      <p>According to the National Lottery, the ML postcode has seen 53 people become millionaires since it launched in 1994.</p>
      <p>In total, The National Lottery has seen a whopping 270 top tier prizes of at least £50,000 banked by players in and around the Motherwell and Wishaw area.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>In the last three years alone, 42 high tier prizes have been won.</p>
      <p>This makes the postcode the fourth luckiest for big wins per head of adult population out of all 121 UK postcodes.</p>
      <p>Local winners who have shared news of their win recently include The Winning Nurses syndicate who scooped £1 million in the EuroMillions UK Millionaire Maker draw in April 2018.</p>
      <p>The group of 15 nurses, who all worked together at Cleland Hospital, each took home £66,666.</p>
      <p>Syndicate member June Fraser was in charge of checking the tickets.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>She said: “I checked the tickets using the app on Saturday morning.</p>
      <p>“I scanned the first one and it wasn’t a winner – I actually thought that was the ticket for Friday night’s draw and very nearly didn’t scan the second one as I thought it was for a future draw.</p>
      <p>“When I did and it told me that we’d won £1 million I thought the app must be broken.</p>
      <p>“My first phone call was to my ward where I managed to get hold of two of the other members who were working. I phoned a few other members but I was just too hyper to call everyone at that point. I still went into work that afternoon!”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Andy Carter, Senior Winners’ Advisor at The National Lottery, added: “The Motherwell postcode has certainly enjoyed lots of luck with a staggering 270 prizes of at least £50,000 won across the area since we launched.</p>
      <p>“The Winning Nurses are a fantastic example of a winning syndicate and how winning can transform your life. Over the last 25 years, The National Lottery has been making amazing things happen.</p>
      <p>“Thanks to our players, 565,000 Good Cause grants have been given to projects big and small.”</p>
