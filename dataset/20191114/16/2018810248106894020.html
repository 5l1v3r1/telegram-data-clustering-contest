      <p>John Carmack, the legendary iD programmer and chief technology officer for Oculus, has announced he's leaving the company to focus his efforts on artificial intelligence.</p>
      <p>In <a href="https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=2547632585471243&amp;id=100006735798590">a statement posted to Facebook</a>, Carmack said he would be moving to a 'Consulting CTO' position in Oculus and would still have "a voice in the development work."</p>

      <p>"When I think back over everything I have done across games, aerospace, and VR, I have always felt that I had at least a vague 'line of sight' to the solutions, even if they were unconventional or unproven," Carmack wrote on Facebook. "I have sometimes wondered how I would fare with a problem where the solution really isn't in sight. I decided that I should give it a try before I get too old."</p>
      <p>Oculus tweeted it was "glad [Carmack was] still on board to make VR magic happen."</p>
