      <h1>People in Wishaw urged to prepare for freezing temperatures over coming weeks</h1>
      <h2>There are more than 2700 grit bins and 80 vehicles ready to tackle the weather.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T16:48:47+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 16:48</time> by <a rel="author">Wishaw Press, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/wishaw-press/</a></address>
      <p>As the temperatures drop, North Lanarkshire Council is asking residents to take action to be prepared for the winter weather.</p>
      <p>Information and advice about keeping your home safe from frozen or burst pipes, the council’s gritting policy, winter proofing your business and looking after vulnerable neighbours is all available on the council’s website and on their social media pages.</p>
      <p>The council and its partner Amey monitor weather forecasts daily to assess when and where the road network should be salted.</p>
      <p>A fleet of 31 gritter lorries, 27 tractors with gritting and snow clearing capacity and 20 mini tractors with salting hoppers are available to treat roads and paths when required.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Across the council, 4x4 vehicles are available to cope with snowy and icy conditions, particularly to help home care teams reach elderly and vulnerable people in poor weather.</p>
      <p>More than 2,700 grit bins across the area have been filled for residents to help keep their local paths and streets clear. Schools have been provided with salt supplies to keep playgrounds and entrances clear of snow and ice.</p>
      <p>“Our gritter fleet has already been out treating the roads as the cold weather starts to affect us,” said Councillor Michael McPake, convener of the council’s Infrastructure Committee.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“At the council we are prepared for the winter ahead, with plans in place in schools, offices, on the roads and in communities to deal with the impact of the weather conditions. Our advice to residents and businesses is to take some time now to get ready before any severe weather arrives.</p>
      <p>“We would also ask residents to support elderly or vulnerable neighbours during the winter – just taking a few minutes to ask if they need any shopping or are warm and comfortable, could make all the difference.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The council has a clear priority system for treating roads and footpaths during winter; the main road network is treated first along with main roads around schools, access roads to hospitals, key police and fire stations, main bus routes and town centres.</p>
