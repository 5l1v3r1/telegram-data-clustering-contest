      <p>They are all taking part in a Strictly special for Children In Need, with Lytton already a veteran of the ballroom floor.</p>
      <p>She said of Barton’s successful run with partner Anton Du Beke: “I’ve been watching her, she’s doing so well.</p>
      <p>“I knew she would anyway, she’s so lovable and talented and she’s got Anton so I knew she’d be in safe hands.”</p>
      <p>Smith added: “She’s been absolutely slaying it. I saw her earlier and she said it was the perfect bit of reassurance that she needed – it was lovely to see her.”</p>
