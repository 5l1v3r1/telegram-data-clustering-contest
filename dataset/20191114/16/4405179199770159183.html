      <p>The HomePod is, like most Apple products, premium when compared to the competition. It costs £279 in the UK following a price reduction in April 2019, putting it in line with the likes of Google’s Home Max speaker.</p>
      <table bordered="">

        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>But why is the price so much higher than the competition? Apple has focused primarily on audio quality with the HomePod, offering premium-level room-filling audio that can be automatically tweaked depending on where the speaker is in the room.</p>
      <p>You’ve also got access to Siri, albeit a basic version that doesn’t quite match the functionality of Siri on iPhones, iPads and even Macs, and it’s one of very few smart speakers that offers integration with Apple’s streaming service, Apple Music.</p>
      <p>Plus, if you’ve got money burning a figurative hole in your pocket, you can pick up a second HomePod and connect them for stereo playback.</p>
      <p>If you want to find out more about the smart speaker before picking one up, take a look at our <a href="https://www.macworld.co.uk/review/hardware/homepod-review-3659435/">HomePod review</a>.

      <h3>Where to find HomePod deals</h3>
      <p>Generally speaking, Apple isn’t a company that joins in with the sales bonanzas, and it’s unlikely that the company will host a Black Friday 2019 sale later this month. But, while Apple doesn’t offer discounts on its range, other retailers do.</p>
      <p>We’ve seen the likes of Amazon, John Lewis and other UK retailers posting discounts and deals on must-have Apple products including the HomePod. You’ve even got UK carriers getting in on the HomePod action, with the likes of EE offering existing customers the option of spreading the cost of the speaker over the course of 11 months.</p>
      <p>You’ve also got the option of heading to Apple’s Refub Store to pick up a discounted HomePod. The refurbished models are (as the name suggests) pre-owned, but Apple meticulously checks every unit before shipping them out to consumers so you shouldn’t notice much of a difference in quality compared to a brand new unit.</p>
      <p>While there aren’t many deals right now, we expect that to change in the coming weeks as we get closer to the biggest shopping day of the year – Black Friday.</p>
      <h4>1. Apple HomePod (Refurbished)</h4>

        <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/refurbished/homepod">From: Apple Refurbished Store Was: £279 Now: £239  (£40 off) View Deal</a>
      </p>
      <p>It might not be a brand-new unit, but with a £40 discount, this is one of the better HomePod deals available at the moment. Don't worry about the second-hand nature of the speaker either; Apple makes sure that each and every unit is up to scratch before shipping. </p>
      <h4>2. Apple HomePod (Refurbished)</h4>

      </p>
      <p>If for whatever reason you don't want to buy your refurbished HomePod directly from Apple, Scan offers a refurb unit for the same price.</p>
      <h4>3. Apple HomePod</h4>

      </p>
      <p>While it's only £10 off the RRP, it's the cheapest you can pick up a brand-new HomePod for right now. </p>

      </p>
      <p>If you're an EE customer, you can add the cost of a HomePod onto your monthly contract and spread the payments over 11 months. You'll be paying £14 upfront and £25 a month on top of your contract for 11 months, totalling £289. </p>
