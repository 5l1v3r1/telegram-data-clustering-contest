      <h1>Refugees given 3 days to leave UNHCR's premises</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T16:28:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 16:28</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Mitchley</a></address>
      <p>Refugees occupying the area around the UN High Commissioner for Refugees' (UNHCR) offices in Pretoria have been given three days to vacate it. </p>
      <p>The Sheriff of the High Court arrived on Thursday afternoon and read out the order before pinning it to the gates. </p>
      <p>However, the refugees - who have been living on the pavements, in tents and makeshift structures outside the offices since the beginning of October - are no longer there. </p>
      <p>Hundreds are asking to be resettled in another country as they fear xenophobic attacks in South Africa.</p>
      <p>Their presence led to an urgent application by the Waterkloof Homeowners' Association and Brooklyn and Eastern Areas Citizens' Association to have them removed, which was granted. </p>
      <p>On Thursday morning, refugees moved onto the premises, jumping over gates and walls with their belongings. </p>

      </p>
      <p>According to the order by the Gauteng High Court in Pretoria, they have been given three days to vacate and disperse. </p>
      <p>In the event that they do not leave, a joint operation between the police, home affairs officials and Tshwane Metro will move in to ascertain the refugees' status and remove them. </p>
      <p>The refugees preempted the removal and moved on to UNHCR property, arguing they were no longer on the pavements so the court order was no longer applicable. </p>

      <p>Police sources confirmed to News24 that a case of trespassing had been opened and they would go onto the premises to remove the group. </p>
      <p>By Thursday afternoon, police management had been engaging with refugees to find an amicable solution that would see them leaving the property peacefully.</p>
