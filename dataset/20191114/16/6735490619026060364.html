      <p>Carter’s mom, Jane, reportedly told <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/11/14/aaron-carter-hospitalized-mounting-stress-restraining-orders-family-drama/"><i>TMZ</i></a> that her son arrived at her house on Thursday looking alarmingly thin. He reportedly weighed only 115-pounds, way down from the 160-pounds Carter once weighed.</p>
      <p>Jane is said to have immediately rushed her son to the emergency room. Carter’s condition reportedly stems from the stress he is experiencing over the restraining orders levied against him by his siblings, Nick Carter and Angel Carter.</p>

      <p>There was an outpouring of fan support in the comments section of the post. “Hope you’re ok Aaron, get well soon,” wrote one fan. Another commented, “Praying for you, Aaron.”</p>
      <p>Carter’s wellbeing has been the subject of media attention and fan concern over the past few weeks. Carter’s brother, Nick, <a href="https://etcanada.com/news/508418/aaron-carter-fires-back-after-brother-nick-carter-takes-out-restraining-order-against-him-were-done-for-life/">took out a restraining order</a> against the 31-year-old. Carter later accused his sister of raping him as a child.</p>
