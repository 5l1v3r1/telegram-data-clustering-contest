      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T16:38:37+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 16:38</time> by <a rel="author">Khareema Thompson, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Accra, Nov. 14, GNA - Although Mr Ken Ofori-Atta, Minister of Finance on Wednesday presented to Parliament the 2020 Budget statement and economic policies to parliament, reactions and debates will continue to dominate headlines.</p>
      <p>Why some may be applauding government for the economic directions and policies, others will continue to think otherwise.</p>
      <p>Speaking to the Ghana News Agency in Accra, Mrs Doris Ampofoh, the CEO of Film- tech Training Schools said the direct and indirect money into Ghanaians’ pocket was an objective point</p>
      <p>She said; “My children and others I know, are benefiting from the teachers and Nurses trainee allowances. This is actually what is expected from every running government.</p>
      <p>“Although the value of the allowance reduces due to inflation it is very beneficial and government needs to tighten its monetary policies to reduce inflation.”</p>
      <p>Jerry Quagrine an ITech practitioner said “the government’s achievements in paperless and cashless systems is a fast development systems, to catch up with technology. As you can see; the paperless is effective enough to eliminate cost, space and time, also transportation of data, credible documents will be stress free. It will also create jobs for the young internet experts.</p>
      <p>“The cashless system is also a great achievement and will be best if its practice spreads out to many more sectors as it is safer in making digital payment and transactions. It will also curb corruption into some extent”, he said.</p>
      <p>Mr Enoch Mensah an online-trader said he was happy that government was not introducing any new tax in the 2020 fiscal year.</p>
      <p>He said, ‘before the presentation of the budget, I was a little anxious whether there will be a new tax or an increment on the old tax. Even though there was not reduction, at least government listened to our grief towards taxation.</p>
      <p>“I believe more money should be invested into our cocoa and other resources we export. So more incomes, employment and good standard of living will be high in the country” he added.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>John Mike Oquaye, a teacher residing at the Manhean- Ablekuma road told the GNA that , the Minister announced 2020 as “ The year of roads” so we are calling on them to embark and walk their talk. We are now choked with hanging promises made by any government, so we plead with the Akufo-Addo administration to comply and eliminate deplorable roads as they promised”.</p>
      <p>A jeweler, Ortega Nii Ankrah however stated that; “the GHC 2.2billion being spent on free - SHS will be more profitable if invested into resources such as Cocoa, Forestry, Fish, Minerals, Gold, Diamond and Petroleum to generate more revenue than expenditure”.</p>
      <p>He told the GNA that, “looking at matters now , the billions of Cedis when invested into natural resources, will raise incomes, create employment and create long-term financial security.</p>
      <p>That, he said parents would be able to afford education making it an indirect way of funding education by the government”.</p>
      <p>The budget was described as the “Nkosuo ne Nkabom budget” for 2020.</p>
      <p>Presentation of budget is a constitutional requirement of the Minister of Finance on behalf of the President to present to Parliament, every fiscal year, the Budget Statement and Economic Policies of Government, for scrutiny and debate.</p>
