      <p>Bad Bunny and Residente have grabbed Ricky Martin for a new Latin track called "Cántalo" that translates to "say it." The song drops at a perfect time since the 20th Annual Latin GRAMMY Awards take place tonight in Las Vegas and will be hosted by Ricky, Roselyn Sánchez and Paz Vega.</p>
      <p>The lyrics share a message of peace and union with Bad Bunny's rap style meshing perfectly with Ricky's singing voice. "Money, although abundant, it is not worth," Residente and Ricky preach.</p>
      <p>The trio will be performing the song for the first time tonight at the award show. Stream the new-new and let us know what you think.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The breeze and the wind don't They stop blowing<br/>And the candles don't go out<br/>Your tide intoxicates my waist<br/>The blue moon, the drops of the sun</p>
