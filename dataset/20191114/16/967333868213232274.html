        <b>In early November, Emmanuel Macron expressed strong-worded claims, explicitly stating the need to “regain military sovereignty”, adding that the 70-year-old North-Atlantic bloc apparently has – so to speak - some health issues.</b>

      <p>French President Emmanuel Macron didn’t mean the death of the North-Atlantic alliance when he referred to the “brain death of NATO” French Defence Minister Florence Parly told an audience in the French Senate.</p>

      <p>“When the president of the republic talked about “the death of NATO’s brain, he meant that nobody should ignore the crisis that the organisation has been going through”, she noted.</p>
      <p>Parly contended that NATO continues to serve as a robust instrument of cooperation, although it shouldn’t be the reason to ignore existing issues.</p>
      <p>Parly believes there are grounds for doubting US security guarantees, as well as questions with regard to solidarity of the bloc’s allies - in particular, “when Turkey attacks those who are fighting Daesh*”.</p>
      <p>She went on to explain the president’s remarks, as a wish to “sound the alarm”. “NATO is a cornerstone of European security and defence, but the alliance must adjust itself”, Parly remarked.Earlier this month, President Emmanuel Macron told The Economist that “we are currently experiencing . . . the brain death of NATO” and Europe “must regain military sovereignty”.</p>
      <p>German chancellor Angela Merkel, as well as NATO’s Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, ripped Macron for his “drastic words” and argued that NATO remained a key pillar of Germany's security.</p>
      <p>However, a year ago, Merkel opted for a less positive tone, telling the European Parliament:</p>
      <p>“The times when we could unconditionally rely on others are over”.</p>
      <p>At the time, the German Chancellor supported Macron’s call for the establishment of a “true European army” so that the EU could stand up in its own defence.</p>
