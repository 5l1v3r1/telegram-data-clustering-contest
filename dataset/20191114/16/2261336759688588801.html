      <h1>Maycee Barber vs. Roxanne Modafferi targeted for UFC 246 in January</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T16:00:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 16:00</time> by <a rel="author">Harry Davies</a></address>
      <p>A women’s flyweight matchup between rising prospect Maycee Barber and former title challenger Roxanne Modafferi is in the works for the UFC’s first PPV of 2020.</p>
      <p><a href="https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/2019/11/maycee-barber-vs-roxanne-modafferi-ufc-246-fight-booking">MMA Junkie</a> first reported the potential matchup for UFC 246. The 21-year-old Barber has most recently made headlines for claiming Paige VanZant turned down a fight with her as she “didn’t want to have her face damaged.”</p>
      <p>Barber (8-0) landed herself a UFC contract in July of last year after picking up a third-round stoppage on Dana White’s Tuesday Night Contender Series. Winning her UFC debut by second-round TKO in November 2018, she has since picked up TKOs over JJ Aldrich and Gillian Robertson.</p>
      <p>Whilst Barber has just eight professional fights to her name, Modafferi (23-16) will be fighting her fortieth pro fight at UFC 246. Modafferi has a mixed run in the UFC of late, going 2-3 in her last five. She most recently lost a decision to Jennifer Maia at UFC San Antonio, but was on the right end of a split decision win against Antonina Shevchenko before that.</p>
      <p>UFC 246 takes place on January 18th in Las Vegas. No other fights have been announced for the card yet.</p>
