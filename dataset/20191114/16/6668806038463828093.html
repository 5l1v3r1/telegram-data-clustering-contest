      <p>Judging from the film’s performance in the country, we’re sure that it’ll be a success abroad as well. Talking about the film’s Hong Kong release, Vibha Chopra, Head-Global Syndication &amp; International Film Distribution, Zee Entertainment, said: "The quirky tale of 'Dream Girl' transcends boundaries! A film that has emerged to be one of the biggest entertainers of the year marks 5th Bollywood release in this non-traditional market after 'Barfi', 'Dangal', 'Secret Superstar' and 'Hichki'. It's always a great feeling to take such films to the unconventional territories and witness the diaspora's reaction towards this film.”</p>
