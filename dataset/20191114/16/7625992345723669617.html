      <h1>Walmart's Black Friday deals start on a Wednesday</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T16:25:10+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 16:25</time> by <a rel="author">Megan Cerullo</a></address>
      <p>Attention holiday shoppers: Walmart's Black Friday will officially start on Wednesday this year.</p>
      <p>The nation's largest retailer announced its main holiday-shopping event will kick off online at 10:00 p.m. Eastern Time on Wednesday, November 27, followed by an in-store deals rollout at 6:00 p.m. on Thanksgiving day.</p>
      <p>Overeager shoppers can snag other pre-Black Friday deals starting this week. Walmart is offering "<a href="https://www.walmart.com/m/deals/christmas-gifts/black-friday-buy-now-deals">buy now</a>" deals for those who can't wait to spend — or potentially save — starting Thursday, November 14, on its website, where consumers can see discounts on Apple and Samsung products, home appliances and more. </p>
      <p>"We're giving customers a little something extra with two additional events to get everything on their list at exciting prices," Steve Bratspies, Walmart's executive vice president and chief merchandising officer announced.</p>
      <p>Even more deals will be rolled out by Walmart on Friday, November 22, at 12:00 a.m. Eastern Time as part of a "Pre-Black Friday" event. Details of those deals have not yet been announced.</p>
      <p>The retailer's main Black Friday event, which actually starts on Wednesday, will include savings on Apple AirPods, kids' pajamas, linens and more.</p>
      <p>Target and other <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/target-black-friday-ad-target-kicks-off-its-black-friday-deals-this-week-joining-other-big-retailers-for-early-sales/">retailers have announced earlier starts to their holiday sales</a>, citing the shorter-than-usual window between Thanksgiving and Christmas this year. </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/walmart-holiday-deals-to-begin-well-before-black-friday/">Walmart actually kicked off its holiday season in late October</a>, touting deals on trampolines, smart TVs and more. It's also offering free next-day delivery on select items to non-members to compete with rival Amazon, which said it will offer free, one-day delivery for Amazon Prime members this season. </p>
