      <p>A portfolio of care homes that private equity boss Guy Hands secured after a fierce legal battle is on the cusp of being sold for £160m.</p>
      <p>The 24 sites which are owned by Hands’ Terra Firma Capital Partners are close to being sold to care home operator Barchester Healthcare, Sky News reported.</p>
      <p>The deal would bring to an end a long-running chronicle that saw Hands locked in a legal battle over the ownership of the portfolio which was settled last year.</p>

      </p>
      <p>A deal for the care homes has been under discussion for several months and it could be signed within days, the report said.</p>
      <p>The transaction would bolster Barchester’s 200-strong estate which has a staff of about 17,000 people and look after 11,000 residents.</p>
      <p>Barchester was in the process of being sold earlier this year for up to £2.5bn to Australian bank Macquarie before the deal collapsed amid worries about the impact of a potential no-deal Brexit.</p>
      <p>The business is owned by JP McManus, John Magnier and Dermot Desmond, a trio of wealthy businessmen who have investments have included horse racing and Manchester United Football Club.</p>
      <h3>He knew he was right</h3>
      <p>For Hands, the deal will represent a successful conclusion to a foray into a sector that has caused him significant difficulties in recent years.</p>
      <p>Terra Firma acquired Four Seasons Health Care in a £825m deal in 2012, but it sunk into financial difficulties and then endured a fight with its largest lender, H/2 Capital Partners.</p>
      <p>The parent company of Four Seasons was placed into administration in April, but has failed to find a buyer despite negotiations with a series of potential buyers.</p>

      <p>The potential deal with Barchester follows previous talks between Terra Firma and Patron Capital Partners about a deal during the summer.</p>
      <p>The sale comes as Hands tries to refocus his private equity firm and try to raise money for new deals.</p>
      <p>Barchester and Terra Firma declined to comment.</p>
