      <p>After <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/n39686/west-of-dead-beta-available-now-xbox">it popped up</a> in the Microsoft Store perhaps a little earlier than intended, twin-stick shooter <i><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/west-of-dead-beta/9p6q4z7fqjtt/?rtc=1&amp;source=lp&amp;activetab=pivot:overviewtab">West of Dead</a></i> is available in open beta on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/11/xbox-one-surprise-me-test/">Xbox One</a>.

      <p>The bounty hunter with a flaming skull for a head can tactically use cover while battling undead outlaws and beasts in Purgatory, Wyoming in 1888. Upstream Arcade developed <i>West of Dead, </i>which is a roguelike that uses procedural generation for its stylish environments.</p>
      <p>The open beta runs until November 25th. If you can kill a Wendigo by then, you'll claim a trophy you can take into the full game. <i>West of Dead</i> will be available on Xbox One and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/14/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-adds-discord-spotify-ea-access-free/">Xbox Game Pass</a> next year, as well as PS4, Nintendo Switch and PC (on Steam, GOG and the Microsoft Store).</p>
