      <h1>France has highest number of people with chronic diabetes in EU</h1>

      <p>The French are known for their food, their wine... and their diabetes?</p>
      <p>Of all the EU members states, France counts the highest proportion of people living with chronic diabetes, a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-eurostat-news/-/EDN-20171113-1">study by the EU Commission</a> has found.</p>
      <p>Thursday November 14 is International Diabetes Day, and an estimated 33 million EU citizens suffer from the disease, <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/research/health/index.cfm?pg=area&amp;areaname=diabetes">according to the EU Commission</a>.</p>
      <p>One in 10 people in France (10.0%) declared that they suffered from chronic diabetes, the study found. Portugal came second with 9.3%, then Greece with 9.2%, according to the latest available data.</p>
      <p>On the healthier side of the spectrum, Lithuanian people aged 15 or over were less than 5% to report chronic diabetes (4.4%), compared to 4.6% in Denmark and Ireland, 4.7% in Latvia, 4.8% in Romania and Sweden and 4.9% in Austria.</p>
      <p>The report noted that no systematic difference can be observed between men and women, but that age does make a difference: "The older the age group, the higher the share."</p>
      <p>Among people aged 65 to 74 in the EU, 16.3% reported chronic diabetes. In the group aged 75 or over, the figure jumped to almost a fifth (19.6%). For age groups below 45, the figure was under 2%.</p>
      <p>Within EU countries, there are also massive regional disparities. Eurostat said Wednesday in a press release that the highest rates of death from diabetes were recorded in the Portuguese regions of Azores, Madeira and Alentejo.</p>
      <p>The lowest rates were recorded in two regions of Romania: Nord-Vest and the capital region of Bucuresti.</p>
      <p>In the UK, the number of people who are obese has almost doubled in the last 20 years from 6.9 to 13 million, Diabetes UK said on Wednesday. This is a cause of concern as obesity is the main driver for the most common form of diabetes, the non-profit said.</p>
      <p>Levels of education also showed a "clear pattern", the EU Commission report noted: the proportion of diabetics in the EU falls as the educational level rises.</p>
      <p>Among those with a low educational level, the percentage of people reporting chronic diabetes reached 10.8%, while for those with a medium level of education it was 5.7%. The lowest percentage, at 4.2%, was reached among the highest-educated population.</p>
