      <h1>Syrian troops begin deploying along border with Turkey</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T16:45:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 16:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/press-association/" target="_blank">By Press Association</a></address>
      <p>Syrian government forces have started deploying in areas close to the Turkish border in the north-east of the country, state media has reported.</p>
      <p>The troops are deploying between the towns of Jawadiyeh and Malkiyeh, also known as Derik, according to news agency Sana.</p>
      <p>The deployment is part of a deal reached between Russia and Turkey last month along much of the north-eastern border that seeks to ensure Kurdish fighters leave the area.</p>
      <p>Since the agreement was reached, Russia and Turkey began joint patrols along a narrower strip directly on the Turkish-Syrian border.</p>
      <p>Turkey began a major military offensive against Kurdish fighters in northern Syria last month, capturing dozens of towns and villages.</p>
