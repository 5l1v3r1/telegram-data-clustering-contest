      <p>Accra, Nov. 14, GNA - Despite a directive by the Management of the Judicial Service to the Judicial Service Staff Association of Ghana (JUSAG) to resume work, most of the courts remained closed on Thursday.</p>
      <p>When the GNA visited the circuit courts, all the courtrooms were closed.</p>
      <p>However, Judicial Service Security and other private security men were still at post.</p>
      <p>At the Law Court complex which housed all the High Courts, some of the judges sat over cases with the help of service persons and NABCO personnel.</p>
      <p>A lawyer told the GNA that she went to the court to move a motion for substituted service and the motion was granted.</p>
      <p>The lawyer said although the motion had been granted, she wondered how the orders of the court would be carried out.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile JUSAG has asked its members not to heed to calls by the Management of the Judicial Service to resume work.</p>
      <p>JUSAG said it would not be intimidated by calls to resume and asked its members to remain resolute.</p>
      <p>Management of the Judicial Service in a statement expressed concern over JUSAG's nationwide strike despite a meeting between the Association and the National Labour Commission ( NLC).</p>
      <p>The Management called on Judges and Magistrates to resume work and assured the public that work would go on in the various courts.</p>
      <p>The NLC has also described the JUSAG strike over reviewed salaries as illegal but JUSAG on the other hand says it is only a court of competent jurisdiction that could describe their strike action as illegal or not.</p>
      <p>JUSAG last week served notices to embark on nationwide strike on November 13, this year, over reviewed salaries.</p>
      <p>It commenced the strike action as stated, leaving some litigants dejected as the court rooms remained closed.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, JUSAG in a statement has asked its members to remain on strike to demand the implementation of the negotiated salary review done by the Judicial Council.</p>
      <p>The statement signed by Mr Derrick Annan, General Secretary, JUSAG, however said, the Association disagreed with the position taken by Management.</p>
