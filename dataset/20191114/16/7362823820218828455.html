The SF90 Stradale has a 4.0-liter V8 and three electric motors with a combined output of 986 horsepower. The screaming mid-engine supercar can accelerate to 60 mph in 2.5 seconds and hit a top speed of 211 mph.</figcaption>

      <p>The two-plus-two-seat two-door features a sleek, clean style that appears aimed at competing against luxurious grand touring sports cars like those from Aston Martin. It is powered by a 612 hp twin-turbocharged V8 that’s good for 0-62 mph acceleration in 3.4 seconds and a top speed over 199 mph.</p>

      <p>The Roma was designed “for people who would like to drive a sports car, or a Ferrari, but are afraid of Ferrari and sportscars,” said Ferrari Commercial Director Enrico Galliera at the car’s unveiling in Rome on Thursday. According to the AP, the price will start above $220,000 when it goes on sale next summer.</p>
