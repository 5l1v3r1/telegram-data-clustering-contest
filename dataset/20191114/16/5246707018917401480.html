      <p>Earlier this year, it was revealed that <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/decay_of_logos"><b>Decay of Logos</b></a> would be <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/08/decay_of_logos_delayed_on_switch_other_versions_releasing_as_planned">delayed on Nintendo Switch</a>. We weren't sure just how long Switch owners were going to be made to wait back then, but a final release date has now been officially confirmed.</p>
      <p>Thankfully, you won't have much longer to wait at all, as the game hits the eShop on 28th November. It'll be launching for €19.99 / $19.99, and you can check out some of its gameplay in the brand new trailer shared above. Here's an official description:</p>
      <blockquote>Decay of Logos is a story-driven, third-person action/adventure RPG with an emphasis on player exploration with minimal hand-holding and challenging combat. Immerse yourselves in the high-fantasy world of Decay of Logos through the eyes of a young adventurer named Ada, accompanied by a mystical Elk. Both are fatefully brought together the day her village is burned down by Crimson Knights bearing the Royal Crest. Motivated by revenge, she sets out on a journey to unveil the truth behind the attack.</blockquote>
