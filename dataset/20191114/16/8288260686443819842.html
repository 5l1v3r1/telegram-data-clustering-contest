      <p>A Smethwick cosmetic clinic was stripped of its licence for using dirty surgical equipment and administering potentially lethal doses of anaesthetic.</p>
      <p>Bearwood Cosmetic Clinic offered a variety of procedures - including vaginoplasty and liposuction - which staff had not had sufficient training to perform.</p>
      <p>The "unsafe" theatre was "not fit for purpose", with live wires exposed and plaster falling out of the walls.</p>
      <p>Dust also covered cupboards and trolleys, while "brown reddish stains" which had a "foul smell" were found ingrained into the fabric and structure of a bed used for patients to lay on during procedures.</p>
      <p>The unhygienic conditions were uncovered during an unannounced Care Quality Commission inspection in 2018. Findings were published by the health watchdog today (Wednesday, November 14).</p>
      <p>Patients were given anaesthetic agents above the recommended dosage, which had put their lives at risk. The report also stated emergency equipment had not been readily available - a resuscitation trolley with defibrillator and emergency drugs were located on a different floor.</p>

      <p>The findings prompted chief inspector of hospitals, Ted Baker, to write to providers across the country, raising particular concern regarding the use of anaesthetic during liposuction.</p>
      <p>Within two days of the inspection, which took place on November 29 last year, the CQC cancelled the clinic's licence  due to the "serious and significant risks" it identified.</p>
      <p>The clinic has since closed.</p>
