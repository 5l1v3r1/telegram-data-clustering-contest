      <h2>The Thai government has asked farmers in 22 rice-growing provinces not to grow off-season crops</h2>

      <p>Indian <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/rice">rice </a>export prices extended losses for a second week as the rupee weakened and demand from Africa remained low, while a <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/cyclone">cyclone </a>damaged paddy fields in neighbouring Bangladesh. Top exporter India's 5% broken parboiled variety was quoted around $363-$368 per tonne, down from $365-$370 last week.</p>
      <p>"In dollar terms, export prices are down due to the weak rupee. Local paddy <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/rice">rice </a>prices are firm," an exporter based at Kakinada in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh said.</p>
      <p>The Indian rupee fell to a two-month low on Wednesday, increasing exporters' margins. Tepid demand from African countries for non-basmati <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/rice">rice </a>has also played a role in dampening exports, which were down 29% year-on-year in August at 644,249 tonnes.</p>
      <p>Many rice-growing states received rainfall earlier this month, which delayed harvesting and damaged paddy crops ready for harvesting, exporters said.</p>
      <p>Last week, <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/cyclone">cyclone </a>Bulbul ripped through coastal areas of Bangladesh and eastern India, damaging 23,000 hectares (56,834.24 acres) of paddy fields, as per a preliminary assessment by Dhaka's agriculture ministry.</p>
      <p>"We will get a clear picture of the extent of the damage by next week," said Mizanur Rahman, a senior official of Department of Agriculture Extension.</p>

      <p>This could be a major blow to the country at a time when farmers have been unable to secure benchmark prices for produce, with no fresh overseas deals in sight. Elsewhere, Thailand's benchmark 5% broken rice edged up to $395-$409 a tonne from last week's $390-$408. Demand for Thai rice has remained relatively flat despite some optimism over a recent rice deal with Iraq, traders said</p>
      <p>However strength in the baht - Asia's best-performing currency this year - continued to dent demand for Thai rice, making it more expensive than grain from competitors such as Vietnam and India.</p>
      <p>"Right now, domestic prices are too low for farmers," a Bangkok-based trader said. "Prices could go up as supply may shrink, or the government could step in to buy rice at a high price."</p>
      <p>"But the current prices are already higher than our overseas competitors, so it is tough to export."</p>
      <p>The Thai government has asked farmers in 22 rice-growing provinces not to grow off-season crops as the country braces for a dry spell amid low water levels in main reservoirs. In Vietnam, rates for 5% broken rice stayed flat at $345-$350 a tonne.</p>
      <p>The market was dull, with trading done only on previously signed contracts, a trader said. "I think the market will stay this quiet until the end of next year." In October, Vietnam exported around 450,000 tonnes of rice, down 5.9% against September, customs data showed.</p>
