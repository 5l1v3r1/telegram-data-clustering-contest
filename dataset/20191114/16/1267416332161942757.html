      <p>Ford has finally revealed the name of its upcoming electric vehicle (EV), the Mustang Mach-E.</p>
      <p>The Michigan-based automaker has manufactured a few electric cars in the past, but those were retrofits on existing models. The Mach-E represents Ford’s first vehicle designed from the ground up as an EV.</p>
      <p>The world will get its first real glimpse of the car on Sunday, November 17th. <i>MobileSyrup</i> will be on the ground at the event to report all Canadian details related to Ford’s new car. Ford’s website seems to suggest the event will be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Ford">live-streamed on YouTube.</a></p>
      <p>We know a few details about the upcoming car, including that it’s an SUV with the style elements of a Mustang, but most information is still unknown. We’ve even seen some pictures of the vehicle already, <a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/366388/ford-mustang-electric-suv-spied/">but it’s camouflaged</a> so it’s hard to tell what exactly it looks like.</p>
