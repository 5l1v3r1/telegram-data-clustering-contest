      <ul>
        <li/>
      </ul>
      <p>Apple's official silicone case can be bought alongside your new iPhone direct from the website.</p>
      <p>While not the most affordable, Apple claims it has undergone thousands of hours of testing and you can ensure it meets the company's high standards of quality control. </p>
      <p>The case is typical of many silicone cases, adding very little bulk while still protecting the fragile glass back of the phone.</p>
      <p>Crucially, it still supports wireless charging and you can choose from black or white variants. </p>
      <p>The case is available on Apple's website for <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/MWVX2ZM/A/iphone-11-silicone-case-white">£45.00</a>/<a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MWVX2ZM/A/iphone-11-silicone-case-white">US$39.00</a>.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The Razer Arctech Pro range has gamers locked in its sights, offering a thermaphene layer and little vents in the case that aim to lower the temperature of your iPhone during intense gaming sessions, improving both performance and overall battery life. </p>
      <p>It's not just a cool-looking heatsink though; the Arctech Pro offers heavy-duty drop protection - up to 10ft according to Razer - and the raised lip should help avoid smashing the screen to pieces when you inevitably drop it screen-down. It's available in three colours - Black, White and Pink - and can be bought via <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112722&amp;xcust=41-3702003-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.macworld.co.uk%2Ffeature%2Fiphone%2Fbest-iphone-11-cases-3702003%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgb-en%2Fmobile%2Frazer-arctech-pro">Razer</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07WL5BMXB?ascsubtag=41-3702003-11-0000000">Amazon</a> with an RRP of £39.99/$39.99. </p>

      </ul>
      <p>Apple didn't invent the iPhone in all its colours and textures just for you to cover it up with a fancy case. But we all know that a dropped or scratched iPhone is not what Apple wants either.</p>

      <p>There are three types: Transparent (so owners can still enjoy the great new colours), and Matte in either Frosted Clear, Frosted Black, Solid Black, Navy Blue and Red - all cost <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112722&amp;xcust=41-3702003-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.macworld.co.uk%2Ffeature%2Fiphone%2Fbest-iphone-11-cases-3702003%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.totalleecase.com%2Fproducts%2Fthin-iphone-11-case">£29/US$29</a>.
