      <p>“I have a confession. And it was from that night [at the People’s Choice Awards],” Bristowe began. “Everyone’s probably expecting this to be way worse than it is ‘cause I was, like, ‘I had the most embarrassing thing happen to me in front of the Kardashians’… I’m a little mortified. So, you know when you see people on TV, and you think you’re friends with them?”</p>
      <p>“Okay. And so, I think that happens with me because [fans] watch my social media all the time, and they’re like, ‘Hey!’ And then they’re like, ‘Oh, it’s you.'” she continued. “Well, I did that to them, but I didn’t stop there. I just walked right up to the Kardashians.”</p>

      <p>But it didn’t end there, things got more “embarrassing” for the Canadian beauty.</p>
      <p>“There was Kim [Kardashian], Khloe [Kardashian], Kourtney [Kardashian] and Kris [Jenner]… And I walked right up, and I was like, ‘Hey!’ And they looked at me and went, ‘Hey!’ And I don’t know if they were just being nice or if they watch the show,” Bristowe recalled. “I don’t know. Apparently, they watch the show, so I’m just going to pretend that they know who I am. And well, I said, ‘I fall asleep to you guys every night. It’s so comforting!’ And Kourtney was like, ‘Thanks.’ And they all just looked at me like, ‘She cray.'”</p>
