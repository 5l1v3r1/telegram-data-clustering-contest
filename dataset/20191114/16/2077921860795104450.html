      <h1>Moses Sumney Announces New Double Album græ, Shares First Single</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T16:18:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 16:18</time> by <a rel="author">Hayden Goodridge  </a></address>
      <p>Immensely talented neo-soul artist <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/09/moses-sumney.html">Moses Sumney</a> has announced a forthcoming double-album titled <i>græ</i>, due out next spring on Jagjaguwar. The album, Sumney’s second after the acclaimed <i>Aromanticism</i>, will be released in two parts—one in February and one in March—and follows a conceptual narrative on the idea of grayness. The album’s first single, “Virile” is a triumphant return for Sumney, arriving along with a self-directed video that solidifies the strength of his multi-faceted approach to his art.</p>
      <p>“Virile” is a term used to describe a male with a strong sexual attraction—something that Sumney has no problem conveying through his vocal and physical performances. The song opens with a strange wail from the singer before a gleefully plucked harp begins the movement. “Virile” is undoubtedly spiritual, with a focus on the connection between earth and the body: Sumney sings, “And I realize now / That none of this matters / ‘Cause I will return / The dust and matter.” The song displays opulent orchestration, with harp, flute, piano and vocal harmonies intermingling in a smooth, symbiotic bliss.</p>
      <p>The stunning video for “Virile” emits a resounding energy that proves Sumney to be as much of a visual icon as he is a musical one. In the cold, depressing setting of a meat locker, Sumney contorts his shining bare body through a fantastic interpretive dance. Later he kneels before a religious candlelit shrine surrounded by hanging meat—a surreal sight, indeed. The last few seconds of the video show Sumney laying in a field completely covered in ladybugs while hyperventilating. The video is bizarre, cryptic and wonderfully shot.</p>
      <p>In a statement, Sumney explains that his approach to his art maintains a crucial self-awareness that prevents him from being pulled in any single musical direction:</p>
      <p>It all works to create a paradox, keeping art and artist somewhere between any one sure thing—but surely something that demands your attention affixed and your breath bated.</p>
      <p>The first part of <i>græ</i> is due out in February, while the full album is dropping March 15 on Jagjaguwar and can be preordered <a href="https://www.secretlystore.com/grae-moses-sumney">here</a>.
