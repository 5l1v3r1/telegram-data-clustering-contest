      <h1>Trust Deed Scotland welcomes crackdown on misleading debt service adverts</h1>
      <h2>This month, Google will restrict advertising of unregulated debt companies giving customers the opportunity to become debt free without the risk.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T16:26:54+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 16:26</time> by <a rel="author">Record Reporter</a></address>
      <p>Finding yourself in debt can be worrying and make you feel like there’s nowhere to turn.</p>
      <p>When you search the internet for help to deal with your debt, you’re met with countless adverts claiming to have you debt free, yet many are unregulated, selling your details off to the highest bidder.</p>
      <p>As of November, Google will now restrict its advertising product availability for these companies which is good news for companies like Trust Deed Scotland who are there to help people the right way.</p>
      <p>Trust Deed Scotland encourages other social platforms such as Facebook and Instagram to follow suit.</p>
      <p>Now, any debt advice firm who wants to advertise on Google will have to provide official FCA accreditation before being allowed to advertise on the search engine.</p>

      <p>There have been over 83 instances of fraudulent impersonator websites reported for advertising on the platform in 2019 as a debt charity.</p>
      <p>Amanda of Trust Deed Scotland said: "People who need financial advice are often vulnerable and susceptible to calls and online offers from individuals offering ‘government approved solutions."</p>
      <p>"This in fact can result in a worsening of their finances as those companies then aim to sell their details onto effectively the highest bidder."</p>
      <p>Now, when you go online in search of debt advice, you’ll receive service of the right standard that companies like Trust Deed Scotland pride themselves on.</p>
      <p>Amanda said: "We’ve been aware of a number of firms operating, passing themselves off as the official Trust Deed Scotland for a number of years now."</p>
      <p>Many of these companies are in fact based in countries as far away as the Philippines and India, and some are call centres based in England.</p>
      <p>Amanda added: "We have invested in our own compliance team and call recording technology and regularly provide training to our debt advisers."</p>
