      <p>Those curious about what went on at PDXCON for Paradox Interactive and their upcoming RPG <b><i>Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2</i></b> need not worry, as the team themselves have uploaded a new video recapping their presentation of the game to the Berlin crowd last month.</p>
      <p>The team shared their vision for making players feel like a vampire, building the city of Seattle and making it feel like a living world, and even teased a new character, Chip, players will meet in-game. In addition, Andy Kipling, Co-Founder and CEO of the game’s developer, Hardsuit Labs, put together a dev diary sharing his experience at the show (<a href="https://www.bloodlines2.com/en/dev-diary-7-pdxcon-recap">which you can find here</a>).</p>
      <p><i>Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2</i> will hit PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One late next year.</p>
