      <h1>Flybe is cutting flights from Exeter as part of new schedule</h1>
      <h2>Cuts have been made to flights including Manchester, Paris. Edinburgh and Amsterdam</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T16:05:09+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 16:05</time> by <a rel="author">Anita Merritt</a></address>
      <p>Flybe has announced its new summer flight schedule for next year with new routes, but astute passengers have noticed other routes are being reduced.</p>
      <p>As part of the first phase of its 2020 Summer programme, Flybe has 14 routes on sale from Exeter Airport and says it is 'closely' working with its partners relating to services which may currently not feature in the new seasonal schedule.</p>
      <p>The reduced service changes include:</p>
      <p>. Manchester flights have reduced from four flights a day to three</p>
      <p>. Paris flights have reduced from two flights a day to one</p>
      <p>. Further cuts to Edinburgh, Amsterdam, Bergerac, and Rennes</p>
      <p>The Edinburgh flight is now operated by Stobart Air.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for Flybe said: "Flybe is optimising and streamlining operations with a focus on better serving our frequent fliers including those travelling for business and visiting friends and family, and with a fleet that will no longer feature the larger E95 jets.</p>
      <p>"This has included adjusting the timings on some of our existing flights and removing a number of unprofitable routes. </p>
      <p>"This move will allow Flybe to offer a more consistent and improved service  on the many popular routes still featured on the Summer 20 schedule at the times and on the days of the week our customers most want to travel, and that also allows our business to grow profitably in the future."</p>
      <p>The Exeter-based airline will feature 104 routes in total with a choice of up to 2,500 flights per week across the UK and Europe.</p>
      <p>These include seven new routes – six from London Southend and one between Manchester and Stuttgart.</p>
      <p>Exeter Airport to Chambery is one of eight winter ski routes that has been extended through to Easter.</p>
      <p>The airline, which together with Stobart Air, is owned by Connect Airways, will next year launch its operations under the new name of Virgin Connect following the completion of a full re-brand as part of the extended Virgin family.</p>
      <p>Tickets go on sale on the Flybe website today for travel between March 29 and October 24 next year.</p>
