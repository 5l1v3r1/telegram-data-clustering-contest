      <p>No decision was taken on Thursday on extending the odd-even road rationing scheme, which enters its final day on Friday.</p>
      <p>The anti-pollution measure kicked in on November 4 and is scheduled to end on November 15, if not extended by the Delhi government.</p>
      <p>"A final decision about extending the odd-even rule could be taken on Friday, depending on the situation of air pollution and outcome of a hearing pertaining to the scheme in the Supreme Court," a Delhi government functionary said.</p>
      <p>Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had earlier said the odd-even restrictions could be extended, if required.</p>
      <p>Till Thursday, a total of 4,309 challans were issued against violators of the scheme, officials said.</p>
      <p>According to official data, 475 challans were issued by the teams of traffic police(276.), transport (139) and revenue (60) departments from 8 AM to 8 PM, when the restrictions were in force, on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The violators of odd-even rules are slapped with a fine of Rs 4,000.</p>
      <p>A total of 532 violators of odd-even rules were challaned on the first day of the scheme on November 4. The highest number of challans (709) were issued on November 6.</p>
      <p>Under the rule, non-transport vehicles having odd and even last digits of registration number ply on odd and even dates, respectively.</p>
      <p>The Delhi government has claimed a high percentage of compliance of the scheme by motorists in the city. Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia has said people were "religiously" following the odd-even rule.</p>
      <p>The Delhi government blaming crop stubble burning in neighbouring Punjab and Haryana as the reason behind poor <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/air-quality">air quality </a>in the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/category/current-affairs-news-national-1150106.htm">national </a>capital, has claimed that the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/about/what-is-odd-even-scheme">odd-even scheme </a>is one of the steps responsible for respite from the crisis.</p>
