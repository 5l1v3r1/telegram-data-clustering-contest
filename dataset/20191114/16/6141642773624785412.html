      <p>Matteo Berrettini signed off from London’s 02 by becoming the first Italian to win a match at the ATP Finals with a surprise victory over Dominic Thiem.</p>
      <p>The big-serving 23-year-old, beaten in his first two matches by Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer, won 7-6 (3) 6-3.</p>
      <p>Berrettini knew he could not qualify for the semi-finals, while Austrian Thiem was already through following his wins over Djokovic and Federer.</p>
      <p>It was at least a winning end to a successful season for Berrettini, who began the year ranked 54.</p>

      <p>The eighth seed and final qualifier for the season-ending tournament said: “I’m really proud of myself and for my team, my family and my friends.</p>
      <p>“It’s been an unbelievable season and I didn’t expect at the beginning to be here. I hope to be back next year. I’m happy to finish with a win.</p>
      <p>“I always have great fights with Thiem. I was able to stay mentally focused even when I lost my serve, and I played a great tie-break. I’m not feeling great physically so I’m happy with my performance.”</p>
      <p>Thiem’s below-par display could be put down to the cold he has been carrying this week.</p>

      <p>He said: “I think I felt the two first matches a little bit, and then also it’s a bit of a tricky situation to know that I’m already through. So all the attention, the adrenaline, is set down a little bit.</p>
      <p>“Of course I was still trying to win that match, 100 per cent. But at the same time I knew I had to take care for Saturday, because obviously it’s the way more important match there.”</p>
      <p>Earlier Joe Salisbury’s bid to reach the semi-finals in the doubles came to an end.</p>
      <p>The 27-year-old, Britain’s sole representative at the Finals, and his American partner Rajeev Ram lost a match tie-breaker to Lukasz Kubot and Marcelo Melo.</p>
