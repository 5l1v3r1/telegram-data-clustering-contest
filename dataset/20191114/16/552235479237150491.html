      <p>A <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/sex-beast-scots-beggar-who-14071817">beggar who raped a woman</a> after she stopped to offer help has lost an appeal against a life sentence imposed on him.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/glasgow-beggar-james-campbell-who-16530557">James Campbell, 32, attacked the 57-year-old victim in a lane</a> in Glasgow city centre on August 16 last year.</p>
      <p>Campbell, from Paisley, in Renfrewshire, who earned up to pounds 100 a day, regularly begged in Glasgow's Buchanan Street draped in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-transfer-news/celtic-linked-gillingham-starlet-hoops-20880248">Celtic</a> colours.</p>
      <p>The woman noticed he was not wearing a top despite the cold and rain and asked if he was alright and chatted to him.</p>
      <p>Campbell followed the woman and refused to go away and as his victim walked past the lane between West Nile Street and Nelson Mandela Place he demanded a kiss, before restraining and raping her.</p>

      <p>The woman struggled with him and repeatedly told him to stop and a lawyer in a nearby office saw the incident and contacted police. Officers arrived and dragged the rapist off her.</p>
      <p>He admitted the sex attack and judge Lady Stacey imposed an order for lifelong restriction (OLR) on him.</p>
      <p>She ordered that he serve a minimum of three years in prison but warned there was no definite time he would be released following the "very serious and violent rape".</p>
      <p>Lawyers acting for Campbell went to the Court of Criminal Appeal in Edinburgh to challenge the imposition of the OLR on the rapist.</p>
      <p>Defence solicitor advocate Ann Ogg told the Lord Justice General, Lord Carloway, sitting with Lord Drummond Young and Lord Turnbull, that it was Campbell's first conviction for a sexual offence.</p>
      <p>She said that he had underlying drug, alcohol and mental health problems but with the right intervention he could be rehabilitated.</p>
      <p>She said there were indications of a willingness to change.</p>
      <p>Miss Ogg submitted that the sentencing judge had erred over the risk criteria assessment and imposition of the OLR.</p>
      <p>Lord Carloway said the appeal would be refused as the judges considered that Lady Stacey had applied herself correctly to her task and was entitled to impose the OLR.</p>
      <p>The senior judge said a full decision would be issued later.</p>
