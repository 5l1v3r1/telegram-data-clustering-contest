      <h2>Several websites tell people how they can vote tactically to try and stop Brexit.</h2>

      <p>"LONDON — Pro-EU campaigners are not taking any chances on the so-called Brexit election.</p>
      <p>At least three different groups have set up new websites telling members of the public how they can vote tactically to deliver a parliament with the best chance of stopping Brexit.</p>
      <p>Best for Britain launched <a href="https://getvoting.org/">its tactical voting website</a> first, using a poll of more than 40,000 people fed through an analysis based on voter demographics, plus the voting record and pledges of the individual candidates. Lawyer and campaigner Gina Miller launched <a href="https://www.remainunited.org/">her site</a> next, based on a smaller survey but using similar demographic models. The People’s Vote campaign has focused on just 100 seats <a href="https://tactical-vote.uk/">on its website</a>. It uses a mix of polling data and demographic analysis, as well as past election results, but its choices are more hand-picked based on what candidates have argued for rather than their parties.</p>
      <p>Brexiteer businessman Arron Banks also <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/election-2019-arron-banks-tells-leavers-to-ditch-nigel-farage-and-back-tories-9gbltkz5c">threatened to launch his own tactical voting site</a> for pro-Brexit voters if Nigel Farage refused to stand his Brexit Party candidates down and insisted on fighting the Tories. The threat remains live despite Farage deciding to back off in 317 seats, as Banks has <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/general-election-2019-nigel-farage-longtime-ally-arron-banks-warns-him-he-has-48-hours-to-save-a4285636.html">urged him to go further,</a> while Farage has refused to compromise.</p>
      <p>Joe Twyman, director of polling firm Deltapoll, said tactical voting is unlikely to make a difference at the election on December 12 — but argued some impact could not be ruled out entirely.</p>

      <p>“Our polling at the moment shows just under 10 percent of people say they are considering tactical voting,” he said. “Ten percent is not going to make much difference at a national level.” He added: “I think the sites have the potential to make a small impact in a small number of constituencies. In such a complicated multidimensional campaign, as we're seeing at the moment, that small impact in a small number of seats could have an important role.”</p>
      <p>Depending on the outcome of the election, each MP could matter a great deal. If it throws up a hung parliament or a small majority on either side, the future of Brexit could hang in the balance when crucial Commons votes loom.</p>
      <p>However, making even a small impact in each seat using tactical voting will not be easy. One problem is that each pro-EU tactical voting site comes up with different recommendations for some constituencies. In Don Valley, for example, held by Brexiteer Labour MP Caroline Flint (she even voted for the Brexit deal put forward by Theresa May), Best for Britain suggests voting for the Liberal Democrats, Gina Miller suggests voting Labour and the People’s Vote campaign is yet to decide.</p>
      <p>The semi-marginal seat is a lose-lose for anti-Brexit campaigners, because voting Lib Dem could split the pro-referendum Labour vote and help the Tories win, and Flint is also unlikely to vote for a second referendum if she gets elected.</p>
      <p>The sudden surge in tactical voting sites based on a single issue raises the question of whether the election is in fact just another referendum on Brexit in disguise. It also highlights the flaws of Britain's first-past-the-post voting system, where the candidate who wins the most votes in each constituency claims the seat, while all other votes are discarded.</p>
      <p>Darren Hughes, chief executive of the Electoral Reform Society, said the first-past-the-post system is “broken” because it is forcing voters to “change their [voting] behavior to mask its failings.” ERS polling suggests almost a quarter of people could vote tactically on December 12. The problem is that the winner-takes-all nature of the voting system maintains two-party dominance and stops smaller movements, and the issues they champion, from getting a look-in. It is also criticized for allowing a party to win a Commons majority with a small percentage of the national vote.</p>
      <p>“If we had a fair, proportional voting system — as in Scotland and most of the developed world — this problem simply wouldn’t exist,” Hughes added. “You [could] vote for who you want, and if your first choice doesn’t stand a chance, your second choice is counted instead.”</p>
