      <p>A Juvenile court sitting in Owerri on Thursday ordered that Nkiruka, a mother of four, charged with alleged child trafficking, be remanded in a correctional facility, pending legal advice.</p>
      <p>The police charged Kamalu with two counts of conspiracy and child trafficking.</p>
      <p>Magistrate A.O. Odioyenma ordered that the case file be transferred to the office of Director of Public Prosecution.</p>
      <p>She said though bail was at the discretion of the court, the matter before her was a serious offence.</p>
      <p>She adjourned until January 16, 2020, for DPP reports.</p>
      <p>Earlier, the Prosecution Counsel, M.C. Eboh, told the court that Kamalu, jumped bail in after being admitted to bail by a High Court in Owerri, where she is standing trial for the acquisition of property under false pretences.</p>
