      <p><b>Jonathan Nolan</b> and <b>Lisa Joy</b>, creators of HBO’s <i>Westworld</i>, have brought their Executive Producing talents to a new sci-fi thriller series entitled <b><i>The Peripheral</i></b>, based on a book by <b>William Gibson</b>. The series is in development and has finally landed at Amazon, where it first got off the ground. Deadline provided the following rundown:</p>
      <blockquote><i>The Peripheral </i>centers on Flynne Fisher, a woman trying to hold together the pieces of her broken family in a forgotten corner of tomorrow’s America. Flynne is smart, ambitious, and doomed. She has no future. Until the future comes calling for her. <i>The Peripheral</i> is master storyteller William Gibson’s dazzling, hallucinatory glimpse into the fate of mankind — and what lies beyond.</blockquote>
      <p>Nolan and Joy said in a statement:</p>
      <blockquote>“35 years ago, William Gibson invented the future. With <i>The Peripheral </i>he brings us another look, and his vision is as clear, intoxicating, and terrifying as ever. All of us at Kilter are incredibly proud to be supporting Vincenzo and Scott’s brilliant vision for bringing Gibson’s work to the screen.”</blockquote>
      <p><b>Jennifer Salke</b>, Head of Amazon Studios added:</p>
      <blockquote>“We’re thrilled to announce <i>The Peripheral </i>as our first project with Jonah, Lisa, Athena and their talented team at Kilter Films. This story calls for a masterful level of talent to bring acclaimed author William Gibson’s science fiction thriller to life. We are excited to partner with Warner Bros. Television, Oscar-nominated writer Scott B. Smith and Vincenzo Natali in bringing this fantastic new series to our global Prime Video customers.”</blockquote>
      <p><i>The Peripheral</i> is being directed by <b>Vincenzo Natali</b>, known for <i>Splice</i> and <i>In the Tall Grass</i>, as well as directing episodes of <i>The Strain</i> and <i>Westworld</i>. This sounds like a solid team for bringing this project together. Are you a fan of their collective work? Will you be checking out <i>The Peripheral</i> when it comes to Amazon?</p>
