      <p>The Fitbit Inspire HR is the Fitbit we'd recommend to most people offering everything most people are looking for a fitness tracker. Now there's a great reason to take the plunge with two retailers offering free smart speakers.</p>
      <p>Currys are offering the <a href="http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=1599&amp;awinaffid=254429&amp;clickref=06-3777875-11-0000000&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.currys.co.uk%2Fgbuk%2Fsmart-tech%2Fsmart-tech%2Fsmart-watches-and-fitness%2Ffitness-trackers%2Ffitbit-inspire-hr-fitness-white-nest-mini-chalk-bundle-10201456-pdt.html">Fitbit and Google Nest Mini for just £74.99</a>. This is a huge saving of £64 on the regular price if they're bought separately. </p>
      <p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, Amazon has matched the deal, offering it for the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Inspire-Fitness-Auto-Exercise-Recognition-Tracking/dp/B081FRSVN7?ascsubtag=06-3777875-11-0000000">exact same price but with the Amazon Echo Dot instead</a>. Buying these two products separately would cost £114.03, so you're saving almost £40 with this deal.</p>
      <p>When we reviewed the <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/review/activity-trackers/fitbit-inspire-hr-3694467/">Fitbit Inspire HR</a> in April, it was selling for the RRP of £89.99. Now you can save £15 <i>and </i>get either smart speaker for free. </p>
      <p>The latest Amazon Echo Dot and Google's Nest Mini are both excellent devices, offering voice-controlled music, podcasts, smart home control and much more in a compact package. </p>
      <p>Which is best for you will ultimately come down to whether you prefer Alexa or the Google Assistant, but neither are likely to disappoint. If you're already in the market for a fitness tracker, this could be the perfect time to get your first smart speaker at the same time. </p>
      <p>Currys' deal comes as a part of its <a href="http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=1599&amp;awinaffid=254429&amp;clickref=06-3777875-11-0000000&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.currys.co.uk%2Fgbuk%2Findex.html">'Why Wait?' sale</a>, which kicks off Black Friday savings two weeks in advance. While Currys will separately host a Black Friday sale, which you can <a href="http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=1599&amp;awinaffid=254429&amp;clickref=06-3777875-11-0000000&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.currys.co.uk%2Fgbuk%2Fblack-friday-785-commercial.html">register</a> for to get early deals notifications, the retailer does promise deal prices will not be lower then. If current deal prices are further reduced on Black Friday, Currys will refund customers the difference.</p>
      <p>Black Friday is on <b>29 November</b> this year, though like Currys' 'Why Wait?' event, sales from several retailers and brands have <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/feature/internet/black-friday-2019-3661756/">already started</a>.</p>
