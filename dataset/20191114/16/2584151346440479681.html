      <h1>Dutch investigators appeal for help tying Russia to downed aircraft</h1>
      <h2>New appeal for witnesses says an intercepted phone call may implicate Russia’s longtime defense minister in the shooting down of MH-17.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T16:04:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 16:04</time> by <a rel="author">David M. Herszenhorn</a></address>
      <p>The Dutch-led investigation into the missile strike that destroyed a passenger airliner over eastern Ukraine in July 2014 issued a new call for public assistance on Thursday, hoping to corroborate evidence indicating Russian government officials had a role in attack.</p>
      <p>The flight, Malaysia Airlines 17 from Amsterdam to Kuala Lampur, known as MH-17, was shot down on July 17, 2014, killing all 298 people on board.</p>
      <p>The Dutch-led Joint Investigation Team (JIT) had previously <a href="https://www.politie.nl/en/news/2019/june/19/prosecution-of-four-suspects-for-downing-flight-mh17.html">identified four suspects</a>, including three Russians with ties to the Kremlin's security services, who will be prosecuted for shooting down the aircraft using a Russian BUK missile system, if they are ever apprehended.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, the JIT issued its public call for help, formally called a "<a href="https://www.politie.nl/themas/flight-mh17/witness-appeal-crash-mh17.html#alinea-title-russian-influence-on-the-donetsk-peoples-republic">witness appeal</a>," saying it had evidence of the possible involvement of senior Russian government officials, including the defense minister, Sergei Shoigu.</p>
      <p>"The JIT is looking for information on the individuals within the military and administrative hierarchy who enabled the shooting down of MH17 in Eastern Ukraine using a BUK TELAR," it said. "The JIT wants to get in touch with further witnesses who are able to testify about these command lines and the role that Russian government officials might have had."</p>
      <p>The investigators on Thursday also released new details about intercepted phone calls that potentially implicate Shoigu and others.</p>
      <p>"Leaders of the armed group ‘Donetsk People's Republic’ (DPR) maintained contact with Russian government officials about Russian military support," the JIT said in a statement. "These leaders included Alexander Borodai, self-proclaimed ‘prime minister’, and defendant Igor Girkin, self-proclaimed ‘defense minister’. They communicated with Sergey Aksyonov, the Russian-appointed leader in Crimea and Vladislav Surkov, a high ranking official of the Russian government."</p>
      <p>Surkov is a close adviser to Russian President Vladimir Putin who served as the Kremlin's counterpart to Kurt Volker, the former United States special envoy for the Ukraine crisis. Volker resigned <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2019/09/28/trump-ukraine-kurt-volker-1517874">over his role</a> in events that led to the ongoing impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump.</p>
      <p>"Recent analysis of witness statements and other information revealed that Russian influence on the DPR went beyond military support and that the ties between Russian officials and DPR-leaders appear closer," the JIT said. "The intensity of Russian influence is relevant to investigating further individuals involved in the downing of MH17. That is why today the JIT releases this new appeal for witnesses."</p>
      <p>The JIT said that in a phone call at the beginning of July 2014, a DPR-member told a local commander that "men are coming with a mandate from Shoigu."  The DPR member said that these men "will kick the local warlords out of the units," and "people from Moscow" will take over the command, the JIT Said.</p>
