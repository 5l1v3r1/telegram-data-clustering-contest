      <p>Accra, Nov. 14, GNA - Mr. Abdul Haye Yartey, President of the Ghana Bodybuilding and Fitness Association (GBFA), has expressed satisfaction with the performance of the national bodybuilding team, the Black Muscles, at the just ended World Bodybuilding Championship held in United Arab Emirates (UAE).</p>
      <p>Ghana presented three athletes at the just ended International Federation of Fitness and Bodybuilding (IFBB) championship.</p>
      <p>Godwin Frimpong placed seventh(85kg), Derrick Marley 11th (75kg) while Peudam Abubakar placed fifth (70kg)  in their respective categories.</p>
      <p>According to Mr. Yartey, the Championship offered their athletes the needed exposure on the international stage and was hopeful that future championships would produce medals for Ghana.</p>
      <p>''We met our expectations because it was the first time Ghanaian bodybuilders mounted the international stage and gained the needed experience.</p>
      <p>''The first experience was good and I believe we can now target some medals going into the future. We did well despite the stern competition from other countries.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the National Bodybuilding Championship dubbed ''Man Ghana'' is slated for December 7, 2019 as athletes compete for a place in the national team.</p>
