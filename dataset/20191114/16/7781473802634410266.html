      <h1>2020 Tata Altroz spotted testing ahead of December 3 unveiling</h1>

      <p>The Tata Altroz has been spotted testing again. Tata Motors seems to be conducting some final testing on the new premium hatchback ahead of its India unveiling on December 3. The Altroz will compete with cars like the <a href="http://overdrive.in/cars/maruti-suzuki/baleno-m443/">Maruti Suzuki Baleno</a>, <a href="http://overdrive.in/cars/honda/jazz-m414/">Honda Jazz</a>, <a href="http://overdrive.in/cars/hyundai/elite-i20-m334/">Hyundai Elite i20</a> and the <a href="http://overdrive.in/cars/volkswagen/polo-m172/">Volkswagen Polo</a>.</p>

      <p>These spy shots reaffirm what we already know of the Altroz. The Tata Altroz has large lighting elements in the front bumper. The complexity of the design is evident from the side profile though, which shows off its multi-layered layout. The Altroz carries on with Impact 2.0 design philosophy that debuted on the Harrier but still carries traits of earlier Tata hatchbacks. The Altroz is essentially the production version of the 45X concept shown at the 2018 Auto Expo.</p>

      <p>There are some interesting design elements throughout, like the split roof spoiler, turn blinkers mounted along the edge of the front door, pillar mounted rear door handles and a unique shape for the glasshouse. The black panel around the window-sills seem better highlighted here and the DRL combined with the fog lamps are also easily visible.</p>

      <p>Power for the Altroz is expected to come from a 1.2-litre turbocharged petrol engine and a 1.5-litre turbocharged diesel. Tata is also expected to make available a 1.2-litre naturally-aspirated petrol engine to achieve a more competitive entry price point.</p>
      <p>The Altroz is based on Tata's ALFA (Agile Light Flexible Advanced) modular architecture and is <a href="http://overdrive.in/news/2019-geneva-motor-show-tata-h2x-suv-showcased-to-take-on-maruti-suzuki-ignis/">expected to spawn other body styles in the years to come</a>.</p>

      <p>The Altroz will feature keyless entry and go, 16-inch rims, a flat-bottom steering wheel, automatic climate control and body-coloured bezels around the AC vents. The dashboard has a multi-layered design too and will feature <a href="http://overdrive.in/reviews/2019-tata-harrier-first-drive-review/">instrumentation similar to the Harrier's</a> - featuring an analogue speedometer and a large multi-info display for displaying other vehicular data. The infotainment too is similar to the Harrier's albeit smaller in size but with a similar user interface.</p>
      <p>We expect the Tata Altroz to be launched in India by early 2020, with prices starting from around Rs 5.5 lakh, ex-showroom.</p>
