      <p>At the 2019 BMW Test Fest – an event hosted by BMW USA – we got the chance to drive some of the latest and greatest BMWs. Some of the driving included a Track Day where we were fortunate to race the BMW M5, M8, M340i, Z4 M40i, X4 M and MINI JCW. The video below shows some of the footage captured at the event, including exhaust and engine sounds, some slides and lots of fun.</p>
      <p>Some of our reviews went live already, like the <a href="https://www.bmwblog.com/2019/11/12/test-drive-bmw-m8-competition-coupe-refined-violence/">BMW M8 Competition Coupe</a> and the <a href="https://www.bmwblog.com/2019/11/11/test-drive-2020-bmw-m235i-xdrive-a-new-kind-of-bmw/">M235i Gran Coupe</a>. But we have a few more stories in the pipeline.</p>

      <p>This year’s star at the BMW Test Fest was the all-new BMW M8 Coupe, one of the most powerful cars in the BMW lineup. As Nico said in his review, “With 617 hp and 553 lb-ft of torque, from its 4.4 liter twin-turbocharged V8, the BMW M8 Competition detonates, firing forward with an almost frightening amount of thrust. Straight sections of BMW’s test track in Spartanburg disappeared in an explosion of noise and speed. It’s actually shocking how fast it is, especially out of corners, where its all-wheel drive grip keeps all of those 617 rampaging horses glued to the tarmac.”</p>
      <p>You can also hear Nico talk about his experience at this event on the <a href="https://bmwblog-podcast.pinecast.co/episode/85e54b6d5fde437e/alpina-b7-m8-coupe-m235i-gran-coupe-rolls-royce-cullinan-black-badge">BMWBLOG Podcast</a>.</p>
      <p>The X4 M was another beast that joined the track convoy, as well as the BMW Z4 M40i which proves that it can keep up with the Big Boys. An M340i and a MINI Clubman JCW were thrown in the mix, while the leading car was the BMW M5 Competition driven by the BMW Chief Instructor Matt Mullins.</p>
      <p>The fairly short clip below gives us a look at these cars on the track at the M Performance School in Spartanburg.
