      <p>KARDINYA Park Shopping Centre could start its large-scale redevelopment as early as next June as it targets Christmas 2021 to unveil a modern shopping and social precinct.</p>
      <p>Owner Con Berbatis is close to finalising a development application for a $100m redevelopment that could include apartments, community swimming pool, a gymnasium and other non-online drawcards.</p>
      <p>“Things such as cinemas, taverns, swimming pools and gymnasiums are on-the-spot services,” he said.</p>
      <p>“The idea behind having a swimming pool is that parents can drop off their kids for a swimming lesson and then do some shopping.</p>
      <p>“There’s an international trend, very common in Asia, that you live in an apartment and you host events at a nearby tavern.</p>
      <p>“We are looking at about 140 to 150 apartments on site, which are perfect for people looking to downsize.”</p>
      <p>He said he intended to submit the application in coming weeks and hoped approvals could be in place by in March, which would allow construction to begin mid-year.</p>
      <p>One potential stumbling block to the timeframe is that the City of Melville needs to first put in place an activity centre plan which could take up to 12 months to complete.</p>
      <p>City of Melville chief executive Marten Tieleman said the scale of the development proposed acted as a catalyst for an activity centre plan to be created.</p>
      <p>“For Kardinya, it would help us ensure that any development of the shopping centre is undertaken in a way that reflects the wider objectives for the area, and importantly considers adjoining properties and designs for compatibility with nearby residential areas, transport networks and infrastructure,” he said.</p>
      <p>“It is an exciting time as we see new developments being proposed across all of our centres and this is no exception.</p>
      <p>“The opportunity for new amenity, revitalisation, more jobs and growth in the Kardinya area can only be a positive outcome for all the community.”</p>
      <p>People can drop in to Kardinya Park next Thursday, November 21, between 3pm and 7pm to view the redevelopment plans and give suggestions.</p>
      <p>Dr Bebatis expected regular shoppers would be happy to see the back of the centre’s sloped car parking area, which will be replaced by decked parking that will virtually double the current 750 parking bays.</p>
