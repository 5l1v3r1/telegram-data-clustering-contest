      <p>ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — A U.S. national and suspected Islamic State group member, who has spent three days in a no man’s land between Turkey and Greece after Ankara tried to deport him, will be repatriated to the United States, Turkey’s Interior Ministry said Thursday.</p>
      <p>A Ministry statement said the United States has agreed to take him in and that the procedures to repatriate him are underway.</p>
      <p>The move comes a day after Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan met with U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington.</p>
      <p>The man was stuck in the heavily militarized zone after Turkey tried to expel him to Greece but Athens refused him entry.</p>
      <p>Turkish media have identified him as 39-year-old Mohammad Darwis B. and said he was an American citizen of Jordanian background.</p>
      <p>The Ministry said the man had asked to be deported to Greece.</p>
