      <p>(Reuters) - Lotto Soudal are optimistic that rider Gerben Thijssen will recover from a horrific crash at the Ghent Six Day that saw him suffer three small brain haemorrhages.</p>
      <p>The 21-year-old Belgian also broke his collarbone and three ribs when he crashed on the final lap of the supersprint after contact with Danish rider Oliver Wulff Frederiksen.</p>
      <p>Lotto Soudal said Thijssen was in stable condition in intensive care at the UZ Hospital in Ghent.</p>
      <p>“Fortunately there is some slight optimism,” the team said on Twitter. “Less than 18 hours after his terrible crash, Gerben was able to have a small conversation with his family.”</p>
