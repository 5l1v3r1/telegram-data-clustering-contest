      <p>HONOLULU -- A Hawaii man was surfing with his girlfriend when -- instead of hanging 10 -- he knelt down on one knee on his board and proposed.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/2019/11/12/he-proposed-while-surfing-then-lost-ring-luckily-he-was-prepared/">Hawaii News Now </a>reported that Lauren Oiye said yes just before Chris Garth dropped the ring in the ocean.</p>
      <p>Multiple photographers nearby captured the Sunday moment.</p>
      <p>Luckily, he had a spare.</p>
      <p>Garth said he knew it could go wrong, so he used a stand-in while they were out in the water. The real ring was on shore at Queen's Beach in Waikiki, where the two met years before.</p>
      <p>Details about the rings were not released.</p>
