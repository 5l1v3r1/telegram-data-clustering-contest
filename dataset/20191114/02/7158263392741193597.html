      <p>It’s official: <a href="http://www.disneyplus.com/">Disney+</a> has finally dropped. The vault has been OPENED, ppl, and, um, more than 10 million people subscribed on the very first day it became available. So you might say that the mouse is in the hizzy. (Sorry, that was kind of a ’90s joke, but also, the ’90s were prime Disney-obsessing times!)</p>

      <p>Unless you’ve been living under a rock, you’ve probably already heard about Disney’s new streaming service that just launched today—it has absolutely everything Disney to bring out your inner child. (Now all we need is a full archive of every Disney star’s “and you’re watching Disney Channel” commercial, plz and thank you.)</p>
      <p>
        <a href="http://www.disneyplus.com/welcome/bundle">Sign up for Disney+ here!</a>
      </p>
      <h3>So what does this mean exactly?</h3>
      <p>Basically, you can stream all Disney all the time. And the service includes everything from Pixar to Marvel to live-action movies and TV series. Subscribers will also be able to download movies and TV shows and watch them without Wi-Fi, which is an absolute game changer for those long flights and car rides.</p>
      <p>And the service was so popular on its opening day that it actually <i>malfunctioned</i>. Yikes.</p>

      <h3>Can we expect all our old faves?</h3>
      <p>Yes! And people are excited, to say the least.</p>

      <p>In the mood for a little <i>Beauty and the Beast</i>? <i>The Lion King</i>? <i>Finding Nemo</i>? You name it; they’ve got it (that is, if the site is actually working). From <i>Monsters, Inc.</i> to <i>Star Wars</i> to <i>10 Things I Hate About You</i>. Even <i>Boy Meets World</i> and literally 30 seasons of <i>The Simpsons </i>are also ready for your viewing pleasure.</p>
      <h3>Wait…and new stuff too?</h3>
      <p>YES, we’re telling you—Disney+ will probs not disappoint.</p>
      <p>Anna Kendrick and Bill Hader’s new Christmas movie <i>Noelle</i> has launched along with the streaming service—Anna plays Santa Claus’s daughter, who has to help save the holiday when her brother, played by Bill, goes missing.</p>

      <p>And a <i>Star Wars </i>spin-off, <i><a href="http://www.disneyplus.com/welcome/the-mandalorian-bundle">The Mandalorian</a></i>, will also be available, with new episodes dropping every Friday.</p>

      <p>Also, <i><a href="http://www.disneyplus.com/welcome/high-school-musical-bundle">High School Musical: The Musical: The Series</a></i> AND a Kristen Bell–produced show called <i>Encore</i> have also dropped. Kristen reunites former casts of high school musicals to relive their theater glory days. (You’ll def be getting your musical fix, just FYI.)</p>
      <p>And that new <i>Lizzie McGuire </i>sequel will also be available <i>eventually</i>. (They’re still in production.) Lizzie is enough for me to subscribe, TBH.</p>

      <h3>Okay, but how much will it cost?</h3>
      <p>The service costs $6.99 per month (or $69.99 per year!). You can also purchase a Hulu and Disney+ bundle for $12.99 a month. And customers of Verizon can get one year of the streaming service for free.</p>
      <p>All we’re saying is, prepare to do absolutely nothing but revel in your childhood TV shows for the next few days (okay, year). <a href="http://www.disneyplus.com/welcome/bundle">Get the whole welcome package here!</a></p>
