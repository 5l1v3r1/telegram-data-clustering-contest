      <h1>Canaan Creative Sets Terms, Plans to Rake in $100 Million in Upcoming US IPO</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T02:12:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 02:12</time> by <a rel="author">Joeri Cant</a></address>
      <p>Chinese cryptocurrency mining giant Canaan Creative has announced terms for its United States initial public offering (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/ipo">IPO</a>) planned for later this month.</p>
      <p>On Nov. 13, Renaissance Capital reported that Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price-index">BTC</a>) mining giant Canaan Creative <a href="https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/66013/Crypto-mining-company-Canaan-sets-terms-for-%24100-million-US-IPO">announced</a> its plans to raise $100 million by offering 10 million American depositary shares (ADS) at a price range from $9 to $11. This would potentially put the company’s overall market value at some $1.6 billion, with an enterprise value of $1.4 billion.</p>
      <p>An ADS is a U.S. dollar-denominated equity share of a foreign-based company available for purchase on an American stock exchange. </p>
      <h3>First SEC filing for China-based mining firm</h3>
      <p>In October, Canaan Creative <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/chinese-cryptocurrency-mining-giant-files-for-400-million-ipo-in-us">filed</a> with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for an IPO intended to raise $400 million, with plans to be listed on the Nasdaq under the ticker CAN. If Canaan is successful, the mining company could become the first China-based mining firm to see public trading in the U.S. </p>
      <p>As part of its registration to conduct an IPO in the United States, Canaan <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-miner-canaan-creatives-2019-revenue-nears-100m-ahead-of-ipo">revealed</a> its Q3 net profit to be 94 million yuan ($13 million). Although the company generated revenue of just over $134 million in the first nine months of 2019, weaker performance early on has still resulted in a total comprehensive income loss of around $31 million.</p>
      <h3>One of three Chinese mining giants</h3>
      <p>Canaan, which is one of the three major Chinese crypto mining companies alongside Bitmain and Yibang International, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-miner-canaan-creatives-2019-revenue-nears-100m-ahead-of-ipo">previously</a> attempted to launch an IPO in Hong Kong and China, but both attempts failed after regulators pored over their business model and financial outlook. Bitmain, which enjoys a 75% market share of the crypto hardware market worldwide, has likewise tried to complete an IPO, thus far meeting with <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitmains-new-ipo-attempt-in-jeopardy-as-in-fighting-goes-public">failure</a>. </p>
      <p>In October, Bitmain <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitmain-launches-worlds-largest-crypto-mining-facility-in-texas">opened</a> what it claimed to be the world’s largest facility for Bitcoin mining in Rockdale, Texas, which was completed thanks to a collaboration with the Rockdale Municipal Development District and Canadian technology firm DMG Blockchain Solutions.</p>
