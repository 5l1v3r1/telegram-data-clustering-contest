      <h1>Black Friday came early for AirPods 2 with Wireless Charging Case, now just $5 more than the base model</h1>

      <p>Walk into an Apple store right now and buy a pair of entry-level AirPods, and it’ll cost you $159. Want to upgrade to the model with the wireless charging case included? That’ll cost you and additional $40. But what if it only cost another $5 to upgrade instead of $40? Who in their right mind would bother with the base model!? It seems crazy, but that’s exactly what’s happening right now on Amazon — hurry and you can snag <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Wireless-Charging-Latest/dp/B07PYLT6DN?tag=b0c55-20">Apple AirPods 2 with Wireless Charging Case</a> for just $164.99 instead of $200!</p>
