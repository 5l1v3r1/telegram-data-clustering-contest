        <b>From Alison and Dan’s reading list for this episode:</b>

      <p><a href="https://hbr.org/2003/01/how-to-motivate-your-problem-people"><b>HBR</b>: How to Motivate Your Problem People</a> by Nigel Nicholson — “Everyone knows that good managers motivate with the power of their vision, the passion of their delivery, and the compelling logic of their reasoning. Add in the proper incentives, and people will enthusiastically march off in the right direction.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Helping-People-Change-Coaching-Compassion/dp/1633696561/"><b>Book</b>: <i>Helping People Change: Coaching with Compassion for Lifelong Learning and Growth</i></a> by Richard E. Boyatzis, Melvin Smith, and Ellen Van Oosten — “In our attempt to coach a person seeking help, most of us naturally take a problem-solving approach, focusing on the gaps between where they are and where we think they should or could be. We are trying to <i>fix</i> them. This does not work well, if at all, to motivate sustained learning, change, or adaptation.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://hbr.org/2016/03/a-guide-to-managing-a-volunteer-workforce"><b>HBR</b>: A Guide to Managing a Volunteer Workforce</a> by Joe McCannon and Hahrie Han— “The belief that you need to convince, cajole, or manipulate people into joining your cause is wrong. People who volunteer generally don’t do it because you’ve worn them down with messaging. Once someone has expressed interest in volunteering, strive to learn what their dreams are in order to help make them come true.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://hbr.org/2018/01/how-to-tell-an-employee-they-didnt-get-a-promotion"><b>HBR</b>: How to Tell an Employee They Didn’t Get a Promotion</a> by Rebecca Knight — “It’s no fun to tell employees that they’ve been passed over for a promotion — especially if you value them and their work. What’s the best way to deliver the bad news? What can you say to make sure they don’t lose interest in their jobs or hold grudges against you or the decision makers?”</p>
