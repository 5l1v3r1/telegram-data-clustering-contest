      <p>East Meath is a community' clinging on by its fingertips' that's according to Fine Gael councillor Sharon Tolan who is calling for extra Garda resources to be implemented into Laytown/Bettystwn following a spate of drug-related incidents in the area over the last week. </p>
      <p>The community has been coming to terms with the shocking fatal shooting of dad of three Richie Carberry outside his home in Castlemartin Drive on November 4th. The 39-year-old was gunned down after getting out of his car on the Castlemartin Drive estate.</p>
      <p>It is understood the gunman had been waiting for Carberry, who is originally from Coolock, Dublin, and was classified as one of the main players in the Drogheda feud.</p>
      <p>In the latest blow to the community €90,000 of Cannabis was discovered by the Meath Divisional Drugs Unit during a planned search of a house off Eastham Road earlier this week. A total of 62 cannabis plants were discovered along with 2kgs of cannabis which was ready for packaging and distribution.</p>
      <p>This discovery follows the seizure of cocaine with an estimated street value of €1.4m in Drogheda earlier this week. As part of an intelligence-led operation under Operation Stratus, local Gardai from Drogheda Garda station intercepted a vehicle at the Donore Road Industrial Estate in Drogheda.</p>

      <p>"The Gardai have has had some significant discoveries this week, it has to be doing damage to the drug trade," commented Cllr Tolan adding "It's worrying that it is on our doorstep again but I think this is on the doorstep of every community across the country.</p>
      <p>"I just hope that they are going to stay on top of this and make sure that they lift these criminals and ensure that guns and drugs are off our streets.</p>
      <p>"The Garda Commissioner Drew Harris is coming to our JCC next month and I have it on the agenda that Laytown Garda Station is not fit for purpose. People might say that a new Garda station won't keep drugs off the streets but it will go a long way in helping to resource our Gardai and will provide proper premises for Gardai to work from. The current station is not fit for purpose it's an old bungalow in a housing estate.</p>
      <p>"There's nowhere for somebody to come in confidentially and give information. We have come a long way over the past decade in community policing and we don't seem to have come on at all over the last 20 years in Laytown Bettystown."</p>
      <p>"There are a lot more decent law-abiding citizens in the area than there are criminals and if we stay strong and ensure that we keep the pressure on the Gardai then it will remain a good decent law-abiding society but we are clinging to it by our fingertips at the moment particularly in the struggle against drugs.</p>

        <b>The seaside town needs more Garda support</b>
      </p>
      <p>Independent councillor for Laytown/Bettystown Sharon Keogan started the Duleek Drug-Free Town project when it emerged that children as young as 12 were being sent by dealers to knock on doors of homes looking for debt payments. She says she is now planning on bringing an anti-drugs roadshow to towns and villages around the county to educate communities on how to deal with drugs in their area.  </p>
      <p>"The public is engaging with the Gardai and reporting these drug dealers. The fear factor has gone out of it. Drug dealers operate on fear. They intimidate the people that are selling for them and therefore families and communities are intimidated. The less power we give them the better it is for all.</p>
      <p>"The Feel Good Project here in Duleek has made a huge difference. People are talking about mental health a lot more. Having these programmes in the village accessible to people so they don't have to go too far for help or advice when it's needed and having a drugs liaison officer there within the Gardai is also important.</p>
      <p>"I'm planning to go on a roadshow tour trying to get communities to stand up against drugs and give them confidence going forward. We have done it here in Duleek. I have no problem standing up against the drug dealers in this country." </p>
