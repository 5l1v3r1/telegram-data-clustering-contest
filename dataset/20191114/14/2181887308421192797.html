      <h1>Intel's Ponte Vecchio Xe GPU is named after a bridge and isn't for you</h1>
      <h2>We'd have called it Bridget</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T14:13:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 14:13</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theinquirer.net/author/profile/3180/roland-moore-colyer" target="_blank">Roland Moore-Colyer</a></address>
      <p><b>"ITSA ME, PONTE VECCHIO"</b> is what <a href="https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/3083039/intel-xe-dual-gpu-support-linux-driver">Intel's Xe GPU</a> might say if it were to introduce itself, as the chipmaker has named it after a stone bridge in Italy's Florence.</p>
      <p>'Why?' you might ask. We have no idea, we'd have to answer. But Intel has a thing with stuff related to body's of water; see its Ice Lake and Comet Lake CPU code names for reference. Perhaps Ponte Vecchio will be the bridge that links Intel's processor building with a foray into dedicated graphics.</p>
      <p>Regardless as to the why, that's the code/family name given to Intel's dedicated GPU tech it's been beavering away on, according to <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/intels-first-xe-graphics-processor-is-called-ponte-vecchio"><i>Videocardz</i></a>.</p>
      <p>The Ponte Vecchio Xe GPU will be based on a 7-nanometre fabrication process, which would seemingly put it on par with the 7nm node that AMD's Navi-based graphics cards are on.</p>
      <p>But Ponte Vecchio won't be used as a gaming or consumer-level GPU, rather it'll be designed to handle compute tasks in exascale computing situations, providing ultra-high cache and high memory bandwidth to presumably handle large amounts of data.</p>
      <p><i>Videocardz</i> noted that Ponte Vecchio GPUs will be part of a project dubbed Aurora, which is an exascale computer with 7nm Sapphire Rapids Xeon CPUs and the Xe GPU, supplemented by a unified programming model facilitated by Intel's oneAPI. Aurora is set to be showcased on 17 November, though it's due a release in 2021.</p>
      <p>And for folks not into exascale computing - and we can't blame you - this news is interesting as it shows Intel is making progress with its dedicated GPU tech. And that progress means we could see PC and consumer-grade Xe graphics cards early on in 2020; <a href="https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/3082317/intel-xe-june-2020-release-teased">we know they are coming next year</a>, we just have no firmed up release date.</p>
      <p>Things are already heating up in the graphics card world, so Intel getting all up inside it next year could be particularly interesting, especially when <a href="https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/3083678/nvidia-rtx-3080-at-computex-2020-launch-rumour">Nvidia could reveal its next-gen graphics architecture</a> and <a href="https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/3080398/amd-navi-23-leak-nvidia-killer-ray-tracing-2020">AMD is meant to have a high-end Navi graphics card to show off in 2020</a> as well.
