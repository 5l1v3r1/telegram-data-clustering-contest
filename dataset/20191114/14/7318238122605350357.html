      <h1>The John Lewis Christmas advert 2019 is here</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T14:56:46+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 14:56</time> by <a rel="author">Euronews </a></address>
      <p>It's the time of year that heralds the beginning of the festive season for many in the UK — the annual release of the John Lewis Christmas advert.</p>
      <p>This year's edition sees an enthusiastic dragon called Edgar struggling to contain his excitement — and his fire breathing capabilities — as the Christmas activities begin.</p>
      <p>Just hours after the release on Thursday, the video had accumulated more than 1.2 million views and made up the top three trending topics on Twitter.</p>
      <p>Last year's festive advert from the retailer racked up around 14 million views in total.</p>

      <p>The 'John Lewis Christmas advert' phenomenon has in the last decade become part of a hotly-anticipated tradition in the UK, which bears some semblance to the iconic Christmas Coca Cola adverts recognised around the world.</p>
      <p>John Lewis began creating its Christmas adverts in 2007 by telling short emotional stories with cutesy characters meant to melt the heart.</p>
      <p>From 2008, it would use a re-worked and moving cover of popular songs in a tradition that became somewhat of a trademark on the ads.</p>
      <p>This year's advert is soundtracked by a Bastille cover of REO Speedwagon's <i>Can't Fight This Feeling</i>.</p>

      <p>The annual trend grew so big that it later inspired other highstreet brands in Britain to make their own versions of videos as part of a heartstring-pulling competition.</p>
      <p>Twitter even made its own advert last year featuring a real-life John Lewis — a computer science professor from the US whose Twitter account is overloaded each year by people posting about the retailers' advert.</p>
      <p>Such a trend is also reportedly backed up by the figures. In <a href="https://www.thedrum.com/news/2016/11/02/john-lewis-scoops-ipa-effectiveness-grand-prix-just-days-it-unwraps-its-christmas-ad">2016</a>, for every £1 spent returned £8 in profit.</p>
      <p>And <a href="https://www.retailgazette.co.uk/blog/2019/01/john-lewis-partnerships-christmas-sales-growth-fails-improve-profit-outlook/">last year</a>, the Christmas period reportedly saw a 1.4% year-on-year increase in the John Lewis-Waitrose partnership, despite a less successful year overall.</p>

      <p>This year, as in previous years, John Lewis is also cashing in further on the adverts by turning its Excitable Edgar character into a protagonist in a storybook and a cuddly toy.</p>
