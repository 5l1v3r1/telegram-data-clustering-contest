      <h1>Former Plymouth Argyle manager Ian Holloway on chances of I'm A Celebrity appearance</h1>
      <h2>Former football manager Harry Redknapp proved a huge hit with fans and went on to win in 2018</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T14:49:01+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 14:49</time> by <a rel="author">Jak Ball</a></address>
      <p>Former Plymouth Argyle manager Ian Holloway has revealed that he has not been asked to appear in <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out of Here</a> .</p>
      <p>Whilst the 56-year-old might not have had the call for the 2019 series he hasn't ruled out flying down under in the future.</p>
      <p>Holloway has admitted to being a big fan of the show and would likely prove to be a big hit with viewers, as did eventual king of the jungle Harry Redknapp last year.</p>
      <p>Former Arsenal, Crystal Palace and England striker Ian Wright is the ex-football man to get a place in the camp this year.</p>
      <p>He will compete in Bushtucker Trials alongside the likes of Caitlyn Jenner, Nadine Coyle, James Haskell and Kate Garraway.</p>
      <p>Holloway admitted it would be a tough task to enter the jungle in 2020, following on from Redknapp and Wright.</p>
      <p>"As a person, I would have hated to have competed with him [Ian Wright] because he’s such a wonderful fella, he’s so lively, he’s so enthusiastic. He’s a great bloke.</p>

      <p>"You wouldn’t want to be the third person to go on there from football when Harry Redknapp and Ian Wright both won and you then lose!</p>
      <p>"I’m a big fan of the show. It’s good for anyone who wants to lose a bit of weight.</p>
      <p>"I watched bits of it last year because everybody was talking about it and I thought Harry (Redknapp) was absolutely himself, his relationship with his wife is brilliant and he deserved to win it."</p>
      <p>Holloway, who managed <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/all-about/plymouth-argyle">the Pilgrims</a> between 2006/07, has said that the eating challenges wouldn't faze him as long as what he was eating was dead.</p>
      <p>Jumping out of a plane also wouldn't be a problem for him, whereas trials that involved snakes would be his biggest struggle.</p>
      <p>"They didn’t ask me did they? I think my son already put my name in it," Holloway told <a href="https://www.thesackrace.com/">The Sack Race</a>.</p>
      <p>"I’m not being funny but I was with Colin Murray a few months ago and he said ‘You should go on that’ and the people at Talksport think I should go on that because they know how afraid I am of snakes, they will find it so funny.</p>
      <p>"I’m absolutely terrified of snakes. I don’t really mind spiders but if I had to eat those bugs then I’d throw up. </p>
      <p>"Regarding snakes, I remember Shaun Ryder being bitten by one. That would have terrified me, I would have fainted.</p>

      <p>"Crocodiles? Yeah I’m bound to be bloody scared of them because they can eat you can’t they.</p>
      <p>"I wouldn’t worry about balls, they don’t bother me. It’s the things that are still alive that bother me or eyeballs, I would barf at that.</p>
      <p>"I have this reaction to anything I don’t like and I used to be really fussy as a kid, so I think I would struggle for a lot of reasons."</p>
      <p>And on heights, Holloway added: "I don’t know, because I’m so short I probably won’t be used to them.</p>
      <p>"I wouldn’t worry about jumping out a plane. That would be a challenge I love that."</p>
