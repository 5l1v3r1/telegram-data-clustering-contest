      <p>A second tornado touched down in Bergville, KwaZulu-Natal, on Thursday afternoon, the South African Weather Service (SAWS) confirmed to News24.Â </p>
      <p>Showan Marescia, a resident for 12 years in the area, took multiple videos of the sighting in the Jagersrust area just before 12:00.</p>
      <p>"I was on my way home from work and turned into my driveway. There were calm black clouds most of the day. However, as I drove into my garage I saw this funnel. The clouds are moving in circular motion. I have seen it touch down a few times," he told News24.</p>

      <p>This is the second tornado this week, with the first wreaking havoc in eMpolweni, New Hanover, on Tuesday afternoon, killing two people and injuring nearly 20.</p>
      <p>Marescia said it was the first tornado he had seen in the area, which sees thunder showers during this time of year, but nothing as severe as this.</p>
      <p>"There was lots of dust in the area."</p>
      <p>He said he was chasing the storm.</p>
      <p>"I am definitely into storm chasing. When I saw it, there was a lot of excitement and fear for residents in the area. I am checking up on people and making sure they are safe."</p>

      <p>"In recent times, we haven't seen a tornado in the [Bergville] area in at least the past 10 years," Wayne Venter from the SAWS told News24.</p>
      <p>He added that KZN is expected to experience more thunder showers on Thursday evening into Friday morning, with heavy rain along the coast, leading to flash flooding.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the KwaZulu-Natal Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta) indicated that preparations were in place to assist with any incidents resulting from the expected stormy weather.</p>
      <p>MEC for Cogta Sipho Hlomuka told the media that a Provincial Joint Operation Centre in eThekwini would coordinate responses across the province.</p>
