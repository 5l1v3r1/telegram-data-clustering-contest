      <h1>Anas Sarwar tells Nicola Sturgeon she's 'not being told the truth' about child cancer case scandal</h1>
      <h2>The First Minister has been urged to intervene over the whistleblower's claims about the super hospital in Glasgow</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T14:55:32+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 14:55</time> by <a rel="author">Paul Hutcheon, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/paul-hutcheon/</a></address>
      <p>First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has been urged to personally intervene over <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/claims-emerge-cancer-kid-died-20876487">allegations a child with cancer died</a> at Glasgow’s super hospital after contracting a water-based infection.</p>
      <p>In a heartfelt plea Labour MSP Anas Sarwar, who was contacted by a whistleblower, raised the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital (QEUH) campus scandal with Sturgeon at Holyrood.</p>
      <p>He said: “First Minister.. you aren’t being told the truth.”</p>
      <p>An official probe this year found “widespread contamination” in the water supply at the QEUH hospitals and found 23 cases of children in two cancer wards acquiring bloodstream infections in 2018. The hospitals are run by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde.</p>

      <p>However, the Record revealed yesterday that an internal investigation was also carried out in covering 2017, but it was never published.</p>
      <p>According to a whistleblower who got in touch with Glasgow MSP Sarwar, the doctor-led probe found another 26 infection cases in children and concluded that bacteria had led to the death of one of the kids.</p>
      <p>The results from the internal investigation were circulated within NHSGGC this year, but Sarwar said the child’s parents had not been informed.</p>
      <p>At First Minister’s Questions, Sarwar told Sturgeon that “something is seriously wrong” at the QEUH and said the case had “broken" him.</p>
      <p>He said: “I have had information shared with me which shows senior managers have been repeatedly alerted to the fact that a previous review failed to include cases of infection related to the water supply in 2017.</p>
      <p>“Central to this whistleblowing evidence is that there were 26 infections at the children’s cancer ward, and in one case a child died as a result. To this day, parents have never been told.”</p>

      <p>He added: “I implore you, for the sake of the staff who have been put in this unforgivable situation, for the sake of all the patients who use this hospital, for the sake of public trust in our institutions, but most of all for the sake of those parents particularly of the child that has lost their life, will you please personally intervene to seek answers?”</p>
      <p>Sturgeon replied: “The Health Secretary is personally involved in all of these issues, and regularly keeps me appraised of developments.”</p>
      <p>She added: “I, firstly, can’t even begin to imagine the pain for families who have lost loved ones, and it is because of that that we are absolutely determined that these matters are fully investigated.</p>
      <p>“The Government has been working closely with the health board and staff on the issue of infection in recent months.”</p>
      <p>Sarwar said of her answer: "I am disappointed that her response failed to address the serious issues raised.</p>
      <p>“I now implore her to reflect on this and personally intervene to seek answers, get justice for the families, and take the necessary actions so this never happens again.”</p>
