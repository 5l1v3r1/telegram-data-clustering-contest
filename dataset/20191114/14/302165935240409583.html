      <p>RENNES, Nov 14 — The world’s oldest captive white rhino, South African-born Sana, has died at the age of 55, the French zoo that she called home for the last 26 years said today.</p>
      <p>Born in 1964 in the Umfolozi National Park in South Africa’s eastern KwaZulu-Natal province, the southern white rhino was transported to Europe seven years later as a zoo attraction.</p>
      <p>Sana lived in several parks in Germany before arriving in 1993 at Planete Sauvage, a zoo in western France near the city of Nantes that had opened the previous year.</p>
      <p>The life expectancy of white rhinos in the wild is about 50 years, according to the Save the Rhino advocacy group.</p>
      <p>Sana required special care in her later years, the park said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Notably, she was no longer able to roll in the mud, a popular and crucial pastime that helps rhinos regulate their body temperature, prevent sunburn and ward off pesky insects.</p>
      <p>“Once a week, they coated her in green clay to help her skin stay hydrated and to stave off infections,” the park said.</p>
      <p>It added that Sana “always had a strong character, she was the one who set the rules.”</p>
      <p>Her death has “deeply affected” her caretakers, the zoo said.</p>
      <p>Adult white rhinos weigh between 1.8 and 2.5 tonnes, according to Save the Rhino.</p>
      <p>Their natural habitats are tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas and shrublands found in South Africa, Botswana, Kenya, Namibia, Swaziland, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Uganda.</p>
      <p>The square-lipped grazers, larger than their black cousins, are divided into southern and northern subspecies.</p>
      <p>The last male northern white rhino, Sudan, died in Kenya last year, leaving two sole captive female survivors, neither able to carry a calf.</p>
      <p>No northern white rhinos are left in the wild.</p>
      <p>In September, conservationists created two northern white rhino embryos from the two last females and sperm from deceased males, to one day implant into a surrogate mother in the hope of reviving the line.</p>
      <p>Save the Rhino says around 20,000 southern white rhinos — Sana’s tribe — are left in the world.</p>
      <p>Black rhinos, however, are considered critically endangered, with only about 5,000 left.</p>
