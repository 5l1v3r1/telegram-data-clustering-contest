      <p>SpongeBob, Patrick, and the rest of the Bikini Bottom gang return to the big screen next year. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/10/23/18015956/spongebob-squarepants-its-a-wonderful-sponge-cg-origin"><i>The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run</i></a><i> </i>is the third SpongeBob movie to hit theaters, but the first to sport an all-CGI SpongeBob.</p>
      <p>SpongeBob discovers that his beloved pet snail Gary is missing. If that sounds like the events of the 2005 episode <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8Nz2cmCp0">“Have You Seen This Snail?”</a>, good catch, you’ve watched a lot of <i>SpongeBob</i>. But the key difference is that this time Gary has been...dun, dun, dun....<i>snail-napped!</i> SpongeBob and Patrick set out on a quest to The Lost City of Atlantic City to find Gary, encountering a whole host of colorful characters — including Keanu Reeves’ disembodied face as a magical sage made out of a bundle of sage.</p>
      <p>In addition to Keanu Reeves, Reggie Watts, Snoop Dogg, and Awkwafina also join the regular <i>SpongeBob </i>voice cast.</p>
      <p><i>The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run</i> comes out on May 22, 2020.</p>
