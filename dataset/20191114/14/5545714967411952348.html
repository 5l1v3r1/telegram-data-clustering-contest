      <p>It wouldn't be an Xbox live stream without a quick word from Rare about <i>Sea of Thieves</i>. During today's X019 broadcast, the developer showed The Seabound Soul, a new narrative-focused content update.</p>

      <p>The latest free Tall Tale mission has to do with Captain Pendragon and a ship called the Ashen Dragon. (How very <i>Dark Souls </i>of you, Rare.) This format is business as usual for <i>Sea of Thieves</i>, but if you haven't done a Tall Tale yet, they're essentially a way to sneak story nuggets into the game's shared world.</p>
      <p>That's not the most interesting facet of The Seabound Soul, though. That honor goes to a new item.</p>
      <p>When the update goes live on November 20, <i>Sea of Thieves </i>players will be able to chuck firebombs at each other and load them into cannons. If that isn't worth logging on for, I don't know what is.</p>
