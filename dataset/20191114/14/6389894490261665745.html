      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T14:15:15+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 14:15</time> by <a rel="author">Stefan Boscia</a></address>
      <p>Rory Stewart today revealed he will rely on the general public to form much of his policy platform for his mayor of London campaign.</p>
      <p>His London Speaks initiative will see Stewart and campaigners collect ideas from people throughout London on how they would improve the capital.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Stewart said on a group call to campaigners last night that campaign volunteers will go door-to-door asking: “What would you change in your neighbourhood in the next week?”</p>
      <p>He said the ideas generated in the drive will make up the core of his manifesto.</p>
      <p>It comes after he said last week that he would create citizens’ assemblies if elected mayor next May to tackle issues such as knife crime.</p>
      <p>Stewart said that hundreds of groups would be formed to discuss ideas generated from his London Speaks initiative.</p>
      <p>“We would set up groups in each borough to discuss ideas [from the doorstop],” he said.</p>
      <p>“Then we need to move on to see if we could apply the lessons from each neighbourhood to the rest of London.”</p>

      <p>The former MP for Penrith and the Border announced in early October he would step down at the next election and stand for mayor of London as an independent.</p>
      <p>The former international development secretary gained attention during the Conservative leadership campaign over the summer.</p>
      <p>He finished fifth in the 10-person race, beating out more fancied candidates like foreign secretary Dominic Raab.</p>
      <p>Stewart’s grass roots drive to become mayor begins in earnest next Monday, with the first London Speaks event.</p>
      <p>“We are trying to build a movement,” Stewart told campaigners.</p>
      <p>“It’s going to be tough and we’re going to have to be willing to take some risks.”</p>

      <p>Stewart’s plans attracted scorn from some quarters of the Labour party.</p>
      <p>A Labour source joked: “Excellent news that Rory seems to have discovered ‘canvassing’.”</p>
