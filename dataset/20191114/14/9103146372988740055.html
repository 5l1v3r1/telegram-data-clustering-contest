      <p>It promotes open, coordinated and sustained earth observation data sharing and infrastructure for better research, policymaking, decisions and action across many disciplines. Its work focuses on three global priority engagement areas; UN 2030 agenda for sustainable development, the Paris Agreement and Sendai Framework for disaster risk reduction.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Ruhakana Rugunda met Nakalembe on Thursday and congratulated her on receiving the international recognition.
