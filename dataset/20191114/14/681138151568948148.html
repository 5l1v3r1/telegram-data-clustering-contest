      <p>The service, which offers free rides for people with limited mobility, is offering the same for deliveries of supplies.</p>
      <p>The Foodbank at Gatehouse, the Women's Refuge, Best Before Project and Bury Drop-In have already started using the rickshaw for deliveries.</p>
      <p>Last year the service stopped running between November and April.</p>
      <p>Trustee Libby Ranzetta said: "We are keen to provide the opportunity for people to go on the rickshaw this winter, especially on those gorgeous bright, frosty days when it's so good to be outside.</p>

      <p>"We are also trialling using the rickshaw in 'cargo mode' for local deliveries, which means the bike isn't standing idle when we have fewer passengers because of the weather."</p>
      <p>Ms Ranzetta said the service was also offering to collect any items people living in the town wanted to donate to local charity shops and who don't have a car or access to public transport.</p>
      <p>BSE Rickshaw started in June 2018, with funding from Bury St Edmunds Town and West Suffolk councillors to purchase a specially-adapted trishaw bike.</p>
      <p>It is run entirely by volunteers and rides are available free of charge, seven days a week, to local people with limited mobility or who are experiencing social isolation.</p>
      <p>Our Bury St Edmunds Business Improvement District has provided sponsorship for the winter season, with Jacobs Allen chartered accountants continuing their summer season's support by sponsoring the cargo trial.</p>
      <p>Mike Kirkham, of Our Bury St Edmunds said: "The Bury St Edmunds Rickshaw is a fabulous initiative helping people experience all the town centre has to offer.</p>
      <p>"As the local business improvement district we are pleased to work with and support the rickshaw team and the excellent service they provide."</p>
      <p>Bury St Edmunds Rickshaw trustees would be pleased to hear from cyclists interested in volunteering to ride the rickshaw as a cargo bike, and from local charitable organisations who need a hand with deliveries.</p>
