      <h1>Mum's anger after Sainsbury's sell her baby milk a month out of date</h1>
      <h2>The Kent mum refused the supermarket's compensation offer</h2>

      <p>A mum says her trust in Sainsbury's has been "shattered" after baby milk that was brought for her newborn son was a month out of date.</p>
      <p>Tina Butler, 28, discovered when she got home that the two bottles of Apatamil were past their sell-by date.</p>
      <p>Fearing his son Jayden could have been made extremely ill, Tina returned to the supermarket, in Chestfield, Kent, to confront staff about the slip-up.</p>
      <p>The mum-of-one, from Whitstable, said: “I went back to the supermarket with my dad to make them aware of the situation.</p>

      <p>“I told three women behind the customer service desk about it and they didn’t seem interested.</p>
      <p>“When I showed one of the ladies the bottle, she was reluctant to give it back.”</p>
      <p>The staff offered Miss Butler a refund on both of the bottles - which retail at £3.70 each - and a £10 gift card for her troubles, which she turned down.</p>
      <p>Unhappy with the offer she then phoned Sainsbury’s customer service to demand action to avoid a repeat of the episode.</p>
      <p>This time she was offered a £25 gift card, and then £50, but she refused both.</p>
      <p>She said: “It is neglect. You trust what you buy to be in date and to get home and realise that it’s a month out of date; it shatters your trust.</p>

      <p>“I just want parents to be aware Sainsbury’s are not checking their dates.</p>
      <p>“I am worried. I have read stories about babies being taken to hospital after eating out of date food and Jayden could have been quite ill.”</p>
      <p>Miss Butler is also unhappy with the way Sainsbury’s have dealt with the situation.</p>
      <p>She said: “They should have been more comforting of the situation, but they just wanted me to get out of the door."</p>
      <p>The Food Standards Agency says best-before dates are about quality, not safety, and it is not illegal to sell goods after the date has passed.</p>
      <p>But in Scotland one mum reported her toddler being violently sick for three days after drinking Aptamil from Tesco which was a month past its best-before date.</p>
      <p>A Sainsbury’s spokesperson said: “We have apologised to Tina for her experience and offered her a gesture of goodwill.</p>
      <p>"Stock has been checked to make sure this does not happen again.”</p>
