      <p>Out of all the food hybrids out there, we never thought we'd see the day al the key ingredients of a traditional British roast dinner were crammed into a Japanese gyoza.</p>
      <p>But now you can eat lots of little bite-sized roast dinners as you walk, as Itsu has created what's surely the world's first <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/christmas-dinner">Christmas dinner</a> gyoza.</p>
      <p>A festive feast packed into a soft steamed dumpling, each gyoza is filled with turkey, bacon, stuffing and even cranberry sauce, working out at just 302 calories each.</p>
      <p>As well as tasting unique, the dumplings are also bright red, thanks to a natural beetroot flavouring.</p>

      <p>Set to launch next Wednesday (20 November) in Itsu stores all across the UK, a portion of eight 'Christmas cracker' gyoza will set you back £4.29.</p>
      <p>If you are heading into an Itsu store, make sure to put on your biggest festive smile, as one special Christmas cracker is also being handed out to a customer each day.</p>
      <p>Inside the so-called its’mas crackers are a joke, sticker, Christmas hat and exclusive prize, which range from free Christmas cracker gyoza portions to an itsu pink card, which gives you a year's worth of half price itsu. Please Itsu, we've been really good this year...</p>
