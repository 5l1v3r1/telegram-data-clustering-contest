      <h1>'Simpsons' episode featuring Michael Jackson won't appear on Disney+</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T14:40:21+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 14:40</time> by <a rel="author">Joe Tacopino</a></address>
      <p>The new streaming platform Disney+ has one glaring exception from their catalog of ‘Simpsons’ episodes — a Michael Jackson cameo.</p>
      <p>The legendary cartoon’s 1991 season premiere — which featured the King of Pop’s voice — was not included on the platform that <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/12/disney-streaming-service-plagued-with-glitches-on-first-day/">launched earlier this week</a> with some glitches.</p>
      <p>In the episode, Jackson voices the character of Leon Kompowsky, a white man placed in a mental hospital because he believes he is the “Thriller” singer.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/simpsons-episode-featuring-michael-jackson-kept-disney-1254609">The Hollywood Reporter pointed out</a> that the showrunners removed the season 3 opener from its catalog earlier this year.</p>

          <b>DISNEY+ SLAPS CONTENT WARNING FOR 'OUTDATED CULTURAL DEPICTIONS' ON CLASSIC ANIMATED MOVIES</b>
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>The show’s executive producer Al Jean <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-simpsons-boss-al-jean-michael-jackson-used-the-show-to-groom-boys">told the Daily Beast in March</a> that he believes Jackson used his appearance in the episode to “groom” young boys.</p>
      <p>“I think it was part of what he used to groom boys,” Jean said.</p>
      <p>“It looks like the episode was used by Michael Jackson for something other than what we’d intended it. It wasn’t just a comedy to him, it was something that was used as a tool.</p>

      </p>
      <p>“That, to me, is my belief, and it’s why I think removing it is appropriate.”</p>
      <p>The move comes as Disney+ was <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/13/disney-catches-heat-for-streaming-movies-with-racist-content/">forced to warn subscribers</a> that they may encounter “outdated cultural depictions” while watching some of its older content.</p>
