      <p>HONG KONG (Reuters) - China President Xi Jinping said restoring order and stopping violence is the most urgent task right now for Hong Kong, China’s state television CCTV reported on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Xi said China continues to firmly support Hong Kong’s Chief Executive Carrie Lam to implement policies according to law and punish rioters, CCTV reported.</p>
      <p>China opposes any external forces to interfere with Hong Kong affairs, and its determination to implement the “one country, two systems” principle is unshakable, the report quoted Xi as saying.</p>
