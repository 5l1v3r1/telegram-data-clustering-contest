      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T14:17:18+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 14:17</time> by <a rel="author">David Meikle</a></address>
      <p>A thug who kicked his heavily pregnant partner down a flight of stairs during a nine-year campaign of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/domestic-violence">abuse</a> has been jailed for nearly three years.</p>
      <p>Ian Murphy, 38, subjected Steffanie Grady, 30, to a string of terrifying assaults at the home they shared.</p>
      <p>The couple met in 2008 and Murphy attacked Steffanie for the first time within months of the relationship starting.</p>
      <p>He accused her of showing off at the party, slapped her across the face and then grabbed her hair and dragged her to the living room where he repeatedly hit her on the head.</p>
      <p>When she was taken to hospital she discovered she was pregnant.</p>
      <p>Eight months later drunken Murphy launched another vicious assault on his partner despite her being six days from giving birth.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>He shouted and swore at her before booting her down the stairs of their home in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/viewpark">Viewpark</a>, Lanarkshire.</p>
      <p>Murphy subjected her to two further attacks in January 2015 and December 2017.</p>
      <p>Steffanie eventually confided in a colleague that she had been choked by Murphy and had been left bleeding profusely after being thrown against a bannister during a violent outburst when she returned from a work Christmas party.</p>
      <p>Police were called in and he was arrested.</p>
      <p>Murphy, of Viewpark, appeared at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hamilton">Hamilton</a> Sheriff <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/courts">Court</a> and admitted four charges of assaulting Miss Grady between January 2008 and December 2017.</p>
      <p>He has now been jailed for 34 months by Sheriff Thomas Millar.</p>
      <p>In a victim impact statement, Steffanie revealed she felt trapped by her controlling partner and that she was terrified to tell anyone about the abuse for fear of further violence.</p>
      <p>Describing the moment Murphy kicked Steffanie down the stairs, depute fiscal Jennifer Guy said: "The accused returned home drunk and began acting in an aggressive manner towards the complainer and was shouting and swearing.</p>
      <p>"He was told to go to his bed but kept following the complainer out of the bedroom and as she approached the top of the stairs he approached her from behind and kicked her on the bottom causing her to fall head first down the stairs.</p>
      <p>"The next thing she remembers is being at the bottom of the stairs with the accused shouting 'get up I didn't even touch you'.</p>
      <p>"After she noticed she was bleeding she went to Wishaw General Hospital and, in fear of repercussions from the accused, did not mention the assault and was told by staff the child was fine."</p>
      <p>Guy added: "In December 2017 the complainer was on a Christmas night out in Glasgow with work colleagues and returned to a friend's home to carry on the night.</p>
      <p>"The accused began phoning her to find out where she was and accused her of taking the p**s out of him.</p>
      <p>"In the house he began shouting and swearing and, as she went up the stairs, he grabbed her by the throat restricting her breathing.</p>
      <p>"He then released and grabbed her arms and began shaking her before he then deliberately pushed her causing her to fall striking her head off a wooden bannister and she began to bleed profusely from the back of her head."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Laura Kiernan, defending, said: "He has asked to apologise to the victim in open court for his behaviour.</p>
      <p>"He is ashamed of his behaviour and is not comfortable at all with the way he behaved."</p>
      <p>Sheriff Millar said: "This was a catalogue of offending from 2008 to 2017 and each charge on its own is serious and sufficient enough to merit a custodial sentence.</p>
      <p>"I have read the victim impact statement which says this has had a long lasting effect for her. There can be no alternative to custody."</p>
