      <p>Several roads are completely flooded, leaving it difficult for cars to get through safely.</p>
      <p>The yellow weather warning was removed for Suffolk in the past few days, but the downpour has still made an impact on residents hoping to travel.</p>
      <p>Aldeburgh saw several streets flooded, with both Friday Street and Aldringham Lane completely cut off by the excessive rainfall.</p>
      <p>Also Aldringham village itself was badly affected with the road outside the Parrot and Punch Bowl pub covered in water.</p>

      <p>Whilst flood warning signs have been put up in some locations, there are still cars attempting to drive through the waters.</p>
      <p>Suffolk County Council confirmed it was aware of at least one road in Aldringham and said it was a long-standing flood risk issue.</p>
      <p>Hadleigh Library was also victim to the floods when they came through the roof this morning.</p>
      <p>The library had to be closed when they suffered damage to the ceiling as water was coming through a leak in the roof.</p>

      <p>However, as it is not classed as a main road, the matter was not urgent.</p>
