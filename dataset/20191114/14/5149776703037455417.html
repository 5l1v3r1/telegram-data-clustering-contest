      <p>A man and woman have been jailed over the abduction of a child from a Nottingham house.</p>
      <p>The man climbed in through a window in the early hours after buying an imitation firearm the day before with his co-accused.</p>
      <p>The fake black metal handgun was pointed at a woman in the house who screamed as she saw the man in her bedroom.</p>
      <p>He jumped on top of her and held a hand over her mouth to stifled her screams.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/courts">Nottingham Crown Court</a> heard she was bound and gagged for around seven hours as the child was taken by the man to Heathrow Airport on a flight bound for Madrid.</p>

      <p>Nottinghamshire Police - facing a race against time once the abduction was reported - managed to work with Spanish authorities to rescue the child and arrest the man, with seconds to spare before their connecting flight to Algeria took off from Madrid.</p>
      <p>Bodyworn police footage, played in court, filmed the arrival of officers at the property and recorded the muffled screams of the bound-up victim.</p>
      <p>One officer asked the accomplice, who had stayed with the tied-up woman while the man took the child, "why is she still like this?" and "why haven't you undone her?"</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/crime">Judge </a>Stuart Rafferty QC, who sentenced them, said: "One can only recoil in horror at the agony that poor woman was in by the time police arrived and they asked you (the woman) why you had not released her? You made an excuse. You did that independently as well. That wholly innocent victim may well been scarred mentally for life by what you did to her".</p>
      <p>The man and woman both pleaded guilty to abduction, false imprisonment of a woman, making threats to kill and having an imitation firearm.</p>
      <p>The man, aged 45 and who cannot be identified, received a 15-year sentence and an extended licence period of three years.</p>
      <p>The woman, aged 43 and who also cannot be identified, was sentenced to seven years.</p>
