      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T14:06:41+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 14:06</time> by <a rel="author">Luke Matthews, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/luke-matthews/</a></address>
      <p>A mum has transformed the space under the stairs in her home into a brilliant sensory room for her son using bargain buys from Poundland and Amazon.</p>
      <p>Mum-of-two Ashleigh Dunkley cleared out the large cupboard under the stairs used to store junk and turned it into a haven for her three-year-old son CJ complete with LED lights, foam walls, a ball pit and cogs.</p>
      <p>Ashleigh saw the positive impact a weekly visit to a sensory room at CJ's developmental nursery was having and started thinking about her own space under the stairs.</p>
      <p>Over one weekend the mum set about creating a room designed to help her son develop his senses using light, music and touch, as reported by <a href="https://www.tyla.com/life/home-sensory-room-under-stairs-mother-son-diy-idea-transformation-20191111">Tyla</a> .</p>

      <p>She gathered items they already had in the home including a lava lamp, chair, cushions, magnetic numbers and a crocodile wall toy, many of which CJ and his brother Hadden, 7, had received as presents.</p>
      <p>She bought 30 foam mats for about £10, LED strip lights from Amazon for £13.99 and kid's lights from Poundland to put on the wall.</p>
      <p>The ball pit was created using unwanted balls donated from friends and family, with the other bits snapped up on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> Marketplace for £30.</p>

      <p>Overall, the transformation was completed for around £80.</p>
      <p>Ashleigh said the family had previously looked into buying a large sensory board but found out they cost thousands each and says the homemade alternative has been hugely beneficial for CJ.</p>
      <p>"My son loves it!" she said. "He gets so excited when it's all lit up.</p>
      <p>"It's also very beneficial for when everyday life just gets a bit too much for him. It really settles him. Almost like someones pressed a reset button.</p>
      <p>"He is a big sensory seeker so bright lights, white noise and a ball pit are right up his street."</p>
