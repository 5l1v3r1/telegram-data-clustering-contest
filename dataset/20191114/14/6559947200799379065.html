      <p>Black Friday 2019 might not officially start until November 29, but plenty of retailers run sale events that last a lot longer than 24 hours. For example, <a href="https://zdcs.link/Nppw3">Currys PC World's Black Friday</a> sale has already kicked off.</p>
      <p>To entice customers to shop now rather than wait until November 29, <a href="https://www.blackfriday.co.uk/pc-world-black-friday-ad-deals-sales">Currys PC World</a> is offering a Black Friday Price Guarantee - if the price of any product you purchase ends up being lower on Black Friday, they’ll refund you the difference.</p>
      <p>Currys are calling it the ‘Why Wait’ sale because, though more products will be discounted closer to Black Friday, if something catches your eye now, there’s no better time to buy it.</p>

      <h4>Price matching</h4>
      <p>The store’s Price Promise means you won’t find a cheaper deal elsewhere. If you find the product you’re after is being sold for less at another UK store, Currys will match the price - even on offer-code discounts. This price matching can be done before you purchase the product at Currys or up to 7 days after.</p>
      <h4>The best deals right now</h4>
      <p>Experienced bargain hunters know that some of the biggest Black Friday savings can be made on tech and appliances, making <a href="https://www.blackfriday.co.uk/pc-world-black-friday-ad-deals-sales">Currys PC World</a> a must-visit store during the sale period. These are the best deals in each category.</p>
