      <p>BANGKOK: A legal clerk who ended a bloody Thai courtroom shooting by grabbing a firearm and killing the gunman has been arrested and charged with murder, police said Thursday (Nov 14).</p>
      <p>Three people - two lawyers and the gunman - were shot dead at the Chanthaburi courthouse in eastern Thailand on Tuesday during a hearing over a drawn-out land dispute.</p>

      <p>Police say Thanakorn Theeravarodom, a young paralegal working with the lawyers, grabbed the gun from a guard and shot the assailant, a retired police major general who was one of the litigants in the case.</p>
      <p>The clerk was charged with "intentional killing", Khomsorn Mabumrung, commander of Chanthaburi provincial city police, told AFP.</p>
      <p>"He said it's self-defence."</p>
      <p>Authorities said this week that the two sides in the case had been in court for more than 10 years arguing over a large plot of land.</p>
      <p>Thailand has high rates of gun ownership and petty personal disputes and romantic and business rivalries are often resolved with firearms.</p>
      <p>But a series of courthouse shootings in Thailand have exposed flaws in the legal system's security.</p>
      <p>More than a week ago three drug suspects - including an American - shot and stabbed their way out of a court in the seaside town of Pattaya before being tracked down.</p>
      <p>Early last month a Thai judge in the insurgency-battered south shot himself in the chest in front of a packed court after acquitting several murder suspects and decrying the judicial system.</p>
