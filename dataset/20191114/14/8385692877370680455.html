      <p>The <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2019/11/motorola-razr-is-back-as-a-foldable-futuristic-smartphone.html">Motorola razr</a> is going to be exclusive to Verizon, and for some reason it won't support its 5G network.</p>
      <p>Actually, the reason is pretty understandable. With the razr being such a small and thin device, there wasn't much room for other bands (other than the three LTE bands that Verizon needs) for LTE. Let alone enough room for a 5G radio and 5G bands that would be needed to work on Verizon's 5G network.</p>
      <p>So while it might sound odd that a <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2019/11/you-can-buy-verizon-stream-tv-android-tv-box-no+netflix.html">Verizon</a> Exclusive smartphone doesn't work on Verizon's shiny new 5G network, it makes sense.</p>

      <h3>Not all Verizon-exclusive smartphones run on 5G anyways</h3>
      <p>Verizon has a number of other exclusive smartphones on its network that don't use 5G. So this isn't a big deal breaker. But when you're looking at a smartphone that costs $1499, many might expect it to have 5G.</p>
      <p>After all, the Galaxy S10+ 5G is the same price, and does sport 5G connectivity.</p>
      <p>Motorola's Moto Z4 and Moto Z3 also have 5G connectivity through the 5G Moto Mod. So it's not like Motorola hasn't done a 5G phone before. Well technically they haven't, just a Moto Mod.</p>

      <p>5G is still pretty early, so for Motorola to forego it on the razr is not a big surprise and it's probably for the better. After all, the razr already has plenty of first-generation tech inside.</p>
      <h3>All smartphones released in 2020 are expected to be 5G-ready</h3>
      <p>However, the Motorola razr isn't going to be released until January â€“ and that's if there are no delays. Every other foldable smartphone has faced a few delays. With Huawei's Mate X having the most delays so far.</p>
      <p>Qualcomm and other industry analysts are saying that all smartphones released in 2020 will be 5G-ready. At least when it comes to the flagship level smartphones. Some of the cheaper smartphones that are under $300, likely won't have 5G support.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>Not to mention that Verizon is spending millions on advertising their 5G network. And their headlining exclusive smartphone isn't going to work on that network. Seems like a golden opportunity was missed here.</p>
      <p>But it was likely for the better. As 5G is still very new and the battery consumption isn't great. The Motorola razr isn't going to have great battery life anyways, with a 2510mAh capacity battery and a 6.2-inch display.</p>
      <p>Just remember that if you are looking to purchase the Motorola razr, it's not going to work on Verizon 5G.</p>
