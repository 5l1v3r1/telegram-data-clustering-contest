      <p>Asda said Brexit uncertainty is negatively affecting consumer spending as the supermarket giant reported a dip in sales in the third quarter.</p>
      <p>Like-for-like sales, excluding petrol, fell 0.5 per cent in the third quarter as Brexit and the upcoming general election ramped up the levels of uncertainty. </p>

      <p>The grocer said its gross profit rate fell due to price reductions in its clothing division following a softer summer season compared to last year. </p>
      <p>The fall in gross profit rate, along with increased operating expenses, meant operating income was also lower.</p>
      <p>Asda chief executive Roger Burnley said: “This quarter has afforded consumers little respite from political or economic uncertainty and this has shown in their spending.”</p>
      <p>Doug McMillon, chief executive of Asda’s parent company Walmart, which also reported quarterly earnings today, said: “In the UK, concerns over Brexit continue to negatively affect customer spending patterns.” </p>
      <p>Walmart reported that revenue increased 2.5 per cent to $138m, while operating income sank 5.4 per cent due to a non-cash impairment change for Walmart International. </p>
      <p>Online sales in the US soared 41 per cent as the supermarket – which is the world’s largest retailer – targeted strong growth in its ecommerce business and Walmart raised its annual earnings outlook. </p>
      <p>McMillon said: “We’re pleased with our performance for the quarter. Our associates are responding to change in an inspiring way, and we’re proud of them. </p>
      <p>“The Walmart US business saw strong comp sales and expense leverage, and operating income grew for the sixth consecutive quarter.”</p>
