      <h1>Apple Debuts New Research App, Launches Health Studies for Women’s Health, Hearing, and Heart and Movement</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T14:12:42+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 14:12</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.macstories.net/author/ryanchristoffel/" target="_blank">Ryan Christoffel</a></address>
      <p>Today <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/11/apple-launches-three-innovative-studies-today-in-the-new-research-app/">Apple announced</a> the next phase of its efforts in medical research studies. Following the Heart Study which <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/apple-launches-heart-study-app-in-the-us-in-partnership-with-stanford-medicine/">debuted in late 2017</a> and shared its first results <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/stanford-medicine-presents-results-of-the-apple-heart-study/">earlier this year</a>, Apple now has three new studies it’s launching at once, which users can sign up for through a brand new <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apple-research/id1463884356">Apple Research app</a>.</p>
      <blockquote>“Today marks an important moment as we embark on research initiatives that may offer incredible learnings in areas long sought after by the medical community,” said Jeff Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer. “Participants on the Research app have the opportunity to make a tremendous impact that could lead to new discoveries and help millions lead healthier lives.”</blockquote>
      <p>Users can enroll in one or more of the new studies: the Women’s Health Study, Heart and Movement Study, and Hearing Study. Each of these uses an iPhone and Apple Watch to collect certain data for the purpose of aiding medical advancements.</p>
      <p>Anything health-related can come with plenty of privacy concerns, so the Research app’s on-boarding flow includes a very clear privacy commitment, stated in four points:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Your data will not be sold.</li>
        <li>You decide which studies you join, and you can leave the study at any time.</li>
        <li>You control which types of data you share, and you can stop sharing your data at anytime.</li>
        <li>Studies must tell you how your data supports their research.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Tim Cook on multiple occasions has sought to emphasize how important the issue of health is to Apple. Far from a mere hobby, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/08/tim-cook-teases-new-apple-services-tied-to-health-care.html">he’s said</a> he believes health will end up being Apple’s most significant area of contribution to mankind. Studies like these are one way to help push the needle on that goal.</p>
