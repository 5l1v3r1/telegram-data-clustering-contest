      <p>Amazon has the ECOVACS DEEBOT 601 <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/best-cell-phone-deals">on sale</a> with the Echo Dot for just $217.94.</p>
      <p>Now the DEEBOT 601 would normally be priced at $256.40, so you're not only saving $40, but also getting a free Echo Dot with this deal. Now that's a deal that can't be beat.</p>
      <p>The DEEBOT 601 is one of ECOVACS newer robot vacuums. It does a really great job at cleaning your home, without you needing to go back and go over it again with the "real" vacuum.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>It has two side brushes as well as a main brush in the center that will suck up all of the dirt. And when talking about suction, the DEEBOT 601 is really good at that as well. It won't leave any dirt behind. And it's actually a really good option for those that have pets.</p>
      <p>DEEBOT 601 does not use lasers to navigate around your home, but it is able to go back and forth and clean your entire home without missing any spots. And that's definitely a good thing. And better than the other robot vacuums in this price range that will simply clean in a random direction, until it is out of juice.</p>
      <p>Speaking of juice, the DEEBOT 601 will run for around 120 minutes (that's two hours), then it will return to its dock to recharge. And if it didn't finish cleaning it will resume once it is fully charged.</p>

      <p>There is also support for Amazon Alexa here, hence the Echo Dot being bundled in. This means that you can ask Alexa to start cleaning your floors. And that's a pretty cool thing to do. There is also support for Google Assistant, if you'd rather use a Google Home or Nest Mini for this.</p>
      <p>You can pick up this bundle of the ECOVACS DEEBOT 601 and Echo Dot on sale at Amazon <a href="https://geni.us/6aaSwvz">by clicking here.</a></p>
