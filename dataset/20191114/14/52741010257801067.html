      <p>OTTAWA — The Supreme Court of Canada has declined to hear arguments from a pro-gun lobby group aimed at scrapping Quebec's firearms registry.</p>
      <p>After Quebec passed legislation in 2016 to establish the provincial registry, the National Firearms Association argued in court that the initiative strayed into federal constitutional jurisdiction.  </p>
      <p>In 2017, the Quebec Superior Court ruled the registry was constitutional, given the legitimate provincial role in ensuring public safety.</p>
      <p>The court said the registry was intended to make police work safer and the implementation of court orders more effective.</p>
      <p>The Quebec Court of Appeal upheld the decision earlier this year, prompting the association to head to the Supreme Court.</p>
      <p>The province began setting up its own registry after Stephen Harper's Conservatives abolished the federal database of hunting rifles and shotguns in 2012.</p>
      <p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published Nov. 14, 2019.</p>
