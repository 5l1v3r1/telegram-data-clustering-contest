      <p>Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition is available now on Windows 10, Xbox Game Pass for PC and Ultimate, and Steam. The announcement came Thursday at X019 in London, where the Xbox team also revealed a first look at Age’s next chapter, Age of Empires IV.</p>
      <p>Both releases are from World’s Edge, a dedicated studio for Age of Empires that’s led by Shannon Loftis and is now a part of the Xbox Games Studios family.</p>
      <p>“We know that our community has been eager to learn more about Age of Empires IV since we announced it at gamescom in 2017,” says Adam Isgreen, creative director for the Age of Empires franchise in a post on Xbox Wire. “We’ve been hard at work on the game and we’re excited to share some of it with the world today.”</p>
      <p>Regarding the game released on Thursday, Isgreen notes it truly is the definitive version, bringing back everything that made the original game so special and wrapping it in a modern package.</p>
      <p>“We’ve listened to the community to learn what they loved most about the game and where we could improve the experience, and have also added brand new content in the form of The Last Khans to delight both existing and new players,” Isgreen says.</p>
