      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/eintracht-frankfurt">Eintracht Frankfurt</a> have lost their appeal against a ban on fans attending the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/UEFAEuropaLeague">Europa League</a> tie at <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Arsenal">Arsenal</a>.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a> club had been charged by governing body <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/UEFA">Uefa</a> following incidents during the Group F fixture against Vitoria in Portugal.</p>
      <p>The disciplinary action was for throwing of objects, crowd disturbances, act of damages and a late kick-off.</p>
      <p>Frankfurt had already been under a suspended sanction from previous breaches, and so Uefa imposed the ban on sale of tickets for the match in London on November 28 as well as one additional European fixture.</p>
      <p>The Germans lodged an appeal against the ruling, but it was unsuccessful.</p>
      <p>“The appeal of Eintracht Frankfurt against the judgement of the Uefa Control, Ethics and Disciplinary Commission of 17 October 2019 was rejected by the competent chamber last night,” a club statement read.</p>
      <p>“As a result, the ‘cut-off penalty’ for the game at Arsenal FC on 28 November in London continues.”</p>
