      <h1>Rob Vanstone: Saskatchewan Roughriders need a return to the days of "LegendDarian" playoff quarterbacking</h1>
      <h2>In the post-Darian Durant era, the Saskatchewan Roughriders' quarterbacks have typically struggled in the playoffs.</h2>

      <p>On the surface, it is as simple as one, three, two.</p>
      <p>The Saskatchewan Roughriders will require top-flight quarterbacking if they are to defeat the visiting Winnipeg Blue Bombers in<a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/rob-vanstone-winnipeg-blue-bombers-are-still-the-best-matchup-for-the-saskatchewan-roughriders"> Sunday’s CFL West Division final.</a></p>

      <p>If you have somehow navigated and survived the earlier paragraphs, please brace yourself for a deeper immersion into where the Roughriders’ post-season quarterbacking has been, and where it needs to be.</p>
      <p>In three of Saskatchewan’s past four playoff games, the quarterbacking has been a liability.</p>
      <p>The bar had been set somewhere in the stratosphere over the previous four-game bloc — the brilliance of <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/%3Cwcm_content_element%3E%7B%22provider_name%22:%22YouTube%22,%22provider_url%22:%22https:%5C/%5C/www.youtube.com%5C/%22,%22object_url%22:%22https:%5C/%5C/www.youtube.com%5C/watch?v=MvLgIvmfixQ%22,%22html%22:%22%3Ciframe%20width=%5C%22640%5C%22%20height=%5C%22360%5C%22%20src=%5C%22https:%5C/%5C/www.youtube.com%5C/embed%5C/MvLgIvmfixQ?feature=oembed%5C%22%20frameborder=%5C%220%5C%22%20allow=%5C%22accelerometer;%20autoplay;%20encrypted-media;%20gyroscope;%20picture-in-picture%5C%22%20allowfullscreen%3E%3C%5C/iframe%3E%22,%22type%22:%22oembed%22,%22channels%22:%5B%22desktop%22,%22tablet%22,%22phone%22%5D%7D%3C/wcm_content_element%3E%E2%80%9D%20target=%E2%80%9D_blank%E2%80%9D%20rel=%E2%80%9Dnoopener%E2%80%9D%3EDarian%20Durant%3C/a%3E%20in%202012%20and%202013.%3C/p%3E%3Cp%3E%3Cstrong%3E2012%20West%20semi-final:%3C/strong%3E%20Durant%20threw%20for%20435%20yards%20and%20four%20touchdowns,%20including%20a%20payoff%20pitch%20to%20Greg%20Carr%20that%20helped%20Saskatchewan%20assume%20a%2030-29%20lead%20over%20the%20Calgary%20Stampeders%20in%20the%20final%20minute%20of%20the%20fourth%20quarter.%20Calgary%20quickly%20countered,%20though,%20with%20a%2068-yard,%20game-winning%20TD%20bomb%20from%20Drew%20Tate%20to%20Romby%20Bryant.%20Stampeders%2036,%20Roughriders%2030.%3C/p%3E%3Cp%3E%3Cstrong%3E2013%20West%20semi-final:%20%3C/strong%3EIn%20a%20performance%20that%20one%20Twitter%20commentator%20ingeniously%20labelled%20as%20%E2%80%9CLegenDarian,%E2%80%9D%20Durant%20completed%2019%20of%2023%20passes%20for%20270%20yards%20and%20two%20TDs%20while%20helping%20Saskatchewan%20rally%20from%20a%20nine-point%20fourth-quarter%20deficit%20against%20the%20B.C.%20Lions%20on%20Taylor%20Field.%20Most%20memorably,%20Durant%20ran%20six%20times%20for%2097%20yards%20while%20using%20his%20feet%20to%20take%20the%20game%20into%20his%20own%20hands,%20if%20that%20makes%20any%20sense%20whatsoever.%20The%20Roughriders%20won,%2029-25.%3C/p%3E%3Cp%3E%3Cstrong%3E2013%20West%20final:%3C/strong%3E%20Durant%20was%2024-for-30%20for%20280%20yards,%20with%20three%20TDs,%20in%20a%2035-13%20victory%20over%20the%2014-4%20Stampeders%20at%20McMahon%20Stadium.%20Saskatchewan%20had%20finished%20at%2011-7.%3C/p%3E%3Cp%3E%3Ca%20href="><b>2013 Grey Cup:</b> In the final championship game played at Taylor Field, Durant was 17-for-24 for 245 yards, with three more TD passes, in a 45-23 victory over the Hamilton Tiger-Cats.</a></p>
      <p>Over those four games, Durant was a staggering 84-for-114 — a 73.7-per-cent accuracy rate — for 1,230 yards, with 12 touchdowns and two interceptions (both in 2012). He also rushed 19 times for 166 yards.</p>

      <p>Now, about the Roughriders’ following four post-season games …</p>
      <p><b>2014 West semi-final:</b> With Durant sidelined for the season with a torn tendon in his right elbow, 41-year-old <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/plaza-of-honour-induction-caps-kerry-josephs-career-with-saskatchewan-roughriders">Kerry Joseph</a> started at quarterback against the host Edmonton Eskimos. Joseph was 7-for-17 for 120 yards, with one touchdown and five interceptions. Tino Sunseri was 7-for-15 for 100 yards in relief. Edmonton won 18-10.</p>
      <p><b>2017 East Division semi-final:</b> The Roughriders, a cross-over team, defeated the Ottawa Redblacks 31-20 at TD Place. Kevin Glenn went the distance behind centre for Saskatchewan, going 18-for-28 for 252 yards, with one touchdown and nary an interception. Saskatchewan’s biggest weapon was <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/saskatchewan-roughriders-speedster-marcus-thigpen-isnt-slowing-down">tailback Marcus Thigpen</a>, who rushed 15 times for 169 yards — including a 75-yard TD. Brandon Bridge and short-yardage specialist Vernon Adams Jr. also made cameo appearances at quarterback for Saskatchewan.</p>
      <p><b>2017 East final:</b> Then-Saskatchewan head coach Chris Jones made three quarterbacking switches, going from Glenn to Bridge to Glenn to Bridge, in a 25-21 loss to the host Toronto Argonauts. Glenn was intercepted three times en route to posting a quarterback-efficiency rating of 0.0. Bridge was 11-for-21 for 141 yards, with one TD, and also rushed twice for 43 yards. He performed decently, but Argos pivot Ricky Ray won the day. Mind you, the winning touchdown was scored by Argonauts short-yardage pivot <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/rob-vanstone-quarterback-carousel-turned-out-swell-for-saskatchewan-roughriders-and-winnipeg-blue-bombers">Cody Fajardo</a> with 23 seconds left in the fourth quarter.</p>
      <p><b>2018 West semi-final:</b> Starting against Winnipeg in place of a concussed Zach Collaros, Bridge was 12-for-22 for 100 yards, without a TD and with a quacker of an interception. Saskatchewan slotback Naaman Roosevelt was open for what should have been two touchdown passes, but Bridge misfired both times. Bridge did lead Saskatchewan in rushing, with 86 yards on five carries.</p>
      <p>So let’s summarize, with the invaluable assistance of Steve Daniel — the CFL’s incomparable, indispensable director of game information and statistics …</p>
      <p>Over the first four playoff games that were so expertly rehashed here, Durant’s quarterback-efficiency rating was an eye-popping 136.2.</p>
      <p>The (d)efficiency rating for the past four games: 50.5. (And that factors in Glenn’s 105.1 performance from the 2017 game in Ottawa.)</p>
      <p>Saskatchewan won three of the first four games, and led the 2012 contest in the final minute thanks to Durant’s fourth TD pass.</p>
      <p>The Roughriders lost three of the next four playoff contests, with the running attack providing plenty of propulsion in the one victory.</p>
      <p>In the heartbreaking loss to Toronto, a 79-yard punt-return touchdown by Christion Jones put the Roughriders ahead late in the fourth quarter. The offence, on the whole, was unexceptional.</p>
      <p>Continued mediocrity, or worse, isn’t likely to suffice Sunday against a sturdy Winnipeg defence.</p>
      <p>It doesn’t matter whether Fajardo, <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/saskatchewan-roughriders-ride-rookie-passer-isaac-harker-to-victory">Isaac Harker</a> or <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/saskatchewan-roughriders-backup-quarterback-bryan-bennett-making-a-name-for-himself-on-special-teams">Bryan Bennett</a> is calling signals for the Roughriders. They simply require significantly better quarterbacking than they have typically received in the playoffs in the post-Durant era.</p>
      <p>Rider Nation should be reassured by the notion that there isn’t anywhere to go but up.</p>
