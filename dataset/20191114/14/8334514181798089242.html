      <p>(Reuters) - There is about a 70% chance that neutral weather conditions will prevail in the Northern Hemisphere this winter, a U.S. government weather forecaster said on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The El Niño-Southern Oscillation-neutral (ENSO) weather pattern is marked by average long-term ocean temperatures, tropical rainfall and atmospheric winds.</p>
      <p>The chances of the weather pattern continuing through spring 2020 is at 60% to 65%, the National Weather Service’s Climate Prediction Center (CPC) said in its monthly forecast.</p>
      <p>ENSO-neutral conditions refer to those periods in which neither El Niño nor La Niña are present, often coinciding with the transition between the two weather patterns, according to the CPC.</p>
      <p>“Forecasters believe this recent warmth reflects sub-seasonal variability and is not indicative of an evolution toward El Niño. (However,) the chances for El Niño are predicted to be near 25% during the winter and spring,” CPC said.</p>
      <p>El Niño emerged in 2018 for the first time since 2016, and persisted until August 2019. The weather pattern has been linked to crop damage, fires and flash floods.</p>
      <p>It is a climate phenomenon linked to a periodic warming in sea-surface temperatures across the central and east-central equatorial Pacific and is the opposite of La Niña, characterized by unusually cold temperatures in the region, according to CPC website.</p>
