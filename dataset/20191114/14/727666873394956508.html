      <p>Auntie Viv offers a warning to the younger filmmaker.</p>
      <p><b>(AllHipHop News)</b> <i>Insecure</i> creator<a href="https://allhiphop.com/news/issa-rae-to-develop-new-version-of-set-it-off-movie-9f0cU-1xFkuDJnZeOu7R6Q/"> Issa Rae is reportedly in the process of developing a <i>S</i><i>et It Off </i>remake</a>. Director F. Gary Gray's original 1996 version starred Jada Pinkett, Queen Latifah, Kimberly Elise, and Vivica A. Fox.</p>
      <p>While promoting her upcoming <i>Christmas Matchmakers</i> television movie on ET Live, Fox was asked for her thoughts on a new <i>S</i><i>et It Off</i>. The <i>Empire</i> actress is not on board for a 2020s version of the heist film.</p>
      <p>"It's a classic, leave it alone," said Fox. "There's absolutely no reason to try to redo it. It's been done, and we did it so well that people are absolutely going to compare it to that."</p>
      <p>She continued, "I think that's [Rae] taking on a tremendous chore because that film has become a cult classic. Some things are just better left... like create your own new franchise. If you want to do a new film of girls robbing banks, create your own thing."</p>
      <p>In an interview with E! News, Vivica A. Fox also made it clear she had no interest in being part of Je’Caryous Johnson's <i>Set It Off </i>play. The cast of the 2018 on-stage adaptation featured Da Brat, LeToya Luckett, Kyla Pratt, and Demetria McKinney.</p>
