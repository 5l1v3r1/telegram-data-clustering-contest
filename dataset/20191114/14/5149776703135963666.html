      <h2>Page Kirk discusses the value of meeting and conversing with your accountant in person</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T14:29:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 14:29</time> by <a rel="author">Leena Sidat</a></address>
      <p>Nowadays, most people prefer not to physically interact with customer services. Bank branches are closing, with people choosing to bank online. High street footfall continues to decline year on year, leading to the mass closure of Thomas Cook, Debenhams &amp; House of Fraser stores.</p>
      <p>Technology has made it simple to avoid human contact. Why would you go the supermarket when you can sit at home and order groceries online? But distance weakens relationships. Do you really want this to happen with your accountant?</p>
      <p>Here, Tom Johnson of chartered accountants Page Kirk, writes about how it's all too easy, in a world of technology, to avoid meeting people in person.</p>

      <h3>Valuing interaction</h3>
      <p>Meeting face to face is difficult, with time at a premium for both clients and their accountants. And in the current climate, with the rise of cloud accounting, client meetings are often seen as unnecessary. I believe there are many reasons why it is still important to maintain face to face relationships in the digital age.</p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Strengthen relationships <br/></b>When you meet someone, first impressions form instantly. Gradually, you learn about each other and your respective situations. You may identify shared interests. This will hopefully develop professional relationships that last for years, as you get to know and trust each other on a personal level.</li>
        <li><b>Encourage honesty</b> <br/>We want to protect clients' interests. When you sit down in front of your accountant, you can look them straight in the eyes and talk about the challenges you are facing. In the long term, this will be best for your business.</li>
        <li><b>Meet the family</b><br/>Client continuity is key. The more people in your business that can have a relationship with your accountant the better. This could solve problems quicker when time pressure is a factor.</li>
        <li><b>Achieve quality communication <br/></b>With a phone call, meaningful discussions can be difficult as either party can have other distractions. You can wait days for an email response that may be misunderstood anyway. With a client meeting, we have booked out a period of our day to solely focus on you.</li>
        <li><b>Understand businesses at a deeper level <br/></b>A face to face conversation can lead to opportunities that you might have never considered. When we are given time to concentrate on your business, discussions can range from simple tax-saving measures to developing your long-term strategy, that otherwise wouldnâ€™t get covered.</li>
        <li><b>Make it personal</b> <br/>Meetings can happen at any location, including your offices, our offices, or a neutral location such as a restaurant. The most productive conversations take place when you feel comfortable.</li>
        <li><b>Get impartial advice</b> <br/>Face to face meetings are always best when you are considering your future options. Whether you are looking to sell or expand, we will offer impartial advice as we always want to help you maximise your potential and achieve your goals.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Many people think it would be ideal to conduct business without ever interacting with clients. But let me ask you this, would someone send their future spouse a well written e-mail? Would they propose by text?</p>
      <p>You would meet face to face and look them in the eyes, as the important things in life are usually done in person.</p>
