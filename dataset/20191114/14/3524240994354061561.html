      <p>The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency, Command in Oyo State, on Thursday destroyed over 40 hectares of hemp plantation in Abatade in Oluyole Local Government Area of the state.</p>
      <p>Addressing newsmen during the exercise, the state NDLEA Commander, Mr Ralph Igwenagu, said the command had previously destroyed six hectares of plantation in Ibarapa LGA of the state.</p>
      <p>Igwenagu said the discovery of the plantation was an indication that a good number of farmers in the state engaged in the cultivation of hemp.</p>
      <p>The commander said five suspects have been arrested in connection with the plantation while the investigation was on to arrest others.</p>
      <p>Igwenagu said the agency was not only determined to destroy hemp plantations but to also reduce its trafficking and abuse to the barest minimum in the state.</p>
      <p>He called on community leaders not to give their land for cultivation of illicit substances.</p>
      <p>“The owners of the plantation are not from the village but they got the land from the village head.</p>
      <p>“If the villagers refused to give them the land, the people will not get land to cultivate again and eventually they will leave the illegal business,” he said.</p>
      <p>He urged members of the community to always report to the agency anytime they noticed farmlands being used for hemp cultivation.</p>
      <p>Mr Mutiat Okuwobi, the state’s Public Relations’ Officer of the agency, said the command would continue to monitor farmland to prevent the cultivation of hemp.</p>
