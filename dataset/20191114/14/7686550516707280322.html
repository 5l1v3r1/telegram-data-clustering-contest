      <h1>Scientists discover the 'secret' to living beyond 100</h1>
      <h2>There are currently 820 people in the UK aged 105 and over and this number is only expected to keep rising</h2>

      <p>Scientists have discovered the secret to living beyond 100 after analysing the immune cells of super-centenarians. <br/><br/>A study found that super-centenarians – those who have reached the age of 110 – have an abnormal amount of immune cells that could be responsible for their longevity.</p>
      <p>If a medication or treatment can be formulated based on this breakthrough, more people could reach the significant age milestone in the future.</p>
      <p>Lead author of the study, Dr Kosuke Hashimoto, said: "If we can find the link between the immune system and aging and longevity, we may be able to contribute to prolonging healthy life expectancies."</p>
      <h3>The first study of its kind</h3>
      <p>Our risk of developing diseases, cancers and other life-threatening illnesses increases as we age, as the composition of T-cells in our immune system changes.</p>
      <p>These special cells kill bugs and foreign bodies, report the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/science/secret-living-beyond-100-uncovered-20873784">Mirror</a> , and are found in abundance in super-centenarians who have reached 110.</p>
      <p>Super-centenarians were found to have more of these cells than 50-80-year-olds, meaning their body is better prepared to fight off bugs and foreign bodies.</p>
      <p>Even after they turn 100, these people don't require any assistance and are described as the “elite of health and longevity".</p>

      <p>Dr Hashimoto said: "The findings suggest how the immune system of super-centenarians might protect against viral infections and tumour development to confer exceptional longevity.</p>
      <p>"It sheds light on why super-centenarians generally tend to spend most of their lives in good health".</p>
      <p>The study found one particular type of T-cell, called CD4+, was four-five times as abundant in the super-centenarians in comparison to the younger participants. <br/><br/>It's not yet know how or why this particular cell might extend our lives, but getting to the bottom of it could lead to a 'fountain of youth' pill.</p>
      <p>Due to scientific and technological advances, scientists claim there's no limit to how long people will live in the future .</p>
      <p>In fact, after analysing the longest-living individuals in the USA, the UK, France and Japan for each year since 1968, they've found no evidence for an age limit – if it exists, it hasn't yet been reached.</p>
      <p>However, this isn't going to happen overnight and there is still more research to be done before a 'fountain of youth pill' can be made.</p>
      <p>Dr Hashimoto said: "Their (super-centenarians) immunological condition has been largely unexplored. We profiled thousands of circulating immune cells from super-centenarians.</p>
      <p>"They are a great model of healthy ageing. Their characteristics of delayed onset of age-related diseases and compression of morbidity imply that their immune system remains functional.</p>
      <p>"Our study reveals super-centenarians have unique characteristics in their circulating immune cells, which may represent an essential adaptation to achieve exceptional longevity by sustaining immune responses to infections and diseases".</p>
