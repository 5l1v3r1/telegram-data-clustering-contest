      </h3>
      <p>If you have seen any political content on social media that does not clearly state who has paid for it we want you to let us know.</p>
      <p>Political adverts on Facebook should state clearly who has paid for them in their posts. However, commercial adverts do not say who who is paying for them, but show only that they are sponsored.</p>
      <p>Which platform did you see it on? Which political party was it for? If it did not have a disclosure on it what was the reason the platform gave for showing you the advert?</p>
      <p>Though adverts will be banned from Twitter on 22 November, we would be interested to know if you see any posted after this date.</p>

      <p>Traditionally a unionist seat, Belfast East is facing deep political uncertainty. It’s held by the DUP which supports Brexit but is not happy with Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal in case it weakens Northern Ireland’s position in the UK.</p>
      <p>Several pro-remain parties such as Sinn Fein, the SDLP and the Greens have stepped aside in the constituency to give Naomi Long, leader of the centrist Alliance party, a chance at winning the seat. So this election will also be a test of whether the Alliance can rally enough voters who have previously voted along unionist or nationalist lines. <a href="https://guardiannewsandmedia.formstack.com/forms/people_and_power_belfast_east">Let us know what issues will decide your vote here.</a></p>

      <p>Are you a young voter in Canterbury? The Guardian is reporting on the battle in one of the most interesting constituencies in the country, which showed the unexpected strength of Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party in the 2017 election.</p>
      <p>Two years later, we’re keen to hear from voters in the city about their views on the election. We’re particularly interested in hearing from young people and students who were crucial in helping Labour win the historically Tory seat in 2017.
