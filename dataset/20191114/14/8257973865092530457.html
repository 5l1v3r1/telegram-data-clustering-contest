      <p>Nov. 14 (UPI) -- Rookie Ja Morant continues to make an impact on the NBA, most recently lifting the <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Memphis-Grizzlies/?tps=1">Memphis Grizzlies</a> to a victory by netting a game-winning shot between three <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Charlotte-Hornets/?tps=1">Charlotte Hornets</a> defenders.</p>
      <p>Morant's latest heroic act came in the final seconds of the Grizzlies' 119-117 triumph Wednesday at Spectrum Center in Charlotte, N.C.</p>
      <p>"Coach called my number," <a href="https://twitter.com/GrizzliesOnFSSE/status/1194802824195915776">Morant told Fox Sports</a> in his postgame interview. "He told me to attack. When I come off, wait, and then just attack the rack and make a play. I got by the defender and saw a clear lane.</p>
      <p>"I just took it."</p>
      <p>The Grizzlies and Hornets were tied at 117-117 with about five seconds remaining when Morant dribbled up on Hornets defender Cody Martin. The No. 2 overall pick in the 2019 NBA Draft did a crossover dribble before putting the ball in his left hand. Morant then did an inside-out dribble move, getting Martin off balance, before sprinting into the paint.</p>
      <p>Hornets forward Miles Bridges and 7-foot center <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Cody-Zeller/?tps=1">Cody Zeller</a> converged on Morant as he neared the rim. Morant tossed a shot off of the back of the rim, despite being surrounded by the trio of defenders. The ball bounced several times before falling through the net.</p>
      <p>The shot fell with less than a second remaining on the clock.</p>

      <p>Morant led the Grizzlies with 23 points and 11 assists. Terry Rozier scored a game-high 33 points for the Hornets. Jonas Valanciunas chipped in 18 points and 13 rebounds for the Grizzlies.</p>
      <p>The Grizzlies host the <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Utah-Jazz/?tps=1">Utah Jazz</a> at 8 p.m. EST Friday at FedExForum in Memphis. The Hornets host the <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Detroit-Pistons/?tps=1">Detroit Pistons</a> at 7 p.m. Friday at Spectrum Center.</p>
