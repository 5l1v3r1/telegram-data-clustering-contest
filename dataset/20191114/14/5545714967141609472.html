      <p>Not to totally knock <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../ninja-theory-discuss-character-individuality-in-new-bleeding-edge-gameplay-video-557338.phtml"><i>Bleeding Edge</i></a>, but I'm glad Ninja Theory has multiple projects in the pipeline and the financial security that comes with being owned by Microsoft. Maybe it'll reach a big-enough audience with Xbox Game Pass to find moderate success. That feels like a best-case scenario.</p>

      <p>At Microsoft's X019 event today, Ninja Theory brought out a trailer for <i>Bleeding Edge</i> and its release date: March 24, 2020. That's a rough time for any game to stand out, much less a hopeful new multiplayer IP. Folks who pre-order the Xbox One and PC title can check out a closed beta on February 14, well before <i>Final Fantasy VII Remake </i>and <i>Animal Crossing </i>and <i>Doom Eternal</i> consume us.</p>
      <p>Godspeed, <i>Bleeding Edge</i>. I like your outlandish character designs and I wish you the best.</p>
