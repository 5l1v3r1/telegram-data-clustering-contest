      <h1>Euro 2020 qualifiers: Who will reach next summer’s tournament? England, France, Germany’s chances rated</h1>
      <h2>Who can still qualify for the tournament and who is hoping for a play-off place?</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T14:43:25+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 14:43</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Critchley</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/euro-2020-qualifying">Euro 2020 qualifying</a> process comes to an end shortly, with 20 of the 24 places at next summer’s tournament to be finalised.</p>
      <p>Six teams – Belgium, Italy, Poland, Russia, Spain and Ukraine – have already qualified for the finals with a host of other national sides ready to join them.</p>
      <p>England are likely to secure qualification on Thursday night, though Wales, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland’s fates will be decided over the coming days.</p>
      <p>Scotland cannot qualify automatically after a poor campaign but will be one of 16 nations competing in the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Euro_2020">Euro 2020</a> play-offs next March.</p>
      <p>Those who miss out on a top-two finish but performed well in last season’s Nations League will be given a second chance to qualify, with four progressing to the finals.</p>
      <h3>Group A</h3>
      <p><b>England </b>will qualify with a point against Montenegro. A defeat will even be enough if Czech Republic v Kosovo does not end in a draw.</p>
      <p><b>Czech Republic </b>will qualify for the finals if they beat Kosovo. </p>
      <p><b>Kosovo </b>are assured of at least a play-off place. If they beat the Czech Republic, they will only need a point against England on Sunday to qualify automatically.</p>
      <p><b>Bulgaria </b>can still qualify through the play-offs and sit inside the play-off places as it stands. <b>Montenegro </b>have been eliminated.</p>
      <h3>Group B</h3>
      <p><b>Ukraine </b>have already qualified as group winners.</p>
      <p><b>Portugal </b>will qualify if they beat Lithuania and Luxembourg in their next two games. A win against Lithuania alone will be enough if Serbia do not beat Luxembourg.</p>
      <p><b>Serbia </b>are assured of at least a playoff place. They will most likely have to beat both Luxembourg and Ukraine and hope Portugal drop points to qualify automatically.</p>
      <p><b>Luxembourg </b>can still progress to the finals through the play-offs but currently sit outside the qualification places. <b>Lithuania </b>have been eliminated. </p>

      <h3>Group C</h3>
      <p><b>Netherlands </b>will qualify automatically by avoiding defeat to Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p><b>Germany </b>will qualify automatically if they beat Belarus and Northern Ireland fail to win. A draw against Belarus will be enough if Northern Ireland lose.</p>
      <p><b>Northern Ireland</b> realistically need to beat both the Netherlands and Germany and hope that one of their two opponents slips up in another qualifier.</p>
      <p>Michael O’Neill’s side are therefore likely to need a play-off in order to reach the finals.</p>
      <p><b>Belarus</b> cannot qualify automatically but will take part in the play-offs. <b>Estonia</b> have been eliminated.</p>
      <h3>Group D</h3>
      <p><b>Republic of Ireland </b>will qualify automatically if they beat Denmark on Monday, unless Switzerland draw one of their two remaining games.</p>
      <p><b>Denmark </b>are assured of at least a play-off place. If they avoid defeat to Gibraltar, they will only need a point against Ireland to qualify automatically.</p>
      <p><b>Switzerland </b>are also assured of at least a play-off place. Four points from their final two games against Georgia and Gibraltar will be enough to qualify.</p>
      <p>A potential three-way tie on 15 points at the top of the group would be decided on goal difference, meaning Ireland would need a two-goal win over Denmark to qualify.</p>
      <p><b>Georgia </b>cannot qualify automatically but will take part in the play-offs. Gibraltar have been eliminated. </p>

      <h3>Group E</h3>
      <p><b>Croatia </b>only need to avoid defeat to Slovakia in their final qualifier to earn a place at the finals.</p>
      <p><b>Hungary </b>will hope that Slovakia fail to beat Croatia. If so, Hungary would only need a point away to Wales in order to progress.</p>
      <p><b>Slovakia </b>will qualify automatically if they win both of their remaining games, away to Croatia and at home to Azerbaijan.</p>
      <p><b>Wales </b>must win both their remaining games to reach the finals and hope that Slovakia drop points in their two qualifiers.</p>
      <p>Ryan Giggs’ side will see their hopes of automatic qualification end if they lose in Azerbaijan on Saturday but can be confident of securing a play-off place.</p>
      <p><b>Azerbaijan </b>can still progress to the finals through the play-offs but currently sit outside the qualification places.</p>
      <h3>Group F</h3>
      <p><b>Spain </b>have qualified.</p>
      <p><b>Sweden </b>are assured of at least a play-off place but will qualify automatically if they win away in Romania.</p>
      <p><b>Romania </b>must win both of their final two qualifiers against Sweden and Spain in order to be sure of progressing to the finals.</p>
      <p><b>Norway </b>are assured of at least a play-off place and are likely to need it, unless they beat the Faroe Islands and Malta and a number of other results go their way.</p>
      <p><b>Faroe Islands </b>and <b>Malta </b>have been eliminated.</p>
      <h3>Group G</h3>
      <p><b>Poland </b>have qualified.</p>
      <p><b>Austria </b>are assured of at least a play-off place and will qualify automatically with a point against North Macedonia on Saturday.</p>
      <p><b>North Macedonia, Slovenia</b> and <b>Israel </b>are all level on 11 points. Only North Macedonia are assured of a play-off place, while Slovenia can only qualify automatically.</p>
      <p>All three must win both of their remaining games in order to qualify directly and hope results elsewhere go their way. <b>Latvia </b>have been eliminated. </p>

      <h3>Group H</h3>
      <p><b>Turkey </b>will qualify automatically if they take at least a point at home against Iceland. </p>
      <p><b>France </b>will qualify automatically if they beat Moldova at home, though a draw or even a defeat will be enough if Iceland lose in Turkey.</p>
      <p><b>Iceland’s </b>best hope appears to be the play-offs. They need to beat Turkey and Moldova in their final two games and hope results elsewhere go in their favour.</p>
      <p><b>Albania</b>, <b>Moldova </b>and <b>Andorra </b>have all been eliminated.</p>
      <h3>Group I</h3>
      <p><b>Belgium </b>have qualified as group winners and Russia have qualified in second place.</p>
      <p><b>Scotland </b>will take part will take part in the play-offs as one of the Nations League Group C winners.</p>
      <p><b>Cyprus</b>, <b>Kazakhstan </b>and <b>San Marino </b>have all been eliminated</p>
      <h3>Group J</h3>
      <p><b>Italy </b>have qualified as group winners.</p>
      <p><b>Finland </b>will qualify for a major tournament for the first time in their history if they beat Liechtenstein at home on Friday.</p>
      <p><b>Bosnia and Herzegovina </b>are assured of at least a play-off place but hopes of qualifying automatically are slim. </p>
      <p>They need to win both their final games against Italy and Liechtenstein and hope Finland and Armenia drop points.</p>
      <p><b>Armenia </b>must win both their remaining matches and hope Finland lose twice.</p>
      <p><b>Greece </b>can still progress to the finals through the play-offs but currently sit outside the qualification places. <b>Liechtenstein </b>have been eliminated.</p>
