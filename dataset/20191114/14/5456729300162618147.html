      <p>In his remarks the founder of the foundation, Alhaji Nasiru said “We are here again in Jigawa today because of the vision we have for our people. With the aid of our partners and the Jigawa State Ministry of Health, the NHD Medical Mission is here to create a platform where my brothers and sisters in Dutse can get free medical attention and support.</p>
      <p>“We are also here because it is evident that in spite of the laudable efforts of the government our people still need our help, support and assistance. We have decided to pick up the challenge and help in whatever way we can, especially in the healthcare and educational sectors. This is a vision we must achieve together. Government can not do it alone. Neither can I. We all have to join in.</p>
      <p>“Some of us have big ambitions and big dreams; while some just dream of making it through the day. But in all this, one hope we all share is to live a healthy life. This is why we have decided to better organize our outreach and build awareness.</p>
