      <p>Signing a contract for a new phone plan can be a gigantic hassle. There’s always hidden charges lurking on the next page and the plan could change midway through its run if you go over a certain usage limit. And for those of us who aren’t glued to our phones constantly, why should we pay for data we aren’t using? Being locked into a contract means you’re stuck for over a year with no way out.</p>
      <p>Now, <a href="https://mint-mobile.58dp.net/c/256585/696361/7915">you don’t have to worry about any of that noise</a>, thanks to Mint Mobile. Mint Mobile offers simple mobile plans starting as low as $15/mo, all on the nation’s most advanced LTE network. You pay for what you need and only that. No more getting suckered into buying unlimited 4G data plans and then not being able to carry over unused data from month to month. Mint offers plans with 3GB, 8GB, or 12GB of 4G LTE data, <a href="https://mint-mobile.58dp.net/c/256585/696361/7915">so you can choose the amount that’s right for you</a>. The unlimited talk and text helps to stay in touch with, if you’re like me, your mom who calls and texts you a lot.</p>
      <p>How do they offer plans for $15/mo? They switched up the wireless industry model and went online only — surprise, those retail stores and overhead are expensive. They also introduced the concept of buying in bulk to your phone plan, where the more months you buy upfront, the lower your monthly rate. You can get a taste of their best monthly rate on the introductory 3-month plan. The best part is, if you’re loving your plan and the great coverage that’s provided, you can choose a longer plan and lock in their lowest price. For $15/mo, $180 upfront, you can get their 3GB/mo plan for 12 months and forget about your phone bill until next year. The 8GB/mo plan runs you $20/mo and the 12GB/mo plan comes in at $25/mo. Mint Mobile also gives you a free SIM card, unlike some companies who charge for new cards, and it has three different sizes (standard, micro, and nano) to fit whichever device you have. You also get the ability to turn your device into a mobile hotspot, all on the nation’s fastest network.</p>
      <p>To me, it’s a very freeing feeling to know you’re not bogged down by a contract you can’t get out of. Switching to Mint means you only have to worry about shopping online for your wireless plan. It’s easy to do from anywhere, simply by heading to their <a href="https://mint-mobile.58dp.net/c/256585/696361/7915">website</a>. One of the best things about Mint is that you can try it at almost no cost to you. Checking out a three-month plan gives you the freedom to give it a go and test it out for yourself. Their three-month plan costs about as much as another carrier’s plan would be for just a month. And they offer a seven-day, money-back guarantee, so there’s no harm in trying it out! You’re saving in the long run, no matter what!</p>
      <p>But I know what you’re thinking: moving to a different carrier often times means having to change your phone number. Well, if your phone is compatible, Mint Mobile not only allows you to keep your phone number, they let you keep your phone! That’s right, you can keep the phone you love and the number that all your friends have (and your mom who might text or call too much.) If you want a new phone number, that’s fine too and it won’t cost you extra!</p>
      <p>If you’re at all worried about switching up your carrier or have questions about what might be the best for you, Mint’s website is chock full of amazing information and they don’t hide behind any big fancy jargon. It’s simple to find the answers on the website, as I’ve enjoyed their helpful chat function that allows you to ask whatever you want. Plus, you can always check the FAQ section to find what you need. If you prefer speaking on the phone, you can easily call a sales rep or customer support who will answer any question you have.</p>
      <p>So here’s how it works: First, you need to visit <a href="https://mint-mobile.58dp.net/c/256585/696361/7915">Mintmobile.com</a> to see if their coverage is right for your area. Next, you’ll need to see if your device is compatible. Then, choose your plan. Once you sign up, they’ll send you a sim card kit and all you need to do is punch it off the kit, insert it into the phone, and activate it. Then you’re on your way to saving a ton of money on your wireless bill.</p>
