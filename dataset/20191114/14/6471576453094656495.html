      <p>Speaking with industry publication <a href="https://www.autonews.com/mobility-report/hachigo-honda-stays-realistic-evs-avs">Automotive News</a> about the company‚Äôs plans for more electric vehicles and investments in self-driving technology, Hachigo explained that neither was a priority. This might sound strange considering the fanfare around the big unveiling of the <a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/news/2020-honda-e-pricing-announced-it-s-not-cheap-137338.html">very small (and rather expensive) e</a> at the 2019 Frankfurt Auto Show, but Honda is thinking more along the lines of <i>‚Äúhybrid‚Äù</i> instead of <i>‚Äúfull-on electric.‚Äù</i></p>
      <p><i>‚ÄúEVs will not be mainstream,‚Äù</i> Hachigo says. <i>‚ÄúThe hurdles to battery electric vehicles and complete autonomous driving are still quite high.‚Äù</i></p>
      <p>Honda‚Äôs plans include focusing on hybrid systems as a means to reduce emissions across its entire fleet, while providing customers with a reliable compromise: lower consumption and lower emissions, but without the limitations in range and long charging times. Hybrid vehicles are widely considered a stepping stone towards fully electric, an intermediary phase that should only last a second. Ideally speaking. Honda seems to believe that it‚Äôs the best of both worlds at this stage.</p>
      <p>It‚Äôs not automakers who push for electric vehicles, but demand that drives up their numbers, Hachigo continued. And consumers would rather <b>not</b> buy electric right now because the benefits don‚Äôt override the downsides.</p>
      <p><i>‚ÄúI do not believe there will be a dramatic increase in demand for battery vehicles, and I believe this situation is true globally. There are issues with infrastructure and hardware,‚Äù</i> he explains. <i>‚ÄúThere are different regulations in different countries, and we have to abide by them. So, it‚Äôs a must to continue research and development, but I don‚Äôt believe it will become mainstream anytime soon.‚Äù<br/></i><br/>So, while Hachigo isn‚Äôt saying that EVs and AVs are a pipe dream, he does seem to recommend to temper your enthusiasm when it comes to them. üèÅ</p>
