      <p>The Samsung Galaxy A70s unveiled back in September is now making way to China. The mid-range device is Samsung’s latest effort to win some relevance in the Chinese stronghold. According to <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/11/13/idc-chinas-smartphone-market-shows-another-decline/">IDC’s quarterly report</a>, the South-Korean company didn’t make it to the top 5 smartphone brands in China. It’s curious how the world’s smartphone leader can’t stand against local manufacturers in China. However, it won’t give up.</p>
      <p>The new smartphone offering comes in a single 8GB/128GB configuration which retails for CNY2,699 ($385/€350). This amount of money will get you a Snapdragon 675 and a 6.7″ FHD+ Super AMOLED display. There’s a fingerprint scanner underneath the display, while a waterdrop notch at the top serves as a house for the 32MP selfie snapper. Around the back, we have a triple-camera array comprising a 64MP sensor paired with an 8MP ultra-wide and 5MP depth sensor.</p>

      <p>The handset draws power from a 4,000mAh battery that charges via a USB-C port with 27W fast-charging. It runs Android 9 Pie out the box with Samsung’s One UI running atop. The Galaxy A70s comes in Dazzling Red, Spectral Black and Diamond White colors. If you’re interested, the device is available on the <a href="https://www.samsungeshop.com.cn/item/SM-A7070.htm">company’s official China</a> site or JD.com.</p>
      <p>Let’s see how the Galaxy A70s will perform against other Chinese giants in the same price segment.</p>
