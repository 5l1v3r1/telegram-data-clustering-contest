      <p>Almost eighteen years have passed since the release of Shenmue 2, and for a long time, it seemed that we would not see anything else in this series of action and adventure. However, the excitement of the fans and the determination of the director Yu Suzuki, along with the success of the Kickstarter campaign are going to bring Shenmue 3 in 2019. Continuing from its predecessor, Shenmue is expected to continue the story of teenage martial artist Ryo Hazuki and his endeavor to search his father’s murderer in China of the 1980s.</p>

      <p>The thoughts in the people’s mind that Shenmue 3 is a distant hope is now going to end as the audience will get the opportunity to experience and enjoy the game again in August 2019 with improved graphics. No wonder the Kickstarter campaign has contributed significantly towards the development of Shenmue 3, which is going to be released in 2019.</p>
      <h3>Shenmue 3 release date</h3>
      <p>After several years of waiting, Deep Silver and YS Net have finally announced a concrete release date for Shenmue 3 at Gamescon 2018, and the launching date for PC and <a href="https://www.technobezz.com/common-ps4-issues-fixes/">PS4</a> is August 27, 2019. The next trailer is going to reveal a lot about the game. The game was initially pegged for release on December 2017, and the release of Shenmue 3 was further postponed to 2018 before being again delayed at Gamescon to another window date of August 2019. However, the sugar coating on the bitter delay was another trailer that revealed the enemy Lan Di’s return.</p>
      <p>For anyone pledging with the Kickstarter campaign, the push in the release date may not come as a surprise. For creating such a massive game that creates an expectation of a large amount on the shoulders, delays are only normal. The present release time mentioned by the developers should also be taken with a pinch of salt.</p>

      <h3>Know about Shenmue 3</h3>
      <p>It is an open-world action and adventure series developed by YS Net and Neilo. This is the third in the series that is going to conclude Ryo Hazuki’s redemption tale while seeking revenge on his father’s death. We may have vast stretches of open land to explore with all the necessary innovation and charm when compared with the previous games that primarily dealt with the spades. The Kickstarter campaign managed to raise the grand total and with Sony providing the necessary support and funds. It is yet to be seen whether Yu Suzuki and his friends can bring about something fresh and unique within the budget although would like to see them go beyond the attempts. After all, Shenmue was one of the most expensive games ever produced.</p>

      <h3>Trailers of Shenmue 3</h3>
      <p>The first teaser trailer of Shenmue 3 shows us only a part of the in-development representation of the game and allows us to take a look at the primary characters and the new characters as well as the newly-imagined world of Shenmue.  According to this first-ever trailer of Shenmue 3 that was dropped at Gamescon 2017, some of the footages of the highly anticipated game came to us. The original game got a lot of acclaim for the day and night mechanics, mini-games, and interactivity. Therefore, we have to wait with bated breath to see the first actual gameplay footage for the game after several years of waiting. It is quite unfortunate that the trailer reveals so little about the game showing off some beautiful landscapes and the details of the skylines.</p>
      <p>The first few glances of Shenmue 3 until today have featured some characters with stiff faces without expression. The look of the protagonist, Ryo Hazuki face, was highly troublesome throughout the teaser trailer of the game. Thanks to Ys Net and Yu Suzuki, who heard the concerns of the fans during an interview with Game Watch during which it was revealed that the genuine facial expressions had been removed from the excerpts of the game that have already released.</p>

      <h3>Story of Shenmue 3</h3>
      <p>Shenmue 3 is supposed to conclude a story that started a long time ago in December 1999 on the Sega Dreamcast, so it is going to catch up with the rest of the story. After following the events of Shenmue 2 in the year 1987, the hero Ryo Hazuki has started his journey from the bustling suburbs of Yokosuka towards the mountains of Guilin in China in search of his father’s killer. During his journey in this part, he meets Ling Shenhua, the mysterious and romantic girl who also appeared in his dreams. She tells Ryo that they are together by fate or destiny and he must seek the killer of his father, Lan Di.</p>

      <p>The story begins in Bailu Village in Guilin, a rural riverside town filled with mini-games, shops, and several other characters. While the tale revolves around the revenge that Ryo Seeks, the true drive and motivation of the story beyond this distinct tale stays a mystery and is likely to surprise the passionate fans.</p>
      <h3>The gameplay of Shenmue 3</h3>
      <p>Although we have not seen proper gameplay of the third outing of Shenmue, the creator of the series Yu Suzuki provides us with plenty of exciting details since the announcement of a dream project. The next adventure of Ryo is going to be open-world and drops him in the riverside of Bailu, which is a humble abode equipped with distinctive temples, shops, and minigames for the players to enjoy and offers the gamers rewards such as special bonuses and items.</p>
      <p>Ryo will be able to make the necessary phone calls to his friends back in <a href="https://www.technobezz.com/japan-offers-us-weird-trailer-mobile-game/">Japan</a> while building the relationships in the past games through alternative conversations. It is not clear whether it is going to create an impact on the stats of Ryo, but it is going to be a nice bonus for venturing into the beaten path. As far as the combat is concerned, we have short glimpses through the pre-rendered screenshots and the development diaries of the small minutes.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The fans of Shenmue would love to know what they would be doing in the sequel and Suzuki has already announced that they may need ten million to make the new game an open-world experience in the real sense even though he did not explain the exact reasons behind the same.</p>
      <p>According to the trailer of Gamescon, we have encountered the gameplay for the first time, but the approach has been largely cinematic than usual. According to the trailer, we may get to see more of martial arts, talking and exploration and Suzuki has confirmed that the Quick Time Events is slated to make a return.</p>

      <h3>Things surrounding the release of the game</h3>
      <p>The announcement of Shenmue 3 was one of the big surprises of E3 2015, resulting in the initial clamor of support, which saw the Kickstarter campaign well over two million dollars within a few hours of launch.</p>
      <p>The total amount that Shenmue 3 is expected to raise is undoubtedly good news for the fans of the previous Shenmue games, and an indication how much demand is going to be there among the series, but there is a distance from the target that Suzuki initially set. According to Suzuki, he recently said that he needed to raise about ten million dollars to make Shenmue 3 a grand success as an open-world video game.</p>
      <h3>What do the screenshots reveal?</h3>
      <p>Ys Net has been slowly pushing out new Shenmue 3 screenshots over the past two and a half years from the date of its announcement, and one of the highlights from a recent batch of the screenshot shows that some the key features of the gameplay from the previous games are slated to make a comeback. Yes, the minigames are going to come back in Shenmue 3 and hopefully, the Japanese city of Yokosuka, which is sleepy, has an arcade of players for wasting time and inevitably waiting for the story to become available in the main campaign. During 2015, Ys Net took a poll to find out how the fans favor the mini-games from the past titles of Shenmue games; we can expect to see Duck Racing ad Lucky Hit in the third rendition long with a bunch of new characters.</p>
      <h3>News of Shenmue 3</h3>
      <p>Within a few short months until the release of this game, we have finally got the opportunity to look into Shenmue 3 thanks to the new trailers that have been revealed, especially, the one that came out during the Magic Festival at Monaco. It looks like the news about Shenmue will probably make a lot of people genuinely delighted. We have seen Ryo, Lan Di, Shenhua, and new or extended look into the pastures of Guilin along with the introduction of the other characters of the game. The cartoon sheen to the entire design is something that is worth remembering and keeps the original momentum of the game. For instance, the fighting also resembles the Dreamcast originals. However, the game looks exactly like what you would expect it to be and who can forget the sprawling budget of the original game.</p>
      <p>The Shenmue 3 director Yu Suzuki was at the Reboot Develop 2019 in Dubrovnik, Croatia and created a panel to discuss more the upcoming game. He shared information on the world of the games and created a feeling and its exact presence along with the soundtrack. Quite surprisingly, we have come to know how he tried to achieve the sense of ‘similarity’ as compared with realism. Even if the world of the game may not be real China, it still feels the same. Furthermore, he went on to talk more about the economy and how the systems connect to it. For instance, we come to know about the prize exchange system in Bailu village. The tokens earned during gambling and the minigames can be spent here. As you make the tokens, you can use them at the prize exchange and sell the prizes you do not need at the pawnshop. Apart from this, you can buy skill books or get them while exchanging the rewards.</p>
      <p>We also come to know about the availability of battle difficulty modes that also cast an impact on the complexity of the controls. For instance, you can practice in the dojo against the wooden mannequin, compete in the matches, and spar against the human opponents. While enhancing your level in the dojo, it will assist you in clearing the combats in the story, and you can swap between the story and the practice.</p>
      <p>As far as the minigames are concerned, you have the gacha, the UFO catcher and a punching game with a stress on the mechanical games. In addition to this, there are a few electronic games that allow you to win the tokens. The forklift revealed lately is slower than the original game, but adequately integrated with the storytelling of the game and its critical path. The director of Shenmue 3 concluded by saying that the style of the game has changed drastically. He still feels that people are going to like it, and the game is still going to have the feel of Shenmue the original in Shenmue 3.</p>
      <h3>Summing it up</h3>
      <p>As we come to know the details, trailers, gameplay, and the news of Shenmue 3, it is for us to wait till we find out what lies in store for the game lovers. Hopefully, there is going to be much about the game than what has been revealed. But until we get to see the real game, there is a lot to be envisaged. With a whopping crowdfunding campaign, we are probably about two months away from the release of Shenmue 3. We want to see even more about the game for which the recent trailers should suffice as each one of them is going to show a slice of the combat that is to take place in the action-filled game coming our way soon.</p>
