      <p>Labour has accused the Tories of being “staggeringly out of touch” after Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the NHS was in many ways performing better than ever.</p>
      <p>New NHS figures show the health service is performing at its worst ever level against key targets on A&amp;E, cancer care and the wait for operations.</p>
      <p>Some 4.42 million patients – the highest ever number – are on the waiting list for treatment, while one in six patients waits too long in A&amp;E and there are longer waits for cancer care and operations such as hip replacements.</p>
      <p>Health charities and think tanks have described the NHS as in crisis, with emergency care doctors saying the service is “imploding”.</p>

      <p>“In many ways, the NHS is performing better than it ever has. The challenge is that demand is increasing as well,” he told BBC Radio 4’s The World At One programme.</p>
      <p>“The performance of the system is incredible. The people who are working in the NHS are doing a remarkable job.</p>
      <p>“We are putting record amounts of funding in over the next four years. We have got record numbers of doctors and nurses, with more to come.”</p>
      <p>But shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: “This is staggeringly out of touch.</p>
      <p>“Matt Hancock is clueless about the levels of pain and misery he and his Tory cuts have caused patients.</p>
      <p>“He insists ‘in many ways the NHS is performing better than it ever has’ on the day it’s confirmed the NHS A&amp;E performance is the worst ever.</p>
      <p>“This shows the Tories simply don’t care about our NHS.”</p>

      <p>And Liberal Democrat health spokeswoman Luciana Berger said: “This is a damning indictment of the Conservatives’ dismal record on the NHS.”</p>
      <p>But Prime Minister Boris Johnson said only the Tories could be trusted to have a “strong, dynamic economy” to ensure the rises in the NHS budget being planned could be made.</p>
      <p>The new NHS data shows that one in six patients waited longer than four hours in A&amp;E in England during October – the worst ever performance since the four-hour target was introduced in 2004.</p>
      <p>Some 83.6% of patients arriving at A&amp;E were treated or admitted in four hours.</p>
      <p>The target is 95% but it has not been met since July 2015.</p>
      <p>The data also showed that in September, 84.8% of patients started treatment within 18 weeks against a target of 92%.</p>
      <p>The target was last met in February 2016.</p>
      <p>The target to start cancer treatment within 62 days of an urgent referral is also being missed.</p>
      <p>Some 76.9% of cancer patients started treatment in 62 days in September, below the 85% target.</p>
      <p>Overall, more than 4.4 million patients are on the waiting list.</p>
      <blockquote>If this trend keeps going, I fear we could see 100,000 people stuck on trolleys this coming January<cite>Professor John Appleby, Nuffield Trust</cite></blockquote>
      <p>The data comes as the Royal College of Surgeons called on political leaders to keep the 18-week wait for planned treatment – which is currently under review and could be scrapped.</p>
      <p>Nuffield Trust chief economist Professor John Appleby said: “These figures show the next government will immediately be faced with one of the bleakest winters in the NHS’s history.”</p>
      <p>Prof Appleby added: “We have many months to go until seasonal pressures really hit the NHS, but October has already seen an unprecedented slump, with performance against the main A&amp;E target worse than ever.</p>
      <p>“The health service is seeing far more patients, yet one in six is now waiting more than four hours in A&amp;E. If the usual trends continue after Christmas, that would head towards one in five.</p>
      <p>“Meanwhile, the number of people waiting on trolleys in corridors because no beds are available has already hit 80,000 – something we have only seen before in the very coldest part of the year.</p>
      <p>“If this trend keeps going, I fear we could see 100,000 people stuck on trolleys this coming January.</p>
      <p>“As the election promises roll in, we should be under no illusion about the money, staff and time it will take to turn this situation around.”</p>
      <p>Richard Murray, chief executive of the King’s Fund, said: “Amidst the political rhetoric of the General Election campaign, today’s statistics lay bare the stark reality for patients across the country who are struggling to access NHS hospital services.”</p>
      <p>In March, NHS England announced proposals to scrap the key targets for patients to be seen in A&amp;E within four hours, or to receive an operation within 18 weeks.</p>
      <p>Instead, figures would be published on how long patients spend on average in A&amp;E and the 18-week target would be replaced by an average marker of the time it takes to start treatment.</p>
