      <p>CRESTVIEW, Fla. (AP) — Authorities say a 30-year-old ex-Marine walked into a Florida police station and confessed to fatally shooting his parents and two dogs.</p>
      <p>Okaloosa County Sheriff’s spokeswoman Michele Nicholson says Jacob Daniel Price wore a bloody shirt when he arrived at the Crestview Police Department early Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Sheriff’s deputies found the bodies of 51-year-old Jolene Price and 56-year-old Robert Price in the home’s master bedroom. An arrest report says they were shot in the head.</p>

      <p>Nicholson said Price was living with his parents.</p>
      <p>Marine Corps spokeswoman Yvonne Carlock tells the <a href="https://www.nwfdailynews.com/news/20191113/update-crestview-man-former-marine-kills-parents-turns-himself-in">Northwest Florida Daily News</a> that Price was deployed twice during Operation Enduring Freedom. She says he left the service because his character “was incongruent with Marine Corps’ expectations and standards.”</p>
      <p>He’s charged with murder. A lawyer isn’t listed on jail records.</p>
