      <p>NEW YORK -- In an ABC News exclusive, Teresa Giudice is talking for the first time about reuniting overseas with her husband Joe, <a href="https://abc7ny.com/entertainment/rhonj-star-joe-giudice-can-be-in-italy-as-he-fights-deportation/5597575/">who was deported</a>.</p>
      <p>The "Real Housewives of New Jersey" star spoke with Paula Faris for Thursday morning's edition of "Good Morning America."</p>
      <p>"Is he at peace, does Joe seem like he's at peace?" Paula asked.</p>
      <p>"He said he cried, after we left he cried the whole day, he said," she said. "Just missing his daughters. He said he was so sad."</p>
      <p>The couple has four daughters, and they vacationed together in Italy.</p>
      <p>Though Joe Giudice opposes his deportation, he asked a court to allow him to relocate to Italy during the fight.</p>
      <p>The couple pleaded guilty in 2014 to financial fraud, and Teresa Giudice served her sentence first and was released in December 2015.</p>
      <p>Joe Giudice has been held by immigration officials since he completed his 41-month prison term. A judge ruled that he would be deported upon completion of his sentence.</p>
      <p>Giudice has said he came to the U.S. as an infant and wasn't aware he wasn't an American citizen.</p>
      <p>As for their relationship, Teresa said it's "to be determined." She added that they're taking it day by day.</p>
      <p>She told Faris that she and Joe only want the best for each other.</p>
