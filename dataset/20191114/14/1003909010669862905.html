      <h1>Preview: Powerhouse cast helps emerging artists deal with The Merchant of Venice's anti-semitism</h1>

      <p>Theatre royalty has gathered in Calgary to prepare a new take on Shakespeare’s The Merchant of Venice, a play still considered controversial for the anti-semitism expressed by several characters.</p>
      <p>The story has moneylender Shylock agreeing to cover a loan for a young nobleman named Bassanio on the condition that, if he cannot repay the loan in the time agreed, Bassanio will forfeit a pound of flesh.</p>
      <p>The Shakespeare Company’s artistic director Haysam Kadri approached internationally acclaimed director Carey Perloff, who directed him in the world premiere of A Thousand Splendid Suns, to tackle the intricacies of The Merchant of Venice.</p>
      <p>At the time of Kadri’s offer, Perloff was staying at the Stratford home of Seana McKenna, who had directed King Lear for Kadri and who had worked with Perloff numerous times at Stratford and in San Francisco.</p>
      <p>“I was directing Private Lives for the Stratford Festival. Seana, who has been a longtime friend and collaborator, had taken the year off. When we were all taking about The Merchant of Venice, Seana recalled, over the years, she had played all three of the major female roles and suggested maybe she should play my Sherlock. Haysam and I had already discussed that possibility so we were overjoyed she was eager to join us on the project,” says Perloff.</p>
      <p>Perloff had also worked with Vancouver actor and director Dean Paul Gibson when she was artistic director of San Francisco’s American Conservatory Theatre on such projects as Major Barbara, which transferred to Theatre Calgary. She immediately offered him the role of the Venetian merchant Antonio who helps broker the loan for Bassanio.</p>
      <p>The Shakespeare Company’s The Merchant of Venice is a co-production with Hit &amp; Myth Productions and the University of Calgary’s School of Creative and Performing Arts and will feature eight emerging artists alongside establish actors such as Jamie Konchak, Joel Cochrane, Myron Dearden and David Haysom.</p>
      <p>“For these young artists, our Merchant of Venice is like a masterclass. They get to work with Seana, Dean and Calgary’s Jamie Konchak who plays (the pivotal role of) Portia, but the material in the play is proving to be a difficult experience for some of them.</p>
      <p>“These dedicated, wholesome, kind young Canadians are required to spout the kind of anti-semitic bile, hate, bigotry and racism that is being normalized in our contemporary society. It’s the kinds of things we hear Trump saying about immigrants. It’s a difficult experience because they are such sensitive young actors and there are some very ugly things done and said in the play.”</p>
      <p>Perloff says that by changing Shylock’s gender, the play is no longer just about Christians and their views of Jews but about a group of misogynist men and their views of women. I never anticipated discovering this when I agreed to have Seana play Shylock. It has become such a rich experience to explore Shakespeare’s play with all this new imagery.</p>
      <p>“Shylock has a great deal of power and it is doubly fascinating now to see how the men try to manipulate her into losing it.”</p>
      <p>One of the subplots in The Merchant of Venice involves Shylock’s daughter Jessica who is in love with Bassanio’s friend Lorenzo. Perloff says this subplot takes on “a whole new resonance and weight now that it is a mother/daughter relationship.</p>
      <p>“These new intricacies (that) the casting requires us to deal with makes the play seem so new, so immediate and so very exciting and fascinating.”</p>
      <p>The Merchant of Venice runs in the University’s Reeve Theatre Nov. 28 to Dec. 8 with evening performances at 7 p.m. and 2:30 p.m. matinees on Nov. 30 and Dec. 1, 7 and 8. Tickets can be reserved online at shakespearecompany.com or by phone at the Vertigo box-office at 403-221-3708.</p>
