      <p>Gas Guzzlers Extreme on PS4 will also include the Full Metal Frenzy and Full Metal Zombie DLCs. The second DLC is all about using your vehicle to take out the zombie hordes, but they have weapons and killing too many means the ground becomes slick which can lead to your own vehicle crashing out and being overrun. There’s a total of 42 tracks, 12 game modes and arenas, 21 cars, 12 weapons, 22 zombie types, and eight environments.</p>
