      <h1>Kyoji Horiguchi tears ACL, drops Rizin title and pulls out of NYE main event</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T14:05:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 14:05</time> by <a rel="author">Anton Tabuena</a></address>
      <p>Bellator and Rizin are both collaborating on a two-day special in Japan, and their new year’s eve card just lost its main event. The unfortunate news was announced by Rizin officials on Thursday, saying that Bellator and Rizin champion Kyoji Horiguchi has torn his ACL and damaged his meniscus in his right knee.</p>
      <p>The two-promotion champion has undergone a successful surgery, and is currently having rehab in Florida. According to the release, Horiguchi is expected to be out of competition for 10 months.</p>
      <p>With the injury, his planned main event rematch with Kai Asakura has been scrapped. A new headliner has yet to be revealed, but the promotion also states that Horiguchi has “asked to revoke his status as RIZIN Champion” and has dropped the title.</p>
      <p>“When I think about everybody who was looking forward to my fight on NYE I am lost in words and have an indescribable feeling of guilt for everybody,” Horiguchi said. “I am sorry. I am sorry to Kai Asakura, I am sorry to all the fans. I cannot describe how I feel in words.</p>
      <p>“...I have felt some abnormities in my body from last year but I didn’t take these signs too seriously. I started to train again in October but failed to realize how much wear and tear my body has obtained. And my ligament in my knee snapped. This was all because I took my body’s warnings lightly.”</p>
