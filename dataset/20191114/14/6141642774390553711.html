      <p>Macclesfield’s problems continue to mount up after they were charged with misconduct over the non-payment of players.</p>
      <p>The EFL has announced that the League Two club have now been referred to a disciplinary commission, which has the power to impose “a full range of sanctions” if the club are found guilty of misconduct.</p>
      <p>A league statement released on Thursday afternoon read: “The EFL recognises the impact the non-payment of wages has on the health and well-being of those involved and has been engaged in discussions with Macclesfield Town and the Professional Footballers’ Association (PFA) to try and find an appropriate solution.</p>

      <p>“The club was given until 4pm yesterday to provide a response to the EFL’s request for information in this respect.</p>
      <p>“As a result of the information provided, the EFL has notified the club of multiple charges related to failing to adhere to the terms of the contracts that are in operation.”</p>
      <p>The Cheshire club have been charged under section 63.7 of the EFL’s rules, which states that the terms of a standard contract between a club and a player shall be strictly adhered to.</p>
      <p>The disciplinary commission has a range of sanctions available to it, which can start at a reprimand or warning up to sporting penalties such as docking points.</p>

      <p>The EFL said on Tuesday that wages from July to September had been paid from solidarity and basic award payments.</p>
      <p>In Thursday’s statement, the EFL said a further £30,000 had been released after the club fulfilled their EFL Trophy fixture on Wednesday night.</p>
      <p>Concerns are growing that Macclesfield may suffer the same fate as Bury, who were expelled from the league in August after failing to provide guarantees of financial sustainability.</p>
      <p>The club fielded six youth team players and five loanees in their FA Cup first-round defeat to seventh-tier Kingstonian at the weekend.</p>
      <p>BBC Radio Manchester has reported that local businessman Joe Sealey has made an offer to buy the club.</p>
