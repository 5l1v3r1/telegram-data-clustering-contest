      <h2>Manchester United have been long time admirers of Kalidou Koulibaly - and he could be available for a cut price fee in the next transfer window</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T14:40:15+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 14:40</time> by <a rel="author">Rich Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/rich-jones/</a></address>
      <p>Napoli are at risk of losing star centre-back Kalidou Koulibaly for a cut-price fee after their drastic downturn in form.</p>
      <p>Kouliably has been a long-term target of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> , and they had a world record £91million offer declined before turning their attentions to Harry Maguire.</p>
      <p>But Napoli's struggles so far this season has led to clashes amongst players and fans, leading to stars including the Senegalese centre-back to hire bodyguards to protect themselves and their families.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.ilmattino.it/sport/sscnapoli/napoli_caos_flop_quotazioni_mercato-4859383.html">Il Mattino</a> , Napoli could now be pressured into letting Koulibaly leave for a cut-price fee of around £69million, significantly less than offers they previously declined.</p>

      <p>Unrest has broken out at the Serie A side, with Napoli said to be considering suing their own players after they refused to attend a training retreat ordered by their president.</p>
      <p>Carlo Ancelotti is on the brink of the sack with the club already 13 points adrift of league leaders <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/juventus-fc">Juventus</a> having had ambitions of challenging for the Serie A title.</p>

      <p>Koulibaly could now push for an exit and the club may need to cash-in given the Senegalese ace still has plenty of value despite an indifferent start to the campaign.</p>
      <p>Discussing Koulibaly last month, president Aurelio De Laurentiis said: "I loved Koulibaly the man so I refused £91m offer, but a time will come when I'll have to sell him.</p>
      <p>"Whoever says we didn't improve our defence is wrong."</p>
