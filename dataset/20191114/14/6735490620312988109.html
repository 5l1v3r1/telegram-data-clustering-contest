      <p>The Beatles icon speaks with <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/8543413/paul-mccartney-billboard-cover-story-interview-2019"><i>Billboard</i></a> for the publication’s 125th anniversary. He explains how his longevity as a musician is due, in part, to keeping his focus primarily on his art.</p>
      <p>“I’ve got so much brain, and 90 per cent of it has to be free for songs and art,” McCartney says. “If I block that out with finance, I’m sunk. So 10 per cent of me can think about where we’re going, but I keep the rest open to do various artistic things”</p>
      <p><b>“</b>When you do something, you kind of do it for yourself,” he says of <i>Egypt Station</i>. “But at the same time, you want people to hear it and judge whether it’s any good.”</p>
      <p>He also attributes The Beatles’ growth and success to that sort of meticulous attention to art.</p>

      <p><b>“</b>We’d do one song, and it’d be a hit, and instead of doing another with the same formula, we’d say, ‘OK, we’ve done that,'” McCartney explains. “You listen to The Beatles’ output and no two songs are alike.”</p>
      <p>The 125th anniversary special of <i>Billboard</i> hits newsstands on Saturday.</p>
