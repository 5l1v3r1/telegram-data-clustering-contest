      <h1>Disney+ Features the Uncensored Cut of Disney's GARGOYLES Series</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T14:00:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 14:00</time> by <a rel="author">Joey Paur</a></address>
      <p>If you’ve been watching <b><i>Gargoyles</i></b>on Disney+, you may or may not have noticed that the version of the series they are streaming is the unedited and uncensored cut of the series. The news was confirmed by <a href="https://twitter.com/GregXB?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1194235585701044224&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcomicbook.com%2Ftv-shows%2F2019%2F11%2F13%2Fgargoyles-disney-plus-unedited-uncensored-episodes%2F">Greg Bishansky</a> with the following tweet:</p>

      <p>When the series first aired there was some pretty heavy content in series. Some of that content was edited for TV when the series re-aired on Toon Disney and DisneyXD.</p>
      <p>For example, in the episode titled "Deadly Force,” Broadway curiously picks up a gun, which is something he’s never held before. While holding the gun he accidentally shoots Elisa with it. In the original scene, Broad gets blood on his hands and that scene ended up being edited out. At one point the episode <a href="https://geektyrant.com/news/10-banned-episodes-from-popular-kid-shows-you-wont-believe">was banned</a> after parents complained that a beloved Disney character shot a woman.</p>
      <p>There are a few other instances in the series as there was actually a surprising amount of blood in it for a kid’s TV show.</p>
      <p>With the series now streaming and fans diving into the show again, <i>Gargoyles</i> creator <b>Greg Weisman</b> is <a href="https://geektyrant.com/news/the-creator-of-disneys-gargoyles-campaigns-to-bring-the-series-back">campaigning</a> for Disney to bring back the show and revive it in some way with #KeepBingingGargoyles.</p>
