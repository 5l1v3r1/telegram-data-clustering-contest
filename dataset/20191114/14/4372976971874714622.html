      <h1>Last Saab 9-3 built nets nearly $48,000 at auction</h1>
      <h2>One of the last Saabs built by NEVS before it lost the rights to the name and logo</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T14:31:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 14:31</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.autoblog.com/bloggers/sven-gustafson/" target="_blank">Sven Gustafson</a></address>
      <p>It was among the last <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/saab/">Saabs</a> to roll off the production line in Trollhättan, Sweden, is virtually new, and now it has a new owner. The <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/saab/9_3/">Saab 9-3</a> Aero Turbo4 we <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2019/10/07/last-saab-9-3-built-being-auctioned/">told you about a month ago</a> has sold in an <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/category/auction-action/">auction</a> for the equivalent of $47,789.</p>
      <p>As with anything related to the remnants of the legendary Swedish automotive brand, the backstory on this one is a little complicated, starting with the model year. <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/saab/">Saab</a> originally ground production to a halt in 2011. This model came about after National Electric Vehicle Sweden (<a href="https://www.autoblog.com/tag/nevs/">NEVS</a>) acquired the brand out of bankruptcy, and was part of a run of 420 models built starting in late 2013 before NEVS lost the rights to use the Saab name and griffin logo. It was originally set aside for <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/tag/crash+test/">crash testing</a>, but never actually used for that purpose, and mostly sat idle inside the plant, in case NEVS restarted production of combustion vehicles. The 41 miles on the odometer came from running the car on a test track near the Trollhättan plant for photography and video purposes.</p>
      <p>It features a 2.0-liter turbo-four engine that makes 217 horsepower and 258 pound-feet of torque. It has a two-tone interior with cream leather seats and a dashboard and center console that looks like what you might expect to result from Saab's parts-sharing arrangement under the ownership of bankruptcy-era <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/category/gm/">General Motors</a>.</p>
      <p>Nowadays, NEVS has financial backing from Chinese investors and is <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2017/12/06/nevs-production-saab-derived-9-3/">making electric vehicles based on the 9-3</a> platform and body, just without any Saab badging. It continues to operate the Trollhättan plant and another in Tianjin, China, and it reportedly plans a new plant in Shanghai. NEVS also has <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2019/01/30/koenigsegg-nevs-joint-venture-saab-evs/">partnered with Swedish supercar maker Koenigsegg</a> in a venture to develop new <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/electric/">EVs</a>.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/saab/9_3/">9-3</a> buyer’s name is Claus Spaangaard. He’s a Danish car collector and car-repair shop owner who says he already owns two Saab cars. Proceeds from the auction will fund research into sustainable mobility in Sweden, NEVS says.</p>
