      <p>Lionel Messi has players queuing to swap shirts with him after every game, but the Argentine once revealed that there has only ever been one player he asked to swap shirts with in his entire career.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The Argentine has returned to top form recently, netting an incredible eight goals in his past five LaLiga games.</p>
      <p>Overall, he is the leading all-time goalscorer in the Spanish top flight as well as for his club, which makes his jersey one of the most sought after every game.</p>
      <p>He is often seen exchanging his No. 10 shirt with opposing players, but he revealed back in 2017 that Zinedine Zidane was the only player whose jersey he actively asked for.</p>
      <p>"I'm don't ask for shirts, I usually swap them, but I asked Zidane once," Messi said in an interview with <i>TyC Sports</i>.</p>
      <p>"If there is an Argentine I swap it with him, but, unless someone asks me, I'm not asking anyone."</p>

      <p>Zidane played for Real Madrid at the time of the swap, in a team that was filled with superstars such as Ronaldo Nazario, David Beckham and Roberto Carlos, and wore the No. 5 shirt, which he exchanged for Messi's No. 30 jersey.</p>
