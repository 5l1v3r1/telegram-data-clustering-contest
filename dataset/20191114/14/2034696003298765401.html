      <p>Demi Lovato has worked with producer Oak Felder previously</p>
      <p>Lovato recently <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/demi-lovato-speaks-out-hospitalisation-2564782">spoke out publicly for the first time about her overdose last year, saying that she’s “overcome a lot” in her life since.</a></p>
      <p>Making an appearance at the Teen Vogue Summit in Los Angeles earlier this month (November 2), the pop star reflected on being hospitalised and subsequently being transferred to rehab in 2018 as she struggled with her mental health.</p>
      <p>She told those in attendance that she has “never been more in tune with who I am than where I’m at today,” revealing she was “a little nervous” about appearing in public again (via <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8542342/demi-lovato-reflects-on-year-since-hospitalization-at-teen-vogue-summit-la"><i>Billboard</i></a>).</p>
      <p>Speaking of her newfound self-love and a fresh outlook on life, Lovato also said she’s “an extremely sensitive person” and is taking a new approach in tackling critics.</p>
