      <p>Sadistic mum-of-two Joanna Dennehy brutally stabbed three men to death within a chilling 10 day murder spree.</p>
      <p>Driven by a "lust for blood", Dennehy then dumped the bodies in ditches around Peterborough with two accomplices.</p>
      <p>She first killed her house mate, Lukasz Slaboszewski, on March 19, 2013.</p>
      <p>Then 10 days later she butchered her second house mare, John Chapman, anda third man, Kevin Lee.</p>
      <p>Kevin Lee was dressed in a black sequined dress before Dennehy dumped his corpse.</p>

      <p>Their bodies were found on April 3.</p>
      <p>Her appalling crimes became known as the Peterborough Ditch Murders and even after her killing spree, Dennehy didn't stop her violence.</p>
      <p>She attacked two random dog walkers, stabbing one 30 times, before she was finally taken into custody.</p>
      <p>But before Dennehy murdered her three victims, she had been terrifying other mums in the playground while on the school run.</p>
      <p>Her former partner and father of her children, John Treanor, told QuestRed's The Killer In My Family that she had always been "jealous and abusive", especially to other mums.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>He said: "She was threatening female friends of mine up the school.</p>
      <p>"I was even pulled in with a social worker, headteacher, and my daughter's teacher who basically said she can't come up to the school anymore because she was threatening people that I was talking to.</p>
      <p>"She liked to control me in so many different ways."</p>
      <p>And Dennehy's disturbing behaviour was also affecting her young children.</p>
      <p>John said: "Her idea of playing with my eldest daughter was throwing stones at cars. It wasn't a normal mother-daughter relationship."</p>
      <p>Even her own defence team were terrified of the killer.</p>

      <p>Dennehy's defence barrister Michael Proctor admits he was very anxious in her presents and even feared she would harm him.</p>
      <p>He said: "I remember her picking up a pen, a pen that I just happened to have on me.</p>
      <p>"Obviously, if I'm in a situation with a lady who has got nothing to lose, I start having thoughts thinking that she could do anything she wants at this particular point.</p>
      <p>"It's not going to make any difference. I thought it was a strange situation to be in, and I can remember taking the pen carefully away."</p>
      <p>And when Dennehy was finally arrested and taken into custody, she flirted with police officers as they presented the huge catalogue of evidence against her.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>Dennehy was caught while she was on the run for the three murders when she randomly attacked two dog walkers.</p>
      <p>But it was her behaviour after her arrest that was truly chilling.</p>
      <p>Journalist Laura Bill told QuestRed's The Killer In My Family: "When Dennehy was arrested, she was flirting with the officers who arrested her, she was running her hands through her hair, she was very flippant about the charges that she was being presented with."</p>
      <p>It seemed the killer was revelling in the attention she was receiving from the police, a theory backed by by forensic criminologist, Dr Jane Monckton Smith.</p>
      <p>She said: "This person is not anxious or concerned or remorseful that she's been arrested.</p>
      <p>"She was almost, I would say, enjoying it. She was flirting with the officers, she was smiling, she was leaning across the desk in a very familiar way." </p>
      <p>Joanne Dennehy pleaded guilty to three counts of murder and two further attempted murders and was sentenced to a whole-life term in prison.</p>
