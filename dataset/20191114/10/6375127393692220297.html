      <h3>BARANGAY Ginebra takes on a dangerous Columbian Dyip team in a game that could very well serve as the Gin Kings’ preparation for the playoff round of the 2019 PBA Governors’ Cup.</h3>
      <p>The Gin Kings went hot and cold early in the elimination, but they were able to pull off a big victory in their last outing to formalize their entry into the quarterfinal round.</p>
      <p>That was last Nov. 8 when the Gin Kings defeated title contender Talk ‘N Text in overtime, 96-93, in a game Japeth Aguilar, Justine Brownlee and Stanley Pringle alternated on offense all gamelong.</p>
      <p>Aguilar scored 29 points and hauled down 10 rebounds, Brownlee tallied 24 points, 16 rebounds and six assists while Pringle added 14 points, five rebounds and four assists in leading the Gin Kings to their sixth win in nine games.</p>
      <p>For the Gin Kings, their victory over the KaTropa and their remaining two games against the Dyip at 7 p.m. today at the Smart Araneta Coliseum and NorthPort on November 17, are mere preparations for the tougher games ahead in the quarterfinals.</p>
      <p>The Gin Kings are running fourth at 6-3, and they could still improve their standings if they win their last two games and coupled with Meralco loss to Rain or Shine on November 17.</p>
      <p>The Dyip on the other hand are seeking to bounce back from 92-74 loss to the Bolts last Nov. 8 to strengthen their position.</p>
      <p>Currently, the Dyip are toting a 4-6 slate and are sharing the 7th to 9th places with Alaska and NorthPort.</p>
      <p>The Dyip certainly need this one to get out of that logjam. The good thing though about their current situation is that the Dyip have defeated both the Aces (117-110, Sept. 20) and the Batang Pier (114-108, Oct. 2).</p>
      <p>In the event the Dyip remain tied with the Aces and the KaTropa at the close of the elimination, the Dyip have the best quotient.</p>
      <p>Phoenix Fuels and Blackwater, two teams that are already out of the running, collide in the first tussle at 4:30 p.m.</p>
      <p>Both teams have 2-8 records, with the winner salvaging some measure of pride and will bid farewell to the season-ending conference on a winning note.</p>
