      <p>China's securities regulator is investigating one of the country's richest men for alleged violation of disclosure rules as a director of surveillance camera giant Hikvision , the company said.</p>
      <p>SHANGHAI: China's securities regulator is investigating one of the country's richest men for alleged violation of disclosure rules as a director of surveillance camera giant Hikvision , the company said.</p>
      <p>Directors Gong Hongjia and Hu Yangzhong had been named as suspects and would cooperate with the investigation by the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), the firm said in a filing to the stock exchange on Wednesday. It did not provide any detail of the alleged violations.</p>

      <p>Gong is a Hikvision vice chairman and the firm's largest individual shareholder with a 13.4per cent stake, according to Refinitiv data. The Forbes China rich list puts his net worth at US$9 billion, making him the 26th-richest person in the country.</p>
      <p>Hu is Hikvision's general manager and is ranked by Forbes as the 265th wealthiest person in China with a net worth of US$1.5 billion.</p>
      <p>Reuters was not immediately able to reach the two directors.</p>
      <p>The investigation concerned the "board member individuals" and not the company, a Hikvision spokeswoman said.</p>
      <p>Hikvision's share price fell as much as 4.5per cent in morning trade, while the broader market was up 0.2per cent.</p>
      <p>Hikvision, the world's biggest supplier of video surveillance systems, was one of eight firms added to a U.S. blacklist in October aimed at punishing Beijing for its treatment of Muslim minorities in the northwestern region of Xinjiang.</p>
      <p>The firm had allegedly provided surveillance equipment to police authorities throughout Xinjiang, where China has been accused by Washington of repression, arbitrary detention and high-technology surveillance against Muslim minority groups.</p>
      <p>Hikvision said at the time that it strongly opposed the U.S. decision and was working on contingency plans.</p>
      <p>In May, the CSRC said it was working to improve the quality of the country's listed firms after a series of disclosures stoked investor concerns over poor governance.</p>
