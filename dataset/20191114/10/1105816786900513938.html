      <h1>PBC urges govt to allow Nawaz to travel abroad for treatment</h1>

      <p><b>ISLAMABAD: </b>The Pakistan Bar Council (PBC) on Thursday urged the federal government to allow former prime minister Nawaz Sharif to travel abroad for medical treatment without the condition of submitting surety bonds.</p>
      <p>Vice Chairman of the PBC, Syed Ahmed Shah, condemned the federal government’s condition that the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) supremo would only be allowed to travel to London if he submitted surety bonds guaranteeing his return to the country after his recovery.</p>
      <p>The vice chairman referred to the government’s condition as “mockery”, adding that the Imran Khan-led government was disregarding the critical and very serious health condition of the former premier.</p>
      <p>He further stated that there is no justification for the demand of security bonds when the Islamabad High Court has already granted bail to Nawaz – after the filing surety bonds – on medical grounds.</p>

      <p>“Imposing of such an unjustified and illegal condition, in fact, amounts to negate and defy the order of the Honourable High Court entailing the consequences of the contempt of court,” the statement read.</p>
      <p>Earlier, SAPM Dr Firdous Ashiq Awan said some cabinet members had reservations over permitting Nawaz – who is serving seven-year prison term after his conviction in a NAB case – to go abroad on medical grounds.</p>
      <p>“However, Prime Minister Imran Khan considered the request of Leader of Opposition in the National Assembly Shehbaz Sharif on humanitarian grounds and gave his approval while also considering majority members’ support.</p>
      <p>PML-N later announced against submitting any surety bond in return for granting permission to Nawaz to go abroad.</p>
