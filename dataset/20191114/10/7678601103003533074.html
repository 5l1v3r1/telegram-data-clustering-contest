      <h1>Handle dissent delicately, Jokowi tells military, police citing Hong Kong unrest</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T10:55:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 10:55</time> by <a rel="author">Marchio Irfan Gorbiano</a></address>
      <p>President Joko "Jokowi" Widodo told security forces and regional heads not to underestimate signs of public discontent in a speech to members of the Regional Leadership Communication Forum (Forkopimda) at the Sentul Internasional Convention Center, Bogor, West Java, on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>"Be careful in handling even the smallest incident, especially the TNI [Indonesian Military] and the National Police," Jokowi said. "In Hong Kong there have been demonstrations five days a week for five months, leading to a recession, even though the economy was very good before."</p>
      <p>He also mentioned the protests in Chile and Bolivia as examples of what could happen if seemingly minor incidents were not handled correctly.</p>
      <p>"In Chile, just because of a transport fee hike of 4 percent, the APEC [Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation] summit that was supposed to be held there this month has been canceled," he said. "In Bolivia, because of an election dispute that was not addressed well, [President] Evo Morales was forced to resign [...] Be careful in handling even small matters, because if we are not sensitive, [discontent] can spread everywhere."</p>
      <p>Jokowi added that it was important for governors to communicate well with regional police chiefs, military commanders, head prosecutors and judges so that any tensions or problems could be addressed.Â </p>
      <p>"If there is a legal problem, conduct preventive [actions] first," he said. "Don't wait for [a bigger problem] to occur later before addressing it." (kmt)</p>
