      <h1>Rags to riches tale of Springbok wing whose try beat England in World Cup final</h1>
      <h2>Makazole Mapimpi breaks Eddie Jones' heart - then gets picked by England boss to play for his team in Barbarians clash</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T10:31:34+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 10:31</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Spink, https://www.facebook.com/alexspinkmirror/</a></address>
      <p>Eddie Jones last night called on the services of the two men who did most to end his World Cup dream.</p>
      <p>Tendai Mtawarira, who led the demolition of England’s scrum in the final a fortnight ago, was named by Jones in his Barbarians team to face Fiji.</p>
      <p>Alongside the ‘Beast’ for Saturday’s Twickenham showpiece Jones slotted Makazole Mapimpi, scorer of the try which killed England off once and for all.</p>
      <p>Jones was in no mood to talk about anything World Cup related. “It’s done and dusted. I can’t do anything about what’s happened,” he said.</p>

      <p>So South Africa wing Mapimpi stepped into the breach to reflect on what, remarkably, is the first trophy he has ever won.</p>
      <p>“I have watched my try I think 20 times,” he said. “I still don’t believe it’s me.”</p>
      <p>Mapimipi’s day of joy was a long time coming in a life that has been anything but easy. Never mind the lack of rugby opportunities in his early years, he has buried his mother, his sister and his brother.</p>

      <p>Mum Eunice was killed in a car accident, sister Zukiswa died from a severe headache, brother Zolani was electrocuted.</p>
      <p>If the journey out of poverty made by Siya Kolisi, the first World Cup-winning black captain, is destined for the big screen, Mapimpi’s is no less extraordinary.</p>
      <p>Born in a remote part of South Africa’s Eastern Cape the scorer of 14 tries in 14 Test starts did not enjoy private schooling, relying on the kindness of others just for a pair of boots to play in.</p>

      <p>As recently as five years ago he was turning out in the local Sunday league when a friend told him he had the skills to turn professional.</p>
      <p>“No bro,” he replied. “No-one is watching me. We are too far from the system.”</p>
      <p>Sitting in an exclusive London hotel overlooking Hyde Park yesterday, Mapimpi, whose name in Xhosa translates as ‘cobra’, stopped just short of pinching himself.</p>

      <p>“When I was young I would sometimes sit on my couch and pray about things,” he said. “But I didn’t bother with big goals.</p>
      <p>“I’m from a rural area, I didn’t make the schools teams. So winning the World Cup is a big thing for me.</p>
      <p>“A lot of things happen in South Africa that affect us,” he added. “I’ve seen a lot of things, things I don’t like. But I feel the World Cup has helped bring us together as a country. We have made people happy.”</p>
      <p>Not Jones of course.</p>

      <p>“But he’s still a funny guy, always smiling,” said Mapimpi. “Is it strange that we are on the same side so soon after the World Cup? No, he's a rugby man.</p>
      <p>“We play, then afterwards we shake hands. It’s sport. Nothing more.”</p>
