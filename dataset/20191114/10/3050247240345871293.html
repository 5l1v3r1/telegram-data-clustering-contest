      <h1>Softbank-Backed Blockchain Firm OneConnect Eyes $100M Nasdaq IPO</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T10:47:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 10:47</time> by <a rel="author">Marie Huillet</a></address>
      <p>Softbank-backed Chinese fintech OneConnect has filed for an Initial Public Offering (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/ipo">IPO</a>) with the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/usa">United States</a> Securities and Exchange Commission (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/sec">SEC</a>).</p>
      <p>As Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-13/ping-an-s-oneconnect-financial-files-for-ipo-amid-u-s-lull">reported</a> on Nov. 13, OneConnect is the blockchain- and AI-focused fintech arm of Chinese insurance giant Ping An.</p>
      <h3>Seeks $100 million and Nasdaq listing</h3>
      <p>The report claims that the filing seeks to raise $100 million, eyeing listing on the Nasdaq Global Market or New York Stock Exchange, if approved. </p>
      <p>Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Ping An Securities Group Holdings are leading the offering.</p>
      <p>OneConnect had previously <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-25/ping-an-is-said-to-plan-ipo-of-fintech-unit-at-8-billion-value">sought</a> a Hong Kong IPO with a target of raising $1 billion at a valuation of $8 billion, as reported by Bloomberg in February.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/oneconnect-series-a--0e13284f#section-overview">data</a> from Crunchbase, OneConnect has to date raised $650 million in Series A Early Stage Venture funding, at a pre-money valuation of $6.8 billion.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/ping-ans-blockchain-wing-eying-for-a-new-york-ipo/">earlier reports</a>, OneConnect had provided services to over 200 banks, 200,000 enterprises and 500 banks as of September this year.</p>
      <p>The company launched its blockchain platform in 2018, with solutions focused on finance, real estate, automobile, medical treatment and smart city infrastructure.</p>
      <p>OneConnect claims its blockchain technology can handle up to 50,000 transactions per second with a latency of less than 0.5 seconds and also implements <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/kaleido-blockchain-implements-qedits-zero-knowledge-proof-solution">zero-knowledge proof</a> technology.</p>
      <p>OneConnect’s technology has been <a href="https://www.digfingroup.com/etradeconnect/">used to develop</a> the major blockchain-based <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/hsbc-bnp-paribas-stanchart-others-launch-hong-kong-blockchain-trade-finance-platform">trade finance platform eTradeConnect</a> in partnership with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. </p>
      <p>According to Bloomberg, OneConnect’s IPO filing reveals a reported net loss of $147 million on revenue of $218 million during the nine months ended Sept. 30, as compared with an $82 million net loss on revenue of $128 million for the same period last year</p>
      <h3>The IPO scramble</h3>
      <p>As <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/canaan-creative-sets-terms-plans-to-rake-in-100-million-in-upcoming-us-ipo">reported</a> yesterday, Chinese Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price-index">BTC</a>) mining giant Canaan Creative has just announced the terms for its <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/chinese-cryptocurrency-mining-giant-files-for-400-million-ipo-in-us">U.S. IPO</a>, with plans to raise $100 million by offering 10 million American depositary shares at a price range from $9 to $11. </p>
      <p>This would prospectively put the company’s overall market value at some $1.6 billion, with an enterprise value of $1.4 billion.</p>
      <p>Mining titan Bitmain, which enjoys a 75% market share of the crypto hardware market worldwide, had — like Canaan and OneConnect — initially tried to complete an IPO in <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/hong-kong">Hong Kong</a>, but met with <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitmains-new-ipo-attempt-in-jeopardy-as-in-fighting-goes-public">failure</a>. It has now also <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitmain-quietly-files-for-deutsche-bank-backed-ipo-in-the-us">launched</a> a bid to go public in the U.S.</p>
