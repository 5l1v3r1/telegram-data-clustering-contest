      <p>Armed men have stabbed and injured a Sri Lankan writer in the southern Galle district, a week after he published a book criticising the main opposition candidate in <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/11/sri-lanka-presidential-election-2019-191111123802911.html">Saturday's presidential polls</a>, police said.</p>
      <p>The attackers stormed the home of Lasantha Wijeratne on Thursday, who released his book Wasteful Development and Corruption last week and gave a copy to the ruling party candidate Sajith Premadasa.</p>

      <p>"Four men broke into the house and stabbed him in the arm after holding a pistol to his wife's head," Wijeratne's lawyer Tharaka Nanayakkara told AFP news agency by telephone. "They smashed furniture before escaping."</p>
      <p>Local media published a photo appearing to show Wijeratne in hospital with a bandaged arm, while Sri Lanka's Centre for Monitoring Election Violence (CMEV) said on Twitter that the writer had been injured in the hand.</p>
      <p>Nanayakkara said the attackers accused Wijeratne of harming the campaign of Gotabaya Rajapaksa who is believed to be in a close race with Premadasa for the presidency. </p>

      <p>Gotabaya is the brother of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, during whose decade in power until 2015 at least 14 journalists were killed, according to Reporters Without Borders.</p>
      <p>Police said they have launched an investigation into the incident in the south of the island nation, but were yet to arrest any suspects.</p>
      <p>It came even as Election Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya said the campaign had been relatively peaceful compared with previous polls.</p>
      <p>However, he said the behaviour of both private and state-controlled television networks had been highly biased and he hoped to prosecute offenders after the election.</p>
      <h3>Tense election</h3>
      <p>No media organisation has yet been prosecuted for violating election laws, but last week, Deshapriya banned a state TV network from broadcasting any political content after accusing it of partisan coverage.</p>
      <p>However, the Commission reversed the move the next day following protests that it was not being even-handed with all media outlets violating campaign rules governing broadcasts.</p>
      <p>"The run-up to the election was relatively peaceful, but the campaign in the media is the worst we have ever seen," Deshapriya said.</p>
      <p>Campaign rallies ended on Wednesday night leaving a two-day cooling period before Saturday's poll in which 16 million people are eligible to elect a leader from a record 35 candidates - including two Buddhist monks and just one woman.</p>
      <p>Frontrunners Premadasa and Rajapaksa wrapped up their final rallies amid tight security involving hundreds of elite police and paramilitary units.</p>
      <p>Premadasa, 52, is the son of assassinated President Ranasinghe Premadasa, who was killed in a suicide bombing in 1993 carried out by Tamil separatists, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).</p>
      <p>Gotabya Rajapaksa narrowly escaped a suicide bomb attack in 2006 blamed on the LTTE.</p>
      <p>While ethnic tensions have eased, this year the country was rocked by <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/07/sri-lanka-bombings-top-officials-accused-negligence-bail-190709171841450.html">coordinated bombings</a> on Easter Sunday that killed at least 269 people. </p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/european-union.html">European Union</a> on Wednesday despatched 30 additional election observers around the country, joining 50 who have been in Sri Lanka for a month following the campaign.</p>
