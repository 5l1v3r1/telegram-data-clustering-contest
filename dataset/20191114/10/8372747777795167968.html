      <p>PALM BEACH COUNTY, Fla. -- The South Florida Water Management District will make a decision Thursday about which contractor will work on the <a href="http://www.evergladestrust.org/everglades_eaa_reservoir">Everglades Reservoir Project</a> .</p>
      <p>The contractor will clear vegetation and dig out the rock and mud that is inside the reservoir, which will later hold extra water from Lake Okeechobee during the rainy season.</p>
      <p>By clearing the reservoir now, it will help keep construction on track later.</p>
      <p>This part of the project is expected to cost $1.2 million.</p>
