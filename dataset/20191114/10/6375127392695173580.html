      <h1>Duty Free offers treat to OFW shoppers</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T10:12:54+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 10:12</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://journal.com.ph/authors/cristina-lee-pisco" target="_blank">Cristina Lee-Pisco</a></address>
      <h3>Duty Free Philippines (DFP) shoppers will have the chance to win a brand new car this Christmas.</h3>
      <p>DFP Chief Operating Officer (COO) Vicente Pelagio A. Angala said as a way of giving back to overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) and balikbayans, Duty Free will raffle 2 units of Mitsubishi Xpander, 32 iPad Mini 5, and 10 iPhone XR.</p>
      <p>“Through the years, it’s been a tradition for returning Filipinos to take their families pasalubong shopping at DFP in spite of the sprawling malls rising in Metro Manila and because of their loyalty, this holiday season is the perfect time to reward them by giving them a chance to take home a much-deserved car for their family,” said Angala.</p>
      <p>The promotion will also encourage OFWs to shop at Duty Free Philippines instead of buying their pasalubong abroad.</p>
      <p>“While they could save money by buying at DFP, they could enjoy the fun of shopping with their families. We always promote the importance of family togetherness, keeping family bonds alive and creating new memories by the tradition of the pasalubong shopping with the family at Duty Free Philippines,” he added. </p>
      <p>DFP shoppers buying two Hershey’s pasalubong packs (chocolates sold in bags) at Duty Free Fiestamall or Duty Free Arrival Mall at NAIA Terminal via single or accumulated receipts from December 1-31 are entitled to participate in the “Hershey’s Sweet Holiday Giveaways” and a raffle promo.</p>
