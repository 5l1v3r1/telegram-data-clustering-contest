      <p>Blocking the survival system of cancer cells could tackle melanoma treatment resistance, scientists have said.</p>
      <p>Researchers from the Babraham Institute, AstraZeneca and the Cancer Research UK Cambridge Centre have found a method – used in conjunction with existing treatments – which knocks out one of melanoma cells’ survival pathways.</p>
      <p>They say it is effective at triggering tumour cell death and delaying treatment resistance in the deadliest form of skin cancer.</p>
      <p>The scientists suggest this approach may also help to tackle late stage cancers, even after they have become resistant to existing treatments.</p>
      <blockquote>By targeting both vulnerabilities at the same time we can kill melanoma cells, causing greater inhibition of tumour growth over a longer time period<cite>Dr Mathew Sale</cite></blockquote>
      <p>Lead researcher Dr Mathew Sale, from the Babraham Institute, said: “This study has demonstrated that melanoma cells are addicted to the MCL1 protein for survival, but only when they are treated with the existing melanoma drugs.</p>
      <p>“By targeting both vulnerabilities at the same time we can kill melanoma cells, causing greater inhibition of tumour growth over a longer time period.”</p>
      <p>Cancer cells can rely on various “survival proteins” to stay alive despite the effect of treatment.</p>
      <p>So far researchers have not been able to isolate which of these proteins are used by melanoma cells, but the study published in Nature Communications found that melanoma cells rely on a protein called MCL1.</p>
      <p>This is critical for the cells to survive when exposed to standard drugs that inhibit the MEK and BRAF proteins, such as trametinib or vemurafenib.</p>
      <p>Researchers then studied an investigational compound from pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca, an MCL1 antagonist called AZD5991, and used it in the lab against models of melanoma.</p>
      <p>They showed that by blocking MCL1, the agent inactivated the back-up survival system in melanoma cells.</p>
      <p>Combining it with a treatment like vemurafenib had a double effect against cancer cells, eliminating them more effectively.</p>
      <p>The drug combination also worked by reducing, or sometimes eliminating, melanoma tumours derived from patients and grown in mice.</p>
      <p>Used alone, the agent had no effect in these models.</p>
      <p>Dr Simon Cook, group leader at the Babraham Institute, said: “This study stems from 15 years of basic research in which we have sought to understand the normal signals that control whether a cell lives or dies.</p>
      <p>“However, we became increasingly aware that these same pathways were not functioning correctly in cancer.</p>
      <p>“Thanks to a long-standing partnership with AstraZeneca and the Cancer Research UK Cambridge Centre we were able to translate this basic research to understand and potentially better treat melanoma.”</p>
