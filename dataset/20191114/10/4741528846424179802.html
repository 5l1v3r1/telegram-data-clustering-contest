      <h1>Fast loan: Carbon, Page, Okash, other start-up fintechs wrestle banks </h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T10:04:52+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 10:04</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://nairametrics.com/author/abiola-odutola/" target="_blank">Abiola Odutola</a></address>
      <p>When <b>Partech Africa</b> disclosed in March 2019 in its report that at least 33% of total funding raised by African tech start-ups in 2018 was in the fintech sector, a lot of critics wondered where the funds are meant for.</p>
      <p><b>No doubt</b>, part of the fund must have been invested in their operations including infrastructure development. But some of the financial technology (fintech) startup firms have used their funds to disrupt the lending industry as they are determined to ease the burden of lack of access to fund experienced by several millions of Nigerians.</p>
      <p><b>The good news is that</b> a lot of them offer cheap, affordable loans, which come quite fast as they are disbursed a few minutes after application, without collateral.</p>

      <p><b>These firms have broken the norm</b>, putting the commercial banks on their toes as they offer loans at interest rates as low as between 5% and 12% monthly, depending on the risk involved. Some of them offer loans on USSD platforms.</p>
