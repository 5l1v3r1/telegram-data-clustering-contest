      <p>Chinese phone company Xiaomi also has a range of 'Note' devices and it's most recent version, the Mi Note 10, is on its way.</p>
      <p>It's the world's first smart phone to include Samsung's new 108MP sensor. Making up the rest of the penta camera setup at the rear of the device are 5MP and 12MP telephoto lenses, a 20MP ultra wide-angle sensor and a 2MP sensor for macro photography.</p>
      <p>The cameras also offer up to 50x digital zoom - similar to <a href="https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/04/huawei-p30-pro-the-gizmodo-review/">Huawei's P30 Pro</a> that was released earlier this year.</p>
      <p>At the front of the device you'll find a 32MP selfie camera that has an AI powered portrait mode for night shots.</p>
      <p>As for the other specs you'll find a 6.47-inch AMOLED display with fingerprint scan functionality, a Snapdragon 730G processor, 6GB RAM, 128GB storage and a 5,260mAH battery with 30W fast charge. There's even a headphone jack!</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mi-store.com.au/xiaomi-mi-note-10">You can pre-order the Mi Note 10 now</a> for <b>$888</b> in either aurora green, glacier white or midnight black. It will ship in early December.</p>
      <p>Considering that camera set up and some of those specs, that seems like a damn good price and we can't wait to put it through its paces.</p>
