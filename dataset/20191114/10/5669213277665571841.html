      <h1>Bulk carrier on fire. Update Nov 15.</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T10:32:30+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 10:32</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://maritimebulletin.net/author/ls9iw/" target="_blank">Mikhail Voytenko</a></address>
      <p>Bulk carrier YONG SHUN reported fire on board at 0715 UTC Nov 14 in 10 16N 107 05E some 6 nm south of Vung Tau Vietnam, while en route from Hong Kong to Phu My, Vietnam. As of 1000 UTC the ship is cruising in legs or drifting, with offshore tug HAI DUONG 89 (IMO 9625188) at her side.</p>
      <p>UPDATE 1430 UTC: Fire in cargo hold is reportedly, under control, but not yet extinguished. The ship is loaded with some 5000 tons of scrap originated in China, so most probably, scrap ignited spontaneously, like it was in a number of similar accidents in Japan. 18 crew reported safe.</p>
      <p>UPDATE 0500 UTC Nov 15: As of 0300 UTC, fire in Hold 3 was still on, though under control. Coast Guard ship joined rescue operation, dosing bulker with water from her cannons. 18 crew reported safe and uninjured.</p>
      <p>Bulk carrier YONG SHUN, IMO 8748397, dwt 15000, built 2009, flag Sierra Leone, manager CHENG TAI INT’L SHIPPING CO LT, HK.</p>
