        <b>Fred has credited Ole Gunnar Solskjaer with his improved form at Manchester United as he can feel his “trust”.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Following United’s 3-1 victory over Brighton at the weekend, <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/solskjaer-raves-over-man-utd-man-who-was-catalyst-for-defeat-of-brighton"><b>Solskjaer lauded Fred‘s contribution</b></a>, insisting he was central to stopping the Seagulls from getting into the contest.</p>
      <p>The Brazilian was recruited in a £52million deal from Shakhtar Donetsk but, having initially struggled to adapt to English football, there are now signs that he has turned a corner.</p>
      <p>And <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/tag/fred"><b>Fred</b></a> told <i>The</i> <i>Athletic:</i> “The trust from the manager is important and I feel I have this.</p>
      <p>“I just want to continue doing what I’m doing, playing well and starting the games — but I want to score, too. I came close [against Brighton] and hit the bar but I’ll keep working until this happens.</p>
      <p>“I’m very happy, firstly because we won but also because we’re getting some rhythm and we’re doing well in the cups.</p>
      <p>“But we needed to do better in the league. We just have to carry on fighting so that we reach the Champions League.</p>
      <p>“I’m feeling better than I’ve ever felt since moving to England. All I ever wanted was to play regularly and now that I’m doing that, there’s no doubt my confidence is higher and that helps any player.”</p>
