      <p>ATLANTA -- Jimmy Carter's pastor says the former president is already "up and walking" just a day after undergoing surgery to relieve pressure on his brain from bleeding linked to recent falls.</p>
      <p>The Rev. Tony Lowden of Maranatha Baptist Church visited Carter in an Atlanta hospital Wednesday and told reporters that the 95-year-old was in good spirits. Carter Center spokeswoman Deanna Congileo has said there were no complications during Carter's Tuesday surgery at Emory University Hospital for a subdural hematoma, blood trapped on the brain's surface.</p>
      <p>She said he would remain hospitalized under observation. It's unclear when he'll be released.</p>
      <p>The centre said the bleeding was connected to Carter's recent falls. A Spring fall required Carter to get hip replacement surgery. He fell twice in October, hitting his head at least once.</p>
