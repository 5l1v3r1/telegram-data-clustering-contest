      <p>WESTPORT native Gena Heraty has been announced as a finalist for the Irish Red Cross Humanitarian Awards, along with Vivien Lusted and Sr. Stan.</p>
      <p>Gena is being honoured for her work in Haiti over many years.</p>
      <p>The winner will be announced at the Irish Red Cross Humanitarian Awards ball which takes place this Saturday, November 16, in the Ballsbridge Hotel, Dublin 4.</p>
      <p>There are six categories of award being presented on the night - Humanitarian of the Year, Young Humanitarian Award, Journalism Excellence, Innovation for Change, Corporate Impact and the Lifetime Achievement Award.</p>
      <p>Humanitarian of the Year finalist Gena arrived in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, in 1993 and almost three decades later is known all over Haiti for challenging prejudice against people with physical and intellectual disabilities.</p>
      <p>Gena is the coordinator of the special needs programme with Nos Petits Freres et Soeurs (NPFS), a home for orphaned and abandoned children. Her team has developed an outreach programme which provides education for over 100 school children with neurological disorders while approximately 80 patients a day (or 30,000 a year) receive physical therapy treatments.</p>
      <p>Gena is the co-founder of the Kay Christine home for children with special needs at NPFS which has created services to ensure children with special needs are not abandoned.</p>
      <p>Conditions are challenging, and Gena has faced a vicious attack by armed men, where one of her colleagues was killed.</p>
      <p>Finalist Sister Stanislaus Kennedy is an Irish Sister of Charity who has been on the frontline of social innovation for almost 60 years.</p>
      <p>Galway nurse Vivien Lusted has worked for the Irish Red Cross for over 14 years on overseas missions in some of the worldâ€™s toughest armed conflicts, including Iraq, Israel, Sudan, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Somalia, Zimbabwe, Nigeria and Myanmar.</p>
      <p>The awards seek to recognise those who have had a humanitarian impact on the lives of others through volunteering, skill sharing, storytelling or fundraising and will highlight the efforts of those who have given a voice to humanitarian issues.</p>
