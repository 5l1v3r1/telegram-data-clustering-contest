      <p>On the NSE, the broader Nifty50 index ended at 11,870, up 30 points or 0.25 per cent.</p>
      <p>Sectorally, metal stocks cracked the most with the Nifty Metal index closing around 2 per cent lower at 2,508 levels. On the flip side, financial services stocks rallied the most. Nifty Bank gained over 0.7 per cent to settle at 30,764 levels.</p>
      <p>Volatility index India VIX slipped around 6 per cent to 15.50 levels.</p>
      <p>In other market statistics, market breadth was in favour of declines as out of 2,682 companies traded on the BSE, 1,507 advanced and 1,004 declined while 171 remained unchanged. As many as 54 securities hit their 52-week high on the BSE while 154 hit their one-year low.</p>
