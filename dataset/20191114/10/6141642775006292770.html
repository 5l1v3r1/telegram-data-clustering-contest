      <p>The NHS is heading for one of its “bleakest” ever winters, and 100,000 people could end up stuck on trolleys waiting for hospital beds, experts have said.</p>
      <p>New figures from NHS England show that A&amp;E performance is at its worst-ever level while the health service has also missed a raft of other targets, including how long people wait to start planned treatment and waits for cancer care.</p>
      <p>The data comes as the Royal College of Surgeons called on political leaders to keep the 18-week wait for planned treatment – which is currently under review and could be scrapped.</p>

      <p>Some 83.6% of patients arriving at A&amp;E were treated or admitted in four hours.</p>
      <p>The target is 95% but it has not been met since July 2015.</p>
      <p>The data also showed that in September, 84.8% of patients started treatment within 18 weeks against a target of 92% – a continued decline in performance.</p>
      <p>The target was last met in February 2016.</p>
      <p>The target to start cancer treatment within 62 days of an urgent referral is also being missed. Some 76.9% of cancer patients started treatment in 62 days in September, below the 85% target.</p>
      <p>Overall, more than 4.4 million patients are on the waiting list.</p>
      <p>Nuffield Trust chief economist, Professor John Appleby, said: “These figures show the next government will immediately be faced with one of the bleakest winters in the NHS’s history.”</p>

      <p>“The health service is seeing far more patients, yet one in six is now waiting more than four hours in A&amp;E. If the usual trends continue after Christmas, that would head towards one in five.</p>
      <p>“Meanwhile the number of people waiting on trolleys in corridors because no beds are available has already hit 80,000 – something we have only seen before in the very coldest part of the year.</p>
      <p>“If this trend keeps going, I fear we could see 100,000 people stuck on trolleys this coming January.</p>
      <p>“As the election promises roll in, we should be under no illusion about the money, staff and time it will take to turn this situation around.”</p>

      <p>Shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, said: “Under Boris Johnson the NHS is in crisis and we’re heading for a winter of abject misery for patients.</p>
      <p>“Our A&amp;Es are overwhelmed, more so than ever. In every community there’s an ever growing queue of people waiting for treatment.”</p>
      <p>Liberal Democrat health spokeswoman, Luciana Berger, said: “This is a damning indictment of the Conservatives’ dismal record on the NHS.”</p>
      <p>An NHS spokesman said: “These figures show that while NHS staff are looking after a markedly higher number of older and sicker patients, a higher number of patients are being seen quickly than a year ago.”</p>
      <p>Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: “These figures show just how important it is that we stop Jeremy Corbyn.</p>
      <p>“We are giving the biggest cash boost ever to our NHS, but Corbyn’s chaotic policies will put that at risk.”</p>
      <p>In March, NHS England announced proposals to scrap the key targets for patients to be seen in A&amp;E within four hours, or to receive an operation within 18 weeks.</p>

      <p>Data would be published on how long patients spend on average in A&amp;E and the 18-week target would be replaced by an average marker of the time it takes to start treatment.</p>
      <p>The Royal College of Surgeons and the charity Versus Arthritis called on party leaders to safeguard the 18-week target.</p>
      <p>Writing to all party leaders, Professor Derek Alderson, president of the Royal College of Surgeons and Liam O’Toole, chief executive of Versus Arthritis, said: “Despite being a statutory requirement, the 18-week standard has increasingly been forgotten.”</p>
      <p>Prof Alderson added: “It just isn’t acceptable for so many people to languish on these lists, with deteriorating physical and mental health as they wait for treatment.”</p>
      <p>The Society for Acute Medicine said acute and emergency care in the NHS is “imploding” before the expected winter crisis hits.</p>
