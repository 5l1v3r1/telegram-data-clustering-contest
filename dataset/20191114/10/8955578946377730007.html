      <p><b>TOMSK, Nov 14 – RIA Tomsk.</b> International Scientific and Practical Conference "Intellectual Rights: Challenges of the XXI Century" will be opened on Wednesday in the <a href="http://en.tsu.ru/">Tomsk State University</a> (TSU); its participants will be teachers of Russian and foreign universities and representatives of legal business, the organizer of the conference Azat Antonyan told RIA Tomsk.</p>

The conference is organized by the Scientific and Educational Center "Intellectual Property and Intellectual Rights", which director is Azat Antonyan.</p>
      <blockquote>"Recently, the main assets of people, companies and even states with the development of technology are moving from the world of things to the world of intangible values. The largest company by capitalization in the world, Apple, has the main intellectual assets. In this new world, it is intellectual rights that need legal protection", – Antonyan says.</blockquote>
      <p>According to him, the main events will take place on November 14-17 in the 31 building of TSU on the Embankment of Ushayka, 12. The Conference is designed mainly for legal professionals and legal advisers.</p>
      <p>According to the materials of the conference, it will be attended by both Russian lawyers and teachers, as well as representatives of legal companies of the near abroad and the British legal community. Participants plan to discuss current jurisprudence in the field of registration of inventions in pharmaceuticals, Russian patent practice, issues of application of copyright and related rights, as well as problems of use of trademarks in detail.</p>
      <p>"Relatively recently – in October 2019, amendments to the Civil Code entered into force, which enshrined the concept of "smart contracts" and digital rights. These issues need deep professional discussion, the third day of the conference will be almost completely devoted to them", – Antonyan said.</p>
