      <p>The number of homes being repossessed has jumped compared with a year ago, figures show.</p>
      <p>Across the UK, 1,330 properties mortgaged by homeowners were repossessed in the third quarter of this year – up by nearly a fifth (19%) on the previous year.</p>
      <p>There was also an uplift in the number of landlords having their properties repossessed.</p>
      <p>Some 800 buy-to-let mortgaged properties were repossessed in the third quarter – a 40% increase on the same period of 2018.</p>
      <p>Trade association UK Finance, which released the figures, said the increase was partly driven by a backlog of older cases being processed in line with regulatory requirements.</p>
      <p>It said repossessions remain well below levels seen between 2009 and 2014.</p>

      <p>Low mortgage rates have been helping to keep borrowers’ repayments relatively affordable.</p>
      <p>Toughened mortgage lending rules were also introduced following the economic downturn to make sure borrowers can only take out loans they can afford to pay back.</p>
      <p>The UK Finance report said: “Lenders continue to show flexibility to borrowers in financial difficulty and possession is always a last resort.”</p>
      <p>The figures also show fewer homeowners and landlords were in arrears with their mortgage in the third quarter compared with a year earlier.</p>
      <p>There were also shrinking numbers of borrowers in the worst arrears band – made up of those who owe the equivalent of 10% or more of the outstanding balance on their mortgage.</p>
      <p>The report continued: “The proportion of homeowner mortgages in arrears remains at historically low levels, with the vast majority of borrowers continuing to repay their mortgages in full and on time each month.”</p>
