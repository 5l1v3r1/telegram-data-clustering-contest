      <h1>Google Search will correct your pronunciation of words</h1>

      <p>Google Search has a lot of neat features outside of providing results for keyword searches. For instance, try searching for “Solitaire” or a flight number.</p>
      <p>Google today announced a new feature which will help you learn to pronounce English words. If you search for “How to pronounce isthmus”, for example, a card will show up with the syllables spelled out, playable audio of the word being pronounced and an animation of mouth movements to produce the sound.</p>
      <p>The updated card will let you speak into your microphone to receive feedback on adjusting your pronunciation of a word. At first this feature will only work with American English, but Spanish is apparently soon to follow, and hopefully other languages and dialects after that.</p>
      <p>Google uses speech recognition technology to separate your speech into individual syllables, then cross reference your audio against the pronunciation it expects.</p>
      <p>Searching for definitions of words will also bring up images of what the word can mean to better explain a definition or provide context to different uses of the word. Only nouns are supported right now, but an expanded list of words is in the works.</p>
