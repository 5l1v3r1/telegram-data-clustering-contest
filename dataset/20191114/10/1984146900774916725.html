      <p>There are now just days to go until the start of the new series of I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out of Here and two new stars are being heavily tipped to go into the jungle.</p>
      <p>From soap stars to sports stars, a whole host of different celebrities had seen their names linked with a stint on <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity</a> , all hoping to follow in the footsteps of 2018 winner Harry Redknapp.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/tv/im-a-celebrity-lineup-confirmed-16118148">confirmed I'm A Celebrity lineup</a> for this year was revealed last week but while it was believed to be the full list, insiders are now linking two other famous faces with the show.</p>
      <p>And one of them saw his name heavily linked with a place on the original lineup.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/im-a-celebrity/10341585/coronation-street-andrew-whyment-im-a-celebrity/">The Sun</a> claim that after being a shock absentee from the confirmed lineup, Coronation Street actor Andrew Whyment will in fact be going into the jungle, along with another mystery star, taking the total number of celeb camp mates up to 12.</p>
      <p>When the actor, better known to millions as Kirk Sutherland, was first linked with I'm A Celeb, a source told the paper "They were chuffed to get Andrew as viewers have watched him on for the best part of two decades, yet know nothing about him away from Kirk.”</p>
      <p>And 38-year-old Andrew and whoever joins him in the jungle could fare rather well, remember when late arrival Vicky Pattison went on to win the show in 2015?</p>
      <p>
        <b>I'm A Celebrity starts on ITV on Sunday night at 9pm.</b>
