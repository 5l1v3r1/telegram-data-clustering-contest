      <h2>A baggage handler has explained the common mistake passengers make thinking it will protect their luggage when it could actually be putting it at risk of theft</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T10:21:35+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 10:21</time> by <a rel="author">Julie Delahaye, https://www.facebook.com/juliedjourno</a></address>
      <p>With <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/travel/news/airlines-hand-luggage-rules-2019-17385494">airline hand luggage rules</a> become increasingly strict, checked luggage is fast becoming the answer for holidaymakers who can't fit a week's worth of items into a handbag (aka, most of us).</p>
      <p>However, there can be something uneasy about your packed suitcase being sent into the deep dark depths of the airport once check-in is done, and not seeing your bags for hours.</p>
      <p>Then of course there are added worries such as lost or damaged bags, or even worse, missing items.</p>
      <p>Some passengers choose to lock their bags for peace of mind by clipping a padlock to the zip, but one baggage handler has revealed this could actually flag your bag as one to have a look through.</p>

      <p>On a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1or6ow/people_who_work_for_airlines_what_are_secrets/">Reddit forum</a> where airline workers were asked to share their secrets, one employee revealed that a padlock on a suitcase can actually suggest that it's worth opening up for a look.</p>
      <p>They wrote: "It's literally not even a deterrent. Some might take it as a sign that the bag is worth searching."</p>
      <p>Other members of the forum agreed, with another user adding: "Locks on zippered bags are useless. You can pop a zipper with a pen and drag the locked zipper pulls around the bag to close them back up.</p>
      <p>"I've done this many times to identify bags that are tagless and locked."</p>

      <p>If you are worried about your belongings, there are plenty of ways to keep your items safe.</p>
      <p>For a start, keep any valuable or sentimental items with you in your hand luggage; that way if your bag does go missing or turns up opened on the carousel, it will be frustrating but it might help ease some of the stress.</p>
      <p>Nowadays you can also buy suitcases with padlocks built in for the zips, which can only be released if you know the four-number code.</p>
