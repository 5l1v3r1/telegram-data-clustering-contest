      <p><b>News</b> by Imogen Beckhelling, Reporter Intern Updated on 14 November 2019</p>
      <p>The Bleeding Edge store page has gone live ahead of this evening's X019 stream, revealing the release date of Ninja Theory's upcoming online brawler.</p>
      <p>The colourful four-versus-four class-based game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-06-11-bleeding-edge-is-a-bit-of-a-misnomer-but-ninja-theory-are-rightfully-bullish">was announced at E3</a>, and had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-10-22-ninja-theory-opening-bleeding-edge-technical-alpha-to-pc-players-this-week">technical alphas earlier this year</a>. Aside from these, the developer has been pretty quiet about it all, until now.</p>
      <p>Bleeding Edge arrives on 24th March, and those who pre-order it on Xbox Game Pass will get access to a closed beta - the first starting on 14th February, and the second starting on 13th March.</p>

      <p>According to the store page, anyone who pre-orders the game or plays it in the first week of launch (before 31st March 2020) will get an exclusive "Punk Pack", containing three fighter skins and bonus taunts, an in-game sticker pack, and a hoverboard for the character Rioter.</p>
      <p>Microsoft seems to have removed the release date and pre-order info from the store page now, but fortunately, we managed to grab a screenshot.</p>

      <p>This seems to be one of the first of the reveals for X019, so stick with us a bit later on to see what else Xbox's event has in store.</p>
