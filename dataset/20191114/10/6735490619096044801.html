      <p>Ellie Goulding is following through with her Thanksgiving Day performance.</p>
      <p>Goulding is scheduled to perform at the Dallas Cowboys vs. Buffalo Bills game on Nov. 28. The game coincides with U.S. Thanksgiving Day and kicks off the Salvation Army Red Kettle campaign.</p>
      <p>The “Hate Me” singer had threatened to pull out of the gig after fans informed her of Salvation Army’s anti-LGBTQ stance.</p>

      <p>“Upon researching this, I have reached out to The Salvation Army and said that I would have no choice but to pull out unless they very quickly make a solid, committed pledge or donation to the LGBTQ community,” she wrote, via <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/arts-entertainment/music/2019/11/12/ellie-goulding-threatens-to-cancel-performance-during-cowboys-thanksgiving-halftime-show/">the Dallas Morning News</a>.</p>
      <p>“I am a committed philanthropist as you probably know, and my heart has always been in helping the homeless, but supporting an anti-LGBTQ charity is clearly not something I would ever intentionally do,” Goulding continued. “Thank you for drawing my attention to this.”</p>
      <p>National commander of the Salvation Army David Hudson told <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/ellie-goulding-salvation-army-charity-lgbtq-issues"><i>Fox News</i></a> on Thursday that Goulding will indeed perform.</p>

      <p>“We’d like to thank Ellie Goulding and her fans for shedding light on misconceptions and encouraging others to learn the truth about The Salvation Army’s mission to serve all, without discrimination,” the statement reads.</p>
      <p>“We applaud her for taking the time to learn about the services we provide to the LGBTQ community,” Hudson continued. “Regardless of race, ethnicity, sexual orientation or gender identity, we’re committed to serving anyone in need.”</p>
      <p>Goulding, 32, has yet to publicly address the Salvation Army’s statement.</p>
