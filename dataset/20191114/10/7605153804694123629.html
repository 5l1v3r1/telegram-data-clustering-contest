        <b>NAIROBI, Kenya, Nov 14 – At least 20 countries including the United States have reaffirmed their stance on </b>
        <b>abortion, rejecting its use as family planning method.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Speaking during a conference on Thursday the United States International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD25) Head of Delegation Valerie Huber stated there is no international right to abortion and terms which may promote pro-abortion policies and measures should not be used.</p>
      <p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
      <p>“The United Nations should only focus on concrete efforts that enjoy broad consensus among member of States,” she said.</p>
      <p>The news conference was attended by delegates from Bahrain, Belarus, Brazil, Democratic Republic of Congo, Egypt, Guatemala, Haiti, Hungary, Iraq, Libya, Mali, Nigeria, Poland, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Uganda, Arab Emirates and Yemen.</p>
      <p>Huber pointed out only documents that have been adopted by all Member States should be cited in UN resolutions.</p>
      <p>She further stated the US does not support references to ambiguous terms and expressions, such as sexual and reproductive health and rights in UN documents.</p>
      <p>The Head of Delegation noted ambiguous terms can undermine the critical role of the family and promote practices like abortion, in circumstances that do not enjoy international consensus, and which can be misinterpreted by UN agencies.</p>
      <p>“We therefore urge Member States to join us in focusing on the important work of expanding health and opportunities for all people, and especially those in situations of risk and/or vulnerability,” she outlined in a position backed the 19 other delegate who graced the news conference.</p>
      <p>The delegates pointed out the agreement made in Cairo 1994 during ICPD summit should be maintained.</p>
      <p>They however acknowledged the role of the United Nations and Member States on the significant work done on the Universal Health Coverage Political Declaration, and for the high priority placed on expanding access to health care.</p>
      <p>We therefore urge Member States to join us in focusing on the important work of expanding health and opportunities for all people, and especially those in situations of risk and/or vulnerability, Huber said.</p>
      <p>The delegates then expressed their support for equal access to health care, which includes, but is not limited to reproductive concerns, maternal health, voluntary and informed family planning, HIV, elimination of violence against women and girls, and empowerment of women and girls to reach the highest standard of health.</p>
      <p>The ICPD 25 Summit took an integrated approach, covering five themes and highlighting the power of gender equality, youth leadership, political and community leadership, innovation and data, and partnerships to accelerate progress throughout.</p>
      <p>Universal access to sexual and reproductive health and rights as a part of universal health coverage was among the issues highlighted.</p>
      <p>The reproductive health agenda was heavily criticized by a section of civil society over concerns that policies to promote abortion would be endorsed.</p>
      <p>The summit’s core agenda was to reenergize the global community to sustain and amplify gains made since the 1994 Cairo meeting.</p>
