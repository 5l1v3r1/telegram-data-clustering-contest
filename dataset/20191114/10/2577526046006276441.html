      <h1>The Uncharted Movie Has Been in Development Hell for So Long That Mark Wahlberg, Once Cast as Nathan Drake, is Now Playing Sully Instead</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T10:00:59+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 10:00</time> by <a rel="author">Luke Plunkett</a></address>
      <p>Sony has been trying to get an <i>Uncharted </i>movie made for over a decade now, and while the latest attempt to get Nathan Drake’s story on the big screen – starring <i>Spider-Man’s</i> Tom Holland – sounds like it might actually get made, the addition of Mark Wahlberg to the cast this week is a reminder of just how deep in development hell this project has been.</p>
      <p>You might not remember, but this isn’t the first time Mark Wahlberg has been attached to the movie. <a href="https://kotaku.com/mark-wahlberg-will-be-nathan-drake-deniro-could-be-dra-5698269">In 2010 he signed on to <i>star </i>in the film as Nathan Drake</a>, with Robert DeNiro to play his father and Joe Pesci his uncle. A year later, <a href="https://kotaku.com/report-mark-wahlberg-wont-be-in-uncharted-flick-5806700">both he and director David O’Russell were gone</a>.</p>
      <p>Now, <a href="https://variety.com/2019/film/news/mark-wahlberg-tom-holland-uncharted-movie-sony-1203394336/">as <i>Variety </i>reports</a>, he’s back! Only this time as part of director Travis Knight’s (<i>Bumblebee</i>) version, and rather than playing Drake, he’ll be co-starring as Sully.</p>
      <p>A movie being in development so long that your star goes from playing Drake to Sully? Yikes.</p>
