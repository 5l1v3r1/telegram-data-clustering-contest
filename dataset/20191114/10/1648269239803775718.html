      <h1>Motor1.com's Best Renderings Of The Week</h1>
      <h2>Celebrating the talent of independent automotive designers.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T10:02:47+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 10:02</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.motor1.com/info/team/anthony-karr/" target="_blank">Anthony Karr</a></address>
      <p>Every week we publish a lot of <a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/category/renderings/">renderings</a>. While some of them preview actual new models coming in the next few months, others are mostly done for fun. Those imagine super futuristic creations that are likely not going to hit the production lines anytime soon, if ever at all.</p>
      <p>Here at <i>Motor1.com</i>, we all love virtual drawings and that’s why we figured we’d share one extra rendering article every week. It combines all the design exercises our own artists create, as well as images provided by independent automotive designers, students, and just regular gearheads.</p>
      <p>We’ll update this article with the new renderings from the last week every Thursday. Thus, you’ll have all cool digital interpretations handy when you want to take a brief look into the future.</p>

      <h4>New Fiat Punto</h4>
      <p>With FCA and PSA now in a <a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/379538/psa-fca-merger-plan-announced/">50:50 merger</a>, it shouldn’t come as a surprise if Fiat receives the most recent architecture of Peugeot. If that happens, we could see the return of the Punto – and this rendering previews a possible design for the subcompact hatch.</p>

      <p>We know for a fact a new Octavia RS is coming next year – and this rendering provides a good look at its possible look. Don’t expect anything super dramatic but the usual larger wheels, added diffusers, and lower suspension.</p>

      <p>Ford will unveil a <a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/382153/ford-mustang-mach-e-ev-crossover-name/">high-riding, all-electric vehicle</a> inspired by the Mustang – and it won’t just feature a Mustang-inspired styling, it’ll also wear the famed sports car’s name. Hours before the debut, this is what the production EV could look like.</p>

      <h4>Porsche 993 modernized</h4>
      <p>This project reimagines the 993 with a widebody kit and smoother lines. The vehicle carries the same basic idea as the original but brings new and softer shapes and surfaces to the execution.</p>

      <h4>Widebody Toyota Supra</h4>
      <p>Clearly inspired by the concepts seen at this year’s SEAM show, this rendering proposes a wild-looking Supra with an aggressive widebody kit. Our favorite touch are the gills integrated into the rear bumper, right behind the wheels.</p>

      <p>Genesis is set to finally join the SUV segment later this year with the launch of the GV80. Next year, it will be joined by this – the <a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/376415/genesis-gv70-spy-photos/">GV70</a>, based on the G70 sedan. Powerful turbocharged units should be under the hood, even in the base trims.</p>

      <p>Spy photos showing camouflaged prototypes confirmed the updated <a href="https://www.motor1.com/jaguar/f-type/">F-Type</a> will get a revised front fascia with sleeker headlights and a larger central grille. Hopefully, the sports car will eventually transform into a mid-engine supercar and we might have an idea of what it could look like. Expect something hot soon.</p>

      <p>March 2020 will be very important for <a href="https://www.motor1.com/maserati/">Maserati</a>. That’s when the Italian brand will launch its new supercar with a design inspired by the Alfieri concept from 2014. If that’s indeed what the road-going model will look like, things are looking quite promising already.</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://www.motor1.com/volkswagen/jetta/">Jetta</a> is no longer available on the European market and this rendering proposes what a resurrected version of the sedan could look like. It’s definitely not a looker but the overall proportions are spot on.</p>

      <p>We know for a fact a new <a href="https://www.motor1.com/volkswagen/golf-gti/">Golf GTI</a> will debut next year.

      <h4>BMW M8 Wagon</h4>
      <p>Here at <i>Motor1.com</i>, we love <a href="https://www.motor1.com/body-styles/wagon/">wagons</a> – we love them small, big, cheap, expensive, powerful, slow, fast… all kinds of long-roofs are welcomed. And we believe there’s nothing cooler than a V8 wagon and room for the whole family. Here’s one good option</p>

      <h4>Modernized Chrysler Crossfire</h4>
      <p>This week’s dose of <a href="https://www.motor1.com/tag/thesketchmonkey/">modernized classics</a> includes this modern-day Chrysler Crossfire. It gets a more restrained but more stylish exterior design, in the same vein as the previously modified <a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/374560/lambo-countach-reimagined-rendering/">Lamborghini Countach</a>.</p>

      <h4>Ram mid-size truck</h4>
      <p>Remember the Dodge Dakota? It literally created the mid-size <a href="https://www.motor1.com/body-styles/truck/">truck</a> segment back in the late-1980s and was a strong seller through the 1990s. Now imagine that <a href="https://www.motor1.com/ram/">Ram</a> decides to resurrect the model – it could very well end up looking like this rendering.</p>

      <h4>FCA-Renault merger mashups</h4>
      <p>The potential 50:50 merger between Renault and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles collapsed due to the “<a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/353223/fca-drops-renault-merger/">political conditions</a>” in France. That was more than enough for our friends at <i>Budget Direct</i> to create a series of interesting renderings, depicting various mashup projects created in cooperation between the two companies.</p>

      <h4>BMW M8 Gran Coupe</h4>
      <p>Let’s do some math exercises. Combine BMW’s 4.4-liter twin-turbo V8 from the M5 with the looks of the 8 Series Gran Coupe. The result is the car you see here. It’s not real yet but it’s probably pretty close to the actual performance sedan we are about to see later this year.</p>

      <h4>1989 Jeep Cherokee Trackhawk</h4>
      <p>Let’s go back in time, again. This time around, however, Abimelec Design imagines a retro-styled Cherokee with a <a href="https://www.motor1.com/jeep/grand-cherokee-trackhawk/">Trackhawk</a> treatment – and it looks awesome. The old-school wheels paired with stereotypical automotive graphics from the period match perfectly the idea of a classic performance SUV.</p>

      <h4>Aston Martin Valhalla Volante</h4>
      <p>Nikita Aksyonov helps us imagine what an open-top <a href="https://www.motor1.com/aston-martin/valhalla/">Valhalla</a> could look like. And, honestly, the hypercar looks like it was always meant to be convertible. Beautiful proportions and striking roofline make it one of the best looking hyper-cabrios. Hopefully, it will happen in the real world.</p>

      <h4>BMW X6</h4>
      <p>We know a new <a href="https://www.motor1.com/bmw/x6/">X6</a> is in the cards for a launch this year. It’s not that difficult to predict the design of the coupe-SUV mashup and this rendering gives a pretty accurate preview of what to expect. It’s not just an X5 with a sloped roofline though.</p>

      <p>Another new <a href="https://www.motor1.com/bmw/">BMW</a> but this time it’s a hot hatch. This rendering is replacing the camouflage of test prototypes with production clothes. A few things don’t look particularly great, like the slightly miss proportioned kidney grille, but it’s a good effort in general.</p>
