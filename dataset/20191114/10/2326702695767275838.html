      <p>All going well, 2020 is shaping up to be a pretty exciting year as a new player officially enters the arena of graphics card manufacturing. Well, yes, <a href="https://www.eteknix.com/category/intel">Intel</a> isn’t technically new. It has, however, been a <i>very</i> long time since they expressed any significant interest in the <a href="https://www.eteknix.com/category/graphics-card">GPU</a> market. Albeit, that can differ slightly if you take the more commercial releases into consideration.</p>
      <p>With their upcoming releases expected to be based on a 7nm design <i>and</i> featuring hardware dedicated <a href="https://www.eteknix.com/category/ray-tracing">ray tracing</a>, however, it seems that Intel is planning on coming out swinging big time by essentially picking off some of the biggest selling points that both <a href="https://www.eteknix.com/category/amd">AMD</a> and <a href="https://www.eteknix.com/category/nvidia">Nvidia</a> have, but not together! Well, at least not yet.</p>

      <h3>Intel Reveals the Code Name for An Upcoming 7nm Xe Graphics Card</h3>
      <p>While Intel is currently keeping somewhat quiet as to the details of their upcoming ‘Xe’ graphics card range, they have decided to at least reveal one little nugget of information.</p>
      <p>In a report <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/intels-first-xe-graphics-processor-is-called-ponte-vecchio">via Videocardz</a>, at least one of the upcoming releases has the code name ‘Ponte Vecchio’. Seemingly named after a well-known landmark in Italy, however, having the rather less exciting English translation of ‘Old Bridge’.</p>
      <p>What exactly is Ponte Vecchio, though?</p>

      <h3>What Will This Represent?</h3>
      <p>The naming specifically refers to Intel’s CXL (Compute Express Link) technology, which in itself (in very basic terms) is a system of interconnecting GPUs.</p>
      <p>The bottom line is, Ponte Vecchio is not going to be a gaming graphics card. It is, instead, likely being designed for use in <i>extreme</i> high-end systems. In other words, think within the realms of ‘supercomputers’.</p>
      <p>With Ponte Vecchio not expected until 2021, it is perhaps somewhat curious that Intel has been willing to share details on this design while still keeping relatively tight-lipped about their desktop releases which are (all going well) expected next year.</p>
      <p>It does, however, prove that if nothing else, Intel is taking this dip into the GPU market <i>very</i> seriously!</p>
      <p>What do you think? Are you excited by the Intel graphics card releases? Do you think they have the potential to beat both AMD and Nvidia? – Let us know in the comments!</p>
