      <h1>Netflix Has Acquired the Rights to Beverly Hills Cop 4 with Eddie Murphy</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T10:00:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 10:00</time> by <a rel="author">Jim Vorel  </a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/tag/Eddie+Murphy">Eddie Murphy</a> revival continues gathering strength, as Netflix has made a big-money play to <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/beverly-hills-cop-sequel-netflix-eddie-murphy-jerry-bruckheimer-paramount-license-deal-1202785458/">acquire the planned <i>Beverly Hills Cop 4</i></a> from Paramount. The studio had been working on developing the film for several years, but the film will now be produced by <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/tag/Netflix">Netflix</a> (under producer Jerry Bruckheimer), with an option for a sequel. It also deepens the burgeoning relationship between the world’s biggest streamer and star Murphy, who just appeared in the critically acclaimed <i>Dolemite is My Name</i> as Rudy Ray Moore, earning himself unexpected awards buzz in the process. Likewise, <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/tag/Netflix">Netflix</a> is still in the process of offering the former stand-up star <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2019/07/what-if-netflix-paid-eddie-murphy-90-million-inste.html">an insane amount of money</a> to return to the stand-up stage for a live special. One would think that making <i>Beverly Hills Cop 4</i> would make the stand-up return even more likely.</p>
      <p>The original <i>Beverly Hills Cop</i>, directed by Martin Brest, was a smash hit in 1984 and introduced the world to one of Murphy’s most iconic characters, street-wise <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/tag/Detroit">Detroit</a> cop Axel Foley, who travels to Beverly Hills to investigate the murder of a friend. Subsequent sequels fell victim to diminishing returns quite quickly, as 1987’s <i>Beverly Hills Copy 2</i> received a mixed reaction, and John Landis’ third installment in 1994 was utterly savaged by critics and audiences alike. It does make one wonder how much nostalgic value <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/tag/Netflix">Netflix</a> believes exists in this IP, especially in a film landscape where even well-received franchise films like <i>Terminator: Dark Fate</i> are opening to dismal box office numbers. For what it’s worth, the original <i>Beverly Hills Cop</i> was released the same year as the original <i>Terminator</i>—you have to wonder which IP still has more juice.</p>
      <p>Paramount, meanwhile, is still reportedly working on developing a sequel to another one of Murphy’s most beloved characters, Prince Akeem, in a long-planned <i>Coming to America</i> sequel. Murphy, in the process, seems to be going full Stallone on us, seeking to deliver late-career sequels to all of his most famous franchises.</p>
      <p><i>Beverly Hills Cop</i> had long been intended to become a TV series with Murphy, but production never quite got underway. Let’s hope <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/tag/Netflix">Netflix</a> finds a bit more success in resurrecting the 1980s classic.</p>
