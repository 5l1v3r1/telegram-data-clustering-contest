      <h3>LETRAN hopes to put a storybook ending to another improbable campaign as it tries to bury mighty San Beda six feet under today in the NCAA men’s basketball championship at the Mall of Asia Arena.</h3>
      <p>History is on the Knights’ side, as the previous 13 champions all won Game 1 of the Finals.</p>
      <p>Coach Bonnie Tan is looking forward to give Letran its 18th crown in Game 2 slated at 4 p.m.</p>
      <p>“Although we have the momentum by winning Game 1, sana hindi na ito pakawalan ng mga players,” said Tan.</p>
      <p>The Knights ended the Red Lions’ remarkable 32-game winning streak with a series-opening 65-64 win last Friday.</p>
      <p>Letran is determined to regain the crown it last won in 2015, while ending its bitter rivals’ amazing title run.</p>
      <p>San Beda is in danger of becoming the second team after 2017 Lyceum of the Philippines squad  failed to clinch the throne after completing an 18-0 elimination round sweep.</p>
      <p>“Before the Finals, I told my players to play for the alma mater. Play for the school. Lahat tayo sama-sama dito. Kung ganyan ang ilalaro nila, siyempre ilalabas ang pride nila,” said Tan.</p>
      <p>The Knights have won five Finals games against the Lions this decade.</p>
      <p>Tan is bracing for a big San Beda fightback to send the series to a decider on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>“They are the defending champions. They are the three-time champions. They have the experience,” said Tan. “As a coach, kailangang mag-adjust kung ano man ang mangyayari.”</p>
      <p>Fran Yu was scintillating since the step-ladder semifinals, carrying Letran this far in the season, while Jerrick Balanza and Larry Muyang were also solid in the opener.</p>
      <p>The Knights may not have the bulk of the season individual awards that the Lions have, but they are determined to claim the biggest prize.</p>
      <p>“Sinasabi namin, wala kaming nakuhang awards, si Fran lang. Ibigay na lang natin sa kanila iyon. Ang importante, makuha ang championship trophy,” said Tan.</p>
      <p>On the brink of absorbing his first NCAA Finals loss, coach Boyet Fernandez hopes that San Beda has shaken off the Game 1 defeat that shattered the team’s myth of invincibility.</p>
      <p>The pressure of maintaining such a long streak which started Aug. 2018 took its toll on the Lions.</p>
      <p>“The pressure is off our backs right now. Having a clean slate takes its toll on the players and the community, pero we did that e,” said Fernandez.  “No one is to blame but ourselves.”</p>
      <p>The league’s best shooting and passing team in the eliminations, San Beda went 6-of-40 from beyond the arc and had 10 assists, with top assist man Evan Nelle only dish out one.</p>
      <p>“I told the boys to accept the pain and think about what we did not do well. Eventually, they need to think about what we did well. We held them   down to sixty-five points after averaging eighty-plus,” said Fernandez.</p>
      <p>“If we do that, we have a chance to win on Friday.”</p>
