      <p>Focus Tower is a popular attraction dotted on Australia's Surfers Paradise and has previously featured on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!</a> .</p>
      <p>Surfers Paradise is home to some of the country's most stunning beaches and has found popularity among tourists.</p>
      <p>And right along the sand is Focus Tower, which found itself at the heart of controversy after appearing on I'm A Celeb in 2017, and stars will be climbing it again in this year's run of the series.</p>
      <p>Here's all the important details you should know about the gorgeous attraction...</p>
      <p>The tower itself is located near Brisbane in Surfers Paradise, Queensland and is a luxury apartment block boasting beautiful sea views.</p>
      <p>It includes a heated pool, jacuzzi, gym, BBQ and picnic areas and landscaped gardens, all complete with a Chinese restaurant and free WiFi for residents.</p>

      <p>Focus Tower is a 32 storey tower and 96m tall, made of reinforced unit tower.</p>
      <p>It had a diameter of 30m and was known as the tallest building on the Gold Coast from 1967-77, designed by architects Clark &amp; Gazzard Partners.</p>
      <p>Back in the 2017 series of I'm A Celeb, the host of stars had to walk the plank before they were jetted into the jungle as part of a terrifying task.</p>

      <p>One eagle-eyed viewer spotted something a bit off about the footage, as it seemed the stars weren't 334ft in the air - it looked like they were only a couple of storeys above ground.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> user Tom Smith paused his TV to capture the dreaded task and posted it on social media.</p>
      <p>The picture showed a woman walking along the road underneath the planks celebrities were walking over.</p>

      <p>He wrote: "Bottom left, that woman's rather large considering she's 320 plus foot lower than the celebs!"</p>
      <p>At the time, the picture had been shared over 38,000 times and had accumulated more than 40,000 comments on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> .</p>
      <p>Others disagreed and shot down the theory, claiming the task was real and one fan claimed they watched the filming from their office window.</p>
