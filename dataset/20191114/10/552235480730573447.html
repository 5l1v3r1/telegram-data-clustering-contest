      <p>A <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/ayrshire/">Kilmarnock</a> man who threatened ScotRail staff and members of the public with a potato peeler has been jailed.</p>
      <p>Christopher Brown told a train driver he was “getting stabbed” before trying to strike a passenger with the weapon on a platform of Kilmarnock railway station on August 19.</p>
      <p>Brown, an inmate at Kilmarnock prison, appeared at the town’s sheriff court on Monday and pleaded guilty to three charges of abusive behaviour, assault and possession of an offensive item.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The prosecutor told the court the 25-year-old had been waiting on a train to Glasgow, which arrived in Kilmarnock station around 9pm.</p>
      <p>The driver pulled his window down and Brown walked up to him and said he and his friend had no money to get home.</p>
      <p>The train conductor then approached to check if Brown had a ticket. The accused swore and said he had no money.</p>
      <p>The prosecutor said: “At this point they got on the train and were asked to leave.</p>
      <p>“He began to sprawl himself across the seats, ignoring the requests to leave.</p>
      <p>“The driver had to leave the front and assist his colleague. The accused reacted abusively and the driver went back to the driver’s cab.”</p>
      <p>At this point Brown walked up to the window of the driver’s compartment with an item in his hand which the driver thought looked like a pen knife.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The item was a potato peeler and Brown told the driver: “You’re getting stabbed.”</p>
      <p>Brown then got off the train and turned his attention to a passenger standing on the platform.</p>
      <p>The fiscal depute said: “The accused approached them with the potato peeler and was attempting to strike him.</p>
      <p>“The passenger tried to strike him back with his rucksack.”</p>
      <p>Brown then shouted back at the driver of the train: “You are getting it. You’re getting stabbed.”</p>
      <p>The train then left the platform and Brown made his way into the station ticket office, where he began shouting and swearing at a woman working behind the counter.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>He was told by the office worker that police would be called, at which point he stated: “I will be back in an hour to get you.”</p>
      <p>The prosecutor told the court: “He held out the potato peeler and started to brandish it.</p>
      <p>“This item was successfully removed from him by another member of staff and police were contacted.</p>
      <p>“He was later traced under the influence of alcohol and cautioned and charged.”</p>
      <p>Brown’s solicitor told the court: “What seems to have happened after the altercation with the passenger is another passenger has stopped him and punched him.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“It is quite clear that the person who punched him was perhaps justified in taking that action due to his behaviour towards the other passenger.”</p>
      <p>The lawyer added: “He was intoxicated to the extent that he could hardly walk in a straight line.</p>
      <p>“He recognises in the long term he has to do something about his alcohol consumption.”</p>
      <p>Sheriff Elizabeth McFarlane told Brown: “If you want to do something about your drink problem then do something about it.”</p>
      <p>Brown was sentenced to 16 months in prison.</p>
