      <p>WORK has started on the painting of the exterior of the historic Imperial Hotel in Castlebar.</p>
      <p>John Condon, head of the Castlebar Municipal District, confirmed the building, which had become an eyesore in recent years, is being tidied up.</p>
      <p>A plan is being formulated for a complete renovation of the premises where the Irish Land League was founded in 1878.</p>
      <p>Those plans are expected to be completed next year and put on public display as part of a consultation process.</p>
      <p>Councillor Ger Deere welcomed the news that works had commenced to give the building a facelift.</p>
      <p>But he will continue to campaign for the former hotel to be given a new lease of life as a museum, tourist office or municipal district headquarters.</p>
      <p>"The manner in which it has been allowed to fall into decline in recent years has been an embarrassment for Castlebar," he stated.</p>
      <p>Mayo County Council are the owners of the building at the Mall.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Mr. Condon confirmed that plans are being drafted for the old Castlebar swimming poolÂ and will be revealed within the coming months.</p>
