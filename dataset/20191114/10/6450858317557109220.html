      <h1>Motorola Razr (2019) confirmed: Release date, price and specs</h1>
      <h2>Motorola has reinvented the iconic Razr flip-phone with a flexible display. It's the dual-screen folding phone everyone is going to want.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T10:02:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 10:02</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Martin</a></address>
      <p>The Motorola Razr is arguably the most iconic flip-phone of all time, and just like Nokia with the <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/review/budget-smartphones/nokia-3310-3655217/">3310</a>, the phone is back with a new incarnation. The Razr 2019 is the <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/news/mobile-phone/foldable-phones-3692547/">folding phone</a> everyone is going to want so here's what you need to know.</p>
      <p>It was back in 2004 that Motorola first launched the very popular Razr V3 so it's great to see it back 15 years later in this modern form.</p>
      <h3>When will the Motorola Razr 2019 be released?</h3>
      <p>This new edition might be known as the Razr 2019 but it's not going to arrive until next year. There's no firm release date but it's due in <b>January 2020</b>.</p>
      <p>That's for the US anyway. In the UK, we know it will be exclusively available via EE but a date is yet to be confirmed. You can register your interest <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3776312-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fmobile-phone%2Fmotorola-razr-2019-3776312%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fee.co.uk%2Fmotorola-razr">here </a>to get news on pre-orders.</p>
      <h3>How much will the Motorola Razr 2019 cost?</h3>
      <p>Foldable phones aren't cheap so it's perhaps no surprise that the Razr 2019 is set at <b>$1,499</b>. We're waiting for a UK price but expect it to be around the same figure.</p>
      <p>For context, the <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/review/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-fold-3695308/">Galaxy Fold</a> is $2,000 and the most expensive <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/review/smartphones/iphone-11-pro-3703005/">iPhone 11 Pro Max</a> is $1,449.</p>
      <h3>Motorola Razr 2019 design and features</h3>
      <p>While the Galaxy Fold and <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/review/smartphones/huawei-mate-x-first-look-3692782/">Huawei Mate X</a> open and close along a vertical fold, the Razr sticks with that classic horizontal design which the original was so well known for. Motorola said it developed and tested over 20 different prototypes with the clamshell being the perfect solution.</p>
      <p>So instead of a screen above the hinge and a set of buttons below, the Razr 2019 is all screen. It also has a smaller display on the outside.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>This new Razr is made from stainless steel and Gorilla Glass and the zero gap hinge is patent-protected. Motorola says both sides of the custom polymer display sit perfectly flush when the phone is closed, protecting the screen from any dust or dirt.</p>
      <p>Motorola has also engineered antenna to fit into a space half the size of most modern phones and there's a water resistant coating, too.</p>
      <h3>Motorola Razr 2019 specs</h3>
      <p>Let's start with the displays so the main display is 6.2in with Motorola calling it the Flex View. It used OLED technology and has a tall 21:9 aspect ratio with a 2142 x 876 resolution.</p>
      <p>And yes, you can hang up a phone call by closing the phone just like the old days.</p>
      <p>On the outside is a 2.7in Quick View display so you can still get info and get things done without opening the Razr up. You can do things like make calls, reply to messages, control music and take selfies.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Elsewhere, the Razr 2019 is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 710, not one of the firm's higher end processors so users might be disappointed to get a mid-range chip at this price. There's 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, but no microSD card slot.</p>
      <p>With the folding desing, the front facing camera is the main one and is 16Mp with an f/1.7 aperture and a Night Vision mode. It sits below the Quick View screen. Open up the Razr and there's a 5Mp camera you can use.</p>
      <p>A modern USB-C port and you'll get a 15W TurboPower charger in the box. There's no headphone jack here so USB-C headphones are included as well as an adapter.</p>
      <p>There's a battery on either side of the hinge combining for a total of 2510mAh so there's a question mark over battery life here with most smartphones coming with at least 3000mAh.</p>
      <p>Other specs include a fingerprint scanner below the larger screen, eSIM, NFC, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. Oddly, the Razr 2019 doesn't come with the latest Android 10 software, instead shipping with Android 9 Pie.</p>
