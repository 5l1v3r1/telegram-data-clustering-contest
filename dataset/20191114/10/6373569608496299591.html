      <p>If you ever have a dream that feel so real, you need to do something about it.</p>
      <p>Some dreams can be so vivid that they remain clear in your mind for days, weeks or even years.</p>
      <p>However, there is a reason why some dreams stay with you longer than others – it is a sign your dreaming mind is trying to tell you something important about your waking life.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/ten-terrifying-dreams-expert-says-20876315">The Mirror</a> have listed 10 common dreams that reveal something important, and what you should do about it.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Drowning</b>
      </p>
      <p>Water in dreams symbolises your emotions. So if you have a dream where you are drowning, it is a clear sign that you are letting your feelings make decisions for you in your waking life. Your dreaming mind is encouraging you to learn how to manage your emotions better.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Your home</b>
      </p>

      <p>Houses in dreams represent your inner life, so if your dream house is damaged or destroyed, it suggests you are sabotaging yourself or not taking care of yourself. Your emotional health is at risk. The flip side is that dreams about ­discovering new spaces in your home, or dreams about home improvements, suggest that some aspect of your waking life is improving.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Planes, trains and automobiles</b>
      </p>
      <p>If you find yourself in an out-of-control car or vehicle in a dream, whether or not you are driving, this suggests that events in your waking life are in danger of getting out of control. It’s time for you to get in the driver’s seat or, if you are the driver, to drive more skilfully.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Natural disasters</b>
      </p>
      <p>It can be frightening in dreams when you are confronted by natural ­disasters. These can signal personal problems raging out of control in your life. Your dreaming mind no longer wants you to ignore them.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Death or illness</b>
      </p>
      <p>Dreams in which you are dead or dying can symbolise your desire to escape the ­responsibilities and burdens of life. If you dream about a death that is accidental, it can suggest that some part of you isn’t functioning and you need to make changes – it is a symbol of new beginnings.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Buried alive</b>
      </p>
      <p>If you are buried alive in a dream and feel powerless to scream or breathe, it can be a sign that there is ­confusion or conflict in your life. You urgently need to find a way to escape restrictions and get a new ­perspective on the situation you’re in. If you can’t do it by yourself, you need to reach out to others for help.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Unable to move</b>
      </p>
      <p>Being unable to move in a dream – either being stuck in something or paralysed – suggests you are feeling stifled from taking on too much responsibility, or are not able to express your true feelings. You can’t decide on the best course of action and feel stuck. But sometimes you have to make a decision to move forward, even if that decision isn’t the perfect one.</p>
      <p>If you are stuck in mud in a dream, this indicates feeling stuck in some way in your life and needing to find a way to break free.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Departed loved ones</b>
      </p>
      <p>Dreaming about someone you love who has died is very common and can be extremely comforting for people who are grieving. This may be because the dreams suggest this life is not all there is, and death may not in fact be the end.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Superhero</b>
      </p>

        <figcaption>Dreaming of superheroes is good</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Dreaming that you are a superhero, like flying dreams, are wonderfully liberating messages from your dreaming mind. They show that there is so much more to you than you currently realise. You have tremendous potential. You need to be bold and believe in yourself and your unique qualities.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Recurring dreams</b>
      </p>
      <p>If you find yourself having the same or similar dreams over and over again, this should never be ignored. Your dreaming mind wants you to take note and is using the power of repetition to tell you something important for your personal growth. You will continue to have the same dream until you fully understand the message your dreaming mind is sending you.</p>
