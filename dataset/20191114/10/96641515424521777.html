      <h1>‘Pokémon Go’ users can add PokéStops and gyms with Niantic Wayfarer</h1>
      <h2>Level 40 Trainers worldwide now have access to the feature.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T10:42:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 10:42</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.engadget.com/editors/marc-deangelis" target="_blank">Marc DeAngelis</a></address>
      <p>Last week, <i>Pokémon Go</i> developer Niantic announced <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/06/pokemon-go-buddy-adventure/">several new features</a> for its AR game. One of the updates, Niantic Wayfarer, is now available for all trainers who have achieved level 40 or higher, allowing them to add real-world locations to the game's map. These spots can serve as Pokéstops (where you can buy supplies) or gyms (where you can battle other players). Qualified trainers can nominate a location after passing a short quiz. Others can then vote on whether or not the location should become a PokéStop or gym. The feature was available to select areas as a test, but it is now enabled worldwide.</p>
      <p>While Niantic Wayfarer is new to <i>Pokémon Go</i>, the company offered a similar feature in its first AR game, Ingress. By adding places like retail spots and local landmarks to <i>Pokémon Go</i>'s map, players will have more chances to convene, battle and stock up on eggs and Pokéballs.</p>
      <p>On one hand, it feels like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-16-niantic-harry-potter-wizard-unite-location-data.html">Niantic</a> is asking its users to do some heavy lifting for free. On the other, adding relevant locations to the game throughout the globe would be nearly impossible for a single organization. Pokémon Go isn't quite the craze it was three years ago, but its dedicated fanbase will likely enjoy having a more active world to explore.</p>
