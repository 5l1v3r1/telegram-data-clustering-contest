      <p>The countdown to Christmas begins now.</p>
      <p>While the trees and decorations still have to be put up, the team at Irvine’s Salvation Army hall is keen to get this year’s annual toy appeal under way.</p>
      <p>And as always, we’re calling on the Irvine Herald readers to back the annual campaign.</p>
      <p>Dawn Steel, of the Salvation Army, said: “We want to try to ensure that no child in the Irvine and Kilwinning area wakes up on Christmas morning without a gift.</p>
      <p>“That’s why we ask the Irvine Herald readers to think of children less fortunate than their own and pick up an extra gift or two while doing their Christmas shopping.</p>
      <p>“We pass on the gifts donated to the most vulnerable families in our area – and all members of the family receive a gift. So we are looking for gifts suitable for babies right up to teenagers.</p>
      <p>“The public are always really generous when it comes to the toy appeal – and they have never let us down.</p>
      <p>“The appeal is a lot of hard work for the volunteers here but it’s worth it knowing that you’re making a child happy on Christmas day.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Readers can drop parcels off at the Salvation Army HQ in Townhead, Irvine, or at the Irvine Herald office at 25 Portland Gate, Kilmarnock.</p>
      <p>Working in conjunction with schools and nurseries in Irvine, Kilwinning and Stevenston, children in need will be identified and they and their siblings will receive a gift.</p>
      <p>Over the years several organisations including Irvine Sea Cadets, the UNISON office at Crosshouse Hospital, Nationwide Building Society, Harry Fairbairn, various political parties, as well as Tesco and Sainsbury’s have supported the appeal.</p>
      <p>Irvine Herald editor Clair Fullarton said: “It is an absolute pleasure to be able to offer support to such a worthwhile appeal.</p>
      <p>“The Salvation Army volunteers really do put their heart and soul into this just to make sure no child is left out on Christmas morning.</p>
      <p>“So please readers while you’re doing your Christmas shopping this year, why not buy an extra gift or <br/>two and donate to this wonderful appeal?”</p>
      <p>To find out how you can help, please contact Ian and Dawn on 01294 214448 or Ian on 07724 637730.</p>
      <p>If your business or group is supporting the appeal, please let us know by calling the Irvine Herald newsdesk on 01563 557120.</p>
