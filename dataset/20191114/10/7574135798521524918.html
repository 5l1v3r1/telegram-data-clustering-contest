      <p>A couple of weeks ago, <b>KISS</b> revealed at their 2019 KISS Kruise that they’d <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/kiss-add-75-dates-to-farewell-tour-including-final-show-in-nyc-in-2021/">extended their ‘End of the Road’ farewell tour</a> to include tons of new 2020 dates, a 2020 KISS Kruise, and a final hometown NYC show in 2021. They had only revealed the dates and cities at that point, but today they revealed all the venues and ticket info too.</p>
      <p>The tour includes mostly amphitheater and arena shows, including stops in Atlantic City, NJ; Canandaigua, NY; Hartford, CT; Bangor, ME; Mansfield, MA; Allentown, PA; Buffalo, NY; Peoria, IL; Fort Wayne, IN; Los Angeles, CA; El Paso, TX; Atlanta, GA; Raleigh, NC; Tinley Park, IL; Dayton, OH; Milwaukee, WI; Phoenix, AZ; Austin, TX; and many other cities.</p>
      <p><a href="http://ticketmaster.evyy.net/c/259789/264167/4272?u=https://www.ticketmaster.com/kiss-tickets/artist/735455"><b>Tickets</b></a> for all dates go on sale to the general public on Friday, November 22 with KISS Meet &amp; Greet Experiences going on sale Tuesday (11/19) at 10 AM local, a KISS Army fan club presale beginning Wednesday (11/20) at 10 AM local, and a Citi presale beginning Wednesday at noon local.</p>
      <p>Dates through October 2, 2020 are currently announced. <b>Details for the 2020 KISS Kruise and the final 2021 NYC show are still TBA.</b> All North American dates are listed below.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, KISS have sadly had to cancel their November/December Australian tour due to Paul Stanley coming down with the flu. “Words cannot begin to convey our massive disappointment in having to cancel our ‘End Of The Road’ tour of your incredible country,” Stanley says. “Our connection to you is unparalleled and decades deep. We waited as long as we could and held out hope to the last minute that my situation would clear up and we would be able to march forward. Doctor’s orders ultimately have taken precedence and finally we now find ourselves with no choice but to surrender. With heavy hearts, KISS.”</p>
      <p>Promoters One World Entertainment and TEG Live said, We are devastated with the cancelation of the Australian tour. We’ve been in constant contact with the band in the past few days hoping for a positive outcome. We know how much fans were looking forward to the tour. We send our best wishes to Paul for a speedy recovery.”</p>
      <p>As of now, KISS’ Japan tour, which is set to begin on December 8, is still on. They were also recently announced for the 2020 edition of Barcelona’s <a href="http://www.rockfestbarcelona.com/">Rockfest</a>, alongside Judas Priest, Accept, My Dying Bride, Nile, and more.
