      <h1>British Columbia set to announce changes around youth vaping, regulations</h1>

      <p>VICTORIA -- The British Columbia government is expected to announce changes today around vaping especially in regards to young people in the province.</p>
      <p>Health Minister Adrian Dix has said B.C. will be taking strong action that involves education, tightening access, working with partners and pressuring the federal government to act.</p>
      <p>He said the action would involve first-of-its-kind regulations in Canada with a goal of making vaping as socially unacceptable as smoking cigarettes are to young people.</p>
      <p>The B.C. School Trustees Association has asked the government for help, saying many districts in B.C. are spending too much time monitoring and addressing the problem of vaping in schools.</p>
      <p>Health Canada said last week that the province may now have three possible vaping-related illnesses and the provincial health officer said the number was likely to rise as more of the illnesses were reported and investigated.</p>
      <p>Health Canada has issued a warning to people who vape to monitor themselves for symptoms of vaping-related pulmonary illness following hundreds of such cases in the United States and a few in Canada.</p>
