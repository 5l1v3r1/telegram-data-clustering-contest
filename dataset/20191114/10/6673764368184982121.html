      <p><b>AOMORI – </b>A 14-year-old boy was sent to prosecutors on Thursday for attempted murder after being arrested on suspicion of slashing a sixth-grade elementary schoolgirl in Aomori Prefecture.</p>
      <p>Several knives were found in a bag he was believed to be carrying at the time of Tuesday’s incident, investigative sources said.</p>
      <p>The boy is suspected of attempting to kill the girl by approaching her from behind and slashing her throat as she was walking home alone from school at around 4:40 p.m. on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>He may have attacked the girl when he was on his way home from his junior high school, the sources said. Investigators found the boy at a cram school in the city of Hachinohe a few minutes after 8 p.m. that day.</p>
      <p>Investigators are working to track the boy’s moves before and after the incident, and to find motives for his alleged attack.</p>
      <p>The suspect has admitted the charge, telling police that he had intended to kill and it didn’t matter who it was, the sources said.</p>
      <p>Japanese police do not release the names of arrested minors.</p>
      <p>The girl, left with a 10-centimeter-long gash as deep as 1 cm, was taken to a nearby hospital and is able to speak, according to the police.</p>
