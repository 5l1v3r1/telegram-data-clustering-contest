      <p>Brave is a free open-source browser with a focus on privacy and security. It has previously only been in beta with eight million monthly users, but a stable 1.0 version has now launched for Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS. Security includes blocking trackers, autoplay videos and third-party ads automatically.</p>
      <p>Brave isn’t the only browser to block ads and trackers, of course. <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/tag/firefox/">Firefox</a> automatically blocks some trackers while Safari blocks most from sites that aren’t visited frequently (others drop off the browser after 24 hours). Microsoft is working on a feature for <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/tag/microsoft-edge/">Edge</a> to automatically block some trackers that will release on January 15. Google said certain types of cookies will be blocked by default in February.</p>
      <p>Ad blockers are a problem for sites that rely on ad revenue based on views. Brave Ads is a possible solution, offering ads that actually pay users to view them without accessing their data. Users can also control how many ads they see per hour, which act as push notifications instead of webpage banners. When users agree to use Brave Ads, they’ll earn blockchain tokens with Brave Rewards. They can either donate tokens to support creators or cash them out with Brave’s partner, <a href="https://uphold.com/">Uphold</a>. Tokens can also be exchanged for gift cards and restaurant vouchers.</p>
      <p>In addition to blocking ads and trackers, Brave offers two private modes. Private Window works like a standard incognito mode where no data is saved to your device. Websites or your network administrator (or ISP) can still see your data, however. Private Window with Tor (The Onion Router) goes a step further by encrypting data and effectively hiding it.</p>
      <p>Brave was founded by Brendan Eich, who co-founded <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/tag/mozilla/">Mozilla</a> (Firefox), but was forced to resign as CEO in 2014 due to a donation controversy.</p>
