      <p>The United States and other Western countries on Wednesday, admonished Egypt to initiate an inquiry into alleged killings and torture by its security forces.</p>
      <p>They also urged the release of journalists and others arrested for exercising their right to freedom of expression.</p>
      <p>The U.S. Human Rights Counsellor Daniel Kronenfeld said: “We recommend Egypt to: One, address impunity by credibly investigating allegations of extrajudicial killings, torture, and forced disappearances by security forces, publicly release findings, and prosecute those responsible.</p>
      <p>“Two, release detainees held for exercising their rights to freedom of expression or association and ensure fair trial guarantees for those remaining in detention.</p>
      <p>According to reports, the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva is reviewing Egypt’s records as part of a regular examination of all U.N. member states.</p>
      <p>However, the Egyptian authorities reiterated their commitment to punitive measures against perpetrators of heinous crimes.</p>
      <p>Minister for Parliamentary Affairs, Omar Marwan told the media that Egypt has obeyed international reporting structures.</p>
      <p>“During the past five years, many criminals and disciplinary actions were taken for incidents related to torture, many trails were organized against perpetrators of torture and ill-treatment.</p>
      <p>“Our report submits data and numbers on these trails and a detailed report of this issue shall be submitted to the CAT (Committee Against Torture).”</p>
      <p>According to the Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms, nearly 3,000 people, including lawyers and academics, are being held.</p>
      <p>Most of them were charged over issues including the use of social media to spread false news, joining a banned terrorist group, and protesting without a permit.</p>
