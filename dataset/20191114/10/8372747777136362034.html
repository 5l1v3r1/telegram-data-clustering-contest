      <p>Every 15 minutes, someone in the United States dies of a superbug that has learned to outsmart even our most sophisticated antibiotics, according to a new <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/biggest-threats.html">report</a> from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
      <p>That's about 35,000 deaths each year from drug-resistant infections, according to the landmark report.</p>
      <p>The report places five drug-resistant superbugs on the CDC's "urgent threat" list -- two more germs than were on the CDC's list in 2013, the last time the agency issued a report on antibiotic resistance.</p>
      <p>Genetic research shows germs have become especially adept at teaching each other how to outwit antibiotics.</p>
      <p>"Some miracle drugs no longer perform miracles," according to the report.</p>
      <p>The report also notes that while superbug infections in hospitals are down, some infections caught elsewhere -- anywhere in the community -- have increased.</p>
      <p>"This is a problem that ultimately affects all of us," said <a href="https://blogs.cdc.gov/safehealthcare/authors/michael-craig-mpp/">Michael Craig</a> , a CDC senior adviser on antibiotic resistance. "It literally has the potential to affect every person on the planet."</p>
      <p>
        <b>Anyone can catch a superbug anywhere</b>
      </p>
      <p>While superbugs typically attack frail, elderly people, anyone can contract a superbug.</p>
      <p>Peggy Lillis was a healthy, vibrant 56-year-old teacher in Brooklyn, who woke up one morning 10 years ago with severe diarrhea.</p>
      <p>"Being a kindergarten teacher, she just assumed that she caught something from one of the kids or maybe she had food poisoning. She did not think it was a serious threat. None of us did," remembers her son, Christian Lillis.</p>
      <p>Five days later, Peggy was so sick she could barely move.</p>
      <p>Doctors immediately admitted Peggy to the intensive care unit. She had <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hai/organisms/cdiff/cdiff_infect.html">Clostridioides difficile</a> , or C. diff, one of the urgent threats on the CDC's list.</p>
      <p>Peggy kidneys were starting to fail, and she was going into septic shock.</p>
      <p>The hospital gave Peggy an antibiotic called <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/vancomycin-intravenous-route/description/drg-20068900#:~:targetText=Vancomycin%20is%20used%20to%20treat,other%20medicines%20may%20not%20work.">vancomycin</a> , both intravenously and by enema. But she died the next day -- less than a week after becoming ill.</p>
      <p>"The doctors at the hospital where she was treated -- they did everything they could for her," Christian said. "But bacteria are evolving at a rate that we are not keeping up with."</p>
      <p>Christian says they'll never know exactly where or when his mother picked up the C. diff bacteria.</p>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hai/organisms/cdiff/cdiff_infect.html">CDC, </a>a C. diff infection is usually a side effect of taking antibiotics, which along with killing bad bacteria, can also kill the good bacteria that help fight infections. People taking antibiotics are 7 to 10 times more likely to get C. diff while on the drugs and during the month after.</p>
      <p>Two days before she became ill, Peggy's dentist had prescribed an antibiotic called clindamycin to prevent infection following a root canal.</p>
      <p>Peggy's <a href="https://peggyfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Peggy_Lillis_Autopsy.pdf">autopsy</a> lists her cause of death as illnesses "as a consequence of antibiotic therapy for a dental procedure."</p>
      <p>Now her family questions whether that preventive antibiotic was necessary.</p>
      <p>Christian and his brother, Liam Lillis, hope to educate others about C. diff through the <a href="https://peggyfoundation.org/">Peggy Lillis Foundation.</a></p>
      <p>"My mother was probably the best person I've ever known in my life," Christian said. "What we will not accept is that our mother's death is going to be in vain."</p>
      <p>
        <b>Five superbugs on the urgent list</b>
      </p>
      <p>C. diff is the deadliest antibiotic-resistant germ on the CDC's urgent list, causing 12,800 deaths a year in the United States.</p>
      <p>The other two germs on the urgent list since 2013 are carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, or CRE, and drug-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae, a sexually transmitted infection.</p>
      <p>This year, the CDC added two more: a bacteria, carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter, and Candida auris, a fungus.</p>
      <p>The report classifies 11 additional bacteria and fungi as serious threats, two as concerning, and four others are on the agency's "watch list."</p>
      <p>The number of deaths from these antibiotic-resistant germs has gone down 18% since the 2013 report, largely due to a significant decrease in superbug deaths in hospitals from 2012 to 2017.</p>
      <p>"CDC recognizes that hospital prevention programs have already seen successes," according to the report.</p>
      <p>There's still room for improvement, however: About 85% of deaths from drug-resistant germs are caused by germs typically found in hospitals and other health care facilities, such as nursing homes.</p>
      <p>The CDC report notes that for the first time, the agency used electronic medical records to calculate antibiotic-resistant infections and deaths. This led them to discover that the number of infections and deaths since 2013 was higher than previously estimated.</p>
      <p>While the situation in hospitals has improved, some superbugs outside the hospital are on the rise.</p>
      <p>"The CDC is concerned about rising resistant infections in the community, [which] puts more people at risk and makes spread more difficult to identify and contain -- and threatens the progress made to protect patients in healthcare," according to the new report.</p>
      <p>Some superbugs circulating in the community have figured out how to "teach" each other how to fight off antibiotics by sharing their resistance genes with each other.</p>
      <p>"It's essentially crowdsourcing," Craig added. "They can crowdsource their resistance to other germs."</p>
      <p>
        <b>Fighting antibiotic resistance</b>
      </p>
      <p>The answer to the antibiotic resistance crisis is not more powerful antibiotics, according to the new report.</p>
      <p>Antibiotics are slow to come to market, and germs will one day render them ineffective anyway, CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield notes in his introduction to the report.</p>
      <p>"We need to adopt aggressive strategies that keep the germs away and infections from occurring in the first place," Redfield wrote.</p>
      <p>The key is to use antibiotics less. With less exposure, germs have fewer opportunities to learn how to fight them.</p>
      <p>CDC estimates that about a third of prescriptions for antibiotics in emergency rooms and doctors' offices were given for infections that didn't need them. That's 47 million unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions each year.</p>
      <p>Some experts blame doctors for giving in to patients' demands for antibiotics for infections that aren't caused by bacteria, such as viral sore throats and sinus infections.</p>
      <p>Craig noted that better tests and tools need to be developed, since currently it can be difficult for doctors to determine whether a patient needs an antibiotic.</p>
      <p>"We don't have good diagnostics for certain infections, so we can't always tell if someone has a viral infection or a bacterial infection," he said.</p>
      <p>Resistance also increases when antibiotics are overused in animals. Antibiotics can be overused to treat infections in animals, just as they're overused to treat human infections. In fact, 20% of all drug resistant infections come from the food we eat, according to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/foodsafety/challenges/from-farm-to-table.html">CDC</a> .</p>
      <p>As of 2017, drugs that are important to human health are <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/food.html">no longer</a> allowed to be used for growth promotion or feed efficiency in US livestock.</p>
      <p>Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, points out that whether it's overuse in humans or animals, since antibiotic resistance is largely a man-made problem, it requires man-made solutions.</p>
      <p>"We are the problem. We have seen the enemy, and it is us," he said.</p>
      <p>But Fauci added that if doctors, patients and public health officials work together, it will be possible to stem the tide of antibiotic resistant infections.</p>
      <p>"I think we can. I really do," he said. "But it's going to require a global, concerted effort."</p>
