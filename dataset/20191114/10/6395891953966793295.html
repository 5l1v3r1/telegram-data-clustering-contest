      <p><b>COLUMBUS, OhioÂ (AP)</b> - The Dayton area's last abortion clinic has prevailed in a years-long battle over Ohio's stringent new licensing requirements and will remain open.</p>
      <p>The Ohio Department of Health has granted Women's Med Center a surgical facility license.</p>
      <p>The center in Kettering had postponed surgical abortions as it pursued multiple avenues to stay open, including state and federal court challenges and negotiations with local health systems and doctors.</p>
      <p>After being unable to land the legally required emergency patient-transfer agreement, the center secured enough doctor signatures for a variance.</p>
      <p>Ohio Right to Life, the state's largest anti-abortion group, said it's disappointed the state has licensed a facility that's skirted laws for years that are intended to protect women.</p>
      <p>NARAL Pro-Choice Ohio, an abortion-rights group, said Ohio's restrictive abortion laws are not medically necessary.</p>
