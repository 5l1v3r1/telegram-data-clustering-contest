      <p>LAHORE (Dunya News) – Lahore High Court (IHC) on Thursday has allowed Pakistan Peoples’ Party (PPP) leader Qamar Zaman Kaira to hold meeting with party’s co-chairman and former president Asif Ali Zardari. <br/><br/>While hearing the petition filed by PPP’s Kaira, the court has permitted him to meet the ex-president on November 25.</p>
      <p>It is to be mentioned here that PPP lawyers and chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari had failed to convince Zardari to apply for bail plea in National Accountability Bureau (NAB) case against him.</p>
      <p>Zardari said, "It’s my case and only I will decide about it. Let’s see what government of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) will do with me now."</p>
      <p>Afterwards, the senior PPP leaders had asked Bilawal to allow them to agree the party co-chairman on filing the bail.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the PPP leadership had also written an application to form private medical board for the checkup of ex-president.</p>
      <p>PPP’s application stated that doctors have pointed out Zardari’s severe health issues, adding that uncontrolled sugar level can create problems for him. Government doctors also suggested to get help from a neurologist, the application told.</p>
      <p>The PPP said that getting proper medical care is basic and legal right of every prisoner.<br/><br/>On October 22, 2018, Zardari was brought to Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) from Adiala jail and admitted to the cardiology department’s VIP ward.</p>
      <p>The former president had complaints of backache, weakness and anxiety. </p>
