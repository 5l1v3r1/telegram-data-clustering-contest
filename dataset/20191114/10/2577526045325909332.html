        <i>This article contains gameplay spoilers for Death Stranding</i>
      </p>
      <p>At the core of <i>Death Stranding</i> is the bond between Sam Porter-Bridges and his bridge baby, or BB. This is a game where you walk around, essentially, like a dad on the weekends: you've a massive rucksack on your back, a baby strapped to your chest, various subsidiary bags hanging off your arms, and the biggest priority is not to fall over. The only thing that's missing is a picnic.</p>
      <p><i>Death Stranding</i> is typical of Hideo Kojima's work, by which I mean that the underlying concepts and how they're expressed through the game's mechanics are brilliant, while the moment-to-moment script is mostly daft, over-written, and so on-the-nose it verges on self-parody. It has always been thus, and I say so as someone who considers the Metal Gear Solid series a rare masterpiece. Part of its power was always Kojima's weaving of real-world politics and events throughout this era-spanning meditation on geopolitics, and the big theme of <i>Death Stranding</i> is a natural progression from this: environment change, extinction, and our world's climate crisis.</p>

      <p>One element of this is the emphasis throughout on human co-operation, the foundation for the game's mechanics: everything comes down to a man delivering parcels to help out others, and through this building the literal connection of the Chiral Network. And the delivery mechanism for this delivery mechanism is the team of Sam and BB. While you began the game as Sam solo, BB is introduced early and will be the player's constant companion and ally over the hundreds of kilometres to come.</p>
      <p>It's a relationship that is expressed through some typically ingenious ideas. First and most striking is BB's audio being transmitted from the Dualshock, an unsettling effect that also superimposes the player and Sam for an instant: the BB is strapped to Sam's midsection and, when it cries, you hear the sound coming from your own midsection. The noises are also isolated in this way from the rest of the game's soundscape, giving them an attention-grabbing urgency that any parent will attest to.</p>
      <p>This unusual aspect of the game will be divisive: <a href="https://www.kotaku.co.uk/2019/11/08/its-hard-to-play-death-stranding-when-you-have-an-actual-baby">on this week's Splitscreen Jason talked about how much it annoyed him</a>, as a new father, to switch from soothing a baby IRL to doing so in a video game. My partner doesn't like <i>Death Stranding</i>, because of BB generally ("too weird") and this sound effect specifically.</p>

      <p>Totally valid perspectives, yet it just shows that from the perspective of Kojima Productions that the job's a good 'un. A baby crying is one of the most unsettling sounds a human can hear and, if you're a parent in particular, something in your brain responds in a primal way. It can therefore be a brilliant element of a horror experience: perhaps the finest example is the plaintive, echoing cries of Mergo throughout areas of <i>Bloodborne</i>.</p>
      <p><i>Death Stranding</i> is a much less subtle game, and therefore foregrounds the effect, but it's every bit as effective. Hearing BB cry is something that puts you on edge, and so it's used to both punish and motivate the player. Fall over and, as well as Sam's cargo scattering and taking damage, BB will cry for an extended period unless soothed: you've already taken the hit, but the game rams the point home. Whenever I see that I'm going to fall, I wince as the animations play out, bracing myself for the noise I know is coming.</p>
      <p>Conversely, BB's cries when around enemies and under threat served to make me protective. The ambient noise when under threat from BTs, <i>Death Stranding's</i> spectral-stroke-oozy antagonists, half-drowns the sound of BB's cries and, as you focus on dealing with or escaping the situation, this cue is a reminder of what matters. It is remarked upon several times by NPCs that a BB is supposed to just be equipment; yet any human who's used one doesn't seem to agree.</p>
      <p>I don't think many players of <i>Death Stranding</i> would agree, either. Crying is one thing but there are dozens of tiny mechanics that feed into creating a bond between the player and BB, the best of which are based on observation of how young children and their parents interact. One of my favourites involves going fast: whenever I'm wheeling my youngest kid around in the pram, I occasionally jog or run to go a bit faster, which he loves and makes him giggle. Similarly, if you run or drive across the landscape for an uninterrupted period, BB loves it and will reward you with laughs and likes.</p>
      <p>It turns out that BB likes a lot of stuff. At seemingly random points in the game you'll hear similar outbursts of happiness, but there's always some sort of milestone behind them. BB likes it when you move out of a dangerous area; BB likes it when you've travelled a long distance and are nearing your destination; BB likes it when you're getting liked by other players.</p>
      <p>On top of which is the fact that you're never really away from BB. Once you strap on the little tyke, the only times BB is removed are when Sam is sleeping in a room, at which point BB's tank is suspended on a wall facing his bed. You can soothe the baby here before heading back out, which results in a number of bespoke outcomes (some not so pleasant) and animations: Sam often remarks on how 'cute' or 'adorable' BB is while it gurgles, another little elision between character and player.</p>
      <p>I think Sam-as-dad-figure is a huge part of this character's construction, though as a father with young kids I would say that. There are so many aspects to his career that seem like wry observations of the minor annoyances of parenthood. Take packing vehicles. If you've ever packed a car for a long trip with the kids, it's bizarre to catch yourself basically doing it all over again at a Bridges outpost: jamming as many suitcases as possible, taking out the unnecessary bulky stuff, working out what you can fit on the seats... even having to stop halfway to fill up the tank.</p>
      <p>Are we there yet?</p>

      <p>Nearly. That little voice piping up from the back of the car, a wheedling comfort and the earworm of any travel. <i>Death Stranding</i> is in some respects a lonely game: in this landscape, not many people can do what Sam Bridges can. That's offset later by the remnants of other players' work, the neon criss-cross of comrades-in-arms, but parts of this game will send you on long treks where the only other things around are hostile.</p>
      <p>Except BB. Focusing on putting one foot in front of the other, forcing yourself up a sheer slope, you sometimes forget about your most precious cargo. Then as you crest the peak and smile, a laugh and a few likes remind you that, hey, someone else is along for the ride too. Sam might feel alone, but he's not.</p>
      <p>And if you're on one of <i>Death Stranding's</i> longer journeys, you may well choose to have a snooze along the way. You can only rest at larger outposts, initially at least, so often it's a good idea to catch 30 winks in the doorway of any minor bases you've delivered to. In this sleep animation, Sam takes the weight off his back, cradles BB with both arms, and drops off. Not that Sam would notice but, if you keep watching long enough, you'll see BB's tank turn transparent as it peers up into Sam's face, making a happy noise before it fades to black.</p>
      <p>Like the camera shots where you occasionally get a glimpse of BB's smooth bottom (really), before the face appears with thumb-in-mouth and zips Sam back to reality, there's a heady mix here: humour, observation, symbolism, and Kojima simply pushing some basic human buttons. Any parent that plays <i>Death Stranding</i> will quickly notice its particular grooves, the things it associates with BB and Sam and how it grows that relationship over the game's course.</p>
      <p><i>Death Stranding</i> is not the first game to use life's most foundational bond as its own foundation but, in what it builds from this, it manages to capture flashes of what it's like: the endless 'stuff' you accrete, the mundanity, the tears, the times you fall asleep together, the years where you're just a packhorse and, above all else, the simple joy of making a child laugh.</p>
