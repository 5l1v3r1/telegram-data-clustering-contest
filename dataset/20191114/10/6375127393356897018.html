      <h3>Six persons were arrested for illegal gambling in Barangay Duyong Concepcion, San Simon town in Pampanga the other day.</h3>
      <p>In a report to Criminal Investigation and Detection Group-Region 3 (CIDG-3) officer Col. Christopher Abrahano, CIDG-Pampanga head Lt. Col. Dederick Relativo said the operation was conducted after they received an information from concerned citizens about the rampant “color game” operation in the said barangay.</p>
      <p>Arrested for violation of Presidential Decree 1601 were Margie Ancheta, 36; Jemarose De Guzman, 27; Mark Dexter Galvez, 36; Elmer Manaloto Jr., 24; Erwin Taburnal, 39; and Dominador Bagacay, 23.</p>
      <p>Assisted by regional mobile force and municipal policemen, the CIDG-Pampanga operatives also confiscated tables, dices, funnels and related materials used in the illegal gambling and P3,300 bet money.</p>
      <p>The arrested persons were brought to the CIDG-Pampanga office for interrogation and documentation. They are facing charges for conduct of illegal gambling before the Provincial Prosecutor’s Office in the City of San Fernando.</p>
      <p>Abrahano said the CIDG-3 will continue to go after people engaged in illegal and criminal activities and those wanted by the law.</p>
