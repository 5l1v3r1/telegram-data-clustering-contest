      <p>Sony has been trying to get an <i>Uncharted</i> movie made for over a decade now, and while the latest attempt to get Nathan Drake’s story on the big screen—starring <i>Spider-Man’s</i> Tom Holland—sounds like it might actually get made, the addition of Mark Wahlberg to the cast this week is a reminder of just how deep in development hell this project has been.</p>
      <p>You might not remember, but this isn’t the first time Mark Wahlberg has been attached to the movie. <a href="http://www.kotaku.com.au/2010/11/mark-wahlberg-will-be-nathan-drake-deniro-could-be-drakes-dad">In 2010 he signed on to <i>star</i> in the film as Nathan Drake</a>, with Robert DeNiro to play his father and Joe Pesci his uncle. A year later, <a href="http://www.kotaku.com.au/2011/05/report-mark-wahlberg-wont-be-in-uncharted-flick">both he and director David O’Russell were gone</a>.</p>
      <p>Now, <a href="https://variety.com/2019/film/news/mark-wahlberg-tom-holland-uncharted-movie-sony-1203394336/">as <i>Variety</i> reports</a>, he’s back! Only this time as part of director Travis Knight’s (Bumblebee) version, and rather than playing Drake, he’ll be co-starring as Sully.</p>
      <p>A movie being in development so long that your star goes from playing Drake to Sully? Yikes.</p>
