      <h1>Honor 9X release date, price &amp; specs</h1>
      <h2>The Honor 9X is out now in the UK, and it might be the last Honor phone to ever release with Google apps</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T10:41:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 10:41</time> by <a rel="author">Dominic Preston</a></address>
      <p>Honor has confirmed that the Honor 9X, which launched in China this summer, will come to the UK and Europe - and we can expect it fairly soon.</p>
      <p>The 9X is the company’s first phone to feature a pop-up selfie camera, which gives it an almost bezel-less 6.59in front screen. Other headline specs include a 48Mp main rear camera and one of Honor’s signature striking coloured glass finishes, this time with an ‘X’ made out of reflective geometric diamond-cut tiles on the phone’s rear.</p>
      <p>We've already spent a while with the 9X, so <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/review/smartphones/honor-9x-3776643/">read our review</a> to find out what we think.</p>
      <h3>When is the Honor 9X coming out?</h3>
      <p>The Honor 9X is out now in the UK, after a launch on 14 November. It's unlikely that the phone will come to the US however.</p>
      <h3>How much will the Honor 9X cost?</h3>
      <p>The 9X is an affordable little number at £249.95 from <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3776263-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fmobile-phone%2Fhonor-9x-3776263%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hihonor.com%2Fuk%2Fproduct%2Fhonor-9X">Honor itself</a> or <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7928211/type/dlg/sid/06-3776263-11-0000000/https://www.argos.co.uk/product/4193212">Argos</a>, with <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/?ascsubtag=06-3776263-11-0000000">Amazon</a> also expected to sell it. You can also get it on contract from <a href="http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=2264&amp;awinaffid=254429&amp;clickref=06-3776263-11-0000000&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.carphonewarehouse.com%2Fhome%2Fproducts%2Fhonor%2F9x.html%23%21colour%3Dblue%26capacity%3D128GB%26dealType%3Dpm">Carphone Warehouse</a> with prices from £16.99 with no upfront cost, while <a href="http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=380&amp;awinaffid=254429&amp;clickref=06-3776263-11-0000000&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fhonor-9x-128gb-sapphire-blue%3Ftariffcode%3DNLAYMJUL19%26giftcode%3DDPLR1641589%26filter_brand_linkable%255B0%255D%3Dhonor">Mobiles.co.uk</a> has it for £16 per month and <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3776263-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fmobile-phone%2Fhonor-9x-3776263%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobilephonesdirect.co.uk%2Fcontract-mobile-phones%2Fhonor-9x">Mobile Phones Direct has a cashback deal</a> that reduces the effective price to just £12.50 per month with no upfront.</p>
      <p>The previous <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/review/smartphones/honor-8x-3685066">Honor 8X</a> launched at just £230 in the UK, and the 9X is similarly aggressive, which could help make it one of the <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/test-centre/mobile-phone/best-honor-phone-3675263/">best Honor phones</a>.</p>
      <p>In the UK the 9X is available in Sapphire Blue and Midnight Black in just one configuration: 4GB RAM with 128GB storage.</p>
      <h3>Will it have Google apps?</h3>
      <p>We can also confirm that the phone will come with access to Google apps - no longer a guarantee following the launch of <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/review/smartphones/huawei-mate-30-pro-3702522">Huawei’s Mate 30 series</a>. That’s because the 9X passed Google’s certification for its Chinese launch before Huawei was added to the US trade black list, so it will continue to get Google apps and updates - including a planned upgrade to Android 10, though it will ship with 9.</p>
      <h3>What are the 9X specs and features?</h3>
      <p>One interesting note is that this actually looks to be a hybrid between the Honor 9X and the 9X Pro - it has the 6GB RAM and 128GB storage configuration of the 9X, but the triple camera array of China’s Pro model, with a 48Mp main camera joined by a 2Mp depth sensor and 8Mp ultrawide - the latter of which doesn’t feature in the base 9X that was released in China. The European model also has a fingerprint sensor on the rear, while it's on the side of the device in the Chinese variants.</p>
      <p>A Kirin 710 processor, 4000mAh battery, USB-C charging, and headphone jack round out the fairly competitive specs list. There’s no NFC and no IP rating - but both are typical omissions at this price point, and Honor says the phone has been tested for water and dust resistance, even if it doesn’t have the formal rating.</p>
      <h3>Honor Band 5 Sport and Sport Pro headphones</h3>
      <p>Alongside the Honor 9X, the company also unveiled two new products joining its expanding range. First up, the Honor Band 5 Sport is a cheaper, sportier take on the <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/review/wearable-tech/honor-band-5-3703083/">Band 5 fitness tracker</a> that omits the colour display but adds in six-axis motion tracking and a shoelace clip so that it can double as either a watch or clip onto your shoes to analyse your gait, stride, and more while running, cycling, or through various sports.</p>
      <p>There are headphones too. The Honor Sport Pro Bluetooth neckbuds offer 18 hours of music playback off a single charge, and a unique solution to pairing: a USB-C plug is hidden in the in-line remote, and can be used to instantly pair the headphones with your phone - as long as it’s an Honor or Huawei handset, that is.</p>
