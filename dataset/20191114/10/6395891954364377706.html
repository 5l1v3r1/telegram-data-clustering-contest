      <p><b>YOUNGSTOWN, OhioÂ (AP)</b> - As part of the Helmet Challenge launched by the National Football League, league safety officials, scientists, engineers and helmet manufacturers are meeting in Ohio for a symposium on developing a safer helmet for league players.</p>
      <p>The Vindicator reports that the NFL is partnering with America Makes, a national accelerator for 3-D printing and additive manufacturing based in Youngstown, to put on the three-day event which started Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The Youngstown event is the program's national kick-off.</p>
      <p>Up to $3 million will be available in the challenge, including $2 million in grant funding to support the development of a helmet prototype, and a $1 million award.</p>
      <p>The challenge will culminate in May 2021 with applicants submitting helmet prototypes for testing in laboratory conditions that represent potentially concussive impacts in the NFL.</p>
