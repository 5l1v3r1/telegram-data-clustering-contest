      <p>A LEADING national mental health organisation is encouraging people in Mayo who have struggled with suicidal thoughts to consider signing up for its pioneering Eden programme, which is being offered in Co. Mayo.</p>
      <p>Suicide continues to be a major issue in Irish society, with latest figures suggesting approximately 400 deaths per year nationally, with many more people attempting to take their own life.</p>
      <p>Caroline McGuigan, the founder of Suicide or Survive and creator of the Eden Programme, says it offers a tried and tested support for people who have attempted suicide or who are struggling with suicidal thoughts.</p>
      <p>“Eden offers a safe, confidential, warm and caring space offered in a welcoming and supportive weekly group environment one morning a week over a six-month period. In this, up to 16 participants come together to increase their understanding of how they operate in the world and develop tools to manage their own wellness,” says Caroline.</p>
      <p>“Eden opens a space for participants to learn new ways of managing their day to day lives, particularly during times of emotional crisis. It’s about respecting people, hearing them, knowing what each person needs is different and supporting them to find ways to move away from suicide as an option of choice in times of crisis.”</p>
      <p>Eden is delivered in partnership with the National Office for Suicide Prevention, the National Counselling Service and the local suicide resource officer in Mayo.</p>
      <p>Acting CEO of Suicide or Survive, Robert Carley says the programme supports and encourages people to turn their lives around. “Our evaluations prove that Eden can be hugely transformative, with many participants finding hope after years of trying different approaches. Eden is about opening up a safe space for people to be truly heard and to support them to find what works for them on their journey to wellness.”</p>
      <p>Eden has been comprehensively evaluated by Dublin City University and is widely regarded as a cost-effective intervention that offers a unique community-based support. It is currently being offered by Suicide or Survive in Dublin and with HSE partners in Galway, Mayo and Roscommon and it is hoped that it may be offered in other regions in the months and years ahead.</p>
      <p>According to Mary Kilcommins Greene, acting director of the National Counselling Service in the West of Ireland, Eden offers people a unique safe space to help understand and overcome their challenges.</p>
      <p>“To walk into a room with people who are in the same position, it makes them feel at home. It gives them a sense of safety, so that they can be okay in how they are.</p>
      <p>“The essence of the Eden programme is about choice. It's about the person learning about their own choices in their own life and recognising how to move that on,” she says.</p>
      <p>According to Paula Lawlor, national Eden programme manager with Suicide or Survive, the involvement of the agencies like the HSE and the National Counselling Service is key to Eden’s success.</p>
      <p>“None of us can do this alone. That’s why we need everyone working together, the charities, community leaders, the government, the health services, the media - we need everyone.”</p>
      <p>Paula says she is particularly keen to hear from people in Mayo who are interested in finding out more about the programme.</p>
      <p>“We understand that it can be difficult for people to take the next step on their journey to wellness but they can be assured that they will receive a warm, friendly and confidential response from us. We have limited spaces on our programmes so we are encouraging anyone who might be interested to get in touch soon to find out more.”</p>
