      <h1>Raheem Sterling surprised by Gareth Southgate's suggestion England star has 'the hump'</h1>
      <h2>Southgate admitted that the fall-out from Sterling’s bust-up with Joe Gomez could put a strain on their relationship</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T10:00:09+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 10:00</time> by <a rel="author">John Cross, https://www.facebook.com/johncrossmirror/</a></address>
      <p>Raheem Sterling holds no grudges against Gareth Southgate.</p>
      <p>And Sterling was even surprised that Southgate thought he would have the “hump” with the England manager.</p>
      <p>Three Lions boss Southgate admitted in the build-up to Thursday night’s game with Montenegro that the fall-out from Sterling’s bust-up with Joe Gomez could put a strain on their relationship.</p>
      <p>Southgate said: “Is it fair to say that he’s got the hump with me right now? Well, I wouldn’t imagine that he’s hugely enthusiastic but I can understand.”</p>
      <p>But Sterling privately has no bad feeling towards Southgate, who also made it clear that he would start against Kosovo on Sunday after being dropped from the squad for Thursday night's Euro 2020 qualifier as punishment.</p>

      <p>However, the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> star now believes he has a greater understanding of Southgate and his management moving forward in the future.</p>
      <p>Sterling is determined not to let the row affect his focus or the team as they look to clinch qualification for Euro 2020.</p>
      <p>Sterling is regarded as one of the best forwards in Europe, England’s best player and he is determined not to let the spat affect his international career.</p>

      <p>He will be at Wembley on Thursday for the 1,000th game celebrations and, even though he will not be on the pitch, he is fully behind the team.</p>
      <p>Then Sterling will be determined to prove on Sunday in Kosovo that he has lost none of his desire or enthusiasm to play for England and the notion that he will be sulking is completely wrong.</p>
      <p>Only a point is needed against the Group A minnows to secure qualification for the finals and Thursday's encounter at Wembley will also see the Three Lions celebrate becoming the first nation to play 1,000 international matches.</p>
