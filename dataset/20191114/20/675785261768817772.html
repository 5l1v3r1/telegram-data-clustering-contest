      <h1>Harry Kane sets new England record with hat-trick vs Montenegro</h1>
      <h2>The Tottenham forward scored three goals in the opening half to move sixth on the all-time top goals list for England and set another record as well</h2>

      <p>Harry Kane's first-half hat-trick against Montenegro made him the highest England goalscorer as captain of all time.</p>
      <p>The Spurs man netted his first after 19 minutes when Ben Chilwell floated in a free kick which he headed beyond the goalkeeper.</p>
      <p>He doubled his tally just six minutes later when he headed home again from a Chilwell corner, and sealed the hat-trick when he tucked away Trent Alexander-Arnold's cross.</p>
      <p>The three goals put him on 31 in total in an England shirt but he has now also moved past Vivian Woodward to make him the highest-scoring captain, with 24 of his goals coming while he has served as captain compared to Woodward's 23.</p>

      <p>Kane is now chasing down Wayne Rooney's all-time record of 53, and with Kane 26 years old he has plenty of time to do so.</p>
      <p>During the course of the game, Kane overtook England legends Alan Shearer, Nat Lofthouse and Tom Finney in the scoring charts.</p>
      <p>And to add to a number of records, Kane also became the first player to score consecutive hat-tricks at Wembley for England, with his last coming in the 4-0 win against Bulgaria in September.</p>
      <p>Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Marcus Rashford scored the Three Lions' other first-half goals to put a woeful Montenegro to the sword and ensure England were well on their way to securing qualification for Euro 2020.</p>

      <p>As well as breaking England records Kane is also chasing Tottenham's all-time top goalscorers, and is currently fourth on the list behind Jimmy Greaves, Bobby Smith and Martin Chivers.</p>
      <p>He will no doubt be chasing more England goals in the second-half, and will also fancy himself to bag a few more when his side take on Kosovo on Sunday in their final qualification game.</p>
