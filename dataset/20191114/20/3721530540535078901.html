      <p>At today’s X019 event, Rare showed off the next addition to the pirate sandbox <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/sea-of-thieves/38538"><i>Sea of Thieves</i></a>. The next update is The Seabound Soul, a Tall Tale where players join Captain Pendragon to uncover the mystery of a ship called the Ashen Dragon. This tale introduces a new threat in the world of <i>Sea of Thieves</i>, and we can likely expect the story to unfold over the months to come with successive updates.</p>
      <p>Tall Tales are story-heavy quests with puzzle and environmental challenges. They were first introduced <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/5/13/18617975/sea-of-thieves-tall-tales-review-story-mode-characters">in the Anniversary Update for <i>Sea of Thieves</i></a>, and can be accessed from the Adventure mode of the game.</p>
      <p>In addition, <i>Sea of Thieves</i> players will have to contend with a hot new danger: fire. Players can chuck fire bombs at each others’ ships, or start a blaze upon their own vessel by leaving their fish unattended too long on the cooking station.</p>
      <p>The announcement of a new Rare IP, <i>Everwild</i>, isn’t expected to slow development on <i>Sea of Thieves</i>. Rare will continue dedicating resources to <i>Sea of Thieves</i> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/8/14/20804773/sea-of-thieves-monthly-events-dark-relics-new-items-dlc">maintaining the current schedule of monthly events</a>.</p>
      <p>The Seabound Soul will go live in <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fsearch%2F%3Fquery%3Dsea%2520of%2520thieves%26cat_id%3D2636%26typeahead%3Dsea%2520of%2520&amp;subid1=polygon"><i>Sea of Thieves</i></a> on Nov. 20, and will be free for all players.</p>
