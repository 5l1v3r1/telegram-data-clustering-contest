      <p>Police and train bosses have issued a stark warning to commuters after almost 24-hours of torrential rain sparked chaos on the road and rail network.</p>
      <p>British Transport Police, together with Network Rail, urged people not to travel 'unless absolutely necessary' as Birmingham continues to be battered by heavy rain.</p>
      <p>The adverse weather has had led to many trains being delayed or cancelled, after rail lines were left impassable due to floodwater and landslides.</p>
      <p>British Transport Police Birmingham tweeted: "BTP and Network Rail strongly advise people not to travel today unless it's absolutely necessary.</p>

      <p>"Due to adverse weather, a vast amount of trains are being cancelled or delayed due to flooding and landslides."</p>
      <p>And workers attempting to head home for the night told of chaos in the city centre, with gridlocked traffic.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Pictures taken from the car park at Snow Hill show solid queues of traffic heading out of Birmingham.</p>
      <p>One man told us: "My car's in Snow Hill, but the traffic hasn't moved for 90 minutes. It's chaos.</p>

      <p>"The city centre is in total gridlock. I saw one woman storming out of Snow Hill, leaving her car. She said she'd not moved for an hour."</p>
      <p>A number of roads across the city were shut altogether, including the appropriately-named Watery Lane in Solihulll.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>West Midlands Police tweeted it was shut from Knowle to Chadwick End and a number of cars had been abandoned in the floodwater.</p>
      <p>And a Mercedes was also engulfed in a rising ford in Hall Green.</p>

      <p>The notorious flooding flashpoint swallowed up the pricey motor, when the driver tried - and failed - to cross it earlier today.</p>
      <p>The car was left almost completely submerged at the site on Green Road, in Hall Green, despite red flashing signs saying 'caution - do not cross'.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Elsewhere, a string of Birmingham rail services have been impacted by today's torrential downpours.</p>
      <p>The city has been pummelled by rampaging rainfall on Thursday, November 14, as floods sweep the area and the wider West Midlands.</p>

      <p>The region is currently in the midst of a weather warning for rain with the Met Office warning of "danger to life" conditions in the city.</p>
      <p>The alert, which affects swathes of the Midlands, is due to last until 11.45pm tonight.</p>
      <p>The railway line between Hereford and Great Malvern is blocked.</p>
      <p>West Midlands Railway confirmed the line has been battered by flooding and the dreadful conditions today and buses are being put on as a replacement.</p>
      <p>At Snow Hill, passengers were being warned there are no trains between Shirley and Stratford.</p>
      <p>And the line between Snow Hill and Kidderminster is flooded, causing lengthy delays.</p>
      <p>There is expected to be a very brief respite in the rainfall tonight, before it starts again at 9pm.</p>
      <p>Thankfully, the current Met Office forecasts suggests tomorrow the rain will clear to leave overcast skies.</p>
      <p>There will be grey skies through the final working day of the week.</p>
