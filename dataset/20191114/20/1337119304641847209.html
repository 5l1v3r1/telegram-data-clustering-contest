      <p>Microsoft has announced its Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals at its XO19 conference in London. The company will be offering the biggest discounts yet on Xbox One consoles, as well as price cuts on controllers and several games.</p>
      <p>The deals will run on the Microsoft Store from November 24th to December 2nd (that’s a few days earlier than other retailers will kick things off), but Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and Xbox Live Gold members will be able to access these deals even earlier, starting on November 21st.</p>
