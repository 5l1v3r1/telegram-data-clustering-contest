      <h1>Multi-partisanship DLEs will strengthen nation’s democracy - MCE</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T20:12:18+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 20:12</time> by <a rel="author">Fawzia Seidu, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Sunyani, Nov. 14, GNA - The Amendment of Article 55(3) of the 1992 constitution to give way for multi-partisanship local level elections would promote inclusiveness and strengthen the nation’s fledgling democracy, Madam Justina Owusu-Banahene, the Sunyani Municipal Chief Executive (MCE) has said.</p>
      <p>She implored the electorate to come out in their numbers and vote ‘’YES’’ on Tuesday, December 17 to pave the way for the amendment.</p>
      <p>Speaking at a town hall meeting organised by the Assembly in Sunyani, Madam Owusu-Banahene said the introduction of partisanship into the District Level Elections (DLEs) would push Assembly members to work hard to take the development of local communities to the next level.</p>
      <p>She explained that the nation had gone far and achieved a lot in its democratic system of government, saying the amendment of the Article 55(3) would thus help to consolidate the gains of Ghana’s democracy.</p>
      <p>Madam Banahene entreated the electorate not to allow anything to stop them from participating in the DLEs and the Referendum because it bordered on their socio-economic progress as individuals, families and communities.</p>
      <p>Mr. Yaw Badu Amaniampong, the Sunyani Municipal Returning Officer of the Electoral Commission said the Commission would soon open the campaign to enable candidates to sell themselves and their ideologies to the electorate.</p>
