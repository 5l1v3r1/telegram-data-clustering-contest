      <p>According to the statement, the conduct of the upcoming bi-elections in Kogi and Bayelsa states was important, not only for Nigeria, but for the African continent.</p>
      <p>“The United States Government does not support any specific candidate or party in any Nigerian election.</p>
      <p>“The United States supports the Nigerian democratic process itself.</p>
      <p>“We support a genuinely free, fair, transparent, and peaceful electoral process.</p>
      <p>“We, and other democratic nations, will be paying close attention to actions of individuals who interfere in the democratic process or instigate violence against the civilian population before, during, or after the elections.”</p>
      <p><i>News Agency of Nigeria</i> reports that elections are scheduled to hold on Saturday, November 16 in both states.</p>
