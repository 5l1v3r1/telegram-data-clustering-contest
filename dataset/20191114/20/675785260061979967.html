      <p>Christmas may be a whole 41 days away but that hasn't deterred celebrities from already assembling their trees.</p>
      <p>It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas in the homes of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/vicky-pattison">Vicky Pattison</a> , Catherine Tydesley, and Billi Mucklow.</p>
      <p>The telly personalities are among the stars who have decked their homes out for the festive season extremely early following <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jodie-marsh">Jodie Marsh</a> 's festive transformation back in October.</p>
      <p>Former Geordie Shore star Vicky, 31, shared a snap of her towering Christmas tree dressed with shimmering silver baubles, pine cones and fairy lights to her 4.5 million Instagram followers yesterday.</p>

      <p>The snap also teased a glimpse at Vicky's incredible skyline view through her huge glass windows which were decorated with a glitzy garland.</p>
      <p>Also preparing to celebrate the festive season, recently axed <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/strictly-come-dancing">Strictly</a> contestant <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/catherine-tyldesley">Catherine</a> , 36, shared a series of snaps of her glittering tree to social media.</p>

      <p>Her glowing tree featured dramatic star decorations as well as huge reindeer figurines sitting in between branches.</p>
      <p>Unapologetic about putting up her tree almost seven weeks before December 25, the star wrote: "Accuse me of being premature...Christmas makes us happy!"</p>
      <p>The soap star said the sparkling creation wasn't due to her hard work but thanked an amazing team of "elves", while adding she has a separate family tree elsewhere in the house.</p>
      <p>Essex babe <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/billi-mucklow">Billi Mucklow</a> also debuted her home's festive transformation to social media this week.</p>
      <p>The ex-TOWIE star, 31, wowed fans with a photo of her incredible Christmas tree, courtesy of a design company that came to her house to install it.</p>

      <p>The flamboyant tree screamed Christmas excitement and featured candy canes, elves and delicious sweet treats.</p>
      <p>Decorated to a "Willy Wonka and Elves" theme, Billi insisted the extravagant tree was something "fun for the kids."</p>
      <p>With a traditional red, green and white colour scheme, the pretty tree was assembled with cheeky elf legs hanging from the branches, while a green leafy garland in the background also boasted a mini-elf character.</p>
      <p>Taking the crown for the earliest Christmas decorations came courtesy of Jodie Marsh, 40, who put her tree up 11 weeks early.</p>
      <p>The former glamour model left fans totally shocked as she transformed her <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/inside-jodie-marshs-goth-inspired-13904698">Essex home</a> to exude extravagant Christmas spirit and festive flair as early as October.</p>

      <p>The CBB star showed off how she turned her home into a very convincing Santa's grotto with numerous Christmas trees, a gigantic elf in an armchair and an elaborate Christmas village with music, lights and moving ornaments.</p>
      <p>Jodie gave viewers a glimpse of the 'village' with intricate Christmas train sets weaving their way around her lounge, artificial snow and a creepy Jigsaw character.</p>
      <p>She is well known for her love of kickstarting Christmas early and last October she was also mocked for putting up her decorations early.</p>

      <p>Christmas also appeared to arrive early in the house of mummy-to-be <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/lydia-bright">Lydia Bright</a> .</p>
      <p>The former The Only Way Is Essex star asked her 1.1million <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> followers on if she was “too early” to be putting up her tree.</p>
      <p>Lydia shared a video of herself sporting some very festive pyjamas as she was getting into the Xmas spirit before Bonfire Night.</p>
      <p>The star must have questioned her family's eager festive haul as she admitted “So, we know we’re premature, we’re putting up the Christmas tree.”</p>

      <p>The final star to jump on the early Christmas tree bandwagon is Formula 1 heiress <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tamara-ecclestone">Tamara Ecclestone</a> .</p>
      <p>The socialite, 35, put up her Christmas decorations this week alongside her husband Jay Rutland, 38, and their daughter Sophia, five.</p>
      <p>Their London mansion was transformed into a winter wonderland as they decorated a giant Christmas tree with white, gold and silver ornaments.</p>
      <p>Dressed in festive red pyjamas, little Sophia had to stand on a step ladder to reach the tree so she could hang up the decorations.</p>
      <p>Traditionally it is socially acceptable to put your decorations up at the beginning of December but they must come down before January 5.</p>
      <p>A lot of celebs seem to be flouting tradition this year as their homes continue to turn into winter wonderlands earlier and earlier.</p>
