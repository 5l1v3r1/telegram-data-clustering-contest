      <p>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — The Social Security Administration is tightening regulation of Alaska’s representative payee businesses, saying they operate outside the law by charging fees to handle money for disabled residents.</p>
      <p>The Anchorage Daily News reported Thursday that for-profit payee services have been notified their business model is illegal and they face audits.</p>
      <p>A 2018 law expanded monitoring of the businesses that have existed in Alaska since the 1990s.</p>
      <p>Officials say the companies take monthly fees to manage benefit payments for clients and coordinate expenditures such as rent payments and grocery purchases.</p>
      <p>The businesses have been told to convert to nonprofits, which will prevent charging more than $43 per month, half of what most charge.</p>
      <p>Advocates say about 800 vulnerable Alaskans could be left without someone to help manage their money.</p>
