      <p>While season three of “The Crown” is coming to Netflix this weekend, fans won’t get a chance to see Gillian Anderson as Margaret Thatcher until the fourth season. However, that hasn’t stopped Olivia Colman from singing her praises.</p>
      <p>Colman, who has taken up the part of Queen Elizabeth for the next two seasons, told <a href="https://ew.com/tv/2019/11/14/the-crown-gillian-anderson-margaret-thatcher-olivia-colman/"><i>Entertainment Weekly</i></a> that Anderson is “amazing”.</p>

      <p>“The moment she opened her mouth in the read-through, you could feel everyone wanting to do a little silent ‘Yay!’ Because she was so brilliant,” Colman revealed.</p>
      <p>The third season will follow the British royals through the mid-’60s to the mid-’70s, while season four will be the first time viewers will see Thatcher and Emma Corrin’s Lady Diana Spencer (later to be Princess Diana).</p>
      <p>Others to join in season three include Tobias Menzies (Prince Philip), Helena Bonham Carter (Princess Margaret), Emerald Fennell (Camilla Parker Bowles), Erin Doherty (Princess Anne) and Josh O’Connor (Prince Charles).</p>

      <p>“It’s interesting because, series 3, for me, was like doing a historical piece,” said Colman. “Now, it feels less like that and more, I remember that! I remember that voice! I remember that moment! It feels quite different. We had our read-through and to hear the voices of Margaret Thatcher and all of that, it’s quite fun.”</p>
      <p>“The Crown” returns to Netflix on Nov. 17.</p>
