      <h1>HELLTUREL Is Another Unofficial D&amp;D Companion to DESCENT INTO AVERNUS</h1>

      <p>The <b><i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</i></b> community is having a lot of fun with <b><i>Baldur’s Gate: Descent into Avernus</i></b>, and <b>James Introcaso</b> has a companion to the popular hellish adventure. <b><i>Hellturel</i></b> features additional locations in Elturel complete with NPCs and plot hooks, as well as new magic items perfect for characters of level 5-6. I don’t want to say much for fear of spoiling things, but Introcaso does include an Owlbear Butcher Shop.</p>
      <blockquote>Elturel is in Hell. It’s up to you to save it.</blockquote>
      <p>You can purchase <i>Hellturel</i> from <a href="https://www.dmsguild.com/product/289028/Hellturel?affiliate_id=1934285">DMs Guild</a> for $4.95.</p>
