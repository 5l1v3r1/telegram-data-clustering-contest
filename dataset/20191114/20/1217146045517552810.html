      <p>As thanks for helping grow the ProtonMail platform, the encrypted email platform is giving their existing paid subscribers 5GB of extra storage space for free.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, ProtonMail emailed paid subscribers thanking them for their continued support and for helping ProtonMail grow their member base by 10 million people in the last year alone.</p>
      <p>"As a way to say thanks for your early support, we are giving everyone with an existing paid plan 5GB of extra storage for free. For multi-user ProtonMail Professional plans, you will receive 5GB of extra storage per account. Because the bonus is to thank our longtime supporters, it only applies to users who upgraded before Nov. 10, 2019. This bonus storage upgrade is permanent as long as you continue your subscription with us.  "</p>
      <p>While ProtonMail offers free email accounts, they have limited functionality and only have 500MB storage, with their starter emails using 724KB. These emails can be deleted to reclaim that storage.</p>

      <p>The cheapest paid ProtonMail account is € 5.00/mo or € 48.00/yr for the Plus plan, which includes 5GB storage. Additional storage in ProtonMail is €1.00/month or €9/year per GB, so this freebie has a value of €45 if it was paid a year up front.</p>
      <p>ProtonMail subscribers do not have to do anything to get this free storage and it should already be available when they next login.</p>
