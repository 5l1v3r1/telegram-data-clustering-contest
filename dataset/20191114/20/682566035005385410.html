      <p>Hong KongÂ  - <b>Hong Kong</b> football fans drowned out the <b>Chinese</b> national anthem with jeers on Thursday at a <b>World Cup</b> qualifier against Bahrain in the semi-autonomous territory that is beset by protests.</p>
      <p>Footage circulating on social media showed fans roundly booing the Chinese anthem.</p>
      <p>Hong Kong comes under the rule of Beijing, although it is governed under a system allowing greater freedoms.</p>
      <p>Protesters want greater democracy and are kicking back against Beijing and Hong Kong's China-backed government.</p>
      <p>The city has entered its sixth month of demonstrations, and violence is increasing.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, the sparse number of fans to attend the Bahrain qualifier drowned out the Chinese anthem with howls, whistles and jeers with many turning their backs to the pitch.</p>
      <p>The cacophony - in a partially-filled stadium - ended as the announcer implored fans to "please enjoy the game."</p>
      <p>The match, which finished 0-0, was played despite violent protests in the city where some sporting events have been cancelled.</p>
      <p>The WTA Hong Kong open was postponed in September, while a major charity trail run was pulled due to the ongoing political drama.</p>
