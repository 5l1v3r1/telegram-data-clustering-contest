      <h1>Your cable company is so angry at us for telling you about this $59 box that’ll save you hundreds</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T20:16:16+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 20:16</time> by <a rel="author">Maren Estrada</a></address>
      <p>Did you know that your cable company is scamming you out of money every month? Sorry, of course you knew that, so let us rephrase the question: did you know that your cable company is scamming you out of money every month that you don’t actually have to pay? $10 of your monthly bill from your cable ISP is a modem rental fee, and you can eliminate it by simply purchasing your own modem and returning the one you have now to your cable company. Sound good? Check out the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01A1E6BA2?tag=b0c55-20">Motorola MB7420 16×4 Cable Modem</a>. It supports data speeds up to 686Mbps and it’s certified by Comcast XFINITY, Charter Spectrum, Time Warner Cable, Cox, BrightHouse, and more!</p>
