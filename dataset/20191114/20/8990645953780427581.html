      <h1>Garden Party To End Sex Trafficking Set For This Saturday</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T20:20:22+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 20:20</time> by <a rel="author">Dave Diamond</a></address>
      <p>Here in North Texas we hear a lot about drug trafficking, especially along US 287, but there's another kind of trafficking a new nonprofit in town wants you to know more about, human trafficking.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/Southern-Grit-Advocacy-112436370205964/">Southern Grit Advocacy</a>, a brand-new organization here in town, is hosting a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/419052739032805/">Garden Party at Smith's Gardentown Farms</a> this Saturday, November 16th. The event runs from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. and the goal is to raise seed money to prevent, disrupt, and end sex trafficking in Texas and the United States.</p>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/initiatives/human-trafficking?fbclid=IwAR2FWHTjc8Jm6ro-9afvgSoXA05EmmmeRcHjOMkXhQjU8ZUFIQPneO25IIQ">Texas Attorney General's office</a> there are 79,000 incidents of youth and minor sex trafficking and 234,000 incidents of labor trafficking in the state of Texas at any given time. This modern day slavery is nothing more than the exploitation of men, women, and children and Southern Grit Advocacy is hoping for your support in stopping it.</p>
