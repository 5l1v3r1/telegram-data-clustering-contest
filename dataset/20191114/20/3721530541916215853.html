      <p>Microsoft’s big Xbox event saw the reveal of <i>Tell Me Why</i>, a new project by Dontnod, the creators of Life is Strange. Like previous games by the French studio, <i>Tell Me Why</i> is a narrative-focused adventure game. Dontnod boasts that this game has “the first playable videogame hero from a major studio and publisher who is also transgender.”</p>
      <p>The game stars a set of Alaskan twins, Tyler and Alyson Ronan, who have a troubled childhood. You’ll be able to explore memories from both characters, and ultimately get to choose which version of the story you want to believe. <i>Tell Me Why</i> is slated for a summer 2020 release on Xbox One, Windows, and Game Pass. Unlike prior Dontnod titles, <i>Tell Me Why</i> will have a set release schedule that fans will know ahead of time.</p>
      <p>Dontnod says it worked closely with LGBT advocacy group GLAAD to help bring Tyler, the trans protagonist, to life.</p>
      <p>“Tyler is a fully-realized, endearing character, whose story is not reduced to simplistic trans tropes,” says Nick Adams, director of transgender representation at GLAAD.</p>
      <p><b>Update:</b> <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/glaad-microsoft-collaborate-major-playable-transgender-game-character-1254411">Dontnod tells The Hollywood Reporter</a> that Tyler is voiced by August Black, a trans actor. “The vocal cast was a priority from day one and it was important that we cast in a representative and authentic way,” says Xbox senior creative director Joseph Staten. “Not only did we cast a trans actor for the English part, but we’re working hard to find people in the localized languages as well and make sure we have a strong, representative performance no matter where in the world you might play the game.”</p>
