      <h1>Trump flips New York-based appeals court as Steven Menashi confirmed</h1>

      <p>With the confirmation of White House attorney Steven Menashi to the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, another federal appeals court has a majority of Republican-appointed judges.</p>
      <p>Menashi, whose nomination was vehemently opposed by Democrats and civil rights groups, was confirmed by the Senate, 51-41. Republican Maine Sen. Susan Collins joined Democrats in opposing the 40-year-old's nomination. The 2nd Circuit now has seven judges tapped by Republican presidents and six named by Democrats.</p>
      <p>The 2nd Circuit is the second federal appeals court Trump has remade to have a majority of judges appointed by GOP presidents. In March, the president <u><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/courts/trump-flips-federal-appeals-court-with-bridgegate-attorney">flipped </a></u>the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals with the confirmation of Paul Matey.</p>
      <p>Trump is also close to shifting the balance of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to majority Republican-appointed judges, with the Senate expected to vote on the nominations of Robert Luck and Barbara Lagoa in the coming days. He has also brought the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, considered to be the country’s most liberal, <u><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/courts/trump-makes-dent-in-political-alignment-of-liberal-9th-circuit">closer to parity</a></u>.</p>
      <p>Senate Democrats took issue with Menashi’s past writings and unwillingness to answer questions about his work in the White House Counsel’s Office, including his role in developing the Trump administration’s immigration policies, specifically family separations.</p>
      <p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, called Menashi “one of the most contemptible nominees to come before the Senate” during his tenure and a “disgrace to the seat once held by the great Thurgood Marshall.”</p>
      <p>But Republicans and conservative judicial groups accused Democrats of running a smear campaign against Menashi.</p>
      <p>Trump, with the assistance of the GOP-controlled Senate, has seen tremendous success with remarking the federal courts since taking office. He has appointed more than 150 judges to the federal bench, including two Supreme Court justices and 46 appeals court judges.</p>
      <p>Many of Trump’s appointees are in their 40s and 50s, ensuring they will serve for decades to come.</p>
