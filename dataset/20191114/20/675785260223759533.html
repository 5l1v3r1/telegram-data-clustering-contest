      <h1>Roy Keane details 4am hotel fight with ex-Man Utd teammate Peter Schmeichel</h1>
      <h2>The former Manchester United captain offered up a tale from his past as he spoke about England's Raheem Sterling situation</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T20:00:24+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 20:00</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Richards, https://www.facebook.com/AARichards/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/roy-keane">Roy Keane</a> has revealed that he and Peter Schmeichel once became embroiled in a 4am hotel fight during their <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> days.</p>
      <p>Former United captain Keane was giving his take on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/roy-keane-questions-gareth-southgates-20883336">England's Raheem Sterling situation,</a> after the Man City star was axed by boss Gareth Southgate.</p>
      <p>The Three Lions chief left Sterling out of his squad for Thursday night’s encounter with Montenegro at Wembley, following a canteen bust-up with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> ’s Joe Gomez on Monday.</p>
      <p>That decision, and the public statement that followed, somewhat overshadowed England’s 1000th fixture.</p>
      <p>And speaking on ITV, Keane offered up an incident from his past, during his time with United, and how it played out.</p>

      <p>"I’ve previously had a fight with a player - Peter Schmeichel - in a hotel," declared the Irishman. "Obviously [it] was in the lobby, it was about four o’clock in the morning, there wasn’t many people around.</p>
      <p>“We got pulled by the manager [Sir Alex Ferguson], he said we were both a disgrace.</p>
      <p>"To be fair to Peter, he apologised. But we moved on, it never affected us as teammates."</p>

      <p>Keane also reckons that the incident involving Sterling earlier this week could have been kept quiet by the England camp.</p>
      <p>"I think they’ve made a bigger deal than what it really is. I think it’s all part of the game," said Keane.</p>
      <p>“I suppose we’re quite quick to criticise players for not caring.</p>
      <p>"Obviously Raheem is quite upset about the previous day - I’m not patting him on the back for going at one of his teammates, but I think Gareth [Southgate] could have played it down quite easily by saying ‘it’s no big deal, we move on’.</p>
      <p>“He’s had to speak about it for three days now."</p>
