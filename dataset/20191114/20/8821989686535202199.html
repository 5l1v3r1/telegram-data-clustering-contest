      <h1>Paul McCartney Has a New Perspective on Beatles’ ‘Let It Be’ Film</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T20:15:26+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 20:15</time> by <a rel="author">Corey Irwin</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/paul-mccartney/">Paul McCartney</a>’s view of the <i><a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/beatles-let-it-be/">Let It Be</a></i> film seems to be changing, roughly 50 years after its original creation.</p>
      <p>“Because it was so close to the <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/the-beatles/">Beatles</a>’ breakup, my impression of the film was of a sad moment,” McCartney admitted during a conversation with <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/8543413/paul-mccartney-billboard-cover-story-interview-2019"><i>Billboard</i></a>. Now, with director <a href="https://screencrush.com/tags/peter-jackson/">Peter Jackson</a> turning 58 hours of archival footage into a new <i>Let It Be</i> documentary, the perspective seems to be shifting. “The director tells me that the overall impression is of friends working together,” McCartney noted.</p>
      <p>This isn’t the first time fans have heard about the latest <i>Let It Be</i> project. The documentary was <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/beatles-peter-jackson-film/">announced</a> in January, with Jackson boasting that the finished product will be “the ultimate ‘fly on the wall’ experience.” "It’s like a time machine transports us back to 1969, and we get to sit in the studio watching these four friends make great music together," the filmmaker declared.</p>
      <p>Though it was recorded before <i><a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/beatles-abbey-road/">Abbey Road</a></i>, <i>Let It Be</i> was the Beatles’ final release, coming out shortly after the band’s <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/the-beatles-called-it-quits-42-years-ago-today/">breakup in 1970</a>. Footage of the group creating the LP was originally shot for a television documentary, and was conceptualized to accompany a concert broadcast. The project evolved into a feature film, which briefly screened in theaters before disappearing from circulation and becoming a rare VHS collectible. Jackson is assembling his new piece from the raw material of that original project.</p>
      <p>"After reviewing all the footage and audio that Michael Lindsay-Hogg shot 18 months before they broke up, it’s simply an amazing historical treasure trove," the Academy Award-winning director remarked, adding that the viewing experience will be “funny, uplifting and surprisingly intimate."</p>
      <p>No release has been set for the documentary, with McCartney only <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/8543413/paul-mccartney-billboard-cover-story-interview-2019">promising</a> that “something’s going to come out from that footage.” <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/beatles-peter-jackson-film/">Reports</a> earlier this year suggested that Jackson's film would be followed by a restored edition of the original <i>Let It Be</i> movie, but McCartney made no reference to this in the new interview.</p>

      <h3>The Best Song on Every Beatles Album</h3>

      </figure>
      <h4>'Please Please Me' (1963): "I Saw Her Standing There"</h4>
      <p>The opening song on the Beatles' debut album and the B-side of their first U.S. Capitol single. Any wonder why it holds such a special place in fans' hearts?</p>
      <hr/>

        <img src="https://townsquare.media/site/295/files/2018/10/11-All-My-Loving-Beatles.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h4>'With the Beatles' (1963): "All My Loving"</h4>
      <p>An early Beatles original that was never released as a single but became one of their most popular songs just as Beatlemania was taking hold.</p>
      <hr/>

      </figure>
      <h4>'A Hard Day's Night' (1964): "A Hard Day's Night"</h4>
      <p>The title track to the group's first movie begins with a chiming chord that rings like a bell signaling a new era. And in a sense it was: the first Beatles album to include all original material by Lennon and McCartney.</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>'Help!' (1965): "Yesterday"</h4>
      <p>McCartney wasn't even 23 when he recorded "Yesterday," one of the most covered songs in music history. He reflects like a man twice his age on what is basically a solo track (producer George Martin brought in some strings). One of the Beatles' first steps toward maturity ... and a timeless classic.</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>'Beatles for Sale' (1964): "Eight Days a Week"</h4>
      <p>Beatlemania was draining the group by the end of 1964, when their fourth album in a year came out. You can hear the strain throughout Beatles for Sale, but "Eight Days a Week" still shimmers.</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>'Rubber Soul' (1965): "In My Life"</h4>
      <p>McCartney had "Yesterday"; Lennon had "In My Life." He had just turned 25 when he recorded this plaintive song about looking back. The Beatles had grown up immensely since "She Loves You" and "I Want to Hold Your Hand." "In My Life" was just the start.</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>'Revolver' (1966): "Tomorrow Never Knows"</h4>
      <p>Recorded at the start of the Revolver sessions, "Tomorrow Never Knows" is the sound of the Beatles reinventing themselves and modern music in the process. Tape loops, backward guitars and an abstract wall of noise serve as the bedrocks of a truly revolutionary work. Nothing was the same after this.</p>

      <h4>'Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band' (1967): "A Day in the Life"</h4>
      <p>The Beatles' vision, ambition and execution flawlessly come together in five and a half breathtaking minutes. It's the culmination of the landmark Sgt. Pepper's LP and of the band's career, stitched together from two separate songs. Pop art doesn't get more sublime than this.</p>

        <img src="https://townsquare.media/site/295/files/2018/10/5-I-Am-the-Walrus-Beatles.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h4>'Magical Mystery Tour' (1967): "I Am the Walrus"</h4>
      <p>A bit of lyrical surrealism by Lennon that perfectly suits the Beatles' post-Sgt. Pepper's creative rush. Loaded with sound effects and distorted side trips, "I Am the Walrus" is a grand aural experiment.</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>'The Beatles' (1968): "While My Guitar Gently Weeps"</h4>
      <p>Harrison's tour de force is a sly dig at the other Beatles during one of their most tumultuous periods. The White Album is basically four solo albums with assist from the other members and occasionally outside guests – like Eric Clapton, who contributes a searing guitar solo here.</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>'Yellow Submarine' (1968): "Hey Bulldog"</h4>
      <p>Recorded before the White Album but not released until the Yellow Submarine soundtrack a year later, "Hey Bulldog" belies the difficult times ahead with its playful tone, which includes Lennon and McCartney barking like dogs.</p>
      <hr/>

        <img src="https://townsquare.media/site/295/files/2018/10/2-Something-Beatles.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h4>'Abbey Road' (1969): "Something"</h4>
      <p>Harrison was finally given an A-side of a Beatles single, pulled from the final album they recorded. It went to No. 1. A majestic love song better than anything on the LP written by his two more established bandmates.</p>

        <img src="https://townsquare.media/site/295/files/2018/10/1-Let-It-Be-Beatles.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h4>'Let It Be' (1970): "Let It Be"</h4>
      <p>McCartney's tribute to his late mother doubles as a meditative hymn to the final days of the Beatles. They knew the end was near. "Let It Be" is their somber farewell.</p>
