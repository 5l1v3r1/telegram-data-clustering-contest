      <h1>Queen's Park end their 152-year amateur status in historic vote</h1>
      <h2>The League Two side held a historic vote on Monday to define the status of the club after over 150 years as an amateur side.</h2>

      <p>Queen's Park have voted to end their status as an amateur club, marking the start of a new era for the historic Glasgow side.</p>
      <p>It was a landslide as club members voted in favour of turning professional, meaning there are now no amateur clubs among the 42 in the SPFL.</p>
      <p>The club's motto 'Ludere Causa Ludendi', translating to 'To play for the sake of playing' stems back to its foundation in 1867, when they played a pivotal role in the formation of the Scottish leagues.</p>
      <p>As clubs around them adapted their status to move with the times, however, the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/spfl-league-two">League Two</a> side remained amateur into the modern era, and were to date the only amateur club in the senior leagues.</p>
      <p>There were concerns for the sustainability for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/queens-park-fc">Queen’s Park</a> as an amateur entity, however. Alack of compensation for players such as <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/andy-robertson">Andy Robertson</a> and Lawrence Shankland led club members to consider going professional, in a bid to protect the club from losing their top players free of charge.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Club president Gerry Crawley was among those to call for a vote on going professional back in July, and after the issue proved divisive among club members and fans alike, members were invited to decide the matter democratically on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The result of the vote means that the club will be permitted to sign players to part-time and full-time contracts for the first time in their history.</p>
      <p>The Glasgow club were once one of Scottish football's driving forces, winning ten Scottish cups - less than only <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> and Rangers - but now find themselves in the basement tier of the SPFL.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/queens-park-fc">Queen's Park</a> find themselves amid a period of transition, with the vote coming ahead of a move out of Hampden Park from next season. They will play their games at Lesser Hampden from 2020 onwards.</p>
