      <h1>Halo: Reach Joins the Master Chief Collection on December 3</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T20:56:54+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 20:56</time> by <a rel="author">Rich Stanton</a></address>
      <p>Bungie’s final Halo game was both farewell and prequel to a series the studio had made great. <i>Halo: Reach</i> also gave some indication of what was to come, building its (excellent) campaign around a squad of Spartans and 4-player co-op. The less said about jetpacks in multiplayer the better, but Reach got so much right.</p>
      <p>Tonight at X019 Brian Jarrard of 343 Industries, the current custodians of the franchise, announced that Reach is joining its extended family in Halo: The Master Chief Collection on December 3. The game will also be available for individual purchase at $9.99 (UK price TBC), and the news came with a shiny trailer showing off all those high-res Mjolnir textures.</p>

      <p>It’s been a long road here for the Master Chief Collection, which launched years ago in an abject state. To 343’s credit the studio subsequently doubled-down on supporting the game and, while progress has been slower than fans might like, it’s been maintained and updated with some care. Reach arguably marks the ‘completion’ of the project, and 343 should probably <a href="https://www.kotaku.co.uk/2019/04/14/its-pizza-time-in-halo-reach">get ready for lots more pizza</a>.</p>
