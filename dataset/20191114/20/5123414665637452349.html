      <p><a href="https://www.magneticmag.com/tag/green-velvet">Green Velvet</a> is breathing some new life once again in his seminal track “Bigger Than Prince.” With this batch of remixes, he tabbed <a href="https://www.magneticmag.com/tag/siege/">Siege</a> for an up-tempo house mix, <a href="https://www.magneticmag.com/tag/alan-fitzpatrick/">Alan Fitzpatrick</a> for a thumping techno mix and <a href="https://www.magneticmag.com/tag/jamie-jones/">Jamie Jones</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.magneticmag.com/tag/darius-syrossian/">Darius Syrossian</a> together for their own take on the track. The full remix EP will arrive tomorrow, November 15, on <a href="https://www.magneticmag.com/tag/circus-recordings/">Circus Recordings</a>, but we are happy to premiere the Jamie Jones &amp; Darius Syrossian remix today.</p>
      <p>If Darius Syrossian remixing “Bigger Than Prince” seems familiar, that is because he did back in 2014. Now he teams up with Jamie Jones to add a different take on the Green Velvet track.  </p>
      <p>Syrossian’s 2014 remix went heavy on the acid, but with Jamie Jones he takes a more stripped back approach to the record. They add a strong and heavy techno groove, isolating the kick at points with light fx rumbling underneath before a gritty synth line take over the track. Green Velvet’s vocals remain a focal part of the record.  </p>
      <p>The batch of remixes will be released tomorrow, but until then stream the Jamie Jones and Darius Syrossian remix now. And as Green Velvet would like, check your ego at the door. Stop walking around like you are bigger than Prince. </p>
