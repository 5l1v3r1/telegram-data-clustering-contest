      <p>Princess Aljohara Al-Saud is a partner at Henning Larsen studio in Riyadh and has served as the design architect for a number of the Scandinavian company’s projects in Saudi Arabia and the wider region, many of which strike a balance between Arabian and Scandinavian culture.</p>
      <p>One of the company’s first projects in the Kingdom was the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Riyadh, designed by Henning Larsen — after whom the company is named — and completed in 1984. </p>
      <p>Princess Aljohara has a special interest in promoting women’s positions in Saudi society. </p>
      <p>She is actively involved in a network that supports women’s ambitions of achieving executive positions in the private sector. </p>
      <p>Princess Aljohara is also a member of the advisory board of the Alfaisal University Department of Engineering.</p>
      <p>Recently Princess Aljohara spoke at a Misk Global Forum session called “Dinosaur or future-fit? Careers in a post-job era.” She discussed some of the hardships she faced when she first started working.</p>
      <p>“Few organizations at that time had women in their offices,” she said. Undeterred, she “saw an opportunity and grabbed it.”</p>
      <p>Princess Aljohara said: “I progressed and started as a junior architect. My skills gradually developed and I became a business development manager.”</p>
