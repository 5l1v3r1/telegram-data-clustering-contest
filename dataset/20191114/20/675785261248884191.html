      <h1>EastEnders' Sharon tells dangerous lie about dead Mel which could come back to haunt her</h1>
      <h2>EastEnders aired the shock death of Mel Owen on Thursday, and Sharon Mitchell used it to hide her baby secret from Phil</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T20:12:59+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 20:12</time> by <a rel="author">Charlotte Tutton</a></address>
      <p>EastEnders' Sharon Mitchell wasted no time in getting Phil to believe that Mel Owen wasn't to be trusted, moments on from her tragic death - despite two people potentially being able to deny her words.</p>
      <p>Viewers were stunned on Thursday night as Mel, played by actress Tamzin Outhwaite, was killed off - with her making her first appearance on the BBC soap over 20 years ago.</p>
      <p>The end of a two-year return to Walford saw the character die, despite initially surviving a car crash.</p>
      <p>Pregnant Sharon had managed to free her enemy from the burning wreckage, only for the grief-stricken character, who lost her son Hunter in September, to die moments later.</p>
      <p>Wanting to get to Hunter who she believed was in the car, she walked out into the path of an incoming lorry.</p>

      <p>After being met by husband Phil at the hospital, Sharon was discharged and the pair returned home.</p>
      <p>But Phil couldn't get his head around what had happened, and where Mel was headed to.</p>
      <p>With them both on the road at the same time and it clear Mel was heading for the airport where Phil had just landed, Sharon knew it was only a matter of time before questions were asked.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>She's currently hiding the fact that her unborn baby isn't Phil's child, with her fling Keanu Taylor the real father.</p>
      <p>Mel discovered this recently leading to a blackmail plot, with her finally deciding to tell Phil and his daughter Louise, Keanu's fiancée, the truth - tragedy struck though as she crashed her car before she got the chance.</p>
      <p>With Mel dead after the later incident, it was now Sharon's word against Lisa Fowler's, with Mel having told her about the baby shortly before she died - while Lisa doesn't know Keanu is the dad.</p>

      <p>As Sharon sat Phil down, she filled his mind with lies about Mel as well as suggestions she was saying "weird things" in her grief for Hunter.</p>
      <p>Clearly ready to repeat this if questioned over the baby, Sharon also lied to Phil that she had decided to sell her share of the club and Mel wanted Phil to know about it, and that this was why they were on the road.</p>
      <p>Fans of course know Mel had forced Sharon to sell up to Ruby Allen as part of her blackmail plot. There's also the fact Ruby knew it was Mel who offered to sell up, while she also knew Sharon wasn't keen on it.</p>

      <p>But Sharon claimed: "You haven't seen her these last few weeks, you don't know what she's been like. She lost it Phil, big time.</p>
      <p>"All the things she was coming out with to me and to Lisa, slanging matches on the Square. She found out I sold to Ruby."</p>
      <p>She added: "Once Mel found out, that was her chance do what she'd been doing for weeks - cause even more trouble."</p>
      <p>Sharon was sure Phil had bought her claims, while he seemed pretty confused over the entire situation.</p>
