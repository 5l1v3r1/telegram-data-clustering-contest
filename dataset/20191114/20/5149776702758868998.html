      <p>Roads were closed, buses were diverted and front gardens were under water as Nottinghamshire was battered by heavy rain for 13 hours.</p>
      <p>The Met Office issued a 'yellow warning' for the county at 9am on Thursday, November 14, and even areas of the city centre were flooded.</p>
      <p>Roads were closed in Bestwood, Bramcote, West Bridgford, Lambley, Farndon, Hockerton, Caunton, Newark, Normanton-on-Soar, Retford, Woodborough, Oxton, Shireoaks, Southwell, Tollerton and West Drayton.</p>
      <p>The River Trent in Newark burst its banks and Victoria Embankment almost reached breaking point.</p>
      <p>More than a dozen bus routes in Nottingham were affected, with some not able to serve specific stops as rain hammered the region.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/traffic-travel">Nottingham City Transport</a> had to close its Gotham garage and transfer buses to Trent Bridge after the garage flooded.</p>
      <p>One of the worst affected areas was Lambley, where parents were trapped in their homes and could not pick their children up from school.</p>
      <p>Andrew Bray, 43, who lives in Main Street, said: "It is surprising. We have only lived in the village since 2018 and we were told floods happen once every 10 years.</p>
      <p>"We have had them twice in five months. Some residents are trapped in their homes and could not pick their kids up from school.</p>
      <p>"I am at the top of the hill but friends I know where the water flows are trapped and can't drive out of the village."</p>

      <p>Gordon Street, in West Bridgford, was also severely affected, with cars, front drives and gardens under water.</p>
      <p>Nick and Penny Gale, who have lived in the street for 20 years, said: "This is the worst it has been. Whenever we get heavy rain you see surface water coming up the gullies in the road.</p>
      <p>"Whatever the issue is, it needs to be sorted because it has been a long time since we have been saying there is a problem.</p>
      <p>"The water has been very close but has not flooded a house. That's why it is not being sorted."</p>

      <p>Rowena Padamsey, who has lived on the street for four years, said: "It is becoming more regular. The last time it happened, my daughter was playing in the road and she was up to her knees in water.</p>
      <p>"It came up to the doorstep. It is not fair for people who own their properties."</p>
      <p>Tania Clifton-Forbes, manager of the the Test Match pub, said police had told residents that if the rain continued, as a precaution, they may have to evacuate people from their homes.</p>
      <p>Long Eaton School was forced to close, and Worksop Library and Worksop Registration Office remained closed because of earlier flooding.</p>

      <p>Motorists and buses were stuck in flood water in Shakespeare Street and Mansfield Road, Nottingham, as water cascaded down the streets, creating a pool near to intu Victoria Centre.</p>
      <p>Carolyn Pendleton, travel consultant at Laver Holidays, in Mansfield Road, watched as flood water came close to the foot of the shop.</p>
      <p>She said: "I got here at 9am and it was fine but by 11am, I got up and went to look and could not believe how much there was.</p>
      <p>"It has got worse through the day. I knew how bad it was when a lady came in and she had been walking in it and her trousers were wet up to her knees.</p>
      <p>"It came really close to the door and then it ebbed away.</p>
      <p>"We are quite surprised. I have just been keeping my eye on it all day. At one point you could not see the pavement around the island."</p>

      <p>David Benjamin, 22, supervisor for the Six Barrels pub, in Mansfield Road, close to where the flooding occurred added: "It has been insane.</p>
      <p>"It is quite scary - you don’t get it in the city centre. People are driving and so many accidents can happen. We have seen cars driving and you can only make out half the car."</p>
      <p>The flood water was finally drained by the city council's highways team.</p>
      <p>Noel Street, close to Forest Recreation Ground, and the Wilkinson Street tram depot were also affected.</p>

      <p>The yellow warning is in place until 10pm tonight.</p>
      <p>Inspector Rob Taylor, of <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/crime">Nottinghamshire Police</a>, said: "There will be a lot more rainfall, so the risk of further flooding remains and we all need to be ready and prepared for this.</p>
      <p>"All blue-light services are in contact with each other, as well as the Environment Agency and Met Office, and we’re monitoring rainfall and how the small tributaries are responding.</p>
      <p>"The advice to residents remains to act quickly if their home is affected by flooding and go to a safe place, whether that is with family and friends or a rest centre.</p>
      <p>"With water on the roads and temperatures due to fall overnight, we’re also warning drivers to take extra care on the county’s roads."</p>

      <p>A spokesman for Nottingham City Council said: "Highways crews have been out and about in Nottingham to help keep the city moving after constant heavy rainfall has caused roads to flood in some areas.</p>
      <p>"All of Nottingham’s 40,000-plus gullies – the metal grates seen in the street – are cleared annually, with known problem areas targeted more frequently.</p>
      <p>It’s these problem areas that have been the focus of attention throughout the day. Often gullies aren’t necessarily blocked but flooding still occurs due to the sheer volume of rain falling.</p>
      <p>"Additional highways and street-cleaning crews will be on standby to provide extra support if needed over the next few hours."</p>
