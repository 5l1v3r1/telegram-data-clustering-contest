        <b>Arsenal could soon face a fight to retain Hector Bellerin’s services after the full-back’s agent admitted the player was dreaming of a move overseas.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Gunners have plunged from one crisis to another this season <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/double-winner-says-emerys-time-is-up-and-accuses-arsenal-of-lying"><b>as pressure has mounted on Unai Emery</b></a> and amid the shambolic actions of midfielder Granit Xhaka, <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/ruthless-emery-strips-granit-xhaka-of-arsenal-captaincy"><b>who was stripped of the captaincy after swearing at his own supporters.</b></a></p>
      <p>Their concerns seemed to mount on Thursday evening when <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/two-reasons-cited-as-barcelona-confidence-grows-over-aubameyang-raid"><b>it was suggested two factors could force them to sell talisman striker and recently-appointed skipper Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang in January</b></a>, but that appears to be the tip of the iceberg with worrying reports now emerging over Bellerin.</p>
      <p>“At the moment he is focused on the team’s commitments, comes from a bad injury and is returning to his levels,” Albert Botines told <i>Sky Sports Italia.</i></p>
      <p>“He likes Italy, the interest of an Italian club has been there but I can’t reveal it,” he added. “He has a long contract and it won’t be easy to take him away from Arsenal. He is vice-captain, we will see how the season will go.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/tag/hector-bellerin"><b>Bellerin</b> </a>has been with Arsenal since arriving as a 16-year-old and news that he is turning his thoughts to a move elsewhere will present Emery with yet another unwanted headache in what is turning out to be a tumultuous season.</p>
      <p>The under-fire Spaniard, however, has at least received some backing from striker Alexandre Lacazette, <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/lacazette-says-hes-sure-arsenal-officials-are-behind-emery"><b>who insisted he was sure Emery had the support of the club’s hierarchy.</b></a></p>
      <p>“We’re working together every day on a constant basis to pick up the slack,” he told the<i> club website</i>.</p>
      <p>“The group definitely supports the coach and I’m sure the club does as well.</p>
      <p>“We’re a very tight group, and we’re doing everything we can to improve.”</p>
