      <p>On Thursday’s broadcast of MSNBC’s “Live,” 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) reacted to the shooting at Saugus High School in Santa Clarita, CA.</p>
      <p>Harris said, “Mitch McConnell needs to convene the Senate. We have a bill that recognizes that we don’t need to take everyone’s guns, but we need to have smart gun safety laws. And they have been a failure, Stephanie, a failure, of the United States Congress to have the courage to act. It is pathetic. It is pathetic that people yield to a gun lobby on an issue that affects all of our children. These babies and I mean those elementary, middle, and high school kids could care less who their parents voted for. They’re terrified, and we need to act. This is outrageous.”</p>
      <p>She continued, “I have looked at autopsy photographs. I have hugged the parents of murdered children. This has to stop being a partisan issue, an intellectual issue, an ideological issue. I dare the people that stand on circumstances. I dare them to look at the autopsy photos of their babies, I dare them, and then vote their conscience. Enough. Enough.”</p>
