      <h1>Rand Paul Considers Forcing Vote Seeking Hunter Biden Testimony</h1>
      <h2>Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) signaled Thursday that he could force a vote in the U.S. Senate that would impel Hunter Biden to testify as part of the House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump.</h2>

      <p>“I believe very strongly the president should be able to call his own witnesses,” Paul told reporters on Capitol Hill, reported <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/14/rand-paul-hunter-biden-impeachment-trial-070948">Politico</a>. “The rules that are put forward will be amendable, so yes I will consider strongly that the president should get his full due process, which to me means being in his own witnesses.”</p>
      <p>The vote would require a majority, which meaning Democrats would need several Republicans to cross party lines to defeat the measure — an unlikely scenario as GOP lawmakers in the upper chamber remain united against impeachment, minus such members as Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT), Susan Collins (R-ME), and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK).</p>
      <p>The House Democrats’ impeachment probe was prompted after a so-called “whistleblower” — a CIA analyst who worked with then-vice president Joe Biden in the Obama White House — filed a complaint in which it was claimed President Donald Trump committed wrongdoing by requesting the leader of Ukraine to probe allegations of corruption against the Biden family. The younger Biden <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hunter-biden-ukraine/what-hunter-biden-did-on-the-board-of-ukrainian-energy-company-burisma-idUSKBN1WX1P7">was paid</a> $83,333 monthly as a board member of Burisma Holdings, a prominent Ukrainian gas firm marked by allegations of corruption, while his father was vice president. The elder Biden played a key role in forcing out former Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin as he was investigating Burisma. The former vice president <a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/436816-joe-bidens-2020-ukrainian-nightmare-a-closed-probe-is-revived">boasted</a> to the Council of Foreign Relations last year that he had threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid unless the prosecutor was fired.</p>
      <p>Paul’s comments come after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/14/rand-paul-hunter-biden-impeachment-trial-070948">called on</a> fellow Republicans on Wednesday to avoid calling for testimony that could spark a showdown with Senate Democrats.</p>
