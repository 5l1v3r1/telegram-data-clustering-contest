      <p>Microsoft revealed earlier this year that it’s bringing its classic <i>Halo </i>game collection to PC, and adding <i>Halo: Reach</i> to the entire <i>Halo: The Master Chief Collection. </i>While the company has been running beta tests for <i>Halo: Reach</i> on PC in recent months, it’s now arriving on PC on December 3rd.</p>
      <p>Microsoft is taking its time to get <i>Halo</i> on PC right, and that means games will appear in stages. <i>Halo: Reach</i> is the first, and the rest will follow in chronological order. Microsoft is also tweaking the games to include field of view sliders and make sure the mouse and keyboard controls feel good.</p>
      <p>All six games in <i>Halo: The Master Chief Collection</i> can now be purchased in a bundle on Steam or through the Microsoft Store for $39.99, and <i>Halo: Reach</i> will be available separately for $9.99 if you don’t want to wait for the full collection to launch on PC. This full <i>Halo </i>collection is also part of Xbox Game Pass.</p>
