      <h1>The numbers behind Harry Kane’s incredible England record to delight Tottenham Hotspur fans</h1>
      <h2>Spurs news takes a look at the striker's record for the Three Lions</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T20:36:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 20:36</time> by <a rel="author">Rob Guest</a></address>
      <p>Harry Kane has continued his excellent form in front of goal this season after scoring a first-half hat-trick for England in their Euro 2020 qualifier against Montenegro.</p>
      <p>Despite Spurs' struggles so far in the opening months of the 2019/20 Premier League campaign, the 26-year-old has found the net for the Lilywhites on a regular basis.</p>
      <p>It's not just for his club where he's had a massive impact on proceedings as he's scored some important goals for his country in their quest to qualify for next year's tournament.</p>
      <p>Hitting four in England's two games in the September international break, he then followed it up with a further two goals in October as he scored against the Czech Republic and Bulgaria.</p>
      <p>It was in the game in Sofia against the latter where he showed that he's so much more than just a goalscorer for Spurs and England as he registered three assists in the 6-0 drubbing.</p>

      <p>Getting his first of the night against Montenegro on Thursday evening at Wembley as he nodded home Ben Chilwell's free-kick, his goal was the 13th he had been directly involved in for England in their Euro 2020 qualifiers.</p>
      <p>Only Russia's Artem Dzyuba was ahead of him on 14, yet it didn't take long for the Spurs ace to surpass the striker as he headed home another before finding the corner with a low shot in the 37th minute to complete his hat-trick.</p>
