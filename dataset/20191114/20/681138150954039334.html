      <p>Here is our round-up of Christmas ice rinks.</p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>The ice rink will be in Great Eastern Square, Hamilton Road IP11 7DY from Friday December 20 until Monday December 23.

      <p>Come and enjoy some ice skating by the sea in Felixstowe. Admission is free (including free skating). No need to book, just turn up.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Hadleigh:</b>
      </p>
      <p>Hadleigh's Pop-Up ice rink will be in the car park by the town's library on Saturday December 7. Angela Gregg, from Hadleigh Town Council, said: "We can't replicate the scenes from those Dickens novels or Christmas cards, but in our own small way we just thought that we ought to try our very hardest to deliver a special Christmas event to herald in a new comittment to celebrate Christmas in our community. And you only have to look at the response in bookings, to see that it's something that people equate with Christmas fun.</p>
      <p>"We have had incredible support from the residents and businesses in and around Hadleigh; from raffle prize donations to actual cash money; people giving their valuable time freely and contributing their services without charge."</p>
      <p>Hadleigh is the perfect setting for a Christmas skate and I would like to reiterate our invitation to book yourself a twirl for £5, by contacting cllr.gregg@hadleightowncouncil.co.uk and there will be spaces available on the night.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Aldeburgh:</b>
      </p>
      <p>The town's festive skating rink is being created at the Jubilee Hall, off Cragg Path, as part of the Aldeburgh Dickensian Christmas Festival which takes place throughout town on Saturday December 7. The Festive Skating Rink will be open on Friday December 6, Saturday 7 and Sunday 8 so there will be plenty of opportunity for everyone to enjoy a skating session (or more) and perhaps combine it with some Christmas shopping and a snack, lunch or supper in one of the many excellent restaurants and cafés in the historic seaside town.</p>
      <p>There will be Christmas music, a snow machine, polar bear and penguin skating aids for the little ones and our festive bar will be offering mulled wine, wine, beer, soft drinks, hot chocolate and seasonal treats.</p>
      <p>The Festive Skating Rink is suitable for ages 4+ and children of 12 years and under must be accompanied by an adult. Skates will be provided as part of the ticket price. It is recommended that you arrive at least 10 minutes prior to your ticketed skating session as sessions cannot be extended for those arriving late.</p>
