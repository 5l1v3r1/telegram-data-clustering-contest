      <p>The team behind the hit ITV series 'Long Lost Family' have provided many tear jerking moments over the years as relatives are reunited after decades apart or come face to face for the first time.</p>
      <p>And now, Wall to Wall Media, the makers of Long Lost family, and Who Do You Think You Are are currently casting for a new show titled Long Lost Loves, and they are seeking pining lovers in the Plymouth area.</p>
      <p>Statistics show that one in five people long to get back with an old flame, and the new show will offer those keen to be reunited with an old love another chance after spending years apart.</p>
      <p>Told against a backdrop of rich social history and illustrated with captivating archive, the programme will feature stories of love affairs broken apart by circumstance - be it war, racial prejudice, social divide, immigration, religious beliefs or cultural taboos.</p>
      <p>Hosts Nicky Campbell and Davina McCall will be meeting those who are desperate to track down their lost loves. Whether it’s to rekindle a passion they’ve kept inside their heart for decades – or to lovingly reconnect with a childhood sweetheart who has been hard to forget.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, Plymouth Live told the story of an <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/news/plymouth-news/war-hero-finds-long-lost-2470500">incredible war hero</a> who was reunited with his long-lost sweet heart after 60 years apart.</p>
      <p>William Brown, known to his friends as Bill, was determined to find the woman he met in 1958, who was then called Joyce Fowler.</p>
      <p>The 78-year-old from Cambridge spent over 60-years searching for the "very pretty, kind and caring" Joyce, who lived in Plymouth and never gave up.</p>

      <p>The pair met when they were serving at the British Military Hospital in Singapore - Joyce was in the British Army as a nurse and Bill was in the Royal Army Medical Corps.</p>
      <p>Bill said he always felt guilty that he never got to say goodbye to his sweetheart as he was suddenly taken ill and hospitalised. He was then flown back to the UK and was never able to let Joyce know.</p>
      <p>At the time Bill said: "I am delighted to be back in contact with Joyce, so happy. It meant so much to me, as I am a gentleman, and it was a matter of honour, for me to find Joyce and explain why I left Singapore.</p>
      <p>"Please thank all your readers for their interest and offers of help, which I found very touching, they will always, have a warm place in my heart."</p>
      <p>The  Long Lost Family team only intend to reunite couples who are both single and happy to meet as friends – and who knows, the spark might still be there.</p>
      <p>If you, or someone you know wants to reconnect with someone special from the past, call 020 3301 8577 or email longlostloves@walltowall.co.uk</p>
      <p>All applicants must be single and 18 or over. All information shared will be treated confidentially.</p>
