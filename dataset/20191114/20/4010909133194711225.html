      <p>Based on a statement by <a href="https://bgr.com/2019/11/12/gta-6-release-date-will-the-game-be-ready-for-ps5-and-xbox-2-launch/">bgr.com</a>, it seems that a hip hop group called City Morgue recently released an <a href="https://twitter.com/Yan2295/status/1193371626798223361">update on their Instastory</a> claiming that Grand Theft Auto 6 will be released somewhere around Summer of 2020. Furthermore, it seems that the game will most likely be released around the time as Sony’s Playstation 5 or Microsoft’s new Xbox Project Scarlett will be available for consumers to purchase.</p>
      <p>Not only that, but several game developers also mentioned that the upcoming Playstation 5 will come with hardware that could revolutionize console gaming. That being said, do take every bit of information with a grain of salt, as there was no official statement from Rockstar, Microsoft, or Sony in regards to the game or the consoles mentioned.</p>
