      <h1>'Disappointed' - The Chelsea and Arsenal legends' verdicts Aston Villa fans will agree with</h1>
      <h2>The Aston Villa defender was left out of the starting XI by Gareth Southgate</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T20:35:38+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 20:35</time> by <a rel="author">Elliott Jackson, https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/authors/elliott-jackson/</a></address>
      <p>Former Chelsea and Arsenal defenders Ashley Cole and Lee Dixon have both admitted they're "disappointed" not to see <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/tyrone-mings">Tyrone Mings</a> start for England against Montenegro.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa</a> defender impressed for the Three Lions having made his debut against Bulgaria during the last international break.</p>
      <p>However, John Stones was selected to replace Mings after his return to fitness, despite his indifferent form for Manchester City.</p>
      <p>The former Everton defender joined Harry Maguire at the heart of the defence, with Trent Alexander-Arnold and Ben Chilwell at full-back.</p>
      <p>However, having dealt manfully with off-the-pitch racist abuse during the trip to Bulgaria and putting in a strong performance, both Cole and Dixon believe that Mings should've started once again alongside Maguire against Montenegro.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Speaking to ITV before the match, Dixon said: "He (Stones) is a good player, there is no doubt about that but he has lost his way a little bit. Does he seem like the character that can get himself back to how good he was?</p>
      <p>"He plays on confidence and at the minute he's in and out at Man City. I'm disappointed, we've just been talking about Mings not playing again.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"A second game, a run out at Wembley, to build a partnership and just see if whether he going to be the one to step into the gap if there are injuries. I'm a bit disappointed he's not playing tonight."</p>
      <p>Cole, who has 107 caps for England, added: "I think he played with quality, a little bit of arrogance, confidence.</p>
      <p>"I think he fitted right in, he didn't look like a newbie to the international stage.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"We're probably a little bit disappointed he didn't play again today."</p>
