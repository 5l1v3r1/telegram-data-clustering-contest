      <p>A couple in Honolulu took extreme sports to the next level by getting engaged while surfing.</p>
      <p>Chris Garth dropped to one knee on his board to propose to Lauren Oiye in the surf off Queen’s Beach – where the couple first met – in Waikiki, Hawaii.</p>

      <p>According to Hawaii News Now, Garth dropped the ring in the water shortly after – fortunately he had foreseen such a slip and the lost ring was only a stand-in.</p>
      <p>The real ring was safe on the beach, collected once the couple were back on dry land.</p>
