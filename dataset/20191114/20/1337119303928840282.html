      <p>British video game developer Rare, creator of classics like <i>Battletoads</i>, <i>GoldenEye 007</i>, and <i>Banjo-Kazooie</i>,<i> </i>is revealing its next big game, <i>Everwild</i>, at Microsoft’s X019 event today. Rare is only providing a small glimpse at <i>Everwild</i>,<i> </i>but the brief trailer makes it look like it’s going to be some type of action adventure game.</p>
      <p><i>Banjo-Kazooie </i>fans will have been hoping for a sequel, or at least a new <i>Banjo </i>game, but <i>Everwild </i>looks more like <i>Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. </i>The world is full of different species of animals, all with Rare’s classic cartoon-style look and feel. Rare and Microsoft haven’t revealed much more about the game, nor when it will be released.</p>

      <p>“While <i>Everwild</i> is still early in development, we are very excited about the unique potential of the game we are creating,” explains Rare studio head Craig Duncan. “The <i>Everwild</i> team is focused on building an experience that allows for new ways to play in a natural and magical world. <i>Everwild</i> will give you memorable, engaging and meaningful experiences for players everywhere to share. We cannot wait to share more with you in the future.”</p>
      <p>Rare’s previous Xbox One and Windows 10 exclusive, <i>Sea of Thieves</i>,<i> </i><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/13/17003856/sea-of-thieves-game-preview">launched last year</a> and the team will continue to work on it and provide updates. It’s fair to say it wasn’t a smash hit, but it also wasn’t a flop either. <i>Sea of Thieves</i> now has a dedicated community of players, but Rare is clearly keen to try something new with <i>Everwild </i>that’s not necessarily as service-driven as <i>Sea of Thieves</i>.</p>
