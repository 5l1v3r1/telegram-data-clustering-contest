      <p>In the game, you are shrunken to the size of an ant and tasked with surviving a suburban backyard. Players must gather, craft and build bases with everyday objects found within the yard, search for resources and live alongside giant insects – some peaceful, others not so much,</p>
      <p>Expect a combination of environmental and narrative-driven storytelling. It can be played solo or in four-person co-operative multiplayer, where players work together to complete missions or explore the world.</p>
      <p>The game will be released digitally in spring 2020 through Xbox Game Preview, and with Xbox Game Pass, through the Microsoft Store, and on Steam.</p>
