      <h1>Germany makes measles vaccinations compulsory</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T20:26:18+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 20:26</time> by <a rel="author">Danielle Haynes</a></address>
      <p>Nov. 14 (UPI) -- Germany's Parliament on Thursday passed legislation making measles vaccinations mandatory for children.</p>
      <p>Under the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/14/german-parliament-approves-compulsory-measles-vaccinations">new law</a>, expected to go into effect in March, parents face fines of up to $2,700 if they fail to immunize their children. Those without the vaccination may not be allowed to attend school or day care.</p>
      <p>German Health Minister Jens Spahn described the legislation as a "child protection law."</p>
      <p>"My idea of freedom does not stop at my level as an individual," <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/germany-makes-measles-vaccination-compulsory/a-51243094">he said</a>. "Rather, when I sit here in a room like this with 500 or 600 colleagues, in a cinema or on a train, when it comes to community facilities, it is also a question of whether I am unnecessarily putting others at risk. And a measles infection is an unnecessary danger in 2019."</p>
      <p>A global measles outbreak over the past year caused four European countries to lose their <a href="https://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2019/08/29/WHO-Four-European-countries-lose-measles-eliminated-status/8601567054491/?upi_ss=measles">measles-eliminated status</a> -- Albania, Britain Czech Republic and Greece. A country is declared to have eliminated measles when it is absent of continuous transmission of the disease for 12 months.</p>
      <p>The World Health Organization said there must be a 95 percent vaccination rate in order to have herd immunity and prevent an infection outbreak.</p>
