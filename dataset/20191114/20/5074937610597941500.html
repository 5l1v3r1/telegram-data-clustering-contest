      <h1>Tema Traditional Council commends students</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T20:11:39+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 20:11</time> by <a rel="author">Laudia Sawer, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Tema, Nov. 14, GNA - The Tema Traditional Council (TTC) has commended students of the Tema Technical Institute (TTI) and the Tema Manhean Secondary Technical School for projecting the name of industrial city on the international educational platform.</p>
      <p>Tema Manhean Secondary Technical School and Tema Technical Institute emerged third and fourth in the maiden Renewable Energy Challenge for Senior Secondary Schools organised by the Energy Commission in collaboration with the Ghana Education Service.</p>
      <p>Nii Armah Sumponu II, Tema Shipi who received the guests on behalf of the Council made the remarks when the students, accompanied by Mrs Bernice Ofori, Tema Metropolitan Educational Director, Mr Asamoah Duku, Head Teacher of the Tema Technical Institute and Mr Ransford Narteh, Science and Maths Coordinator for the Tema Metropolitan Directorate as well as their teachers and other officials of the GES called on the council.</p>
      <p>While Tema Manhean Secondary Technical used sea water to produce electrical currents through wires to produce light, Tema Technical Institute innovated a footstep power generation system, which work by putting pressure on piezo electric sensors.</p>
      <p>Nii Armarh Sumponu II, Tema Shipi said often times schools such as Manhean Secondary Technical and Tema Technical Institute were perceived to be lower schools academically.</p>
      <p>Nii Sumponu therefore expressed the joy at the achievements of the two schools saying “you have really shown that you are from the industrial and harbour city of Ghana”.</p>
      <p>He expressed the hope that investors and stakeholders would take up the challenge to invest into the various innovations of the students especially that of the use of the sea to produce renewable energy since sea water was in abundance and when well utilised could benefit the communities in the coastal areas.</p>
      <p>The Council presented cheques with undisclosed face value to the schools to support their activities and spur them on to venture into other innovations.</p>
      <p>He commended the Tema Metropolitan Education Directorate and all teachers in the area for their dedication and commitment to provide quality education to the students and advised the students against complacency as that could derail their gains.</p>
      <p>Mrs Ofori, on her part acknowledged the various support the Ghana Education Service received from the TTC over the years saying that had been a backbone of the successes they were chalking.</p>
      <p>She recalled that the Tema Paramount Chief charged them to make the name of Tema great through education and therefore found it appropriate to present the awards to the Council and announce to them that they were working hard to make the challenge a reality.</p>
      <p>Mr Narteh explained that the two schools progressed from the preliminaries, which saw 29 schools competing through to the finals of the challenge where they competed alongside four other schools and emerged third and fourth.</p>
      <p>He gave the assurance that they would put in more efforts to emerge winners in the next challenge.</p>
