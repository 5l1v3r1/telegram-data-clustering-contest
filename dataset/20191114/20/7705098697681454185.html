      <h1>Black Adam is Coming to Theaters in December of 2021</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T20:49:02+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 20:49</time> by <a rel="author">Jake Abbate</a></address>
      <p>Dwayne Johnson has been an action star for years, but he has yet to play a superhero on the big screen. Fortunately, that time is finally upon him. Johnson has just confirmed that his long-gestating <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/black-adam"><b>Black Adam</b></a> film will open on December 22, 2021.</p>
      <p>Johnson revealed the news on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B42odCrFF42/?utm_source=ig_embed">Instagram</a> today with a new poster courtesy of Jim Lee and BossLogic. The actor also shared a lengthy message about what playing Black Adam means to him. You can read what he had to say below.</p>

      <p>Last month, Johnson announced that <b>Black Adam</b> will start shooting in July. Jaume Collet-Serra is directing the movie, but it’s not clear who wrote the most recent draft of the script. Johnson was first cast as Black Adam back in 2014. He was originally going to be the main villain in <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/shazam"><b>Shazam!</b></a> earlier this year before the filmmakers decided to give him his own film.</p>
      <p><b>Black Adam</b> will face some stiff competition when it rolls into theaters. The movie will arrive less than a week after <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/avatar-2"><b>Avatar 2</b></a> opens on December 17. Since James Cameron’s highly anticipated sequel is all but guaranteed to be a huge financial success, it’ll be interesting to see the two films duke it out for the top spot at the box office. Additionally, <b>Black Adam</b> is the third DC film targeting a 2021 release date. It will follow <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/the-batman"><b>The Batman</b></a> and <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/the-suicide-squad"><b>The Suicide Squad</b></a>, which open on June 25 and August 6, respectively.</p>
