        <b>Announced today during X019, Grounded is a survival game from Obsidian Entertainment that shrinks you down to the size of an ant, puts you in a garden, and makes you fight for your tiny life.</b>
      </p>
      <p>You can watch the announcement trailer for Grounded below. It shows off plenty of exciting features, including the shrunk-down player and their equally-miniature friends banding together to fight off some now-giant bugs.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <i>The world is a vast, beautiful, and dangerous place – especially when you have been shrunken to the size of an ant. Explore, build, and survive together in this first person, multiplayer, survival-adventure. Can you thrive alongside the hordes of giant insects, fighting to survive the perils of the backyard?<br/></i>
        <i>Obsidian Entertainment announces Grounded, their new survival game with a small twist. Go big or never go home in Spring 2020. An Xbox Game Preview title built with community feedback and premiering on Xbox Game Pass for console and PC.</i>
      </blockquote>
      <p>In Grounded, you’ll have to do all your typical survival stuff such as establishing a base, collecting resources to craft with, and hunting food, presumably in the form of those pesky aforementioned bugs.</p>
      <p>Grounded will be out on Xbox One and PC in Spring 2020. You can check out <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/grounded">its official Xbox page here</a>.</p>
