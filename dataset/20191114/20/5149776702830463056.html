      <h1>'He is really good with us' - Brennan Johnson positive about life under Sabri Lamouchi</h1>
      <h2>The highly-rated Forest youngster is currently away on international duty with Wales</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T20:24:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 20:24</time> by <a rel="author">Barry Cooper</a></address>
      <p>Brennan Johnson’s arrival on the first team scene at <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Nottingham Forest</a> has happened quicker than even he dreamt it would.</p>
      <p>The teenager made his second Championship appearance coming off the bench in the closing stages of Saturday’s 1-0 win over Derby County at the City Ground, his second league outing of the campaign.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/transfer-news/nottingham-forest-transfer-news-lamouchi-3537390">Head coach Sabri Lamouchi</a> handed him a full debut in the 3-0 win over the Rams in the Carabao Cup earlier this season, and he’s also had a taste of playing at the Emirates in the Reds’ defeat to Arsenal.</p>
      <p>The 18-year-old is <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/forget-messi-ronaldo-brennan-johnson-2740998">the latest academy graduate</a> involved in Lamouchi’s first team squad, joining regulars Joe Worrall, Ryan Yates, Matty Cash and Jordan Smith, and Johnson says the Frenchman is a coach that works well with the youngsters at Forest.</p>

      <p>"He is really good with us - all the young players," Johnson told BBC <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/brennan-johnson-scores-wales-under-3293863">Wales</a>, admitting that his <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/best-chance-nottingham-forest-tipped-3536353">progress</a> had even taken him by surprise.</p>
      <p>"I thought I would be with the Under-23s at the start of the season and hopefully towards the back-end of the season I might be involved with the first team.</p>
      <p>"To be in since the start has been great and I think it's only going to make me a better player.</p>
      <p>"I have just got to keep doing what I am doing in training every day at Forest and hopefully I can get more appearances."</p>
