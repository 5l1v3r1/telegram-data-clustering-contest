      <p>MADISON, Wis. - Wisconsin's unemployment rate is up for a fifth straight month and half a percentage point since a record low in May.</p>
      <p>The state Department of Workforce Development reported Thursday that unemployment in October was 3.3%. That is up from 3.2% the month before and 2.8% in April and May. That tied a record low for the state.</p>
      <p>The October rate is also three-tenths of a point ahead of where it was a year ago. But it remains below the national unemployment rate of 3.6%.</p>
      <p>Wisconsin lost 1,100 private sector jobs between September and October. The state was up 17,200 private sector jobs over the same point last year.</p>
