      <p><b>News</b> by Matt Wales, Reporter Updated on 15 November 2019</p>
      <p>Sea of Thieves will be embarking on a brand-new Tall Tales adventure next Wednesday, 20th November, when The Seabound Soul - as the multiplayer pirate game's latest free update is known - arrives on PC and Xbox One in a GREAT BIG BALL OF FIRE.</p>
      <p>The Seabound Soul looks to be a pretty major offering - an extremely welcome turn given the relative lack of significant additions over the last few months - and will herald Sea of Thieves' first new lore-focussed Tall Tales mission since the story campaign <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-04-10-sea-of-thieves-slick-sizeable-first-story-campaign-is-a-little-bit-indiana-jones-a-little-bit-goonies">was introduced</a> in April's mammoth Anniversary update.</p>
      <p>"Join Captain Pendragon to uncover the mystery of the feared ship, the Ashen Dragon," teases Rare, "and reveal the secrets of a sinister new threat." There's a hint of the adventures to come in the announcement trailer below.</p>

      <p>The other big gameplay addition arriving as part of November's update is fire - a feature we already sort of knew about thanks to a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-08-22-fire-has-been-unofficially-announced-for-sea-of-thieves">spot of accidental indiscretion</a> during a Sea of Thieves developer livestream a few months back.</p>

      <p>Now though, it's all official, and players will soon get their hands on firebombs, a new type of explosive ammo that can either be tossed or loaded into cannons in order to engulf enemy ships - or, indeed, just enemies - in a deadly inferno. Firebombs, notes Rare, will be available to pyromaniacal pirates in both Adventure and the PvP-focussed Arena mode.</p>
      <p>Rounding off Sea of Thieves' November update are the usual array of Commendations and cosmetics, including a new batch of bits and bobs in the Pirate Emporium paid store.</p>
