      <h1>‘Aquaman 2’ Will Bring Back Patrick Wilson’s Ocean Master</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T20:00:34+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 20:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.slashfilm.com/author/chris-evangelista/" target="_blank">Chris Evangelista</a></address>
      <p><b><i>Aquaman</i></b>, the best superhero movie of 2018 (don’t @ me) will have a sequel soon enough, and you can expect to see some familiar faces. In addition to <b>Jason Momoa</b>‘s underwater hero, the sequel will also be bringing back <b>Patrick Wilson</b> as Aquaman’s half-brother/enemy Orm, AKA Ocean Master. <b>James Wan</b> is returning to direct <b><i>Aquaman 2</i></b>, which will begin production next year.</p>
      <p>I loved <i>Aquaman</i> and all of its goofball energy and fantastical world-building, and I can’t wait for the sequel. Info on the follow-up has been relatively low-key, but with production set to ramp up very soon, we’re likely to learn more and more in the upcoming months. Here’s something we do know: Patrick Wilson’s Ocean Master will be back. The first film spared his character’s life, and since Wilson and director James Wan have a long-standing working relationship, it’s only reasonable that the actor would return.</p>
      <p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/midway-star-patrick-wilson-his-aquaman-2-future-1254563">THR</a>, Wilson said, “I’m slightly briefed [on Orm-related matters]. I just throw a little dart here and there. I’ll say, ‘So, what about this?’ and [James Wan will] say, ‘Well, this is what I’m thinking.’ I can tell you that even his concepts for Aquaman 2 are pushing it even further.”  Even further, you say? Further than a title card made up of fish? Further than Amber Heard eating flowers? Further than Nicole Kidman wearing a weird fish-monster suit? I can’t wait!</p>
      <p>I doubt Wan is going to make the same movie all over again, so I wouldn’t be surprised if Wilson’s character doesn’t end up being the lead villain this time out. Yahya Abdul-Mateen II has stated he’ll also be back as Black Manta, so there will be plenty of foes to go around. In addition to the <i>Aquaman </i>sequel there’s also a spin-off movie about the sea monsters known as <i>The Trench</i>.</p>
      <p>Wan is currently working on directing his first horror movie since <i>The Conjuring 2</i>, called Malignant. Production on <i>Aquaman 2</i> will begin in 2020, with a <b>December 16, 2022</b> release date planned.</p>
