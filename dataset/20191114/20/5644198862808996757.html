      <p>WASHINGTON: Walmart Inc reported better-than-expected third quarter U.S. comparable sales on Thursday as people spent more at its stores and website and the retailer picked up market share in food and other groceries.</p>
      <p>The world's largest retailer also raised its annual earnings outlook, sending its shares up over 3 percent in premarket trade.</p>

      <p>Walmart has now posted a 21-quarter, or over five-year, streak of U.S. growth, unmatched by any other retail chain.</p>
      <p>Sales at U.S. stores open at least a year rose 3.2per cent, excluding fuel, in the quarter ended Oct.31. Analysts estimated growth of 2.9per cent, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.</p>
      <p>Adjusted earnings per share increased to US$1.16 per share, beating expectations of US$1.09 per share.</p>
      <p>Online sales rose 41per cent, higher than the previous quarter's increase of 37 pct and greater than the company's expectation of 35per cent.</p>
      <p>Operating income continued to remain under pressure and fell 5.4 percent to US$4.7 billion as a result of ongoing investments in its e-commerce business.</p>
      <p>Walmartâ€™s online expansion has come at a cost to profitability, and losses at the U.S. e-commerce business could rise to about US$1.7 billion this year from US$1.4 billion in 2018, according to estimates from Morgan Stanley.</p>
      <p>Walmart forecast earnings per share, including the impact from its acquisition of Indian e-commerce retailer Flipkart, to increase "slightly" from a year ago.</p>
      <p>Total revenue rose 2.5 percent to US$128 billion.</p>
