      <p>A so-called 'anti-Brexit cat' will be pitted against political party leaders after its owner confirmed the moggie would be standing in the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/general-election">General Election</a> .</p>
      <p>Stan the ginger cat has officially launched his bid to win a seat in Parliament for the constituency of Gilingham and Rainham in Kent.</p>
      <p>The furry hopeful, owned by anti-Brexit campaigner Peter Cook, plans on sticking two paws to the likes of Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees Mogg.</p>
      <p>He also proposes to convert the Medway Tunnel into a giant cat flap and set an army of cats upon the roof of Gillingham train station to remove the pigeons, says Peter.</p>

      <p>Owner Peter says he will represent Stan as his "cat whisperer" as part of the UCAT party.</p>
      <p>Peter told <a href="https://www.kentonline.co.uk/medway/news/cat-announced-as-election-candidate-216508/">Kent Online</a> said: "Our towns deserve better. <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brexit">Brexit</a> will make it more likely that Medway falls into greater levels of deprivation and a sense of hopelessness.”</p>
      <p>“UCAT is an alternative that will negotiate a Brexit deal which is kinder on pets and which sticks two paws up to Johnson and the likes of Jacob Rees-Moggy.</p>

      <p>"The purpose of Stan the cat is to disrupt support for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> and Brexit madness, which is gripping the country in spite of compelling evidence that it will make the residents of Medwaypoorer."</p>
      <p>Peter has been gathering supporters on his <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> page, Cats Against Brexit Mayhem' - which has almost 700 followers.</p>
