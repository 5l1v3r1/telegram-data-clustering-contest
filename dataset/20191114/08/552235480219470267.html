      <p>St Andrew’s Hospice has launched its annual Light Up a Life Christmas initiative ahead of the festive season.</p>
      <p>Light Up a Life is a special opportunity to sponsor a light on the Hospice Christmas tree or on the Christmas tree in your local area, in memory or in honour of a loved one.</p>
      <p>You can have a handwritten, personalised card delivered to you or sent to a friend or relative to let them know they are in your thoughts.</p>
      <p>All donations go to supporting patients and their families across Lanarkshire.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The campaign has once again been generously sponsored by the Mears Group. Barry Duncan, Mears managing director, said: “We are proud to be involved with St Andrew’s Hospice as it plays an important role in caring for the people of Lanarkshire.</p>
      <p>“We are also delighted to continue supporting the Hospice by sponsoring the Light Up a Life campaign again.”</p>
      <p>Lorna McCafferty, fundraising officer at St Andrew’s Hospice, said: “The Mears Group have been sponsoring our Light Up a Life Campaign since 2012.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“Their continued support is greatly appreciated. Mears’ support, coupled with the generosity of the people of Lanarkshire makes a great difference to the lives of our patients and their families throughout the year.”</p>
      <p>You can sponsor a light by visiting www.st-andrews-hospice.com, by completing a form in any St Andrew’s Hospice shop or in the reception of the Hospice in Henderson Street, Airdrie.</p>
      <p>This year, Light Up A Life pin badges are also available for £2. The pins can be purchased in the Hospice, from their online shop or by telephoning Lorna McCafferty on 01236 772087.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>You can sponsor a light up until noon on Christmas Eve.</p>
      <p>Any cards written that day will be posted but you will not receive the card until the Royal Mail resumes deliveries.</p>
      <p>The St Andrew’s Hospice Light Up A Life ceremony will take place in the Hospice grounds on Sunday, December 1 from 7pm.</p>
