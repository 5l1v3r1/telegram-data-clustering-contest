      <h1>Tyson Fury's wife tried to convince him to retire after Deontay Wilder draw</h1>
      <h2>Fury was knocked down twice by Wilder but still did enough to win - but the judges ruled the fight a draw</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T08:51:47+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 08:51</time> by <a rel="author">Martin Domin, https://www.facebook.com/mirrorfighting</a></address>
      <p>Tyson Fury has revealed his wife Paris tried to convince him to quit following his draw with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/deontay-wilder">Deontay Wilder</a> .</p>
      <p>Fury was knocked down twice by the heavyweight world champion last year but still looked to have done enough to win.</p>
      <p>The three ringside judges ruled differently however with the fight scored a controversial draw.</p>
      <p>Fury and his whole team were devastated but it was wife who was most affected.</p>
      <p>"Paris was in a worse state and couldn’t get over what she had witnessed that night," he writes in his autobiography <i>Behind The Mask.</i></p>

      <p><i>"</i> She not only told me to retire but she also didn't feel that she could sit through another fight with me against Wilder.</p>
      <p>"In the immediate aftermath, she felt so ill and when she got back to our hotel room she ripped off her false nails, wiped away her make-up and sat on the bed, crying for three hours.</p>
      <p>"It was horrible to see my wife go through that kind of trauma and I’m sure there are many wives and girlfriends of boxers who can relate to that experience, because they know the fine line between a glorious night in the ring and a tragic one.</p>
      <p>"Through the tears, Paris didn’t hold back: 'I don’t want you fighting again, Tyson. It’s too hard, it’s not worth it!'</p>

      <p>"The emotional roller-coaster that Paris, Hughie and my family went through illustrates how much they care. That’s the depth of love and concern that few others in boxing can really have for a fighter.</p>
      <p>Everyone else is doing a job and if the fighter loses, well, they just move on to the next show. With regard to the management team and the promoters, if I lose it’s a case of, ‘Oh well, bad luck’ but it’s not the end of the world to them.</p>
      <p>"They move on to the next promotion. But my family, they don’t get any money from it so for them it is everything. It means so much – there’s family pride and love on the line every time I step through the ropes and into the ring."</p>
      <p>Fury continued, however, beating first Tom Schwarz and the Otto Wallin this year as he prepares for his rematch with Wilder which is scheduled for February.</p>
