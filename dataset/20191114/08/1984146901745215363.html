      <p>Are you an amateur baker who could rise to the challenge and bring the Great British Bake Off trophy to the North East?</p>
      <p>Great British Bake Off is looking for contestants to take part in the next series, to be filmed and aired in 2020. The North East has been unrepresented in Bake Off since the show launched - almost a decade ago - in 2010.  Bake Off has never had a winner from the region, although the 2019 edition's competitors included a <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/great-british-bake-off-2019-16782772">Durham University student and a man who was born in Newcastle but raised in Scotland</a>.</p>
      <p>So could 2020's tenth series of <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/the-great-british-bake-off">Bake Off </a>finally be the time a baker from the North East wins the show?</p>
      <p>Applications are now open for the 2020 Great British Bake Off, presented by Paul Hollywood, Sandi Toksvig, Prue Leith and Noel Fielding.</p>
      <p>The show's producers say: "Who’s the best baker you know? We’re looking for Britain’s best home bakers to enter the tent.</p>
      <p>"Are you in loaf with baking? The hunt is on to find Britain’s best amateur bread-kneaders, cake-makers and jelly- setters, and it just might be you!</p>
      <p>"If you or someone you know is a smart cookie in the kitchen maybe it’s time to take a whisk and apply!"</p>
      <p>Applicants must be aged 16 or over. Applications close on Sunday January 5, 2020.</p>
      <p>To apply for Great British Bake Off 2020, head to <a href="https://gbbo.take-part.co.uk/">www.applytobakeoff.com</a>, or email applyforbakeoff@loveproductions.co.uk, or call 0207 067 4837 stating your full name, full address (including postcode) and telephone number.</p>
