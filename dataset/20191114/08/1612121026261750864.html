      <p>If there’s one thing <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/346403-google-stadia-barebones-launch/">Google</a> is good at, it’s repeating mistakes. Apparently the Pixel 3 is starting to show some of the same battery issues that plagued the Nexus 6P, which, in <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/340847-if-you-bought-a-nexus-6p-you-might-now-be-eligible-for-up-to-400-back/">case you forgot, is a phone that ended its life as a class action lawsuit</a> because it was pretty broken for tons of users. Not exactly a model citizen in smartphone history.</p>
      <h3>Same old battery problems</h3>
      <p>The issue happens when the <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/346068-google-pixel-no-more-updates/">Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL</a> get below 30% of battery life. Sometimes users have huge drops in battery after that point, while others report a complete shutdown, almost as if the last third of the battery is unusable. This is what happened to cause the Nexus 6P’s early shutdown problems and forced Google to shell out a bunch of cash and replacements for dysfunctional phones.</p>

      <p>These problems started appearing on Google’s <a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/4021352">own support forums back in April</a>, and have only grown since then. Google’s solution for these affected users is to factory reset their device and try to boot into safe mode, except those don’t actually solve any of the problems. Even the RMA replacements that are being sent out exhibit some of the same issues, which means this might be a systemic problem with the Pixel 3’s battery.</p>
      <p>This is going to be especially problematic as Pixel 3 batteries get older. <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/346247-google-limits-the-pixel-4-displays-maximum-brightness-to-save-tiny-battery/">Newer batteries</a> naturally have fewer problems, but as they age these kinds of issues pop up more and more often. So far it doesn’t seem as common as the Nexus 6P’s issues, but this still isn’t very promising.</p>
