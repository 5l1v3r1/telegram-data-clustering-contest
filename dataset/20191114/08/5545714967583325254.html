      <p>It took until November, but 2019 was finally worth showing up for, as NetherRealm Studios has released the gameplay trailer for the fourth DLC character headed to<i> Mortal Kombat 11</i>. Her Royal Highness, The Hostess With The Mostess, The Resurrected Regal, The Harridan of Hairstyles, The Flying Fox, The Supreme Siren, and The Ultimate Scream Queen...<br/><br/>...It's Sindel. Of course.</p>
      <p>Sindel made her series debut way back in 1995's <i>Mortal Kombat 3.</i> Taking inspiration for her design from both 1935's <i>The Bride of Frankenstein</i> and 1993 fantasy movie<i> The Bride with White Hair,</i> Sindel was the "bride" (see "prisoner") of Shao Kahn, and her young death and resurrection on Earthrealm was essentially the key to facilitating the Outworld invasion.</p>

      <p>Originally a benevolent queen of Edenia, Sindel - once resurrected - was enchanted by evil, <a href="https://youtu.be/3z_pJr3CERw?t=158">performing an infamous massacre in <i>MK 9</i></a> which cost many characters their lives. Sindel later appeared as an NPC in <i>Mortal Kombat X</i>, but will make her playable return here in <i>MK 11</i>. Controversially, her backstory and personality appear to have been retconned, making her a willing villain, rather than a brainwashed pawn in Shao Kahn's master plan.<br/><br/>As you may or may not know, Sindel is my favourite <i>MK</i> kharacter of all time. Having played her since 1995, she's legitimately my longest-running fighting game "main". I'm very excited to see how she handles in <i>MK 11</i>. One of her variations appears to include her spirited Naginata, a weapon she wielded back in <i>Mortal Kombat: Deception</i>. As is the character's trademark, Sindel's hair, flight abilities, and powerful scream can also be used to fell her foolish foes.<br/><br/>I'm<i> ecstatic</i> to see you again, your highness. Let's go collect some skulls...<br/><br/>Sindel will be made available for Kombat Pass owners on November 26, before launching officially on December 3.<i> Mortal Kombat 11</i> is available now on PS4, PC, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch.</p>
