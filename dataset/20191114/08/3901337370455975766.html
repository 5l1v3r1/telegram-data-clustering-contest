      <p>Orlando Pirates goalkeeper, Wayne Sandilands admits that the league title may not be their number one focus right now, but the Bucs still need to keep up the chase.</p>
      <p>While Pirates are hungry for trophies after going five years without any silverware, the Absa Premiership title could also be out of their reach at this moment, as they find themselves ninth on the log, with 13 points.</p>
      <p>Kaizer Chiefs are currently leading the log with a 10-point gap over Mamelodi Sundowns at second place, with the Brazilians still having a game in hand.</p>

      <p>Speaking in an exclusive interview with Soccer Laduma, Pirates’ shot-stopper, Sandilands revealed that the Bucs are currently focused on building their momentum (after a disappointing run in the league so far) but while doing so, want to try and narrow the gap a bit between them and the likes of Chiefs and Sundowns.</p>
      <p>“Look, we are under no illusions that we need to turn this around and turn it around really quickly. You can’t give teams like (Mamelodi) Sundowns and (Kaizer) Chiefs too much of a gap,” Sandilands told Soccer Laduma.</p>
      <p>“You can’t afford to do that. We know that we need to turn it around and we don’t want to give those teams a big lead. I wouldn’t say we are counting ourselves out; we’re definitely not doing that. But, again, I think right now that’s not our focus. Our focus is the building blocks, building one block at a time, which means one game at a time. But we know that we have to pick up points,” he added.</p>
