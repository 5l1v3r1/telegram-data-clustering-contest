      <h1>Is vaping really healthier than smoking cigarettes? Experts have their say</h1>
      <h2>North East health officials attend 'E-cigarette' summit in London to discuss the issue</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T08:00:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 08:00</time> by <a rel="author">Mike Kelly</a></address>
      <p>Thousands of early deaths and cases of disease could be prevented over time if every smoker stopped smoking tobacco completely and switched to vaping.</p>
      <p>That is the claim from North East tobacco control programme Fresh and a senior cancer doctor from this region, as experts from around the world attend the seventh annual UK E-Cigarette Summit in London today.</p>
      <p>The Royal College of Physicians has previously stated that while vaping may not be completely “safe”, the hazard to health arising from long-term use of e-cigarettes in the UK is unlikely to exceed 5% of the harm from smoking tobacco.</p>
      <p>In contrast to vaping, 50% of long-term smokers die early from a smoking-related illness.</p>
      <p>Dr Tony Branson, consultant oncologist and clinical lead for the Northern Cancer Alliance, said: “Not all the publicity recently about vaping has been positive but people who are vaping to quit smoking need the right information to make an informed choice, and it is vital that they are not scared back into the more harmful option of tobacco smoking.</p>
      <p>“If you’re not a smoker, the advice is don’t vape. But if you are, it is much better to vape instead. Over 350,000 people in the North East smoke and if every one of those switched to vaping completely, it’s likely we would see a big benefit to the health of people in the North East.”</p>
      <p>Tobacco contains thousands of harmful chemicals and causes 16 cancers, with around 5,500 people in the North East dying from smoking a year and as many as 36,000 hospital admissions a year from smoking tobacco.</p>
      <p>Ailsa Rutter OBE, director of Fresh, said: “To date all the evidence strongly suggests that e-cigarettes are not only helping people to stop smoking completely, but they contain significantly fewer harmful chemicals than tobacco.”</p>

      <p>Prof Eugene Milne, director of public health for <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-city-council">Newcastle City Council</a> and lead tobacco director of public health in the North East, said people often think the problem with cigarettes is nicotine.</p>
      <p>In fact it’s the many other chemicals which cause most of the health problems such as cancer.</p>
      <p>“Vaping is less harmful than smoking because you’re not setting fire to and breathing in all the cancer causing chemicals,” he said.</p>
      <p>Since mid-September there have been reports of an outbreak of serious lung disease across the US said to be associated with vaping. However, the main chemicals under suspicion in the US such as THC oil and Vitamin E acetate are not permitted in e-cigarettes in this country.</p>
      <p>Reacting to coverage about e-cigarettes in Nottingham reported in the media this week in relation to a teenage boy having a negative reaction to vaping in his lungs, Prof John Britton, director of the UK Centre for Tobacco &amp; Alcohol Studies and Consultant in Respiratory Medicine, said: “It’s not absolutely clear what has happened here, but it looks like an allergy to an inhaled substance.</p>
      <p>“There have been a very small number of cases of this condition reported in vapers worldwide, so I think we can conclude that it happens but is thankfully very rare.</p>
      <p>“This is worrying, and the risk needs to be acknowledged, but in absolute terms it is extremely small - and, crucially, far smaller than that of smoking.”</p>
