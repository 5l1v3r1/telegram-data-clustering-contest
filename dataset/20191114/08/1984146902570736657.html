      <h1>Acclaimed film maker Ken Loach to take part in Newcastle Lit &amp; Phil event</h1>
      <h2>He'll be appearing with long time collaborator Paul Laverty with whom he made I, Daniel Blake and Sorry We Missed You</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T08:00:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 08:00</time> by <a rel="author">Mike Kelly</a></address>
      <p>Film maker Ken Loach and his long time screen writing collaborator Paul Laverty are to discuss their latest movie, ‘Sorry We Missed You’, at a special event in the North East next month.</p>
      <p>The acclaimed duo will be appearing in conversation at <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-upon-tyne">Newcastle’s Lit &amp; Phil</a> on December 4.</p>
      <p>‘Sorry We Missed You’, like their previous movie, the Palme d’Or and BAFTA award-winning ‘I, Daniel Blake’, is set in the North East and features a cast of largely local and little-known actors.</p>
      <p>Telling the heart-breaking story of delivery driver and family man Ricky Turner, whose circumstances are pushed to breaking point by his unrelenting employment contract, the thought-provoking film opened in cinemas recently and is already garnering critical acclaim with further awards glory for the pair predicted.</p>
      <p>The internationally-renowned Loach is known for his inimitable directing style which confronts major social issues and probes the mechanisms and contradictions within our society.</p>
      <p>Screenwriter Laverty has worked alongside the directing legend on many films including Carla’s Song, The Wind that Shakes the Barley and Looking for Eric.</p>

      <p>In a North East first the two industry heavyweights will host an intimate conversational-style lunchtime event for a small ticketed audience in the historic setting of the Lit &amp; Phil.</p>
      <p>It houses over 160,000 books, with several hundred volumes on the North East dating back to the 18th century and an extensive historic and contemporary map collection.</p>
      <p>Long-time friends of the Lit &amp; Phil, Loach and Laverty will discuss their current and past projects, and their ardour for the North East and its people. They will also open up the floor allowing the audience of 90 to ask questions.</p>
      <p>Lit &amp; Phil librarian and event organiser Kay Easson said: “We are honoured that Ken and Paul have chosen the Lit &amp; Phil as the setting for this historic and intimate event.</p>
      <p>“Throughout its near 200-year history our library has provided the stage for many historic and ground-breaking cultural debates and scientific discoveries, and it’s wonderful to be able to continue this tradition.</p>
      <p>“We know this event will be warmly received by our members and more widely by the people of the region. We expect tickets to sell out quickly so would urge those interested not to delay.”</p>
      <p>* In Conversation with Ken Loach and Paul Laverty will take place at Newcastle’s Lit &amp; Phil on December 4 at 12.30pm.</p>
