        <b>LONDON, United Kingdom, Nov 14 – Jurgen Klopp has warned his Liverpool players that they will be straight back to work when they return from international duty.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Both Mohamed Salah and Andy Robertson withdrew from their respective matches with Egypt and Scotland due to ankle injuries, and Klopp is hoping the rest of his squad return healthy.</p>
      <p>Salah has reportedly aggravated a problem he initially sustained against Leicester last month he could be a doubt for the trip to Crystal Palace when the Premier League resumes.</p>
      <p>Robertson revealed he has not trained properly for a fortnight but is hopeful a two-week break will allow him some much-needed recovery time.</p>
      <p>“Now the boys go for the last international break of the year. They have to come back healthy. You saw it how intense it was [against City],” Klopp said.</p>
      <p>“Hopefully they all come back healthy and then we go to Crystal Palace.</p>
      <p>“I think the last games are somewhere on the planet on Tuesday in the week that we play on Saturday against Crystal Palace.</p>
      <p>“So they will fly back on the Wednesday, Thursday have a recovery session and Friday, Saturday ‘Hello, Crystal Palace’.</p>
      <p>“That’s the situation so nothing happens so far but it’s still the best situation we could have asked for so let’s hope we can carry on.”</p>
