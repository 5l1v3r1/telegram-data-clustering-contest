      <h1>EU Must Coordinate Crypto Regulation to Become Global Leader: AFME</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T08:52:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 08:52</time> by <a rel="author">Marie Huillet</a></address>
      <p>Europe has the potential to become a global leader in <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/cryptocurrencies">crypto</a>-assets if it succeeds to create a common approach to regulating the sector. </p>
      <p>So goes the argument in a new report from financial markets advocacy group, The Association for Financial Markets in Europe (AFME), in a new report <a href="https://www.fintechfutures.com/2019/11/afme-calls-for-supervisory-convergence-on-the-regulation-of-crypto-assets/">published</a> on Nov. 14.</p>
      <h3>Coordination remains the top priority</h3>
      <p>AFME’s new report sets out five recommendations for achieving supervisory convergence in regulating crypto assets across the bloc.</p>
      <p>Chief among these is to establish a pan-European crypto-asset classification scheme, which can foster a common understanding of various terms and activities relating to crypto-assets in financial services.</p>
      <p>On this point, AFME echoes the recent argument made by <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/association-of-prive-german-banks-argues-for-digital-euro">German banking association Bankenverband</a>, which likewise <a href="https://bankenverband.de/fachthemen/digital-banking/programmierbarer-digitaler-euro/">stressed</a> that a lack of clarity regarding crypto’s status as currency or asset is contributing to confusion over taxation and other regulatory matters. </p>
      <p>AFME’s managing director and head of technology, James Kemp, has underscored that:</p>
      <blockquote>“There has been a rapid rise in the development of crypto-assets […] however, to realise those benefits, it is increasingly important that crypto-asset regulation is coordinated at the regional and global level to foster innovation, while promoting financial stability and ensuring a level playing field.” </blockquote>
      <p>Further key recommendations include defining “clear expectations” on crypto-asset issuance, implementing “activities-based and technology agnostic regulation” and using amended, existing regulation for the sector. </p>
      <p>Above all, achieving the convergence of regulatory frameworks with global and regional initiatives should remain a top priority, according to AFME.</p>
      <h3>Combating regulatory arbitrage</h3>
      <p>Earlier this fall, Brussels-based think tank Bruegel <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/report-belgian-think-tank-calls-for-ministers-to-coordinate-eu-wide-crypto-regulation">called</a> on EU finance ministers to enforce clear and uniform guidelines for <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/cryptocurrencies">crypto</a> across European Union (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/eu">EU</a>) member states.</p>
      <p>The think tank has argued that while new <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/new-eu-directive-sets-stricter-transparency-rules-for-digital-currencies">EU rules on money laundering</a> will eventually tighten checks on market participants such as crypto exchanges by 2020, regulatory oversight is in practical terms largely left to national authorities.</p>
      <p>This fact “might suggest that there is scope for regulatory arbitrage,” the think tank cautioned.</p>
