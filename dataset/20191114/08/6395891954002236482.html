      <p><b>MOSCOWÂ (AP)</b> - A student killed a fellow student and wounded three more in a shooting Thursday at a college in Russia before taking his own life, police said.</p>
      <p>Russia's state Investigative Committee said the 19-year-old shooter brought a hunting rifle to class in Blagoveshchensk near the border with China and opened fire on students, killing one and severely injuring three more.</p>
      <p>It wasn't immediately clear what prompted the attack. The attacker shot himself soon after the police arrived.</p>
      <p>While school shootings are relatively rare in Russia, there have been several violent attacks by students in recent years.</p>
      <p>The college was evacuated and classes suspended. Two injured students underwent surgery in a local hospital, and one of them remained in critical condition.</p>
      <p>Police are investigating the attack.</p>
