      <h1>Swiss Regulator FINMA Adds HandelFX to Warning List</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T08:38:01+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 08:38</time> by <a rel="author">Celeste Skinner</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.financemagnates.com/tag/finma/">Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority</a> (FINMA) has updated its warning list this week to include an entity operating within the foreign exchange (forex) space – HandelFX Ltd.</p>
      <p>In the warning, the Swiss regulator provides the company’s name, website address and states that the entity is “Not entered in commercial register”. FINMA has not provided any further details regarding the warning.</p>
      <p>However, when you look at the front page of the warning page, the watchdog explains what type of entities might appear on the list. Namely, firms that end up on the list are entities that the regulator believes may be providing unauthorised services.</p>
      <p>Any entity on the list has been investigated or is being investigated, by the Swiss authority. When investigations by FINMA reveal an imminent or considerable threat to investors, the providers involved are also entered in the list.</p>

      <p>“The fact that a company is on FINMA’s warning list does not automatically mean that its activities are unlawful. Their entry in the list does, however, highlight the lack of authorisation. The companies and individuals in question will be removed from the list once FINMA has completed its investigations and taken any appropriate measures,” the regulator clarifies.</p>
