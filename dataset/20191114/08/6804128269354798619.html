      <h1>Eden Hazard’s slow start, David Luiz’s struggles: how players sold by Chelsea are performing</h1>
      <h2>The Real Madrid attacker is beginning to show flashes after tricky beginning at the Bernabeu</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T08:00:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 08:00</time> by <a rel="author">Alan Smith</a></address>
      <h3>Eden Hazard - Real Madrid</h3>
      <p>The Belgian made a slow start for Zinedine Zidane's side and was criticised for some of his early performances - not least Real's horrible outing away to Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League.</p>
      <p>Although he has only scored one goal and provided one assist, things are beginning to look up following a couple of much-improved all round displays for the Belgian, including in last weekend's 4-0 win away to Eibar.</p>
      <p>He is expected to continue that momentum after the international break with Real, unsurprisingly, locked in what should be a down-to-the-wire title run with Barcelona. Twelve games in they are tied on 25 points with the Catalan side ahead on goal difference.</p>
      <h3>David Luiz - Arsenal</h3>
      <p>How vindicated has Frank Lampard been for his surprise decision to send the erratic Brazilian defender to Arsenal before the transfer window shut?</p>
      <p>Thanks to Fikayo Tomori's rise in particular it looks like a shrewd piece of business, all the more as Luiz has struggled for an Arsenal team in disarray.</p>
      <p>Unai Emery’s side have kept just two clean sheets - and Luiz was involved in only one of them, the 1-0 win over Bournemouth in which he scored early on.</p>
      <p>That game aside things have not gone well and there was even a discussion on Five Live midway through the North London Derby about whether he could go down as Arsenal's worst ever signing.</p>

      <h3>Ola Aina - Torino</h3>
      <p>The wing back, who joined Chelsea as an under-11, has been doing solidly in Serie A since joining Torino on a permanent deal for about £9million.</p>
      <p>Now 23, it was time for the Londoner to become a regular first-team player but his pathway to minutes at Stamford Bridge was always blocked by others.</p>
      <p>Having impressed on loan at Torino last season, they decided to bring Aina in permanently and he has made ten league appearances, playing predominantly on the left but on a couple of occasions as the right wing back for a side currently in 12th position. Last time out they ended a six-game winless run by winning 4-0 away to Brescia.</p>
      <h3>Tomas Kalas - Bristol City</h3>
      <p>Another who made a loan move permanent, the centre back became Bristol City’s club-record signing following an impressive spell on loan. The campaign had started well but he tore his hamstring against Hull City in late August and has only returned in the past fortnight.</p>
      <p>Lee Johnson’s team are in the final play-off position but the table is congested and the Czech Republic defender will be key if they are remain in the top six.</p>
      <h3>Michael Hector - Fulham</h3>
      <p>Still technically a Chelsea player until the January transfer window opens, the centre back has been training with Fulham since agreeing an £8million deal to move to Craven Cottage in early September. Excelled on loan at Sheffield Wednesday last season but departs Stamford Bridge after four years and zero appearances.</p>
      <h3>Kenneth Omeruo - Leganes</h3>
      <p>Similar to Aina and Kalas, the 25-year-old Nigeria international made his move to Leganes permanent following a spell on loan in Spain last season. Did not play a single game for Chelsea’s first-team, had six loan spells and is now playing regularly for the team bottom of La Liga.</p>
