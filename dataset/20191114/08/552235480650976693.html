      <h1>Methadone Mick turns up to show support at Motherwell suicide prevention football tournament</h1>
      <h2>Actor Scott Reid joined more than 300 players at the event</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T08:00:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 08:00</time> by <a rel="author">Ross Thomson</a></address>
      <p>Still Game star Scott Reid joined over 300 players from across Lanarkshire to help raise awareness about suicide prevention at a high-profile football tournament in Motherwell.</p>
      <p>The 7-a-side competition was keenly contested by teams from a host of local businesses, voluntary organisations, charities and groups of friends who have backed to North and South Lanarkshire councils’ efforts to prevent suicides.</p>
      <p>Scott, who played Methadone Mick in the sit-com was joined by Airdrieonians FC manager Ian Murray and Rangers FC starlets Matthew Shiels and Kieran McKechnie.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Senior officers from Police Scotland, NHS Lanarkshire and North Lanarkshire Council depute leader Paul Kelly and South Lanarkshire leader John Ross were also at the event.</p>
      <p>Suicide was the cause of 784 deaths last year alone across Scotland, and in particular, affects young men in the 30-54 year-old age group.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Speaking on behalf of Suicide Prevention NL, Councillor Paul Kelly said: “Suicide devastates communities and lives across the country every day of every week. It is vital that if people are feeling suicidal or down that they know help is available.</p>

      <p>“Raising awareness and starting the conversation with those worried, concerned or contemplating suicide is key to preventing these tragedies before family and loved ones are left heartbroken at the loss of someone they care about.</p>
      <p>“Sport and particularly football provides a platform to reach out to people to reduce suicide and by working together we can have a greater impact in preventing suicide.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“Every life matters and hopefully all the players and participants who took part in this 7s tournament will help share the message about suicide prevention and awareness amongst their families, colleagues and friends.”</p>
