      <h1>UK weather: Snow, rain and ice warnings with flood-hit communities braced for deluge</h1>
      <h2>The Met Office has issued four weather warnings for today, with snow possible in England, Wales and Scotland this morning. The first flurries fell in south Wales and south-west England yesterday</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T08:26:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 08:26</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Kitching, Matthew Dresch, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/chris-kitching/, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matthew-dresch/</a></address>
      <p>Swathes of the UK are under snow, rain and ice warnings <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/uk-weather-live-snow-closes-20878388">as extreme weather closes schools,</a> causes travel chaos and threatens to bring further misery to towns ravaged by flooding.</p>
      <p>Motorists became stranded and there were a number of crashes as snow, sleet and rain led to hazardous driving conditions across England and Wales during Thursday morning's commute.</p>
      <p>In Wales, police closed roads that became "impassable" because they were buried under so much snow in places that looked like a winter wonderland after temperatures plunged overnight.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/met-office">Met Office</a> has issued snow warnings for South Wales, parts of southern England and the West Midlands, as half a month's worth of rain in a single day threatens to flood more homes and cut off communities.</p>

      <p>Rain warnings are in place for Yorkshire, the East Midlands, much of southern England and across South Wales.</p>
      <p>The Environment Agency (EA) warned that Britain's flooding was far from over and told residents of flood-hit areas in South Yorkshire and Lincolnshire to remain vigilant.</p>
      <p>Up to 45mm (1.7 inches) of rain could fall in those areas, while up to 60mm (2.4 inches) - almost half a month's worth - is possible in southern England and South Wales.</p>
      <p>The EA had issued 30 flood warnings (meaning "immediate action required) - many of them in Yorkshire and the Midlands - as of Thursday morning, in addition to 125 alerts (meaning "be prepared) scattered across England.</p>

      <p>Some places saw their first flurries of the season on Wednesday night and Thursday morning as snow hit South Wales and South West England.</p>
      <p>In Wales, cars got stuck in snow on the A482 at Lampeter and at least two roads - the A4109 at Seven Sisters and the A4221 between Abercrave and Coelbren in Powys - were shut because they were "impassable", <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/snow-wales-weather-warning-schools-17253606">WalesOnline</a> reports.</p>
      <p>Drivers faced hazardous driving conditions on routes on high ground in Wales, where there were also eight flood alerts.</p>

      <p>Tricky driving conditions were also posing problems for commuters in South West England, including Gloucestershire.</p>
      <p>A number of schools were closed or forced to open late due to inclement weather.</p>
      <p>St. Andrews Church of England Primary School in Wotton-under-Edge, Gloucestershire, said it would open late "to allow the roads to settle" after overnight snowfall.</p>

      <p>In Herefordshire, Peterchurch Primary School said it was closed due to flooding, and Stoke Prior Primary School, on the outskirts of Leominster, said it was shut because “many of our staff are unable to make it through flooded roads”.</p>
      <p>Temperatures plummeted to -4C in parts of Scotland overnight, when an ice <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/weather">weather</a> warning was in force across the country.</p>
      <p>Met Office meteorologist Luke Miall said "the worst of the winter weather has now moved through" the South West, but "it's the same one that's going to push its way north and will affect the flooded areas from last week".</p>

      <p>Swollen rivers are at risk of rising again, putting more homes and businesses in danger of being swamped by floodwater.</p>
      <p>Kate Marks, the Environment Agency's flood duty manager, said: "Heavy rain is expected on Thursday, Friday and over the weekend which could lead to further flooding for communities in South Yorkshire around the Lower River Don.</p>
      <p>"Parts of Lincolnshire and the Midlands could also be affected by rain falling on already saturated ground over Thursday and Friday, as well as other parts of England as rain crosses the country from west to east.</p>

      <p>"It's really important that impacted communities remain vigilant and take steps to prepare for flooding by checking their flood risk regularly and making plans to stay safe."</p>
      <p>The EA said 300 staff were working around the clock in various parts of the country, deploying pumps to disperse water through five of the worst-hit locations.</p>
      <p>Since flooding began on November 7, around 14,400 properties had been protected by flood defences, including 5,000 in South Yorkshire, the EA said.</p>

      <p>The Government's response to the flooding has spilled over into an election issue, with Prime Minister <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> facing heavy criticism during a visit to affected areas in South Yorkshire on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The PM later paid a visit to the badly-hit village of Fishlake, where he told reporters: "We will get people back on their feet."</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, Mr Johnson announced that relief funding would be made available for those affected by the floods and said funding for local councils to help affected households would be made available to the tune of £500 per eligible household.</p>

      <p>Snow and ice warnings are due to end at 10am.</p>
      <p>The heaviest snow was falling over the highest routes and there was a mix of rain and sleet at lower levels.</p>
      <p>The rain warning for Yorkshire and the East Midlands will expire at 3am on Friday, while the warning for southern England and Wales will end at 11.45pm.</p>
      <p>In its warning for Yorkshire and the East Midlands, the Met Office said: "A period of heavy and persistent rain is likely on Thursday, 10-20mm is likely fairly widely within the warning area and a few places may receive 35-45mm which may lead to further flooding and disruption.</p>
      <p>"The rain is expected to ease and clear to the north later on Thursday night."</p>
      <p>The warning for southern England and Wales stated: "Periods of rain are expected to become widespread, persistent and locally heavy across parts of England and Wales through Thursday.</p>
      <p>"Rainfall totals of 15-25mm are likely widely with the potential for some spots to see 40-60mm.</p>
      <p>Rain will ease from the west during Thursday afternoon and evening.</p>

      <p>Over western areas, some hill snow is possible, especially parts of south Wales, leading to local accumulations of a few cm, now covered by a separate warning."</p>
      <p>Both warn that fast flowing or deep floodwater will pose a 'danger to life', with homes, businesses and roads at risk of being swamped by swollen streams.</p>
      <p>There is a chance that some communities become cut off by flooded roads, the Met Office said.</p>
      <p>Another Met Office alert has been issued for parts of the Midlands and north-east England tomorrow, warning of 'danger to life' flooding.</p>
