      <h1>Swiss Stock Exchange SIX Lists Tezos-Based ETP With ‘Baking’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T08:02:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 08:02</time> by <a rel="author">Marie Huillet</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/switzerland">Switzerland’s</a> main stock exchange SIX has listed a Tezos-based exchange-traded product (ETP) that enables investors to generate passive income.</p>
      <p>Traded under the symbol <a href="https://www.six-group.com/exchanges/exchange_traded_products/trading/newlistings/2019/details_en.html?id=CH0491507486USD4">AXTZ</a>, the product is issued by fintech Amun AG in partnership with the Tezos Foundation. It went live for trading on Nov. 5.</p>
      <h3>Passive yield</h3>
      <p>According to an <a href="https://www.amun.com/en/products/axtz/">overview</a> of the instrument, the ETP’s investment objective is both to provide exposure to the performance of Tezos while generating additional yield for investors through so-called “baking rewards.”</p>
      <p>Similarly to other proof-of-stake (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/pos">PoS</a>)-based blockchains, Tezos investors are able to passively earn a form of “interest” by staking — depositing — their tokens to both maintain the network and earn rewards. </p>
      <p>“Baking” — a term specific to Tezos — enables stakeholders to participate in the staking and governance process by delegating their coins to a delegation service of their choice. </p>
      <p>Once delegated, these holdings are set in correlation with the total staking balance of the service, with rewards paid out accordingly once they have been released by the network.</p>
      <p>According to Amun, the firm will charge a 2.5% fee on proceeds from the Amun Tezos ETP.</p>
      <p>Underlying assets are reportedly secured and managed using Coinbase’s institution-grade Custody Platform and Amun says it holds 100% of the value of these assets in cold storage.</p>
      <h3>Reshaping the blockchain sector</h3>
      <p>This October, crypto broker Bitcoin Suisse <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/swiss-exchange-six-lists-joint-bitcoin-and-ether-exchange-traded-product">partnered</a> with Amun to launch a new Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price-index">BTC</a>) and Ether (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price-index">ETH</a>)-based ETP on the SIX exchange.</p>
      <p>Amun AG now has a total of nine cryptocurrency ETP products <a href="https://www.six-group.com/exchanges/exchange_traded_products/trading/newlistings/">listed</a> on SIX, including an <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/xrp-price-index">XRP</a>-based ETP, among others. </p>
      <p>A recent research <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-research-ethereums-switch-to-staking-will-transform-industry">report</a> from crypto exchange <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/binance">Binance</a>  argued that with Ethereum’s expected switch to PoS, staking is poised to have a transformative impact on the crypto industry. </p>
      <p>The largest 10 crypto assets currently supporting — or due to support —  staking cumulatively represent a market capitalization of $25.8 billion, meaning that prospective staking dominance stands at roughly 10% of the total industry market capitalization.</p>
