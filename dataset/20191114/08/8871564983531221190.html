      <p>There’s a new social club and kitchen in Ubud, and their grand opening party is this Friday. Their menu begins with breakfast and takes you well into the night with their high voltage cocktail list, and, apparently keeping in line with the healthy trend, they use local and organic ingredients for Western and Asian classic dishes. </p>
      <p>For the grand opening party, Current plans on bringing out free snacks and share plates for the guests, with performances from a DJ and a treat from their build-your-own gin &amp; tonic bar. Might be a great way to kick off your weekend. </p>
      <p>
        <i>Friday, Nov 15 at Current – Social Club &amp; Kitchen, from 5pm ‘til late. Check out their Facebook event page </i>

      <p>It’s the sixth edition of Komponis Kini 2019, a series of music programs featuring the traditional gamelan instrument that has been focused as a tribute to Wayan Beratha, one of Bali’s most celebrated artists who passed away in 2014. This Saturday, five composers will present their new work, titled “Aural Indepence,” which will be performed by Gamelan Yuganada art performance group. </p>

      <p>The organizers have tagged this as a “Bring Home a Piece of Bali With You,” and while it’s probably safe to assume that they are specifically targeting tourists, we think there’s a good chance that the mix of painting and wine could be a wonderful way to spend your Sunday. Join the gang at Kinship Studio and Studio San Junipero (wait, isn’t that an episode in Black Mirror?) for a three-hours guided acrylic painting, which you can enjoy while also sipping wine. </p>
      <p>
        <i>Sunday, Nov 17 at Kinship Studio, from 1pm to 4pm. IDR350k for the painting workshop, and an additional IDR50k for free flow wine. Limited spots, register </i>
