      <h1>German growth rises 0.1%, skirting recession</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T08:03:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 08:03</time> by <a rel="author">Maria Martinez</a></address>
      <p>Germany’s economy grew in the third quarter, avoiding a recession, according to a first estimate published Thursday by the Federal Statistical Office, Destatis.</p>
      <p>Germany’s gross domestic product increased by an adjusted 0.1% from the previous quarter, according to Destatis. This is better than economists’ expectations of a 0.1% contraction in The Wall Street Journal’s survey.</p>
      <p>The agency, however, also revised the second-quarter data. Following the revision, Germany’s GDP decreased 0.2% in the second quarter of 2019, compared with a first estimate of a 0.1% decline.</p>
      <p>GDP grew 0.5% on year in the third quarter on a calendar and price-adjusted basis, Destatis said, in line with a Wall Street Journal poll of economists.</p>
      <p>Recent indicators have sent mixed signals on the German economy, with improvements in manufacturing orders but weak data on industrial production, which had its fifth consecutive quarterly contraction.</p>
