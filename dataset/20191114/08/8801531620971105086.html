      <p>City Civil Court Bengaluru has issued a circular asking employees to follow a decent dress code, while on duty. It is suggested that male officers and employees wear clothing like payjama/kurta or shirt/trousers.</p>
      <p>While women employees should wear decent clothing such as 'saris' or 'chudidar'.</p>
      <p>The circular issued on November 11, reminded the employees about such orders earlier and directed them to strictly adhere to it.
