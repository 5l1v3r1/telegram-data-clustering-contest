      <p><b>New Delhi: </b>India on Thursday said it had conveyed its “expectation” to the new Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa that Colombo would take forward the policy of national reconciliation to meet the aspirations of Sri Lankan Tamils for “equality, justice, peace and dignity”. India's hope was conveyed when External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar met the new Sri Lankan President in Colombo on Tuesday. President Rajapaksa will be visiting India on November 29 and 30.</p>
      <p>The new Sri Lankan President has said he is committed to the development of his country’s northern and eastern provinces (with a large Tamil population) and considers India a “valued partner” in this, the MEA pointed out.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>New Delhi also said it would work “very closely” with the new Government in Sri Lanka. It also said bilateral ties should not be seen through the prism of any third country.</p>
      <p>MEA Spokesperson Raveesh Kumar said, “Our relations with Sri Lanka, or for that matter with any neighbouring country, are independent of our relations with third countries. Our multifaceted relationship with Sri Lanka stands on its own footing and is rooted in our geographical proximity and historical connections. As Prime Minister himself has noted in his congratulatory tweet to incoming Sri Lankan President, we look forward to working closely with the Sri Lankan Government for deepening our relations and for the peace, prosperity and security of the region.  EAM met the Sri Lankan President and conveyed PM's message of friendship.  President Gotabaya has accepted PM's invitation to visit India on 29th November.”</p>
      <p>The MEA added, “During his meeting with President Rajapaksa, EAM (Jaishankar) discussed our close and bilateral relations with Sri Lanka, including ways to further strengthen this in coming years.  EAM conveyed to President Rajapaksa India’s expectation that the Sri Lankan government will take forward the process of national reconciliation to arrive at a solution that meets the aspirations of the Tamil community for equality, justice, peace and dignity.  </p>
      <p>You must have seen President Rajapaksa's statement where he affirmed that he will be the President of all Sri Lankans irrespective of their racial or religious identity and without creating a distinction on whether they voted for him or not.   </p>
      <p>The President also stated that he is committed to ensuring the development of the Northern and Eastern provinces and considers India a valued partner towards this endeavour.”</p>
