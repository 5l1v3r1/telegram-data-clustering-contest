        <b>Indian actress Freida Pinto is engaged to her photographer boyfriend Cory Tran after two years of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/dating/">dating</a>.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The photogenic couple shared the news on Instagram with professional shots of the two, with Freida showing off the luxurious ring (we are not jealous at all).</p>
      <p>Posting a carousel of snaps announcing their engagement, the 35-year-old star wrote: ‘It all makes sense now. Life makes sense, the world makes sense, the past tears and trials make sense, what wise old lovers said about love makes sense, where I am makes sense and where I want to go completely makes sense.</p>
      <p>‘You my love are just the most beautiful creation to have ever walked into my life. And you are here to stay. Well, I am making you stay. Ha!</p>
      <p>‘All my love with all my heart. Oh and Happiest Birthday sweet Fiancé!’</p>
      <p>What a way to announce your engagement.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Cory kept his post short and sweet, writing: ‘The best birthday present I could’ve asked for. Fiancé.’</p>

      <p>The Slumdog Millionaire actress was previously dating her co-star Dev Patel, 28, after the release of the movie in 2009 to 2014.</p>
      <p>Freida and Cory weren’t spotted together until October 2017 and went public with their romance at the US Open a year later.</p>
      <p>The star took her beau to India and Nepal earlier this year, showing him around the local areas.</p>
      <p>She showed him where she grew up in Mumbai and even met her parents for the first time ever.</p>
