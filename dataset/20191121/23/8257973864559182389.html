      <p>Nov. 21 (UPI) -- The <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Chicago-White-Sox/?tps=1">Chicago White Sox</a> agreed to terms with free-agent catcher Yasmani Grandal on a long-term contract, the team announced Thursday.</p>
      <p>The White Sox reached an agreement with Grandal on a four-year, $73 million deal, according to the team. The All-Star catcher will receive $18.25 million per season through 2023, making it the largest contract in White Sox franchise history.</p>
      <p>The team <a href="https://twitter.com/whitesox/status/1197560310237999110">announced</a> that outfielder Daniel Palka was designated for assignment in a corresponding roster move.</p>
      <p>"Obviously [an] exciting day for us around here, being able to add one of the elite talents at a premium position," White Sox general manager Rick Hahn <a href="https://www.mlb.com/whitesox/news/yasmani-grandal-signs-with-white-sox">told reporters</a>. "Someone who is going to improve not only our offensive approach but a significant assist to us defensively, both in terms of what he does behind the plate but also what he does with our young and growing pitching staff."</p>

      <p>Last off-season, Grandal rejected a $17.9 million qualifying offer from the <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Los-Angeles-Dodgers/?tps=1">Los Angeles Dodgers</a> and turned down a four-year, $60 million contract from the <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/New-York-Mets/?tps=1">New York Mets</a>. He bet on himself to have a career year and instead signed a one-year, $18.25 million deal with the Milwaukee Brewers in January 2019.</p>
      <p>Grandal posted career highs in home runs (28) and RBIs (77) and made his second All-Star appearance this season. He also led all MLB catchers in games played (153) and ranked second in extra-base hits (56), total bases (240) and RBIs.</p>
      <p>After the season, Grandal declined to exercise his half of a $16 million mutual option with the Brewers for the 2020 campaign, with a $2.25 million buyout, to become a free agent.</p>
      <p>Grandal, who tops all major league catchers with 117 homers since 2015, has a career .241 batting average with 141 home runs and 416 RBIs across eight seasons with the Brewers, Dodgers and <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/San-Diego-Padres/?tps=1">San Diego Padres</a>.</p>
