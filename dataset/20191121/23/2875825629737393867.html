      <p>Sophia and Caitlyn have both insisted they're just friends and that their relationship is not physical, but it's highly believed they are engaged.</p>
      <p>In October last year, the 23-year-old said in an interview for podcast <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=76202X1526515&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fus%2Fpodcast%2Fhidden-truth-show%2Fid1348897500%3Fmt%3D2&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mirror.co.uk%2F3am%2Fcelebrity-news%2Fcaitlyn-jenners-fiance-sophia-hutchins-13355909">Hidden Truth With Jim Breslo</a> : "I wouldn't describe it as a romantic relationship.</p>
      <p>"I would describe our relationship as we're partners, um, you know we're business partners. I'm the executive director of her foundation. You know we have so much in common, we see the world so similarly and we both are such a good match for each other because we challenge each other.</p>
      <p>"She challenges me in so many ways and has allowed me to grow in so many ways and I hope I challenge her to grow. And you know because we share so many of the same passions and views, you know, it's such a great match a great partnership."</p>

      <p>Sophia also told the host she didn't feel it was "important" for people to know what's going on between her and Caitlyn.</p>
      <p>She said: "No I think it's unfortunate that the media is fixated on to 'is it romantic? or is it not?' I don't think we need to talk about "is it romantic or not?</p>
      <p>"We are partners in everything we do, we're inseparable, we're business partners, we live together, we share a dog, we share a family, we share a life together but as far as caving into the media and having one of us label it something, we're not going to do that."</p>
      <p>And responding to the rumours that they're engaged, Sophia said she'd let everyone know if that was the case.</p>

      <p>She said: "If I was engaged, I would announce that I was engaged. If Caitlyn and I were to be engaged then we would announce that.</p>
      <p>"We're not ashamed of our relationship at all but we do like to have some privacy and that's something that we would decide when the time was right to announce."</p>
