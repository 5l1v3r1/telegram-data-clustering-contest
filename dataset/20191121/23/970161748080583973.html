      <p>‘Climate emergency’ has been declared ‘word of the year’ after experts found the use of the term increased by over 10,000 per cent in the last 12 months.</p>
      <p>Oxford Dictionaries said the phrase soared from ‘relative obscurity’ to ‘one of the most prominent and prominently debated terms of 2019.’</p>
      <p>They defined the phrase as ‘a situation in which urgent action is required to reduce or halt climate change and avoid potentially irreversible environmental damage resulting from it’.</p>
      <p>According to the dictionary’s data, usage of ‘climate emergency’ soared hundred-fold, or 10,796%, from 2018.</p>
      <p>High profile activists such as teenager Greta Thunberg and Extinction Rebellion have pushed climate crisis firmly on the national agenda of many countries.</p>
      <p>Oxford Dictionaries said the choice reflected not only the rise in climate awareness, but the focus specifically on the language we use to discuss it.</p>

      <p>2019 saw ‘climate’ become the most common word associated with ‘emergency’ in public discourse.</p>

      <p>Oxford said the use of ‘climate emergency’ as opposed to ‘climate change’ reflected a conscious push towards language of immediacy and urgency.</p>
      <p>The selection panel said: ‘In 2018, climate did not feature in the top words typically used to modify emergency, instead the top types of emergencies people wrote about were health, hospital, and family emergencies.</p>
      <p>‘But with climate emergency, we see something new, an extension of emergency to the global level.’</p>
      <p>Hundreds of cities, towns and even countries have declared climate emergencies’ during 2019.</p>
      <p>The UK parliament declared one in May, a month after Extinction Rebellion protesters glued themselves to trains and brought parts of central London to a standstill to protest the government’s lack of action on the matter.</p>
      <p>Canada, France and Sydney in Australia have also declared climate emergencies.</p>

      <p>The Word of the Year started in 1971 and is chosen to ‘reflect the ethos, mood, or preoccupations of the passing year’.</p>
      <p>Oxford say the chosen word should have a ‘lasting cultural impact’, with previous winners including ‘toxic’ and ‘youthquake’.</p>
      <p>‘Climate emergency’  beat the words ‘climate crisis’, ‘climate action’ ‘climate denial’, ‘extinction’ and ‘plant-based’, which were on the shortlist.</p>
      <p>Linguists say two words can count as one word when ‘single words consist of two parts’.</p>
      <p>Explaining their decision, an Oxford spokesperson  said: ‘In 2019, climate emergency surpassed all of those other types of emergency to become the most written about emergency by a huge margin, with over three times the usage frequency of health, the second-ranking word’.</p>
