      <p>Edible Arrangements is taking the edible part of its name seriously.</p>
      <p>The company long known for selling chocolate-covered fruit bouquets is breaking into <a href="https://nypost.com/2018/10/29/everything-you-need-to-know-about-cbd/">the buzzy CBD market</a> with hemp-derived edibles.</p>
      <p>Edible Arrangements is debuting a line called “Incredible Edibles,” products that are infused with the non-psychoactive cannabis ingredient, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/21/business/edible-arrangements-cbd/index.html">reports CNN Business</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.ediblearrangements.com/edibles/">The products</a> — which fittingly include chocolate-dipped strawberries and chocolate-dipped apple bites, as well as smoothies and baked goods — are only available for now in Dallas, Texas. But the line will grow to 200 stores around the country by the end of 2019.</p>
      <p>Eating CBD will not get you stoned, which is why the company is describing the new line as “Health, Not High.” As popularity for CBD has surged over the last year, it’s been praised for helping with pain and insomnia. However, as CNN notes, there’s not much clinical research to show its effectiveness and the Food &amp; Drug Administration has not yet decided how to regulate CBD products derived from hemp.</p>
      <p>Edible Arrangements says it’s using CBD “sourced strictly from trusted, federally compliant and experienced farms practicing advanced and organic agricultural techniques.” What’s more, it also goes through “rigorous testing and verification” to ensure there isn’t a “trace of contaminants, pesticides or additives.”</p>
