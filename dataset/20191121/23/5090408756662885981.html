        <li><a href="https://www.insider.com/category/kim-kardashian">Kim Kardashian</a> West recently made headlines when she appeared to be wearing the same exact <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/engagement-ring">engagement ring</a> that was stolen when she was robbed at gunpoint in Paris in 2016.</li>
        <li>But Kardashian West revealed that she had actually borrowed the ring from Lorraine Schwartz, who also designed the stolen 20-carat emerald-cut <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/rings">ring</a> that <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/kanye-west">Kanye West</a> had given her in 2016.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.insider.com/category/kardashian">Kardashian</a> West said Schwartz had a “little fake” replica of the engagement ring, which she borrowed for a recent photo shoot.</li>
        <li>The reality TV star and her sisters <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/khloe-kardashian">Khloe</a> and <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/kourtney-kardashian">Kourtney Kardashian</a> wore more than $30 million worth of diamonds for the photo shoot to promote Kardashian West’s new fragrances.</li>

      <p>Fans are used to seeing Kim Kardashian West dripping in jewels, but one recent photo shoot left them feeling confused.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.insider.com/kim-kardashian-realized-kimono-is-offensive-for-shapewear-kuwtk-recap-2019-11">Kardashian West made headlines</a> when she appeared to be wearing the same exact engagement ring that was stolen when she was robbed at gunpoint during Paris Fashion Week in 2016.</p>
      <p>The 20-carat emerald cut ring was suddenly back on the reality television star’s finger in photos for her new KKW fragrances – or so it seemed.</p>

      <p>But the $4 million sparkler, which husband Kanye West gave her in 2016, has not been returned to Kardashian West, as some fans had hoped.</p>
      <p>Kardashian West revealed on Tuesday that she had actually borrowed all the jewelry from Lorraine Schwartz, who designed the stolen engagement ring as well as the first 15-carat engagement ring that West gave her in 2013.</p>
      <p>“I borrowed all jewelry from Lorraine Schwartz,” Kardashian West told <a href="https://www.etonline.com/kim-kardashian-explains-the-return-of-her-massive-engagement-ring-as-skims-restock-arrives">Entertainment Tonight’s Lauren Zima</a>. “It was nice to borrow it all and nice to give it back to her.”</p>
      <p>“That was a really fun shoot,” she added. “And because it was diamonds, I thought this was the perfect way to bring it back and wear them again.”</p>

      <p>Kardashian West appeared alongside her sisters Khloe and Kourtney for the shoot, where they wore diamonds worth more than $30 million, according to <a href="https://people.com/style/kourtney-khloe-kim-kardashian-30-million-worth-diamonds-kkw-fragrance-shoot/">People</a>.</p>
      <p>Photos from the shoot show the Kardashian sisters dripping with diamond bracelets, necklaces, rings, and earrings. They each wore their hair completely slicked back, leading many fans to comment that <a href="https://www.insider.com/kardashian-sisters-look-alike-in-photo-2019-11">they looked like triplets</a>.</p>

      <p>They had each designed <a href="https://www.insider.com/kim-kardashian-interrupts-kourtney-pcas-red-carpet-interview-kkw-diamond-2019-11">one of the three new perfumes</a>, which Kardashian West is calling “The Diamond Collection.”</p>
      <p>Kardashian West revealed that she often borrows jewels from Schwartz, a family friend who she said “always knows the cut and everything that I really wanted.”</p>
      <p>Included among those jewels is a replica of her stolen engagement ring.</p>
      <p>“There is a replica around,” Kardashian West told Entertainment Tonight. “A little fake that I’ll borrow from her sometimes that she made. A really nice one. It looks really nice.”</p>
      <p>The location of Kardashian West’s 20-carat engagement ring still remains unknown.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.insider.com/how-robbers-stole-from-kim-kardashian-2016-10">A year after Kardashian West was robbed</a>, suspected ringleader Aomar Ait Khedache told police that all of Kardashian West’s jewelry had been melted down except for her engagement ring, which had to be sold to a private buyer because it was so recognizable.</p>
      <p>“There is a person who has it,” he told police, according to <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/police-justice/article/2017/01/28/le-recit-de-l-organisateur-du-braquage-de-kim-kardashian_5070501_1653578.html">Le Monde</a>. “Everyone was afraid to sell it because it’s a stone that’s very easily spotted.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.insider.com/kim-kardashian-instagram-social-media-paris-robbery-likes-mental-health-2019-11">The experience had a major effect on Kardashian West</a>, who revealed that it completely changed the way she now uses social media.</p>
      <p>“I learned from a bad experience I had when I was robbed that people really knew my every move,” she said during The New York Times’ DealBook conference on November 6.</p>
      <p>“They knew what I had, they knew where I was, what I was doing, and that to me really changed the things that I post.”</p>
      <p>Representatives for Kim Kardashian West did not immediately respond to Insider’s request for comment.</p>
