      <h1>Cop must be punished for calling woman ‘total stripper’ on bodycam: lawyer</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T23:20:45+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 23:20</time> by <a rel="author">Rebecca Rosenberg</a></address>
      <p>The NYPD must discipline the officers who allegedly <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/11/nypd-bodycam-shows-cop-ogling-a-total-stripper-court-papers/">lied about a yoga instructor’s drunk-driving bust</a> and called her a “total stripper,” her lawyers said Thursday after learning that the NYPD has launched an Internal Affairs Bureau probe into the accusations.</p>
      <p>“We are pleased that IAB is looking into these serious allegations. This officer expressed irrational hatred of a cooperative young woman, who he then demeaned to his buddies,” attorney Mark Bederow said Thursday. “Even worse, the video evidence supports our contention that he arrested our client because he was ‘pissed off’ and then falsified evidence in the same manner he was accused of previously, which led the DA to dismiss another case and the city to settle a lawsuit.”</p>
      <p>Bodycam video allegedly shows that Officer John Mascetti lied about Yael Glantz, 26, failing a breath test when she was arrested Aug. 8, 2019.</p>
      <p>Mascetti, 35, and his partner, members of the NYPD’s Citywide Traffic Task Force, pulled Glantz over near the Empire State Building.</p>
      <p>The bodycam footage allegedly shows Mascetti’s growing irritation with Glantz as she unsuccessfully tries to take a portable breath test four times before he slaps her in cuffs.</p>
      <p>But Mascetti wrote in arrest paperwork — and told the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office — that Glantz blew a .15 on the breath test, according to Bederow.</p>
      <p>On the drive to the 7th Precinct station house, with Glantz in the backseat, Mascetti was captured on his partner’s body camera in a group chat with another cop, who’s identified in the texts as “HC” and Hernandez.</p>
      <p>Mascetti calls Glantz a “bitch,” a “total stripper” and a “blonde Russian” in the text exchange, and Hernandez responds by asking him to send a picture.</p>

      <p>“We also expect IAB to identify and discipline officer Hernandez, who shamefully asked Mascetti to send him unauthorized pictures of our client,” Bederow said. </p>
      <p>The lawyer has previously said that Glantz is not Russian and has never worked as a stripper.</p>
      <p>This isn’t the first time Mascetti has been accused of falsifying breath test reports.</p>
      <p><a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/14/nypd-cop-seen-ogling-total-stripper-on-bodycam-was-sued-before/">Antonio Diaz sued Mascetti</a> and two other officers for false arrest after they wrote in paperwork he’d refused to take a breath test six times after a 2011 drunk-driving bust.</p>
      <p>He said in his lawsuit that he took the test and it registered a 0 blood-alcohol level. The Manhattan DA’s Office dismissed the criminal case, and the city later settled the suit for $42,500.</p>
      <p>In a 2013 suit, Jesus Garcia accused Mascetti of brutally beating him while handcuffed during a 2012 arrest for short-changing a cabbie. The city later settled for $1.125 million.</p>
      <p>In a Nov. 16 letter to Manhattan Assistant DA Jinah Roe, Bederow asks her to disclose whether Mascetti’s conduct in the Diaz and Garcia suits landed him on their <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/04/22/court-battle-ignites-over-bad-cop-list-of-nypd-officers/">“naughty cop” list</a>.</p>
      <p>The internal databases, maintained by the DA’s offices in all five boroughs, identify cops with credibility issues.</p>
      <p>“An agency whose motto is ‘courtesy, professionalism, respect’ must have no tolerance for this type of behavior,” Bederow said. “The scary part is that we wouldn’t even know the depth of what happened if another officer didn’t unwittingly film himself.”</p>
