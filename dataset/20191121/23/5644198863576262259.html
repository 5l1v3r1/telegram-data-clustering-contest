      <p>JERUSALEM: Israel's attorney general said he would announce later on Thursday (Nov 21) his decision on whether to indict Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over alleged corruption.</p>
      <p>Netanyahu has denied any wrongdoing in the three corruption cases, saying he is a victim of a political witch-hunt.</p>

      <p>Attorney-General Avichai Mandelblit will disclose his decision at a news conference at 7.30pm, a Justice Ministry statement said. Police recommended in February that he file criminal charges against Netanyahu in the long-running investigations.</p>
      <p>Netanyahu is suspected of wrongfully accepting US$264,000 worth of gifts, which prosecutors said included cigars and champagne, from tycoons and of dispensing favours in alleged bids for improved coverage by an Israeli newspaper and a website.</p>
      <p>He could face up to 10 years in prison if convicted of bribery and a maximum 3-year term for fraud and breach of trust.</p>
      <p>An indictment against Netanyahu, Israel's longest-serving leader, would raise more uncertainty over who will ultimately lead a country mired in political chaos after two inconclusive elections this year.</p>
