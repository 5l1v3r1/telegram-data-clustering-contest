      <h1>Week 12 Fantasy PPR RB Rankings</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T23:11:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 23:11</time> by <a rel="author">Billy Heyen</a></address>
      <p>Our Week 12 fantasy PPR RB rankings offer a perfect time to talk about Kareem Hunt. I saw lots of analysts last week speculating that he wouldn't even be valuable in PPR leagues, which seemed absurd after seven catches in his Browns debut. We liked his usage enough to recommend him as a standard league FLEX play, but we'll stick with the PPR goodness for now. After being targeted nine times two weeks ago, Hunt received eight targets and caught six in Week 11. That's despite the Browns being in full control for most of the game. They simply want to get Hunt involved, and after two straight double-digit fantasy point outings, we shouldn't have to convince you about Hunt any longer. He also gets to dominate Miami in Week 12, just a bonus.</p>
      <p>Marlon Mack's injury has the potential to make two running backs usable in PPR leagues from Indy for Thursday Night Football. Jonathan Williams will be the favored waiver claim, and he did turn a screen pass into 31 yards in Week 11, but that was his only target. His teammate Nyheim Hines saw four targets and caught three after being targeted seven times the week before. Increased usage for Hines should be in the cards against Houston.</p>

      </p>
      <p>We also saw another back likely to be a popular pickup, Derrius Guice, catch a short pass and turn it into big yardage (45-yard TD). That was one of just two targets for Guice, though, so don't read too much into that for PPR purposes, although Guice should have no problem gaining yardage wherever he wants against Detroit in Week 12.</p>

      </p>
      <p>PPR fantasy owners will have to deal with a number of significant RB absences due to bye, including Dalvin Cook, Melvin Gordon, Austin Ekeler, Damien Williams and Kenyan Drake. That means sleepers even further down these rankings could matter.</p>

      <p>Kalen Ballage somehow managed 12 fantasy points in Week 11 due in part to his five catches despite gaining only 17 total yards, so he's an option. Since taking over for Mark Walton, Ballage has nine catches. Miles Sanders continues to see passing-game usage for Philly and has a higher workload if Jordan Howard (stinger) is out again. Jaylen Samuels should see an uptick in value, too, assuming James Conner (shoulder) misses Week 12. And if you need a really deep dive, Lions' RB J.D. McKissic has been targeted at least four times for three straight weeks.</p>
