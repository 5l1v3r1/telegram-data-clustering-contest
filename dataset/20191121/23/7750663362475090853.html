      <p>Watford entered their game with Norwich City before the international break as the only side in English football's top four divisions not to have won a league game this season but <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/premier-league/norwich-city-vs-watford_game_92621.html">goals from</a> <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/gerard-deulofeu/"><b>Gerard Deulofeu</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/andre-gray/"><b>Andre Gray</b></a> ensured that they lost that tag with room to spare.</p>
      <p>It may not be easy on the eye or particularly entertaining, but Flores has got the Hornets much tighter with five at the back, as shown by the fact that they've lost just one of their last five league games.</p>
      <p>The 5-3-2 that the Spaniard has been employing allows Watford to sit deep, work a low block and attack with pace on the counter, a tactic they'll be looking to exploit against a Burnley side that have struggled to defend counters this season.</p>
      <p>The victory over Norwich ended a run of 15 games without a win in the league for the Hornets and they will be looking to end a similar streak on Saturday; Watford are without a win in their last 10 at Vicarage Road and the club have never got 11 at home without winning in their league history.</p>

      <p>Burnley ended a three-match losing run before the international break by <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/premier-league/burnley-vs-west-ham-united_game_92615.html">thumping West Ham United 3-0</a> at Turf Moor.</p>
      <p>Dyche's men have not been as tight defensively in recent times as they have been in previous campaigns, conceding in each of their last 13 games away from home.</p>
      <p>Key to their hopes of getting a win on the road on Saturday will be attacking down the wings, as this has been both an area of strength for them and a problem area for Watford this season.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/dwight-mcneil/"><b>Dwight McNeil</b></a>'s pace, trickery and delivery of the ball means that <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/ashley-barnes/"><b>Ashley Barnes</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/chris-wood/"><b>Chris Wood</b></a> will always get chances, while <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jeff-hendrick/"><b>Jeff Hendrick</b></a> proved a more than adequate replacement for <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/johann-berg-gudmundsson/"><b>Johann Berg Gudmundsson</b></a> last time out.</p>
      <p>Additionally, despite only taking a point off Watford last season, Burnley have lost just once in their last five visits to Vicarage Road.</p>

      <p>Watford are without <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/tom-cleverley/"><b>Tom Cleverley</b></a>, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/roberto-pereyra/"><b>Roberto Pereyra</b></a>, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/domingos-quina/"><b>Domingos Quina</b></a>, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/sebastian-prodl/"><b>Sebastian Prodl</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/danny-welbeck/"><b>Danny Welbeck</b></a> for Saturday's game, while <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/christian-kabasele/"><b>Christian Kabasele</b></a> is suspended and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/ismaila-sarr/"><b>Ismaila Sarr</b></a> is a doubt.</p>
      <p>Flores will be boosted by the return of <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/troy-deeney/"><b>Troy Deeney</b></a>, who could be in line for a start after getting extra time to recover in the international break, although Gray will be pushing for a place in the starting lineup after scoring last time out.</p>
      <p>The Spaniard will also have to choose between <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jose-holebas/"><b>Jose Holebas</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/adam-masina/"><b>Adam Masina</b></a> for the starting left-back role, as Masina's pace could be useful on the counter even if Holebas is probably better defensively.</p>
      <p>Burnley are without Gudmundsson, who is still out with a thigh problem, while <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/danny-drinkwater/"><b>Danny Drinkwater</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/matej-vydra/"><b>Matej Vydra</b></a> are doubts.</p>
      <p>As such, Dyche is expected to name a very similar side to the one that beat West Ham before the break.</p>
      <p><b>Watford possible starting lineup:</b><br/>Foster; Janmaat, Cathcart, Dawson, Mariappa, Holebas; Doucoure, Capoue, Hughes; Deulofeu, Deeney</p>
      <p><b>Burnley possible starting lineup:</b><br/>Pope; Bardsley, Tarkowski, Mee, Taylor; Hendrick, Cork, Westwood, McNeil; Wood, Barnes</p>

      <h3>We say: Watford 1-1 Burnley</h3>
      <p>Burnley may be the better side on paper but their struggles away from Turf Moor and Watford's improved form and greater defensive stability in recent weeks should see this one end in a draw.</p>
