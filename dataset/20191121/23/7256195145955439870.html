      <h3>the other day i witnessed a man seize with epilepsy in the produce section</h3>
      <p>then the bottom fell out of the plastic bag<br/>on the long diaspora between self-checkout<br/>and the deserts of the kitchen counter<br/>i felt like napoleon the morning after waterloo<br/>surveying the onions of his empire, rolling away<br/>down the sidewalk, and i wonder if he compensated<br/>for his defeat with, like, days on end of sweaty<br/>&amp; furious masturbation, or perhaps in the end<br/>it was something a bit more prosaic<br/>like lonely fishing along the waterfront<br/>or late night amazon retail therapy<br/>or maybe i am just projecting my own insecurities<br/>about my last breakup, which involved a heated argument<br/>about whether or not i would get to keep the KISS THE CHEF apron<br/>because i ordered it with her prime account<br/>which explains what i meant when i said<br/>things like free shipping are going to be the wedge<br/>we drive between ourselves and the people we love<br/>can’t you see the loyalty discounts<br/>are literally going to wipe us off the surface of earth<br/>like pizza crust crumbs or thumbs of butter on the counter<br/>which was one of the reasons she cited for her leaving<br/>i watch the onions roll in a tired lump towards the sewer<br/>and in a flooded council rubbish bin i see my reflection<br/>then consider writing a poem where i see my reflection<br/>and call it a self-checkout</p>
      <p>almost 200 years later they exhumed napoleon’s corpse<br/>which you could also call reopening the investigation<br/>because a whole lot more than the normal amount of arsenic<br/>was discovered in his hair follicles – a bizarre statistic, since<br/>who knew that there’s a baseline for arsenic content in hair<br/>this was all thanks to the journals of his valet which say<br/>i think they’ve been slowly poisoning his blueberry wheaties<br/>each morning for the last six years, and they way he slumps<br/>in his chair at the kitchen table every afternoon<br/>watching an onion for hours on end doesn’t seem normal</p>
      <p>please send help, i said to my therapist<br/>because i’ve been dreaming in french seinfeld<br/>i’m living in self-imposed exile on saint helena<br/>and following contemporary religious trends<br/>this is all a form of resistance, she contends<br/>an unwillingness to confront the true fruits<br/>of your you are so you, but you knew that<br/>and now it seems to be seeping into your<br/>subconscious like hot, fetid garbage juice<br/>and i sit in the seat contemplating my hands<br/>like they’ve turned into two microwave trays<br/>then i look up at her and say yeah….but….<br/>wouldn’t that just make everything i write<br/>one form of a resistance poem or another?<br/>and as she goes to write something down<br/>there comes a great rumble from somewhere outside<br/>and the sky cleaves open and the couch &amp; clinical<br/>psychology books &amp; monstera &amp; us &amp; all our upholstery<br/>go crashing straight through the ceiling<br/>like a bunch of onions</p>
