      </p>
      <p>The 39-year-old played 125 NHL games for the Tampa Bay Lightning between the2000-01 and 2002-03 seasons. He has a longstanding working relationship with Toronto general manager Kyle Dubas dating back to when Dubas hired Keefe to coach Ontario Hockey League's Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds in 2012.</p>
      <p>When Dubas made the jump from the OHL to NHL as an assistant GM in Toronto, he oversaw the Leafs' farm team —the Toronto Marlies. Dubasquickly <a href="http://www.nhl.com/news/sheldon-keefe-hired-as-coach-of-ahl-toronto-marlies/c-770278">brought Keefe on board in June 2015</a> when he hired him to coach in the AHL. The Marlies <a href="https://theahl.com/championship-teams">won the Calder Cup in 2018</a>just before Dubas was promoted to take theGM job for the Leafs.</p>
      <p>The duo has now made it all the way to the NHL's highest-pressure environment after Keefe's <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/ca/nhl/news/toronto-maple-leafs-make-high-stakes-bet-swapping-mike-babcock-for-sheldon-keefe/16v9h7wevzteg1todauuliexq7">mid-season replacement of Mike Babcock</a>.</p>
      <p>Keefe's first game as Toronto's head coach — and first as an NHL coach at all—comes Thursday in Arizona against the Coyotes.</p>
