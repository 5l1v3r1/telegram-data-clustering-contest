      <p>She found out the horrifying news that she would be completing tomorrow's Bushtucker Trial, Snake Hotel.</p>
      <p>Her eyes went wide before she laughed nervously.</p>
      <p>Her camp mates immediately rushed to comfort her as she threw her head in her hands and exclaimed "No! On my own!?"</p>
      <p>Rallying around her, her campmates rubbed her back and assured her she would be fine.</p>
      <p>Myles Stephenson hugged her as she complained she was especially gutted to be doing the task alone.</p>
      <p>But this isn't the case.</p>

      <p>Extra Camp revealed that Jacqueline was given a choice of campmate to do the task with her, and she chose Myles.</p>
      <p>The pair will hunt for stars tomorrow night in a snake-infested hotel room in order to win meals for their campmates.</p>
      <p>The night saw some tension in the famously friendly camp.</p>
      <p>After achieving eight stars in their Bushtucker Trial, new campmates Cliff Parisi and Andy Whyment became Outlaws and were sent to the Jungle Jailhouse.</p>

      <p>The main camp had the opportunity to be "good, bad or downright ugly" - and either keep all the food themselves, or choose to feed the outlaws with their share of food.</p>
      <p>The twist with the second option was that two campmates would have to join the outlaws in the Jailhouse - but tempers flared over a difference in opinion.</p>
      <p>Andrew Maxwell and James Haskell both agreed they were happy to go to the jailhouse, while Kate Garraway and Ian Wright also said they would sacrifice themselves.</p>

      <p>Former footballer Ian suggested they should draw straws, so the group picked out named water bottles to decide who would go.</p>
      <p>However, Jacqueline said it was "scary" and admitted she did not want to leave the main camp.</p>
      <p>Kate asked if she would rather not go, while Ian said she didn't have to, but Jacqueline confessed: "Yeah but it’s not very heroic."</p>

      <p>Comedian Andrew Maxwell did not see the funny side and insisted everyone should be in the hat.</p>
      <p>He said: "I think it has to be everyone in, I don’t think it’s fair to count yourself out."</p>
      <p>Rugby star James said Jacqueline should not be forced to go, but Andrew argued: "It’s an ordeal that has to be shared."</p>
