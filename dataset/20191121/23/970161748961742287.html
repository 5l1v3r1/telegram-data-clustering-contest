        <b>Normani has been named Rihanna’s lingerie company Savage X Fenty’s first-ever Brand Ambassador and we’re crying tears of joy.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Love Lies singer posted some snaps on Instagram of herself looking jaw-droppingly stunning in the brand’s lingerie and told fans to believe in themselves.</p>
      <p>‘I’m the first ever brand ambassador for @savagexfenty !!! I love you @badgalriri,’ the 23-year-old started.</p>
      <p>‘I want all individuals to feel empowered and to embrace who they truly are. I don’t always wake up feeling the most confident and powerful, but trust and believe having my Savage X on always helps!!’</p>
      <p>With you as Brand Ambassador, Normani, everyone’s going to be feeling empowered.</p>
      <p>The best thing about this honour is that Rihanna took notice of the power that is Normani.</p>
      <p>The singer was asked to dance at her Savage X Fenty runway show this September, so it’s only right RiRi brings in another Queen to her brand.</p>

      <p>Normani also completed an interview with Vogue on her journey with Rihanna and her business, complimenting the entrepreneur for her ‘fearlessness’.</p>
      <p>She said: ‘[Rihanna has] had so much influence on me in terms of pop culture and as a woman, but also in terms of how she’s able to do things gracefully while being cutting edge, being bold, pushing the needle, and changing the narrative.</p>
      <p>‘I think that being a part of Savage X Fenty is an amazing opportunity for me to show women that I’m also here for them too. I love how inclusive the brand is. Being a part of the show and being able to have the opportunity to dance and do what I love was so powerful.</p>
      <p>‘It was great to be among so many amazing human beings who deserve to be celebrated because they’re all beautiful—all shapes, all sizes.’</p>
      <p>We already know the Motivation singer is the perfect choice for Rihanna’s business style.</p>
      <p>Now, all we need to do is buy everything from the holiday collection.</p>
