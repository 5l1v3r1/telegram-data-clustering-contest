        <b>LABOUR has been warned its plan for an £11billion oil “windfall tax” could kill off the North Sea industry and risk 120,000 jobs.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Jeremy Corbyn announced the cash raid in a hard-left manifesto in which he vowed to nationalise rail and utilities and ramp up public spending.</p>

      <p>The Labour leader also pledged that if he gets into No10 after the General Election he’ll bin the Tories’ proposal to raise the state pension age to 67, and instead freeze it at 66.</p>
      <p>But he faced an immediate backlash over the oil windfall tax — which he hopes will help fund a “green industrial revolution”.</p>
      <p>Rivals and industry chiefs insisted it could backfire and chase away investors.</p>
      <p>And one expert claimed the “misguided” plans could speed up the death of the North Sea industry.</p>
      <p>It came after Mr Corbyn told how he was coming for firms who profited during the oil boom years as part of a bid to make the UK zero- carbon “within the 2030s”.</p>
      <p>At his party’s manifesto launch in Birmingham, he claimed the one-off levy would fund schemes such as those to retrain workers.</p>
      <p>He said: “We can no longer deny the climate emergency — we can see it all around as recent floods have shown. We have no time to waste.</p>
      <p>“The crisis demands swift action. But it isn’t right to load the costs of the climate emergency on to the nurse, the builder or the energy worker.</p>

      <p>“So a Labour government will ensure the big oil and gas corporations that profit from heating up our planet will pay their fair share of the burden.”</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn said North Sea oil and gas workers had “powered this country for decades, often working under dangerous conditions” — and vowed: “We won’t hang them out to dry.”</p>
      <p>And he claimed a new “Just Transition Fund” would “safeguard a future for their skills with new careers and secure well-paid jobs”.</p>
      <p>Labour said it would cover “the 36,800 workers employed directly in the UK’s offshore oil and gas sector”.</p>
      <p>But rivals pointed out that when indirect and supply chain jobs are taken into account, the figure is actually 120,000.</p>
      <p>Labour said the windfall tax would be “raised on UK-based oil and gas companies that have extracted oil and gas from the UK continental shelf”.</p>
      <p>And they claimed Britain could have raked in an extra £117billion since 1992 if we’d collected the same level of tax per barrel as other North Sea countries such as Norway.</p>
      <p>But oil economics expert Professor Alex Kemp said: “The idea of a windfall tax on North Sea oil is misguided.</p>
      <p>“Since the collapse in oil prices in 2014, North Sea investment has plunged from around £15billion to £5billion. Increased capital spending is needed to maximise economic recovery and this tax would endanger this.”</p>
      <p>Prof Kemp, of Aberdeen Uni’s Business School, said Norway’s higher taxes reflect the fact it’s been cheaper to drill there.</p>
      <p>He added: “To increase taxes now will lead to investment being stymied. And, if it’s significant, it could speed up decline. Investment will fall and production will fall faster.”</p>
      <p>That point was echoed by Gareth Wynn, for industry body Oil and Gas UK.</p>
      <p>He said: “Any increase will drive investors away and damage long-term competitiveness, threatening jobs and future tax revenues and needlessly damaging the economy.”</p>
      <p>Tory Colin Clark, standing for re-election as MP for Gordon, said: “This tax would threaten more than 100,000 jobs, many based in and around Aberdeen.”</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn vowed to focus on renewable energy and create a million new jobs.</p>
      <p>He boasted: “This manifesto is the most radical and ambitious plan to transform our country in decades.”</p>
      <p>As we told, Labour claim they would dole out an extra £100billion to Scotland over the next decade.</p>
      <p>But the SNP accused them of copying their policies in areas like free uni tuition, free prescriptions and votes at 16.</p>
      <p>Nats Westminster leader Ian Blackford said: “Much of what Labour claim is radical is already long-standing government policy in Scotland.”</p>
      <p>Labour’s plans would see the UK Government taking over “the supply arms of the Big Six energy companies”, including Glasgow-based Scottish Power and Perth-based SSE.</p>
      <p>An SSE spokeswoman said: “This is a time for working together to tackle the climate crisis, not waste years attempting a very costly, complex and controversial nationalisation.”</p>
      <p>Scottish Power didn’t comment.</p>
