      <p>A gunman opened fire on a busy road close to a pub and its customers.</p>
      <p>Emergency services were called to the junction of Southport Road and Breeze Hill, in <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/bootle">Bootle</a> , shortly after 9pm to reports of gunshots.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/merseyside-police">Armed police</a> at the scene say they found evidence that a gun had been fired close to the Mons pub before a cordon was put in place.</p>
      <p>A witness at the scene said they heard what sounded like “three quick bangs” before police arrived a few minutes later.</p>
      <p>Detectives investigating the shooting say they believe the shots were fired from a car.</p>
      <p>No one is believed to have been injured in the incident but road users are being asked to avoid the area.</p>

      <p>A spokesperson for Merseyside Police said: “Detectives are investigating after shots were fired in Bootle tonight, Thursday 21 November.</p>
      <p>“At 9.15pm, reports came in of shots being heard in Breeze Hill.</p>
      <p>“Armed officers attended and evidence was found of shots being fired close to the Mons public house.</p>
      <p>“A cordon and road closure is now in place at the junction of Breeze Hill with Southport Road as enquiries continue, and we would ask that road users avoid the area at this time.”</p>
      <p>Detective Chief Inspector Gayle Rooney said: “We’re looking to establish exactly what has gone on, but we know that shots were fired close to a public house on a busy road, possibly involving occupants of a vehicle or vehicles nearby.</p>
      <p>“No injuries appear to have been caused but to fire a gun on such a busy street with local residents at home and on the streets is beyond belief.</p>
      <p>“Recent weeks have seen a lot of positive action against those who use weapons, deal drugs and bring risk to our communities. Stand with us, tell us what you know, and we’ll respond.”  <br/><br/>You can contact @MerPolCC or 101 with reference 892, or via the independent charity Crimestoppers on  0800 555 111 .</p>
