      <h1>Sage Northcutt ‘super excited’ for sister’s return to MMA with ONE Championship</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T23:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 23:00</time> by <a rel="author">Guilherme Cruz, https://facebook.com/guicruzmma/</a></address>
      <p>Colbey Northcutt will make her return to mixed martial arts against Putri Padmi in a flyweight bout at Friday’s ONE Championship: Edge of Greatness in Singapore, and her brother <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/3363/sage-northcutt">Sage Northcutt</a> is trilled to see her back in action 29 months after her debut in the sport.</p>
      <p>Colbey built a 4-1 record as an amateur before making the transition to pro in 2017, losing via second-round TKO to <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/4189/courtney-king">Courtney King</a> at LFA 14. The 26-year-old karate specialist has been practicing martial arts since she was seven, and was named Black Belt Magazine’s Competitor of the Year in 2009.</p>
      <p>Padmi also holds a 0-1 record as a professional after losing a decision to Dwi Ani Retno Wulan at ONE Championship in Nov. 2018.</p>
      <p>“I’m super excited for her first fight at ONE Championship,” Sage Northcutt told MMA Fighting. “It’s a great organization. Colbey has been training super hard at a gym with <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/289/mark-munoz">Mark Munoz</a> up here in California, so she’s been getting great training. I’m really excited to see her go out there and compete.”</p>
      <p>The reason why Northcutt hasn’t competed since 2017 is because she chose to focus on her personal life and getting her degree, her brother said.</p>
      <p>“She ended up getting married to <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/4902/raymond-daniels">Raymond Daniels</a>, who’s an awesome and incredible fighter,” Sage said, “And she was doing some stuff with the sport of karate and she’s was also completing her degree in broadcast journalism, so now it’s time for her to fight and she’s looking forward to it.”</p>
      <p>Both Northcutt siblings are under contract with ONE, but Sage won’t be competing at time soon as he’s <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/2019/11/8/20953298/sage-northcutt-doctor-clearance-resume-training-one-championship-mma?utm_campaign=mmafighting&amp;utm_content=chorus&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter">still recovering</a> from a severe injury suffered in his promotional debut in May. The lightweight fighter still seeks to win titles in MMA, muay thai and kickboxing at ONE, and is “absolutely” confident that Colbey can achieve the same.</p>
      <p>“Colbey is an incredible athlete,” Northcutt said. “Not only that, she’s super gifted and talented. She’s fast, she’s got incredible striking and grappling. I think she will do amazing and can definitely win the championship there.”</p>
