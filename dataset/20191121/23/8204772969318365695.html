      <h1>Higgins: Moral question of how Irish treat immigrants must be a concern</h1>
      <h2>President made comments while speaking at ceremony honouring 12 Irish emigrants</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T23:15:19+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 23:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishtimes.com/profile/mark-hilliard-7.3188395" target="_blank">Mark Hilliard</a></address>
      <p>Irish people should be more “deeply aware” than others of the moral obligation to welcome those fleeing persecution because of our own history with emigration, President <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Michael+D+Higgins">Michael D Higgins</a> has said.</p>
      <p>“The moral question of how we treat ‘the other’, ‘the stranger’ as arrival on our shores, or minority within our community, must be a central concern for all sections of society,” he said.</p>
      <p>President Higgins was speaking at a ceremony honouring 12 Irish emigrants who had made particular social contributions in their adopted countries.</p>
      <p>He used the occasion as a reminder of Ireland’s history with emigration, which he said seen had 10 million people leave since the 18th century.</p>
      <p>“We more than most should be deeply aware of our moral obligation to welcome those fleeing poverty, famine, persecution, war or natural disaster,” he said, at a reception for recipients of the 2019 Presidential Distinguished Service Award in Áras an Uachtaráin on Thursday evening.</p>
