      <p>TOKYO — Japan’s annual core consumer inflation ticked up only marginally in October despite the boost from a sales tax hike during the month, suggesting weak household sentiment is keeping companies from passing on the higher costs.</p>
      <p>The data underscores the challenge the Bank of Japan faces in firing up inflation to its elusive 2% target, as soft global demand and the U.S.-China trade war cloud the outlook for the export-reliant economy.</p>
      <p>The nationwide core consumer price index (CPI), which includes oil costs but excludes volatile fresh food prices, rose 0.4% in October from a year earlier, government data showed on Friday.</p>
      <p>That matched a median market forecast and followed a 0.3% increase in September. The CPI figure includes the impact of an increase in the sales tax rate to 10% from 8% that began in October.</p>
      <p>The so-called core-core inflation index, which excludes food and energy prices and is similar to the core index used in the United States, rose 0.7% in October from a year earlier.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Shinzo Abe proceeded with a twice-delayed sales tax hike in October as part of efforts to rein in Japan’s huge public debt.</p>
      <p>While the higher levy does not apply to some grocery and daily necessities, it would have pushed up overall consumer inflation if companies passed on the cost to households.</p>
      <p>But the boost from the tax increase may have been offset by discounts that companies offered for their goods to keep the higher burden from scaring away cost-sensitive consumers, some analysts say.</p>
      <p>Japan’s economy ground to a near standstill in the third quarter with growth at its weakest in a year as the U.S.-China trade war and soft global demand knocked exports, keeping pressure on policymakers to ramp up stimulus to bolster a fragile recovery.</p>
