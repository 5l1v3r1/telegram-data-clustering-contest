      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T23:33:02+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 23:33</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Paddy Barnes has announced his retirement from boxing.</p>
      <p>Two-time Olympic bronze medallist Barnes has called time on his professional career after suffering three defeats in his last four fights.</p>
      <p>The 32-year-old from Belfast fought nine times as a professional, winning six, and winning the WBO Inter-Continental flyweight title and the WBO European flyweight title, both in 2017.</p>
      <p>Barnes had a distinguished career as an amateur, representing Ireland at three Olympics, and winning medals at light-flyweight in Beijing and London.</p>
      <p>He won gold at the 2010 and 2014 Commonwealth Games while competing for Northern Ireland, and won the 2010 European Championships.</p>

      <p>Barnes said in a statement: "I have loved every minute of boxing - it has been my life for the last 21 years.</p>
      <p>"I have achieved my dream of becoming an Olympian and getting to carry the Irish flag at the Olympic Games opening ceremony. Those moments were the proudest of my career.</p>
      <p>“Professional boxing was never a dream of mine, but I tried and threw myself into the deep end straight away.</p>
      <p>"It didn’t work out but I wouldn’t have had it any other way. I’d like to thank my family for supporting me throughout my entire career, my wife Mari for keeping my feet firmly on the ground and helping me towards my goals.”</p>
      <p>Barnes had said last month he was considering his boxing future after being beaten by Jay Harris in a flyweight bout at the Ulster Hall for the IBF Inter-Continental flyweight title.</p>
      <p>He lost his one world title fight, to Cristofer Rosales for the WBC flyweight title, in 2018.</p>
      <p>On his professional debut in Belfast in 2016, Barnes was lifted into the air by his opponent Stefan Slavchev, who was then disqualified by the referee.</p>
      <p>In his statement Barnes went on to thank his parents, Jimmy Linden, Gerry Storey, Seamy McCann and Holy Family Boxing Club.</p>

      <p>He also thanked his professional coach Danny Vaughan as well as promoters MTK.</p>
      <p>Barnes added: “I am forever grateful, especially for my world title fight.”</p>
      <p>He finished his message with a thanks to the “fans that supported me”, adding “you all made it worthwhile. Thank you. The Leprechaun.”</p>
