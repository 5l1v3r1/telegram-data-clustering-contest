      <p>Billionaire businessman Michael Bloomberg, yet to officially declare himself a presidential candidate, took another step towards a run at the White House Thursday by registering with the US Federal Election Commission.</p>
      <p>The 77-year-old former mayor of New York filed paperwork to register a committee called "Mike Bloomberg 2020," commission spokeswoman Judith Ingram confirmed to AFP.</p>
      <p>All candidates must register with the commission if they want to raise or spend campaign funds of more than $5,000, but registration itself does not confirm that a candidate is running.</p>
      <p>Bloomberg has prepared the groundwork for a possible bid for the Democratic nomination in recent weeks, including registering as a candidate in the states of Alabama, Arkansas and Texas.</p>
      <p>A message on his website mikebloomberg.com says the site is "paid for by Mike Bloomberg 2020." Ten days ago he said he was "close" to making a final decision on whether or not to enter the crowded field.</p>
      <p>His personal fortune of $50 billion means a Bloomberg candidacy would likely shake up the open race, with 17 candidates already vying to be the Democratic nominee to take on President <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/donald-trump">Donald Trump </a>next year.</p>
      <p>Bloomberg's advisors have said that if he does run then he will probably not campaign in the four states that will hold primaries in February.</p>
      <p>Instead, he would focus on the 15 primaries scheduled for March 3, known as "Super Tuesday," including the most populous states of California and Texas.</p>
      <p>Former vice president Joe Biden leads the race ahead of left-wingers Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, with moderate Pete Buttigieg in fourth place, according to national polls.</p>
