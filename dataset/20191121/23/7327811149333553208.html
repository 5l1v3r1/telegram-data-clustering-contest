      <p>HILLSBOROUGH, New Jersey (WABC) -- The father of the bride at a wedding in New Jersey pulled off an epic surprise to make his daughter's big day even more special.</p>
      <p>Moments after Alex and Tommy Ellison walked down the aisle on Nov. 16, they were met with confusion and then tears when a flash mob broke out in song to "Going to the Chapel of Love."</p>
      <p>"So this was very risky on my part, because if this went sideways, I just ruined my daughter's wedding," Alex's dad Neil Hudes said.</p>
      <p>Only 12 of the 170 guests knew what was going on, and Hudes was the mastermind behind it all.</p>
      <p>"At first she was like, 'what is this' and then it turned into 'oh my god' and then turned into tears and when she saw Jake, more tears," Hudes said.</p>

      <p>The bride's brother, Jake, has autism and she really wanted the 28-year-old to be a part of her special day without overwhelming him.</p>
      <p>"When I approached him I wasn't quite sure how he was going to react, but he was all in, it was incredible," Hudes said.</p>
      <p>Everyone agreed - he nailed it.</p>
      <p>"What a relief, after it was all over for me, are you kidding, it was great, the rest of the wedding just flew, it was wonderful," Hudes said.</p>
      <p>It was a moment that Alex and her family - especially Jake - will never forget.</p>
