      <p>The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission in its spot daily report on Donbas warzone developments says the patrol heard shots fired from a large-caliber machine gun in the disengagement area near Petrivske.</p>
      <p>"On 20 November, positioned about 2km north of Petrivske, the SMM heard three bursts of heavy-machine-gun fire 2-3km south-south-west (assessed as inside the Petrivske disengagement area)," reads the <a href="https://www.osce.org/special-monitoring-mission-to-ukraine/439772?download=true">report</a>.</p>
      <p>Monitors add that, on the same day, positioned in Bohdanivka, "the SMM saw about 20 members of the State Emergency Service of Ukraine near the Petrivske disengagement area. A Ukrainian Armed Forces officer of the Joint Centre for Control and Co-ordination (JCCC) told the SMM that demining activities inside the area had been completed."</p>
      <p>Later that day, the SMM received a Note Verbale from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine informing the SMM about the completion of demining activities in certain areas inside the Petrivske disengagement area, as well as the removal of barriers, the clearance of the area from mines and other explosive ordnance and the fencing-off of additional areas assessed as to be contaminated with explosive ordnance.</p>
      <p>The SMM also received a letter from the armed formations about the completion of basic demining activities, a thorough inspection of the area and adjacent territories, as well as the fencing-off of areas assessed to be contaminated with unexploded ordnance (UXO).</p>
      <p>"Positioned in Bohdanivka, the <a href="https://www.unian.info/war/10753206-osce-smm-again-records-fire-shots-at-disengagement-site-near-petrivske-in-donbas.html">SMM </a>heard ten undetermined explosions and about 115 shots and bursts of heavy-machine-gun and (30mm) cannon fire, most of which were assessed as at a range of 2-3km south-south-east, south-east and south-south-west, and all as outside the disengagement area," the report says.</p>
      <p>As UNIAN reported, disengagement of forces was carried out on November 9 â€“ November 11 in the areas of Bohdanivka and Petrivske.</p>
      <p>On November 13, the practical phase of demining began on this site, having been completed on November 20.</p>
      <p>Today, November 21, measures began on dismantling fortifications and other military objects near Bohdanivka.</p>
