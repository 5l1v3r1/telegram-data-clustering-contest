      <p><a href="http://nme.com/artists/lily-allen">Lily Allen</a> has hit out after she posted a fake video of herself seemingly shedding tears over Labour’s manifesto.</p>
      <p>The singer posted a clip using AR filters on social media declaring: “Guys I just watched the Labour manifesto and I think it’s the best manifesto I’ve ever seen.”</p>
      <p>Shortly after the post, a number of newspapers reported that she was shedding tears over the manifesto and many social media users also thought she was genuinely emotional in the clip.</p>
      <p>One user wrote: “Lily Allen needs psychiatric help. There has never been a more hypocritical, self involved, champagne socialist than this creature,” while another also said: “Lily Allen. Crap singer and an attention seeker.”</p>

      <p>Many others were quick to point out that the video was fake and the singer has now criticised those for not realising it was.</p>
      <p>She also drew attention to the Tories recently causing a backlash after they confused users by changing their official press office Twitter account to FactCheckUK, to make it appear like an official fact checking site.</p>

      <p>She wrote: “Couldn’t tell if I was using a filter but you’d have to be an idiot not to realise that it was @CCHQ Press behind FactCheckUK.”</p>
      <p>Allen also went on to criticise those who thought she was crying real tears and those who support a no-deal Brexit.</p>
      <p>She added: “What’s the difference between people who thought I was crying real tears in my TikTok video today, and people who believe that cancelling our membership with the biggest trading bloc in the world, with no deal, is a good idea ? I’ll wait.”</p>
      <p>It comes just days after Allen faced a barrage of criticism after <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/lily-allen-faces-backlash-calling-rule-britannia-banned-2567253">calling for ‘Rule Britannia’ to be banned</a>.</p>
      <p>Taking aim at the track, which originated from a poem by James Thomson, she singled out the lyrics: <i>“Britons never, never, never shall be slaves. The nations, not so blest as thee, Must in their turn, to tyrants fall, While thous shalt flourish, shalt flourish great and free.”</i></p>
      <p>Allen said: “Sorry what? Britannia rule the waves… I think we should not read this song anymore.”</p>
      <p>The singer is currently living in the US, having vowed not to permanently return to the UK until “Brexit is sorted”.</p>
      <p>She recently also backed an open letter backing Extinction Rebellion, which was signed by a string of celebrities who <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/yes-hypocrites-say-artists-celebrities-extinction-rebellion-letter-2558124">admitted they were “hypocrites” for demanding change. </a></p>
