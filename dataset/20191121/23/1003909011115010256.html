      <h1>Roy Whitney returns as Tsuut'ina chief following election win</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T23:20:52+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 23:20</time> by <a rel="author">Sammy Hudes</a></address>
      <p>A longtime former chief of the Tsuut’ina Nation is returning to the job.</p>
      <p>Roy Whitney defeated incumbent candidate Lee Crowchild in Wednesday’s election after receiving a majority of votes, a spokesperson for Tsuut’ina Nation confirmed.</p>
      <p>Whitney originally served as chief for 17 years, from 1984 to 2001.</p>
      <p>In 2012, he defeated five-term chief Sandford Big Plume and served again until he was <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/longtime-tsuutina-first-nation-chief-loses-re-election-bid">defeated by Crowchild</a> in the 2016 election.</p>
      <p>“I am humbled at the renewed mandate given to me by the people of the Tsuut’ina Nation. I commit to them that I will work tirelessly, with respect and transparency, to further their interests, to respect the social and natural environment, and promote our language, history and culture,” Whitney said in a statement Thursday.</p>
      <p>“I want to formally and sincerely thank Lee Crowchild for his dedicated work for Tsuut’ina. In the days ahead I intend to quickly meet with the new council to set our priorities and a work plan to see progress on the many initiatives that Tsuut’ina has underway, and to move the goalposts on new initiatives to better the lives of current and future Tsuut’ina people.”</p>
      <p>Whitney was at the helm in 2013 when the Tsuut’ina Nation <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/calgarys-southwest-ring-road-will-be-dubbed-tsuutina-trail">agreed to a deal</a> with the province for construction of the southwest ring road, which included $340 million in cash and a land swap to make way for the project.</p>
      <p>“Along with the benefits of rent and land development, the real motivation is to allow future generations of people to work and flourish here,” he <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/opinion/editorials/editorial-bold-steps-for-tsuu-tina">said at the time</a>.</p>
      <p>“We’ve always been a proud people, but pride won’t buy you a cup of coffee without a plan.”</p>
      <p>The ring road is scheduled to open in 2021.</p>
      <p>Crowchild, who served one term as chief, is the son and grandson of two former influential chiefs; Gordon Crowchild, who served from 1970 to 1976, and David Crowchild, whose name graces Calgary’s Crowchild Trail and who served seven years as chief following his 1946 election.</p>
      <p>The third-generation chief previously held roles on the Nation as director of public works, emergency management and infrastructure.</p>
