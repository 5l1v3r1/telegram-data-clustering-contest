        <b>Given the annual <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/30/hollyoaks-spoilers-scott-drinkwell-dies-amid-stunt-week-devastation-11013093/">disasters</a> — not to mention <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/04/hollyoaks-spoilers-new-pictures-reveal-the-moment-before-mercedes-mcqueen-is-shot-11037881/">the recent attempted murder</a> — which take place in <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tv-soaps/hollyoaks/">Hollyoaks</a>, we’re not sure why anyone would want to move into the village but nonetheless a brand new couple are on their way to Chester. Toby and Celeste Faroe (Bobby Gordon and Andrea Ali) arrive in the coming episodes, and they’re set to make quite the impression on several of the soap’s mainstays.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The sophisticated couple have done incredibly well for themselves, as Toby is a music producer, while Celeste runs her own modelling agency. They arrive in the village and waste little time in moving into the flat that Mitchell (Imran Adams) and Cleo (Nadine Mulkerrin) only recently took up residence in.</p>
      <p>Upon their arrival, they quickly make friends — many of whom are in awe of the pair’s sophistication and glamour. Next door neighbours Darren (Ashley Taylor Dawson) and Mandy (Sarah Jayne Dunn) get along with the newcomers very well, and Jesse (Luke Jerdy) is delighted when Toby offers to promote his salon.</p>

      <p>However, their true motives will soon come to light, as the pair demonstrate a rather manipulative side, and they begin to play mind games with many of their new friends.</p>

      <p>On joining Hollyoaks, actor Bobby Gordon said: ‘My whole life I’ve been waiting for my opportunity to be on screen and I thought it was never going to happen. After having a year of ups and downs, I was given the chance and I couldn’t be more proud and excited to join the Hollyoaks team.’</p>
