      <p>Westpac's board of directors is meeting on Friday morning to "get the facts straight" following an explosive statement of claim by the financial intelligence agency that has cast doubt over the future of chief executive Brian Hartzer.</p>
      <p>Company sources told <i>The Sydney Morning Herald</i> and <i>The Age</i> there has not been an official agenda for Friday's meeting distributed, but said "anything and everything" was on the table as the bank works through its response to the unfolding crisis.</p>

      <p>AUSTRAC accused Westpac in the Federal Court this week of breaching Australia’s anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing laws 23 million times, including failing to properly vet thousands of transactions that could be linked to child exploitation and live child sex shows in the Philippines and other parts of south-east Asia.</p>
      <p>There is a sentiment within Westpac that the bank has been unfairly treated by AUSTRAC, with senior figures privately claiming the company had worked collaboratively with the regulator over the past two years.</p>
      <p>The regulator said this week there had been “systemic failures in its control environment, indifference by senior management and inadequate oversight by the board”.</p>
      <p>Speaking on Wednesday, Mr Hatzer admitted he was "utterly horrified" by the claims but also pushed back against the accusation of indifference. "I do take issue with the claims that senior executives and the board have been indifferent. We have not been indifferent.”</p>
      <p>Researcher at shareholder advisory service ISS Vas Kolesnikoff said on ABC radio Friday morning the board was put in place to monitor management.</p>
      <p>"We've got 23 million breaches of basic compliances, you'd like to say what was management doing? If management wasn't doing enough, we have a board here and we need to know what were they doing?"</p>
      <p>The purpose of Friday's meeting is to get "the facts" about who knew what and discuss the consequences moving forward, a source said.</p>
