      <p>Nov. 21 (UPI) -- Myanmar politician <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Aung_San_Suu_Kyi/?tps=1">Aung San Suu Kyi</a> will lead a delegation to the United Nations' top court to defend the country from accusations of genocide against the ethnic Rohingya, the president's office announced Thursday.</p>
      <p>Suu Kyi, the country's state counselor, will defend Myanmar before the International Court of Justice in a criminal case submitted by Gambia.</p>
      <p>"The state counselor, in her capacity as union minister for foreign affairs, will lead a team to The Hague, Netherlands, to defend the national interest of Myanmar at the ICJ,"<a href="https://www.facebook.com/myanmarpresidentoffice.gov.mm/photos/pcb.2499994533381601/2501399709907750/?type=3&amp;theater"> the post read</a>.</p>
      <p>Gambia <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/20/aung-san-suu-kyi-to-defend-myanmar-against-genocide-charge-at-the-hague">submitted a 46-page application</a> to the ICJ earlier this month, saying government actions in Myanmar have led to mass murder, rape and the destruction of Rakine state communities.</p>
      <p>Public hearings are scheduled from Dec. 10-12.</p>
      <p>Gambian Attorney General and Justice Minister Abubacarr Tambadou took on the case<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/why-a-tiny-african-country-is-taking-the-rohingyas-case-to-the-world-court/2019/11/12/f491d5a4-04cd-11ea-9118-25d6bd37dfb1_story.html"> after reading in a U.N. report</a> last year that security forces in Buddhist-majority Myanmar cracked down on the Rohingya, a Muslim ethnic minority, in 2017, killing thousands and leading to more than 700,000 fleeing to neighboring Bangladesh.</p>
      <p>Tambadou told The Washington Post that "it brought back memories of the Rwandan genocide."</p>
      <p>U.N. investigators<a href="https://www.upi.com/UN-report-calls-for-Myanmar-military-leaders-to-face-genocide-charges/7301535364181/"> said last year</a> that top generals in Myanmar should be investigated and prosecuted for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.</p>
      <p>The Myanmar government has repeatedly referred to the crackdown on Rohingya as necessary<a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/11/suu-kyi-defend-myanmar-genocide-accusation-court-191120161555257.html"> to stop "terrorism,"</a> and says that it can use its own committees to investigate abuse allegations.</p>
      <p>Sui Kyi won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 for campaigning for democracy and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/30/aung-san-suu-kyi-wont-be-stripped-of-nobel-peace-prize-despite-rohingya-crisis">has been criticized</a> for failing to condemn the army crackdown.</p>
      <p>The United Nations Human Right Council's independent international fact-finding mission found last year that Myanmar security forces "targeted and terrorized the entire Rohingya population," with "genocidal intent."</p>
      <p>The report, based on 875 interviews, <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/FFM-Myanmar/A_HRC_39_64.pdf">said</a> "nearly 725,000 Rohingya had fled to Bangladesh" by mid-August of 2018.</p>
      <p>An estimated 10,000 people died, some in arson attacks, and others by gunshot or "large bladed weapons," and some women and girls were gang raped before being killed, the report said.</p>
      <p>The mission found that the military operations were a "disproportionate" response to a small number of Rohingya insurgents attacking police outposts a year earlier, some with improvised explosive devices, killing 12 security officers.</p>
      <p>The country's government rejected the report with government spokesman Zaw Htay saying it was "false allegations by the U.N. agencies and other international agencies."</p>
      <p>The Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/resource-library#coreICCtexts">set up in 2002</a> to handle genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity, and as of 2010, also crimes of aggression, <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=pr1465">called for an investigation</a> in July into "alleged crimes against humanity" committed against the Rohingya in Myanmar.</p>
      <p>The request focused on the "2017 wave of violence," including "deportation," "other inhumane acts" and "persecution."</p>
      <p>The International Criminal Court's pre-trial chamber <a href="https://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2019/11/14/International-Criminal-Court-OKs-probe-into-Rohingya-abuses/2791573755357/">authorized a probe</a> into the allegations last week.</p>
      <p>"There exists a reasonable basis to believe widespread and/or systematic acts of violence may have been committed that could qualify as crimes against humanity of deportation across the Myanmar-Bangladesh border and persecution on grounds of ethnicity and/or religion against the Rohingya population," <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=pr1495">the chamber said</a>.</p>
      <p>The United States<a href="https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2019/07/17/US-sanctions-top-Myanmar-military-leaders-over-gross-human-rights-violations/2231563337344/"> announced sanctions</a> in July against four senior Myanmar military officials for "gross human rights violations" against Rohingya people.</p>
