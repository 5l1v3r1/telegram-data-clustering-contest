      <p>Nodding to Los Angeles, New York and Chicago, <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/nike">Nike</a> has crafted an <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/nike-air-force-1">Air Force 1</a> collection dubbed AF1 — ALL FOR ONE — made up of three designs that tell each city’s story in a bold fashion. From the warm sunshine of Los Angeles to the grit of NYC and the chilly winds of Chicago, each city has contributed immeasurably to street culture. Their respective Air Force 1s offer an insider’s perspective of sorts, as they were each crafted in tandem with local artists, government departments and community leaders.</p>
      <p>First, Los Angeles presents an <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/nike-air-force-1-high">Air Force 1 High</a> crafted by local artist <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/lauren-halsey">Lauren Halsey</a>. Its stark black base serves as a canvas for accents inspired by Los Angeles’s vibrant communities — namely the South Central neighborhood that Halsey grew up in. Prints on the sockliner and tongue tag nod to local storefronts and signs, while the lace deubre is a tact acknowledgement of Halsey’s Hieroglyph Crenshaw Project, a series of public murals that encourage communities to share their stories.</p>

      <p>Next to bat is New York. Its stark black <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/nike-air-force-1-low">Air Force 1 Low</a> with colorful accents is a collaboration with the city’s Parks Department, a municipal organization that’s responsible for overseeing the 1,900 parks spread across the five boroughs. From basketball courts to skateparks and lush green fields for relaxing, the parks play a huge part in city life. Therefore, the Parks Department’s signature leaf logo is presented boldly on the tongue, which also features interchangeable patches. The upper is constructed of leather and mesh panels inspired by chain-link fences, hi-vis reflective trim provides pops of flair, and the multicolor outsole is constructed of recycled Nike Grind material. It’s also accompanied by a 12-piece apparel collection.</p>
      <p>Last but not least, Chicago is repped by an Air Force 1 Low. Calling upon No Cuts No Glory, a popular local barbershop owned by master barber Drew Henderson, the shoe salutes the communal atmosphere present in Henderson’s business and others like it around the Windy City. Unique tweaks include a special tongue tag that juxtaposes Chicago’s recognizable skyline into a barber’s comb, a pony-hair tab for a quite literal nod to haircuts, an icy sole with a black and white diamond pattern for a nod to traditional barbershop floors, and an insole graphic with two clasped hands for unity. It’s functional too, thanks to rolled midsole edges for easy clean-up and waxed laces.</p>
      <p>The NYC pair is slated for a December 5 release, with LA and Chicago set to follow on December 7. All three styles will release on <a href="https://www.nike.com/launch/">Nike SNKRS</a> and at select boutiques in their respective cities.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/nike-basketball">Nike Basketball</a> has <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/11/nike-nba-2019-2020-city-edition-jerseys-uniforms-toronto-raptors-lakers-golden-state-warriors">officially revealed the 2019-20 NBA City Edition jerseys</a>.</p>
