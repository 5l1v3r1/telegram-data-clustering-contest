      <h1>RuPaul's Drag Race star Michelle Visage insists 'feud' with Cheryl was 'banter'</h1>

        <b>RuPaul’s Drag Race star <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/michelle-visage/">Michelle Visage</a> has shut down speculations that her and Cheryl ‘hate’ each other.</b>
      </p>
      <p>No judge is as honest as Michelle, but when Cheryl was invited as a guest, all we could see was smoke coming out of her ears.</p>
      <p>However the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/strictly-come-dancing/">Strictly Come Dancing</a> contestant set the record straight, revealing that they were just ‘giving them some telly’.</p>
      <p>The 51-year-old spilled: ‘I love Cheryl. It’s called – I know this is going to be really far fetched – banter.</p>
      <p>‘We’re doing a TV show about drag queens, so we got to give them some telly. Cheryl and I’ve known each other for years, we love each other.</p>
      <p>‘She gave it back and when you give it back, you’re gonna get it.’</p>
      <p>Well, there you have it, folks. They weren’t going head-to-head on the judges’ panel and they actually really love each other.</p>

      <p>Maybe they should try acting instead because they certainly fooled us.</p>

      <p>The pair had a <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/07/rupauls-drag-race-cheryl-michelle-visage-go-head-head-judges-panel-viewers-living-11063729/">disagreement on the panel over Baga Chipz’s efforts in the main challenge</a> from episode six, where the queens were asked to brand their own water bottle and make an ad for it.</p>
      <p>Sticking with the ol’ ‘down the chippy’ thought process, Baga opted for a ‘Chippy Tea Water’, which was meant to taste and fill you up like a fish and chip supper would’ve done.</p>
      <p>After watching the ad, which saw Baga sprawled across two underwear-clad models on a park bench while shoving battered sausages in her mouth (we’ve all been there), Michelle admitted that she didn’t particularly buy what Baga was selling.</p>

      <p>‘Really not sure about the water concept and what you were selling, I think we had more fun watching you put stuff in your mouth!’ Michelle said.</p>
      <p>When Baga tried to explain her concept, she added: ‘Hear from the other judges, maybe it’s just me.’</p>
      <p>Cheryl then spoke up in defence of fellow northerner Baga and said: ‘I think it’s just you.’</p>

      <p>Yikes, we all collectively cringed at that moment while Michelle shot daggers at the former Girls Aloud member.</p>
