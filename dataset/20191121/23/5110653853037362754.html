      <h1>Fantasy Injury Updates: Is Will Fuller V playing Thursday night? (Updated)</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T23:55:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 23:55</time> by <a rel="author">Billy Heyen</a></address>
      <p>Will Fuller V has a chance to make his return for the Texans on Thursday Night Football against the Colts. Fuller has been out since Week 7 due to a hamstring injury, and he's officially llisted as questionable on Wednesday's injury report. Fuller's return would provide a small boost to Deshaun Watson coming off a rough loss while also knocking Kenny Stills most of the way out of fantasy football relevance. The official active/inactive report will come out at about 6:50 p.m. ET. We'll have updates here and on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/sn_fantasy">@SN_Fantasy</a> through that time.</p>

      <p>Bill O'Brien <a href="https://twitter.com/AaronWilson_NFL/status/1196882527648178177">said Tuesday</a>that Fuller remains a game-time decision for Thursday night and that there's a "chance" he suits up.

      </p>
      <p>With Fuller out, Kenny Stills has stepped into the No. 2 WR role in Houston's offense, one that provides him with five-plus targets a game and the potential for a big play here and there. Fuller's return (assuming he could play a full allotment of snaps) would spell the end of that role for Stills, knocking him down a notch on the depth chart.</p>
      <p>If Fuller is active and appears likely to get his usual workload, he slides right back in to a boom-or-bust fantasy WR3 role. If Fuller is out, Stills remains viable as a boom-or-bust FLEX role for fantasy owners. Indianapolis is in the middle of the pack when it comes to fantasy points allowed to wide receivers.</p>

      </p>
      <p>If you had been relying on playing Fuller this week and it turns out he's out, you could pivot to Stills. If you'd prefer someone else, you may be able to pick up Cole Beasley, Demaryius Thomas, Taylor Gabriel, James Washington or Hunter Renfrow. Either way, both Fuller and Stills are risky plays in all formats.</p>
