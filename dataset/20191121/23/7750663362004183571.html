      <h1>Leicester City eye January move for Germany centre-back Robin Koch?</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/leicester-city/"><b>Leicester City</b></a> are reportedly eyeing up a January move for Germany and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/freiburg/"><b>Freiburg</b></a> centre-back <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/robin-koch/"><b>Robin Koch</b></a>.</h2>

      <p>The 23-year-old has been one of the German club's most impressive performers this season and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/brendan-rodgers/"><b>Brendan Rodgers</b></a> is thought to view him as a long-term successor to <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/harry-maguire/"><b>Harry Maguire</b></a> with the Foxes.</p>
      <p>According to <i>The Sun</i>, the former Celtic boss sent scouts to watch Koch in action for Germany during the recent international break ahead of a potential Â£15m move in the new year.</p>
      <p>Koch has scored four goals in 66 appearances for Freiburg since moving from Kaiserslautern in August 2017.</p>
      <p>Leicester will face competition for his signature, however, as fellow Premier League sides Wolverhampton Wanderers and Norwich City are also thought to be interested in his services.</p>
