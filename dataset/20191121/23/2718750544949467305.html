      <h1>Imelda Staunton Is Reportedly Next in the Line of Succession to Play the Queen in <i>The Crown</i></h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T23:24:34+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 23:24</time> by <a rel="author">Jordan Crucchiola</a></address>
      <p>Netflix might already have plans in place for the post–Olivia Colman era of <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/the-crown-season-3-harold-wilson-secretary.html"><i>The Crown</i></a>. The streaming studio has not yet commented on the news, but a <i>Daily Mail </i>report <a href="https://twitter.com/BazBam/status/1197642047194304519">tweeted out </a>today that Imelda Staunton is slated to take over as Queen Elizabeth II for seasons five and six of the series. Staunton was most recently in the <i>Downton Abbey </i>movie and lent her voice to what Hugh Grant considers the best film of his career, <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/08/hugh-grant-paddington-2-vanity-fair-interview.html"><i>Paddington 2</i></a>. (She was also part of the first <i>Paddington</i>, putting her in a truly elite class of actors.) <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/the-crown-royal-protocol-advisor-david-rankin-hunt-behind-the-scenes.html"><i>The Crown</i></a><i> </i>is currently <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/the-crown-season-3-cast-actors.html">in its third season</a>, so if Staunton is really the heiress to the throne, we won’t be seeing her in the role until 2021.</p>
      <p><b>Update: </b><a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/netflix-addresses-reports-imelda-staunton-cast-the-crown-1202792657/"><i>Deadline</i></a><i> </i>reports that Netflix is not yet confirming or denying the status of Staunton’s casting. “We are currently filming season 4 of <i>The Crown </i>but have not commissioned any further seasons as yet, therefore any news on casting remains pure speculation,” the studio said via a spokesperson.</p>
