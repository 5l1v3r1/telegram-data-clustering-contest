      <p>PEKANBARU, Nov 22 — A Sumatran elephant was found decapitated with its tusks ripped off in an apparent poaching of the critically endangered subspecies, an Indonesian conservation official said.</p>
      <p>The rotting corpse of the 40-year-old male creature was discovered by a plantation worker on Monday in Riau province on Sumatra island.</p>
      <p>“The elephant’s head had been cut off and its severed trunk was found a metre away from the body,” chief of the local conservation agency Suharyono, who goes by one name, said in a statement on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Authorities said the mutilated elephant had likely been dead for almost a week, adding that they were looking for those responsible.</p>
      <p>“We suspect the elephant was hunted and killed and then its head was cut off to remove the tusks,” Suharyono said.</p>
      <p>Rampant deforestation has reduced the species’ natural habitat and brought them into increasing conflict with humans, while their tusks are prized in the illegal wildlife trade. </p>
      <p>Last year, the corpse of an elephant was found with its tusks missing in Aceh province in an apparent poisoning case.</p>
      <p>Indonesia’s environment ministry estimates there are fewer than 2,000 Sumatran elephants still in the wild. — AFP</p>
