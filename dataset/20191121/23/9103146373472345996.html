      <p> <br/>Formed in 1989, ADF carried out its first attacks in 1995. The conflict gradually intensified, culminating into the 1998 Kichwamba Technical College attack, which left 80 people dead, with 80 more being abducted.</p>
      <p>By 2002, continuous pressure from the Ugandan Army forced ADF to relocate most of its activities into the DR Congo. The insurgency continued on a smaller scale until 2013, which marked a resurgence of ADF activity, with the group launching a recruitment campaign along with numerous attacks.</p>
