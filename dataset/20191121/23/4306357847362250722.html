      <h3>Cesar Azpiliceuta has wished Jose Mourinho all the best following his appointment as Tottenham Hotspur’s new manager.</h3>
      <p>The Portuguese coach was officially unveiled as the north London club’s new manager on Wednesday after Spurs opted to sack Mauricio Pochettino on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>Pochettino leaves Tottenham languishing in 14th place in the Premier League table after a difficult start to the new season in which they have only won three of their 12 games.</p>
      <p>Mourinho takes over at the north London club after having been out of work since being sacked by Manchester United almost a year ago.</p>
      <p>The Portuguese coach’s first game in charge at Tottenham will be Saturday lunchtime’s trip to West Ham United in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>Chelsea FC defender Azpilicueta was asked for his reaction to Spurs appointing Mourinho as their new manager, and he offered the following response.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <i>Sky Sports</i>, as quoted by <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/chelsea-captain-cesar-azpilicueta-sends-best-wishes-new-tottenham-manager-jose-mourinho-11191861/">Metro</a>, Azpilicueta said: “I can talk only about when Jose was here at Chelsea with us.</p>
      <p>“We won trophies and now football moves on, every time it’s different.</p>
      <p>“I can wish him all the best even if he goes to our rival. We have good memories with him and I played many times against him.</p>
      <p>“Obviously when we play against each other we both want to win for our teams but this is football.”</p>
      <p>Chelsea FC are currently in third place in the Premier League table as they prepare for their trip to Manchester City in the Premier League on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>The Blues are aiming to maintain their spot in the top four under Frank Lampard this season.</p>
