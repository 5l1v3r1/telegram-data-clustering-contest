        <b>Daniel Stendel, one of the favourites to fill the managerial vacancy at Hearts, has been given a positive reference from a player on the other side of the capital divide.</b>
      </p>
      <p>But Stevie Mallan, who knows the German coach from his spell at Barnsley prior to joining Hibs, has warned that his city rivals can expect a hard shift under the former Bundesliga boss.</p>
      <p>Stendel, who guided Barnsley to promotion from League One last season but was sacked by the club last month after a poor start to life back in the second tier, remains a hugely popular figure with the fans of the Championship outfit and, according to former Tykes midfielder Mallan, was also highly-regarded by the players who bought into his style of play.</p>
      <p>“He was rated highly down there. I think a lot of the fans bought into the style of play brought in by Stendel,” said Mallan. “And I know from speaking to a few of the boys there they rated him really highly as well and a lot were gutted when he got the sack.</p>
      <p>“I only worked with him for a couple of weeks – but even then it was evident it was just all about pressing and high-intensity running off the ball.</p>
      <p>“We were always in groups of twos and threes pressing the ball and I watched a bit of Barnsley last season because I still have friends there and that was evident in their play.</p>
      <p>“They won promotion and it was just all high pressing, high running. That’s obviously going to help Hearts.”</p>
      <p>The Gorgie club are continuing to work their way through a rigorous interview process in a bid to identify a replacement for Craig Levein, who was sacked at the end of last month.</p>
