      <p>WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — The Pacific people of Bougainville will on Saturday begin voting in a historic referendum to decide if they want to become the world’s newest nation by gaining independence from Papua New Guinea.</p>
      <p>The referendum will run over two weeks and is a key part of a 2001 peace agreement that ended a brutal civil war in the cluster of islands that killed at least 15,000 people.</p>
      <p>But the vote will not be the final word for the 250,000 people of Bougainville. The referendum is nonbinding and a vote favoring independence will need to be negotiated by leaders from Bougainville and Papua New Guinea.</p>
      <p>The U.N. representative in Papua New Guinea, Gianluca Rampolla, says the world body has been working hard to ensure the vote is peaceful, transparent, inclusive and credible.</p>
