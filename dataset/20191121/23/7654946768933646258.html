      <h1>Graham requests Biden-Ukraine docs from State Department</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T23:21:11+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 23:21</time> by <a rel="author">Bob Fredericks</a></address>
      <p>Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Lindsey Graham wants the State Department to produce any documents it has <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/10/giuliani-claims-ukrainian-company-paid-joe-biden-900000-in-lobbying-fees/">regarding Joe Biden and his son Hunter</a> and the Bidens and their dealings in Ukraine.</p>
      <p>Graham <a href="https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/LG%20to%20MP%20re%20Biden%20and%20Ukraine.pdf">in a letter</a> to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo requested the documents “to assist in answering questions regarding allegations that [then]Vice President [Joe] Biden played a role in the termination of Prosecutor General [Viktor] Shokin in an effort to end the investigation of the company employing his son,” according to The Hill, which <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/471571-graham-requests-state-department-documents-on-bidens-ukraine">first reported</a> the request.</p>
      <p>Graham wants State to fork over any documents tied to calls between the former veep and former Ukraine President Petro Poroshenko, including whether Biden brought up an investigation into Burisma, the energy giant where Hunter Biden was on the board, earning up to $50,000 a month despite a lack of experience.</p>
      <p>The South Carolina Republican — a Trump loyalist — also wants documents about a meeting between Devon Archer, Hunter Biden’s business partner, and then-Secretary of State John Kerry.</p>
      <p>Graham’s request came as he, Trump and other GOP lawmakers have accused the Bidens of corruption as the House conducts an impeachment inquiry into Trump.</p>
      <p>Biden pushed for Ukraine to fire Shokin as part of US policy because he was not doing enough to fight corruption in the former Soviet republic.</p>
      <p>At the time he was fired, the investigation into Burisma was dormant, and there is no known evidence that either Biden did anything wrong.</p>
      <p>Biden in 2016 had threatened to withhold US aid if Shokin wasn’t fired, which he eventually was.</p>
