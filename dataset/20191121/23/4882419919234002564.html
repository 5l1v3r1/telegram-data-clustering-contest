      <h2>President of the island club Miguel Ángel Ramírez, confirmed it</h2>

      <p>UD Las Palmas are looking for a player to replace Jonathan Viera in January 2020 but will not move for Barcelona B’s Riqui Puig, the president Miguel Angel Ramirez said in a press conference.</p>
      <p>Viera, loaned to the islanders by Beijing Guoan until December 31, will return to China most likely and the club will have a hole to fill. However they want a player with more status than Riqui.</p>
      <p>“We will have him until December 31 and after that we’ll see what happens, I can’t go telling you the strategies of the club,&amp;rdquor; said the chief.</p>
      <p>“The player has helped us get wins but with him we are 15th in the table. If he goes we will bring in another footballer and we’re working on that.&amp;rdquor;</p>
      <p>However he said it will not be the Barcelona man.</p>
