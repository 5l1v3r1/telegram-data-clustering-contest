      <p>Some things are still up in the air with only days to go until the event.</p>
      <p>There are only a few days to go until <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/wwe/">WWE</a> presents its annual <i>Survivor Series</i> pay-per-view, but not everything is set in stone yet. Some matches are for titles and others have champions facing champions from the different brands. As for the traditional elimination-style tag team matches, not everything has been announced at this point and rumor has it that one big decision is still up in the air.</p>
      <p>Fans love the big title matches and <i>NXT</i> vs. <i>Monday Night Raw</i> vs. <i>Friday Night SmackDown</i> champions, but the old school way is loved by all. There will be two elimination-style tag matches this year with three teams of women squaring off and three teams of male superstars.</p>
      <p>Both <i>Raw</i> and <i>SmackDown</i> have announced their teams, but <i>NXT</i> still has yet to name a single team member from their brand. Everyone expected them to be named on Wednesday night’s go-home episode, but nothing was said whatsoever.</p>
      <p>While WWE may simply be waiting to make the teams a total surprise to the fans and everyone else, not all is set in stone just yet. According to <a href="https://www.ringsidenews.com/2019/11/21/wwe-reportedly-still-figuring-out-big-survivor-series-decision/"><i>Ringside News</i></a>, there is one big decision which has yet to be made and it has to do with a final member of the <i>NXT</i> men’s team.</p>

      <p>Brad Shepard of the <a href="https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/oh-you-didnt-know-wrestling-show-2/oh-you-didnt-know-wrestling-show"><i>Oh, You Didn’t Know</i></a> podcast stated that as of Wednesday night, four of the five members had been decided from the yellow brand. WWE appears to be totally undecided on who will get the final spot on the men’s team, but they are running out of time to figure out who that will be.</p>
      <p>Loading...</p>
      <p>With all of the hype going around with <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/5750673/triple-h-return-survivor-series/">Triple H</a> leading the NXT charge, there were rumors that he would be on the team. Trips has since come forward during the <i>Survivor Series</i> press this week and said that he does not want to work the match on Sunday night.</p>
      <p>It’s kind of difficult to figure out who will be on the team at all as many are already in other matches. Each member of The Undisputed Era will be in other matches on the card so they are definitely out of the running to be part of NXT’s team.</p>
      <p>As far as who will be on either of the men’s and women’s five-person teams from <i>NXT</i> for <i>Survivor Series</i>, that is being kept a well-guarded secret. As far as things go backstage, it appears as if there is one member who is not even in place to be kept close to the vest just yet.</p>
