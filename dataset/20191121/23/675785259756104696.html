      <h1>Voice of the Mirror: Labour's manifesto offers bold plan to transform Britain</h1>
      <h2>Labour is determined to help those on low incomes unlike Boris Johnson and is prepared to stand up to hedge fund bosses, polluters and billionaires</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T23:03:29+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 23:03</time> by <a rel="author">Voice of the Mirror, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/voice-of-the-mirror/</a></address>
      <p>Desperate times call for bold measures and Labour’s manifesto is offering that.</p>
      <p>This is an agenda that responds to the challenges facing a country ravaged by austerity and hard-wired with inequality.</p>
      <p>Labour knows that rebuilding and transforming Britain into a fairer, more prosperous nation cannot be done through half measures.</p>
      <p>That is why they are prepared to stand up to hedge fund bosses, polluters and billionaires and stand with those who want a decent job, an affordable home and a clean environment.</p>
      <p>While Boris Johnson is taking millions of pounds from the tycoons in tax havens, Labour is determined to help those on low incomes.</p>
      <p>Nurses, teachers, council staff and police officers will get a much-deserved pay rise.</p>
      <p>This is a manifesto that seeks not just to repair the damage of Tory rule but lay the foundations for a better future.</p>
      <p>Nobody denies this will cost money but the burden will fall on the wealthy and big business. This a revolutionary new deal by a party which is ambitious for our country.</p>

      <h3>Still punished</h3>
      <p>The family of murder victim Helen McCourt have already suffered enough.</p>
      <p>They have undergone the agony of losing a loved one and they have endured the trauma of her killer, Ian Simms, refusing to say where her body is buried.</p>
      <p>Now they have suffered a third time after Simms was released from prison just a few months before a new law comes into force that bars murderers from being freed if they refuse to divulge the location of their victim’s remains.</p>
      <p>There is something wrong with our justice system when Helen’s family are still being punished but a killer can walk free in this way.</p>
