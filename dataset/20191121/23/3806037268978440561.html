      <h1>Tory Lanez Reconnects with Snoop Dogg for New "Beauty In The Benz" Visual</h1>
      <h2>“This video is a walking testimony on why we need to protect our BEAUTIFUL BLACK WOMEN.”</h2>

      <p>Towards the end of last week, <a href="http://hypebeast.com/tags/tory-lanez">Tory Lanez</a> introduced the fifth <i>Chixtape</i> project since beginning the series in 2011, <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/11/tory-lanez-chixtape-5-album-stream"><i>Chixtape 5</i></a>. The follow-up to this past April’s <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/4/tory-lanez-international-fargo-mixtape"><i>International Fargo</i></a> tape, the 2000s-inspired LP delivered 18 new tracks to listeners, including colorful skits and collaborations with Lil Wayne, The-Dream, Trey Songz, T-Pain, Ludacris, Lloyd, Trey Songz, Ashanti and others. Now, further supporting his latest full-length release, the 27-year-old superstar is reconnecting with <a href="http://hypebeast.com/tags/snoop-dogg">Snoop Dogg</a> for a music video in support of their <i>Chixtape 5</i> collaboration “Beauty In The Benz.”</p>
      <p>In an official statement, Lanez calls today’s clip a “a walking testimony on why we need to protect our beautiful black women.” He also enlists Alicia Keys for a special cameo appearance.</p>
      <p>“I think it’s just the evolution of where I’m at as far as R&amp;B [is concerned], and Tory breaking down the barrier of something new, but also something classic,” Tory Lanez recently shared with <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8543677/tory-lanez-chixtape-5-interview"><i>Billboard</i></a>, revealing what the fifth entry in his <i>Chixtape</i> series means to him. “I think it’s the evolution of where the <i>Chixtapes</i> went and what they are, but also, it kind of feels like every <i>Chixtape</i> in one, you know? You finally get every piece of production. You get every piece of extra vocals. You get everything. It’s damn near overwhelming at a certain point because it’s like, “Wow. Y’all did that.” I think five is moreso evolution, and a revolution towards what the <i>Chixtape</i> means to fans.”</p>
      <p>You can take a look at the new music video for Tory Lanez and Snoop Dogg’s <i>Chixtape 5</i> collaboration “Beauty in the Benz” above, and stay tuned for more visuals in support of the former artist’s latest project.</p>
