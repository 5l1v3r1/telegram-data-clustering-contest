      <p>The <i>Odole Oodua,</i> Sir Adebukunola Adebutu Kessington and stylish business woman, Hajia Bola Shagaya share some things in common. Apart from their filial relationship, they are both generous billionaires. Last month, when Hajia Bola celebrated her 60th birthday bash at the highbrow Eko Hotel and Suites, Victoria Island, Lagos, which attracted the high and mighty in Nigeria, many thought gaming mogul, Adebutu Kessington will not attend, because he was being conferred with a chieftancy title as the Asalu of Ode-Remo same day. To the amazement of many, the premier lotto boss graced the event in the company of his family members.</p>
      <p>Many wondered why ‘Baba Ijebu’ as he is fondly called, will exit his title conferment grand reception in Ode-Remo, Ogun state to attend Hajia’s birthday bash in Lagos. A source averred that, Sir Adebukola does not toy with anything that concerns the shrewd businesswoman, “The bond between Baba Ijebu and Hajia is not what anybody can come between. Baba cherish and adore her so much. For Baba, anything pertaining to Hajia must be treated with urgency”.</p>

      <p>Another close source to Baba Ijebu divulged to Society Rendezvous that; “Their filial relationship was further cemented years back, when Baba went on an official visit to former President Goodluck Jonathan at the Aso-Villa. When he sauntered into the villa, he saw Hajia sitted in company of former first lady, Patience Jonathan and some aides discussing. When Hajia sighted Baba Ijebu, like a cultured Yoruba woman, she immediately went on her knees before him, not minding her status and the reactions of people around. Baba was shocked as he quickly pulled her up and greeted her in return. He was amazed and thankful for that gesture. Those present at the scene concluded that for Hajia Bola to have accorded him that must respect, he must be a special and well respected person. She introduced Baba Ijebu to the First Lady and ensured he had a smooth visit at the Villa. From that moment, Baba vowed to pay Hajia Shagaya back in good measure”.</p>
