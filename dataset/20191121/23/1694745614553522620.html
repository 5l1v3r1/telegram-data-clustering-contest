      <h1>These Videos Let You Walk, Hike, or Bike Through Scenic Routes Without Leaving the Gym</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T23:15:03+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 23:15</time> by <a rel="author">Samantha Brodsky</a></address>
      <p>Running outside just isn't for me. Sure, I'll take part in my family's annual <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/5k-running-playlist-46864782">Turkey Trot 5K</a> and, on rare occasion, pound the pavement around my neighborhood — weather permitting — but the treadmill is more my style even if I have to find ways to keep it interesting. (Netflix, anyone?)</p>
      <p>One of the great things I loved about the Peloton Tread <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/Peloton-Treadmill-Review-46295592">when I was given the opportunity to test it out</a> was the option to do "free runs" without following along to the live or on-demand workouts. Instead, you could choose a scenic route to put on the screen, and you'd stride in front of prerecorded footage through the streets of cities like NYC and Morzine, France. You were moving through the outdoors inside. (Picture videos from a GoPro.) But, if you don't have a Peloton Tread, there are other ways you can sweat it out worldwide from the comfort of your home or local gym.</p>
      <p>Ahead, check out virtual bike rides, hikes, and runs prerecorded and ready for you to stream while doing cardio. Some are as short as 30 minutes and others are over an hour in length (one is even two hours!), but don't feel like you need to bike, walk, or run for the entirety of the longer videos; they'll simply give you something nice to look at while you're on the move. Most of these also have music, so you don't have to worry about trying to listen to your favorite songs outside of the YouTube app (typically, you're unable to play both Spotify and a YouTube video at the same time).</p>
      <p>Pull the videos up on your phone or iPad (keep another device handy if you don't like the music and want to <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/motivational-workout-playlist-female-artists-46627681">listen to a different playlist simultaneously</a>). The bigger the screen, the more immersed you'll feel into the scenery and the easier it'll be to play pretend. Because, if you love being outside but can't always make it there, these are the next best thing.</p>
      <h3>30-Minute Run Through Cotswold, UK</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>You'll literally run (elliptical-glide, whatever you choose) through tree-lined roads, past outstretched fields, and into the sunset.</p>
      <h3>1-Hour Virtual Cycling</h3>

        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FvEdZ0VbQQw" width="728" height="409" data-service="Youtube" scrolling="no"/>
      </figure>
      <p>This one-hour cycling footage moves fast and features exciting music that'll hopefully get your blood pumping. It's unclear exactly where this was filmed, but the sun is shining and the open road is waiting for you.</p>
      <h3>30-Minute Cycling Through Italy</h3>
      <figure>
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/m8bJZ04S8fA" width="728" height="409" data-service="Youtube" scrolling="no"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Cycle around the streets near Lake Garda in Italy. You'll follow other bikers along the way, and the scenery will change from greenery to tunnels and back again.</p>
      <h3>2-Hour Grand Canyon National Park Walk, Jog, or Run</h3>
      <figure>
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qLaLmEW0hWg" width="728" height="409" data-service="Youtube" scrolling="no"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Never been to the Grand Canyon? No worries — this two-hour footage will take you there. Note: the pace slows in parts of the video (because you can't run over rocks!), but you could vary your speed regardless. The most important thing is that the views are gorgeous and you can enjoy them during your cardio session.</p>
      <h3>45-Minute Cycling Workout</h3>
      <figure>

      <p>This video has an added bonus of showing intensity intervals on the side of the screen as well as bikers to follow (plus, really good music). It may look less scenic than the others, but you're actually cycling through Melbourne, Australia's Beach Road.</p>
      <h3>85-Minute Bryce Canyon Virtual Hike</h3>
      <figure>
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yWbR6N5tYaQ" width="728" height="409" data-service="Youtube" scrolling="no"/>
      </figure>
      <p>This hike through Bryce Canyon is almost an hour and a half long! Sure, you can go on the treadmill and put your incline all the way up, but you could also take this with you on the elliptical. It's up to you!</p>
      <h3>75-Minute Bike Ride Through the Alps</h3>
      <figure>
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r7aO_Hkbmac" width="728" height="409" data-service="Youtube" scrolling="no"/>
      </figure>
      <p>The Italian Alps region never looked so good from the comfort of your gym or home. What are you waiting for? Go exploring!</p>
