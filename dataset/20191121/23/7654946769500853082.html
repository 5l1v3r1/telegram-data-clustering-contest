      <p>Christian McCaffrey’s season keeps getting better.</p>
      <p>The Panthers’ running back became the first player in NFL history to rack up 1,000 rushing yards and 500 receiving while picking up steam in the race for MVP this season.</p>
      <p>Oh, and on Thursday, the 23-year-old <a href="https://www.panthers.com/news/christian-mccaffrey-is-officially-a-member-of-madden-s-99-club">became the youngest player</a> to join the ’99 Club,’ a small fraternity of NFLers who have attained a 99 rating in EA Sports’ Madden video game series. McCaffrey was at 91 when the game launched.</p>
      <p>“This means a lot. It’s really cool. I played Madden my whole life,” McCaffrey said while admiring his commemorative “99” trophy. “Getting a 99, to be in that company means a lot. It’s definitely very humbling.”</p>
      <p>McCaffrey, the son of former NFL receiver Ed McCaffrey and <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/18/olivia-culpo-takes-christian-mccaffrey-flirting-inside-panthers-locker-room/">boyfriend of supermodel Olivia Culpo</a>, joins an even smaller crew of running backs to attain near-Madden perfection: Barry Sanders, Marshall Faulk, LaDainian Tomlinson, Chris Johnson and Adrian Peterson.</p>
      <p>The No. 8 pick in the 2017 NFL Draft, McCaffrey leads the NFL with 1,059 rushing yards and is tied for tops in the league with 11 touchdowns and 14 total trips to the end zone.</p>
