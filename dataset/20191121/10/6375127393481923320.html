      <h3>A HOUSE leader called for open bidding for the supply of pneumonia vaccine.</h3>
      <p>Speaking in a media forum, Quezon Rep. Angelina Tan, chairperson of the House Committee on Health, said bidding for pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) should be open to multiple bidders and not favor a single supplier.</p>
      <p>The purchase cost of pneumonia vaccine is P4.9 billion.</p>
      <p>“Specifications in biddings should not favor a single brand. I’m into open, competitive bidding because bids should not lean towards certain companies,” Tan said.</p>
      <p>Tan, a medical doctor by profession, was reacting to the recent move of the Department of Health (DOH) to suspend bidding for PCVs following public clamor to make the bidding open and competitive.</p>
      <p>The DOH move was lauded by doctors and vaccine experts who noted that the original call for bidding involved a single vaccine manufacturer.</p>
      <p>“Medicine and supplies that are needed by the government pass through the HTA (Health Technology Assessment), in which their cost-effectiveness is determined,” Tan added, noting that entertaining multiple bidders will allow the government to leverage on the vaccines’ cost-effectiveness.</p>
      <p>Tan filed House Bill 00172 which seeks to expand the coverage of the mandatory immunization program and providing a system in the determination of other types of vaccine-preventable diseases.</p>
      <p>HB 00172 amends Republic Act No. 10152, otherwise known as the “Mandatory Infants and Children Health Immunization Act of 2011.”</p>
      <p>Health Undersecretary Rolando Enrique Domingo, in turn, clarified that the DOH’s calls for bidding are, in fact, open.</p>
      <p>“However, for PCVs, the specifications were very specific to just one vaccine brand,” Usec. Domingo revealed. “</p>
