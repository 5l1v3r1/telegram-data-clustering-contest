      <p>The United States has reaffirmed its commitment to maintaining the current <a href="https://www.forces.net/news/south-korea-strike-deal-us-troops">level of US troops in South Korea</a>. </p>
      <p>US Defense Secretary Mark Esper has dismissed claims made by South Korean newspaper Chosun Ilbo that 4,000 American troops will be withdrawn from the country.</p>
      <p>"I have not heard that," Mr Esper told journalists, during a trip to Vietnam.</p>

      <p>It had been reported that the US was considering bringing a brigade home from the South should Seoul refuse to accept a five-fold increase, or around $5 billion per year, in the upkeep of the US Forces Korea. </p>
      <p>"I read articles in the media all the time that are false or inaccurate or overstated.</p>
      <blockquote>"We’re not threatening allies over this. This is a negotiation," he added. </blockquote>
      <p>Talks are underway to renew the Special Measures Agreement that stipulates the sharing of the cost for maintaining some 28,500 US troops. </p>
      <p>In a Twitter statement last week, Mr Esper described the alliance between the US and South Korea as "ironclad".</p>

      <p>South Korea remains technically in a state of war with nuclear-armed neighbour North Korea following their 1950-1953 conflict.</p>
      <p>US relations with North Korea are also strained, following a stand-off in denuclearisation talks and a <a href="https://www.forces.net/world/sometimes-you-have-walk-trump-kim-summit-ends-without-nuclear-deal">failed second summit in February</a>.</p>
      <p>The UK, France and Germany have all recently condemned a spate of missile test-launches from North Korea, <a href="https://www.forces.net/news/uk-france-and-germany-call-north-korea-sanctions">calling for sanctions on the country</a>.</p>
      <p>Mr Esper's visit to Vietnam comes as part of a series of trips to Asian nations, intended to maintain and improve international defence relations.</p>

      <p>The US Defense Secretary criticised what America believes to be Chinese intimidation strategies over territories in the South China Sea.</p>
      <p>Large-scale militarisation from China in the waters partly claimed by its Asian neighbours, including Vietnam, has led to regular US Navy operations close to Chinese-occupied islands.</p>
      <p>During Mr Esper's meeting with China, <a href="https://www.forces.net/news/china-tells-us-stop-flexing-muscles-south-china-sea">the US were urged to "stop flexing muscles" in the area</a>.</p>
