      <p>NEW DELHI: The Congress and the NCP on Thursday inched closer to form a government along with <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Shiv-Sena">Shiv Sena</a> in <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Maharashtra">Maharashtra</a> as they were thrashing out the nitty gritty of power sharing and finalising a common minimum programme to govern the politically-crucial state.</p>
      <p>In a meeting, the <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Congress-Working-Committee">Congress Working Committee</a>, the party's highest decision making body, after a detailed deliberation on the political situation in Maharashtra, gave its approval to join hands with the Sena in the state, party sources told PTI.</p>
      <p>After the meeting, which was chaired by party chief <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Sonia-Gandhi">Sonia Gandhi</a>, Congress sources said the finer details on the government formation in Maharashtra is expected by Friday.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, the Congress-NCP alliance gave its most categorical indication about joining hands with arch rival Shiv Sena, with former chief minister <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Prithviraj-Chavan">Prithviraj Chavan</a> expressing confidence of forming a "stable" government soon in the state after a marathon meeting of senior leaders of the two parties here.</p>
      <p>Several top leaders of the two parties again met at NCP chief Sharad Pawar's residence on Thursday afternoon to hammer out the common minimum programme of governance, sources said.</p>
      <p>Congress leaders <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Ahmed-Patel">Ahmed Patel</a>, Jairam Ramesh and Mallikarjun Kharge, and NCP leaders Praful Patel, Supriya Sule, Ajit Pawar, Jayant Patil and Nawab Malik were part of the meeting.</p>
      <p>Sources said the three parties are likely to make a formal announcement on Friday to join hands to take a shot at power in the state.</p>
      <p>The three parties are then likely to send separate letters to the Maharashtra governor mentioning their decision to come together to form a government, said a source.</p>
      <p>Earlier, senior Shiv Sena leader <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Sanjay-Raut">Sanjay Raut</a> exuded confidence that the two parties, along with the Congress, will arrive at a decision on government formation in a day or two.</p>
      <p>He also told reporters that there are no plans of any meeting between Sonia Gandhi and Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray this week.</p>
      <p>A senior NCP leader on Wednesday said that the government is likely to be formed before the first phase of the Jharkhand Assembly polls scheduled on November 30.</p>
      <p>The state was plunged into a political crisis after the Sena broke its three-decade-long ties with the BJP after its partner refused to accede to its demand of sharing the chief minister's post.</p>
      <p>The BJP and Sena, which fought the October 21 assembly polls in alliance, had secured a comfortable majority by winning 105 and 56 seats, respectively, in the 288-member assembly. The Congress and the NCP, pre-poll allies, won 44 and 54 seats, respectively.</p>
      <p>The Sena then began talks with the Congress-NCP alliance.</p>
