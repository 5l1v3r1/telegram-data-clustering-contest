      <h1>Early ‘gifts’ for Manila cops</h1>

      <h3>Christmas may come early to the policemen and non-uniformed personnel of the MPD as Mayor Isko Moreno signed the necessary  papers that would enable each MPD member to already get their financial assistance from the city government totalling P30,000 each, including the allowances they did not get during the time of the past Estrada administration.</h3>
      <p>Moreno said it is the city’s small way of acknowledging the efforts of the police in maintaining peace and order in Manila round-the-clock.</p>
      <p>Special Mayor’s Reaction Team (SMART) chief Maj. Jhun Ibay, who was present as Moreno signed the documents, said the MPD personnel will be very happy with the mayor’s move as he expressed thanks in behalf of the police force, of which he is also a member.</p>
      <p>Ibay said the amount covers the monthly allowance of the MPD policemen covering the period from January to December 2019 and also includes the non-uniformed personnel.</p>
      <p>It was learned that when Moreno assumed office on June 30, he asked Vice Mayor Honey Lacuna, in her capacity as the presiding officer of the Manila City Council, to find a way to include in the budget the allowances of the MPD police and its personnel which were not given from January to June during the time of the previous city administration.</p>
      <p>Moreno thus signed yesterday the release of  the total amount of P93,480,800  covering the allowance of 3,223 MPD personnel.</p>
