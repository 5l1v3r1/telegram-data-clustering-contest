      <p>Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Enitan Ogunwusi has called for unity among Nigerians regardless of tribes, ethnicity and religious backgrounds.</p>
      <p>He said such unity was capable of further enthrenching peaceful co-existence among the people of the country.</p>
      <p>Speaking during the World Eri Festival at Enugwu Aguleri, Anambra State, the monarch who was represented by the Asoya of Ile Isoya Ife Kingdom,<br/>Oba Murainu Adebanjo said he was happy to be part of the event, describing Ndigbo as great people.</p>
      <p>He said, “I’m interested in national unity because it will guarantee peace as well as bring the best of the people into a more prosperous country where the safely, security and people’s happiness are guaranteed.</p>
      <p>“A peaceful and prosperous country is all that we are praying for and we can only get it when we are strongly united as a people.”</p>
      <p>The monarch congratulated the Eze Eri and his subject for organizing the event, just as he praised the African Americans that came to identify with their progenitor.</p>
      <p>“My prayer is that the festival will continue to serve as a rallying point for integration of people across-board,” he added.</p>
      <p>Also speaking, President General of Ohaneze Ndigbo Chief Nnia Nwodo said the Eri Kingdom has made Ndigbo proud through the festival.</p>
      <p>Nwodo, represented by the President of Ohaneze in the State, Chief Damian Afam Ogene described Ooni’s visit as another version of handshake across the Niger from the cultural point of view.</p>
      <p>“The festival not only showcases the culture of Ndigbo to the rest of the world but also helps to connect them with others in a manner that enhances friendship between them and their counterparts,” he added.</p>
      <p>Nwodo who was honored with a Chieftaincy title of Okwulora (the voice) of Igboland by Eze Eri said the honor would inspire him to continue to serve his people.</p>

      <p>“Ohaneze is committed to promoting national unity and will always identify with activities aimed at entrancing national unity from all angles as cultural, religious or political,” he noted.</p>
      <p>Earlier, the host and celebrant of the festival, Eze Chukwuemeka Eri said the occasion was a time the Igbo race come together to remember their progenitor Eri said to have migrated from Israel and settled at Aguleri.</p>
      <p>He said, “Today we commemorate and celebrate an African and global historical figure Nna Anyi (our father) Eri” the Eze begins rhetorically.</p>
      <p>“I welcome my brother and friend from our brotherly land of Yoruba. I thank him for coming here to celebrate with us.</p>
      <p>“I use this opportunity to call for peace and unity among the Yoruba and the Igbo and the rest of Nigerians.”</p>
