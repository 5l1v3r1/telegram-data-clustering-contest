      <p>Britain’s public finances came under pressure last month as official figures showed the highest October borrowing for five years in a “sobering backdrop” to election pledges to ramp up spending.</p>
      <p>The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said public sector net borrowing, excluding state-owned banks, rose by £2.3 billion year-on-year to £11.2 billion last month.</p>
      <p>Borrowing in the first seven months of the financial year so far stands at £46.3 billion, £4.3 billion or 10% more year-on-year.</p>

      <p>The figures come as Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Conservative Party and opposition party Labour have both promised to increase public spending if they win the General Election on December 12.</p>
      <p>The Resolution Foundation think tank claimed the state of the public finances will hold back spending plans or tax cuts for whichever party emerges victorious.</p>
      <p>James Smith, research director at the Resolution Foundation, said: “The 2019 public finances deterioration provides a sobering backdrop to manifesto launches this week, alongside a wider weaker outlook for both domestic and global growth next year.</p>
      <p>“With all main parties committed to balancing the books on current spending, this deterioration should be a reminder to whoever wins the election that the state of the public finances will continue to be a constraint on plans for higher public service spending or tax cuts in the next parliament.”</p>

      <p>The Conservatives have committed to a borrowing limit of 3% of GDP, while Labour’s plans suggest the overall deficit would be likely to rise to about 4% of GDP towards the end of a five-year parliamentary term, according to experts.</p>
      <p>But Howard Archer, chief UK economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said the higher October borrowing “will not deter the next government from loosening fiscal purse strings”.</p>
      <p>Samuel Tombs, from Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the rise in October borrowing was softened by a £4 billion downward revision to the total for the first six months of 2019-20.</p>
      <p>He said full-year borrowing should now hit around £45.6 billion overall and 2% of GDP.</p>
      <p>“Looking ahead, scope remains for fiscal stimulus next year, regardless of which party wins the upcoming election,” he said.</p>
      <p>The ONS figures showed revenues from corporation tax dropped 6.2% or £300 million in October – the largest annual drop seen in October for four years.</p>
      <p>But value added tax (VAT) lifted £600 million and income-related tax rose £300 million as a rise in national insurance contributions offset a drop in income tax receipts.</p>
      <p>National debt now stands at 80.4% of gross domestic product (GDP), down from 81.5% a year earlier, according to the ONS.</p>
