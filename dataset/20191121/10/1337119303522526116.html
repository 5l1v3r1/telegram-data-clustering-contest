      <h1>Pokémon Sword and Shield is the fastest-selling Nintendo Switch game yet</h1>
      <h2>Six million copies sold in the first week</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T10:12:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 10:12</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/sam-byford" target="_blank">Sam Byford</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fbrowse%2Fvideo-games%2Fpokemon-sword-shield%2F2636_7899038_2127706_7762888&amp;subid1=theverge"><i>Pokémon Sword</i> and <i>Shield</i></a> are off to a great start, selling more than 6 million copies in the week since their release. That’s according to a <a href="https://twitter.com/Pokemon_cojp/status/1197447168304537600">tweet</a> from The Pokémon Company, which notes that the figures make the latest mainline <i>Pokémon</i> instalment the fastest-selling Nintendo Switch game of all time. (It’s worth caveating, of course, that <i>Sword</i> and <i>Shield</i> are technically separate releases, albeit ones that are almost identical in content.)</p>
      <p>New Pokémon games are invariably strong performers. The last all-new releases, <i>Sun</i> and <i>Moon</i> for 3DS, have sold 16.17 million copies to date according to Nintendo, and they were the company’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/30/13798688/pokemon-sun-moon-nintendo-3ds-sales-record">fastest-selling games ever in the West</a> upon release. It’s worth noting, though, that the 3DS had a larger install base at that point in time, and the games sold for a lower price point.</p>
      <p>Last year’s <i>Pokémon Let’s Go, Pikachu!</i> and <i>Let’s Go, Eevee! </i>for Switch, meanwhile, have reached 11.28 million copies in total, which <i>Sword</i> and <i>Shield</i> are on pace to beat based on first-week sales. The <i>Let’s Go</i> games were based on the original Game Boy <i>Pokémon</i> games, however, and don’t represent a brand-new generational release.</p>
      <p><i>Pokémon</i> has historically been a portable-focused franchise, and <i>Sword</i> and <i>Shield</i>’s release has dovetailed with the launch of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20873717/nintendo-switch-lite-review-price-specs-features-games-launch-date">new handheld-only Nintendo Switch Lite</a>, including its special edition <i>Pokémon</i> version. Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2019/191102e.pdf">noted</a> during the company’s most recent earnings briefing that the Switch Lite was released alongside <i>The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening</i>, another Game Boy remake that sold well to buyers of the new model.</p>

      <p>Dolby Atmos-ready sound systems can cost you a lot, but Vizio’s 5.1.2 system including a 36-inch soundbar, two satellite speakers, and a wireless sub, is the perfect starting point if you don’t want to spend a bunch of money.
