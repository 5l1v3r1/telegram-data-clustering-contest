      <p>Lenovo Yoga C940 comes in two sizes: 14 and 15 inches. Depending on the size you choose, you'll be able to kit it out with some powerful internal components, making it a great 2-in-1.</p>

      </p>
      <h4>Pros</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>10th Gen Intel CPUs available</li>
        <li>Beautiful 4K touch display option</li>
        <li>Soundbar hinge with full audio</li>

      <h4>Cons</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Heavier</li>
        <li>More pricey</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Surface Pro 7 is one of the more powerful Windows tablets, rocking the latest 10th Gen Intel CPUs. You can't choose a dedicated GPU and you must buy the keyboard cover separately, but it's a stunning form factor.</p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <h4>Pros</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>More affordable</li>
        <li>Great tablet form factor</li>
        <li>Works with Wi-Fi 6</li>
        <li>Up to 1TB storage</li>
        <li>Still a solid design</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Cons</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>No dedicated GPU</li>
        <li>Less capable configurations</li>
        <li>No included pen or keyboard</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Lenovo's Yoga C940 is a very capable 2-in-1, depending on which size you go for. The larger 15-inch model can be kitted out with a dedicated GPU from NVIDIA too, but you'll be paying a premium. If you're more into owning a powerful tablet, the Surface Pro 7 is a great option.</p>

      <h3>Design &amp; features</h3>

      <p>If you're familiar with the previous generations of the 2-in-1 Surface Pro line-up, then you'll notice not much has changed for the Surface Pro 7. You've still got the usual kickstand on the rear, a unibody aluminum design, as well as an IR camera with support for Windows Hello. It's so similar to older Surface Pro models that you can use previous generation Type Covers on this new device.</p>
      <p>Both the 14- and 15-inch Yoga C940 from Lenovo are fairly similar to one another, and, like the Surface Pro 7, rock a unibody aluminum design. Since these are more like laptops than tablets, you have a convertible hinge that allows you to rotate the display to enjoy tent, stand, and tablet modes. The hinge also houses a soundbar, which is a neat use of space. There's no IR camera on the Yoga C940, but you do get a fingerprint reader.</p>
      <p>The Yoga C940 wins in the ports department with the inclusion of two Thunderbolt 3, one USB-A 3.1, and a 3.5mm audio jack. That's not amazing, but does allow you to connect most of your hardware and accessories. The Surface Pro 7 doesn't have a particularly exciting port selection either with a single USB-C 3.1, one USB-A, 3.5mm audio jack, Surface Connect, and microSD card reader.</p>
      <h3>Display</h3>
      <p>The Surface Pro 7 doesn't have many options for the display, with just one coming in at 12.3 inches with a 2736x1824 resolution and 267 PPI, which is a boxy 3:2 aspect ratio that's ideal for a tablet. The 14-inch Lenovo Yoga C940 display comes in either FHD anti-glare with 400 nits brightness, FHD glossy with 400 nits brightness, FHD anti-glare with 500 nits brightness, or UHD 4K glossy with HDR400. For the best picture possible, you'll want to go with the 4K option, but keep in mind the price will rise and battery life will drop accordingly.</p>
      <p>If 14 inches isn't big enough, the 15.6-inch model comes in two flavors based on which resolution you need. Both the FHD and 4K versions offer VESA-certified HDR400 with Dolby Vision and up to 500 nits brightness. Both are glossy, so if you need anti-glare you'll likely want to go with the 14-inch model. In either case, you're getting a beautiful display, but the larger model will make substantial productivity just a bit easier thanks to the increased screen real estate.</p>
      <h3>Performance &amp; price</h3>
      <figure>

      <p>The Lenovo Yoga C940 can be kitted out with a dedicated NVIDIA GTX 1650 GPU and up to a 9th Gen Intel Core i9 processor (15-inch only), or newer 10th Gen without the dedicated GPU (14-inch only). You'd immediately assume the newer 10th Gen Intel CPUs in the Surface Pro 7 and 14-inch C940 would be faster, but they're not. You do get fancy new Intel Iris graphics processing, but the newer chip can't outmatch the i7/i9 with NVIDIA GTX 1650 in the 14-inch Yoga C940.</p>
      <p>This is all reflected in the price with the Yoga C940 costing considerably more than the Surface Pro 7, especially at the base model configuration. Microsoft does provide more options, including a budget-friendly Core i3 processor, but if you want all-out performance, you'll want to consider the 15-inch Lenovo Yoga C940 with the dedicated GPU and slightly older, but superior Intel Core i9 CPU.</p>
      <p>If you're on a tighter budget, the Surface Pro 7 makes more sense, starting at $749. The Intel Core i3 means Microsoft can keep the price low for the entry level mode, whereas even the most affordable Lenovo Yoga C940 costs considerably more than even a more kitted out Surface Pro 7 at $1,150.</p>
      <h3>The Yoga C940 is a more powerful 2-in-1</h3>
      <p>The Yoga C940 may cost considerably more, even for the base configuration, but the 15-inch version can be kitted out with a dedicated GPU and Intel Core i9, which is great for power users. The smaller 14-inch sports enhanced mobility and will still keep up with any task you throw its way, as long as you're not interested in intensive specialized work.</p>

      <p>The 10th Gen Intel Core "Ice Lake" CPUs available in the Pro 7 are capable processors, and Intel Iris Plus Graphics are no joke either. Add up to 1TB of storage space and enjoy Wi-Fi 6 wireless speeds in a compact tablet package that weighs very little. Just remember to save some additional budget for the optional Surface Pen and Touch Cover.</p>
