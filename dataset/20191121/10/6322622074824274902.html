      <p>(Nov 21): Southeast Asian stock markets took a beating on Thursday on worries that the US bills backing Hong Kong protesters could strain Sino-US relations and further delay a possible "phase one" trade deal.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, the US House of Representatives passed two bills backing pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong which President Donald Trump is expected to sign, a move that has irked China.</p>
      <p>Further weighing on sentiment was a report that the trade agreement could be delayed as Beijing presses for more extensive tariff rollbacks, and the Trump administration counters with heightened demands of its own.</p>
      <p>Indonesian shares shed 0.6%, as the central bank's move to cut the reserve requirement ratio by banks failed to lift sentiment, while the key interest rate was kept steady, as expected.</p>
      <p>"With inflation expected to remain within target going into 2020, Bank Indonesia may resume its easing cycle in early 2020 to give growth momentum an added boost, given the possibility of an escalation in global headwinds," analysts at ING said in a note.</p>
      <p>Trade-sensitive Singapore stocks closed at an over three-week low.</p>
      <p>While the index pared a small portion of losses on news that the city-state's economy grew better than the government expected in the third quarter, selling resumed later in the day, pushing the index 1.2% lower.</p>
      <p>Thai shares slid as data showed that exports had dropped for a third straight month in October, and had missed estimates predicted in a <i>Reuters </i>poll.</p>
      <p>Top losers were communication services stocks, with Advanced Info Service Pcl and Total Access Communication Pcl shedding 3.5% and 5%, respectively.</p>
      <p>Vietnamese equities tumbled 1.3%, dragged by real estate stocks.</p>
      <p>Philippines stocks had fallen as much as nearly 2% to a six-week low, but recouped some losses to close 1% lower.</p>
      <p>Malaysian stocks fell 0.6%, with index heavyweight Tenaga Nasional losing 1.3%.</p>
