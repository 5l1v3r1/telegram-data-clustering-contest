      <h1>The 10 items food bank charities are asking shoppers to donate this week at Tesco</h1>
      <h2>From today until Saturday November 23, shoppers will find a Food Collection donation point at the front of every Tesco store</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T10:29:25+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 10:29</time> by <a rel="author">Dave Masters, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/dave-masters/</a></address>
      <p>The Tesco Food Collection, the UK’s biggest charity food collection, is calling on pre-Christmas shoppers to donate long-life food to support the work of charity partners the Trussell Trust and FareShare.</p>
      <p>The vital collection runs from today until Saturday November 23 - and we can reveal a list of 10 items the charities have said would be really appreciated.</p>
      <p>Last year, thanks to the generosity of Tesco shoppers, the charities received more than 3.5 million meals worth of food during the collection.</p>
      <p>But this year they hope to exceed last year’s target. Once again, Tesco will be topping up the value of the customer donations by an additional 20 per cent to help the charities carry out this vital work.</p>

      <h3>This year's list of much-needed items is below...</h3>

      <p>Food donated in store to the local Trussell Trust food bank is taken directly there, where it is sorted and used to create emergency food parcels for people in crisis who are referred to the food bank by a variety of agencies. The Trussell Trust – which has 1,200 centres in its network – also campaigns for change to end the need for food banks in the UK.</p>
      <p>Donations to FareShare are delivered by Tesco to the charity’s network of regional centres. The long-life food is then used to supplement the deliveries of fresh surplus food that FareShare provides to thousands of charities and community groups, including homeless shelters, children’s breakfast clubs and domestic violence refuges, across the UK and Northern Ireland.</p>

      <p>Circumstances can change quickly and those who work in food banks and know that people turn to them for a variety of different reasons.</p>
      <p>“We have lots of different types of people that come to us,” said Julie Baker, project manager at Hinckley Area Foodbank in Leicestershire. “We have had a family with a two-day-old baby and a 96-year-old woman living in sheltered housing.”</p>
      <p>According to the Trussell Trust‘s research, the average weekly income of people at food banks is only £50 after paying rent, and almost one in five has no money coming in at all the month before being referred for emergency food. Almost three-quarters of people using food banks live in households affected by ill-health or disability.</p>

      <p>But, whatever the reasons for needing help, taking that first step through the door of a food bank is never easy for anyone.</p>
      <p>“It is difficult for people to come over the threshold and ask strangers for food,” said Julie, “We are someone’s last port of call.”</p>
      <p>The Hinckley food bank started in 2012 with four centres and now has eight across the area, providing 120 food parcels to people every week. However, like all the food banks in the network, its work is totally dependent on donations from the community.</p>
      <p>“People needing to use our food bank often tell me they can’t believe so many other people in their area have donated,” said Julie. “People come in anxious and upset and go away feeling relieved that a burden has been lifted from their shoulders for a few days. They know that people care.”</p>
