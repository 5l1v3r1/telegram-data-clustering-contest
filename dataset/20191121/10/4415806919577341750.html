      <p>Extinction Rebellion has distanced itself from its co-founder Roger Hallam after he made controversial remarks about the Holocaust.</p>
      <p>In an interview with German newspaper Die Zeit on Wednesday, Mr Hallam referred to the event, which claimed the lives of millions of Jewish people, as “just another f***ery in human history”.</p>
      <p>The environmental campaigner was discussing the launch of his new book, but spoke about other historical genocides.</p>
      <p>“The fact of the matter is, millions of people have been killed in vicious circumstances on a regular basis throughout history,” he said.</p>

      <p>Mr Hallam added that, when viewed in the context of atrocities, the Holocaust was “almost a normal event … just another f***ery in human history”.</p>
      <p>The environmental group “unreservedly” denounced Mr Hallam’s comments, with local branches posting on Twitter in support of the Jewish community.</p>
      <p>An Extinction Rebellion spokesman said: “Jewish people and many others are deeply wounded by the comments today (Wednesday).</p>
      <p>“Internal conversations have begun with the XR Conflict team about how to manage the conflict process that will address this issue.</p>
      <p>“We stand by restorative outcomes as preferable, although in some cases exclusion is necessary.”</p>
      <p>Mr Hallam was arrested in September for allegedly attempting to cause disruption at Heathrow Airport using a drone.</p>
      <p>He is due to appear in court for a preparatory hearing on November 29 on charges of conspiracy to cause public nuisance, and a full trial is scheduled for February next year.</p>
      <p>His comments prompted a backlash on Twitter, including from Germany’s foreign minister Heiko Maas, who condemned Mr Hallam’s remarks about the “uniquely inhumane” event.</p>
      <p>Extinction Rebellion added: “Our 6th Principle states: We welcome everyone and every part of everyone working actively to create safer and more accessible spaces.</p>
      <p>“Our movement must be safe for Jews as well as all other minorities, marginalised peoples, and religious groups.</p>
      <p>“We stand in solidarity with XR Germany, with Jewish communities, and with all those affected by the Holocaust, both in the past and in our times.”</p>
