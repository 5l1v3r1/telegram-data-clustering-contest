      <h1>Post Animal Announce Second Album Forward Motion Godyssey, Share New Single</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T10:44:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 10:44</time> by <a rel="author">Rachita Vasandani  </a></address>
      <p>Chicago-based alt-prog band Post Animal announced their forthcoming second album on Wednesday. <i>Forward Motion Godyssey</i> “finds the band endlessly shapeshifting as they explore new sonic touchstones and expand on their psych-rock origins,” per a press release.</p>
      <p>“Making this record, we wanted to go extreme in a lot of different directions—we wanted to be as poppy as we’ve ever been, as over-the-top as we’ve ever been, as grandiose and heavy and dramatic as we’ve ever been,” says drummer Wesley Toledo. The album is described as “at turns rhapsodic and unsettling, meditative and chaotic and the result is anything but subtle: a body of work that beckons deep involvement from the listener, a richly layered experience primed to leave its audience indelibly transported.”</p>
      <p>Despite losing co-founder Joe Keery to <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/tag/Netflix">Netflix</a>’s <i>Stranger Things</i>, the band is deeply rooted in brotherhood and that is said to be evident throughout their latest album, <i>Forward Motion Godyssey</i>, available Feb. 14, 2020, on <a href="https://polyvinylrecords.com/store/post_animal_forward_motion_godyssey?pvr=forward-motion-godyssey-socials">Polyvinyl</a>.</p>
      <p>The group also have a new single, “Schedule,” along with their album announcement. The synth-heavy second single follows the previously released “<a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2019/10/post-animal-new-single-safe-or-not.html">Safe or Not</a>.” The band explains: “We wrote a song so pop it’s not pop. It’s what the original idea deserved. Now, using the melody as a vehicle, take in the lyrics, forge your own path as you gain perspective from the genuine, heartfelt message penned from within Post Animal.”</p>
      <p>The group is currently on tour with <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2019/09/twin-peaks-lookout-low-interview.html">Twin Peaks</a> right now, and will be opening for <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2019/04/cage-the-elephant-social-cues-review.html">Cage The Elephant</a> in the U.K./E.U. early next year.</p>
