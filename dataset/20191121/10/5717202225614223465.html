      <p>Former Everton striker Andy Gray reckons his former club’s lack of a genuine goalscorer is one of Marco Silva’s biggest issues at Goodison Park right now.</p>
      <p>The club currently lie 15th in the Premier League table having scored just 13 goals in their 12 games so far.</p>

      <p>Silva has been unable to settle on a go-to individual for the central striking position, rotating between Dominic Calvert-Lewin, Moise Kean, Richarlison and Cenk Tosun.</p>
      <p>Gray reckons none of the manager’s current options are natural’s in front of goal.</p>
      <p>He said (<a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/everton-legend-andy-gray-says-20925227">Mirror</a>): “They’re lacking a genuine goalscorer. That’s a big problem for Everton.</p>

      <p>“We don’t know if Moise Kean is going to be good enough yet. He’s still young, they’ve taken a gamble on him and he’s going to need time.</p>
      <p>“Dominic Calvert-Lewin does a lot of good things, maybe works too hard – if that sounds stupid – outside the box trying to make up for his deficiencies inside the box. If he’s going to be top bracket, he needs to up his goal ratio dramatically.</p>
      <p>“Cenk Tosun, his goalscoring record was good. But that was Turkey and this is a different league altogether.”</p>
      <h3>TBR’s view</h3>
      <p>Everton’s current return in the Premier League is a worry.</p>

      <p>Hopes were high for young Kean, but it is clear he is going to take some time to settle in.</p>
      <p>Richarlison is arguably still learning the position, but natural strikers Calvert-Lewin and Tosun have both struggled to be prolific in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>Gray has a point, and toothless Everton may perhaps need to dip into the transfer market in January.</p>
