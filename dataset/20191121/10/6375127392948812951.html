      <h3>RICHARD Gutierrez moved to ABS-CBN and the first role he played is that of a vampire in the soap “La Luna Sangre”, then he played a prince from another world in the comedy “Fantastica”. He’s so happy to now finally do a more realistic role in a straight drama, “Unbreakable”, where he plays the leading man of Bea Alonzo and Angelica Panganiban and which opens in theaters on November 27.</h3>
      <p>“I really missed doing dramatic films,” he says. “And I’m very thankful to Star Cinema for giving me the chance to be a part of a great project like ‘Unbreakable’, kasi first time ko nakatrabaho rito sina Bea and Angelica and also our director, Mae Cruz Alviar. I’m truly proud to be part of this team.”</p>
      <p>He’s also happy with the character he plays, Justin, the husband of Bea who later causes a rift between her and her best friend, Angelica. “Justin is a very challenging role,” he adds. “He’s quite complicated. Malayo siya sa totoong ako. But I have to open up some close chapters in my life to be able to understand why he behaves the way he does. He has to tackle some personal demons and sometimes, immature ang thinking process niya at marami siyang insecurities. I hope naitawid ko naman nang maayos ang role ko and did justice to it with the help of Direk Mae and my co-stars.”</p>
      <p>How is it working with Bea and Angelica? “First day pa lang namin sa story conference, they welcomed me warmly na at naging masaya agad ang samahan namin. I was really looking forward to get to work with them at heto na nga, nangyari na. They’re both very good actresses, sobrang professional. Akala mo, hindi sila seryoso pero kapag take na, ang gagaling nila. I also enjoyed working with Direk Mae. Very light lang siyang katrabaho but she always challenges me to give my best in every scene.”</p>
      <p>Chard says he was shooting everyday for the movie that his eldest son, Zion, started complaining about not seeing him enough. “Usually kasi, magkatabi kami matulog, so hinahanap niya ako. While I’m working, it’s good my dad, his lolo (Eddie Gutierrez), tinatabihan siya sa pagtulog kasi wala rin si Sarah (Lahbati) at nasa Europe. Sinabihan niya si Mommy (Annabelle Rama) na she wants to talk to our director about my absence. Kinausap naman siya ni Direk, nag-sorry and explained that his dad is just busy with work. Naintindihan naman niya.”</p>
      <p>Richard says his wedding to Sarah will definitely take place on March 14, 2020. “We’ve already bought yung mga susuotin namin sa wedding in Paris. But we have yet to settle all the other details with our planner. Naging busy kasi ako sa shooting and after this, I’m taping my new soap, also with Bea, titled ‘Kahit Minsan Pa’.”</p>
      <p>Why did they decide to have their wedding in March? “Kasi March is a special month for us. We got engaged in March 2017 when I proposed to her while we were in a snowy mountain in Switzerland. Kai, our second son, was also born in March. Then everything aligned. We were checking the dates, our availabilities and everything aligned for March so hayan, we’re getting married in March.”</p>
