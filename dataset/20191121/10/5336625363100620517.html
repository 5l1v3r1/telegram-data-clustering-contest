      <p>The Democrats have wrapped up their fifth 2020 presidential candidate debate at Tyler Perry Studios in Atlanta, and Stephen Colbert is here to bring you the weirdest bits.</p>
      <p><i>The Late Show</i> host kicked off with little digs at Joe Biden's eight-hours-too-early email, Bernie Sanders' bubblegum moment, Andrew Yang's MATH pin, and Amy Klobuchar's attempt to hit all the right history quote notes with words from former president Jimmy Carter <i>and</i> his vice president Walter Mondale.</p>
      <p>"Really reaching for the stars," says Colbert. "'In the immortal words of Michael Dukakis quoting George McGovern and Crystal Pepsi, let's all hop on the Hindenburg and root for the New York Jets!' Oh the humanities!"</p>
      <p>And of course, there was Biden's "reeeeeeeally, reeeeeeally poor choice of words" when it came to discussing ending violence against women. Oh dear.</p>
