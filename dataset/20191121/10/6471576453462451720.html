      <p>The Trailblazer nameplate has been off the U.S. market for years now, after the carmaker replaced it with the <a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/cars/chevrolet-traverse-2017.html#aeng_chevrolet-traverse-2017-20-ecotec-9at-255-hp">Traverse</a> a decade ago. A model with this name is currently on the market but only sells in Asia and South America.</p>
      <p>From spring 2020 that will change though, and the new addition to the <a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/auto-glossary/s.html#ge-sport-utility-vehicle"><u>SUV</u></a> family of <a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/chevrolet/">Chevrolet</a> cars will head to the road with Blazer-inspired styling, state-of-the-art technologies and engines to match.</p>
      <p><i>"The Trailblazer doesn’t simply let customers express their personal style. It encourages it with uniquely styled trims that allow buyers to select a vehicle that reflects their lifestyle,”</i> said in a statement Stuart Norris, design director of global Chevrolet compact SUVs. <i>“Its design is bold, confident and full of personality.”</i></p>
      <p>Two tiny little engines will form the backbone of the lineup, namely a 1.2- and a 1.3-liter turbo with up to 155 horsepower. Both are paired to a <a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/auto-glossary/c.html#ge-continuously-variable-transmission"><u>CVT</u></a> transmission, but the bigger engine will also be available with a nine-speed automatic and all-wheel-drive.</p>
      <p>Three driving modes are available for the vehicle, Normal, Snow and Sport, and it uses the selectable <a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/auto-glossary/a.html#ge-all-wheel-drive"><u>AWD</u></a> system that is already deployed on the Blazer and Traverse.</p>
      <p>Despite being marketed as a small SUV, the car provides more than enough space for one’s daily needs. The storage capacity is up to 54.4 cubic feet with the rear seats folded, and objects as long as 8.5 feet can be transported inside.</p>
      <p>To appeal to the tech-savvy generation of drivers, the Trailblazer comes with things like Bluetooth compatibility, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and SiriusXM radio.</p>
      <p>Several trims will be available, but for now Chevrolet did not mention much about them. 🏁</p>

        <summary>PRESS RELEASE</summary>
        <p>20 NOVEMBER 2019</p>
        <p>When it arrives in showrooms in Spring 2020, the 2021 Chevrolet Trailblazer will provide a uniquely youthful, yet functional alternative to the fast-growing small SUV segment.</p>
        <p>Like Chevrolet’s latest line of SUVs, the Trailblazer features a bold front fascia and sports car-inspired rear design. The ACTIV trim package amplifies this sporty style with a two-tone roof, unique front and rear fascia and dual exhaust, along with sport terrain tires and suspension tuning enhancements.</p>
        <p>“Slotting between the Trax and Equinox, the addition of the Trailblazer provides us with a great opportunity to expand the Chevy SUV family to new audiences,” said Steve Majoros, director of Chevrolet passenger car and crossover marketing. “With the new ACTIV trim, plus the sporty RS trim, we can appeal to customers’ varying active lifestyles.”</p>
        <p>
          <b>Design Stands Out from Competition</b>
        </p>
        <p>The all-new Trailblazer has a character of its own, bringing a bold and expressive look to the segment, and a new level of personalization.</p>
        <p>“The Trailblazer doesn’t simply let customers express their personal style. It encourages it with uniquely styled trims that allow buyers to select a vehicle that reflects their lifestyle,” said Stuart Norris, design director of global Chevrolet compact SUVs. “Its design is bold, confident and full of personality.”</p>
        <p>The Trailblazer’s exterior styling, which follows in the theme set by the Chevy Blazer, features Chevy’s signature dual-port grille, which gives its face a multilayered, dimensional appearance. The accent bar is integrated with the headlamps, helping to visually widen its stance, while a simulated front skidplate adds a sense of strength.</p>
        <p>ACTIV trim Trailblazers feature a new interpretation of the signature dual-port grille, with a larger opening for a more rugged look. The RS trim features a performance-inspired mesh grille with black Chevy bowtie and unique front splitter elements to define its sporty demeanor.</p>
        <p>The side profile includes taut bodyside lines, a sleek roofline and a bold hood shape to accentuate the Trailblazer’s youthful character. RS and ACTIV trim models boost the visual appeal with standard two-tone roofs. Large, wraparound taillamps seamlessly span the liftgate and bodyside, which adds to the visual width of the Trailblazer, providing a more planted look.</p>
        <p>Inside, the Trailblazer features a driver-focused, dual-cockpit interior design with an integrated center stack. High-quality finishes and stitching are customized to allow for different appearances at each trim level. The center console provides several storage options with up to 3.5 liters of open storage and 4.4 liters of storage under the armrest, as well as dual cupholders.</p>
        <p>
          <b>Suite of Standard Safety and Driver Assistance Features</b>
        </p>
        <p>All Trailblazer trims come with a comprehensive list of standard active safety and driver assistance features2, including:</p>
        <p>Forward Collision Alert</p>
        <p>Automatic Emergency Braking</p>
        <p>Front Pedestrian Braking</p>
        <p>IntelliBeam Headlamps (Auto High Beam Assist)</p>
        <p>Lane Keep Assist with Lane Departure Warning</p>
        <p>Rear Vision Camera</p>
        <p>Teen Driver</p>
        <p>Rear Seat Reminder3</p>
        <p>OnStar4</p>
        <p>Additional optional active safety and driver assistance features2 include:</p>
        <p>Adaptive Cruise Control - Camera</p>
        <p>Rear Park Assist</p>
        <p>Lane Change Alert with Side Blind Zone Alert</p>
        <p>Rear Cross Traffic Alert</p>
        <p>HD Rear Vision Camera</p>
        <p>ACTIV Tuned for Off-Road Use</p>
        <p>Trailblazer ACTIV is equipped with unique tires and shock tuning. The ACTIV dampers are tuned to enhance vehicle performance and ride comfort when traveling on gravel roads. The Hankook Sport Terrain 17-inch tires feature an aggressive shoulder design and an all-season tread pattern.</p>
        <p>The front fascia on Trailblazer ACTIV has been revised with the lower section designed for improved ground clearance. Additional exterior differentiation includes two-tone roof, standard roof rails and trapezoid-shaped exhaust tips.</p>
        <p>
          <b>Connectivity and Functionality</b>
        </p>
        <p>The Trailblazer will feature Chevy’s latest infotainment system5, providing the ability to use two Bluetooth-paired phones6 concurrently, which enables passengers in the vehicle to use their cellphones hands-free or the driver to use multiple phones hands-free.</p>
        <p>The audio system has available wireless Apple CarPlay7 and Android Auto8 connectivity and available SiriusXM with 360L9, featuring exclusive content, including commercial-free music, interviews, shows and performances. The system even learns customer preferences and shares recommendations based on listening habits. SiriusXM with 360L delivers both a satellite and streaming listening experience with more SiriusXM channels than ever before in the vehicle, plus the ability to make on-demand programming choices.</p>
        <p>The Trailblazer features 40/60 split folding second row seats, which enables the vehicle to accommodate objects up to 8.5 feet long. Overall storage capacity is rated up to 54.4cubic feet10 with the second row folded. For additional convenience, an available hands-free liftgate, with logo projection improves ease of loading and unloading cargo.</p>
        <p>
          <b>Power and AWD Confidence</b>
        </p>
        <p>Powered by either a 1.2L turbo or 1.3L turbo engine, the Trailblazer will deliver up to 155 horsepower. Both engines are mated with a standard Continuously Variable Transmission with selectable stop/start capability. A nine-speed automatic transmission is also available on Trailblazers equipped with the 1.3L engine and all-wheel drive.</p>
        <p>The Trailblazer is available with Chevy’s selectable AWD, also found in the Blazer and Traverse. Selectable AWD allows drivers to decide whether to activate their AWD system in off-road or inclement weather situations, or to deactivate when AWD performance is not required, to achieve improved fuel economy.</p>
        <p>Drive modes on front-wheel drive models include:</p>
        <p>Normal: Tailored for daily commuting and focused on ride comfort</p>
        <p>Snow: Provides more progressive throttle input for improved vehicle acceleration on snow- and ice-covered roads</p>
        <p>Sport: Modifies steering effort and shifting for a sportier feel and response</p>
        <p>AWD models add unique calibrations for more rear-wheel torque at lower speeds to improve the driving experience on moderately steep and unpaved surfaces.</p>
        <p>The Trailblazer is expected to arrive in U.S. showrooms in spring 2020. Specific trim and option pricing details will be announced closer to launch.</p>
