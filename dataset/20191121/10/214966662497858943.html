      <p><b>UPDATE @ 8.55 PM | </b>A Gold Coast woman and two children missing from the Gold Coast have been located.</p>
      <p>Police confirmed that the 27-year-old and her two children, aged 7 and 10-months, were located safe and well a short time ago.</p>
      <p>“Well Done Team! The 27yo woman and her two children have been located safe and well THANKS TO YOU.”</p>
      <p>“Someone saw our social media post and was able to direct police to their location.”</p>
      <p><b>EARLIER @ 7.00 PM |</b> Police are appealing for urgent help to locate a Gold Coast woman and her two children, who were last seen in Coombabah on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The 27-year-old and the children, a boy aged 7 and a 10-month-old baby girl left a home on Angela Avenue some time Tuesday morning intending to drive to the Sunshine Coast for a few days.</p>
      <p>Family and friends have not heard from the woman since, which police say is out of character, with serious concerns now being held for their safety and well-being.</p>
      <p>Anyone with information is urged to immediately contact police.</p>
