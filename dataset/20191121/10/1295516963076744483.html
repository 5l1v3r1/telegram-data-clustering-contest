      <h1>Martin Scorsese's The Irishman Gets a Marvel Makeover in Parody Trailer</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T10:11:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 10:11</time> by <a rel="author">Steve Russell</a></address>
      <p>Not one to miss an opportunity, Jimmy Kimmel has poked fun at the recent controversy created after filmmaker <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/martin-scorsese/">Martin Scorsese</a> stated that Marvel Studios movies don't count as "cinema," referring to them instead as "<a href="https://www.cbr.com/martin-scorsese-slams-marvel-films/">theme parks</a>."</p>
      <p>On <i>Jimmy Kimmel Live!</i>, Kimmel introduced a parody trailer for the Scorsese's new movie <i><a href="https://screenrant.com/irishman-movie-deaging-tech-marvel-better-reason/">The Irishman</a></i> entitled <i>The Irish Man</i>. The tongue-in-cheek take turns Robert De Niro's character into an Irish-themed version of Iron Man and gifts him a special ring that glows with the power of the cloverleaf. Then, after offering his services and promising that "Whatever you need to do, I'm available," an Iron Man helmet shuts over De Niro's face, its eyes glowing green before cutting to inside where we see De Niro surrounded by Iron Man's HUD display.</p>

      <p>The trailer also features Al Pacino turning into the Hulk and an invitation from Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury to join the Avengers Initiative -- an invitation De Niro declines. It then ends with De Niro's character in a full green Iron Man suit, complete with top hat and a glowing cloverleaf instead of Tony Stark's familiar arc reactor.</p>
      <p>Following the backlash his comments generated, Scorsese later wrote an <a href="https://www.cbr.com/martin-scorsese-marvel-comments-op-ed/">op-ed letter</a> highlighting how, in his opinion, the Marvel Cinematic Universe lacks revelation, mystery or genuine emotional danger. As far as he's concerned, Marvel movies are devoid of risk.</p>
