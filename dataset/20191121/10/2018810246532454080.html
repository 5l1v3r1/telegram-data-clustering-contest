      <p>Snom, a precious Bug/Ice type Pokémon that’s new to the series with <i>Sword</i> and <i>Shield</i>, appears unassuming at first glance. At least until you see the Twitter account dedicated to exposing his inner thoughts.</p>
      <p>I have a soft spot for bug type Pokémon. They fit naturally into the series’ themes of evolution, and they manage to transform a creepy creature into something much cuter. Snom is the best example of that kind of Pokémon logic: it evolves from a tiny little blob into a majestic moth-like creature. According to its Poké Dex entry, it eats snow and disguises itself as an icicle as it sleeps. What a cutie!</p>
      <p>According to Snomposting, a Twitter account that tweets in first person from the perspective of a Snom, this tiny creature is much more aggressive than one would think.</p>

      <p>This Snom also has an intense hatred of green Bug type Pokémon.</p>

      <p>Snom, it appears, is an elitist when it comes to bugs. The correct parameters for a bug are to be as Snom-like as possible.</p>

      <p>It’s shitposting, but from the mouth of Snom. He’s going to commit arson and then break out of jail.</p>

      <p>Snom also only follows four people on Twitter. One of them is Lil Nas X. One day I hope to be as powerful as Snom.</p>
