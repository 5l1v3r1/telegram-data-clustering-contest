        <b>- The obviously proud father referred to his quadruplets as God’s miracle</b>
      </p>
      <p>Welcoming a child in one’s family is a great thing but the occasion is even more special when the parents get more kids than they expected.</p>
      <p>Such is the case of one Chukwudi Ufondu who took to his Facebook page to celebrate his quadruplets on their seventh birthday. Having more than one child at a time can be quite daunting considering the financial implication but that does not seem to have stopped Chukwudi from adequately taking care of his quadruplets.</p>
      <p>The proud father shared lovely photos of his children as they wore different cute outfits and posed for the camera. In an accompanying post, Chukwudi explained that his kids are God’s miracle to him.</p>
