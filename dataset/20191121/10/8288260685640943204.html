      <p>Former Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond is appearing at the High Court in Edinburgh accused of serious sexual offences against 10 women.</p>
      <p>He has previously denied all the charges.</p>
      <p>The former SNP leader led the Scottish independence campaign, stepping down after defeat in the September 2014 vote.</p>
      <p>Salmond is charged with attempting to rape one woman and sexually assaulting another woman with intent to rape, among 14 charges.</p>
      <p>At Bute House on June 13 2014, the indictment states he placed a woman's legs over his, repeatedly kissed her face and neck, groped her, then blocked her path.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Salmond is then said to have pinned her against a wall, pulled at her clothes and stripped himself naked before trying to rape her on a bed.</p>
      <p>The former first minister is also accused of sexually assaulting a woman with intent to rape at Bute House in December 2013.</p>
      <p>The indictment alleges he committed 14 offences in total, including at the Scottish Parliament and in a restaurant in Glasgow.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Salmond denies the charges against him.</p>
      <p>A trial date has been set for March 9, with a preliminary hearing taking place on January 22.</p>
      <p>The trial is estimated to run for about four weeks.</p>
