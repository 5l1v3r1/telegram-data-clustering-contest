      <p>Microsoft is letting a group of testers connect their Google accounts to Outlook for the web, and manage all their emails and calendar entries from a single place.</p>
      <p>The option isn't yet available to everyone, but if you're part of the testing group, you will see a pop-up prompting you to "Add your Google Mail and Calendar to Outlook and easily manage everything in one place."</p>

      <p>The new option was first reported by French Twitter user Florian B, who discovered he was part of the test group after logging into Outlook as normal.</p>
      <p>He found that he was unable to add more than one Google account, but hopefully this limitation will be lifted before Gmail integration is rolled out to all Outlook users.</p>

      <p>As The Verge reports, it seems like the integration still needs a little work before it's ready for global release. While it looks the part, with your Gmail inbox and Google Calendar presented neatly side-by-side, switching between your Google and Outlook accounts causes the entire page to refresh.</p>
      <h4>Get connected</h4>
      <p>When testing is complete and the integration is fully polished, it'll be a welcome addition for anyone who uses Outlook for work and Gmail for their personal messages, allowing them to switch between both without logging into two sites and switching browser tabs.</p>
      <p>If you can't wait until then, you can always install a free email client instead, which will let you access all your email accounts from a single desktop application, and keep your messages backed up on your device so you can read and search them offline.</p>
