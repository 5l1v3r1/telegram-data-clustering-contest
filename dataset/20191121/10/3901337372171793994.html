      <p>Orlando Pirates will be expected to make big decisions in the upcoming weeks in attempting to change the fortunes of the club. </p>
      <p>Pirates have had a difficult season so far, after being knocked out early in the cup competitions they played in, while they also struggled to collect results in the league.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Under the club’s former coach Milutin Sredojevic, Pirates hoped to have a better campaign than the last two seasons. </p>
      <p>However, the Serbian mentor shocked the club and the football fraternity by resigning in August, after only two matches in the league, as well as the CAF Champions League preliminary round exit against Green Eagles of Zambia.</p>
      <p>Rulani Mokwena has been in charge since, and assisted by Fadlu Davids and Franck Plaine.</p>
      <p>However, results have been coming in dribs and drabs for the team and as a result, the club is expected to evaluate the squad, and possibly make changes for the second half of the season, after the team’s last three matches of the year against Polokwane City, Baroka FC and Black Leopards.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Prior to the start of the season, the Buccaneers made no less than nine signings, with Kabelo Dlamini, Bongani Sam, Fortune Makaringe, Siphesihle Ndlovu, Tebogo Tlolane  Tshegofatso Mabasa, Gabadinho Mhango, Joris Delle and Austin Muwowo all joining the club.</p>
      <p>South African U20 defender Thabiso Monyane was promoted from the club’s youth ranks, while another development graduate Zakhele Lepasa returned from a loan stint with TS Galaxy.    </p>
      <p>Mokwena and his technical team currently work with a squad of 34 players, as confirmed by the former Mamelodi Sundowns assistant coach in the media recently.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Like in any club, player exits could be expected as decisions are to be made regarding some of the players who have struggled for game-time. </p>
      <p>Furthermore, Bucs have appeared to be keen on reinforcing the squad with a defender, after the Soweto giants handed former Maritzburg United defender Brian Onyango a trial earlier in the season.</p>
