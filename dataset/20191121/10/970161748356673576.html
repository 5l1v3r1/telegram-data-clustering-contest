      <p>Even though it’s his tune, Sir Elton John has admitted he needed a teleprompter when performing Candle In The Wind at <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/diana/">Princess Diana</a>’s funeral in 1997.</p>
      <p>The performer took the grand piano to sing a revised version of his 1973 hit to honour his dear friend, who died following a car crash in a Paris tunnel.</p>
      <p>With not a dry eye in the house, the Rocketman performed the stirring tune (written with Bernie Taupin) however now Elton has revealed he needed a teleprompter, hidden beside his instrument.</p>
      <p>‘It’s the first time I had a teleprompter, a teleprompter down on my left-hand side because I thought if I sing “Goodbye Norma Jean” I’m gonna get hung, drawn and quartered,’ Elton said this week.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/elton-john-returns-royal-academy-music-revealing-shock-near-death-experience-11183197/">Speaking at the Royal Academy of Music</a>, the 72-year-old added: ‘So just for precaution, I had the teleprompter there.’</p>

      <p>Originally written for Marilyn Monroe, the song had the line ‘Goodbye Norma Jean’ which went on to be ‘Goodbye England’s rose’ for the funeral service.</p>
      <p>And, spoiler alert, he didn’t stuff it up.</p>
      <p>Elton’s funeral revision dedicated to the Princess Of Wales shot to #1 on the UK charts, as well as around the world. It was Elton’s fourth single to reach the top spot in the country, with the Guinness Book Of Records declaring, in 2007, it was the biggest selling single ‘since records began’, shifting 33 million copies.</p>
      <p>Bing Crosby’s White Christmas has technically sold more (at 50 million), but it was released before charts began, so sorry Bing – Elton’s got that crown when it comes to the chart-topper.</p>
      <p>Elton has been sharing many an anecdote about his time in the spotlight as he continues to promote his memoir, Me: Elton John.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week he took to the stage alongside David Walliams at Hammersmith’s Eventim Apollo where <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/elton-john-says-freddie-mercury-physically-terrifying-look-final-days-death-aids-11186836/">he recalled the final days of pal Freddie Mercury.</a></p>
      <p>‘I didn’t go and see him often as Aids was terrifying and he was physically terrifying to look at,’ Elton said, according to Daily Star. ‘While he was dying he was still buying things at auction.</p>
      <p>‘He wasn’t thinking about dying at all. He showed no fear to me about dying, no fear or sadness. When you went there you had an audience with Freddie.’</p>

      <p>Elton recalled receiving a gift from Freddie of a watercolour painting that continues to sit next to his bed.</p>
