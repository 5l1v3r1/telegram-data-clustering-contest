      <h1>Vapers to be warned, not detained — PNP</h1>

      <h3>PHILIPPINE National Police Officer-in-Charge Lieutenant General Archie Francisco F. Gamboa yesterday clarified that violators of the nationwide ban on vaping in public will just be taken to the police station for documentation and released after being given a warning.</h3>
      <p>There will be no detention for violators of the ban, he made clear. All police will do is take the violator to the nearest police station for official recording and then sent home. Fines will depend on local city and municipal ordinances.</p>
      <p>Gen. Gamboa said that at present, police cannot file any charges against violators of the ban although they can bring the offfenders to the police stations for blotter recording</p>
      <p>“Wala nga eh... Just to implement the directive of the President. Under the police power of the State you can do that. Kaya nga sinasabi ko, it’s not even a detention... When you arrest a person, when you try to present some evidence, try to point out some specific offense and you have an intent to file a case, that’s custodial investigation,” the PNP-OIC, who is also a lawyer, explained.</p>
      <p>According to the top police official, police are implementing President Duterte’s directive as part of their power to protect public health which is a national interest.</p>
      <p>“Wala namang detention or jail time, kaagad naman na sila ay palalayain. Ito ay magsisilbi lamang na babala sa lahat ng mga vape users na ilagay sa tamang lugar ang paggamit nito na hindi nakakaaabala sa ating mga kababayan,” said PNP spokesman, Brigadier Gen. Bernard M. Banac.</p>
      <p>Banac said they are waiting for the official release of an Executive Order from the Palace regarding President Duterte’s directive.</p>
      <p>At present, the existing Executive Order No. 26 which aims to establish a smoke-free environment in public places will be the PNP’s guideline in imposing the presidential directive since vaping devices or e-cigarettes emit more smoke compared to tobacco products, the PNP spokesperson said.</p>
