      <p>Stephen Colbert's New Zealand trip may have started with <a href="https://mashable.com/video/jacinda-ardern-stephen-colbert-in-new-zealand/">a nice, cheerful ride from the airport with PM Jacinda Ardern</a>, but now the real work begins.</p>
      <p>In the segment above, two former New Zealand All Blacks rugby players, Piri Weepu and DJ Forbes, join Sky TV broadcaster Laura McGoldrick to teach the <i>Late Show</i> host how to play their national sport â€” from the precision of lineouts and kicks to the heavy lifting of tackles and scrums.</p>
      <p>The verdict? Colbert may not be a natural rugby player, but he certainly gives 110 percent.</p>
