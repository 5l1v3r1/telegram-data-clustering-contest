      <p>MADISON, Wis. - Step aside, "Let it Go!" Parents will soon have a new earworm to get out of their heads.</p>
      <p>After six long, "Frozen"-less years, the sound of children shrieking with excitement will once again fill local theaters, as the highly anticipated Disney sequel premieres Friday, Nov. 22.</p>
      <p>The Disney sequel is expected to generate more than $100 million during its opening weekend.</p>
      <p>As part of the winter hype train for the film, Marcus Theaters is hosting a free, "Frozen" family party from 12 p.m.-2 p.m. Saturday, Nov. 23 and Sunday, Nov. 24.</p>
      <p>Marcus' family-focused celebrations will include snacks, make-your-own Olaf treat bags, and paper snowflakes.</p>
      <p>Participating theaters include both the Marcus Point Cinema in Madison and the Marcus Palace Cinema in Sun Prairie. Marcus' locations in Appleton, Waukesha, and New Berlin are also participating.</p>
