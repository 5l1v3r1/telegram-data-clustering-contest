      <p>LONDON - British Airways flights have been disrupted by what the airline describes as a "technical issue."</p>
      <p>The problem resulted in delays and what the airline described as a "very small" number of flight cancellations overnight, disrupting an unknown number of passengers.</p>
      <p><a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/08/07/business/british-airways-london-flights-canceled/index.html">British Airways</a>, which is owned by International Airlines Group, said in a statement that its "teams are working hard to resolve a technical issue which is affecting some of our flights."</p>
      <p>The carrier said it was re-booking some customers onto alternative flights and offering hotels to those who are "unable to continue their journeys."</p>
      <p>Customers have been asked to refer to the <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/08/06/europe/british-airways-flight-smoke-intl-scli/index.html">British Airways</a> website to check their flight status. The airline said it was "very sorry for the disruption" to passengers' travel plans.</p>
      <p>British Airways said that it plans to operate a full flight schedule on Thursday, but the issue may cause some residual delays.</p>
      <p>The airline has been hit by a series of technical snafus in recent years. British Airways was forced to cancel over 100 flights in August when its computer systems crashed.</p>
      <p>In 2017, it canceled flights from London's Heathrow and Gatwick airports after "a major IT system failure" caused severe disruption to its global operations, stranding 75,000 customers.</p>
