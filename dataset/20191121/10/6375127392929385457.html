      <h1>Ai Ai drops plan to get pregnant</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T10:28:35+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 10:28</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://journal.com.ph/authors/mario-bautista" target="_blank">Mario Bautista</a></address>
      <h3>AI AI de las Alas is a judge in “The Clash” and now that the show has only 8 finalists, what does she think should be the primary reason for a contestant to win?</h3>
      <p>“Dapat, performance pa rin,” she says. “Kung minsan kasi, dahil sa back stories na galing sa hirap, o umiyak, nag-break down, hinimatay, maaawa ka, but then hindi naman charity work ang show so hindi dapat na emosyon ang pairalin mo. Paligsahan pa rin ito ng kung sino ang pinakamagaling kumanta. Kung sino 'yung pinakahalimaw talaga mag-perform to the highest degree.”</p>
      <p>Last weekend, among those who were eliminated included Tombi Romulo, an admitted tomboy. When Ai Ai had a presscon for the 5th renewal of her contract with Marikina Food Corporation, makers of Hobe Pancit Canton, Palabok, Special Bihon and Hobe Express Instant Bihon, Tombi was there and sang two songs for the press. Ai Ai declared she’ll help Tombi in her singing career. We thought she no longer wants to manage anyone after her bad experience with Ex Battalion?</p>
      <p>“Alam nyo naman ako, wala akong kadala-dala,” she says. “After Ex Battalion, heto, si Ex B naman ang ima-manage ko. Ex B for Ex Babae, dating babae. I believe kasi in her talent sa pagkanta. Basta sana, maganda ang attitude niya at wag siyang magluluka-lukahan.”</p>
      <p>We tell Ai Ai that among the remaining contestants, our  bet now is Jeremiah Tiangco as he has the total package of good singing voice and good looks. He has better chances of making it big in local showbiz. Tombi says at this point: “Kaya lang, dyuts siya, e.”</p>
      <p>How did you know? Ai Ai asked her.</p>
      <p>“E kasi, kapag magkakasama kaming natutulog, sa umaga, naka-boxers silang mga lalaki at nakatelag yung kanila. 'Yung sa kanya maliit, mas malaki pa 'yung kay Clark Serafin.”</p>
      <p>Of course, the writers who heard her were hooting at this point. “Yan ang ikasisikat mo! Magiging kontrobersyal ka!” they tell her.</p>
      <p>Someone quipped: “We thought presscon ito ng Hobe Noodles, para kay Tombi pala ito.”</p>
      <p>It’s good the big boss of Hobe Noodles, Mr. Bob Co, is good enough to give Tombi a chance for exposure in their presscon. He says their company is very satisfied as the sales of their product really went up after they got Ai Ai as endorser.</p>
      <p>“Matagal na ang Hobe, which means good taste, but when we got her, mas tumaas talaga ang sales namin,” he adds. “She’s the ideal and perfect endorser for our brand as she is a caring wife and mother herself, kaya 5th time na niyang mag-renew ng contract with us. She really cooks Hobe for her family kaya sinusunod siya ng mga misis at nanay.”</p>
      <p>“Totoo 'yon, nagluluto talaga ako ng Hobe at favorite 'yan ng husband ko (Gerald Sibayan),” says Ai Ai. “Masarap naman kasi talaga at madaling lutuin. They have differrent noodle variants you can choose from and I recommend all of them for your family. I’m really thankful to Hobe and to Mr. Bob Co, our ninong sa kasal, for keeping me as their endorser all these years.”</p>
      <p>Aside from “The Clash”, Ai Ai is now also seen regularly  in “Sunday Pinasaya” and she has just finished the Metro Manila Filmfest entry, “3Pol Trobol: Huli Ka Balbon!” with Coco Martin and Jennylyn Mercado that opens on Christmas Day. She’ll also have a new soap by next year. And we thought she’ll slow down next year to get pregnant?</p>
      <p>“Hindi na muna,” she says. “For health reasons. Kasi lahat ng kinakain ko ngayon puro organic. My doctor says na kapag nagbuntis ako, I will have to take synthetic medicines at baka hindi mag-agree sa katawan ko ngayon so the baby might suffer. So wag na lang daw muna at kawawa naman yung baby.”</p>
