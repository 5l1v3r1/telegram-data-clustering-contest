      <p>As one of the biggest car companies in the world, <a href="https://drivetribe.com/p/will-toyota-come-back-to-racing-GUum27oySG-QynuSKFYVkA?iid=C6nIogWvQguspGtyHMCt-g">it sure was weird when back in 2017 Toyota simply stopped licensing its vehicles to racing video games</a>. It was even weirder that the company, despite its size, never actually explained why that decision was made.</p>
      <p>Aside from an appearance in <i>Gran Turismo Sport</i>—whose licensing deals and development likely pre-dated the 2017 decision—we’ve had loads of <i>Forza</i> and <i>Need For Speed</i> games come and go during that time, and not one of them has had a Supra or Celica. And the closest we ever got to an explanation as to why <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/29510/toyota-backtracks-on-why-it-wont-license-cars-to-video-games-like-need-for-speed">was this bizarre rescinded tweet from Toyota UK:</a></p>

      <p>But whatever the actual reasons for Toyota’s absence, it’s over now. Starting with the 98 Supra RZ, Toyota is back with an appearance in <i>Forza Horizon 4</i>:</p>

      <p>A low-key way to announce a return, then, but also fitting given the circumstances Toyota left in the first place.</p>
