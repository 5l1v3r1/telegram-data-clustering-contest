      <p>This little pug dog appears to be entirely in control of his master during their unusual walkies.</p>
      <p>The pet is making its owner do all the hard work by standing on his shoulders during their daily stroll.</p>
      <p>The pair are said to be a common sight around Motherwell, North Lanarkshire.</p>
      <p>Student Connor Cassidy, 16, took this bizarre footage and asked the man why the black pug stood on his shoulders.</p>
      <p>The owner replied ‘that’s just where the dog likes to be.’</p>

      <p>Connor shared the video on Twitter, where it has now been seen over 3,000 times.</p>

      <p>He said: ‘I’ve seen him a few times and we were talking to him.</p>
      <p>‘It’s so funny. The dog’s not got a lead or anything – it’s just standing there.</p>
      <p>‘I videoed it because it was just so confusing. The dog looked like he was having a great time.’</p>
      <p>Dog walking injuries are on the rise with people suffering broken hands and wrists as well as tendon or ligament damage as a result of leashes being yanked.</p>
      <p>We haven’t yet heard of strained shoulders from carrying a pet though.</p>
