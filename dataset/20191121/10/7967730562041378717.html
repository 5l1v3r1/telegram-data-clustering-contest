      <p>A radio telescope in Western Australia’s outback has discovered remnants of a supernova explosion which could have been seen by Indigenous people across Australia thousands of years ago.</p>
      <p>The Murchison Widefield Array, a multi-million dollar low-frequency radio telescope located at the Murchison Radio-astronomy Observatory in WA’s Mid-West, has been scanning the Earth’s southern skies since 2013.</p>

      <p>It has recently captured a new view of the Milky Way’s galactic centre by showing what our galaxy would look like if human eyes could see radio waves.</p>
      <p>Curtin University and International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research astrophysicist Dr Natasha Hurley-Walker said the data for the research came from the GaLactic and Extragalactic All-sky MWA survey (GLEAM) she had been conducting for years.</p>
      <p>“It’s an all-sky survey, which was only possible because the MWA has such an enormous view of about 1000 square degrees,” she said.</p>

      <p>“So we can instantaneously look at huge swathes of the sky and it only takes about 25,000 images to mosaic the entire sky.”</p>
      <p>And while most radio telescopes only see single frequencies, Dr Hurley-Walker said the MWA can take it all in at once.</p>
      <p>“This is really important because it gives us a ‘radio colour’ view of the sky,” she said.</p>
      <p>“Because different objects have different radio colours, the wide frequency range makes it possible for us to disentangle overlapping objects as we look towards the galactic centre.”</p>
      <p>Using the powerful images and the GLEAM survey, Dr Hurley-Walker and her colleagues were able to discover remnants of 27 massive stars that exploded in supernovae at the end of their lives thousands to hundreds of thousands of years ago.</p>
      <p>The radio images traced the edges of the explosions as they continued their ongoing expansion into interstellar space, with some stars found to be more than eight times the size of our Sun.</p>
      <p>Some supernova remnants that are younger and closer or in dense environments are easier to spot, with 295 already known, whereas smaller and older ones are harder to find because of their distance from Earth.</p>
      <p>“The denser the environment, the more the explosion will propagate outwards and encounter more material in space, making the shock much brighter,” Dr Hurley-Walker said.</p>
      <p>“It also makes the remnants smaller because they can’t expand as far, so the brightness is contained to a smaller area, which helps us see it better.</p>

      <p>“Whereas in low-density environments, the shockwaves just propagate outwards without hitting anything and because it doesn’t have much material to slam into, it dissipates into space, making them nearly impossible to locate.”</p>
      <p>However, unlike other instruments, the MWA is able to find them.</p>
      <p>“We found three very faint supernova remnants in really low dense environments which no one had ever seen before and no other telescope in the world would be sensitive to,” Dr Hurley-Walker said.</p>
      <p>One of the newly discovered supernova remnants is believed to have belonged to a star that died 9000 years ago, meaning the bright explosion could have been visible to Indigenous people in Australia at the time.</p>
      <p>Dr Hurley-Walker said she found the young star near the dark constellation that Indigenous Australians called the ‘Emu in the Sky’.</p>
      <p>“The constellation is actually dust lying between us and the centre of the galaxy and it traces out into this beautiful dark figure of an elongated emu,” she said.</p>
      <p>“The object I found was 10 degrees away from that and in a much quieter area of sky without any dust, so that’s why the light would have got to us because anything that lies inside or behind that dust would have been shrouded.”</p>
      <p>Dr Hurley-Walker said she would be working with Indigenous astronomy expert Associate Professor Duane Hamacher to find any possible links with Aboriginal traditions and stories.</p>
      <p>“We’re looking through records and at some point we might be able to do some on-the-ground research and talk to Indigenous elders to see if such a story would have survived,” she said.</p>

      <p>The MWA is also the first fully operative precursor instrument to the world’s largest and most sensitive radio telescope, the Square Kilometre Array.</p>
      <p>It was announced in 2012 that Australia and South Africa would co-host the billion-dollar SKA project, which is expected to start conducting observations from next year.</p>
      <p>The low-frequency part of the SKA will be built at the same site as the MWA, while South Africa’s Karoo region will host the core of the high and mid-frequency dishes.</p>
      <p>While the MWA is perfect for finding supernova remnants, Dr Hurley-Walker said it was still limited.</p>
      <p>“The SKA will be thousands of times more sensitive, have much better resolution and an even wider frequency range,” she said.</p>
      <p>“So the kind of observation that would usually take me several weeks to make, the SKA will be able to do in just one night.”</p>
      <p>The SKA will eventually use thousands of dishes and up to a million low-frequency antennas to allow astronomers to monitor the sky in unprecedented detail and survey the entire sky faster than any existing system.</p>
      <p>“We are hoping to use it to unlock the secrets of dark energy, figure out when the first stars were born, and even search for signals from extraterrestrial life,” Dr Hurley-Walker said.</p>
