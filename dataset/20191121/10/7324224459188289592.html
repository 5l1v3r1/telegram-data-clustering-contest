      <h2>Stafford voters will have the chance to find out prospective MPs’ views on environmental issues next week.</h2>

      <p>A Question Time-style event is being held in Stafford town centre on Tuesday, November 26, and all prospective parliamentary candidates vying for the seat have been invited to attend.</p>
      <p>Voters are being encouraged to submit questions in advance or when they arrive at the event, which will start at 7.30pm at Oddfellows Hall in Greengate Street. If their question is chosen they will be asked to put it forward to the panel.</p>
      <p>Candidates will also have the chance to give a short presentation on their party’s environmental policy and the event will be chaired by curate and former journalist Alison Thomas.</p>
      <p>Event organiser Robert Hine from environmental group Sustainability Matters said: “We feel it is vital that party policies on a range of topics relating to the environment are subject to scrutiny, whether it’s climate change, plastics, air pollution, or loss of natural habitats and wildlife.</p>
      <p>“Our planet is at a tipping point, and we regard these issues as the most important of our time.”</p>
      <p>Jeremy Lefroy, who has held the seat for the Conservatives since 2010, announced earlier this year he would be stepping down at the next General Election.</p>
      <p>The candidates standing for election in the Stafford constituency on December 12 are Emma Carter (Green), Theo Clarke (Conservative), Joyce Still (Labour) and Alexander Wagner (Liberal Democrat).</p>
