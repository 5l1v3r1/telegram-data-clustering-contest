          <u>CLAIM</u>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>A short video clip of <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/delhi">East Delhi</a> MP and former Indian opener <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Gautam-Gambhir">Gautam Gambhir</a> is being shared to claim that he said “Doing commentary is more important than attending meetings to discuss pollution crisis”.</p>
      <p>A Twitter user by the name of Aarti shared the clip from her verified handle with the same claim and cautioned people against voting for celebrities in elections.</p>

      <p>In the 8-second-long clip shared by Aarti, one can hear a news reporter telling Gambhir that he didn’t attend the pollution meet for which he was invited. Gambhir retorts, “What is more important, work or meetings?”</p>
      <p>The same clip was shared on Facebook by Vikas Yogi, national media coordinator of <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Aam-Aadmi-Party">Aam Aadmi Party</a> (AAP), along with a caption saying, “For Gambhir, his work is more important than attending meetings to tackle pollution”.</p>

      <p>Another AAP leader Sunny Upadhyay shared the clip accusing Gambhir of becoming an MP only to attack Delhi CM <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Arvind-Kejriwal">Arvind Kejriwal</a>.</p>

          <u>TRUTH</u>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>The claim made by these users is false. The 8-second-long clip of Gambhir is a trimmed version of a longer video. The trimmed version of Gambhir’s byte to news agency ANI is being shared to make the false claim. In the original, full video, Gambhir is talking about doing ground work as an MP. He was neither referring to his personal work or giving commentary.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <u>VERIFICATION AND METHODOLOGY</u>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Since an ANI mic can be seen in the video frame, we used keywords ‘Gautam Gambhir ANI pollution’ and found a tweet by ANI, which had the complete quote given by the cricketer-turned-politician.</p>
      <figure>
        <iframe data-src="https://twitter.com/ANI/status/1196339784853151744" data-embed-type="twitter-tweet" width="100%" height="0" data-service="Twitter" scrolling="no" nowide=""/>
      </figure>
      <p>In the 91-second-long byte, Gambhir can be heard saying he can “Leave eating jalebis if it reduces pollution.”</p>
      <p>He then adds, “In the five months I have been an MP, I have worked a lot to tackle pollution, be it buying 70 EDMC vehicles worth 90 crores, sprinkling machines, vacuum cleaners or initiation of work at Ghazipur landfill.”</p>
      <p>“Like me, many other Delhiites have small daughters; We all are serious about fighting pollution except for AAP. You should ask Kejriwal what he has done in the last five years to control pollution in the city,” he said.</p>
      <p>Then at 0:53 seconds, the portion that is now being clipped and shared with false claims can be heard. At this point, Gambhir asks the reporter if meetings are more important than the work he has done in the last five months.”</p>
      <p>“I have already told you the number of measures I have taken to curb pollution, but what has Kejriwal done in the last five years? On the 11th itself, when I was invited, I had intimated that I would not be able to make it as I was contractually bound. Instead of wasting time on trolling me, distributing jalebis, putting up posters against me, I wish the same efforts were put to fight pollution and to make the city breathable,” he said.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <u>VERDICT</u>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Times Fact Check has found that a small portion of Gambhir’s entire quote to ANI is being circulated to falsely claim that he prioritizes commentary over attending pollution-related meetings.</p>
