      <p>MANDURAH detectives claim a Lakelands man exposed a 14-year-old girl to explicit material on a social media platform and also tried to entice two children to go with him at a Meadow Springs park.</p>
      <p>Police said there were reports from parents and students of the man approaching children in a blue utility in Lakelands on Thursday, November 11. The suspicious behaviour was reported around Yindanna Boulevard and on Albina Chase.</p>
      <p>Then on Friday, police allege he approached two young girls, aged 11 and 12, outside the toilet block area at Quarry Adventure Park, on Pebble Beach Boulevard.</p>
      <p>Police allege he got within three metres of the girls and removed a small note from his pocket on which he had written a message “come with me if you want more”, with a dollar coin attached by sticky tape.</p>
      <p>He allegedly dropped the note, coin and opened a condom packet in front of the two girls before walking in the bush area and behind a tree.</p>
      <p>After reading the note the girls left the area and advised their parents who contacted police.</p>
      <p>Police and officers from the Child Exploitation Team searched the man’s house on Monday and he was charged with trying to procure, incite, encourage a child under 13-years to do an indecent act.</p>
      <p>Acting Superintendent Dean Snashall said the two girls at the Meadow Springs park conducted themselves very well under the circumstances, immediately dropped the note, ran from the area and told their parents.</p>
      <p>“It’s important for parents that we talk to our children about their personal safety,” he said.</p>
      <p>“These children were able to identify that it was a risky situation and immediately left the area.”</p>
      <p>Acting Supt Snashall encouraged children to stay in groups, because there was safety in numbers.</p>
      <p>The investigation is ongoing and detectives urge anyone who knows of any similar approaches made to children in the last few weeks in the Lakelands and Meadow Springs area to contact police.</p>
