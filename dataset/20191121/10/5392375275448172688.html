      <p>A few days after the release of Android for <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/pixel/">Pixel</a> devices, <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/oneplus">OnePlus</a> managed to bring the same to its OnePlus 7 lineup upping its software game. Since then, the Chinese smartphone maker is offering timely regular updates to its Open Beta program. Earlier today, the smartphone started rolling out the new OxygenOS Open Beta 6 update to its OnePlus 7 and <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/10/10/oneplus-7t-pro-and-7t-pro-mclaren-officially-announced/">OnePlus 7T Pro</a> devices. The all-new update brings the latest security patch along with various improvements and additions to the overall software experience. You can find the changelog as well as the detailed information in this article.</p>
      <h3>OnePlus 7, 7T Pro OxygenOS Open Beta 6 Update</h3>
      <p>The all-new OxygenOS beta update brings the latest November Android security patch along with the ability to disable <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/09/02/oneplus-zen-mode-app-is-now-available-on-the-play-store/">Zen mode</a>. For those who’re unaware, Zen Mode is the company’s new feature which when enabled puts your device into the deep freeze for about 20 minutes. During this time, you can’t do anything on your smartphone except making &amp; receiving calls and clicking photos. Although the feature seems interesting and useful for those who’re trying to cut down their phone usage, there’s still a problem with it. Once turned on, there’s no going back meaning you’ll have to wait for 20 minutes to use the phone again. Well, OnePlus has finally introduced the disable option in the latest beta update.</p>
      <p>The update also fixes various bugs such as fingerprint animation, visibility of fingerprint icon and various other improvements. For OnePlus 7, the update brings the notch area display option in the settings menu. Since this is the beta update, you can encounter with numerous bugs and potential risks on your smartphone. Furthermore, if you’re not already on the beta build, you will not get the update whatsoever.</p>
