      <p>Col Katlego Mogale confirmed that two of these suspects were arrested in the Lowveld.</p>
      <p>“In a continuous effort to root out malfeasance in government, the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (DPCI) has arrested ten suspects aged between 34 and 60 in the early hours of today.”</p>

      <p>The operation follows a complaint by the National Treasury after it transpired that the suspects allegedly colluded in accessing the Amathole District Municipality funds through flaunting of procurement processes.  Afterwards they were awarded a contract for ventilated improved toilets in the Eastern Cape.</p>
      <p>The Hawks’ preliminary investigation discovered that over R600 million was to be awarded for the contract, of which R286 million has already been paid to the suspects.</p>
      <blockquote>“All ten suspects will appear in the East London Magistrate’s court on 22 November, on charges of fraud, corruption and money laundering in terms of the Prevention of Organised Crime Act (POCA).”</blockquote>
      <p>The Asset Forfeiture processes are already underway. The outstanding collaboration with the office of the Director Public Prosecutions in the Eastern Cape made it possible for the case to proceed.</p>

      <p>The Acting National Head of the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation,  Lt Gen Yolisa Matakata , applauded the team for the arrests.</p>
      <p>“This development is most welcome in our greater fight against corruption to ensure to ensure that clean and credible governance prevails. We will stop at nothing to ensure that corrupt perpetrators, be it in the private sector or government are brought to book,” she said.</p>
