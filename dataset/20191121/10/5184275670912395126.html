      <p>Sandhya’s Makeover, the artist who helped Ranu Mondal get ready for the event, took to social media to reveal what Ranu’s makeup actually looked like. Sandhya wrote, “As you can see, this is the difference between the work that we have done and the ‘Fake’ picture that has been edited to an extent. All the jokes and trolls are fine and they make us laugh too but to hurt someone sentiments, that’s not a very good thing to do.”</p>

      <p>Ever since her talent’s discovery, Ranu Mondal has been in the limelight for something or the other. Recently, she came in the news for misbehaving with a fan who asked for a selfie. The netizens were quite upset with her behaviour and backlashed the sensational singer with harsh comments. Himesh Reshammiya had to intervene and defend Ranu for what she did.</p>
      <p>On the work front, Himesh just released the first song from his film <i>Happy Hardy And Heer</i> titled <i>Aashiqui Mein Teri 2.0</i> which is sung by Ranu and him.</p>
