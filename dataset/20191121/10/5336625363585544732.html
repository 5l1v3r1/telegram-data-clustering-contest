      <p>Dolly Parton once <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/interviews/dolly-parton-interview-dont-do-politics-else-fails-just-tell/">said</a>, "When all else fails, I just do a boob joke."</p>
      <p>And that's precisely what she did when she came on <i>The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon.</i> </p>
      <p>Ever the storyteller, Parton asked if she could tell Fallon a story. The yarn that ensued was about a man who scammed her while she was out eating food with her family. </p>
      <p>"We were in the restaurant, we were having our meal and this old man came over to our table," Parton began. After the man left, Parton went up to pay the bill and a man said, "Your grandpa left his bill here too." </p>
      <p>"So that old man had come over and kind of scammed us," she added. Parton paid the man's bill but the story didn't end there. As she was walking down the street, she spotted the man and confronted him. But when she did so, he began hitting her on the chest with his walking stick. </p>
      <p>When Fallon asked, what happened, Parton replied, "What do you mean, what happened? These two big lumps came up and they never did go down."</p>
      <p>She fooled us all. </p>
