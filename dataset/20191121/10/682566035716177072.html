      <p>Cape Town - A football mad fan designed a beautiful <b>Kaizer Chiefs</b> home, away and alternative kit for the 2020/21 season.</p>
      <p>Jay Chez has shared three diverse looking kits on social media and received raving reviews from Amakhosi fans. </p>
      <p><b><i>"This is my Kaizer Chiefs jersey designs idea for next season. Please rate out 10 and help,"</i></b> Chez said via a Twitter post.</p>
      <p>However, Chez has reassured followers that the designs are not the official kits for next season but a mere appreciation for the Soweto giants.</p>
      <p>
        <i>
          <b>"This are not official kaizer Chiefs jerseys they are just design ideas from a KCFC fan."</b>
        </i>
      </p>
      <p>Amakhosi have been beaming in the Absa Premiership with a 10-point gap at the top of the log standings and are one match away from a Telkom Knockout (TKO) final.</p>
      <p>The Soweto giants have thus far accumulated <b>28-points </b>from 11 games - <b>9</b> wins, <b>1</b> loss and <b>1</b> draw - while current champions Mamelodi Sundowns are in second place (18-points) with a match in hand.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, the Glamour Boys take on a plucky Maritzburg United at the Mbombela Stadium while the Brazilians host Steve Komphela's Golden Arrows in the TKO semi-final.</p>
      <p>Kick-off for both matches are at 15:00.</p>
