      <p>A Wishaw bingo worker proved she had the balls to take on a charity skydive.</p>
      <p>Belinda Holmes pulled on a parachute and jumped feet first out of a plane 10,000ft in the sky, to raise more than £1,600 for Carers Trust.</p>
      <p>Belinda, who was gifted the skydiving experience by her daughter as a 50th birthday present, made the decision to use the daunting day-out as a way to raise money for the Carers Trust.</p>
      <p>The Carers Trust are the official charity partner of Mecca Bingo and all funds and charity donations always go to the organisation.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>After spending several weeks organising lucky dips and book clubs collecting donations at Mecca Bingo Wishaw, Belinda raised the sum of £1,655.</p>
      <p>Carers Trust improves support, services and recognition for unpaid carers.</p>
      <p>They work with local partners to support carers in their homes through the provision of replacement care, and in the community with information, advice, emotional support, hands on practical help and access to much needed breaks.</p>
      <p>Mecca Bingo clubs have raised over £2 million nationwide for Carers Trust.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Office controller Belinda said: “I’m so glad I finally got to do the skydive, it was absolutely the best thing I have ever done in my life.</p>
      <p>“It was a 50th birthday gift from my daughter so I thought I would combine the experience and do the jump whilst raising money for the Carers Trust.</p>
      <p>“I had a bucket at the book sale counter with my skydive details and all of our customers were so generous, donating all their loose change.”</p>
      <p>Billy Macleod, general manager, said: “What a fantastic way to raise money for such a great cause, Belinda is a superstar and it’s been a joy supporting her fundraising in club.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“As always, our customers have been wonderfully generous and Belinda has raised a great donation for Carers Trust”</p>
      <p>Contributions are still being collected at Mecca Bingo Wishaw until November 30 for anyone wishing to donate – https//ukvirginmoneygiving.com/belindaholmes2</p>
