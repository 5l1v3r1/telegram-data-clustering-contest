      <p><a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/final_fantasy_xiv_online_a_realm_reborn">Final Fantasy XIV Online</a> was always going to be playable on PlayStation 5 thanks to backwards compatibility, but it looks like the team at Square Enix has even bigger plans for what is currently the most popular MMO on the market. A fan gathering for the game was held in London last night, where director Naoki Yoshida supposedly got on stage to officially announce that Final Fantasy XIV Online is in development for Sony's next-gen console.</p>
      <p>At the time of writing, the only proof we have of this actually occurring comes from the <a href="https://twitter.com/FFUKFans/status/1197254733716770821">Final Fantasy UK Fans Twitter account</a>. A profile not run by the company in question, but we find it rather hard to believe that a group of dedicated followers would simply make something like this up. This remains a rumour until we get official confirmation from Square Enix. However, it does look like MMO players will have something to look forward to playing late next year on their new piece of hardware.</p>

      <p>Although, you probably shouldn't expect any sort of port announcement in the near future. We assume Sony will want to get its own console reveal out of the way in early 2020 before it allows publishers to casually reveal new titles, remasters, and ports heading to the PS5.</p>
      <p>Nonetheless, would you be interested in playing Final Fantasy XIV Online on PS5? Role-play in the comments below.</p>
