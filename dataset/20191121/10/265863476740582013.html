      <h1>Notorious B.I.G Is Seen In Newly-Published Video Working On This Iconic Song As Odd Rumors About His Romance With Faith Evans Go Viral</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T10:27:25+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 10:27</time> by <a rel="author">Mel Walker</a></address>
      <p>Fans are getting a rare glimpse into the way Notorious B.I.G, better known as Biggie, dropped his iconic rhymes while in the studio.</p>
      <p>Thanks to Funkmaster Flex, a video has surfaced online where the late legendary rapper Christopher George Latore Wallace can be seen doing what he did best — take over the mic and impress the people around him.</p>
      <p>In the footage, Notorious B.I.G is recording the bars for his iconic single “Hypnotize” in 1996 — the song was released the following year on his <i>Life After Death</i> album.</p>
      <p>One fan had this reaction: “I can image if Biggie was alive today with Instagram.”</p>
      <p>Another commenter stated: “Watching this just hit my heart strings. The best to ever do it 💪🏾.”</p>
      <p>This backer wrote: “Best rapper eve what one say biggie etha king of rap hip hop foreva. That studio life is the bestv….it a safe haven for eralot of ppl including me.”</p>

      <p>The death of iconic rapper Notorious B.I.G is well into the past of hip-hop, and yet many fans of the music continue to mourn and pay respects to this very day.</p>
      <p>And to nobody’s surprise, Biggie is still surrounded by various rumors regarding his death, some of which have been going into uncomfortable details about his private life.</p>
      <p>Just recently, new claims that Faith Evans may have been in a relationship with Notorious B.I.G at the time of the rapper’s death, even though this was never publicized until now.</p>
      <p>The situation between them is still far from clear, as their relationship and subsequent marriage were very turbulent, and drew many questions from people looking from the side.</p>
      <p>Evans has never hidden the fact that she was head over heels for Notorious, and she claims that she actually fell in love as soon as the two met, alluding to the classic love at first sight scenario.</p>
      <p>And while it is not clear whether they were actually still together when Biggie passed, this has not stopped many of the rapper’s fans from discussing the possibility actively.</p>
      <p>Some are still convinced that Biggie’s death was a major conspiracy in the first place, and it will probably be hard to shake off those ideas from the minds of those who have them.</p>
      <p>However, in the end, it is far from the only case of a major celebrity being surrounded by similar speculation after they have passed.</p>
