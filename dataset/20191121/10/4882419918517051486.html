      <h2>The Catalan coach has released a short statement following his departure from the job</h2>

      <p>Robert Moreno has broken his silence after being replaced by Luis Enrique as Spain coach this week.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Here is his statement:</b>
      </p>
      <p>"After what happened this week and following the agreement reached on Tuesday, I feel the need to release a statement in gratitude for the support I have received during these months and to say goodbye to my role as national team coach.</p>
      <p>"In an extreme situation, it fell on me to take over the team. The objective that I was assigned of qualifying for Euro 2020 has been fulfilled. I wish this would never have been the situation. We would still have qualified all the same.</p>
      <p>"To evaluate my final hours in the job or even the final days would only serve to enter into a spiral of criticism and justification for all parties. I am not going to do that. I don't see any sense in it.</p>
      <p>"My conscience is clear. It's impossible to please everyone, but I tell you sincerely that I respect everyone and every opinion. I have always maintained that I am a man of my word, that I would not be an obstruction in the case that Luis Enrique decided to return. I have followed through with that, even though it's led to my departure. I wish him the best because his happiness will be ours.</p>
      <p>"Thank you to all the players for their dedication and commitment. I have tried to be fair, honest and direct with them. I wanted to help them develop on the pitch in the best way possible.</p>
      <p>"I want to highlight that it would not have been possible to do the job without Luis Enrique, Rafel, Joaquin and Jesus. I don't lose colleagues, I leave behind friends. Without forgetting the assistants and all the important people in the team that never get sufficient recognition.</p>
      <p>"I have felt affection from the fans and I can only say thank you for that. Thanks to the 100s of people who have come up to me to encourage me and congratulate me. I will always carry you in my heart.</p>
      <p>I am grateful to the members of the Royal Spanish Football Federation for the treatment received during my time with the national team. I have felt loved and respected.</p>
      <p>"And finally a special mention for the media for the treatment at all times. You have been very sharp in all press conferences. I have tried to be respectful with everyone and attend everyone the same while trying to be friendly and honest.</p>
      <p>"I hope you assess me for what I have done, not who I am. That's what I have tried to do with the players in each squad. I don't want to stop apologising for those who feel offended that I didn't give a final press conference. The circumstances prevented it.</p>
      <p>"My experience as the national team manager started and has ended in the someway, with a bittersweet taste. It's time to look to the future and to tackle new challenges as a coach working in my passion, football. I am ready for the challenge of leading new projects."</p>
