      <h1>Shenmue 3 review roundup – here are all the scores</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T10:19:30+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 10:19</time> by <a rel="author">Oscar Dayus</a></address>

        <b><a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/shenmue-3">Shenmue 3</a> is finally here, after a wait spanning almost two decades. The threequel has been a long time coming, but it’s finally out on PC and PlayStation 4.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Even since the new title was announced, it has been a long road to release. The reveal came way back at E3 2015, though development – and an accompanying Kickstarter campaign – was only just beginning. With $6.3 million raised through the crowdfunding platform, Shenmue 3 became the best-funded videogame Kickstarter project ever.</p>
      <p>The game has also attracted controversy after it was initially said to be available on <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/shenmue-3/steam-keys">Steam</a>, before Epic snagged it as an exclusive on PC for the first year. The question remains, however: is Shenmue 3 any good?</p>
      <p>Luckily, after more controversy surrounding <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/shenmue-3/review">Shenmue 3’s review embargo</a>, critics’ verdicts are beginning to go live. Some state it’s what the fans have been waiting for all this time, while others say the series’ loyal followers deserve better.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>We’ll continue to update this list with more reviews as they go live.</p>
      <p>Even though Shenmue 3 has only just launched, director <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/shenmue-3/shenmue-4">Yu Suzuki has already said he wants to make Shenmue 4</a>. Here’s hoping we get that a little quicker than Shenmue 3.</p>
