      <h1>Cleland man Millar Jukes is making waves down under with his new music project</h1>
      <h2>Millar, 32, has just released his latest single 'Don't Worry' on all major platforms.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T10:12:20+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 10:12</time> by <a rel="author">Gregor Farquharson, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/gregor-farquharson/</a></address>
      <p>An ex-Coltness High pupil has been making waves down under with his new music project.</p>
      <p>Millar Jukes, 32, moved to Australia in 2011 with his ex-girlfriend and has stayed there ever since.</p>
      <p>He has just released his latest single “Don’t Worry” onto all major platforms, a song inspired by a conversation with his mum.</p>
      <p>He said: “I was back home a wee while ago and everything in my life was just not going well.</p>
      <p>“My girlfriend had broken up with me, I had lost my job and flat. It all just seemed to be going downhill.</p>
      <p>“I was at home with my mum and she was watching Frasier and I was complaining and she turned the sound down, looked me in the eye and basically just said 'Don’t worry about things you can’t change'.</p>
      <p>“That’s where the inspiration comes from, my mum.”</p>
      <p>Millar is from a musical family, with his brothers Stevie and Al in the popular band <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/wishaw-brothers-saint-phnx-headline-20912989">Saint PHNX</a> .</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“I was quite late to the whole music thing, later than my brothers for sure,” said Millar.</p>
      <p>“I learned guitar on a year I took out travelling and I’ve been playing since.</p>
      <p>“Stevie told me I couldn’t sing so I went and got lessons and wrote some songs and released my EP five years ago.</p>
      <p>“My brothers helped me a lot. They always seem to be on tour now but I speak to them every few weeks.</p>
      <p>“I’ve been trying to get them to come out here and play, I think that would be amazing.”</p>
      <p>Despite being out in Australia, Millar still remains very much a Wishaw man, with his accent as strong as when he left.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>He added: “Wishaw made me who I am. I do miss certain things, like the banter and the chat and even the Scottish music scene, which is booming.</p>
      <p>“I know I’ll stay over here forever now, I love it, but I enjoy coming home every so often and seeing my family.</p>
      <p>“Last time I played in Scotland was at the Vigo Thieves final gig in Broadcast, Glasgow, and it was one of the best gigs I’ve ever played.</p>
      <p>“I’d love to play my own show there in the future.”</p>
      <p>You can keep up to date with what Millar is up to on Facebook and Twitter and stream his new single on all major platforms.</p>
