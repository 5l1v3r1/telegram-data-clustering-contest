      <p>The Haven in Wolverhampton is running a number of initiatives to help raise vital funds and spread festive cheer.</p>
      <p>Firstly it is appealing for donations as part of the Big Give scheme to help fund its range of therapeutic services which help women and children the short and long-term effects of domestic abuse.</p>
      <p>Contributions are doubled if they are made through the Big Give website from 12pm on December 3 to 10.</p>

      <p>The charity also wants to provide all of the women and children in its refuges with a Christmas dinner with all the trimmings.</p>
      <p>It is appealing for supermarket vouchers or cash donations towards food.</p>
      <p>The Haven is also encouraging schools and offices to host a Christmas jumper day in lieu of sending cards to colleagues.</p>
      <p>Groups can request a free giant Christmas card poster to display at their event with space to add a festive message to their friends or colleagues.</p>
      <h3>Designed</h3>
      <p>But people who would like to send Christmas cards can still support the charity by purchasing its own specially designed packs.</p>
      <p>A six-year-old boy in one of the refuges has designed a Christmas card this year and they cost Â£3.50 for a pack of 10.</p>
      <p>Finally, the charity is grateful for donations of new toys and gifts and new single bedding sets for children.</p>
      <p>People are asked to donate them unwrapped so women and children can choose and wrap gifts themselves for an extra personal touch.</p>
      <p>Fundraiser manager Jade Secker said: "Everyone at The Haven is so grateful to all of those in the community that go above and beyond to help us make Christmas a little brighter for those who have fled domestic abuse.</p>
      <p>"Christmas is supposed to be a time for family festivities and positive memories, however, this can be a really difficult time of year for those who are supported by The Haven.</p>
      <p>"There are lots of ways that people can help us to make Christmas special, and we hope as many people as possible will help us create the all-round experience that the women and children we support truly deserve."</p>
      <p>To find out more call the charity on 01902 904 677 ext 3000 or email give@havenrefuge.org.uk</p>
