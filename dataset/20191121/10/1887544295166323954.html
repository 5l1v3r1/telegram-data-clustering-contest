      <p>OTTAWA - Gov. Gen. Julie Payette is honouring 39 people with the Order of Canada this morning, including actor William Shatner, writer Ann-Marie MacDonald and lawyer James Lockyer.</p>
      <p>Shatner is being given one of Canada's highest civilian honours for his 60-year career in theatre, television and film; MacDonald for her art and advocacy for women and on LGBTQ issues; and Lockyer for his work championing people wrongly convicted of crimes.</p>

      <p>Payette will preside over the ceremony at Rideau Hall in Ottawa.</p>
      <p>The order was established in 1967, Canada's centennial year.</p>
      <p>Close to 7,500 people have been invested in the order since then.</p>
