      <p><a href="https://www.mamamia.com.au/the-brady-bunch-facts/"><i>The Brady Bunch</i></a> will always be remembered for being wholesome family television at its best. Groundbreaking at the time, the sitcom followed a blended family of three sons and three daughters and ran for five seasons. Its theme song and opening credits are, <i>well</i>, iconic.</p>
      <p>This week, several original cast members reunited for <a href="https://www.hgtv.com/shows/a-very-brady-renovation"><i>A Very Brady Renovation</i></a>, a TV show that sees Barry Williams (Greg Brady), Maureen McCormick (Marcia), Christopher Knight (Peter), Eve Plumb (Jan), Mike Lookinland (Bobby), and Susan Olsen (Cindy) come together to renovate the original Brady Bunch house.</p>
      <p>If you can believe it, it’s actually been 50 years since we originally welcomed the Brady family – Mike, Carol, Alice, Marcia, Jan, Cindy, Greg, Peter and Bobby – into our living rooms.</p>
      <p>Here’s where <a href="https://www.mamamia.com.au/the-brady-bunch-facts/">the original cast of <i>The Brady Bunch</i></a> are in 2019.</p>
