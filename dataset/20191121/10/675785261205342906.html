      <h2>Countdown presenter Rachel Riley, who is heavily pregnant with her first child, has been slammed for sharing a picture of herself wearing a photoshopped top calling Jeremy Corbyn a racist</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T10:31:42+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 10:31</time> by <a rel="author">Emmeline Saunders</a></address>
      <p>Rachel Riley faces calls to be fired from her job at Countdown after sharing a snap of herself wearing a top with a photoshopped messages branding Labour leader <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jeremy-corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a> a racist.</p>
      <p>The heavily pregnant TV presenter wore a white t-shirt with an historic picture of the Labour leader being arrested while protesting apartheid in South Africa.</p>
      <p>The original photo, taken in 1984, saw Mr Corbyn hold up a placard with the words, "Defend the right to protest against apartheid. Join this picket", which he continues to hold as he's led away by two police officers.</p>
      <p>However, the sign on Rachel's top had been doctored to show the words: "Jeremy Corbyn is a racist endeavour."</p>

      <p>Rachel, who is expecting her first child with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/strictly-come-dancing">Strictly Come Dancing</a> husband Pasha Kovalev, shared the image on her <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> , writing next to it: "I didn't feel comfortable knowing my workplace was to be full of racists tonight. I don't endorse Boris, but I do endorse #NeverCorbyn.</p>
      <p>"Please see my pinned thread if you still don't understand why. #LeadersDebate #LabourAntisemitism."</p>
      <p>But her tweets sparked outrage among voters, with one Corbyn supporter tweeting: "Jeremy Corbyn spent the 80s campaigning against Apartheid &amp; fighting for the rights of working people. <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> spent it burning money in front of homeless people &amp; smashing up restaurants for fun. Learn your history Rachel Riley!"</p>

      <p>Another said: "Rachel Riley should apologise for the hurt and upset that she has caused to many whose families and loved ones suffered under the Apartheid regime! The disrespect and lack of care shown to the Anti-Apartheid struggle is truly hurtful."</p>
      <p>And a third wrote: "Black Twitter has got to be all over Rachel Riley for this latest stunt. Everyone has their views on Jeremy Corbyn. But editing an anti South African apartheid image from the 80s is vile and is a perfect example of White privilege. <a href="https://twitter.com/Channel4News">@Channel4News</a> when will C4 get rid of her?"</p>

      <p>Last October, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/nelson-mandelas-grandson-what-jeremy-13433774">Nelson Mandela's grandson</a> , Chief Mandla Mandela, endorsed Mr Corbyn after praising the Labour leader's campaigning efforts in the 1980s to fight against the deeply racist apatheid.</p>
      <p>"The British government did nothing for the liberation of South Africa. Yet the British citizens did a lot, particularly for the Anti-Apartheid Campaign â€“ and people like Jeremy Corbyn were right in the forefront of that," he told the Mirror.</p>
      <p>"We applaud them and we continue to pledge our support for them."</p>
