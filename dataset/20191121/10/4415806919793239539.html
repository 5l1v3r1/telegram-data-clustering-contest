      <p>Three-year-old Zac Higgins, who was seriously injured in a hit-and-run earlier this year, will open Cork on Ice this Friday, November 22 at the ice rink on Centre Park Road.</p>
      <p>The annual event will be officially opened at 3pm by the toddler, who has been recovering from his injuries since the accident in March.</p>
      <p>Zac was struck by a vehicle at Castle Meadows on the Skehard Road on Monday, March 25. He suffered from a serious brain injury and had to re-learn how to walk and talk.</p>
      <p>However, the toddler has been recovering well with support from his family.</p>
      <p>"We’re really looking forward to Zac’s big moment on Friday as he officially opens Cork on Ice," said Paul, Zac's dad.</p>

      <p>Paul also thanked Corkonians for their continued support of the family: "The support for Zac and our family from the people of Cork this year has been overwhelming and it really has meant so much."</p>
      <p>Commenting on the opening, Bill Cremin, Managing Director of Cool Running Events, said, "Zac’s bravery and strength is remarkable and we’re delighted that Zac and his family can join us to officially open Cork on Ice on Friday.</p>
      <p>"It’s unimaginable what Zac and his family had to go through this year and we wanted to do something special to show our support and celebrate little Zac."</p>
