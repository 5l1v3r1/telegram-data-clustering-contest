      <h1>Shunsuke Nakamura and the iconic Celtic moment that sparked the most ferocious Fergie hairdryer in history</h1>
      <h2>Thirteen years ago to the day, the Japanese star scored one of his iconic goals - here's how it all happened.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T10:49:03+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 10:49</time> by <a rel="author">Liam Bryce, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/liam-bryce/</a></address>
      <p>There's an angle from which you're left wondering just how it happened.</p>
      <p>The camera low to the ground, the ball skewing off high to the left, looking destined for Row Z.</p>
      <p>"Why are those faces in the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> so contorted with shock and fear? It's not going anywhere."</p>
      <p>But then it did.</p>
      <p>By some power that only Shunsuke Nakamura and a few select others can harness, it swerves and dips into the top corner, leaving all 6ft5 of Edwin van der Sar flailing hopelessly at the Glasgow night air.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/gordon-strachan">Gordon Strachan</a> , perhaps thinking it's too far from goal for even the Japanese, leans casually against the dugout.</p>
      <p>As it crashed into the back of the net, there's an almost awkward hop, skip and a jump from the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> manager, he and 60,000 others not quite sure what to do with themselves.</p>

      <p>United, who would go on to win the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/champions-league">Champions League</a> the following season, were floored. Celtic, meanwhile, were in the knockout stage.</p>
      <p>It mattered not that Louis Saha was gifted a chance to level from the spot with nine minutes remaining, he and his team-mates looked punch drunk, overwhelmed by the earthquake that followed the most stunning of goals.</p>
      <p>Watching on from the other end of the pitch, Gary Neville predicted Saha would fail and, watching it back 13 years to the day, was there ever a man who looked so certain to miss?</p>
      <p>Saha admitted this week he'd been angered by Neville's lack of faith, which had made its way into the next day's papers.</p>
      <p>Sorry Louis, but the man had a point.</p>
      <p>Minutes before the spot-kick the Frenchman bore down on goal, before inexplicably appearing to believe he'd been flagged offside, surrendering an opportunity to level.</p>
      <p>By the time he stepped up to take the penalty, Saha's head had quite clearly gone.</p>

      <p>Artur Boruc's save and the final whistle that followed gave away to the one of the most sustained roars ever witnessed at Celtic Park.</p>
      <p>It was the sort of titanic night, defeating a truly elite side, that has become a rarity in years since, the financial gap between the top tier and the rest stretching far into the horizon.</p>
      <p>As much as its significance hasn't dulled with age, there was a real sense at the time Celtic had achieved something special.</p>
      <p>This was a United side still helmed by Sir Alex Ferguson and would go on, in the next three years, to become perhaps the last truly great team he ever constructed.</p>
      <p>Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes, Wayne Rooney, Rio Ferdinand and a certain Cristiano Ronaldo who was only just beginning to harness the extent of his talents.</p>
      <p>All were left stunned by a Celtic side who had fought their way to an earth-shattering result.</p>
      <p>Neville dragged Saha away by his collar after the shell-shocked striker planted himself on the Parkhead turf, but the worst was yet to come.</p>

      <p>Years later Rooney recalled the mother of all Ferguson hairdryers being dished out in the bowels of Celtic Park.</p>
      <p>No prizes for guessing who bore the brunt.</p>
      <p>"In the dressing room, the manager lets loose.</p>
      <p>"It’s the worst hairdryer I’ve seen. He’s in Louis’ face, shouting and screaming. But Louis isn’t the only one getting an earful.</p>
      <p>“The manager knows I’ve been negotiating a new deal with the club and he saves some for me.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“Players wanting more money from the club and new deals… you don’t deserve anything after that performance!</p>
      <p>“He doesn’t look my way but I know where he’s aiming the comments. I don’t like it, but he’s right.</p>
      <p>“After that performance, I don’t deserve an improved contract and there’s nothing worse than getting the hairdryer from Sir Alex.</p>
      <p>“When it happens, the manager stands in the middle of the room and loses it at me.”</p>
      <p>Forty-five minutes earlier, in the home dressing room next door, Strachan had told his players they'd either be remembered for a first-half during which United should have sewn the game up, or the forty-five to come.</p>
      <p>It's fair to say they responded.</p>
