      <h1>Inducing labour at 41 weeks could save lives, new research claims</h1>

      <p>Pregnant women should be induced earlier to reduce baby deaths, a new study has found, as researchers call for the end of a ‘wait and see’ approach.</p>
      <p>The study, done in conjunction with hospitals and academics across Sweden, concluded that pregnant women should not be offered induction later than 41 weeks.</p>
      <p>During the course of the trial which involved almost 3,000 women between 2016 and 2018, six babies died after labour was induced at or beyond 42 weeks of pregnancy.</p>
      <p>For those induced at 41 weeks, there were no deaths of the babies.</p>
      <p>The research, published in the British Medical Journal, estimated that, for every 230 women induced at 41 weeks, one baby’s death would be prevented.</p>
      <p>Dr Kasia Maksym, UCL EGA Institute for Women’s Health, UCL, said: “This is a very important piece of research. </p>
      <p>“However it was stopped for the reason, the very reason this study was designed for – to answer the question: which management is the safest in prolonged pregnancy. </p>
      <p>“The result is not unexpected.  The message is clear: there is an intervention, which can reduce risk of perinatal mortality in prolonged pregnancy, without additional risk for mother and baby.”</p>
      <p>Last month the study was abruptly cancelled after six babies died over the period of the trial.</p>
      <p>This came after the researchers concluded that “it would not have been ethically correct to proceed.”</p>
      <p>Dr Sarah Stock, from the Centre for Reproductive Health, University of Edinburgh, said:</p>
      <p>“This study adds to the growing body of evidence that induction of labour, at or beyond term gestation, is safer for babies, without increasing caesarean section or other complications for mothers.</p>
      <p>“This carefully conducted Swedish study suggests that offering pregnant women induction of labour at 41 weeks gestation, rather than waiting until 42 weeks gestation, could reduce baby deaths.”</p>
      <p>Current UK guidance recommends that induction of labour should be offered to women with uncomplicated pregnancies who go beyond 41 weeks to avoid the risks of prolonged pregnancy, including stillbirth.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for the British Pregnancy Advice Service said: “It’s estimated that for every 230 women induced at 41 weeks, one perinatal death would be prevented, and as they stress, induction may therefore be one of the few interventions that can reduce stillbirth. </p>
      <p>“Women may have their own reasons for wanting to avoid induction and take a wait and see approach which need to be explored - and ultimately of course respected.”</p>
