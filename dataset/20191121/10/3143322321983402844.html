      <p>MBOMBELA – Snakebite season has arrived with the searing heat Lowvelders are accustomed to. The area is home to half the national snake population. This means that Lowvelders in particular, need to know which species are the most prevalent and which pose the greatest threat to people.</p>
      <p>The puff adder, Mozambique spitting cobra, snouted cobra (Egyptian cobra), black mamba, vine snake, southern stiletto snake, boomslang and rhombic night adder are the species which abound in the Lowveld. Knowing how to deal with these snakes and who to contact in case of a bite, should be top of mind for all Lowvelders.</p>

      <p>At least 600, 000 people are killed worldwide or permanently disable every year as a result of snakebites. The dangers are more so for workers in foreign shores. Remote Medical International and the Asclepius Snakebite Foundation have developed proven management and response strategies for the threat of snakebites.</p>
      <p>According to their report, dealing with snakebites effectively cannot just be about limiting the impact on working hours but must also be about saving lives. The safety threat presented by snakes is very real as is the impact on workforce morale and efficiency.</p>

      <p>Implementing a strong safety system and education is a proven tool which helps workers avoid snakebites, along with a strategy to effectively deal with snakebites is also required. If there are dangerous snakes in any location, a clear treatment programme will help in saving lives, preventing permanent disability and add peace of mind for the workers.</p>
      <p>Time is essential with snakebites, In all cases, administering the antivenom early means a reduction in the loss of life or limbs. The first minutes and hours are key to saving the patient. Irrespective of whether it is neurotoxic, cytotoxic or hemotoxic, a fast response can mean the difference between life and death. In all cases, the solution is the right dose of the right antivenom.</p>
