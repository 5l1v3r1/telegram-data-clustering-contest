      <p>Lucas Torreira insists he is fully focused on playing for <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/arsenal-fc/">Arsenal</a> amid rumours linking him with a move away, though admitted he will ‘see what happens’ in the future.</p>
      <p>The Uruguayan midfielder, who arrived from Sampdoria last summer, has only started four of Arsenal’s 12 <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/premier-league/">Premier League</a> matches this season and has been given a different role by manager <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/unai-emery/">Unai Emery</a>.</p>
      <p>His agent, Pablo Bentancur, suggested that the change – pushing Torreira further forward into a more advanced role – had <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/lucas-torreiras-agent-responds-rumours-wants-leave-arsenal-unai-emery-11177689/">‘hurt’ the midfielder</a> and made him feel ‘no longer at ease’.</p>

      <p>Serie A giants AC Milan are reportedly keen to bring him back to Italy, while Atletico Madrid manager Diego Simeone has also been credited with interest.</p>
      <p>But Torreira says he is not letting the speculation surrounding his future affect him, though opened the possibility of revisiting a potential move when the window reopens.</p>

      <p>Asked about the interest from Atletico, he told Uruguayan radio station <a href="http://www.sport890.com.uy/2019/11/20/lucas-torreira-no-puedo-hablar-de-otro-equipo-ahora-en-el-periodo-de-pases-se-vera/">Sport 890</a>: ‘Today Arsenal needs me to be focused. I can’t start talking about another team.</p>
      <p>‘I need to be focused and when the transfer window arrives we will see what will happen.’</p>
      <p>He added: ‘I don’t know what can happen in the future. But I wish I could play in Boca. It’s a dream that I have for what that institution represents.’</p>

      <p>Torreira returned to his usual defensive midfield role for Uruguay against Argentina during the international break, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/lucas-torreira-proves-arsenal-manager-unai-emery-wrong-superb-defensive-midfield-display-uruguay-11179492/">giving an excellent display</a> that created more questions over how Emery has used him this season.</p>
      <p>Asked about Torreira’s future, Bentancur told <i>Calciomercato</i>: ‘We have no problem with Arsenal, only words of thanks. They allowed Lucas to compete in the Premier League, he has always shown great confidence.</p>
      <p>‘Clearly, there is interest for Torreira, especially from Spanish clubs. However, I have never sat down with any club to talk about a transfer. This is because of the great respect we have for the Gunners and their general manager Raul Sanllhei.’</p>
