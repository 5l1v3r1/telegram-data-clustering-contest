        <b>Set Piece returned to winning ways in a thrilling finish to the British Stallion Studs EBF Hyde Stakes at Kempton.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Listed event looked sure to go the way of 5-6 favourite Khuzaam, who was quickly into his stride and at the head of affairs under Jim Crowley, holding a clear advantage with a furlong to travel.</p>
      <p>But James Doyle had been getting to work on Hugo Palmer's Set Piece from two and a half furlongs out and he fairly rattled home to grab the Roger Varian-trained market leader on the line, scoring by a short head at 16-1.</p>
      <p>Accidental Agent - winner of the Queen Anne at Royal Ascot last year - was another to finish strongly in third.</p>
      <p>It was a second success from two outings over the course and distance for the son of Dansili, who triumphed first time out as a two-year-old and was in action for the first time since undergoing wind and gelding operations.</p>
      <p>As the race was a Fast-Track Qualifier the winner secured a spot on All-Weather Championship Finals Day on Good Friday at Lingfield.</p>
      <p>Palmer said: "Set Piece is a horse I have always adored, but it has not been plain sailing with him.</p>
      <p>"We had to top and tail him during the summer to help him out and it seems to have made a real difference.</p>
      <p>"James was very pleased with him, particularly with the turn of foot he showed. I think he is a progressive, exciting horse and it is great to get him back on track.</p>
      <p>"He has won three races from six starts, and is now a Listed winner having been Group Three-placed earlier in the year.</p>
      <p>"There are a whole number of options open to him now and which route he takes will be down to Prince Khalid (Abdullah, owner) and his family."</p>
