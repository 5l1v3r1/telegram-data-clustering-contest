        <b>Liverpool’s interest in Trabzonspor goalkeeper Ugurcan Cakir has been confirmed by the player’s agent.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 23-year-old only established himself as number one choice for the Turkish side midway through last season, but has done enough to catch the eye of sides across Europe.</p>
      <p>Cakir has picked up two caps for Turkey, making his international debut in May, but is yet to displace Mert Gunok as the first choice in the national team.</p>
      <p>Despite this relative lack of experience, the 6’3″ keeper is attracting interest, specifically in England, where his agent says a number of clubs have been keeping track of his progress.</p>
      <p>‘Liverpool are one of four English sides keeping close tabs on Ugurcan,’ Engin Kirkpinar told <a href="https://turkish-football.com/liverpool-join-race-for-e20m-trabzonspor-ace-ugurcan-cakir/">Turkish-football.com.</a></p>
      <p>‘Liverpool are among the sides interested in Cakir, and they have been monitoring his progress.</p>
      <p>‘Trabzonspor value Cakir as being worth a minimum £18m, and will not sell him in January. An end-of-season move could however be on the cards.’</p>

      <p>This is not the first time Kirkpinar has mentioned Liverpool’s interest, as he also name-dropped Lille and Schalke earlier this month.</p>

      <p>‘Every team have scouts and some of them are following Ugurcan’s matches,’ the agent told <a href="https://ajansspor.com/haber/ugurcan-cakirin-menajeri-liverpool-ve-schalkeyi-acikladi-303099#3">Ajansspor.</a></p>
      <p>‘Schalke haven’t made an official offer for him. I know Lille and Schalke are following him.</p>
      <p>‘Liverpool are also interested in him. Liverpool officials have talked with us, we had some contacts, but no official offer has come from them.’</p>
      <p>Alisson Becker is firmly entrenched as the number one goalkeeper at Anfield, and at 27-years-old, is likely to remain so for years to come.</p>
      <p>Adrian was brought in as back-up over the summer and has made 11 appearances so far this season due to Alisson picking up an injury on the opening day of the season.</p>
      <p>The Spanish keeper was signed on a free transfer and given a two-year contract, but Cakir may be seen as a more long-term number two.</p>
      <p>Caoimhín Kelleher has also made two first team appearances this campaign, both coming in the League Cup.</p>
