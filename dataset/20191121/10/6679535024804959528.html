      <p>The Islamic State group has claimed responsibility for an attack that killed nearly 30 soldiers in Mali earlier this week.</p>
      <p>A statement late Wednesday asserts that another 30 soldiers were wounded in Monday’s ambush.</p>
      <p>The statement mentions no deaths among IS-linked fighters. Mali’s army has said 17 extremists were killed in the fighting at Tabankort in the northeastern Gao region.</p>
      <p>Mali and Niger had been carrying out a joint operation along their border to track extremists. Nigerien troops detained about 100 suspects.</p>
      <p>Well over 100 Malian soldiers have died in the past two months in attacks by fighters linked to IS and al-Qaida.</p>
      <p>The U.S. says the Sahel region south of the Sahara Desert is of growing concern with thousands of IS-linked fighters active in Mali, Nigeria, Burkina Faso and elsewhere.</p>
