      <p>EcoCash has reassured the public that the process of stabilizing its new, more secure platform following a weekend upgrade, is nearly complete but has pleaded for patience as it works to "optimize" the performance of the service.<br/><br/>"We once again would like to thank our valued customers for bearing with us during this critical period in which we are now optimizing the various EcoCash services in a live environment," said Mr Eddie Chibi, the CEO of Cassava Smartech Zimbabwe, the company that owns EcoCash.<br/><br/>"The core of our platform is now working quite well, but some work is still continuing on the optimization of a few components that involve integration to third parties. We sincerely apologize to our customers for the inconvenience this may have caused them."<br/><br/>Mr Chibi said their engineers, along with experts from Comviva – the international platform vendor of the EcoCash platform who have been on the ground in Zimbabwe for a month in preparation for the major upgrade – were working around the clock to resolve all outstanding issues.<br/><br/>EcoCash announced a planned major upgrade of its platform last week to improve system availability, user experience, security and long-term capacity issues.</p>
