      <h1>Prince Andrew could be slapped with subpoena to face questioning in US</h1>

        <b>Prince Andrew has been urged to contact US investigators into Jeffrey Epstein, according to a lawyer representing some of Epstein's victims.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Gloria Allred has said the prince should make good on his pledge to assist the probes into the convicted sex offender  — who was <a href="https://cms.buzz.ie/featured/jeffrey-epstein-why-death-sparked-fury-334766"><i>found dead in his prison cell while awaiting trail for sex trafficking charges</i></a>.</p>
      <p>She has now urged him to contact US authorities "without conditions and without delay".</p>
      <p>Her comments came hours after the Duke of York announced he was stepping down from royal duties over the scandal.</p>
      <p>In a statement announcing his decision, Prince Andrew yesterday said the ordeal had become a "major disruption" to the royal family and that he was "willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigations, if required".</p>

      <p>Ms Allred said that while she was "glad" he is willing to co-operate but the meaning of his statement was not clear.</p>
      <p>"Is he insisting that he be served with a subpoena to testify, or is he willing to speak to law enforcement without being legally required to do so?" she asked.</p>
      <p>Another US lawyer for several Epstein accusers, Lisa Bloom, said she would be prepared to serve legal papers on the prince in the UK, compelling him to give sworn testimony</p>
      <p>Andrew has faced a furious backlash after a BBC interview in which he discussed his relationship with Epstein.</p>
      <p>For several months the duke had been facing questions over his ties to Epstein, who took his own life in August.</p>
      <p>Virginia Giuffre, one of Epstein's accusers, claimed she was forced to have sex with the prince. The duke has always denied any form of sexual contact or relationship with her.</p>

      <p>The interview was an opportunity for the prince to address the allegations against him, but he has been accused of being unsympathetic to Epstein's victims.</p>
      <p>Giuffre said the prince had sex with her a number of times when she was 17 years old. Andrew has directly denied this, and during the interview, made a series of odd statements in his attempt to poke holes in Giuffre’s story - including claiming he’d lost the ability to sweat (Giuffre claimed he was “profusely sweating” while dancing with her in 2001 before a sexual encounter).</p>
      <p>He also claimed could not have had sex with Giuffre on one of the dates she claimed because he’d taken his daughter for pizza.</p>
      <p>Andrew added that he has “no recollection” of meeting Giuffre, but refused to commit to testifying under oath about the matter, saying he would do so only “if push came to shove and the legal advice was to do so.”</p>
      <p>Yesterday's announcement that he would be stepping down from public duties, described by Buckingham Palace as "a personal decision", was taken following discussions with the Queen and prince Charles.</p>
