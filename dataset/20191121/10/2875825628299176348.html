      <h1>I'm A Celebrity viewers defend Andrew Maxwell after Ian Wright angrily snaps at him</h1>
      <h2>The Dublin funnyman tried to help the footballing legend after he confessed he was struggling with the lack of food</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T10:37:52+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 10:37</time> by <a rel="author">Michelle Townsend</a></address>
      <p>I'm A Celebrity viewers rushed to defend Irish comedian <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/andrew-maxwell">Andrew Maxwell</a> after<a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/ian-wright"> Ian Wright</a> snapped at him on Wednesday night's show.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/dublin">Dublin</a> funnyman tried to help the footballing legend after he confessed he was really struggling with the lack of food in the camp.</p>
      <p>The campmates won crocodile feet for their dinner after Adele Roberts' and Roman Kemp breezed through their Bushtucker trial, but Ian was still unhappy, <a href="https://www.rsvplive.ie/news/tv-film/im-celebrity-viewers-defend-andrew-20926611">RSVP Live</a> reports.</p>
      <p>In an effort to appease him, Jacqueline Jossa offered him extra crocodile before Ian shut her down telling her: "I don't want no more. I really honestly don't want no more."</p>
      <p>But Andrew insisted he could have another foot as James Haskell already took some more.</p>

      <p>Ian refused again, to which Andrew said: "Oh Jesus, the drama."</p>
      <p>Enough was enough for Ian, who fumed back at him: "I said I don't want anymore f***ing crocodile bruv. I don't want no more."</p>
      <p>Speaking in the Bush Telegraph, he added: "There's nothing more frustrating than when you say no to something and someone continues to ask you. It's annoying."</p>
      <p>But many <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celeb</a> viewers thought there was no need for Ian to snap at Andrew when he was only trying to help him.</p>
      <p>One shocked viewer wrote: "Ian shouting at Andrew for being generous - my heart hurts."</p>

      <p>"Really don’t like Ian after the way he just spoke to Andrew he was only trying to look out for him after Ian complained about being hungry all day," said another.</p>
      <p>A third wrote: "I'm a bit annoyed at Ian Wright for snapping at Andrew. Andrew is trying to make sure he keeps his strength up."</p>
      <p>While a fourth added: "Hang on didn't Ian say that he appreciated when andrew and James told him to eat and they were looking out for him? Do why did Ian snap at Andrew?"</p>
