        <b>Rohde &amp; Schwarz has announced a test system for automotive radar, consisting of the ATS1500C automotive radar test chamber, according to the firm, plus the AREG100A automotive radar echo generator for radar target simulation at various distances.</b>

      <p>“Together, they form an indirect far-field testing solution for verification of radar sensors throughout the R&amp;D and validation phase in a compact lab setup,” claimed <a href="http://www.rohde-schwarz.com/">R&amp;S</a>. “The solution enabled the calibration and verification of Uhnder’s new integrated 4D digitally modulated automotive radar-on-chip.”</p>
      <p>Within the chamber is a ‘compact antenna test range’ (CATR) reflector, generating a 300mm diameter quiet zone for testing from 77 to 81GHz, that includes a 3d tilt-tilt positioner and an absorber layout to minimise ghost targets during simulation.</p>

      <p>The <a href="http://www.uhnder.com/">Uhnder</a> radar chip combines CMOS and digital code modulation, and has 192 virtual channels – “a major leap from the 8 to 24 virtual channels used in today’s standard radars”, claimed R&amp;S.</p>
      <p>It also has 20Top of processing to track and classify objects, while consuming only 8W. “High contrast resolution provides significantly improved range and angular resolution and makes it possible to separate small radar reflectors from large reflectors in proximity,” said R&amp;S.</p>
      <p>“Rohde &amp; Schwarz was our partner of choice for developing this new technology,” said Uhnder engineering director Ralf Reuter”Our 4D digitally modulated radar-on-chip has special testing requirements, and having a partner with the necessary expertise was vital for us.</p>
