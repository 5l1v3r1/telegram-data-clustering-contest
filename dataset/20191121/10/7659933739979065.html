      <p>Libya's interim government, headed by Abdullah al-Thani, has launched a voluntary repatriation program for Libyan refugees in countries around the world, notably Egypt, Tunisia, Malta, Algeria and Germany.<br/><br/>The program, according to Foreign Minister Abdulhadi al-Huweij, includes important elements pertaining to providing for citizens and ensuring a decent life.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, the program forces returnees to stay away from taking up arms or using mosques in politics.<br/><br/>“The goal is patriotic, not political, and the program is a right for all Libyans regardless of their political and party orientations. Anyone who wants to return voluntarily to areas that have been liberated and are under government control, such as Benghazi or elsewhere, the government is facilitating their journey,” Huweij told Asharq Al-Awsat.<br/><br/>Huweij revealed that the program is being adequately funded, but clarified that Libyans willing to remain abroad are free to do so.<br/><br/>Huweij confirmed that “terrorism will not be allowed to pour back into the country.”<br/><br/>He added that Libyan citizens have the right to participate in political life after the chaos of terrorism and arms had been cleared out. This participation, according to Huweij will be through democratic elections.<br/><br/>The government has defined the displaced refugees who qualify for the program as those who have been driven out of their homes and the country because of their political and military orientation.<br/><br/>Also, the refugees who fled their homes between 2011 and July 5, 2017 will be included in the program.</p>
