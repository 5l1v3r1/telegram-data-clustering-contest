      <p>Unsurprisingly, Pokemon Sword and Shield are both doing very well for Nintendo since the twin titles launched last Friday. Now, according to <a href="https://www.serebii.ne/">Serebeii.net</a> – the go-to source for all things Pokemon – the two games have sold more than 6 million copies worldwide between them.</p>

      <p>Needless to say, this makes Pokemon Sword and Shield the biggest software launch for the Nintendo Switch. With 6 million copies in the wild, that could mean that around 15% of all Nintendo Switch owners around the globe may already be exploring the Galar region with their Pokemon party. That’s assuming that there’s one copy of the game being played on each system though it’s very likely that mega fans hopped on the Sword and Shield double pack deal. Still, those launch numbers are pretty impressive.</p>
      <p>According to Famitsu (via <a href="https://gematsu.com/2019/11/pokemon-sword-and-shield-sold-1-36-million-retail-copies-in-first-three-days-in-japan">Gematsu</a>) 1,364,544 retail copies of the latest gen Pokemon games were sold in its first three days. While we don’t have exact numbers, Pokemon Sword and Shield also <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/11/18/pokemon-sword-shield-star-wars-fallen-order-uk-chart/">managed to top the charts here in the UK</a> with Sword at number and Shield at number 3, EA’s Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order sandwiched in between. These three new releases managed to finally knock Call of Duty: Modern Warfare off the top spot though it will be interesting to see how the charts shape up in the weeks before Christmas.</p>

      <p>We’re bound to hear more about total sales in the coming days, Serebii.net stating that the 6 million figure may only account for the number of copies sold during the last calendar week.</p>
      <p>The best selling games for Nintendo Switch are currently as follows with Mario Kart 8 Deluxe at 19.01 million, followed by Super Smash Bros. Ultimate at 15.71 million, and Super Mario Odyssey at 15.38 million <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_Nintendo_Switch_video_games">according to Wikipedia</a>.</p>
