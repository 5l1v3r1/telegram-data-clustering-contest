      <p>As the Doha Metro Gold Line opens its doors today for passengers, the fare for a single journey between any two stations remains the same at 2QR. </p>
      <p>On its social media account, the Doha Metro tweeted, "The fare for a single journey between any two stations remains QR2." The team also cited an example stating passengers can travel from Al Wakra station on Red Line, change at Msheireb to Gold Line, head to Al Aziziyah station for Villagio Mall for QR2. </p>
      <p>When interchanging between lines, commuters do not have to tap in and out as long as they remain within the paid area.</p>
      <p>All journeys including those requiring an interchange will only cost 2 QAR in our standard and family class, and 10 QAR in Gold class for one trip.</p>

      <p>Doha Metro flags have been placed at the entrances of all Gold line stations to help commuters identify the newly opened stations. </p>
      <p>Standard and Goldclub rechargeable Travel Card introduced for Red Line can be used for Gold Line and all other Doha Metro networks, and even on Lusail Tram network when it opens. </p>
      <p>Commenting on this milestone said Eng. Abdulla Saif Al Sulaiti, Chief of Service Delivery at Qatar Rail: “The launch of the metro preview services has been well received and we’ve had an extremely positive response from our customers. The launch of the Gold Line service is another key milestone for Qatar Rail leading up to the delivery of our fully-fledged integrated network by 2020. In the past few months, we have dedicated our efforts to deliver the expansion of Doha Metro services, and we are ahead of schedule.”.</p>
      <p>He added: “With the launch of the Gold Line preview service we are expecting customer numbers to increase considerably as we open up more journey opportunities to explore the city; connecting attractions and lifestyle destinations including, National Museum, Souq Waqif, Al Sadd and Sport City.”.</p>
