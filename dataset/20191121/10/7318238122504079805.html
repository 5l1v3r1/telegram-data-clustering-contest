      <p>Italian rescue services say a blast at a fireworks factory in Sicily has killed up to five people and seriously injured two others, according to Italian news agency ANSA.</p>
      <p>Italian firefighters and Carabinieri police said that the 71-year-old wife of the owner of the family-run factory in the Sicilian town of Barcellona Pozzo di Gotto was among the victims.</p>
      <p>The owner's son was hospitalised in serious condition.</p>

      <p>Police say workers at the depot may have accidentally set off the explosion with welding equipment on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
      <p>This is not a completely isolated incident. Indeed, safety at fireworks depots has been long debated in Italy, where the production of fireworks is often a family-run business.</p>
      <p>Consumers association Codacons says 68 people have been killed in explosions at fireworks firms since 2000.</p>
