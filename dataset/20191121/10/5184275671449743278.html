      <p>Ekta Kapoor has been on a roll all through 2019 bringing some really interesting content to the audience on multiple platforms. To further surprise her fans and bring them what goes behind bringing the bold <i>Ragini MMS season 2, </i>Ekta hai shared a fun video on Instagram.</p>
      <p>In the video, Ekta can be seen holding an office conference in which she is discussing the content of Ragini MMS 2 and how it should have all the Chamak Damak and Namak. Ekta captioned the video as, ‚ÄúSo this really happened at the office and we shot this moment to why n how we came to adding this interesting name to our epic mass franchise #raginimmsreturns ( p.s pls ignore d acting if I was auditioning for #balaji I‚Äôd reject ME on d basis of HammingüòÇüï∫üèª) .. A dhamakedar show like #RaginiMMSReturns Season 2 demands so much more! We‚Äôve got the chamak and dhamak, but there‚Äôs always room for more namak! My team and I have cracked it!</p>
      <p>#HelloJi, can you guess what will add the salt on Zee and ALT?<br/>@altbalaji @Zee5Premium<br/>@divyaagarwal_official @varunsood12 @aadyaguptaofficial @snehanamanandi @navneetkaur1012 @goddesst999 @rishika_nag @aartikhetarpal @gauravalugh @rathodvikram01 @mohit.duseja @balajitelefilmslimited @kenghosh19 @k4ms @envyas @chloejferns @manjitsachdev @meghannmalik‚Äù.</p>
