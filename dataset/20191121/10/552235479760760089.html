      <p>A determined Renfrewshire teenager is climbing her way to the top after overcoming a serious arm injury.</p>
      <p>Kilbarchan girl Ava Hamilton broke her arm last year, which halted her progress in her passion for rock climbing.</p>
      <p>Despite the setback, the 12-year-old Kelvinside Academy pupil has just been selected for the GB Climbing National Development Squad.</p>
      <p>A delighted Hamilton said: “I have been climbing since I was seven and I absolute love it.</p>
      <p>“I broke my arm badly last year and couldn’t climb for six months, so I am very proud of myself for making the GB team.</p>
      <p>“I really enjoy competing and, with lots of national and international competitions next year, I can’t wait to get started.”</p>
      <p>The selection event took place at Awesome Walls Sheffield and the Depot Climbing Centre in Sheffield.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Hamilton battled against 14 other girls for one of only three remaining spots in the Girls’ Youth C category, and is the only Scot to make it into the group.</p>
      <p>Established in 2017, the GB Climbing National Development Squad provides a pathway for gifted young climbers, propelling them from national to international competitions within the sport and the wider climbing world.</p>
      <p>As part of the squad, Hamilton will be encouraged to develop into a well-rounded athlete and become better equipped to take on international competition and the wider world of rock climbing, with all the elements that entails.</p>
      <p>The GB Climbing National Development squad is made up of four junior categories, with six places in each category per gender, equating to 48 places in total.</p>
