      <p>FC Barcelona return to action on Saturday 23rd November when they face Leganes in LaLiga. Four days later and attention will turn to the Champions League and a tough fixture against Borussia Dortmund awaits.</p>
      <p>So far this season, Barça have enjoyed good results following the previous international breaks. They beat Valencia 5-2 at the Camp Nou and ran out comfortable 3-0 winners over Eibar.</p>
      <p>Messi and Suarez didn't play for their national teams in that second international break and were in top form against Eibar. It was a similar story for the crushing of Valencia. Neither of the front two were forced to join up with their countries that time either but Messi didn't recover in time for the league game.</p>
      <p>Griezmann has featured in every match for his country so far and has picked up one goal and five assists during that time. Messi and Suarez, both fully fit, also return after scoring and assisting for their respective countries.</p>

      <p>The key will be the fitness of the players who have travelled - and played - up to 180 minutes this week. Lenglet (180), Busquets (90) and De Jong (165) might be feeling tired going into this weekend's LaLiga match against Leganes. Sergi Roberto is suspended for the first match and Pique for the contest against Dortmund. Nelson Semedo and Jordi Alba are injured and it remains to be seen how Samuel Umtiti feels.</p>
      <p>Leganes are struggling this year and it presents Barça with a strong chance to make it three wins out of three following the international break. Barça sit top the table along with Real Madrid on 25 points and will be desperate not to lose ground as they look to retain their LaLiga crown.</p>
