      <p><b>Best</b> Mesh Wi-Fi Router Kits iMore 2019</p>
      <p>Mesh Wi-Fi kits are a popular way for people to rid their homes of network dead spots. Whether you have a large place or a small place with thick walls, connecting a few satellite Wi-Fi points to a main router will spread the signal evenly. Why not just grab an extender or a more powerful router? You certainly can, but extenders don't usually work in unison, and powerful routers can be just as expensive as one of these mesh kits. If you're interested in setting up a mesh network, here are the standouts of the current mesh network kits on offer.</p>

      <p>Editor's choice</p>
      <p>Nest Wifi brings the Google Wifi line of mesh routers into the future with much faster AC2200 Wi-Fi speeds. Speeds are kept high with four data streams at 5Ghz and two more at 2.4Ghz, allowing for strong dual-band connections. Compatible with Nest Wifi points and Google Wifi routers, Nest Wifi can make a strong mesh with plenty of expansion options. WPA3 security is a step ahead of the competition, and MU-MIMO and beamforming keep connections efficient and strong as you move around your home.</p>

      <p>AmpliFi's newest entry into mesh networking is the AmpliFi Instant. With four dual-band antennas and support for 2x2 MU-MIMO, this mesh system competes on simplicity and compact design rather than speed and power. Capable of 300Mbps on the 2.4Ghz band and 867Mhz on the 5Ghz band, the speed should be more than enough for most homes. Easily add more mesh points to fill in any weak spots in your home. Even so, each unit covers 2,000 square feet, and a single kit should be enough for most homes.</p>
