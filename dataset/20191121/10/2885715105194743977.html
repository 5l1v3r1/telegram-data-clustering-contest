      <h1>Pagalpanti actor John Abraham: I no longer have the fear of failure</h1>
      <h2>Bollywood actor John Abraham on Bollywood comedy Pagalpanti, choosing choosing scrips at this stage of his career and failure.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T10:39:10+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 10:39</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/profile/author/komal-rj-panchal/" target="_blank">Komal RJ Panchal</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/john-abraham/">John Abraham</a> will be seen sharing screen space with Ileana D’Cruz, Anil Kapoor, Arshad Warsi, Saurabh Shukla and Urvashi Rautela in comedy film Pagalpanti, directed by Anees Bazmee.</p>
      <p>In this candid conversation with <a href="https://indianexpress.com/">indianexpress.com</a>, John talks about Pagalpanti, choosing scrips at this stage of his career and failure.</p>
      <p>Excerpts from the conversation:</p>
      <p>
        <b>You have called Pagalpanti a clean humorous film. How important is it to be socially responsible when it comes to choosing a film?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The advantage with this film is that we have not disrespected our audience. We have given them a clean film. We have given them a plot that has relevant issues of today – PMC bank issue, people who have robbed money from our co-operative banks and more. Like I have said earlier, the villains of our film are economic villains. They are cute. They aren’t your quintessential bad guy who has a gun. There is no blood and gore. The beauty of the film is that it is so clean that every generation can watch the film. Your grandchild to your grandparents, anybody and everybody can watch this film.</p>
      <p>
        <b>2019 has been quite a good year. You had three different releases – RAW, Batla House and now Pagalpanti.</b>
      </p>
      <p>I work on my productions for three to four years. Batla House was two to two and a half years work. RAW was one and a half years work. Whereas with Pagalpanti, I completely trusted my director because it is a zone where he is probably a million times more conversant than I am. His lines and comic timing – Anees Bazmee is the best in the business.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What do you look for in a script at this stage of your career?</b>
      </p>
      <p>I am a far better actor now than I was when I was younger. It is because of the way I choose scripts. It is also because of my workshops where I really understand and learn the process. I understand what my limitations were and still are. It is very important to take all this very constructively, because only then you can improve.</p>
      <p>As cliche as it may sound, every day is a learning process. Every day is a selection process. You can go wrong. You can go horribly wrong at times, but for a person who has faced failure so often, ‘failing again’ is not the fear I have anymore. This is why I select films that are so radically different. That keeps me going, absolutely all the time.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Dostana had released in November 2008. It has been 11 years since it released, and now there is a part two coming up with a totally new cast. How do you feel about that?</b>
      </p>
      <p>It is one of the films I had most fun working on. It was such a beautiful experience, and one of my closest friends in the industry is <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/abhishek-bachchan/">Abhishek Bachchan</a>, We really got along well because we had to kiss so often (chuckles).</p>
      <p>But, honestly, those memories were extremely beautiful. The only difference now is that I am fitter, stronger, better and faster.</p>
      <p>Dostana was Karan’s baby in the first place, and I think Karan is a fantastic producer. He knows how to project his film. He knows exactly what to do. So, I am sure that he has thought about this before getting the new cast. I am sure that Karan will do absolute justice to it. He knows his stuff really well.</p>
