      <p>Kerala Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac on Thursday said the Centre had defaulted on its promise of GST compensation for the States. The GST compensation for August and September is yet to be paid for the States, he said at a workshop on ‘Challenges to India’s Fiscal Federalism’ here. The workshop was jointly organised by the Indian Institute of Social Sciences, Puducherry and Gulati Institute of Finance and Taxation, Thiruvananthapuram.</p>
      <p>Pointing out that there was a serious shortfall in revenue to the States, he said that most of the States have now gone in for borrowing. The Centre has slashed ₹6,500 crore from the sanctioned assistance for various Centrally-funded projects for Kerala, and the State has been forced to squeeze its expenditure in the wake of the economic slowdown.</p>
      <p>Mr. Isaac also described as a mockery of democracy, the intervention of Puducherry Lt. Governor Kiran Bedi in the decision of an elected government on the free rice scheme.</p>
      <p>DMK Thoothukudi MP Kanimozhi said the pluralism and diversity of the country had been silenced and this had instilled fear into everybody’s heart.</p>
      <p>Referring to the situation in Kashmir, she said, “We saw the loudest and most brutal assault on federalism just a few days ago. None of us could stop it; could do anything and we are still spectators to what is happening there. The only answer we got from the government is cold silence.”</p>
      <p>According to her, the powers of the legislative, executive and judiciary are now in the hands of a few or in the hands of one organisation. “Every institution in this country has been compromised, bent and made flexible to suit the needs, the agenda that has been set for this country by a few and that is where the tyranny we all fear has started,” she charged.</p>
      <p>Haseeb A. Drabu, former Finance Minister, Jammu and Kashmir, K. Balakrishnan, Tamil Nadu state secretary, CPI (M) and V. Selvam, Regional Director, ISS, Puducherry also participated.</p>
