      <h1>Chrystia Freeland: Canada's new deputy PM who could prove crucial for Trudeau</h1>

        <i>Decision to elevate former journalist reflects level of trust Trudeau has in her and the scale of the task for his government</i>
      </p>
      <p>During the most important week in North American free trade negotiations last year, Canada’s top representative arrived in Washington wearing white T-shirt that read “Keep Calm and Negotiate Nafta” and “Mama ≠ Chopped Liver”.</p>
      <p>The message from her children who made the shirt, was clear: Chrystia Freeland was not to be underestimated.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, the prime minister, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/justin-trudeau">Justin Trudeau</a>, elevated Freeland, a former journalist, to the role of deputy prime minister. A largely ceremonial position, the job has not been filled since 2006.</p>
      <p>But <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/20/justin-trudeau-cabinet-chrystia-freeland-national-unity-climate-crisis">Trudeau also made her minister of intergovernmental affairs</a>, a job that requires her to manage the increasingly fractious relationship between Canada’s federal government, provinces and territories.</p>
      <p>The decision reflects the level of trust Trudeau has in Freeland – and the scale of the task at hand.</p>
      <p>In last month’s election, the Liberal party suffered an electoral wipeout in Alberta and Saskatchewan, amid hostility to Trudeau and his legislative efforts against climate change.</p>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/16/alberta-canada-election-justin-trudeau-oil">struggling oil and gas sector has hit the economies of both provinces</a>, and anger has begun to fuel a nascent separatist movement – dubbed “Wexit” – that many fear could inflict lasting damage on Canada.</p>
      <p>In a parliament in which no party controls a majority, having a close ally to mediate feuds with angry provinces will be critical for Trudeau’s government.</p>
      <p>There is no doubt that the portfolio could be “fraught and risky”, said Lori Turnbull, a professor of political science at Dalhousie University.</p>
      <p>“[But] because of the national unity issues that are existing now – this should not be seen at all as any kind of a demotion or even a lateral move for Freeland. This is a promotion,” Turnbull said. “Because now it’s clear she’s the one that he trusts the most with the hardest file.”</p>
      <p>Freeland was born in a small farming community of Peace River and recently described herself as a “proud Albertan”. She also hails from the Ukrainian diaspora that settled, and has farmed, much of the Canadian prairies for generations.</p>
      <p>But those credentials might not be enough to make inroads in a region hostile to Trudeau.</p>
      <p>“I mean, she’s still a Liberal,” said Harvey Spak, a retired film-maker in Mundare, Alberta. A member of the Ukrainian community himself, Spak suggested the Liberal brand – and Freeland’s residence in Toronto – would erode any goodwill granted by her background.</p>
      <p>But months of tense – and ultimately successful – trade negotiations with the US, have left Freeland battle-tested.</p>
      <p>“She’s a big thinker who has a considerable understanding of the international context,” said Roland Paris, an international affairs professor at the University of Ottawa and former Trudeau adviser. “At the same time, she’s a tenacious negotiator.”</p>
      <p>Freeland’s meteoric rise from rookie lawmaker to foreign minister and now deputy prime minister has not surprised former colleagues.</p>
      <p>“Chrystia was the best in town. She was the person to beat,” said David Hoffman, a former Moscow bureau chief for the Washington Post in the 1990s, who worked alongside Freeland when she ran the Financial Times bureau.</p>
      <p>The two travelled the country together, reporting on the growing pains of a region where the rule of law was often non-existent. “I think these were, for her, life-changing events to witness. Because they made us realize how utterly difficult – and how precious – this idea of ‘market democracy’ really was.”</p>
      <p>Freeland eventually returned to North America, by way of Toronto and New York, accepting senior editorial positions at the Globe and Mail, the FT and Thomson Reuters.</p>
      <p>In 2013, Justin Trudeau, then the newly minted Liberal party leader pursued Freeland, pleading with her to leave media and enter politics, even appearing at her book signing to make his case.</p>
      <p>Eventually she accepted his offer to run for federal office in Toronto.</p>
      <p>“I think’s she’s, without question, seen as the breakaway star in the Trudeau cabinet,” said Peter Donolo, a political strategist and former director of communications for former prime minister Jean Chrétien.</p>
      <p>In her time leading the sprawling foreign affairs portfolio, Freeland cultivated a reputation for blunt charm and a sharply honed ability to read people.</p>
      <p>When, during her brief stint as international trade minister, intransigent parties in Belgium held up a huge free trade deal between <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/canada">Canada</a> and Europe, Freeland simply walked away.</p>
      <p>Conservatives in Canada were outraged, calling her ploy a “meltdown” and suggesting she needed “adult supervision” on order to effectively negotiate. But the strategy worked, and she closed the multibillion-dollar deal.</p>
      <p>“She flipped it over. She did political jiujitsu on it and came away looking like a big winner,” said Donolo.</p>
      <p>While feuds within the country will differ from high-stakes international trade negotiations, they will nonetheless occupy a significant amount of Freeland’s energy and attention.</p>
      <p>“She’s got a lot of experience in trying to manage diplomacy in extremely complex environments where there are clear and distinct different interests,” said Turnbull.</p>
      <p>The position of deputy prime minister is also likely to reignite talk of Freeland as a Liberal party leader-in-waiting. Jean Chrétien remains the only person to have moved from deputy to prime minister, Freeland’s promotion will do little to tamp down speculation.</p>
      <p>“I think Freeland would be an obvious choice for a potential successor,” said Turnbull.</p>
