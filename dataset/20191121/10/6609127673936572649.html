      <p>His bike plunged almost 1000ft from the mountainside road, according the the <a href="https://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/news/people/watsonian-rugby-player-iain-finnie-killed-nepal-after-motorcycle-fell-1000-ft-1312336">Edinburgh Evening News.</a></p>
      <p>Iain was rushed to Manipal Hospital in Pokhara for treatment, but was later pronounced dead.</p>
      <p>He starred for Watsonians rugby team between 1973 and 1986, for the first XV and several other teams.</p>
      <p>He played almost 150 games, at hooker and in the back row, for the first team.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said: “We are assisting the family and friends of a British man who died in Nepal."</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for Watsonian rugby club told the Evening News: "He was a formidable 7-a-side player at hooker and had an impressive turn of speed with great handling skills."</p>
      <p>We told earlier how Scots rugby legend Tom Smith has been <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4978895/tom-smith-cancer-scotland-british-lions/">diagnosed with stage four cancer.</a></p>
      <p>The 48-year-old former Scotland and British Lions star's disease started in the colon before spreading to the brain and liver.</p>
      <p>He has been undergoing intrusive treatment with the aim of extending his life for as long as possible.</p>
      <p>And Health Secretary Jeane Freeman has admitted contaminated water at Glasgow's superhospital may have been <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4978745/health-secretary-glasgow-hospital-contaminated-water/">behind the death of a 10-year-old girl.</a></p>
      <p>Freeman has slammed NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde over their handling of the passing of cancer patient Milly Main at Queen Elizabeth University Hospital.</p>
      <p>This came after she was forced to make an apology at Holyrood, where she also brought up concerns raised by other patients.</p>
