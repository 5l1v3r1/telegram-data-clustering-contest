      <h1>Dean Henderson insists he is still not a Man Utd player ahead of Sheffield United clash</h1>
      <h2>Sheffield United shot-stopper Dean Henderson will be unable to play when his parent club Manchester United travel to Bramall Lane on Sunday</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T10:56:01+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 10:56</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Dean Henderson claims he still has much work to do before he can call himself a <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> player.</p>
      <p>Henderson is enjoying a second successful season on loan at Sheffield United and no other Premier League goalkeeper can top his haul of five clean sheets.</p>
      <p>The England Under-21 international has yet to play a senior game for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side, despite having been at the club since he was 14, and says he does not feel he is a United player.</p>
      <p>Henderson, 22, who earned his first senior England call-up last month, must sit out United’s visit to Bramall Lane on Sunday and still hopes to play for them.</p>

      <p>“Hopefully I can fulfil the ambition of playing for them one day and why not if I keep going the way I’m going?” he said.</p>
      <p>“I still don’t believe I am a Man United player yet. I still feel I have a lot of work to do to get to that level.”</p>
      <p>Henderson has also been on loan at Stockport, Grimsby and Shrewsbury and is pleased he left Old Trafford to gain experience rather than take the easy option of playing for their youth or Under-23 sides.</p>
      <p>“For me, it was all about getting out on loan and trying something different,” said Henderson, who won the Championship’s Golden Glove last season during United’s promotion-winning campaign.</p>
      <p>“I always wanted to get out there and prove myself, rather than sit in my comfort zone.</p>
      <p>“There are many players who are just happy to sit there and say they are Manchester United players, but realistically you aren’t for me until you are in the first team.</p>
      <p>“I would like to see more goalkeepers go out into the lower leagues because it would be a big test for them. I’ve proven I can play in every division.</p>
      <p>“The lower down the pyramid, the harder it was to be honest. Stockport was my hardest loan.</p>
      <p>“I can still remember making mistakes and it was so difficult. I wanted the ground to open up and swallow me up, but I was only a young kid and I have learnt so much since those early days.”</p>
