      <h3>What is the best new plugin/software of 2019?</h3>
      <p>
        <b>There are so many superb plugins and bits of music-making software released each year that picking a single 'best of 2019' is perhaps impossible. That said, there are always stand-out examples -Â those that have solved problems or stimulated creativity - and these deserve shouting about.</b>
