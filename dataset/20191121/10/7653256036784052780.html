      <p>PUNE: <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech-mahindra-ltd/stocks/companyid-11221.cms">Tech Mahindra</a> has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Business <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Finland">Finland</a> to set up a <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/5G">5G</a> and 6G <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/innovation-lab">innovation lab</a> in Finland.</p>
      <p>As part of the collaboration, Tech Mahindra will develop, pilot and implement state-of-the-art digital products and services to foster growth, productivity and innovations in the area of 5G and 6G.</p>
      <p>Tech Mahindra’s innovation centre will be a platform for key players in Finland, including universities, research institutes, government and companies, to collaborate.</p>
      <p>Jagdish Mitra, chief strategy officer, Tech Mahindra told ET that the primary focus would be creating enterprise applications using the technology. “We want to make 5G and <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/6G">6G</a> enterprise-ready and will cover all aspects of the rollout,” he said.</p>
      <p>The innovation lab would also work with businesses in the region to create proofs of concept on enterprise applications, said Mitra.</p>
      <p>Timo Harakka, Finnish Minister for Employment, said, “The MoU between Tech Mahindra and <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Business-Finland">Business Finland</a> is an excellent step forward in the close collaboration between Finland and <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Mahindra-group">Mahindra group</a>. Business Finland will work together with Tech Mahindra to explore the possibility of establishing 5G/6G Innovation Hub in Finland. I am sure that this cooperation will be mutually beneficial and provide great opportunities for both Finland and Tech Mahindra.”</p>
      <p>Communications is a key vertical for Tech Mahindra, contributing over 40% to its total revenues. The company has said that it will start seeing the impact of the 5G rollout over 2020 as actual implementation begins.</p>
      <p>Mitra said, “The Finnish technology ecosystem is one of the most progressive in Europe. Their strategic focus on building ‘technologies for the future’ has been the cornerstone, and the initiative towards developing 6G technology and further working on 5G use-cases aligns well with our TechMNxt charter.”</p>
      <p>The company has a three-step approach to 5G, which it will then look at replicating with the 6G rollout as well. It is looking at providing solutions for communications service providers to help with the network rollout and upgrade, enterprise applications across industries like manufacturing, retail, oil and gas and logistics, and device enablement.</p>
      <p>Antti Aumo, Executive Director, Invest in Finland, Business Finland, said, “Finland has an active co-operation between the public and private sectors, combined with an active start-up scene and innovative testbeds. Innovation and investments in RDI have a huge direct linkage to economic productivity and employment growth, and Tech Mahindra´s decision to set up an innovation lab in Finland is excellent news for Finland and for Finnish companies, universities and research organizations.”</p>
