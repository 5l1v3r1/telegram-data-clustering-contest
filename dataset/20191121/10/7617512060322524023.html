      <p>A Courtenay man has died after an assault in downtown Courtenay on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Family have confirmed Sean Parker, 46, died at Victoria General Hospital hours after an altercation.</p>
      <p>Sister Natalie Parker confirmed he died at 4:08 p.m. Tuesday.</p>
      <p>At about 1:25 p.m. on Tuesday, Comox Valley RCMP officers responded to a report of an assault on the 350-block of 6th Street in Courtenay and found a 46-year old man unconscious on the sidewalk. He was rushed to hospital by ambulance with life-threatening injuries.</p>
      <p>“The victim and the suspect were at the Courtenay library shortly before getting into an altercation, which resulted in the victim suffering a serious head injury,” said Staff Sgt. Glen Breckon of the Comox Valley RCMP’s major crime unit.</p>
      <p>Breckon, who described the area on 6th street as busy, put a call out for witnesses to the dispute at the library, or anyone with video or dashcam footage from around the time of the assault.</p>
      <p>Police do not believe the incident to be random. Police said they had identified a person of interest on Tuesday afternoon.</p>
