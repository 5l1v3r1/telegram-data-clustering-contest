      <p>Mohammed Rashid, of M.A.Halal Meat, recently pleaded guilty to 14 offences at Wolverhampton Magistrates Court.</p>
      <p>Inspectors from Sandwell Council's environmental health team visited the premises, in Shireland Road, on several occasions during 2018 following a complaint from a member of the public.</p>
      <p>The inspectors found poor standards of hygiene, including evidence of pests, poor cleaning standards and inadequate waste disposal facilities.</p>
      <p>At Wolverhampton Magistrates Court last month, Rashid received a £240 fine for each offence, totalling £3,360. He was also ordered to pay costs of £3,500 and a victim surcharge of £30.</p>
      <h3>Necessary</h3>
      <p>Neil Cox, Sandwell Council's director of prevention and protection, welcomed the prosecution.</p>
      <p>He said: "Our officers worked with the owners of the business and they were given chance to make the necessary improvements to improve hygiene standards.</p>
      <p>“Unfortunately, when inspectors returned they found the business had not made the necessary improvements and that prosecution was necessary.</p>
      <p>“We work to ensure members of the public are not exposed to unsafe food practices and will continue to work with this business owner to ensure standards at the premises improve.</p>
      <p>“I urge members of the public to <a href="http://www.sandwell.gov.uk/info/200190/consumer_advice/2126/food_hygiene_standards">report any food hygiene concerns to us using our online form</a>. I also want to remind food businesses of their duty to ensure they run a safe and hygienic business and failure to do so may result in prosecution.”</p>
