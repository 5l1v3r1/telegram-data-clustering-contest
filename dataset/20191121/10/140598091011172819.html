      <p>Torquay11 is a new player on Fanteam and registered in August. Since then he played only 16 tournaments and already reached a nice profit of 450€. We talked to him after his great performance in the Weekly Monster GW12 (2€ buy in).</p>
      <p>
        <b>Congratulations on the first place in the Weekly Monster 2€ tournament! Tell us something about yourself! Who is torquay11?</b>
      </p>
      <p>"My name is Tim, I am 49 years old and I live in Exeter in Devon. My main interests are football, I am an Arsenal fan with a local interest in Torquay United. My favourite all time player is Denis Bergkamp.</p>
      <p>"I also enjoy and play cricket, golf and love watching boxing.</p>
      <p>"I also love music, especially indie bands."</p>
      <p>
        <b>How do you create your line-ups? Do you watch the games or only use stats? Tell us what your draft process looks like</b>
      </p>
      <p>"My draft process will change according to form really.</p>
      <p>"So last week I was really looking at form teams &amp; players &amp; also players who had a good record against the opposition.</p>
      <p>"Therefore Vardy was a stand out Captain as he had scored something like eight goals in his last eight games against Arsenal and unfortunately for me Arsenal had the third worst shots against record in the league, Maddison &amp; Chilwell were picked on the basis of Arsenal’s shocking defensive record and Leicester's solidity at the back.</p>
      <p>"Tarkowski was picked due to Burnley’s home record and he pops up with the odd goal and assist.</p>
      <p>"Kieran Clark mainly because Newcastle’s goals are being scored by defenders this year. Son, Mane &amp; Martial were purely form picks and had home fixtures and then I chose Chris Wood due to him having four goals in his last four games against West Ham. McCarthy and Wan Bissaka were the blanks.</p>
      <p>"I would rather spend money on midfielders and forwards rather than defenders just because I feel you get more value in budget defenders.</p>
      <p>"Home fixtures are pretty much concentrated on unless it’s one of the top teams. Again current form is important but also a player horses for courses can give some real value."</p>
      <p>
        <b>Did you know you could have won around 1500€ if you would have entered your team in the 50k guaranteed tournament?</b>
      </p>
      <p>"I do know I could have won 1500 Euros but I'm still pretty new to the site and I am still finding my feet but will get involved in the process a lot more in the future."</p>
      <p>
        <b>Is there a player you would never pick for your team?</b>
      </p>
      <p>"Defensive midfielders are players that don’t do it for me; they offer nothing going forward &amp; don’t get clean sheets."</p>
      <p>
        <b>Are you going to keep on playing on Fanteam? Do you have any wishes for the platform?</b>
      </p>
      <p>"I will definitely keep playing Fanteam - It offers great value for money and the format is really decent, the pricing makes you constantly thinking about the best value options available to free up money."</p>
      <p>
        <b>Do you have any advice for new DFS players?</b>
      </p>
      <p>"The only advice I will give is to enjoy yourself.</p>
      <p>"Also just because a player is expensive and quality it doesn’t mean they are a great pick for that week: Kane &amp; Agüero are a case in point.</p>
      <p>"Kane is suffering a bit I think due to Erriksens poor form and Sheffield United exceptional form. Aguero’s record at Liverpool is shocking so they were never on the radar.</p>
      <p>"All the very best to everyone!"</p>
