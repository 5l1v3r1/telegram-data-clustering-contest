      <h1>Congress tried to stall Ayodhya case, kept Kashmir on backburner for 70 years: Amit Shah</h1>
      <h2>The five-phase polling in Jharkhand begins on November 30 and ends on December 20.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T10:40:47+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 10:40</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/express-web-desk/" target="_blank">Express Web Desk</a></address>
      <p>Ahead of the first phase of the Jharkhand Assembly elections on November 30, Union Home Minister Amit Shah Thursday accused the  Congress of stalling the Ayodhya case in the Supreme Court and keeping the Kashmir issue on the backburner for 70 years.</p>
      <p>Addressing a rally at Latehar — the land of <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/who-is/who-was-birsa-munda/">Birsa Munda</a> and Nilamber and Pitamber — a district in Jharkhand, Amit Shah said: “Congress kept the Kashmir problem hanging for 70 years in the greed to protect its vote bank.”</p>
      <p>Lauding Supreme Court’s recent decision on the Ramjanbhoomi land dispute, Shah said: “We wanted resolution of Ayodhya dispute within the framework of Constitution and with Lord Ram’s blessings the SC has cleared way for temple. Everyone wanted Ram temple but Congress tried to stall the case.”</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/bjp/">BJP</a> chief also asked Congress and its former president Rahul Gandhi to give an account of what they have done for the tribals in the state.</p>
      <p>“People kept dying, youth sacrificed their lives, but dream of Jharkhand statehood remained unfulfilled under Congress rule,” he claimed.</p>
      <p>The five-phase polling in Jharkhand begins on November 30 and ends on December 20. In 2014, BJP won 37 seats and its ally AJSU won five seats, taking the tally to 42 — one more than the majority mark. Later, six MLAs of Jharkhand Vikas Morcha (Prajatantrik) joined the BJP.</p>
