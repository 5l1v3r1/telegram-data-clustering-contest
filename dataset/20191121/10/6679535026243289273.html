      <p>Market benchmark Sensex settled 76 points lower on Thursday, tracking weak cues from global equities as US-China impasse continued to weigh on investor sentiment.</p>
      <p>After trading on a choppy note through the day, the 30-share index ended 76.47 points, or 0.19%, lower at 40,575.17. It hit an intra-day low of 40,534.12 and a high of 40,744.85.</p>
      <p>Similarly, the broader NSE Nifty closed 30.70 points, or 0.26%, down at 11,968.40.</p>
      <p>Tata Steel was the top loser in the Sensex pack, dropping 3.35%, followed by Bharti Airtel down 2.52%, Yes Bank 2.43%, ONGC 1.98% and ITC 1.96%.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, HUL gained 1.15%, L&amp;T 0.89%, Bajaj Auto 0.82% and SBI 0.81%.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere in Asia, bourses in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Seoul settled in the red amid reports that the US-China trade deal was unlikely to be signed this year.</p>
      <p>Further, the US Senate passed legislation supporting Hong Kong protestors, potentially complicating the trade negotiations with China, experts said.</p>
      <p>European equities were also trading on a negative note in their respective early deals.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the Indian rupee appreciated marginally to 71.78 against the US dollar in intra-day trade.</p>
      <p>Brent crude futures, the global oil benchmark, fell 0.51% to USD 62.08 per barrel.</p>
