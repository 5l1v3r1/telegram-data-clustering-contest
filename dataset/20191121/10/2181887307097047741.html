      <h1>Google will crack down on the micro-targeting of political ads</h1>
      <h2>It's not perfect, but it's a start</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T10:44:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 10:44</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theinquirer.net/author/profile/2960/chris-merriman" target="_blank">Chris Merriman</a></address>
      <p><b>GOOGLE HAS BECOME</b> the latest big tech firm to take action over political advertising.</p>
      <p>In an announcement on Wednesday, the ad-platform with search facility confirmed that it would no longer allow political adverts to be targeted specifically at users based on their known political views.</p>
      <p>That means that Google will no longer allow political parties to cross-reference its database of supporters against Google's database of users. It won't, however, stop advertisers from profiling by the usual demographics - age, gender, location and the like.</p>
      <p>Google has also said that it will take action on reports of misleading information being shared in Google-powered adverts. Instead, users will see an explanation of the omitted content - but there'll be no way to see the offending advert.</p>
      <p>The new rules will affect Google Search, including YouTube videos. The policy will roll out "within a week" in Blighty, where we're just over three weeks from a General Election. Other territories will follow.</p>
      <p>The move is the latest from a tech company. We've already seen <a href="https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/3083261/twitter-bans-political-ads">Twitter completely remove political advertising</a> (because it's a grumpy enough place already). Facebook has also clarified its position on what to do in the event of misinformation. Which is <a href="https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/3036883/facebook-uncovers-inauthentic-anti-trump-political-campaign-on-its-social-network">precisely f*ck all.</a></p>
      <p>In a blog post, Scott Spencer, a VP at Google Ads explains: "Political advertisers can, of course, continue to do contextual targeting, such as serving ads to people reading or watching a story about, say, the economy.</p>
      <p>"This will align our approach to election ads with long-established practices in media such as TV, radio, and print, and result in election ads being more widely seen and available for public discussion."</p>
      <p>The decision is unlikely to make a huge difference to Google's bottom line - there's still a whole bunch of reasons to use the remaining, permitted targetting parameters.</p>
      <p>What it will mean, however, is that voters won't find themselves trapped in an echo chamber of propaganda designed to appeal to what they already think. μ</p>
