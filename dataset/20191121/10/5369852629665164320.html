      <p>WESLEY SNEIJDER BELIEVES he could have been mentioned in the same breath as Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo if he was more committed. </p>
      <p>The 35-year-old retired as a player in August after hanging up his boots following a stint in Qatar with Al-Gharafa. </p>
      <p>Across a decorated career that saw him play for Ajax, Real Madrid, Inter Milan, Galatasaray and Nice, Sneijder won domestic titles with each and also lifted the Champions League in 2010. </p>
      <p>Individually, however, the Netherlands international often fell just short of silverware, a fact he is well aware of but isn’t bothered by. Sneijder in fact believes he could have rivalled the game’s very best players had he given everything to the game. </p>
      <p>“I have to be honest and admit that I could have been mentioned in the same breath as Messi and Ronaldo if I had been 100% committed. I know that,” Sneijder told Fox Sports NL.</p>
      <p>“But I did not want to do that and I have no regrets about it. It’s not that I didn’t have it in me, but I simply didn’t want to do it.</p>
      <p>“I enjoyed my footballing career as it was, both on and off the pitch. I won every trophy I could win at club level, so I have no regrets at all. I am a team player and I like to be successful as a team.</p>
      <p>“People still approach me to tell me that they feel I should have won the Ballon d’Or in 2010, but I keep telling them that winning the Champions League was nicer than an individual trophy.</p>
      <p>“Of course, it would have been the icing on the cake, but it’s satisfying enough that people tell me I should have won it.”</p>
      <p>Sneijder finished fourth in voting for the Ballon d’Or in 2010 with Messi taking home the award ahead of Andres Iniesta and Xavi. </p>

      <p>Since retiring as a player, Sneijder has returned to the Netherlands and signed on with Eredivisie side Utrecht as part of a business deal. </p>
      <p>“I have a lot of love for this city. Now that I’ve quit playing, I want a nice place to share my experiences,” he told the club’s TV channel in August. </p>
