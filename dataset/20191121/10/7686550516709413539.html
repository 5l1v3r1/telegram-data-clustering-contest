      <p>It's a legendary Cardiff night-time stopping-off point to soak up the excesses of sporting celebrations.</p>
      <p>The Welsh capital's Caroline Street, or 'Chippy Alley' as it's affectionately known, is a takeaway haven for rugby and football revellers seemingly since the first cod took a battering there as far back as the 19th century.</p>
      <p>The street's reputation is referenced in an episode of the blockbuster sitcom Gavin and Stacey.</p>
      <p>And 'Chippy Alley' was the place where Welsh football supporter and student film maker Cameron Lewis captured just what it means to fans and players to reach the finals of Euro 2020 after Tuesday night's 2-0 win over Hungary at the Cardiff City Stadium.</p>
      <p>He spotted Wales stars Sam Vokes and Joe Allen joining supporters in a celebration sing-song on Caroline Street at 3.30am after the game.</p>
      <p>Their impromptu rendition of the new football anthem 'Wales, Golf, Madrid' has gone down a social media storm.</p>
      <p>The chant, of course, emanates from claims that is the order of priority for Wales talisman and captain Gareth Bale.</p>
      <p>The Real Madrid man and his team-mates celebrated on the Cardiff City Stadium pitch with a flag bearing the slogan after marching to the Euros. That has not been received well in Spain, one media outlet dubbing Bale's actions as 'disgraceful.'</p>
      <p>But clearly the Welsh players are getting into the spirit, with midfielder Allen and striker Vokes joining in the chant which will be heard loud across the continent when Wales play at the Euros.</p>
      <p>Explaining the early hours video, Cameon said: "I walked out from the kebab shop and saw them walking down the street and then everyone just starting singing loads of chants with them.</p>

      <p>"It was amazing and felt like a great moment between the fans and the players."</p>
      <p>It wasn't the first time that night Cameron and his friends had bumped into the Welsh players. He said other stars had been spotted celebrating Wales' success at Club Revolution.</p>
