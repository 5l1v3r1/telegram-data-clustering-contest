      <h1>Oxford Dictionary word of the year is 'embarrassing' for GMB host Piers Morgan</h1>
      <h2>The shortlist was dominated by environmental and climate change terms</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T10:20:09+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 10:20</time> by <a rel="author">Max Channon</a></address>
      <p>The Oxford Dictionary has made the phrase 'Climate Emergency' its word of the year - just weeks after Piers Morgan mocked Swedish teenage environmental campaigner Greta Thunberg when she revealed 'Climate Strike' was the Collins Dictionary Word of the Year.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month Piers scoffed: "It’s two words, as you’d know if you spent more time at school and less time striking," when Greta Thunberg, 16, shared a Guardian story revealing 'Climate Strike' had been named the the Collins Dictionary Word of the Year.</p>
      <p>Now, the Oxford English dictionary has made the two-word phrase 'Climate Emergency' its word of the year - which is a bit embarrassing for the Good Morning Britain host, who was editor of the Daily Mirror at the time of the phone-hacking scandal, before he was sacked for publishing fake pictures of British troops torturing Iraqi prisoners.</p>
      <p>The Oxford Word of the Year is a word or expression shown through usage evidence to reflect the ethos, mood, or preoccupations of the passing year, and have a lasting potential as a term of cultural significance.</p>

      <p>The shortlist was dominated by environmental and climate change terms.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, an Oxford University Press (OUP) spokesperson said: "This year, heightened public awareness of climate science and the myriad implications for communities around the world has generated enormous discussion of what the UN Secretary-General has called ‘<i>the defining issue of our time’</i>.</p>
      <p>"But it is not just the upsurge in conversation that has caught our attention.  Research reveals a demonstrable escalation in the language people are using to articulate information and ideas concerning the climate. This is most clearly encapsulated by the rise of <i>climate emergency</i> in 2019.</p>
      <p>"Analysis of language data collected in the Oxford Corpus shows the rapid rise of <i>climate emergency</i> from relative obscurity to becoming one of the most prominent – and prominently debated – terms of 2019.</p>
      <p>"Usage of the phrase <i>climate emergency</i> increased steeply over the course of 2019, and by September it was more than 100 times as common as it had been the previous year.  In fact, it surpassed all of other types of emergency (health, hospital, family, etc.,) to become the most written about <i>emergency</i> by a huge margin, with over three times the usage frequency of <i>health</i>, the second-ranking word.  Statistically speaking, this represents a new trend in the use of the word <i>emergency</i>.</p>
      <p>"Looking at the equivalent data for <i>climate</i> collocations, <i>climate</i> <i>crisis</i> and <i>climate</i> <i>action</i> – both of which are included in our Word of the Year 2019 shortlist – feature alongside <i>climate</i> <i>emergency</i> as the words most typically used to modify <i>climate</i> in 2019. All of these words have exceeded more moderate or speculative pairings like <i>climate variability</i> and <i>climate prediction</i>, and expected connections like <i>climate scientist</i>, which have dominated the usage data for more than 10 years."</p>
      <p>Casper Grathwohl, President of Oxford Dictionaries, said: <i>“</i>This has been a fascinating year for the word “climate”, and we see that reflected especially in the way that English-speakers have combined it with other words. We are clearly struggling to articulate our climate anxiety.</p>
      <p>"Language cannot seem to keep up with the accelerating sense of urgency around the issue, resulting in a rapidly evolving set of vocabulary with a new word vying for center stage at every turn.</p>
      <p>"To reflect this, we’ve not only selected a climate-related word this year—our entire shortlist has been chosen exclusively from the rich climate language surrounding us. Together these words tell the story of a rising issue, and of a public debate attuned to the power of language.”</p>

        <b>THE OXFORD WORD OF THE YEAR SHORTLIST 2019</b>
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
        <i>The OUP says: "Our corpus records a 266% rise in usage over the last year, with a dramatic spike in September documenting demands for climate action by protestors at climate rallies around the globe and media coverage of the gathering of world leaders for the UN’s Climate Action Summit."</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b> </b>
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
        <i>The rejection of the proposition that climate change caused by human activity is occurring or that it constitutes a significant threat to human welfare and civilisation</i>
      </p>
      <p>The OUP says:  "Our data reveals a 153% usage increase for climate denial in 2019, reflecting increased debate over climate science reporting and leading political figures’ reactions to it, and the hardening of language from scepticism to denial, with people typically described as climate science deniers or climate deniers instead of climate sceptics."</p>
      <p>
        <i> </i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>ECO-ANXIETY</b>

        <i>Extreme worry about current and future harm to the environment caused by human activity and climate change</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>The OUP says: "Our corpora record a 4,290% increase in use eco-anxiety in 2019, showing a growing discourse, particularly among young people, around the mental health impact of the climate emergency that has dominated headlines this year."</i>

      <p>
        <i>The OUP says:  "Amidst heightened public attention to the climate emergency and calls for action, the word ecocide has had a 680% increase in frequency of use over 2019. The term is at the heart of a legal campaign to make serious damage to the environment an atrocity crime at the International Criminal Court."</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i> </i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>EXTINCTION</b>

      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
        <b> </b>

      <p>A <i>reluctance to travel by air, or discomfort at doing so, because of the damaging emission of greenhouse gases and other pollutants by aircraft</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>The OUP says: "A translation of the Swedish flygskam, flight shaming is a phenomenon that took off across Europe early this year before going global, resulting in a 182% rise in usage. Growing attention to individuals’ carbon footprints has seen people ditching carbon-intensive air travel for other, greener forms of transport."</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>GLOBAL HEATING</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>A term adopted in place of global warming to convey the seriousness of the climate emergency and the urgent need to address it</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i><i>The OUP says:</i> "In December 2018, Prof Richard Betts, the UK Met Office’s climate research lead, advised: ‘global heating is technically more correct because we are talking about changes in the energy balance of the planet’.   As record-breaking temperatures and concern over the future of the Paris Agreement hit headlines around the world, our data presents an 18,358% usage rise in 2019 over the same period last year."</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>NET-ZERO</b>

      </p>
      <p>
        <i> </i>
      </p>
      <p>The OUP says:  "More than 60 countries have pledged to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. However, as initial analysis indicates urgent action is required to meet this target, debate as to what form the action should take has contributed to a 992% usage rise for the term in 2019."</p>
      <p>
        <b> </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>PLANT-BASED</b>
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>The OUP says:  "From lab-grown chicken to meatless burgers, 2019 has seen increased frequency of discussion of all things plant-based with the trend for clean meat, meat alternatives, vegetarianism, and veganism contributing to the 144% usage increase."</p>
