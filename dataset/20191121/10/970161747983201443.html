        <b><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/rebekah-vardy/">Rebekah Vardy</a> melted the hearts of her Instagram followers by sharing a photo of her baby scan, days after being thrown a surprise shower.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 37-year-old is nearing the end of her pregnancy as she expects her third child with husband Jamie Vardy, and gave her followers a glimpse of the unborn child.</p>
      <p>A close-up shows the baby boy or girl’s face with their features clearly visible, along with the caption: ‘❤️Hello baby…..We can’t wait to meet you ❤️.’</p>
      <p>Rebekah tagged the See Your Baby Instagram account, which offers 4D scans so expectant parents can get a closer look at their unborn child.</p>
      <p>In September, she shared a video of one of her scans which featured the baby’s heartbeat flashing on the screen.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, the former <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/rebekah-vardy-thrown-surprise-baby-shower-ahead-fifth-child-coleen-rooney-feud-11186186/">I’m A Celebrity star was surprised with a baby shower</a> thrown by her sister.</p>

      <p>The party was decorated with bouquets of flowers, personalised balloons and cake-pops.</p>
      <p>‘Such an amazing surprise… Thank you to my amazing Sister. Love you all xxxx,’ Rebekah wrote alongside photos from the special day.</p>

      <p>Leicester City footballer Jamie commented: ‘You deserve it xxxx,’ while her pal Nicola McLean posted a string of love heart emojis.</p>
      <p>Rebekah and Jamie are already parents to daughter Sofia and son Finlay, while the WAG has two children from previous relationships, and Jamie is father to daughter Ella with his ex-girlfriend Emma Daggett.</p>
      <p>It’s going to be quite the large family and we don’t envy the sleepless nights that are coming.</p>
      <p>The last few weeks of Rebekah’s pregnancy haven’t been the easiest, with the WAG finding herself in the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/09/coleen-rooney-hinted-10-months-ago-rebekah-vardy-behind-fake-stories-10888481/">midst of a very public feud with Coleen Rooney</a>, who accused Rebekah’s Instagram account of leaking fake stories about her.</p>
      <p>However, Rebekah vehemently denied being responsible for selling stories to newspapers and has hired a legal team to conduct a thorough investigation.</p>
