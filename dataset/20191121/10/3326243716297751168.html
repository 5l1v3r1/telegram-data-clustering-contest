      <h1>Microsoft delays its truly wireless Surface Earbuds to ‘Spring 2020’</h1>

      <p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/microsoft/">Microsoft</a> took the wraps off several upcoming products, including the <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/2019/10/02/microsoft-surface-earbuds-official/">truly wireless Surface Earbuds</a>.</p>
      <p>These new headphones enter a competitive market already, and while Microsoft billed them primarily as a great tool for the office and enterprise workers, they’ll obviously be used for general use, too. They’re priced at $249, and Microsoft said back in October that the pair of in-ear headphones with a unique design would launch before the end of 2019.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, at the time, we didn’t have anything more to go on in terms of a release date. And now things are getting a bit more vague, as Microsoft’s chief product officer, Panos Panay, has confirmed today via Twitter that the Surface Earbuds have been delayed.</p>
      <p>Panay says that the new headphones will launch sometime in “Spring 2020”, but that’s it. No exact date to circle on the calendar just yet. Panay basically boils the delay down to development time and wanting to give the team(s) working on the Surface Earbuds the time they need to create something great.</p>
      <p>Here’s the tweet:</p>

      <p>Microsoft, during its unveiling of the Surface Earbuds, said the wireless headphones are tuned specifically for voice and music performance, and they even include dictation when using Office apps. The in-ear headphones will reduce noise from the outside world when you’re on a call, thanks to the pair of microphones baked in. The wide circular design boasts tap and swipe gesture support.</p>
      <p>If you were looking forward to Microsoft’s direct response to AirPods and AirPods Pro, you’ll have to wait a bit longer. But the good news is that it’s a global launch in the springtime of next year. Silver linings and all that.</p>
      <p>Are you interested in checking out the Surface Earbuds when they launch? Or is that distinct design something that doesn’t catch your eye?</p>
