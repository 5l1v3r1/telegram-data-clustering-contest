        <i>At present, we are at about Rs 124 ARPU per month. as recently as three plus years ago, our customers were paying about Rs 180-200 for voice services and some data, says <b><a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Rajan-Mathews">Rajan Mathews</a></b>, DG, <b><a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/COAI">COAI</a></b>. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.</i>
      </p>
      <p><b>The Cabinet announced relief for telecom companies’ AGR dues yesterday but some would argue it is more like a band-aid approach where the period to pay the dues was extended by two years. <br/></b>Rajan Mathews: We do not look a gift horse in the mouth. We first of all, want to say thank you to the government for extending this hiatus period by two years. That is one of the early requests that we had made to the government and so the government has given it to us. Obviously, it does impact cash flow. It does not really fix the ultimate problems that we are faced with which is the debt overhang, which needs to be addressed.</p>
      <p>We are requesting the government to look at the whole AGR issue which is the other major factor that we have now on our back, as a result of the Supreme Court order. We have given to the DoT, opinions from Mr Salve as well as Mr Sikri, who is a former Supreme Court judge and who have indicated that there is a way for the government to deal with the AGR ruling of the Supreme Court without violating the Supreme Court diktat.</p>
      <p>DoT should take a look at that and then decide what they want to do in terms of relief to the industry on the AGR dues issue. The industry is doing what it can. We will look at our ARPU and tariffs and see what we can do to alleviate the burden that we face. The combination of these factors is ultimately what I see as the way forward to fix the issue of the telecom sector.</p>
      <p><b>Is there scope for the incumbent players to file a review petition against the Supreme Court AGR ruling?<br/></b>Yes they will probably do it but the bigger review petition is the review petition that is being filed or being contemplated by DoT itself, because there seems to be some unintended consequences of the definition of gross revenue by the Supreme Court which applies to entities other than telecom also. DOT is now looking at that and the government may have a larger issue on its hands and perhaps out of that review and deciding how it will impact other entities may come a solution even for the telecom sector.</p>
      <p><b>We understand that <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/telecom-companies">telecom companies</a> are doing a price hike but the quantum has not come in. Any idea on that?<br/></b>Most analysts and I believe the DoT itself based on some computations that it has done, has indicated that the sector needs 20% or more hike in ARPU. I am not talking about individual tariffs. Tariffs will have to be calibrated to be able to deliver on the ARPU. At present, we are at about Rs 124 ARPU per month. That will have to go close to Rs 150 or more. People say that is a stretch and I am saying is that as recently as three plus years ago, our customers were paying about Rs 180-200 for voice services and some data. Clearly affordability is not the problem in my mind. It is a question of saying how can you make those stick.</p>
      <p><b>If ARPU has to go up by Rs 20, prices do not have to go up by Rs 20 because operating leverage would kick in for companies’ profitability. What could be the quantum of price hike by incumbents which would be bare minimum now?<br/></b>The suggestion that I am making is that you have to look for an increase in ARPU of 20% or more, You have to see how you spread that ARPU. Is it your B2C customers? Is it your B2B customers, the new opportunities in IoT, that will depend upon the individual strategies that the operators have to go to market and to obtain the ARPU.</p>
      <p>My only suggestion is that it needs to go up from about Rs 124-125 to close to Rs 150 plus before true profitability can come back into the sector. It is a combination of that plus the government’s relief on AGR as well. Now you have got some cash flow relief and the combination will begin to set the industry back on its feet.</p>
