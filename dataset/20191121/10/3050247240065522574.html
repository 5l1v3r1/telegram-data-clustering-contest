      <h1>‘Mystery Man’ Gets Berlin Shop to Drop BitPay, Accept Bitcoin Directly</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T10:40:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 10:40</time> by <a rel="author">Marie Huillet</a></address>
      <p>An ice cream shop in Berlin’s trendy Friedrichshain district has revealed that a chat with an unknown “super nice” guy spurred them to spearhead Bitcoin adoption with the local crowd.</p>
      <p>That unknown guy turned out to have been the legendary Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price-index">BTC</a>) evangelist and educator <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/andreas-antonopoulos">Andreas Antonopoulos</a>, as a Nov. 21 Twitter thread from the retailer, “Chipi Chipi Bombón,” <a href="https://twitter.com/ChipiChipiBmbn/status/1197276363373383686?s=20">revealed</a>.</p>
      <h3>Andreas Antonopoulos spreads knowledge</h3>
      <p>Everything began in a local burger bar.</p>
      <blockquote>“We started accepting Bitcoin in June of this year. At Room 77  I met a guy who was super nice &amp; explained to me all the basics about Bitcoin &amp; got me interested in getting BTC myself instead of using BitPay &amp; receiving euros. The next day I found out he was Andreas Antonopoulos.”</blockquote>
      <p>The thread continues to outline that paving the way toward crypto entrepreneurship began with getting a Trezor hardware wallet for cold storage and starting to directly accept Bitcoin via the open-source payment processor BTCPay Server. </p>
      <p>Weeks later, the shop began accepting payments via the second-layer scalability solution <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/lightning-network">Lightning Network</a>, later taking its ice cream and hot chocolate to Berlin’s Lightning Conference. The thread continues:</p>
      <blockquote>“I’m convinced that little shops like ours are a very important factor to bitcoin growth.</blockquote>
      <p>When non bitcoiners see more businesses accepting bitcoin, they will start to stop fearing it and would get more curious about it and would like to be a part of it.”</p>
      <p>The since-exposed Antonopoulos responded <a href="https://twitter.com/aantonop/status/1197322513895825408?s=20">positively</a> on Twitter, writing:</p>
      <blockquote>“You took the effort to fully understand cryptocurrency and the implications of how you could better run your business with it. More small businesses need to do exactly this. Amazing.”</blockquote>
      <p>Judging by other responses to the thread, it cannot hurt the industry’s future that these local Bitcoin pioneers also happen to make “<a href="https://twitter.com/HillebrandMax/status/1197335075425177601?s=20">superb</a>” gelato.</p>
      <h3>Bitcoin Gelato Day</h3>
      <p>Perhaps the most famous culinary crypto anecdote will remain forever associated with <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/what-bitcoin-pizza-day-can-teach-us-today">May 22, 2010</a> — the day the first-ever purchase with Bitcoin was made for an order of two pizzas at a cost of <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=137.msg1195#msg1195">10,000</a> BTC. In today’s prices, that would be an almost $80 million takeaway. </p>
      <p>Today the milestone is celebrated each year as <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-pizza-day-8-years-later-where-can-you-buy-pizza-with-bitcoin">Bitcoin Pizza Day</a>.</p>
      <p>This October, the French national branch of Domino's Pizza launched an ordering competition, offering the winner a prize of <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/dominos-pizza-launches-100k-bitcoin-prize-competition-in-france">$110,000 in Bitcoin</a> or cash.</p>
