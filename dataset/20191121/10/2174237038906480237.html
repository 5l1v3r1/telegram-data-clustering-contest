      <p>Hailing from the frozen wastes of… Melbourne, Australia, <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/the-10-essential-melodeath-albums">melodic black/death</a> metallers King are proof that the efficiently epic, blizzard-scything sounds of <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/my-life-story-satyr-from-satyricon">Satyricon</a> and <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/reviews/immortal-northern-chaos-gods-album-review">Immortal </a>not only know no geographical boundaries, but that they can take on new life when handled by a bunch of extreme scene veterans with skill and vision to spare.</p>
      <p>Three years after their well-received debut, <i>Reclaim The Darkness</i>, the trio – whose collective CV includes Pestilence, The Amenta, Blood Duster, Fuck I’m Dead and a host of other bands – are back with the follow-up, titled with absolute disregard to their local climate, <i>Coldest Of Cold</i>.</p>
      <p>Stuffed with precisely calibrated neck-wreckers, hooks that could land Moby Dick and riffs that will leave you like an arctic cat chasing a laser beam, <i>Coldest Of Cold</i> – released on November 22 via Indie Recordings - still proudly wears its influences on its sleeve, but attains the kind of triumphant peaks only the most seasoned and determined traveller can reach.</p>
      <p>If mountain tops, epic battles in whiteout conditions, and tales of extra-terrestrial terror to boot are your kind of thing, then rejoice, because we are exclusively streaming the album in its full, frostbitten glory below. All hail!</p>
