      <h1>High-level meet: Army chief calls on PM Imran</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T10:56:33+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 10:56</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/8304/rizwan-ghilzai/" target="_blank">Rizwan Ghilzai</a></address>
      <p>Chief of the Army Staff General Qamar Javed Bajwa called on Prime Minister Imran Khan on Thursday.</p>
      <p>During the high-level meeting, sources said the two reportedly discussed matters related to national security.</p>
      <p>This is this second publicised meeting between the two within a span of around a week.</p>
      <p>The prime minister and the army chief had discussed the security situation of the country, including the developments in Indian Occupied Kashmir (IOK) during the last meeting.</p>
      <p>PM Imran had also hailed the Pakistan Army’s efforts to defend the borders while also ensuring internal security and facilitating the ongoing socio-economic development.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, the military spokesperson refuted claims of an alleged divide between the country’s civilian and military leadership, reiterating that both sides are on the same page.</p>

      <p>“This is baseless gossip. There is absolutely nothing of the sort,” said Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Major General Asif Ghafoor as he dismissed speculation that there was a lack of consensus between Prime Minister Imran Khan and Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Qamar Javed Bajwa.</p>
      <p>“The army is supporting a democratically elected government as per the constitution. There will be no let-up in this [support] as it is a must for the progress and prosperity of Pakistan.”</p>
      <p>Maj Gen Ghafoor also shot down assertions that the prime minister and army chief were not communicating as often as they were in the early days of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI)-led government.</p>
      <p>PM Imran and COAS Bajwa had met on November 15 in the first such interaction between the two in recent weeks, particularly against the backdrop of a host of developments — both on the internal as well as external fronts.</p>
