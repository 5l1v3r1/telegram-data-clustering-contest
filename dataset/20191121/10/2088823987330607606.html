        <i>This week, The Buffalo News recounts one of the most memorable storms to strike Western New York. <a href="https://buffalonews.com/topic/wall-of-snow/">Follow along daily</a>.</i>
      </p>
      <p>At 1 a.m. Friday, Nov. 21, 2014, the lake-effect snow warning from the National Weather Service was lifted and the snowfall finally, mercifully, ended.</p>
      <p>Friday was the day to begin assessing what had happened, including determining which community would hold the distinction of greatest amount of snowfall during the back-to-back storms. The winner: Cowlesville in Wyoming County, which was the recipient of an astounding 88 inches of snow.</p>
      <p>Several communities were in shouting distance of that total: Hamburg reached 80.2 inches; West Seneca got to 78; Lancaster, 74; Orchard Park, 71; and South Cheektowaga, 65. All of them spent Friday trying to clear streets and thoroughfares so that residents would be able to take advantage of reopened roadways to restock their shelves with food and medicine.</p>
      <p>For many, Friday was devoted to trying to get roofs clear of snow as buildings of all kinds were in imminent danger of collapse and a reported 30 did cave in.</p>
      <p>A handful of driving bans were lifted, but travel of any kind was still forbidden in several more.</p>

      <p>The death toll, meanwhile, reached 13. And the weather forecast continued to paint a foreboding picture of what was to come over the weekend as snow and cold were about to give way to rain and spring-like temperatures in the 50s or higher.</p>
      <p>“Significant flooding” was possible, according to the weather service, which issued a flood watch that would start on Sunday and run until Wednesday.</p>
      <p>As the storm came to an end, the work to clear out all the snow was continuing. The worrying about what would come next, and whether the region could handle another round, continued.</p>
