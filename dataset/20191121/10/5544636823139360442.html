      <p>The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) on Thursday issued a Certificate of Return to the Bayelsa State Governor-elect, David Lyon.</p>
      <p>Concise News had reported that the commission <a href="https://www.concisenews.global/2019/11/18/inec-declares-winner-of-bayelsa-governorship-election/">had declared Lyon as the winner of the Bayelsa state governorship election</a>.</p>
      <p>The returning officer, Prof. Faraday Orumwese, had announced that the APC candidate polled 352,552 votes to defeat Duoye Diri of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) who polled 143, 172 votes.</p>
      <p>However, in his welcome address, the State Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC), Monday Udoh, congratulated Lyon for winning the election and presented him with the certificate at the commission’s headquarters in Yenogoa, Bayelsa state capital.</p>
      <p>Speaking further, Udoh said the election conducted by INEC was adjudged to be free, fair and credible by election observers and voters.</p>
      <p>Udoh said: “The electoral process which started in May 2019 came with a lot of apprehensions. It followed fears of violence hinged on the outcome of previous elections in the state that were marred by violence and killings.</p>
      <p>“However, through various engagements with stakeholders, civil society groups, alternative dispute mechanism and security agencies, the election was free, fair and credible.”</p>
      <p>Udoh also presented a Certificate of Return to a member of the Bayelsa State House of Assembly representing Brass Constituency 1, Charles Daniel, whose supplementary election was concluded on November 16.</p>
