      <h1>Viewers brand the I'm A Celebrity eating trial 'boring' and say it's 'the same every year'</h1>
      <h2>They've stopped eating live bugs this year…</h2>

      <p>Viewers have called the <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/">I'm A Celebrity</a> eating trial – which saw Roman Kemp and Adele Roberts eat an assortment of bugs and body parts – "boring".</p>
      <p>The infamous trial was a little tamer than usual this year after <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/im-a-celebrity-stars-will-not-be-fed-live-insects-in-bushtucker-trials/">bosses revealed that contestants wouldn't eat live creepy crawlies</a> as it was seen as cruel.</p>

      <p>And, although Roman and Adele took home ten stars from <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/ant-mcpartlin/">Ant</a> and <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/declan-donnelly/">Dec</a>'s Just Desserts trial, viewers were less than impressed.</p>

      <p>After they tucked into a cow's teat, vomit fruit, a pig's uterus and a sundae of cockroaches and mealworms, viewers said the segment was "dull".</p>
