      <p>The 56-year-old, who had been without a club since being sacked by Manchester United in December 2018, has replaced Mauricio Pochettino as Spurs coach.</p>
      <p>His appointment sent shockwaves through England before he sat down with <i>Spurs TV</i> for his first interview as the London team's boss, revealing that he wants to make the club's fans happy and improve his new side's position on the Premier League log.</p>
      <p>"I couldn't be happier and look forward to the challenge," he said.</p>
      <p>"What can I promise? Passion, real passion. Passion for my job, but also passion for my club, that's the way I have been all my career, and I want to try, obviously, everything to bring happiness to everyone who loves the club.</p>
      <p>"In relation to the Premier League, we know where we are and we shouldn't be there. We should just play match after match, and the next match we want to win, which will be the same after the next and the next, until the last.</p>
      <p>"At the end of the season we will see where we are, but I know we will be in a different position from where we are now."</p>

      <p>Mourinho also praised the quality of the Spurs squad, as well as the club's youth academy.</p>
      <p>"I always told about the club's potential," he added.</p>
      <p>"I always told about the qualities of the players, I always told about the magnificent work the club was doing to keep all the good players that the majority of the big clubs in Europe would be looking for.</p>
      <p>"I really like this squad. Of course, I'm not going to say names, I'm not going to tell you individuals because this is completely against my concept of what a team has to be, but I like a lot the ability of the squad.</p>
      <p>"There is not one manager in the world who does not like to play young players and help young players to evolve, there is not one.</p>
      <p>"The problem is sometimes you get into clubs and the work that is below you is not good enough to produce these players, but when you have them, the managers are always happy to develop these players, so I look to our history and you see that the academy is always giving the talent the first team needs.</p>
      <p>"Of course, I also look forward to work with that profile."</p>
