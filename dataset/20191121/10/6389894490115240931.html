      <h1>MUFG likely to deny Softbank loan over Wework bailout</h1>

      <p>Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), Japan’s largest bank, is reportedly likely to withhold additional loans from Softbank to finance the conglomerate’s $9.5bn (£7.3bn) rescue package for struggling office space firm Wework.</p>
      <p>Softbank has asked for around ¥300bn (£2.1bn) additional loans for Japan’s three megabanks – MUFG, Mizuho Financial Group and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group – in a bid to recoup losses from its large bets on Wework, The Financial Times reported. </p>

      <p>The technology investment giant is typically a big borrower from Japanese banks, but is seeking further financing as it attempts to reverse Wework’s flagging fortunes. </p>
      <p>MUFG <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d69e84c0-0c1b-11ea-bb52-34c8d9dc6d84?desktop=true&amp;segmentId=d8d3e364-5197-20eb-17cf-2437841d178a#myft:notification:instant-email:content">may reject</a> Softbank’s request if the new loans are used to bail out Wework, according to the FT.</p>
      <p>Softbank offered Wework a $9.5bn financial lifeline in October following its failed initial public offering (IPO).</p>
      <p>The package involved Softbank providing $5bn of new debt, injecting $1.5bn equity and an offer to buy up to $3bn WeWork shares in exchange for control of the company.</p>
      <p>Softbank had already invested around $10bn in the flexible working space company before the rescue package. </p>
      <p>Although Softbank typically has a close relationship with Japanese banks, the country’s top lenders are becoming more cautious about lending to the group given the current turmoil surrounding Wework.</p>
      <p>“We have to be very careful about this,” a source close to the loan discussions told Reuters. “Especially if the money goes to WeWork, it will take a long time to conclude the process.”</p>

      <p>A Softbank spokesperson told Reuters a loan was one of its options but that nothing had yet been decided. All three banks declined its request for comment. </p>
      <p>Softbank posted its first quarterly loss in 14 years earlier this month after soured bets on Wework and Uber dragged its Vision Fund to an $8.9bn loss.</p>
