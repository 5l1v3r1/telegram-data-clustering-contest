      <h1>No-ball or not? Cummins' wicket sparks debate</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T10:02:02+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 10:02</time> by <a rel="author">ESPNcricinfo staff</a></address>
      <p>A big debate was sparked on the opening day of the <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/19430/scorecard/1183530/australia-vs-pakistan-1st-test-icc-world-test-championship-2019-2021">Gabba Test</a> when third umpire <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/england/content/player/13413.html">Michael Gough</a> allowed <a href="http://www.espncricinfo.com/australia/content/player/489889.html">Pat Cummins</a>' dismissal of <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/pakistan/content/player/323389.html">Mohammad Rizwan</a> to stand, ruling there was no conclusive evidence to call a no-ball on replay.</p>
      <p>After Cummins found Rizwan's edge in the 55th over, the dismissal was sent to the TV umpire, Gough, to check for the no-ball. Numerous slow-mo replays were used, which did not appear to show any part of Cummins' foot behind the line but, eventually, the wicket stood.</p>
      <p>While the convention in the game has been that the benefit of doubt goes to the batsman for line calls, in the scenario of no-balls being checked by the third umpire the ICC instructs umpires to give the benefit of the doubt to the bowler.</p>

      <p>"I'll look at the scoreboard, it says a wicket. It's the closest one I've had. Not sure what happened," Cummins told <i>Cricket 360</i>. "I never like that feeling when they go upstairs after a wicket. Marnus [Labuschagne] said 'that's fine', I wasn't that confident but 100 metres away from the screen it's hard to tell sometimes. I was a little nervous before they put the finger up."</p>
      <p>Waqar Younis, the Pakistan bowling coach, acknowledged it was a tight decision but came down just on the side of Cummins having overstepped. "It's a tough one, it's hard to say it was or wasn't a no-ball. Touch and go, could have gone to either side. When you look at it closely it might be just over the line. To be fair I think it was a no-ball."</p>
      <p>The view in the commentary boxes was that Cummins had got away with the decision. "I think that's the wrong call. I think it's a no-ball and should be recalled," <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/australia/content/player/5392.html">Jason Gillespie</a> said on ABC Radio.</p>
      <p>On Channel 7, <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/australia/content/player/7133.html">Ricky Ponting</a> said: "I had a look at a lot of replays and I could not see any part of his foot land behind the line. <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/australia/content/player/6565.html">Glenn McGrath</a>'s beside me with his fast-bowler hat on saying there's definitely just a millimetre behind the line. I couldn't see it. It has not landed behind the line. Anyway, I'm obviously seeing things."</p>
