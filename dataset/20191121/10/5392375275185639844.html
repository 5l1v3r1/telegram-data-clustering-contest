      <p><a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/huawei/">Huawei</a> MatePad Pro is the company’s next premium tablet offering which will see its official unveiling on November 25 in China. Ahead of the official launch, the tablet is yet again making a round on the internet. This time we’re looking at the official teaser video instead of the leaks and rumors. The Chinese smartphone maker has now posted a short reveal video of the tablet, confirming a few of the specifications.</p>
      <h3>Huawei MatePad Pro Official First Look</h3>
      <p>The surfaced video talks about key specifications of the Huawei MatePad Pro. Five seconds into the video, you can see the dual-camera module at the back situated at the top-right corner. The design, on the other hand, is kept hidden thanks to the attached case which will likely feature a magnetic keyboard. The video also teases the multitasking capabilities of the tablet by showing two active windows at the same time. The user is also seen pushing content from one active window to the other by doing a simple drag and drop. Furthermore, the tablet will come with the support of the M-Pen stylus as confirmed by the video. Lastly, the video also confirms the long-rumored punch-hole display design for the tablet.</p>

      <p>Apart from these, the video does not reveal anything about the slate. Recently, the slate also made an<a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/11/20/huawei-matepad-pro-appears-on-geekbench-reveals-specifications/"> appearance on GeekBench listing</a> revealing specs and scores. To recall, the tablet will come with an octa-core HiSilicon processor clocked at 1.8Ghz (most likely Kirin 990). The chipset is coupled with a 6GB of RAM while there is no information on the onboard memory. The device is expected to run on the latest Android 10 operating system. Coming to the variants, the slate will come in WiFi-only, 4G LTE and likely 5G variant too.</p>
      <h3>Launch Date, Availability</h3>
      <p>Huawei will unveil the MatePad Pro on November 25 in Shanghai, China. Since the launch event is right around the corner, we’re expecting more teasers to come forward by the brand itself in the coming days.</p>
