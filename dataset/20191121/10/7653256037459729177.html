      <p>LONDON/SINGAPORE: <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Oil-prices">Oil prices</a> edged lower on Thursday as fresh tensions between the United States and China over protests in Hong Kong fuelled concern that a deal to end a trade war between the world's top two economies may be further delayed.</p>
      <p><a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Brent-crude">Brent crude</a> fell 44 cents, or 0.7 per cent, to $61.96 a barrel by 0951 GMT, while <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/West-Texas-Intermediate">West Texas Intermediate</a> crude was down 36 cents, or 0.6 per cent, at $56.65.</p>
      <p>Both benchmarks had risen strongly on Wednesday due to bullish data on US crude inventories.</p>
      <p>US President Donald Trump is expected to sign two bills passed by Congress intended to support protesters in Hong Kong. That followed a Reuters report that completion of a "phase one" <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/US-China-trade">US-China trade</a> deal could slide into next year.</p>
      <p>The potential delay could mean the US administration will implement new tariffs on imports from China, escalating the tensions, experts say.</p>
      <p>"Under this scenario, both equities and oil are expected to come under pressure. As talks hit a snag, an upside breakout from the current trading range all of a sudden has become less imminent," Tamas Varga of oil brokerage PVM said.</p>
      <p>However, in an attempt to allay fears, the Chinese commerce ministry said on Thursday that China would strive to reach a "phase one" trade agreement with the United States as both sides kept communication channels open.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, data from the US government's <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Energy-Information-Administration">Energy Information Administration</a> showed US crude stocks had risen by a less-than-expected 1.4 million barrels in the week to Nov. 15.</p>
      <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin said Russia and producer group Opec had "a common goal" of keeping the oil market balanced and predictable, and Moscow would continue cooperation under a global deal cutting oil supply.</p>
      <p>"Russian commitment on an extended supply-curb deal, though supportive of oil prices, will continue to struggle against headwinds on global trade issues," said Benjamin Lu, analyst at Singapore-based brokerage Phillip Futures.</p>
      <p>The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries meets on Dec. 5 in Vienna, followed by talks with allied oil producers including Russia.</p>
      <p>Petroleum Association of Japan President Takashi Tsukioka said Opec and other producers were likely to extend their deal to cut output by 1.2 million barrels per day.</p>
