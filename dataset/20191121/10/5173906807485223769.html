        <b>The 2,3 José Saraiva Elementary School in Leiria closed on 18 November, the coordinator of the S.TO.P - Union of All Teachers (Sindicato de Todos os Professores) said, which is asking for more staff and a travel allowance for teachers.</b>
      </p>
      <p>"According to the professionals of this school, for at least 20 years the school did not close due to a strike. The adhesion was brutal," said the coordinator of S.TO.P, André Pestana.</p>
      <p>The leader explained that adherence to the strike is due to the lack of staff in this school, which "jeopardizes the safety of students".</p>
      <p>"At this school there are 19 staff for 923 students. The ratio is 48.5 operational assistants, much more than double what the Minister of Education is saying. We invite you to come to the real country and see what is going on," challenged André Pestana.</p>
      <p>The coordinator of S.TO.P also regretted that there are teachers who drive 170 kilometres daily: "We have a colleague who is from Figueira da Foz and every day comes here to teach [José Saraiva school] and does not have the full schedule. Earns about 700 Euros and spends 200 fuel and the car" he says.</p>
      <p>"Often it is no longer worth being a teacher and then there is a shortage of teachers in various schools," he insisted.</p>
      <p>Therefore, André Pestana challenges the Government to "give a housing and travel allowance to teachers who are displaced, as is the case with MPs, who earn 3,500 Euros".</p>
      <p>Lack of staff "leads to exhaustion of those on duty" and "issues of violence" arise.</p>
      <p>"This is not a very problematic school, but there is a sense of impunity. We were told that there was often no single official in the school playground," he said.</p>
      <p>André Pestana stressed that S.TO.P "wants to value all education professionals" and has the solidarity of everyone, including parents.</p>
      <p>"There is no fight between teachers and parents. If the teachers are not well, it is the children who are harmed," he said.</p>
