      <p>The Infinix S5 is the company’s latest ‘S’ series smartphone that is usually all about the cameras.</p>
      <p>Recently, Infinix put up the S5 on preorder in Kenya which pointed out to its imminent launch in Kenya.Well, we now have an official launch date for the release of this smartphone.</p>
      <p>The company will officially launch the Infinix S5 on <b>29th November </b>at the University of Nairobi during the 3rd edition of <i>Beat ya Campo </i>which is a singing talent show the company initiated earlier in June this year.</p>
      <p>There will be two main variants of the Infinix S5: The <b>S5 </b>and the <b>S5 lite.</b></p>
      <p>The main difference between the two variants is pegged on the cameras. The S5 has a primary quad camera setup while the S5 lite has a triple camera setup. The S5 has a higher resolution selfie camera than the S5 lite.</p>
      <p>They share the same 6.6 inch 1600 x 720 pixel dense <i>Infinity-O </i>display that has a 90.5% screen to body ratio. The phones ship with Android 9.0 Pie out of the box and are powered by the Mediatek Helio P22 processor. They also both have 4000mAh batteries which has now become standard</p>
      <p>The S5’s quad camera setup includes a 16MP main camera, 5MP wide angle camera that also takes macros, 2MP camera for depth sensing and a QVGA ‘AI’ camera.</p>
      <p>The S5 lite has a triple primary camera setup that is composed of a 16MP main camera, 2MP depth camera and an AI camera. It lacks the wide angle camera on the S5.</p>
      <p>The S5 lite has a regular 16MP selfie camera. However, the S5 has an impressive 32MP unit that does 4 in one pixel binning to create detailed selfies.</p>
      <p>The S5 family also features what Infinix calls the <b>Quetzal design </b>inspired by the Quetzal bird where it mimics the texture of the feather pattern. It is also available in three colours: Quetzal Cyan, Nebula Black and Violet.</p>
      <p>The S5 and the S5 lite will be available in different variants. The S5 will be available in either 64GB/4GB RAM or 128GB/6GB RAM variants for <b>Kshs 16,499</b> and <b>Kshs 20,999</b> respectively. The 64/4 variant is available on <a href="https://techweez.com/2019/11/14/infinix-s5-preorder-kenya/">Xpark website</a> while the 64/4 and 128/6 variants are available in select Infinix outlets countrywide.</p>
      <p>The S5 Lite will be available in either 32GB/3GB RAM or 64GB/4GB RAM variants which will be available <b>exclusively on Jumia</b> for <b>Kshs 13,499</b> and <b>Kshs 13,899</b> respectively from <b>15th December</b>.</p>
