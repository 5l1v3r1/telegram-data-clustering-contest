      <p>Back in October, <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/Samsung">Samsung</a> took the wraps off its Android 10 beta update plan for the Galaxy S10 series. Since then, we’ve seen multiple betas reaching the Galaxy S10 handsets. The 2019 flagship already received four betas in the form of Samsung’s One UI 2.0. The first introduced all the new features within Samsung’s firmware, the remaining three came to address some bugs found by testers. Now, Samsung is <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/yet-another-galaxy-s10-android-10-beta-update-released/">rolling out the fifth Android 10-based One UI 2 beta</a>, and once again it is all about bug fixing.</p>

      <p>The new firmware update bears G97**XXU3ZSKJ serial number and will be available in all the countries where the beta program is currently active. As we said before, it doesn’t bring new features but squashes several bugs in Bluetooth tethering, volume control bar, and status bar. Moreover, it fixes an issue that was preventing the “Call/Text on other devices” from disappearing in the quick panel.</p>
      <p>Rumors indicate that the final stable release of Android 10 will reach all the Galaxy S10 smartphones in December. That sounds pretty accurate, considering the flow of the beta program. Another great hint is that Samsung already pushed the beta for the Galaxy S9. If the company is moving to older smartphones, that means that the update for current devices is almost ready.</p>
