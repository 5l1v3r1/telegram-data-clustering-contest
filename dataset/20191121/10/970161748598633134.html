        <b>The Crazy Rich Asians director has responded to Brenda Song’s claims she was denied an audition for the film for ‘not being Asian enough’.</b>
      </p>
      <p>In a new interview, Brenda, 31, said she was never invited to audition for the hit rom-com which stars Constance Wu, Henry Golding and Gemma Chan.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/brenda-song-dollface">Brenda explained to Teen Vogue</a> that she was disappointed in not being given the opportunity to star in a movie embracing her Asian heritage, but refused to ‘change her past’ to ‘fit in’.</p>
      <p>However, director Jon M Chu has hit back at the claims and says he’s unaware if another member of the production team made the comment about her ‘not being Asian enough’.</p>
      <p>Responding in a series of tweets, the 40-year-old filmmaker said: ‘Nope. I love @BrendaSong and that sucks if anything of that nature was ever communicated. It’s gross actually. The fact is, obviously I know who she is and didn’t need her to audition. I’m a fan of hers! Nothing more nothing less. Bums me out she thought it was anything but.’</p>

      <p>He added: ‘would these words ever come out of my mouth? Nope makes no sense. I feel horrible she thinks this is the reason. The fact is I love Brenda Song and am a fan. I didn’t need her to audition because I already knew who she was!’</p>
      <p>Speaking to the publication, Brenda had said: ‘A lot of people don’t know this, but I never got to read for Crazy Rich Asians, ever.</p>

      <p>‘Their reasoning behind that, what they said was that my image was basically not Asian enough, in not so many words.’</p>
      <p>Brenda felt she was able to relate to the character – presumably the lead protagonist Rachel Chu played by Constance – due to her being in her mid-late 20s and an Asian-American woman.</p>
      <p>The actress told the producers: ‘I’ve auditioned for Caucasian roles my entire career, but this specific role, you’re not going to let me do it?</p>
      <p>‘You’re going to fault me for having worked my whole life? I was like, ”Where do I fit?”’</p>
      <p>The Secret Obsession actress detailed how she then ‘got [herself] together’ and said: ‘“Brenda, there is only one you, and you can’t change who you are. You can’t change your past”.’</p>
      <p>Crazy Rich Asians went on to become one of the biggest box office hits of 2017 and grossed an impressive $238.5 million (£183 million) worldwide. Two sequels are said to be in the works based on the novels China Rich Girlfriend and Rich People Problems, all written by author Kevin Kwan.</p>
