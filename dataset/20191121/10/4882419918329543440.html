      <p>Barça are looking to streamline their squad in January by allowing three or four players to leave. The priority is to reduce the 'overbooking' in midfield but Jean-Clair Todibo has also been made available. Plenty of sides throughout Europe are interested in the young, French centre back but Barça would insist on a buy-back clause being inserted into any deal. Bayer Leverkusen are the favourites to secure his signature.</p>
      <p>Todibo arrived at the Camp Nou last January as a player for the future. He's barely played in the first team but no one doubts his quality. Juventus were previously interested in the defender. Barça are happy to keep Todibo in the first-team picture but the Frenchman knows it is important to play if he's to continue his development.</p>
      <p>Watford were thought to be leading the race but that's all changed since Bayer Leverkusen revealed their hand. The two sides began talking two weeks ago and, although a deal wasn't struck then, the conversations have since reached an advanced stage. Barça are looking to sell Todibo for €10m and retain an option to buy him back for a higher - but acceptable - price. An agreement is close.</p>
      <p>Valverde knows about the situation and has given his blessing to let Todibo leave as he already has three senior centre backs at his disposal. Samuel Umtiti's return to full fitness has essentially closed the door on any playing time which might have been available for the youngster. Ronald Araujo would then be moved to fourth choice centre back.</p>
