      <p>A video of some children skipping in Vietnam has gone viral after it was revealed that ‘the rope’ they were jumping over was actually a dead snake. The video shows two children holding the head and tail of the snake to use it as a rope, while another girl skips over it, laughing.</p>
      <p>A woman’s voice can be heard from behind the camera encouraging the children to play, even as they sing.</p>

      <p>It’s not clear from the video how the children came to obtain the snake, or what kind of snake it was.</p>
