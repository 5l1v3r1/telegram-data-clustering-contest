      <p>“Clueless” captivated filmgoers back in 1995 by telling a modern tale loosely adapted from Jane Austen’s comic novel <i>Emma; </i>now the actual story is coming to the screen.</p>
      <p>Anya Taylor-Joy (“Peaky Blinders”) plays the title role in “Emma”, the directorial debut from Autumn de Wilde, which reimagines Austen’s 1815 novel. A new trailer for the upcoming film was released on Thursday.</p>
      <p>“Handsome, clever, and rich, Emma Woodhouse is a restless queen bee without rivals in her sleepy little town,” reads the film’s synopsis. “In this glittering satire of social class and the pain of growing up, Emma must adventure through misguided matches and romantic missteps to find the love that has been there all along.”</p>

      <p>Earlier this year, Taylor-Joy spoke with the <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/anya-taylor-joy-interview-from-peaky-blinders-to-the-playmobil-movie-the-actress-on-why-she-loves-her-job-w0qpph5jr">Sunday Times</a> about the appeal of her “Emma” role.</p>
      <p>“It’s the idea of portraying that kind of youth,” she explained. “That youth and inexperience — her wanting to play doll’s house with these real people and their real lives, and her understanding, by the end of it, that you can’t.”</p>
      <p>She added: “I do feel that’s incredibly relatable. You know, when you’re a kid, you think you know everything, then there’s a moment when you’re suddenly, like, ‘Wow, I know nothing, Jon Snow! Nothing!’”</p>
      <p>“Emma” opens in theatres on Feb. 21.</p>
