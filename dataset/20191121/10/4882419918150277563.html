      <p>José Mourinho and Tottenham Hotspur could be ready to offer Real Madrid an escape route from their problems with Gareth Bale. According to 'AS', the appointment of Mourinho will see Spurs splash the cash and one of the names on their shortlist is none other than the Welsh wizard himself.</p>
      <p>The interest from Mourinho in Bale isn't new. When the fiery coach was in the Manchester United dugout, he tried - and failed - to lure Bale back to the Premier League. Over the past month, Bale has played more matches for Wales than he has Real Madrid and fans are beginning to tire with what they feel is a lack of commitment.</p>
      <p>Ever since the Welshman arrived in Madrid, he's aided the club in winning several trophies including four Champions League titles. Mourinho wanted Bale to join United in 2017 but, in front of the cameras, said a move for him was impossible "because you don't talk" in reference to Bale needing to force a move out of Madrid.</p>
      <p>Last summer it appeared as if Bale would be playing in the Chinese Super League but that deal fell through after Madrid demanded a higher transfer fee than the club was willing to spend. Now the Premier League is an option again but the player's agent, Jonathan Barnett, has already confirmed that Bale won't be going anywhere until next summer.</p>
