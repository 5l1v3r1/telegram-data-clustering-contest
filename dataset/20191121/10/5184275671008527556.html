      <p>Abhay Deol was last seen in Netflix’s Chopsticks alongside Mithila Palkar, and was hailed for his performance. The actor is currently shooting for his next, the actor just revealed that he slept with his director but calm down, guys! It’s not what you’re thinking!</p>
      <p>Abhay took to his Instagram to share a picture where he can be seen sleeping next to Mahesh Manjrekar, both on different chairs (something that really needs a mention here). He himself created a storm as he captioned the photo as, “I finally did it. I slept with my director. Onset with Mahesh Manjrekar. I’m a @hotstar.”</p>

      <p>Hahaha, as much as his fans found it amusing, various B’Town celebs along with his followers too took to the comment section to leave some hilarious comments.</p>

      <p>While Bipasha Basu, Prateik Babbar, Pallavi Sharda couldn’t stop laughing at the post; some of the following remained highlights of the post:</p>
      <p>One of the user wrote, “I always knew you had it in you”</p>
      <p>“Congratulations! A dream almost come true,” wrote another.</p>
      <p>“Lol and that’s one heck of a comfortable chair where you can also spread your legs,” pointed out a user.</p>
      <p>Another one wrote, “Cool, you did it without a couch”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Abhay could be seen donning the uniform of a cop while Mahesh Manjrekar was in his casuals. The both were peacefully spotted sleeping until Abhay turned the entire situation into a mockery! We love his wit, though!</p>
      <p>Recently, Farhan Akhtar says he was highly impressed with singing skills of his former <i>Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara</i> co-star Abhay Deol, but he requested the actor to not sing after the film’s song Senorita.</p>
      <p>Farhan recently shot for an episode of The Kapil Sharma Show where he cleared some rumours about him.</p>
      <p>During the show, Kapil asked that there was a rumour that Farhan was so impressed with Abhay’s singing in “Senorita” that he offered him to sing all the songs of his upcoming movies.</p>
      <p>Farhan said: “No, this is not true. I was highly impressed with his singing but I didn’t offer him songs from my upcoming movies. Instead, I asked him to not sing any song after ‘Senorita’ so that the exclusivity of the song remains alive.”</p>
