      <h4>Portugal is a country with amazing history and culture, so make sure that you experience it whilst you’re studying there!</h4>
      <p>When you’ve moved away from home to study at university, it can be easy to become quickly homesick, and difficult to adjust to an independent and brand-new lifestyle. If you’re choosing to continue your studies abroad, however, these problems can become even greater as you must quickly adapt to a brand-new way of life miles away from your family. Whilst this is true, you need to conquer all of your fears and make sure that you really take advantage of this opportunity and really make the best of your university studies in Portugal. Here’s how.</p>
      <p><b>Get great accommodation</b><br/>A great way to make the best out of your studies abroad is by getting some of best located and stylish accommodation that you find. You’re going to be spending a lot of time studying in this room, so it’s incredibly important that you choose accommodation that you’re definitely going to love. While there’s lots of choice when it comes to student accommodation in Portugal, you can’t go wrong with choosing <a href="https://www.collegiate-ac.pt/en/">Collegiate</a>. With accommodation in Lisbon and Porto, Collegiate offers luxury accommodation with high-speed broadband and Wi-Fi, a fitness suite, swimming pool and on-site cinema, so you can be sure that your memories of Portugal will never be forgotten.</p>
      <p><b>Don’t be afraid to test out your language skills</b><br/>When you’re in a different country and aren’t too confident with your language skills, it can be easy to be too scared to talk to people for fear of messing up or accidentally offending anyone. However, if you don’t take advantage of the experience and practice your skills, you will not only fail to improve your language skills, but also become increasingly lonely as you will feel as though you won’t be able to talk to anyone. Try not to put too much pressure on yourself and don’t be afraid to make some small mistakes. You may even find that people that <a href="https://www.fluentu.com/blog/portuguese/basic-portuguese-phrases/">you talk to in their native language</a> will appreciate the effort that you have made and you may make some friends that transcend your university years and stick around for a long time. </p>
      <p><b>Make sure that you experience the culture</b><br/>Although you’re there to study and expand your life experiences, you should also take any chance you can to experience the true culture of Portugal. One of the best ways to experience a country’s culture is through its food, and there are few Portuguese dishes that represent Portuguese culture than the bifana. Bifanas are a traditional Portuguese sandwich made with pork which has been marinated and served on a piece of white bread that is crunchy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. Another great way to experience Portuguese culture is by visiting <a href="https://www.planetware.com/tourist-attractions/portugal-p.htm">some of the most famous tourist spots in all of Portugal</a> such as the Convento do Cristo. You don’t want to spend all of your time hauled up in your room, so get out there and experience what Portugal has to offer!</p>
      <p>Portugal is a country with amazing history and culture, so make sure that you experience it whilst you’re studying there! University can be a very stressful time, so take measures to make it one of the best times of your life!</p>
