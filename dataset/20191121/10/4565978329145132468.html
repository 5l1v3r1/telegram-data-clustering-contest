        <b>Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel criticized Wednesday the slow implementation of approved measures to improve the management and performance of socialist state enterprises.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Havana, Cuba.- Speaking at a working session with boards of governments at various levels held at Havana's Convention Center, the President noted that there has been insufficient reaction to implement the methods and that the obstacles that hinder this management are always questioned.</p>
      <p>Nonetheless, he argued that some agility is being achieved.</p>
      <p>"We have been taking steps to replace administrative mechanisms by economic and financial tools, however, we still do not take advantage of all possibilities and continue to see slowness in the establishment of production chains with tourism, foreign investment, non-state sectors," said the president.</p>
      <p>Díaz-Canel reiterated that the importing mentality remains, because establishing the needed production chains requires thinking, incentives, structures, and creativeness to encourage them, and these are elements that can lead to solid companies with true sovereignty.</p>
      <p>The President urged participants at the meeting to oversee that everything that is approved is implemented because there is a need to demonstrate the viability, the success of the state-owned company as a fundamental entity of the island's economy.</p>
      <p>And all this, he said, has been done in a particularly complex scenario of tightening of the blockade, financial persecution, coupled with the tense political situation in the area. Hence the importance, he emphasized, of maintaining unity, not allowing fractures or give way to interference or manipulation.</p>
      <p>During the meeting, the President reiterated the need to continue with an adequate ideological work in the workers' collectives, while underlining the work of the Government Boards as representatives of the State before the business sector: "Your function is not to carry out tasks, but to lead processes. It is a question of evaluating, proposing, without space for the diversion of resources, the botched jobs...".</p>
      <p>In his recommendations, he returned once again to the role of the cadres, and pointed out that it is necessary to identify the best prepared; and he also referred to the need to sustain the commitment to savings measures implemented to overcome the fuel crisis, which has affected the country.
