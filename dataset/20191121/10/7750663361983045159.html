      <p>The 56-year-old <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/spurs/news/tottenham-confirm-jose-mourinho-as-new-manager_379969.html">was announced as the new Spurs boss</a> on Wednesday less than 24 hours after <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/mauricio-pochettino/"><b>Mauricio Pochettino</b></a> received his marching orders from the club.</p>
      <p>Mourinho faces the prospect of losing the aforementioned trio for free over the summer due to their contracts expiring in June.</p>

      <p>Chairman <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/daniel-levy/"><b>Daniel Levy</b></a> is concerned by the prospect of each player being free to speak with other clubs and sign a pre-contract agreement in January.</p>
      <p>It is claimed that Eriksen, Vertonghen and Alderweireld are all open to the prospect of working with Mourinho, who they view as a serial winner.</p>
