      <h3>POLICE have not monitored any imminent threat to the 30th Southeast Asian (SEA) Games which will be hosted by the country from November 30 to December 11 but security forces are not taking any chances and are beefing-up all counter-terror measures.</h3>
      <p>“Imminent? None. But the evaluation continues. We do not stop evaluating,” Philippine National Police Officer-in-Charge, Lieutenant General Archie Francisco F. Gamboa said as he graced the send-off ceremony for members of the Task Group NCR that will secure the SEA Games events in Metro Manila.</p>
      <p>PNP Intelligence Group agents under Brigadier Gen. Edgar S. Monsalve are coordinating with different police and military intelligence units their monitoring of the day-to-day situation in the areas where the SEA Games events will be held as well as the rest of the country,</p>
      <p>National Capital Region Police Office director, Brig. Gen. Debold M. Sinas said that they will go on full alert starting Sunday until December 14 as part of their security measures for the Games.</p>
      <p>Gen. Gamboa, however, assured the public that peace and order in Metro Manila, Central Luzon, Calabarzon region and La Union province will still be a main concern of the police force.</p>
      <p>The PNP-OIC said they have ordered all concerned police regional directors to beef-up their foot and mobile patrols and conduct of checkpoints to help arrest the presence of armed criminals.</p>
      <p>“We have instructed the concerned, different regional directors for the SEA Games to continue enforcing the laws. We have told them that the conduct of SEA Games will not be a reason to relax as we expect a lot of criminals to take advantage,” Gen. Gamboa said.</p>
