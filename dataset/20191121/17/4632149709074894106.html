      <p><b>Hyderabad</b>: CCTV footage of a man praying before and after stealing crown of Goddess Durga in a temple in Hyderabad has gone viral on social media platforms. <br/><br/>The theft took place at Durga Bhavani temple at Gunfoundry area in Hyderabad’s commercial centre Abids on Wednesday. <br/><br/>The thief in white trousers and blue shirt entered the sanctum sanctorum much before the priest’s arrival and completed his job. The priest was surprised to see the crown missing and asked the manager if he had sent the ornaments for cleaning. The manager was shocked and the duo verified the CCTV footage. They found the thief’s deed. <br/><br/>The thief entered inside the temple and offered prayers for a few seconds. He also does sit ups and touches the idol. In between, he is watchful if anybody is coming. <br/><br/><br/>When he is sure that nobody is in the vicinity, he pulls the silver crown. He then struggles a bit to removes the thread. He again prays to the Goddess before hiding the crown behind his shirt. <br/><br/>The Abids police have registered a case of theft (Indian Penal Code section 380) and began the investigation.</p>
