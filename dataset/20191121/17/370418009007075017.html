      <h1>Mick Mars Said He Would Invite “The World To Come For Free” If Mötley Crüe Reunited</h1>
      <h2>A 2014 interview, in which Mick Mars offered for “the world to come for free” if Mötley Crüe ever got back together, has surfaced.</h2>

      <p>We’re still wrapping our heads around the fact that <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/m%C3%B6tley-cr%C3%BCe/">Mötley Crüe</a> are officially back together, having <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/the-news/m%C3%B6tley-cr%C3%BCe-release-official-statement-announcing-their-return/">blown up</a> their famous cessation-of-touring contract earlier in the week. And though no official live dates have been announced just yet, it turns out there will be no need to worry about saving up for tickets anyway, because Mick Mars said that the entire <i>world</i> could come for free. Pretty generous offer, eh?</p>
      <p>That’s right, in a newly-surfaced video from 2014, the guitarist is seen being interviewed on The Metal Show and discussing the band’s ‘final’ tour (which culminated on December 31, 2015). Co-host Don Jamieson tells Mick that he’s going to be attending, “but if it’s not the final tour, I’ll go see the next one too. If they tour 10 more times, I’ll see all 10 tours.”</p>
      <p>Then comes a very bold and surprising statement from Mick Mars: “Let me put it this way: if that happens, I will invite the world to come for free.”</p>

      <p>Reposting the interview on his Twitter, Don wrote: “I always said they’d be back. My redemption tour starts today. And great news… free tix for all Mötley Crüe fans!”</p>
      <p>While co-host Eddie then added: “Wow! This is amazing! What a fun episode this was with Mick Mars… but I totally forgot he said this… until a caller reminded me today. Well here’s one tour that won’t be expensive I guess <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FreeTicketsToTheWorld?src=hashtag_click">#FreeTicketsToTheWorld</a> thx to <a href="https://twitter.com/ThatMetalShow">@ThatMetalShow</a>!”</p>

      <p>While the Crüe are yet to announce their official live plans just yet (and indeed, if they are going to invite billions of people to come along at no charge), in a statement announcing their return they told fans that they came to the decision to reunite because there’s “a whole new generation of Crüeheads relentlessly demanding for the band to come back together”.</p>
      <p>Having seen a “massive surge in new audience” following this year’s Netflix biopic The Dirt, the band – Vince Neil, Nikki Sixx, Mick Mars and Tommy Lee – noted that “the fuse was lit” for a return, and consequently blew up the legal documentation that was preventing them from playing live together again.</p>
