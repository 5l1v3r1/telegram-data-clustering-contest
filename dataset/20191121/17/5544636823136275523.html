      <p>The Federal High Court sitting in Abuja, on Thursday, stepped down proceedings in the continuation of trial of Abdulrasheed Maina, who chaired the defunct Pension Reform Task Team (PRTM) due to his failing health.</p>
      <p>Concise News reports that the presiding Judge, Justice Okon Abang, asked Maina to then take his medication after Francis Orasanye, the lawyer to the Maina, had told the court that his client was bleeding.</p>
      <p>It was learned that when the matter was called, Maina, who was sitting with families and officers of the Nigerian Correctional Services, was assisted up by two of the officers, so as to be taken to the dock by Oronsaye.</p>
      <p>“My Lord, my client is bleeding and I will seek your indulgence to allow him take his medication,” Orasanye said.</p>
      <p>But when the court resumed proceedings, Maina’s lawyer said he wanted to make an application informing the court that when the court rose at the insistence of the defence the first defendant’s health condition became worse.</p>
      <p>Oronsaye asked the court for an adjournment to sometime next week and the date for tomorrow vacated as well to allow Maina seek proper medical attention.</p>
      <p>In his ruling, Justice Abang said: “A person cannot perform drama in court to frustrate a case.</p>
      <p>“The frustration of proceedings caused by the 2nd defendant counsel will not be tolerated again,” he said.</p>
      <p>He added that the case will be adjourned till the 25th of November, at the instance of the parties in the case.</p>
      <p>“Anybody who attempts to frustrate this case again will make me exercise the powers vested on me bu the court and I will order the police to remove such a person from the courtroom and the proceedings shall continue in his absence,” he warned.</p>
      <p>The Department of State Services (DSS) had, on 30 September, 2019, arrested Maina at an Abuja hotel and subsequently handed them over to the EFCC on 2 October for further investigation and prosecution on allegations of fraud and money laundering to the tune of N2.1 billion.</p>
      <p>The Federal Civil Service Commission dismissed him in 2013 for “absconding from duty” but he returned to the country in 2017 and was reinstated as a director in the interior ministry.</p>
