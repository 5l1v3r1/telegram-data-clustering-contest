      <h2>Mum of three Stacey Jones pulled off the stunning transformation using products picked up from major high street shops and a little creativity - and her son loves it</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T17:12:51+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 17:12</time> by <a rel="author">James Andrews, http://www.facebook.com/jameswritesmoney/</a></address>
      <p>Stacey Jones' son Huey is dinosaur mad, but with a small budget she had to get creative to pull off a room fit for his obession.</p>
      <p>So the 39-year-old from Manchester set out on a hunt to find or make the perfect pieces to complete her stunning transformation.</p>
      <p>"His bedroom is only small so painting mountains on the wall instead of using wallpaper kept the cost low and the room feeling light even though I’ve used green tones which could easily have made the room feel smaller," Stacey told money-saving site <a href="https://latestdeals.co.uk/">LatestDeals.co.uk</a> .</p>
      <p>"All the DIY was done by myself including the upcycle of the Ikea chest of drawers; I painted those in the same shades as the mountains on the wall and added plastic toy dinosaurs as the handles."</p>
      <p>Stacey also hit up budget stores to find what she needed - nabbing a large T-Rex head for £6.99, dinosaur bedding from Primark for £9 and a dinosaur cuddly toy from Argos for £2.25. </p>

      <p>Stacey, who is also mum to Honey, 13 and Harmoni, 11, and Huey,  was also keen to keep things natural.</p>
      <p>"I wanted a lot of natural tones and fabrics to compliment so the use of jute and wicker and the natural pine bed really stands out against the green," she said.</p>
      <p>"Foliage and lights were added to the teepee bed and the dino feet stickers on the floor add to the dino jungle theme."</p>
      <p>And she has tips for people looking to pull off a similar transformation.</p>
      <p>“My tips would be to use the same paint used on the walls to up cycle the drawers to keep costs low, and also to keep everything matching," she said.</p>
      <p>"Don’t buy expensive drawer handles - I'd seen dinosaur ones for around £30 to £40 and I managed to make my own for £6.</p>
      <p>"Source cheap artificial plants that you can cut up and use as the foliage on the bed frame as it works out much cheaper than buying the longs strands of faux ivy and so on."</p>

      <p>And it's fair to say mother and son are happy with the finished effect.</p>
      <p>"I feel so proud of what I managed to achieve on a small budget and best of all I got the seal of approval from Huey who tells me he loves his dinosaur bedroom every day!” Stacey said.</p>
