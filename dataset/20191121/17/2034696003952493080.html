      <p>During the interview, it’s reported that “talk of a third season of <i>Mindhunter</i> is on hold while Fincher focuses on his next feature.”</p>

      <p>A third season of <i>Mindhunter</i> has never been confirmed by Netflix, but Fincher has previously said that he expects the show to run for five seasons or more.</p>
      <p>Holt McCallany, who plays Groff’s co-star Bill Tench on the show, spoke to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/holt-mccallany-mindhunter-season-2-david-fincher-visiting-real-life-killers-1231758"><i>THR</i></a> about the future of the show, and revealed that Fincher has grand plans for <i>Mindhunter</i>.</p>
      <p>“He said ‘Listen, are you ready to do this for five seasons? Because even if I fuck it up, it’s gonna go five seasons, and I don’t intend to fuck it up’,” McCallany revealed.</p>
      <p>“So I’d like to think that we will continue, for as long as David is intrigued by telling this particular story.”</p>
