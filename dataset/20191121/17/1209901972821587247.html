      <p>Farm Credit Canada (FCC) wants to empower women in agriculture by providing them tools to improve their leadership skills at its brand new series of events, FCC Women in Ag Summit.</p>
      <p>FCC Women in Ag Summit is a series of five free events offered across Canada for women who are actively involved in a farm operation and want to learn, connect, be inspired and share their common love for the industry.</p>
      <p>The cross-Canada events allow women to hear from a lineup of high-profile speakers. The events are a great networking opportunity and women will leave feeling inspired, ready to set new goals personally and professionally.</p>
      <p>“Our strong lineup of speakers will empower, inform, and engage women of any age, no matter what role they play in Canada’s ag industry,” said Sophie Perreault, executive vice-president and chief operating officer at FCC.</p>
      <p>“As the only financial institution entirely dedicated to Canadian agriculture, this is one of the many ways FCC gives back to the industry that feeds the world.”</p>
      <p>In the coming months, FCC Women in Ag Summit will feature presentations from: Vanessa Stockbrugger, financial educator and coach, Anna De Paoli, management consultant and professional negotiator, Toni Newman, professional innovation catalyst, Dr. Jody Carrington, psychologist, author and game-changer, Jessica Holmes, comedian, author and mental health advocate and Michelle Hillier, emcee, movement and dance educator.</p>
      <p>“Courage is the key to self-empowerment,” said Toni Newman, one of the summit speakers. “More often than not, the only thing standing between your dreams and where you are today is the courage to let go of the past and move forward.”</p>
      <p>The closest FCC Women in Ag Summit event will take place from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. on Dec. 5th in Edmonton. Others summits are being held in Regina, Kitchener, Saint-Hyacinthe, Quebec and in Halifax next year.</p>
      <p>Launched in the spring of 2019, FCC’s new Women Entrepreneur Program supports women entrepreneurs involved in the agriculture and agri-food sector by providing the capital they need to grow their business, along with the meaningful skill development opportunities they are seeking.</p>
      <p>The program includes access to capital through the Women Entrepreneur Loan, enhanced learning events like the FCC Women in Ag Summit, partnerships with other groups, and delivery of online content to support their needs.</p>
      <p>FCC has committed $500 million over three years for the Women Entrepreneur Loan. As part of the loan, borrowers can have a portion of their fees waived and are encouraged to reinvest these savings into both personal and professional development that best suits their individual and business needs.</p>
      <p>The five FCC Women in Ag Summit events complement eight Young Farmer Summit events and more than 60 FCC workshops that are taking place across the country this fall and winter. Participants can register online at www.fcc.ca/events or by calling 1-888-332-3301.</p>
      <p>People are encouraged to sign up early to reserve their spot as these events fill up quickly.</p>
