      <h2>Cheng says he made filmed confession to ‘soliciting prostitution’ under pressure</h2>

      <p>The Chinese police published on Thursday a video purporting to show a former employee of the British consulate in Hong Kong confessing to soliciting prostitutes, after Britain backed his allegation that he was tortured over pro-democracy protests.</p>
      <p>The case has added to tensions between Beijing and London over the demonstrations that have roiled the former British colony for months.</p>
      <p>Simon Cheng, a Hong Kong citizen, said on Wednesday he was beaten by secret police while he was detained in Shenzhen for 15 days in August.</p>
      <p>Mr. Cheng said in a statement on Facebook that police had accused him of being a British spy and questioned him about London’s role in protests.</p>
      <p>Mr. Cheng said he felt he had no choice but to make a filmed confession to “soliciting prostitution”, a charge he said was offered by police as an alternative to “indefinite criminal detention”, and that he had not been allowed to contact his family.</p>
      <p>Police on Thursday posted a video on Weibo, purporting to show Mr. Cheng entering and leaving a room in a “clubhouse” multiple times.</p>
      <p>Mr. Cheng said he had “got a massage for relaxation after work hours”.</p>
