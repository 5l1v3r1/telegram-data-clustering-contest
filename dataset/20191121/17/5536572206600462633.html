      <p>Things got hot on the set of First Take on Thursday morning.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, Stephen A. Smith shared a text message from Terrell Ownes that bashed him for his comments about Colin Kaepernick following the workout on Saturday in Atlanta.</p>
      <blockquote>“T.O. — Terrell Owens — just sent me a text. ‘You have no idea what you’re talking about. You’re quick to bash. That’s why people say what they say about you.’ Even T.O. is on my case right now. You know, I will respond to him and all the folks that feel the way that they feel in just a second. Because there’s a whole lot of people that are coming at me with emotion. I’m going to come at folks with facts,” Smith said Tuesday on the show.</blockquote>
      <p>On Thursday morning, Owens came in to speak directly to Smith and things got heated when T.O. stated Max Kellerman was blacker than him because of his commentary in support of Colin Kaepernick compared to what Smith has been saying.</p>
