      <p>The Tories raked in an eye-watering £5.67 million from big cash donors in the first week of the general election – compared to Labour’s £218,500.</p>
      <p>The six largest parties raised a combined total of £6.5 million in donations over £7,500, but 87% of that went straight to the coffers of the Conservative party.</p>
      <p>Cash boosts from millionaire entrepreneurs, a private hospital owner, a Russian banker and property developers allowed <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/boris-johnson/">Boris Johnson</a>’s party to raise 26 times more than Labour in donations.</p>
      <p>Jeremy Corbyn’s party received even less than the Lib Dems who pocketed £275,000, and the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/brexit/">Brexit</a> Party who took in £250,000.</p>
      <p>The figures were published in a weekly pre-election report by the electoral commission.</p>
      <p>However, they do not show the full picture of the parties’ election finances, as smaller donations under £7,500 don’t have to be recorded.</p>

      <p>Both Labour and the Brexit Party have previously celebrated raising vast sums through smaller personal donations, often made online.</p>

      <p>A breakdown of the payments to all parties shows the largest single contribution came from billionaire John Gore, who donated £1 million to the Conservatives.</p>
      <p>The Broadway-based theatre producer has previously been dubbed the Tories ‘most generous donor’, giving £1.5m to the party in the final quarter of 2018.</p>
      <p>The next three largest donors were the travel company Trailfinders, Countrywide Developers and WA Capital, who each gave £500,000  to the party.</p>

      <p>Other Tory donors include Russian banker Lubov Chernukhin, who donated £200,000.</p>
      <p>The wife of a former Putin ally, she hit the headlines earlier this year when she was pictured having a ‘ladies night’ with former PM Theresa May after donating £135,000 to the party.</p>
      <p>Seven of the Tories’ donors contributed more in one single donation than all of Labour’s donations combined.</p>
      <p>Half of Labour’s donations over £7,500 came from Unite the Union, whose largest single contribution was £62,000.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the Brexit Party’s £250,000 was raised in one donation alone.</p>
