      <h2>Meghan Markle and Prince Harry gave emotional interviews in their TV documentary, but insiders say it hasn't changed their relationship with Kate Middleton, Prince William and other members of the Royal Family</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T17:52:02+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 17:52</time> by <a rel="author">Zoe Forsey, https://www.facebook.com/zoeforseymirror/</a></address>
      <p>No members of the Royal Family have been checking in or speaking to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/meghan-markle">Meghan Markle</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/prince-harry">Prince Harry</a> despite their emotional TV documentary, a source has claimed.</p>
      <p>The couple gave a series of interviews during the programme, which focused on their trip to South Africa earlier this year, during which they said they were struggling with life in the spotlight.</p>
      <p>Despite Meghan directly saying people weren't checking if she was okay, insiders have claimed nothing has changed between the couple and the rest of the family.</p>
      <p>An insider told <a href="https://people.com/royals/prince-harry-and-meghan-markles-relationship-with-royal-family-remains-tense-after-documentary/">People magazine</a> said: "There hasn’t been this complete 180, nothing has changed. They don’t speak, no one is checking in, no one is texting."</p>
      <p>Multiple sources also told the magazine that the "chill" between the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry and Meghan Markle "runs deeper than many outsiders realise".</p>

      <p>In the documentary Harry <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/prince-harry-says-william-different-20661918">appeared to confirm rumours of a rift between him and his older brother</a> .</p>
      <p>He told ITV News anchor Tom Bradby: "Part of this role and part of this job and this family being under the pressure that it’s under ­inevitably, you know, stuff happens.</p>
      <p>“But look, we’re brothers. We’ll always be brothers.</p>
      <p>"We’re certainly on different paths at the moment but I will always be there for him and as I know he’ll always be there for me.</p>

      <p>“You know, we don’t see each other as much as we, as much as we used to because we’re so busy.</p>
      <p>"But, I love him dearly and, you know, the majority of the stuff is created out of nothing.</p>
      <p>"Just as I said, as brothers, you know, you have good days, you have bad days.”</p>
      <p>According to the magazine, a number of insiders have said their relationship started to struggle when Harry said he planned to marry Meghan after they had been dating for less than a year.</p>
      <p>The older brother warned him that things were moving too quickly, which upset Harry.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month it was revealed that Meghan and Harry won't be spending Christmas Day with the Royal Family, instead deciding to spend it with the Duchess' mum Doria.</p>
      <p>Kate and William have spent two Christmases with her family, so it's not unusual, however many experts believe the timing of the Sussexes decision says a lot about what's going on behind the scenes.</p>
