      <p>Spencer James, founder of Whataretheodds.co.uk explained: ‘Since the first season in 2002, I’m a Celeb has continued to increase in popularity, becoming one of the most watched British TV shows of all time. There just seems to be something about watching celebrities in discomfort that captivates the nation.</p>
      <p>‘So, why do these celebs put themselves in this position for three weeks? Our research shows just how much of a positive impact appearing on the show has on a celeb’s career, even if, as in Scarlett’s case, it ends up being short-lived! Some contestants have gone on to do absolutely nothing since the show while others have completely transformed flagging careers. It will be interesting to see how the contestants fair after their stint in the jungle this year.’</p>
