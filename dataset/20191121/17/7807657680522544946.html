      <h2>I've resisted the call of Fortnite thus far, but I can't anymore.</h2>

      </p>
      <p>I've managed to keep the call of <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fmicrosoft.msafflnk.net%2Fc%2F159229%2F433017%2F7593%3FsubId1%3DUUwpUdUnU72025YYw%26subId2%3Ddwp%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.microsoft.com%252Fen-us%252Fp%252Ffortnite-battle-royale%252Fbt5p2x999vh2&amp;token=M7Cf2qwg">Fortnite</a> at bay so far, but I don't think that's possible anymore. Battle royale, the game's most popular mode, never really appealed to me (likely because I'm terrible at PvP shooters). But now that <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/fortnite-save-world-adds-dungeons-game">dungeons are here</a>, I'm very close to being sucked in by the hype.</p>
      <p>The dungeons are available now in Fortnite's PvE <i>Save the World</i> mode. This is the mode that originally appealed to me way back when Epic Games first teased Fortnite, but it was quickly overshadowed by the free-to-play Battle Royale mode. I'm not sure why I never gave <i>Save the World</i> a shot before now, but it probably comes down to a cynical urge to not give in to the game's surging popularity.</p>
      <p>All of that is out the window now. If there's anything I like in a game, it's dungeon crawling. Sure, there are <i>better</i> dungeon crawlers out there, but there's something about the mix of Fortnite's goofy premise and colorful aesthetic that makes me want to dive in with some friends and smash my way to glorious loot.</p>

      <p>I've had my fill of hardcore dungeon crawling as a raider in World of Warcraft back in the day, and I'm holding off on jumping back into Diablo until <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/diablo-iv">Diablo IV</a> hits the scene (it looks <i>phenomenal</i>, by the way). Right now, I'm totally into taking on something a lot more lighthearted where I don't <i>have</i> can simply shoot, smash, and loot.</p>
      <p>So, for now, you'll find me joyously cruising through Fortnite's four dungeons. Will it be enough to hold me over for now? Who knows. Hopefully Epic Games already has some follow-up dungeons in the pipeline.</p>
      <p>If anything, it'll help me avoid emptying my wallet on the coming <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/deals">deluge of Black Friday deals</a> as I tune out the rest of the world and take down some husks. The only thing that'll suffer is my gaming backlog, but I'm okay with that for now.</p>
