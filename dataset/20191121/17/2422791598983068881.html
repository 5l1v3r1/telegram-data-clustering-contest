      <p>MEXICO CITY -- Mexico's murder rate inched up 2 per cent in the first 10 months of the year, but the latest violence has included much more brazen challenges to authorities.</p>
      <p>Federal officials said late Wednesday there have been 29,414 homicides so far in 2019, compared to 28,869 in the same period of 2018.</p>
      <p>But northern border cities like Ciudad Juarez and Nuevo Laredo have seen a constant round of drug gang blockades recently, with gunmen burning buses and trucks to block roads and bridges.</p>
      <p>The governor of the border state of Tamaulipas, where Nuevo Laredo is located, says the gangs have committed acts of "narcoterrorism."</p>
      <p>Gov. Francisco Garcia says the gangs used civilians as "human shields."</p>
      <p>President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said his administration had managed to "stabilize" the rise in killings.</p>
