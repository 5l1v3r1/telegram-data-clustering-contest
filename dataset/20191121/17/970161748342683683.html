        <b>Frankie Boyle couldn’t help out the timeliness of David Walliams new children’s book The Beast of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/buckingham-palace/">Buckingham Palace</a> amid <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/prince-andrew-duke-of-york/">Prince Andrew</a>’s sex scandal.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Whether it’s a coincidence or not, the release of David’s book gave people a good laugh considering Prince Andrew has been questioned about his relationship with paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
      <p>David tweeted out a snap of his new book, along with the caption: ‘My brand new book #TheBeastOfBuckinghamPalace is out TODAY! Join me on a magical journey through a futuristic London, where mythical beasts roam the halls of Buckingham Palace… I hope you all love it!’</p>
      <p>We don’t know whether the 48-year-old comedian realised the connection, but Frankie sure did.</p>
      <p>He retweeted and said: ‘As they say, the secret of comedy is timing.’</p>
      <p>The Duke Of York <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/prince-andrew-done-much-queens-second-son-get-paid-11192953/">came under the spotlight over his relationship with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein</a>, who died in jail in August this year.</p>

      <p>He broke his silence during an interview with BBC Newsnight last weekend, in which he sat with Emily Maitlis to answer questions on his friendship with the former financier.</p>

      <p>The Prince was then given permission by the Queen to step down from his riyal duties and said in a statement that it was ‘clear’ that the former association had become ‘a major disruption to my family’s work and the valuable work going on the many organisations and charities that I am proud to support.</p>
      <p>‘Therefore, I have asked Her Majesty if I may step back from public duties for the foreseeable future, and she has given her permission.’</p>
      <p>24 hours later, David released a book with a rather fitting name.</p>
      <p>The Beast of Buckingham Palace had people questioning (and even enjoying) his move, and many couldn’t help but joke about the situation.</p>
      <p>One fan tweeted: ‘Subtitle : The boy who couldn’t sweat?’</p>
      <p>‘Does the story begin in Pizza Express?’ another tweeted.</p>
      <p>The Little Britain star has yet to comment on whether the well-timed release of his book was intentional or not, but that’s not going to stop everyone else from believing so.</p>
