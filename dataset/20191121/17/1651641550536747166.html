        <b>If you’ve logged into Tumblr using <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/google-chrome-close-other-tabs-option-back/">Google Chrome</a> recently and found that your New XKit extension is stuck forcing extension updates, you’re not alone. However, it’s easy to fix, and we’ve got all the instructions below.</b>

      <p>All you need to do is navigate over to New XKit’s permissions in Chrome and make sure that the extension can reach GitHub’s servers.</p>
      <p>To make things even easier, I’ve laid it out step by step below:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Right-click on New XKit in Chrome.</li>
        <li>Click on “Manage Extensions”</li>
        <li>Scroll down to “Site Access”</li>
        <li>Make sure that the access switch for https://new-xkit.github.io/* is flipped to on.</li>
        <li>Return to Tumblr and refresh the page.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>After you’ve refreshed, New XKit should finally update itself and you should be able to get back to blogging about whatever you want!</p>
      <p>If the above method doesn’t work and you’re sure you’ve followed the steps exactly, you can also try the slightly more extreme method of uninstalling and reinstalling New XKit.</p>
      <p>A fresh install should automatically grant the extension site access to GitHub, meaning you don’t need to follow the above instructions, but be warned: it will completely erase your XKit configuration and you’ll have to start over again.</p>
      <p>Unless you have an XCloud backup handy or if you have your settings memorised, we recommend trying out the Site Access fix before doing anything drastic.</p>
      <p>If the Site Access Fix doesn’t work and reinstalling New XKit doesn’t work, make sure that your version of Google Chrome is up to date and then try the fixes again.</p>
      <p>If all of that doesn’t work, then we recommend joining the <a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/PRuQmgb">New XKit Discord server</a> to check for any updates and share your XKit-related issues.</p>
      <p>This whole ‘New XKit forcing extension updates indefinitely’ problem should only affect those who are using the extension on Google Chrome. If you’re using any other browser, you should be completely fine and able to keep on blogging on a more structurally sound site thanks to New XKit.</p>
