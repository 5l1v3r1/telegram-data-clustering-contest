      <p>Nov. 21 (UPI) -- Kimberly Van Der Beek says she's healing in the wake of her near-fatal miscarriage.</p>
      <p>Van Der Beek, 37, the wife of actor <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/James_Van_Der_Beek/?tps=1">James Van Der Beek</a>, gave an update Wednesday on Instagram Stories after almost losing her life during a miscarriage over the weekend.</p>
      <p>Van Der Beek appeared in a video with one of her daughters and thanked friends and fans for their support.</p>
      <p>"Thank you so much for all the love," the mom-of-five said. "I'm so grateful for it. A lot of you have asked how I'm feeling physically. I'm healing. I am definitely healing."</p>
      <p>"My biggest thing is my blood pressure. I just get very light-headed very easily, so I can't really get up and walk around for more than a couple minutes right now," she shared. "A lot of blood transfusion action this weekend, so I'm just taking it super easy, trying to restore and build my blood."</p>
      <p>Van Der Beek said she has over 400 voice and text messages from well-wishers but is keeping away from her phone right now.</p>
      <p>"Emotionally, I have a lot of love around me. I just want to say to my friends, thank you for the outpouring," she said. "If I haven't gotten back to you, I probably haven't even seen your message or heard it, but I'm just so grateful for all of them and all of the love."</p>
      <p>James Van Der Beek announced on Monday's episode of <i>Dancing with the Stars </i>that Van Der Beek had had a miscarriage.

      <p>"Wrecked. Devastated. In shock. That's how we're feeling right now," the actor said.</p>
      <p>Van Der Beek said Monday on Instagram Stories that she nearly died due to the miscarriage.</p>
      <p>"In 48 hours we lost our baby -- boy, by the way -- and I almost lost my life," she <a href="https://people.com/parents/kimberly-van-der-beek-speaks-out-after-miscarriage/">said</a>.</p>
