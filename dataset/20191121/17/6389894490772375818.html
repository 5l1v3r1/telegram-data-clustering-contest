      <p>A temporary bridge will be built alongside the closed Hammersmith Bridge if the Conservatives are re-elected.</p>
      <p>Transport minister George Freeman announced this afternoon on Twitter that the proposal had gained his support, after lobbying from Richmond Park MP Zac Goldsmith.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The temporary bridge would take two or three months to build and cost £5m, according to Goldsmith.</p>
      <p>"This community cannot afford for the bridge to be closed for three years," he said.</p>
      <p>"It's having a big effect on commuters, resident's, local businesses and on security, because blue light security can't cross this bridge."</p>
      <p>Freeman confirmed the Tories' official support for the project in the video.</p>
      <p>He said: "This bridge is an absolutely key North-South link, it bridges two communities [who] we've talked to here [and are] hugely affected.</p>
      <p>"Let's get the key people, City Hall the PM, the councils, let's get this sorted."</p>
      <p>The Hammersmith and Fulham council closed Hammersmith Bridge in April due to “critical faults” that sparked safety concerns.</p>
      <p>The council has said repairs could cost in the region of £120m and take three years to complete.</p>
      <p>Transport for London (TfL) has so far committed £25m to the project to help with planning and design.</p>
      <p><i>City A.M. </i>reported yesterday that the planned upgrades would not allow TfL's current fleet of electric double decker buses on the bridge.</p>
      <p>A TfL spokesperson said that current electric double decker buses would be too heavy to cross the bridge.</p>
      <p>They added that changes in technology may allow newer models to travel on it in the future.</p>
      <p>"We’re always investigating other tech, and there is the potential for ‘opportunity charging’.</p>

      <p>"This is basically charging points along the bus route, where the bus can get a boost.</p>
      <p>"That means that the battery doesn’t need to be as big, and therefore the bus isn’t as heavy."</p>
