        <b>Freida Pinto's marriage seems round the corner. The actress has got engaged. All said and done, she's on cloud nine- and why not?</b>
      </p>
      <p>We were the FIRST to break the news to you that the Slumdog Millionaire actress Freida Pinto has met the man of her dreams and is all set to marry in 2019. And as it stands today, it looks as if it is happening! </p>
      <p>So yeah, Freida Pinto had started dating an adventure photographer Cory Tran. Well, the couple has got engaged and Freida has gone public about it on Instagram, flaunting her ring and calling Cory as her fiance. </p>
      <p>Oh, we feel happy when love stories head towards a happy ending and feel happier when they head to the altar. For now, three cheers to Pinto's latest Insta post (as below)</p>

      <p>FYI, the credit of Cory and Freida coming close goes to Cory Tran’s bestie and Freida's co-star  of Hulu Series The Path, Aaron Paul.</p>

      <p>Pinto has been a fine actress. She was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role, MTV Movie Award for Best Breakthrough Performance, and Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie Actress – Drama, and won the Palm Springs International Film Festival Award for Breakthrough Performance. Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011) shot her into the commercial bracket. The rest, as they say, is history. </p>
      <p>As for her personal life, Freida has always been open about her relationships. Be it her affinity for Dev Patel (whom she dated for nearly 6 years) or sharing a passionate kiss with professional polo player Ronnie Barcardi during a romantic evening out in Los Angeles, she has never shied from indulging in PDA. </p>
      <p>This time, however, Freida has finally hit the ball over the ropes. Congratulations, Frieda and Cory. Shaadi kab hai? Exact date batah doh! That will be hitting the ball out of the ground.</p>
