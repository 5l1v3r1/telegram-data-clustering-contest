      <p>Former Chelsea, Man United and Real Madrid boss Jose Mourinho admits he made mistakes but claims he will not repeat them as he spoke for the first time after taking over at Tottenham.</p>
      <p>"I realised I made mistakes," the Portuguese gaffer told reporters at a news conference.</p>
      <p>"I'm not going to make the same mistakes. I'll make new mistakes, but not the same."</p>
      <p>The boastful Portuguese boss also claimed he was humble.</p>
      <p>"I am humble, humble enough to try and analyse my career - not just the last year, but the whole thing, the evolution, the problems and the solutions. Not to blame anyone else," added Jose.</p>
      <p>"It was a great thing. I went really deep with that analysis. A break was very positive for me. It was the first summer I did not work and I felt a little bit at a loss during that pre-season.</p>
      <p>"I was always humble, in my way. The problem is you didn't understand that."</p>
