      <p>Outsourcing giant Mitie has warned that its clients are holding back on committing to new projects, amid ongoing Brexit uncertainty and the upcoming general election.</p>
      <p>The firm, which provides cleaning, security, facilities management, energy and healthcare services, said the uncertainty could affect revenue growth in the coming months.</p>

      <p>However, it reported rising turnover and profit as it moved onto the second part of a five-year turnaround plan.</p>
      <p>Shares fell seven per cent today.</p>
      <p>Revenue grew 11 per cent, operating profit was up five per cent, and the company’s order book grew one per cent.</p>
      <p>It comes after Mitie said it was selling its catering business to royal warrant holder CH&amp;Co for as much as £85m.</p>
      <p>Chief executive Phil Bentley told <i>City A.M.</i>: “Clients are going, ‘oh that roof, maybe we’ll fix it next year not this year.’”</p>
      <p>He added: “But …  there's still some economic growth in our big clients. It’s not spectacular growth, but it’s not falling off a cliff either.”</p>
      <p>The company, which is less dependent than its rivals on public sector work, said its order book grew one per cent to £4.1bn, helped by contract wins from the Bank of England, HM Revenue and Customs, and a major London airport.</p>
      <p>Bentley added: “The Catering disposal to our strategic partner CH&amp;CO has strengthened our balance sheet and sharpened our focus on those business lines where we can secure a leading market position, underpinned by technology. </p>
      <p>“Although still early days, we can see the success of this approach in our security business where we continue to win market share.”</p>

      <p>Last month, <a href="https://www.cityam.com/exclusive-outsourcers-told-michael-gove-no-deal-brexit-planning-is-stalling-industry/">it emerged Whitehall had come under pressure</a> from some of its most prominent public service outsourcers for slow decision-making, as time and resources were increasingly directed towards no-deal Brexit planning.</p>
      <p>Three sources with knowledge of the matter told <i>City A.M.</i> that de facto no-deal Brexit secretary Michael Gove had been urged to “get a move on” so more work can be handed out.</p>
