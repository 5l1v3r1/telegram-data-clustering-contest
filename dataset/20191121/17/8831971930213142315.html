      <h1>Where Are The Child Stars Of Classic Christmas Movies Now?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T17:55:42+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 17:55</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://collegecandy.com/author/greist/" target="_blank">Greis Torres</a></address>
      <p>What happened to the child actors who starred in big, classic Christmas movies after they grew up? We remember them for their sparkly, innocent eyes and amazing acting skills that captivate everyone when the holidays are around.</p>
      <p>Ian Petrella, who played Ralphie in “A Christmas Story” in 1983, was once asked by a fan to do his iconic line “I can’t put my arms down.” Since his voice was changing, the fan had a horrified looked after he performed the line, according to <i><u><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/20/movies/christmas-movies-child-actors.html">The New York Times</a></u>. </i>Petrella said he doesn’t recreate the line anymore.</p>
      <p>Here’s what happened to the former child actors from “Miracle on 34th Street,” “Home Alone,” “The Holiday,” “The Santa Clause,” and “Love Actually” after they grew up and where they are now, according to <i>The New York Times</i>.</p>
      <h3>Mara Wilson</h3>

      <p>The original plot of “A Miracle on 34th Street” was to have a boy perform the role that Mara Wilson ended up doing. Filmmakers decided to change the role to give it to Wilson because she had charmed the audience in “Ms. Doubtfire.”</p>
      <p>“I didn’t feel like my cuteness was my defining aspect,” she said to <i>The New York Times</i>. “And then it’s even harder once you go through puberty and suddenly people are like, ‘You’re not as cute anymore, therefore, you are useless.’”</p>
      <p>“It was 100 degrees out, and we were in layers of corduroy and wool,” she said about her co-star Elizabeth Perkins. “There were all these flies on set, and Elizabeth smashed one against a wall and then walked away, looking gorgeous and elegant, with a smashed fly on her palm.”</p>
      <p>She is now 32 years old and is a writer and voice artist for shows and audiobooks.</p>

      <p>Ratray played Buzz, Kevin’s big brother in “Home Alone.” He gets comments from fans joking or referencing to the movie up to this day on social media.</p>
      <p>“Everyone thinks they’re the first ones to think of it and that it’s so funny,” Ratray told <i>The New York Times</i>. “No one realizes it’s been 30 years of people saying that to me.”</p>
      <p>Ratray also had a role in “Home Alone 2: Lost in New York.” He recounted how he filmed Michael Jackson on his video camera when the late singer visited Macaulay Culkin on set.</p>
      <p>“Being associated with one job is not the way I want my career to go, but I have realized that ‘Home Alone’ has become bigger than my ego,” he told <i>The New York Times</i>. “It is this iconic experience — and it’s more about the people who watch it than the people who are in it.”</p>
      <p>He is 42 years old and he is still acting. His latest acting roles were on “Hustlers” and “The Tick.”</p>

      <p>Right when filming for “The Holiday” was over, Jude Law, the father, and Cameron Diaz, Law’s love interest, gave Miffy Englefield and her co-star, Emma Pritchard, denim jackets customized with their names.</p>
      <p>When Englefield turned 12, she started to associate more with the <u><a href="https://collegecandy.com/2008/02/15/gallows-englands-answer-to-the-lame-punk-scene/">local punk scene</a></u> in England.</p>
      <p>The 20-year-old hasn’t ditched acting altogether, the <i>New York Times </i>reported she is game for a sequel of “The Holiday.”</p>
      <p>She is currently a barista and a singer-songwriter.</p>

      <p>For the movie “The Santa Clause,” Eric Lloyd worked alongside Tim Allen, who was at the height of his fame at that time due to “Home Improvement.” In the movie, Allen plays the dad who is forced to be Santa Claus on Christmas Eve.</p>
      <p>“I woke up to the producers and director above my bed being like, ‘How bad is this? Can we fix this?’” Lloyd told <i>The New York Times</i> when he fell on a rock as a kid and knocked out two of his teeth on a day off from filming.</p>
      <p>“When Tim is talking to Bernard the Elf in the workshop, you see me on a train smiling and waving with my mouth closed strangely,” Lloyd said, “because the inside was all swollen.”</p>
      <p>Lloyd, now 33, said he still has one of the snow globes used in the film and he owns his own production studio.</p>

      <p>Olivia Olson sang <u><a href="http://collegecandy.com/tag/mariah-carey/">Mariah Carey</a></u>‘s song “All I Want For Christmas Is You” in the 2003 movie “Love Actually.” She recalled how producers told her that her voice was going to be unbelievable to the audience because it was too powerful for a 10-year-old.</p>
      <p>“I recorded it and they were like, ‘O.K., that was great, but can you just maybe do it not so great?’” she told <i>The New York Times</i>. “I was very confused by that.”</p>
      <p>After “Love Actually,” Olson did a decade of voice-overs for shows like “Phineas and Ferb” and “Adventure Time.” She released her debut solo album in 2008.</p>
