      <p>Israel's attorney general on Thursday formally charged Prime Minister <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/benjamin-netanyahu">Benjamin Netanyahu </a>in a series of corruption cases, throwing the country's paralyzed political system into further disarray and threatening the long-time leader's grip on power.</p>
      <p>Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit charged Netanyahu with fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in three different scandals. It is the first time a sitting Israeli prime minister has been charged with a crime. Mandelblit was set to issue a formal statement later Thursday.</p>
      <p>Allegations against Netanyahu include suspicions he accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars of champagne and cigars from billionaire friends, offered to trade favors with a newspaper publisher and used his influence to help a wealthy telecom magnate in exchange for favorable coverage on a popular news site.</p>
      <p>The indictment does not require Netanyahu to resign but is expected to raise pressure on him to step down.</p>
      <p>Netanyahu has called the allegations part of a witch hunt, lashing out against the media, police, prosecutors and the justice system. Netanyahu was scheduled to issue a statement later Thursday.</p>
