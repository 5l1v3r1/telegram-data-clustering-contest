      <h2>Competing with Spotify Business and Sirius XM Holdings.</h2>

      <p><a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/apple">Apple</a> has begun testing a new version of <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/apple-music">Apple Music</a> directed at retailers to have commercial use to streaming music in stores. The company has been trialing Apple Music For Business for the last 6 months and is partnering with PlayNetwork Inc. to license music for commercial use and operating the service itself. Apple, on the other hand, will create hundreds of unique playlists for each retail client.</p>
      <p>The service allows PlayNetwork to provide business contracts to use certain pieces of music without the cost of high licensing fees. In the retail market, <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/spotify">Spotify</a> and <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/sirius-xm">Sirius XM</a> already offer contracts to retailers, which cost between $25 USD to $35 USD a month per retail location. Although itâ€™s currently unknown how much Apple will charge businesses for its service, Apple has already landed 25 clients and is slated to deliver music to over 10,000 store locations, including <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/apple-store">Apple Stores</a>.</p>
      <p>In other tech news, <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/11/snapchat-time-machine-young-old-lens">Snapchat just released a new Time Machine feature that allows users to age and de-age themselves</a>.</p>
