      <h1>Fed's Kashkari: Business investment to pick up if there are resolutions in trade wars</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T17:26:47+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 17:26</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fxstreet.com/author/eren-%C5%9Fengezer" target="_blank">Eren Sengezer</a></address>
      <p>Neel Kashkari, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, said the business investment will pick up if there are resolutions in trade wars and tariffs.</p>
      <p>Kashkari further added that his forecast was for continued growth but acknowledged that trade was a big risk.</p>
      <p>The US Dollar Index largely ignored these remarks and was last up 0.08% on the day at 97.95.</p>
      <p>"We are seeing wages picking up for entry-level jobs, these folks are long overdue for a raise," Kashkari stated. "Until I see wage growth pick up I know we aren't at full employment, so let's let this continue."</p>
