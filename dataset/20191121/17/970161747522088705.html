      <p>Guys…We’re not in Hawkins anymore as Secret Cinema brings Stranger Things straight to London’s doorstep.</p>
      <p>Bringing to life some of the show’s most well-loved scenes, the immersive cinema experience tried its luck for the first time with a TV series, rather than a film.</p>
      <p>It works brilliantly.</p>
      <p>Even if you don’t know the series that well, first off: start watching it immediately, and second off: it doesn’t really matter that much.</p>
      <p>After all, who doesn’t want to live in 1985 for an evening?!</p>
      <p>Dressing up in your best double denim or neon fantasy is just the beginning for those in attendance, as you’re sent on missions around the show’s July 4<sup>th</sup> festivities and running into favourite faces that have been captured with almost impossible accuracy.</p>
      <p>The cast’s commitment to sticking to their roles, even if they’re just hiding behind doors or running around the fun fair setting, is addictive to watch.</p>

      <p>Highly recommend you follow them around or talk to them if you’re given the chance – they’re where the action is over the course of the three-hour show.</p>

      <p>Now, there’s only so much we can say because, well, it’s secret, DUH…But what we will say is this: interact with as many people as possible, actors and non-actors.</p>
      <p>You’ll find yourself in some weird and wacky places that you weren’t expecting.</p>

      <p>Becoming part of the world of Hawkins, Indiana is a great evening out, culminating in Secret Cinema’s most ambitious project yet.</p>
      <p>For the most part, they’ve done a great job, even if there are a couple of bits and pieces that due to the sheer scale of what they’ve imagined just can’t be brought to life.</p>
      <p>Dammit, CGI, you won this round.</p>
      <p>The show is also maybe not the best for those who feel claustrophobic in any way, though we can’t tell you why, but it’s probably best to note that here while we have your attention.</p>

      <p>More than anything though, the event is a true celebration of what Stranger Things is about – the friendships that build the show, the characters and the spectacle.</p>
      <p>Strap in, gang, you’re in for one hell of a ride.</p>
