      <h1>India vs Bangladesh, Day/Night Test: No Army paratroopers for handing over pink ball to captains</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T17:06:18+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 17:06</time> by <a rel="author">PTI</a></address>
      <p>KOLKATA: Security concerns meant the Cricket Association of Bengal cancelled its plan to have Army paratroopers flying into the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Eden-Gardens">Eden Gardens</a> to hand over a pink ball each to the captains before the toss of the day-night Test.</p>
      <p>According to sources at CAB, the security clearance did not come a day ahead of the historic match between India and Bangladesh.</p>
      <p>Union home minister Amit Shah won't be in attendance as per the final programme list sent by the CAB. Bangladesh Prime Minister <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/sheikh-hasina">Sheikh Hasina</a> and West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee will inaugurate India's first-ever D/N Test by ringing the customary Eden Bell just before the start of play.</p>
      <p>With the match taking place in winter, there is also a change in the conventional pink ball Test timing, where tea break is followed by a lengthy 40-minute supper.</p>
      <p>The Eden Test will have the usual lunch break after the first session, at 3pm, while the last break would be tea, spanning 20 minutes.</p>
      <p>As per the ICC norm, playing conditions can be altered by mutual consent of both the countries.</p>
      <p>During the lunch break there will be a chat show involving the Fab Five -- Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, Anil Kumble, VVS Laxman and BCCI president <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Sourav-Ganguly">Sourav Ganguly</a>, the architect of the D/N Test.</p>
      <p>The other former cricketers who have confirmed their presence include S Ramesh, Saba Karim, Sunil Joshi, Ajit Agarkar, Venkatesh Prasad, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Kapil-Dev">Kapil Dev</a>, Dilip Vengsarkar, Mohammed Azharuddin, Kris Srikkanth, Farook Engineer and Chandu Borde.</p>
      <p>Athletes from other sports disciplines will include Abhinav Bindra, P Gopichand, PV Sindhu, Sania Mirza and Mary Kom, but chess legends Viswanathan Anand and Magnus Carlsen will not be able to turn up.</p>
      <p>Naimur Rahman, Mohammed Mahmudul Hasan, Maharab Hossain, Mohammed Hasibul Hussain, Shahriar Hossain Biddut, Kazi Habibul Bashar and Mohammed Akram Khan are the former Bangladesh cricketers who have confirmed their presence.</p>
      <p>The tea break will feature an instrumental by Sorendu and group while the former captains will be given a lap of honour.</p>
      <p>The grand felicitation will happen post-match with a performance by Runa Laila, while a cultural programme by Jeet Ganguly will conclude the opening day.</p>
