      <p><a href="https://www.buzz.ie/movies-tv/joker-sequel-reportedly-works-343759"><i>Joker</i></a> director Todd Phillips has addressed the confusing and conflicting reports of a sequel.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/joker-sequel-works-as-todd-phillips-eyes-more-dc-origin-movies-1256255"><i>The Hollywood Reporter</i></a> and Deadline published different pieces regarding the future of Joaquin Phoenix's Joker, following the movie's success at the box office.</p>
      <p>The Hollywood Reporter said that a Joker sequel was in the works with Phillips potentially directing again, however <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/joker-sequel-no-discussions-yet-todd-phillips-no-dc-origin-villian-films-planned-1202790774/"><i>Deadline</i> </a>later stated that the meeting between Phillips and Warner Bros about the DC movie universe never happened.</p>

      <p><a href="https://theplaylist.net/todd-phillips-refutes-joker-sequel-scorseses-20191121/"><i>The Playlis</i></a>t asked Phillips to clarify the reports - and it's not looking like there are any plans set in stone for the time being.</p>
      <p>"That was written about today, and I have to be honest, it came out of nowhere," Phillips said, discussing The Hollywood Reporter's story. "It referred to a meeting that was never had.</p>
      <p>"I thought it was anticipatory at best. Obviously, sequels have been discussed when a movie that cost $60 million made $1 billion, but we have not had any serious conversations about it." </p>
