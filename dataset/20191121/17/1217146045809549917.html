      <p>Google is expanding the Android bug bounty program with new data exfiltration and lockscreen bypass categories as well as a $1 million reward for critical vulnerabilities targeting the Titan M chip.</p>
      <p>Over the past 12 months, Google has paid out over $1.5 million USD in bug bounty rewards and over $4 million USD for over 1,800 reports since the program was launched in 2015.</p>
      <p>The largest reward has gone to Guang Gong (@oldfresher) of Alpha Lab, Qihoo 360 Technology Co. Ltd for a "remote code execution exploit chain on the Pixel 3 device". Gong was awarded $161,337 fom Android Security Rewards program and addition $40,000 from Chrome Rewards for a total of $201,337.</p>
      <p>Starting today, Google is expanding the program by offering a $1 million reward for developing a "full chain remote code execution exploit with persistence" that compromises the Titan M secure chip on Pixel devices. This is up from the previously top award of $200,000 for a critical vulnerability that <a href="https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/android-rewards/">compromises a Pixel's Trusted Execution Environment</a> (TEE).</p>
      <p>In addition to the $1 million bounty, Google is also offering an additional 50% bounty for vulnerabilities found on certain developer previews of Android, bringing the top potential reward to $1.5 million USD.</p>
      <p>Titan M is a hardware chip introduced to Pixel phones in 2018 that Android uses to secure sensitive data and operations including the bootloader, disk encryption, passcodes, and secure transactions.</p>
      <p>"Today, we’re expanding the program and increasing reward amounts," Google stated in <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2019/11/expanding-android-security-rewards.html">their announcement</a>. "We are introducing a top prize of $1 million for a full chain remote code execution exploit with persistence which compromises the Titan M secure element on Pixel devices. Additionally, we will be launching a specific program offering a 50% bonus for exploits found on specific developer preview versions of Android, meaning our top prize is now $1.5 million."</p>
      <h3>New data exfiltration and lockscreen bypass categories</h3>
      <p>In addition to the above reward increases, Google has also announced two new categories that researchers can pursue for vulnerability rewards.</p>
      <p>The first category is data exfiltration vulnerabilities, which allow attackers to access data on a device and steal it by transferring it to an attacker controlled location.</p>
      <p>The second category being added is lockscreen bypasses, which is used to access a locked device without knowing the user's passcode.</p>
      <p>These new categories will award researchers up to $500,000 depending on the exploit category.</p>
