      <p>Online marketplace Carousell is now worth US$850 million (S$1.1 billion), after inking a deal with Norwegian telco Telenor Group that will see the Singapore brand merge with Telenor-owned classifieds firm 701Search.</p>
      <p>Before the merger, Carousell had a valuation of <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/business/companies-markets/carousell-to-merge-with-701search-valuing-singapore-start-up-at-over-116">US$560 million</a>, The Straits Times (ST) reported.</p>
      <p>Announced on Thursday (Nov 21), the part-cash and part-equity deal will result in Telenor becoming the single largest miniority shareholder in Carousell, owning 32 per cent of the merged company.</p>
      <p>701Search, which owns and operates three online marketplaces – Mudah in Malaysia, Cho Tot in Vietnam, and OneKyat in Myanmar – will retain their individual names and continue operations, but will report to Carousell’s chief executive Quek Siu Rui from now.</p>
      <p>In addition, 701Search’s regional hub team that operates in Singapore will be absorbed by Carousell.</p>
      <p>Rakesh Malani, Carousell’s chief financial officer, said in a statement that the Singaporean start-up’s latest deal shows that it is “driving rapid consolidation in the region”.</p>
      <p>The merger with 701Search will allow the 7-year-old firm to “fortify our leadership in South-east Asia as Mudah, Cho Tot, and OneKyat are already leaders in their markets”, added Quek.</p>
      <p>Besides Telenor, Carousell has been backed by <a href="https://www.businessinsider.sg/carousell-raises-s113-million-funding-collaborates-dbs-sell-financial-products-services-platforms/">other investors</a> such as OLX, Naspers, Rakuten Ventures, EDBI, Sequoia Capital, 500 Startups, Golden Gate Ventures and DBS.</p>
