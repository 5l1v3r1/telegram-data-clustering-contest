      <p>Split star Anya Taylor-Joy takes on the role of one of Jane Austen’s most beloved heroines in the first teaser trailer for the new adaptation of Emma.</p>
      <p>The footage also shows The Crown star Josh O’Connor as Mr Elton, who dives headfirst into Emma’s lap when their carriage comes to an abrupt stop, and Johnny Flynn as Mr Knightley, who flings his coat on the floor.</p>
