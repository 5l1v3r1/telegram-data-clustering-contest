      <p>A woman who threw a milkshake on a homeless man as he was being punched and kicked on the ground, has been spared jail.</p>
      <p>Dana Hooper, 24, was ordered to do unpaid work after a clip of her throwing liquid over the 60-year-old man as he was being attacked, was viewed thousands of times.</p>
      <p>As Nick Hulley lay on the floor in considerable pain, defending himself against a vicious attack, Hooper threw her milkshake all over him, Brighton Magistrates court heard.</p>
      <p>The incident took place on October 13, after Hooper followed Mr Hulley after an earlier confrontation.</p>
      <p>Hooper, from Portslade, pleaded guilty to common assault by throwing her drink over Mr Hulley.</p>
      <p>District Judge Teresa Szagun told Hooper her sentence was increased by the humiliation she subjected him to.</p>

      <p>She said: ‘I found it was an aggravating feature, you were prepared to continue following him – whilst he was being assaulted by others – to add to the humiliation by the action you took.’</p>

      <p>Suzanne Soros prosecuting said independent witnesses described being concerned for Mr Hulley’s safety and trying to intervene.</p>
      <p>Ms Soros said: ‘She carried on abusing him even after people were saying to leave him alone.</p>
      <p>‘They describe kicking while he was on the floor and he was shouting and groaning in pain.’</p>
      <p>Mr Hulley has not come forward to make a complaint, the court heard, and there would be no financial compensation for him.</p>

      <p>Hooper was with a group of friends on the Sunday evening.</p>
      <p>Ed Fish, defending, said there had been a confrontation between Hooper, her friends and Mr Hulley.</p>
      <p>The court heard Hooper has been afraid to leave home since the video went viral.</p>
      <p>The judge ordered Hooper to serve a 12 month community order, including 12 rehabilitation days and 80 hours unpaid work.</p>
      <p>She will also be under electronic weekend curfew and will have £175 costs and surcharge deducted from her benefits.</p>
      <p>Peter Derbyshire, 37, of Bognor Regis is charged with assault by beating of Mr Hulley.</p>
      <p>He is due to appear at Brighton Magistrates court at the end of the month.</p>
