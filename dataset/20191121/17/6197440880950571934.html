      <h1>Google vulnerability program adds $1 million prize for compromising Pixel’s Titan M chip</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T17:00:38+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 17:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5google.com/author/technacity/" target="_blank">Abner Li</a></address>
      <p>Launched in 2015, Google today is expanding its <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/02/08/google-vulnerability-reward-program-2018/">Android Security Rewards Program</a> with a new Pixel Titan M prize, and detailing highlights from the past year.</p>
      <p>The big development is a new $1 million top prize for a full chain remote code execution exploit with persistence of the Titan M <a href="https://9to5google.com/2018/10/17/titan-m-pixel-3-security/">secure element</a> found on the Pixel 3, Pixel 3a, and Pixel 4. Google’s custom-built enterprise-grade security chip introduced last year secures the bootloader and protects on-device data.</p>
      <p>Similarly, a new exploit category that includes data exfiltration and lockscreen bypass has rewards that go up to $500,000.</p>
      <p>Google will also offer a 50% bonus for exploits found on specific Android developer preview versions that usually start in March and last until August/September. As a result, the top prize is now valued at $1.5 million. The Pixel Titan M prize <a href="https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/android-rewards/">and other new rewards</a> come into effect today, with full details <a href="https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/android-rewards/">available here</a>.</p>
      <p>Looking back at 2019, the program paid out over $1.5 million, with 100 participating researchers having received an average of $3,800 per finding. The average researcher was paid over $15,000 for a 20% increase from the year prior.</p>
      <p>The top payout this year of $161,337 involved a 1-click remote code execution exploit chain on the Pixel 3:</p>
      <blockquote>This report detailed the first reported 1-click remote code execution exploit chain on the Pixel 3 device. Guang Gong was awarded $161,337 from the Android Security Rewards program and $40,000 by Chrome Rewards program for a total of $201,337. The $201,337 combined reward is also the highest reward for a single exploit chain across all Google VRP programs. The Chrome vulnerabilities leveraged in this report were fixed in Chrome 77.0.3865.75 and released in September, protecting users against this exploit chain.</blockquote>
