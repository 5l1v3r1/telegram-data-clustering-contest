      <p>The Blackpool-born 35-year-old, who has also had three seasons with Lytham CC, extends his stay at Emirates Old Trafford following a productive season in which he was the second-highest runscorer in the Royal London One-Day Cup and helped Lancashire secure promotion back to Specsavers County Championship Division One.</p>
      <p>Croft, who was awarded his testimonial in 2018, was an ever-present in the 2019 Vitality Blast, equalling his career-best with 94 against Worcestershire Rapids.</p>
      <p>It will take his Lancashire career into a 16th season and he will also work with the academy and age-group sides in a coaching role.</p>
      <p>He has amassed 168 First-Class, 145 List A and 168 T20 appearances for the club, and is their all-time leading appearance maker in T20 cricket since debuting in 2006.</p>
      <p>Croft said: “I am over the moon to have signed another contract with Lancashire.</p>
      <p>“It is an incredibly special place for me and I can’t wait for the new season to come round.</p>
      <p>“It means everything to represent the Red Rose. I still get a huge sense of pride whenever I play and I know I have plenty left to give on the field. The desire to perform for this club remains as strong as ever.</p>
      <p>“At this stage of my career, whilst I feel like I’ve still got a lot to offer as a player, to have the chance to further my coaching experience by working with the club’s academy and age-group sides, is something that is very important to me.”</p>
      <p>Croft hit the winning runs in the 2011 County Championship success and also led the side to the T20 title in 2015.</p>
      <p>Lancashire director of cricket, Paul Allott, said: “We are thrilled to have Steven on board for another two years.</p>
      <p>“His performances last season more than merited another contract and he was a central part of our squad in all formats.</p>
      <p>“He is an extremely versatile player and responded well last year when called upon in different roles.”</p>
