      <h1>Israeli PM Netanyahu indicted on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T17:32:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 17:32</time> by <a rel="author">Saphora Smith and Paul GoldmanÂ </a></address>
      <p>Israel's Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit announced Thursday that he was indicting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/after-falling-short-israel-s-election-netanyahu-set-confront-his-n1056241">Netanyahu has previously denied any wrongdoing</a>and has said he is the victim of a politically orchestrated "witch hunt" by the media and the left.</p>
      <p>It comes while Netanyahu is serving as Israel's caretaker prime minister after he <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/netanyahu-tells-israeli-president-he-can-t-form-government-after-n1060041">failed to cobble together a government last month.</a></p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/after-falling-short-israel-s-election-netanyahu-set-confront-his-n1056241">Netanyahu had hoped to pass legislation</a> that would prevent him from being indicted but has been unable to do so because he failed to form Israel's next government following the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/polls-close-israel-s-razor-tight-election-netanyahu-seeks-hold-n1055456">Sept. 17 election.</a></p>
      <p>The caretaker prime minister still has the option to ask the Israeli Parliament for immunity. But this request would need to be approved by a special committee that has not been established due to ongoing political deadlock.</p>
      <p>Netanyahu's chief political rival Benny Gantz announced Wednesday that <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/netanyahu-rival-gantz-fails-form-government-prolonging-israel-s-political-n1083161">he had also failed to form a government,</a> prolonging the country's political uncertainty and raising the prospect of Israel holding its third national election in a year.</p>
      <p>There are now 21 days in which any member of Parliament can become prime minister if they muster the 61 signatures needed to achieve a majority in the Knesset. If that does not happen Israel will return to the polls.</p>
      <p>In which case, Netanyahu's indictment potentially poses a new legal problem.</p>
      <p>If he wins the next election, it will be the first time a candidate for government is under indictment, raising the question as to whether President Reuven Rivlin can give Netanyahu the mandate to form the next government.</p>
