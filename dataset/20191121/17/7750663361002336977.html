      <p>Spurs announced <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jose-mourinho/"><b>Jose Mourinho</b></a> as their new head coach on Wednesday morning, just hours after sacking Pochettino the previous evening.</p>
      <p>But the Daily Mail has reported that Tottenham chairman <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/daniel-levy/"><b>Daniel Levy</b></a> made a tentative enquiry about the Leicester manager's availability prior to Mourinho's appointment.</p>
      <p>Rodgers moved to Leicester from Scottish champions Celtic in February and he has made a huge impact at the King Power Stadium in a short space of time, with the Foxes second in the Premier League table.</p>
      <p>When asked about links to other clubs during his pre-match press conference on Thursday afternoon, the Northern Irishman insisted he was happy and committed to the project at Leicester.</p>
      <p>"There is nothing to talk about on it. The game is full of gossip and speculation," said Rodgers, whose side resume their Premier League campaign away at Brighton on Saturday.</p>
      <p>"The only thing I will say is I was very happy here at Leicester, I've literally just joined the club in February.</p>
      <p>"Everything has been great since we've been in. We have a project here that we want to develop over the next number of years.</p>
      <p>"That's my sole focus, along with the team and the staff and the club here. In this game, what I've learned is that you'll always be linked with jobs and speculation around other jobs, but what's most important is the now, and I'm very happy here to develop and work with the club in order to help them improve.</p>
      <p>"What happens in football now is that if you go through times when you're doing well and you work well, everyone wants to take you away from that.</p>
      <p>"I'm very happy in my professional life. I'm very happy in my life personally in Leicestershire, it's a great place to live and work and we have created a real unity here at the club.</p>
      <p>"I came here with a responsibility to help Top (chairman Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha), (chief executive) Susan Whelan, (director of football) Jon Rudkin and all the players and staff here, to help the club grow.</p>
      <p>"In my time here that is what I'll aim to do. How long that will be you can never tell but I am very happy to be here."</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/james-maddison/"><b>James Maddison</b></a> will be fit for the trip to Brighton after recovering from a minor calf injury which ruled him out of England's Euro 2020 qualifier in Kosovo.</p>
      <p>The midfielder finally made his debut for the Three Lions at Wembley in the 7-0 demolition of Montenegro and Rodgers was pleased to see him get his first cap for his country.</p>
      <p>"James is fine. He has trained the last few days and he is OK," said the Leicester boss.</p>
      <p>"We're all very happy for James (to make his England debut). He's shown he's a big-game player, with his goals scored against Arsenal, Liverpool, Spurs.</p>
      <p>"He doesn't expect to play, he's not entitled, but he was pleased to finally make his debut and he hopes to get many more caps."</p>
