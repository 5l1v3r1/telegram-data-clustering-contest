      <p><b>BAGHDAD —</b> Four protesters were killed and dozens wounded in overnight clashes with security forces in Iraq's capital Baghdad, security and medical sources said on Thursday.<br/><br/>Anti-government demonstrators have spread from their main protest camp in Tahrir (Liberation) Square onto three bridges linking the banks of the river Tigris.<br/><br/>Security forces have erected concrete barriers on the bridges to hold protesters back, and late on Wednesday they fired tear gas and live ammunition at crowds gathering on Al-Sinek and Al-Ahrar bridges.<br/><br/>One protester was shot dead by a live round and three died from wounds sustained by tear gas canisters.<br/><br/>Rights groups have slammed security forces for firing the military-grade gas grenades directly at protesters instead of into the air.<br/><br/>When shot at close range, the canisters can pierce skulls or chests, and advocacy groups have documented around two dozen deaths from such injuries among Iraqi protesters.<br/><br/>The overnight confrontation also injured more than 50 people, including at least six who sustained gunshot wounds.<br/><br/>Authorities fear crowds could use Al-Sinek bridge to reach the Iranian embassy, or cross the adjacent Al-Ahrar bridge further north to protest at the central bank and other government buildings.<br/><br/>Protesters in Tahrir have rebuked Tehran for propping up an Iraqi government they see as corrupt and inefficient, even accusing Iran of backing the use of violence against them.<br/><br/>More than 330 people have been killed since the protests broke out on Oct. 1, according to an AFP toll, as authorities have stopped providing updated or precise figures.<br/><br/>The grassroots protests are the deadliest in decades but also the most widespread, with sit-ins at schools, outside government offices and public squares in Baghdad and across the Shiite-majority south.<br/><br/>In many areas, students and teachers have been at the forefront of demonstrations. Protest hotspots like Nasiriyah, Kut, Hillah and Diwaniyah have not seen steady school attendance in weeks.<br/><br/>But on Thursday, a security source said that Baghdad's joint operations command authorized security forces to check school rosters in the capital to identify who may have skipped class to strike, particularly among teachers.<br/><br/>A spokesman for the education ministry confirmed security forces had deployed around schools in the capital to prevent sit-ins or road closures. — AFP</p>
