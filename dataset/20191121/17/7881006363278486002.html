      <p><b>New Delhi: </b>Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday said the Centre's aim is to make evidence-based policy-making an integral part of governance by the year 2022.</p>
      <p>"Our aim is to make evidence-based policy-making an integral part of governance by the year 2022. It will also help in creating a new identity of New India. So is the right phase for the transformation of audit and assurance sector. Now CAG also has to move towards CAG 2.0," said Modi.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Prime Minister Modi, who was addressing the Accountants General and Deputy Accountants General conclave here, said: "The responsibility of the CAG is crucial as it plays an important role in keeping the economic conduct of the country and society sacred. And therefore you have high expectations."</p>
      <p>He further said that "today, as India is moving towards becoming an economic power of 5 trillion dollars, your role is also important in that. Because what you do will directly affect the efficiency of the government, the decision making and policymaking of the government."</p>
      <p>"This organisation is not limited to just statistics and process, but really has to come forward as a catalyst of good governance. You are seriously following the suggestion of making CAG, CAG Plus, it is a pleasure," he added.</p>
      <p>"Today all stakeholders want accurate audits so that they can execute their plans properly, but they also don't want the audit process to take a lot of time," added Prime Minister Modi.</p>
