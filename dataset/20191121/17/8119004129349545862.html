        <b>Rail links have been restored five hours after the derailment of a train in Kishoreganj.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Train services returned to normal around 5:30pm on Thursday after workers repaired the tracks, said Bhairab GRP Police Station OC Ferdous Ahmed.</p>
      <p>The coaches of a Chattogram-bound Nasirabad train went off the tracks near the outer signal of the Bhairab Bazar Rail Station around midday.</p>
      <p>Mymensingh-bound Bijoy Express at Bhairab, Dhaka-bound Egaro Sindhu at Kuliarchar, Kishoreganj-bound Egaro Sindhu Express at Daulatkandi and Bhairab-bound Mymensingh local train at Kishoreganj got stuck.</p>
      <p>On news of the accident, a relief train from Akhaura was dispatched to the scene and began rescue efforts around 3:30pm, said OC Ferdous.</p>
      <p>Trains have been derailed three times there this month, according to him.</p>
      <p>It comes amid concerns over safety of train journeys after the deaths of 16 passengers in a collision between two trains in Brahmanbaria earlier this month and a derailment of a train in Sirajganj last week.</p>
