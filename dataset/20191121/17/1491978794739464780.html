      <p>It’s almost as if <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a> functions best when he’s on the ropes. The opinion polls show the Tories are 10 points ahead? Not a big enough deficit to really get him out of bed. Don’t sweat the small stuff. The Labour leader needs to be at least 15 points behind to get motivated.</p>
      <p>So, for much of the campaign, Corbyn has seemed strangely underpowered. But now, three weeks before polling day, enough was enough. The polls were about as bad as they could possibly get. Time to start kicking ass.</p>
      <p>Two years ago it had been the manifesto launch at Bradford University that had seen the gap between <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour">Labour</a> and the Conservatives begin to narrow. Now, in the atrium of Birmingham City University, Corbyn was hoping to go one better.</p>
      <p>In 2017, he had pulled his punches. Sure much of the media back then had described his manifesto as too radical, but he knew that the real problem was that it hadn’t been radical enough. If only he’d had the courage of his convictions, Labour could have won the last election. So this time he was going for broke.</p>
      <p>After the shadow cabinet members – some with smiles more genuine than others – had taken their seats, Rebecca Long-Bailey, the current leadership team’s preferred successor to Corbyn should the unthinkable happen and Jeremy be forced to stand down, welcomed the Labour leader to the stage.</p>
      <p>The packed hall rose as one and isolated chants of “Oh Je-re-my Cor-byn” broke out. Corbyn beamed and gave a thumbs-up to the students in the galleries high above the weirdly sun-bleached banners saying “It’s Time for Change” that were draped across the walls.</p>
      <p>All was well. Corbyn is a much more complicated man than he sometimes appears. His message may be for the many, but he often seems most comfortable as a lightning rod for lost souls. But here he was in his element. Among his people.</p>
      <p>For a man who claims not to like the limelight and to have had greatness thrust upon him, Corbyn sure does love a large home crowd. And he works them like an old pro, with some sentences delivered almost at a shout and others fading away to little more than a whisper.</p>
      <p>“We are on your side,” he declared. The “you” being the 95% of the country who weren’t earning more than £80K. Which rather implied that he and others in the shadow cabinet were part of the problem.</p>
      <p>Though only a little bit. The real enemies were the billionaires, the bad bosses and the polluters. What’s more, he welcomed their hate. The more they hated what he was doing, the more he was certain he was right. There was none of the usual lip service to uniting the whole country. This was war on the elites who had nurtured inequality. He even cited Franklin D Roosevelt as a role model. Some Americans will be surprised to find their former president lauded as a socialist hero.</p>
      <p>A great deal of what followed was pretty much as had been trailed. Renationalisation of some public services, massive investment in affordable housing, renewable energies, free broadband, better schools, free child and social care.</p>

      <p>He had barely mentioned the NHS before the audience stood to chant: “Not for Sale.” That campaign message, at least, seems to have cut through. There was rather more muted applause for his section on Brexit, as even his most loyal supporters recognise there is a fundamental problem with a leader who can’t say what side he would support in a second referendum.</p>
      <p>Corbyn ended by quoting the Chilean poet Pablo Neruda. “You can cut all the flowers,” he said. “But you can’t stop spring from coming.” It was intended as a message of hope, though some pessimists couldn’t help remembering that springs are often fairly cold and rainy in the UK and there was still a winter to endure first.</p>
      <p>“We’re going to take some questions now,” Long-Bailey declared. “And I want you to listen respectfully or else you’ll get my stern face.” Not everyone was that scared of her stern face as, no sooner was the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg called, than a section of the audience started booing. “No, no, no,” said Corbyn. “We don’t do that.” Except some people must clearly still think that’s precisely what the Labour leader does want them to do. Otherwise they wouldn’t bother.</p>
      <p>Corbyn fudged his way around Brexit but answered all other questions with confidence. Sure it was going to take a lot of money but radical change didn’t come on the cheap and the manifesto was at least as well-costed as anyone else’s was likely to be.</p>
      <p>There was a faint hint of wistfulness in his eyes when he promised we weren’t about to return to the 1970s, but he soon recovered his composure and even went on to add a commitment to offsetting student debt that hadn’t even been included in the original 106-page brochure.</p>
      <p>The launch ended with Corbyn posing for selfies and basking in the applause of the audience, while the shadow cabinet shuffled off in dribs and drabs. Not all of them looked as if they fully bought into their leader’s vision.</p>
      <p>But it was too late to back out now. Labour had made its pitch and it was over to the voters now. The pollsters gave the party no chance of winning the election, but stranger things had happened. Though none immediately came to mind. Corbyn was merely content in the here and now. He had waited a lifetime for this. This was the dream, his dream. And if not now, then when?</p>
