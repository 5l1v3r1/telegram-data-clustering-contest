      <h1>Liverpool MMA prospect Muhammad Mokaev hailed as mix between Khabib Nurmagomedov and Conor McGregor</h1>
      <h2>Mokaev fights out of Liverpool's Aspire MMA and boasts an unbeaten amateur record of 21-0</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T17:37:20+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 17:37</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/joe-rimmer/" target="_blank">Joe Rimmer</a></address>
      <p>Muhammad Mokaev has been hailed as the 'biggest prospect in the world' after winning four fights in four days at the IMMAF Amateur World Championships in Bahrain last week.</p>
      <p>The Dagestani martial artist trains under Dean Garnett at Liverpool's Aspire MMA on Queens Drive and boasts an unbeaten amateur record  of 21-0 with six finishes and 15 unanimous decisions to his name.</p>
      <p>Mokaev is thought to be attracting interest from the UFC and Bellator and Garnett believes the sky is the limit for a man he labelled a mix between UFC Lightweight champion Khabib Nurmagomedov and former two-weight champion Conor McGregor.</p>
      <p>The 19-year-old is now a double world champion and European champion, having won his third gold medal with the four consecutive victories in Bahrain.</p>
      <p>Speaking about Mokaev's recent victories in the Middle East, Garnett described what sets his fighter apart from others.</p>

      <p>He told the ECHO: "What makes him so dangerous is his attitude and mentality.</p>
      <p>"To be 21-0 and have amassed an undefeated record on at those tournaments, fighting four times in four days, just shows how tough he is.</p>
      <p>"His mentality and wrestling ability make him stand out from other fighters. I think even when he uses other assets of his game, like his stand up, he is still better than everybody else in the competition."</p>
      <p>A wrestler, Mokaev has drawn comparisons to fellow Dagestani Khabib for a style that sees him dominate opponents - as well as making his way the cage wearing his idol's trademark wig.</p>

      <p>Despite the youngster's huge potential, Garnett, from Speke, wants Mokaev to  take things slow in his ascent to the top.</p>
      <p>He said the Mokaev will remain an amateur for the next year, but believes UFC stardom will eventually be in the teenager's sights.</p>
      <p>He said: "The next 12 months? He's going to stay amateur, he's going to compete in more tournaments, Asia, Africa and some other continents are on the agenda. Then we'll review after 12 months.</p>
      <p>"As his coaches we need to look at what he can do to become even better. This kid is like Khabib 2.0 but with McGregor star appeal, so he has a massive future.</p>
      <p>"He can do what he's doing at amateur and take it into the pro game. I think long term the goal is obvious, anything other than becoming a world class athlete would be failure."</p>
