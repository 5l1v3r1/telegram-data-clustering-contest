      <p>Two tigers rescued last month from cramped cages in a truck have had their first taste of outdoor space, as they explored their new enclosure at the Polish zoo where they now live on Monday.</p>
      <p>The tigers were among ten being transported from Italy to Russia when they were discovered at the Poland-Belarus border.</p>
      <p>Maximus and Fenix, both males, have now found sanctuary at the private Zoo Canpol, close to the small Polish town of Czluchow.</p>
      <p>Zoo owner Izabella Odejewska said she hardly recognises them from when they first arrived several weeks ago.</p>
      <p>Previously, the pair had been kept in a smaller enclosure designed to help them overcome their fear and increase their trust in humans, Odejewska said.</p>
      <p>Seven other tigers are currently in quarantine in a zoo in the western Polish city of Poznan. Dutch animal welfare charity Animal Advocacy and Protection has said it is hoping to move five of the tigers in Poznan to a shelter in southern Spain.</p>
      <p>The tigers spent days stuck in cages on a truck at the border, having started their journey in Rome and travelled some 2,000 km. There were originally 10 tigers on board, but one died in transit.</p>
