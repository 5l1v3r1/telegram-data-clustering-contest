      <h1>Diego Simeone replaces Unai Emery &amp; 9 trophies - Football Manager predicts Arsenal's next decade</h1>
      <h2>We used the hugely popular football management simulation game Football Manager 2020 to predict how the next decade could look for Arsenal</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T17:45:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 17:45</time> by <a rel="author">Nathan Bliss</a></address>
      <p>Arsenal have had incredible stability over the last decade, with is unique in modern football, with stable league finishes and impressive financial results.</p>
      <p>They've had just two managers, Arsene Wenger and Unai Emery, and have finished every season in the top six places in the Premier League, finishing in the top four seven times since the 2009/20 season.</p>
      <p>But the Gunners haven't actually made the top four since the 2015/16 season, and don't look like doing so again this season under Emery, who is coming under increasing pressure after some disappointing performances.</p>
      <p>The question is, how will Arsenal perform over the next decade?</p>
      <p>What will the first XI look like in 2030? How long will Emery remain as manager?</p>
      <p>And, how many trophies will they have won?</p>
      <p>We used Football Manager 2020 to take a look at how the next decade could pan out for Arsenal.</p>
      <h3>Arsenal in 2019/20</h3>

      <p>This is how Emery's best eleven is predicted to look in the 2019/20 season, with Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang both the highest rated player and the top scorer, with 30 goals.</p>
      <p>
        <b>2019/20 Competition results</b>

      <p>Arsenal are predicted to a good season domestically and finish third in the Premier League table. Bear in mind that when we started this simulation, we couldn't input the results that have already happened!</p>

      <p>Emery spent a whopping £216 million in the summer of 2020, with Milan Skriniar, Houssem Aouar, Chiquinho, Luiz Felipe and Callum McGregor among those arriving.</p>
      <p>Henrikh Mkhitaryan secured his move to Roma, with Shkrodran Mustafi leaving for Fiorentina, Sead Kolasinac moving to China and Calum Chambers going to Wolves, as Arsenal recouped £80 million.</p>

      <p>Young talents Reiss Nelson and Bukayo Saka forced their way into Emery's best eleven, as did new signings Luiz Felipe, Skriniar and Aouar.</p>
      <p>Keiran Tierney was the club's highest rated player, with Aubameyang again top scorer with 25 goals in all competitions.</p>
      <p>
        <b>2020/21 Competition results</b>
      </p>
      <p>These performances led to a fourth place Premier League finish in 2020/21, but 13 points behind champions Man City.</p>

      <p>Emery was allowed to splash the cash once again in the summer of 2021, signing the likes of Ferland Mendy, Youri Tielemans and Ryan Fraser for £153 million.</p>
      <p>Grant Xhaka, Mesut Ozil, David Luiz, Rob Holding, Emiliano Martinez and Fabricio Bustos all left the club, with Arsenal recouping just £39 million.</p>

      <p>Despite Mendy's arrival, Tierney retained his place, with Aouar being pushed up into a number ten position, with Saka and Nelson on the flanks.</p>
      <p>Alexandre Lacazette had a great season, scoring 24 goals in 47 appearances, although Aubameyang did miss a lot of the season with injury.</p>
      <p>French midfielder Aouar scored 18 goals in his first season and was the club's highest rated player.</p>
      <p>
        <b>2021/22 Competition results</b>
      </p>
      <p>But it was a poor Premier League season for Emery and Arsenal, as the Gunners finished 5th in the league with 68 points, just one point off a top four spot.</p>

      <p>Aubameyang, now 32 years old and losing some of his pace, was sold for a meagre £10.5 million, with Joe Willock being sold for decent money, Xhaka, McGregor and Elneny also left on loan.</p>

      <p>It was a familar front four, with Torreira and Tielemans forming a great midfield partnership.</p>
      <p>William Saliba returned to the club and made a first team spot his own, partnering Skriniar, who was the club's highest rated player.</p>
      <p>Midfielder Aouar was the club's top scorer with 18 goals, with Lacazette and Nketiah finishing on 16 goals each.</p>
      <p>
        <b>2022/23 Competition results</b>

      <p>Simeone went big in the summer of 2026, spending £136 million on Alex Meret, Achraf Hakimi, Sacha Smits, Bodi Tielemans and more.</p>
      <p>But, Simeone did suffer a blow when Nketiah was sold to Real Madrid for £75 million.</p>

      <p>Despite bringing in Abraham, Simeone made Matteo Guendouzi a false nine (yes, really) to replace Nketiah, and the Frenchman repaid him with a 17 goal haul, getting the highest rating out of anyone that season.</p>
      <p>A masterstroke.</p>

      <p>Klopp didn't deviate from the 4-2-3-1, starting Unsworth up front, who scored 22 goals in his debut season, and the rest of the team looking very familar.</p>

      <p>£100 million was spent by Klopp in the summer of 2028, with the German bringing in defensive midfielder Nohan Kenneh, midfielder Jose Andres, Brazilian defender Ederson and young goalkeeper Pasquale Bono.</p>
      <p>Augustin Benitez, Lewis, Bellerin and Bodi Tielemans were all sold, meaning Arsenal actually made a £4 million profit.</p>
