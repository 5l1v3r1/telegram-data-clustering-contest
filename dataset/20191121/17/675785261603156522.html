      <p>Detectives hunting the killer, believed to have fled the scene in a getaway car, have not made any official comment on the nationalities of the gunshot victims, although local reports at the time said they were of “Arabic origin.”</p>
      <p>That incident is being linked to a gangland drugs feud.</p>
      <p>In January a millionaire businessman who was close to the stars of reality TV series TOWIE and partied with the likes of Mohamed Al Fayed, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/millionaire-pal-towie-stars-shot-13888882">was shot dead outside his luxury Costa del Sol home.</a></p>
      <p>Marco Yaqout was gunned down in the early hours of January 21 as he drove into his garage in his trademark UK-plated Bentley.</p>
      <p>His killer was waiting for him outside his villa on a quiet residential street in an upmarket neighbourhood in San Pedro de Alcantara near Marbella called Las Petunias.</p>
      <p>The gruesome murder was the latest in a string of violent incidents on the Costa del Sol in recent months.</p>
      <p>They have included two attacks on Brits, the shooting of a Dutchman in a sushi restaurant in the popular resort of Benalmadena and the machine-gun murder of a Frenchman outside his home in Marbella.</p>
      <p>English-speaking entrepreneur Marco was described at the time of his murder as the owner of at least five-well-known nightspots in Puerto Banus, including the TOWIE favourite TIBU, and Linekers.</p>
