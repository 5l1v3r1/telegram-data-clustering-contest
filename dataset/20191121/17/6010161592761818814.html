      <h1>Xbox Black Friday sale cuts price of Control, Borderlands 3, Resi 2, and loads more</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T17:14:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 17:14</time> by <a rel="author">Colm Ahern</a></address>
      <p>Xbox has launched its <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/promotions/sales/black-friday/xbox-games">Black Friday sale</a> early for Xbox Live Gold subscribers, which is lovely of them, isn’t it? If you’re not a Gold subscriber, you’ll have to wait until 24th November to grab these deals or you can visit our <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/11/08/xbox-one-black-friday-deals-2019/">Xbox One Black Friday</a> hub for more current offers. The sale ends on 2nd December for everyone.</p>
      <p>There are some serious savings to be had, particularly when it comes to games that have only come out this year. For example, the exceptional <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/01/22/resident-evil-2-remake-review/">Resident Evil 2 remake</a>, which Kirk at the time called “a perfect blend of nostalgia and the new,” is available for only £14.84. Do you know what else costs £14.84? Loads of things, probably, and none of them are as good as Resi 2.</p>
      <p>Sure, it’s all a bit faux-edgy and cringe, but <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/09/18/borderlands-3-review/">Borderlands 3</a> is a really good loot shooter behind it all; Gearbox’s latest is on sale for only £35.99 on the Xbox store at the minute and we recommend you take a punt. As long as you can look past the fecal matter jokes, you’ll have a good time shooting baddies with really silly guns.</p>
      <p>Easily one of 2019’s best, <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/03/25/sekiro-shadows-die-twice-review/">Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</a> has had its price slashed, too. You can grab FromSoftware’s balls-hard stealth action game from the Xbox store for over £20 less than the regular asking price during this sale period.</p>
      <p>Phil Spencer has kindly discounted a ton of other Xbox One and Xbox 360 games; we haven’t even mentioned <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/08/26/control-game-review/">Control</a>, which is an absolute steal at its current price. </p>
      <p>Have a look below at some of the stand out deals, but remember to <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/promotions/sales/black-friday/xbox-games">check out Xbox’s website</a> to see everything Microsoft has to offer.</p>
