      <h1>Taapsee Pannu says if she would have been in Harsh Varrdhan Kapoor place, she wouldn't have gotten the second film</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T17:04:30+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 17:04</time> by <a rel="author">TIMESOFINDIA.COM</a></address>
      <p>Apart from her classic performances in the films, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Taapsee-Pannu">Taapsee Pannu</a> is also known for her unspoken nature. She's badass, unabashedly honest and never shies away from speaking her mind! And her recent conversation on a chat show was proof of the same.</p>
      <p>The host of the show asked about the newcomer of <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Bollywood">Bollywood</a> who wouldn't have survived in the industry. Taapsee was quick to name <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Anil-Kapoor">Anil Kapoor</a>'s son <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Harsh-Varrdhan-Kapoor">Harsh Varrdhan Kapoor</a>. He marked his debut in <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Rakeysh-Omprakash-Mehra">Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra</a>'s 'Mirzya' which failed to pull the audience to the theatres. He also featured in <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Vikramaditya-Motwane">Vikramaditya Motwane</a>'s vigilante drama 'Bhavesh Joshi Superhero'. The actor is currently working on Abhinav Bindra's biopic.</p>
      <p>Taapsee went on to say that after whatever she has seen of him till now, it would have been a task due to his not so appreciated debut. She added that if she would have been at his place, she probably wouldn't have got any film after that.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, on the work front, Taapsee was last seen in 'Saand Ki Aankh' co-starring <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Bhumi-Pednekar">Bhumi Pednekar</a>. The film was released in October this year.</p>
