      <h1>ArcelorMittal plans to shut South Africa plant, 900 workers to lose jobs</h1>
      <h2>Saldanha became operational in 1998 and employs 400 fulltime staff and 500 contract workers</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T17:25:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 17:25</time> by <a rel="author">AFP | PTI</a></address>
      <p>Scores of workers in <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/south-africa">South Africa </a>picketed at steel giant ArcelorMittal's plant in the town of Saldanha on Thursday demanding a halt in plans to close the operation which would see 900 jobs lost.</p>
      <p>ArcelorMittal announced early this month that it would wind down the plant, 175 kilometres (110 miles) north of Cape Town, because it was no longer viable on the export market.</p>
      <p>The plant has "incurred substantial losses in the past," said the company, adding that the "medium-term outlook remain bleak".</p>
      <p>But closing down the operation will mean extensive job losses in the small West Coast town of around 28,000 people, which is heavily dependent on the plant.</p>
      <p>Saldanha became operational in 1998 and employs 400 fulltime staff and 500 contract workers.</p>
      <p>"When the steel works closes, it means a thousand direct jobs ... will be lost," said Sammy Claassen, spokesman for a community support group, the South African Social and Economic Development Forum, said during the protest.</p>
      <p>According to Claassen, if subcontractors are added, around 4,000 people will be affected by the closure of the steel factory.</p>
      <p>"There will be absolute poverty, absolute devastation and chaos, crime and unemployment," said Claassen in the small town that was originally built on the fishing industry.</p>
      <p>The town faced similar devastation when big fish factories closed down in the early 1990s, before the steel plant opened in 1998. "Our town became a ghost town, our people weren't working," said 67-year-old community member Pauline Mali.</p>
      <p>And "if the steelworks closes we'll be back to where we come from," she added.</p>
      <p>ArcelorMittal, which supplies more than 70 percent of South Africa's steel, announced in July that it could slash nearly a quarter of its 8,000-strong workforce throughout <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/south-africa">South Africa </a>as part of a restructuring project.</p>
