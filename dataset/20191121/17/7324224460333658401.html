      <p>The document has been released today with leader Jeremy Corbyn hailing its “radical” and “ambitious” vision.</p>

      <p>Allen posted a video of herself on the Tik Tok video app, apparently emotional about Labour political proposals.</p>
      <p>The outspoken pop star would have appeared to use effects available on the app to simulate her crying.</p>
      <p>She remarks in the short video: “Guys, I’ve just watched the Labour manifesto.”</p>
      <p>In a separate post she concludes: “I think it’s the best manifesto I’ve ever seen.”</p>
      <p>While appearing to weep in the video, the Tik Tok app shows that a filter was used to simulate her tears.</p>
      <p>The manifesto includes plans to tax the very highest earners to fund investment in public services.</p>
      <p>There are also proposals to renationalise some services, including Royal Mail.</p>
      <p>The ability of Labour to raise their stated sums by tax have been branded “quite doubtful” by the Institute of Fiscal Studies.</p>
