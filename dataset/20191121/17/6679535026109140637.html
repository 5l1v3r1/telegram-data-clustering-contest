      <p>Karman Kaur Thandi bounced back strong to beat second seed Ankita Raina 3-6, 6-3, 7-6(3) in the pre-quarterfinals of the $25,000 ITF women’s tennis tournament at the Arera Club on Thursday.</p>
      <p>It was a commendable performance by the 21-year-old Karman, ranked 611th in the world, as she was playing only her second tournament after missing nearly eight months of the season owing to a shoulder injury.</p>

      <p>In the tie-break, it was 3-3 when Karman swept the last four points to set up a quarterfinal against qualifier Karin Kennel of Switzerland.</p>
