      <p>Israel's attorney general on Thursday formally charged Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a series of corruption cases, throwing the country's paralyzed political system into further disarray and threatening the long-time leader's grip on power.</p>
      <p>Capping a three-year investigation, Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit charged Netanyahu with fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in three different scandals. It is the first time a sitting Israeli prime minister has been charged with a crime.</p>
      <p>According to the indictment, Netanyahu accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars of champagne and cigars from billionaire friends, offered to trade favours with a newspaper publisher and used his influence to help a wealthy telecom magnate in exchange for favorable coverage on a popular news site.</p>
      <p>The indictment does not require Netanyahu to resign but is expected to raise pressure on him to step down.</p>
      <p>Mandelblit was set to issue a statement later Thursday, as was Netanyahu, who has called the allegations part of a witch hunt, lashing out against the media, police, prosecutors and the justice system.</p>
      <p>The most serious charges were connected to so-called <b>"Case 4000"</b> in which Netanyahu is accused of passing regulations that gave his friend, telecom magnate Shaul Elovitch, benefits worth over $250 million (Rs 17,93,91,00,000 roughly) to his company Bezeq. In return, Bezeq's news site, Walla, published favorable articles about Netanyahu and his family.</p>
      <p>The relationship, it said, was <b>"based on a mutual understanding that each of them had significant interests that the other side had the ability to advance"</b>. It also accused Netanyahu of concealing the relationship by providing <b>"partial and misleading information"</b> about his connections with Elovitch.</p>
      <p>Two close aides to Netanyahu turned state's witness and testified against him in the case.</p>
      <p>The indictment also said that Netanyahu's gifts of champagne from billionaires Arnon Milchan and James Packer "turned into a sort of supply line". It estimated the value of the gifts at nearly $2,00,000 (Rs 1,43,51,000 roughly).</p>
      <p>The indictment said Netanyahu assisted the Israeli Milchan, a Hollywood mogul, in extending his US visa. It was not immediately clear what, if anything, Packer received in return.</p>
