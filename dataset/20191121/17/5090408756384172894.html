      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T17:33:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 17:33</time> by <a rel="author">Grace Panetta, Business Insider US</a></address>
      <h3>Who is Andrew Yang?</h3>
      <p><b>Current job:</b> Entrepreneur and 2020 presidential candidate.</p>
      <p><b>Age: </b>44</p>
      <p><b>Family: </b>Yang and his wife Evelyn have two young sons.</p>
      <p><b>Hometown:</b> Schenectady, New York.</p>
      <p><b>Political party: </b>Democratic.</p>
      <p><b>Previous jobs:</b> Corporate lawyer, healthcare startup entrepreneur, CEO of Manhattan Test Prep, Founder and CEO of Venture for America.</p>
      <h3>Who is Andrew Yang’s direct competition for the nomination?</h3>
      <p>Based on a recurring series of national surveys we conduct, we can figure out who the other candidates competing in <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/andrew-yang-2020-democratic-candidate-universal-basic-income-fake-news-2019-3">Andrew Yang</a>‘s lane are, and who the broader opponents are within the party.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The average Yang-satisfied respondent said they were satisfied with <b>5 other candidates</b>, which is okay: it means that people who like him tend to be considering just a few other choices. To stay competitive, he’ll want to be in line with the top candidates in the race, for whom that number is less than four.</li>
        <li>This is encouraging for him: 8 percent of his supporters liked him and him alone, which is high at this point in the cycle. That means that he’s been really good at locking down fans – only frontrunners Biden and Sanders have done better – which will serve him well later in the race.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-bernie-sanders-bio-age-family-key-positions-2019-3">Sen. Bernie Sanders</a> and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-elizabeth-warren-bio-age-family-key-positions-2019-3">Sen. Elizabeth Warren</a> do better among Yang voters than they do among Democrats in general.</li>
        <li>While <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-joe-biden-bio-age-family-key-positions-2019-3">Former Vice President Joe Biden</a> is popular among Yang supporters, the businessman’s backers like Biden about 10 percentage points less than your typical Democrat.</li>

      <p>Insider has been conducting a recurring poll through SurveyMonkey Audience on a national sample to find out how different candidate’s constituencies overlap. We ask people whether they are familiar with a candidate, whether they would be satisfied or unsatisfied with that candidate as the nominee, and sometimes we also ask whether they think that person would win or lose in a general election against President Donald Trump.</p>

      <h3>What are Andrew Yang’s policy positions?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>On <b>healthcare:</b></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Yang <a href="https://www.yang2020.com/policies/single-payer-healthcare/">supports implementing a Medicare For All-style</a> healthcare system in which Americans would receive publicly-funded healthcare instead of relying on getting healthcare through their employers.</li>
            <li>At the third Democratic debate in September, Yang said, “As someone who has run a business, I can tell you flat-out our current health care system makes it harder to hire, it makes it harder to treat people well and give them benefits, it makes it harder to change jobs, and it certainly makes it harder to start a business.”</li>
            <li>He also joked, “I’m Asian, so I know a lot of doctors. And they tell me that they spend a lot of time on paperwork, avoiding being sued, and navigating the insurance bureaucracy. We have to change the incentives so that instead of revenue, people are focused on our healthcare system.”</li>
            <li>Yang also wants to <a href="https://www.yang2020.com/policies/mental-health/">expand access to mental health services,</a> advocating for an increase in providers serving rural areas, requiring insurance companies to cover postpartum depression screenings for new mothers, and incentivizing providers to use AI for more efficient healthcare.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>On <b>immigration:</b></p>
          <ul>

            <li>He also pledges to sign <a href="https://www.yang2020.com/policies/support-the-dream-act/">the DREAM Act</a> into law, affording protection for undocumented people brought to the United States as children, and <a href="https://www.yang2020.com/policies/enticing-high-skill-individuals/">would expand the H1-B and F-1 visa programs</a> to attract skilled immigrants.</li>
            <li>Yang also wants to invest in new technology to help <a href="https://www.yang2020.com/policies/southern-border-security/">secure the US’ southern border</a>, expand funding for Customs and Border Patrol, and reduce the backlog in US asylum and immigration courts.</li>
            <li>At <a href="https://twitter.com/ThisWeekABC/status/1172319312301846528">the third Democratic debate in September</a>, Yang said, “My father grew up on a peanut farm in Asia with no floor.

            <li>Yang would also direct the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to collaborate with private companies and local governments on innovative solutions to climate change.</li>
            <li>At a September CNN climate forum, Yang emphasized ensuring that all Americans have <a href="https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2019/09/04/yang-cnn-climate-crisis-town-hall-2020-democratic-candidates-vpx.cnn">clean and pollution-free water to drink.</a></li>
            <li>But Yang has also been criticized for promoting a fatalistic view that climate destruction is inevitable, saying at the second Democratic debate that the Freedom Dividend would help people move to higher ground to avoid flooding.</li>

            <li>He also is favor of limiting Supreme Court Justices to 18-year terms</li>
            <li>As president, he says he would <a href="https://www.yang2020.com/policies/modernize-voting/">modernize and secure</a> the US’ existing election infrastructure by updating voting technology</li>

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>On <b>abortion:</b></p>

            <li>Yang supports the right <a href="https://www.yang2020.com/policies/right-privacy-abortion-contraception/">to choose abortion and affordable contraception access</a>. He says he would nominate federal judges who also support legal protection of abortion.</li>

        <li>
          <p>On <b>LGBTQ rights:</b></p>

            <li>He also wants to make two-year community college education <a href="https://www.yang2020.com/policies/close-skills-gap-community-college/">free or extremely low-cost, </a>and implement a number of measures to implore four-year colleges <a href="https://www.yang2020.com/policies/controlling-cost-higher-education/">to reduce their tuition costs.</a></li>

            <li>Like fellow presidential candidate Kamala Harris, Yang <a href="https://www.yang2020.com/policies/teacher-salaries/">supports increasing public school teacher pay.</a></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>On <b>guns:</b></p>
          <ul>
            <li>On Yang’s campaign website, he presents a detailed plan to create a new, <a href="https://www.yang2020.com/policies/gun-safety/">multi-tiered licensing system</a> for firearms similar to the different levels of automobile licenses. These would require universal background checks.</li>
            <li>He would also introduce a federal weapons buyback program for those who want to surrender their weapons.

            <li>After a spate of deadly mass shootings in the summer of 2019, Yang broke down in tears at the Iowa state fair <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/andrew-yang-moved-to-tears-gun-safety-iowa-town-hall-2019-8">while talking to a mother who lost her child to gun violence.</a></li>

            <li>Yang is also interested in federal funding <a href="https://www.yang2020.com/policies/every-cop-gets-camera/">to give American police officers body cameras,</a> expanding community policing initiatives, and investing in “non-lethal weaponry that can be used to de-escalate conflicts.”</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>On <b>trade:</b></p>
          <ul>
            <li>In an interview with the Basic Income Earth Network, Yang criticized the Trump administration for <a href="https://basicincome.org/news/2018/11/andrew-yang-is-the-anti-trump-candidate/">waging a trade war with China</a>, saying it was “not productive” and causing headaches for businesses.</li>
            <li>At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UWVO0Trd1c">the third Democratic debate in September</a>, Yang said he would not immediately repeal Trump’s tariffs on China, but said, “I would let the Chinese know that we need to hammer out a deal, because these tariffs are pummeling producers and farmers and Iowa who have absolutely nothing to do with the trade imbalances with China.”</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>On <b>foreign policy:</b></p>

            <li>Yang would embody <a href="https://www.yang2020.com/policies/foreign-policy-first-principles/">a non-interventionist style of foreign policy</a>, saying on his campaign website that he would repeal the Authorization for the use of Military Force, fully returning the power to declare war to Congress.</li>
            <li>He also says he would focus on strengthening America’s relationships with its NATO allies and beef up the State Department’s diplomacy efforts and outreach.</li>
            <li>At the fifth Democratic debate in November, Yang joked that in his first phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin he would say, “sorry I beat your guy,” referring to Trump.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>On <b>taxes:</b></p>

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>On <b>jobs and the economy:</b></p>
          <ul>
            <li>The policy Yang is best known for is <a href="https://www.yang2020.com/policies/the-freedom-dividend/">his Freedom Dividend</a>, a universal basic income program that would give $1,000 per month to every American adult and would be funded in part by taxes on companies that benefit the most from automation.</li>
            <li>Yang supports expanding vocational and technical training for students, and a program where the IRS would <a href="https://www.yang2020.com/policies/get-america-moving/">reimburse relocation expenses</a> for people who have to move to find jobs.</li>
            <li>He would also create an <a href="https://www.yang2020.com/policies/american-journalism-fellows/">American Journalism Fellows</a> program that would give reporters grants to work at a local news outlet and report on local stories for four years.</li>

Many parents see that tradeoff and say if they leave the home and go to work, they’d be spending all that money on child care anyway.”</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>On <b>technology:</b></p>
          <ul>
            <li>As president, Yang would create a new cabinet-level position of Secretary of Technology and a Department of Technology, <a href="https://www.yang2020.com/policies/regulating-ai-emerging-technologies/">which would regulate artificial intelligence</a> and other new technologies.</li>
            <li>He also wants to incentivize healthcare and medical device companies to develop <a href="https://www.yang2020.com/policies/medical-technology-innovation/">new, innovative medical technologies.</a></li>
            <li>Yang supports bolstering federal regulation and standards <a href="https://www.yang2020.com/policies/digital-asset-regulation/">for cryptocurrency trading</a> and digital assets and enacting <a href="https://www.yang2020.com/policies/quantum-computing/">new encryption standards.</a></li>
            <li>He has also proposed giving people <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/andrew-yang-data-ownership-property-right-policy-2019-11">property rights over their own data</a>, and allowing them to profit from their data.</li>
            <li>In <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/18/perspectives/andrew-yang-technology/index.html">a November 18 op-ed for CNN</a>, Yang proposed creating a Department of Attention Economy to combat the negative and potentially addictive effects of technology on children and teens.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Some of Yang’s other unique policy proposals include <a href="https://www.yang2020.com/policies/ncaa-pay-athletes/">paying NCAA college athletes</a>, providing <a href="https://www.yang2020.com/policies/free-marriage-counseling/">free marriage counseling</a> for all, and <a href="https://www.yang2020.com/policies/american-exchange-program/">creating an exchange program</a> for high school students to spend time in different parts of the country and meet people they otherwise wouldn’t.</p>
      <h3>What are Andrew Yang’s biggest successes?</h3>
      <ul>

        <li>Yang went on to create <a href="https://ventureforamerica.org/about-us/">Venture For America</a>, a program that sends college graduates to work at startups in cities hit especially hard by the financial crisis.</li>
        <li>According to Yang, VFA’s 500 fellows and alums <a href="https://www.yang2020.com/meet-andrew/">have created more than 2,500 jobs</a> in cities all around the country.</li>
        <li>Yang received a <a href="https://www.yang2020.com/meet-andrew/">Champion of Change Award</a> from the Obama White House in 2012, and was named a Presidential Ambassador for Global Entrepreneurship in 2015. He’s also made the Fast Company list of the “100 most creative people in business.”</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>How much money has Andrew Yang raised?</h3>
      <p>Yang disclosed raising just $659,578 <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/P00006486/?cycle=2018&amp;amp;election_full=false">between October of 2017 and December of 2018. </a>But Yang’s fundraising took off after he appeared on The Joe Rogan Experience and the Breakfast Club, a popular podcast and radio show, respectively. Yang reported raising $1.7 million from 80,000 donors who donated an average of just $17.92 in March and February alone, bringing his quarterly haul to $1.8 million.</p>
      <p>In 2019’s second quarter between April 1 and June 30, the Yang campaign <a href="https://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/forms/C00659938/1341073">reported raising $2.8 million.</a> And in the third quarter between July 1 and September 30, Yang improved on his previous haul by a whopping $7.2 million, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-much-money-2020-democrats-candidates-have-raised-fundraising-2019-4">bringing in a total of $10 million</a> and beating out multiple US Senators.</p>
      <h3>How is Andrew Yang viewed by voters compared to the competition?</h3>
      <p>Insider has conducted a number of other polls to check in on how these candidates are perceived in comparison to one another. When we asked respondents to one poll to rank <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/2020-democratic-presidential-candidates-political-spectrum-ranking-2019-5">how far to the left or to the right they considered the candidates</a>, Yang was generally considered to be one of the more centrist candidates in the field.</p>
      <p>Owing to his outsider perspective, Yang was identified one of the least experienced candidates in the field by far when we asked respondents to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/most-experienced-2020-democratic-candidates-ranked-by-voters-2019-6">rank the candidates based on</a> <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/most-experienced-2020-democratic-candidates-ranked-by-voters-2019-6">how prepared they are for the rigors of the presidency</a> given what they knew about their history of public service and experience with government. And when asked how <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/2020-democratic-presidential-candidates-ranked-by-likability-2019-6">likable or personable respondents perceived the candidates to be</a>, Yang was in the middle of the pack.</p>
      <p>According to recent Insider polling, Yang also has the highest net support by far out of all the 2020 Democratic candidates <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/one-stat-shows-andrew-yang-ideal-2020-democratic-running-mate-2019-10">among undecided general election voters</a> who are considering voting for either party’s nominee.</p>
      <p>Out of the 268 undecided voters who knew of Yang, 46% would be satisfied with him as the nominee and 24% would not be satisfied, giving him positive net support of 21 percentage points, due to rounding error, among general election voters</p>
      <p>Furthermore, Yang is <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/andrew-yang-locking-down-more-supporters-non-frontrunners-2019-11">locking down way more loyal supporters</a> than any of the other candidates in the mid-tier of polling. Yang’s supporters like an average of 5.5 candidates total, the lowest number out of the mid-tier candidates out of six Insider polls conducted between early September and early November.</p>
      <h3>Could Andrew Yang beat Trump?</h3>
      <p>Yang is considered by Democrats who know of him to be a weaker candidate against President Trump, projected to lose more often and win less often than a standard competitor.</p>
      <h3>How do Democratic voters feel about Andrew Yang’s qualifications?</h3>
      <p>Insider has conducted polling about how voters feel about candidate attributes or qualifications. We asked respondents about a list of possible qualifications and if they made them more likely or less likely to vote for a candidate for president.</p>
