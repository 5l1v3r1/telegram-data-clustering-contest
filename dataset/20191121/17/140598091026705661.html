      <h1>Sport equality charity launches new online research to tackle lack of female representation at executive level</h1>

      <p>A leading sport and equality charity has launched innovative new online research designed to transform the culture of sports workplaces and tackle the under-representation of women at an executive level.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/2019/11/18/exclusive-major-sports-bodies-guilty-shocking-lack-womens-representation/">A Telegraph investigation </a>this week revealed that major international sports federations were facing calls to have their funding cut over the “shocking” lack of women in positions of boardroom influence.</p>
      <p>The statistics, which focussed on 10 major international federations and revealed that none had 40 per cent of women on their boards and only three even had 25 per cent, were described as “shocking and frightening” by Joanna Adams, the pioneering former chief executive of Netball England.</p>
      <p>It follows research by Women in Sport which found that 38 per cent of women working in sport had experienced discrimination in the workplace and 40 per cent felt undervalued. Only 46 per cent per cent believed that there was a fair and equal treatment of men and women in their organisation.</p>
      <p>Women in Sport is now focussed on tackling these cultural issues in the belief that is critical to creating an environment which will attract significantly more women into key executive roles. “<i>The Telegraph’s</i> investigation illustrates why there is still so much to be done to change the culture of sport,” said a spokesperson for Women in Sport. “We believe that women should not only be on boards but also part of an inclusive workplace culture that encourages female leadership and embraces diversity and inclusion.</p>
      <p>“Women in Sport is committed to transforming the culture of sports workplaces and we are currently running an online research community with women who work in sport, a first of its kind in this industry.” </p>
      <p>The focus for the community will be to understand in greater depth the needs and experiences of women working in sport and to then use this insight to drive solutions and best practice inside the sector.</p>
      <p>Figures from Sport England’s Annual Survey on Diversity in Sport Governance, have showed that women now make up an average 40 per cent of board members across Sport England and UK Sport-funded bodies, although a quarter of organisations still do not currently achieve the 30 per cent minimum. This was a Government commitment that was set in 2017 for all publicly funded sports bodies.</p>
      <p><i>The Telegraph’s</i> investigation centred on the International Olympic Committee, Fifa, the International Cricket Council, the International Basketball Federation (Fiba), World Rugby, World Athletics, the International Golf Federation, the International Tennis Federation, the International Hockey Federation and the International Cycling Union.</p>
      <p>The greatest gender imbalance was on the ICC, where just one of the 18 board members was female. None of the boards was led by a woman. <i>The Telegraph </i>investigation also revealed little change in most sports - with rugby a notable exception - since 2016, when Women on Boards conducted a previous survey.</p>
