      <p>(Reuters) - The United States generated more renewable fuel blending credits in October than in September, the Environmental Protection Agency said on Thursday.</p>
      <p>About 1.26 billion (D6) blending credits were generated in October, up from 1.20 billion in September, and 374.9 million biodiesel (D4) blending credits were generated in October, compared with 338.9 million a month earlier.</p>
      <p>The credits are used by oil refiners and importers to show compliance with EPA-mandated ethanol blending quotas for petroleum-based fuels. They are generated with every gallon of biofuel produced.</p>
